Lai Siu Chiu J:

1 This was a case where PT Swakarya Indah Busana (”the plaintiff”) sought to
invalidate trademarks registered by Dhan International Exim Pte Ltd (“the
defendant”) under the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Act”)
comprising of the words “EMPEROR MARTIN” and a star device (“the defendant’s
mark”). It was the plaintiff’s case that the defendant’s mark was registered
in bad faith and/or the registration was tainted with fraud.

The facts

2 The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Indonesia and is a manufacturer
of ready-made garments including shirts bearing the marks “MARTIN” (“the
plaintiff’s first mark”) and “MARTIN PACEMAKER” (“the plaintiff’s second
mark”) with stylized letters MR enclosed in an oblong device topped with a
crown. The plaintiff’s first mark is as follows:

while it’s second mark is as follows:

in the Case View Tools.]

3 The plaintiff’s second mark was registered in Indonesia as far back as 2
July 1983 and it was assigned to the plaintiff on or about 29 June 1987. In
Singapore, the plaintiff registered six marks under Class 25 of the
International Classification of Goods and Services (“ICGS”). All six
registered marks included the word “MARTIN” (collectively “the MARTIN marks”).

4 The defendant is a Singapore company registered on 4 April 1988 which was
converted from a sole-proprietorship that began business in 1971, initially as
an importer and wholesaler of Indian saris. In early 2000, the defendant
expanded its business to include the sale of men’s shirts catering to the
Indian community in the “Little India” area of Singapore at Serangoon Road.
The defendant ceased to be a retailer in 2003 and continued its business as a
wholesaler operating from No 46 Upper Dickson Road (“the defendant’s shop”)
while its office for administration purposes was at No 1 North Bridge Road
#11-08, High Street Centre, Singapore (“the defendant’s office”). The
defendant has two directors who are siblings viz Sanjay Sunder (“Sanjay”) and
Neeraj Sunder Samnani (“Neeraj”).

5 In May 2002, the defendant applied to register the defendant’s mark for its
own brand of men’s shirts. The defendant’s mark was approved for registration
in May 2003 under Class 25 of the ICGS and the defendant commenced selling
shirts using the defendant’s mark in 2004.

6 The plaintiff’s shirts marketed under the plaintiff’s first and second marks
as well as the MR device shown at [2] (hereinafter collectively referred to as
“the MARTIN shirts”) have been sold in Singapore since 1982. They were shipped
from Indonesia to Tan Lai Seng Trading Company (“TLS”) (a sole-proprietorship
of one Tan Say Boon) who was the exclusive distributor for the promotion,
marketing and sale of the MARTIN shirts in Singapore. In turn TLS distributed
the MARTIN shirts through no less than seven dealers which included Ho Keh Hee
trading as Meng Lee (“Meng Lee”).

7 Between 1992 and 1994, Radha Exports (“Radha”) a sole-proprietorship, was
the plaintiff’s Singapore distributor in place of TLS. In 1995, Radha Exports
Pte Ltd (“REPL) the successor company to Radha, took over the distribution of
the MARTIN shirts.

8 The plaintiff first applied in Singapore to register the plaintiff’s second
mark and the MR device on 11 May 1981 through TLS. The application was
rejected by the Registrar of Trade Marks based on the old Trade Marks Act
(since repealed on 15 January 1999).

9 Subsequently, Radha filed an application on or about 16 February 1989 to
register the plaintiff’s first mark and the MR device. Again the application
was rejected. Both this and the earlier unsuccessful application were filed
with the plaintiff’s consent.

10 On or about 10 October 1991, the plaintiff filed an application to register
the plaintiff’s second mark. Once again, the application was rejected.

11 Earlier the plaintiff had three marks registered. One was for the mark
MARFIN with the MR device which was first registered on 21 March 1985 (“the
MARFIN mark”). The plaintiff was assigned the MARFIN mark after it sued the
registrant Meng Lee (its former retailer) in Originating Motion No 18 of 1992
(“the OM”). In the OM, the plaintiff and its retailers had applied to expunge
the MARFIN mark. The OM was discontinued after the plaintiff signed a
settlement agreement on 22 May 1992 (“the settlement agreement”) with and
paid, Meng Lee a sum of $360,000 to assign the MARFIN mark to the plaintiff.

12 The second mark registered on 26 October 1998 was for the words LEO MARTIN.
The original registrant Mohamed Mustafa & Samsuddin Pte Ltd (Singapore)
subsequently assigned the mark to the plaintiff.

13 The third mark resulted from Suit No 14 of 2008 (“the 1992 Suit”) where the
plaintiff sued Meng Lee (and his daughter Ho Foong Nee) for breach of the
settlement agreement in [11] when Meng Lee registered the mark MARTIN KING and
M device on 4 May 2000 without the plaintiff’s authority. The 1992 suit was
eventually resolved by the signing of a settlement agreement wherein Meng Lee
agreed to assign the MARTIN KING and M marks to the plaintiff.

14 The plaintiff eventually managed to register the plaintiff’s first mark and
the plaintiff’s second mark, together with the stylized letters MR on 20 June
2006. Subsequently, on 11 April 2007, the plaintiff registered the MR device.
These were the plaintiff’s fourth, fifth and sixth marks respectively.

15 In summary, the plaintiff’s current registered marks are the following:

[LawNet Admin Note: Image 3 is viewable only by LawNet subscribers via the PDF
in the Case View Tools.]

16 The plaintiff’s marketing manager Alvernia Tan (“Alvernia”) deposed in her
first affidavit that the essential feature of the plaintiff’s MARTIN marks was
the word MARTIN. This equally applied to the three marks registered by the
plaintiff personally (numbered 4, 5 and 6 in [15]) as well as to the three
earlier marks that were assigned to the plaintiff.

17 Alvernia deposed that since 1982 at least, the plaintiff had sold and it
continues to sell in substantial quantities in Singapore, MARTIN shirts. Sales
were first made through TLS and later through REPL.

18 Through TLS, in 1982, the plaintiff sold 287 dozens of MARTIN shirts. In
1990, the quantities sold peaked at 67,820 dozens. In terms of value, the
sales were $18,655 in 1982 and by 1990, they had increased to $4,408,300.

19 The following chart showed the estimated total sales made by TLS between
1982 and 1991:

|  **Grand Total** |  **13,628,691.00**  
  
20 As for the sales made by Radha of MARTIN shirts between 1992 and 1994, they
were as follows:

**YEAR** |  **QUANTITY OF  
MARTIN SHIRTS (PIECES)** |  **ESTIMATED SALES

**Total** |  **1,738,524** |  **8,255,211.00**  
  
21 After it took over from Radha as the plaintiff’s distributor, REPL made the
following sales between 1995 and February 2008:

**YEAR** |  **QUANTITY OF  
MARTIN SHIRTS (PIECES)** |  **TOTAL SALES PRICE

(Jan-Feb) |  11,455 |  66,820.00  
|  **Grand Total** |  **14,868,404.00**  
  
22 In addition to obtaining supplies of MARTIN shirts from the plaintiffs,
REPL also obtained its supplies from PT Karwikarya Wisman Graha (“PTK”) which
is an Indonesian company established in 1996 with the same shareholders as the
plaintiff. Through PTK, REPL imported into Singapore between 1997 and February
2008 the following quantities of MARTIN shirts:

**YEAR** |  **QUANTITY OF  
MARTIN SHIRTS (PIECES)** |  **TOTAL SALES PRICE  
IN S$**  
---|---|---

2008 |  47,822 |  278,849.66  
|  **Grand Total** |  **9,436,712.75**  
  
23 The sales figures in [21] to [25] were confirmed by Radha and REPL by the
first affidavit filed on 18 December 2008 by Naraindas Gangaram (“Naraindas”),
its manager partner and managing-director respectively.

24 Alvernia asserted that over the years since 1982, the plaintiff had built
up a solid goodwill and reputation in its MARTIN shirts in Singapore. She
deposed that in early 2008, the plaintiff learnt of the defendant’s mark which
appears as follows:

25 The plaintiff further ascertained that the defendant was a customer of
MARTIN shirts and had purchased from REPL the following quantities and values
of MARTIN shirts between November 2005 and October 2007:

**No** |  **Date** |  **Invoice No** |  **Quantity Supplied

26 The plaintiff decided to investigate and obtain independent evidence of the
defendant’s use of the defendant’s mark. The plaintiff engaged a firm called
Commercial Investigations LLC (“CI”) to ascertain:

(a) the actual use of the defendant’s mark by the defendant;

(b) to secure sample purchases of the MARTIN shirts offered for sale by the
defendant;

(c) to ascertain why the defendant chose the word MARTIN as part of the
defendant’s mark.

The persons from CI who conducted the investigations were (i) Tan Chin Hock;
(ii) Lau Weida and (iii) Tan Chye Soon (collectively “the investigators”).

27 I turn now to the investigators’ findings starting with those of Tan Chin
Hock (“TCH”). In his affidavit, TCH deposed that he visited the defendant’s
shop on 21 February 2008 together with Lau Weida (‘Lau”). Neeraj introduced
himself to TCH and Lau (“the two investigators’) and said the defendant dealt
mainly in saris. The two investigators noted there were shirts in the shop
bearing the defendant’s mark as well as shirts with the label MARTIN WORLD
(which Neeraj said the defendant no longer manufactured). The two
investigators were told long-sleeved shirts with the defendant’s mark cost
$5.50 each or $66 per dozen. Neeraj revealed that those shirts (made in China)
were exported to India, Thailand, Saudi Arabia and other countries.

28 The two investigators noticed that the defendant’s shop also stocked long-
sleeved shirts with the plaintiff’s second mark (ie MARTIN PACEMAKER) and when
asked by TCH, Neeraj said the Indonesia-made shirts were priced at $6.30 each.
Neeraj said he could offer the two investigators a cheaper price of $4.00 per
shirt if they purchased in bulk shirts with the defendant’s mark but he could
not reduce the price for shirts with the plaintiff’s second mark because it
was the original MARTIN brand but he had ‘duplicated’ the MARTIN brand because
some customers wanted cheaper things and yet looked for MARTIN shirts. Neeraj
added that there were seven other different MARTIN brands in Singapore but
only those with the plaintiff’s second mark was the ‘original’ and that was
why it was the most expensive amongst the MARTIN brands. Neeraj informed the
two investigators that the defendant dealt in two MARTIN brands and that the
EMPEROR MARTIN brand was in the market for about 5-6 years while shirts with
the plaintiff’s second mark had been in the market for 15 years.

29 The two investigators ascertained that the defendant’s shop stocked men’s
underwear, men’s socks and men’s shirts under the following labels:

[LawNet Admin Note: Image 5 is viewable only by LawNet subscribers via the PDF
in the Case View Tools.]

The defendant’s shop also stocked round neck and polo T-shirts under the
DIVOLKA brand.

30 The two investigators purchased one dozen EMPEROR MARTIN socks (at $4.00),
one EMPEROR MARTIN shirt at $5.50, one box of EMPEROR MARTIN men’s briefs at
$2.00 (for 3), one DIVOLKA brand T-shirt as well as one pair of DIVOLKA brand
shorts. The EMPEROR MARTIN shirt and the other items purchased by the two
investigators did not bear the defendant’s mark as registered (see [24]
above). Instead, they bore the marks shown in [29] on the plastic packaging
and on the hang tags while the EMPEROR MARTIN shirt had the get-up below on
the label of the collar and on the hang tag that was attached to one of the
front buttons:

[LawNet Admin Note: Image 6 is viewable only by LawNet subscribers via the PDF
in the Case View Tools.]

(The above get-up was described as “the defendant’s tailored mark” in the
plaintiff’s closing submissions and for convenience the description will
similarly be adopted in this judgment). The receipt that was issued for the
above purchases (see exhibit TCH-6 in TCH’s affidavit) described the
defendant’s shirt as “MARTIN EMPEROR”.

31 The sample of its shirt that the defendant produced in court (“the
defendant’s sample”) had a label on its collar that stated:

[LawNet Admin Note: Image 7 is viewable only by LawNet subscribers via the PDF
in the Case View Tools.]

Other than the collar, the markings on the plastic wrapping of the defendant’s
sample reflected the defendant’s tailored mark in [30].

32 The third investigator Tan Chye Soon (“TCS”) visited the defendant’s office
on 22 February 2008 where Sanjay attended to him. When he inquired, Sanjay
told TCS that the defendant’s mark indeed belonged to the defendant and that
the company had started manufacturing men’s shirts about two years ago using
the defendant’s mark. TSC was told the defendant only sold shirts that used
the defendant’s mark. Sanjay also said MARTIN Classic shirts were very
saleable and indicated there were also two other brands with the word MARTIN
called MARTIN ROYAL and MARTIN WORLD but claimed no knowledge of either brand.
TCS made no sample purchases as Sanjay had informed him the defendant’s office
carried no stocks and referred TCS to the defendant’s shop.

33 In summary, the investigators ascertained the following facts:

(a) the defendant originally sold men’s shirts under the plaintiff’s second
mark;

(b) later, the defendant duplicated the plaintiff’s second mark by using the
word MARTIN on the defendant’s mark because some customers (especially foreign
workers) wanted cheaper shirts that looked like MARTIN shirts;

(c) The investigators were told that there were seven other different MARTIN
brands of shirts in Singapore but only MARTIN PACEMAKER was the original and
it was also the most expensive amongst the MARTIN brands;

(d) the defendant only dealt in two MARTIN brands;

(e) the defendant’s mark and the plaintiff’s second mark had been in the
market for 5-6 years and 15 years respectively.

34 I turn next to the affidavits filed on the defendant’s behalf by Sanjay. In
his first affidavit, Sanjay deposed that prior to May 2002, he and his brother
surveyed the market and found there were several brands of shirts bearing the
MARTIN brand which were very popular amongst end buyers. Before the
defendant’s mark was registered, the defendant’s solicitors conducted searches
in the trade marks registry and found at least 35 variations of the MARTIN
mark had been applied for and registered by different entities over the last
27 years. In addition, Sanjay discovered two other marks MARTIN PLUS and
MARTIN KING PACEMAKER were found on shirts sold in the Serangoon Road area.
Besides MARTIN PACEMAKER, there were shirts being sold that bore the words
MARTIN ORIGINAL, MARTIN EXECUTIVE, _Martin_ SUPER (registered on 13 October
2006 by one of the plaintiff’s retailers Everyman’s Shopping Centre) and
MARTIN CROWN. He added that when the defendant applied to register EMPEROR
MARTIN in May 2002, there were already eleven other registered trade marks
bearing the MARTIN mark for men’s shirts but none were registered by the
plaintiff.

35 Sanjay asserted that MARTIN was a common denominator and contrary to what
Alvernia claimed in her affidavit, the plaintiff did not have exclusive use of
the word. He claimed that the defendant added the word EMPEROR as a prefix to
the word MARTIN (unlike the MARTIN marks which had suffixes) to “convey the
majestic era of days gone by when emperors used to rule India”. (This claim
however was not borne out in the actual usage of the defendant’s mark as was
noted in [30] above).

36 Sanjay made a meticulous comparison of the plaintiff’s shirts bearing the
plaintiff’s second mark and the defendant’s shirts bearing the defendant’s
mark and found twelve differences between them.

37 With regard to the defendant’s actual use of the defendant’s tailored mark
on its men’s shirts as shown in [30] above, Sanjay deposed that both words
EMPEROR MARTIN were in upper casing but different fonts were used “purely for
marketing strategy”.

38 Sanjay gave the following sales figures of EMPEROR MARTIN shirts by the
defendant:

**Year** |  **Turnover (S$)**  
---|---  
2004 |  19,855.00  
2005 |  37,129.21  
2006 |  4,398.00  
2007 |  17,621.80  
2008 |  13,324.35  
2009 |  853.68  
  
  

39 Sanjay exhibited invoices to his affidavit to support the above sales. I
note however (as the plaintiff observed in its closing submissions) that save
for one, the other 25 invoices were not issued by the defendant but by one LRN
Shokai and even more curious, two of those invoices were issued by LRN Shokai
(which has the same address as the defendant’s office) to the defendant. The
invoices were also confined to sales in October to December 2004 and January
2005 and March 2005. No invoices were produced for the years 2006 to 2008, an
omission for which the plaintiff drew an adverse conclusion in its closing
submissions.

40 In his second affidavit, Sanjay accused Alvernia of withholding material
facts from the court. In particular, he alleged that she had failed to
disclose that the plaintiff paid the very substantial sum of $360,000 for the
assignment of the MARFIN trade mark from Meng Lee. He further alleged that
Alvernia failed to disclose that Meng Lee had sued Radha in January 1992 for
trademark infringement and passing-off. He then alleged that after the
defendant received the plaintiff’s first letter of demand, a director
(Naraindas) of Radha (with whom the defendant had a cordial business and
social relationship) told his brother Neeraj that the litigation was not
Radha’s idea and the defendant should assign the defendant’s mark to the
plaintiff.

41 Sanjay then embarked on a comparison of the MARTIN marks with those filed
by the registrants of _Martin_ SUPER, LEO MARTIN and MARFIN (before the last
two marks were assigned to the plaintiff). Sanjay claimed that the three marks
were even closer to the plaintiff’s first and second marks. In relation to the
_Martin_ SUPER mark, he wondered why the plaintiff had not taken action
against the registrant and he noted that the plaintiff took an assignment for
the mark LEO MARTIN from the registrant Mohd Mustaffa & Samsuddin Co Pte Ltd
in 2008.

42 Finally, Sanjay questioned the lack of explanation from the plaintiff as to
why it waited for 15 years after its failed attempt in October 1991 in [10]
before it applied in June 2006 to register the plaintiff’s first and second
marks. Further, he questioned why the plaintiff left it first to TSL and later
to Radha to register the plaintiff’s second and first marks respectively,
purely on the understanding that the two distributors would assign the trade
marks to the plaintiff subsequently. He wondered why the plaintiff took no
further steps after the applications by TSL and Radha applications were
rejected by the trade marks registry.

43 Sanjay’s second affidavit drew a response from Alvernia as well as from
Radha. In her reply affidavit, Alvernia explained that it instituted the OM
proceedings together with its seven Singapore trading partners. However, the
plaintiff was concerned that unless the OM as well as the 1992 suit commenced
by Meng Lee against Radha were resolved expeditiously, its retailers would not
be able to sell the plaintiff’s shirts and would suffer a heavy financial
burden. That was the reason that prompted the plaintiff to resolve the
disputes quickly to avoid potentially lengthy legal proceedings.

44 Alvernia pointed out that Meng Lee did not deny its MARFIN mark copied the
plaintiff’s MARTIN marks and in the settlement agreement, Meng Lee
acknowledged the plaintiff’s rights to the MARTIN marks in Indonesia.

45 Alvernia noted that Sanjay and Neeraj had admitted they conducted a survey
and had found shirts in the market bearing the plaintiff’s second mark and the
mark MARTIN KING. In other words, the two brothers knew of the plaintiff’s
second mark before they applied to register the defendant’s mark.

46 Neeraj filed one affidavit on the defendant’s behalf where he sought to
give his version of the conversation he had with TCH on 21 February 2008 when
the two investigators visited the defendant’s shop posing as buyers of MARTIN
PACEMAKER or EMPEROR MARTIN shirts. Neeraj pointed out that the defendant
openly displayed EMPEROR MARTIN shirts at the shop. He contended he did not
tell TCH that the defendant had stopped manufacturing MARTIN WORLD shirts –
the defendant never manufactured such shirts. He had instead said the
defendant stopped selling such shirts because its supplier ceased selling
them.

47 Neeraj confirmed he candidly told the two investigators that MARTIN
PACEMAKER had been around for 15 years while EMPEROR MARTIN was around for 5-6
years. Neeraj claimed his knowledge of MARTIN PACEMAKER was based on
information given by the defendant’s customers. He himself was personally
aware of the Martin marks after the defendant started distributing shirts with
the defendant’s mark in 2004. Consequently, he argued, the information he
obtained in 2005 could not be used to impute bad faith to the defendant in
2002.

48 Neeraj explained that when he told TCH that the plaintiff’s shirt was
‘original’ (see [28]), he was actually repeating what the defendant’s
customers told him and by ‘original’ he meant the first in time. He pointed
out that there was a brand of shirts called MARTIN Original registered in the
trade marks registry in December 2005 and the plaintiff did not appear to be
affected by it.

49 Neeraj explained that when he said the defendant ‘duplicated’ the MARTIN
brand he meant manufacturing a MARTIN shirt with its own distinctiveness. He
did not mean duplicating the plaintiff’s MARTIN shirts as the defendant did
not know who owned the MARTIN PACEMAKER brand as it was not even registered at
the time.

50 Naraindas filed a second affidavit on behalf of REPL wherein he confirmed
that he and the plaintiff had an arrangement whereby Radha would register the
plaintiff’s first mark for expediency and later would assign the same to the
plaintiff. He clarified that REPL was/is not a retailer but a distributor and
it supplied goods to a number of retailers including its sister company ABC
Express which sells MARTIN shirts.

51 Naraindas deposed he first heard about EMPEROR MARTIN shirts three years
ago. Because shirts bearing that mark were not sold widely or in large
quantities, the brand did not make an impression on him and he did not inform
the plaintiff. Moreover, the defendant continued to buy MARTIN shirts from
REPL albeit it was not his company’s biggest buyer. Hence, he did not
appreciate that the defendant was attempting to capitalise on the MARTIN marks
until early 2008 when he was informed by the plaintiff.

52 Naraindas clarified that his conversation with Neeraj in [40] was purely to
recommend an amicable settlement with the plaintiff as he understood the
plaintiff had a good case.

The submissions

53 As stated in [1], the plaintiff claimed that the defendant’s mark was
registered in bad faith and tainted with fraud, based on s 23 of the Act which
states:

**Grounds for invalidity of registration**

(1) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground
that the trade mark was registered in breach of section 7.

(2) Where the registered trade mark was registered in breach of section 7 in
that it is a trade mark referred to in subsection (1) (_b_), (_c_) or (_d_) of
that section, it shall not be declared invalid if, in consequence of the use
which has been made of it, it has after registration acquired a distinctive
character in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered.

(3) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground —

(a) that there is an earlier trade mark in relation to which —

(i) the conditions set out in section 8 (1) or (2) apply;

(ii) where the trade mark has been registered pursuant to an application for
registration of the trade mark made before 1st July 2004, the conditions set
out in section 8 (3) apply; or

(iii) where the trade mark has been registered pursuant to an application for
registration of the trade mark made on or after 1st July 2004, the conditions
set out in section 8 (4) apply; or

(b) that there is an earlier right in relation to which the condition set out
in section 8 (7) is satisfied,

unless the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier right has
consented to the registration.

(4) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground of
fraud in the registration or that the registration was obtained by
misrepresentation.

54 Besides ss 23(1) and (4), the plaintiff had also relied on s 7(6) of the
Act which states:

**Absolute grounds for refusal of registration**

7(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the
application is made in bad faith.

55 The plaintiff had also cited s 5(2)(e)(ii) of the Act

**Application for registration**

5(2) The application shall —

(e) state —

(ii) that the applicant has a bona fide intention that the trade mark should
be so used.

for its argument that the defendant’s conduct showed that it never intended to
use the defendant’s mark and hence s 7(6) applied.

56 The defendant on the other hand contended that the plaintiff’s claim was
misconceived as the plaintiff’s first and second marks were unregistered (as
at 26 May 2002) whereas the defendant’s mark was registered.

57 It was further argued by the defendant that it had taken reasonable steps
to verify the position by conducting a survey on the different types of MARTIN
shirts in the market prior to registration of the defendant’s mark (see
Sanjay’s statements in [34] above). Additionally, the defendant pointed out
that none of the eleven MARTIN marks were registered by the plaintiff.
Consequently, the defendant contended, it did not and could not be expected to
know of the proprietorship of the plaintiff’s first and second marks. The
defendant highlighted that the plaintiff did not commence an alternative
action in passing-off against the defendant.

58 The plaintiff countered the defendant’s argument in [56] by pointing out
that the plaintiff’s claim was based on first usage at common law of the
plaintiff’s first and second marks since at least 1982. The plaintiff argued
that registration of either mark was not the determinant (see _DALIC Trade
Mark_ [1998] 2 SLR 231 where Lim Teong Qwee JC said at p 236 [12]:-

..in the case of a used trade mark the proprietor is the person who first used
it in relation to goods or services for the purpose stated in the definition
of ‘trade mark’ under the Act.

(“The Act” referred to in the above passage of the judgment was the Trade
Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed) which was the predecessor of the (present) Act).
The above passage was endorsed recently by our courts in _Weir Warman Ltd v
Research & Development Pty Ltd_ [2007] 2 SLR 1073, a case cited by both
parties which involved a similar application by the plaintiff in the action to
invalidate and revoke a trade mark pursuant to ss 23(1) and 7(6) of the Act.

The law

59 The legislative provisions relevant to the parties’ dispute have been set
out earlier at [53] to [55]. It would be appropriate at this juncture to
review some of the case-law relating to bad faith and fraud in the
registration of trade marks.

60 I start with _McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd_ [2005] 1 SLR
177 (the “ _McDonald’s_ case”). There, the defendant/respondent applied to
register three marks viz “MacTea”, “MacChocolate” and “MacNoodles” along with
an eagle device, in Class 30 of the ICGS. McDonald’s unsuccessfully opposed
the applications before the Registrar of Trade Marks as well as before the
High Court under the former Act (1992 Ed) on the following grounds:

(1) under s 12(1) – that the defendant’s claim to proprietorship was not made
in good faith as it had copied the common distinctive prefix of the
appellant’s family of marks namely “Mc”;

(2) under s 15 – that registration of the three marks would likely deceive or
cause confusion to the public; and

(3) under s 23(1) – that the application marks were identical with or nearly
resembled the trade marks belonging to McDonalds.

61 McDonalds appealed to the Court of Appeal. In dismissing McDonald’s appeal,
Chao Hick Tin JA _inter alia_ held that McDonald’s marks and the defendant’s
marks were neither visually nor aurally similar. McDonald’s marks were usually
displayed together with the golden arches or sold in packaging bearing the
golden arches. The word components of the rival marks were different in terms
of colour, font and typeface. Even though the defendant’s marks consisted of a
device common to the trade (the eagle device), this did not mean that the
marks were incapable of being distinctive since they had to be examined as a
whole. The learned judge observed at [78]:

…An allegation of bad faith is a serious matter and should not be lightly
inferred. In _“Royal Enfield” Trade Marks_ [2002] RPC 24 it was held (at [31])
that:

An allegation that a trade mark has been applied for in bad faith is a serious
allegation…A plea of fraud should not lightly be made…and if made should be
distinctly alleged and distinctly proved. It is not permissible to leave fraud
to be inferred from the facts (see _Davy v Garrett_ (1877-78) LR 7 Ch.D 473 at
489). In my judgment precisely the same considerations apply to an allegation
of....bad faith made under section 3(6 _). It should not be made unless it can
be fully and properly pleaded and should not be upheld unless it is distinctly
proved and this will rarely be possible by a process of inference_ [emphasis
added].

62 The _McDonald’s_ case sets out the high standard of proof required for an
allegation of bad faith, which was reiterated in _Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v
Jeffery Mark Richard and another_ [2007] 1 SLR 1071. In the 2007 case, the
court added that once bad faith was established, the application to register
the trade mark in question would not be allowed even if the mark did not cause
any confusion or breach of duty and even where marks were not identical.

63 I turn next to _Rothmans of Pall Mall Limited v Maycolson International
Ltd_ [2006] 2 SLR 551 (“the _Rothmans_ ’ case”) a case cited by both parties
and which was a decision of this court. The case addressed the issue of bad
faith under s 7(6) of the Act specifically for the first time in our courts.
There, the applicant was the registered proprietor of numerous trade marks in
Class 34 of the ICGS (viz cigarettes) containing the word “Rothmans”. The
applicant opposed the registration by the respondent of a mark called
“Fairlight”. The respondent was a licensee of two Germans Axel and Klaus
Hertlein who operated a business that distributed Fairlight cigarettes. The
respondent applied to register a mark containing the word Fairlight on a blue
hexagon-shaped background under Class 34. This was despite the fact that an
identical mark was the subject of pending trade mark infringement proceedings
overseas. Despite the applicant’s opposition citing the following sections of
the Act:

(i) s 7(6);

(ii) s 8(2)(b) – that the mark was likely to cause confusion and

(iii) s 8(4) – breach of the law of passing-off and copyright

the Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks (“the PAR”) accepted the
application for registration.

64 I allowed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the PAR as I found
that the applicant had made out its case that the application to register the
Fairlight mark was made in bad faith. It was not disputed that the get-up of
the Fairlight mark was identical to the “Rothmans” registered marks.

65 On the specific issue of bad faith under s 7(6) of the Act, I had said:

26 I am further convinced that the issues of bad faith and breach should be
kept distinct because of their differing underlying rationales. The “bad
faith” doctrine is wider in its ambit, as it encompasses conduct which may be
morally but not legally reprehensible. This is best summed up by the comments
of Hobbs QC in relation to the English equivalent of our s 7(6) (_ie_ , 3(6)
of the UK Trade Marks Act 1994 (c 26). In _Demon Ale Trade Mark_ [2000] RPC
345 (at 356), Hobbs QC stated that:

[T]he expression “bad faith” has moral overtones which appear to make it
possible for an application for registration to be rendered invalid under
section 3(6) by behaviour which otherwise involves no breach of any duty,
obligation, prohibition or requirement that is legally binding upon the
applicant.

29 The court is entitled to make a finding of bad faith despite the fact that
the marks in question are not so similar as to cause confusion. Indeed, both
the Applicant and the Respondent were in agreement on this point and had
submitted that the determination of confusion and the establishment of bad
faith were two distinct issues that should be considered separately…

66 In the _Rothmans_ ’ case, I had referred to a passage from _Gromax
Plasticulture v Don & Low Nonwovens_ [1999] RPC 367 where the UK courts first
attempted to define the concept of “bad faith”. It would be appropriate to set
out the same instructive passage from Lindsay LJ’s judgment where he said (at
p 379):

I shall not attempt to define bad faith in this context. Plainly it includes
dishonesty and, as I hold, includes also some dealings which fall short of the
standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and
experienced men in the particular area being examined. Parliament has wisely
not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not bad faith in this
context; how far a dealing must so fall-short in order to amount to bad faith
is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by the courts
(which leads to the danger of the courts then construing not the Act but the
paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a regard to all
material surrounding circumstances…

67 I had also referred to _Harrison v Teton Valley Trading Co Ltd_ [2004] 1
WLR 2577 in _Rothmans’_ case (at [20] to [23]) which case again dealt with the
issue of bad faith. There Sir William Aldous has this to say (at p 2585):

24 Clearly, the court, when considering bad faith, cannot apply a purely
subjective test, called by Lord Hutton [in _Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley_ [2002] 2
AC 164] “the Robin Hood test”. The dishonest person or one with low standards
cannot be permitted to obtain trade mark registrations in circumstances where
a person abiding by a reasonable standard would not. The registration of a
trade mark is designed to enable bona fide proprietors to protect their
proprietary rights without having to prove unfair trading. Registration is not
provided to help those with low moral standards.

26 For my part, I would accept the reasoning of Lord Hutton as applying to
considerations of bad faith. The words “bad faith” suggest a mental state.
Clearly when considering the question of whether an application to register is
made in bad faith all the circumstances will be relevant. However the court
must decide whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision
to apply for registration would be regarded as in bad faith by persons
adopting proper standards.

68 Having reviewed the relevant case law on the meaning of “bad faith”, I turn
next to the case law on fraud and misrepresentation, under s 23(4) of the Act
(set out earlier at [53]).

69 The plaintiff had cited the UK case _Bentley Motors (1931) Ld v Lagonda, Ld
and Walker Owen Bentley_ (1947) 64 RPC 33 for the test of fraud. There,
Justice Roxburgh said (at p 35);

I am most anxious to avoid defining “fraud” in the context in which it appears
here, because apparently it has not yet been done, and I am not anxious to be
the first to do it if it is not necessary for me to do it; but when I see in
conjunction the words “obtained by fraud”, I feel bound to hold that it
involves some element of actual deception by the applicant for registration. I
want to make it plain that in using the phrase “actual deception” I do not
necessarily exclude all omissions because it is quite possible, and I think it
is trite saying, that a statement may be in such a form that having regard to
what is omitted it is deceptive, though on the face of it and taken quite
alone it is not deceptive.

But in my judgment a claimant who sets out to say that registration was
obtained by fraud must allege some actual deception by word or deed, or some
omission by word or deed, of the character which I have just indicated;…

70 Justice Roxburgh’s dictum was adopted by our High Court in _Yomeishu Seizo
Co Ltd and another v Sinma Medical Products (S) Pte Ltd_ [1991] SLR 499 at 509
and more recently by the Court of Appeal in _Wing Joo Loong Ginseng Hong
(Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd_ [2009] 2 SLR
814.

The decision

71 Having reviewed the law, I return to our case. Looking at the facts as a
whole, I have little doubt that the defendant’s mark was registered in bad
faith in breach of s 7(6) and/or s 23(4) of the Act.

72 As observed earlier (at [29] and [30]), the defendant’s mark was not used
by the defendant for its shirts or for the other three items of clothing that
it sold. Despite the claim of Sanjay (at [35]) that the defendant used the
word EMPEROR as a prefix “to convey the majestic era of days gone by when
emperors used to rule India”, the defendant’s tailored mark that was actually
used on its shirt did not bear out Sanjay’s claim; indeed, it was the reverse.
The defendant’s tailored mark had the word EMPEROR conspicuously smaller (font
20) than the word MARTIN which font size (48) was more than twice as large.
Moreover, the word EMPEROR appeared above the word MARTIN so that there was no
question of pronouncing the brand as EMPEROR MARTIN. I reject Sanjay’s
assertion in [37] that the different fonts were used purely for ‘marketing
strategy’. It was a deliberate act on the part of the defendant to copy the
plaintiff’s first and second marks by placing emphasis on the word MARTIN
rather than on the word EMPEROR.

73 The plaintiff had pointed out the similarities between its shirt bearing
the plaintiff’s second mark and the defendant’s shirt (in para 69 of its
submissions) to support its contention that the defendant was riding on the
goodwill and reputation of the MARTIN marks. The plaintiff went further (at
para 125) to point out (with which I agree) that the purchaser of the
defendant’s shirts would not pause to analyse the packaging and look for the
connection between the word EMPEROR and MARTIN, given that the latter
completely overwhelmed and overshadowed the word EMPEROR in actual usage.
There was a further suggestion in the plaintiff’s submissions that the concept
of the crown in the MR device of the plaintiff’s first and second marks had
also been copied by the defendant but replaced by the word EMPEROR.

74 I believe the likely scenario in the defendant’s shop would be the
following:

A customer walks in and asks for a MARTIN shirt. The defendant’s staff would
show the plaintiff’s shirt to the customer. If the customer attempts to
bargain down the price or complain that the price (of $6.30 was too high), the
defendant’s staff would produce the shirts bearing the defendant’s tailored
mark stating it was cheaper at $4.00 each. The general perception to a member
of the public would be that the defendant’s shirt and the plaintiff’s shirt
were from one and the same source _ie_ from the same manufacturer because both
bore the label MARTIN. The unwitting customer would therefore purchase the
defendant’s shirt, not the plaintiff’s because of the price difference.

That would be how the defendant rode on the goodwill and reputation of the
MARTIN shirts. The defendant would sell its shirts by capitalising on the
price difference between its shirts and the plaintiff’s shirts but in so
doing, it misrepresented its shirt as a cheaper version of the more expensive
MARTIN PACEMAKER or MARTIN shirt albeit from the same source. Consequently,
the fact that the defendant’s shop also stocked the plaintiff’s shirts is not
a redeeming factor that meant the defendant did not ride on the goodwill of
the plaintiff’s reputation as the defendant suggested in its closing
submissions.

75 The defendant’s conduct in the scenario I have painted above amounted to
deception of the defendant’s customers most of whom (particularly foreign
workers) were neither highly educated nor discerning enough to tell the
difference between the defendant’s and the plaintiff’s shirts. The price range
of both shirts (despite the $2.00 difference) meant that their market was the
less well-off consumer who shopped in Little India. Consequently, I reject the
purported highlighting of the word EMPEROR as opposed to the word MARTIN in
the defendant’s tailored mark, as argued in the defendant’s submissions (at
para 55) and in Sanjay’s first affidavit (at para 25).

76 The facts of this case are reminiscent of _Betty’s Kitchen Coronation
Street Trade Mark_ [2000] RPC 825 which concerned the mark below:

[LawNet Admin Note: Image 8 is viewable only by LawNet subscribers via the PDF
in the Case View Tools.]

In the above case, the UK Trade Mark Registrar Mr Reynolds refused to register
Granada Television’s (the applicant’s) mark Betty’s Kitchen Coronation Street
under Classes 29 and 30 (as a food item) because he found there was no
intention to use the mark in the form applied for.

77 The registration of the mark (under s 3(6) of the UK Trade Marks Act 1994)
had been opposed by Betty & Taylors Group Ltd (‘Bettys”) who were proprietors
of a number of restaurants and associated shops. Mr Reynolds found that on the
applicant’s packaging for its hot pot product, the elements “Betty’s Kitchen”
and “Coronation Street” were positioned some distance apart and in a wholly
different style from the mark applied for. Mr Reynolds had this to say (at p
842):

Against that background [Bettys’ opposition] it seems to me that the mark
applied for is an attempt by the applicants to put sufficient distance between
themselves and the opponents for the purposes of securing a registration but
without the mark being a true reflection of what is conceded to be the
intended and actual form of use. Taking all these circumstances into account I
have come to the view that the applicants’ dealings fall short of “acceptable
commercial behaviour” to use Lindsay LJ’s words (see [66]).

78 The above comment would equally apply to the defendant’s mark. Sanjay had
deposed (see [34]) that the defendant conducted searches in the Trade Marks
Register and found at least 35 variations of the MARTIN trade mark. He said he
and Neeraj conducted a survey of the market and discovered the popularity of
MARTIN shirts. That being the case, the defendant must have been conscious of
the differences between the various registered marks bearing the word MARTIN.
The defendant applied to register the defendant’s mark as, with the addition
of the word EMPEROR, it purportedly created a distinctiveness when compared to
the other registered MARTIN marks. However after registration, the defendant
did not intend to use the defendant’s registered mark. Consequently, it was no
answer to the plaintiff’s complaint for the defendant (as Sanjay sought to do
in his affidavit) to contend there were twelve differences between the
plaintiff’s shirt bearing the plaintiff’s second mark and the defendant’s mark
when the defendant never intended to use the latter but opted to use the
defendant’s (unregistered) tailored mark on its shirts.

79 The defendant’s true intent was manifested in the shirt sample purchased by
the two investigators at [30] from the defendant’ shop. Neither Sanjay nor
Neeraj offered any explanation as to why the defendant’s tailored mark was
found on the sample shirt instead of the defendant’s mark. Further, no
explanation was proffered on why the defendant’s sample in [31] showed the
defendant’s mark on the collar and yet the hangtag and plastic packaging used
the defendant’s tailored mark.

80 The two investigators had purchased the sample shirt on 21 February 2008
while the hearing before this court was on 12 August 2009. The label on the
collar of the defendant’s sample (at [31] also differed from the defendant’s
mark at [24] in that the star had been shifted from the right side to the
centre and positioned above the words EMPEROR MARTIN. Why was there a
difference unless the defendant’s mark was of little or no significance to the
defendant? Could it be that the defendant changed the collar’s label
deliberately for this trial but omitted to replace the hangtag and packaging
for its shirt?

81 I had already noted at [39] that the invoices exhibited in Sanjay’s
affidavit raised more questions than answers. How did the defendant market its
shirts? As MARTIN shirts or as EMPEROR MARTIN shirts?

82 Neeraj had sought to explain in his affidavit that when he told the two
investigators that the defendant ‘duplicated’ the MARTIN brand, he meant
manufacturing a MARTIN shirt with its own distinctiveness. However, no
particulars were furnished on what were the alleged distinctive features in
the defendant’s shirt as compared with the MARTIN PACEMAKER shirts of the
plaintiff. The plain meaning of the word ‘duplicate’ in the English language
according to the Concise Oxford Dictionary is “exactly like something already
existing”—in other words copied. This was exactly what the defendant did; it
copied the plaintiff’s second mark.

83 I would add that there was also no evidence of the survey the two brothers
supposedly conducted in 2002 prior to launching the defendant’s own shirt. If
indeed the survey was conducted, then both brothers knew of the existence of
the plaintiff’s first and second marks. Further Neeraj had volunteered the
information to the two investigators that the plaintiff’s second mark had been
in the market for 15 years as against the defendant’s mark of 5-6 years. I
entertain little doubt that the affidavit of TCH accurately recorded his
conversation with Neeraj (summarised at [33]) and I am not prepared to accept
Neeraj’s _ex post facto_ explanation/rationalisation of the actual words he
used. Ignorance of the identity of the proprietor of a mark (as Sanjay
claimed) is irrelevant for a case based on bad faith.

84 The defendant had submitted that the six registered MARTIN marks of the
plaintiff were irrelevant on the issue of fraud as the date for considering
fraud was the date of the application of registration of the defendant’s mark
_ie_ May 2002. This argument was misconceived – the basis of the plaintiff’s
claim was that of first usage under common law (_DALIC Trade Mark_ supra
[58]). The first affidavit filed by Alvernia showed that the plaintiff’s usage
of the first and second marks in Singapore had commenced since 1982. That
cannot be disputed and indeed the defendant did not challenge Alvernia’s
affidavit in that regard. The defendant’s only criticism (in its submissions)
was that other than Singapore, there was no evidence from the plaintiff that
it sold MARTIN shirts worldwide. That criticism however is no answer to the
plaintiff’s claim of its usage and reputation in Singapore to which the Act
applies.

85 It also served little purpose for Sanjay to compare the plaintiff’s first
and second marks to other registered marks containing the word MARTIN and
argue that the latter were even more similar to the former than the
defendant’s mark. In any case as the plaintiff pointed out in its submissions,
the use or registration of trade marks which incorporate the MARTIN marks did
not give the defendant the licence to ride on the goodwill or reputation of
the MARTIN marks merely because others may have done so.

86 Similarity of marks is irrelevant when a mark is registered in bad faith.
It is also irrelevant to the issue of bad faith that the plaintiff chose not
to sue the defendant for passing-off. What is a relevant consideration is the
fact that when the defendant applied to register the defendant’s mark, Sanjay
or Neeraj made a false declaration in breach of s 5(2)(e)(ii) of the Act as
the defendant did not have a _bona fide_ intention of using the mark in the
form that was applied to be registered (per Hobbs QC in _Demon Ale Trade_
[2000] RPC 345 at p 356 which dealt with s 3(6) of the UK Trade Marks Act
1994).

87 The defendant’s submissions dealt at length with the issue of the
assignment of the first three registered marks in [15] to the plaintiff. Those
assigned marks are equally irrelevant to the plaintiff’s claim.

88 I turn next to the issue of bad faith. I am mindful of the caution
expressed in _Royal Enfield Trade Mark_ and in the _McDonald’s_ case that an
allegation of bad faith is a serious matter, it should not be lightly made, a
high standard of proof is required and the allegation should be distinctly
proved instead of being inferred from the facts. Of course there are
exceptions such as the _Rothmans’_ case where a strong inference of bad faith
could be and was made out.

89 Bearing in mind the test formulated by Lindsay LJ in _Gromax Plasticulture
v Don & Low Nonwovens_ that bad faith connotes dishonesty and dealings which
fell short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by
reasonable and experienced men, I conclude that the conduct of the defendant
(by the actions of Sanjay and Neeraj) also amounted to bad faith under s 7(6)
of the Act. The comments made in [74], [75], [78] and [79] would similarly
give rise to a strong inference of bad faith on the part of the defendant,
apart from the issue of fraud.

90 It is noteworthy that Sanjay and/or Neeraj made no attempt to offer any
explanation at all as to why the defendant chose to use the word MARTIN in the
defendant’s mark. Sanjay’s explanation for adopting the word EMPEROR as a
prefix was unbelievable in any case as the clear emphasis in the defendant’s
tailored mark was on the word MARTIN and not on the word EMPEROR. Further,
Sanjay did not elaborate on what he meant by marketing strategy in the
difference in font size used for the words EMPEROR and MARTIN nor why the word
MARTIN was so obviously highlighted. Instead, Sanjay (as well as the
defendant’s closing submissions) embarked on an unnecessary and irrelevant
criticism of the plaintiff’s omission and apparent undue delay in registering
the plaintiff’s first and second marks before June 2006. The defendant even
questioned the plaintiff’s wisdom of taking an assignment from TLS and Radha
had they succeeded in registering the plaintiff’s second and first marks
respectively when the issue is irrelevant to this case.

91 The law requires bad faith to be determined as at the date of the
application (see _Ferrero SpA’s Trade Marks_ [2004] RPC 29) (“ _Ferrero_ ’s
case”) which would be 20 May 2002 when the defendant filed its application.
However, _Ferrero_ ’s case is also authority for the proposition that bad
faith did not exclude from consideration matters which occurred after the date
of application; they may assist in determining the applicant’s state of mind
at the date of registration. That principle in _Ferrero_ ’s case was followed
in _Tesco Stores Ltd’s Trade Mark Applications_ [2005] RPC 17. Applying that
principle to our case, the defendant’s conduct subsequent to registration
showed that it did not intend to use the defendant’s mark.

92 Granted, MARTIN is an English name and not an invented word. According to
the Court of Appeal in _The Polo/Lauren Co LP v Shop-In Department Store Pte
Ltd_ [2006] 2 SLR 690, just like the word ‘polo”, the word MARTIN cannot claim
an inherent distinctiveness, unlike “Volvo” or “Rolex” or “Cartier”. I agree
that case-law decrees that where common words are included in a registered
mark, courts should be wary of granting a monopoly in their use. However, it
also bears remembering that a distinctiveness of a common English word like
MARTIN can be acquired through usage as the plaintiff had sought to establish
(on which they succeeded) in this case. The defendant’s conduct showed that it
exceeded the boundaries of normal and fair use of the word MARTIN (per Mr
Reynolds at p 841 in _Betty’s Kitchen Coronation Street Trade Mark_ (_supra_
[76]).

93 I find that there was an obvious and conscious effort on the part of the
defendant to copy the plaintiff’s second mark in the usage of the word MARTIN
and a deliberate preference to use the defendant’s (unregistered) tailored
mark instead of the defendant’s mark.

94 Clearly the defendant’s mark was never intended to be used by the defendant
in its registered form when it was filed. Consequently, I grant an order in
terms of prayer 1 of the Originating Summons (OS). The defendant’s mark under
Trade Mark registration number T0206327F in Class 25 is hereby declared
invalid pursuant to s 23(4) as well as s 23(1) read with s 7(6) of Act and
should be revoked by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore. Pursuant
to prayer 2 of the OS, the plaintiff is awarded costs on a standard basis to
be taxed unless otherwise agreed.
