**Judgment** _Cur Adv Vult_

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1 This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court, made on an
application for the determination of a question of law under O.14 r 12 of the
Rules of Court, where it was held that the respondents, as the confirming
bank, were entitled to refuse payment under an irrevocable letter of credit on
the ground that a material document tendered by the appellants was a forgery
and was null and void. **

The facts

**

2 The material facts leading to the action are straightforward and not in
dispute. The appellants, Beam Technology (Mfg) Pte Ltd (‘the sellers’), a
Singapore company, contracted to sell electronic components to an Indonesian
buyer, PT Mulia Persada Permai (‘the buyers’). As required under the sale
contract, the buyers obtained the issue by PT Bank Universal HO Jakarta of a
letter of credit (LC) for a sum of US$277,500 in favour of the sellers. The LC
was subject to the terms of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credit, 1993 Revision (‘UCP 500’). The respondents were the confirming bank of
the credit.

3 Under the terms of the LC, one of the documents required to be tendered to
draw on the credit was a "full set of clean air waybill …" The buyers notified
the sellers that the air waybill would be issued by their freight forwarders,
"Link Express (S) Pte Ltd".

4 On 14 July 2000, the sellers presented to the confirming bank the documents
required in order to draw under the LC. On 17 July 2000, the confirming bank
issued a notice of rejection informing the sellers that there were certain
discrepancies in the documents. The particulars of those discrepancies are
immaterial for the purposes of this appeal. Two days later, the confirming
bank further notified the sellers that the air waybill was issued by a non-
existing entity in that there was no company known as "Link Express(S) Pte
Ltd". Hereinafter we shall refer to this company as "Link Express". On the
evening of the same day, the confirming bank returned all the documents to the
sellers on the ground that the air waybill was a forgery. Subsequently, the
sellers sought to re-present the documents but the confirming bank refused to
accept any further presentation.

5 Following the sellers’ commencement of the action to claim for the payment
due under the LC, the confirming bank applied to court for a determination of
the following question of law:-

> "Whether the defendants as a confirming bank of the letter of credit No.
> 073001005900 was entitled not to make payment under the said letter of
> credit because an air waybill No. 618-63187228 purportedly issued by a
> freight forwarding company called Link Express (S) Pte Ltd, which was one of
> the documents required to be presented and was in fact presented by the
> plaintiffs under the letter of credit, was a forgery known to the
> defendants. Solely for the purpose of this application, it shall be assumed
> that the forgery was not carried out by the plaintiffs.

6 The High Court allowed the application and ruled that the confirming bank
was not obliged to pay and dismissed the action. Being dissatisfied with that
determination, the sellers have appealed to this court. Besides the
substantive issue, the sellers have also raised before us a procedural point,
i.e., whether the question posed is an appropriate one to be dealt with under
O 14 r 12(1).

**

Order 14 r 12(1)

**

7 The argument of the sellers on this issue is that the question posed to the
court is not suitable for a determination under O 14 r 12, as it will not
fully determine any issue of the action. The sellers’ contention is that the
confirming bank is not entitled, in the absence of fraud on the part of the
beneficiary, to look beyond the face of the documents tendered. What is
crucial is compliance on the face of the documents and not compliance in fact.
And even if this argument were to be unsustainable, the bank should comply
with Article 14 of UCP 500 and it had not so complied because it had not set
out in their notice of 17 July 2000, as required under Article 14(d)(ii), all
the discrepancies in respect of which the bank refused the documents. So even
if there was a third party fraud exception, the confirming bank was precluded
from claiming that the documents were not in compliance, having regard to
Article 14(e) (quoted below at 11).

8 It is clear that O 14 r 12(1) can be invoked to determine "any issue" in the
cause, without it also disposing of the entire cause: see _Payna Chettiar v
Maimoon bte Ismail_[1997] 3 SLR 387. The question which the court was asked to
determine in the present case would not require the calling of any witnesses,
as it was assumed that the air waybill was a forgery and the sellers had
obtained and tendered the documents to the confirming bank in all good faith.

9 The sellers seem to be saying that it was not enough merely to assert that
the air waybill was forged, the bank must also comply with the notice
requirements prescribed under Article 14(d)(ii). The question posed is also
flawed as it only focused on the fact of forgery but failed to take into
consideration the notice requirements prescribed in Article 14.

10 As we see it, the question posed raises the issue as to whether a
confirming bank can, independently of the grounds set out in Article 14
relating to discrepancies, refuse payment on the separate and distinct ground
that a material document tendered to draw on an LC is forged and of no effect.
Putting it another way, can a confirming bank, in a case where there is no
discrepancy in the documents tendered, nevertheless refuse payment because
they have reliably established that a material document is forged? Ordinarily
such a question, which would be decisive of the action, would be suitable for
determination under r 12(1). But for reasons which will become apparent when
we proceed to deal with the substantive question, we think that in the
circumstances of the present case, there ought to be a trial.

**

Relevant provisions

**

11 Turning now to the substantive issue, it is necessary that we should first
set out the relevant provisions of UCP 500 which governed the LC in question:-

> _
>
> Article 3a
>
> Credits, by their nature, are separate transactions from the sales or other
> contract(s) on which they may be based and banks are in no way concerned
> with or bound by such contract(s), even if any reference whatsoever to such
> contract(s) is included in the Credit
>
> _. Consequently, the undertaking of a bank to pay, accept and pay Draft(s)
> or negotiate and/or to fulfil any other obligation under the Credit, is not
> subject to claims or defences by the Applicant resulting from his
> relationships with the Issuing Bank or the Beneficiary.

> _

refuses the documents and must also state whether it is holding the documents
at the disposal of, or is returning them to, the presenter._

>>

>> iii. The Issuing Bank and/or Confirming Bank, if any, shall then be
entitled to claim from the remitting bank refund, with interest, of any
reimbursement which has been made to that bank.

> e. If the Issuing Bank and/or Confirming Bank, if any, _fails to act in

> _
>
> Article 15
>
> Banks assume no liability or responsibility for the form, sufficiency,
> accuracy, genuineness, falsification or legal effect of any document(s),
>
> _ or for the general and/or particular conditions stipulated in the
> document(s) or superimposed thereon; …." (Emphasis added).

12 It is clear from these provisions of the UCP 500 that the opening of a
confirmed LC imposes upon the banker an absolute obligation to pay,
irrespective of any dispute there may be between the parties as to whether the
goods are up to contract or not: see also _Hamzeh Malass & Sons v British Imex
Industries Ltd_ [1958] 2 QB 127 at 129.

13 The banker is only concerned with documents and what the credit requires
them to be, not with goods or the contract which requires them to be paid for.
If he does what he is told, he is safe; if he departs from the terms and
conditions of the credit, he acts at his own risk. He is not obliged to go
behind the documents and to consider whether the terms of the underlying
contract conforms to the terms of the LC or whether they have been or will be
performed: see Article 3a of UCP 500 and _Equitable Trust Co of New York v
Dawson & Partners Ltd _[1927] 27 Lloyd’s Rep 49.

14 Therefore, visual inspection of the actual documents presented is all that
is called for. Of course, the bank must examine them with reasonable care to
ascertain that they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms
and conditions of credit. A bank is under no duty to take further steps to
investigate the genuineness of a signature which, on the face of it, purports
to be the signature of the person named or described in the letter of credit:
see _Gian Singh & Co Ltd v Banque de l’Indochine _[1974] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1.

15 It is also settled law that where a confirming bank has paid on a credit in
the face of _prima facie_ compliant documents, the confirming bank, and in
turn the issuing bank, are entitled to claim reimbursement from the applicant.
This was unequivocally stated by Lord Diplock, delivering the opinion of the
Privy Council in _Gian Singh_(at 757), in these terms:-

> "The fact that a document presented by the beneficiary under a documentary
> credit, which otherwise conforms to the requirements of the credit, is in
> fact a forgery does not, of itself, prevent the issuing bank from recovering
> from its customer moneys paid under the credit. The duty of the issuing
> bank, which it may perform either by itself, or by its agent, the notifying
> bank, is to examine documents with reasonable care to ascertain that they
> appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of
> the credit. The express provision to this effect in article 7 (now art 15 of
> UCP 500) of the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits does no
> more than re-state the duty of the bank at common law."

16 However, nowhere in this statement was the Privy Council addressing the
situation where the confirming or issuing bank was aware, within the
prescribed seven day period and prior to any payment being effected, that a
material document tendered was a forgery and nullity. This was not an issue
that was before the court in _Gian Singh_. Therefore, the opinion expressed
therein, which on the face is broad, must be considered with care. Reasoning
by analogy is not always appropriate. As will be discussed shortly, the House
of Lords in a case in 1981 recognised that the issue was still open.

17 There is a dearth of authorities touching on this issue. It appears that
there are only two cases which expressly dealt with the point although the
facts there were not on all fours with the instant case. The first is _United
City Merchants (Investments) Ltd & Anor_ _v Royal Bank of Canada & Ors_ [1981]
1 Lloyd’s Rep 604, where the bills of lading falsely stated that the goods
were put on board the vessel on 15 December 1976 at London when in fact it was
a day later, on the 16 December, and also not at London but at Felixstowe. The
plaintiffs, the beneficiaries, were not aware of the falsehood. The question
was whether those bills of lading were a forgery or were they to be treated as
valid documents containing inaccuracies. In a sense each of the bills did tell
a lie about itself – that it was executed on December 15, when in fact it was
executed on December 16. It also contained two lies about its contents – the
date of shipment and the place of shipment.

18 At first instance, Mocatta J held that unless there was personal fraud or
unscrupulous conduct on the part of the seller plaintiffs, and there was none
there, the bank must pay against documents which were _prima facie_
conforming. His decision was reversed on appeal. Stephenson LJ, who delivered
the leading judgment, said, after reviewing the authorities, (at p. 623):-

> "But whether or not a forged document is a nullity, it is not a genuine or
> valid document entitling the presenter of it to be paid and if the banker to
> which it is presented under a letter of credit knows it to be forged he must
> not pay."

19 Lord Justice Ackner, the second member of the quorum, put the issues
presented in these terms (at p.628):-

> If the signature on the bill of lading had been forged, a fact of which the
> sellers were _ex hypothesi_ ignorant, but of which the bank was aware when
> the document was presented, I can see no valid basis upon which the bank
> would be entitled to take up the drafts and debit their customer. Mr Hirst
> was virtually obliged to accept this. A banker cannot be compelled to honour
> a credit unless all the conditions precedent have been performed, and he
> ought not to be under an obligation to accept or pay against documents which
> he knows to be waste paper. To hold otherwise would be to deprive the banker
> of that security for the advances, which is a cardinal feature of the
> process of financing carried out by means of the credit: see _Gutteridge and
> Megrah, The Law of Bankers Commercial Credits, 6 th ed_., at p. 142.

20 However, on further appeal, the decision of the Court of Appeal, holding
that the bank was not obliged to pay on the credit because the bills of lading
contained falsehoods, was overturned by the House of Lords. The House restored
the decision of Mocatta J. In coming to its decision, the House had regard to
the following significant features. The goods sold were ready for shipment in
the beginning of December 1976. It was intended that the goods would be
shipped on a vessel due to arrive at Felixstowe on 10 December 1976. All
parties had acquiesced to changing the loading port to Felixstowe instead of
London. However, the arrival of that vessel at Felixstowe was cancelled and
the loading brokers substituted it with another vessel scheduled to arrive
only on 16 December 1976, one day after the latest date of shipment prescribed
under the documentary credit. The goods were loaded on that day itself but the
loading brokers, acting as agents for the carrier, put the date 15 December
1976 on the bills of lading as if that day was the day on which the goods were
received on board. The brokers handed the bills to the sellers in return for
payment of the freight. On 17 December, the documents were presented to the
confirming bank for payment. Various points of objection relating to the bills
of lading were taken. The upshot of it all was that amended bills, together
with other documents, were re-presented to the bank on 22 December. The bank
refused to pay because it had obtained information "which suggested that the
shipment was not effected as it appeared in the bills of lading". The trial
judge found that an employee of the loading brokers deliberately made a false
entry as to the date of shipment.

21 Lord Diplock, having noted that there was no direct authority on point,
whether in the United Kingdom or the United States, went on to state that the
issue had to be decided on first principles. He said that in such a nature of
international trade, there were four separate but yet interconnected
transactions: (i) the contract of sale and purchase; (ii) the contract between
the buyer and the issuing bank; (iii) the arrangement between the issuing bank
and the confirming bank and (iv) the contract between the confirming bank and
the seller. The case only concerned the fourth contract.

22 Lord Diplock observed that the object of this system of confirmed
irrevocable documentary credit was to give to the seller an assured right to
be paid before he parted with control of the goods and that "does not permit
of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale
being used on a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment."
However, he also said that the one established exception to the general
statement of principle as to the contractual obligations of the confirming
bank to the seller was where the seller "fraudulently presents to the
confirming bank documents that contain, expressly or by implication, material
representations of fact that to his knowledge are untrue …" The rationale for
the exception was the principle "fraud unravels all".

23 Lord Diplock further amplified that the contractual duty between the
confirming bank and the issuing bank, and as between the issuing bank and the
buyer under the credit, was "to examine with reasonable care all documents
presented in order to ascertain that they appear on their face to be in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit" and if they so
appeared, to pay on it. He referred to Article 7 of the then UCP (now Article
15 of UCP 500) which provided that neither the confirming bank nor the issuing
bank assumed any liability or responsibility to one another or to the buyer
"for the form, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness, falsification or legal
effect of any documents."

24 His Lordship also noted that there was a distinction between a document
which was a nullity and that which only contained some inaccuracies. In
respect of the former situation, his Lordship left the question open:-

> "I would prefer to leave open the question of the rights of an innocent
> seller/beneficiary against the confirming bank when a document presented by
> him is a nullity because unknown to him it was forged by some third party."

25 But in so far as the inaccuracy as to the date of shipment on the bills of
lading was concerned, Lord Diplock was of the view that the bills were far
from being a nullity. He said:-

> "It was a valid transferable receipt for the goods giving the holder a right
> to claim them at their destination, Callao, and was evidence of the terms of
> the contract under which they were being carried."

Thus the House allowed the appeal on the ground that the bills of lading were
not null and void but only that they contained inaccuracies.

26 The question left open in _United City Merchants_ came up for consideration
in _Montrod Ltd v Grundkotter Fleischvertriebs GmbH_ [2001] 1 All ER (Comm)
368. There, the credit required the presentation of inspection certificates
signed by the applicant for the credit, who had provided finance to the buyer
of the goods. The buyer informed the seller, the beneficiary under the credit,
that one of its employees should sign the inspection certificates on behalf of
the applicant. The seller, honestly thinking that it had the applicant’s
authority, signed the certificates on behalf of the applicant, and presented
them for payment. In accordance with the terms of the credit, payment was to
be effected 45 days after presentation of the documents. Before the expiry of
the 45 day period, it became apparent that the applicant had not given any
authority to the seller to sign the certificates. The bank nevertheless paid
on it.

27 It was argued that the certificates were a nullity and as the bank knew of
it before payment, the bank should not have paid the seller. At first
instance, the Deputy High Court Judge (Deputy Judge) held that the seller did
not act fraudulently when its representative signed the certificates and that
the seller was entitled to payment. The issuing bank was, in turn, entitled to
reimbursement from the applicant. The Deputy Judge was of the view that the
banks need only consider the documents alone and should not take into account
other matters. He felt that the fraud exception should be restricted to a case
where there was fraud or knowledge of fraud on the part of the beneficiary or
other party seeking payment. He concluded by stating that -

> "the nullity exception should and does form no part of English law. It is
> unsupported by authority. It provides a further complication where
> simplicity and clarity are needed. There are problems in defining when a
> document is a nullity."

28 On appeal, Montrod argued that besides fraud on the part of the
beneficiary, there should still, in law, be room for a nullity exception where
a document tendered was worthless, which was really a natural extension of the
fraud exception. The fraud exception allowed the court to intervene to prevent
the perpetration of fraud on the part of the beneficiary or other presenting
party. It was contended that surely the court should also intervene where the
document presented was a nullity even though the beneficiary did not know it.
However, Potter LJ, who delivered the sole judgment of the court, rejected the
suggestion of a nullity exception. He said (at p. 273):-

> "The fraud exception to the autonomy principle recognised in English law has
> hitherto been restricted to, and it is in my view desirable that it should
> remain based upon, the fraud or knowledge of fraud on the part of the
> beneficiary or other party seeking payment under and in accordance with the
> terms of the letter of credit. It should not be avoided or extended by the
> argument that a document presented, which conforms on its face with the
> terms of the letter of the credit, is none the less of a character which
> disentitles the person making the demand to payment because it is fraudulent
> _in_ _itself,_ independently of the knowledge and bona fides of the
> demanding party. In my view, that is the clear import of Lord Diplock’s
> observations in _Gian Singh_ and in the _United City Merchants_ case, in
> which all their Lordships concurred. As I understand it, Lord Diplock was of
> the view that a seller/beneficiary who was ignorant of forgery by a third
> party of one of the documents presented, or of the fact that the document
> contained a representation false to the knowledge of the person who created
> it, should not be in a worse position than someone who has taken a draft
> drawn under a letter of credit in circumstances which rendered him a holder
> in due course. While he left open the position in relation to a forged
> document where the effect of the forgery was to render the document a
> ‘nullity’, _there is nothing to suggest that he would have recognised any
> nullity exception as extending to a document which was not forged (i.e.,
> fraudulently produced) but was signed by the creator in honest error as to
> his authority, nor do I consider that such an exception should be
> recognised._

> That being so, I do not consider that the fact that in this case it was the
> seller/beneficiary himself who created the document said to be a nullity
> should _of itself_ disentitle him to payment, assuming (as the judge found)
> that such creation was devoid of any fraudulent intent and was effected in
> the belief that GK enjoyed the authority of Montrod, as applicant for the
> credit, to sign and issue the certificate. Although the circumstances were
> highly unusual, they may none the less be regarded as no more than an
> illustration of the wide variety of circumstances in which documents come
> into existence in a commercial context which do not necessarily reflect the
> factual situation but which parties may none the less employ as a convenient

> multipartite transaction, a seller/beneficiary is indeed led to believe that
> he has authority to create and present a certificate of inspection for the
> purpose of triggering payment by letter of credit, I do not see why he
> should be regarded as any less entitled to payment in accordance with UCP
> 500 than in a case where he receives from a third party a document regular
> on its face which has, unknown to him, been created without authority."
> (Emphasis added).

29 Potter LJ also thought that as a matter of policy, the UCP 500, which
embodied the international banking practice, should be interpreted and applied
to ensure certainty and precision. He felt that if the court were to create a
general nullity exception, the formulation of which was insusceptible of
precision, that would involve making undesirable inroads into the principles
of autonomy and negotiability universally recognised in relation to letters of
credit transactions.

30 At this juncture we should refer to a local first instance case, _Mees
Pierson N Bay Pacific (S) Pte Ltd & Ors _[2000] 4 SLR 393, where one of the
documents required for presentation to the confirming bank, a health
certificate, was a forgery. At the time of presentation, neither the seller
nor the confirming bank had knowledge of the forgery. The confirming bank
accepted the documents and paid the sums under the credit. When it
subsequently discovered the forgery, it sought to recover the sum from the
seller. Rajendran J dismissed the bank’s claim on the basis that the bank had
already accepted the documents and made payment under the credit. Further, it
had also failed to give the necessary notice of rejection within the period
stipulated under article 14(d) of the UCP 500. Rajendran J, however,
expressed, _obiter_ , the following opinion at 40 of the judgment:-

> When a confirming bank makes a payment out under a commercial credit, the
> bank holds the documents as security for the payment. However, if the bills
> of lading are forged and therefore a nullity, the bank would not have any
> security. _To require the bank to make payment when the bank knows that the
> bills of lading are a nullity is to require the bank to knowingly forgo its
> security. That would be tantamount to requiring the bank to honour the
> credit on terms less favourable to the bank than that envisaged under the
> credit arrangement_. (Emphasis added).

Rajendran J would appear to have accepted the reasoning expounded by Ackner LJ
in _United City Merchants_.

**

Our views

**

31 In summary, the current position of the law would appear to be this. The
House of Lords in _United City Merchants_ had left open the question whether
there is a nullity exception although at the Court of Appeal all the three
members of the quorum thought there was. In _Montrod_ the Court of Appeal (of
a different quorum) was inclined to the view that, apart from the traditional
fraud exception (i.e., fraud or knowledge of fraud on the part of the
beneficiary or other party seeking payment), there was no separate nullity
exception. In any case, even if there was such a nullity exception, it held
that the certificate issued by the seller in _Montrod_ in honest belief that
he had the authority of the applicant of the LC could not be a nullity.
Perhaps another way of differentiating _Montrod_ from the present case is that
there the certificate required was not an essential document but one touching
on the question as to the quality of the goods sold. In short, there is no
definite authority on point, although the views of the Court of Appeal in
_United City Merchants_ are no doubt highly persuasive.

32 It seems to us that the issue must be approached on first principles. It is
clear that the obligation of the issuing/confirming bank towards the
beneficiary is independent and separate from the contractual obligations
between the seller and the buyer, and the obligation to pay is absolute
irrespective of any dispute that may arise between the seller and the buyer.
As far as the confirming or negotiating bank is concerned, their duty is only
to verify whether what appears on the documents conforms with what is required
by the credit. If there is _prima facie_ compliance, the bank is authorised to
pay and may claim reimbursement from the issuing bank notwithstanding that a
document tendered may subsequently turn out to be a forgery: _Gian Singh_.
This is to protect the bank and to ensure the smooth flow of international
trade and the avoidance of delay. But we are unable to see why such a rule
should also lead to the result that if the confirming or negotiating bank,
from whatever source, is able to establish within the prescribed seven day
limit that a material document tendered is a forgery, being null and void, the
bank is nevertheless obliged to pay.

33 While the underlying principle is that the negotiating/confirming bank need
not investigate the documents tendered, it is altogether a different
proposition to say that the bank should ignore what is clearly a null and void
document and proceed nevertheless to pay. Implicit in the requirement of a
conforming document is the assumption that the document is true and genuine
although under the UCP 500 and common law, and in the interest of
international trade, the bank is not required to look beyond what appears on
the surface of the documents. But to say that a bank, in the face of a forged
null and void document (even though the beneficiary is not privy to that
forgery), must still pay on the credit, defies reason and good sense. It
amounts to saying that the scheme of things under the UCP 500 is only
concerned with commas and full stops or some misdescriptions, and that the
question as to the genuineness or otherwise of a material document, which was
the cause for the issue of the LC, is of no consequence.

34 As the judge below observed, UCP 500 does not provide that a bank is
obliged to accept a document which is a nullity notwithstanding that the time
prescribed under Article 14 for the bank to reject the document has not
expired. Thus the nullity exception which we postulate is a limited one and
would not have given rise to the sort of problems which Potter LJ had
expressed concern:-

> "If a general nullity exception were to be introduced as part of English law
> it would place banks in a further dilemma as to the necessity to investigate
> facts which they are not competent to do and from which UCP 500 is plainly
> concerned to exempt them."

We are not in any way suggesting that the bank is obliged to investigate into
any document tendered. The nullity exception would only permit a bank to
refuse payment if it is satisfied that a material document is a nullity.

35 Here, we would like to refer to the following comments of Professor R M
Goode in an article in Centre Point entitled _"Reflections on Letters of
Credit –1",_ where he, in discussing __ the position of the _bona fide_
plaintiff, said:-

> "Is a plaintiff who seeks to enforce a letter of credit affected by forgery
> of the documents or other fraud in the transaction if he himself acted in
> good faith? There is a remarkable dearth of authority on this question. Let
> us start with the beneficiary. He himself has a duty to tender documents
> which are in order, and the fact that he acted in good faith in tendering
> forged documents is thus irrelevant. This fundamental point appears to have
> been overlooked by Mr Justice Mocatta in The American Accord when he held
> that the beneficiary was entitled to collect payment despite the insertion
> of a fraudulent shipping date on the bill of lading, since the fraud had
> been committed by the loading broker who was the agent of the carrier, not
> of the seller/beneficiary. But this, with respect, is not to the point. The
> beneficiary under a credit is not like a holder in due course of a bill of
> exchange; he is only entitled to be paid if the documents are in order. A
> fraudulently completed bill of lading does not become a conforming document
> merely because the fraud is that of a third party."

36 It is our opinion that the negotiating/confirming bank is not obliged to
pay if it has established within the seven day period that a material document
required under the credit is forged and null and void and notice of it is
given within that period. While we recognise that there could be difficulties
in determining under what circumstances a document would be considered
material or a nullity, such a question can only be answered on the facts of
each case. One cannot generalise. It is not possible to define when is a
document a nullity. But it is really not that much more difficult to answer
such questions than to determine what is reasonable, an exercise which the
courts are all too familiar with.

Judgment

**

37 However there is one fact in this case which troubles us and which, in our
view, merits further consideration and it is this. The buyers nominated "Link
Express (S) Pte Ltd" as the freight forwarder to whom the sellers should
consign the goods. Presumably the buyers would have given the sellers the name
of the contact person at "Link Express" as well as the latter’s telephone
number. The sellers would have contacted the person at "Link Express" to air-
freight the goods to the buyers. An air waybill was accordingly issued by
"Link Express" for the consignment. Could the air waybill so issued by "Link
Express" be considered to be a forgery, as being issued by a non-existent
entity, when it was the very entity which the buyer had nominated the seller
to deal with? Indeed, one could say that the very document asked for by the
buyers was tendered. Could it, therefore, still be considered to be non-
compliant or a forgery? These are serious issues which must be answered
because they could be determinative of the action. The question posed to the
court, pursuant to O 14 r 12 (as set out in 5 above), simply assumed that the
document was a forgery and nullity.

38 Accordingly, in our judgment, the questions whether the air waybill
constituted forgery and is null and void and whether it amounted to non-
compliance with the credit terms, warrant, in the circumstances of the present
case, further exploration.

39 In the result, we would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment in
favour of the respondents, the confirming bank. The appellants (the sellers)
shall have the costs of this appeal, and the security deposit, together with
any accrued interest, shall be refunded to the appellants’ solicitors. The
costs of the hearing below shall be in the cause.
