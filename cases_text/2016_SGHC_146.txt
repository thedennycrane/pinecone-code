High Court — District Court Suit No 1680 of 2009 (HC/Registrar’s Appeal from
the State Court No 12 of 2016)  
Choo Han Teck J  
18 July 2016

26 July 2016 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff was riding a motorcycle on 19 June 2006 when he met with an
accident with a pickup driven by the defendant (“the 1st accident”). He sued
the defendant on 13 May 2009. Liability was adjudged in the proportion of 90%
in favour of the plaintiff. The defendant’s appeal to the High Court was
dismissed on 6 October 2011.

2 In the interim, the plaintiff met a second accident riding the same
motorcycle on 12 November 2007 (“the 2nd accident”). He sued on 30 June 2010
and obtained a consent order for 75% liability in his favour.

3 The assessments of damages in respect of both accidents were fixed for
hearing on 7 August 2014 before the same deputy registrar. That was an
eminently sensible procedure because two main witnesses in both assessments
were the plaintiff and Dr Tan Mak Yong (“Dr Tan”), who examined the plaintiff
in respect of both accidents.

4 The plaintiff subsequently settled his claim against the defendant in the
2nd accident and obtained an order by consent for the global sum of $30,000
inclusive of $5,000 for special damages and $25,000 for general damages. The
deputy registrar then proceeded to assess damages in respect of the 1st
accident and made the following award on 6 July 2015. The deputy registrar
awarded $72,000 for general damages and $15,515.35 for special damages making
a total award of $87,515.35. Both parties appealed to the district judge (“the
DJ”) who heard the appeals and handed down his decision on 18 March 2016. The
DJ reversed the award to $95,000 and $19,355.35 respectively, making the
overall award $114,355.35. The details were helpfully set out by the DJ in a
table which I now reproduce:

5 The plaintiff suffered the following injuries –

(a) A fracture of the right wrist;

(b) A bruising injury to the left chest wall;

(c) A bruising injury to the left elbow;

(d) Neck strain;

(e) A fracture of the right transverse process (lower back) and

(f) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

The total damages for the overall pain and suffering awarded by the DJ was
$50,000. The defendant appeals against (a), (b), (d) and (e). He is also
appealing against the awards for future medical expenses ($5,000) and loss of
earning capacity ($40,000). The plaintiff completed Secondary 4 schooling but
did not obtain an “O” level certificate. Thereafter he worked as a technician.
The evidence as to the plaintiff’s salary at the time of the 1st accident was,
as the DJ noted, not very clear but the deputy registrar and the DJ accepted
that the plaintiff was earning $2,200. Before me, Mr Ramesh Appoo (“Mr
Appoo”), counsel for the defendant, argued that the plaintiff was then only
earning $1,800 but with overtime pay it was $2,100.

6 The plaintiff was unable to work for a while but he has been working as a
chauffeur since September 2007. He worked, first at the St. Regis Singapore
and then at Resorts World Sentosa (“RWS”). In January 2013, he left RWS to
work as a chauffeur for Overseas Union Enterprise Limited (“OUE”), earning
$2,500 a month. He is still with OUE at the time of this appeal.

7 The evidence relating to future medical expenses came mainly from Dr Tan.
The plaintiff was examined by Dr Tan in respect of both accidents for the
purposes of preparing a medical report to be used for the assessment of
damages. Strangely, Dr Tan examined the plaintiff in respect of the 1st
accident on 8 April 2013 but examined the plaintiff in respect of the 2nd
accident two days earlier on 6 April 2013. His medical report in respect of
the 1st accident is dated 22 May 2013 and his medical report in respect of the
2nd accident is dated 12 June 2013. Although in his report on the 2nd accident
he mentioned that the plaintiff had sustained injuries in the 1st accident, he
made no mention of the 2nd accident in his report on 1st accident. In both
reports he mentioned that the plaintiff had previous surgery to his spine in
1991.

8 The omission of any reference to the 2nd accident in Dr Tan’s report in
respect of the 1st accident may be justified from a logical point if we
consider that at the time of the 1st accident, the second had not taken place.
But this report was not prepared as a sequential account of the plaintiff’s
accident. It was prepared for the purposes of ascertaining the amount of
compensation to be paid to him. The defendant in the 1st accident should not
pay for any loss or injury that should be attributed to the defendant in the
2nd accident, and vice versa. Neither common sense nor the law allows a
plaintiff to make a double claim.

9 Yet, the way the two medical reports were written, could have given the
court the impression that none of the plaintiff’s injuries could or should be
attributed to the 2nd accident because there is nothing in the first medical
report that indicates that there was a second accident.

10 More crucially, 11 items in Dr Tan’s report in respect of the 1st accident
were word-for-word identical to his report in respect of the 2nd accident. I
set out below the relevant parts from Dr Tan’s report on the 1st accident.
Sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (i), (j), (k), (n), (p) and (w) are
identical to his report in respect of the 2nd accident –

a) He still complained of anterior chest pain with exertion and when carrying
heavy loads. There was no exertional breathlessness mentioned.

b) He still experienced recurrent episodes of pain with stiffness over his
neck, especially with exertion, after prolonged sitting and standing, when
carrying heavy load (about 10 kilogram) as well as during cold, rainy seasons.
There was no radicular pain or numbness down his upper limbs felt.

c) Frequent lower back pain with back stiffness was experienced, worsened with
exertion, whilst carrying heavy load (about 10 kilogram), following prolonged
sitting and standing (about thirty minutes), after excessive walking as well
as during cold, wet conditions. Left lower limb numbness was felt. There was
no sciatica associated.

d) He still complained of right wrist pain, associated with wrist stiffness,
especially with exertion, when carrying heavy load (about 5 kilogram) and
during cold, wet weather. He also experienced relative loss of right upper
limb strength after the bony injury.

g) Clinical examination of lumbar spine revealed a mid-line scar (from
previous discectomy) and paraspinal muscular spasm. The range of lower back
motions was limited (extension, flexion, lateral flexions and lateral
rotations were two-third that of the normal range).

i) Clinical examination of right wrist revealed slight tenderness over dorsal
aspect of distal radius and inferior radioulnar joint. No gross deformity or
crepitation was detected over right wrist region.

j) Limitation of right wrist and forearm motions was observed:-

Wrist:-| | Right| Left  
---|---|---|---  
| Dorsiflexion| 50°| 75°  
| Palmar Flexion| 40°| 60°  
| Ulnar Deviation| 20°| 40°  
| Radial Deviation| 10°| 25°  
Forearm:-| | Right| Left  
| Supination| 80°| 90°  
| Pronation| 65°| 80°  
  
k) Mid wasting of right forearm muscles (28.5cm circumference compared with
29.0cm for that of the left forearm muscultatures) was demonstrated.

n) Chest radiographs, done on 4 May 2013, did not show any fracture of sternum
or ribs. No active lung lesion was seen.

p) Radiographs of cervical spine, carried out on 4 May 2013, revealed loss of
usual cervical lordosis. Osteophytic lipping with reduced intervertebral disc
space at C6/7 level was detected. Bilateral C6/7 uncovertebral facet
degeneration was seen. No bony injury or spondylolisthesis was observed.

w) Radiographs of right wrist, performed on 4 May 2013, revealed subchondral
sclerosis with decreased joint space, in keeping with joint degeneration, over
radiocarpal joint. Osteophytic lipping (sign of degenerative change) was seen
at right distal radioulnar joint. No acute fracture or dislocation was
observed.

11 Dr Tan made no comparison or co-relation between the two accounts in spite
of the fact that he made 11 identical findings of the plaintiff’s injuries. Mr
Appoo submitted that Dr Tan admitted under cross examination that he was
unable to say which of those injuries arose from the 1st and the 2nd accident.
That the injuries overlap is obvious from the fact that Dr Tan noted 11
identical injuries in his two reports. However, Dr Tan’s inability to
differentiate the injuries is a serious problem for the plaintiff and the
court because there is no evidence to help the court determine the nature,
cause and extent of the overlapping injuries. This is particularly important
when the question of the long term implication of the injuries and the
appropriate award to be granted for them is concerned.

12 The DJ awarded the plaintiff a sum of $40,000 for loss of earning capacity.
An award for the loss of earning capacity (in the context where the plaintiff
is currently employed) can only be awarded if there is a substantial or real
risk that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before
the estimated end of his or her working life and that the plaintiff will,
because of the injuries be at a disadvantage in the open job market (see Chai
Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian [2010] 3 SLR 587 (“Chai Kang Wei Samuel”)
at [36] and Teo Sing Keng and another v Sim Ban Kiat [1994] 1 SLR(R) 340 at
[40]). This inquiry is not a speculative one because the assessment is based
on reasonable expectations. The first problem here is that the plaintiff has
not adduced evidence as to the extent, if any, that this defendant is
responsible for any loss of earning capacity.

13 The other problem for the plaintiff is that instead of showing evidence
that may justify an award for loss of earning capacity, his evidence shows
that he is in fact earning more. Mr Perumal Athitham (“Mr Perumal”), counsel
for the plaintiff argued that it is well-known that there is a great demand
for technicians and that the job prospects of a technician are very much
better than that of a driver. All this was based on the unsubstantiated claims
of the plaintiff and Mr Perumal. The only justification for awarding something
by way of loss of earning capacity is to show that his pay as a technician
would have increased beyond the $2,500 he is receiving presently as a driver.
There is no such evidence. Mr Perumal submitted that the ‘sum of $40,000
awarded [for loss of earning capacity] (having not given something for loss of
future earnings) appears to be an appropriate sum’. This is based on the
expectation that an injured plaintiff must always be given something either
for a loss of future earnings or for a loss of earning capacity. This is
wrong. If the evidence shows that the plaintiff is unlikely to incur either,
then nothing should be given (see Chai Kang Wei Samuel at [19] to [22]). I
will therefore allow the defendant’s appeal on this item.

14 The DJ increased the amount of $5,000 awarded by the deputy registrar to
the plaintiff for the “undisplaced right distal fracture” to $10,000. The
original award by the deputy registrar was explained by the medical evidence
that the fracture did not require surgery. The increase by the DJ was based on
the assumption that there were subsequent degenerative changes that were
caused by the 1st accident. The evidence adduced by the plaintiff does not
support this assumption in the light of Dr Tan’s admission that he could not
attribute the degenerative changes to any particular accident. I think that Mr
Appoo and the deputy registrar were right that the burden of proof had not
been discharged by the plaintiff, and the sum of $5,000 ordered by the deputy
registrar should be reinstated.

15 It is not disputed that the plaintiff has been having a variety of back and
spinal problems for more than 20 years and had surgery done in 1991. Mr Appoo
submitted that there is no evidence of any exacerbation of the L4/L5
anterolisthesis that can be attributed to the 1st accident. Furthermore, this
is one injury which, in time, may have been caused or contributed by the 2nd
accident. I accept Mr Appoo’s submission and allow the defendant’s appeal in
respect of this item by reducing the award from $12,000 (for both the neck
strain and the exacerbation of the L4/L5) to $3,000. The reason for this is
that I accept that there may still be some form of muscular strain to the neck
or back as a result of the 1st accident.

16 Mr Appoo also submitted that there is no evidence of the hematoma on the
plaintiff’s chest or the one on his elbow, for which the DJ awarded $2,000
each. It is not clear but it seems that the DJ awarded $2,000 not just for the
hematoma on the chest; it is also for the tenderness in the chest. I agree
with Mr Appoo that the award for hematomas is usually $1,000 but I would not
disturb the award in this case to allow a degree of latitude in the DJ’s
discretion. So, although $1,000 is a good guide, in the overall context, a
court may go below and above that figure provided it is not an excessive
variation as the DJ did in this case.

17 Mr Appoo submitted that there was no evidence to support the award of
$18,000 for the fracture of the transverse process. I do not think that the DJ
was wrong in accepting that the fractures of the transverse process were
caused by the 1st accident. The radiology report three days after the 1st
accident seems to cover this injury. It was for Mr Appoo to challenge the
evidence, but, as the DJ noted, it was not put to the doctors that the
fractures can be attributed to some pre-existing condition. Although the
amount of $18,000 appears slightly high, I will not disturb it.

18 For the reasons above, I reduce the general damages by $54,000. The deputy
registrar’s award for the pain caused by the right wrist injury is reinstated,
the award for neck strain is varied and the award for the plaintiff’s loss of
earning capacity is struck out.

S/No| Item| Award by Deputy Registrar #($)| Award on appeal to District
Judge#($)| Award varied by High Court Judge($)  
---|---|---|---|---  
| General Damages |   
| Pain & Suffering  
1| Right wrist injury| 5,000| 10,000| 5,000  
2a| Tender left chest wall| 1,000| 2,000| 2,000

19 I will hear the question of costs at a later date.
