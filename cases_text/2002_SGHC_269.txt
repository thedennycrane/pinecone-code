**Judgment** _Cur Adv Vult_

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The defendants P.D. International Pte Ltd ("PDI") had a number of
subsidiary companies in Singapore. Amongst these were P.D. Manufacturing
International Pte Ltd ("PDMI") and Manufacture Element Prefabricate Pte Ltd
("MEP").

2\. In 1995, the plaintiffs Industrial & Commercial Bank Ltd (ICB") provided
various credit facilities to PDMI. The PDMI facilities were secured by a
corporate guarantee issued by PDI dated 12 September 1996 ("the PDMI
guarantee").

3\. In October 1996, ICB approved a revolving credit facility of $10 million
(later raised to $12 million) to MEP ("the MEP facilities"). The MEP
facilities were secured by a corporate guarantee given by PDI as well as by
the deposit of shares in Ace Dynamics Ltd ("ADL") – a public-listed company –
on an approved advance margin of 66.6% of the market value of those shares.

4\. Soon thereafter the market value of ADL shares began to decline. In order
to remain within the margin limit, MEP in late 1997 deposited a sum of $1.5
million to reduce its outstandings. The market price of ADL, however,
continued to slide. To avoid the sale of the ADL shares by ICB arrangements
were made – pursuant to various discussions between Jean Cheang ("Cheang") of
ICB and Poh Ah Tee ("Poh") and Ms Yap Ming Choo ("Yap"), the Managing Director
and the Group Financial Controller respectively of PDI – for PDI to deposit
shares in another listed company, namely, Twinwood Engineering Ltd
("Twinwood"), with ICB.

5\. Upon agreement being reached, ICB sent the standard Security Memorandum
form of ICB to PDI for execution. ICB also required that the Board of PDI
authorise the execution of the Security Memorandum in the following format:

> "Resolved that authority be and hereby given to any director to sign on
> behalf of [PDI] the Security Memorandum for the deposit of 25,763,016 of its
> shares in the capital of [Twinwood] with [ICB] for the facilities extended
> by [ICB] to its wholly owned subsidiary [MEP]."

> That resolution was signed on 17 December 1997. On the same day, the
> Security Memorandum was executed on behalf of PDI by Chua Sok Khim ("Chua"),
> a director of PDI. It was the evidence of Chua that she had been told by Poh
> and Yap that the deposit of the Twinwood shares were to secure the MEP
> account. That was also what the Board resolution of PDI stated. She
> testified that had she known that under the terms of the Security Memorandum
> the Twinwood shares would also be security for PDI’s other liabilities to
> ICB, she would not have signed.

6\. The Security Memorandum and the Board resolution together with the
Twinwood shares were thereafter sent to ICB. Subsequently, in July 1998, PDI
deposited a further 4,896,984 Twinwood shares with ICB, making a total of
30,660,000 shares. This further deposit was, as required by ICB, authorised by
the Board of PDI in a resolution couched in language similar to that of the
resolution of 17 December 1997, ie as security "for the facilities extended by
ICB to MEP".

7\. PDI’s only other liability to ICB at that time was in respect of the PDMI
account under the PDMI guarantee. The PDMI account was not in default when the
Security Memorandum relating to the Twinwood shares was signed. It, however,
went into default sometime thereafter (in September 1998) and continued to
remain in default.

8\. PDI itself, by July 1998, faced financial difficulties and M/s Arthur
Andersen were appointed special consultants to PDI. M/s Arthur Andersen were
replaced as special consultants by KPMG Consulting Pte Ltd ("KPMG") in
December 1998.

9\. On 12 March 1999, ICB sold the ADL shares that it was holding as security
for the MEP account. The market price of ADL had by then improved and the
proceeds were sufficient to fully discharge MEP’s liabilities to ICB. The same
day ICB re-called the PDMI facilities and demanded payment of the sum of
$1,374,867.15 from PDMI as well as from PDI under the PDMI guarantee. In the
said demand, ICB informed PDI that ICB would exercise its rights under the
Security Memorandum should the demand not be met. This was a reference to the
Security Memorandum executed when the Twinwood shares were deposited with ICB
by PDI to secure the MEP account.

10\. At a meeting between ICB, PDI and KPMG, held soon after (ie on 18 March
1999), the demand made by ICB was discussed. The minutes of this meeting
stated the position of PDI on the demand to be as follows:

> "The management of the Company are of the firm view that the Twinwood shares
> were deposited by ICB for the loan taken by MEP and not for PDMI."

And Mr Peter Chee of KPMG is minuted as having stated:

> "based on the understanding from the company, the Twinwood shares were
> deposited with ICB to cover the shortfall on ADL shares. It was never the
> intention of PDI to give ICB security over the amount owing by PDMI."

PDI, by its solicitors’ letter of 18 April 2000, challenged ICB’s rights to
the Twinwood shares in settlement of the PDMI debt. As the MEP facilities – to
secure which the Twinwood shares had been deposited – had been discharged, the
solicitors formally demanded that the Twinwood shares be returned to PDI.

11\. In view of the challenge raised, ICB by way of these proceedings, sought
a declaration that:

> (a) the 30,660,000 Twinwood shares deposited with ICB by PDI stands as
> security for PDI’s liability to ICB under the PDMI’s guarantee dated 12
> September 1996 in respect of the credit facilities furnished by ICB to PDMI;
> and
>
> (b) ICB is entitled to enforce the said security pursuant to the terms of
> the Security Memorandum dated 17 December 1997 and to sell or otherwise
> dispose of the Twinwood shares in satisfaction of PDI’s liabilities under
> the PDMI guarantee.

In support, ICB relied principally on the terms of the Security Memorandum.
The Security Memorandum was a closely printed documented – as standard form
documents are wont to be – and consisted of some eight pages.

12\. The relevant clauses in the Security Memorandum stipulated:

> _**
>
> Clause 1.1
>
> **_.
>
> "Secured Obligations" means all obligations, indebtedness and liabilities of
> every kind due or owing or incurred by the _Borrower and/or the Mortgagor_
> to the Bank and at any time (whether any such obligation, indebtedness or
> liability shall be that of the Borrower and/or the Mortgagor solely or
> jointly with any other person(s)) whether in Singapore or elsewhere and
> including:

> (a) all present or future obligations, indebtedness and liabilities of the
> _Borrower and/or the Mortgagor_ to the Bank on any current, advance, loan or
> other account whatsoever;
>
> (b) all obligations, indebtedness and liabilities in respect of notes or
> bills discounted or paid or bills accepted for or at the request of the
> _Borrower and/or the Mortgagor_ or other loans credits or advances or other
> Banking Facilities made to or for the accommodation or at the request of the
> Borrower and/or the Mortgagor;
>
> (c) all other obligations, indebtedness and liabilities whatsoever of the
> _Borrower and/or the Mortgagor_ to the Bank, present or future, actual or
> contingent, secured or unsecured (including obligations, indebtedness and
> liabilities as principal or surety or guarantor);"

> …
>
> _**
>
> Clause 8.1
>
> **_.
>
> "If the _Borrower and/or the Mortgagor_ (subject to the proviso to Clause
> 2.1) shall fail to pay or otherwise discharge when due or upon demand the
> _Secured Obligations_ or any part thereof or any sums of money payable under
> this Memorandum or any other agreement with the Bank and/or upon the
> occurrence of any one or more other Event of Default, then the Secured
> Obligations shall (if not already due) thereupon become due and the Bank
> and/or the Bank’s nominees shall be entitled, then or at any time thereafter
> and without prior notice to the Mortgagor, to sell or otherwise dispose and
> instruct any person(s) to sell or otherwise dispose of all the title,
> rights, benefits to and interest in the Mortgaged Security at such price for
> cash or other consideration (which may comprise or include Securities), and
> be payable immediately or by instalments and upon such terms and generally
> in such manner as the Bank may, in its discretion, think fit."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

The word "Borrower" referred to MEP and the word "Mortgagor" referred to PDI.
By depositing the Twinwood shares with ICB, PDI was therefore, under the terms
of cll 1.1 and 8.1 of the Security Memorandum, securing not only the
obligation of MEP to ICB but also its own obligations to ICB.

13\. PDI did not dispute ICB’s construction of the effect of the provisions in
the Security Memorandum. PDI, however, contended that:

> (a) At all material times the security created over the Twinwood shares,
> pursuant to the terms of the Security Memorandum, was intended by the
> parties to secure _**only**_ MEP’s liabilities to ICB and was never intended
> by the parties to secure PDI’s liabilities to ICB under the PDMI guarantee;
>
> (b) Insofar as they purport to create security for PDI’s other liabilities,
> the terms of the Security Memorandum are contrary to the true intentions of
> the parties.

and PDI sought the rectification of the Security Memorandum by deleting the
words "and/or the Mortgagor" from the definition of "Secured Obligations" in
cl 1.1 and in cl 8.1;

14\. Alternatively, PDI claimed that ICB knew that the Security Memorandum was
executed in excess of the relevant director’s authority as conferred by a
board resolution drafted by ICB itself. It was PDI’s case that to the extent
that the Security Memorandum was executed in excess of the relevant director’s
authority, the Security Memorandum was unenforceable against PDI.

15\. Before I deal with the merits of PDI’s application for rectification and
the defence of excess of authority that was raised, there is a preliminary
matter relating to the admissibility of the affidavit of Cheang on which I
have to make a final ruling.

_**

Admissibility of Cheang’s affidavit

**_:

16\. These proceedings were commenced by way of originating summons.
Proceedings by way of originating summons are generally heard on the basis of
the affidavits filed by the parties. This is provided for in Order 38, rule
2(2), the material parts of which read:

> "In any cause or matter begun by originating summons … evidence shall be
> given by affidavit …"

That rule then goes on to stipulate:

> "but the Court may, on the application of any party, order the attendance
> for cross-examination of the person making any such affidavit, and where,
> after such an order has been made, the person in question does not attend,
> his affidavit shall not be used as evidence _without the leave of the
> Court_."

> (Emphasis added.)

In the present case, the parties had, prior to the commencement of this
hearing, applied for leave to cross-examine each other’s witnesses and such
leave had been granted.

17\. Cheang had sworn her affidavit on 20 December 2001. Evidence was led that
shortly thereafter she had been retrenched by ICB and had returned to her
hometown in Ipoh. Evidence was also led that when asked to attend this
hearing, Cheang, citing family commitments, had refused to attend.

18\. Mr Vinodh Coomaraswamy, who appeared for PDI, submitted that as the
crucial issue in this case was the intention of the parties when they signed
the Security Memorandum, it was important that he cross-examine Cheang not
only because the testimony in her affidavit differed materially from the
testimony of Poh but also to elicit information material to his client not
alluded to in her affidavit. He therefore urged the court, in the exercise of
its discretion under Order 38 rule 2(2), to reject her affidavit since she was
not present for cross-examination.

19\. Mr Coomaraswamy was not able to cite any direct authority on the
principles that should guide the court in exercising that discretion. He,
however, drew the attention of the court to the case of _UMBC Finance Ltd v
Woon Kim Yan_ [1990] 3 MLJ 360 where the Malaysian Supreme Court held that the
discretion to admit the affidavit of a person not called as a witness at the
trial should not be exercised if the evidence was strongly contested or where
the evidence related closely to the credibility of the witness. Mr
Coomaraswamy submitted that although that case related to the calling of
witnesses at a trial begun by writ, the approach taken by the court in that
case would, nevertheless, be a relevant guideline.

20\. Mr Hri Kumar, who appeared for ICB, also adopted the guidelines
enunciated in _UMBC Finance Ltd_. Mr Kumar accepted that the more contentious
the contents of the affidavit, the less likely it would be that the court
would exercise its discretion to admit that affidavit in evidence without
cross-examination. Mr Kumar submitted that on that criterion there was nothing
particularly contentious about the contents of the affidavit of Cheang. The
most "contentious" part of her affidavit, he submitted, was paragraph 5 where
she said:

> "I did not, at any time, represent to any of the Defendants’ representatives
> in any of our discussions and/or meetings that the deposit of the Twinwood
> shares were meant to secure **only** the MEP facilities … It was not within
> my authority to vary the terms of the Security Memorandum."

Paragraph 5, Mr Kumar submitted, did not contain anything dramatically
different from the evidence of Poh. He submitted that, to the contrary,
Cheang’s affidavit was consistent with Poh’s evidence in that, like Poh, she
too states that the discussions centred on the securing of MEP’s facilities.
There was therefore considerable common ground between the affidavits of
Cheang and Poh. On the question of PDI not being able to question Cheang on
matters not covered in her affidavit, Mr Kumar pointed out that all the
documents (including internal documents) prepared by Cheang in connection with
the deposit of the Twinwood shares had been produced to the court and those
documents spoke for themselves.

21\. I was satisfied that there was nothing particularly contentious in the
affidavit that had been sworn to by Cheang and I noted Mr Kumar’s submission
that all relevant documents prepared by Cheang were available in evidence. ICB
had also adduced satisfactory evidence to explain why they were not able to
procure Cheang’s attendance. Mr Coomaraswamy’s complaint that because of the
failure to call Cheang for cross-examination he will not be able to elicit
information material to his clients that had not been covered in Cheang’s
affidavit was a valid complaint but was not by itself sufficient reason to
exclude Cheang’s affidavit which – as Mr Kumar submitted – did not contain any
seriously contentious matter.

22\. In the circumstances, I was inclined to grant ICB the leave it sought to
use Cheang’s affidavit as evidence. However, since the evidence as it unfolded
in the course of cross-examination of the witnesses for both sides may have a
bearing on the matter, I felt that it would be prudent not to make a final
order until the close of the case. I therefore directed that pending a final
ruling the case proceed on the basis that the affidavit was admissible.

23\. Having now heard all the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I
see no reason to alter that initial ruling. The fact that Cheang’s affidavit
was admitted without PDI having the opportunity which they sought to cross-
examine her on matters not covered by her affidavit is a matter that I can
take into account in assessing the overall merit of each party’s case.

_**

Rectification

**_.

24\. In order to succeed in its application to rectify the Security
Memorandum, PDI must establish either –

> (a) that there was a common mistake in the terms set out in the Security
> Memorandum; or
>
> (b) that PDI was unilaterally mistaken in respect of the terms of the
> Security Memorandum and ICB was aware of PDI’s mistake but did nothing to
> draw PDI’s attention to that mistake.

In this case PDI was not alleging unilateral mistake. Their defence was that
it was never intended by either party that the deposit of the Twinwood shares
would cover PDI’s liability to ICB. PDI was, as Mr Coomaraswamy expressly
confirmed, relying only on common or mutual mistake.

25\. The only witness who gave direct evidence on behalf of PDI on the
discussion that took place with Cheang of ICB prior to the execution of the
Security Memorandum was Poh. Evidence was led that Yap, the other person who
participated in these discussions, had left the employ of PDI and had refused
to co-operate.

26\. Poh’s evidence was to the effect that at the time of the negotiations
leading to the deposit of the Twinwood shares, only MEP’s account was in
default and the discussions he had with ICB related to regularising only that
account. To quote from his affidavit:

> "11. It is crucial to note that all my discussions with Ms Jean Cheang were
> conducted purely on the basis that the MEP facilities were in excess and had
> to be secured by further securities. This was because it was the only issue
> which was discussed and to which we directed our sole attention. There was
> no discussion of the facilities extended by the Plaintiff to us or our other
> subsidiaries apart from MEP."

Poh’s claim that the discussions with ICB centred only on providing security
for MEP’s liabilities accorded, as noted earlier, with Cheang’s testimony on
the matter.

27\. Mr Kumar submitted that the fact that the discussions with ICB centred on
the provision of security for the MEP account was not, by itself, evidence
that ICB did not intend that the securities provided by PDI would also
constitute security for other liabilities of PDI to ICB. He pointed out that
the standard form that ICB used for such deposits – the Security Memorandum –
clearly envisaged that the securities provided would also be security for the
Mortgagor’s (ie PDI’s) other liabilities to ICB. He submitted that Cheang’s
discussion with Poh relating to the deposit of the Twinwood shares was clearly
in the context of that standard form. Mr Coomaraswamy, however, submitted that
the discussions were only about obtaining additional security for the MEP
account and that the common intention of both parties at the time of the
discussion was to provide additional security for that account and no more. He
submitted that in requiring PDI to execute the standard Security Memorandum
form Cheang had overlooked the fact that that form in its fine-print contained
terms making the deposit not only security for all of the "borrower’s" (ie
MEP’s) liabilities but also security for all of the "mortgagor’s" (ie PDI’s)
liabilities to ICB.

28\. The question that I have to decide is therefore whether at the relevant
time the parties intended to secure only the MEP account and nothing more or
whether they also intended to secure PDI’s liabilities to ICB in respect of
other accounts.

29\. It was not in dispute that a party seeking rectification of a document
will be required to show "convincing proof" not only that the document to be
rectified was not in accordance with the parties’ true intention at the time
of its execution but also that the document in its proposed form would accord
with that intention (see: Kok Lee Kuen & Anor v Choon Fok Realty Pte Ltd & Ors
__[1996] 2 SLR 572; _Chitty on Contracts_ (1999 Ed) at 326/327).

30\. It was not in dispute that the reason why the Twinwood shares came to be
deposited with ICB was that the MEP account exceeded the stipulated margin
limit as a result of the decline in the value of the ADL shares that had
previously been deposited to secure the MEP facilities. It is against that
background that the evidence in this matter has to be evaluated. Poh’s
evidence in effect was that he (on behalf of PDI) agreed to deposit the
Twinwood shares with ICB as a temporary measure to give PDI and MEP time to
resolve the finances of MEP. It was also his evidence that Cheang assured him
that when the MEP account was settled ICB would return the Twinwood shares to
PDI.

31\. As Cheang was not available for cross-examination, Poh’s version of what
transpired at the discussions between them could not be put to her. Cheang’s
evidence as contained in her affidavit also did not sufficiently delve into
the details of the discussions she had with PDI. However, as part of the
discovery process, ICB had disclosed its internal documents relating to the
deposit. Mr Coomaraswamy took me through these documents in some detail. What
was particularly interesting was the contents of two internal documents dated
12 December 1997 and 17 December 1997.

32\. In the memo of 12 December 1997, Cheang informed the President of the
United Overseas Bank ("UOB") – the parent bank of ICB – that MEP’s account
with ICB had fallen into excess and she made the following request:

> "To allow a 3-month period for Borrower to repay the above shortfall of
> $2,016,700 and _regularise the account_ …
>
> Borrower will deposit about 20m newly listed Twinwood shares (SESDAQ) worth
> approximately $5.6m (40% advance margin = $2.24m) with our Bank _pending
> regularisation of the account_. However, these shares belong to the
> borrower’s parent, PD International PL (‘PDI’) which, as a promoter of the
> Twinwood listing, is under a one year moratorium period not to dispose these
> shares. The same condition will apply to the shares deposited with us.
>
> Borrower is actively seeking financing from other banks against pledging of
> these Twinwood shares. _We will progressively release the above deposited
> shares to these banks as funds generated from these new loans are utilised
> to regularise our account_."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

In the further memo to the President UOB dated 17 December 1997, Cheang
stated:

> "Further to our memo dated 12/12/97 (copy attached for reference), MEP has
> deposited a single share certificate for 25,763,016 Twinwood Engineering Ltd
> shares with us on 17/12/97 to provide _additional security comfort_ … These
> shares belong to PD International Pte Ltd, MEP’s 100% holding company.
>
> Meanwhile, we have advised them to obtain funds to regularise this account
> within 3 weeks.
>
> _
>
> In view of the short term
>
> _ , we will not send the share script for splitting."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

On this memo of 17 December 1997, in response to a handwritten query from
senior management, appears the following handwritten note of Cheang: "_The
shares are deposited_ with us _for only a short term pending obtaining funds
from other finance Cos to cover excesses (in cash)_."

33\. The picture that emerges from these internal documents is that ICB was
seeking to hold the Twinwood shares only until such time as the MEP account
was regularised. It appears to have been expressly envisaged at that time that
the Twinwood shares would be released when the MEP account was regularised.
These internal documents are not consistent with the Twinwood shares being
held as security for any purpose other than in connection with the MEP
account. The internal documents therefore add considerable support to Poh’s
version of the discussions he had with Cheang

34\. In his affidavit, Poh had stated that Cheang had assured him that ICB
would hold the Twinwood shares as collateral and would not enforce the
collateral. Mr Kumar submitted that no banker would give such an assurance and
invited the court not to give credence to Poh’s testimony. Whilst as a general
proposition I would agree that no responsible banker would give such an
assurance, I would have to consider the context in which this assurance was
allegedly given before concluding that Poh’s testimony should be rejected.
When questioned on the context, Poh’s response was:

> "She said that if I give the Twinwood shares, it would be easy for her to
> put up a paper to management to help me. I told her the shares were under
> moratorium. She said it does not matter and asked me to give the Twinwood
> shares to her and she assured me that when the MEP account is settled she
> will return the Twinwood scrips."

Given the contents of the internal memos and given that the Twinwood shares
were at that time subject to a moratorium on sale, it is entirely possible
that Cheang may have given an assurance along those lines .

35\. The Security Memorandum was sent to PDI for signature and it remained
with PDI for a few days before it was signed and returned. PDI therefore had
time to study the terms in the Security Memorandum before executing it. Mr
Kumar submitted – relying on the case of _Taylor Barnard Ltd v Tozer & Anor_
(1984) 1 EGLR 21 – that if it was reasonable to expect the other party to
check the draft of the agreement, rectification will not be allowed.

36._Taylor Barnard_ was a case where two solicitors were negotiating the terms
of a lease where, in the usual way, one solicitor would send a draft for the
consideration of the other who would then return the draft with suggested
modifications and the process would go on until the draft was settled. Where
an agreement is reached on that basis, it would obviously be very difficulty
for a party to obtain rectification of the document on the grounds of mistake
as the nature of the negotiation required the checking of every draft. That,
however, was not the fact situation here. PDI and ICB had had discussions with
ICB about the deposit of Twinwood shares as further security for the MEP until
the MEP account was regularised. After agreement was reached ICB sent the
Security Memorandum to PDI for execution. Unlike the situation in _Taylor
Barnard_ , the Security Memorandum was not sent to PDI as a draft that was to
serve as a basis for further negotiations. The principle in _Taylor Barnard_
therefore had little or no application in this case.

37\. Poh’s evidence in this case was substantially supported by ICB’s internal
documentation. It was also consistent with the terms of the Board resolutions
of PDI referred to at paragraphs 5 and 6 above which resolutions, as has been
noted, were drafted by ICB for PDI’s execution. These Board resolutions refer
specifically to the Twinwood shares being security for the MEP account.

38\. I am satisfied that PDI has shown convincing proof that the Security
Memorandum that was signed did not accurately reflect the intention of either
ICB or PDI. Having arrived at that decision, it becomes unnecessary for me to
consider the alternative defence raised that as ICB knew that the Security
Memorandum was executed in excess of the relevant director’s authority as
stated in Board resolutions, the Security Memorandum was to that extent
unenforceable against PDI.

39\. As I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Security Memorandum
was signed under a common mistake, I dismiss with costs ICB’s claims in the
Originating Summons and grant PDI’s application to rectify the Security
Memorandum by deleting the phrase "and/or the Mortgagor" in cll 1.1, 8.1 and
wherever else that phrase appears.
