The Judicial Commissioner convicted the Appellant on both charges and
sentenced him to death, which is the punishment mandated by section 33 read
with the Second Schedule of the Act. The Appellant brought this appeal against
his conviction in the High Court. We dismissed the appeal and now give our
grounds.

Facts

**

2 At the time of his arrest in April 2000, the Appellant was unemployed,
although he had occasionally been deployed as a daily-rated painter by two
contractors. On 11 April 2000, the Appellant was the subject of a surveillance
operation conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at a Housing and
Development Board (HDB) flat at Block 6 Jalan Minyak, #12-362, which was
registered in the Appellant's name. In the early evening, the Appellant was
seen leaving the flat in the company of one Abdul Rahman bin Mohd Noor. The
Appellant was seen carrying a brown paper bag on which was printed the word
"CAPTIONS". The Appellant and Abdul Rahman then met up with one Zamri bin Mohd
Ali at the void deck of Block 6. The Appellant and Zamri then boarded a lorry,
registration number YD 8173 P, driven by one Rumli bin Sarib. Also on board
the lorry were one Ng Sick Yong and one Jaseni bin Latip. Abdul Rahman was
seen boarding the lorry shortly afterwards, along Chin Swee Road.

3 The lorry was subsequently intercepted by CNB officers near a JTC flatted
factory in Kallang Bahru. The Appellant and the 5 other persons in the lorry
were arrested. CNB officers found the "CAPTIONS" brown paper bag carried by
the Appellant in the front cabin of the lorry. The bag contained 8 envelopes
and a red plastic bag containing a total of 81 sachets of a substance believed
to be heroin, and subsequently confirmed by the Department of Scientific
Services as containing not less than 24.4 grams of diamorphine. In respect of
the possession of these sachets, the Appellant was charged with trafficking in
a controlled drug, or, more specifically, with possession of a controlled drug
for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (the
1st charge).

4 Also found on the Appellant's person at the time of his arrest was a bunch
of 3 keys to the Appellant's HDB flat at Block 6 Jalan Minyak. Later that
evening, a CNB team, accompanied by the Appellant used these keys to enter the
flat, where, upon searching the bedroom, they recovered a white plastic bag on
which the words "Maxim Cakes" were printed. The bag contained 2 packets and 12
sachets of a substance believed to be heroin, and subsequently confirmed by
the Department of Scientific Services as containing not less than 77.40 grams
of diamorphine. In respect of the possession of these packets and sachets, the
Appellant was similarly charged with trafficking in a controlled drug, or,
more specifically, with possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of
trafficking under s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (the 2nd charge).

5 Also found in the "Maxim Cakes" bag at the time of the search were a digital
weighing scale, two candles, two metal spoons, two used envelopes, a stack of
9 envelopes, some more envelopes and a stack of 346 empty sachets. In a carton
near the bed, another white plastic bag was recovered, which was found to
contain 2320 empty sachets arranged in 5 stacks. Evidence was given in the
court below that the spoons could be used to repack the heroin from the larger
packets into the smaller sachets, the weight of each sachet measured using the
digital weighing scale, and the packed sachets sealed with the candles.

Appellant's Statements

_

6 In statements made to the CNB, the Appellant stated that the heroin
retreived from the "CAPTIONS" brown paper bag and the "Maxim Cakes" white
plastic bag belonged to a Chinese at Geylang Lorong 37, known as "Ah Mike".
The Appellant said that he first dealt with "Ah Mike" four days prior to his
arrest, when an unknown quantity of heroin was delivered to him by an
unidentified individual, to be repacked by the Appellant into smaller sachets.
The Appellant did so, and 2 hours later, returned the sachets to another
unidentified Chinese man at Geylang Lorong 37, for which he was paid $1000.

7 On the night before his arrest, the Appellant was out drinking at the market
place at Geylang Lorong 2 in the company of Abdul Rahman and another man known
only as "Ahmad". At about 3 a.m. on 11 April 2000, Abdul Rahman left by taxi.
Ahmad left at 5 a.m. The Appellant continued drinking until about 8 a.m. At
about 10 a.m. he received a call on his handphone informing him that "someone
was coming", by which he understood that he was to receive a new delivery of
drugs. At 11 a.m. on 11 April 2000, two male Chinese drove up in a Malaysia-
registered vehicle. The Appellant walked to the car and removed a brown paper
bag from the back seat. This was the same brown paper bag seized from the
Appellant at the time of his arrest. No words were exchanged and the two
Chinese drove off.

8 The Appellant then took a taxi back to his flat at Block 6 Jalan Minyak,
where he inspected the contents of the the brown paper bag. Inside, the
Appellant found 8 envelopes containing small packets of heroin and a plastic
bag containing 2 big packets of heroin. He stored the plastic bag on the floor
of the bedroom, next to the wardrobe. The Appellant then waited for a call on
his handphone. At about 4 p.m., he received a call instructing him to bring
the 8 envelopes containing small packets of heroin to "the same place", which
the Appellant understood to mean Geylang Lorong 37, at about 6 p.m. that day.

9 Shortly after receiving the call, the Abdul Rahman came to the Appellant's
flat, where the Appellant gave him a small quantity of heroin to smoke.
According to the Appellant, Abdul Rahman had no knowledge of the brown paper
bag and its contents, or of the plastic bag containing two big packets of
heroin. At around 6 p.m., the Appellant and Abdul Rahman left the flat. Soon
after, at the void deck, the Appellant, by chance, met an individual known as
Zamri bin Mohd Ali (whom the Appellant knew as "Hassan"). Zamri told the
Appellant that he was going to Tampines by lorry. The Appellant asked Zamri
for a lift and Hassan agreed. Zamri also agreed to give Abdul Rahman a lift,
as he was also going to Tampines. The lorry was subsequently intercepted by
the CNB, as explained in the course of events narrated above.

The Appeal

_

10 The quantities of diamorphine contained in the heroin found in both the
"CAPTIONS" brown paper bag and the "Maxim Cakes" white plastic bag exceeded
the statutory amount (2 grammes) required to activate the rebuttable
presumption under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act that the Appellant possessed
the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. This in turn activated s 5(2) which
provides that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug
if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. On this
basis, the Judicial Commissioner convicted the Appellant of both charges.

11 In his Petition of Appeal, the Appellant contended that the Judicial
Commissioner erred in finding that he had failed, on a balance of
probabilities, to rebut the presumption arising under s 17 that he possessed
the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Section 17 provides that the
presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking can be rebutted if
the accused proves that his possession of the drug is for some other purpose.
In this context, it was argued that the evidence showed that the appellant's
purpose in having possession of the drugs was to repack them into smaller
sachets and to return them to their owner, the Chinese man known as "Ah Mike".
It was the Appellant's case that possession for the purpose repacking is not
equivalent to possession for the purpose of trafficking. This argument was
rejected by the Judicial Commissioner, and we agreed with his conclusion.

12 Section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act provides that

> "traffic" means
>
> (a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or
>
> (b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a),
>
> otherwise than under the authority of this Act or the regulations; and
> "trafficking" has a corresponding meaning;

In _Lee Yuan Kwang & Ors v PP _[1995] 2 SLR 249 the Court of Appeal ruled that
possession of drugs with the intention of returning them to their rightful
owner did not rebut the s 17 presumption. In other words, possession as a
bailee or custodian of the drugs still amounts to possession for the purpose
of trafficking. See also _Goh Hock Huat v PP_ [1995] 1 SLR 274 and _Sze Siew
Luan v PP_ [1997] 2 SLR 522. In _Lee_ 's case, the Court of Appeal
distinguished an earlier decision, _PP v Wan Yue Kong & Ors_ [1995] 1 SLR 417
in which two defendants were convicted of possession _simpliciter_ under s 8
in circumstances where they knew of the presence of drugs in the flat but the
drugs were left there by a third person who had intended to retreive them from
the premises. The Court in _Lee_ emphasised that this was a prosecution that
had been brought under the law prior to the 1993 amendment to the Misuse of
Drugs Act that introduced s 17, and that in the absence of evidence showing
overt acts of trafficking, the elements of the more serious offence of
possession for the purpose of trafficking were not made out. Prior to the
introduction of s 17, mere possession of the proscribed amount did not shift
the burden to the defendants to disprove possession for the purpose of
trafficking.

13 In this appeal, the Appellant argued that he ought to have been convicted
of possession _simpliciter_ and not possession for the purpose of trafficking
because he only intended to repack the drugs. We do not see how that line of
reasoning can is reconcileable with the Court of Appeal's ruling in _Lee Yuan
Kwang_. Here, the Appellant, in addition to being in possession of the drugs,
admitted in his statements to the CNB that he intended to repack them,
ostensibly with a view to resale by "Ah Mike". The Appellant's arguments that
this did not constitute trafficking flew in the face of reason, and, if we
were to accept it, would have undermined a fundamental objective of the
statute. In any event, this argument, even if we were to accept it, would only
have assisted the Appellant in the 2nd charge. In relation to the 1st charge,
the evidence showed that the Appellant was merely delivering the same 8
envelopes he had collected at Geylang Lorong 2 to Geylang Lorong 37, which
falls squarely within the definition of "trafficking" in s 2.

14 In the circumstances, we dismissed the appeal, and confirmed the imposition
of the capital sentence as required by the Act.
