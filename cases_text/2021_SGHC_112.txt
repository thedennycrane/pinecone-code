Chan Seng Onn J:

1 In this suit, the plaintiff, Teo Yong Soon (“Teo”), claims against the
defendant, Kwan Yuen Heng (“Kwan”), in respect of several interest-free loans
extended to the defendant on seven occasions totalling $1,621,000.00. 1

Plaintiff’s closing submissions dated 30 March 2021 (“PCS1”) at paras 4 and

2 Kwan’s main defence is that any loans allegedly advanced are unenforceable
under s 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”) as Teo is
an unlicensed moneylender and/or is operating as an agent of an unlicensed
moneylender. 2

It was on this basis that he loaned a total sum of $1,621,000.00 interest-free
to Kwan between 13 November 2014 and 20 October 2017.In support of this, Teo
provides bank statements showing cash withdrawals from Teo and/or his wife’s
bank account (save for Loan No. 3 where Teo clarified that $2,000.00 in cash
had been added to the cash withdrawal of $53,000.00 from the bank account). 20

investors who had pulled out of the projects he was working on. 22

Teo stood as guarantor for the Malaysian Loan and informed Kwan that Kwan
needed to repay the Malaysian Loan since Teo would be held personally liable
if he did not. From then on, Kwan stopped contacting Teo for loans. However,
since Teo was worried about the Malaysian Loan, he continually updated Kwan
about the status of the loans that were taken out. 35

Till date, Kwan has not made any repayment to Teo. It should be noted that Teo
is not claiming anything in relation to the Malaysian Loan in this suit.

15 Kwan’s case is that any loans allegedly advanced are unenforceable under s
14(2) of the MLA as Teo is an unlicensed moneylender and/or is operating as an

Issues to be determined

19 Based on the parties’ submissions, four main issues arise for my
determination:

(a) the quantum of the loans extended by Teo to Kwan;

(b) whether the loans were interest-bearing;

(c) whether Kwan made any repayment to Teo; and

(d) whether Teo is an unlicensed moneylender under the MLA.

Issue 1: The quantum of the loans extended by Teo to Kwan

20 I turn first to determine the true quantum of the loans. While it is
undisputed that Teo loaned at least $550,000.00 to Kwan, parties dispute the
total quantum of the loans. Teo submits that he had loaned to Kwan a total sum
of $1,621,000.00 on seven occasions. Kwan, however, submits that the total
loan was only $550,000.00 given on two occasions.

21 On the evidence before me, Teo’s version of events is clearly more probable
than Kwan’s version of events for the following reasons.

22 First, I note that Teo’s version of events is supported by objective
documents adduced by Teo such as the bank statements of Teo and his wife, and
the cash cheques (which I have set out at [13] above) issued by Kwan and given
to Teo. 47

##### Foot Note 47

×

Agreed Bundle of Documents, Volume 1 (“1AB”) pp 7 to 28.

While the bank statements showing only cash withdrawals (totalling
$1,619,000.00) from Teo and/or his wife’s bank account do not, ipso facto,
show that the loans (totalling $1,621,000.00) were given to Kwan, it provides
some support for the fact that the dates and quantum of the loans were not
simply invented by Teo without any basis. The important evidence that points
towards Kwan’s actual receipt of these cash withdrawals (plus $2,000 cash
which Teo had in hand for Loan No. 3) is the subsequent issuance of cash
cheques many months later by Kwan to Teo, the total sum of which very
coincidentally matches the same total loan quantum of $1,621,000.00 as claimed
by Teo. The objective evidence here points towards an intended repayment by
Kwan vide several post-dated cash cheques of an aggregate loan of
$1,621,000.00 that he had taken from Teo. These cash cheques could also be
viewed as a form of assurance to Teo that the whole loan of $1,621,000.00
would be repaid in due course once Kwan had found the money to fund his bank
account to meet the liabilities of the cash cheques he had issued to Teo.

23 However, Kwan claims that this is simply a “backward construction of
facts”. 48

##### Foot Note 48

×

Transcript (16 March 2021) at p 15.

He contends that since the date of the first cheque (ie, 13 November 2016) was
two years after large sums of money had allegedly been loaned to Kwan, it is
not possible for Teo to have loaned such large sums without asking for any
collateral or agreement at that time but only two years later. 49

##### Foot Note 49

×

DCS1 at para 4.

In my view, this does not logically follow. It is not unbelievable that Teo
did not ask for any written loan agreement or documentation initially because
of the goodwill Teo had towards Kwan. It is Teo’s consistent and
uncontradicted evidence that he treated Kwan as a very close friend that he
had known for over twenty years and had regarded Kwan as his “brother”.
Further, I accept that he had grounds to be assured of Kwan’s creditworthiness
because Kwan owned multiple properties, paid Teo to renovate his properties,
invested for Teo’s wife successfully and was even proxy for several high net
worth investors(see [7]–[9] above). Therefore, the fact that the total sum of
all the cash cheques received by Teo from Kwan as intended repayment or
assurance of repayment is the same as Teo’s claim as to the total loan quantum
[given by him], namely $1,621,000.00, is probative of Teo’s version of events.

24 Second, on Teo’s version of events, he loaned a sum of $245,000.00 on 11
July 2015 to Kwan (see Loan No. 4 in the table provided at [10]). Teo submits
that, in this particular instance, Kwan deposited the cash into his Citibank
account two days later on 13 July 2015. Kwan’s Citibank account statement
shows a previous balance of $3,174.31 on 1 July 2015 and a cash deposit of
$250,000.00 on 13 July 2015. 50

##### Foot Note 50

×

Agreed Bundle of Documents, Volume 2 (“2AB”) at p 378.

As such, this lends credence to Teo’s version of events.

25 When cross-examined, Kwan could not proffer a good explanation for this
cash deposit. On his own version of events, there was only one loan of
$250,000.00 given in June 2015 and another loan of $300,000.00 given in
November 2015 (see [15] above). Interestingly, Kwan does not assert that he
had kept the $250,000.00 given in June 2015 and only deposited it on 13 July
2015. Instead, he claims that the $250,000.00 loan given in June 2015 was
spent on salaries and payments for housing loans, and the cash deposit on 13
July 2015 was not from Teo. 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

Transcript (16 March 2021) at pp 88 to 90.

But he does not explain how he had gotten such a huge sum of money at that
time or say who he had borrowed it from. On balance, I accept that it is more
likely that the $250,000.00 deposit came from Teo’s Loan No. 4 of $245,000.00
given in cash to Kwan two days earlier. As such, this is corroborative of
Teo’s version of events.

26 Third, Kwan’s own version of events is riddled with inconsistencies. It is
contradicted by his own police report against Teo dated 25 June 2018. 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

2AB at pp 668 to 669.

In that report, he stated that the first time he borrowed money from Teo was
“one and a half year[s] ago sometime in end 2016” and the sum was $200,000.00.
He also stated that “[on] and off, I still borrowed money from him and in
total I have received a total of SGD$800,000.00 from him”. However, on Kwan’s
own version of events, his first loan from Teo was $250,000.00 in June 2015
and he maintains that he had only taken two loans from Teo which amount to
$550,000.00. Not only are there clear contradictions, what he stated in his
police report clearly suggests that there were other loans given to him by Teo
other than the two loans he admits to.

27 These inconsistencies are stark especially since Kwan claims to have an
excel spreadsheet recording the cash loans given to him and the repayments in
cash. 53

##### Foot Note 53

×

Transcript (16 March 2021) at pp 26 to 27.

As such, there should be no reason for him to give an inaccurate version of
the loans and repayments to the police when he could have easily checked
and/or made the spreadsheet available to the police to support his
allegations.

28 In his police report dated 25 June 2018, he said the following:

On and off, I still borrowed money from him and in total I have received a
total of SGD$800,000 from him. Till date, I have paid an interest amounting to
about SGD$500,000. In addition, I have paid him a lump sum of SGD$481,000 on
08/04/2018. In total, I have repaid over SGD$900,000 to him. However, he
demanded me to pay SGD$4.5 million. In addition, he forced me to write him a
cheque amounting to $500,000 for interest.

[emphasis added]

29 This again materially contradicts Kwan’s version of events. According to
his account before the court, he had paid a total of $1,497,000.00 by April
2018 (see [18] above). Yet, he informed the police that he had in total repaid
over $900,000.00 which is substantially lower than the sum that he now claims
to have repaid. Additionally, while Kwan claimed in his police report to have
been forced to write a $500,000.00 cheque to Teo, Teo has not adduced or
included any cheque of $500,000.00 in making out his claim (see [13] above).
If Teo had indeed received the cheque, there is no reason why Teo would not
have produced the cheque and increased his claim amount.

30 Under cross-examination, Kwan’s answer to these inconsistencies is that he
was emotional at the time of making the police report because he was worried
about his family since “Teo and his people [were] already at [his] house” and
his wife had called him and was crying very badly. 54

##### Foot Note 54

Transcript (16 March 2021) at p 32.

However, I find this explanation a convenient afterthought and unbelievable.
In the police report, Kwan stated the following:

As long as I don’t pay him, he will threaten that he will send people down to
my house, send letters to my neighbors, reminding me that he knows where my
daughter study and when my wife leave the house. The latest threat that he
gave me was that he informed me that it is very cheap to get people down from
Malaysia and do something to me.

I would also like to state that he has not harassed my house, my family
members and my neighbors as of now.

31 It is inconceivable that, if Kwan’s wife had truly called him and was
crying very badly with Teo outside the door, Kwan would have withheld that
crucial piece of information from the police and not asked for immediate
assistance. His use of the words “the latest threat he gave me” implied that
up to the material time Kwan was making the police report, this was the most
egregious act by Teo. He also clearly stated of his own volition in his police
report that there was no harassment of his house or family members up to that
point in time.

32 Aside from the police report, I note that inconsistencies also exist in
Kwan’s version of events in his defence dated 9 September 2019, his affidavit
evidence-in-chief dated 1 September 2020 and his evidence at trial. In his
defence, he claims that the actual amounts borrowed were $225,000.00 in May
2016 and $245,000.00 in November 2016. In his affidavit evidence-in-chief, he
claims that the actual amounts borrowed were $250,000.00 in June 2015 and
$245,000.00 in November 2015. At trial, he claims that the actual amounts
borrowed were $250,000.00 in June 2015 and $300,000.00 in November 2015.

33 When cross-examined on these inconsistencies, Kwan explains that while he
borrowed $250,000.00 in June 2015 and $300,000.00 in November 2015, he only
received cash of $225,000.00 in June 2015 and $245,000.00 in November 2015.
For the June 2015 loan, Teo deducted the first month of interest of $25,000.00
from the loan amount of $250,000.00. For the November 2015 loan, Teo deducted
the first month of interest of $45,000.00 and $10,000.00 as coffee money for
the loan amount of $300,000.00. 55

However, if that is the case, it is inexplicable why Kwan recorded the sum of
$250,000.00 for the June 2015 loan (including the $25,000.00 interest) but
recorded the sum of $245,000.00 for the November 2015 loan (excluding the
$45,000.00 interest and $10,000.00 coffee money) in his affidavit evidence-in-
chief. In the light of his background in the finance industry and given that
Kwan purportedly has an excel sheet recording all these transactions, I find
these inconsistencies and his explanations for the inconsistencies damaging to
his credibility.

34 Given the foregoing, I find on a balance of probabilities that Teo’s
version of events is true and that Teo had granted seven loans (as set out at
[10] above) with an aggregate amount of $1,621,000.00 to Kwan (the “Loans”).

Issue 2: Whether the loans were interest-bearing

35 I turn next to the issue of whether the Loans were interest-bearing. This
has a significant bearing on Kwan’s main defence that the Loans are
unenforceable under the MLA. Teo maintains that the Loans were given on an
interest-free basis while Kwan asserts that he had to pay interest for the
Loans.

36 On balance, I accept Teo’s submission that the Loans were given on an
interest-free basis.

37 Kwan primarily relies on a series of WhatsApp messages with Teo to assert
that Teo had continually demanded for interest payments. 56

These messages show Teo providing periodic updates on what seems to be the
quantum of an outstanding loan and details of required interest payments to
Kwan. An example of the content of one such message from Teo is as follows: 57

2AB at p 526.

Bro your account from 10th to 13rd is S$ 131,800 for 18th : S$3400, 22nd:
S$7700 and 27th : S$13,000. Please try to meet me up so that if anything I
still around if not I don’t know how for other people ac la. Thanks

38 Such a message, seen in isolation, may suggest that Teo was seeking
interest payments from Kwan. For instance, the above message could be
interpreted as Teo informing Kwan that his account balance outstanding was
$131,800.00 and that Kwan needed to pay interest payments of $3,400.00,
$7,700.00 and $13,000.00 on those specified dates. But as I explain below,
that is far from the true picture.

39 While Teo does not dispute that he had sent those messages, his case is
that the content of all those messages were from the Malaysian loan sharks in
relation to the Malaysian Loan. 58

It was Kwan who requested Teo to relay the information from the Malaysian loan
sharks to him in written form through WhatsApp messages. Since the Malaysian
loan sharks were Teo’s friends and Teo acted as a guarantor for the Malaysian
Loan, Teo’s explanation is that he was only acting as a middleman between Kwan
and the Malaysian loan sharks.

40 I note that Kwan disputes the existence of the Malaysian Loan. Kwan claims
that he has never been introduced by Teo to any Malaysian loan sharks. 59

He denies borrowing money from any such Malaysian party. He also alleges that
if any Malaysian loan sharks existed, it was Teo who guaranteed or took on the
loan himself and marked up the interest to earn the difference for himself.
Alternatively, Teo could have been working together with the Malaysian loan
sharks. 60

41 However, on a closer scrutiny of the WhatsApp messages, Kwan must have
known that he had borrowed money from a third party. In Teo’s messages to
Kwan, there were numerous references to a third party whom Teo had to speak to
on Kwan’s behalf. 61

##### Foot Note 61

At multiple points, Teo referred to the fact that he was put in a very
difficult position because Kwan was not making repayments when he was supposed
to. 62

Most explicitly, in response to one of the messages when Kwan wrote “I know
you as my very good friend and for that I will not play you out. [J]ust needed
you to let me overcome this hurdle so that I can repay whatever I owe you”,
Teo immediately replied “[n]ot me you owe is them you owe and they are not as
good like me”. 63

In the face of all this contrary evidence, I cannot accept Kwan’s assertions
that he did not know of the existence of any third party. It is clear to me
that the third party in the WhatsApp messages being referred to was the
Malaysian loan sharks.

42 Importantly, it is conceded by Kwan that all the WhatsApp messages adduced
by him were during end 2017 and 2018. 64

##### Foot Note 64

These WhatsApp messages were sent after the seventh and final loan of
$34,000.00 was given on 20 October 2017 to Kwan (see above at [10]). Teo
submits that the fact that there were no WhatsApp messages showing any demands
by him for interest payments before end 2017 (even though the first loan of
$500,000 was given by him on 13 November 2014), shows that the WhatsApp
messages only related to the Malaysian Loan and not the Loans. 65

##### Foot Note 65

PCS1 at para 111.

Kwan’s explanation for this is that most of the communications between Kwan
and Teo before end 2017 were done through phone calls and while there were
similar messages, he was not able to recover them. 66

43 I accept Teo’s submission on this point. If Teo had charged interest
beginning with the first loan in 2014, there would likely be WhatsApp messages
between Teo and Kwan showing Teo constantly reminding Kwan of the repayment
dates and amounts of interest accruing from time to time as Kwan borrowed more
and more money from Teo. There is no explanation given by Kwan as to why Teo
would change his dominant mode of communication from phone calls before end
2017 to WhatsApp messages after end 2017. If Kwan’s case is accepted, it
stands to reason that there must have been some similar messages requesting
for interest payments after November 2014. However, Kwan has not adduced any
such evidence. It is conspicuous that only messages for end 2017 and 2018 were
adduced. Further, I find it hard to accept Kwan’s assertion that he was not
able to recover messages from 2015 to end 2017. From the words “TODAY” or
“YESTERDAY” present on the screenshots of many of the WhatsApp messages, it is
apparent that Kwan had the presence of mind to screenshot the WhatsApp
messages on the day the messages were sent to him or the next day. 67

This is confirmed by Kwan under cross-examination. 68

Transcript (16 March 2021) at pp 91 to92.

Thus, it is more likely that Teo’s explanation is true. On Teo’s case, the
answer to this is simply that there were no such messages prior to end 2017
either stating the amount or demanding payment of the accrued interest because
the Malaysian Loan had not come into existence at that time and the Loans to
Kwan were given interest-free.

44 It is also telling that the figures in the WhatsApp messages do not
correspond at all to either parties’ account of the quantum of the various
loans extended at various times from Teo to Kwan. This makes Teo’s case more
believable since the seventh and final loan took place on 20 October 2017 (see
above at [10]) and the Malaysian Loan came into existence only after that when
Teo no longer had money to lend to Kwan.

45 In several of the messages, Teo made references to his position as
guarantor for the Malaysian Loan. In one message, he said “Bro look at it. I’m
still better than your uncle tat is because I’m putting my neck for you till
today”. 69

##### Foot Note 69

In another message, he said “You told me you can return all then you said 50%
then now notting. Bro I really can’t thinks a way to tell them” and “I just
getting [f—] from them and they have just said that on Monday wanted to have a
meeting with me. Bro I don’t what they up too. Please please please one
thousands please help me up this time”. 70

2AB at p 571.

These messages undermine Kwan’s case that the messages were evidence of Teo
chasing Kwan for interest payments for the Loans.

46 Finally, I note that Teo is able to give detailed and vivid evidence as to
how the transaction relating to the Malaysian Loan took place. On questioning,
he recounts that cash of $800,000.00 constituting the Malaysian Loan was
handed over by the Malaysians who were on motorcycles behind the hawker centre
near the Singapore Customs to Kwan through his side of the window. 71

##### Foot Note 71

Kwan and Teo were at that time seated in the car. After Kwan passed to them 12
pieces of cheques bearing his signature, the Malaysians looked at them before
riding off subsequently. I note that these 12 pieces of cheques correspond to
one of Teo’s WhatsApp messages to Kwan stating “Bring along your chq book
which have more than 12 pcs of chq. Also copy both you and Cat I.c fort and
back total 4 sets each for both of you. Ask Cat to write her own name, ic
number and sign by her self including you do the same. Thanks”. 72

2AB at p 559.

It is clear that this request was in the context of the documents required for
the Malaysian Loan. It is inconceivable that Teo would suddenly request for
such detailed documentation when it is Kwan’s own evidence that the loans
taken by him in June and November 2015 were given in cash with no
documentation. It is unlikely that Teo would suddenly request for such
documentation in 2018 for no reason. However, Teo’s WhatsApp messages can be
adequately explained by the existence of the Malaysian loan sharks since the
granting of the Malaysian Loan by them would very likely be conditional upon
such documentation.

47 In the premises, I accept Teo’s evidence that the Malaysian Loan exists and
are separate from the Loans. The WhatsApp messages relied on by Kwan concern
only the interest payments for the Malaysian Loan. They have nothing to do
with Teo’s Loans.

48 Apart from Teo’s testimony that the Loans were interest-free, I also rely
on the fact that the total principal sum for the Loans based on the relevant
cash withdrawals (which total $1,619,000.00) from Teo and/or his wife’s bank
account as stated in the bank statements largely matched the aggregate amount
of the cash cheques (which total $1,621,000.00) issued by Kwan and given to
Teo as repayment or an assurance of repayment of the Loans. The difference of
$2,000.00 exists because Teo averred in his affidavit 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

1PBAEIC at p 8.

that he withdrew $53,000.00 cash by way of a cash cheque and added his own
cash of $2,000.00 to make up the third loan of $53,000.00 that he granted to
Kwan on 30 June 2015 (see [10]). This further demonstrates that the Loans were
free of interest. If the Loans were interest-bearing, then the aggregate
amount of the cash cheques issued by Kwan for repayment or assurance of
repayment would have to be much greater than the total principal sum of the
Loans based on the bank statements furnished by Teo, which is not the case.

49 Therefore, I find that Teo did not charge any interest for the Loans he
gave to Teo.

Issue 3: Whether Kwan made any repayment to Teo

50 The only remaining factual issue is whether any repayment has been made by
Kwan to Teo. Kwan claims that he has repaid a sum of $1,497,000.00 in cash
over 16 repayments (see [18] above) while Teo has maintained consistently that
Kwan has not made any repayment till date (see [14] above). In such a
situation, the court must rely on the trite principle that he who asserts a
fact must prove it. The burden of proof lies upon Kwan to adduce evidence to
corroborate his version of events.

51 After considering both parties’ accounts, I find that Kwan has failed to
show that he had made any repayments to Teo.

52 Kwan relies on his bank account statements to show that he had withdrawn
specific amounts and claims that those amounts had been repaid to Teo. 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

2PBAEIC at pp 394 to 396.

For the final alleged repayment of $487,000.00 in April 2018, Kwan also relies
on a WhatsApp message where he told Teo “the money I got immediately from the
sales of the condo I immediately return and the fund didn’t even stay extra
day in my account”. 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

2PBAEIC at p 398.

53 However, none of these support his case. As I recognise (at [22] above),
the presence of such bank statements do not show that the amounts withdrawn
had in fact been paid to the recipient. There must be other corroborating
evidence to show that. In so far as Kwan’s case is that the WhatsApp messages
do show Teo’s demands for repayment, it bears noting that none of the figures
in the WhatsApp messages actually match the amounts of Kwan’s alleged
repayments (see [18] above). 76

##### Foot Note 76

×

2AB at pp 524 to 530.

54 As regards the particular WhatsApp message that Kwan relies on, I have
found that all the WhatsApp messages relate to the Malaysian Loan and not the
Loans. Therefore, this does not assist Kwan. Even with respect to this
specific message, the reply to that message contradicts Kwan’s case. In
response, Teo replied as follows:

Ya I know this is what we have Agee if not I will not going around ask the
Casio side to load you. But now it look like is not work of your plan that you
have. Which I have ask you and you said 100% no problem. Bro you have keep
promise me and at the end is notting happen.

Why not in this way your house or condo just sell to them so that you have no
problem I also no problem right. Went you do that I thanks you 1 million time.

[emphasis added]

55 Teo’s reply clearly suggests that the repayment of $487,000.00 was made not
to Teo but to the Malaysian loan sharks and even that was not enough.
Therefore, Teo recommended to Kwan to sell another one of his properties so
that Kwan could repay the Malaysian Loan. The two messages, viewed together,
do not support Kwan’s contention that he had repaid Teo a sum of $1,497,000.00
in cash over 16 repayments.

56 For completeness, I note that Kwan’s police report mentions that he had
paid about $500,000.00 in interest and another lump sum of $481,000.00 to Teo
(see [27] above). However, Kwan has not adduced any evidence to corroborate
those assertions. Even Kwan’s account of his own repayments does not include
either sum of $500,000.00 or $481,000.00 (see [18] above). While the latter
sum of $481,000.00 may plausibly be a reference to the sum of $487,000.00 from
Kwan’s sale of his property, I have earlier found that it was made in
repayment of the Malaysian Loan and not the Loans.

57 In the premises, I find that Kwan has not shown that he has made any
repayment to Teo for the Loans.

Issue 4: Whether Teo is an unlicensed moneylender under the MLA

58 Given my factual findings above, I turn now to address the final issue on
whether Teo is an unlicensed moneylender under the MLA. It is trite that the
MLA prohibits the business of moneylending rather than the mere act of lending
money. It was intended to be “… a scheme of social legislation designed to
regulate rapacious and predatory conduct by unscrupulous unlicensed
moneylenders” (see City Hardware Pte Ltd v Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd [2005]
1 SLR(R) 733 (“City Hardware”) at [47]).

59 Section 14(2) of the MLA sets out the unenforceability of loans granted by
unlicensed moneylenders:

(2) Where any contract for a loan has been granted by an unlicensed
moneylender, or any guarantee or security has been given for such a loan —

(a) the contract for a loan, and the guarantee or security, as the case may
be, shall be unenforceable; and

(b) any money paid by or on behalf of the unlicensed moneylender under the
contract for the loan shall not be recoverable in any court of law.

60 The terms “unlicensed moneylender” and “moneylender” are defined in s 2 of
the MLA as follows:

“moneylender” means a person who, whether as principal or agent, carries on or
holds himself out in any way as carrying on the business of moneylending,
whether or not he carries on any other business, but does not include any
excluded moneylender;

…

“unlicensed moneylender” means a person —

(a) who is presumed to be a moneylender under section 3; and

(b) who is not a licensee or an exempt moneylender.

61 The statutory presumption of a moneylender is stated in s 3 of the MLA:

Persons presumed to be moneylenders

3\. Any person, other than an excluded moneylender, who lends a sum of money
in consideration of a larger sum being repaid shall be presumed, until the
contrary is proved, to be a moneylender.

62 As the Court of Appeal in Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International
(Hong Kong) Ltd [2014] 3 SLR 524 summarised at [75], the applicable principles
in relation to s 14(2) of the MLA are as follows:

(a) To rely on s 14(2) of the MLA, the borrower must prove that the lender was
an “unlicensed moneylender”.

(b) If the borrower can establish that the lender has lent money in
consideration for a higher sum being repaid, he may rely on the presumption
contained in s 3 of the MLA to discharge this burden.

(c) The burden then shifts to the lender to prove that he either does not
carry on the business of moneylending or possesses a moneylending license or
is an “exempted moneylender”.

(d) However, if there is an issue as to whether the lender is an excluded
moneylender, the legal burden of proving that he is not will fall on the
borrower.

63 The application of the presumption in s 3 of the MLA was explained by
Belinda Ang J (as she then was) in Mak Chik Lun and others v Loh Kim Her and
others and another action [2003] 4 SLR(R) 338 at [11]–[12]:

11 To prove that a person is in the business of moneylending, the easiest way
is to show that the rebuttable presumption in s 3 of the Act is applicable to
the facts of the case. If the borrower can show that a person lends a sum of
money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid, the person is presumed to
be a moneylender. Once a prima facie presumption is raised, it is for the
lender to rebut the presumption by showing that it does not apply. He has to
bring himself within one of the exceptions in s 2 or show that he is not a
moneylender within the terms of the definition in s 2. In rebutting the
presumption, the claimant, for instance, has to show that there was neither
system nor continuity in moneylending. The local test of whether there is a
business of moneylending is whether there was a system and continuity in the
transactions. If no system or continuity is displayed, the alternative test
(the [Litchfield v Dreyfus [1906] 1 KB 584 (“Litchfield”)] test) of whether
the alleged moneylender is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and
sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible is used …

12 In the case where the borrower is unable to raise the presumption in s 3,
the burden is then on him to prove the business of moneylending through the
two tests mentioned.

64 As I have found that the Loans were interest-free (at [49] above), Kwan
cannot rely on the presumption in s 3 of the MLA. The burden is thus on Kwan
to prove that Teo is in the business of moneylending by either showing that
“there was a system and continuity in the transactions” or that Teo is “one
who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from
his point of view eligible”.

65 In considering whether there is a “system or continuity in the
transactions”, the court asks whether the loans are part of an ongoing and
routine series of transactions made by the alleged moneylender (see Neville,
Guy v Andrla, Dominic [2017] SGHC 295 at [15(b)]). It is not intended to apply
to persons “who lend money as an incident of another business or to a few old
friends by way of friendship” (see City Hardware at [19], citing Litchfield at
590). The following guidance from Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) in Ng Kum
Peng v PP [1995] 2 SLR(R) 900 at [38] is instructive:

All the authorities indicate that there must be more than occasional loans.
This is what is meant by continuity. The loans must be part of an ongoing and
routine series of transactions made by the alleged moneylender. The
requirement of system on the other hand has not been explicitly clarified. But
it is evident that the need for system shows that there must be an organised
scheme of moneylending. Some indicators of such a scheme would be fixed rates,
the rate of interest being dependent on the creditworthiness and past conduct
of the borrower and a clear and definite repayment plan. Such factors
distinguish organised moneylending from occasional loans, which would be
outside the mischief of the Act.

[emphasis added]

66 To my mind, it is clear that there is no system to the Loans. Not only is
there no interest charged, there is no evidence of Teo constantly hounding
Kwan to make repayments according to any definite repayment plan for the
Loans. In terms of continuity, the existence of a number of loans does not
necessarily mean that the lender is a moneylender (see Ding Leng Kong v Mok
Kwong Yue and others [2003] 4 SLR(R) 637 at [52]). Thus, just because the
Loans were made on seven occasions (see [10] above), this does not necessarily
mean that there is the requisite degree of continuity to make Teo a
moneylender. The facts do not show an ongoing and routine series of
transactions. To the contrary, they show that the Loans were given
occasionally by Teo to Kwan as per Kwan’s requests on account of their very
close friendship.

67 Since there is no system or continuity in the transactions, I turn to
consider whether Teo is “one who is ready and willing to lend to all and
sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible”. Teo has given
evidence that while he has lent small sums of $1,000.00 to $2,000.00 to his
friends, workers and subcontractors, he has not charged interest and has even
forgiven their debts if they did not repay him. 77

He has not lent more than $2,000.00 to $3,000.00 to them 78

Transcript (16 March 2021) at p 4.

Kwan has not adduced any evidence to show that Teo has been always willing to
lend to all and sundry so long as they are eligible. Since Teo’s evidence on
this point is uncontradicted, I accept that apart from Kwan, Teo had lent
money occasionally to his friends, workers and subcontractors but he is not
one who can be described as “ready and willing to lend to all and sundry
provided that they are from his point of view eligible”.

68 For the foregoing reasons, I find that Teo is not an unlicensed moneylender
under the MLA. As such, the Loans are enforceable as against Kwan.

69 I note that Kwan has also raised s 14(3A)(a) of the MLA to argue that Teo
had assisted in a contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA by collecting or
demanding payments of a loan on behalf of a person whom Teo knows or has
reasonable grounds to believe is carrying a business in contravention of s
5(1) of the MLA. 79
