_**Delivered by Chao Hick Tin JA** _

1 This was an appeal against a decision of the High Court staying execution of
a summary judgment granted in favour of the appellant-plaintiffs on the ground
that the respondent-defendants had a counterclaim against the plaintiffs which
surpassed the amount of the summary judgment. We heard the appeal on 19
February 2003 and allowed it, lifting the stay of execution. We now give our
reasons.

**The facts**

2 The plaintiffs, Cheng Poh Construction Pte Ltd ("Cheng Poh"), were a
Singapore incorporated company carrying on the business of a general
contractor undertaking building construction and major upgrading works. The
defendants, First City Builders Pte Ltd ("First City"), were also a Singapore
incorporated company involved in the construction business.

3 First City were the main contractors of a part single/part three-storey
building project at No. 51 Shipyard Road ("Shipyard Road project"). The
employers were Comfort Resources Pte Ltd. Cheng Poh were appointed by First
City as the sub-contractors in respect of the entire project for a lump sum of
$1,895,250, excluding GST.

4 Pursuant to the terms of the main contract and the sub-contract, payments to
Cheng Poh would be effected on a "back-to-back" basis. The employers would pay
First City for works done in accordance with the certificates issued by the
Architect. First City would then pay Cheng Poh the sums received from the
employers less 5% as retention monies and less a further 5% as the profit of
First City.

5 The Architect duly issued the certificates in respect of the Shipyard Road
project and First City were paid by the employers accordingly. But First City,
having paid Cheng Poh the sum of $603,735.08 in respect of the first seven
certificates, refused to pay the remainder. Cheng Poh claimed against First
City for $1,147,740.62, being the remaining sum due. First City admitted the
claim, but alleged that they had a counterclaim which in total exceeded Cheng
Poh’s claim and which they were entitled to set-off against Cheng Poh’s claim
A part of the counterclaim related to this project and that part amounted to
$565,958.62. But the other part of the counterclaim was in respect of other
projects which had nothing to do with the Shipyard Road project, the details
of which were as follows:-

> > Tuas Ave Project $130,118.83
>>

>> Lorong Limau Project $543,361.04

>>

>> Days Works(relating to these two projects) $ 84,682.52

>

>> > > > > > > > _________

>>

>> Total  _$758,162.39_

6 On an application for summary judgment, the Senior Assistant Registrar
granted Cheng Poh judgment for $580,782.00, being the difference between the
claim of Cheng Poh and the portion of the counterclaim of First City arising
out of the same project. In respect of this portion of the counterclaim by
First City, leave to defend was given to the latter.

7 The judge dismissed First City’s appeal but ordered that there be a stay of
execution on the judgment sum. He also ordered that costs be in the cause.

8 Cheng Poh appealed to the Court of Appeal only against that part of the
decision which ordered a stay of execution and the consequential order on
costs. From his written grounds of decision, the Judge took into consideration
the following facts and circumstances in ordering a stay:-

> (i) Both parties had been carrying out work for and supplying materials to
> each other and they had, in effect, been maintaining a very "loose and
> informal running account" between them, which allowed them to set-off each
> other’s claims.
>
> (ii) First City’s business would suffer grave disruption if there was no
> stay because Cheng Poh had allowed their claims to be accumulated to such a
> large sum.
>
> (iii) Any prejudice caused by a stay would not be significant because under
> the present case management in the High Court, the action would come up for
> hearing very soon.

**Issue**

9 The only issue raised before us was whether the judge, in ordering a stay of
execution, had correctly exercised his discretion under the Rules of Court
("the Rules").

**The Law**

10 Order 14 r 3(2) of the Rules provides that the court, in granting a summary
judgment, may "by order, and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be
just, stay execution of any judgment given against a defendant … until after
the trial of any counterclaim made or raised by the defendant in the action."

11 It is settled law that where claims and counterclaims arise out of the same
transaction, and while the claims are admitted and the counterclaims are
disputed, then so long as the counterclaims are plausible, the correct order
to make would be that while judgment should be entered in respect of the
claims, it should be stayed pending trial of the counterclaims: see _Sheppards
& Co v Wilkinson & Jarvis_ (1889) 6 TLR 13. But where a counterclaim does not
arise from the same transaction, or is not connected therewith, different
rules apply: e.g., _Anglian Building Products Ltd v W &C French (Construction)
Ltd_ (1978) 16 BLR 6 and _AB Contractor Ltd v Flaherty Brothers Ltd_ (1978) 16
BLR 10.

12 In the _Anglian Building Products_ case, suppliers of bridge beams issued a
writ against a construction company for £88,664.75 for beams supplied for the
construction of bridges over the M6 and M4 motorways. The construction
company, while admitting that judgment should be awarded to the suppliers,
contended that the execution of the judgment should be stayed as they had a
counterclaim arising out of similar beams supplied for the M3 motorway. Lord
Denning MR, delivering the main judgment for the Court of Appeal, held that
the counterclaim in respect of the M3 could not be used as a ground for
staying the action in respect of the beams supplied for the use in M4 and M6.

13 In _AB Contractors_ , where the facts were quite similar to our present
case, the plaintiff-contractors completed work at a building site called
Winchester Way. There was a dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendants
over measurement and/or pricing of the works. The plaintiffs issued a writ to
claim for £18,839.58. At the O 14 proceeding, the defendants conceded that
they were liable for £12,000. Judgment was accordingly entered for £12,000,
with leave to defend in respect of the remaining portion of the claim.
However, in their affidavit the defendants averred that they had a
counterclaim against the plaintiffs for an amount exceeding the judgment sum
in relation to works at another site at Hersden. Because of this, the District
Registrar ordered a stay of judgment. On appeal, Forbes J lifted the stay on
the ground that he could not see why there should be a stay on one contract if
there was a dispute on another and his decision was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal. Cumning-Bruce LJ said (at 12):-

> "I cannot see that there is such a connection between the contract at
> Winchester Way and the contract at Hersden as to make it just and equitable
> for the plaintiffs to be kept out of the money for which they have obtained
> judgment pending the resolution by the Court or by negotiation of the
> dispute arising on the Hersden contract.

14 While Stephenson LJ would not go so far as to say that there could, in no
case, be a stay on one contract if there was a dispute on another, as the
judge below seemed to have stated, he did not think on the facts in the case
that the two contracts were so closely linked that it would be fair and
equitable to deprive the plaintiffs of the fruits of the judgment.

15 _AB Contractors_ was applied in _Drake & Fletcher Ltd v Batchelor_ (1986)
83 LSG 1232 where the plaintiffs claimed against the defendant for the sum of
£13,530.41, being for goods sold and services rendered. The defendant admitted
liability for £10,061.51 and disputed the balance. The defendant also
counterclaimed alleging loss suffered, exceeding £40,000, in respect of an
allegedly defective machine sold to him by the plaintiffs. Judgment for
£10,061.51 was given, with leave to defend for the balance. A stay of
execution was refused by the District Registrar. On appeal, the refusal was
affirmed by Sir Neil Lawson, who was of the view that there was no connection
between what was claimed in the writ and the alleged counterclaim.

16 In _Koshida Trading (S) Pte Ltd v Limco Products Manufacturing Pte Ltd_
[1990] SLR 294, relying on _Drake & Fletcher v Batchelor_ and _AB Contractors_
, Chan Sek Keong J said (at 299):-

> "… the counterclaims … had no relation to the plaintiffs’ claim. They were
> separate transactions from those in respect of which the defendants admitted
> liability. These counterclaims would not entitle the defendants to a stay of
> execution, much less unconditional leave to defend."

17 The law was summarized in the 1999 edition of the _Supreme Court Practice_
, when the English rules of court were still in _pari materi_ with ours, where
the learned authors stated:-

> "If, however, the counterclaim arises out of quite a separate and distinct
> transaction or it is wholly foreign to the claim or there is no connection
> between the claim and the counterclaim, the proper order should be for
> judgment for the plaintiff with costs without a stay pending the trial of
> the counterclaim."

18 In short, special circumstances must be shown for there to be a stay of
execution. The mere fact that a defendant has a _bona fide_ counterclaim
arising out of another contract with the plaintiff, unconnected with the
contract which forms the subject matter of the action, will not of itself
constitute a "special circumstance" justifying a stay of execution.

**Instant case**

19 Reverting to the case in hand, there was nothing to suggest that the Tuas
Ave and the Lorong Limau projects (and the Days Works relating thereto) had
anything to do with the Shipyard Road project other than that they were
between the same parties. In those two projects, First City were doing work
for Cheng Poh. They were separate and distinct from the Shipyard Road project.
Furthermore, in relation to the Tuas Ave project, which involved building
works and the supply of materials for a factory extension, there were
substantial disputes between the parties, including questions as to the
applicable rates for formwork, the cost of variation works and contra charges.
As regards the Lorong Limau project, which involved the erection of two blocks
of ten-storey residential development and where First City’s work related
mainly to formwork, there were again serious disputes on various substantive
matters, including the question of liability for liquidated damages. Indeed,
on Cheng Poh’s version, their claims in those two projects exceeded those of
First City.

20 The only case cited by the court below for its decision was _Sheppards & Co
v Wilkinson & Jarvis_ (supra). But, as pointed out before, that was a case
where the claim and the counterclaim related to the same transaction. There,
the plaintiffs were stockbrokers who sued for an advance given to the
defendant to enable the latter to purchase a company. The defendant alleged
that in connection with that advance the parties had reached an agreement on
certain matters and that the plaintiffs were in breach of that agreement. The
defendant further alleged that there was fraud. The Master gave unconditional
leave to defend. The judge gave leave to defend conditional on the defendant
paying the sum claimed into court and this decision was affirmed by the
Divisional Court. On further appeal, the Court of Appeal gave judgment for the
claim, as that was not disputed, but ordered that execution on the judgment be
stayed pending the trial of the counterclaim. We think the following report of
what Lord Esher MR had stated is rather instructive:-

> "A defendant ought not to be shut out from defending unless it was very
> clear indeed that he had no case in the action under discussion. There might
> be either a defence to the claim which was plausible, or there might be a
> counter-claim pure and simple. To shut out such a counter-claim if there was
> any substance in it would be an autocratic and violent use of Order XIV. The
> Court had no power to try such a counter-claim on such an application, but
> if they thought it so far plausible that it was not unreasonably possible
> for it to succeed if brought to trial, it ought not to be excluded. If the
> counter-claim was for a less sum than that claimed, then judgment might be
> signed if there was no real defence for so much of the amount of the claim
> as was not covered by the counter-claim; but if the counter-claim overtopped
> the claim and was really plausible, then the rule, which had been often
> acted upon at Chambers, of allowing the defendant to defend without
> conditions was the right one. There were, however, circumstances which might
> call on the Court, as in the present case, to act differently. If it was
> clear that the claim must succeed, and there was really no defence to it,
> and the plaintiff would only be put to expense in proving his claim, then
> there ought to be judgment on the claim, but the matter must be so dealt
> with that defendants who had a plausible counter-claim must not be injured.
> That could be done by staying execution on the judgment until the counter-
> claim had been tried. In the present case there was no doubt that the
> plaintiffs were entitled to this £7,500, and there was no real defence to
> their claim, and although there might not be any great expense incurred in
> proving that claim, yet, in his opinion, they ought to have judgment for
> that amount. But, on the other hand, the defendants had a counter-claim
> which overtopped the amount claimed. He would express no opinion as to the
> counter-claim, but he would not say that it was absolutely impossible that
> it should succeed.."

21 However, in the present case, that part of the counterclaim in issue
related to entirely different contracts. Thus, the principles elucidated by
Lord Esher MR could have no application.

22 We now turn to consider the main points which made the judge below order a
stay. First, he was of the view that the parties had "in effect been
maintaining a very loose and informal running account, setting off or
deducting each other’s claims." Of course, if there was, in fact, such an
arrangement, that would have indicated a connection between the claim and the
counterclaim, warranting a stay. However, as counsel for Cheng Poh quite
correctly pointed out, there was nothing in the pleadings, nor in the
affidavits filed by both parties, which suggested that there was such a "loose
and informal running account". Whereas, in respect of the Shipyard Road
project, payments to Cheng Poh were to be in accordance with the Architect’s
certificate, there was no such certification procedure in respect of the Tuas
Avenue and Lorong Limau projects. First City themselves did not suggest that
there was some sort of running account. The mere fact that the same parties
entered into several separate transactions does not _ipso facto_ suggest that
there was a running acount. Upon specific enquiry by this court, counsel for
First City was unable to point to any fact which indicated the existence of
such an arrangement. In the circumstances, it was our respectful opinion that
it was not open to the Judge to infer that there existed such an arrangement.

23 Second, the court below felt that there was delay on the part of Cheng Poh
to pursue their right to payments. Counsel for Cheng Poh pointed out that the
delay was only some five months. First City started to withhold payment
commencing from the 8th certificate dated 8 November 2001. The last
certificate (the 12th certificate) was dated 7 March 2002. Action was
commenced on 15 April 2002. There was no inordinate delay. It was not
unlikely, as was suggested by counsel for Cheng Poh, that the parties engaged
in discussions to persuade First City to pay without resort to litigation.

24 In the building industry, prompt payment to contractors/sub-contractors is
the lifeblood of their trade. The fact that a sub-contractor has exercised
some restraint is no reason to deny him his just due.

25 Third, the court below was of the view that the grant of a stay would not
cause significant prejudice to Cheng Poh as, under the present case management
in the High Court, the action would come up for hearing very soon. We did not
think this was a relevant consideration. A stay should only be granted where
there are special circumstances warranting it, e.g., the several transactions
are in some ways connected, such as where there is the maintenance of a
running account.

**Judgment**

26 It is clear that when a court grants a stay of execution it is exercising a
discretion. It is also settled law that an appellate court should not
interfere with the exercise of this discretion unless the Judge below has
misdirected himself on a matter of principle or took into account matters
which he ought not to have done or failed to take into account matters which
he ought to have done or the decision is plainly wrong, e.g., _The Vishva
Apurva_ [1992] 2 SLR 175; _Nomura Regionalisation Venture Fund Ltd v Ethical
Investments Ltd_ [2000] 4 SLR 46. Applying these principles, and for the
reasons given above, there was plainly no basis to order a stay of execution.
With respect, it was our opinion that the Judge below had erred on facts and
had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken into account.

27 In the result, we allowed the appeal and lifted the stay, with costs to
Cheng Poh both here and before the High Court.
