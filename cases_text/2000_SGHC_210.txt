**JUDGMENT:**

**Gounds of Judgment**

1\. Registrar’s Appeal No 600224 of 2000 ("RA 600224/2000") is an appeal
against the decision of an assistant registrar dismissing the plaintiffs’
application for extension of time to file and serve the reference to registrar
for assessment of damages ("reference"). I allowed the appeal on 11 July 2000.
Registrar’s Appeal No 600197 of 2000 ("RA 600197/2000") is an appeal against
the decision of another assistant registrar ordering that the reference filed
on 13 April 2000 be struck out and/or removed from the court file and that the
letter of guarantee dated 31 January 1992 issued by Mitsui Marine & Fire
Insurance Co Ltd and the letter of undertaking dated 19 August 1995 issued by
Britannia Steamship Insurance Association Ltd be returned to the defendants’
solicitors. I heard this appeal immediately after RA 600224/2000 and allowed
it. The defendants have given notice of appeal in respect of both appeals and
these are my written grounds.

2\. In this action commenced by writ issued on 29 January 1992 the plaintiffs
claim damages arising out of a collision between the defendants’ vessel
"Bonito" and the plaintiffs’ vessel "Ah Lam II". On 12 September 1996 the
defendants served on the plaintiffs an offer to settle the plaintiffs’ claim
fully and finally. On 27 November 1996 they confirmed that they had no claim
against the plaintiffs and on 4 December 1996 the plaintiffs gave notice of
acceptance of the offer. Under the terms of settlement the defendants would
pay the plaintiffs 50% of the plaintiffs’ claim in this action as proved or
agreed together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from 28
January 1992 to the date of the offer and unless the quantum of damages
claimed was agreed there was to be a reference to the registrar to assess
damages.

3\. On 27 March 1997 there was a pre-trial conference but no agreement had yet
been reached by then. Counsel for the defendants informed the court that
liability had been settled and that the parties were likely to agree on
quantum once the documents were completed and counsel for the plaintiffs said
that prospects of settlement were good. Nevertheless it was ordered that the
plaintiffs file a notice of discontinuance by 12 July 1997 failing which they
were to file a notice of appointment for damages to be assessed by 19 July
1997 failing which the action was to stand dismissed with costs.

4\. On 4 July 1997 the plaintiffs’ solicitors delivered to the defendants’
solicitors a statement containing a claim under 32 heads of claim supported by
75 documents in 30 annexes or bundles. This was done no doubt with a view to
reaching agreement on quantum but not having heard further from the
defendants’ solicitors the plaintiffs applied for extension of time fixed by
the order of 27 March 1997. At the hearing on 18 July 1997 counsel for the
defendants said the documents were only received on 4 July 1997 and that the
parties were actively working on a settlement. An order was made extending to
30 August 1997 the time to file the notice of appointment for damages to be
assessed. The notice of appointment was the reference and to avoid confusion I
shall refer to it as the reference.

5\. On the same day that the order was made extending time the defendants’
solicitors requested further information and documents in respect of the
plaintiffs’ claim. On 28 July 1997 the plaintiffs filed an application to
further extend time but the application was only fixed for hearing on 3
September 1997. Meanwhile on 19 August 1997 the plaintiffs’ solicitors
provided further information in respect of part of the claim and they also
filed and served on the defendants a list of documents and an affidavit
verifying the list. On 27 August 1997 they complied with the defendants’
request for further information and documents and also provided further claim
documents. The list of documents and the affidavit verifying the list were
presumably filed and served with a view to proceeding with the reference and
in anticipation of directions being given.

6\. When the plaintiffs’ application came on for hearing on 3 September 1997
it was not opposed by the defendants and an order was made extending the time
to 30 November 1997 for the reference to be filed. On 9 September 1997 less
than a week after time had been extended the defendants’ solicitors again
requested further information and documents in respect of part of the claim.
Presumably the request was made with a view to "working on a settlement".

7\. There was no response to the defendants’ last request for further
information and documents and about one and a half years later on 11 March
1999 the defendants’ solicitors informed the plaintiffs’ solicitors that the
action had been dismissed. They referred to the orders of 27 March 1997, 18
July 1997 and 3 September 1997. The plaintiffs’ solicitors did not agree and
there was an exchange of correspondence as to the effect of the several orders
made. Subsequently the plaintiffs changed solicitors but in reality there was
no change as it was a case of the solicitor personally having the conduct of
the matter retiring from one firm and being admitted to another and continuing
to have personal conduct of the matter.

8\. On 20 March 2000 the plaintiffs’ solicitors submitted a revised breakdown
of the claim and the supporting documents and requested the defendants’
response within 14 days. On 22 March 2000 the defendants’ solicitors repeated
their assertion that the action had been dismissed and on 17 May 2000 the
plaintiffs filed an application for further extension of time to file and
serve the reference. On 9 June 2000 the application was dismissed and the
plaintiffs now appeal to this court.

9\. The plaintiffs’ case is that the action had not been dismissed for failure
to comply with an "unless order". Mr Chua referred to the order of 27 March
1997 and the subsequent orders of 18 July 1997 and 3 September 1997. He said
that while the first order was expressed as an "unless order" the second and
third orders were not. They merely extended time without any default
provision. He referred to _Hitachi Sales (UK) Ltd v Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd_
[1986] 2 Ll LR 574.

10\. In _Hitachi Sales_ the order made was in these terms:

> "Unless the Defendants do serve within 14 days the Further and Better
> Particulars of the Points of Defence … the Points of Defence be struck out,
> and the Plaintiffs be at liberty to enter judgment against the Defendants
> for damages to be assessed ...."

The order was made on 13 May 1985, drawn up and date-stamped 16 May 1985 and
served a few days later. The further and better particulars were not served
and on 29 May 1985 judgment was signed in default. O 42 r 2(1) of the Rules of
the Supreme Court then in force provided:

> "… a judgment or order which requires a person to do an act must specify the
> time after service of the judgment or order, or some other time, within
> which the act is to be done."

O’Connor LJ said at p 579:

> "… the basis must be that the party against whom [the order] is made knows
> of its existence, the order must be unambiguous and specify the time limit
> from a starting time."

The order dated 16 May 1985 did not specify a starting time for the 14 days
and it was held that it did not comply with the requirement and the defendants
were entitled to an order setting aside the judgment _ex debito justitiae_.

11\. _Hitachi Sales_ was not concerned with a subsequent order extending time
after an "unless order" that complied with O 42 r 2(1) (in pari materia with
the local O 42 r 6(1) ) had been made and it does not directly assist the
plaintiffs. I wholly accept though that an order to which O 42 r 6(1) applies
must be unambiguous and it must be unambiguous not only in terms of the time
within which the act required to be done must be done but also in terms of the
consequence of any failure to do the act within the time fixed. The
consequence contended for by the defendants is the most serious and far
reaching. The action is to stand dismissed even though an offer to settle has
been accepted.

12\. The order of 27 March 1997 was not drawn up and entered. It ought to have
been. See O 42 r 9(1). It was an "unless order" and r 9(2) does not apply to
such an order. See _Hitachi Sales_ at p 576. The assistant registrar’s minute
of the order states:

> "Plaintiffs to file and serve Notice of Discontinuance by 12 July 97,
> failing which Plaintiffs to file Notice of Appointment for Damages to be
> assessed by 19 July 97, failing which action stands dismissed with costs."

As noted above counsel for the defendants had said that the parties had agreed
on liability and were likely to agree on damages and counsel for the
plaintiffs had said that prospects of settlement were good. The plaintiffs
were not in default. Under the terms of settlement a reference to the
registrar to assess damages would only arise if and when damages could not be
agreed and that event had not occurred yet. I think an "unless order" ought
not to have been made at that stage but it was made and it would be too late
now to take exception to it.

13\. The application that led to the order of 18 July 1997 was for an order
that:

> "The time for the Plaintiffs to file and serve the Notice of appointment for
> assessment of damages be extended to 19 October 1997."

The grounds of the application as stated in the notice included this
statement:

> "The parties have reached agreement on the apportionment of liability and
> are now actively engaged in negotiating the issue of quantum of their
> respective claims.
>
> A short deferment of the date of filing the Notice of Appointment for
> Assessment of Damages would not only give the parties a better chance in
> coming to an amicable settlement but also avoid incurring further cost in
> subjecting the issue of the quantum of their respective claims before the
> Court for assessment."

According to the assistant registrar’s note of the proceedings counsel for the
defendants said:

> "No objections ….
>
> Parties are actively working to settle."

The minute of the order made states:

> "OIT.
>
> Extension granted and limited to a period of 6 weeks from 19 July 97."

Time was extended to 30 August 1997. This order was not drawn up.

14\. O 42 r 9(2) provides:

> "An order –
>

>> (a) which –

>

>> > (i) extends the period within which a person is required or authorised by
these Rules, or by any judgment, order or direction, to do any act; … and

>

>> (b) which neither imposes any special terms nor includes any special
directions other than a direction as to costs,

>
> need not be drawn up unless the Court otherwise directs."

This rule applies to the order of 18 July 1997 and there was no direction that
it should be drawn up. There were no special terms or special directions. It
was quite properly not drawn up. This rule does not apply to an "unless order"
which imposes special terms.

15\. The application that led to the order of 3 September 1997 was for an
order to extend time to 30 November 1997 and the grounds stated on the
application included this statement:

> "The parties have been exchanging correspondence and are in the process of
> negotiating a settlement of the Plaintiffs’ claim on documents provided by
> the Plaintiffs to the Defendants. The Plaintiffs are requesting for a short
> deferment of the date to file and serve the Reference to the Registrar for
> Assessment of Damages in order to give them an opportunity to fully address
> the various queries raised by the Defendants on the Plaintiffs’ earlier
> forwarded claim documents."

As earlier noted the application was not opposed by the defendants and the
assistant registrar’s minute of the order only recorded that an order in terms
of the application was made. Again in accordance with O 42 r 9(2) this order
was not drawn up. There were no special terms or special directions.

16\. Having regard to the terms of the orders made and the circumstances
surrounding the making of the orders and the grounds of the applications for
extension of time it must be at least doubtful whether the order of 3
September 1997 extending time to 30 November 1997 read with the orders of 27
March 1997 and 18 July 1997 was an "unless order". I do not think that it was.
I also do not think that the "unless order" of 27 March 1997 can be read as if
the date 30 November 1997 was substituted for the original date 19 July 1997.
When the plaintiffs applied on 9 June 2000 for a further extension of time the
action had not been dismissed pursuant to the order of 27 March 1997 or to any
other order and the application ought to have been heard on its merits.

17\. Mr Chua submitted that the application for further extension of time
ought to be allowed in view of the absence of prejudice suffered by the
defendants as a result of the delay. He referred to _The Tokai Maru_[1998] 3
SLR 105 where Tan Lee Meng J (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal)
said at para 37:

> "The power to strike out an action for abuse of process is thus to be
> exercised only in cases of an exceptional nature. We are of the view that
> the delay in the instant case cannot be characterised as an abuse of
> process, as was contended by the respondents."

He also referred to _Costellow v Somerset County Council_[1993] 1 All ER 952
_._

18\. In _The Tokai Maru_ the defendants (respondents in the appeal) and the
third parties (appellants) were ordered to file and exchange their affidavits
for the purpose of the trial by 11 October 1996. The appellants defaulted.
They filed their affidavit and purportedly served it on the respondents only
several months later on 1 July 1997. The respondents refused to serve their
affidavits in exchange. The appellants applied for extension of time for
filing and exchanging affidavits. The respondents applied to strike out the
appellants’ defence in the third party proceedings. The learned judge in the
High Court dismissed the appellant’s application and allowed the respondents’
application. He struck out the defence and made the usual orders for judgment
and costs. In the Court of Appeal Tan Lee Meng J said at para 21 that the
principles applicable to the case were to be found in _Costellow_. Continuing
at para 23 he said:

> "… these principles are as follows:
>
> (a) ….
>
> (b) The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and litigants towards the
> just resolution of the case and should of course be adhered to. Nonetheless,
> a litigant should not be deprived of his opportunity to dispute the
> plaintiff’s claims and have a determination of the issues on the merits as a
> punishment for a breach of these rules unless the other party has been made
> to suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated for by an appropriate order
> as to costs.
>
> (c) Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances, it can rarely be
> appropriate then, on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny
> a defendant an extension of time where the denial would have the effect of
> depriving him of his defence because of a procedural default which, even if
> unjustified, has caused the plaintiff no prejudice for which he cannot be
> compensated by an award of costs."

I think that with appropriate changes involving the substitution of
"plaintiff" for "defendant" these principles apply to the case before me.

19\. If the plaintiffs are denied an extension of time they will be deprived
of their right to a reference to the registrar to assess damages. An offer to
settle fully and finally as regards liability has been made by the defendants
in accordance with the rules and the offer has been accepted and it would be
quite extraordinary that the defendants should have been bound to pay but will
not have to pay anything because the amount cannot be ascertained.

20\. The substantial part of the plaintiffs’ claim is for loss of hire and the
market value of the tug. Mr Seah said that it would be more difficult to
obtain the evidence now than if the orders had been complied with. I am unable
to agree. The evidence is not in relation to events as to which specific
witnesses would have to be called and their memory is likely to be affected by
passage of time. The evidence is in relation to rates of hire and the value of
a tug prevailing at the material time and I should have thought that a
surveyor or any competent person would be in no worse position to testify as
to these matters if the assessment of damages is proceeded with now rather
than in November 1997.

21\. Since July 1997 the plaintiffs have been providing the defendants with
information and documents relating to their claim. It has not been suggested
that the information or documents were inadequate although the defendants have
called for further information and documents and they did that each time after
time had been extended to file the reference. They were "actively working to
settle". I think they would have obtained or "worked at" obtaining the
necessary evidence and if they had not done so then they cannot be heard to
complain that they had lost the opportunity to do so or been otherwise
prejudiced.

22\. The defendants are the owners of the "Bonito". They have provided an
undertaking given by a P & I club in addition to a guarantee given by an
insurer. These parties are I think the "real" defendants. They are not
unaccustomed to having to dispute claims before the courts and before other
tribunals. They were prepared to make some payment and only desired to have
the amount agreed or assessed by the court failing agreement. I asked Mr Seah
and he was unable to say that the delay was in some other way prejudicial to
the defendants or the "real defendants" than only as regards evidence.

23\. Having regard to all the circumstances I am satisfied that an extension
of time as asked for by the plaintiffs will not cause any prejudice to the
defendants for which they cannot be compensated by an award of costs. An
extension of time in favour of one party in a sense causes an injustice to the
other just as the refusal to grant an extension of time causes an injustice to
the party out of time but here I think the balance of justice favours the
making of an order to extend time. It remains to consider whether this is a
special case or if there are any exceptional circumstances to refuse the
extension of time asked for.

24\. Under the terms of settlement there would only be a reference to the
registrar to assess damages if the parties cannot reach an agreement. The
plaintiffs submitted a claim under 32 heads and they provided information and
documents in support of the claim. They later revised the claim under 34 heads
but otherwise the revision did not result in a departure from the original
claim. The defendants called for further information and documents. Quite
clearly both parties were engaged in negotiations to reach an agreement as to
damages. The defendants themselves said so.

25\. After the order was last made for extension of time the defendants called
for more information and documents. It has not been suggested that without
these they were unable to consider the plaintiffs’ claim but the plaintiffs
could have provided the further information and documents last asked for or
applied for more time to do so or they could have treated the negotiations as
at an end and proceeded with the assessment of damages if they could not
provide the information or documents. They could have taken one of these steps
before 30 November 1997 to which day time was last extended or some time after
that. To do so more than two years later is hardly justifiable but I do not
think that this is so special a case or that the circumstances are so
exceptional that it can be right to deny the plaintiffs an extension of time.

26\. In my judgment the plaintiffs ought to have been granted an extension of
time. I accordingly allowed the appeal save as regards costs and extended the
time for filing the reference to expire immediately after 13 April 2000 which
was the day the reference was in fact filed. I further ordered the plaintiffs
to issue a summons for directions for the further conduct of the assessment of
damages within two weeks of the order and made an order for costs which I
considered appropriate in the circumstances. Having regard to my decision in
RA 600224/2000 the parties agreed that it would follow that the appeal in RA
600197/2000 should also be allowed. I agree. I allowed the appeal save as
regards costs. The effect was to dismiss the defendants’ application for the
reference filed on 13 April 2000 to be struck out and for the guarantee and
undertaking to be returned.
