Choo Han Teck J:

1 This was an appeal against an order made by the Family Court in the parties’
divorce concerning the division of proceeds from the sale of their HDB flat.
The appellant/husband and the respondent/wife are both 71 years old. They
registered their marriage on 18 July 1966. The wife claims that a traditional
marriage according to Chinese customary rites took place in 1962, but that is
not material to the appeal. They have six adult children between the ages of
40 and 49. One of their daughters was the intervener in the divorce
proceedings. Interim judgment was granted on 3 February 2012.

2 The HDB flat in question was purchased in 2003 by the husband, the wife and
the daughter who intervened in the ancillary matters heard below. All three of
them used their CPF monies. The daughter contributed more than $100,000, the
husband contributed $5,000 and the wife contributed $4,266. When the daughter
married in August 2007 she withdrew her name from the flat. As a consequence,
she was obliged to return $119,232.29 to the CPF, being the amount of CPF
monies which she used to pay for the flat plus accrued interest. She did so by
taking a loan from her husband. She intervened in the ancillary matters to
claim $119,232.29 out of the proceeds from the sale of the flat. She did not
claim any proprietary interest in the flat.

3 On 26 March 2013 the Family Court gave its decision in the ancillary
matters. The court ordered that the flat be sold, and that $119,232.29 be paid
to the daughter. Of the sale proceeds remaining after payment of sale expenses
and refunds to the parties’ CPF accounts, $110,000 was to be paid to the
husband and the rest would go to the wife. At the hearing before me, counsel
estimated that the wife would receive $259,537. In his grounds of decision the
judge below explained that the wife’s portion consisted of lump sum
maintenance in addition to her share of the matrimonial assets. In his view,
the wife was entitled to lump sum maintenance of $60,000, being $1,000 a month
for five years.

4 Before me the husband asked for his portion to be increased to $200,000 so
that he could purchase a studio flat. He said that he was no longer working as
a taxi driver. He also said that none of the six children were willing to
support him financially because their allegiance belonged to the wife, a point
which the wife did not dispute. In my opinion, these circumstances were
relevant to the question of how much maintenance he ought to pay to the wife.
The husband might be able to compel the children to support him financially
under the Maintenance of Parents Act (Cap 167B, 1996 Rev Ed), but that is in
the nature of a last resort, to be avoided as far as possible. In the first
place, I accepted that the husband’s financial situation was not the
healthiest, given his unemployment and the improbability of his job prospects
being promising at his age. On the other hand, the wife could expect all the
children to help her meet her expenses whereas the husband could not expect
similar help. I am therefore of the opinion thought that it would be
inappropriate to order that the husband pay the wife any substantial
maintenance. I was of the view that the husband should pay the wife nominal
maintenance of $1 a month in lieu of $60,000 by way of lump sum maintenance.

5 I thus ordered that the husband’s portion of proceeds from the sale of the
flat be increased from $110,000 to $170,000. In effect, this would mean
dividing the proceeds in the proportions of 46% to the husband and 54% to the
wife. I thought that this was reasonable. I made no order as to costs.
