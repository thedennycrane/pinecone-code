Tan Puay Boon JC:

Introduction

1 The plaintiff (“Husband”) and the defendant (“Wife”) (collectively “the
parties”) were married on 1 October 2005 in France. 1

and the Husband filed a writ for divorce on 9 October 2017. Interim Judgment
(“IJ”) was granted on 26 January 2018, on the ground that the Wife has behaved
in such a way that the Husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with her,
and vice versa. This ended a marriage of 12 years.

2 The matters that lie for my determination are the division of matrimonial
assets, custody, care and control of the Children, maintenance for the Wife
and the Children, and costs.

Background facts

3 The Husband is 47 years old this year. He is a French national and a
Singaporean Permanent Resident. At the time of the ancillary matters (“AM”)
hearings, he was the non-executive chairman of Company [X], which he had
founded in 2009 and in which he was previously the Chief Executive Officer. 4

##### Foot Note 4

H AOM1 at p 5.

He has been working throughout the marriage. 95% of the shares in Company [X]
were sold to a buyer in 2017, for US$17m. Under certain clauses of the Share
Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), he also obtained a further pay-out of US$3m for
meeting certain targets. Some other entitlements under the SPA are the subject
of dispute.

4 The Wife is 46 years old this year. She is a Singaporean national. At the
time of the AM hearings, she was a homemaker. However, prior to that, she was
working as a lawyer. She worked for about a year while in France, 5

5 The parties were married in France in 2005 and lived there from 2005 to
early 2009. In early 2009, the Wife moved to Singapore with Child A first,
followed by the Husband. 7

##### Foot Note 7

W AOM 1 at para 24.

At first, they rented a condominium unit in Bishan, then moved to Ang Mo Kio,
before renting an apartment near Orchard Road in 2014 (“the Orchard unit”).
The Husband left the Orchard unit in March 2017, while the Wife and Children
remained there until June 2019, when they moved to an apartment near Newton
(“the Newton unit”). 8

Minute Sheet 23 October 2019 at p 7.

While these various units were rented, the Husband had also purchased a
property near Tanglin (“the Tanglin property”) in 2013 in his sole name. 9

The parties also own a property in France (“the French property”) which they
had purchased in 2006. 10

6 In FC/SUM 3462/2017, the Husband applied for interim orders pertaining to
the custody, care and control of the Children. The learned District Judge made
certain orders and the parties also agreed to certain terms as recorded in the
Order of Court dated 24 September 2018 (FC/ORC 4982/2018 (“ORC 4982/2018”)). I
allowed an appeal against the orders pertaining to weekend access in HCF/RAS
22/2018 (“RAS 22/2018”). The orders were subsequently varied by the District
Judge pursuant to an application in FC/SUM 1221/2019 (the appeal in HCF/RAS
23/2019 (“RAS 23/2019”) against the variation was dismissed). In gist, the
interim orders provide that the Husband and Wife share joint custody, with the
Wife granted care and control and the Husband granted access.

7 I note also for completeness that the Wife had applied in HCF/SUM 89/2020
(“SUM 89/2020”) for additional evidence to be adduced in the AM proceedings.
The evidence touched on the Husband’s new relationship, his relationship with
the Children, and his new business venture. I allowed the affidavits of both
parties in that summons to stand as evidence for the AM proceedings. I
reserved costs of SUM 89/2020 to be dealt with together with the AM
proceedings.

Division of matrimonial assets

8 I first consider the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets under s
112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).

9 There are two methodologies of dividing matrimonial assets, as set out in NK
v NL [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“NK”) at [31]–[33]: the global assessment
methodology and the classification methodology. The global assessment
methodology comprises four distinct steps: identification, valuation, division
and apportionment (of the matrimonial assets). On the other hand, the
classification methodology first divides the matrimonial assets into separate
classes before applying the four steps above in relation to each class of
assets.

10 Both the Husband and the Wife accepted that the global assessment
methodology should be applied in the present case. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

Minute Sheet 23 October 2019 at p 2.

As I see no reason to apply the classification methodology in this case, I
will adopt the global assessment methodology.

Identification and valuation of the matrimonial assets

Operative dates for identification and valuation

11 The starting position for the date of the identification of matrimonial
assets is the IJ date, ie, 26 January 2018 (ARY v ARX and another appeal
[2016] 2 SLR 686 (“ARY”) at [31]). Both parties accepted that the IJ date is
the appropriate operative date for identification of the matrimonial assets
and 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

Minute Sheet 23 October 2019 at p 2.

there is no reason for me to depart from this.

12 As for valuation of the matrimonial assets, the default position is that
they should be valued at the date of the first AM hearing, ie, 23 October
2019: TDT v TDS and another appeal and another matter [2016] 4 SLR 145 (“TDT”)
at [50]. The Husband did not, in fact, dispute this. The argument that he
proposed was narrower and focused on the bank and CPF accounts, arguing that
those assets should be valued at the IJ date because “the [matrimonial assets]
are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves”: BUX v BUY [2019]
SGHCF 4 at [4]. The Wife’s argument appears to have focused on the fact that
many of the portfolios identified by the Husband above consisted not just of
bank accounts, but various holdings in unit trusts, shares, and securities. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

Minute Sheet 23 October 2019 at p 2.

13 I agree with the Husband that the bank and CPF accounts should be valued as
of the IJ date. The assets are not the accounts themselves, but the moneys in
the accounts. Money is, in that sense, distinct from the other categories of
assets, because its “value” is, for the purposes of the division exercise,
simply the amount of money that is available.

14 Originally, a significant dispute between the parties was in relation to
the valuation of various portfolios that the Husband had kept his assets in.
These were referred to as the “UOB Portfolio”, “Indosuez Portfolio”, “UBS
Portfolio”, and “DBS Portfolio”. The same issue arose in relation to the
parties’ Joint DBS Account No ending in 9686 (“DBS Account 9686”). These are
mixed portfolios, in that they include bank accounts and various investment
assets. As a matter of principle, therefore, I considered that the IJ date
ought to be used to value the bank accounts and their balances, while the AM
date ought to be used to value the assets. As there was little information
concerning the latter, I had asked the Husband to provide documents for the
valuation of the assets at the AM date and to correspond with the Wife
accordingly. Subsequently, counsel from both sides came to an amicable
agreement on how these portfolios were to be treated. As indicated in a letter
dated 20 August 2020 to the court, parties agreed to use the IJ date to value
the above portfolios and DBS Account 9686. As such, I have treated these
assets as agreed assets with agreed valuations, utilising the undisputed
documentary evidence to arrive at the value of these assets closest the IJ
date, with the exception of the UOB Portfolio, in respect of which the Wife
had raised other objections and sought an adverse inference to be drawn for
allegedly dissipated assets. I treat the UOB Portfolio under the section on
agreed assets with disputed valuations.

15 I deal with the identification and valuation of the matrimonial assets in
the following categories: (a) agreed assets with agreed valuations; (b) agreed
assets with disputed valuations; and (c) disputed assets.

Exchange rates

16 Where there are foreign currencies involved, I adopt the exchange rates
employed by the parties as follows: 14

##### Foot Note 14

Joint Summary of Relevant Information (“JSRI”) dated 14 September 2020 at p 8.

(a) €1 = S$1.51967; and

(b) US$1 = S$1.37506.

Agreed assets with agreed valuations

17 The agreed assets with agreed valuations are set out in the table below
(the values listed throughout this Judgment are the nett values of the
property unless otherwise stated). I have included in the table the agreed
deductions from the Husband’s assets (whether because they are agreed
liabilities or because the parties have agreed to exclude them from the pool
of matrimonial assets), but have excluded from it the declared assets that are
valued at S$0, and as these do not figure in the division exercise, I do not
refer to them throughout this Judgment.

(1) Joint Palatine Account

20 Given that this is a bank account, I adopt the Husband’s valuation of
€760.40 (~ S$1,155.56), being the balance of the account closest to the IJ
date, 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

H AOM1 at p 431.

as the appropriate valuation.

(2) Security deposit

21 The security deposit for the Orchard unit tenancy, which was paid by the
parties before the breakdown of the marriage, is a matrimonial asset, as it
should be returned to both parties. It has since been returned to the Wife’s
bank accounts after the IJ date, which means that it has not been accounted
for in the above valuations. As such, I add this sum of S$27,609.00 the pool
of matrimonial assets for division.

(3) POSB Account 8146

22 Taking the IJ date as the operative date of valuation, I find that there
was S$7,388.68 in the account as of the IJ date 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

H AOM2 at p 904.

and use this as the valuation accordingly.

(4) UOB Portfolio

23 Apart from the issue of the valuation date (which was settled by the
parties in favour of the IJ date), the Wife also contended that there was an
unexplained depreciation of the assets in the UOB Portfolio by approximately
S$9m between December 2017 and January 2018. 53

##### Foot Note 53

×

WWS at para 78.

The Husband countered that there was no unexplained depreciation. Instead,
monies from the UOB Portfolio were transferred in order to open the Indosuez
and UBS Portfolios, which are both accounted for as matrimonial assets. 54

##### Foot Note 54

×

HWS at para 118.

24 Based on the Statements of Account provided by the Husband, the total value
of the deposits and investments in the UOB Portfolio was S$24,267,316.01 as of
30 December 2017, 55

##### Foot Note 55

×

H AOM1 at p 475.

and was S$6,317,384.29 as of 31 January 2018. 56

##### Foot Note 56

×

H AOM1 at p 483.

That is a difference of S$17,949,931.72. The vast majority of the decrease was
in the deposits held in the UOB accounts. In January 2018, the Husband claimed
to have made the following transfers:

(a) US$4,500,000.00 (~S$5,953,500.00) and €3,765,000.00 (~S$6,080,475.00) from
the UOB Portfolio to UBS; and

(b) US$4,500,000.00 (~S$5,953,500.00) from the UOB Portfolio to Indosuez.

25 I find this to be supported by the documentary evidence. The statements
from the UOB accounts show two transfers of US$4,500,000 on 17 January 2018
from one account, 57

##### Foot Note 57

×

H AOM1 at p 487.

and a single transfer of €3,765,000 on the same day from another account. 58

##### Foot Note 58

×

H AOM1 at p 488.

This is also consistent with the payment orders exhibited by the Husband,
which are dated 16 January 2018. 59

##### Foot Note 59

×

H AOM1 at pp 523-525.

The statements for January 2018 in the Indosuez Portfolio show a sum of
US$4,500,000 being credited on 17 January 2018 and then split into two
separate Indosuez accounts on 18 January 2018, from which point the moneys
were used to purchase various assets or make certain subscriptions. 60

##### Foot Note 60

×

H AOM1 at pp 526–531.

The UBS Portfolio statement of assets as of 31 January 2018 also shows new
investments to the value of approximating US$4,500,000 and €3,765,000. 61

##### Foot Note 61

×

H AOM1 at pp 550–551.

I am therefore satisfied that there was no dissipation of assets and there is
no need to add assets back into the pool. The assets are sufficiently
accounted for above in the Indosuez and UBS Portfolios.

26 As noted above at [14], the parties have agreed to use the IJ date for the
valuation of this asset. Hence, I take the value of the UOB Portfolio as at 31
January 2018, being the date closest to the IJ date, which gives a value of
S$6,317,384.29. 62

##### Foot Note 62

×

H AOM1 at p 483.

(5) Husband’s CPF Accounts

27 As I have decided that the operative date for valuation is the IJ date, I
take the balance of the CPF Accounts closest to the IJ date as the valuation.
Hence, I value the CPF Ordinary Account at S$55,690.91, the CPF Medisave
Account at S$47,039.63, and the CPF Special Account at S$42,605.67.

Disputed assets and liabilities

28 The parties dispute whether the following assets and liabilities should be
included in the pool of matrimonial assets. I set out their positions,
together with the court’s conclusion, on each of these assets below.

(1) The French and Tanglin properties

29 It is not disputed that the French and Tanglin properties would constitute
matrimonial assets under s 112(10) WC. The dispute arises, however, because
the Wife claimed that the properties should be held on trust for the Children,
whereas the Husband argued that they should be divided as matrimonial assets.

30 At present, there is no trust over the French and Tanglin properties. What
the Wife sought was an order of court for the property to be held on trust for
the Children under s 112(5)(d) WC, on the basis that this was the parties’
understanding earlier in the marriage and later on when the marriage had
broken down as part of the settlement which did not materialise. 73

In response, the Husband argued that while it was discussed that the assets
would be held for the Children on trust, the settlement negotiations failed
and no agreement arose. 74

Further, s 112(5)(d) WC would generally not be exercised unless there was
consent or prior agreement for a trust to be constituted. 75

Minute Sheet 23 October 2019 at p 5.

31 In order to properly understand the nature of s 112(5)(d) WC, it is
important to see it in the context of s 112 as a whole. Section 112(1) WC sets
out the court’s power to “order the division between the parties of any
matrimonial asset or the sale or any such asset and the division between the
parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as
the court thinks just and equitable”. This power is supplemented by ss 112(3)
and (4) WC, which read:

(3) The court may make all such other orders and give such directions as may
be necessary or expedient to give effect to any order made under this section.

(4) The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or
discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or
condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.

[emphasis added]

32 It is in the context of ss 112(3) and (4) WC that s 112(5) provides a list
of orders that the court may make (without prejudice to the generality of
those previous provisions), including s 112(5)(d):

[A]n order for any matrimonial asset, or the sale proceeds thereof, to be
vested in any person (including either party) to be held on trust for such
period and on such terms as may be specified in the order …

33 Seen in this light, s 112(5) WC only provides examples of orders that
supplement and give effect to the primary orders under s 112(1) WC for the
division of matrimonial assets. The court is not entitled to pre-empt the
division exercise and to declare certain assets as held on trust. Instead, the
court must undertake the division exercise according to what is just and
equitable. It is only after deciding on the appropriate orders to be made,
that a court can then consider what other orders (including an order under s
112(5)(d) WC) are necessary or expedient to give effect to the orders for
division. Hence, in the present case, the French and Tanglin properties could
not be removed from the division exercise simply by the declaration of a trust
over the properties in favour of the Children. They had to be considered as
part of the division exercise, following which, if necessary or expedient, a
trust could be declared in order to give effect to the division order made
under s 112 WC. Therefore, I consider that the French and Tanglin properties
should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets for division. In the
absence of an existing trust over the properties, it was not within the
court’s power to order that the properties be held on trust before considering
how the matrimonial assets should be divided.

34 It is convenient for me to now deal with the closely linked issue of
whether a trust would ultimately be appropriate in this case. I do not see any
facts that suggest that a trust would be necessary to give effect to the
division of matrimonial assets. First, the Wife referred to an alleged
agreement and common understanding between the parties that the properties
would be held on trust. I was not pointed to any evidence of such an agreement
– the Husband is correct to say that positions taken during negotiations were
not sufficient, since there is no evidence of a settled agreement on this
issue. 76

As for the French property, while there was some indication that they had
wanted to “donate” the property to the Children, this was never executed. 77

##### Foot Note 77

H AOM1 at p 10.

In any case, even if there was such an agreement, I do not consider that the
court must give effect to such an agreement in every case, as it is ultimately
a question of whether it is necessary or expedient to order a trust over the
properties to give effect to the division orders.

35 Second, the Wife claimed that the trust arrangement would “ensure[] that
the Children’s future is secured”, 78

##### Foot Note 78

given that the Husband may take on financial risks in the future. However, the
division exercise is not primarily concerned with the Children’s future well-
being, but with the fair apportionment between husband and wife of the
economic fruits of the marriage. The concerns raised by the Wife are better
addressed under the issue of maintenance, if at all. In this regard, it must
be recognised that an order under s 112(5)(d) WC is different from the power
to order security to be furnished for the purposes of providing maintenance,
under s 115(2) WC. Section 112(5)(d) WC is intended to give effect to the
division exercise, not to ensure that sufficient assets remain available for
the payment of maintenance. In any case, given the total value of the assets
involved, the risk highlighted by the Wife is not significant.

36 Therefore, I also conclude that it is not necessary or expedient for the
purpose of giving effect to the orders for division to order that the French
and Tanglin properties be held on trust under s 112(5)(d) WC.

37 Having decided that the French and Tanglin properties are to be added to
the pool of matrimonial assets, I turn to their valuations. The parties have
agreed to value the Tanglin property at S$2,750,759.80, 79

##### Foot Note 79

JSRI at p 17.

which is the net value of the property. However, there is a dispute over the
net value of the French property. The joint valuation showed that the value of
the property as €550,000.00. The Husband urged the court to deduct the loan
that was repaid by a lump sum after the IJ date, such that the net value of
the property would be €385,927.69. The Wife proposed that the gross value of
the property be used, since the loan has been completely repaid. As the loan
was repaid after the IJ date but before the AM date, and as I have valued the
bank accounts at the IJ date, I decide to deduct the loan that was repaid,
because that amount would be adequately accounted for in valuation of the bank
accounts. Otherwise, there would be a double-counting of the amount in the
bank account at the IJ date and of the amount used to pay off the debt by the
AM date. Therefore, I adopt the Husband’s valuation of €385,927.69 (being
€550,000 - €164,072.31 80

(2) Car

38 The parties had initially agreed to include a car valued at S$273,000.00 as
a matrimonial asset to be divided. 82

##### Foot Note 82

JSRI at p 14.

The car was later traded in and the sum of S$205,000.00 was given to the Wife
in September 2020. At this point, a dispute arose as to whether the Husband,
in seeking the Wife’s agreement for the trade-in, had agreed to exclude the
proceeds from the pool of matrimonial assets. No affidavits were filed, but
screenshots of messages were presented as part of correspondence from the
parties. Having considered the material before me, I do not find that the
Husband had agreed to exclude the proceeds from the pool of matrimonial assets
– his statement that the proceeds were the Wife’s assets can be understood to
refer to the fact that the car was always to be treated as an asset in her
name for the purposes of division. In any case, as noted above, the principle
for identification is that the assets should be identified at the date of the
IJ. Therefore, I find that the car should be considered as part of the pool.
As for the sum of the proceeds, it was agreed between parties that the Wife
received S$205,000.00. I use this sum as the valuation of the car as I
consider it to be the better approximation of the value of the car as of the
AM hearing date.

(3) Loans owing to the Wife’s sister

39 The Wife argued that her debt of S$601,424.35 owing to her sister should be
deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets. She contended that this loan was
taken from her sister as she had to support the family, pay for legal fees,
and to pay her rent. 83

##### Foot Note 83

×

Minute Sheet 23 October 2019 at p 7; WWS at paras 80–81.

The Husband disputed this, on the basis that the debt was purely the Wife’s
and was taken after the IJ date.

40 I agree with the Husband. First, the loan was taken after the IJ date.
Prima facie, therefore, this was a liability incurred after the date on which
the matrimonial assets were to be identified, and should not be included in
the pool. Second, even if part of the purpose of the loan was to support
herself and the Children, it is undisputed that the Husband did voluntarily
provide a sum for maintenance each month. Insofar as she complained that the
maintenance was insufficient, it was open for her to apply to court for an
order relating to maintenance. No such application was filed. She chose to
take the loan from her sister instead, and there is no basis for the court to
now say that the Husband ought to have paid maintenance to her to the tune of
around S$600,000 and that the whole liability should be accounted for in the
pool of matrimonial assets. Since it was her unilateral decision to incur that
liability for her own expenses, it is fair to both parties that she bears the
liability herself. Otherwise, spouses in her position may be able to
unilaterally impose liabilities on the other spouse simply by taking out loans
rather than applying for interim maintenance orders, which would bypass the
safeguard of having judicial oversight of maintenance. In any event, insofar
as the loan was used to pay her legal fees for the divorce, recovery of legal
fees in this manner is not permissible.

(4) Shares in Company [X]

41 There are two sets of shares in Company [X] that are the subject of
dispute: one set of 2,500 ordinary shares that the Company [X]’s buyer would
issue to the Husband if the 2018 KPIs are met (which I refer to as the “2018
KPI Shares”) and one set of 2,974 ordinary shares that are conditional on the
2019 KPIs being met (the “2019 KPI Shares”). The KPIs for both sets of shares
were essentially (1) meeting a certain level of consolidated income less
expenses, and (2) meeting a certain number of monthly active users for the
application developed by Company [X].

42 The Wife argued that the shares in Company [X] which will be issued to the
Husband upon the KPIs being met should be included in the pool of matrimonial
assets. This was so because the SPA under which the 95% of shares in Company
[X] was sold was executed during the marriage. The sale was therefore done
during the marriage and any consideration from the sale should be considered a
matrimonial asset. The Wife cited cl 3.1 of the SPA, which defined the
consideration as follows: 84

##### Foot Note 84

×

H AOM1 at p 1163.

The aggregate consideration for the sale and purchase of the Sale Shares under
this Agreement shall be an amount in cash equal to the sum of US$17,000,000,
as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Clause 5 (the
“Consideration”) and which shall be paid in accordance with Clauses 4.3 and 5.

[emphasis in original]

43 The Wife pointed out that cl 5 includes cl 5.4, which provides for the 2018
KPI Shares and 2019 KPI Shares under cl 5.4.1(ii) and cl 5.4.1(iii)
respectively. Similarly, the adjustment of US$3m which the Husband received
under cl 5.4.1(i) was not disputed by the Husband to be matrimonial assets,
and therefore, the same logic should apply to the 2018 and 2019 KPI shares. 85

##### Foot Note 85

WWS at para 74.

In any event, the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares could be analogised to an
entitlement for vesting of shares in the future, analogous to an unvested
stock option, which has been treated as a matrimonial asset in Chan Teck Hock
David v Leong Mei Chuan [2002] 1 SLR(R) 76 (“Chan Teck Hock”) and AFS v AFU
[2011] 3 SLR 275 (“AFS”). 86

##### Foot Note 86

×

WWS at para 76.

I note here that AFS did not deal with the question of whether stock options
should be treated as matrimonial assets as such, but was concerned with the
identification of direct and indirect contributions towards the acquisition of
shares and moneys which had been funded by the exercise of a previously
granted stock option: AFS at [52]. Hence, I do not address this case further.

44 I first consider the Wife’s argument that the shares under cl 5.4.1(ii) and
cl 5.4.1(iii) should be treated as consideration for the purchase of the
Husband’s 95% share in Company [X]. The Wife’s argument appears to be that
since Company [X] was founded during the marriage, the shares held by the
Husband were all matrimonial assets, and the consideration for the sale of the
shares should be included into the pool as matrimonial assets as well. In my
judgment, the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares should not be included as matrimonial
assets on this basis.

45 In the first place, I note that the wording of cl 3.1 of the SPA is
ambiguous as it refers to the entirety of cl 5, but only cl 5.3 and cl
5.4.1(i) refer to any adjustment to the consideration. Clause 5.3 refers to
this in the heading, while cl 5.4.1(i) includes the sentence: “For the
avoidance of doubt, the payment of such US$3,000,000 to the Seller [ie, the
Husband] shall be regarded as an adjustment to the Consideration”. In
contrast, there is no such reference in cll 5.4.1(ii) and (iii). In other
words, it is not entirely clear from the wording of the contract whether
everything in cl 5 is intended to be an adjustment to the consideration, or
whether it is only specific clauses within cl 5 that should have that effect.
As the buyer of the shares has clarified in a response to a letter from the
Husband’s solicitors (requested by the court), 87

##### Foot Note 87

×

Attached to letter from Husband’s solicitors dated 5 November 2019.

cll 5.4.1(ii) and 5.4.1(iii) were not intended to be consideration for the
purchase of the Husband’s shares, but were intended to be “performance
incentives” for the Husband. For the purposes of these proceedings, I prefer
the buyer’s interpretation, since the buyer is a third-party at arm’s length
and this interpretation accords with the absence of reference to adjustment to
consideration in cll 5.4.1(ii) and (iii) (in contrast to cl 5.4.1(i)).

46 In any case, in my view, the Wife’s argument is not entirely accurate as it
is not the entire consideration that should automatically be treated as
matrimonial assets. The concept of consideration is not entirely equivalent to
the concept of sale price. In other words, there may be payments that are
promised as part of the consideration for the sale of the shares which are not
intended to be part of the sale price of the shares -– the payments are
“consideration” for the shares in the sense of deriving contractual force from
the sale, but are not meant to reflect the value of the shares directly. This
is so in the present case.

47 Having decided that the entitlement to the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares should
not be matrimonial assets simply on the basis of the SPA, I deal next with the
Wife’s argument that the Husband’s entitlement to the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares
should be treated as stock options and included as matrimonial assets
accordingly. The Court of Appeal in Chan Teck Hock ([43] supra) at [28]-[29]
held that unvested stock options, ie, “a contract to grant an option upon
fulfilment of a condition”, were choses in action that could be treated as
matrimonial assets under s 112(10) WC. By analogy, I accept that in principle,
the contractual entitlement to shares upon fulfilment of certain conditions
could be treated as matrimonial assets. However, the question is whether the
specific entitlements in question should be considered matrimonial assets. For
that question, the Court of Appeal’s further guidance in Chan Teck Hock at
[37] is instructive:

We would hasten to add that even as between the second and third categories of
stock options, there is a need to differentiate between them. Whereas, in
respect of the second category stock options, they were already vested (ie
already earned), the same is not so in respect of the third category stock
options. The husband had to continue rendering services to Dell beyond the
date of the decree nisi to acquire the options. So in respect of these third
category stock options, they were given not just for services rendered prior
to the decree nisi but also for services to be rendered post the decree.
Otherwise there would have been no necessity to postdate the vesting of
options. In this regard, we would adopt the “time rule” advocated in Hug ([19]
supra) by the Court of Appeal of California. The effect of that rule is to
treat only that portion of the stock options as matrimonial assets as is
obtained by multiplying the stock options in question by the fraction obtained
between the period in months between the commencement of the husband’s
employment with Dell and the date of the decree nisi as the numerator and the
period in months between his commencement of the employment with Dell and the
date when the stock option was exercisable by him as the denominator. Only
that portion of the third category stock options as so computed would be
reckoned as matrimonial assets. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]

48 In other words, after identifying unvested stock options as “assets” that
could fall within s 112(10) WC, the Court of Appeal went on to determine to
what extent they could be treated as matrimonial assets. Given that the
condition for vesting the stock options in that case turned on the length of
service, the Court of Appeal determined that only the proportion of the stock
options that could be attributed to the period of service performed during the
marriage could be treated as matrimonial assets. Hence, Chan Teck Hock does
not stand for the broad proposition that all entitlements to shares (ie, the
contractual right to have shares or a share option in the future) obtained
during the marriage would automatically be treated as matrimonial assets.
Instead, the court has to consider the nature of the conditions upon which the
relevant party would become entitled to the share option or, in this case, the
shares.

49 In the present case, the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares are conditional on
certain conditions being met for Fiscal 2018 (“FY 2018”) and Fiscal 2019 (“FY
2019”) respectively. Clause 1.1 defines FY 2018 as the fiscal year ending 31
December 2018 and FY 2019 as the fiscal year ending 31 December 2019. The IJ
date was 26 January 2018. Hence, it is clear that the 2019 KPI Shares were
conditional on work done and targets achieved after the marriage had ended.
There is no basis for including any of the entitlements to the 2019 KPI Shares
as matrimonial assets. The same is not true for the 2018 KPI Shares, since
around a month of work, from 1 to 26 January 2018, would have arguably
contributed to the achievement of the 2018 KPIs. While it is not certain that
there is a linear relationship between the time spent working and the
achievement of the KPIs, a proportion based on time is a suitable estimate as
a matter of determining the proportion of the entitlement to be treated as
matrimonial assets. Taking a broad-brush approach to estimating the portion of
the 2018 KPI Shares that should be treated as matrimonial assets, I take the
fraction of ![Math Equation](data:image/Png;base64,
iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA0AAAAbCAYAAACnZAX6AAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAABSSURBVDhP7ZBbCgAgCAT3/pc2Cg2xtMdHEDiwH7ZMiKALfpMAtERM25SYY6kKEo/4S4c7Sa+zHZaPSIlpkpzSos+s6dNQBLMrWd5ItltK4ztRAZcj/zl7vnepAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC),
being one month out of 12. Estimating the value of the 2018 KPI Shares
according to the value of shares as purchased under the SPA (on the adjusted
consideration of US$20,000,000, and taking the proportion of that attributable
to work done before the IJ, I arrive at the following calculation:

Converting this based on the agreed currency exchange rate used by both
parties, this gives the sum of S$134,021.44. Therefore, the share of the 2018
KPI Shares that are treated as matrimonial assets would be worth S$134,021.44.

(5) Expenses relating to Company [X]

50 The Husband had incurred expenses for professional fees relating to the
sale of Company [X]. In particular, he paid a sum of S$137,492.26 in November
2018 to bankers who assisted with the sale of Company [X]. He argued that
these sums should be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets, since the
US$3m that was earned (which has been included in the pool) should be netted
against these expenses. The Wife argued that they should not be deducted, as
the fees were paid after the IJ date. The Husband responded that the quantum
of fees payable was based on what the Husband received from the sale.

51 I agree with the Husband that these sums should be deducted from the pool
of matrimonial assets as these were expenses related to the US$3m which has
been added into the pool of matrimonial assets. While the specific payment in
question was paid after the IJ date, the fees were in fact incurred before the
IJ date, since the services were obtained for the sale of Company [X] earlier.
The later payment was apparently due to the arrangement that the quantum of
the fees would be conditional on the amount earned, and so an adjustment was
made to account for the additional US$3m paid to the Husband. It would be more
appropriate to treat these expenses together with the assets earned under the
SPA. I therefore deduct the sum of S$137,943.26 from the pool of matrimonial
assets. 88

(6) Bonuses to staff of Company [X]

52 In October 2018, the Husband decided to pay bonuses to the staff of Company
[X] in appreciation of their efforts which enabled the US$3m to be earned
under cl 5.4.1.(i) of the SPA. He argued that the sums should be deducted from
the pool of matrimonial assets, while the Wife argued that there was no such
need.

53 Given that the payments were made after the IJ date, and they were
gratuitous and not part of any contract, I decide not to deduct these sums
from the pool of matrimonial assets. These payments were not mandated and were
given out of the Husband’s goodwill. While the efforts of the staff
contributed to the US$3m pay-out under cl 5.4.1(i) of the SPA, the bonuses
were not required under the SPA or any other contract. As such, these should
be treated as gifts made by the Husband after the IJ date out of his funds.
Given that I have decided to value the bank accounts at the IJ date, it
follows that these payments to the staff are out of the Husband’s “own” assets
and it is not necessary to address them further in the division exercise.

(7) Loan to Husband’s sister

54 The Husband had loaned €25,000 (~ S$37,991.95) to his sister on 9 February
2018. As this is after the IJ date, and given that I have chosen to value the
bank accounts as of the IJ date, I do not see any reason to add this sum back
into the pool of matrimonial assets as this would already be accounted for.

(8) Gift to Husband’s niece

55 On 26 November 2017, the Husband gave his niece €15,000.00 to assist her in
purchasing a property. The Wife argued that this sum should be returned to the
pool of matrimonial assets. I agree with the Wife. As the Court of Appeal
stated in TNL v TNK [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“TNL”) at [24]:

… [T]he issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by
one spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent;
or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are
of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or
otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to
the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative
interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the
expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time.
Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure
was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the
expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse
who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full.
In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share
in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact
and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except
to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill
expenses.

[emphasis added]

56 In this case, the writ was filed on 9 October 2017. The gift to the niece
was on 26 November 2017, after the writ was filed. This clearly was a period
of time where divorce proceedings were imminent. The Wife had a putative
interest in the funds and did not agree to the transfer, and even though the
transfer was intended to benefit a relative, that does not prevent the sum
from being returned to the pool. The sum of €15,000.00 is a substantial sum
and is not a “daily, run-of-the-mill expense[]”: TNL at [24]. Therefore, I
return the sum of €15,000.00 (~ S$22,795.05) to the pool of matrimonial
assets, and will later treat this amount as an advance to the Husband.

Adjustment for losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic

58 Before the AM could be resolved in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic
substantially affected the value of certain assets held by the Husband. In a
letter to the court dated 8 April 2020, the Husband set out the various losses
suffered as follows:

S/N| Asset| Depreciation  
---|---|---  
1\. | UBS Portfolio| S$1,835,931.05  
2\. | Indosuez Portfolio| S$805,065.05  
3\. | Palatine Assurance 3494| S$20,509.79  
4\. | DBS Portfolio| S$112,414.22  
Total| S$2,773,920.11  
  
59 I refer to this sum as the “COVID-19 Losses”. This sum was not disputed by
the Wife. As I have adopted the IJ date for the valuation of these assets, and
the depreciation above was calculated from that date, the figures are logical
and consistent with my findings above. Following discussions between the
parties, it was agreed that the Wife would bear her share of the COVID-19
Losses. The parties updated the court by way of letter on 26 May 2020 that the
parties had agreed to a mechanism by which the COVID-19 could be shared. On 18
September 2020, the parties confirmed that they had agreed to the following
terms:

(a) Parties agree that the total quantum of the alleged losses suffered by the
Plaintiff arising from the COVID-19 situation is taken to be SGD 2,773,920.11
(“COVID-19 Amount"). The Defendant's share of the COVID-19 Amount shall be
calculated by applying the percentage figure of the Defendant's share of the
matrimonial assets, as determined by the Court during the Ancillary Matters
proceedings, to the figure of SGD 2,773,920.11. It is agreed that the two
children of the marriage shall be the beneficiaries of the Defendant's share
of the COVID-19 Amount.

(b) The Defendant agrees to execute a will in favour of the two children of
the marriage within six (6) months of the Plaintiff making full payment of the
Defendant's share of the matrimonial assets to her pursuant to the Ancillary
Matters Order of Court. For the avoidance of doubt, the Defendant's share of
the matrimonial assets encompasses the Defendant's share of the COVID-19
Amount. The will executed by the Defendant shall provide that the Defendant's
share of the COVID-19 Amount is distributed to the two children in equal
shares upon her demise. The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with a
redacted copy of her will reflecting such part of the will showing the
distribution of the COVID-19 Amount within one (1) week of execution. The
Defendant shall not take any steps to revoke or amend this will in relation to
the distribution of the COVID-19 Amount thereafter save in accordance with
Paragraph (c) below.

(c) The Defendant is entitled to subsequently distribute her share of the
COVID-19 Amount directly to the two children of the marriage at any time after
the Defendant has complied with her obligations at Paragraph (b) above. If the
Defendant chooses to do so then she shall provide the Plaintiff with written
notice of her proposed alternate mode of distribution. After the two children
of the marriage have received their respective entitlements to the value of
the COVID-19 Amount pursuant to Paragraph (a), the Defendant may revoke or
amend her will as she deems fit.

[emphasis in original]

60 What remains to be dealt with is the apportionment of the COVID-19 Losses,
which would be the same as the ratio of division of the matrimonial assets. I
now turn to that issue.

Division of matrimonial assets

61 Having identified and valued the pool of matrimonial assets, the question
is how the assets should be divided. The Husband advocated using the
structured approach found in ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ANJ”) while the
Wife argued that the approach in TNL ([55] supra) was more appropriate as the
marriage should be characterised as a single-income marriage. This was a
marriage of 12 years, in which the Wife had worked for approximately five to
six years (around one year in France and between 2009 and 2013 in Singapore).
The question is whether the facts of this case suggest that the approach in
TNL should apply instead of the structured approach.

62 In addressing this issue, I take guidance from the High Court Family
Division’s decision in UBM v UBN [2017] 4 SLR 921 (“UBM”) at [48]–[50]:

48 In TNL v TNK, the Court of Appeal defined “Single-Income Marriages” as
marriages where “one spouse is the sole-income earner and the other plays the
role of homemaker”; it distinguished this from “Dual-Income Marriages”, which
it defined as “marriages where both spouses are working and are therefore able
to make both direct and indirect financial contributions to the household”
(see [42]–[43]).

49 The words “Single-Income Marriage” ought to be interpreted sensibly in the
spirit in which TNL v TNK was decided. I do not think the Court of Appeal
intended to draw a thick black line separating cases where the main homemaker
worked intermittently for a few years in the course of a long marriage from
cases where the homemaker had not worked a single day, applying the structured
approach in ANJ v ANK ([2] supra) only in the former situation while excluding
it in the latter. To do so may place a full-time homemaker (who has not worked
at all during marriage) in a better position than a homemaker who also worked
but brought far less income into the marriage than the main breadwinner. This
is because the former may obtain near equal division of the assets following
TNL v TNK, while the latter may obtain substantially less than that share if
ANJ v ANK is applied to her (or his) case and her direct contributions are
very low.

50 It appears from the judgment in TNL v TNK that a “Single-Income Marriage”
would include a marriage where one party is primarily the breadwinner and the
other is primarily the homemaker. The Court of Appeal cited, as examples of
Single-Income Marriages, two cases where the spouse who took on the role of
the main homemaker had also made some financial contributions, for example,
through employment or through investments. Thus, it appears that “Single-
Income Marriages” are not limited to those where one spouse focuses
exclusively on the homemaking role without contributing financially at all,
while the other is the sole breadwinner. …

[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]

63 Hence, it is not the case that as soon as one spouse works any amount of
time that the marriage cannot be treated as a “Single-Income Marriage” and
that the structured approach in ANJ must apply. In my view, the present case
falls within the scope of a “Single-Income Marriage” even though the Wife had
worked for slightly under half of the marriage. The most significant factor,
in my view, is that the Wife was a homemaker in the period when the Husband
was working in Company [X]. This same period saw a massive increase in the
wealth of the family arising from that company, which dwarfed any
contributions that the Wife had made financially to the marriage. Even though
she had worked earlier, it is clear from the calculations put forward by both
parties that between 96% and 99% of the direct financial contributions would
have been made by the Husband, and the indirect financial contributions would
also be tilted significantly in the Husband’s favour. Taking a look at the
balance of responsibilities and contributions between the Husband and the Wife
in this particular case, it was artificial to treat this as a dual-income
marriage, since the income of each was so disparate, the Wife’s income being a
small fraction of the Husband’s income, and considering that the Wife had
worked for only part of the marriage.

64 I derive further support for this conclusion from the Court of Appeal’s
reasons for not applying the structured approach in certain cases. In TNL at
[44], the Court of Appeal noted that since the structured approach gave
recognition to financial contributions under both direct and indirect
contributions, the “non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and
severely) disadvantaged”. This would apply to a case where one party has
earned significantly more overall in such a way that the financial
contribution of the other party becomes almost negligible. At [45], the Court
of Appeal recognised that if the structured approach was used and adjustments
sought to be made to reflect the “mutual respect … for spousal contributions,
whether in the economic or homemaking spheres” (citing ANJ at [18]):

[G]iving effect to this principle in the context of a Single-Income Marriage
and within the framework of the ANJ approach would almost inevitably result in
some degree of artificiality: the court would either have to ward the non-
working spouse a very high percentage in Step 2 (which may appear to disregard
the working spouse’s indirect financial contributions), or accord a very high
weightage to Step 2 at Step 3. In some, if not most, cases, the court would
have to do both.

65 In a recent judgment, the Court of Appeal has noted that for short
marriages (apparently without distinguishing between single- or dual-income
marriages), the structured approach in ANJ ([61] supra) should apply: USB v
USA [2020] SGCA 57 at [37]. That case dealt with a marriage of five years. The
present marriage of 12 years was not short, but neither was it long. Rather
than to focus simply on the length of the marriage, and in recognition of the
factors in the present case identified above, I was of the view that the
structured approach was not appropriate in the present case.

66 However, I recognise that the disagreements over whether ANJ or TNL ([55]
supra) should apply are not, in the final analysis, the most important issue,
since the aim, regardless of the approach taken, is to arrive at a just and
equitable division of assets. Regardless of which approach was used, I would
not be surprised if the results were similar.

Direct financial contributions

67 The parties are agreed that the Husband had provided the vast majority of
direct financial contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband
assessed his contributions at between 96% to 99%, and the Wife adopted the
figure of 96% in her submissions. While these numerical values are not
required under TNL, and should not take on inordinate weight, I state them
here as helpful guides for characterising the overall financial situation in
the marriage.

Indirect contributions

68 Turning to the indirect financial contributions, I note that there is no
need to assign a numerical value to the indirect contributions. I make the
following observations on the parties’ respective contributions:

(a) In terms of the indirect financial contributions, given the Husband’s
overall earnings, and the less time that the Wife spent working, the majority
of the expenses would have been financed by the Husband.

(b) The Wife was the primary caregiver for the two Children. She was the one
in charge of their daily care, their feeding, cleaning, playing, and
education. 116

It is, however, not disputed that the Husband did play his part in the
Children’s upbringing – he was involved in Child [A]’s education and
activities, and also in taking care of Child [B]. 117

(c) The Wife had made sacrifices in her career to take care of the Children as
she left her job in 2013 to become a full-time homemaker: see ARY ([11] supra)
at [61].

(d) While the parties had hired domestic helpers, I agree with the Wife that
this does not necessarily reduce the Wife’s contribution to the marriage. At
the same time, it is also true that having domestic helpers would tend to
relieve the burden of some aspects of the family’s upkeep and maintenance.

(e) I recognise that Company [X] was not a “family business”, and that the
Wife never worked for the Company. At the same time, I acknowledge that in a
marriage where one spouse is involved in building a business, the other spouse
may give indirect support. This is part of the principle that the marriage is
a partnership.

Adjustments for adverse inferences

69 The Wife further argued that adjustments should be made to the division to
account for the loans and gifts to the Husband’s family members, and the
bonuses given to the staff of Company [X]. As I have already addressed them at
[52]–[56] above, there is no need to account for them again by adjusting the
division of the matrimonial assets.

Final division ratio

70 I note that the Court of Appeal in BOR v BOS and another appeal [2018] SGCA
78 at [113] observed that in “moderately lengthy marriages” in the range of 15
to 18 years, the courts have awarded the homemaker about 35% to 40% of the
matrimonial assets. The Court of Appeal also noted (at [113]) that “[f]or
marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be
towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the
matrimonial pool”, citing UGG v UGH (m.w.) [2017] SGHCF 25 and ABX v ABY and
others [2014] 2 SLR 969.

71 The primary factor that I consider important is that the bulk of the
matrimonial assets was earned by the Husband’s efforts at building up Company
[X]. Even in the structured approach of ANJ ([61] supra), after accounting for
the direct and indirect contributions, the Court of Appeal recognised (at
[27(b)]) that “[i]f the pool of assets available for division is
extraordinarily large and all of that was accrued by one party’s exceptional
efforts, direct contributions are likely to command greater weight as against
indirect contributions”. While there is no need to specify the ratios and
adjustments when not using the structured approach, I find that the same logic
is compelling when addressing an exceptionally large pool of assets which are
largely the result of one party’s efforts.

72 The Wife argued that a division of 50:50 between the parties would be just
and equitable. In my view, this failed to account for the assets that the
Husband had earned by his work with Company [X]. She further argued that “it
has always been the parties’ understanding” that “the matrimonial assets will
be shared in equally”, and that this was the prevailing outcome in French
family law. 118

Apparently, the Husband also promised in 2009 that when he was setting up his
business, the Wife would bear 50% of the liability if it failed, but would
share in 50% of the success. 120

##### Foot Note 120

×

W AOM2 at paras 58–60.

73 While I recognise that the agreement of parties is a factor for the court
to consider under s 112(2)(e) WC, the Wife’s argument faced significant
difficulties in this case. The evidence concerning the agreement was very weak
and consisted purely of her own assertions. There was no document evidencing
any such agreement. Even if there were some agreement against the backdrop of
French family law, the assertion that equal division was the likely outcome in
France was not proved by any expert evidence. When it came to the alleged 2009
agreement in Singapore, there is, once again, no evidence of that agreement. I
do not give this weight in my determination of the appropriate ratio.

74 The Husband’s argument that he should be awarded 81.75% of the assets, with
the Wife receiving 18.25%, went too far the other way and failed to reflect
the Wife’s indirect contributions to the marriage, recognising the principle
of the marriage as a partnership: ANJ at [17].

75 Having regard to the assets in this case, and the fact that the Wife was
the primary caregiver of the Children, but recognising also that this was a
marriage of a short-to-moderate length and the Husband was also involved in
the Children’s lives, I decide that an appropriate division is 70:30 in favour
of the Husband, on a broad-brush approach. In arriving at this determination,
I found the High Court Family Division’s comments in UBM ([62] supra) at [60]
particularly helpful:

Divorcing couples were once in an intact, functioning relationship; they chose
to marry each other, for better or for worse. The mutual emotional support
each gave the other in the marriage cannot be measured in monetary terms. Who
is to say that had one spouse not been present in the life of the other, the
latter would have been as financially successful and thus able to contribute a
greater share to the pool of matrimonial assets? Conversely, one cannot, on
hindsight, tell with certainty whether the presence of the other spouse in
one’s life had any negative effect on one’s career. Countless decisions, small
and large, are made in the course of a marriage. Many significant forks in
life’s road occur during the course of a marriage. The broad brush approach is
thus a key feature in the resolution of disputes over the division of
matrimonial assets. The final ratio also ought to reflect the philosophy of
marriage as an equal partnership of different efforts. Matrimonial disputes
are best managed, and families better supported, by a sensible, broad-brush
process which does not incentivise calculative behaviour. Parties need to be
bigger, kinder and wiser after a divorce; they need to look ahead and recast
their future to focus on healing themselves and parenting their children.

Apportionment of the pool of matrimonial assets

76 The total value of the pool of matrimonial assets is S$36,830,541.81. Based
on the ratio of 70:30 in favour of the Husband, the Husband is entitled to
S$25,781,379.27 and the Wife is entitled to S$11,049,162.54.

77 I first deduct the advances that each party has already received. The
Husband is treated as having received an advance of S$22,795.05 (see [56]
above), the value of the gift that he had given to his niece. The Wife had
received an advance of S$100,000.00 which was paid by Husband to Wife in
December 2018, after the IJ date. 121

##### Foot Note 121

Minute Sheet 24 October 2019 at p 15.

Their respective remaining entitlements are therefore S$25,758,584.22 (being
S$25,781,379.27 - S$22,795.05) and S$10,949,162.54 (being S$11,049,162.54 –
S$100,000.00). The Wife has a total of S$624,884.46 in her name. To make up
for her share of the matrimonial assets, the Husband should pay to the Wife
the sum of S$10,324,278.08 (being S$10,949,162.54 - S$624,884.46). At the same
time, the Wife should relinquish all her rights to the joint assets listed
above.

78 In addition to that, according to the parties’ agreement on the COVID-19
Losses, the sum of S$2,773,920.11 is to be divided in the ratio of 70:30 as
well. The Wife is therefore to bear S$832,176.03. This sum is to be dealt with
in the manner described at [59] above according to the parties’ agreement.

Custody and care and control of the Children

79 In making orders for custody, and care and control, the paramount
consideration for the court is the child’s welfare: see s 125(2) WC and TAU v
TAT [2018] SGHCF 11 at [10]. As the High Court noted in Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah
Boey [1987] SLR(R) 725 at [12], “welfare”:

… means the general well-being of the child and all aspects of his upbringing,
religious, moral as well as physical. His happiness, comfort and security also
go to make up his well-being.

Custody

80 The parties are agreed that joint custody is appropriate in this case. A
sole custody order would be rare and ought to be made only in exceptional
circumstances, eg, physical, sexual, or emotional abuse: CX v CY (minor:
custody and access) [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690 at [38]. I therefore agree that a
joint custody order is appropriate in this case.

81 Apart from the overall custody of the Children, however, the Wife also
sought two specific custody-related orders, pertaining to Child [B]’s
schooling and the religion of the Children. 122

##### Foot Note 122

WWS at para 4.

The power of the court to grant such additional orders is found in s 126(1)
WC, and s 126(2)(a) WC (which provides a list of specific orders without
prejudice to the general power under s 126(1) WC) makes specific reference to
the manner of the child’s education and the religion in which he or she is to
be brought up.

Order for Child [B]’s schooling

82 The Wife had sought an order specifying which school Child [B] should
attend. Parties had indicated that this would depend on whether the older
child, Child [A], would be able to obtain a place at School [Y], and would
also depend on the situation for the upcoming school year. Given how the
proceedings have unfolded, I sought clarification from the parties whether
Child [A] had in fact managed to obtain a place at School [Y]. Parties
confirmed on 30 July 2020 that Child [A] will not be attending School [Y], but
School [Z] instead. In the interest of having the children attend the same
school, and given that the parties did not express a preference for any
particular school, and in the light of the need to confirm the school choices
in August 2020, I granted an order on 3 August 2020 that both Child [A] and
Child [B] are to be enrolled in School [Z] for the coming academic year. That
sufficiently disposes of this particular application.

Order for religious upbringing

83 The Wife submitted that the court should grant an order that the Children
should be brought up as Muslims until they are old enough to make their own
decisions about religion. 123

84 I agree with the Husband that no such order is necessary at present. I

Islam, and that the Children have been declared as Muslim in documentation

It is also not disputed that they have been allowed to follow the Husband to

It does not appear that the Husband wishes to prevent the Children from
continuing to follow the Islamic practices that they have been brought up
with, nor does it appear that the Wife is seeking, at present, to add anything
further to their religious practices. The Wife’s primary concern appears to be
that the Husband may bring the Children to church to celebrate his religious
holidays, and that this may lead to confusion. 128

Wife’s Affidavit Filed in SUM 3462/2017 dated 10 August 2018 (“WC3”) at para
36.

I do not think that such occasional visits would be damaging to the Children’s
welfare – the Husband is not entitled to unilaterally convert the Children to
Roman Catholicism in any case, and such occasional visits on special occasions
do not appear to pose a threat to the Children’s identity.

85 While each party has characterised the other party’s intentions in the
worst light, I do not see any substantial dispute that arises in relation to
the Children’s religious upbringing at this point. A court order at this
juncture is a blunt instrument that may do more harm than good. I decline to
make an order concerning the Children’s religious upbringing in this judgment.

Care and control and access

86 The parties disagree over the appropriate care and control order. The
Husband sought an order for shared care and control. 129

The Wife argued that sole care and control should be granted to her, with the
Husband being given access to the Children. 130

WWS at para 2.

87 As the High Court defined it in AQL v AQM [2012] 1 SLR 840 (“AQL”) at [8],
a “shared” care and control order means that “the child spends time living
with each parent, who then becomes the child’s primary caregiver for the
duration that the child lives with him (or her). … [T]he child effectively has
two homes and two primary caregivers.” In the following, I first address why I
do not think that shared care and control is appropriate in this case, before
discussing who should be granted the sole care and control of the Children. In
the following, I proceed on the basis that the two Children should be kept
together, which is, in my view, consistent with their welfare.

Should shared care and control be granted?

88 In my judgment, shared care and control is not suitable. As the High Court
Family Division recognised in TAU v TAT [2018] 5 SLR 1089 (“TAU v TAT”) at
[12], the court has to consider “factors such as that particular child’s needs
at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate
within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in
mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week.”
The following factors weighed on my mind in the present case:

(a) Both children were either of schooling or near schooling age. Given this,
it seemed to me that greater stability in their home lives would be in their
interest, to enable them to settle down well after school and be prepared for
the next day’s activities. Having them shuttle between different living
situations after school does not appear to be conducive to their welfare.

(b) The parties have shown themselves to have a fraught relationship and there
is a real risk that a shared care and control arrangement would be unworkable.
This is especially so given the multiple allegations and complaints made by
each party about the other.

(c) I do not consider that the Husband’s concern over the Wife’s Obsessive-
Compulsive Disorder (“OCD”) was entirely justified and reject his argument
that a shared care and control order was needed to account for her OCD. I will
elaborate on this below.

(d) The mere fact that it is in the Children’s interest for both parents to be
continually involved in their upbringing, which the Husband emphasises and
which is not disputed, does not require a shared care and control order to be
granted: see, eg, TAU v TAT at [25]–[26].

Who should be granted care and control?

89 In my judgment, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I am of
the view that the Wife should be granted care and control of the Children,
with access given to the Husband.

90 I do not find that the Wife’s OCD is such as to prevent her from being the
primary caretaker for the Children. I take guidance from the evidence tendered
on behalf of the Wife, which show that having OCD does not, in and of itself,
impair the Wife’s capacity to be a parent.

(a) The psychologist who had been treating the Wife since August 2016 tendered
an affidavit and report dated 21 November 2017 stating that the Wife’s
condition was “Moderate”, and that individuals with OCD “do not pose a danger
to others, including children, just because of their condition.” Specifically,
the psychologist observed that the Wife had a “caring and loving relationship”
with Child [B] (based on primary observation), and that the Wife actively
sought advice on how to ensure that her condition did not negatively impact
Child [A]. 131

##### Foot Note 131

Wife’s Expert Affidavit 1 dated 21 November 2017 (“WE1”) at pp 16, 19.

In a supplementary affidavit and report dated 10 August 2018, the psychologist
also observed that the Wife “makes an active effort not to restrict [the
Children’s] behaviour or to impose her fears on them. She is conscious of
putting their needs before her own, and has typically been most successful at
resisting OCD-related behaviour when the [Children] have been involved.” 132

he concluded that her condition was of “mild severity”. 134

He concluded, “[h]aving evaluated [the Wife’s] OCD (severity and symptoms) and

opinion that her current OCD symptoms have not seriously impaired her self-
care and child-rearing capacities.” 136

##### Foot Note 136

×

WE3 at p 21.

91 The Husband’s various allegations about the Wife’s outbursts and difficulty
coping were, in my view, not ultimately probative, as they captured specific
instances rather than showing her overall conduct. Further, as the
psychologist noted, these could have been influenced by the breakdown of the
relationship between the Wife and Husband, or lack of trust between her and
her domestic helpers. 137

##### Foot Note 137

×

WE1 at p 19.

92 Given that I have not found that the Wife’s OCD was such as to render her
unfit to be the primary caretaker, I conclude that the Wife should be granted
care and control. I note here that just as I did not place much weight on the
Wife’s OCD, I also did not rely on the allegations that she made against the
Husband concerning his panic attacks. The Wife has always been the primary
caretaker for both Children since their birth. She would be most prepared to
take on the responsibility of caring for the Children after the divorce.
Further, this means that there would be familiarity and regularity in the
Children’s lives if the Wife is granted care and control. This is significant
as it would minimise the disruption caused by the divorce.

Access

93 It is clear that there was no reason against granting the Husband
unsupervised access to the Children. In the event that the Wife was granted
care and control, the Husband indicated that he was satisfied with the access
granted in the interim orders with variations as follows: 138

##### Foot Note 138

×

Notes of Argument of 24 October 2019 at p 2.

(a) ORC 4982/2018 as varied by the High Court is to continue, save that the
weekend access should begin on Thursday 7am instead of Friday 7am.

(b) FC/ORC 2703/2019, which varied ORC 4982/2018 concerning holiday access,
was to stand save that religious public holidays were to be spent with the
parent of that religion, and such holidays will not be covered by the
provision that public holidays falling during school holidays are not to be
covered in the public holiday arrangements.

94 The Wife made the following points in submissions: 139

##### Foot Note 139

×

WWS at para 45.

(a) First, weekend access was to be varied such that the Husband would have
access every other week, from Friday after Child [A]’s school day ends to
Sunday 8.30pm. During the weeks that the Husband does not have weekend access,
he is to have access on an additional weekday evening from 5pm to 9pm before
that weekend.

(b) Second, although the Wife was amenable to the Husband having half the
school holidays, she sought an order that would ensure that the Husband would
not have access for a continuous period of more than seven days at a time.

(c) Third, the Wife was agreeable to have the Children spend any religious
holidays with the parent of that religion, and that the Children will spend
Mother’s Day and the Wife’s birthday with the Wife, and Father’s Day and the
Husband’s birthday with the Husband.

(d) Fourth, in the event of any overseas travel, the Husband shall bring both
Children on the trip.

95 I deal first with weekend access. In RAS 22/2018, I had considered that an
alternate weekend access would not be in the Children’s interest, given that
they had been spending every weekend with the Husband. However, I recognise
that as both Children grow up and attend school, the weekends become ever more
precious to the parents. The interim order at present provides that the
Husband has access on Friday morning to Saturday night, while the Wife will
spend Sunday morning onwards with the Children. Now that both Children attend
school, the Husband sought access to commence on Thursday morning. I do not
think that this is appropriate, since that would result in instability when
two full days of the week are part of the Husband’s access. Further, I
consider that the Wife’s concerns are valid. Under the interim order, the
Husband is given access to the Children on the only two nights which are not
“school nights” in the week. I accept that this gave the Husband much more
time with the Children for leisure and recreational activities, like birthday
parties and sleepovers. The downside to the Wife’s proposal was that the
Husband’s contact with the Children would be less regular, but I am satisfied
that the Wife’s proposal that the Husband be given a weekday evening access
during the weeks he does not have weekend access to be sufficient. Rather than
limit this to the week prior to the weekend where he does not have access, I
think that this weekday access can be granted any day in the five days before
or after the weekend in question. Moreover, in this scenario, the Husband is
given a full Sunday with the Children as well.

96 As for the holidays, I recognise the Wife’s concern with the Husband being
granted continuous access for more than seven days. In my view, such a
limitation to seven days was not entirely justified. While the Wife has
provided evidence that the Children were not used to extended access with the
Husband, 140

##### Foot Note 140

×

WWS at paras 51–57.

I note that her primary concern seems to be the possibility that the Children
may have one entire month with the Husband. 141

##### Foot Note 141

Minute Sheet 24 October 2019 at p 3; WWS at para 52.

Further, while the Wife expressed some dissatisfaction with the Husband’s
conduct during the two-week long trip that the Husband took the Children to
France, 142

##### Foot Note 142

×

Wife’s 16th Affidavit dated 3 September 2019 at paras 8–17.

I am of the view that there were no serious problems. I acknowledged that some
limitation was justified by the evidence, but given the prior two-week trip as
well as the fact that the Wife’s primary concern was with very lengthy periods
up to a month, I conclude that the limit should be placed at 14 days (not
seven) until the Children grow more accustomed to spending extended periods of
time away from the Wife and with the Husband. As for how the religious
holidays were to be spent, the parties were in agreement and I see no reason
to order otherwise. Similarly, I accept that the Children are to spend
Mother’s and Father’s Days, and the Wife’s and Husband’s birthdays with the
respective parent. The Wife further asked for an order that if the Husband
wishes to bring Child [A] or Child [B] overseas for travel, he would have to
bring both Children. I do not see a reason for imposing this restriction, as
it appears to be overly restrictive and there is no pressing need for it.

97 At the hearing on 18 September 2020, the parties also agreed that the
interim orders made concerning electronic access and handover arrangements to
continue, and for the parties to keep each other informed of what the school
communicates to each party about the children. I accordingly make orders
reflecting this agreement.

98 I therefore make the order as follows:

(a) There be joint custody of the two (2) children of the marriage, namely,
[Child A] and [Child B] to both the Husband and the Wife.

(b) That care and control of the two (2) children is granted to the Wife.

(c) Subject to (d)–(f), that the Husband shall have access to the children as
follows:-

(i) Every Tuesday evening from 5.00pm to 9.00pm.

(ii) Every other week, every Friday from 12.00pm to Sunday 8.00pm (“weekend
access”). In weeks where the Husband does not have weekend access, he shall
have access on a weekday evening of his choice, subject to the Wife’s
agreement (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), from 5.00pm to 9.00pm in
the five (5) days prior to or after the weekend in which he does not have
weekend access. For the avoidance of doubt, the Children will spend the first
weekend after the release of this judgment with the Husband.

(iii) Subject to (vi), half of each of the school holidays, with parties to
discuss and agree on specific dates, save that the Husband shall not have
access for a continuous period of more than 14 days. Parties are to endeavour
to agree on increasing this limit as soon as appropriate for the Children.
Such access is to start at 9.00am of the first day of each period and end at
9.00pm on the last day of each period.

(iv) For public holidays, alternate public holidays from 9.00am to 9.00pm.
Where a public holiday falls within a school holiday, it is not to be counted
as part of the school holiday in (iii) above.

(v) Notwithstanding (i) to (iv) above, the Children shall spend Muslim public
holidays (viz, Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji) with the Wife, and shall
spend Catholic public holidays (viz, Christmas and Easter) with the Husband.
They shall also spend Mother’s Day and the Wife’s birthday with the Wife, and
Father’s Day and the Husband’s birthday with the Husband. Such access is to
commence at 9.00am and end at 9.00pm. These days are not to be considered for
the purposes of (iii) or (iv) above.

(vi) Any other period as may be agreed between the parties.

(vii) Parties are at liberty to adjust the holiday schedule (ie, any access
under (iii)–(v)) by mutual agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this does
not preclude the parties from coming to any other mutual agreement for any of
the access granted to the Husband.

(viii) The Husband shall pick up and drop off the Children at the Wife’s
residence or some other mutually agreed location.

(ix) Where applicable, the Husband is to ensure that the Children attend
school and their scheduled classes when they are with him.

(d) Either parent who intends to travel with the Children shall provide an
itinerary at least seven (7) days in advance.

(e) Parties are to have reasonable electronic access to the Children, subject
to the Children’s schedules, when they are with the other parent.

(f) Parties are to keep each other informed and updated about what the school
or any other educational institution communicates to either party about the
Children.

(g) Parties are not to speak to the Children about the court proceedings or
speak about the court proceedings in the presence of the Children.

(h) Parties are not to photograph, document or record videos of the Children
for the purposes of use or reference in court.

Maintenance

Wife

99 Section 114(1) WC sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors to be
considered when ordering maintenance. The guiding principle behind the grant
of maintenance is that of financial preservation: Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow
[2012] 2 SLR 506 at [12].

100 Based on my judgment, she will receive 30% of the matrimonial assets,
which would be a total of around S$11m, a large part of which are liquid
assets. While she is still relatively young and has many more years ahead of
her for which she will need sufficient finances, this is a significant sum.
The power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to divide the
matrimonial assets: TNL ([55] supra) at [63]. In my judgment, the sum that the
Wife will receive, if invested properly, and even if the Wife chooses not to
seek employment, would be more than sufficient to maintain the Wife.
Therefore, I do not make a maintenance order in favour of the Wife in this
case.

Children

101 The Wife sought maintenance for the Children as well.

102 I first consider the claimed monthly expenses of each child. The Wife
claimed that Child [A] required S$7,298.43 per month, while Child [B] required
S$5,385.75 per month. The breakdown of these expenses is tabulated as follows:

103 It bears reminding that the court, in deciding on the appropriate
maintenance for children, is not concerned primarily with an accounting
exercise, but deals broadly with a number of different factors in deciding on
the appropriate award of maintenance: UEB v UEC [2018] SGHCF 5 at [13]. In
that regard, the High Court has also observed that “maintenance is ordered in
order to meet the reasonable needs of the child and if the child’s lifestyle
is overly extravagant, the husband should not be made to bear the costs of
it”: APE v APF [2015] SGHC 17 at [43]. I agree with the Husband that these
expenses are excessive. In respect of Child [A], I do not see why S$1,500.00
is needed every month for shopping. For both Children, I find that the
expenses for food delivery and restaurant dining are excessive given their
age. I note also that the Children appear to have meals at school.
Entertainment, similarly, for such children ought not to reach S$450.00 per
month. The annual birthday expenses, based on the Wife’s accounting, would
amount to around S$6,579.96 per child. In my view, that is excessive as well.
In his submissions, the Husband proposed instead that Child [A] has reasonable
expenses of S$4,688.89 144

##### Foot Note 144

×

HWS at p 97.

while Child [B] has reasonable expenses of S$3,942.71. 145

##### Foot Note 145

×

HWS at p 99.

In the round, I am satisfied that Child [A] can be allowed S$5,000.00 per
month and Child [B] S$4,000.00 per month as reasonable expenses. These are
relatively high simply because of the parents’ “means and station in life”
(see s 68 WC, which applies by virtue of s 127(2) WC).

104 I note that the Wife has also tabulated the household expenses. I do not
intend to go through each of these items. I am only concerned with the
expenses that can be attributed to the Children and which they have a share in
enjoying. First, the rental cost of their current unit is S$11,800.00 per
month. In my judgment, the Wife cannot claim for the whole of this rent. While
account must be given to the standard of living to which the Wife and family
are used to, the court must also consider that the situation after the
breakdown of marriage has changed. If the Wife claims that she is not able to
earn an income, there is no reason why she is not able to move to a residence
with lower monthly rent. The Wife is not entitled simply to throw this cost on
the Husband. Having regard to the parties’ lifestyle, I am of the view that a
reasonable expense for monthly rental would be around S$9,000.00 per month. I
note that the Husband is also renting a unit for around S$8,300 per month. 146

##### Foot Note 146

H AOM1 at Tab 35.

Second, food delivery and eating out have already been accounted for in the
tabulation of the Children’s expenses. There is no reason to account for that
again. Further, given that “entertainment” is an expense accounted for in the
Children’s expenses, I do not see the need to account for them in terms of the
various subscriptions in the household expenses. Third, I accept the expenses
of a domestic helper or cleaner, as well as utilities and transport, but make
adjustments for what can be considered reasonable. Having regard to all of the
numbers, I consider that a monthly household expense of approximately
S$11,000.00 to be reasonable. The Children’s share of the expenses would be
approximately S$7,300 per month (being approximately two-thirds of the
household expenses).

105 I do not consider the various overseas travel and holiday expenses in my
determination. These can be funded by either party individually when they
choose to bring the Children on holidays. Similarly, presents for the Children
are within each parties’ individual expenditures.

106 Taking each child’s reasonable expenses and their share of the household
expenses together, I find that the Children have a total of S$16,300.00 per
month in expenses (being S$5,000.00 + S$4,000.00 + S$7,300.00).

107 I turn now to consider how this should be borne between the two parties.
The Wife argued that the Husband should pay for all of the Children’s
expenses. I could not agree. There was no basis for saddling the Husband with
such payments entirely given that the Wife would be receiving a significant
share of the matrimonial assets (which could be used to generate an income)
and given that she could find employment. Given the large pool of matrimonial
assets, I do not consider it appropriate to rely on income entirely in this
case. Although the Wife has tendered evidence concerning the Husband’s new
business venture, 147

##### Foot Note 147

×

Wife’s Affidavit in SUM 89/2020 at para 22.

the Husband noted that he never disputed that he could afford maintenance. 148

##### Foot Note 148

×

Husband’s Affidavit in SUM 89/2020 at para 15.

In my judgment, a fair apportionment of the expenses is along the lines of the
ratio of the division of the pool of matrimonial assets, ie, 70% to the
Husband and 30% to the Wife. I then adjust this slightly to place more
responsibility on the Husband since he will be retaining most of his
investment assets and has most recently been employed, to a ratio of 80:20 in
favour of the Husband.

108 Hence, I order that the Husband should pay S$13,040.00 per month (being
0.8 x S$16,300.00) as maintenance for the Children.

Costs

109 I had reserved the costs of RAS 23/2019 and SUM 89/2020 to be considered
together with the AM proceedings. Parties are to file and exchange written
submission on costs of RAS 23/2019, SUM 89/2020, and the AM proceedings
limited to 12 pages (excluding annexes exhibiting documents and list of
disbursements), within 14 days of this judgment.

Conclusion

110 I summarise the conclusions above as follows:

(a) The pool of matrimonial assets is divided in the ratio of 70:30 in favour
of the Husband. The total value of the pool of matrimonial assets is
S$36,830,541.81. Based on the said ratio, the Husband is entitled to
S$25,781,379.27 and the Wife is entitled to S$11,049,162.54. Accounting for
the assets already in her own name, and the S$100,000.00 advance paid in
December 2018, the Wife is entitled to a further S$10,324,278.08.

(i) The Husband is to pay 50% of S$10,324,278.08 to the Wife within three
months of the date of this judgment, and the remaining 50% of this sum within
six months of the date of this judgment.

(ii) The Wife is to transfer all her rights and entitlements to the joint
assets to the Husband within three months of the date of this judgment.

(b) The Wife is to bear her share of the COVID-19 Losses, ie S$832,176.03
(being 30% of S$2,773,920.11), in the manner agreed by the parties (see [59]
above).

(c) On the Children’s matters:

(i) I make no order as to the religious upbringing of the Children. The order
relating to the choice of school of the Children is that given on 3 August
2020.

(ii) There shall be joint custody of the two (2) children of the marriage,
namely, [Child A] and [Child B] to both the Husband and the Wife.

(iii) Care and control of the two (2) children is granted to the Wife.

(iv) Subject to (v)–(vii), that the Husband shall have access to the children
as follows:-

(A) Every Tuesday evening from 5.00pm to 9.00pm.

(B) Every other week, every Friday from 12.00pm to Sunday 8.00pm (“weekend
access”). In weeks where the Husband does not have weekend access, he shall
have access on a weekday evening of his choice, subject to the Wife’s
agreement (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), from 5.00pm to 9.00pm in
the five (5) days prior to or after the weekend in which he does not have
weekend access. For the avoidance of doubt, the Children will spend the first

the purposes of (C) or (D) above.

(F) Any other period as may be agreed between the parties.

residence or some other mutually agreed location.
