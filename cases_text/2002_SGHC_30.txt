** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

**

Background **

1\. This appeal arose out of an action in the District Court brought by Bok
Chee Seng Construction Pte Ltd (‘BCPL’). There, BCPL sought to recover from
their bankers, The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd (‘DBS’), sums totalling
$186,938.38 that they asserted DBS had wrongfully debited from their current
account.

2\. BCPL had first established their current account with DBS at the latter’s
branch at Eunos Station in January 1997. At that time, BCPL had only two
shareholders, Mr Peh Chee Chuan and Mr Phua Ah Pok, who were also the
company’s only directors. The directors’ resolutions passed on 7 January 1997
authorising the opening of the account also provided that it should at all
times be operated only by the two directors acting jointly. I shall refer to
this mandate relating to the operation of the account as ‘the original
mandate’.

3\. The January 1997 resolutions were in the standard form required by DBS for
the opening of a current account by a company and were ten in number, the
individual resolutions being distinguished by the alphabets (A) to (J).
Resolutions (F) and (G) played an important part in the subsequent legal
proceedings. These provided:

> ‘(F) That the Secretary of the Company be, and hereby is, authorised to
> certify to the Bank the name of the present officers of the Company and
> other persons authorised in terms of this resolution and offices
> respectively held by them, together with specimens of their signatures. In
> the event of the Company appointing another person/s in place of authorised
> person/s the Company shall notify the Bank that a Resolution has been passed
> to that effect, whereupon the said contents of this Resolution shall apply
> to such substituted signatories.
>
> (G) And that a copy of any resolution of the Board if purporting to be
> certified as correct by the Chairman of the meeting and by the Company
> Secretary or another Director shall as between the Bank and the Company be
> conclusive evidence of the passing of the resolution so certified.’

4\. In July 1997, Mr Phua purported to pass a resolution accepting the
resignation of the then company secretary and appointing one Mr Chua Thong
Jiang, Andrew as the new secretary of BCPL. This resolution was dated 22 July.
The next day, Mr Phua purported to pass another resolution whereby the
original mandate was revoked and a new mandate was effected. By this new
mandate, Mr Phua was authorised to act as the sole signatory of the company’s
cheques and the sole operator of the current account. Mr Peh was not a party
to either of the resolutions and did not become aware of them until some time
later. Both resolutions were signed by only one director namely Mr Phua.

5\. On the same day, 23 July 1997, DBS received three documents from BCPL
purportedly evidencing the new mandate. These were:

> (1) a document entitled ‘Change in Authorised Signatories – Resolution
> Passed by the Board of Directors’ which was DBS’s standard form resolution
> for such a situation. This document was signed by Mr Phua as the Chairman of
> the Meeting of Directors and by Mr Chua as BCPL’s company secretary;
>
> (2) a copy of Form 49 dated 22 July 1997 showing that The Mui Ngo had
> resigned as BCPL’s company secretary with effect from 22 July and that Mr
> Chua had been appointed as their company secretary with effect from the same
> date; and
>
> (3) a document on BCPL’s letterhead entitled ‘Extract of Resolution Passed
> by the Board of Directors of Bok Chee Seng Construction Pte Ltd on 23 July
> 1997’ and which read as follows:
>
> ‘RESOLVED that:
>

>> (a) Authority previously given to the authorised signatory to operate the
Current Account with The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd, Eunos Station MRT
Branch, Singapore be and is hereby rescinded.

>>

>> (b) Henceforth the Current Account with the aforesaid bank be and is hereby
authorised to be signed by _SINGLY_ by Phua Ah Pok.’

6\. From that day onwards, DBS observed the new mandate and honoured cheques
drawn on BCPL’s current account that were signed solely by Mr Phua. Between 11
August 1997 and 31 March 1998, 100 cheques were paid and the amounts thereof
totalling $263,736.97 were debited against the current account.

7\. On 3 October 1997, Messrs Ng Yap & Partners, acting as solicitors for Mr
Peh, wrote to DBS to inform them that a dispute had arisen between the
directors of BCPL namely Mr Peh and Mr Phua. The letter went on to give DBS
notice that it should freeze the company’s current account with immediate
effect. On 7 October 1997, Mr Peh wrote directly to DBS. He confirmed that he
had instructed Messrs Ng Yap & Partners to act for him in the dispute between
himself and Mr Phua and asked DBS to provide him with copies of the statements
of account in respect of the current account for the months of July, August,
September and October 1997. On 13 October 1997, DBS replied to Messrs Ng Yap &
Partners’ letter to say that they were unable to freeze the account of BCPL
without a directors’ resolution or court order. Mr Peh did not take any steps
to obtain a court order.

8\. A year later, in September 1998, Mr Peh commenced an originating summons
against Mr Phua and one Mr Chew Boon Cheng asking for relief pursuant to s 216
of the Companies Act (Cap 50). The originating summons was heard in December
1998 by Chan Seng Onn JC and, at the conclusion of the hearing, among the
orders made were the following:

> ‘(1) that the affairs of BCPL are being conducted and/or the powers of the
> directors are being exercised in a manner oppressive to the Plaintiff [Mr
> Peh] and/or in disregard of his interests as a member and/ or shareholder;
>
> (2) the Defendant(s) have done act(s) and/or passed resolution(s) which have
> prejudiced the Plaintiff’s rights and/or unfairly discriminated against the
> Plaintiff namely in the removal of the Plaintiff as a signatory to the
> Company’s bank account and the appointment of Chew Boon Cheng to the Board
> of Directors;
>
> (3) the resolutions passed by the Company on 22 July 1997, 23 July 1997, 25
> July 1997, 12 August 1997 and 13 August 1997 exhibited to this Originating
> Summons as Annexure A be declared null and void and/or be rescinded.’

The resolutions impeached by order (3) above involved the appointment of Mr
Phua as company secretary, the acceptance of the resignation of The Mui Ngo as
company secretary, the rescission of the original mandate given to DBS, the
appointment of Mr Phua as sole operator of the account, the change of
registered office of the company, the appointment of Mr Chew as a director and
the appointment of new solicitors for the company.

9\. Subsequently, Mr Peh took control of BCPL and discovered the 100 cheques
that Mr Phua had signed singly. BCPL took the stand that DBS had not been
authorised to make payment on these cheques because the resolutions which
purported to change the original mandate and make Mr Phua the sole signatory
were null and void. Having paid out without the necessary mandate DBS had
acted wrongfully and must reimburse BCPL with the amounts paid out. In the
event, the amount actually claimed was $186,938.38 since BCPL subsequently
accepted that the cheques making up the balance of the $263,736.97 had been
issued to genuine creditors of the company.

10\. DBS resisted BCPL’s claim. They took the position that from 23 July
onwards, BCPL’s only authorised signatory was Mr Phua and they relied on the
documents given to them by BCPL on that date. Accordingly, they asserted that
at all material times, they had acted with authority and in accordance with
the terms of the new mandate as evidenced by the aforesaid documents given to
them. They did not accept that the new mandate was invalid and/or null and/or
void by reason of the order of court made on 11 December 1998 (‘the court
order’) by Chan JC in Originating Summons 1306 of 1998.

**

  
The decision below

**

11\. The action was heard by District Judge Hoo Sheau Peng who elucidated the
broad issues that she had to decide as follows:

> (1) first, the nature, effect and ambit of the court order ie whether it had
> retrospective effect so that by relying on the new mandate, DBS had acted in
> breach of the original mandate or whether, as argued by DBS, the effect of
> the court order was simply to cancel, with effect from the date of the
> order, the directors’ resolution changing the original mandate;
>
> (2) secondly, whether DBS was entitled to act on the new mandate in the
> light of the contractual provisions between the parties or in the light of
> the indoor management rule as set out in _Royal British Bank v
> Turquand_[1856] 6 E & B 327; and
>
> (3) thirdly, whether DBS had displayed good faith and/or had taken
> reasonable care when honouring BCPL’s mandate.

12\. In relation to the first issue, the Judge came to the following
conclusions:

> (1) Essentially, s216 of the Companies Act provides for personal remedies to
> be sought by a member of a company. In this instance, Mr Peh had applied to
> the court for relief under s 216 against Mr Phua and Mr Chew. He had
> apparently made out all his grounds and one relief granted was, by way of
> the court order, to declare the resolution of 23 July 1997 which effected
> the change in the mandate ‘null and void and/or be rescinded’.
>
> (2) In the Judge’s opinion the court order had retrospective effect. ‘Null
> and void’ meant that the resolution was null and void from the start. The
> word ‘rescinded’ was distinguishable from ‘terminated’ and meant rescission
> _ab initio_. The Judge pointed out that if the court had wished to
> invalidate the resolution, it could have ordered that the resolution be
> cancelled as such power was given to it by s 216 (a).
>
> (3) Essentially the court order meant that there was no such resolution of
> 23 July 1997 at all, that Mr Phua was not authorised to be the sole
> signatory of the account, restoring Mr Peh’s position as a co-signatory of
> the account pursuant to the original mandate. However, it did not follow
> that a third party would be bound by the court order in the very same way,
> and to the same extent as the parties to the action. The court order did not
> decide the impact of the resolution vis--vis DBS.
>
> (4) Contractual provisions govern the relationship between DBS and BCPL and
> it had relied on these and documents over and above the resolution of 23
> July 1997. Therefore, the court order was not sufficient to, could not and
> did not, determine the issues of non-compliance of mandate and breach of
> duty.

13\. In relation to the first part of the second issue which was whether the
new mandate complied with the contractual provisions, the Judge held that on
the face of the documents, the new mandate was in order save for a lack of a
date in the notification which on its own was not indicative of any fraud or a
substantial irregularity. By acting on the new mandate, DBS had acted well in
accordance with their contractual obligations.

14\. The second part of the second issue related to the well known rule in
_Turquand’s_ case. The Judge observed that the matters relating to the
resolution of 23 July 1997 being declared null and void and/or rescinded were
internal to BCPL. As far as DBS was concerned, the external acts complied with
the January 1997 resolutions in relation to changing of signatories and even
with the memorandum and articles. DBS’s position was also fortified by the
‘conclusive evidence clause’ (ie the original resolution (G)) in that since a
director and the company secretary had certified the extract of the resolution
of 23 July 1997 to be a correct resolution, the conclusive evidence clause
operated to protect DBS against internal matters of BCPL affecting the status
of the resolution. It should be noted that the Judge regarded the January 1997
resolutions as being terms of the contract between DBS and BCPL in relation to
the account.

15\. On the third issue, the Judge found that DBS could not be faulted for
their conduct in the affair. I need not go into her reasoning for this
finding. Suffice it to say that the Judge concluded that BCPL was bound by the
cheques honoured by DBS. DBS’s reliance on the new mandate did not amount to a
breach of mandate or to a breach of its duty to take reasonable care towards
BCPL. According the claim was dismissed.

**

  
The appeal

**

16\. BCPL appealed against the dismissal of their claim. Their ground was that
once the Judge had found that the court order had retrospective effect and
therefore that the new mandate was a nullity, she should have gone on to find
DBS liable for non-compliance with the original mandate. This ground was
supported first, by a submission that the conclusive evidence clause did not
assist DBS since the conditions for its applicability had not arisen.
Secondly, the narrowness of the defence pleaded by DBS meant that they had
staked their position on the contention that the new mandate was valid and
once that contention was rejected their defence accordingly failed. In this
respect, DBS could not rely on the internal management rule or on any other
basis to justify their acting in accordance with the new mandate rather than
in accordance with the original mandate since DBS had not pleaded either the
internal management rule or any other such basis.

_

  
(i) The conclusive evidence clause

_

17\. I deal first with the conclusive evidence clause as contained in
resolution (G). To paraphrase this, it provides that as between DBS and BCPL a
copy of a resolution of BCPL is conclusive evidence of the passing of that
resolution as long as that copy is certified as correct by the chairman of the
meeting and by the company secretary or another director. In this case, one of
the documents sent to DBS on 23 July 1997 was an extract of the resolution
rescinding the signing instructions contained in the original mandate and
appointing Mr Phua as the sole signatory of the account. This extract was
certified as a true copy of a resolution passed by the company by the
signatures of Mr Phua as a director and Mr Chua as the company secretary.

18\. It was submitted on behalf of BCPL that a conclusive evidence clause
cannot apply where the purported act relied on is a nullity. _Halsbury’s Laws
of Singapore_ Vol 10 para 120.021 was cited. This paragraph reads:

> ‘Conclusive evidence means evidence which must be accepted as proof and
> cannot be contradicted. Where the conclusive evidence is provided by a legal
> authority, it may, however, be challenged as being a nullity if the
> authority has acted in bad faith or in a ultra vires manner in giving the
> evidence.’

The analogy drawn by BCPL was that the conclusive evidence clause could be
challenged because the resolution relied on had been declared to be a nullity
by the court. I did not accept this argument. The passage from _Halsbury’s_
was dealing with a situation where evidence is provided to a court in bad
faith or in an ultra vires manner. In that case, the quality of the evidence
must be impugned. The conclusive evidence clause here was intended to give DBS
protection from irregularities in the internal management of BCPL and to
prevent BCPL from subsequently retracting from the effect of documents that it
had itself supplied DBS with. In that situation, no question of providing
substantial evidence to a court would arise and, further it would not be
unfair to allow DBS to rely on the clause to justify its actions.

19\. On the other hand, however, I took the view that a conclusive evidence
clause has to be interpreted strictly because the effect of such a clause is
to oust the court’s jurisdiction to consider all relevant facts before coming
to a conclusion. What the clause means is that once the matters stated in the
clause have been proven to exist, the court must draw a certain inference from
them and cannot look at other evidence which might contradict such an
inference. In this case, for the conclusive evidence clause to be relied on by
DBS, it had to show that it had been provided with an extract of a resolution
which had been certified as correct either by two directors or by one director
and the company secretary. The certification here came from one director and a
person purporting to be the company secretary. This person, Mr Chua, was not
in fact the company secretary as his appointment was null and void in that the
resolution appointing him to the post in place of The Mui Ngo was one of the
resolutions declared void by the court order. Even without such declaration
the resolution would have been a nullity as it was passed by only one director
of BCPL.

20\. Since the pre-condition for the applicability of the conclusive evidence
clause had not been fulfilled ie the extract had not been signed by the
correct persons, DBS could not rely on the conclusive evidence clause to
prevent BCPL from challenging the authenticity of the new mandate and holding
DBS to account for not continuing to comply with the original mandate. It
should also be noted that although the conclusive evidence clause was bandied
about both in evidence below and in submissions, it was not directly invoked
in the defence filed by DBS. Nor in fact was there even an indirect reference
to resolution (G) by way of a general reference to the contractual terms of
the relationship as embodied in the ten resolutions passed on January 1997.

_

  
(ii) The pleadings

_

21\. This brings me to the main issue of the appeal which was whether the
defence as pleaded by DBS entitled them to succeed on the grounds that were
found in their favour. A resolution of this issue depends on the construction
of the pleadings.

22\. I think it would be helpful to deal with the statement of claim and
defence in conjunction with each other, as far as possible. The first three
paragraphs of the statement of claim gave the particulars of BCPL and DBS and
stated that BCPL was at all material times a customer of DBS. These three
paragraphs were admitted by paragraph 1 of the defence.

23\. Paragraph 4 of the statement of claim stated that as BCPL was a customer
of DBS, DBS owed BCPL the contractual duty to honour BCPL’s written mandate or
order and/or to exercise due care in the discharge of DBS’s duties to BCPL. By
paragraph 2 of the defence DBS admitted only that they were under a duty to
honour BCPL’s written mandate. DBS denied the rest of paragraph 4 of the
statement of claim.

24\. Paragraph 5 of the statement of claim averred that at all material times
DBS had only been authorised to honour cheques issued by BCPL if the same had
been signed by Mr Peh and Mr Phua jointly. This was pursuant to the original
mandate dated 27 January 1997. In response paragraph 3 of the defence denied
that assertion except to the extent that it meant that DBS was authorised to
honour cheques issued by BCPL which were signed by Mr Peh and Mr Phua jointly
for the period from 27 January 1997 until 22 July 1997 (both dates inclusive).

25\. In paragraph 6 of the statement of claim it was averred that in breach of
DBS’s obligation to BCPL, DBS purporting to act on a forged and/or invalid
undated document which purported to rescind the original mandate, honoured
cheques signed only by Mr Phua. Short particulars of these cheques were then
given. In paragraph 7, BCPL averred that the new mandate relied upon by DBS
was made pursuant to a purported resolution of the board of BCPL passed on 23
July 1997 and that this resolution was declared null and void by the court
order. In paragraph 8, BCPL averred that by reason of these matters, the new
mandate was invalid and/or null and/or void and/or of no effect and at all
material times the original mandate was still operative and had not been
revoked by the new mandate. By reason of these matters, BCPL averred, in
paragraph 9, that DBS had wrongfully and without BCPL’s authority paid the
cheques referred to in paragraph 6 and wrongfully debited BCPL’s account with
the amounts of the same.

26\. The meat of BCPL’s claim was thus set out in paragraphs 6 to 9\. No
further reference to the statement of claim is necessary.

27\. The meat of the defence was in paragraphs 4, 7, 8 and 9 and it is
necessary to set these out in full:

_**

> **_‘4. The Defendants aver that from 23 July 1997 onwards, the Plaintiffs’
> only authorised signatory was Phua Ah Pok, and in this regard, the
> Defendants shall rely on two documents signed and executed by Phua Ah Pok as
> the Plaintiffs’ director and chairman of a Board of Directors meeting on 23
> July 1997, and by Chua Thong Jiang Andrew as the Plaintiffs’ company
> secretary, and given to the Defendants, namely:_**

> **_

(a) Extract of Resolution Passed by the Board of Directors of Bok Chee Seng
Construction Pte Ltd on 23 July 1997; and

(b) Change in Authorised Signatories – Resolution Passed by the Board of
Directors.

(hereinafter collectively "**the Mandate Documents** ")

5\. Paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim is denied, and the Defendants deny
that they had acted in breach of their purported obligations as pleaded or at
all.

6\. …

7\. In respect of paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim, the Defendants repeat
the contents of paragraph 4 of the Defence herein. The Defendants further aver
that the first time they had sight of the purported Order of Court dated 11
December 1998 in Originating Summons No. 1306 of 1998 was when the Plaintiffs’
solicitors, Messrs Tan Chew Yew & Partners, sent their letter dated 5 January
1999 to the Defendants enclosing by way of service the said purported Order of
Court dated 11 December 1998. Save as aforesaid, paragraph 7 of the Statement
of Claim is denied.

8\. In respect of paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim, it is denied that by
the matters as pleaded in the Statement of Claim or at all, the mandate
evidenced by the Mandate Documents is invalid and/or null and/or void and/or
of no effect. It is averred that at all material times, the Defendants acted
with authority and in accordance with the terms of the relevant mandate as
evidenced by the Mandate Documents. Save as aforesaid, paragraph 8 of the
Statement of Claim is denied.

9\. By reason of the matters aforesaid, paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim
is denied. The Defendants aver that the Plaintiffs’ alleged claim is in
respect of cheques issued by them for the period _from 16 August 1997 until 6
March 1998_ (both dates inclusive), as stated in paragraph 11 of the Statement
of Claim. The Mandate Documents reveal that the relevant mandate as evidenced
by the same was lawfully complied with by the Defendants when the Defendants
duly honoured the cheques signed by Phua Ah Pok, who was the duly authorised
sole signatory at the material times. The Defendants further aver that the
service of the Order of Court dated 11 December 1998 on them by Messrs Tan
Cheng Yew & Partners by their letter of 5 January 1999 does not
retrospectively or otherwise render the acts of the Defendants in honouring
the said cheques issued in the aforesaid period unauthorised and/or in breach
of the relevant mandate as aforesaid.’

28\. The submission made on behalf of BCPL at the appeal was that the above
quoted paragraphs of the defence made it plain that the essential point relied
on by DBS was that DBS had followed the terms of the new mandate and that was
the correct mandate to follow. In other words the defence case was that there
was no breach of contract and that DBS was authorised to debit BCPL’s account
in the way that they did.

29\. Counsel then referred to the following passage from _Modern Law of
Banking_ by E.P. Ellinger:

> ‘… The second function of a cheque, which defines its legal nature as
> between the customer and the bank, is that it constitutes an order or
> instruction issued by the former to the latter … This means that, as between
> the bank and the customer, the contractual relationship arising from the
> drawing of the cheque is primarily governed by the principles of the laws of
> agency. Consequently, the bank’s duty is to adhere strictly to the terms of
> its mandate. If the bank deviates therefrom, it does so at its peril. This
> point has been explained most clearly by Devlin J in a case relating to the
> liability of a bank that departed from the instructions given to it by the
> customer as regards the opening of a letter of credit:
>

>> It is a hard law sometimes which deprives an agent of the right to
reimbursement if he has exceeded his authority, even though the excess does
not damage his principal’s interests. The corollary … is that the instruction
to the agent must be clear and unambiguous.

>
> When this statement is applied to the unauthorised payment of a cheque, it
> means that the bank is not entitled to debit its customer’s account with the
> amount involved unless it can plead one of the recognised defences. These
> include, in the first place, the common law defences that can be raised by
> an agent who disobeys his principal, such as estoppel, ratification, and the
> ambiguity of the mandate … ’

30\. BCPL submitted that the case put forward by DBS was not one where it
admitted that the debiting of BCPL’s account was not authorised but asserted,
nevertheless, that DBS was not liable because of some accepted defence
available to a bank making payment in a breach of mandate case. DBS could have
pleaded first that they were authorised by the new mandate to act as they did
and also, secondly, in the alternative, that if the new mandate was not valid,
they were still entitled to rely on it because of the operation of resolution
(G) and/or the rule in _Turquand’s_ case. DBS did not so plead. Instead their
pleadings showed that they relied entirely on the validity of the new mandate
and the authority given thereby to them to pay out cheques signed solely by Mr
Phua. As such, they stood or fell by whether they were authorised to pay on
the cheques signed by Mr Phua solely and this meant that once it was held that
the new mandate was invalid, DBS’s case fell.

31\. Counsel for BCPL also contended that because of the narrow way in which
the issues were framed by the pleadings, other matters which could have
constituted a reply to any claim by DBS to be entitled to rely on the indoor
management rule were not brought into the action by way of a reply and
accordingly, no evidence had been, or could have been, adduced in respect of
such matters at the trial. Counsel asserted that had it been pleaded, that,
despite any irregularity or invalidity of the new mandate, DBS was
nevertheless entitled to rely on the same due to the indoor management rule
and their ignorance of the internal affairs of BCPL, BCPL would have been
entitled to plead, as a reply, all steps taken by Mr Peh to notify DBS of the
problems within the company and, on that basis, to contend that the
circumstances were such that reliance on the _Turquand_ rule could not be
allowed. BCPL would also have had more leeway in their examination of the
evidence given on behalf of DBS.

32\. I accepted the above arguments. Having read and carefully considered
paragraphs 4, 7, 8 and 9 of the defence, it appeared to me that the main plank
of the defence was that the new mandate was valid and that the order of court
operated solely between Mr Peh and Mr Phua and did not affect the validity of
the new mandate vis--vis DBS. I took the view that the new mandate was void
_ab initio_ since no valid resolution had been passed effecting it. The court
order which declared the new mandate to be null and void and/or rescinded was
declaring the existence a state of affairs that affected not only the parties
to the action but affected third parties as well. This did not mean that third
parties who had acted in reliance on the void mandate were automatically
liable for having done so. It did, however, mean that such third parties would
have to establish a legal reason why they should not be held liable.

33\. In order to show a legal reason to avoid liability, DBS would have had to
plead that reason. The purpose of the pleadings is to define the issues being
fought about. In this case, from the defence filed by DBS it appeared that the
issue being fought about was simply the validity of the new mandate. When BCPL
came into court they were prepared to fight and win or lose on that issue
alone. They were not alerted that even if they won on that issue, they would
have to fight an additional issue ie whether despite the invalidity of the
authority, due to other circumstances DBS was nevertheless entitled to act as
if the authority was valid and be protected from liability.

34\. That second issue was not addressed in the pleadings and no notice was
given to BCPL of it by any of paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 8 or 9 of the defence. Each
of those paragraphs emphasised the point that from 23 July 1997 onwards,
BCPL’s only authorised signatory was Mr Phua and the new mandate was not
invalid or null or void. DBS asserted that at all times they had relied on the
new mandate and had complied with the same. It was also clear that the only
documents relied on by DBS to support this stand were the documents given to
them on 23 July 1997 ie those described as ‘the Mandate Documents’. No
reliance was placed on the provisions of the original mandate. As such, once
‘the Mandate Documents’ were found to be of no legal effect, DBS lost the
pillar they were standing on and had no subsidiary pillars to support them.

35\. A detailed analysis of the defence supported BCPL’s submission. As
stated, the purpose of paragraph 4 was to aver that from 23 July 1997 BCPL’s
only authorised signatory was Mr Phua and to introduce ‘the Mandate
Documents’. Paragraph 5 of the defence was a straighforward denial of BCPL’s
assertion that DBS had been in breach of their obligation to be BCPL and had
purported to act on a forged or invalid mandate. This denial meant that DBS
had not acted on a forged or invalid mandate. As for paragraph 7 of the
defence, it was simply a repetition of paragraph 4 and an assertion of fact ie
that the first time DBS saw the order of court was when it was served on them
in January 1999. This assertion was meant to convey that DBS had no notice of
the irregularities in the new mandate or of the court proceedings relating to
it. By itself, however, this assertion did not amount to a fresh line of
defence as a bank which pays out on a forged cheque in ignorance of the
forgery is not excused from liability by reason only of such ignorance.

36\. Paragraph 8 of the defence could have contained the averment that
notwithstanding any invalidity or irregularity in the new mandate, DBS was
nevertheless entitled to rely on it for specified reasons and that the
payments made could not be impugned. It did not. Instead it contained only a
denial in the first sentence that the new mandate was invalid and, in the
second sentence, an averment that DBS had acted with authority because they
had acted in accordance with the terms of the new mandate. That must be the
meaning of the sentence ‘… at all material times, the Defendants acted with
authority and in accordance with the terms of the relevant mandate as
evidenced by the Mandate Documents’. No language was included in this sentence
to indicate that the words ‘with authority’ referred to anything other than
the new mandate.

37\. Paragraph 9 was in effect a repetition of paragraphs 7 and 8. DBS relied
on ‘the Mandate Documents’ to show that they had lawfully complied with BCPL’s
instructions by honouring cheques signed by Mr Phua who was asserted to be
‘the duly authorised sole signatory at the material times’. In the last
portion of the paragraph, DBS stated that the service of the court order on
them did not retrospectively render their acts unauthorised. There was no
recognition in this paragraph that their acts could have been unauthorised
from the beginning because of the nullity of the mandate and no assertion that
despite this possibility, they were nevertheless entitled to act as they did
because they could not be affected by irregularities within the company when
on the surface all documents appeared to be in order and all formalities
appeared to have been complied with.

38\. Before me it was contended on behalf of DBS that the pleadings were
adequate and that no further elaboration of their stand had been required in
the defence in the light of the well known rule that parties to actions are
not required to plead legal principles. The assertion was that the rule in
_Turquand’s_ case is a rule of law and thus may be relied on even though not
specifically pleaded. In my view this submission did not meet the objection
raised by BCPL. No doubt the rule in _Turquand’s_ case is a rule of law but in
order to invoke that rule of law certain facts have to be established. These
facts must be pleaded since it must be made clear what facts will be relied on
in support of the rule. Such a pleading would give notice of the defence to
the opponent and would enable the opponent to plead other facts (if available)
which would be material for the court’s assessment of whether the rule in
_Turquand’s_ case had been properly invoked or not. The basic function of
pleadings is to enable each party to the action and the court to know what
case is being brought by the other party. This function can only be fulfilled
when all relevant facts and averments are contained in the pleadings.

Conclusion

**

39\. I allowed the appeal by BCPL on the basis that the only defence pleaded
by DBS was that they acted with authority in that they relied on a valid
mandate. Once the court below had held, and rightly so, that the effect of the
court order was that the new mandate was null and void from the start, the
defence of DBS had to fail since the consequence of the new mandate being void
was that it was incapable of conferring any authority on DBS. DBS had
therefore acted without authority in paying out on cheques signed singly by Mr
Phua. With respect, it was my judgment that, on the pleadings as they stood,
the District Judge was not entitled to exonerate DBS from liability on the
basis of the conclusive evidence clause or the indoor management rule.
Accordingly, I gave judgment for BCPL in the amount claimed with interest and
costs both of the trial and of the appeal.
