Andrew Ang J:

1 The plaintiffs and the second defendant (“the Contractor”) entered into
arbitration proceedings over a dispute relating to the construction of the
plaintiffs’ house at No 2 Siglap Valley by the Contractor. The first defendant
(“John Ting”) was the arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings and has
written an arbitration award (“the Award”) which has yet to be collected by
either side. By way of this originating summons filed on 24 September 2008,
the plaintiffs sought, _inter alia_ , to set aside the Award and to refer its
disputes with the Contractor to the courts for resolution instead.
Subsequently, on 31 October 2008, the plaintiffs filed Summons No 4814 of 2008
with the following prayers:

1) |  pursuant to the Rules of Court Order 4 Rule 1, the matters pending in Originating Summons OS1231/2008/W _AND_ Originating Summons OS1807/2006/S _AND_ Suit 348/2006/M be consolidated on such terms as the Honourable Court thinks just;  
---|---  
2) |  any other directions which the Honourable Court deems fit and just in respect of and/or arising from the consolidation of the aforementioned three pending matters so as to ensure the economic, expeditious, fair and just resolution of all the pending matters;  
3) |  pursuant to the Rules of Court Order 28 Rule 8 and Order 5 Rules 2 and 4 the Originating Summons OS1231/2008/W be converted into a Writ of Summons and the proceedings should be continued as if the matter had been begun by Writ;  
4) |  any other directions which the Honourable Court deems fit and just in respect of and/or arising from the conversion of OS1231/2008/W into a Writ of Summons including but not limited to the requirements under Order 25 Rules 2 to 7;  
5) |  that the Police and/or the Commercial Affairs Dept (CAD) and/or any other appropriate Investigating Authority be directed to:  
|  a) |  speedily complete their investigations into Magistrate’s Complaint Nos. COM-002184-04 (CM-002943-04), COM-001081-04 (CM002436-04) and MAG-000262-05/C (CM-002282-05) and to _furnish their comprehensive report to this Court_ together with full details of the names, particulars (including NRIC No. and address) and nationality of parties named and/or identified in the report(s) and/or photographs;  
|  b) |  speedily investigate  
|  |  i) |  all allegations of fraud, fraudulent claims and cheating, falsification of bills and/or receipts made against the 1st and 2nd Defendants and/or their agents and/or staff and/or servants;  
|  |  ii) |  all allegations of criminal negligence due to loss of documents and/or any other evidence caused by and/or resulting from the actions/omission of the 1st Defendant  
And to submit their Report urgently and directly to this Honourable Court;  
6) |  any other relief and/or remedies as the Honourable Court deems fit and just;  
7) |  Costs.  
  
2 In this appeal from the Assistant Registrar’s decision disallowing the
plaintiffs’ application, the plaintiffs (who were unrepresented) and counsel
for the defendants appeared before me on 6 March 2009 for the purpose of
prayers 1 to 4, 6 and 7 set out in Summons No 4814 of 2008 ([1] above). Prayer
5 had been dealt with by Lee Seiu Kin J in _Anwar Siraj v Ting Kang Chung
John_ [2009] SGHC 71 where the learned judge declined to make the order prayed
for. The parties informed me that prayers 1 and 2 had also been dealt with in
Civil Appeal No 172 of 2008 where the Court of Appeal ordered that Originating
Summons Nos 1807 of 2006 and 1231 of 2008 (“OS 1231”) be consolidated. In
light of this development, the plaintiffs no longer sought consolidation of
Suit No 348 of 2006. Hence, the primary issue for my consideration raised by
prayers 3, 4, 6 and 7 was whether OS 1231 ought to be converted into a writ
action and what consequential orders, if any, should be made.

3 Order 28 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”)
which is concerned with the continuation of proceedings as if the cause or
matter was begun by writ provides that:

Where, in the case of a cause or matter begun by originating summons, it
_appears to the Court_ at any stage of the proceedings that the proceedings
_should for any reason_ be continued as if the cause or matter had been begun
by writ, it may order the proceedings to continue as if the cause or matter
had been so begun and may, in particular, order that pleadings shall be
delivered or that any affidavits shall stand as pleadings with or without
liberty to any of the parties to add thereto or to apply for particulars
thereof. [emphasis added]

The plaintiffs contend that conversion of the matter to a writ action should
be ordered for two reasons:

(a) The plaintiffs’ claim is based on an allegation of fraud; and

(b) There is a substantial dispute of facts of the matters at hand for which
affidavits only without cross-examination of witnesses will result in a
substantial miscarriage of justice.

4 When asked to elaborate, the first plaintiff referred to his first affidavit
filed on 24 September 2008 in which he had alleged (at [33], [52], [54], [72b]
and [73] to [79]) that John Ting had tried to charge both the plaintiffs and
the Contractor more than was due to him by way of arbitration fees and had
raised the fact (at [80] to [88]) that there were three criminal complaints
filed against John Ting alleging that he had unlawfully disposed of documents
submitted by the parties for the arbitration.

5 I found the plaintiffs’ submissions to be untenable. The former allegation
did not raise issues of fraud. Both the plaintiffs and the Contractor have
never accepted John Ting’s quantification of the fees and have refused to pay.
This was not a matter of fraud but merely a dispute as to the appropriate
amount of fees. With regard to the latter allegation, John Ting’s counsel
accepted that there were three such criminal complaints. After all, such
criminal complaints were a matter of public record and, if the allegation was
true, it would have been pointless for John Ting to deny it. In the final
analysis, it did not appear to me that there were substantial disputes of
fact. In these circumstances, I did not think it necessary for the matter to
be converted into a writ action and dismissed the plaintiffs’ application.

6 Nevertheless, in light of the first plaintiff’s insistence that it was
necessary to cross-examine the witnesses, I was prepared under O 28 r 9 of the
Rules to allow cross-examination of the witnesses. I limited this to the
affidavits (or part thereof) which he thought were absolutely essential for
him to cross-examine on and gave him time to consider this. The matter was
adjourned but on 20 March 2009, when parties returned, the first plaintiff
maintained the position that the matter should have been converted into a writ
action. When queried, he confirmed the plaintiffs’ intention to appeal.
Therefore, it would have been pointless to go through the exercise of
identifying the affidavits on which he should be permitted to cross-examine.

7 In the result, I dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal and ordered costs to be
fixed at $1,400 to the first defendant and $1,300 to the second defendant.
