**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

_

The background

_

1\. The defendants in this case entered into a contract of carriage sometime
at the end of 1995, whereby they agreed to ship various consignments of cargo
("the cargo") on board their vessel, the "_Patraikos 2_ " ("the vessel"). On
or about 7 January 1996, the vessel was navigating through the Singapore
Straits when it ran aground on the rocks of South Ledge, approximately 2.2
miles off the Horsburgh Lighthouse. The plaintiffs, who claimed to be the
owners of the cargo, alleged that the grounding led to ingress of seawater
into the vessel’s cargo holds. This in turn led to the cargo becoming
submerged, requiring rescue by professional salvors.

2\. The plaintiffs now bring the present action against the defendants,
claiming for damage sustained by their cargo. In so doing, the plaintiffs
based their claim on Art III rr 1 and 2 of the Hague Rules as amended by the
Brussels Protocol 1968 ("the Rules"). Rules 1 and 2 read:

> 1\. The carrier shall be bound before and at the beginning of the voyage to
> exercise due diligence to —
>

>> (a) Make the ship seaworthy.

>

>> (b) Properly man, equip and supply the ship.

>

>> (c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of
the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception,
carriage and preservation.

>
> 2\. Subject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly and
> carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods
> carried.

3\. It was the plaintiffs’ case that the defendants breached the duties
imposed by the above provisions. Amongst other things, the plaintiffs alleged
that the vessel’s Filipino second officer, Ben Gallardo Orlanda ("Orlanda"),
was not competent to serve on the vessel as second officer. They contended
that sometime in June 1989, Orlanda was second officer on another ship called
the _Saronikos II_ , which had also run aground. The plaintiffs further
alleged that the vessel had no proper bridge management team.

4\. The plaintiffs also contended that the grounding of the vessel alone could
not have resulted in damage to the cargo, but that entry of seawater was
facilitated by there being large corrosion holes in the vessel’s bulkhead.

5\. The defendants denied all the plaintiffs’ allegations. Firstly, they
contended that the vessel was in fact seaworthy. Apparently, the vessel had
been surveyed and classed in Belgium just before the voyage. The vessel had
then undergone extensive maintenance repairs at Rotterdam, and passed a
drydocking inspection. This included a thorough inspection of all her
compartments, which disclosed no defects therein. Secondly, the defendants
maintained that the ship was properly manned, to a level exceeding flag
requirements, by competent and certified officers and men. The defendants
further maintained that the ship was fully and properly equipped and supplied.
Finally, the defendants denied that any part of the ship was ever unfit or
unsafe for the reception, carriage or preservation of goods carried on board.

6\. In addition to the above contentions, the defendants also alleged that the
grounding of the vessel was caused by Orlanda’s negligence. In this regard,
the defendants relied on Art IV r 2 of the Rules, which reads:

> 2\. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage
> arising or resulting from —
>

>> (a) Act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot, or the servants
of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship.

>>

>> …

>>

>> (c) Perils, dangers and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters.

7\. Apart from the present action, other proceedings had also been instituted
against the defendants in England ("the English action") by various other
cargo owners whose cargo was also on board the vessel when the grounding took
place.

_

The documents discovered by the defendants

_

8\. On 8 October 1999, the defendants filed their list of documents for
discovery. The plaintiffs were dissatisfied with the list, and filed Summons-
in-Chambers 7688 of 1999, applying for a Further and Better List of Documents
and Affidavit Verifying the same. Some of the documents requested were those
which were referred to by documents disclosed in the defendants’ original
list. Some of the other documents were said to exist based on the surrounding
circumstances. The Assistant Registrar granted an order in terms, and the
defendants appealed by Registrar’s Appeal No. 600005 of 2000 (the defendants’
appeal). I dismissed the defendants’ appeal with costs when it came up for
hearing on 12 January 2000. The defendants have appealed against my decision
(in Civil Appeal No. 17 of 2000) in so far as they relate to the following
sets of documents ordered to be disclosed:-

> (i) Survey reports for the vessel’s Annual Class Survey, Annual Loadline
> Survey, Annual Construction Survey, Annual Safety Equipment Survey and
> Annual Cargo Gear Survey.
>
> (ii) Two faxes from Sinclair, Roche & Temperly (SRT) to Dioryx Maritime
> Corporation (Dioryx), dated 19 August 1996 and 3 September 1996
> respectively. (SRT are the defendants’ solicitors in the English action.
> Dioryx was the agent employed by the defendants to manage the vessel.)
>
> (iii) All documents, including surveys relating to class recommendations
> after survey of the vessel in Belgium.
>
> (iv) All invoices evidencing repairs made to the vessel in the past 5 years
> prior to grounding.
>
> (v) All classification survey reports/records, including but not limited to
> the Lloyd’s Classification Reports/Repairs, of the vessel for a period of
> five years prior to its grounding
>
> (vi) All documents pertaining to the grounding of the _Saronikos II_ in June
> 1989, including statements, if any, given by Orlanda in relation to the
> grounding.

I will now deal with each of these sets of documents in turn.

_

(i) Survey reports for the vessel’s Annual Class Survey, Annual Loadline
Survey, Annual Construction Survey, Annual Safety Equipment and Annual Cargo
Gear Survey.

_

9\. Before an application for discovery of particular documents will be
granted, the documents in question must be shown to "relate to matters in
question in the cause or matter" (see O 24 r 7(3) of the Rules of Court). In
this regard, the test laid in _Compagnie Financiere v Peruvian Guano_ [1882]
11 QBD 55 (at 63), should be borne in mind. A document relates to the matters
in question if:

> (i) they would be evidence upon any issue

> (ii) they contain information which may (as opposed to _must_) enable the
> party requiring the affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage
> the case of his adversary, or
>
> (iii) they may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have either
> of the two consequences in (ii) above.

As some cases have put it more simply, documents relate to matters in question
if they ‘throw light on the case’ (see _Merchants' & Manufacturers' Insurance
Co Ltd v Davies_ [1938] I KB 196 at 210, _Manilal & Sons (Pte) Ltd v Bhupendra
KJ Shan_ [1990] 2 MLJ 282).

10\. One of the ‘matters in issue’ in the present case would be, as can be
seen from the plaintiffs’ reliance on Art III r 1(a) of the Rules, whether the
vessel was seaworthy. Before a ship is deemed ‘seaworthy’, it must, amongst
other things, "be fit in design, structure, condition, and equipment to
encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage" (_Carver’s Carriage By Sea_ ,
13th ed. at para 147). That being the case, the reports for the vessel’s
Annual Class Survey, Annual Loadline Survey, Annual Construction Survey,
Annual Safety Equipment Survey and Annual Cargo Gear Survey would clearly
constitute evidence as to the seaworthiness of the vessel. I thus had no
difficulty in finding that these survey reports should be disclosed.

11\. I would also add that in filing their list of documents, the defendants
in the present case actually included the entire list of documents discovered
by the plaintiffs in the English action. Included in this list discovered in
the English action was a Greek letter, which had in turn made reference to the
above survey reports. Having chosen to disclose the entire list of documents
discovered in the English action, the defendants thereby implied that these
documents (including the Greek letter) are relevant. It would now lie ill in
their mouths to contend otherwise.

_

(ii) The faxes from SRT to Dioryx

_

12\. As mentioned above, the grounding of the vessel led to the English action
being commenced against the defendants. In the course of the proceedings in
the English action, correspondence was exchanged between SRT (i.e. the
solicitors for the defendants in the English action) and the solicitors for
the English plaintiffs. In one of the letters, dated 1 May 1997, SRT had
broached the issue of the qualifications of the vessel’s Chief Officer at the
time of grounding, one Aris Sporidis. Apparently, Aris Sporidis only had a
Second Mate’s Certificate. However, SRT stated in the letter that the
defendants’ agents who managed the vessel, Dioryx, employed officers based on
their experience and not only on the basis of their paper qualifications
alone. SRT further stated in the letter that the Greek authorities had been
prepared to give Aris Sporidis dispensations to act as Chief Mate, despite his
having only a Second Mate’s Certificate. The plaintiffs thus sought discovery
of certain faxes sent by SRT to Dioryx, and I allowed their application. The
defendants have appealed against my order with respect to two of the faxes
dated 19 August 1996 and 3 September 1996. I felt that the plaintiffs’
application for discovery of the faxes was justifiable, as these faxes would
throw light on the issue regarding Aris Sporadis’ qualifications. If he only
had a Second Mate’s Certificate, and was not genuinely qualified to act as
Chief Officer aboard the vessel, then this might support the claim that the
defendants failed to properly man the vessel, as required by Art III r 1(b) of
the Hague Rules (see also _The "Makedonia"_ [1962] 316, at 337-338, where it
was held that the shipowners’ failure to employ sufficiently experienced
engineers amounted to a breach of the obligation to properly man the ship).

13\. One of the objections raised before me by the defendants was that the
faxes were privileged. I rejected this argument. Apart from the statutory
protection afforded by s 128(1) of the Evidence Act Cap 97 to communications
between lawyers and their clients, it appears that there is also protection
afforded by the common law, which extends to certain communications made in
contemplation of litigation. The latter protection has been termed ‘litigation
privilege’, and consists of the following two limbs (see _Singapore Court
Forms and Precedents_ at para XIX p 203):

> (i) communications between the client’s professional legal advisers and
> third parties, if made for the _purpose_ of pending or contemplated
> litigation, and
>
> (ii) communications between the client or his agent and third parties, if
> made for the _purpose_ of obtaining information to be submitted to the
> client’s professional legal advisers for the purpose of obtaining advice
> upon pending or contemplated litigation.

14\. Of greater relevance to the present case is the above first limb, since
the faxes constitute communications between the defendants’ legal advisers
(SRT) and a third party (i.e. Dioryx). In _Wheeler v Le Marchant_ (1881) 17
Ch.D. 675, Cotton LJ held (at 684-685):

> "Hitherto such communications" -- between a solicitor and a third person --
> "have only been protected when they have been in contemplation of some
> litigation, or for the purpose of giving advice or obtaining evidence with
> reference to it. And that is reasonable, because then the solicitor is
> preparing for the defence or for bringing the action, and all communications
> he makes for that purpose, and the communications made to him for the
> purpose of giving him the information, are, in fact, the brief in the
> action, and ought to be protected."

However, in _Secretary Of State For Trade And Industry v Baker_[1998] WLR 667,
Sir Richard Scott VC considered _Wheeler v Le Marchant_ , and held (at 675):

> These citations make clear, in my opinion, that documents brought into being
> by solicitors for the purposes of litigation were afforded privilege because
> of the light they might cast on the client's instructions to the solicitor
> or the solicitor's advice to the client regarding the conduct of the case or
> on the client's prospects. _There was no general privilege that attached to
> documents brought into existence for the purposes of litigation independent
> of the need to keep inviolate communications between client and legal
> adviser. If documents for which privilege was sought did not relate in some
> fashion to communications between client and legal adviser, there was no
> element of public interest that could override the ordinary rights of
> discovery and no privilege_. [emphasis added].

15\. Thus, in order to have the benefit of the privilege, the defendants had
to show that the faxes sent by SRT to Dioryx either reflected the defendants’
instructions to SRT in some way, or somehow gave an indication of the legal
advice that SRT would be giving the defendants; this they failed to do.
Accordingly, I held that the faxes should be disclosed.__

_

(iii) All documents, including surveys relating to class recommendations after
survey of the vessel in Belgium

_

16\. These documents related to the seaworthiness of the vessel, and thus
clearly "relate to matters in question" in this case. The plaintiffs had
adduced evidence before me to the effect that the survey in Belgium took place
just a matter of months before the grounding occurred, so these documents
would be all the more relevant in establishing the seaworthiness (or the lack
thereof) of the vessel.

_

(iv) All invoices evidencing repairs made to the vessel in the past 5 years
prior to grounding

_.

17\. Again these documents are relevant in determining the seaworthiness of
the vessel, so they should be disclosed. In fact, they are particularly
relevant, bearing in mind that there was evidence adduced by the plaintiffs
that several tons of rust were removed from the hull of the vessel when it was
being repaired in Rotterdam, just before the grounding.

18\. In the course of submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that it
would be oppressive for the defendants to be made to produce these documents,
which stretched back for a period of 5 years. I did not find this to be the
case. Of course there may be times when the sheer volume of the documents
requested might render the application for discovery oppressive. In _Science
Research Council v. Nass_ [1980] A.C. 1028, Lord Edmund-Davies remarked (at

1076):

> Again, a request for inspection of a great mass of documents, without any
> attempt at selection, could well be regarded as oppressive.

That does not appear to be the case here. There is no evidence that the volume
of documents involved will be so massive that the defendants will find
discovery oppressive.

_

(v) All classification survey reports/records, including but not limited to
the Lloyd’s Classification reports/repairs, of the vessel for a period of five
years prior to its grounding

_

19\. These documents are relevant in that they again pertain to the
seaworthiness of the vessel. In their defence, the defendants claimed that the
vessel was "in class and in possession of current and valid Safety
Construction and Loadline Certificates" ( at para 7(i)(a) of Defence). The
documents that had been requested by the plaintiffs under this head will go to
show whether the defendants’ claim is true.

_

vi) All documents pertaining to the grounding of the Saronikos II in June
1989, including statements, if any, given by Orlanda in relation to the
grounding

_

20\. It appeared that even before the grounding of the vessel, Orlanda had
been connected with another marine accident involving the ship "_Saronikos II_
", of which he had also been second officer. After the grounding of the
vessel, a statement had been taken from Orlanda where he claimed that the
"_Saronikos II_ " had only been involved in a minor collision, and that the
"_Saronikos II_ " suffered no damage. The plaintiffs however adduced evidence
that the "_Saronikos II_ ", far from being involved in merely a minor
collision, had actually been grounded (as was the case with the vessel) The
plaintiffs further contended that Orlanda had been on the bridge when the
grounding of the "_Saronikos II_ " occurred. I was of the view that all the
documents pertaining to the grounding of the "_Saronikos II_ ", including
statements, if any, given by Orlanda in relation to the grounding, were
relevant to matters in question in this case. If these documents indicated
that the grounding of the "_Saronikos II_ " resulted from Orlanda’s
incompetence or negligence, then the plaintiffs were entitled to use the
evidence to argue that the defendants, in engaging Orlanda, failed to properly
man the ship, knowing his past employment history..

_

Conclusion

_

21\. For all the aforesaid reasons, I dismissed the defendants’ appeal.
