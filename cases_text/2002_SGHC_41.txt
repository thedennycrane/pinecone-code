Facts

**

This is an appeal against the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar in
which he dismissed the application of the defendant bank for judgment against
the plaintiff, Ow, under the counterclaim pursuant to O 27 r 3. The bank had
counterclaimed against Ow for the repayment of the outstanding balances and
interest in a facility. The bank applied for judgment on the basis that Ow had
admitted that he was liable to the bank for the amount he had used to
discharge an overdraft facility.

**

Held, dismissing the appeal:

**

(1) Order 27 r 3 relates to admissions of fact, whether in the pleadings or
otherwise. If the liability turns on a question of law or mixed law and fact,
admissions of fact alone cannot determine the matter (see 16); _Shunmugam
Jayakumar v Jeyaretnam_[1997] 2 SLR 172 applied.

(2) Although Ow had admitted to drawing down the sum in question, he had
pleaded that the bank was precluded from recovering from him in view of the
alleged breaches of the Banking Act and MAS Notices. If he is right on this
issue, then he would not be liable. To give judgment for the bank against Ow
would determine this issue (see 17).

(3) In an application under Order 27 r 3, the court would only consider
whether there is a clear admission of any fact that would entitle the other
party to such judgment as he may be entitled to upon those admissions. The
court would not examine the likelihood of success of any pleading – unlike in
an application under Order 14. Order 27 r 3 is intended to provide an
immediate judgment based on clear admissions of fact and there is no scope for
any consideration of the veracity of the pleadings unless it is clearly
untenable (see 17); _Rankine v Garton Sons & Co _Ltd [1979] 2 All ER 1185
applied.

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1 This is an appeal against the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar in
SIC 602105/2001 in which he dismissed the application of the Defendant ("the
Bank") for judgment against the Plaintiff ("Ow") under the Bank’s counterclaim
in the sum of $10,767,707.18 under O 27, r 3 of the Rules of Court. On 8
January 2002, after hearing counsel for the parties, I dismissed the Bank’s
appeal with costs. On 6 February the Bank filed a notice of appeal against the
whole of my decision and I now give my written grounds of decision. **

  
Statement of Claim

**

2 The following are the salient points pleaded by Ow in his Statement of
Claim. The Bank is incorporated in Switzerland and has a branch in Singapore.
Ow had been a customer of the Bank since 23 April 1997, when he signed a
Facility Agreement with the Bank in which he obtained a multi-currency
overdraft facility of up to the equivalent of US$10 million ("the Facility").
At that time Ow had an overdraft account with the Bank of America ("BOA"). The
sole purpose of this exercise was to obtain a Singapore dollar loan at a lower
rate of interest than what he was paying in his BOA overdraft. His dealings
with the Bank were conducted through Ho Yong Chong ("Ho"), an employee of the
Bank at the material time. Prior to the opening of the Facility, Ho had
represented to him that he could draw down on the Facility entirely in
Singapore dollars notwithstanding that it was structured as a multi-currency
facility. At all material times the Bank, through Ho, was fully aware that Ow
wished to draw down on his loan in Singapore dollars in order to discharge his
outstanding BOA overdraft which was in Singapore dollars. The Facility, which
was secured by a mortgage over his wife’s property, was opened in reliance
upon Ho’s representations.

3 On 28 July 1997 Ow, intending to draw down on the Facility to fully
discharge his BOA overdraft which stood at approximately $10 million, went to
see Ho about this. After checking with the Bank’s Credit Manager, Ho advised
Ow that the Bank did not have sufficient Singapore dollars at the time and
only $3 million had been approved for drawdown. The balance sum could be drawn
down in US dollars. Ho had represented to Ow at the time that, as the Bank was
obliged to provide him with Singapore dollars under the Facility, it would
shortly convert the US dollar drawdown into Singapore dollars. In reliance of
this assurance, Ow proceeded with the drawdown partly in Singapore dollars and
partly in US dollars and used it to discharge the BOA overdraft which stood at
$10,767,707.18.

4 The Bank subsequently refused to convert the US dollar component of the
drawdown to Singapore dollars despite his repeated requests on various dates
in 1997 and 1998. The Bank gave the reason that it did not have sufficient
Singapore dollars available to convert the whole of his drawings. When the
1997 economic crises hit in late 1997, Ow found that the amount purportedly
outstanding in the foreign currency component of his drawings increased
dramatically. The Facility Agreement provided for the drawdown to be within
80% of the value of the mortgaged property. Due to the currency fluctuation
and falling property values, the Bank constantly pressured him to reduce the
overdraft to keep it within the limit.

5 Ow further pleaded that another of the Bank’s officers, Davartz, had asked
him to introduce new customers to the Bank. In particular Davartz asked
whether he could meet Ow’s two sons, who were based in Johore Bahru, to
discuss the opening of a Share Trading Account. Ow arranged for them to meet
in Johore Bahru on 25 September 1997\. Thereafter Ow’s sons opened a Share
Trading account with the Bank. Ow said that the express agreement or
understanding was that this account would be separate and distinct from his
accounts. The Bank subsequently reneged on that understanding and sought to
treat the shares deposited by his sons as security for the Facility. His sons
applied in the Malaysian courts for an injunction restraining the Bank from
disposing their shares to settle Ow’s debts. An injunction was granted.
However the Bank breached the injunction and sold the shares in October 1999.
This matter is the subject of legal proceedings in Malaysia.

6 On 29 July 1999 the Bank agreed to convert into Singapore dollars up to the
equivalent of $10 million of the foreign currency component of the drawdown.
The Bank refused to convert the entire foreign currency component. However on
30 August 1999 the Bank agreed to full conversion.

7 On 1 September 1999 the Bank made a written demand for Ow to make full
payment of the sums of about $11.15 million and 558 million. The Bank gave Ow
two options, either pay the sum of US$1.2 million by 6 September, or sign a
mandate to the Bank to authorise it to realise all assets deposited and
charged to it, without specifying what those assets were or whether they
included the shares deposited by his sons in respect of their Share Trading
Account. Ow did not accept either option. The Bank’s solicitors, M/s Khattar
Wong & Partners ("KWP"), sent a letter dated 8 September 1999 in which they
gave notice of termination of the Facility and demanded full payment of the
sums set out above.

8 On 8 October 1999 KWP wrote to Ow’s wife demanding payment of the said sums.
On 20 October, KWP served a notice on the mortgaged property requiring the
occupiers to quit and deliver vacant possession within one month. On 3
December 1999 the Bank commenced an action in respect of the mortgaged
property in OS 1883/1999 in respect of the following sums:

> Principal advanced up to 12 October 1999: | $19,743,516.90  
> ---|---  
> Principal repaid: | $ 3,867,554.13  
> Principal outstanding on 3 December 1999: | $15,993,367.51  
> Interest outstanding on 3 December 1999: | $ 37,595.37  
> Total outstanding on 3 December 1999: | $16,030,962.88  
  
9 Ow claimed that he had suffered loss and damage arising from the Bank’s
failure to provide him with Singapore dollars for his initial drawdown in July
1997 and its subsequent failure to convert the foreign currency component to
Singapore dollars. Ow prayed for a declaration that he was only liable to pay
the Bank an amount represented by the Singapore dollar equivalent of his first
drawdown on 28 July 1977 together with interest thereon less all sums paid
into the account.

10 On 4 July 2000 Ow amended the Statement of Claim to include the pleading
that in entering into the Facility Agreement, the Bank was in breach of s
29(1)(a) of the Banking Act as well as Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS")
Notices 1001 and 1012 relating to limits on credit facilities to a single
borrower. This amendment was made after further discovery by Ow’s solicitors
of documents from the Bank. Ow pleaded that such breach rendered the Facility
Agreement illegal and this precluded the Bank from making any claim whatsoever
against him in respect of the Facility. He prayed for a declaration that the
Bank was precluded from claiming against him as a result of this breach.

**

  
Defence and Counterclaim

**

11 The Bank pleaded as follows in its Defence and Counterclaim. The Facility
Agreement was expressly stated to be a multi-currency account. Ho had not made
any of the representations alleged by Ow. The Bank had no obligation under the
Facility Agreement to obtain sufficient Singapore dollars for Ow to drawdown
on. All foreign currency drawdowns were made by Ow willingly and he had made
use of the Facility to engage in currency speculation.

12 In respect of the alleged breaches of the Banking Act and MAS Notices, the
Bank pleaded at no time had it committed any such breaches.

13 The Bank counterclaimed against Ow for the repayment of the outstanding
balances in the Facility which, on 14 December 1999 stood at $15,875,962.77 in
respect of the principal and $170,374.69 in respect of unpaid interest. The
Bank also claimed further interest from 14 December 1999 and expenses and
legal costs on an indemnity basis.

**

  
Application under O 27, r 3

**

14 The Bank’s present application is under O 27, r 3 of the Rules of Court
which provides as follows:

> **
>
> Judgment on admission of facts (O 27, r 3)
>
> **
>
> 3\. Where admissions of fact are made by a party to a cause or matter either
> by his pleadings or otherwise, any other party to the cause or matter may
> apply to the Court for such judgment or order as upon those admissions he
> may be entitled to, without waiting for the determination of any other
> question between the parties, and the Court may give such judgment, or make
> such order, on the application as it thinks just.

15 Counsel for the Bank, Mr Tay, submitted that Ow had pleaded that he had
drawn down the sum of $10,767,707.18 on 28 July 1997 to discharge the BOA
overdraft account. Therefore Ow had admitted that he was liable to the Bank
for at least that sum.

16 Order 27, r 3 relates to admissions of fact, whether in the pleadings or
otherwise. If the liability turns on a question of law or mixed law and fact,
admissions of fact alone cannot determine the matter – see _Shunmugam
Jayakumar v Jeyaretnam_ [1997] 2 SLR 172 at 35 & 36\. Therefore where a
defendant admits to negligence but denies causation there is no admission of
liability – see _Blundell v Rimmer_ [1971] 1 All ER 1072 which is approved by
the Court of Appeal in _Rankine v Garton Sons & Co Ltd_ [1979] 2 All ER 1185.
There must be _"a clear admission of facts in the face of which it is
impossible for the party making it to succeed"_ \- _per_ Sargant J. in _Ellis
v Allen_ [1914] 1 Ch. 904 at p.909. In that case the defendant’s counsel was
not able to show how, with the admissions made, the defendant would be able to
succeed in defending the action. Sargant J. gave judgment against the
defendant saying (at p.909):

> "I cannot conceive any circumstances which the defendant Allen could rely on
> as a defence to the action, having regard to the admissions made by the
> letter, and I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against him
> under [this rule]"

17 In the present case, although Ow had admitted to drawing down the sum in
question he had, crucially, pleaded that the Bank was precluded from
recovering from him in view of the alleged breaches of the Banking Act and MAS
Notices. If he is right on this issue, then he would not be liable. To give
judgment for the Bank against Ow would determine this issue. In an application
under this rule the court would only consider whether there is a clear
admission of any fact that would entitle the other party to such judgment as
he may be entitled to upon those admissions. The court would not examine the
likelihood of success of any pleading – unlike in an application under O 14\.
Order 27, r 3 is intended to provide an immediate judgment based on clear
admissions of fact and there is no scope for any consideration of the veracity
of the pleadings unless it is clearly untenable. In _Rankine v Garton Sons &
Co Ltd_, Stephenson LJ. said at p.1190:

> "… the plaintiff is seeking immediate judgment on admissions of fact, and
> under the express terms of the rule under which he seeks it the court has to
> be satisfied that he is entitled to it, and to be entitled to it he has to
> prove both elements of his cause of action; and nothing short, it seems to
> me, of a clear admission of liability, both of negligence causing the
> accident and of damage resulting from the accident caused by the negligence,
> is enough to satisfy the requirements of the rule and to entitle him to
> judgment. If he cannot point to an admission in clear terms of both the
> necessary ingredients of his cause of action, he cannot get an interlocutory
> judgment. He must wait until the judge tries the issue of damages ..."

18 In the premises, I dismissed the Bank’s appeal with costs.
