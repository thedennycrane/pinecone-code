Mitigation Plea

3\. Counsel for the accused urged the court to take into account the accused’s
plea of guilt as a mitigating factor. He submitted that the accused realised
that what he did was wrong. He admitted his wrong to the police in his first
statement and had maintained that stand throughout. Counsel submitted that
only a sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed because:

> (a) no acts of violence or injury was inflicted on the victim;
>
> (b) although there were some words of threats uttered to the victim, none of
> the threats were carried out;
>
> (c) the victim was not specifically targetted;
>
> (d) the victim was taken care of and provided with food and her daily needs
> while under captivity.

4\. Counsel stated that the accused deeply regretted the trauma caused to the
victim including the pain and hardship caused to the family. Additionally, he
would testify for the prosecution in the pending trial against his
accomplices, Zhou Jian Guang and Shi Song Jing. Some personal background of
the accused was given as part of the mitigation. Apparently, the accused was
driven to commit the kidnapping because of the heavy financial losses he
suffered in his share trading and the mounting medical bills arising from the
late stage of his wife’s pregnancy at that time. He was desperate. He
therefore suggested the kidnapping scheme to Jian Guang and Song Jing whereby
they could all be enriched. Counsel explained that the accused had to hire the
van and rent the house to hide the kidnapped victim because his accomplices
were foreign Chinese nationals and had no valid documents. It was not disputed
by the prosecution that the accused fully cooperated with the police in their
investigations and had led the police to the place where the victim was
detained. He had informed the police of the identity of his accomplices and
had assisted the police officers in trapping them.

5\. Counsel further submitted that caning was inappropriate and that life
imprisonment itself was a sufficient deterrent. He referred me to:

1\. _Sia Ah Kew & Ors v. P.P._ (1972-1974) SLR 208

2\. _P.P. v. Lee Soon Lee Vincent_ (1998) 3 SLR 552 @ 555

**

My decision

**

6\. I did not think it was appropriate to sentence the accused to death as the
accused had pleaded guilty, he and his two accomplices were not armed and the
victim was not ill-treated or hurt in any way except for the trauma which she
suffered from being kidnapped and blindfolded for a considerable period of
time. I decided that the alternative sentence of life imprisonment was the
proper sentence in the particular circumstances of this case. However, I was
at first minded to impose 6 strokes of the cane on the accused having regard
to the fact that he was the mastermind, who hatched this detestable criminal
scheme to kidnap for ransom a young vulnerable schoolgirl and he had further
drawn in other persons to help him carry it through. A young schoolgirl was
made to suffer the trauma of being kidnapped and blindfolded for some 60
hours. Sometimes the deleterious psychological effects could be more serious
and longer lasting than the pain from physical injury. The victim’s parents
and other family members must have been put to extreme anxiety and worry, more
particularly since the kidnappers had threatened to kill the child if the
ransom sum was not paid.

7\. After hearing the persuasive mitigation by defence counsel, I invited the
prosecution to submit on the sentence. However, the learned DPP, Mr Francis
Tseng, informed me that he was not making any submissions.

8\. Therefore, having regard to the accused’s plea of guilt, the absence of a
criminal record, his full cooperation with the police during the entire
investigations, his willingness to testify for the prosecution against his
accomplices, the character references that were placed before me, and after
taking into account other significant facts that the kidnappers were not
armed, the victim was not hurt and was well looked after and released as soon
as the ransom was paid, I decided to be lenient to the accused and did not
impose any caning. Accordingly, I sentenced him to the minimum sentence of
life imprisonment without any caning and backdated that sentence to the date
of his remand. Despite this, the accused is dissatisfied with the sentence and
has appealed.

Dated this 4th day of May 2000.
