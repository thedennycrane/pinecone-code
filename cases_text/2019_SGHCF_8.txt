23 April 2019 Judgment reserved.

Tan Puay Boon JC:

Introduction

1 The Plaintiff (“Wife”) was born in 1948, and turns 71 this year. The
Defendant (“Husband”) was born in 1939, and turns 80 this year. They
(collectively “Parties”) were married in 1973 in Singapore, and have three
children. The eldest daughter was born in 1975 and the second daughter was
born in 1977. They and their families now live in Europe and North America,
respectively. The youngest son was born in 1987 and now lives in Singapore.

2 The Parties started leading separate lives in 2012, including sleeping in
separate bedrooms. They were then married for around 39 years. In August 2017,
the Wife filed for divorce on the basis of four years’ separation, and Interim
Judgment was granted in April 2018 on an uncontested basis, some 44 years into
the marriage. The ancillary matters were adjourned to chambers.

Matters in dispute

3 The contested ancillary matters to be decided are the division of the
matrimonial assets (which include the matrimonial home) and maintenance for
the Wife.

Division of matrimonial assets

The legal principles

4 The power of the court to divide matrimonial assets, and the matters that it
has to have regard to are set out in s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”). These matters include those which are relevant for the
assessment of maintenance for the wife set out in s 114 of the WC.

5 The Parties submitted that the matrimonial assets should be pooled and
divided. 1

##### Foot Note 1

×

Wife’s skeletal submissions at para 56 and Husband’s written submissions at
para 76(a).

Since this is not a case where there are multiple classes of assets to which
the parties had made different contributions (the Husband was responsible for
acquiring the assets as the Wife did not work), the “global assessment
methodology” is the appropriate methodology to be used here. This involves the
identification, assessment, division and apportionment of these assets: NK v
NL [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“NK v NL”) at [31].

Identification and Assessment of the matrimonial assets

6 Generally, the default date for the identification of matrimonial assets is
at the date of the Interim Judgment (ARY v ARX [2016] 2 SLR 686 at [31]), and
the assessment of their values is at the date of the ancillary matters
hearing: TND v TNC and another appeal [2017] SGCA 34 at [19]–[20]. The Parties
do not seek to depart from the default dates.

7 The Parties have signed a joint summary of relevant information, which they
updated on 4 January 2019. This summary sets out all their assets which are
jointly or individually owned. Since this was tendered after the hearing
before me, I consider it to reflect the Parties’ latest positions. While there
is no dispute as to whether any asset is a matrimonial asset, the values of
some of the assets are disputed. I will deal with these in turn.

Agreed Assets

8 The matrimonial assets with agreed values are set out in the table below:

S/No.| Description| Value ($)  
---|---|---  
| Joint Assets  
1\. | Matrimonial home| 6,500,000.00  
| Sub-total (A)| 6,500,000.00  
|  Wife’s Assets  
2\. | Shares| 585.20  
3\. | Unit Trusts| 98,337.66  
4\. | Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) monies| 7,938.88  
| Sub-total (B)| 106,861.74  
|  Husband’s Assets  
5\. | Shares with Standard Chartered Bank | 89,549.75  
6\. | Bank Accounts (disclosed in the Husband’s affidavit of assets and means)| 68,729.30  
7\. | AIA Regional Equity Fund| 2,774.00  
8\. | Stockbroking accounts (disclosed in the Husband’s ancillary affidavit dated 15 October 2018) | 46,913.69  
9\. | Bank Accounts (disclosed in the Husband’s ancillary affidavit dated 15 October 2018) | 5,972.20  
10\. | Bank Accounts (disclosed in the Husband’s ancillary affidavit dated 15 October 2018) (AUD 1,629.42)| 1,629.42  
11\. | Bank Accounts (disclosed in Husband’s ancillary affidavit dated 15 October 2018) (MYR 2,100.59)| 692.66  
12\. | CPF monies| 24,797.00  
| Sub-total (C)| 241,058.02  
| Total [(A) + (B) + (C)]| 6,847,919.76  
  
Assets with disputed values

9 Set out in the table below are assets where the values are disputed by the
Parties:

S/No.| Description  
---|---  
| Joint Assets  
1\. | European car  
2\. | Korean car  
3\. | Singapore country club membership  
4\. | Johor country club membership  
| Wife’s Assets  
5\. | Prudential Limited Pay insurance policy  
6\. | Prudential Vantage insurance policy  
7\. | Bank Accounts  
  
10 I will deal with these in turn.

(1) European car

11 The Husband values the car at $35,000 while the Wife values it at $28,000.
2

##### Foot Note 2

×

Joint summary at p 3.

Since neither party has tendered any documentary evidence to substantiate
their positions, and as their positions are not poles apart, I will adopt the
average value of $31,500.

(2) Korean car

12 The Husband values the car at $10,000 while the Wife has not taken a
position on the value of this car, even though she appears to disagree with
the Husband’s valuation. 3

##### Foot Note 3

×

Joint summary at p 3.

In the absence of any other evidence, I adopt the Husband’s value of $10,000.

(3) Singapore country club membership

13 The parties agree that the market value of this membership is $190,000.
However, the Husband submits that this is not a “true representation of the
value of the membership”; the transfer fee payable to the country club
($32,100) in the event of a transfer of this membership should be deducted to
arrive at an accurate value of this membership. 4

##### Foot Note 4

×

Joint summary at p 4.

The Wife disagrees and submits that the transfer fee should not be deducted
since the Husband wishes to retain the membership.

14 The Husband cites two cases in support of his submissions, the first of
which is Wee Beng Choo v Er Sye King [2003] SGDC 57, where the district judge
deducted the transfer fee from the values of the club memberships: at [26].
However, it is unclear from the judgment whether the deduction of the transfer
fee was in dispute in that case. The second case is the decision of the High
Court in Fong Wai Har v Seah Boon Chai and another [2016] SGHCF 4, where the
judicial commissioner accepted the husband’s argument “that the transfer fee …
ought to be deducted from [the country club’s valuation], given that any
transfer would necessarily incur that expense”: at [11]. However, it is
unclear from the judgment whether the husband was seeking to retain the
country club membership.

15 In the present case, the Husband has stated unequivocally that he is
“unwilling to sell the [country club] membership as it is [his] main source of
entertainment and exercise”. 5

##### Foot Note 5

×

Husband’s affidavit of assets and means at p 14.

The Wife does not object to the Husband’s retention of his membership. Since
the Husband does not wish to transfer the membership to someone else, I see no
reason to deduct the transfer fee from the value of the membership.

16 I also note that when a party retains property (such as a house) in his or
her own name in the event of a divorce, fees that are usually incurred in a
potential future sale (such as conveyancing fees) are not typically deducted
from the value of that property. Further, where real property (such as the
matrimonial home) is transferred from one party to another, it is typically
the transferee who bears the cost of any future transfer. Thus, by analogy, I
find it reasonable for the Husband, who will continue to retain the benefits
of the membership, to solely bear the notional cost of transfer as the
membership is already in his own name. I thus adopt the Wife’s valuation of
$190,000.

(4) Johor country club membership

17 The Wife values this membership at $6,666 while the Husband values this
membership at $4,333. The difference between the values of this asset given by
the Parties is again the transfer fees. For the same reasons given in
ascertaining the value of the Singapore country club membership, I hold that
the value of this asset is $6,666.

(5) Wife’s Prudential Limited Pay insurance policy

18 This is an insurance policy taken out in the Wife’s name. The Wife values
it at $33,000 while the Husband values it at $34,764.99. The Wife’s valuation
is based solely on the participating assured sum, and the Husband’s valuation
consists of that as well as the total guaranteed bonus as at 31 December 2016
and the 2017 guaranteed bonus. 6

##### Foot Note 6

×

Joint summary at pp 3–4. Wife’s affidavit of assets and means at p 33.

19 In my judgment, the bonuses should not be included in the value of the
policy. When valuing insurance policies, the courts generally take the
surrender value of the policies as the date of the ancillary matters hearing,
or any other date agreed by the parties. In other words, the courts do not
take into account any increase in the value of policies after the divorce
proceedings. Returning to the facts of this case, the bonuses which the
Husband has included are payable on claims or maturity only. 7

##### Foot Note 7

×

Wife’s affidavit of assets and means at p 34.

These are events which may or may not happen in the future; in other words,
the bonuses do not represent the present value of the policy. Accordingly, I
adopt the Wife’s value of $33,000.

(6) Wife’s Prudential Vantage insurance policy

20 This is another insurance policy taken out in the Wife’s name. The Wife
adopts the net cash surrender value of $26,156.37. The Husband adopts the
indicative current value of $32,709.34. 8

##### Foot Note 8

×

Joint summary at p 5.

It appears from a statement that the indicative current value is payable only
upon the Wife’s death. 9

##### Foot Note 9

×

Wife’s affidavit of assets and means at p 38.

For the reasons set out in the previous paragraph, I adopt the Wife’s value of
$26,156.37.

(7) Wife’s bank accounts

21 The Husband adopts the value of $73,226.47 while the Wife adopts the value
of $70,084.12. The difference is attributable to the Wife’s exclusion of
certain accounts which she claims she does not operate, and which she submits
should be listed under the Husband’s assets. 10

##### Foot Note 10

×

Joint summary at p 5.

Besides the relatively small difference between the two values, as will become
apparent below, it is not necessary to determine each party’s precise direct
financial contributions. Thus, it is also unnecessary to determine whether the
difference in value should be under the Husband’s or the Wife’s name. I will
adopt the Husband’s value of $73,226.47.

22 In summary, for the assets with disputed values, I set out in the table
below the values which the Wife and Husband submitted, and the values which I
have found:

Asset| Wife’s Value($)| Husband’s Value($)|  Court’s Value($)  
---|---|---|---  
Joint Assets  
European car| 28,000.00| 35,000.00| 31,500.00  
Korean car| | 10,000.00| 10,000.00  
Singapore country club membership| 190,000.00| 157,900.00| 190,000.00  
Johor country club membership| 6,666.00 (MYR 20,000)| 4,333.00 (MYR 13,000)|
6,666.00 (MYR 20,000)  
Sub-total (A)| 238,166.00  
Wife’s Assets  
Prudential Limited Pay insurance policy| 33,000.00| 34,764.99| 33,000.00  
Prudential Vantage insurance policy| 26,156.37| 32,709.34| 26,156.37  
Bank Accounts| 70,084.12| 73,226.47| 73,226.47  
Sub-total (B)| 132,382.84  
Total [(A) +(B)]| 370,548.84  
  
23 The total value of the pool of matrimonial assets is $7,218,468.60, as set
out below:

Class of Assets| Value ($)| Reference  
---|---|---  
Assets with agreed values| 6,847,919.76| [8] above.  
Assets with disputed values| 370,548.84| [22] above.  
Total| 7,218,468.60| -  
  
The appropriate division ratio

24 In ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ANJ v ANK”) the Court of Appeal laid out a
structured approach for the division of matrimonial assets. That structured
approach was succinctly summarised in TIT v TIU [2016] 3 SLR 1137 at [21] as
follows:

(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each
other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made
towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets (“Step 1”);

(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to
each other, having regard to both financial and nonfinancial contributions
(“Step 2”); and

(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking
an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as
“the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of
each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal
weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the
other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors
under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the
Charter”) (“Step 3”).

25 However, in TNL v TNK [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“TNL v TNK”), the Court of Appeal
cautioned that the structured approach in ANJ V ANK should not be applied to
single-income marriages: at [46]. This is because the working spouse would be
“accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions” and would “also be
accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or
her indirect financial contributions … even if he or she made little or no
non-financial contributions”. The non-working spouse is therefore “doubly and
(severely) disadvantaged”: at [44]. Thus, in single income marriages, the
court should tend towards equal division. In UBM v UBN [2017] 4 SLR 921, it
was clarified that a single-income marriage includes a marriage where one
party was primarily the breadwinner and the other primarily the homemaker.

26 This approach has been applied in a number of cases. In UMU v UMT and
another appeal [2019] 3 SLR 504, the parties were married for 22 years.
Although the Wife worked for a number of years, her monthly income was only
$650 to $900, a sum so low that she was unable to make any direct financial
contribution to the acquisition of matrimonial assets. In the circumstances,
the High Court recognised that the husband was the primary breadwinner and the
wife a primary homemaker, which resulted in the wife receiving 45% of the
assets (before taking into account an adverse inference drawn against the
husband). Another similar case is UKA v UKB [2018] 4 SLR 779, where the
parties were married for almost 28 years. The husband’s contributions were
“very substantial in the breadwinning role”, in building and running a company
which was the source of the family’s wealth. Conversely, the wife’s most
substantial contributions were in homemaking, largely in raising four
children. And while the Wife helped out in the company and the Husband also
spent time with the children, the High Court found that the marriage “was an
equal partnership of different efforts and should be recognised as such in the
division of assets”, and ordered that the assets be divided equally.

27 In my judgment, the present case involves a quintessential long single
income marriage. The Parties were married for 39 years before they started
leading separate lives: [2] above. The Wife was a homemaker throughout the
entire marriage. The Husband’s career took him to many countries: between 1973
and 1980, he was posted to Indonesia, Africa and the United States of America.
The Wife followed him overseas, where the children spent their initial years.
I recognise that it was not easy for the Wife to care for young children,
especially when the family was living in Khartoum, Sudan from 1975 to 1978,
when the daughters were still babies. There, the family experienced times of
food and petrol shortages. As the Husband accepted, it was a difficult posting
which he contemplated abandoning when he first arrived. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

Husband’s ancillary affidavit dated 15 October 2018 at para 55.

I also note that that was before a time where one could easily communicate
across borders with smart devices and social media. Thus, the Wife’s efforts
in caring for the family, particularly in the early years of the marriage,
were substantial. This was all the more the case as she did not always have
domestic help. On the other hand, I accept that the Husband played his part at
home whenever he could. However, the reality was that a substantial proportion
of time was spent on his career. Nevertheless, it was through his efforts that
the Parties were able to amass more than $7 million worth of assets.

28 Although each party attempted to accentuate their contributions while
downplaying that of the other party, this marriage is in my judgment “an equal
partnership of different efforts”. Applying the approach in TNL v TNK, I am of
the view that the pool of assets should be divided equally. Each party is
therefore entitled to $3,609,234.30 worth of assets.

Adverse inference

29 The Wife appears to suggest on affidavit that the Husband’s belated
disclosure of certain assets shows that he had failed to make full and frank
disclosure of his assets. She also suggests that the Husband may be earning
undeclared income. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

Wife’s ancillary affidavit dated 17 October 2018 at paras 8–16.

However, she did not request this court to draw an adverse inference against
the Husband in her written submissions or at the hearing before me.

30 In any event, I would have declined to do so. Mere suspicion is not enough
to ground an adverse inference: BOR v BOS and another appeal [2018] SGCA 78 at
[75]. Belated disclosures alone are also insufficient, because “parties to a
functioning marriage do not keep records of their transactions with a view to
building a case should a divorce occur”: TXW v TXX [2017] 4 SLR 799 at [46].

Distribution of matrimonial assets and consequential orders

31 The Parties should work out the consequential orders. If they are able to
agree on the consequential orders, they may send a draft to the court for
approval, indicating their consent, before extracting the orders. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Parties wish to sell the matrimonial home, any
refund to Parties’ respective CPF accounts required under the relevant CPF
provisions shall be made by each Party from his or her own share of the net
proceeds of sale. The Parties are to have liberty to apply within three months
of the date of this judgment in the event that they require further directions
on the sale of the matrimonial home.

Maintenance for the Wife

32 The power of the court to order maintenance for former spouses is set out
in s 113 of the WC, while the factors relevant to determining the quantum of
maintenance are stated in s 114. As for the applicable principles, the Court
of Appeal held in Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow [2012] 2 SLR 506 at [13]:

The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) of the Act is that of financial
preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard, which
is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had
enjoyed during the marriage. [emphasis added in bold]

33 Nevertheless, s 114(2) must be applied in a “commonsense holistic manner
that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of a
marriage”: at [16].

34 In the present case, the Husband turns 80 this year and has been retired
for around 20 years. Although he remains a consultant for what appears to be a
building company, a document printed with the company’s letterhead and signed
by a manager from the company confirms that the Husband receives no salary and
only CPF contribution of around $150 a month. 13

##### Foot Note 13

Husband’s ancillary affidavit dated 15 October 2018 at p 23.

The Wife does not challenge the authenticity of this document. And while the
Husband also receives dividends of about a few thousand dollars a year from
the shares which he owns, 14

##### Foot Note 14

×

Husband’s affidavit of assets and means at p 4.

his present income is relatively insubstantial compared to the assets which
the Parties have amassed. I also note that the Wife will receive $3,609,234.30
worth of assets. In my view, this is sufficient for her to live comfortably,
especially since, on her own evidence, her expenses amount to $3,000 a month.
15

##### Foot Note 15

×

Wife’s affidavit of assets and means at p 8.

35 Considering these circumstances in the round, I order that there be no
maintenance for the Wife. In coming to this decision, I also note the Wife’s
assertion on affidavit that: 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

Wife’s ancillary affidavit dated 17 October 2018 at para 78.

… my claim for lump sum maintenance is founded not on my dependence on the
[Husband], but in seeking some recognition to my sacrifice of my career as a
wife and mother in this long marriage.

36 However, this is not consistent with the purpose of maintenance, which is
financial preservation. Indeed, the High Court has recognised that
“maintenance is based on need and not on parties’ contributions to the
marriage”: BUX v BUY [2019] SGHCF 4 at [55].

Other issues

37 In his written submissions, the Husband points out that the Parties had in
2009 agreed to split household expenses equally following the sale of an
apartment where each party received an equal share of the sale proceeds. He
highlights that the Wife has only reimbursed him for her share of the
household expenses up to March 2018. He seeks an order that: 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

Husband’s written submissions at paras 73–75.

(a) the Wife is to make payment for the reimbursement claims for the months of
April 2018 to September 2018;

(b) the Parties continue to share household expenses equally between them as
per their previous agreement up until the sale of matrimonial home; and

(c) such sums shall be deducted from the Wife’s share of the proceeds from the
sale of the matrimonial home should the Wife fail to make the reimbursement
payments.

38 At the hearing, counsel for the Husband informed me that the Parties are
attempting to resolve this issue between themselves, but sought liberty to
apply in the event that they could not do so. I decline to grant such an
order. The claimed expenses for the month of April 2018 amounted to only
$1,063.42. 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

Husband’s affidavit of assets and means at pp 32–33.

Thus, the total claimed expenses is unlikely to be large, and will be
insignificant relative to the size of the pool of assets. I encourage them to
come to an agreement, failing which they would have to resolve their dispute
at a forum where the costs incurred will be commensurate with the amount
involved.

Conclusion

39 Although the Parties’ marriage was not always smooth-sailing, their efforts
led them to raise three children (all of whom excelled in sports at the
national level) while amassing considerable wealth. I hope that what the
Parties will understand from this judgment on how the matrimonial assets are
divided would provide both of them with some measure of closure, and enable
them to enjoy their golden years without further acrimony.

40 I encourage the Parties to agree on the issue of costs, including
considering the option of each of them bearing their own costs. If there is no
agreement, they are to file and exchange submissions on the issue of costs
(limited to five pages) within 14 days from the date of this judgment.
