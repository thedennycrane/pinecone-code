Lee Seiu Kin J:

1 In this originating summons (“OS”), the plaintiff applied for “an Order that
a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal be conducted by the Law
Society for our complaint against Mr Andre Francis Maniam and Ms Koh Swee Yen”
and “an Order for the Law Society of Singapore to refer this matter with clear
documentary evidence to the 3-Judges Court for appropriate action in order to
uphold if the Law Society has no power to interpret the law to enable them to
conduct a formal investigation from the clear and solid evidence already with
them”.

2 This matter has a rather long history. On 27 May 2008, the plaintiff lodged
a complaint to the Law Society (“TLS”) against Mr Andre Francis Maniam and Ms
Koh Swee Yen (“the Solicitors”). TLS appointed inquiry committee no 55 of 2008
(“IC55/2008”) to investigate the matter. After due inquiry, which included
conducting a hearing and considering submissions of both sides, IC55/2008
found that a formal investigation was not necessary as there was no merit in
the plaintiff’s complaints. IC55/2008 published its report on 6 May 2009.
Dissatisfied with the decision of IC55/2008, the plaintiff filed originating
summons no 849 of 2009 to apply for an order under s 96 of the Legal
Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) directing the appointment of a
Disciplinary Tribunal. This was heard by Andrew Ang J on 16 November 2009 at
the end of which he dismissed the application with costs fixed at $5,000. Less
than one month later, on 7 December 2009, the plaintiff lodged another
complaint with TLS against the Solicitors. TLS appointed inquiry committee no
18 of 2010 (“IC18/2010”) which investigated the matter and published its
report on 29 February 2012. IC18/2010 observed that the plaintiff had made the
same complaint that was dealt with by IC55/2008. However, noting that the
plaintiff had asserted that this was a “fresh complaint”, IC18/2010 considered
the merits of the complaint and decided that it should be dismissed with no
further action to be taken against the Solicitors.

3 Dissatisfied with the decision of IC18/2010, the plaintiff took out this OS
on 19 April 2012. I heard the parties on 6 August 2012. The plaintiff acted in
person and tendered his written submissions, which he supplemented with an
oral submission. Counsel for TLS also tendered his written submissions. After
hearing both sides I concluded that the decision of IC18/2010 was correct for
the reasons given in paras 10 and 11 of its report of 29 February 2012. I was
therefore satisfied that there was no ground to make the order prayed for
under s 96 of the Legal Profession Act and dismissed the OS with costs fixed
at $4,000.
