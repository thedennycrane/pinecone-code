**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_**

Introductory **_

1 The first plaintiff, Praptono Honggopati Tjitruhopojo (‘Praptono’), a
principal figure in these proceedings, is an Indonesian entrepreneur
particularly in the Indonesian petroleum exploration sector. The other four
plaintiffs are companies incorporated in the Republic of Indonesia and under
his control. The defendant is the Crown Prince (Tunku Mahkota) of the State of
Johor in Malaysia. None of the parties to the proceedings is resident in
Singapore.

2 The claim, the court was told, was based on two oral agreements entered
into, in the main, between the first plaintiff and the defendant on 27
November 1994 and 31 May to 1 June 1995, respectively in connection with a
petroleum project in Indonesia in which the plaintiffs and the defendant were
intending to participate. It was alleged that under these agreements, the
defendant undertook to provide the entire financing for the said petroleum
project in consideration for a substantial equity in the proposed project.

3 Alleging breach of the said oral agreements on the part of the defendant,
which I shall amplify later the plaintiffs have commenced this action in
Singapore on the basis that these two oral agreements emanated in Singapore.

4 The defendant, after entering appearance, applied to the court to stay
proceedings on grounds of _forum non-conveniens_ under para 9 of the First
Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed). He was
unsuccessful before the learned Assistant Registrar. He appealed and after
hearing arguments, I allowed the appeal and granted the stay requested. My
reasons now follow.

Pleadings and averments

**_

5 The background facts, insofar as they are material and as could be gathered
from the statement of claim, affidavits filed and arguments presented, are as
follows.

6 The first plaintiff is an Indonesian businessman, residing in Indonesia. He
is the president director of the second defendants. The third, fourth and
fifth defendants are the subsidiaries of the second defendants. The second to
the fifth defendants are generally known as the ‘UPG’ group of companies. The
first plaintiff is said to be the authorised representative of the said UPG
group.

7 The defendant as mentioned earlier, is the Crown Prince of Johor. Besides
being a prince, he is also involved in many commercial ventures.

8 It would seem that in the course of 1992 and 1993, the UPG group entered
into four Technical Assistance Contracts (TAC’s) with Indonesia’s national
petroleum enterprise known as Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi
Negara (‘Pertamina’) by which the UPG group secured some exclusive concession
rights to explore, develop, produce and sell oil and gas from different oil
and gas concession areas for gain. Under the contracts, the UPG group also had
the right to divest up to 49% of their rights to any third party.

9 The first plaintiff alleged that the defendant, having knowledge of the said
impending petroleum venture, showed a keen interest to invest in the project.
Consequently, the defendant, through his agent, one Datuk Hamzah bin Mohd
Noor, obtained various due diligence reports and information on the concession
areas from the chief executive officer of the UPG group. The upshot was that
the first plaintiff was invited to attend the defendant’s birthday party at
the Raffles Marina in Singapore on 26 September 1994.

_**

  
The first oral agreement

**_

10 The first plaintiff’s averment was that on 27 September 1994, whilst at the
Raffles Marina in Singapore, both he and the defendants entered into an oral
agreement in relation to the said petroleum venture. The terms of that
agreement according to the first plaintiff were as follows:

> (a) that in consideration of the Plaintiffs agreeing to sell to the
> Defendant forty-nine per cent (49%) of the rights and interests in the TACs
> from the 2nd to the 5th Plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to as the "Farm-Out
> Rights") the Defendant agreed to expeditiously arrange for the _entire
> financing of and technical assistance for the Petroleum Operations_ ; and
>
> (b) Further in consideration of the 1st Plaintiff procuring for the
> Defendant, from the 2nd to the 5th Plaintiffs, an exclusive option (for a
> period of time to be agreed upon) to purchase the said Farm-Out Rights, the
> Defendant agreed to pay to the benefit of the 2nd to the 5th Plaintiffs
> initial working capital for the Petroleum Operations; and
>
> (c) to execute, at a later stage, a formal written agreement for the
> purchase from the Plaintiffs of the Farm-Out Rights upon, inter alia, the
> aforesaid terms.
>
> [Emphasis added]

11 According to the first plaintiff, following the said first oral agreement,
parties entered into a series of agreements, one oral and the rest written.
From particulars provided, the following chronology appears to emerge:

_**

Chronology

**_ 27 November 1994: | (1) **The first alleged oral agreement** between the defendant and the first plaintiff (for and on behalf of UPG Group) under which: \- the defendant reportedly promised to provide the entire financing of the project and in return the first plaintiff promised 49% concession rights to the defendant.  
---|---  
27 November 1994: | (2) First Loan Agreement between the defendant, UPG Group and the first plaintiff.  
24 December 1994: : |  Second Loan Agreement between the defendant, UPG Group and the plaintiff.  
25 February 1995: | Confidentiality Agreement between the defendant and one Canadian Occidential Petroleum Ltd (COPL).  
17 March 1995: | 3rd Loan Agreement between the defendant, UPG Group and the first plaintiff.  
30 April 1995: | Fourth Loan Agreement between the defendant, UPG Group and the first plaintiff.  
31 May 1995: | **Master Agreement** between the first plaintiff together with UPG Group, COPL and the defendant (unsigned).  
1 June 1995: | **The second alleged oral agreement** between the defendant and the first plaintiff under which \- the defendant reportedly again promised to procure the entire financing for the impending project from a third party ie, Prince Jefri of Brunei and in return, the first plaintiff promised (a) not to sign the Master Agreement; and  
(b) to give the defendant 100% concession rights.  
  
12 Digressing a little for the time being from the alleged oral agreements -
which are in any event being denied by the defendant - the court’s attention
was drawn by counsel for the contestants to the four written loan agreements
entered into between the parties. It would appear from these agreements that
they were in relation to the provision of interim working capital for the UPG
Group. Under these four agreements, the defendant undertook to provide interim
working capital to the UPG Group in the form of loans. Altogether four loans
were admittedly provided: US$6 million under the first loan agreement; US$9
million (in two tranches of US$4 million and US$5 million respectively) under
the second loan agreement; US$4 million under the third loan agreement; and
US$7.5 million under the fourth loan agreement. The total sum of the loans
granted was US$26.5 million and the loan undertakings by the defendant had
apparently been fulfilled by the defendant before the alleged second oral
agreement.

13 Counsel for the defendant invited the court’s attention to a significant
feature in those four written loan agreements entered into between the
defendant of the first part, the UPG Group (the second to fifth plaintiffs in
these proceedings) of the second part, collectively described as the borrowers
and the first plaintiff as being the guarantor for the said loans of the third
part. The said agreements included a dispute resolution provision. Clause 14
of each agreement provided that the ‘ _agreement[s] entered into between the
parties shall be governed and construed in all respects in accordance with the
laws of Malaysia and the parties hereto shall submit to the jurisdiction of
the courts of the States of Malaysia in all matters connected with the
obligation and liabilities of the parties_.’ [Emphasis added].

14 Then came this Master Agreement dated 31 May 1995. The proposed parties to
this agreement were the defendant, the Canadian Occidential Petroleum Ltd and
the first plaintiff along with his UPG Group of Companies. In brief, the
purport of this proposed Master Agreement was to bring in the said Canadian
Occidential Petroleum Ltd as a joint venture partner in the contemplated
petroleum project. Admittedly, this agreement had not been fully executed by
the parties. The reason, according to the first plaintiff, was that the
defendant persuaded him not to sign the agreement in consideration of the
terms of the second oral agreement.

15 The court was informed by the plaintiffs’ counsel that the significance of
this yet to be executed Master Agreement lay in the clause relating to
arbitration proceedings. In this regard, the relevant part of Article XXI
reads as follows:

> 21.01 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
> Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be
> settled by arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as
> at present in force. The number of arbitrators shall be three. The place of
> arbitration shall be Singapore. The arbitration shall be administered by The
> Singapore International Arbitration Centre (‘SIAC’) and the appointing
> authority shall be the Chairman of SIAC. The language to be used in the
> arbitral proceedings shall be English.

16 No doubt, this Master Agreement contained another article: Article XXII
(22.02) which provided that the said agreement would constitute the entire
agreement between the parties and would supersede all previous agreements. But
the admitted fact was that this agreement had not been fully executed.

17 Next came the alleged second oral agreement. In this regard, it would be
necessary to reproduce paras 25 to 33 of the plaintiffs’ statement of claim
which set out the background to the alleged second oral agreement.

> 25\. From on or about early March 1995 onwards, the Defendant told the 1st
> Plaintiff that he wanted a tri-partite agreement to be executed (hereinafter
> referred to as the "Master Agreement") so as to include COPL as a party to
> the agreement for the purchase of the Farm-Out Rights. The Defendant
> eventually proposed that COPL and the Defendant be granted a larger share in
> the Petroleum Operations in that COPL be granted a thirty-five per cent
> (35%) share of the Petroleum Operations, the Defendant be granted a thirty-
> five per cent (35%) share of the Petroleum Operations and the Plaintiffs be
> granted a thirty per cent (30%) share of the Petroleum Operations. It was
> further proposed by the Defendant that he would purchase a beneficial
> interest in two-thirds of the Plaintiffs’ share of thirty per cent (30%) of
> the Petroleum Operations, leaving the Plaintiffs with effectively a ten per
> cent (10%) interest in the Petroleum Operations.
>
> 26\. Given the fact that the Plaintiffs were absolutely reliant on the
> Defendant to provide technical assistance and the entire financing for the
> Petroleum Operations, the 1st Plaintiff had no choice but to accept the
> Defendant’s proposal as set out in the paragraph above.
>
> 27\. The Master Agreement was to have been executed by, inter alia, the
> Plaintiffs, the Defendant and COPL on or before the 7th day of June 1995.
>
> 28\. The Defendant and COPL signed the Master Agreement on the 31st day of
> May 1995.
>
> 29\. Subsequently, however, the Defendant, instructed the Plaintiffs on the
> 31st day of May 1995 not to execute the Master Agreement as he did not want
> COPL as a partner in the Petroleum Operations and instead had arranged for
> financing from His Royal Highness Pengiran DiGadong, Prince Jefri Bolkiah of
> Negara Brunei Darussalam (hereinafter referred to as "Prince Jefri") for the
> entire Petroleum Operations.
>
> 30\. Pursuant to the Defendant’s instructions as set out in the paragraph
> above, the Plaintiffs did not sign the Master Agreement.
>
> 31\. On or about the 1st day of June 1995, the Defendant met the 1st
> Plaintiff in Jakarta, Indonesia. In light of the Defendant’s aforesaid
> instructions to the Plaintiffs, the 1st Plaintiff and the Defendant entered
> into a second oral agreement ("hereinafter referred to as the "Second Oral
> Agreement"), the salient terms of which are as follows:

> (a) In consideration of the Plaintiffs refraining from executing the Master
> Agreement until the 7th day of June 1995, the Defendant would ensure that
> the Petroleum Operations were entirely financed by Prince Jefri;  
>  (b) The funds to be obtained from Prince Jefri would be sent to the
> Defendant personally to be paid to the Plaintiffs;  
>  (c) In consideration of the Defendant obtaining from Prince Jefri the
> estimated entire working capital for the Petroleum Operations, the Defendant
> would obtain one hundred per cent (100%) interest in the Petroleum
> Operations and the Defendant would give to the Plaintiffs a ten per cent
> (10%) beneficial interest in the same;  
>  (d) Due to the escalating expenditure requirements of the Petroleum
> Operations, the Defendant would make arrangements for the immediate payment
> of the sum of US$2 million as further interim working capital.

> 32\. Notwithstanding the fact that the Defendant had received from Prince
> Jefri the sum of US$45 million, the Defendant failed, refused and/or
> neglected to disburse the said sum or any part thereof to the Plaintiffs.

> 33\. Despite repeated requests from the 1st Plaintiff to the Defendant to:

> > (a) expeditiously arrange for the entire financing of the Petroleum
> Operations; and  
>  (b) enter into a formal written agreement with the Plaintiffs for the
> purchase of the Farm-Out Rights,

> the Defendant failed, refused and/or neglected to do the same.

18 As could be gathered from the foregoing averments, the alleged second oral
agreement sprang from the instructions the first plaintiff reportedly received
from the defendant on 31 May 1995 when the former was in Singapore. According
to the first plaintiff, the said instructions to him on that day were conveyed
to him by one Md Salleh bin Sadijo, a representative of the defendant.

19 It must be presently mentioned that the plaintiffs’ action was solely and
exclusively based on the alleged breaches of the said two oral agreements and
nothing else. It must also be stated at this juncture that the plaintiffs
caused the writ of summons herein to be issued against the defendant on 24
February 2001 and thereafter on 12 March 2001, they also caused to be issued a
similar writ in Malaysia against the defendant in relation to the same claim.

_**

  
Application for stay of proceedings

**_

20 In the context of the foregoing factual scenario, the stay of proceedings
application was being prosecuted and contested.

21 In his affidavit, the defendant denied the two oral agreements ascribed to
him. Having denied the existence of the said oral agreements, he averred that
Singapore could not be the appropriate forum to deal with the plaintiffs’
claim since all the major connecting factors to the subject matter of the
plaintiffs’ claim would point to Malaysia or even Indonesia as being the most
appropriate forum for the hearing of the plaintiffs’ claims.

22 A table setting out the connecting factors to the purported jurisdictions
as prepared and produced on behalf of the defendant, is reproduced below:

**

Table of Connecting Factors

**

**Malaysia** | **Indonesia** | **Singapore**  
---|---|---  
The defendant is a Malaysian, resident in Malaysia. | The Plaintiff is an Indonesian, resident in Indonesia. The Companies involved in the Project are Indonesian Companies. |   
Witnesses in Malaysia: \- Defendant \- Datuk Captain Hamzah | Witnesses in Indonesia: \- The first plaintiff \- Helmy G. Shebubakar \- Dody Nawangsidi Most of the key players in the Petrogas Project are Indonesians.  
The laws of Malaysia govern the Loan Agreements and the parties submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Malaysia. | Petrogas project is an Indonesian Project. The Project is to be performed in Indonesia.  
The defendant’s assets are substantially located in Malaysia. | The Plaintiff’s assets must be located in Indonesia. | The defendant’s HSBC bank current account.  
  
23 As mentioned earlier, the defendant did not succeed before the learned
assistant registrar. In the appeal before me, counsel for the defendant argued
that the connecting factors set out in the table referred to, would not, in
logic and in law, make Singapore the appropriate forum. He emphasised that
except for the fact that the defendant operated a current bank account in
Singapore which was used to disburse the loans mentioned in the four loan
agreements, the rest of the factors most certainly favoured the conclusion
that either Malaysia or Indonesia would be the most appropriate forum for the
disputed issues to be tried and determined. Counsel for the defendant
underscored the following aspects: (a) the defendant is resident in Malaysia;
(b) the plaintiffs had commenced identical proceedings in Malaysia; (c) apart
from the defendant, seven witnesses namely Datuk Captain Hamzah, Mrs Halimah,
Mrs Tan, Datuk Raman, Yip Wai Ming, Datuk Ungku Captain Faisal and Salleh
Sadijo, all of whom would be likely to testify in these proceedings, are
Malaysian residents; (d) the first plaintiff is an Indonesian resident; (e)
the second, third, fourth and fifth plaintiffs are Indonesian entities; (f)
there are three witnesses namely Praptono, the first plaintiff, Helmy
Shebubakar and Dody Nawangsidi are all resident in Indonesia; (g) the
petroleum project envisaged was to be preferred in Indonesia; and (h) most of
the key figures in the petroleum project are all Indonesians.

24\. As to the argument by plaintiffs’ counsel that the defendant being the
Crown Prince of Johor would in future be entitled to ascend the throne of
Johor and in such an event the plaintiffs would be disadvantaged under the
existing Malaysian laws in that he would be granted Ruler’s immunity from
suits by non-Malaysians (see: _**Faridah Begum bte Abdullah v Sultan Haji
Ahmad Shah**_ (1996) 1 MLJ 617), counsel for the defendant submitted that this
was a long shot and the prospect sketched out had not materialised. Counsel
for the defendant further urged the court to bear in mind the feature that the
defendant had at all times been willing to defend the proceedings in Malaysia.

25 The plaintiffs’ counsel’s submission was best stated in his own words. The
key segments of his written submissions, insofar as they are material, are as
follows:

> 11\. The Master Agreement that was prepared for execution by COPL, the
> Plaintiffs and the Defendant clearly indicated the intention of the
> Defendant as to the chosen forum for the adjudication of disputes, being
> Singapore. The Defendant had indeed signed this Master Agreement.
>
> …
>
> 12\. The Defendant has failed to show any or substantial connecting factors
> to an alternative jurisdiction other than Singapore. The key witness [Datuk
> Captain Hamzah] has deposed to the fact that he is ready able and willing to
> give evidence in Singapore. This witness will be able to give testimony to
> the existence of the respective oral agreements and the Defendants
> subsequent breaches. For the avoidance of doubt, it is clear that there are
> three pivotal figures who will feature in the Plaintiffs’ claims and they
> are the 1st Plaintiff, the Defendant and Datuk Hamzah.
>
> …
>
> 14\. The provision of interim working capital for the project (which was
> disbursed to the Plaintiffs pursuant to the terms of the first oral
> agreement) was done via the Defendant’s bank account in Singapore.
>
> …
>
> 15\. The parties have shown that the Singapore Jurisdiction was the
> Jurisdiction of choice. As mentioned above, the Master Agreement is
> conclusive of this. The Defendant himself chose Singapore to negotiate the
> terms of the respective agreements, evidencing the fact that he frequents
> the jurisdiction regularly and in this regard the argument of residence of
> witnesses would not hold water. The main parties are that of the 1st
> Plaintiff, the Defendant and Datuk Hamzah.
>
> …
>
> 18\. The Defendant is the crown prince of Johor. He would in future be
> entitled to ascend the throne of Johor. In this regard the Plaintiffs would
> be disadvantaged as the Defendant would enjoy immunity from claims of non-

>
> _****_

  
Conclusion

26 The principles of law which are to be borne in mind as regards applications
for stay of proceedings on grounds of _forum non conveniens_ are set out by
Lord Goff of Chiveley in _**The Spiliada**_ [1987] AC 460. These are well re-
stated in the Third Cumulative Supplement to Dicey & Morris on Conflict of
Laws (11th Edn) at paras 393-395 as follows:

> (a) the basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of
> forum non conveniens where the court is satisfied that there is some other
> available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate
> forum for the trial of the action, ie in which the case may be tried more
> suitably for the interest of all the parties and the ends of justice;
>
> (b) the legal burden of proof is on the defendant, but the evidential burden
> will rest on the party who asserts the existence of a relevant factor;
>
> (c) the burden is on the defendant to show both that England is not the
> natural or appropriate forum, and also that there is another available forum
> which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the English forum;

> (d) the court will look to see what factors there are which point to the
> direction of another forum, as being the forum which the action has the most
> real and substantial connection, eg factors affecting convenience or expense
> (such as availability of witnesses), the law governing the transaction, and
> the places where the parties reside or carry on business;

> (e) if at that stage the court concludes that there is no other available
> forum which is clearly more appropriate, it will ordinarily refuse a stay;
>
> (f) if there is another forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate
> the court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by
> reason of which justice requires that a stay should not be granted, and, in
> this inquiry the court will consider all the circumstances of the case. But
> the mere fact that the plaintiff has a legitimate, personal or juridical
> advantage in proceeding in England is not decisive; regard must be had to
> the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.

27 In Singapore, both at the first instance and at the appellate level, the
courts have consistently applied the foregoing principles (see _**The Vishva
Apurva**_ [1992] 2 SLR 175; _**Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp & Anor v PT
Airfast Services Indonesia and another**_ [1992] 2 SLR 776, _**Oriental
Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd**_ [1998] 1 SLR 253 and _**Datuk
Hamzah bin Mohd Noor v Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni Sultan Iskandar A-Haj**_
[2001] 4 SLR 396).

28 What is clear from the abovementioned cases is that in exercising its
discretion, the court should take into account all the circumstances of the
case and in particular, the country where the evidence is most readily
available or in other words the location of the witnesses who would testify to
the facts; the place where the underlying transaction and the cause of action
arose; the residence of the contestants and the law governing the dispute.
Above all, all the reported cases enjoin the courts to balance the competing
justice between the parties. In this context, I would like to add a little
allonge, that is, if the balance were to remain at the mid-point and tilts to
neither side, the action must generally follow the defendant.

29 In the appeal before me, the undisputed features are: (a) the parties to
the action are not resident in Singapore: the plaintiffs are resident in
Indonesia whereas the defendant is resident in Malaysia; (b) the petroleum
project for which the parties had apparently entered into the said four loan
agreements, was to be carried out in Indonesia; (c) the key witnesses to the
action are all either in Malaysia or Indonesia; (d) the law governing the
dispute according to the four written loan agreements is that of Malaysia: (e)
and even according to the unexecuted master agreement the applicable law for
any prospective arbitration is English law.

30 Given the foregoing setting, a primary question seemed to arise. Had the
defendant discharged his legal burden in establishing that Singapore was not
the natural or appropriate forum and that there was another available forum
which was clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore? In my view,
he had.

31 The plaintiffs’ action, as could be seen from the pleadings, was founded in
the main, on two alleged oral promises made by the defendant to the first
plaintiff in relation to the petroleum project in Indonesia. The allegation
was that, in consideration of the plaintiffs selling to the defendant a
certain percentage of their concession rights, the defendant agreed to arrange
for the entire financing for the proposed petroleum project. It was said that
the first such oral promise was made on 27 November 1994 - on the occasion of
the defendant’s birthday party at Raffles Marina, Singapore - and the second
oral promise was made on 31 May as well as 1 June 1995. On the second
occasion, the promise was reportedly conveyed to the first plaintiff by the
defendant through an intemediary known as Mohd Salleh Sadijo. This had been
vigorously denied by the defendant. The first plaintiff averred that the
intention of the parties at all times was to subject themselves to the
jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. This assertion was robustly contested by
the defendant and in this counsel for the defendant invited my attention to
the four written loan agreements entered into by the parties upon the subject
matter respectively on 27th November 1994, 24th December 1994, 17th March 1995
and 30th April 1995. In these four agreements, parties had no doubt after
legal advice and with much deliberation, expressly elected to submit
themselves to the jurisdiction of the Malaysian Courts and to the laws of that
country.

32 In reviewing all the evidence including affidavits by Datuk Captain Hamzah,
I found it strange why parties chose to opt for Malaysian laws and the
jurisdiction of Malaysian courts, if their intention had all along been to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction of Singapore courts. In my finding, the
plaintiffs had not, in their endeavours, come anywhere near discharging even
the elementary evidential burden required of them in this regard.

33 The unsigned tri-partite Master Agreement involving the plaintiff and the
defendant and the said Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd, relied on by the
plaintiffs, was at best only in reference to arbitration proceedings and in my
view, had little bearing to litigation in courts. Curiously, even in relation
to the contemplated arbitration proceedings, Article 21 of the unsigned Master
Agreement provided not for the application of the laws of Singapore but for
the application of the substantive laws of England. Although it could well be
argued that the laws of England and Singapore in relation to the field of
contract are similar, the specific reference to the laws of England and not
the laws of Singapore was significant and could not be overlooked. The court
was told that there were three main witnesses to the transaction under
reference: the first plaintiff an Indonesian, the defendant a Malaysian and
Datuk Hamzah also a Malaysian. None of them was reported to be resident in
Singapore. Even the alleged intermediary Salleh Sadijo through whom the
defendant had allegedly conveyed his instructions as regards the second oral
agreement was said to be a Malaysian resident. Although it was claimed that
the plaintiffs’ witnesses would find it convenient to testify in Singapore, in
my view, that alone could not make Singapore the most convenient forum.

34 Another point pressed on by plaintiffs’ counsel was that the defendant
being the Crown Prince of Johor may ascend the throne of Johor any time soon
and as a result would enjoy sovereign immunity from proceedings in Malaysia
(see _**Faridah Begum** _(_supra_)) thus prejudicing the plaintiffs’ prospects
of prosecuting their claim there. In my view, this argument did not avail the
plaintiffs the mileage they hoped to gain since the defendant had not yet
become a ruler and in any event, the fact that the defendant had been
categorically maintaining his intention to accept service and defend the
proceedings already commenced in Malaysia, tended to take the wind out of the
sails of the plaintiffs’ arguments.

35 At this juncture, I must mention one other aspect. In the course of the
arguments, in relation to the immunity issue, I asked counsel: Would not a
Ruler of a Malaysian State be entitled to claim sovereign immunity in
Singapore? I posed this question in view of an old English decision:
_**Mighell v Sultan of Johore**_ [1894] 1 QB 149, where the Court of Appeal in
England had held that the Courts in England had no jurisdiction over an
independent foreign sovereign unless the sovereign submitted himself to
jurisdiction. As was not unexpected, there were differing answers. Counsel for
the plaintiffs argued that immunity no longer existed in the light of
development of law since _**Mighell**_ and the provisions of the State
Immunity Act (Cap 313), 1979. Reference was made to ss 3, 5, 16 and 17 of the
said Act. Counsel for the defendant on the other hand, contended that immunity
still existed in relation to contracts entered into by a Ruler in his private
capacity.

36 Having regard to my findings as to the appropriate forum, I felt that it
was unnecessary for me to delve further into the issue of immunity in
Singapore at this stage. At any rate, I was of the view that the plaintiff
might still be unable to pursue a claim against a Malaysian Ruler if under s
17 of the State Immunity Act, the President of the Republic of Singapore were
to grant him such an immunity.

37 Reviewing all the facts, including the express mention of Malaysian laws
and the preferred option to have all their disputes litigated in the Malaysian
courts as stipulated in the four written loan agreements, I was persuaded to
conclude that the intention of the parties had all along been to subject
themselves to the jurisdiction of the Malaysian courts and not Singapore. In
my view, the defendant had satisfied the court that overall, the oral
agreements bespoken, if at all entered into between the parties, indeed had a
closer connection with Malaysia or Indonesia than with Singapore. Even from
the picture painted by the plaintiffs, by all measures, the gravitational pull
is clearly away from Singapore and the centre of gravity appears to be located
in Malaysia where the defendant and most material witnesses are resident. In
my determination, the defendant had amply satisfied me that Malaysia was the
most appropriate forum and in the premises the defendant’s appeal was allowed
with costs, the stay applied for was granted and the order of the learned
assistant registrar was set aside.
