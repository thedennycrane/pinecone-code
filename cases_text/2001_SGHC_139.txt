**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. This is a case of a venture which started in hope and ended in acrimony.
The plaintiff is a small Singapore company with no significant record or
assets. The defendant which is also incorporated in Singapore, is a wholly
owned subsidiary of a substantial conglomerate, LG International Corporation
("LG Group") of Korea.

2 The two parties had not engaged in business with one another before. They
came together after the defendant rented part of its office premises to a
company Oberthur Card Systems Pte Ltd run by Cheong Chung Chin, whose wife is
a shareholder of the plaintiff company. Cheong represented to the defendant
that someone in the plaintiff company was experienced in the trade of Indian
steel products.

3\. The person in question is Kamalraj Johnson, the plaintiff’s managing
director. He knew of a Venezuelan steel mill Venezolana de Prerreducidos
Caroni CA ("Venprecar") which produces Hot Briquette Iron ("HBI"). Eventually
Johnson and the plaintiff’s general manager Kim Young Jin agreed to co-operate
to purchase HBI from Venprecar and to supply it to Pohang Iron and Steel
Company Co Ltd ("POSCO") of Korea. POSCO is a large steel mill and an
important customer LG Group. LG Group and POSCO have a long trading
relationship and substantial amounts of coal and finished steel products are
transacted between them.

4\. The defendant was looking to expand its business with POSCO to cover HBI.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant were anxious that the transaction with
POSCO succeeded. The defendant informed the plaintiff that the performance of
the agreement was of great commercial importance to it. The plaintiff in turn
informed the defendant that the most important consideration was to secure the
order from POSCO and obtain an opening into Korea for HBI, and that it was
proceeding with the deal although it was not going to make any money from it.

5\. The scheme was that when POSCO confirmed its interest, the plaintiff would
purchase the HBI from Venprecar. The plaintiff would then sell the HBI to the
defendant which would in turn enter into a back-to-back agreement to sell the
HBI on to POSCO.

6\. In these proceedings, we are concerned with the agreement of 17 July 2000
between the plaintiff and the defendant, the agreement of 24 July between the
defendant and POSCO and most crucially an agreement of 12 August which the
plaintiff and the defendant signed to prevent the whole venture from collapse.

7\. The salient terms of the agreement of 17 July are

> > > > > > _

Article :01: Product, Quantity, Price and Packing

> > _

Product : Hot Briquette Iron

…

Quantity : 35,000 metric tonnes max.

…

Price : US$112.00 per MT and freight (free out)

Port Pohang/Kwangyang, South Korea

Contract Value: US$3,920,000.00 (United States Dollars Three Millions Nine
Hundred And Twenty Thousand only)

Shipment : By 15th August 2000

and

> > _
>>

>> Article :20: Penalty/Claims:

>>

>> _

>>

>> In the event of non-delivery, seller is deemed to have defaulted on the
Contract. In that case, the seller will compensate the buyer with an amount
not exceeding 2% of the contract value for which a performance bond will be
issued. If the shipment is not effected by 15th August 2000 the seller agrees
to pay a penalty to the extent of 0.25% of the invoice value per day of delay
from 16th August 2000 subject to a maximum of 5% of the invoice value.

8\. In the agreement with POSCO, the defendant sold the same HBI to POSCO at
US$114 per metric ton. The goods were to be shipped in the first half of
August. Clause 4.1 of the General Provisions of the agreement provided that
the defendant was to furnish POSCO with the particulars of the vessel at least
7 days before the scheduled time of shipment.

9\. I shall refer to the terms of the agreement of 12 August and the
circumstances in which it was executed later.

10\. Before these agreements were signed, the parties had discussions on the
project, and the cost of shipment and chartering of vessels were discussed
early and regularly.

11\. On 20 June, when sale to another Korean company was being considered, the
plaintiff informed the defendant that there were offers of US$18 per metric
ton. In subsequent communications Johnson regularly updated Kim on the
securing a vessel. On 12 July he informed the defendant that "vessel
particulars are available with me which we propose to confirm in a day or
two", naming the vessel Felicity I. On 17 July he informed Kim that he had
decided to go for a vessel of less than 20 years and will finalise the details
of the vessel (the Felicity I was older than 20 years).

12\. After the execution of the agreement of 17 July Johnson assured Kim on 18
July that he was confident to have the vessel within 2 days and on 20 July he
promised to supply the defendant with the particulars of the vessel.

13\. Johnson had in fact not secured any vessel and had been less than candid
when he made those assurances. He was not conversant in chartering vessels. He
relied on shipbrokers he had not used before, but did not instruct them to
take firm steps to get a commitment on any vessel. On 21 July he admitted that
he had made no progress on a newer vessel, and was turning his attention back
to the Felicity I, but by 26 July the Felicity I was still not secured.

14\. On his own evidence serious questions arose over Johnson’s competence in
handling the matters. However the evidence fell short of bad faith, and in any
event, bad faith did not form any part of the defendant’s pleaded case.

15\. As time went on, the defendant became anxious over its ability to fulfill
its obligation to POSCO to confirm a vessel at least 7 days before the
scheduled shipment in the first half of August.

16\. By 28 July Kim suspected that the plaintiff was not able to secure a
vessel at US$18 a metric ton, and informed Johnson the defendant was not in a
position to terminate the transaction because LG Group had a lot of other
business with POSCO, "(w)e have mind to share freight with you."

17\. On the following day at a meeting between Kim, Mr Huh Yeon Soo the
defendant’s managing director and Cheong, Kim told Cheong that "the defendant
was willing to assist and was even willing to consider sharing in the cost of
increased freight."

18\. No progress was made despite the offer. By 3 August, Johnson was still
trying in vain to secure a vessel and the defendant despaired at losing
credibility with POSCO and at not being allowed to participate in future
tenders.

19\. By 8 August when the time to nominate a vessel to POSCO was running out,
the plaintiff had still not secured a vessel. The parties met twice on that
day to find a solution. The first meeting at the plaintiff’s office in the
afternoon ended in acrimony without result.

20\. A second meeting took place at the plaintiff’s office that night. Kim
recounted the events of that meeting in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief -

> > > > 85\. The meeting lasted between 3 to 4 hours. I recall that it was
> past midnight when an agreement was finally reached. At the meeting, Cheong
> and Johnson informed us that the Plaintiff had finally managed to locate a
> vessel for charter but that the cost of freight was US$27.50 per MT. This
> represented a substantial increase of US$9.50 per MT from the original cost
> of US$18.00 per MT.
>>>>

>>>> 86\. We were then told by Cheong and Johnson that, unless the Defendant
agreed to compensate the Plaintiff by sharing the increased cost of freight,
the Plaintiff would refuse to confirm the charter of the vessel. They stated
clearly that the Plaintiff was ready to default on its obligations under the
Agreement.

>>>>

>>>> 87\. Mr Cheong and Johnson both stated explicitly that they were willing
for us to penalise them under the Performance Bond. This was despite us
informing them repeatedly that we could not, in light of our existing
relationship with POSCO, breach our obligations to POSCO.

>>>>

>>>> …

>>>>

>>>> 89\. In addition, Cheong and Johnson unreasonably insisted that the
Defendant’s share of the increased freight cost should be US$5.50 per MT. This
meant that the Plaintiff would only have to bear US$4.00 per MT
notwithstanding the fact that the present difficulties were purely of the
Plaintiff’s own making.

>>>>

>>>> …

>>>>

>>>> 93\. It gradually became clear that the only way the Defendant could
ensure the Plaintiff’s performance of the Agreement was to agree to the
Plaintiff’s demands for compensation, however unreasonable. There was simply
no reasonable alternative open to the Defendant. Given that loading had to be
completed by the 1st half of August 2000 (i.e. by 15 August 2000), there was
not enough time for the Defendant to secure an alternative vessel. There was
also not enough time for the Defendant to seek alternative suppliers of the
HBI given the relative scarcity of HBI in the open market and the fact that
the Defendant was new to the trade in HBI.

>>>>

>>>> 94\. Further, any failure on the part of the Defendant to perform its
obligations under the POSCO consequences _(sic)_ would have serious commercial
consequences. It would also have affected the Defendant’s reputation and
standing with its parent company in South Korea, LG Corp. I verily believe
that Cheong and Johnson were well aware of the pressure faced by the Defendant
to successfully perform the POSCO Agreement and that they used this to their
advantage by demanding for compensation from the Defendant.

>>>>

>>>> …

>>>>

>>>> 98\. It was only after Mr Huh had agreed to the Plaintiff’s demands that
steps were taken by Johnson to confirm the vessel. …

21\. A little more of the meeting came out during the cross-examination of
Johnson when he was referred to Kim’s affidavit

> > Q: Para 86 – did you and Cheong inform the Defendants that?
>>

>>> > A: Yes. It was the Defendants from 28/7 advising us that they had the
mind to share the freight. They are a big company and _the Plaintiffs cannot
absorb the gap. I cannot bear the $27.50 alone._ I wanted to fix the Felicity.

>>>>

>>>> Q: You said you intended to honour your obligations regardless the amount
of freight?

>>>>

>>>> A: I have to consider how much the Plaintiffs can pay. $21 is my limit.

>>>>

>>>> Q: Para 86 – last sentence – you told them that?

>>>>

>>>> A: No, we told them if I don’t perform they can encash the performance
bond.

>>

>> … …

>>

>>> > Q: Para 89 – you insisted Defendants have to pay $5.50?

>>>>

>>>> A: It was decided together.

>>>>

>>>> Q: Who suggested the figure of $5.50?

>>>>

>>>> A: The Plaintiffs.

>>>>

>>>> … …

>>>>

>>>> Q: If they wanted to fix the vessel at any cost why did not you tell them
to bear the costs?

>>>>

>>>> A: _I told them I will bear the costs according to my abilities_.

>>>>

>>>> (Emphasis added)

22\. The parties recorded the terms in an agreement they signed on 12 August
that

> > As agreed upon on 09th August 2000 in the presence of Mr Huh Managing
> Director of LG International and Mr Cheong Chung Chin President, Oberthur
> Card Systems that LG International will pay the following:
>>

>> To enhance the LC value by US$2.00 per MT C&F Free Out;

>>

>> To pay an amount of US$3.50 per MT for a total loaded quantity up to 35000
MTs with a maximum loaded quantity of 35000 MTs;

>>

>> In case, the LC is not enhanced by US$2.00 then the compensation amount
will be increased to US$5.50 per MT;

>>

>> The payment is to be effected in two parts:

>>

>>> > 1) 25% of the payment at the rate of US$5.50 per MT will be paid
immediately on signing of the CP;

>>>>

>>>> 2) 75% of the payment at the rate of US$5.50 per MT will be paid on
completion of the loading;

>>>>

>>>> 3) The difference in the despatch by US$1000 will be paid by SG.

>>

>> The total amount to be paid is on the total agreed maximum quantity of
35000 MTs.

23\. After the agreement was reached, a vessel, the Drake, was chartered and
the HBI was delivered to POSCO. The defendant made the first 25% payment of
US$48,125 to the plaintiff but refused to pay the second 75% payment. Instead
it demanded for, then commenced proceedings to recover the payment made.

24\. The plaintiff responded by instituting these proceedings for the
outstanding US$144,375. Subsequently the defendant’s claim was incorporated
into the proceedings as a counterclaim.

25\. The plaintiff based its claim on two undisputed facts, firstly that the
parties had entered into the agreement of 12 August and secondly that the
defendant had not made the second payment when it became due.

26\. The defendant had the more difficult case to assert that the agreement
was not enforceable and that the payment made should be refunded. It raised
two lines of defence.

27\. The first ground of defence was economic duress. In para 8 of the defence
it was pleaded that

> > The Defendant avers that the Plaintiff was contractually bound to bear the
> cost of freight pursuant to the express terms of the Agreement (of 17 July).
> As such, the Defendant avers that the matters pleaded hereinabove at
> paragraph 7 amounted to wrongful and/or illegitimate threats by the
> Plaintiff to breach the terms of the Agreement.

28\. Paragraph 7 of the defence alleged that –

> > On or around 8 August 2000, the Plaintiff orally informed the Defendant
> that it had significantly underestimated the cost of freight and that it
> would not perform its delivery obligations under the Agreement if the loss
> arising from the higher cost of freight was not shared by the Defendant.
>>

>> _

>>

>> Particulars

>>

>>> > _

>>

>> i. On or around 8 August 2000, a meeting was held at the Plaintiff’s
offices and attended by Johnson Kamalraj (a director of the Plaintiff) and
Cheong on behalf of the Plaintiff and Kim Young Jin (the Defendant’s General
Manager) and Y S Huh (the Defendant’s Managing Director) on behalf of the
Defendant.

>>

>> ii. At the said meeting, Johnson orally informed the Defendant’s
representatives that the cost of freight was significantly higher than the
Plaintiff had estimated.

>>

>> iii. As such, Johnson expressly informed the Defendant’s representatives
that the Plaintiff would not be able to procure the charter of a vessel unless
the Defendant agreed to compensate the Plaintiff for the increased cost of
freight.

>>

>> iv. At no time prior to the meeting on 8 August 2000 had the Plaintiff
informed the Defendant that it had miscalculated the cost of freight and that
it was not intending and/or would not be able to perform its contractual
obligations under the Agreement unless the Defendant agreed to share the
increased cost of freight.

>>

>> v. The Defendant further avers that the Plaintiff, through Johnson, had
repeatedly assured the Defendant on a number of occasions prior to the said
meeting on 8 August 2000 that the Plaintiff was arranging for the charter of a
vessel.

29\. The second defence pleaded is that the agreement is not supported by
consideration. The defendant pleaded in para 12 of the defence that

> > Further and/or in the alternative, the Defendant avers that no
> consideration was given by the Plaintiff to support the Compensation
> Agreement and to render the Compensation Agreement an agreement binding in
> law as the Plaintiff’s obligations under the Compensation Agreement was to
> do no more than it was already contractually obliged to do under the
> contract. In the further alternative, the Defendant avers that even if
> consideration was given by the Plaintiff (which is denied), such
> consideration was past consideration and was not sufficient in law to
> support the Compensation Agreement and to render the Compensation Agreement
> an agreement binding in law.

30\. Economic duress as a ground for avoiding contractual obligations is in
its formative stage of development. The acts that constitute economic duress
and the effect they must have on the receiving party have not been defined
with certainty or finality.

31\. A threat to break a contract, e.g. a refusal to supply goods sold under a
contract, may be economic duress. In a useful discussion on this area of the
law, _Chitty’s on Contracts_ (28th Edn) states at paras 7-023 and 7-024 that

> > **
>>

>> Threat to commit an unlawful act

>>

>> **. As already indicated, it is clear that not all threats can be regarded
as improper or illegitimate, and it is necessary in the law of duress to
distinguish between legitimate and other forms of pressure or threats. Prima
facie it is thought to be clear that a threat to commit an unlawful act will
constitute an improper threat for the purposes of the law of duress. Certainly
a threat to commit a crime or a tort as a means of inducing the coerced party
to enter into some contract must prima facie be improper. **

>>

>> Threat to break a contract

>>

>> **. It is now recognised that in cases of economic duress, the question is
not whether the victim’s will is overborne but whether the other party had
used illegitimate pressure, the practical effect of which is that the victim
had no choice. It does not seem, however, that the victim will necessarily be
entitled to relief because his decision was influenced by a threatened breach
of contract and was the only way to avoid the threatened action. The decisions
in _Occidental Worldwide Investment Corpn v. Skibs A/S Avanti_ [1976] 1
Lloyd’s Rep. 293 and _Pao On v. Lau Liu Long_ [1980] A.C. 614 suggest that
something more than this is required. In _B. & S. Contracts & Design Ltd v.
Victor Green Publications Ltd_ [1984] I.C.R. 419 the Court of Appeal stressed
that it is not "on every occasion when one party unwillingly agrees to a
variation of a contract, that the law would consider that he had acted by
reason of duress." There are at least two types of situation in which it would
seem inappropriate to treat a threat to break a contract as amounting to
unlawful pressure or duress. First, there are circumstances in which the party
claiming relief was not in fact coerced by the threat. Here the claim will
fail on causal grounds. Secondly, the cases just cited suggest that claim of
economic duress may fail even though the threat and pressure clearly had some
influence. If it is correct (as submitted earlier) that the decisions should
not be explained on the ground that the threat must have been the overwhelming
cause of the victim’s agreement, they suggest that not every threatened breach
of contract, even if it has had some "significant effect", will amount to
duress. A possible explanation is that some threats of breach of contract may
be regarded as not illegitimate. … There are a number of ways in which this
result could be explained.

32\. _Chitty_ concluded at para 7-029 that

> > It is … difficult to state with confidence whether a threat of a breach of
> contract will ever be regarded as legitimate and, if so, in what
> circumstances. It is submitted that deliberate exploitation of the victim’s
> position with a view to gaining some advantage unrelated to the contract and
> to which the threatening party knows he is not entitled is clearly
> illegitimate. Conversely, an apparent threat should not be treated as
> illegitimate if it was really no more than a true statement that, unless the
> demand is met, the party making it will be unable to perform; nor if the
> party has a genuine belief that he is legally entitled to the amount
> demanded. It is suggested that a demand made in good faith, in the sense
> that the party demanding has a genuine belief in the moral strength of his
> claim – for example, because he has encountered serious and unexpected
> difficulties in performing and will suffer considerable hardship if his
> demand is not met; or to correct an acknowledged imbalance in the existing
> contract -–might in some circumstances also be treated as legitimate. Here
> the behaviour of the victim, for example whether he protests, will be
> relevant. First, it will go to causation: if the victim pays without
> protest, that may be evidence that he was not influenced by the threat. But
> secondly, payment without protest may leave the demanding party believing
> that the justice of his demand is admitted, whereas it will be harder for
> him to prove that he was acting in good faith if he ignores the victim’s
> protests.

33\. In my view, it is necessary to consider all the circumstances, including
the states of mind of the parties before coming to a conclusion on whether a
case for avoidance on the ground of economic duress is made out.

34\. In the present case, the spirit of the venture must be taken into
account. From the start, both parties intended to co-operate to gain entry
into the HBI business. The co-operative nature of the venture is reflected in
the consultations over the chartering of the vessel and Johnson and Kim’s trip
together to Venezuela to supervise the loading of the HBI. The defendant’s
willingness to contribute towards the additional freight costs prior to 8
August was another reflection of this.

35\. The second relevant factor is the cause for the plaintiff’s demand that
the defendant shared the additional costs. The plaintiff through its
inexperience, misjudged the freight costs badly. As Johnson had testified, the
plaintiff was unable to bear the additional costs alone, and if the defendant
did not come to its assistance, it was prepared to forfeit the performance
bond. Counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that the plaintiff bore a greater
burden under the agreement of 12 August by paying its share of the additional
freight than it would have under the performance bond.

36\. On the evidence before me, there was little to contradict Johnson’s
evidence. In the course of the trial, it came out that the plaintiff had to
borrow from Cheong or his wife and another party by the name of Sekhar to meet
its share of the freight.

37\. Against this background it cannot be said that the plaintiff was seeking
to exploit the situation to increase its profits when it informed the
defendant that it would not charter the vessel unless the defendant agreed to
share the additional costs.

38\. This then brings us back to the issue whether a party which truthfully
states that it cannot perform without extra payment is making an illegitimate
threat. As _Chitty_ noted, it is not easy to demarcate between a legitimate
notice and an illegitimate threat.

39\. In this case, two matters stood out for consideration. First, the
plaintiff was not seeking to improve its financial position by seeking the
contribution instead of forfeiting the performance bond. Second, the plaintiff
was not seeking to shift the burden of the additional costs entirely to the
defendant, and had agreed to bear a share of it even when it did not have the
funds for that purpose.

40\. The matter should also be considered from the defendant’s standpoint. For
the defendant, this inaugural HBI deal with POSCO was important as it would
add another commodity to the trade between LG and POSCO, and enhance the
goodwill and relationship between the two companies.

41\. When the deal ran into difficulties, the defendant could not abandon it
because as Kim explained, "any failure on the part of the Defendant to perform
its obligations under the POSCO (contract) would have serious commercial
consequences. It would also have affected the Defendant’s reputation and
standing with its parent company in South Korea." (The defendant referred to
the commercial consequences in its defence, but not to the potential effect on
its reputation and standing with its parent company. It also did not inform
the plaintiff of the latter on the night of 8 August – see para 87 of Kim’s
affidavit.)

42\. Without elucidation from the defendant, I do not understand what the
serious commercial consequences alluded to were. Questions which should be
addressed were not. Was the defendant concerned over its ability to meet
POSCO’s claim for damages for non-performance? Was it concerned with the loss
of its credibility with POSCO? How severely would the relationship with POSCO
be damaged? How strong were those concerns, and how much did they influence
the defendant’s decision to agree to contribute to the additional freight
costs?

43\. When a defence of economic duress is raised, it is incumbent on the party
raising it to show that the duress placed it in a position where it was
compelled to accede to the other party’s demands.

44\. I accept that the defendant was concerned over the prospect of breaking
the contract with POSCO. However, it did not say that it could not bear the
financial repercussions of non-performance, or the nature of the damage non-
performance would inflict on the relationship with POSCO. There was something
else that the defendant should explain. It was prepared to contribute towards
the additional freight costs even before the meeting of 8 August. As it was
already contemplating making a contribution towards the increased cost before
the threat, the question arose whether the eventual agreement was the result
of commercial negotiation e.g. how the additional costs were to be
apportioned, or the result of a capitulation to the plaintiff’s threat.

45\. After considering the evidence, I came to the conclusion that the
plaintiff’s declaration that it would not perform unless the defendant shared
the additional freight should be regarded as a legitimate notice of its
inability to perform rather than an illegitimate threat. On the part of the
defendant, I did not have a clear picture that it had no alternative but to
accept the plaintiff’s terms because it had to fulfill its obligations to
POSCO under any circumstances.

46\. That left the consideration defence to be dealt with. In the closing
submissions, the same assertions in para 12 of the defence were repeated
without explanation or amplification.

47\. There is not a lot in this defence. This area of the law has been
clarified in _Williams v Roffey Bros and Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd_[1990] 1
All ER 512\. The facts are broadly similar to the facts in the present case.
The plaintiff entered into a sub-contract with the defendant, who were the
main contractors, to carry out some work in the refurbishment of some flats.
After completing a portion of the works the plaintiff went into financial
difficulties because he had quoted too low a price. The defendant needed the
work to be completed on time to avoid liability under the main contract. The
parties agreed that the defendant would make additional payments to the
plaintiff if he completed the sub-contracted work on time. The plaintiff
carried out his end of the bargain, but the defendant refused to make the
promised payments on the ground that the agreement was not supported by any
consideration.

48\. The plaintiff sued for the outstanding payments and succeeded at the
trial. When the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal Glidewell LJ stated
at pages 520-1

> > (F)ollowing the view of the majority in _Ward v Byham_ [1956] 2 All ER 318
> and of the whole court in _Williams v Williams_ [1957] 1 All ER 305 and that
> of the Privy Council in _Pao On v Lau Yiu_ [1979] 3 All ER 65 the present
> state of the law on this subject can be expressed in the following
> proposition: (i) if A has entered into a contract with B to do work for, or
> to supply goods or services to, B in return for payment by B and (ii) at
> some stage before A has completely performed his obligations under the
> contract B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete
> his side of the bargain and (iii) B thereupon promises A an additional
> payment in return for A’s promise to perform his contractual obligations on
> time and (iv) as a result of giving his promise B obtains in practice a
> benefit, or obviates a disbenefit, and (v) B’s promise is not given as a
> result of economic duress or fraud on the part of A, then (vi) the benefit
> to B is capable of being consideration for B’s promise, so that the promise
> will be legally binding.

As there was no finding or suggestion that the promise was given as a result
of fraud or duress, the appeal was dismissed.

49\. Just as the defendant in _Williams v._ _Roffey_ had the sub-contracted
work completed in time, the HBI was delivered in time to POSCO and the
negative commercial consequences were avoided. The defendant did not allege
fraud, and failed to prove duress. The second line of defence thus failed.

50\. I therefore gave judgment to the plaintiff on the claim and dismissed the
defendant’s counterclaim. However, as the difficulties the parties encountered
arose from the plaintiff’s inaptitude in making a proper provision for the
freight costs and in securing a vessel, I awarded the plaintiff half the costs
of the actions.
