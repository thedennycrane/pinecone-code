Judith Prakash J:

1 The vessel _MV Pontianak Caraka Jaya Niago III-34_ (“the Vessel”) was
arrested by the plaintiff in this action, ANL Singapore Pte Ltd, in June 2009
to answer a claim for unpaid slot charter-hire. Just prior to commencing this
action, the same plaintiff commenced Admiralty in Rem 175 of 2009 (“Adm 175”)
against the vessel _MV Makassar Caraka Jaya Niaga III-39_ (“ _MV Makassar_ ”),
a sister ship, to enforce recovery of a similar claim in respect of the _MV
Makassar_. The _MV Makassar_ was also arrested by the plaintiff.

2 This action and Adm 175 thereafter took a similar course. In September 2009,
PT Djakarta Lloyd (Persero) (“DJL”) intervened in both actions and thereafter
applied to have the arrests set aside. These applications were heard together
as the same issues were involved and were initially successful. Eventually,
upon appeal and upon further arguments being made to the High Court judge who
heard the appeal, DJL’s applications were dismissed. The arrests of the Vessel
and _MV Makassar_ therefore remained in place.

3 The summons before me was filed in February 2011 by Megastar Shipping Pte
Ltd (“Megastar”) which had, prior to the arrest of the Vessel, acted as the
Vessel’s agent in Singapore pursuant to an agency agreement dated 28 October
2008 between DJL and itself. Under the same agreement, Megastar had also
provided agency services to _MV Makassar_. Megastar’s application in the
summons was, firstly, for liberty to intervene and, secondly, for an order
that the sum of US$471,815.59 being expenses that it had incurred in respect
of the Vessel whilst she was under arrest should rank as Sheriff’s expenses. I
granted Megastar liberty to intervene.

4 Subsequently, I heard Megastar’s application in respect of the second prayer
in the summons. At the same time, I heard a similar application made by
Megastar in Adm 175 in respect of expenses it had incurred for the _MV
Makassar_ while the latter vessel was under arrest.

5 The issues that arose in this application and the application in Adm 175
were the same and the facts were similar as well although they differed in
relation to the quantum of the claims and, of course, in the documentation
supporting the expenditure.

6 In my judgment in summons 699 of 2011 filed in Adm 175 ([2012] SGHC 175) I
considered the evidence and the arguments and came to the conclusion that
Megastar’s expenditure on the _MV Makassar_ should not be allowed to rank as
Sheriff’s expenses. For the reasons given in that judgment, I have come to a
similar conclusion in this case.

7 Accordingly, Megastar’s application must be dismissed with costs. I will
hear the parties on the quantum of the costs to be awarded.
