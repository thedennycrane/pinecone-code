when they fell due.

3.The petition was filed by Internationale Container Trasnport GmbH, a Germany

4.The petition asserted that the company was indebted to the petitioner in the
sum of S$568,716.50. There was a judgment against the company for US$290,660
with interest and costs. The sum $568,716.50 was comprised of $508,739.52
being the equivalent of US$290,660 and interest $59,976.98 up to the date of
judgment (October 23, 2000).

5.The petitioner’s solicitors sent the usual letter of demand. The company
failed to pay within the 21 day period. So, the petitioner asserted, the
company the Companies Act (Cap 50) was deemed to be insolvent and unable to
pay its debts as and when they fell due.

6.The petition first came up for hearing on 9 February 2001. It was adjourned.

7.At the hearing of the petition, Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation Limited
("OCBC"), supported the application. OCBC asserted that it was a creditor to
the tune of $17,256,820.47.

8.I was made aware that there were several other judgments against the company
for a total amount of $7,000,000.

9.The company did not dispute or disprove the assertions of the petitioner.
There was no affidavit in opposition to the petition. In the circumstances,
the petitioner had made out is case. It was in the interest of justice that
the company should no longer be in the hands of and under the control of the
directors. I therefore granted the petition and placed the company in the
hands of the liqudiators and made the usual consequential orders.
