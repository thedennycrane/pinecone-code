Facts

Held, dismissing the appeal:

**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. This was an appeal by Mr Tay Swee Sze who was served with a subpoena to
attend as a witness in the Inquiry presently held before the assistant
registrar Mr Phang Hsiao Chung. Mr Tay, through his counsel, applied to set
aside the subpoena but his application was refused by Mr Phang; and it was
against that refusal that Mr Tay appealed before me. The subpoena was issued
at the instance of the second defendant in this Originating Summons, No. 939
of 1991.

2\. Mr Tay was a partner in the firm of Arthur Anderson in 1996 when the first
and second defendants in this Originating Summons were ordered by the judge to
produce an account of all the assets of the Estate of Ong Seng King. The first
defendant appointed Arthur Anderson on 8 November 1996 with instructions to
review all documents and records belonging to the Estate and to prepare a
report to assist her to comply with the order of court.

3\. In the appeal before me, Mr Chandra Mohan appeared on behalf of Mr Tay. He
conceded that Mr Tay was then the partner-in-charge of this matter at Arthur
Anderson at the material time. However, he argued that the firm’s file was
transferred to another partner, Mr Tam Chee Chong who had since taken the
matter with him to his new firm Deloitte & Touch. Mr Mohan said that no
relevant documents, including documents perused or considered in preparing
reports, work sheets, notes and memoranda relating to this file are currently
in Arthur Anderson. Counsel submitted that in addition to transferring the
file to Mr Tam Chee Chong, all the responsibilities relating to the
supervision of the file and the conduct of work relating to it had also been
transferred to Mr Tam.

4\. Counsel argued that the subpoena issued by the second defendant against Mr
Tay was "not necessary and immaterial to the matter at hand". He submitted
that Arthur Anderson had never been engaged by the second defendant to act in
the matter of the estate of Ong Seng King. It was asserted that the second
defendant was merely riding "piggyback" on the first defendant’s affidavits
for the purposes of complying with the order of court that was directed at
both defendants (at that time the third and fourth defendants had not been
joined).

5\. Mr Mohan said that the Writ of Subpoena must be utilised for the
production of relevant evidence and that the court has jurisdiction to set
aside the subpoena because the intention of the party issuing the subpoena was
not to obtain relevant evidence, but rather, on the basis of an improper
motive. Counsel relied on the English case of _Macmillan Inc. v Bishopsgate
Investment Management PLC_(No. 1) [1993] 4 AER 998 in support. The test
propounded by the English court for ordering a non-party witness to produce a
document in litigation is to see whether the order could be "necessary for
disposing of the cause or matter or for saving costs". Mr Mohan deprecated the
use of the subpoena for the purpose of "fishing for evidence".

6\. The subpoena should obviously not be used frivolously or in a scandalous
manner, that is to say, to cause to be issued indiscriminately without any
basis or reason so as to embarrass or inconvenience the person subpoenaed.
Such occasions have been extremely rare, in my experience. On the present
facts I see no need to make any further qualifications or rules judicially by
way of guidelines in the use of the subpoena. In my view, persons who have
been served with a subpoena ought not to take a separate application to put
the issuing party to justify the issuance of the subpoena except in the
clearest cases.

7\. In the present case, Mr Tay was the partner-in-charge of the file at
Arthur Anderson at the material time from November 1996 to June 2000. The file
was then handed over to Mr Tam. On this fact alone, the second defendant was
justified in calling Mr Tay to testify at the inquiry. There is one the face
of the record, namely the affidavit of Mr Tay, filed confirming this fact, and
his previous affidavits producing copies of the accounts of the said estate,
to justify his attendance in court. In the end, his oral evidence may not to
be of much benefit to any party, but the same can be said of many a witness.
The ultimate value of the witness is not the gauge to determine whether he
ought to be subpoenaed. The _Macmillan_ case concerned the _subpoena duces
tecum_. The witness there was already in court and in the midst of cross-
examination when the subpoena was issued against him for the production of
certain transcripts of a private inquiry. In the present case, Mr Tay was
issued with a _subpoena ad testificandum_ as well as a _subpoena duces tecum_.
In the circumstances outlined above, the subpoenas were not unreasonably
issued. It is open to Mr Tay to testify, when called, that he has no further
or other documents in his possession, and cross-examined on his testimony.
These are all matters rightfully in the domain of the judge at the substantive
hearing.

8\. As Millet J said in _Macmillan_ ’s case (_ibid._ , page 1002), a third
party cannot be compelled to give discovery of any document in his possession
merely because it may be relevant to an issue in the case, but he is amenable
to the process of the _subpoena duces tecum_ provided it is limited to
evidence that is both material and admissible. The material sought (if Mr Tay
still has them) are clearly material and appears to be admissible. These
concern the documents relating to the assets and accounts of the estate of Ong
Seng King, which is the subject matter of the present inquiry before Mr Phang.

9\. For the reasons above, the appeal was dismissed.
