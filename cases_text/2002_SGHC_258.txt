Held, awarding interlocutory judgment for the first plaintiffs’ claim and part
of the first defendants’ counterclaims,

(1) Hola had a valid claim for damages as Hiap Tian Soon had conceded
liability for the damaged piles (see [12]-[16]).

(2) Hola’s right to an equitable set-off was not excluded by contract. In a
building contract, one starts with the presumption that each party is to be
entitled to all remedies arising by operation of law, including the right to
set-off. However, it is open to parties to rebut that presumption by contrary
provisions in the contract, provided that clear and unequivocal words are
used. Here the parties did not craft additional provisions to import the
concept of ‘temporary finality’ into the contract, and it can only be inferred
that Hola’s right of set-off remained intact (see [17] – [32]).

(3) It was not necessary for Hola to inform Hiap Tian Soon that it intended to
exercise the right of set-off. In any case, Hola’s General Manager, Lau Yaw
Seng, had testified that he had orally informed Hiap Tian Soon of his
intention to set off the amounts (see [33]).

(4) However, a party purporting to exercise the right of set-off must quantify
his loss by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith. In deciding
what a reasonable assessment is, the court must take into account, inter alia,
the quantum of the sum purported to be set-off and the complexity of the
rectification works required. The set-off sum of $214,196.90 claimed by Hola
was by no means a small amount, and they ought to have done more than to
obtain two casual verbal estimates of the costs involved. Hola had accordingly
failed to quantify their losses by means of a reasonable assessment, and could
not rely on the defence of equitable set-off. As such, Hiap Tian Soon’s
termination of the contract was valid and they were entitled to succeed on
their claim (see [34] – [45]).

(5) Hola’s counterclaim for loss and damages arising from Hiap Tian Soon’s
failure to proceed with reasonable diligence would be allowed. Hiap Tian
Soon’s progress of work had consistently lagged behind the construction
programme they had furnished to both Hola and the architects. Further, they
had persisted in their delay despite reminders from Hola to expedite the work
(see [46] – [55]).

(6) Hiap Tian Soon was however not liable for delay in handing over the site
from 24 July 2001 to 27 September 2001, since Hola were themselves in delay in
checking on the progress of the hand-over, and had also consented to the
delayed hand over (see [56] – [59]).

(7) As the original contract price was revised downwards from $10,090,000 to
$7,995,000, it was unconscionable of Hola to call on the performance bond in
the sum of $1,090,000. The sum payable under the performance bond is subject
to revision unless the parties have agreed that that amount is to be
unaffected by any changes to the original contract sum. Hola was therefore
only entitled to call on and demand payment on the performance bond in the sum
of $799,500, based on 10% of the revised contract sum (see [60] - [67]).

(8) With regard to Hola’s counterclaim for failure to rectify the defective
works, Hiap Tian Soon had generally conceded liability on the damaged piles
and as such were liable for 158 piles as well as for piles subsequently
discovered damaged in grids 8/B and 6/A (see [68]-[72]).

**Judgment**  _Cur Adv Vult_

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

_

The facts

_

1\. By a contract dated 20 May 2000 (the Contract), the first defendants, Hola
Development Pte Ltd (Hola) employed Hiap Tian Soon Construction Pte Ltd (the
first plaintiffs) to construct a light industrial flatted factory with a
basement car park at Ubi Avenue 1. The contract period commenced on 24 July
2000 and was to end 15 months later (in October 2001). The first plaintiffs
commenced piling works on or about 21 July 2000 and these works were completed
in September 2000. In reliance upon two interim payment certificates issued by
Mr Cheong Jiong Chian from the firm of IMT Architects (the Architects),
Interim Certificate Nos 1 and 2, certifying that the piles were satisfactorily
installed, Hola made payment to the first plaintiffs for the installed piles.

2\. The first plaintiffs then began excavation works using the ‘open cut
method’ for the basement excavation without obtaining prior approval from ASE
Designtec, the project structural engineers, or the Building and Construction
Authority (BCA). The excavation works resulted in soil movement which in turn
damaged the piles that had been installed, causing substantial delays to the
project. By this time, Interim Certificate Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 had already
been issued. Upon realising the full extent of the defects, Hola’s General
Manager, Mr Lau Yaw Seng (Lau) approached the Architects to take into
consideration the defective piles and works by way of a retrospective
valuation of all work done when issuing the subsequent interim certificates.
The Architects however, declined to certify the cost of the rectification
works in subsequent interim certificates. Consequently, Hola decided to
withhold payment of the sums certified under the said interim certificates.

3\. On 18 July 2001, the first plaintiffs terminated the Contract on the
grounds of non-payment by Hola. Hola however asserted that the first
plaintiffs' termination of the Contract was conduct amounting to an unlawful
repudiation of the Contract and accepted this repudiation, bringing the
Contract to an end. Hola called on the performance bond furnished by the first
plaintiffs, which had been guaranteed by the second plaintiff Goh Kim Hock
(Goh) who is the first plaintiffs' director.

4\. On 22 October 2001, the first plaintiffs applied for an injunction to
restrain Hola from receiving any monies under the performance bond pending
trial of this action. The injunction was granted on 15 January 2002. On 8
February 2002, the first plaintiffs discontinued this action against the
second defendant Lonpac Insurance Bhd, who had issued the performance bond in
favour of Hola.

_

The pleadings

_

5\. The first plaintiffs' claim against Hola was for a sum of $457,152.13,
being the retention sum and the amount certified under several interim payment
certificates issued by the Architects. This amount was disputed by Hola, who
argued that the first plaintiffs had failed to take into consideration the
fact that one of the interim payment certificates (No. 13), amounted to a
negative certification to reflect items that were allegedly removed from the
building site when the first plaintiffs vacated the premises. Hola argued
therefore that the correct sum due under the payment certificates (as well as
the retention sum) should only be $358,107.94.

6\. Hola refused to make payment under the payment certificates on the ground
that they had valid claims against the first plaintiffs for defective building
work which they purported to set-off against the certified amount due under
Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10; this amounted to $214,196.90.

7\. Further, Hola asserted various counterclaims inter alia, for their losses
resulting from the first plaintiffs' alleged invalid determination as well as
from the delay in the progress of their work and in the hand-over of the site.
Finally, Hola argued that it was entitled to receive the full sum of
$1,009,000.00 pursuant to the performance bond procured by the plaintiffs.

_

The issues

_

8\. At the outset, the parties were informed that only liability would be
determined at the trial and the quantum of damages would be decided by the
Registrar at a later stage, if necessary.

_

The plaintiffs' case

_

9\. The first issue which I had to consider was whether the first plaintiffs'
claim against Hola should succeed.

10\. To decide this point, it was necessary to consider whether the first
plaintiffs' termination of the Contract on 18 July 2001 was valid. The first
plaintiffs argued that it had terminated the Contract in accordance with cl
26(1)(a) of the Conditions of Contract on the ground that Hola had failed to
pay monies due to them under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Clause
26(1)(a) of the Conditions of Contract provides:

> > Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies which the Contractor
> may possess, if

> > (a) The Employer does not pay to the Contractor the amount due on any
> certificate within the Period for Honouring Certificates named in the
> appendix to these Conditions and continues such default for seven days after
> receipt by registered post or recorded delivery of a notice from the
> Contractor stating that notice of determination under this Condition will be
> served if payment is not made within seven days from receipt thereof; or
>>

>> (b) …

>>

>> (c) …

>>

>> (d) …

> > then the Contractors may thereupon by notice by registered post or
> recorded delivery to the Employer or Architect forthwith determine the
> employment of the Contractor under this Contract; provided that such notice
> shall not be given unreasonably or vexatiously.’

11\. While conceding the non-payment, Hola contended that they had a valid
set-off in respect of damaged and defective piles as against Interim
Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Pursuant to this right of set-off, Hola claimed
to withhold the balance amount due under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10
pending rectification of the defective piles. Hola thus argued that the first
plaintiffs' termination of the Contract was invalid and amounted to an
unlawful repudiation.

_

Was Hola’s set-off valid?

_

12\. The law on equitable set-off is clear. The doctrine has its roots in the
historical intervention of the courts of equity to allow deductions whenever
there were good equitable grounds for directly impeaching the demand which the
plaintiff-creditor was seeking to enforce. The only cross-claims that may be
deducted therefrom are those that arise out of the same transaction or are so
closely connected with the plaintiff’s demands that it would be manifestly
unjust to allow him to enforce payment without taking account of the cross-
claim. As Chao J noted in _OCWS Logistics v Soon Meng Construction Pte Ltd_
[1999] 2 SLR 376:

> > An unliquidated claim of the defendant for damages could be set-off if it
> arose from the same transaction as the claim of the plaintiff or was closely
> connected with the subject matter of the claim: this was equitable set-off,
> see _Hanak v Green_ [1958] 2 QB 9 and _Morgan & Son Ltd v Martin Johnson &
> Co Ltd_ [1949] 1 KB 107.

13\. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in _Pacific Rim_ _Investments Pte Ltd v
Lam Seng Tiong & Anor_ [1995] 3 SLR 1 found (at p 14) that:

> > …the exercise of equitable set-off is only permitted, if equitable
> considerations support such an exercise. It arises where there are good
> equitable grounds for directly impeaching the title to the legal demand
> which the creditor is seeking to enforce. As Lord Denning MR succinctly said
> in _The Nanfri,_ at pp 974-975:
>>

>>> …it is not every cross-claim which can be deducted. It is only cross-
claims that arise out of the same transaction or are closely connected with
it. And it is only cross-claims which go directly to impeach the plaintiff’s
demands, that is, so closely connected with his demands that it would be
manifestly unjust to allow him to enforce payment without taking into account
his cross-claim.’

14\. I turn next to consider whether Hola had a valid defence of set-off to
the first plaintiffs' claim.

15\. The first plaintiffs did not deny responsibility in respect of the
defective piles. In fact, they conceded liability for the damaged piles and
for rectification costs of 158 piles. That would mean that the first
plaintiffs conceded that Hola has a valid claim for damages. However, the
first plaintiffs objected to Hola’s claim of having a valid set-off at the
time when payment became due under the certificates, on the ground that any
common law right to set-off had been excluded by the Contract.

16\. It is therefore necessary to consider whether, by the terms of the
Contract between the first plaintiffs and Hola, the latter's right of set-off
had been excluded.

_

Was Hola’s right of set-off excluded by the Contract?

_

17\. It is trite law that parties may, by contract, exclude the remedy of
equitable set-off. In _Pacific Rim Investments (supra)_ , the Court of Appeal
noted that the right to an equitable set-off may be expressly excluded by
contract. It would suffice if the contract contained clear words which
excluded the right to set off, either expressly or by necessary implication:
(_Kum Leng General Contractor v Hytech Builders Pte Ltd_[1996] 1 SLR 751 and
_Aurum Building Services (Pte) Ltd v Greatearth Construction Pte Ltd_ [1994] 3
SLR 330).

18\. In _Kum Leng General Contractor v Hytech Builders Pte Ltd_[1996] 1 SLR
751, Rajendran J cited (at p 755) _Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd v Modern
Engineering (Bristol) Ltd_ [1974] AC 689 with approval, quoting Diplock LJ:

> > It is, of course, open to parties to a contract for sale of goods or for
> work and labour or for both to exclude by express agreement a remedy for its
> breach which would otherwise arise by operation of law or such remedy may be
> excluded by usage binding upon the parties…But in construing such a contract
> one starts with the presumption that neither party intends to abandon any
> remedies for its breach arising by operation of law, and clear express words
> must be used in order to rebut this presumption.

19\. Here, the first plaintiffs argued that the _only_ mechanism for Hola to
have recovered the cost of rectifying the damaged work, by way of set-off, is
that provided for in cl 2(1) of the Conditions of Contract which states:

> > The Contractor shall (subject to sub-clauses (2) and (3) of this
> Condition) forthwith comply with all instructions issued to him by the
> Architect in regard to any matter in respect of which the Architect is
> expressly empowered by these Conditions to issue instructions. If within
> seven days after receipt of a written notice from the Architect requiring
> compliance with an instruction the Contractor does not comply therewith,
> then the Employer may employ and pay other persons to execute any work
>>

>> whatsoever which may be necessary to give effect to such instruction and
all costs incurred in connection with such employment shall be recoverable
from the Contractor by the Employer as a debt or may be deducted by him from
any monies due or to become due to the Contractor under this Contract.

20\. The first plaintiffs submitted that on a true construction of cl 2(1),
Hola was only able to recover the cost of rectifying damaged work by way of
set-off, if the Architects had issued an instruction to the first plaintiffs
to rectify the damaged work and, the first plaintiffs had failed to comply
with such instruction or do any rectification, causing Hola to engage another
contractor to rectify the work. The first plaintiffs argued that prior to 18
July 2001, Hola had not employed another contractor to carry out the
rectification work; therefore, Hola had no right of set-off before this date.

21\. To decide this point, I considered the case of _Lojan Properties Pte Ltd
v Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd_ [1991] SLR 80, where one of the issues before
the Court of Appeal was whether on the true interpretation of the contract
provisions, the appellants were entitled to deduct from the amounts certified
by the architects under an interim certificate of payment, sums of money which
the appellants claimed to have expended on the rectification of defective
works which the respondents had failed to do. The Court of Appeal agreed with
the trial judge’s findings that the right of set-off had been excluded by the
contract used between the parties.

22\. It is noteworthy that the contract used by the parties in _Lojan
Properties_ was based on the Revised Standard Form of the Singapore Institute
of Architects (Revised SIA Form). As Karthigesu JA noted (at p 84C):

> > The unique features of the Conditions of Contract are that the contractor
> is assured of regular periodic payments during the period the contract works
> are in progress based on a retrospective revaluation of all work carried out
> under the contract (see cl 31(1) and (2)) and subject to the exceptions
> mentioned in cl 31(11) the contractor is put in a position to enforce
> payment if payment is not made on the due date by action in the courts.

23\. Clause 31(11) of the Conditions of Contract in _Lojan Properties_
provided:

> > No certificate of the Architect shall be final and binding in any dispute
> between the employer and the contractor, whether before an arbitrator or in
> the courts, save only that, _in the absence of fraud or improper pressure or
> interference by either party, full effect by way of summary judgment or
> interim award or otherwise shall, in the absence of express provision, be
> given to all decisions and certificates of the architect_ …until final
> judgment or award, as the case may be, and until such final judgment or
> award _such decision or certificates shall…be binding on the employer and
> the contractor_ in relation to any matter which, under the terms of the
> contract, the Architect has as a fact taken into account or allowed or
> disallowed, or any disputed matter upon which under the terms of the
> contract he has as a fact ruled, in his certificates or the terms of the
> contract….[emphasis added].

24\. It is clear that in coming to its decision, the court was heavily
influenced by the unique features of the contract. Karthigesu JA specifically
approved the following passage from the first instance judgment, where the
judge, referring to cl 31(11), said:

> > It is intended that the contractor be paid the amounts expressed to be
> payable in the interim certificates, and if no payment is made by the
> employer it is intended to enable the contractor in the absence of fraud,
> improper pressure or interference or in the absence of express provisions,
> to obtain quick summary judgment for the amounts certified as due. In so far
> as any sum claimed by the employer is concerned, only the amounts expressly
> deductible under the contract may be set off against the amount due under
> the interim certificate. I therefore come to the conclusion that subject to
> any deduction or set-off as provided expressly in the contract, the amounts
> certified in the interim certificates are due and payable to the plaintiffs.

25\. The contract between the parties was based on the 1980 version of
‘Agreement and Schedule of Conditions of Building Contract (Private edition
without quantities)’, which is in turn based largely on the RIBA/ JCT forms.
The contract did not contain cl 31(11) and the corresponding concept of
‘temporary finality’ which was introduced in the Revised SIA Form specifically
to limit the Employer’s right of set-off. The absence of cl 31(11) or a clause
substantially similar to it in the contract was fatal to the first plaintiffs'
argument -- that the contract had excluded Hola’s right of set-off.

26\. The first plaintiffs cited _Pembanaan Leow Tuck Chui & Sons Sdn Bhd v Dr
Leela’s Medical Centre Sdn Bhd_ [1995] 2 MLJ 57 in support of their
contention. This was a decision of the Supreme Court of Kuala Lumpur where it
was held that the express enumeration of permitted set-offs in the contract
implied that the employer was limited to make deductions which fell strictly
within the scope of permitted set-offs on the basis of the _expressio unius_
principle. The court found that there were seven express provisions in the
contract which permitted the employer to set-off sums. The court held that
having regard to these provisions, and applying the _expressio unius_
principle, the common law right of set-off had been extinguished.

27\. It is interesting to note that the contract in _Pembanaan_ was very
similar to the present contract between the first plaintiffs and Hola. Clause
2(1) in the _Pembanaan_ contract is identical to cl 2(1) of the Contract and
states:

> > The contractor shall (subject to sub-clauses (2) and (3) of this
> condition) forthwith comply with all instructions issued to him by the
> architect in regard to any matter in respect of which the architect is
> expressly empowered by these conditions to issue instructions. If within
> seven days after receipt of a written notice from the architect requiring
> compliance with an instruction the contractor does not comply therewith,
> then the employer may employ and pay other persons to execute any work
> whatsoever which may be necessary to give effect to such instruction and all
> costs incurred in connection with such employment shall be recoverable from
> the contractor by the employer as a debt or may be deducted by him from any
> monies due or to become due to the contractor under this contract.

28\. The Supreme Court in _Pembanaan_ held that the builder was under no
contractual obligation to comply with the employer’s complaints relating to
defective works unless supported by written instructions issued by the
Architects pursuant to cl 2(1). The ordinary common law right of set-off had
been extinguished, not expressly but by clear implication. As Edgar Joseph Jr
FCJ noted (at p 78):

> > In our view, therefore, the express enumeration of permitted set-offs in a
> contract or sub-contract, can imply that a defendant builder or main
> contractor, as the case may be, is limited to making such deductions from
> the amounts claimed as fall strictly within the scope of permitted set-offs,
> and nothing else, on the basis of the _expressio unius_ principle.

29\. With respect, the problem with the Supreme Court’s reasoning is that it
runs counter to the decision of the House of Lords in _Gilbert-Ash Ltd v
Modern Engineering_[1974] AC 689. In that case, the employer was empowered by
three (3) conditions in the contract to make deductions from the amount
certified under interim certificates, for breaches of particular warranties by
the contractor. Lord Diplock noted (at p 719):

> > The effect of these conditions is to substitute for the sums which would
> be deductible from the price by operation of law in respect of those
> breaches of contract, sums calculated in the manner agreed. _The expressio
> unius rule of construction cannot be prayed in aid to exclude the right of
> the employer to set up breaches of other warranties in diminution or
> extinction of the instalment of the purchase price stated in the certificate
> as due_ [emphasis added.]

30\. There is much merit in Lord Diplock’s observations. Apart from the
obvious danger of excessive reliance on the _expressio unius_ principle which
requires one to infer specific intent from silence, it is clear that the law
presumes that parties are entitled to all legal remedies, including the
defence of set-off. As Goff LJ stated (at p 988B in _The Nanfri; Federal
Commerce & Navigation Co. Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc_ [1978] 1 QB 927, (a case
where charterers sought to deduct from the hire due to the owners the damages
arising from the vessel’s loss of speed):

> > First, it may be said that this charterparty contains express provisions
> in clauses 11 and 14 allowing deductions and therefore on the principle
> expressio unius est exclusio alterius they should not be allowed in any
> other cases. In my judgment, however, that is not sufficient because
> equitable set-off is part of the general law and can only be excluded by
> clear provisions to that effect, and such an inference as I am now
> considering is not sufficient.

31\. While it is clearly possible to exclude any or all of these remedies by
way of contract, this must be done clearly and unequivocally; one effective
means of exclusion is by way of the ‘temporary finality’ provision, as in cl
31(11) of the Revised SIA Form. It is equally clear that the position in
Singapore differs from that stated in _Pembanaan_ as the Court of Appeal in
_Pacific Rim_ _Investments_ has quoted _The Nanfri_ with approval.

32\. The rule laid down in _Gilbert-Ash_ is clear and simple to apply. In
relation to a building contract, one starts with the presumption that each
party is to be entitled to all those remedies for breach as would arise by
operation of law, including the right of set-off. However, it is open to
parties to rebut that presumption by contrary provisions in the contract,
provided that clear and unequivocal words are used. In the present context, it
was open to the parties to exclude the defence of set-off, by using the SIA
Revised Form for example, or, if the RIBA form was preferred, by crafting
additional provisions to import the concept of ‘temporary finality’ into the
contract. The parties did not choose to do so and it can only be inferred that
Hola’s right of set-off remained intact. I therefore find that Hola’s right of
set-off had not been excluded by Contract.

_

Had the first plaintiffs been informed that Hola intended to exercise the
right of set-off?

_

33\. I noted the first plaintiffs' contention that they had not been informed
of Hola’s intention to set-off the amounts due under Interim Certificates Nos.
8, 9 and 10; I reject their contention that this was required for set-off.
Even if I am wrong on this point, I am prepared to accept Lau’s testimony that
he had orally informed the first plaintiffs of his intention to set off the
amounts, by 24 April 2002. In his written testimony (at para 50) Lau stated:

> > …Hiap Tian Soon alleged by letter dated 25 July 2001 that Hola’s claim was
> a sham and was an excuse to justify the non-payment of the interim
> certificates. This was definitely not true since I had earlier informed Goh
> Kim Hock [the second plaintiff] of my intention when he came to look for me
> for payment. I had also told him on a number of occasions that payment would
> not be made until the damaged piles were rectified and stated so in my
> letter to the first plaintiffs dated 31 July 2001…

_

Were Hola’s losses quantifiable by a reasonable assessment made in good faith?

_

34\. The next main contention on the part of the first plaintiffs in relation
to the set-off was, that Hola’s losses in relation to the defective piles were
not ‘quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith’. In
support of this argument, the first plaintiffs pointed out that the project's
quantity surveyor, Ian Chng Cost Consultants (the Quantity Surveyor) only
replied with a cost assessment on 23 July 2001, after the first plaintiffs'
purported termination of the Contract. The first plaintiffs argued that Hola
had not quantified their damages in good faith at the time they purported to
set-off their claim, and were therefore precluded from relying on the defence
of equitable set-off. As counsel for the first plaintiffs submitted:

> > Even if the right to set-off did arise, the damages or cost of rectifying
> the piles was never quantified by means of a reasonable assessment made in
> good faith, at least prior to the date of the termination of the Contract
> (i.e. 18 July 2001).

35\. Hola on the other hand, argued that while a reasonable assessment of the
unliquidated damages must be made in good faith in order for the right of
equitable set-off to be exercised, the party purporting to exercise the set-
off need not arrive at an accurate and exact figure.

36\. It is clear from _Pacific Rim Investments_ that equitable set-off may
only be exercised where the loss is quantifiable by means of a reasonable
assessment made in good faith. As Thean JA noted in _Pacific Rim
Investments_(at p 11):

> > The majority of the Court of Appeal [in _The Nanfri_], Lord Denning MR and
> Goff LJ, agreed that in the circumstances the appellant charterers were
> entitled to an equitable set-off and to deduct from the hire, sums as loss
> arising from the loss of speed because the claims were so closely connected,
> _provided that the unliquidated loss was quantifiable by means of a
> reasonable assessment made in good faith_ [emphasis added.]

37\. Indeed, in _The Nanfri_ , Lord Denning MR specifically noted (at p 975E):

> > If the charterer quantifies his loss by a reasonable assessment made in
> good faith – and deducts the sum quantified – then he is not in default. The
> shipowner cannot withdraw his vessel on account of non-payment of hire nor
> hold him guilty at that point of any breach of contract. If it subsequently
> turns out that he has deducted too much, the shipowner can of course recover
> the balance. But that is all.

38\. It is clear from the above passage that all that is required from the
party purporting to exercise the right of set-off is, that he seeks to
quantify his loss in a bona fide way by reasonable means. The party does not
actually have to produce a specific and final figure, quantified by
professional quantity surveyors, contrary to what the first plaintiffs
suggested. Similarly, the fact that the estimated figure may eventually turn
out to be too high or too low is not, in itself, sufficient to preclude a
party from relying on set-off as a defence.

39\. There was evidence that some attempts were made by Hola to obtain an
estimate of the cost of the rectification works. Lau testified (para 40 of his
affidavit of evidence-in-chief) that he had obtained a verbal estimate from
the Quantity Surveyor for the sum of S$200,000.00 prior to the purported
termination:

> > …I do remember that during the course of these discussions in or about
> April 2001, one of the Consultants had estimated the cost of the
> rectification of the damaged piles to be in the region of $200,000.00.

40\. Wong Kwong Yow of ASE Designtec (the structural engineer) had also
deposed (para 28 of his affidavit) to this discussion and the verbal estimate
that was offered, in the following terms:

> > [Mr Peter Lau] also requested for an estimate of the cost of repairs. I
> remember that during the discussion, the sum of $200,000.00 was brought up
> in passing, being the estimated cost of rectification for the defective
> piles.

41\. In addition, Lau obtained a second verbal estimate from a friend of his
who was in the construction industry (who did not testify) who informed Lau
that the estimated cost of repairs would be approximately $300,000.00.
However, no evidence was offered by Hola to explain how these estimates were
arrived at.

42\. It is important to remember that what is reasonable depends on the facts
of each case. In deciding what a reasonable assessment is, the court must take
into account various factors. I propose to list just a few factors.

43\. First, the quantum of the sum purported to be set-off is highly relevant.
Here, Hola were seeking to set-off a sum of $214,196.90, which is by no means
a small amount. Further, this sum would, but for the set-off, have clearly
been due to the first plaintiffs, as these sums were certified by the
Architects. Secondly, the court must consider the complexity of the
rectification works required. While parties are clearly not required to have
ascertained the exact cause of the problem or calculated the rectification
cost down to the last dollar, they should at least draw a distinction between
rectification which is easily quantifiable (e.g. if all that was required was
the purchase of certain materials to replace defective materials) and that
which would clearly require closer consideration such as in this case, where
different parties were giving differing quotes. In the latter instance, the
party who is purporting to exercise the right of set-off will be held to a
higher standard than he would have been held to in the first situation. While,
as I have stated earlier, it would not have been necessary for Hola to have
obtained a full quantity surveyor’s report in order to meet the reasonableness
requirement, they certainly must have done more than they actually did. It is
not enough to obtain two casual verbal estimates in passing; at the very
least, Hola must have had some basis or engaged in some form of rational
analysis before coming to an estimate of the costs involved. I find that the
two estimates used by Hola were not reasonable and that Hola had failed to
show that the losses had been quantified by means of a reasonable assessment.

44\. Consequently, it is not open to Hola to rely on the defence of equitable
set-off as, the loss in respect of which they were purporting to exercise the
set-off was not quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good
faith. As such, the first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract was valid.

_

Quantum of the first plaintiffs' claim

_

45\. The next issue which I have to consider is whether the quantum claimed by
the first plaintiffs was appropriate. Assuming their claim against Hola was
valid, Hola should be liable for the total amount certified under the interim
payment certificates and which remains outstanding. Hola had argued that the
sum should be $358,107.94 whereas the first plaintiffs put forward a higher
figure of $457,152.13, which failed to take into account Interim Certificate
No 13 (which showed a negative certification of $84,050.76). As the total
amount certified under all the interim payment certificates came to
$1,310,661.83 and, by the plaintiffs' own evidence, the amount received from
Hola was $952,553.89, the quantum of the first plaintiffs' claim should
logically be the difference between the two (2) amounts, which is Hola’s
figure of $358,107.94. However, in the event the first plaintiffs disagree
with my calculations, I direct the Registrar to assess the amount due and
owing to them.

_

Hola’s counterclaims

_

46\. I next turn to consider whether Hola’s counterclaims have any merit.

_

Damages for the delay in the progress of the plaintiff’s work

_

47\. Hola argued that the first plaintiffs were in breach of their obligation
to proceed regularly and diligently, pursuant to cl 25 of the Contract which
provides:

> > (1) If the Contractor shall make default in any one or more of the
> following respects, that is to say:-
>

>> > …

> > (a) If he fails to proceed regularly and diligently with the Works or
>>

>> (b) …

>>

>> (c) …,

> > > then the Architectmay give to him a notice by registered post or
> recorded delivery specifying the default, and if the Contractor either shall
> continue such default for fourteen days after receipt of such notice or
> shall at any time thereafter repeat such default (whether previously
> repeated or not), then the Employer without prejudice to other rights or
> remedies, may within ten days after such continuance or repetition by notice
> by registered post or recorded delivery forthwith determine the employment
> of the Contractor under this Contract provided that such notice shall not be
> given unreasonably or vexatiously.

48\. Against this, the first plaintiffs contended that their obligation was
only to complete the project by the date of completion provided for in the
Contract. Since they had validly terminated the Contract before this date, it
would be illogical to speak about them being responsible for the delay in the
completion of the project.

49\. Following the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Jurong Engineering Ltd v
Paccan Building Technology Pte Ltd_ [1999] 3 SLR 667, the law on this point is
clear. The main contractors in _Jurong Engineering_ terminated the subcontract
on the grounds that the subcontractor had failed to proceed with reasonable
diligence and had thus breached the agreement between the parties. The court
held that ‘reasonable diligence’ could only be determined by pacing the
progress of the subcontractor’s work against the subcontract programme. As Goh
J opined (at p 668):

> > If the progress of the subcontract works consistently lagged behind and
> did not keep pace with the subcontract programme, then the respondents
> [subcontractors] could not be said to be progressing with reasonable
> diligence.

50\. Goh J also quoted _Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts_ (11 ed
vol 2 paras 9-034 and 9-035 (where it was stated that ‘.._it would be absurd,
it is submitted, if the owner was to be without remedy until after a perhaps
distant completion date…’._

51\. While the material contractual term in _Jurong Engineering_ was
‘reasonable diligence’, I am of the view that the same principles should apply
when one is dealing with the phrase ‘regularly and diligently’, as was used in
the Contract. On the facts before me, I find that the first plaintiffs'
progress of work consistently lagged behind the construction programme which
they had furnished to Hola and the Architects. By January 2001, some six (6)
months after the date of commencement of the work, the first plaintiffs were
already 2 months in delay when the progress of their work was measured against
the construction programme they had submitted. This delay was very serious in
the light of the fact that the contractual completion date was 9 October 2001,
a mere 10 months away. Further, it should be noted that the first plaintiffs
persisted in their delay despite reminders from Hola to expedite the work.

52\. Despite the Architects' request (on or about 19 January 2001) that the
first plaintiffs expedite the work and submit a revised master programme which
incorporated efforts to make up for lost time, the latter submitted a revised
construction programme pushing back the completion date to December 2001.
However, the first plaintiffs were soon in delay again, even in respect of the
revised programme. By April 2001, they were more than 3 months behind the
revised schedule A second revised programme submitted in or about May 2001,
showing an expected completion date of April 2002. However, by 19 June 2001,
the first plaintiffs reported that they were 50 days behind schedule under the
second revised programme.

53\. I cannot accept the first plaintiffs' contention that they were at all
times ready and willing to carry out rectification works and that the delay
was in fact caused by the fact that the BCA had not given approval to carry
out such rectification. It is clear from the evidence that the first
plaintiffs had failed to do even those rectification works that did not need
BCA approval; for example, they failed to produce the necessary soil and earth
movement reports. Whilst the delay began in late 2000 or early 2001, soon
after the date of commencement, I find that the first plaintiffs only
submitted rectification proposals as late as June 2001. This was clear from
the architect’s testimony in cross-examination (N/E 135-136):

> > Q: In relation to damaged piles and sewer, you agree 1st Plaintiffs were
> anxious to rectify?
>>

>> A: No.

>>

>> Q: You agree 1st Plaintiffs showed willingness to rectify the damaged
works?

>>

>> A: No.

>>

>> Q: Why?

>>

>> A: Despite several reminders from my engineer to submit ECC surveys, they
were slow in responding despite several reminders at site meetings week after
week.

>>

>> Q: But 1st Plaintiffs complied with your engineer’s instructions and
submitted rectification proposals?

>>

>> A: Eventually yes they did submit plan quite late, June-July 2001, 2-3
months later.

54\. The first plaintiffs had also argued that even on the assumption that the
progress of works was in delay, this would not by itself be a breach of
contract, as cl 25 only gave Hola a right to determine their employment. This
argument must be rejected in the light of _Jurong Engineering_ where, the
Court of Appeal clearly envisaged that the breach of the obligation to proceed
with reasonable diligence will give rise to damages as well as to a right to
terminate the contractor’s employment. It should be noted that the Court of
Appeal quoted the following extract from _Hudson’s Building and Engineering
Contracts_ (11 ed vol 2 para 9-034) with approval:

> > …even in the absence of an express term for due diligence and of any
> linked express termination clause, both such terms require to be implied by
> law, in construction contracts and subcontracts generally, as a matter of
> business efficacy _. The primary obligation will, it is submitted, sound in
> damages_ if within the rules of remoteness, as where the nature of the work
> undertaken indicates that work by other contractors of the owner, or in a
> subcontract of the main contractor, or commitments entered into with
> neighbours or others, are within the contemplation of the contract as being
> dependent on the maintenance of a reasonable rate of progress….[emphasis
> added.]

55\. I therefore allow Hola’s counterclaim for loss and damages for breach of
the Contract arising from the first plaintiffs' failure to proceed with
reasonable diligence.

_

Delay in handing over the site

_

56\. The Contract was terminated on 18 July 2001. Pursuant to cl 26(2)(a) of
the Conditions of Contract, the contractor was obliged to hand over the site
of the project within 7 days, i.e. by 24 July 2001\. However, the site was
only handed over by the first plaintiffs on 3 October 2001. Hola claimed that
the first plaintiffs were liable for the losses suffered by Hola arising from
the delay in the hand-over of the site, between 24 July 2001 and 3 October
2001. The first plaintiffs only conceded liability in respect of the delay to
hand over the site, between 27 September 2001 and 3 October 2001. Are the
first plaintiffs liable for any loss suffered by Hola, arising from the delay
in handing over, between 24 July and 27 September, 2001?

57\. Hola argued that there is no clear evidence that they had waived their
right to damages against the first plaintiffs for the late hand-over of the
site between 24 July 2001 and 27 September 2001. The company argued that it
had never consented to the late hand-over, and that this was clear from
reminders that the Architects sent to the first plaintiffs requesting for the
hand-over of the site In his written testimony the architect (Cheong Jiong
Chian) deposed (at paras 38-41 of his affidavit):

> > Initially I had waited for Hiap Tian Soon to contact me to arrange a date
> for the handover of the site. However when Hiap Tian Soon failed to contact
> me to handover the site, I directed Hiap Tian Soon by way of a letter dated
> 29 August 2001 to the handover of the site on 4 September 2001.
>>

>> However, in a letter dated 4 September 2001, Hiap Tian Soon refused to do
so on the basis that they had not been paid for interim certificates 8, 9 and
10 and 11\. I then replied in a letter dated 7 September 2001 that the site
needed to be handed over so that the tenderers could conduct a site inspection
as part of their preparations for the new tender. In this respect I then
suggested 11 September 2001 for the handover of the site. Hiap Tian Soon
however proposed to hand over the site on 27 September 2001 in a letter dated
10 September 2001.

>>

>> By now, Hola noted with concern the inordinate delay by Hiap Tian Soon to
hand over the site after the termination of the contract. In a letter dated 18
September 2001, which I forwarded to Hiap Tian Soon, Hola reiterated the
urgency in taking over possession of the site and gave a deadline for the
handover of the site – 27 September 2001, failing which Hiap Tian Soon would
be in trespass…

>>

>> Notwithstanding this, Hiap Tian Soon only gave back possession of the site
to Hola on or about 3 October 2001. When Hiap Tian Soon failed to hand over
the site by 27 September 2001, I reminded them in a letter dated 28 September
2001 that they would be responsible for any delay in handing over the
possession of the site back to Hola…’

58\. I have not seen Hola’s letter dated 18 September 2001 as it was not
tendered as evidence. After considering the architect’s testimony and the
first plaintiffs' submissions, I find that the first plaintiffs are not liable
for the delay for the period between 24 July 2001 and 4 September 2001, since
Hola were themselves in delay in checking on the progress of the hand-over
and, did not write to the first plaintiffs until 29 August 2001 and, had
authorised the first plaintiffs to remain on the site until 4 September 2001
in that letter. In respect of the period 4-27 September 2001, I accept the
architect’s testimony that Hola had in fact consented to Hiap Tian Soon’s
handing over of the site on 27 September 2001. From the architect’s testimony,
it appeared that by the letter of 18 September, Hola allowed the first
plaintiffs to remain on the site until 27 September 2001, while noting that
thereafter, the first plaintiffs would be regarded as being in trespass.

59\. I find that the first plaintiffs are not liable for the delay in handing-
over of the site, between 24 July 2001 and 27 September 2001.

_

The performance bond

_

60\. Pursuant to the Letter of Award dated 20 May 2000, the first plaintiffs
had procured a performance bond in the sum of $1,009,000.00. The amount was
meant to be 10% of the original contract sum of $10,090,000.00 as spelt out in
the guarantee. Subsequently, the Architects revised the contract sum to
$7,995,000.00 following a request by Lau. The first plaintiffs consequently
contended that, given the reduction in the contract sum, the guarantee sum
must likewise be reduced to $799,500 (i.e. 10% of $7,995,000). However, Hola
argued that the parties had not contemplated the revision of the performance
bond; in support of this argument, Hola referred to Goh's evidence under
cross-examination (at N/E 5):

> > Q: Did you ask architects or first defendants for a reduction?
>>

>> A: No.

61\. However, it would appear clear from case-law that the claim for payment
under the performance bond should be confined to 10% of the revised contract
sum, and not 10% of the original contract sum, as argued by Hola. The Court of
Appeal's decision in _GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd_
[1999] 4 SLR 604 is instructive in this regard. The case established that
where the original contract sum has been revised downwards, the sum payable
under the performance bond should be based on the revised sum. It was further
deemed unconscionable for the holder of the performance bond to demand payment
based on the original contract sum.

62\. I accept that the revision of about 20% of the original contract sum in
the present case is much lower than the 65% revision in _GHL_. Even so, the
principle established in _GHL_ is clear. The revision of the contract sum
represents a reduction of the contractor’s responsibility towards the
developer. Under such circumstances, the security held by the developer in the
form of a performance bond must similarly be reduced. As was noted by Thean JA
(at p 617 of the case):

> > As between GHL and Unitrack, the latter’s commitment under the contract
> was considerably reduced and similarly the security for such commitment
> would, in normal cases, be correspondingly reduced.

63\. The Court of Appeal in _Dauphin Offshore Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v
The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa_ [2000] 1 SLR 657 did not
think it possible to define, in precise terms, what constitutes
_unconscionability_ and stated at para 42 (p 668):

> > …What kind of situation would constitute unconscionability would have to
> depend on the facts of each case…There is no pre-determined categorisation.

64\. In the present case, the contract sum was revised from $10,090,000.00 to
$7,995,000.00. As such, the amount payable under the performance bond should
be 10% of the revised contract sum, namely $799,500.00. It would therefore be
unconscionable of Hola to call on the performance bond in the sum of
$1,090,000.00.

65\. Hola had argued that the _GHL_ case may be distinguished as Hola and the
first plaintiffs, unlike the parties in _GHL_ , did not contemplate a revision
of the performance bond. This is a misreading of the _GHL_ case. The parties
in _GHL_ similarly did not contemplate an express revision of the performance
bond; what they had contemplated was a revision of the original contract sum.

66\. More importantly, the fact that the parties did not contemplate a
revision of the performance bond does not place that sum beyond revision. In
fact, the converse appears to be the case: the sum payable under the
performance bond is subject to revision _unless_ the parties have agreed that
that amount is to be unaffected by any changes to the original contract sum.
This can be seen at para 28 of _GHL_ (at p 617), where the Court of Appeal
stated:

> > GHL had not adduced any evidence to the effect that it was agreed that,
> notwithstanding the revision of the contract sum, the amount of performance
> bond would continue to be 10% of the original contract sum. It seems to us
> that in all probabilities after the revision of the contract on 30 April
> 1999 the parties contemplated that the amount of the bond would be
> correspondingly revised downwards to 10% of the revised contract sum…

67\. I therefore find that Hola are only entitled to call on and demand
payment on the performance bond in the sum of $799,500.00, based on 10% of the
revised contract sum; it was unconscionable of them to claim $1,009,000.00.

_

Dispute over the number of piles

_

68\. There only remains one minor issue to be addressed, relating to the
number of piles in respect of which the first plaintiffs were willing to
accept liability. The first plaintiffs had accepted that they are liable for
the damaged piles and for the rectification of 158 piles. That must mean that
the first plaintiffs admitted liability in respect of the original 32 piles
that were damaged as well as the piles in grid 7/A. However, Hola had argued
that in addition to these 158 piles, the first plaintiffs were also liable for
the piles subsequently discovered to be damaged in grids 8/B and 6/A.

69\. In a quotation dated 23 July 2001 from Hock Ann Piling Pte Ltd to the
first plaintiffs (see exhibit ‘GKH-19’ in Goh's affidavit), it was stated
that:

> > ...the nos. of RC Pile to be driven are 173 nos. as per the above
> mentioned drawing. Deducting pile cap 7/A for 20 nos. of RC piles already
> driven on 19 January 2001, the balance of RC pile will be driven will be 153
> nos.

70\. At trial, the structural engineer**** was cross-examined on this
quotation (N/E 130-131):

> > Q: See GKH-19 p145 of PW1’s EIC. You said to your counsel 187 compensating
> piles were required. Explain?
>>

>> A: 153+20+5 RC piles, so total is 178 not 187. Piles driven for 7/A were 20
in number and again found to be damaged, so 5 more had to be added.

>>

>> Q: If this is the case, 173 were original number of compensation piles but
5 more added. But 20 had been driven so balance is 153?

>>

>> A: Yes.

>>

>> Q: So total number of compensating piles should be 153+5 = 158?

>>

>> A: Yes

71\. It is clear that the structural engineer’s above testimony was in
relation to exhibit 'GKH-19' only, which in turn relates to the 32 piles
initially reported as damaged, as well as the piles in grid 7/A. The exhibit
was prepared before Hola discovered that the piles in grids 8/B and 6/A were
damaged. Consequently, I find that the first plaintiffs are also liable for
the piles in grids 8/B and 6/A. I accept the structural engineer’s testimony
that those piles were defective, but that the defects were not discovered
until much later, due to the first plaintiffs' submission of inaccurate pile
eccentricities plan to the structural engineer. Specifically, the structural
engineer had deposed (in para 32 of his affidavit):

> > Union Contractors Pte Ltd ("Union Contractors") who were the new
> contractor engaged to replace Hiap Tian Soon, subsequently discovered that
> in fact certain piles at Grid 7/A as well as Grid 8/B and Grid 6/A were
> defective. What was particularly disturbing to me was that in respect of
> Grid 8/B and Grid 6/A, Hiap Tian Soon had submitted inaccurate pile
> eccentricities plan to ASE Designtec showing that the pile eccentricities
> were within acceptable tolerance of 75mm when in actual fact the actual pile
> eccentricity had exceeded the tolerance of 75mm… Fortunately for Hola, these
> defects were noted by Union Contractors.........

72\. It was clear that the first plaintiffs generally conceded liability on
the damaged piles. Hence, they are liable not just for the 158 piles, but also
for the damaged piles in grids 8/B and 6/A.

_

The decision

_

73\. In conclusion, I award interlocutory judgment with costs, to the first
plaintiffs on their claim against Hola. I also award interlocutory judgment
with costs, on Hola’s counterclaim for the first plaintiffs' failure to
rectify the defective works and for the delay in the works. The first
plaintiffs' liability for non-rectification shall include the defective piles
in grids 8/B and 6/A, in addition to the 158 piles in respect of which they
have conceded liability. Assessment of the first plaintiffs' claim and Hola's
counterclaim shall be done by the Registrar and the costs of such assessment
shall be reserved to the Registrar. Unless and until both claim and
counterclaim have been assessed and quantified by the Registrar and the
figures set off to determine which party ultimately has to make payment, the
injunction against Hola restraining them from calling on the performance bond
(which can only be in the lesser amount of $799,500) will continue.

74\. Finally, as a matter of procedure, it was unnecessary for the second
plaintiff to have been joined as a party to these proceedings merely because
he was the guarantor of the performance bond issued on the first plaintiffs'
behalf by Lonpac Insurance Bhd.
