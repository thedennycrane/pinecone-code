THE CHARGE_

1\. The Accused is a 45 year old female. She has pleaded guilty to the
following amended charge :

> > "That you, **Yap Siew Luan**
>
> on the 29th day of October 2001, at or about 8.55 pm, in a motor car SBX
> 9744 C at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import into Singapore a
> controlled drug specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse
> of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, 1 packet of granular substance containing
> not less than 249.9 grammes of methamphetamine, without any authorisation
> under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby
> committed an offence under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185
> and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act."

2\. The original charge alleged importation of 386.1 grammes of
methamphetamine, which would have attracted the mandatory death penalty upon
conviction.

ANTECEDENTS

_

4\. The Accused has no previous conviction. The Prosecution makes no
submission on sentence.

_

  
MITIGATION

_

5\. The Accused is single and received formal education up to Secondary 4\.
She first worked as a bus driver and later as a night-shift taxi driver.

6\. In the course of her work as a taxi driver, she became acquainted with one
‘Alice’ (a pseudonym used as other investigations are still under way). Alice
became a regular customer, booking the Accused’s taxi two or three times a
week. Alice was generous, often paying the Accused more than the metered fare.
She also helped the Accused discharge her debts owed to moneylenders, incurred
because of her past gambling habit, and other legitimate debts.

7\. In late September or early October 2001, Alice invited the Accused to her
home and introduced her to the drug "Ice". After that first experience of drug
consumption, the Accused found that it perked her up. She then began to
consume "Ice" regularly with Alice after the taxi trips together. Alice never
asked for payment for the drug.

8\. Later, Alice needed taxi service in the daytime as well. The Accused could
not provide such as the taxi was hired by another taxi driver during the day.
Alice then suggested that the Accused rent a car in the Accused’s name. Alice
told her that was necessary as she (Alice) had irregular sleeping hours and
might not be able to return the car to the rental company on time if it were
in her name. The Accused agreed and a car was rented on several occasions
during which time, the Accused would ferry Alice around and be paid as if she
had provided taxi service. Alice would also pay the hire charges for the car.

9\. On 29 October 2001, Alice asked her to rent a car for two days. After
sending Alice from Tampines to Circuit Road, Alice told her she did not need
transport for the rest of the day. The Accused then drove alone into Johor for
dinner and to look up an old friend. She has done this before on a few other
occasions.

10\. While she was in Johor, she received a telephone call from Alice who told
her that she required the use of the rented car that evening. When the Accused
informed Alice that she was about to go to Taman Sentosa for dinner, Alice
told her to wait at Taman Sentosa for a man who would hand her a parcel to
bring back to Singapore for Alice.

11\. At the said location, a man approached the Accused, handed her a parcel
and left immediately. Upon examination of the parcel, she realized, to her
dismay, that it was a packet of the drug "Ice" which she could recognize as
she had been consuming it. She called Alice immediately and told her she was
not prepared to bring the parcel into Singapore for her. Alice lied to her
that the amount was not much and would not attract the death penalty. She also
said that if no one reported her to the authorities, she would not be found
out. Alice then claimed to be busy and told the Accused that she would call
her back later. She never did.

12\. After waiting for some time, the Accused tried calling Alice but her
handphone was apparently switched off. She contemplated throwing the parcel
away but did not because she felt indebted to Alice for her kindness. Further,
she was concerned that she would not be able to compensate Alice for the loss
of the parcel of "Ice". She continued unsuccessfully in her attempts to
contact Alice right up to the Caltex petrol station just before the Johor
Immigration Checkpoint. Deciding at that stage that she had no choice but to
take the risk for Alice, trusting her words that the amount was not large, she
returned to Singapore in the rented car with the parcel.

13\. This was the only time the Accused brought controlled drugs into
Singapore. No reward was promised to her by Alice for doing so. Her sense of
loyalty and gratitude had been taken advantage of by Alice. She confessed
readily to the offence when confronted and has co-operated fully with the CNB
in its investigations. She is also deeply remorseful.

THE DECISION OF THE COURT

_

14\. Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act ("MDA") provides that "except as
authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to import into or
export from Singapore a controlled drug". There is no definition of "import"
in the MDA. However, section 2 (1) of the Interpretation Act defines "import"
as "to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air". There
is no doubt that the Accused did "import" the said drug into Singapore by
bringing it in by land.

15\. Unauthorised import or export of methamphetamine under section 7 MDA is
punishable in the same way as unauthorised traffic in the same drug under
section 5 MDA where the amount involved is not less than 167 grammes. The
punishment provided by section 33 MDA read with the Second Schedule is as
follows :

> > "Unauthorised import or export of methamphetamine where the quantity is – |   
>> ---|---  
>> (a) not less than 167 grammes and not more than 250 grammes | Maximum 30 years or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes  
>> | Minimum 20 years And 15 strokes  
>> (b) more than 250 grammes | Death."  
  
It can be seen that the charge here was amended to bring the amount of
methamphetamine involved to just below the level which would have triggered
the mandatory death penalty.

16\. As stated by Yong Pung How CJ in _**Ooi Joo Keong v PP[1997] 2 SLR 68
**_at paragraph 14 of the judgment there, Class A drugs may be described as
the most dangerous category of drugs and methamphetamine is a Class A drug.

17\. A person who knowingly handles controlled drugs, knowing the nature of
the drugs, cannot excuse himself/herself with the plea that someone, however
trustworthy, has assured him/her that the drugs were of a lower quantity or
quality than it turned out to be.

18\. Since the Accused has no antecedents of any sort, in particular, those
related to drug offences, has pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and has
co-operated with the CNB from the time of her arrest, life imprisonment is not
appropriate for her. The punishment therefore lies somewhere between 20 and 30
years of imprisonment.

19\. On the other hand, the amount of methamphetamine involved is practically
at the very top end of the range for the offence. For this, I add two years to
the minimum of 20 years provided by the MDA.

20\. The Accused is also not liable to be caned the mandatory 15 strokes by
virtue of section 231(a) Criminal Procedure Code which provides that women
shall not be punishable with caning. I therefore add another two years to the
imprisonment term because of this exemption from the otherwise mandatory
corporal punishment.

21\. The imprisonment term is deemed to have commenced from the date of her
arrest on 29 October 2001. Accordingly, I sentence the Accused to undergo 24
years imprisonment with effect from 29 October 2001.
