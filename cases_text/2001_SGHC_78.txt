Prosecution evidence

_**

3 The prosecutions evidence against all three accused comprised in the main in
three segments, ie (a) the evidence of Raymond Quattlander (PW-3) (Ray), an
undercover agent attached to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) who
spearheaded a sting operation resulting in the arrest of all three accused
persons. [In relation to this segment the prosecution produced several audio
and video-tapes and their transcripts, recording the conversation between Ray,
the first accused and second accused on 6 April 2000 in connection with the
drug deal as well as the delivery of two suitcases (exhs P-52 and P-53) by the
first accused where the offending drugs were concealed);] (b) an agreed
statement of facts substantially gleaned from the preliminary inquiry
statements of some 39 witnesses, most of whom were involved in the
surveillance and the arrest of the accused persons; and (c) the evidence of
the investigating officer as well as an Urdu language interpreter who assisted
the investigating officer in recording statements from the accused persons.

4 Insofar as is material, the evidence of Ray could be summarised as follows.

5 Ray had been a special agent in the employ of the DEA in New York City, New
York, USA. Sometime in June 1999, he was assigned to act in an undercover
operation for negotiating the purchase of a quantity of heroin from the first
and second accused. In the event, contact was made by the DEA with them and
soon Ray left New York for Singapore for the drug transaction. Although other
venues were suggested by Ray to them to conduct the anticipated deal,
Singapore was chosen by the first and second accused. Consequently, on 5 April
2000 he set out for Singapore to assist the DEA Singapore country office in
collaboration with Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) in this joint
operation.

6 Rays role in this operation was to feign as the head of a major
international heroin syndicate based in New York. His arrangement was to
purchase two kilograms of heroin (No. 4) for US$120,000 in cash and another 3
kilograms on consignment.

7 After Rays arrival in Singapore on 6 April 2000, the first accused who was
by then in Singapore contacted him. Later, the first and second accused met
Ray at about 5.00pm on 6 April 2000 at River View Hotel, Singapore. Another
DEA Special Agent, Kimberley Elliot (Elliot) pretending to be the woman friend
of Ray was also present. Ray, at this point of time was fully wired and had a
concealed micro-audio device on him to record the conversation between him and
others. Then as Ray, Elliot, the first accused and the second accused were
seated at a table at the ground level caf, Ray opened a small bag which was
kept inside a backpack held by Elliot and showed briefly to the first and
second accused the wad of US currencies amounting to US$120,000 stacked inside
the bag. Soon Elliot departed from the caf.

8 At about 5.10pm, Ray invited the two of them to his room at River View Hotel
to discuss business in private. They all then trooped into Rays room where
they engaged themselves in a long and rambling discourse on the proposed sale
of 5 kilograms of heroin by the two accused to Ray. Their entire conversation
punctuated by two intervals ie from 5.10pm to 5.50pm (between the two accused
and Ray), from 10.10pm to 10.30pm (between the first accused and Ray) and
later from 10.48pm to 11.34pm (between the first accused and Ray) was captured
by a secret video recording device installed in Rays hotel room as well as by
an audio device concealed within the clothes worn by Ray. The conversations
thus taped both audio and video - were replayed in court. The transcripts of
the relevant portions of the tapes would be referred to later in this grounds.

9 According to Ray, whilst all three were in his hotel room, he was told by
them that the heroin to be supplied to him were concealed in suitcases in an
extremely sophisticated manner. He was warned that once the heroin was exposed
for inspection, it would be impossible for the luggage in which the drugs were
hidden to be restored to its original state. Ray persisted. In the end, it was
agreed that Ray would take delivery of 5 kilograms of heroin (although the
original plan was for only 2 kilograms) and the price to be paid was
US$300,000 US$120,000 initially and the balance to be remitted later. It was
also agreed between them that the heroin to be sold would be shown to Ray
later that evening. According to Ray, his two visitors discussed the sale of 5
kilograms of heroin to Ray in earnest.

10 Soon, both the first and the second accused departed the hotel room at
about 5.53pm. Later that evening at about 8.02pm, the first accused returned
to see Ray in his room without any suitcases. He presently informed Ray that
he had brought with him a sample for testing. In the event, the sample was
tested and it was found to be heroin. All the same, Ray made it clear to the
first accused that the latter should return with the suitcases that contained
heroin to conclude their business. The first accused who left Ray at about
8.11pm returned later at about 10.09pm with two suitcases.

11 The first accused then attempted to open the suitcases but they were found
locked and he had no keys with him to open them. As a result after making a
telephone call to someone (who was later identified the third accused) he left
Rays room briefly to obtain the keys. The arrangement was that the third
accused would bring the keys to the suitcases to the hotel and hand them to
the first accused at the hotel lobby.

12 At about 10.45pm, the third accused made his appearance and after giving a
bunch of keys to the first accused left the place by the same taxi.

13 Later at about 10.48pm, the first accused and Ray returned to Rays room.
The suitcases that were brought were opened. Ray found them to be empty but
emitting an odour of mothballs. The first accused pointed to the sides of the
suitcases and stated that the heroin was concealed along the walls of the
suitcases. Both of them, in the event, tried to locate it. Ray told the first
accused to cut open the lining of the suitcases which the latter did but was
not able to locate any drugs. Consequently, the first accused called the
second accused using Rays mobile phone to inquire the whereabouts of the
heroin.

14 Whilst the first accused was waiting for the second accused to come up with
an answer, he told Ray that one of the suitcases contained about 1,300 grams
of heroin and the other about 3,200 grams.

15 A short while later, Rays telephone rang. Ray who first answered the phone
passed it to the first accused. After speaking to the second accused, the
first accused conveyed to Ray that the drugs were compressed against the walls
of both suitcases. The first accused and Ray then scraped the walls of the
suitcases and discovered powder - flakes along the suitcase walls. Ray tested
the powder for heroin and it proved positive. Thereafter, the suitcases were
closed. Ray directed the first accused to pick up the suitcases and accompany
him to the lobby, stating that upon the first accused handing over the
suitcases to his courier (referring to Elliot) he would receive payment.

16 At about 11.34pm the first accused and Ray left the hotel room for the
hotel lobby; the first accused was carrying both the suitcases. Once in the
lobby, Ray left him after advising him to wait at the lobby for Elliot. Ray
had with him the micro-audio recording device which was employed to record
Rays conversation with the first and the second accused that evening.

17 On 7 April 2000, Ray handed over to one Todd Davidson of the US Embassy in
Singapore, the audio-cassettes which recorded the conversations alluded to. It
is pertinent to add here that Agent Elliot substantially corroborated the
evidence of Ray in relation to the meeting at the lobby, prior to Ray and the
two accused left for a discussion in Rays room.

18 The next segment of the prosecution evidence was contained in a statement
of agreed facts submitted in accordance with s 376(1) of the CPC (Cap 68) by
the prosecution and counsel for all the accused. The said statement sketched
out the events which transpired on 6 April 2000, the movement and interaction
between the accused persons including the third accused, the seizure of
exhibits, the raid conducted at the respective rooms of the accused persons,
their medical examination, scientific analysis of the drugs seized, the
setting up of audio-visual device at the River View Hotel which captured the
conversation between Ray, the first accused and the second accused live and a
few other details. Insofar as is material the said statement of agreed facts

>
> The above facts are not disputed and are agreed upon between the Prosecution
> and Defence pursuant to section 376(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap
> 68).

19 The next segment pertained to the evidence of the investigating officer and
the Urdu language interpreter who assisted him in recording statements from
the accused persons.

20 ASP Fan, the investigating officer in this case testified that at about
11.20pm on 6 April 2000 he took custody of the third accused (who was arrested
at about 10.50pm by a team of CNB Officers). At about 12.05am on 7 April 2000,
he took custody of the first accused who was arrested at about 11.40pm on 6
April 2000 by another team of CNB operatives at River View Hotel Lobby with
two suitcases. At about 12.50am on 7 April 2000 he was given custody of the
second accused who was arrested by another team of CNB officers at about
12.25am that morning.

21 In the event, whilst all the three accused were present at the Major
Investigation Branch (MIB) of the CNB, ASP Fan chiselled the interior of both
suitcases and found in them a substantial amount of heroin. Later after taking
photographs of the suitcases and the heroin found therein, the investigating
officer weighed it. Subsequently, after the formalities in relation to the
raid of the accused persons hotel rooms, their urine tests and sending some of
them for medical examination had been completed, he secured the drugs in his
office cabinet.

22 ASP Fan added that in the course of his investigation, several statements
were recorded from the accused persons. Insofar as is relevant, the
prosecution sought to admit altogether three statements recorded from the
first accused, two recorded on 13 April 2000 and one on 15 April 2000. The
prosecution also sought to admit two statements from the third accused one
recorded on 10 April 2000 and the other on 11 April 2000. After being informed
that there was an objection on behalf of the first accused as to the
voluntariness of his three statements, a trial within a trial was conducted to
determine their admissibility. As far as the third accused was concerned,
there was an objection by his counsel only as to the voluntariness of his
second statement. As a result, a trial within a trial was also held to
determine the admissibility of the third accuseds second statement.

**_

Trial within a trial as respects the first accused

_**

23 The issue in this trial within a trial concerned three investigation
statements marked for identification as P-47, P-48 and P-49.

24 ASP Fan in his testimony asserted that neither before nor during the
recording of any of the statements the first accused was subjected to any form
of threat or inducement or promise for him to make the statements. ASP Fan
further testified that all the three statements recorded from the first
accused were given voluntarily by him.

25 The other prosecution witnesses Sgt Stanley Tan and S/S/Sgt Patrick Thng
Joo Seng in their evidence denied any knowledge of any deal for co-operation
between ASP Fan and the first accused. S/Sgt Patrick Thng was somewhat
ambivalent in regard to the time the first accused had lunch with ASP Fan. He
also retracted a segment of his earlier evidence where he had claimed that on
15 April 2000 he escorted the accused back to the lock-up (page 1058 of the
NE). His pocket book entries were also found to be incomplete (pages 1060 to
1063 of the NE).

26 The first accused in his evidence denied that the statements sought to be
admitted were given by him voluntarily. His evidence in the main can be
summarised as follows.

27 After his arrest at about 11.45pm on 6 April 2000, ASP Fan proceeded to
record from him a cautioned statement at about 6.20am on 7 April 2000.
However, when the charge preferred against him was read and explained to him
he realised that he was facing the consequences of a death penalty. As a
result, he became sick, started feeling dizzy, suffered a headache and could
not think properly. Presently, he made a statement to Insp Fan in the
following terms: I am not feeling well and my mind is not able to think. So I
cant talk now.

**_

The first statement P-47

_**

28 Consequently, on 13 April 2000 he was taken to ASP Fans room for the
purposes of recording a statement. No one else except ASP Fan and he were in
that room. At the outset, ASP Fan told him to make a statement. The first
accused replied: _I dont expecting (sic) any drugs_. ASP Fan then remarked
that they, meaning CNB, knew everything and they were watching and listening
to everything and that nobody would believe the first accuseds protestations.
Faced with this retort, the first accused asked ASP Fan how the latter could
help him. ASP Fans immediate response was that the first accused should give
the CNB a good statement and co-operate with them and if he did the first
accused would be offered a different charge, a lenient sentence and would not
have to suffer a death sentence. The first accused understood the words of ASP
Fan to mean that if he were to give a good statement to CNB, he would get a
lenient sentence and escape the death penalty.

29 Following the foregoing understanding, the first accused gave ASP Fan a
statement. Whilst the recording was in train, the first accused on his own
asked ASP Fan a few times about help to which ASP Fan replied: Give me a good
statement, I will help you. The first accused added that the co-operation
alluded to was in reference to devising a set-up for one Faribourg of Sweden
to be apprehended in Singapore. He reieterated that he gave a statement to ASP
Fan that evening because the latter promised to give him another charge to
avoid death penalty (page 1077 of the NE). The recording of the statement
(P-47) on this occasion ended at 5.25pm.

**_

The second statement P-48

_**

30 The first accused was taken again to the room of ASP Fan at 7.45pm on 13
April 2000 for the purposes of recording yet another statement. ASP Fan read
to the first accused what was taken from him earlier that evening.

31 The first accused didnt want it to be read back to him for he knew what was
in it. ASP Fan then asked the first accused to commence his second statement.
According to the first accused: I asked him the same thing about my health
(sic). He told me, you give a good statement, I help you (page 1079 of the
NE). The first accused added that ASP Fan then told him: I will give you a
different charge that wont get you death penalty. There then followed the
recording of the second statement. During this recording too, the first
accused asked ASP Fan to help him. The reply from ASP Fan was: You help me, I
help you. (page 1080 of the NE). During the recording of the second statement,
there was a coffee break. The atmosphere was friendly. The subject of the
accuseds help and co-operation in getting Faribourg of Sweden to visit
Singapore was raised again. After break, the recording continued in the same
vein as before.

**_

The third statement P-49

_**

32 On 15 April 2000 at about 11.45am, the first accused was again taken to the
room of ASP Fan. When ASP Fan tried to read to the first accused the
statements recorded by him earlier, the first accused did not want them to be
read. As a result, the previous statements were not read back to him.

33 At the commencement of this third statement (P-49) once again, the first
accused raised the same question _about [his] health_ (page 1085 of the NE).
He told ASP Fan: _I am giving you this statement, you promise me to help me_.
ASP Fan replied: _You give good statement, I will help you_. On this occasion,
ASP Fan did not tell him how he would help him but on the previous occasions,
he had already told him that he would arrange for a different charge to be
preferred against him so that the first accused would not get the death
sentence (page 1086 of the NE).

34 When the recording was in progress, the first accused asked ASP Fan again:
You will help me? ASP Fan responded: Yes Ill help you, you give me a good
statement, I will give you a different charge. (page 1088 of the NE). There
was a lunch break during the recording of the third statement. Whilst at lunch
he was seated with ASP Fan and S/S/Sgt Patrick Thng. ASP Fan and he were then
talking about Faribourg of Sweden. S/S/Sgt Patrick Thng and another officer by
name Stanley were close by. In essence, the first accused told ASP Fan he
could arrange for Faribourg to come to Singapore. He added that he made all
the statements sought to be admitted because there was a promise as well as an
inducement from ASP Fan to be lenient with him and a confirmation that he
would be given a lesser charge. He also said a number of days later he was
interviewed by one Kumar and one Naseer of the CNB concerning the said
Faribourg.

35 Kumar and Naseer asked him to repeat the statements made by the first
accused to ASP Fan. He gave them a statement and at the end of the meeting
they also told him that when you co-operate with us, we will write to Judge to
[be] lenient on you. (page 1100 of the NE).

36 S/Sgt Sukumar Balan and Cpl Nazir Ali Khan were called by the prosecution
as rebuttal witnesses. They in their evidence denied that any promise or
inducement of the nature alleged by the first accused was ever made by them to
him. They also denied any threats on their part. They confirmed however that
they interviewed the first accused to elicit intelligence.

Trial within a trial as respects the third accused P-51

_**

37 Following objection by counsel for the third accused that the second
statement (P-51) recorded from the third accused on 11 April 2000 was not
given by him voluntarily, a trial within a trial was held. There was however
no objection by the defence to the admissibility of a previous statement
(P-50) recorded from the third accused on 10 April 2000.

38 ASP Fan who recorded this particular statement with the assistance of an
Urdu interpreter Neaz Ahmad Khan testified that he recorded a statement from
the third accused on 11 April 2000 between 7.25pm and 11.15pm. ASP Fan
affirmed that the statement recorded from the third accused was given
voluntarily by him and that there was neither threat nor inducement nor any
promise given or made to the third accused either by him or by the interpreter
who assisted him either during or before the recording of the statement.

39 However, in cross-examination and not before, ASP Fan admitted confronting
the third accused during the process of recording. His field book also had the
entry: At 9.30pm confronted the accused that Nassim Khan could not have paid
his expenses for free After explanation, accused broke into tears and cried.
At about 9.45pm, accused requested for water and was given two mugs. (pages
1210 and 1211 of the NE).

40 Neaz Ahmad Khan, a part-time Urdu interpreter engaged by the CNB to assist
ASP Fan in the recording of statements from the third accused averred that
there was no threat, inducement or promise made to the accused either before
or during the recording of the statement. He said that the only persons
present during the recording were the accused, ASP Fan and himself.

41 The Urdu interpreters cross-examination however threw up a few significant
facets to the recording and the excerpts of which are reproduced below:

> (a) [ASP Fan] once raised his voice he shouted only once (page 1250 line 18
> of the NE)
>
> (b) [ASP Fan] raised his voice at the time when he said: Dont come and tell
> some other story, dont make up the story and tell me. (page 1251 line 3 of
> the NE)
>
> (c) [ASP Fan] asked again and again in different form. At one stage he
> shouted because hes taking time and he says, You dont make up the story
> (page 1251 lines 18 to 22)
>
> (d) [Naveed] didnt even understand. I told him whatever you say must tell
> the truth (page 1252 lines 5-7 of the NE).
>
> (e) And then at that instance he [Naveed] broke down He cried (page 1252
> lines 11-12 of the NE).
>
> (f) When [ASP Fan] raised his voice and shouted he looked angry or irritated
> (page 1253 line 9 of the NE).
>
> (g) [Naveed] was taking time. then suddenly he started to cry. I felt very
> uncomfortable when he started to cry. I told him --- as a Muslim brother,
> "If you believe hereafter, the life hereafter if you have done anything
> wrong" you might admit or you might tell the truth nobody forcing but you
> can decide yourself. (page 1258 lines 8 to 21 and page 1259 line 1 of the
> NE).
>
> (h) He cried really he cried (page 1261 lines 6-8 of the NE).
>
> (i) I [Neaz] [made] the whole environment very friendly Always talk about
> family (page 1261 lines 18-21 of the NE).

Evidence of the third accused at the trial within a trial

_**

42 The third accused testified at about 7.25pm on 11 April 2000, ASP Fan
started recoding a statement from him with the assistance of Neaz Ahmed Khan.
Insofar as is material the main aspects of his testimony can be summarised as
follows.

43 There were two breaks during the recording of the statement. Just after the
first break, he saw ASP Fan and the interpreter conferring amongst themselves.
When they eventually returned, the interpreter told him: Look you are seated
on a chair. You admit otherwise you will be taken to a torture room. At that
time, ASP Fan who was seated in front of him was shouting and banging the
table with his fist (page 1278 of the NE). He was frightened and started to
cry (page 1282 lines 9 to 15).

44 The third accused was very frightened. He was fearful because earlier on
there was an attempt to assault him whilst he was inside a vehicle just after
his arrest. The third accused added that at one stage in the course of the
recording, the interpreter told him: You admit. You made a mistake, you might
as well admit. You have travelled in the aeroplane. If the plane had crashed,
you would have died. God has given you an opportunity to admit, so before you
die you might as well admit. (page 1284 lines 15 to 18).

45 In sum, he said that he gave the statement because he was forced to do it.
He claimed that in fact all that he wanted to say was already stated by him to
ASP Fan previously on 10 April 2000.

46 During cross-examination, he added another fragment about what the
interpreter had told him (page 1310 lines 17 to 21 and page 1311 lines 1 to
3). It reads as follows:

> He said that on one occasion he was going to India to meet his father. In
> the train a man stole someones things and ran. [He] caught up with that man
> and I locked him up in the bathroom of the train. From inside the bathroom
> this man broke the window pane and tried to escape. The train was travelling
> fast and he fell out of the train. He died. That man never had the
> opportunity to ask for forgiveness. You are given an opportunity. So he was
> giving me such stories to frighten me.

47 It must be presently observed that the foregoing part was never put to the
interpreter by the defence when the latter was being cross-examined.

48 S/Sgt Subramaniam was called by the prosecution to rebut the third accuseds
allegation that there was an attempt to assault him by the CNB officers who
arrested him. The officer said that there was no attempt to threaten or
assault the third accused at any stage.

**_

Ruling on the admissibility of the statements made by the first accused

_**

49 There were lengthy submissions both by the counsel for the first accused as
well as the learned DPP on the admissibility or otherwise of the three
statements (P-47, P-48 and P-49) which were the subject matters of contention
during the trial within a trial. It was submitted by counsel for the first
accused that the first accused proffered those three statements because of the
inducement or promise made to him by ASP Fan that if the first accused were to
give a good statement, the capital charge he was facing would be altered to
one which did not attract the death penalty. Counsel urged the court to accept
the evidence of the first accused and reject the version of the prosecution.
Counsel for the first accused also highlighted the alleged co-operation to be
rendered by the first accused to set up a sting operation to entice the said
Faribourg out of Sweden into Singapore.

50 I need not replicate at any length the submissions made by the prosecution.
They are in print for all to see. Suffice it if I said that the prosecution
urged the court to reject the claims of the first accused that he was induced
into making the statements alluded to.

51 It is a settled principle of law that the burden is always on the
prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that confessional statements
recorded from the accused persons, be they plenary or non-plenary, are made
voluntarily without being vitiated by any elements of threat, inducement,
promise or oppression. By the law of England and the law applicable in
Singapore, a confession to be admissible, must be free and voluntary. Lord
Sumner in the well-known case of **_Ibrahim v King_** [1914] AC 599 said at
page 609:

> It has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law,
> that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless
> it is shown by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the
> sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or
> hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in aithority.

52 The foregoing principle was amplified by Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest in
**_DPP V Ping Lin_** [1976] AC 574. He commented at page 595D-E:

> was it as a result of something said or done by a person in authority that
> an accused was caused or led to make a statement: did he make it because he
> was caused to fear that he would be prejudiced if he did not or because he
> was caused to hope that he would have advantage if he did. The prosecution
> must show that the statement did not owe its origin to such a cause.

53 Having reviewed all the evidence, my finding is that the prosecution has
indeed proven that the three statements recorded from the first accused were
made voluntarily by him without any elements of threat, inducement, promise or
any form of oppressive conduct on the part of ASP Fan or any one in authority.
In my finding, it was the first accused who seemed to have initiated the
subject of co-operation perhaps hoping that such an endeavour on his part
would soften the prosecution to acceding to his plea for a lesser charge. In
my view, his claim that ASP Fan coerced him into giving him a so-called good
statement was a fabrication.

54 His repeated claims that ASP Fan promised him that his charge would be
reduced if he gave him a good statement, were distinctly marked by a great
deal of tentativeness and hesitation on his part. Although I found a few
slivers of equivocation in the evidence of ASP Fan as to the first accused
mentioning to him a character known as Faribourg and some ambivalent features
in the evidence of S/S/Sgt Thng, at the end, after considering all the
evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven that the statements
adverted to were made by the first accused voluntarily. Consequently I ruled
that they be admitted to evidence.

**_

Ruling on the admissibility of the statement made by the third accused

_**

55 The principles applicable and questions the court had to consider before
admitting the contested statements of the accused persons, stated in
**_Ibrahim v King_** and **_DPP v Ping Lin_**(_supra_)**__** need not be
restated here. The crucial point in the pronouncements of Lord Morris in
**_DPP v Ping Lin_** was not whether the person in authority had intended to
make an inducement or threat but whether the accused person perceived the
statements and actions of the person in authority as such. Another point which
had to be borne in mind is the principle: Voluntariness is not an issue to be
determined by reference to some hypothetical standard: it requires a careful
assessment of the effect of the actual circumstances of a case upon the will
of the particular accused (see **_Collins v Rex_** (1980) 31 ALR 257 at 307,
lines 30-45 per Brennan J).

56 In my evaluation, the admission by ASP Fan that he confronted the third
accused and the evidence of the interpreter about ASP Fan looking angry and
irritated, banging the table, raising his voice which made the third accused
to cry, asking the questions again and again and the suggestion by the
interpreter to the third accused that as a Muslim he should admit and tell the
truth, inevitably raised the spectre of oppression and gave rise to a real and
reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the statement.

57 In my finding the repeated questions by ASP Fan and the gratuitous
exhortations by the interpreter appeared to have actually operated in the mind
of the accused. In my determination, there was most clearly a substantial
degree of over-persuasion, undue insistence and importunity on the part of the
recording officer, compounded by an unwarranted intoning by the interpreter.
The repeated questioning by the recording officer and the manner in which he
seemed to have conducted the interview appeared to have propelled the
recording process into the realm of oppression alluded to by Chao Hick Tin JA
in **_Yeo Swee How v Public Prosecutor_** [1997] 2 SLR 390 at 400E-H where he
observed that cross-examination could render a statement inadmissible if it
amounted to oppression. The learned DPPs comment in his supplementary
submission that there may be occasions when the prosecutions own evidence per
se may indicate some element of involuntariness, was apt and applied to the
situation at hand squarely.

58 In my opinion, the prosecution had failed to satisfy me that the statement
recorded from the third accused on 11 April 2000 was given voluntarily. In the
result, I ruled that the said statement could not be admitted in evidence.

**_

Resumption of the main trial

_**

59 Following my rulings above, the three statements (marked P-47, P-48 and
P-49) recorded from the first accused were formally admitted in evidence. They
were too long to be entered upon here. It was sufficient if I said that in
those statements the first accused admitted his involvement in the drug deal
initially with one Lou and later with Ray; the involvement of his business
partner the second accused in the proposed transaction; the selection of
Singapore as the venue for the delivery of heroin by the parties; the
arrangement for a courier to send the drugs in suitcases; his as well as the
arrival of the second accused in Singapore; the meeting between Ray and
himself with the second accused at River View Hotel lobby and in Rays room;
the delivery of the two suitcases to Ray in the hotel room later; the
identification of drugs along the walls of the suitcases and his subsequent
arrest at the hotel lobby.

60 Insofar as is material, para 7 (in exh P-47) paras 9, 14 and 21 (in exh
P-48) and paras 30 and 31 (in exh P-49) require reproduction. They read as
follows:

> 7\. In January 2000, I sought help from my partner Afzal by asking him to
> find and send samples to Lou. Afzal is aware of my financial situation and
> also Lou asking me to do drugs as I discussed with him my personal problems.
> Afzal agreed to help but he also could not find anybody who would send the
> sample. Afzals heroin supplier asked for 30 per cent advance advance of the
> money. So we contacted Lou to ask him to come to Pakistan to check the
> sample and take the drugs from Pakistan. It is then that myself and Afzal
> got to know Ray. Sometime at the end of January 2000, Lou called me on my
> mobile and told me that he wanted to introduce me to his cousin Ray who is
> the main man and whom he works for. According to Lou, Ray has been in the
> business for a long time and has all along got his heroin from Mexico and
> Columbia. He also told me that Ray could be trusted and then he handed the
> conversation over to Ray. Ray told me that he did not want to go to Pakistan
> but suggested that I send the heroin to New York or get someone in New York
> who can deliver it to him.
>
> 9\. My conversation with Lou about the heroin sample continued almost every
> day and I also understand from Lou that Ray suggested that I meet them in
> either Singapore or anyway in Europe. I was also told that it could not be
> in Pakistan as Ray did not want to go there. Neither could the meeting be in
> USA as I would not be able to get a visa. Through Afzal, I asked the heroin
> supplier to either do the transaction in Singapore or Europe. I was then
> informed by Afzal that according to the heroin supplier, the drug courier
> could not get a visa to Europe. Therefore, it has to be done in Singapore
> initially, the drug deal was to be done in Paris. However, the heroin
> courier could not get a visa for Paris and the supplier did not want to do
> it in other parts of Europe. It was sometime in February 2000 when we
> finally agreed on the place. At that time, Lou told me that Ray would get a
> new mobile number in Singapore, one different from the number 1-917-971-5360
> that was given to me previously (Recorders note: Accused was asked about
> Rays mobile number and he retrieved it from his address book as
> 1-917-971-5360).
>
> 14\. On 2 Apr 2000, Afzal informed me that the courier would be going to
> Singapore on 3 Apr from Lahore, passing through Karachi. The supplier would
> fax a copy of his passport photo so that I could watch him while he goes
> through the Customs. He then asked me to change my flight to Singapore
> Airlines, the same as the courier. It was only at that time when he told me
> that instead of 2 jackets, there would be 5 and they would be going in
> suitcases. I asked him how would the money be done and he asked me to talk
> to Lou. Immediately, I called Lou and told him of the change. He was
> surprised and asked me to talk to Ray. An hour later, Lou called me back and
> said that the US$120,000/- has already been packed. There would not be a
> problem at all with the rest but the balance money would be sent to Pakistan
> by Lous girlfriend named Liz only after the goods reach New York and they
> had seen it. After that, Afzal asked me for a guarantee as he was worried
> that his suppliers would kill him if the balance money were not paid.
>
> 21\. Ray then asked Afzal and myself to go to his Room 1711 where he started
> talking about the business. He said that we had agreed on 2 for US$120,000/-
> and the remaining 3 to be at US$50,000/- each. I asked how he would pay us
> and Ray said that after checking the goods, he would make the payment
> through his girlfriend in 2 days time. Ray also asked where we want, in
> Pakistan or Singapore and Afzal replied in Singapore. Ray insisted to open
> the suitcase in Singapore but we did not agree as the arrangement was for
> him to check in New York. We started an argument with Ray stating that he
> could not pay for something he did not see. Afzal and myself disagreed and
> no decision was made. We then left the room and took a taxi back to the
> Hotel Grand Central.
>
> 30\. I went back to the lobby to meet up with Ray and we both returned to
> his room. Ray asked me to open the suitcases and I opened one of them, only
> to find it empty. He started searching the suitcase and ripped open the
> inside using a knife but he could not find anything. He then asked me to
> open the other suitcase and it is also empty. Ray started getting furious
> again and said that I am cheating him. He asked me to ask Afzal about how
> the heroin was hidden using his mobile. I called Afzal and he got furious
> that I called him at the hotel using Rays mobile. I told him that there was
> nothing in the suitcases and he sounded worried. He said that he would call
> the people in Pakistan. Afzal called into Rays mobile about 10 minutes later
> and asked him to look at the de-colouration at the corners of the suitcase.
> Afzal hung up the phone and I passed the message to Ray. Ray then tried
> breaking through the crust of both suitcases. He managed to break the crust
> only after some hard work and saw some powder inside. Ray started testing
> the powder found at every corner of the suitcases and told me that it is OK
> but that it may not be 5 kilograms. Ray told me that it may just be 2
> kilograms and he would pay me the US$120,000/-. He said that when he had
> checked that it is 5 kilograms in New York, he would send the rest of the
> money, which is US$50,000/- per kilogram through his girlfriend.
>
> 31\. After testing the heroin, Ray asked me to close the suitcases. I
> reminded him that there was a portion of the fabric of the suitcase still in
> the room. He told me that it was alright as he would take care of that. Ray
> then asked me to follow him and he would take me to his girlfriend. I did
> not carry the suitcases with me then but Ray asked me to pick up the
> suitcases and follow him. We then went to the hotel lobby and he told me to
> wait there for his girlfriend whom I am to hand over the suitcases to. She
> would also hand me the money. After that, Ray went off. A few minutes later,
> I was arrested by 5 to 6 people.

61 As regards the third accused, a statement which was recorded on 10 April
2000 by ASP Fan was tendered in evidence. This particular statement was not
subject to any trial within a trial and the court admitted it upon receiving
confirmation from counsel for the third accused that the said statement was
made voluntarily by the third accused. Insofar as is material the relevant
portions of this statement (exh P-50) are as follows:

> I am the above person and is also known as Koko to my relatives and friends.
>
> 2\. I am the youngest child in a family of four children. My parents have
> already passed away and I am staying alone in Lahore because my siblings are
> either all married or working overseas. In Lahore of Pakistan, I own a shop
> selling motor vehicle spare parts. I earn about US$70/- (4000 Rupees) per
> month through the business. Although I have only received till the 9th year
> of education, I could speak and understand broken English of which I have
> learnt from the television.
>
> 3\. On 6.4.2000 sometime after 10.00 p.m., I was arrested in a taxi along a
> road by about 8 to 10 plainclothes man. They identified themselves as
> policeman. I was then asked to come out of the taxi and handcuffed. A search
> was done on me but nothing was found. I was then asked to sit back into the
> taxi with 2 officers and they brought me to an unknown place where another
> group of about 4 officers took over me and brought me to the office where I
> am in now. I now know that it is an office for anti-narcotics.
>
> 4\. After I was brought to the anti-narcotics office, I was questioned by 2
> men in English but I told them that I do not understand English. Then,
> another officer came and spoke to me in simple Urdu. He asked me to whom did
> I give two bags to and also how many people were there in my group. I told
> him I do not know what he was talking about. I was then brought into another
> room and asked whether I know two other male persons there who were
> handcuffed. I told him I do not know them. When I entered the room, there
> were many officers there and I saw one suitcase being opened and there was
> some white substance that looked like stone beside it. Another suitcase was
> then opened in front of myself and the 2 other male persons and it looked
> clean, neat and empty. I did not notice how the inner layer of the suitcase
> was taken out. However, with the inner layer taken out, I saw white
> substance that looked like stone in it. All the white substance in the 2
> suitcases was then taken out and weighed in front of us and I was told that
> it was 5 kilograms of heroin.
>
> 5\. After the weighing of the heroin, I was brought by the same team of
> officers to my room at Supreme Hotel and my belongings in the room was taken
> away by the officers. Before I left the hotel, I paid for all my bills. I
> was then brought to another place where the officers took 6 bottles of my
> urine which I later put inside a box. The officers then brought me back to
> the anti-narcotics office and later I was brought to the lock-up.
>
> 6\. The next day after lunch, I was taken out of the lock-up and brought to
> the hospital for a medical check-up. After that, I was brought to a room in
> the anti-narcotics office and an office[r] read over to me the charge in
> English. It was interpreted by an Urdu speaking gentleman. A short statement
> was also recorded from me. After the statement, I was brought back to the
> hospital for another check-up after which I was sent to the lock-up.
>
> 7\. I am not a drug addict and I have never taken any drugs before.
>
> 8\. In 1998, Nashim Khan was released from prison and he came to visit me at
> my home in Lahore. He was there for 15 minutes. When he left, he gave me his
> telephone number for Karachi. I can recall the home number to be 021-272760
> and 021-2851074 and his mobile number to be 0300209088\. The country code of
> Pakistan is 92.3 days later, I called his house at Karachi from a public
> phone at Lahore just to say hello. I was informed by a female answering the
> phone that Nashim Khan is serving sentence in jail for a drug charge.
>
> 9\. Sometime in Dec 1999, Nashim Khan came to my home for 15 minutes. We
> chi-chat and he left. Then again on 15.3.2000, he came to my home in Lahore
> and offered me to go to Singapore. I agreed. He said that he will buy me a
> ticket and also give me some money. He also told me that he has 2 briefcases
> that I can use to carry my clothing.
>
> Adjourned for a break at 10.30 p.m.
>
> Resumed statement recording at 10.50 p.m.
>
> 10\. Since 25.3.2000 until 3.4.2000, Nashim Khan visited me almost every day
> and I went to the Bakhtawar Hotel where he resided in my town on 1.4.2000.
> At the hotel, I had wine with Nashim Khan and an unknown male was present.
> The unknown male spoke to Nashim Khan but I could not hear what they said as
> they spoke very softly. This same unknown male was later seen by me at the
> airport in Lahore. He was wearing a sky blue shirt and navy blue trousers.
> To me, he is a immigration officer and he has a name tag. However, I could
> not read the name in English. I recognised him but he pretended not to see
> me. I had easy access for my luggage and immigration checks at the airport.
> On 1.4.2000, I together with Nashim Khan also went to the travel agents
> office where he bought for me an air ticket from Pakistan to Singapore and
> back. After buying the ticket, he handed the ticket to me and I returned
> home.
>
> 11\. On 2.4.2000, a Sunday, I went to the hotel as my passport was with
> Nashim Khan. When I was at the hotel, Nashim Khan sent a photocopy of the
> first 2 pages my passport to an Karachi. I asked him why and he told me that
> he is sending to a friend whom will help me in Singapore.
>
> 12\. On 3.4.2000 at about 4.00 p.m. (local time), I went to the hotel
> carrying my clothing in a plastic bag. At the hotel, Nashim Khan opened 2
> suitcases which were empty and put my clothing into them. We then left for
> Lahore airport by taxi. He paid the taxi fare and I would like to say that
> all the way from the hotel to airport, he carried the 2 suitcases and I
> never had the chance to hold them. I then checked in the suitcases and have
> only my jacket and passport with me. The plane that I took was Singapore
> Airlines SQ 418. I was at seat number 39A.
>
> 13\. At the Lahore airport, Nashim Khan told me to check into either Supreme
> Hotel or Musthafa Hotel when I reach Singapore. He also told me to call him
> on his mobile in Karachi when I reach the hotel so that his people could
> meet me at the hotel. He also gave me US$500/- to spend.
>
> 14\. I boarded the plane in Lahore at about 6.10 p.m. (local time) and it
> took off at about 7.00 p.m. (local time). I reached Karachi at about 8.40
> p.m. (local time) and I stayed on board the plane. At about 9.30 p.m. (local
> time), the plane took off again and I reached Singapore in the morning on
> 4.4.2000.
>
> 15\. After I come out from the plane, I approached the Immigration and
> filled up an immigration card with some help from another passenger. After I
> cleared the Customs, I collected the 2 suitcases and left the airport on a
> taxi. I told the taxi driver to go to Supreme Hotel where I checked into
> Room 207. In the room I called Nashim Khan to inform him that I am already
> at Supreme Hotel. He told me that his man known as Ash will come to me and I

62 As stated by me earlier, the prosecution case was to a large extent hinged
on the audio-visual tape recordings made secretly at the River View Hotel
bedroom where the first and second accused met with Ray. All the video-tapes
were played during the proceedings and the transcripts thereof were also
tendered and admitted in evidence without objection. On the face of video
presentation and the transcripts, it appeared that the first and the second
accused were actively discussing the sale of heroin to Ray. Insofar as is
material a few segments as appear in pages 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 25, 35,
37, 71 and 72 are reproduced below:

63 Before closing its case, the prosecution offered 32 witnesses to the
defence but the offer was declined by counsel for the accused persons.

Ruling at the close of the prosecutions case

_**

64 At the close of the prosecution, counsel for the accused persons did not
make any submission of no case to answer. The prosecution for its part
submitted that a prima facie case had been made out against each accused on
the respective charges each individual faced. Having considered all the
evidence thus far and having regard to the principles enunciated in **_Haw Tua
Tau v PP_**[1981] 2 MLJ 49 (PC), I was satisfied that the prosecution had made
out a case against each accused person on the charge each was facing, which if
unrebutted would warrant his conviction. Consequently I called upon each of
them to enter upon his defence and explained to each of them the courses open
to them. All the accused in the event, after conferring with their respective
counsel elected to give evidence on affirmation and in their own defence.

Evidence of the first accused

_**

65 The evidence of the first accused in his defence can be stated as follows.

66 He is a Pakistani National born in Bahrain on 3 June 1947. He was for
sometime doing business in London but having been unsuccessful in his venture
he returned to Pakistan sometime in May 1999 and shortly thereafter joined the
second accused in a leather and leather garment business.

67 He became acquainted with one American by name Lou whilst the first accused
was in the United States about ten years previously. Lou who used to be in
touch with the first accused contacted him in Pakistan sometime during the
third week of May 1999. Lou told him that he had just opened a leather goods
shop in New York City and asked the first accused for some leather jacket
samples to show his customers.

68 In the event, the first accused arranged for such samples to be sent over
to Lou in New York. Although eight leather jacket samples were sent to Lou for
which Lou was obliged to pay him US$1,000, no payments were forthcoming.
Curiously though, Lou had for some inexplicable reasons approached the first
accuseds brother-in-law who was in the United States and asked him for drugs.
Following a protest from his brother-in-law on Lous audacity, the first
accused sent a fax to Lou questioning him why he should mention drugs to his
brother-in-law when they were engaged in the leather garment business. Lou
shot back that the leather business was just a business front. The first
accused didnt quite comprehend what Lou meant. Since then he tried to avoid
calls from Lou. However, sometime in October 1999, the first accused was in
dire straits. He needed money. So on one occasion when Lou called him he asked
Lou for US$2,000; $1,000 for the jackets sent earlier and the other $1,000 as
a loan.

69 Lous immediate response to the first accused was: Do drugs. Lou wanted him
to send drugs to New York through mail. The first accused did not agree. He
rejected the proposal. Lou was unyielding; he told the first accused that he
would make him rich and advised him not to lose the opportunity. Exchanges of
this nature continued over a span of two months.

70 Later on sometime in October 1999, Lou telephoned the first accused in his
office. As he was not in, his partner the second accused answered the call.
Subsequently, the first accused briefed the second accused that Lou had a
leather shop in New York and that Lou was pushing him to do drugs. The second
accused did not say anything.

71 Noting that Lou had neither paid for the leather jackets nor extended any
financial help to him, the first accused decided to cheat Lou (page 1728 line
1). He realised that Lou, a rich man was very desperate for drugs. The first
accused wanted Lous money with a view to alleviating his present financial
difficulties. He was indebted at that stage in the region of about US$60,000
altogether. The first accused told the second accused of his plan to cheat
Lou.

72 Subsequently, when Lou called him the next time, the first accused who was
in need of funds [falsely] promised to send him drugs. They then started
discussing the price. Lou told the first accused that if the first accused
were to deliver to Lou in New York one jacket (meaning one kilogram of heroin)
the price payable was US$70,000. The price would be different if delivery was
effected outside the United States.

73 Lou, however, was unwilling to travel to Pakistan for the drugs. He told
the first accused that it was risky to carry a large sum of money to Pakistan.
Lou insisted that the drugs be sent to New York by mail or by courier. The
first accused intimated to Lou that if he wanted delivery in New York, Lou had
to make an advance payment of 30% for two jackets. The first accused said that
the expression jacket used by Lou meant one kilogram of heroin.

74 Since they had agreed on the price of US$70,000 per jacket, the first
accused requested Lou to remit to him US$42,000 being the advance payment of
30% for two jackets (US$70,000 x 2 3 = US$42,000). Lous reaction was that the
first accused should send him samples before he sent the first accused any
monies.

75 The first accused did not send Lou any samples although he told him he had
sent them through some greeting cards. About a fortnight later, Lou complained
to the first accused that he had yet to receive the samples. The first accused
gave him an excuse that the samples might have been intercepted by customs. In
the event, no samples were in fact sent. Lou was getting impatient and told
the first accused that his boss was of the opinion that the first accused was
wasting Lous time and that the first accused had no connections.

76 Lou called the first accused regularly and the first accused kept
maintaining to Lou that he had sent the samples requested. In the course of
one such conversation between them, the first accused told Lou: either come to
Pakistan or send 30 per cent advance (page 1744 of the NE). Lou replied that
he could not come to Pakistan and suggested instead that the first accused go
to Europe. The first accuseds reply was that he could not travel to Europe as
he had no visa to visit Europe.

77 In February 2000, Lou called the first accused again and this time he
informed the first accused that his boss was going to Singapore for a holiday
with his girlfriend. He enquired from the first accused whether the latter
could also make the trip to Singapore. The first accuseds response was that he
would call him in two days. Later he discussed this matter with his partner,
the second accused who was a party to the scam planned by the first accused to
cheat Lou.

78 In the event, the first accused sent an e-mail to Lou stating that they
could meet in Singapore. After the e-mail Lou called the first accused back
and told him that his cousin Ray was his boss. After this introduction, the
first accused and Ray began to communicate with each other. Ray advised the
first accused that he was going to Singapore with his girlfriend during the
first week of March 2000. Having agreed to this, the first accused arranged
with the second accused to get a courier who would pay his own expenses.
Consequently, it was decided by the first and the second accused that the
first accused should contact one of his friends in Islamabad known as Mumtaz
Ahmed Abbasi who was also known to the second accused. In the event, Mumtaz
Abbasi gave him information concerning the system in relation to
transportation of drugs. According to the first accused, the arrangement of a
courier and so-called system were for the purposes of gaining Lous confidence.

79 Once Singapore was identified as the venue to meet, the agreement between
him and the NY parties was that two jackets would be taken to Singapore and
the agreed price for them was US$120,000. Ray was initially not agreeable to
the price suggested but Lou managed to convince Ray that the price was all
right for the first transaction. The first accused intended to obtain the
US$120,000 from Lou according to the scam he had planned but in truth he was
not going to bring the proposed two jackets (ie, two kilograms of heroin) to
Singapore. In relation to this scam, his agreement with the second accused and
the said Mumtaz Abbasi was that after expenses, he would get 40 per cent and
the other two 30 per cent each.

80 The trip planned by Ray to Singapore in March 2000 was postponed by two
weeks. The reason given by him was that as President Clinton was visiting
Pakistan, the security would be tight and there would be problems in taking
out the money. The trip was again postponed for a further two-week period
because of the intervening Muslim religious festival of Eid. Eventually, it
was agreed they meet in Singapore on 3 April 2000. By this time, the agreement
in place was that upon delivery of the two jackets, a sum of US$120,000 would
be paid in cash to the first accused. Shortly thereafter, Lou called the first
accused once again to tell him that Rays girlfriend would be going to
Singapore with the money on 3 April 2000 and Ray would arrive later. It was
agreed between Lou and the first accused that only a sample of the heroin
would be inspected and there would not be any inspection of the jackets in
Singapore.

81 Whilst the first accused was thus negotiating with Ray and Lou, Mumtaz
Abbasi was trying to arrange for a courier. The day before he left for
Singapore, the first accused was sent a fax containing the copy of the
passport of the courier. It was also stated in the fax that the courier was
going to Singapore with only one suitcase and the first accused had to give
him US$3,000 to $4,000 for the couriers expenses. In the event, the first
accused flew to Singapore from Karachi, Pakistan and arrived in Singapore on 4
April 2000 and checked into Broadway Hotel at Serangoon Road, Singapore.

82 After his arrival, the first accused contacted the second accused and gave
him the name and telephone number of the hotel he had checked in. He also
called Lou in New York. The first accused was advised by Lou that Ray would be
arriving in Singapore the next day ie, on 5 April 2000\. Lou also described
the appearance of Rays girlfriend.

83 On 4 April 2000, the second accused called back the first accused and told
him that the courier had arrived in Singapore and was staying at Supreme
Hotel.

84 On 5 April 2000 the first accused moved out of Broadway Hotel and checked
into Starlet Hotel. Again, he called the second accused and gave him the name
and telephone number of his present address. Lou was also advised of the
transfer. At about 5.00pm on 5 April 2000 he met the courier, the third
accused near Supreme Hotel. When he met the third accused he came to realise
that there were two suitcases instead of one. He was surprised. The third
accused informed him that someone had given him two suitcases at the Lahore
Airport and instructed him to deliver them to one Hash in Singapore. The first
accused knew that Mumtaz Abbasi referred to him as Hash. The first accused
after informing the third accused that he would take over the suitcases in a
few days, left the place.

85 On 6 April 2000 the first accused learnt from Lou that Ray had arrived in
Singapore. Later that morning when he returned to the hotel after shopping,
there was a message for him from Ray to contact him at 11.00am on 6 April
2000. Ray had left his mobile phone number in the voicemail. A few moments
later he received a call from the second accused stating that he was also in
Singapore and staying at Grand Central Hotel. According to the first accused,
the second accused had arrived in Singapore earlier than expected. He was to
arrive only after the first accused had received the monies.

86 Soon, the first accused went to the second accuseds hotel to meet him where
they talked about the scam: to give Ray the suitcases; to tell him that the
drugs were in the suitcases; test only the samples; not to open the suitcases;
take Rays money and leave Singapore.

87 Before the first accused met the second accused, the first accused had
called earlier. Ray had told him then to call him at 4.00pm that day as he had
to meet someone. Later at about 4.00pm he called Ray on his mobile phone and
consequently an appointment was made to meet Ray at 5.00pm that day.

88 At about 5.00pm, the first and the second accused met Ray at the lobby of
the River View Hotel. A woman who looked like a Chinese (Elliot) was there.
The first accused was taken aback by her appearance since he was earlier
informed by Lou that Rays girlfriend was a tall blonde. However his suspicions
abated when Ray asked Elliot to hand over a bag to Ray and showed him the
monies inside. He believed at that time Ray had US$120,000 with him for
payment. Elliot left them shortly thereafter at the request of Ray.

89 Ray and the two accused presently proceeded to the room of Ray at the
hotel. At the room, Ray mentioned to the first accused that he was informed by
Lou that there were in fact five jackets (reference to five kilograms of
heroin) for collection. Although the first accused had previously never
discussed with Lou for more than two jackets, he was content to talk about
five jackets as he thought that this was good for the cheating (sic) scam
(page 1777 of the NE, line 19).

90 The first accused added that: Lou [was] paying for 2 jackets and 3 hes
getting on credit 3 jackets (page 1777 of the NE, lines 21 to 24).

91 As the conversation continued, Ray was intent on checking what the first
accused had brought from Pakistan but the two accused were not agreeable to
open the suitcases. They wanted only the samples to be tested. They did not
want the suitcases to be examined because the suitcases were not supposed to
contain anything.

92 The first accused confirmed that he had, prior to the commencement of the
trial, watched the video-tapes replayed in court and had read the transcripts
thereon. He added that in that meeting with Ray the second accused did most of
the talking. Finally, it was agreed that he and the second accused would
decide whether they would let Ray open the suitcase (sic) (pages 1779 to 1783
of the NE).

93 Shortly later, both the first and the second accused left Rays room for the
second accuseds hotel room. After their arrival, the first accused used the
public telephone at the lobby and complained to Lou about Rays insistence in
opening the suitcases. Lou told him that Ray was his boss and let him do what
he wanted. He advised the first accused not to blow the deal.

94 The first accused was concerned. He went to the second accuseds room and
discussed how to handle the situation. In the end, he suggested to the second
accused: We do this same cheating to Faribourg. (page 1787 of the NE). The
second accuseds reply was: We dont know how long Faribourg will [take to] come
to Singapore. We have only 14 days visa. (page 1789 of the NE). So they
decided to try Ray again. The upshot was the first accused returned to visit
Ray again in his room. This time the second accused did not accompany him.

95 When Ray saw the first accused without any suitcases he was upset. He was
mad at the first accused for calling Lou. The first accused explained to him
that it was agreed previously that the suitcase would not be opened in
Singapore. Ray retorted: I must see my stuff before I pay you. The first
accused then gave him a sample which he had brought with him. Ray was not
satisfied with the sample. The first accused told him to test the samples. In
the event, the sample was tested. Ray still asked him: OK where is the
suitcase? The first accused replied that he needed some money to give to the
courier so that the courier could deliver him the suitcase. Ray was adamant
and said: No, there is no money unless I see the suitcase (page 1793 of the
NE). The first accused returned to Grand Central Hotel and told the second
accused that Ray was very stubborn. The second accused then told him to show
Ray the suitcases.

96 The first accused thereafter telephoned the third accused at about 9.00pm
and asked him to meet the first accused at the McDonalds Restaurant at
Centrepoint at 9.30pm with the suitcases. The third accused obliged and
delivered the two suitcases to him and then asked for money. The first accused
after telling him that he would call him later left the place. As he was later
walking along the road looking for a taxi to return to see Ray, the second
accused went past him. About 20 minutes later, he managed to get a taxi and
arrived at River View Hotel. Ray was waiting for him at the lobby since the
first accused had telephoned him a little earlier. Ray got hold of one
suitcase and escorted him to his room.

97 Ray placed the suitcase he was carrying on the bed in the room. He tried to
open the suitcase but found it locked. Ray exclaimed: What is this? (page 1798
of the NE). The first accused then asked for the money. Ray replied that the
first accused had already seen the money and that he was trying to cheat him.
Ray looked very upset. At that time the first accused felt that the scam [was]
going to fail (page 1798, lines 16 to 17). The first accused did not want to
open the suitcases and told Ray that drugs were concealed inside and he did
not have to open them to see it. According to the first accused there was
nothing inside the suitcases and they were all empty (page 1799 of the NE).

98 At any rate the first accused did not have the keys to the suitcases. He
then called the third accused and asked for the keys. The third accused agreed
to bring the keys to River View Hotel. Consequently, Ray and himself went
downstairs to the lobby. The third accused arrived shortly, handed the keys to
him and departed.

99 After receiving the keys from the third accused, both of them returned to
Rays room. Both suitcases were opened but they were both empty. Ray then
queried the first accused as to the whereabouts of the drugs. The first
accused replied they were concealed inside. Thereafter, Ray gave a knife to
the first accused and asked him to look for the drugs inside the suitcases.
The first accused knew that there were no drugs in the suitcases. Both of
them, nonetheless, tried to locate the drugs but failed.

100 Ray then suggested to the first accused that he should call the second
accused to find out where the drugs were. The first accused then called the
second accused and told him that the scam had failed and that Ray had opened
both the suitcases. The second accused wanted to know what Ray wanted. The
first accused told him that Ray wanted to know where the paper was. Both he
and the second accused knew what the word paper meant. The word was coined by
them as part of the scam to mean drugs. The second accused replied that it was
becoming a mess. He said that he would think about it and call him back soon.
A few minutes later the second accused called him back and advised him what to
do. Consequently the first accused suggested to Ray to break the suitcases and
check everywhere. So Ray started again to dig the panelling of the suitcase
with his knife.

101 After about five or six minutes, he heard Ray say: Here it is. Since the
first accused did not expect anything inside the suitcases, he was shocked to
see the drugs (page 1810B of the NE, lines 11-15). At about this time, the
second accused called. The first accused expressed his surprise and told him:
Where is the drug coming from? He replied: It is impossible. I dont know. The
second accused added that it must be a mistake by Mumtaz Abbasi at the Lahore
Airport. I asked him: What do you mean by this? The second accused replied:
Just come and we talk later and then hung up the phone (page 1810C of the NE).

102 Ray appeared happy but the first accused was worried and was anxious to
escape from all this. His thinking then was not to take any money but to run
away from the place. After Ray had made a phone call saying: Honey we are
coming, both of them left the room. The first accused carried both the
suitcases at the request of Ray. He was told to hand over the suitcases to the
girl downstairs and she would give him the money.

103 The suitcases (exhs P-52 and P-53) were in the event taken by the first
accused to the hotel lobby. As he was trying to go out of the hotel with a
view to dumping the suitcases outside and get away from the place he was
arrested by CNB officers. He said that his plan was merely to cheat Ray. The
scam he conceived was to give an empty suitcase to Ray telling him that
everything was concealed inside employing a new system and to give him only a
sample of what was supposed to be inside the suitcases. To give credibility to
the scam, the feature of a courier was added.

104 He was extensively cross-examined by other defence counsel as well as the
DPP. Many an aspect of his cross-examination would be referred to if need be,
later in this grounds. However it would be sufficient if I said that he
maintained his stand that he came to Singapore in order to cheat Ray and
obtain monies from him under false pretences; he never intended to deliver any
drugs to Ray; and that he was greatly taken aback by the inexplicable presence
of heroin in the suitcases. He maintained that whatever statements given by
him to ASP Fan were merely for the purposes of giving him a good statement and
not otherwise. He also retracted some segments of his statements which need
not be detailed here.

Evidence of the second accused

_**

105 The evidence of the second accused insofar as is material is as follows.

106 He is a Pakistani National, born on 28 November 1950. For the past 10 to
12 years he had been supplying defence equipment to the Pakistani Army. He had
also been dealing in electronic goods, photostat machines, computer parts,
faxes and other goods. The firm which he owned was known as Management &
Marketing Services International. He arrived in Singapore on 6 April 2000 for
the main purpose of making inquiries in respect of some cabin compressor
parts.

107 He met the first accused about 10 to 12 years ago in New York for the
first time. They exchanged addresses and telephone numbers. In 1998, the first
accused paid a visit to his office to tell him that he was moving to London.

108 The next occasion they met was when the second accuseds father passed away
in June 1999. The first accused called on him to pay his condolences. Later,
at the end of June 1999, the first accused again paid him a visit. This time
the first accused told him that he was in leather garment business, had a
small factory and was looking for an office space. As the second accused had a
large office, he was prepared to accommodate the first accused. Eventually, it
was agreed between them that the first accused would bear 50 per cent of the
expenses incurred. However, after about five months, the second accused
admitted the first accused as his business partner in December 1999.

109 The first accused often came to the office bringing with him leather
purses, leather jackets and other leather goods. The first accused made use of
the fax and e-mail facilities available at the second accuseds office
premises.

110 In November 1999, about a month before both of them entered into a
partnership deed, the first accused told him that he was in the course of
securing a large order for leather jackets from overseas and would be
receiving an advance payment. In fact, the first accused had shown him orders
for the supply of leather jackets in large numbers from the US, UK and
Australia and told the second accused that he was going to receive a lot of
money. The second accused never suspected that the first accused was doing
anything irregular. In the main, the agreement between themselves was that
each would concentrate on his own area; the first accused would not transgress
into the second accuseds defence procurement business and the second accused
would not interfere with the leather business of the first accused.

111 The first accused never mentioned or talked about drugs to him at any
time. Before his arrival in Singapore, the second accused had spoken to Lou
only once. The first accused had sometime in January or February 2000 told him
that Lou was engaged in leather business in the US and that he was his buyer.

112 As he learnt that Lou was the first accuseds business partner, he had
spoken to Lou once and greeted him. He, however, had no communication with Ray
whilst in Pakistan. He did not suspect that the first accused had anything to
do with drugs; neither did he overhear any conversation between the first
accused and any person concerning drugs nor did he come across any documents
where there was any mention of drugs. The first accused never told him about
any drugs deal with Lou. If such a transaction was mentioned, he would have
thrown the first accused out of his office immediately.

113 The second accused had visited Singapore many times previously. He came
here mainly to procure electronic goods which were either unavailable in
Pakistan or were too expensive there.

114 When asked about the name Mumtaz Abbasi, the second accused said that
Mumtaz Abbasi was a friend of the first accused and the latter had sold his
house through him. Apart from that he knew nothing about Mumtaz Abbasi.

115 Reverting to Lou, the second accused said that the first accused mentioned
to him in February 2000 that he was going to meet Lou in Paris. However, the
first accused could not get a visa to go to Paris did not make the trip. Then
sometime in March 2000, the first accused told him that Lou was going to
Singapore and that the first accused would be meeting him there. However, the
planned trip did not materialise. Then at the end of March 2000, the first
accused told him that he would be going to Singapore to meet Lou; Lou was
going to make him some advance payments in return for some samples. The second
accused learnt from the first accused that the order was for the supply of
2,000 leather jackets.

116 The second accused informed the first accused that he had also been
intending to visit Singapore since he too had to make some inquiries there.
The first accused then told him that if the second accused were to be in
Singapore, the first accused would pay him a substantial sum to clear part of
his debts to the second accused. The first accused wanted the second accused
to help remit monies to Pakistan from Singapore as the first accused was
planning to stay in Singapore for a while.

117 By the end of March 2000, as he was unable to get the required spare parts
in Pakistan, the second accused decided to visit Singapore. He booked his
flight only two days before his arrival here. His main object was to buy cabin
compressor parts for supply to the Civil Aviation Authority, Karachi,
Pakistan. In this connection, he produced a list (marked exh D-6). He added
that except for the sums owed to him by the first accused, his firm was doing
financially well. The first accused was indebted to him in the sum of
Pakistani RS550,000 (Rs55 to US$1), out of which he had repaid only RS40,000.

118 The first accused arranged with the second accused that once the former
had reached Singapore, he would telephone him. On 4 April 2000, the first
accused indeed telephoned him saying that he had arrived in Singapore and
provided him with the telephone number of the hotel where he was staying. In
fact, before the first accused left for Singapore, the second accused had
given him the locations of a few hotels in Singapore. Later, the first accused
called him again to say that he had moved to another hotel by the name Starlet
Hotel and gave him its telephone number.

119 The second accused left Karachi on 5 April 2000 and arrived in Singapore
on 6 April 2000 at about 6.15am. The final tender for cabin compressors was to
be submitted by 9 April 2000\. By this time, he had to be back in Pakistan. If
he could not get the spare parts in Singapore he would have to leave for Hong
Kong to make enquiries. After his arrival at about 9.00am he called the first
accused. They then agreed to meet later and have lunch. The first accused in
the event called at his room later. Their conversation was general in nature
and about the defence equipment the second accused was trying to source. The
first accused on his own mentioned that his buyer was in Singapore and he was
meeting him later that day.

120 After lunch the first accused left the second accused briefly and when he
returned later requested the second accused to accompany him as he would be
collecting some advance payments from his buyer: The first accused mentioned
that two persons would be better than one.

121 The second accused agreed to accompany the first accused because the
latter had informed him that he wanted to show his buyer some leather samples
and persuade him to make the advance payment. The first accused represented to
him that the order which he had received was a substantial one valued at
US$300,000. Earlier whilst they were in Pakistan the second accused heard from
the first accused that the order was for the supply of between 4000 and 5000
leather jackets.

122 Following the request, the second accused accompanied the first accused to
meet the buyer. Later as both of them arrived at the lobby of River View
Hotel, the first accused introduced Ray to him. They all sat at a table. A
lady (subsequently identified as Elliot) was also with them at that time.

123 There was a discussion between Ray and the first accused at the table. He
overheard Ray telling the first accused that he was tired because his flight
was very long. The second accused interjected and said that he too was tired.
A short while later, the second accused noticed Ray receiving a bag from
Elliot and from that he removed a smaller bag from within, placed it in front
of the first accused, unzipped the bag briefly and zipped it back. The second
accused did not see what was inside the bag (page 2184 lines 8 to 17).
Whatever that was said by Ray when he was unzipping and zipping the bag was
not comprehended by the second accused due to Rays accent and the speed with
which he was talking; the second accused could catch only some of the words
(page 2185 of the NE).

124 After the bag was zipped back, it was handed back to Elliot by Ray and
soon Elliot left. Later at the invitation of Ray, both he and the first
accused proceeded to Rays hotel room.

125 Once they had entered the room, Ray showed some photographs to the first
accused. The second accused had only a brief glance at them.

126 The second accused said that whilst he was at Queenstown Remand Prison he
had seen the video recording of what transpired in the room; he had also seen
them replayed during the court proceedings and had read the transcripts. He
admitted that whilst in Rays room on that occasion he did most of the talking.

127 He explained that he went to Rays room because the first accused requested
him to do so as the latter was expecting some advance payment for the supply
of leather jackets. The second accused said: I did not have any idea in my
mind about drugs because Hashim had told me that he was to receive advance
money and I was talking in relation to that (page 2188, lines 16 to 22).

128 The second accused added that during their conversation he could not
understand some of the things which were said and he didnt understand the
English language (page 2189, line 10). At some stages when Ray was talking he
could not understand what he said and therefore asked the first accused in
Urdu what Ray was saying. At one stage, he even told the first accused in
Urdu: Where have you brought me? I shouldnt have been coming here. (page 2189
lines 17 to 21). But the first accused gestured to him to remain seated.

129 He maintained that throughout the entire conversation he never used the
word drugs. He did not know that the code word jacket meant heroin. He thought
the word Ki uttered by Ray was in reference to the word key (page 2191 of the
NE). As regards his own words: Its very, very, very, very nice most latest
system which is already known there appearing in the transcripts (page 8, line
9), he claimed that it was a reference to leather jackets (pages 2192 to 2193
of the NE). When he uttered the figure $300,000 and topmost quality during the
conversation, he was also referring to leather jackets and nothing else (page
2196 of the NE). He claimed that when he said that the things which are packed
they are really very highly, technically packed, and if you open them there ,
he was merely repeating what the first accused had told him about the jackets
earlier that they were technically packed and if he were to open the things,
then he would have difficulty in taking them back (page 2198 of the NE lines 1
to 8).

130 The second accused admitted receiving a telephone call from the first
accused and asking him about papers and things. But his explanation was that
when the first accused called him, he thought the first accused was referring
to a telephone number written by the first accused on a piece of paper
earlier. He did not however, understand what was meant by the expression
things. Therefore, when the first accused asked about the papers he simply
replied: the paper is with me. When the first accused asked him where are the
things, he thought that the first accused wanted the second accused to call
the telephone number written on the paper. On that assumption, the second
accused told the first accused that he would call the given number (page 2202
of the NE). As a result, the second accused called the telephone number
2851074 in Pakistan and spoke to one Naseem Khan or Naseem Ahmet and conveyed
to him that the first accused wanted to speak with him.

131 The second accused denied that he had told the first accused to break the
suitcases to find the drugs (page 2209 lines 9 to 16).

132 The second accused claimed that after the first accused and he left Rays
hotel room after their meeting, the second accused questioned the first
accused: Where did you take me to and what is the whole matter about and what
does your leather garment buyer want.? The first accuseds alleged reply was:
You will not understand all this. When the second accused heard this he told
the first accused that if that was the case, he would not meet Ray anymore and
that he would not get himself involved in any deals with him (page 2213 of the
NE lines 6 to 22).

133 The second accused claimed that after this he did not see the first
accused. Later that evening he was arrested in his room and was taken to the
CNB where he saw the first accused and later the third accused. He also saw
three CNB officers scraping the suitcases. He did not suspect anything at
first but when he was told that heroin had been found inside, he was shocked.

134 The second accused maintained that he did not know anything about the
suitcases, to whom they belonged or what was inside them. He also denied the
version given by the first accused in his testimony that there was a scam to
cheat the leather buyer and the second accused was aware of the scam. He said
that he did not know of any scam and he came to Singapore mainly to source for
compressor parts and would have taken the monies to Pakistan if the first
accused happened to receive an advance for his reported leather jacket orders
(pages 2233 and 2234 of the NE). He added that in the meeting with Ray in the
hotel room, he was not engaged in assisting the first accused to cheat Ray.

Evidence of the third accused

_**

135 The evidence of the third accused can be summarised as follows.

136 He is 30 years of age (born on 24 August 1970), single and a Pakistani
National. He had attended school for only three years and had been a salesman
in a spare-parts shop in Pakistan before his arrest on 6 April 2000.

137 He arrived in Singapore from Pakistan for the first time on 4 April 2000.
The purpose of his visit was primarily to hand over two suitcases to one Hash.
He also wanted to make use of the trip to buy some electrical goods for sale
back home and to ply some of the items textile material which were brought by
him. The suitcases were given to him in Pakistan by one Naseem Khan.

138 The third accused had been acquainted with Naseem Khan since 1997. He
first met him in 1997, later once in 1998, once in 1999 and three or four
times in 2000. Naseem Khan ran a poultry farm, a tent service for functions as
well as a business for people to make international telephone calls.

139 After his arrival in Singapore he learnt that Hash was Hashim, the first
accused. He did not know the second accused until he met him for the first
time at the CNB. The third accused had never heard of Mumtaz Abbasi.

140 As regards the two suitcases to be delivered to Hash in Singapore, Naseem
Khan made this request to the third accused on 25 March 2000 (page 2532 line
15 of the NE) although on 15 March 2000 (sic) Naseem Khan made an offer to
send the third accused to Singapore. The third accused thought Naseem Khan was
just pulling his leg. The third accused was overjoyed by the offer. He had
heard of Singapore and was excited at the prospect of doing sightseeing,
buying electrical appliances with a view to resale in Pakistan for a profit
and to take some wares and sell for gain in Singapore.

141 He met Naseem Khan again on 1 April 2000 when the latter called at his
house to obtain his passport in connection with the issuing of an airline
ticket. A seat was booked for him to leave Pakistan on 3 April 2000 and the
return was arranged for 10 April 2000. The third accused was told that a
photocopy of his passport pages would be faxed to Hash in Singapore.

142 After the purchase of the ticket, he met Naseem Khan on 2 April 2000 at a
hotel in Lahore. In his presence Naseem Khan faxed the copy of his passport to
Karachi and later returned the passport to the third accused.

143 The third accused was to leave Lahore for Singapore on 3 April 2000.
Following prior arrangement the third accused met Naseem Khan at his hotel at
about 3.00pm on 3 April 2000. Naseem Khan was to send him to the airport. The
third accused had with him his personal clothings and a few items which he
wanted to sell in Singapore. Those items included: ladies material, scarves,
shawls, purses, geometry boxes and a few other items. He had with him US$1,000
in cash and another sum of US$5000 given to him by Naseem Khan.

144 At the hotel room of Naseem Khan, there was another man whom the third
accused had never met before but this man left the place soon. The third
accused later saw him at the airport duty office when he was departing Lahore
for Singapore.

145 Naseem Khan opened the two suitcases which were with him in his room (exhs
P-52 and P-53), removed whatever that was inside except for one or two
mothballs and handed the suitcases to the third accused. The third accused
then placed all his items in the two empty bags and soon both of them left for
the airport in a taxi. He did not at that time suspect that there were any
drugs hidden in the suitcases. Before he left Lahore he was given the names of
two hotels in Singapore for him to stay: Mustaffa Hotel and Supreme Hotel.
Naseem Khan intimated to him that the two suitcases the third accused was
carrying had to be handed over to his friend Hash. Naseem Khan further told
him that if Hash were to volunteer and give him some money, he could accept
it. Naseem Khan told him that Hash might give him $500 to $1,000 but the third
accused on his part should not ask for any money.

146 He left Lahore by a Singapore Airlines flight at 7.00pm on 3 April 2000.
The plane stopped at Karachi for about 50 minutes on the way to Singapore.
Throughout the entire flight nobody approached him. The flight finally landed
in Singapore at about 6.00 to 6.30am on 4 April 2000\. He enlisted another
Pakistani National to fill up his disembarkation form. Having cleared
immigration and customs formalities he proceeded straight to Mustaffa Hotel at
Serangoon Road. As there were no rooms available at that hotel, he left for
Supreme Hotel and there he was allotted room number 207.

147 After breakfast, at about 9.30am on 4 April 2000 he telephoned Naseem Khan
by using a public telephone situated at or near Orchard Plaza and gave him his
whereabouts and the room number. Naseem Khan told him that his friend Hash
would go to the third accuseds hotel room to collect the bags from him.
Thereafter the third accused returned to his room and freshened up before
doing some window shopping. Just about this time, the telephone in his room
rang.

148 The caller spoke to him in English which he could not understand. The
caller who later identified him as Hash spoke to him in Urdu. Since the third
accused had indicated to the caller that he was planning to some sightseeing,
the caller said he would call him at 5.00pm that day. Nothing else was
discussed during this conversation.

149 The third accused later went window shopping and returned to his room at
about 4.00pm. At about 5.00pm the first accused telephoned and told him that
he would like to meet him. The third accused suggested that they meet in his
hotel room. The first accused did not agree and arranged to meet him outside
the hotel.

150 The third accused offered to take the suitcases for delivery to the first
accused but the latter told him that he only wanted to meet him and that he
would be able to recognise the third accused as he had a photocopy of his
passport. In the event, both met outside the hotel. After exchanging
pleasantries, the first accused told the third accused that he was busy for
the next one or two days and would come and collect the bags later. When the
third accused enquired from the first accused about places to have his meal,
the first accused pointed to the direction of the McDonalds Restaurant at
Centrepoint, Orchard Road. The third accused said that his first meeting with
the first accused was on 4 April 2000, the day of his arrival in Singapore.

151 On 5 April 2000, the first accused called him at about 11.00am and told
him that he might collect the bags either on that day or the next day. The
third accused requested him to call him before the first accused arrived.

152 On 6 April 2000, the morning was uneventful. Later at about 4.00pm, he
transferred some of the items which he had brought with him from Pakistan in a
plastic bag with a view to showing them to some shopkeepers. He managed to
sell two suiting materials to a Sikh shopkeeper for S$50 and purchased from
him a bag as he needed one to keep his belongings once he had handed over the
suitcases to the first accused. After telling the shopkeeper from whom he had
purchased the bag to keep it for him for a while, he boarded a bus and went to
the Mustaffa Department Store at Serangoon Road.

153 At about 9.15pm on 6 April 2000 he received a telephone call from the
first accused. He wanted to collect the suitcases. To a suggestion by the
third accused for the first accused to pick up the suitcases from the formers
hotel room, the first accused declined saying that he was having his food at
the McDonalds at Centrepoint with his friends and asked the third accused to
take the suitcases there. He told him that he would meet the third accused
near the staircase there. The third accused obliged. He took the two suitcases
and handed them to the first accused and enquired from him whether they were
the same bags he had left in Pakistan. The first accused after confirming that
those were indeed the bags, accepted them. Presently the third accused
returned to his hotel room.

154 About 45 minutes or so later, the telephone in the room of the third
accused rang. It was the first accused. The first accused told him that the
suitcases handed to him were locked and that the third accused had not handed
over the keys to them. The tone of the first accused was severe. The third
accused lost no time in apologising to the first accused for the oversight.
When the third accused suggested that the first accused collect the keys from
him, there was a sarcastic response from the first accused. The third accused
became frightened. He was afraid that the first accused might complain to
Naseem Khan. Presently, the third accused asked the first accused where he
should deliver the keys. The first accused spelt out for him the name of River
View Hotel. He promptly took a taxi and handed over the keys to the first
accused at the lobby and soon left the place by the same taxi. However, on his
way back to the hotel he was arrested by CNB officers at about 10.45pm on 6
April 2000.

155 He denied saying to the first accused whilst at the River View Hotel
entrance either the words: I wanted to see the buyer or the words Is he the
guy in reference to Ray.

156 After his arrest at about 8.20pm on 7 April 2000 a cautioned statement was
recorded by ASP Fan from him. The said statement (exh D-3) reads as follows:

> I am not guilty as charged. I came to Singapore for business and tour, not
> to do drug trafficking.
>
> I hope the authority will understand my position and let me out of the
> custody as soon as possible.
>
> I am an innocent person.

157 The third accused explained that the word business in his statement
referred to the sale of the wares he had brought from Pakistan and the
electrical goods he had intended to purchase for resale in Pakistan for
profit. He emphasised that he did not know or suspect that there were drugs
concealed in the suitcases which he was made to carry from Pakistan for
delivery to the first accused.

158 Insofar as the cross-examination of the third accused was concerned, a few
aspects concerning the dates mentioned by the third accused in his testimony
as well as his statements require highlighting.

159 According to the third accuseds evidence he met the first accused for the
first time on 4 April 2000 and later on 6 April 2000. There was no meeting on
5 April 2000.

160 When cross-examined, the third accused maintained that he had met the
third accused on 4 April 2000 and not on 5 April 2000 and the date 5.4.2000
appearing at para 16 of his statement was incorrect (pages 2729 and 2730 of
the NE).

161 The next aspect relates to the date Naseem Khan met the third accused at
Lahore and offered to send him to Singapore. The third accused said in his
testimony that it was on the 15 March 2000 (page 2657 of the NE). He also said
that the next occasion he met Naseem Khan was on 25 March 2000 (pages 2662 and
2663). However when it was pointed out to him that he entered Uganda on 11
March 2000 and returned to Pakistan only on 25 March 2000 (pages 2694 to 2696
of the NE), he said that the correct date of Naseem Khans first offer was on
25 March 2000 and not 15 March 2000. According to him the first occasion
Naseem Khan made him an offer to go to Singapore was on 25 March 2000 and the
second occasion he repeated the offer was on 1 April 2000 (page 2696 lines 19
to 23 and page 2697 lines 1 to 2).

162 It must be observed at this stage that the third accused did mention
before he was referred to his passport entries, that the first occasion he was
made the offer by Naseem Khan to visit Singapore was on the day of his return
from Uganda. In this regard the questions asked of him and the reply given by
him appearing at pages 2657 and 2658 of the NE bear reproduction:

> Q What else did both of you talk about in December 1999?
>
> A Nothing much, your Honour. All he asked was how I was and he left.
>
> Q Did he ask you to call him in Karachi?
>
> A No, your Honour.
>
> Q The next time that Nashim Khan came to see you, according to your

Final speeches and conclusions

_****

(a) _First accused_

**

164 The charge against the first accused was that on 6 April 2000 at River
View Hotel, Singapore, he trafficked in a controlled drug by having in his
possession for the purpose of trafficking about 5 kilograms of heroin in two
suitcases containing not less than 2,871.2g of diamorphine, an offence
punishable under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the
MDA.

165 Sections 5(1)(a) and 5(2) of the MDA read as follows:

> 5-(1) Except as authorised by this Act or the regulations, it shall be an
> offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person,
> whether or not that other person is in Singapore to -
>

>> (a) traffic in a controlled drug; or

>
> (2) For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of
> trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for
> the purpose of trafficking.

166 It was not in dispute that the drugs found in the two suitcases (P-52 and
P-53) carried by the first accused and seized at the scene of arrest contained
not less than the amount stated in the charge. The scientific evidence as to
analysis as well as the claim of evidence in relation thereto were also not
disputed by the defence.

167 The submission by counsel for the first accused, delaminated of all
excess, was simply this: That the first accused came to Singapore not to
traffic in any drugs but to execute a scam on Ray, by which Ray would be
induced to hand over a large sum of money on the pretext that the latter was
going to receive a suitcase containing heroin (which turned out to be two
suitcases) although there would not be any drugs in those suitcases.

168 Counsel for the first accused submitted (para 37 of the submission) that
the scam bottomed out and failed when the suitcases were opened and worse,
drugs were eventually found within. The first accused was shocked. As a result
the first accused was stunned speechless; he even needed a drink and in fact
was looking for an opportunity to leave the room. Later as the first accused
started to walk towards the entrance of River View Hotel, intending to get out
of the place quickly, he was stopped and arrested at the lobby by a few CNB
officers.

169 In my determination, the defence put forward by the first accused that he
came all the way to Singapore to deliver an empty suitcase to a drug buyer and
receive a substantial sum of money in return for the said empty suitcase
appeared to border on the ludicrous.

170 If he was indeed intending to deliver empty suitcase or suitcases, why
didnt he simply walk away soon after he and Ray were unable to locate the
whereabouts of the supposedly hidden (for that matter allegedly non-existing)
substance. Could he not have excused himself from Ray stating that he had to
return to his hotel to check with his business associate as to the whereabouts
of the drugs and use that occasion to vanish once and for all? At any rate,
why did he have to telephone the second accused and ask for instructions and
later convey to Ray that the drugs were stored on the inside ends of the
suitcases?

171 The first accused was seen twisting and turning in the witness box. Many
an answer by him was glib and tentative. Rays evidence that there was a
confirmed order for heroin could not be doubted. The first accused, for all to
see, was caught red-handed with the offending substance when he was at the
hotel to hand-deliver them to an undercover agent. All his actions and words
on the evening of 6 April 2000 were caught in the audio and video-recorders
put in place by the law enforcement agencies. His attempted defence that there
was never any intention on his part to deliver drugs to Ray was totally
decimated by the materialisation of nearly 5 kilos of heroin found in the
suitcases. Was it a pure miracle or an inexplicable preternatural phenomenon
that brought forth about 5 kilograms of heroin, the amount coincidentally
mentioned by the first accused before the sides of the suitcases were prised
open?

172 In my view the defence of the first accused was a hopeless and rickety
gambit, hastily assembled, ill-thought out, ill-prepared and ineptly presented
no reflection on counsel. The story narrated by him defied common sense and
reason; it was unreal, weird and entirely rid of substance.

173 The video-tapes played in court and the transcripts provided gave a clear
impression that the on-going negotiation at the hotel was not a mere sham but
a serious and sinister enterprise to deal in drugs then and in future.
Furthermore, it would be inconceivable that the empty suitcases to be
delivered in Singapore would soon turn out to be a storehouse for 5 kilograms
of heroin. The first accuseds story in my finding was nothing but a tissue of
lies. The sample of heroin he carried with him on that day further belied his
defence.

174 In coming to my conclusion, I did not have to rely on any of the
confessionals admitted in evidence by the prosecution. In my finding, the
prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the first accused was
not only in physical possession of the drugs but also had knowledge of the
existence of the drugs, the nature of the drugs found in the suitcases and
that he was in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking.

175 As submitted by the learned DPP, there was ample evidence to justify the
conclusion that the possession of drugs by the first accused was for the
purpose of trafficking: In this the following aspects were in my opinion
significant:

> (a) Ray talked to the first and second accused of Colombia and Bangkok and;
>
> (b) both the first and the second accused discussed with Ray the sale of the
> drugs to Ray including its price;
>
> (c) they discussed future sales;
>
> (d) the first accused provided a sample of heroin to Ray for testing;
>
> (e) the suitcases were hand-delivered by the first accused to Ray;
>
> (f) the money had been shown to the first accused earlier; and
>
> (g) the first accused was keen to exchange the suitcases for cash.

176 Reviewing the evidence in its totality, the inescapable conclusion was
that the first accused was in Singapore to traffic in heroin found in his
possession on 6 April 2000. If, as he claimed, the whole exercise was meant to
be a sham, he did not have to enlist the help of a third party (ie, Naseem
Khan) to arrange for the suitcases to be flown all the way from Lahore to
Singapore.

177 In the circumstances, after being satisfied that the prosecution had
proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the first accused had not
established his defence on balance of probabilities, I found him guilty as
charged and sentenced him to the only punishment prescribed under the law.

**

(b) _Second accused_

**

178 The second accused faced an amended charge that on 6 April 2000 at River
View Hotel, he engaged himself with the first accused in a conspiracy to
traffic in diamorphine and in pursuance of the conspiracy, offered to sell to
Ray about 5 kilograms of heroin containing not less than 2,871.2g of
diamorphine and he thereby abetted the commission of the offence of offering
to traffic in the drugs, an offence under s 5(1)(b) read with s 12 and
punishable under s 33 of the MDA.

179 The charge was amended on 19 January 2001 from one under s 5(1)(a) to one
under s 5(1)(b) of the MDA. In the result, an opportunity was afforded to the
second accused to recall and re-examine witnesses pursuant to s 167 of the CPC
but counsel for the second accused informed the court that it was unnecessary
since the amendment did not introduce any new element to the charge.

180 Section 5(1)(b) of the MDA provides:

> 5-(1) Except as authorised by this Act or the regulations, it shall be an
> offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person,
> whether or not that other person is in Singapore to -
>
> (b) offer to traffic in a controlled drug;

181 Section 12 of the MDA reads thus:

> Any person who abets the commission of or who attempts to commit or does any
> act preparatory to, or in furtherance of, the commission of any offence
> under this Act shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable on
> conviction to the punishment provided for that offence.

182 It would also be useful to remember that the word traffic appearing in the
MDA has been defined under s 2 of the Act to mean:

> (a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or
>
> (b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) [above].

183 As submitted by the prosecution that the prosecution had to prove the
following ingredients to bring home a conviction against the second accused:

> (1) That the second accused was engaged in a conspiracy with the first
> accused;
>
> (2) That as conspirators, both of them agreed to traffic in diamorphine, a
> controlled drug, this being the object of the said conspiracy.
>
> (3) That pursuant to this conspiracy, the second accused abetted the offence
> by offering to sell Ray 5 kilos of heroin containing not less than 2871.2g
> of heroin.

184 Before dealing with the submissions made in respect of the guilt or
innocence of the second accused, reference should be made to what the Court of
Appeal said in **_Vinit Sopon & Ors v Public Prosecutors_** [1994] 2 SLR 226,
where Yong Pung How CJ, in delivering the judgment of the Singapore Court of
Criminal Appeal, said at page 241E-G:

> The charge against the third appellant was one of abetment by conspiracy.
> Section 12 of the MDA provides that a person who abets the commission of any
> offence under the Act shall be liable on conviction to the punishment
> provided for that offence. Although abet is not defined in the MDA, it bears
> the same meaning as in s 107 of the Penal Code, by virtue of s 2 of the
> Interpretation Act (Cap 1), which states:
>

>> abet with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, has the same
meaning as in the Penal Code.

>
> Conspiracies under s 107(b) of the Penal Code are proved generally from
> inference of conduct as it is often difficult to have direct evidence of
> conspiracy. Even in a criminal case, it can be inferred from circumstantial
> or oral evidence. It may be proved by evidence of surrounding circumstances
> and the conduct of the accused both before and after the alleged commission
> of the crime.

185 In relation to abetment by conspiracy, in **_Lai Kam Loy & Ors v Public
Prosecutor_** [1994] 1 SLR 787, Yong Pung How CJ commented at 795:

> As for the second and third appellants, the charge against them was one of
> abetment of trafficking by conspiracy. The ingredients which the prosecution
> had to prove were the existence of a conspiracy to do an illegal act, with
> the result that the illegal act which was the object of the conspiracy was
> actually carried out. The latter ingredient was not in issue as the object
> of the conspiracy was the delivery of drugs which was effected by the first
> appellant. The question that arose was whether the second or the third
> appellant was party to the conspiracy to deliver the drugs. The essence of a
> conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take
> place in private such that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. A
> frequent method of proving a conspiracy is to show that the words and
> actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common
> object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have
> been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. We emphasize that these acts do
> not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but constitute evidence of the
> conspiracy.
>
> The question that a trial court must ask itself at the end of the trial was
> stated succintly by Huggins J in _R v Chau Sau-Tai_ , which is whether, in
> respect of each alleged conspirator, the court is satisfied that, on the
> evidence as a whole, he must have conspired with one or more of the others.

186 In **_Public Prosecutor v Sugianto & Anor_** [1994] 2 SLR 1, the Court of
Appeal reiterated at page 16:

> The essential ingredient of a conspiracy is agreement. (See the judgment of
> the Court of Appeal in _Lai Kam Loy & Ors v PP_.) From the very nature of a
> conspiracy, direct evidence will hardly ever be available. It is evident,
> therefore, that the existence of a conspiracy will have to be inferred from
> the evidence and all the surrounding circumstances of the case.

187 In essence, the prosecutions case against the second accused centred
around the evidence of the DEA undercover agent Ray; the audio-video recording
made at the River View Hotel and the transcripts thereon.

188 The second accuseds defence as summarised by his counsel in his closing
submission (paras 8 and 9) was as follows:

> 8\. In essence Afzals defence was that:-
>

>> (1) he never conspired with Hashim to sell any drugs to Ray;

>>

>> (2) he never arranged for any courier to bring the drugs to Singapore;

>>

>> (3) he did not negotiate for the sale of any drugs to Ray in Rays room in
River View Hotel;

>>

>> (4) he did not know anything about the 2 suitcases and their contents which
Naveed delivered to Hashim;

>>

>> (5) he did not meet and speak to Hashim in the vicinity of Orchard Plaza
when Hashim was carrying the two suitcases;

>>

>> (6) he had not called any drug supplier in Pakistan;

>>

>> (7) he did not make a call to Hashim telling him how to locate the drugs in
the two suitcases;

>>

>> (8) he did not make a phone call from a public telephone at a bus stop
outside Orchard Plaza on 6.4.2000 at about 11.00 p.m;

>>

>> (9) that he was in Singapore on legitimate business to source for cabin
compressor spare parts;

>>

>> (10) that Hashim who was his business partner in Pakistan had falsely
implicated Afzal in this case for his own ends; and

>>

>> (11) that he was not involved in any cheating scam as alleged by Hashim.

189 In short, the second accuseds explanation was that he was an innocent
businessman drawn into this mess, without his knowing by his scheming and
conniving partner, the first accused. He denied that he had anything to do
with the drugs found in the suitcases and that his presence at the River View
Hotel was merely to lend support to his partners leather jacket business and
nothing else. He told the court that his main purpose in coming to Singapore
was to source for cabin compressor parts which he required for a tender
exercise closing on or about 9 April 2000 although he would have assisted in
remitting whatever advance payments the first accused was hoping to receive
from his leather garment buyer. In this connection he even produced a list of
equipment to be purchased which was found with him when he was arrested. His
counsel urged me to accept his defence; reject both Rays evidence as well as
the first accuseds claim that the second accused was an active partner in the
so-called scam.

190 I must say at the outset that after due consideration I did not accept the
claim of the first accused that there was a so-called scam. I found it to be a
pure myth and consequently dismissed it as unworthy of belief and credit.

191 However, the transcripts as well as the video presentation gave a clear
impression that the second accused was neck-deep in this drug conspiracy. The
video-tape played in court and the transcripts confirmed that he was the chief
orator in Rays room.

192 His defence was found by me to be wholly against the drift and grain of
some direct and compelling evidence before the court. His mention in the hotel
room of: (a) We have very, very, very new item, very, very safe items (page 6
of the transcript) (b) a special system that is very new (page 6 of the
transcript), (c) come right from North East Asia (page 7 of the transcript);
(d) there is no match, this product made in Columbia. No match. (page 13 of
the transcript); (d) We do business with topmost quality so much risk right
from one place to other place (page 17 of the transcript); (e) we will always
give you the topmost quality, crystal, topmost (page 18 of the transcript);
(f) if there is transit, then no problem but there can be hassles(page 26 of
the transcript) (g) the guy has sample also opened sample also very little
(page 28 of the transcript); (h) we often come here, we travel here, its easy.
Its very dangerous also. (page 32 of the transcript); (i) the things which are
packed they are really very highly technically placed and if you open them
(page 37 of the transcripts) and a reference to a sample sent in a Christmas
card (page 24 of the transcript) all read in the context of the exchange
between Ray, the first and second accused, left no room for doubt that what
the second accused was talking about in the hotel room; his entire
conversation was about top quality drugs and not leather jackets in their true
sense.

193 The second accused endeavoured to explain that he was at all times making
reference to leather jackets and did not quite comprehend or follow what Ray
was talking about due to Rays peculiar accent and diction. Watching the video
not once but many times, the distinct impression the court had was that the
second accused knew what Ray was talking about and his present explanations
were nothing but fabrications on his part.

194 In fact, the segment which is reproduced below seemed to entirely nullify
the second accuseds claim that he did not know that Ray was talking about
drugs since the words it is all concealed in the suitcase were this time
clearly uttered not by Ray but by his partner in crime, the first accused:

> **Pages 6 and 7 of the transcript:**
>

>> KHAN: So we will tell you what we did. We did a very, very---and very, very
nice (Urdu)

>>

>> . (Urdu)

>>

>> HASHIM: Well, weve got a special system that is very new.

>>

>> OFFICER: Im lost.

>>

>> HASHIM: "Im lost"?

>>

>> OFFICER: Im lost. Oh, you got to mean carrying.

>>

>> HASHIM: _It is all concealed in the suitcase, so you dont have to worry
about taking there_.

>>

>> OFFICER: _Well, OK, you mean the actual heroin itself, OK_.

>>

>> KHAN: It came right from---

>>

>> OFFICER: It came from the area.

>>

>> KHAN: North East Asia.

>>

>> OFFICER: OK. Now, my question is this, I want to see my product before I
pay you. Do you understand that? Because I didnt come half way around the
world not to see my drugs. I got my courier, shell take care of everything for
me. She knows how to get it. Shes a professional. She has been working for me
since I started my business. OK?

>>

>> KHAN: OK.

>>

>> [Emphasis added.]

195 Having reviewed all the evidence in its totality after discounting what
the first accused said about the second accuseds role, the only compelling
conclusion was that the second accused was on 6 April 2000 actively engaged in
a conspiracy with his business partner, the first accused and abetted him in
the commission of the offence spelt out in the charge. In my finding, the
second accuseds evidence was replete with untruths and was an exercise in
skulduggery. I was in the end satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt by direct and unequivocal
evidence that the second accused was guilty of the offence charged. In the
premises, I found him guilty, convicted him and sentenced him to the mandatory
punishment prescribed under s 33 of the MDA.

**

(c) _Third accused_

**

196 The charge facing the third accused was that on 6 April 2000 at about
9.53pm, he trafficked in a controlled drug outside Centrepoint Shopping
Centre, Singapore, by delivering two suitcases containing not less than
2871.2g of diamorphine to the first accused and thereby committed an offence
under s 5(1)(a) punishable under s 33 of the MDA.

197 Section 5(1)(a) of the MDA has already been reproduced elsewhere in this
grounds and therefore requires no repetition. The fact that the two suitcases
seized by the CNB from the first accused (exhs P-52 and P-53) were the same
suitcases delivered by the third accused to the first accused was not disputed
by the third accused. He also did not dispute that at about 10.45pm on 6 April
2000, he handed over the keys to the suitcases to the first accused at River
View Hotel. The scientific evidence as to the diamorphine content of the drugs
found inside the suitcases as well as the chain of evidence relating thereto
were also not contested by the third accused. The only dispute was in relation
to the question whether the third accused knew that the two suitcases which he
carried from Lahore to Singapore and handed over to the first accused on that
day, contained a controlled drug when he delivered them to the first accused.

198 Counsel for the third accused seemed to concede at the outset that by
virtue of the fact that the third accused had physical possession of the two
suitcases in which the concealed drugs were found, the statutory presumptions
prescribed under s 18 of the MDA became operative. Insofar as is material ss
18(1) and (2) of the MDA provide as follows:

> 18.-(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or
> under his control
>

>> (a) anything containing a controlled drug;

>>

>> (b) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;

>>

>> (c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a
controlled drug is found; or

>>

>> (d) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document
intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,

>
> shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in
> his possession.
>
> (2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in
> his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have
> known the nature of that drug.
>
> (3) The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by
> proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled drug.
>
> (4) Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the
> rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in
> the possession of each and all of them.

199 The learned DPP also submitted in the same vein and said that the
presumption contained under s 18(2) of the MDA applied and in the
circumstances the third accused would have to rebut the operative presumptions
on balance of probabilities (para 96 of the prosecution submission).

200 However, it would be instructive at this stage to call to mind the
applicable principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal in like situations.

201 In **_Sim Teck Ho v Public Prosecutor_** [2000] 4 SLR 39 at 43, it was
held by the Court of Appeal (per Yong Pung How CJ) that:

> Therefore, in order to prove possession, the prosecution must prove that
> there is first, physical control over the controlled drug, and second,
> knowledge of the existence of the thing itself, _that is the existence of
> the controlled drug, but not the name nor nature of the drug._[Emphasis
> added.]

202 In other words, in addition to proving the element of the physical control
on the part of the accused, the prosecution would also have to prove knowledge
on the part of the accused as to the existence of the controlled drug.

203 The next aspect relates to the defence of ignorance by the accused and the
consideration whether the accused could have been wilfully blind to the
reality. In this regard, Yong Pung How CJ, in delivering the opinion of the
Court of Appeal in **_Chou Kooi Pang & Anor v Public Prosecutor_** [1998] 3
SLR 593 at 599 observed:

> Ignorance can only be a defence where there was no reason for suspicion. In
> the circumstances, the first appellant should have been alerted to the fact
> that he was carrying something illegal. He was being given a substantial sum
> of money just to deliver a bag to someone in Singapore. As such, his failure
> to inspect the contents of the bag when he received them or at any time
> until the bag was delivered to the second appellant amounted to wilful
> blindness to the obvious truth of the matter: _PP v Hla Win_ [1995] 2 SLR
> 424.

204 Now some first principles: In **_Tan Ah Tee & Anor v Public Prosecutor_**
[1978-1979] SLR 211, the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal (per Wee Chong Jin
CJ) commented at pages 217 and 218: Indeed if there were no statutory
presumptions available to the prosecution, once the prosecution had proved the
fact of physical control or possession of the plastic bag and the
circumstances which this was acquired by the [accused], the trial judges would
be justified in finding that [the accused] had possession of the contents of
the plastic bag within the meaning of the Act unless [the accused] gave an
explanation of the physical fact

205 The Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal then cited with approval what Lord
Wilberforce said in **_R v Warner_** [1969] 2 AC 256 (HL) at 312 in the
following terms:

> In all such cases, the starting point will be that the accused had physical
> control of something a package, a bottle, a container found to contain the
> substance. This is evidence generally strong evidence of possession. It
> calls for an explanation: the explanation will be heard and the jury must
> decide whether there is genuine ignorance of the presence of the substance,
> or such an acceptance of the package with all that it might contain, or with
> such opportunity to ascertain what it did contain or such guilty knowledge
> with regard to it as to make up the statutory possession. Of course it would
> not be right or consistent with the terms of the Act, to say that the onus
> of showing innocent custody rests upon the accused. The prosecution must
> prove the offence, and establish its ingredients. But one starts from the
> point that the Act itself has exempted the great majority of cases of
> innocent possession, so that once the prosecution has proved the fact of
> physical control in circumstances not covered by an exemption and something
> of the circumstances in which this was acquired or held, this, in the
> absence of explanation, may be sufficient to enable a finding of possession
> to be made. On the other hand, the duty to submit the question of possession
> to the jury in this way does give the opportunity of acquittal to innocent
> carriers and custodians, who can put forward an explanation of the physical
> fact which a jury accepts.

206 Citing a host of authorities the learned DPP argued that the third accused
was wilfully blind to the actual contents he was carrying. He submitted:
Naveed did not even inquire as to what he was in fact carrying. He was fully
satisfied with bringing two suitcases that appeared empty to Singapore to be
handed over to someone he never knew. He did not bother to make inquiry at all
of Naseeem Khan about most, if not, all relevant matters.

207 On the issue of wilful blindness the following segment appearing at para
119 of the prosecutions submission requires mention. It reads:

> In **_Warner_** it was said by Lord Pearce:
>
> For a man takes over a package or suitcase at risk as to its contents being
> unlawful if he does not immediately examine it (if he is entitled to do so).
> As soon as may be he should examine it and if he finds the contents
> suspicious reject possession by either throwing them away or by taking
> immediate sensible steps for their disposal.
>
> In this present case, Naveed took possession of the suitcases in Pakistan.
> He did not examine it there. He made no enquiries about the suitcases or the
> person to whom he was to deliver them. He also had sufficient time in
> Singapore and contact with Hashim to ask Hashim more about the suitcases,
> but he did not. He had ample opportunity to examine them in Singapore.
> Therefore, he recklessly and wilfully closed his eyes to the fact that he
> was indeed transporting drugs.

208 I found the foregoing submission to be altogether disingenuous. First of
all, it seemed to ignore the evidence of the third accused (which was not
contested at any length) that when he was handed the bags in Pakistan, they
were completely empty save for an odd mothball. Secondly, it also seemed to
side-step the prosecutions own evidence that when the bags were opened in Rays
hotel room, both Ray who was said to be an experienced DEA operative and the
first accused, the principal culprit in this episode, were themselves hard-put
to locate the drugs in the suitcases so much so they had to stop the search
for a while and seek advice from the associate of the first accused, before
they actually located the drugs. In the circumstances, the suggestion by the
prosecution that the third accused had ample opportunity to examine the bags
in Singapore was found by me to be somewhat effete.

209 In my opinion, the error on the part of the third accused for not asking
Naseem Khan why two empty suitcases were being sent to Singapore could not be
used to tack him with the label of wilful blindness. The situation at hand
cannot be likened to the famous Nelsons blind eye at the battle of Copenhagen,
alluded to by Lord Scott of Foscote in **_Manifest Shipping Co Ltd v Uni-
Polaris Shipping Co Ltd and others_** (2001) 1 All E R 743 at 780, where
Nelson made a conscious decision to place the telescope to his blind eye in
order to avoid seeing what he knew he would see if he placed it to his good
eye. A distinction ought to be made between a dishonest person and a person
who was found to be honestly blundering (see Lord Blackburns dicta in **_Jones
v Gordon_** (1877) 2 App Cas 616 at 629). In my evaluation, the third accused
was more of a blundering nitwit than a shrewd scoundrel.

210 There was an attempt by the prosecution to assail his credibility. This
was on account of certain inconsistencies in his evidence on some dates
mentioned by him in his statements as well as in his testimony. Chief amongst
them was the date on which Naseem Khan made the first offer to him to visit
Singapore. The third accused said it was on 15 March 2000. But his passport
entries showed that he was in Uganda at that time and had not arrived in
Pakistan until 25 March 2000. The prosecution opened fire with all its guns
blazing on this. But the forgotten fact was that he had previously, well
before he was confronted with his passport entry, told the court that this
meeting with Naseem Khan took place on the very day he returned from Uganda
and the said offer was made to him when members of his family gathered around
him upon his return at his residence. In my evaluation, the said discrepancy
should not be viewed as a deliberate lie on his part but was caused due to his
inability to recall the correct date. In any event, even if it was a lie,
which I did not think it was, it was not of that category of a lie bespoken in
**_R v Lucas_** [1981] QB 720 or **_Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh_**
[1994] 2 SLR 867, being a deliberate lie, related to a material issue,
motivated by a realisation of guilt and fear of truth. In this regard, it
behoved the court to bear in mind the advice contained in **_Yeo Choon Poh_**
that the mere fact an accused tells lies should not be taken as evidence of
his guilt and only a lie given out of a realization of guilt and fear of truth
relating to a material issue can amount to corroboration of the accuseds
guilt.

211 The other dates alluded to by the prosecution ie, whether the third
accused met the first accused in Singapore on 4 April or 5 April 2000 and
whether the third accused had met Naseem Khan in the hotel on 1 April or 3
April 2000 were similarly in my determination of little consequence to the
material issue; neither of them could be regarded as a deliberate lie; nor
were they considered by me to be material to the core issue. The prosecutions
submission here was extremely tenuous and consequently not accepted by me.

212 To digress a little, I must observe that if I were to accede to the
prosecutions invitation to hold that the third accuseds evidence stood
discredited or impeached basically because of the so-called inconsistencies
and discrepancies with regard to the dates mentioned by the third accused in
relation to some peripheral details, the prosecution would find itself equally
in an uncomfortable terrain in regard to some inconsistencies as to timings
listed by S/S/Sgt Thng when the first accused was reportedly narrating matters
concerning Faribourg during the recording of his statements. What was sauce
for the goose must be sauce for the gander as well.

213 In my determination, the account narrated by the third accused appeared to
have a substantial degree of cogency; he was neither shifty nor evasive nor
prevaricating. Except as to certain dates on which he seemed to have some
problems, I was inclined to think that he was in fact naive and somewhat
unwittingly had fallen in the trap set up by Naseem Khan and his fellow
collaborators. It also did not escape my notice that the third accused was the
one who volunteered the information concerning Naseem Khans involvement and
the latters antecedents. The third accused could simply have hidden them. But
he did not.

214 The learned DPP in his submission urged the court to draw an adverse
inference against the third accused for his failure to mention in his
cautioned statement that he had brought the suitcases from Pakistan to return
them to their owner Hash. This was a curious submission so to speak. First of
all, the court noted that the prosecution was singularly shy in not tendering
this cautioned statement during the prosecutions case for reasons well known
to it. Having elected so, it did not fall for the prosecution to argue later
that the third accused should have mentioned the particulars alluded to in his
cautioned statement.

215 Secondly, the case cited by the prosecution **_Roshdi v Public
Prosecutor_** [1994] 3 SLR 282 highlights the aspect that a cautioned
statement recorded under s 122(6) of the CPC does not require the accused
person to minutely detail the defence he would be relying on at the trial. At
any rate, looking at the cautioned statement in its true perspective, it was
my opinion that the third accused had stated his position sufficiently. In any
event, in the statement (exh P-50) made by him on 10 April 2000 two days after
his cautioned statement - he had adequately adumbrated his defence. In the
circumstances, the invitation by the prosecution to draw an adverse inference
against the third accused pursuant to s 122(3) of the CPC was found by me to
be entirely unprepossessing. In this, I am fortified by a view expressed by
the Singapore Court of Appeal in **_Public Prosecutor v Abdul Naser bin Amer
Hamsah_** [1997] 1 SLR 73 where the court observed that no adverse inference
could be drawn when the defence was disclosed in an investigation statement
recorded.

216 I considered all the evidence adduced at this trial in its totality. In
the administration of criminal justice, there are many contending and
complementary principles the courts would have to be often reminded of. The
first and foremost is the famous maxim: _It is better that ten guilty persons
escape than that one innocent suffer_. (Sir William Blackstone 1723-80
Commentaries on the Laws of England, 15th Edn, 1809 Vol 4, page 358). Then we
have another equally forceful expression: _A miscarriage of justice may arise
from the acquittal of the guilty no less than from the conviction of the
innocent_. (Viscount Simon LC,in **_Stirland v DPP_** [1944] AC 315 at 324.
Correspondingly, there is another gnome: _The judge is condemned when the
criminal is absolved_. (Thomas Fuller 1654-1734). The foregoing sayings are no
mere aphorisms but judicial sign-posts that often guide judges in the
administration of criminal justice.

217 Having examined the entire spectrum of the evidence, I formed the view
that the third accused was narrating a credible and cogent account of what
took place. He was found by me to be a simpleton and entirely forthcoming
without so much as a twitch of shiftiness about his demeanour or inflexion. In
my finding, the third accused, a person of low academic attributes fell into a
trap set up by Naseem Khan and his confederates without his knowing. When the
third accused was told that he could get a free trip if he agreed to deliver
some bags in Singapore, he readily accepted it without much thought. He did
not know that the suitcases he carried into Singapore and delivered to the
first accused contained drugs. With regard to all the evidence in its
entirety, I was of the view that the third accused had indeed raised a
reasonable and a real doubt on the prosecutions case.

218 In this connection, it might serve well if I reproduced below what I said
on 30 January 2001 when I delivered my verdict in relation to the case of the
third accused.

> (a) Having considered all the evidence and the submissions made thereon by
> counsel for the third accused as well as the learned DPP, I am of the view
> that the third accused has indeed raised a reasonable doubt on the
> prosecutions case and has rebutted whatever presumptions which may have
> arisen against him on a balance of probabilities. After reviewing the
> totality of the evidence, I am of the opinion that the prosecution has not

> beyond a reasonable doubt. I shall no doubt in due course set out my reasons
> in this connection in writing. However, within the parameters laid out in
> _Goh Lai Wak v PP_ [1994] 1 SLR 748, I must say that the case against the
> third accused was by and large anchored amongst other things on two broad
> grounds. The first ground was that the third accused ought not to have
> agreed to carry those suitcases, albeit empty for delivery to someone in
> Singapore especially from one Naseem Khan who had been to prison in Pakistan
> for drug-related offences. The second ground was that the sum of US$500
> which the third accused was paid to bring those suitcases into Singapore,
> must have triggered the requisite alarm bell in his mind so as to cause him
> to examine even the inner linings of the said suitcases closely.
>
> (b) The foregoing submission had no doubt an appearance of logic. However,
> it seemed to elude the prosecutions own evidence that even their star
> witness Raymond Quattlander, a trained DEA operative as well as Hashim, the
> principal character in this saga whom the prosecution portrayed as one of
> the traffickers, encountered noticeably, great difficulty that too for a
> considerable period of time in locating the hidden drugs. Given this
> scenario, the suggestion that had the third accused examined the linings of
> the bags closely he would have discovered that they contained drugs, is
> found by me to be lacking in substance. Further, a payment of US$500 which
> is equivalent to about S$875 to act as an errand boy for someone from Lahore
> to Singapore, in itself, does not warrant a reasonable, let alone an
> irresistible inference that the third accused knew or ought to have known
> that he was bringing drugs into Singapore.
>
> (c) In my view, the story narrated by the third accused appeared to possess
> a degree of cogency. Add to this fact that he had lugged the two large
> suitcases over some distance from his hotel room and delivered them to
> Hashim in a public area rather than within the confines of his hotel room,
> appeared to lend some weight to his defence. Moreover, his claim that he
> came to Singapore to sell some wares and earn a bit of money and in
> pursuance of this he in fact sold some of his wares to a trader in Orchard
> Road was not challenged by the prosecution although the prosecution did have
> the whereabouts of the stores he had visited. Still more, his immediate and
> unhesitating statement declaring his non-involvement when charged with the
> offence as well as his volunteering information about events in Pakistan
> including the background of Naseem Khan which he could have well hidden and
> one which the prosecution would not have known but for his volunteering,
> appeared to render his story all the more creditworthy. Now dealing with the
> inconsistencies highlighted by the prosecution as respects the dates of his
> meeting with Naseem Khan in Lahore and with Hashim in Singapore they are in
> my view not significant enough to reject his evidence as being unworthy of
> credit. In my view he had tilted the balance in his favour and created a
> real and reasonable doubt on the prosecutions case.
>
> (d) In the premises I am unable to conclude that he is guilty as charged and
> consequently acquit and discharge him of the charge. I will now hear the
> learned DPP as to the charge which is pending against him.

219 In the end, as stated by me earlier I found the first and second accused
guilty as charged, convicted them and sentenced them to the only punishment
prescribed under the law. The third accused was acquitted. Consequent upon the
verdict and upon the application of the prosecution, leave was granted to
withdraw the remaining charges pending against the first and the second
accused. They were as a result given a discharge amounting to an acquittal in
relation to the said charges, pursuant to s 177 of the CPC.
