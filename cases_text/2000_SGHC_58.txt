: The defendants, who are the respondents in this appeal, operate Apollo Hotel
Singapore at Havelock Road. The plaintiff-appellant was employed by the
defendants as a lift attendant on 13 September 1973. He remained in their
employment in various capacities, as a bell-hop and finally as a driver for
almost 25 years. By way of a letter dated 31 August 1998 (`the letter of
termination`) signed by the defendants` personnel manager, the plaintiff`s
employment was terminated. The plaintiff was dissatisfied with his termination
and referred the matter to his union whose officials made representations to
the defendants on his behalf. When this did not work, the union made a formal
application to the Ministry of Manpower pursuant to the Employment Act (Cap
91) (`the Act`). This recourse was not proceeded with when the plaintiff
commenced this action in the District Court in DC Suit 7558/98.  
  
The plaintiff alleged that the defendants terminated his employment because of
redundancy and claimed for retrenchment benefits provided under the Collective
Agreement (`the CA`). In the alternative, he claimed that his dismissal was in
breach of s 14 of the Act and claimed damages. He also claimed certain amounts
in respect of meals not provided by the defendants and telephone expenses. In
their defence, the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff`s employment was
`**_terminated due to his bad working attitude and difficult behaviour
according to the employment contract_** `. The defendants averred that the
termination was not a dismissal under s 14 of the Employment Act and submitted
that as a matter of law, they were entitled to terminate the plaintiff`s
employment with one month`s pay in lieu of notice as provided in ss 10 and 11.  
  
In the court below, the district judge dismissed all the plaintiff`s claims.
He found on a preliminary determination that ss 10 and 11 of the Act gave the
defendants the right to immediately terminate the plaintiff`s employment with
payment of one month`s pay in lieu of notice. In view of this finding, the
district judge said that the question of wrongful dismissal did not arise and
did not examine this issue. The trial proceeded on the question of whether it
was a disguised redundancy retrenchment and on the plaintiff`s claims in
respect of meals and telephone calls. Before me the plaintiff appealed against
the decision of the court below. After hearing the submissions from counsel, I
allowed the appeal in relation to the main claim for redundancy payment, but
dismissed the appeal in respect of the claim for reimbursement for meals and
telephone calls. The defendants have filed notice of appeal against the order
relating to wrongful termination and I now give my grounds of decision. [The
appeal was withdrawn - Ed.]  
  
**_Whether plaintiff was dismissed_**

****

In para 5 of their defence, the defendants averred that the plaintiff`s
employment was `**_terminated due to his bad working attitude and difficult
behaviour according to the employment contract_** `. It is not clear whether
this means that he was dismissed. Before examining this, I first set out the
definitions of two terms that I will use in this judgment. Section 10 of the
Act provides that either party to a contract of service may give notice of his
intention to terminate such contract. The length of such notice shall be that
provided in contract or, in the absence of such provision, shall range from
one day to four weeks depending on the period of employment. Section 11
provides that either party may dispense with such notice period by payment to
the other party the salary that the employee would have earned during that
period. I will use the term `termination with notice` to describe termination
(or purported termination) pursuant to s 10 or 11, ie whether it is with
notice or payment of salary in lieu of notice. In a termination with notice
there is no requirement for either party to have or give reasons for the
termination. Hence when the defendants plead that the plaintiff was terminated
on grounds that appear to suggest misconduct, there is uncertainty as to
whether it is a termination with notice.  
  
The second term is `dismissal with cause` which I will use to refer to
dismissal pursuant to s 14 of the Act. That section provides as follows:

> _
>
> (1) An employer may after due inquiry dismiss without notice an employee
> employed by him on the grounds of misconduct inconsistent with the
> fulfilment of the express or implied conditions of his service except that
> instead of dismissing an employee an employer may -
>
> (a) instantly down-grade the employee; or
>
> (b) instantly suspend him from work without payment of salary for a period
> not exceeding one week.
>
> (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), where an employee considers that he has
> been dismissed without just cause or excuse by his employer, he may, within
> one month of the dismissal, make representations in writing to the Minister
> to be reinstated in his former employment.
>
> (3) The Minister may, before making a decision on any such representations,
> by writing under his hand request the Commissioner to inquire into the
> dismissal and report whether in his opinion the dismissal is without just
> cause or excuse.
>
> (4) If, after considering the report made by the Commissioner under
> subsection (3), the Minister is satisfied that the employee has been
> dismissed without just cause or excuse, he may, notwithstanding any rule of
> law or agreement to the contrary -
>
> (a) direct the employer to reinstate the employee in his former employment
> and to pay the employee an amount that is equivalent to the wages that the
> employee would have earned had he not been dismissed by the employer; or
>
> (b) direct the employer to pay such amount of wages as compensation as may
> be determined by the Minister, and the employer shall comply with the
> direction of the Minister.
>
> (5) The decision of the Minister on any representation made under this
> section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be challenged in any
> court.
>
> (6) Any direction of the Minister under subsection (4) shall operate as a
> bar to any action for damages by the employee in any court in respect of the
> wrongful dismissal.
>
> (7) An employer who fails to comply with the direction of the Minister under
> subsection (4) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on
> conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not
> exceeding 12 months or to both.
>
> (7A) Where any amount to be paid by an employer under subsection (4) is not
> paid in accordance with the direction of the Minister and the employer has
> been convicted of an offence under subsection (7), the amount or so much
> thereof as remains unpaid shall be recoverable by the court as if it were a
> fine and the amount so recoverable shall be paid to the employee entitled to
> payment under the direction of the Minister.
>
> (8) For the purpose of an inquiry under subsection (1), the employer may
> suspend the employee from work for a period not exceeding one week but shall
> pay him not less than half his salary for such period.
>
> (9) If the inquiry does not disclose any misconduct on the part of the
> employee, the employer shall forthwith restore to the employee the full
> amount of the salary so withheld.
>
> _

  
  
Section 14(1) provides for two remedies to the employer in the case of
employee misconduct, viz dismissal or punishment (by down-grading or
suspension from work without salary of up to one week). We are concerned here
only with dismissal. Under this provision, the employer has the right to
dismiss an employee without notice if, after due inquiry, he finds that the
employee has engaged in misconduct inconsistent with the fulfilment of the
express and implied conditions of his service. There are safeguards in s 14
against a wrongful dismissal. The employee may make written representations to
the Minister within one month and the Minister may cause an inquiry to be made
as to whether the dismissal was without just cause or excuse. If the Minister
is satisfied that the employee was dismissed wrongfully, he may direct
reinstatement of the employee or monetary compensation to be made.  
  
It can thus be seen that if an employer makes a termination with notice, he is
obliged to give the employee a certain period of notice during which the
latter continues to be paid his salary, or to give the employee salary in lieu
of notice. On the other hand, if termination is by way of dismissal with
cause, no notice period is required to be given although there is nothing to
prevent the employer from giving notice. However the employer must make due
inquiry as to the alleged misconduct. Also the employee has recourse to the
Minister if he feels that the dismissal is wrongful.  
  
Proceeding to the circumstances of this case, the defendants` letter of
termination dated 31 August 1998 is entitled `Letter of Termination` and
states as follows:

> _I am to inform that the Hotel has decided that your services are no longer
> required and your employment with the Hotel will be terminated with effect
> from 1 September 1998. In accordance with your contract of employment, the
> Hotel hereby gives you one (1) month salary in-lieu of notice for the
> termination of your Contract. ... your last day of service with the Hotel
> shall be today, 31 August 1998. ..._

  
  
This letter states that the ground for termination is that the plaintiff`s
services `are no longer required`. It also states that, in accordance with the
`Contract of Employment`, the plaintiff is given one month`s salary in lieu of
notice. The parties agree that the employment contract, insofar as it is
written, is contained in (i) a document entitled `Employment Agreement` dated
13 September 1973; (ii) the CA; and (iii) any provision of any written law.
The first two documents do not mention any right on the part of the defendants
to terminate the plaintiff`s employment with payment of one month`s pay in
lieu of notice although the plaintiff is obliged to give one month`s notice of
resignation. Section 10(2) of the Employment Act provides that the length of
notice shall be the same for both parties and it would follow that the
defendants would also be obliged to give one month`s notice. In any event, s
10 of the Employment Act supplies the default notice period, which in the
plaintiff`s case amounts to four weeks.  
  
There is no express provision in the employment contract, apart from s 14 of
the Employment Act, for `termination` for misconduct generally or on any of
the grounds stipulated in para 5 of the defence. It would appear that if the
defendants had bona fide grounds for terminating the plaintiff`s employment
for misconduct, for some reason they had decided not to seek recourse under s
14 of the Employment Act. As I have pointed out above, that would have
entailed making `due inquiry` and the possibility of an inquiry and
intervention by the Minister.  
  
Finally, there is no mention in the letter of termination of any misconduct on
the part of the plaintiff nor of any `due inquiry` being made. And in para 10
of the defence, the defendants aver as follows:

> _... The plaintiff`s service was terminated according to the employment
> contract as stated in para 5 herein. The plaintiff was not dismissed for
> misconduct and s 14 of the Employment Act is inapplicable in the
> circumstances._

  
  
Therefore, the only conclusion is that it pertains to termination with notice
and not dismissal with cause.  
  
**_Whether termination was due to redundancy_**

****

Notwithstanding that the defendants take a somewhat confused position in their
defence, on the face of the letter of termination they had purported to make a
termination with notice pursuant to ss 10 and 11 of the Act. The plaintiff
claims that he was in fact retrenched and that the defendants had merely
disguised this as a termination with notice in order to avoid paying him
redundancy benefits under the CA in which cl 20 provides as follows:

> _
>
> 20 Retrenchment
>
> (1) Subject to the provisions of the Employment Act, an employee who has
> served for not less than three continuous years with the Hotel shall be paid
> a retrenchment benefit on the termination of his service on the ground of
> redundancy or by reason of any reorganisation or liquidation or voluntary
> winding up at the rate of one month`s basic salary last drawn for each year
> of continuous service and a proportionate part thereof for any incomplete
> year of service.
>
> (2) In the event of retrenchment, the Hotel shall give an employee two
> months` notice of termination or two months` pay in lieu of notice.
>
> _

  
  
**_Factual background_ **

****

The defendants decided in late 1997 to merge Apollo Hotel with Furama Hotel.
Their Group General Manager, Mr Cliff Leong (PW2) said that the merger was for
the survival of the hotel because they were undergoing a difficult period and
1998 was worse. He said that four departments would be merged, viz. (i) sales
and marketing, (ii) purchasing, (iii) public relations and (iv) training.
There was no merger of the Front Office Department, which the plaintiff was
in. But both the plaintiff and the Furama Hotel driver were required to
transport passengers of both Hotels, a move designed to achieve greater
efficiency in the use of resources. The Furama Hotel driver resigned sometime
in July 1998, leaving the plaintiff as the sole driver for both hotels. On 31
August 1998 the plaintiff was handed the letter of termination, with that day
to be his last day of service. Then on 2 September 1998, the defendants wrote
to Jamilah Ahmad, the Office Assistant in the Front Office Department, to
inform her that they would re-designate her position to include performing the
duties of a driver. The letter states as follows:

> _Please refer to our discussion on 2 September 1998 ... in respect of the
> integration and operational merging of both Apollo Hotel Singapore and
> Furama Hotel Singapore. As you are aware, the current economic situation
> continues to worsen for all business sectors. Companies regardless of its
> size are making concerted effort to maintain their competitive edge in order
> to ride the regional economic turmoil._

> _At Apollo and Furama Hotels, we too are striving for better results to
> remain competitive. As both hotels embrace new challenges, its employee`s
> contribution play an important role in its development. In its effort,
> employees were prepared to perform additional duties as in job enlargement.
> Since you possess a valid Class 3 driving licence, the hotel will assign you
> to perform additional duties of a driver and re-designate your appointment
> from Office Assistant to Office Assistant cum Driver with effect from 1
> September 1998 ..._

  
  
This letter also informed her that the new appointment would entail an
increase in her basic salary by $250, from $837 to $1087 per month. In
comparison, the plaintiff`s last drawn basic salary was $1,369.  
  
The defendants say that the plaintiff was a difficult and uncooperative
employee who had caused problems and disruptions at work. This was what the
district judge said at para 9 of his judgment:

> _The appellant performed his new duties but raised a query with the Union on
> the propriety of the new arrangement. The appellant also subsequently on
> various occasions wrote to the Ministry of Manpower and raised issues
> pertaining to alleged extra working hours, reimbursement of telephone
> charges and payment of food allowance. As a result of his complaints, the
> respondent and the Union had various meetings to resolve the matters raised
> by the appellant._

  
  
For these reasons they decided to terminate his employment. The defendants do
not dispute that they did not employ another person to replace the plaintiff
in his position as a driver and that they enlarged the position of the Office
Assistant to include performing the task of a driver. In so doing, the
defendants stood to save each month the plaintiff`s salary of $1,369 (less the
$250 increment granted to the Office Assistant cum Driver) as well as various
allowances. By characterising it as a termination with notice, they also stood
to save retrenchment benefits under the Collective Agreement of a sum
equivalent to almost 25 months of his basic salary, amounting to about $33,000
(less one month`s salary given in lieu of notice).  
  
The defendants say that they had the right to do so under s 10 of the Act and
the letter of termination was a bona fide termination with notice. I do not
dispute that there is a general right to effect a termination with notice. The
only question is whether the ground for termination was wholly or mainly
because of redundancy.  
  
**_The law_**

****

In **Malton v Crystal of Scarborough Ltd** [1971] ITR 106, a dismissed
employee claimed redundancy payment on the ground that his dismissal was due
to a redundancy. He was employed as one of two panel beaters and after he was
dismissed he was not replaced. The employer tried unsuccessfully to get
another apprentice to train up to that position, but no desperate effort was
made and such panel beating as they could not do was put out to contract. The
employer contested the claim on the grounds that their reasons for dismissing
him were that his work record was unsatisfactory and his poor quality of work.
The industrial tribunal decided that although he may have been redundant, he
had been dismissed for the reasons given by the employer and not because of
redundancy. On the question of whether there was a redundancy, Lord Parker CJ
said (at p 107):

> _There was as it seems to me a possible redundancy situation here. After
> dismissal he was not replaced by another panel beater, and as the tribunal
> say, though some effort was made to get another apprentice to train up to
> that position, no desperate efforts were made by the respondents to replace
> him. Such panel beating as they could not do was put out to contract. That
> being the position, one has to look very closely at the reasons given by the
> respondents for dismissing him, bearing in mind that in a redundancy
> situation such reasons may be put forward as an excuse._

  
  
The Lord Chief Justice, with whom the other two judges of the Queen`s Bench
Division agreed, said that in such a situation the onus was on the employer to
prove that the dismissal was not due to the redundancy. At p 106, he said:

> _... the only question in this case is as to whether the respondents, the
> employers, had negatived the presumption that the dismissal which did take
> place was not mainly or wholly due to redundancy._

  
  
After considering the facts, the court was satisfied that the tribunal were
justified in finding that the presumption was rebutted.  
  
In **Stride v Moore (Metal Spinners) Ltd** [1967] ITR 117, an earlier case
with similar facts, Lord Parker CJ said that the onus was on the employer to
prove that the dismissal was not solely or mainly due to redundancy. Again the
court found that there was sufficient evidence to justify the tribunal`s
finding that the dismissal was not wholly or mainly due to redundancy.  
  
The law in England is therefore as follows. If an employee is dismissed in
circumstances where a redundancy results and that employee is entitled to
redundancy payments were he retrenched on account of redundancy, there is a
presumption that the dismissal is on that ground. The onus then shifts to the
employer to show that it was not solely or mainly due to redundancy. I see no
reason why the same position should not obtain in Singapore. It is after all a
matter of balancing the unequal positions of the parties. It would otherwise
be all too easy for employers to escape their legal obligation to pay the
redundancy benefits to which the employee is entitled. The CA, which contains
the redundancy payment provision, is an agreement between the parties that
must be upheld not just in letter but, for the sake of industrial harmony,
also in spirit. I would therefore hold that the law in Singapore is the same
as in England.  
  
Unfortunately the judge below was of the view that the burden of proof rests
on the plaintiff. He said at [para ] 34 of his judgment:

> _To prove his case, the [plaintiff] would have to show that the [defendant]
> intended to reorganise the front office operations and merge the job of
> Office Assistant and driver before terminating the [plaintiff] on 31 August
> 1998. He had to prove on a balance of probabilities that the [defendant] had
> really intended to retrench the [plaintiff] and had contractually terminated
> the [plaintiff] in order to avoid paying retrenchment benefits under cl 20
> of the Collective Agreement. Neither the [plaintiff] nor his witnesses gave
> direct evidence to discharge this burden. ..._

  
  
The finding below was therefore made on a misapprehension of the law in
respect of the burden of proof. As all the evidence had been taken and were
before me, it was not necessary to remit the case to the judge below.  
  
**_Analysis of the evidence_**

****

I now turn to consider whether the defendants have adduced evidence to prove
that the termination of the plaintiff`s employment was not due wholly or
mainly to the redundancy. The defendants` witnesses say that the conduct and
attitude of the plaintiff was such that they felt that he did not fit into the
organisation and their intention was purely to terminate his employment with
no intention, at the time of termination, of making the position redundant.
This is of course evidence of a subjective intent which only the person
concerned is able to give positive evidence of. However the court is entitled
to look at extrinsic evidence, particularly in relation to the actions of that
person, to see whether it is consistent with the stated intention.  
  
There are features in the evidence adduced by the defendants that are wholly
unsatisfactory and I find on the whole that they have not rebutted the
presumption that the termination was due wholly or mainly to redundancy. I set
these out below.  
  
The defendants plead in para 6 of their defence that the plaintiff was `**_a
difficult and uncooperative worker who has caused several problems and
disruptions in his work_** ` and listed nine matters as particulars. These can
be summarised as follows:

(a) he refused to co-operate with the integration of the driver`s job for the
two hotels;

(b) he complained of shorter lunch hours when he in fact took longer periods
for lunch;

(c) his complaints were taken up by the Union and he agreed to the integration
of the driver`s job and to send a letter of apology to the defendants;

(d) but instead of sending an apology, he repeated his unfounded complaints on
24 April 1998;

(e) while refusing to perform duties pursuant to the job integration, he
demanded a phone card as the driver of Furama Hotel was given one. The
defendants agreed to given him one from 1 June 1998;

(f) he complained directly to the Ministry of Manpower instead of complying
with the Grievance Procedure in the CA;

(g) on 23 July 1998 he lodged another complaint concerning his claims for
telephone calls and meal allowances;

(h) the defendants reminded him to follow the Grievance Procedure; and

(i) he deliberately or negligently recorded the Transport Log Book wrongly
several times, and additional mileage recorded was unjustifiable.  
  
On 7 September 1998, the defendants` Personnel Manager met the Union`s
representatives to explain the reasons for the termination. The minutes of
that meeting was recorded by the Assistant Personnel Manager and the material
part of it states as follows:

> _Management revealed the facts, reasons and explained that its decision was
> based on grounds of the ex-employee`s low integrity, adverse attitude,
> unethical work behaviour and poor performance. Management detailed on a
> point to point basis 14 facts and pointers that eventually lead to
> Management`s decision to contractually terminate Noor Mohd as follows: ..._

  
  
There follows 14 subparagraphs listing, not various examples of the adverse
behaviour and attitude attributed to the plaintiff, but instances relating to:

(a) inaccuracies in the Driver`s Log Book, ie particular (i) of para 6 of the
defence; and

(b) the lunch break, ie particular (b) of para 6 of the defence.  
  
This suggests that these other matters were formulated after 7 September 1998
and before the defence was drafted, and were not in the minds of the
defendants` representatives when they decided to terminate the employment on
31 August 1998.  
  
Furthermore, while in most of these instances the defendants` complaint appear
reasonable on the face of it, a few of them do not appear to be all that
serious. And the first one is so trivial as to invite the suspicion that it
was included to boost the number. This is what is recorded in the minutes as
the first incident:

> _**On 14 July 1998** _

> _Management noted Noor Mohd had deliberately indicated in his Driver`s Log
> Book that his lunch hour was taken from 1pm to 1.45pm although his personal
> car season card computer print-out recorded his car exit at 12.55pm and re-
> entry into the Hotel at 1.37 pm. It was noted that he had intentionally
> recorded his timings inaccurately and had consumed his lunch earlier than
> recorded and permitted._

  
  
From this record, it would seem that according to the clock in the computer,
the plaintiff had passed the barrier at 12.55pm. This the plaintiff recorded
in his book as 1pm. He returned from lunch, according to the computer, at
1.37pm. He recorded it as 1.45pm. So he had taken, according to the computer,
42 minutes from exit to return but had recorded it as 45 minutes. His
timepiece did not coincide with that in the computer and was 5 minutes late at
exit and 8 minutes late on return. I can see no basis, apart from malice, for
including this as evidence of misconduct. The defendants appear to be keen to
bolster their case for termination (i) at the meeting with the Union on 7
September 1998 by including trivial and unjustified complaints; and (ii) in
their defence by adding matters that did not feature at all at the time of
termination.  
  
The plaintiff called Jamilah Ahmad to give evidence. She said that she
obtained her motorcar driving licence in April 1998 and that shortly
afterwards, she had informed Foo, the Front Desk Manager who was her
supervisor. She also said that the Personnel Manager, Sim, also knew about
this because about a month later, he congratulated her in the lift. Although
both Foo and Sim denied such knowledge in cross-examination, I find it
puzzling that Jamilah Ahmad, who is still in the defendants` employ, would
give this evidence in such an unequivocal manner if it were not the truth.  
  
Although the judge below said that he did not find Sim to be an unreliable
witness, I would, with respect, beg to differ. In para 44 of his judgment, the
judge said that Sim`s testimony `**_and demeanour in court were forthright and
the version of facts proffered, logical and reasonable_** `. While I did not
have the opportunity to observe Sim`s demeanour in court, an examination of
the notes of evidence reveals that his testimony was not all that forthright
nor was it wholly logical. I have given one instance above, ie his denial of
any knowledge that Jamilah Ahmad had a driving licence. The other instances
are as follows:

(i) When Sim was first questioned about merging the two jobs, he said that it
did not occur to him that there would be cost savings. The following day, he
said that this consideration did cross his mind.

(ii) At several points in his cross-examination, Sim was evasive in his
answers. There were four instances in which he failed to answer the question
asked and counsel had to repeat the question. From the first responses he gave
to those questions, one can see that he was trying to avoid a possibly awkward
answer.

(iii) When asked why he chose to `dramatically` terminate the plaintiff`s
employment on 31 August 1998, his answer was: `It being the end of the month`.
In a later answer he explained that it would be easier for salary computation
to await the end of the month, in other words, for administrative convenience.
From this it would appear that the matter was not so urgent as would justify
any inconvenience to his payroll clerk in having to compute the pro-rated pay.
Yet when asked why did he not give the plaintiff one month`s notice instead of
paying him a month`s salary in lieu thereof, Sim`s answer was as follows:

> _I have to maintain discipline and I have to maintain productivity. Employee
> working together as a team - embracing the economic situation, learning new
> skills. The plaintiff was making serious allegations against the hotel. This
> causes disruptions to the hotel`s business opportunities, and instead of the
> hotel concentrating better to deal with the economic situation, we were
> plagued by allegations. Because of that we decided we didn`t want him around
> anymore._

  
  
Clearly this ground does not sit well with the ground of administrative
convenience.  
  
In my view, the evidence of Sim and Foo shows that they were keen to emphasise
that the notion of merging the two jobs did not cross their minds at the time
they terminated the employment on 31 August, and that it only surfaced the
following day, on 1 September. It must be borne in mind that the plaintiff was
the only driver at the time. Surely the question of a replacement must have
been foremost in their minds as it concerns the operations of the hotels. The
decision to terminate the employment of the plaintiff was not one that came as
a bolt out of the blue. The defendants` complaints against him relate to
events over several months.  
  
Furthermore, it would appear from the minutes of the meeting with the Union on
7 September, that the defendants had been monitoring the plaintiff`s
activities between 14 July and 29 August. Despite such close monitoring, all
they could come up with by way of specific evidence of the plaintiff`s
misconduct was that he had failed to accurately record his log book.  
  
There is a significant difference between the circumstances in the present
appeal and those in the two English cases cited above. In the latter, the
employees concerned were dismissed on ground of misconduct. In **_Malton_** `s
case, the court said (at p 107):

> _... The reasons which they did put forward were that the quality of his
> work was unsatisfactory, in other words he was an inefficient workman, and
> it is accepted that he was far less efficient than the other panel beater
> ..._

> _Secondly, it was said that his work record was unsatisfactory in that he
> was absent on many occasions and late on many occasions. They said that the
> final straw, as it were, occurred just before the notice of dismissal was
> given when, having injured himself playing football on Saturday, he did not
> turn up for a considerable period, and did not produce a doctor`s
> certificate until a week following the Monday of his return to work, instead
> of obeying the written rule of the company that the doctor`s certificate
> should be handed in at once._

  
  
And in **_Stride_** `s case, the headnote reads:

> _The appellant was employed by the respondents as a metal spinner. In
> November, 1966, the respondents wrote to him warning him that unless his

In each of those two cases the employer had dismissed the employee and the
latter then referred the matter to the industrial tribunal which examined
whether there were bona fide grounds for the dismissal.  
  
In the present appeal, there was no dismissal with cause under s 14 of the
Employment Act, nor indeed any other form of dismissal at all. The defendants
simply gave the plaintiff a letter terminating his employment with one month`s
pay in lieu of notice. The difference is significant because had there been a
dismissal with cause, this would have obliged the defendants to make due
inquiry and entitled the plaintiff to make written representations to the
Minister who may order an inquiry. The defendants say that termination with
notice relieves them of any obligation to justify the termination. But it is
exactly for this reason that this court, when considering the defendants`
evidence, would bear in mind that it is very easy to use this as an expediency
in order to avoid incurring the substantial redundancy payments that the
plaintiff would be entitled to.  
  
The plaintiff had worked for the defendants for almost 25 years. During most
of this period there was no blot on his record. In 1983 the defendants awarded
him a Long Service Medal for his `**_in recognition and appreciation of the
faithful service rendered_** ` . In 1984 he received a similar award. The
defendants have not brought up any incidents prior to July 1998 in which the
plaintiff was difficult and uncooperative. It would appear that this sudden
change on his part took place only after the plaintiff had raised the inquiry
with his Union in March 1998. Even then, the defendants` witnesses had not
given evidence of specific instances in which the plaintiff was difficult and
uncooperative, apart from the fact that he had complained to his Union. There
was no allegation that he had refused to do the work assigned to him on any
particular occasion and the only specific complaint appears to be his
inability to faithfully and accurately maintain the driver`s log book. This
could explain why the defendants did not resort to dismissal with cause.
Furthermore, the fact that with almost 25 years` service the plaintiff`s
redundancy payment is a substantial sum provides the motive for the defendants
to resort to this course of action.  
  
The circumstances at the time were as follows. Apollo Hotel and Furama Hotel
were merged during a time of severe economic difficulty for the hotel industry
and the General Manager himself said that it was `**_for the survival of the
hotel_** `. To keep afloat, the defendants engaged in severe cost cutting
measures. One day after the termination, the position of Office Assistant was
enlarged to include that of driver. The fact is that after the termination, no
additional person was engaged by the defendants.  
  
Bearing all these factors in mind, I found that the defendants had not
discharged the burden of rebutting the presumption that the termination was
wholly or mainly due to redundancy. Accordingly I allowed the appeal in
respect of this part of the claim.  
  
**_Retirement Age Act_**

****

That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. However there is one further
matter which it is incumbent upon me to clarify. Counsel for the plaintiff had
also submitted that the Retirement Age Act (`RAA`) operated to remove the
right of termination with notice under s 10 of the Act. At the end of the
hearing I accepted his submission and gave that as an alternative ground for
allowing the plaintiff`s appeal. However that holding was made without a full
consideration of the matter - indeed neither counsel had included the Second
Reading speech for the Retirement Age Bill in their bundles of authorities
although a copy was produced towards the end of the hearing. I have since had
an opportunity to fully consider this point and would hold that the RAA does
not have such effect. This of course does not affect the outcome of the
appeal, the grounds for which I have given above. I set out below my reasons
for so holding.  
  
The Long Title of the RAA states as follows:

> _An Act to provide for a minimum retirement age for employees and for
> matters connected therewith_

  
  
The operative provisions are ss 4 to 8. There is no express repeal of s 10 of
the Act nor anything to state that it shall not apply in any particular
situation. The only provision that can possibly affect s 10 is s 4(1). Section
4 provides as follows:

> _
>
> (1) Notwithstanding anything in any other written law, contract of service
> or collective agreement, the retirement age of an employee shall be not less
> than 60 years or such other age, up to 67 years, as may be prescribed by the
> Minister.
>
> (2) No employer shall dismiss on the ground of age any employee who is below
> 60 years of age or the prescribed retirement age.
>
> (3) Any employer who contravenes subsection (2) shall be guilty of an
> offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or
> to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.
>
> _

  
  
The effect of the opening words `**_notwithstanding anything in any other
written law_** ` would be to overrule any other statutory provision that
contradicts this sub-section. However s 4(1) only provides that the retirement
age of an employee shall be not less than 60 years or such other age as may be
prescribed by the Minister. The Minister has prescribed the minimum retirement
age to be 62 years with effect from 1 January 1999: see the Retirement Age
(Prescribed Retirement Age) Regulations 1998 dated 7 December 1998, and I
shall refer to that as `the prescribed age`.  
  
In relation to persons within the ambit of the RAA, there is the question of
the meaning of `retirement`. If there is a provision for retirement, as in the
present appeal, is the employer entitled, pursuant to s 10 of the Employment
Act, to terminate the employment of an employee who has not attained the
prescribed age? There is no definition of this term in the RAA nor in any
other Act. Section 4(2) prohibits an employer from dismissing any employee
(who is below the prescribed age) on the ground of age and s 4(3) makes
contravention of that provision an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment.
In addition, s 7 provides the remedies available to an employee who considers
that he has been unlawfully dismissed on the ground of age. Such person may
make representations in writing to the Minister to be reinstated or for
compensation. But there is no express provision in the RAA relating to the
question whether an employer may terminate employment under s 10 of the
Employment Act. However I need not deal with this in great detail because any
ambiguity as to whether this must be implied is resolved by a consideration of
the Minister`s Second Reading speech in moving the Bill in Parliament on 12
April 1993, which the court is entitled to consider pursuant to s 9A of the
Interpretation Act. I only need to cite the following passage from that speech
(at column 34):

> _Sir, though the Bill will give workers the right to work up to 60 years and
> beyond, I wish to stress that employers` right to terminate employees`
> service on grounds of poor performance or ill-health, or to dismiss
> employees on ground of misconduct, would not be abrogated. These are
> established rights of the employers. It is not the Government`s intention to
> compel all employers to keep poor performers or ill-disciplined employees.
> It is important that we continue to maintain a disciplined and productive
> workforce._

  
  
In view of the intention expressed by the Minister in that speech, and the
fact that there is no express provision in the RAA relating to s 10 of the
Employment Act, I would disagree with counsel for the plaintiff that the
defendants do not have the right to terminate the plaintiff`s employment
pursuant to s 10.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
