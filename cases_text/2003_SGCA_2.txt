_ **Delivered by Chao Hick Tin JA** _

1 The first appellant (Vignes) was convicted of a capital charge of
trafficking in controlled drugs by delivering a packet containing a net weight
of 27.65 g of diamorphine to Sergeant (Sgt) S Rajkumar, who was an officer of
the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), in exchange for $8,000. The second
appellant (Moorthy) was convicted of a capital charge of abetting Vignes to
traffic in the said drugs and in pursuance of their conspiracy, Moorthy handed
the drugs to Vignes in order to enable the latter to deliver the drugs to Sgt
Rajkumar. Both appellants were sentenced to suffer death. They appealed. Their
appeals were heard on 25 November 2002. This is now our judgment which was
reserved.

**The prosecution’s case**

2 About a week before 20 September 2001, Sgt Rajkumar was informed that a
Malaysian syndicate, the members of which were Indians, was looking for heroin
buyers in Singapore. He arranged, through his informer, for a deal to be done,
with him posing as a potential buyer of heroin. He gave his handphone number
to his informer so as to enable the syndicate members to contact him.

3 At about 11.00am on 20 September 2001, Sgt Rajkumar learnt that the
syndicate had one pound of heroin for sale for S$8,000. He was asked to
proceed quickly to the Marsiling MRT Station to wait for the seller’s call.
Sgt Rajkumar informed his superior, ASP S Krishnan, who immediately summoned
eight officers and briefed them on his plan to arrest the suspected trafficker
or traffickers.

4 The CNB officers arrived at the Marsiling MRT Station at about 12.20pm. Sgt
Rajkumar met his informer there as the seller of the drugs was only willing to
call the informer’s mobile phone. Ten minutes later, Sgt Rajkumar received a
call on the informer’s mobile phone and the person at the other end of the
line identified himself as "Vignesh", who then told Sgt Rajkumar that the
place to effect the transaction had been changed to Admiralty Road, in front
of the An-Nur Mosque. Sgt Rajkumar told "Vignesh" that his name was "Segar"
and that he would be coming in a silver-coloured car bearing the licence plate
number 9073. After the call, Sgt Rajkumar informed his colleagues of the
change of venue for the transaction.

5 Sgt Rajkumar then left the Marsiling MRT station for the Mosque, with Sgt
Daniel Gan at the wheel. When they arrived near the Mosque, Sgt Rajkumar
noticed that a person was staring at his car and approaching it. He got out of
the car and walked towards the person. The conversation in Tamil between the
person (later established to be Vignes) and Sgt Rajkumar was subsequently
recorded in English by Sgt Rajkumar in the field book at Clementi Police
Division. That entry reads:-

> Raj : Hi
>
> Vignesh : U Segar right
>
> Raj : Yes.
>
> Vignesh : I’m Vignesh
>
> Raj : How
>
> Vignesh : Where’s the money
>
> Raj : With my partner (pointing to Sgt Daniel Gan who was in the driver’s
> seat).
>
> Raj : Where’s the stuff.
>
> Vignesh : I’ve put it in front, near the Mosque. Take the money and follow
> me.
>
> Raj : OK (took the money from Sgt Daniel Gan and followed Vignesh).
>
> Vignesh : How, can u trust the male Chinese in the car.
>
> Raj : Don’t worry, he’s my financier. Without him, I can’t deal.
>
> Vignesh : (After stopping in front of the Mosque, after the gate of the
> Mosque). The stuff is with me. Take out the money. You know how much is it
> right.
>
> Raj : $8,000 right.
>
> Vignesh : Yes.
>
> Raj : Where’s the stuff.
>
> Vignesh : (Handed over the white plastic bag from his maroon helmet). Is the
> money correct.
>
> Raj : Yes (Handed the money to him).
>
> Raj : Is the stuff good.
>
> Vignesh : It’s very good. U watch and see. You are sure to come back to deal
> with me again.

6 As pre-arranged, at that point Sgt Rajkumar gave the thumbs-up signal.
Vignes was arrested by the other CNB officers who were lying in ambush. Vignes
was then made to sit at the rear seat of the CNB staff car. Whilst in the car,
Sgt Rajkumar questioned Vignes, who told him that his "annai" (which means
"elder brother" in Tamil) had given the packet to him and that his brother was
somewhere in the vicinity, waiting to collect the money from him. The
substance in the packet was later established to contain not less than 27.65
grams of diamorphine. As requested, Vignes called his "brother" using the
handphone of one of the CNB officers. After the telephone conversation, Vignes
said that his "brother" was in the vicinity of a fruit shop along Woodlands
Centre Road and was on a motorcycle. The CNB officers then drove near to a
spot, overlooking the fruit shop, for Vignes to point out his "brother".
Vignes duly identified a man in a grey shirt as his "brother". That person was
later established to be Moorthy.

7 This information was immediately passed on to ASP Krishnan and another CNB
officer, who had positioned themselves in the vicinity. They approached
Moorthy and, after identifying themselves, asked Moorthy what he was doing at
the fruit shop and the latter replied that he was waiting for a friend. When
asked for the name of the friend, Moorthy did not answer. He was then placed
under arrest. Instead, Moorthy asked, "What happened, what happened" several
times and also questioned why was he being arrested.

8 Both Vignes and Moorthy were brought back to the Clementi Police Station. At
about 2.00pm, ASP Krishnan started to question Vignes in the presence of Sgt
Rajkumar. The questions and answers were recorded in ASP Krishnan’s field book
as follows:-

> Q1: Pointing to a red plastic bag containing the exhibit, I asked the
> accused, "What is this?"
>
> B1: "Kallu" (stone in Tamil).
>
> Q2: Who gave it to you?
>
> B2: He, Moorthy, gave it to me.
>
> Q3: What did he ask you to do with it (exhibit).
>
> A3: Moorthy asked me to hand it over to Thayiru. He also asked me to collect
> $8,000 from Thayiru.
>
> Q4: Showing the accused a passport with photograph, I asked him, is this
> Moorthy? Passport no. H581957 of Moorthy A/L Angappan was shown to the
> accused.
>
> A4: Yes, this is Moorthy.

9 Vignes signed against the above recording after it was read to him. Though
invited, he did not make any corrections. However, he later denied there was
such a conversation.

10 Both Vignes and Moorthy were sent for various tests. But no morphine was
present in their urine samples.

11 Later that day, at about 8.00pm, a s 122(6) statement was taken from
Vignes, where he stated –

> "The stuff do not belong to me. It belonged to the male Indian outside this
> office. His name is Moorthy. He was arrested after my arrest. Moorthy passed
> the stuff to me at my house in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. After he passed the
> stuff to me, he asked me to hand it over to Tahir and also gave me a phone
> number to call Tahir. I rang up Tahir and I asked him to wait for me in
> front of the mosque in Woodlands. Moorthy also asked me to collect S$8,000
> from Tahir after passing the stuff to Tahir. I went to the mosque and handed
> the stuff to Tahir. Tahir handed the money to me and I was arrested by the
> same person whom I believed to be Tahir. I do not know that the stuff was
> heroin. Moorthy told me the stuff were stones. I have not seen heroin
> before. When I was arrested, then only I knew it was some sort of drugs."

12 Subsequently on 24, 26 and 27 September 2001, three further statements were
obtained from Vignes which explained in detail how the drugs came into his
possession.

**Vignes’s defence**

13 We shall now turn to consider the defences of both appellants. As they each
sought to shift blame to the other, we shall deal with their defences
separately.

14 Vignes testified in his own defence at the trial. What he said is as
follows. He lived in Johor Bahru but worked in Singapore. On 15 September
2001, five days before the fateful day, he met with an accident while riding
on his motorcycle, and was injured. He was on medical leave until 19 September
2001. He had to get back to work the next day. He made an arrangement with a
friend, Jayacelan, to come and pick him up on the friend’s motorcycle.

15 On the evening of 19 September 2001, at about 8.30pm, Moorthy came to
Vignes’s house. Vignes was out visiting a temple at the time. His wife, sister
and uncle were at home. Moorthy waited for his return. We ought to mention
that there is a discrepancy here. In Vignes’s evidence in court he said that
his wife was with him at the temple but in his statements he said that his
wife was at home. Shortly, about half an hour later, Vignes returned. Because
Vignes was returning to work in Singapore the next day, Moorthy wanted him to
carry something, "sambrani kallu", to a friend, Tahir, in Yishun in Singapore.
Vignes was also asked to collect $8,000 from Tahir. Moorthy told Vignes that
the latter could call Tahir who would come to Woodlands to collect the things
from Vignes. Vignes was agreeable to doing this favour for Moorthy who then
said that he would bring the things later.

16 There was no sign of Moorthy until 2.00am when Vignes’s wife woke him up.
In his statements he said that Moorthy brought a white plastic bag with
another red plastic bag inside it. In his oral testimony, he said Moorthy gave
him a red plastic bag which was tied up. When Moorthy knocked on the door, it
was Vignes’s wife who heard it and woke him up. Moorthy also gave Vignes a
piece of paper, with Tahir’s handphone number written on it. Upon being asked
by Vignes, Moorthy said that inside the plastic bags were incense stones. So,
as far as Vignes was concerned, they were only incense stones. Vignes said he
thought the $8,000 was a loan from Tahir to Moorthy to enable the latter to
start up some businesses. However, we should add that in his statements he
said he thought Tahir owed Moorthy that sum. In his mind, the $8,000 could not
have been to "purchase" the incense stones. Vignes claimed that he left the
plastic bag in the hall and went back to sleep without, at any time, opening
the plastic bag to check its contents.

17 At 4.30am Vignes woke up and at 5.15am, he was on Jayacelan’s motorcycle as
a pillion rider heading for Singapore. He arrived at his place of work at
about 6.30am.

18 At about 8.00am, Vignes managed to contact Tahir, who agreed, if he could
borrow a car, to come over and collect the stuff at Vignes’s place of work
during the lunch break. About an hour later, Vignes informed Moorthy of the
arrangement made with Tahir. After working for a while, Vignes felt pain in
his injured leg and decided to take a half day leave and return home. He
borrowed a motorcycle from a relative and colleague, Vijayapuri (Vijay).
Vignes also called Tahir about the change of plan and told Tahir to meet him
at the Mosque at Woodlands in 30-45 minutes’ time.

19 As Vignes was riding along the Seletar Expressway, his motorcycle had a
puncture. He waited at the side of the road until a motorcyclist offered him a
lift to Woodlands. When Vignes arrived at the Mosque, no one in the vicinity
matched the description of Tahir. He used a public phone to call Tahir, who
said that he would be arriving in 10 to 15 minutes time, in a silver coloured
car with a certain registration number. After this call, Vignes made another
call to Moorthy, asking the latter to come down from Johor Bahru to deliver
the stuff himself to Tahir. Moorthy instructed Vignes to stay put and that he
would be coming over to Woodlands and fetch Vignes back to Johor.

20 A while later a silver coloured car with the specified number plate arrived
at the scene and an Indian man with long hair stepped out. The Indian man
walked towards him. After identifying themselves, Vignes took the plastic bag
out of his helmet and gave it to Sgt Rajkumar whom he thought was Tahir. He
then asked Sgt Rajkumar for the $8,000. Sgt Rajkumar took out a bundle of
notes and gave it to Vignes. Moments later, Vignes was arrested. Vignes said
that he told the officers that the things were "sambrani kallu" (a substance
used as incense for religious purposes), not just "kallu".

21 While seated in the CNB car, Vignes also told the officers that it was
Moorthy who asked him to deliver the plastic bag of "sambrani kallu" to Tahir.

**Moorthy’s defence**

22 Moorthy’s defence essentially was that he had nothing to do with the drugs
which Vignes had delivered to Sgt Rajkumar. He said that he never went to
Vignes’s house on 19 and 20 September 2001 and that he came down to Woodlands
on 20 September 2001 because Vignes had asked him to come to Singapore and
fetch Vignes back to Malaysia. Moorthy did that as a favour because Vignes’s
father had previously done him a good turn.

23 According to Moorthy, on 18 September 2001, Vignes called him and asked
whether he could lend Vignes a motorcycle, as Vignes was planning to return to
work in Singapore on 20 September 2001 and his own motorcycle was damaged in
the accident on 15 September 2001. However, Moorthy could not lend Vignes his
motorcycle, as he had not paid road tax on it. Moorthy told Vignes that he
would try to borrow a motorcycle from a friend.

24 At about 10.00am on 19 September 2001, Moorthy’s younger sister,
Arasakumari, and her husband, Ragu, came to his house. Subsequently, Moorthy,
his elder brother, Ponnusamy, and Ragu went to a government department to make
inquiries about the businesses of rearing quails and producing duck eggs, as
Moorthy and Ragu wanted to engage in these businesses. They returned to
Moorthy’s house at about 2.00 to 3.00pm and Ragu and his wife soon left after
that.

25 At about 6.00 pm that day, Moorthy and his wife and two children went to
his elder sister Puspah’s house, as he wanted to give a birthday present to
his seven year old nephew, Ganesan, whose birthday fell on 2 September 2001.
He explained that in fact, a birthday party for the nephew was held on 2
September, which Moorthy attended. But on that occasion he did not bring a
gift as he did not have any money to buy a present.

26 When they arrived at Puspah’s house, she was not at home as she was working
in Singapore. Puspah’s husband, Chandran, was also not there. When Moorthy
gave Ganesan the birthday present, the boy asked him for a treat and Moorthy
agreed to do so. He then called Ragu and told him to come over to Puspah’s
house as he was giving Ganesan a treat. He also asked Ragu to call Kumar, who
was the husband of Moorthy’s younger sister, Jayanthi.

27 Chandran subsequently returned home from work. When he learnt about the
treat, he asked Moorthy to buy some liquor. While he was out buying food and
drinks, Vignes called Moorthy to ask him about the motorcycle that Moorthy had
said that he would try to borrow for Vignes. He told Vignes that he would give
the latter a final answer after 8.00 pm. Following that, Moorthy called a
friend, Sashi, who refused to lend his motorcycle to Vignes.

28 At about 7.30pm, Moorthy returned to Puspah’s house, having bought the food
and drinks. The people whom he called had all arrived. Ragu had also bought
some food from Kentucky Fried Chicken. At about 8.30pm, Moorthy called Vignes
to inform the latter of his unsuccessful efforts to borrow a motorcycle for
him. As the background was rather noisy, Moorthy asked Vignes where the latter
was and was told by Vignes that he was at a temple. In turn, Moorthy informed
Vignes that he was at his sister’s place and was having a kind of birthday
get-together at her house.

29 Soon, the four men gathered to play cards while the women talked and
watched television. At about 11.00 pm the party ended. Moorthy and his family
went straight home. He watched some television programmes before going to bed
at around midnight. He slept through the night and did not wake up in the
middle of the night to go anywhere. He did not know anyone by the name of
Tahir.

30 The above version of the events given by Moorthy was that he did not visit
Vignes’s house on the evening of 19 September 2001. Neither did he bring the
plastic bag, with the drugs, over to the house in the wee hours of the morning
of 20 September 2002. Nor did he ask Vignes to collect money from anyone.

31 On 20 September 2001, between 9.00am and 10.00am, Vignes called Moorthy
from his place of work, asking the latter to give him a lift from Singapore to
Vignes’s house in Johor. Moorthy told Vignes that he could not do so
immediately as he might have to make a delivery for a customer. As agreed,
Vignes called again at about 12.30pm and he told Moorthy about his painful leg
and the punctured tyre and asked Moorthy to come and fetch him back from the
fruit shop at Woodlands. Moorthy said that he would try to borrow a motorcycle
from a friend to go over to Singapore. That was why he came over to Woodlands.
In fact, when he was at the Singapore checkpoint at about 1.00pm, Vignes
called again to find out where he was. But when he arrived at the fruitshop,
Vignes was nowhere in sight. Soon, two CNB officers came from behind and
arrested him. Upon interrogation he told them that he was waiting for a
friend. He could not remember whether the officers asked for the friend’s name
or whether he had mentioned any. The officers also searched his motorcycle and
found nothing. In turn, he also asked them why he was being arrested.

32 Moorthy explained that he was willing to do the favour for Vignes because
the latter’s father had in 1998 done a kind deed to his family, namely,
Vignes’s father had come down all the way from Perak to Seremban to render
assistance when Moorthy’s then pregnant wife, his mother and his younger
brother were involved in an accident. The occurrence of this event was not
disputed.

33 In support of his evidence as to what occurred on 19 and 20 September 2001,
Moorthy called his wife, Satyabama, his sister, Arasakumari and her husband,
Ragu to testify. They substantially corroborated his version of events and
confirmed that Moorthy was with them on the evening of 19 September 2001 and
could not have visited Vignes’s house at about 8.30pm.

**Consideration of Vignes’s defence**

34 It would be seen that the defence of Vignes was one of lack of knowledge.
He asserted that he did not know that the things he was delivering on behalf
of Moorthy were drugs. He thought they were "sambrani kallu". He claimed to
have been made use of by Moorthy.

35 The trial judge did not believe that Vignes was the innocent carrier that
he claimed to be. The facts giving rise to his arrest as recounted by the
prosecution witnesses and he himself were largely the same. In the view of the
trial judge, the following aspects of the case pointed to the guilt of
Vignes:-

> (i) At about 12.30pm that day, Sgt Rajkumar received a call from one
> "Vignesh" who also informed the former that the place of transaction had
> been changed from the Marsiling MRT Station to Woodlands as his motocycle
> had broken down. Sgt Rajkumar informed "Vignesh" of the colour and the
> number of the vehicle he would be travelling in to arrive at Woodlands. And
> when Sgt Rajkumar arrived at the appointed place, Vignes was staring at the
> car and the transaction was effected. This clearly showed that Vignes was
> the person who spoke to Sgt Rajkumar at about 12.30pm.
>
> (ii) The conversation that took place between Sgt Rajkumar and Vignes when
> they met to effect the transaction was very telling. This has been quoted at
> ¶5 above. Why should Vignes be so careful as to ask Sgt Rajkumar "How, can u
> trust the male Chinese in the car" if the things which Vignes was delivering
> to Sgt Rajkumar were indeed incense? The question was entirely out of place.
> Furthermore, when Sgt Rajkumar asked Vignes if the stuff was good, his
> answer was "It’s very good. U watch and see. You are sure to come back to
> deal with me again." Clearly, this answer was wholly inconsistent with
> Vignes’s claim that he thought he was delivering "sambrani kallu" to Tahir
> on behalf of Moorthy.
>
> (iii) Vignes was asked to deliver the stuff and also to collect $8,000. In
> Vignes’s statement of 24 September 2001, he stated that "(Moorthy) also did
> not explain to me why I (had to) collect so much money for the stones." By
> this statement Vignes was suggesting that he was to collect $8,000 for the
> stones. He would have known that the stones (if they were incense) would not
> be of such a high value. Moreover, even if that statement was meant to
> suggest that he was not told what the $8,000 payment was for, it was
> inconsistent with what he stated in court where he explained that the $8,000
> was a loan from Tahir to Moorthy to enable the latter to start up some
> chicken and duck businesses. Vignes never mentioned this in any of his
> statements. This seemed like an _ex-post facto_ concoction. Here again, it
> would be pertinent to refer to the conversation which took place between
> Vignes and Sgt Rajkumar when they first met at Woodlands –
>

>> "V: Where’s the money.

>>

>> Raj: With my partner (pointing to Sgt Daniel

>>

>> Gan who was in the driver’s seat).

>>

>> Raj: Where’s the stuff.

>>

>> V: I have put it in front, near the mosque.

>>

>> Take the money and follow me."

Clearly, from this conversation, the $8,000 was meant to be in exchange for
the drugs.

36 We have carefully considered the arguments made on behalf of Vignes that
the trial judge should have accepted his explanation that he did not know that
the things in the plastic bag given to him by Moorthy were drugs. Vignes’s
counsel also contended that the written recording made by Sgt Rajkumar of the
oral conversation between Vignes and Sgt Rajkumar at the place of transaction
was not accurate, as it was not made contemporaneously and neither did Vignes
sign against it. But in none of his written statements did Vignes ever refer
to the stuff in the plastic bag as "sambrani kallu", meaning incense. This is
most significant. He merely referred to "kallu", meaning stones, and which in
street jargon means sachets of heroin in granular form.

37 It is clear that the trial judge accepted the evidence of Sgt Rajkumar as
to his conversation with Vignes when they first met at the Mosque at
Woodlands. The trial judge had the benefit of hearing the witnesses. There is
no basis for us to take a different view.

38 Looking at the totality of the evidence, we endorse the finding of the
court below that Vignes knew that he was transporting drugs for sale. His
appeal is dismissed.

**Issues raised by Moorthy**

39 At the close of the prosecution’s case, Moorthy submitted that there was no
case for him to answer. Counsel for Moorthy reiterated this same point before
us that the trial judge erred in calling upon Moorthy to enter on his defence.

40 The second issue raised by Moorthy is that the trial judge was wrong in not
accepting his defence of alibi.

**Should Moorthy’s defence have been called?**

41 At the close of the prosecution’s case, the only "evidence" that implicated
Moorthy was Vignes’s statements. The contention of Moorthy on this issue is
that Vignes’s statements did not amount to confessions, and, if the trial
judge were to disregard the statements as he should have, there would not have
been any sufficient basis to call upon Moorthy to enter on his defence. Under
s 30 of the Evidence Act a statement of an accused person can be used as
evidence against a co-accused only if it amounts to a confession against the
maker.

42 Moorthy contended that Vignes’s statements did not amount to a confession
because Vignes stated that what he had agreed to deliver on Moorthy’s behalf
to Tahir were not drugs but were some innocuous "stones". Thus, Vignes did not
admit to any wrongdoing or to the charge preferred against him.

43 Section 17(2) of the Evidence Act provides that "a confession is an
admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or
suggesting the inference that he committed that offence."

44 The test to be applied in determining whether a statement is a confession
was elucidated by the Privy Council in _Anandagoda v The Queen_ (1962) 28 MLJ
289 as follows:-

> The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to
> the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the
> circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement
> that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that
> he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it
> must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts …
> It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to
> look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge
> in evidence at the trial. But equally it is irrelevant to consider whether
> the accused intended to make a confession. If the facts in the statement
> added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the
> offence then it is nonetheless a confession although the accused at the same
> time protests his innocence."

45 This Court had the occasion to examine this very question in the case
_Abdul Rashid v PP_ [1994] 1 SLR 119 where an accused made a similar sort of
statement to the present. There this Court clarified that for a statement to
amount to a confession it need not be of an unqualified nature. The important
thing is that the statement must connect the accused in some way with the
offence.

46 Counsel for Moorthy sought to narrow the scope of the decision in _Abdul
Rashid_ arguing that it should be confined to the facts of that case where the
first appellant was charged with trafficking drugs and the second appellant
with abetting the first appellant, and, while the first appellant stated that
he did not know the package handed over to him by the second appellant
contained drugs, he knew that he was involved in smuggling activities as he
was being paid for the job. Furthermore, he was told to hide it under the
dashboard of the car. He also did not state what he thought the substance was.
Counsel submitted that in such circumstances it was correct for the court in
that case to find that the statement amounted to a confession.

47 We think that the distinction sought to be drawn by Moorthy’s counsel
between _Abdul Rashid_ and the present case is wholly without merit. In _Abdul
Rashid,_ the first appellant denied knowledge that what he was carrying were
drugs. The circumstances in that case might well be suspicious, or they might
suggest that he had committed some other offences, but the fact remained that
he denied knowledge of the drugs, very much like the case here. Moreover, this
argument of Moorthy’s counsel would run counter to one very critical stricture
laid down in _Anandagoda,_ that the statement must be considered on its own
terms without reference to extrinsic facts.

48 We would also mention that in the later case _Tong Chee Kong v PP_ [1998] 2
SLR 843, the approach adopted in _Abdul Rashid_ was followed. There, the two
appellants, Tay and Tong, were charged that, in furtherance of their common
intention, they had in their possession for the purpose of trafficking a
packet of diamorphine. Tay admitted in his statements that he received the
drugs from Tong, but claimed that he needed a supply of heroin for his own
consumption and that Tong had sold him a pound of heroin for $3,000. The Court
of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that Tay’s statements amounted to
confessions, as he had admitted in the statements that he had taken delivery
of the drugs and was in possession of the drugs and this unequivocally
connected him with the offence. The court came to this conclusion
notwithstanding that Tay denied that he possessed the drugs for the purpose of
trafficking. The confession was subsequently used against Tong in convicting
him of the offence charged.

49 Moorthy further submitted that the trial judge was wrong to have applied
the minimum evaluation test enunciated in _Ng Theng Shuang v PP_ [1995] 2 SLR
36 in determining whether Vignes’s statements amounted to confessions. This
was what the trial judge said (at ¶94):-

> "Bearing in mind that only a minimum evaluation of the evidence was required

50 In our opinion, the first sentence in the above paragraph of the judgment
was merely a re-statement of the law as enunciated in _Haw Tua Tau v PP_
[1981] 2 MLJ 49, i.e., that the court should not at the close of the
prosecution’s case go into a detailed evaluation of the evidence. As for
Vignes’s statements, the trial judge stated quite clearly in the next sentence
that the statements amounted to confessions.

51 The next criticism levelled by Moorthy’s counsel relates to the trial
judge’s reliance on the presumption under the Misuse of Drugs Act to determine
that the statements of Vignes were confessions (at ¶95):-

> B2’s (Moorthy’s) counsel expressed his concern that a man accused of
> molesting a woman could be held to have confessed to the offence simply
> because he said he did come into contact with the woman but claimed that it
> was accidental. However, offences falling under the Misuse of Drugs Act are
> different from other offences in that there are presumptions in the Act
> which assert a certain state of facts or of knowledge until it is proved to
> the contrary by the defence. Therefore, since B1 (Vignes) had admitted he
> was in possession of the plastic bag containing the drugs, he was presumed
> to be in possession of the drugs and to have known the nature of the drugs
> despite his protestations to the contrary in the same statements."

Counsel submitted that such a reliance was wrong.

52 Vignes’s statements clearly showed that he delivered the plastic bag
containing drugs to Sgt Rajkumar, whom he thought was Tahir. While in
accordance with _Anandagoda_ the court must ignore extrinsic facts to
determine whether a statement amounted to a confession, it does not mean that
it should not be viewed in the light of the applicable law, i.e., the
presumptions laid down in the Misuse of Drugs Act. In our opinion, the effect
of a statement must be viewed within the framework of the law. By virtue of
the Act, Vignes was presumed to have known the nature of the substance he was
carrying notwithstanding his protestation to the contrary. As declared by the
Privy Council in _Anandagoda,_ protestation of innocence did not mean that a
statement could not be a confession. Accordingly, his statements clearly came
within the scope of "stating or suggesting the inference that (Vignes)
committed that offence" laid down in s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. Thus, they
connected him with the offence for which he was charged and were confessions.

**Defence of alibi**

53 Turning to the second issue, counsel for Moorthy submitted that the trial
judge should have accepted his evidence and that of his witnesses that he
never visited Vignes’s home on 19 September 2001 and that he never handed any
packages to Vignes for delivery to Tahir. He contended that the trial judge
gave undue weight to certain discrepancies between what he stated in his
statements and in court:-

> (i) In his statements, Moorthy said he was at his sister’s home between
> 6.00pm to 11.00pm on 19 September 2001. He did not state that he left the
> sister’s house to buy food for some 30-45 minutes. Instead, he stated that
> he did not go anywhere else. Counsel argued that this omission is wholly
> insignificant bearing in mind that his going to buy food and drinks was in
> relation to the merry-making in the sister’s home. He was not really going
> anywhere as such.
>
> (ii) In his statement, Moorthy said he "was helping in the preparation of
> his (sister’s) son’s birthday dinner". Counsel submitted that there was
> nothing very inaccurate in that. Moorthy did go out and buy food to have a
> casual birthday treat for his nephew. It was only a matter of language used
> in the course of interpretation in taking down the statement.

There was nothing unusual about gathering a few close families together at
short-notice for an impromptu meal just to make a young nephew happy.

54 Next, Counsel submitted that Vignes’s evidence was incredible in some
respects. First, why should Moorthy come to his house in the presence of so
many people to request for such a favour? The request could have been made
over the phone. Why didn’t Vignes call Moorthy when the latter did not return
with the things before Vignes went to sleep?

55 Second, it was most unusual that when Moorthy knocked at the door of the
house at 2.00 am, it was not the two sisters of Vignes, who slept in the hall,
who heard it but Vignes’s wife who was sleeping with him in a room with the
door closed.

56 Third, in his statement, Vignes said Moorthy handed to him a white plastic
bag. In court, he stated it was a red plastic bag and explained that the red
plastic bag was inside the white plastic bag.

57 Fourth, according to Sgt Rajkumar the deal to buy the one pound of drugs at
$8,000/- was only struck on 20 September 2001 and yet, on Vignes’s evidence,
Moorthy had, on 19 September 2001, asked Vignes to collect $8,000 from the
buyer.

58 Fifth, according to Jayacelan, who gave Vignes the ride on 20 September
2001 from Johor to Vignes’s work place in Singapore, Vignes carried only one
red plastic bag to work that morning and not a white plastic bag. In
Jayacelan’s mind that red plastic bag would have contained food. Vignes’s wife
also said that she had prepared food for him. This evidence contradicted
Vignes’s evidence that Moorthy gave him a white plastic bag in the wee hours
of 20 September 2001. Furthermore, the CNB officers testified that a white
plastic bag containing drugs was seized from Vignes. So the white plastic bag
could not have been brought into Singapore on 20 September 2001. It must have
been brought into Singapore much earlier. In this regard, it must be borne in
mind that it was a week earlier that Sgt Rajkumar was told by his informer
that a Malaysian syndicate of Indians was looking to sell a pound of heroin.

59 Sixth, if it were true that it was Moothy who made use of Vignes to deliver
the drugs to Tahir, why should he expose himself so willingly by coming over
to Singapore just because Vignes said that his leg had become painful?

60 Seventh, Vignes testified that he told Sgt Rajkumar at the encounter
outside the Mosque that "Moorthy annai" was on his way. But Sgt Rajkumar’s
account of that conversation contained no reference to "Moorthy annai". Vignes
also claimed that after his arrest and while in the CNB car he told Sgt
Rajkumar of "Moorthy annai". But Sgt Rajkumar’s evidence was that the name
"Moorthy" was not mentioned by Vignes.

61 Counsel for Moorthy also pointed to one other piece of evidence of Vignes
to show that the latter was not a reliable witness. Vignes said that while he
and Moorthy were at Clementi Police Station, Moorthy had asked him not to
implicate him. Vignes also said that Sgt Rajkumar permitted them to speak to
each other. This could not be true as law enforcement agencies never allow
suspects to talk to each other.

62 Counsel for Moorthy accepted that where an alibi defence is raised, the
accused has the evidential burden of proof. However, this burden is not on a
balance of probabilities but only to raise a reasonable doubt. In our view,
this submission is correct. This Court had in _Ramakrishnan s/o Ramayan v PP_
[1998] 3 SLR 645 stated (at p.653) that "an acquittal must follow from
reasonable doubt that the appellant might have been elsewhere at the material
time."

63 Counsel further criticised the trial judge for saying "it was incredible
that (Vignes) could not even take public transport across the Causeway that
day." He said that Singapore taxis were not allowed into Johor. If Vignes were
to take a bus back he would have to get off the bus and walk through the
Singapore and Malaysian immigration checkpoints. This would be something
Vignes would want to avoid in view of the fact that his leg was hurting. If
Vignes were to be travelling as a pillion rider on a motorcycle he would be
able to clear the checkpoints of both countries while remaining seated.
Counsel said that Moorthy was, by nature, a helpful person. He even came to
Singapore on 16 September 2001 with an uncle of Vignes to retrieve Vignes’s
motorcycle which was damaged in the 15 September 2001 accident. So it was
entirely in line with Moorthy’s desire to help that he came over upon Vignes’s
request.

64 In our judgment, all the above arguments do not necessarily suggest that
Moorthy was innocent of the drug trafficking transaction that Vignes was
involved in. For example, taking the second point, the evidence was that the
hall of Vignes’s home was small. The door of Vignes’s room opened to the hall.
Ordinarily, one would agree that the person sleeping in the hall should hear
the knocks rather than a person sleeping in a room with the door closed. But
the fact is that some people sleep like a log while others wake up at the
slightest vibration. One of the sisters, Kogilam, testified that she was a
deep sleeper. She found it very difficult to wake up. She also said that the
sister who slept with her in the hall was also a deep sleeper.

65 Next, taking the fifth point regarding what Jayacelan saw as to the colour
of the plastic bag which Vignes was holding while the latter was the pillion
rider on the morning of 20 September 2001, it must be remembered that
Jayacelan said that he was quite sleepy that morning and he did not notice
whether Vignes was carrying any bag with him when Vignes left his own home and
approached Jayacelan. In fact, he did not pay any attention to what Vignes was
carrying until the upper portion of the red plastic bag touched his head when
Vignes was boarding the motorcycle. In fact, he did not know if there was a
tupperware container in the plastic bag. Neither did he feel that there was
something hard inside the bag. In truth, he did not know what was in the bag.

66 Taking another example, the sixth point mentioned above, if it were true
that Moorthy was making use of Vignes to deliver the drugs for him even though
Vignes was at that point of time suffering pain from an injured leg, that
might well be the reason why he felt morally compelled to answer Vignes’s call
for help. Furthermore, perhaps he thought it was safe for him to come over as
he was not in possession of the drugs. As they were quite close and he was
kind to Vignes in the past, he probably did not anticipate that, when the heat
was on, Vignes would point a finger at him.

67 At the end of the day the question before the trial judge was one of fact:
did Moorthy give the drugs to Vignes for the latter to pass on to Tahir? Thus
the alibi issue became crucial. The trial judge, having carefully weighed the
evidence adduced by Moorthy and his witnesses, came to the conclusion that it
was highly unlikely that there was a sort of birthday celebration on 19
September 2001 in the home of his sister Puspah. Moorthy’s statement of 27
September 2001 seemed to suggest that a birthday celebration was held on 19
September 2001. Instead, it was really only an impromptu treat for the young
nephew. Moreover, in his statement of 7 March 2002, instead of indicating the
precise date of the nephew’s birthday, he stated that the birthday was "a few
days prior to 19 September 2001". That was really stretching the expression "a
few days". He seemed to be trying to give the impression that this was a
slightly delayed birthday celebration. But there was already a birthday
celebration for the nephew on 2 September 2001. We cannot fault the finding of
the trial judge on this point. Indeed, the judge was conscious that the family
witnesses for Vignes and Moorthy would naturally want to help their own man
and had weighed the evidence carefully.

68 Another fact which the trial judge took into account against Moorthy was
his reluctance to give to the CNB officers the name of the friend he was
waiting for outside the fruitshop at Woodlands. If his purpose of being there
was wholly innocent, as he claimed it to be, then there should have been no
difficulty in providing the name. At the time he would not have known the
status of the transaction that Vignes was asked to undertake. His silence
could only mean that he did not want to give any information which might
prejudice either himself or Vignes.

69 Before we conclude, we should mention that, in Moorthy’s counsel’s
submission, the theory was advanced that the person who probably gave the
drugs to Vignes was Vijay who, as stated above, is a relative of Vignes and
whose motorcycle Vignes had, on 20 September 2001, borrowed to get to
Woodlands. Vijay was called by Vignes to testify but his evidence was rejected
by the trial judge as being unreliable. Unfortunately, apart from this
assertion there is nothing else to link Vijay to the drugs. The theory is no
more than a conjecture.

70 In the result, the trial judge was satisfied that Moorthy was the person
who handed the drugs over to Vignes for delivery to Tahir. There is really no
basis for us to conclude that the finding of guilt by the trial judge on the
part of Moorthy is wrong. We would accordingly also dismiss Moorthy’s appeal.
