**Judgment:**

1\. In 1993 one Chua Puay Kiang ("Chua") sued Singapore Telecommunications Ltd
("Singtel") and two other defendants in Suit 2103 of 1993 ("the 1993 action").
Chua was adjudicated a bankrupt on 13 February 1998. The trial was adjourned
for the purpose of obtaining the sanction of the Official Assignee to proceed.
An application was made on 25 June 1998 to change the name of the plaintiff in
the 1993 action from Chua Puay Kiang to "The Official Assignee of the Estate
of Chua Puay Kiang (a bankrupt)". The application was allowed and the trial
resumed and parties made their final submissions to the trial judge. On 30
October 1998 the judge made the following order:

> "The plaintiff’s claim be dismissed with one set of costs payable to the
> defendants".

2\. Singtel commenced this present originating summons before me against the
Official Assignee as defendant for a declaration that when the Official
Assignee becomes a litigant in an action at law, he is liable in the same way
as any other litigant as to costs. Secondly, for a declaration that the
Official Assignee is liable to pay the cots in the 1993 action and thirdly,
for an order that the costs be so paid.

3\. It was submitted by Mr. Lee Cheow Han on behalf of the Official Assignee
that the costs should be paid by a third party guarantor. International
Information Service Pte Ltd subsequently agreed to bear the costs. Mr. Lee
submitted that the third party’s undertaking was given pursuant to the
direction of the Registrar, Supreme Court and that the Official Assignee did
not ask for that undertaking.

4\. Mr. Michael Hwang SC, appeared on behalf of Singtel and argued that the
costs are payable by the Official Assignee. The parties exchanged written
submissions on the question as they perceived it to be, namely, whether the
Official Assignee is obliged to pay the costs personally.

5\. For what appears to be a straightforward matter, it came up for judicial
adjudication in a most unusual way, and I shall revert to this point after I
deal with the meaning and effect of the trial judge’s order.

6\. The judgment extracted by the defendants has no ambiguity. When a judge
rules that the plaintiff pays the costs to the defendant he means just that.
In this case, when the judgment was handed down on 30 October 1998 there was
no doubt who the plaintiff was. It was the Official Assignee. The court was
not concerned whether the Official Assignee pays the costs out of own funds
(that is, the funds available to the office of the Official Assignee, and not
the personal funds of the officer who holds that position, obviously), or from
the estate of the bankrupt, or from some third party guarantor.

7\. How the Official Assignee arranges funds for the payment of costs of
litigation in such cases is usually not made known to the court and, indeed,
the court is not concerned with that. If the Official Assignee does not
sanction the continuation of the legal proceedings, the proceedings come to an
end, effectively.

8\. However, there will be cases where the Official Assignee may take a
favourable view of the action which, in his opinion, enlarge the wealth of the
bankrupt’s estate to the benefit of the estate and its creditors if
successful. In such cases, he has the discretion to sanction the continuation
of the proceedings. He will often require the comfort of a third party’s
guarantee as to costs. If no such guarantee is forthcoming, the Official
Assignee will have to decide whether it is still in the best interests of the
estate and its creditors to continue the legal proceedings. If he is of the
view that it is he may give his sanction and the proceedings carry on. In both
circumstances the opposing party is entitled to apply to the court for
security for his costs.

9\. In this case, it appears from the affidavits filed that some arrangements
were made for a third party company to guarantee the payment of costs, but
this was not an order for security to be provided in substitution of any
primary liability for costs. In this case, the undertaking as to costs was
given by the third party to the Official Assignee. That letter dated 8 June
1998 recites as follows:

> "We hereby irrevocably undertake to pay your legal costs in respect of the
> above action.
>
> This was required pursuant to an order of the learned Registrar Mr. Chiam
> Boon Keng made on 28 May 1998."

10\. That letter constitutes the undertaking by the third party to pay "the
legal costs" of the Official Assignee. It does not relieve the Official
Assignee of any liability to pay costs if such costs were ordered against him.

11\. The judgment of the trial judge carried an unequivocal order that the
plaintiff pay the costs of the defendants. The Official Assignee, being the
plaintiff, is therefore obliged to effect payment. In this regard, it will be
useful to remind ourselves in which mode was the Official Assignee performing
his duty. As Cozens-Hardy MR said in _Re Arthur_ [1913] 2 KB 88, 93:

> when an Official Receiver "is simply performing duties which are obligatory
> upon him in a judicial, or quasi-judicial, character, he is not to be made
> to pay costs, because he is acting in the performance of his official duty;
> but whenever the moment comes when he does that which he is under no
> obligation to do, although he is empowered to do it if he thinks fit, and
> has a right to do it, then his protection as a judicial officer, or a person
> of a semi-judicial character, ceases, and the court has the same
> jurisdiction to deal with him as with anybody else".

12\. Elsewhere at page 98, Hamilton L.J. expressed the point in these terms:

> "where the official receiver’s function involve his taking up the position
> of a litigant he in general does so at his own peril as to costs, and there
> is nothing in the Rules to relieve him of that incident in connection with
> such an application as this."

13\. I now revert to the point I alluded to above in respect of this unusual
application before me. Where, as it must be clear to all at the outset, that
the order to pay costs was made expressly against the plaintiff in the 1993
action, the successful defendant merely had to proceed with enforcement
proceedings if the plaintiff fails to pay. Mr. Hwang produced before me the
authority of _Re Sassoon Ezekiel_ [1933] MLJ 264 in which costs were ordered
against the Official Assignee which he failed to satisfy and the successful
party took out a Writ of Seizure and Sale against the Official Assignee.
Huggard CJ refused the application of the Official Assignee to set aside the
Writ of Seizure and Sale.

14\. The point I wish to express here is that where a party takes a particular
view as to how a rule of law or an order of court is to be applied he proceeds
forthwith as he may be advised by his counsel. If he is wrong he bears the
consequences accordingly. He ought not to seek the opinion of the court
whether his proposed action is lawful or correct. It is not the function of
the court to render opinions in this way. That is the function of the
solicitor. If he thinks or advises that a particular order of court is not
clear the proper procedure is to seek a clarification from the judge who made
it. If he thinks that the order was wrong, his recourse lay in an appeal to a
superior court.

15\. Courts do not make declarations merely to state the obvious to give
comfort to a party that a course of action he proposes to take is the correct
one in law. A declaration will be made only if it will resolve a specific
dispute between the parties when that dispute has come to a boil. That is to
say, the parties have done all that needs to be done and a genuine dispute as
to the rights and entitlement of the parties have clearly arisen to which
nothing else can be done except to proceed to court for adjudication. In this
case, there is no doubt a dispute between the plaintiff (Singtel) and the
defendant (the Official Assignee) but the plaintiff ought to have commenced
enforcement proceedings to enforce its judgment against the Official Assignee
who they say the judgment was directed against. The court’s intervention need
only be invoked when, and if, the Official Assignee applies to set aside the
enforcement proceedings. The prolixity of the orders sought from me under this
OS is manifest. The trial judge had ordered the plaintiff (the Official
Assignee) to pay costs. Mr. Hwang now wants me to declare that that it so.
Given his interpretation of the order, this Originating Summons was
unnecessary. The fact that I agree with his interpretation does not justify
this application before me. How he is to enforce the order of the court in the
1993 action is a matter for Mr. Hwang to advise his clients.

16\. For the reasons that I had just set out, I will make no order in respect
of this Originating Summons.
