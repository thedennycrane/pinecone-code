: This case arose from the alleged medical negligence of the first and second
defendants. Goh Jik Lian (the deceased) was admitted into the second
defendant`s hospital for a routine thyroid operation, which was performed on
18 October 1999. After the operation, the deceased`s wound showed signs of
post-operative bleeding which required him to undergo further surgery. The
first defendant, who was then the attendant anaesthetist, decided to intubate
the deceased. This involved inserting a tube into the deceased`s airway to
deliver oxygen to the deceased once he was unconscious. Due to the
inexperience of the operating theatre staff, a plastic cap was affixed to one
of the pieces of equipment used for the intubation; the resulting blockage
caused the deceased to receive insufficient oxygen until the obstruction was
discovered and removed, by which time it was too late. The deceased suffered
irreversible brain damage and died a week later.  
  
On 28 February 2000, the plaintiff in this case (who was the wife of the
deceased) commenced these proceedings against the first and second defendants,
alleging medical negligence and claiming damages. However, the plaintiff had
yet to extract letters of administration at that date. On 29 September 2000,
the first defendant`s lawyers applied, by way of SIC 603982/2000 (the
application) for certain preliminary issues to be determined under O 14 r 12
of the Rules of Court. The preliminary issues, which pertained to the
plaintiff`s locus standi to commence and maintain these proceedings, were as
follows:

(i) whether the plaintiff was entitled to maintain the proceedings when they
were commenced before the expiration of six months from the date of the death
of the deceased;

(ii) whether the plaintiff was entitled to commence the proceedings before the
extraction of the grant of letters of administration  
  
Just before the hearing of the application, both defendants admitted liability
to the claim. Consequently, the only issue left for determination in these
proceedings related to the quantum of damages to be awarded.  
  
On 9 October 2000, the application was dismissed by the assistant registrar,
who held that the plaintiff did have locus standi to commence these
proceedings. Being dissatisfied with her decision, the defendants appealed to
a judge-in-chambers by way of RA 600313/2000 (the appeal). I dismissed the
appeal although I directed counsel for the plaintiff to amend the title to the
action, the endorsement of claim as well as the statement of claim to make it
clear that her client`s claim was as a dependant and not as an administrator,
of the deceased`s estate.  
  
Being dissatisfied with my decision, counsel for the defendants wrote in for
further arguments which request I acceded to. Having reviewed the matter after
hearing counsel`s further submissions, I now affirm my earlier decision and I
set out my reasons for so doing.  
  
**_Section 20(4) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Ed) (`the Act`)_**

****

Section 20(4) of the Act (1999 Ed) reads as follows:

> _If -_

> _
>
> (a) there is no executor or administrator of the deceased; or
>
> (b) no action is brought within six months after the death by and in the
> name of an executor or administrator of the deceased,
>
> _

> _the action may be brought by and in the name of all or any of the persons
> for whose benefit an executor or administrator could have brought it._

  
  
In support of their case that the plaintiff had no locus standi to bring this
action, the defendants argued that limbs (a) and (b) of s 20(4) should be
given a conjunctive interpretation. In other words, the defendants are saying
that the plaintiff can bring an action under s 20(4) only if there is no
executor/administrator **_and_** no action has been brought within six months
of the death of the deceased. In the present case, limb (a) was satisfied, in
that no administrator had been appointed at the time the proceedings were
commenced. However, it was argued for the defendants that the proceedings ran
foul of limb (b) as, they were commenced within six months of death. The
defendants contended that in order for limb (b) to have been satisfied, the
plaintiff had to wait for six months to lapse before commencing these
proceedings. Hence, the defendants submitted, this claim should be dismissed
and a fresh action started. In support of this proposition, counsel for the
defendants cited **Ling Kee Ling v Leow Leng Siong** [1992] 2 SLR 725 , which
authority counsel for the plaintiff sought to distinguish.  
  
The headnotes and the relevant holdings in that case read as follows:

> _The appellant`s husband died as a result of a traffic accident in 1986 when
> the vehicle in which he was a passenger collided into a lorry. In 1989, the
> appellant sued the respondent, who was the driver of the vehicle, and the
> second defendant as the owner of the vehicle, claiming damages in respect of
> loss of support to herself and to the deceased`s daughter, and special
> damages. By 1 August 1989, pleadings were deemed to be closed, after the
> defence of the two defendants were filed. However, the appellant did not
> take out a summons for directions within one month after close of pleadings,
> that is, by 1 September 1989. The limitation period for bringing such an
> action expired on 18 December 1989. Five months later, the respondent
> applied for the action to be dismissed._

> _The learned senior assistant registrar dismissed the application with costs
> fixed at $350. On appeal, the High Court allowed the appeal and dismissed
> the appellant`s claim, on the grounds that the appellant did not have the
> locus standi to bring the claim, and also decided that the claim should be
> struck out for want of prosecution. The appellant appealed:_

> _**Held** , allowing the appeal:_

> _
>
> (1) Even before the 1987 amendments, s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30)
> (1970 Ed) permitted the dependants of a deceased person to bring an action
> for their own benefit in the circumstances set out in s 12(8). By virtue of
> s 12(8), the appellant was clearly entitled to bring the claim in the

>
> _

  
  
Counsel for the defendants had focussed on the following extract from Chua J`s
judgment (at p 727) to buttress his submission that the plaintiff lacked locus
standi:

> _By virtue of s 12(8), the appellant was clearly entitled to bring the claim
> in the present case. The deceased had died intestate and no administrator
> had ever been appointed over his estate. At any rate, the claim would have
> been well-founded even if there had been an administrator, since when the
> action was brought, more than a year had elapsed from the time of the
> deceased`s death and no action had been brought by the administrator._

  
  
I am of the view that the defendants` argument for a conjunctive
interpretation, relying on the extract from and the above, case is flawed.
First and foremost, a plain interpretation shows that a **_disjunctive_**
interpretation should be adopted, namely, a plaintiff can commence proceedings
**_either_** when there is **_no_** executor/administrator or when, despite
there being an executor/administrator, no action is commenced within the six
month period following death. Such a disjunctive interpretation flows more
naturally from the use of the word `or` between limbs (a) and (b) rather than
the word `and`.  
  
Secondly, while limb (a) refers to a situation where there is no
executor/administrator, limb (b) contemplates a situation where no action is
brought by an executor/administrator. Thus it seems that limb (b), in
contradistinction to limb (a), presupposes the existence of an
executor/administrator. Limb (b) should thus not prevent an action from being
brought when there is no executor/administrator in existence at the time the
action is commenced by the plaintiff. I am fortified in my conclusion by a
consideration of the legislative history of s 20(4) of the Act. The
predecessor of this section was s 12(8) of the Civil Law Act (1985 Ed) which
reads where relevant as follows:

> _If there is no executor of the deceased person or**there being such
> executor** , no action as in this section mentioned has, within one year
> after the death of such deceased person, been brought by the executor, such
> action may be brought by all or any of the persons, if more than one, for
> whose benefit such action would have been brought if it had been brought by
> the executor ... [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
It is evident from its wording that the second limb of s 12(8) was clearly
meant to apply to situations where a personal representative already existed.
Section 12(8) was subsequently repealed by Act 11 of 1987, and substituted
with a provision identical in wording to s 20(4) of (the current version of)
the Act. In the second reading of the bill for Act 11 of 1987, the Minister of
Law commented on several changes introduced by the amendments, but nothing was
said about the amendment to s 12(8) [see Parliamentary Reports, 4 March 1987].
In fact, there was no indication whatsoever in the Parliamentary Reports that
the legislature had, by replacing s 12(8) with the wording now found in s
20(4) of the Act, intended to bring about such a radical change that the
provision should now be given the construction that the defendants are
advocating. Rather, it appears that all Act 11 of 1987 did was to come up with
a more concise provision, while shortening the moratorium period from one year
to six months.  
  
My conclusion therefore is, that s 20(8) should be read disjunctively. A
dependent can bring an action so long as limb (a) is satisfied (when there is
no executor/administrator). It matters not that the action is commenced within
six months of death, since limb (b), which imposes the six month moratorium,
only applies to situations where an executor/administrator exists at the time
of commencement of the action. There was thus nothing in the present case
which precluded the plaintiff from commencing her action within six months of
her husband`s death.  
  
**_Premature actions_**

****

Even if I am wrong in my construction of s 20(4), and the plaintiff is deemed
to have commenced these proceedings prematurely, I see no reason why I should
dismiss the action purely on that ground alone. I have found an authority
directly on point, which neither counsel cited to me. The case is **Austin &
Ors v Hart** [1983] 2 AC 640 which centred on s 8(2) of Trinidad & Tobago`s
Compensation for Injuries Ordinance. The provision, which is **_in pari
materia_** with our s 20(4), reads:

> _If there be no executor or administrator of the person deceased, or if
> although there be such executor or administrator no such action shall,
> within six months after the death of such deceased person, have been brought
> by and in the name of his executor or administrator, then and in every such
> case such action may be brought by and in the name or names of all or any of
> the persons (if more than one) for whose benefit such action would have been
> if it had been brought by and in the name of such executor or
> administrator._

  
  
In that case, the plaintiff`s husband died on 4 May 1974 as a result of a car
accident. The plaintiff sued the defendant in August 1974 (ie only about three
months after the death of her husband). When she commenced the action, there
already was an executor in existence. After the one year time-bar for
commencing an action had commenced, the defendant amended his defence, and
pleaded that the plaintiff had no locus standi to maintain the action by
virtue of s 8(2) of the Trinidad and Tobago Ordinance. Lord Templeman,
delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held (at p 647):

> _Section 8(2) of the Ordinance does not expressly invalidate any action by a
> dependant within six months of the death if at the date of the writ there
> exists an executor or administrator. By 4 November 1974, it was certain that
> the dependants were entitled to bring proceedings, because it was certain
> that no executor or administrator had brought an action within that period
> of six months. Their Lordships are not convinced that a premature action is
> irregular although it may be stayed or dismissed if within six months of the
> death another action is brought by the executor or administrator. Their
> Lordships are satisfied that, if a premature action is irregular and the
> irregularity is of a kind, which, as in the instant case, was cured without
> amendment by the mere lapse of time and which causes no prejudice to the
> defendant, there is no reason for the court to insist that the irregularity
> nullifies and invalidates the whole proceedings. The modern approach is to
> treat an irregularity as a nullifying factor only if it causes substantial
> injustice: see**Marsh v Marsh** [1945] AC 271, 284. The premature issue of
> the writ in the present case did not cause any injustice at all. A bizarre
> and unjust result would follow if a writ issued on 2 November 1974, and
> served on 4 November 1974, were held to be a nullity whereas a write issued
> and served on 4 November 1974, would plainly have been effective._

  
  
I agree with this reasoning entirely. Applying it to the present case, s 20(4)
of the Act does not expressly invalidate any action brought prematurely.
Furthermore, no prejudice has been caused to the defendants by the plaintiff
bringing the proceedings within the six month period. If the plaintiff`s
action had indeed been premature, the irregularity should be regarded as
having been cured by lapse of time. Her action should thus be allowed to
stand.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

The defendants` attempts to impugn the plaintiff`s locus standi would only
result in a delay in the plaintiff having her day in court. It would serve no
useful purpose for me to strike out this claim as the plaintiff could start a
fresh dependency action immediately, the claim not being time-barred. There
was no merit therefore in the defendant`s application. I therefore dismiss the
appeal with costs and uphold the decision of the assistant registrar below.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
