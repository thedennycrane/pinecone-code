number of documents by a specified date and time, failing which judgment would
be entered against the defendants. The order was made pursuant to the
plaintiffs’ action against the club for misrepresentation and breach of
contract. The plaintiffs allege that the ‘common law prospectus’ promised
lavish reception and facilities to all selected and accepted by the defendants
as members of the club, which representations the plaintiffs allege were false
and misleading.

The defendants appealed against discovery of the following documents in the
order: A document recording the number of members to be taken in the 1st
offering (Item 1); a document recording the number of members to be taken in
the second offering (Item 2); a document recording the number of applications
received and determining the number to be accepted in the 1st offering (Item
3); any document(s) revealing a change in approval criteria between the 1st
and 2nd offering (Item 4); application forms submitted and approved at the fee
of $28,000 in the relevant period (Item 5); a document reflecting the
membership numbers at various dates from 1996 to 2002 (Item 7); any document
relating to the decision before June 2001 to use $100,000,000 for additional
facilities (Item 9(b)); copies of correspondence from members raising
complaints and the club management’s replies over a period of time (Item 10);
documents relating to the use of presidential or executive suites of RTC by
non-members in the relevant period (Item 11); and finally, the original
document entitled "F & B Daily Sales and Cost of Sales Analysis" (Item 12).

**

Held, allowing the appeal save for Item 7 of the Order,

**(1) Whether a class of documents as a whole would be relevant and should be
produced for the purposes of discovery must depend upon the court’s evaluation
that the documents sought would contain such information that might enable the
plaintiffs to advance their own case or damage that of the defendants; _O Co.
v M Co._ [1996] 2 Lloyd’s LR 347 followed (see 14).

(2) A court would not order discovery of material which would be used solely
for cross-examination of a witness as to credit since it would be oppressive
if a party was obliged to disclose any document which might provide material
for cross examination as to his credibility as a witness; _Thorpe v Chief
Constable of the Greater Manchester Police_ [1989] 2 All ER 827 followed (see
15).

(3) If the request for discovery is too wide, too onerous or oppressive then
the courts are likely to reject the request. Save for Item 7, which is germane
to the issues addressed in this case, the other discoveries appealed against
are too wide, extremely onerous and appear to lack the essential ingredient of
relevance. (see 17 – 29)

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. This is an appeal by the defendants against the order of the learned
Assistant Registrar of the Supreme Court made on 23 April 2002, requiring the
defendants to provide the plaintiffs with a number of documents by 5 p.m. on 7
May 2002. Failure to comply with the order would have resulted in the
plaintiffs entering judgment against the defendants. The background to the
present appeal is provided below.

2\. The plaintiffs, a group of about 4,895 disgruntled members of a
proprietary social club, have brought this action against the club, the
defendants herein, based on actionable misrepresentation and breach of
contract. The purpose of this action, as stated in the plaintiffs’ statement
of claim is to seek declaratory orders and compensation for the said alleged
actionable misrepresentation and breach of contract, reportedly contained in a
set of documents which the plaintiffs term as a ‘common law prospectus’,
promising lavish reception and facilities to all selected and accepted by the
defendants as members of the club.

3\. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued and caused to be
despatched to members of the public the said common law prospectus. According
to the plaintiffs, the said common law prospectus comprised:

> (a) a letter of invitation dated 9 November 1996;
>
> (b) a document giving general information in the form of questions and
> answers; and
>
> (c) a brochure.

4\. The plaintiffs further aver in their statement of claim that the said
prospectus contained, inter alia, the following highlights either by express
representation or by way of necessary implications:

> (a) It was planned that the Club would have nearly 600 car park lots for the
> use of the members.
>
> (b) "Raffles Town Club members will enjoy unparalleled privileges and
> facilities".
>
> (c) "The Club’s exclusive and limited memberships will be fully
> transferrable".
>
> (d) The Club would be constructed to have a total built-up area in excess of
> 400,000 sq. ft. catering for the "business entertainment, networking,
> socializing, personal and family leisure requirements" of each successful
> subscription for the duration of the membership. The Club would have
> "separate formal, casual, sporting, children’s and family facilities" for
> the successful subscribers.
>
> (e) A supplementary card would be issued to the spouse or fianc of the
> member allowing full membership privileges and benefits at no additional
> cost. This was intended to convey the meaning and message that each
> subscriber would receive two licences for the price of one.
>
> (f) The Club would be "without peer in terms of size, facilities and sheer
> opulence".
>
> (g) There would be two classes of individual members:
>

>> (i) first, a limited number of exclusive transferable founder members at
S$28,000 (exclusive of GST) available to the credit-card holding customers on
a first-come-first-served basis. This class of founder members would be
selected from those who submitted their applications not later than 30
November 1996. Based on "priority applications", this class of members were
called "founder members"; and

>>

>> (ii) the second class of members would be selected from those not selected
from the priority applications and from fresh applications submitted in
response to a public launch to be made after 30 November 1996. The allotment
price for this class of members was to be S$40,000. This class of members will
hereafter be called "second class members".

5\. In paragraphs 10 to 14 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs outlined
how they understood the said representations and their grievances. Insofar as
is material, the said segment reads as follows:

> 10\. The Plaintiffs and other members of the Class understood the
> representations to mean that the total number of members at any given time
> would be limited such that at any given time no member and the supplementary
> card-holder would be shut out from or be unable to use the facilities of the
> Club, including the car parks in the manner or up to the standard as
> represented in the prospectus. Such limitation was also to be inferred from
> the holding-out and the representations (a) that the Club would be "without
> peer in terms of size, facilities and sheer opulence", (b) that there would
> be "a limited number of exclusive individual founder member memberships" and
> (c) as to the number of car park lots and the total built-up area. Further,
> the representations were to be understood, implied or inferred in the light
> of the provisions of the Building Control Act, the regulations made
> thereunder as construed and applied by the consultant architects engaged by
> the Defendant for the construction of the Club.
>
> 11\. Additionally or alternatively, the representations and the holding-out
> set out above became terms of the contractual licences spawned by the
> acceptance of the Plaintiffs and other members of the Class.
>
> 12\. The Plaintiffs and other members of the Class on the faith of the
> representations as set out above and the contents of the prospectus as a
> whole subscribed to and became the founder members. Each of them paid the
> subscription in the sum of S$28,000. All made their applications not later
> than 30 November 1996. In addition, they paid monthly subscriptions and
> deposits for the Food and Beverage Account.
>
> 13\. The representations as set out above turned out to be untrue, false and
> misleading.
>

>> > > > > > > > > __**

>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>> Particulars

>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>> **__

>

>> a. The Club in fact accepted 19,000 members each of whom had paid S$28,000.
The acceptance was communicated by the Defendant to the successful applicants
in December 1996. There was no public launch of $40,000 for the second class
members.

>>

>> b. The Club was opened in March 2000 and not end of 1998 as promised and
was woefully inadequate shockingly short of the representations to cater for
and accommodate the huge number of members and the supplementary card-holders.

>>

>> c. Not all facilities stated in the prospectus were available to the
members.

>>

>> d. The Defendant dreadfully failed to realise the representations set out
above with the result that the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class
were unable to realise the aspirations and representations conveyed by the
prospectus.

>>

>> e. The membership became virtually useless.

> 14\. Additionally or alternatively, by reason of the matters set out in
> paragraph 13, the Defendant was in breach of the contract of the terms as
> asserted above.

6\. In the result, the plaintiffs, alleging loss and damage, seek declaratory
orders and damages.

7\. The defendants, in the defence filed by them without prejudice to their
rights to apply to the court to strike out the plaintiffs’ claim resist the
claim and aver that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the remedies sought by
them. Insofar as is material, paragraphs 10 and 13 of the defence require
reproduction and they are as follows:

> 10\. Insofar as Paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim alleges that the
> Plaintiffs and other members of the Class understood that there were certain
> representations made, and that these representations were understood to mean
> such allegations as are contained in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim,
> the Plaintiffs’ state of mind and the stage of mind of the members of the
> Class is not within the Defendant’s knowledge. Consequently, no admission is
> made thereto.
>
> 13\. The Defendants further aver that the Club is a proprietary club,
> providing facilities and amenities for the use of its members, who, in turn,
> have no interest in the club property and/or income. The Plaintiffs and the
> members of the Class applied to become members of the Club, by submitting
> the application forms. That is an offer by the Plaintiffs and the members of
> the Class. The Defendant accepted the offer. Plaintiffs and members of the
> Class thereby became members of the Club. The contract between the parties
> is as set out in the said application forms and acceptance. The terms of the
> contract are as set out in the said application form, which, as stated
> earlier is an offer by the Plaintiffs and the members of the Class.

8\. Further particulars were provided by the plaintiffs pursuant to an order
of Court dated 4 March 2002 and they are too long to be entered upon here.

9\. As mentioned by me at the outset, the appeal before me is confined only to
the order made by the Assistant Registrar on 23 April 2002, requiring the
defendants to provide the plaintiffs a host of documents by 7 May 2002,
failing which the plaintiffs are entitled to enter judgment against the
defendants. In order to comprehend the issues raised by the parties in regard
to the present appeal, it would be helpful at this stage to reproduce a
schedule submitted by counsel setting forth the description of the documents
ordered to be produced by the defendants and the position of the defendants in
this appeal in relation to the said documents. The said schedule reads as
follows:__****__

Order of Court of the Assistant Registrar

---|---|---  
1. | Any one document of a date before 6 November 1996 recording a decision (whether of the Board, Raffles Town Club ("RTC"), Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd ("RTCPL") and/or Raffles Town Club Ltd ("RTCL"), its directors or its representatives) on the number of Raffles Town Club members to be taken in the 1st offering ending 30 November 1996 and for the fee of S$28,000. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
2. | Any one document of a date before 6 November 1996 recording a decision (whether of the Board of RTC, RTCPL and/or RTCL, its directors or its representatives) on the number of Raffles Town Club members to be taken in the 2nd offering after 30 November 1996 and for the fee of $40,000. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
3. | Any one document of a date after 30 November 1996 but before 31 March 1997 recording (whether by the Board of RTC, RTCPL and/or RTCL, its directors or its representatives) the number of applications received and determining the number of applications to be accepted from the applications made in the 1st offering ending 30 November 1996 and for the fee of $28,000. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
4. | Any one document or documents dated 1 January 1996 and before 31 September 1997 recording (whether by the Board of RTC, RTCPL and/or RTCL, its directors or its representatives) the criteria for approving applications in: (i) the 1st offering ending 30 November 1996; and  
(ii) the 2nd offering starting 1 December 1996, limited to documents where there is a material change in position from the previous document in time. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
5. | Any and/or all application forms submitted after 30 November 1996 and before March 2000 approved for membership at the fee of $28,000. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
6. | Any one document recording the number of applications approved after 30 November 1996 and before March 2000 for membership at the fee of $40,000 or such sum as may be higher than $28,000. | This is not being appealed.  
7. | Any one document reflecting the membership numbers during the following periods: (i) 30 December 1996  
(ii) 31 March 1997  
(iii) 31 January 1999  
(iv) 31 March 2000  
(v) 31 March 2001  
(vi) 31 March 2002 | The Defendant is appealing against this order  
8. | A copy of any invitation to membership issued in the month of November 1996, whether jointly with another bank or financial institution or by the Board of RTC, RTCPL and/or RTCL, its directors or its representatives or by Europa Country Club, other than the invitation letters already disclosed. | This is not being appealed  
9. | Any one document or documents dated after 1 January 1996 but before 31 September 2001 reflecting (whether by the Board of RTC, RTCPL and/or RTCL, its directors or its representatives or agents such as architects): (a) (i) the final building plan/design submission to the Building Control Authority;  
(ii) any material amendments to this final submission document thereafter; (b)
(i) the decision shortly before June 2001 of using $100,000,000 for additional
facilities; and  
(ii) the implementation plan for the use of this additional S$100,000,000 | For the documents in category (a), these are not being appealed. For the documents in category (b), the Defendant is appealing against this order.  
10. | Copies of correspondence (a) from members raising complaints; and  
(b) the club management’s replies, in relation to the in inadequacy and over-crowding of the RTC coffee-house, Chinese restaurant, car-park and swimming pool for the period March 2000 to July 2001. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
11. | Any documents relating to the use of the presidential or executive suites of RTC by a non-member person or body corporate in relation to which period and for what fee, for the period March 2000 to March 2001. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
12. | The Defendants are to produce for inspection the originals of Item 106 – 129 of their List of Documents identified as "F & B Daily Sales and Cost of Sales Analysis" with liberty for the Plaintiffs to take copies at their cost. | The Defendant is appealing against this order.  
  
10\. An addendum to the foregoing schedule is perhaps appropriate at this
stage. It is an agreed position between both counsel that in regard to item 7
of the said schedule, the last four documents listed there, i.e., documents
reflecting the membership numbers for the periods: (iii) 31 January 1999; (iv)
31 March 2000; (v) 31 March 2001; and (vi) 31 March 2002 were never requested
by the plaintiffs but yet were ordered to be produced by the Assistant
Registrar. During the hearing before me, counsel for the plaintiffs made it
known to the Court that the plaintiffs were not asking for them to be
produced.

11\. Before I touch upon the arguments and conclusions reached by me, it would
also be useful to make reference to the chronology of events in relation to
this discovery process. It reads as follows:

22.04.02 | Hearing of SIC 968 of 2002  
23.04.02 | Order made by Assistant Registrar  
  
12\. In the appeal before me, in the main, the submission by the counsel for
the appellants was that in the absence of a plea of fraudulent
misrepresentation, a party is not entitled to ask for documents to evince the
other party’s frame of mind. He further submitted that the court should not
allow wide-ranging discovery where the party’s purpose is to fish for possible
claims, as discovery in such a case may be oppressive. He added that the over-
riding test in respect of discovery is relevance and this does not appear to
be case in relation to the plaintiffs’ requests.

13\. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that the documents ordered are relevant
to the issues and matters in question in the action; they are documents which
the plaintiffs may or will rely on; they are documents which could adversely
affect the defendant’s case or support the plaintiffs’ case; they are
documents which may lead the plaintiffs to a train of inquiry resulting in the
plaintiffs obtaining information which may adversely affect the defendant’s
case or support the plaintiffs’ case; and above all they are necessary for
disposing fairly of the cause or matter or as necessary for saving costs.
Reliance was placed on O 24 r (5) of the Rules of Court which provides:

> **
>
> 5.
>
> ** –(1) Subject to Rule 7, the Court may at any time, on the application of

_**

  
Decision

**_

14\. In my view, whether a class of documents as a whole would be relevant and
should be produced for the purposes of discovery must depend upon the court’s
evaluation that the documents sought would contain such information that might
enable the plaintiffs to advance their own case or damage that of the
defendants. Colman J in _O Co. v M Co._ [1996] Vol. 2 Lloyd’s LR 347 at 351
observed:

> [T]he document or class of documents must be shown by the applicant to offer
> a real probability of evidential materiality in the sense that it must be a
> document or class of documents which in the ordinary way can be expected to
> yield information of substantial evidential materiality to the pleaded claim
> and the defence to it in the broad sense which I have explained. If the
> document or class cannot be demonstrated to be clearly connected to issues
> which have already been raised on the pleadings or which would in the
> ordinary way be expected to be raised in the course of the proceedings, if
> sufficient information were available, the application should be dismissed.

15\. Still on this subject, it was held by the Court of Appeal in England, in
_Thorpe v Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police_ [1989] 2 All ER
827, that it would not order discovery of material which would be used solely
for cross-examination of a witness as to credit since it would be oppressive
if a party was obliged to disclose any document which might provide material
for cross-examination as to his credibility as a witness.

16\. The cause of action as put forth by the plaintiffs is based on actionable
misrepresentation and breach of contract. In this regard, the plaintiffs, in
fact 4,895 of them in all, by and large rely on a so-called common law
prospectus. Let me now deal with the nature of the documents requested and
ordered to be produced.

17\. _Items 1 to 4 of the schedule_ : Documents requested are in relation to
decisions of the defendants’ board taken (a) before 6 November 1996, (b) after
30 November 1996 but before 31 March 1997, and (c) after 1 January 1996 but
before 31 September 1997, on the criteria for approving membership
applications as well as the number of members to be taken in for the fee of
$28,000 in the first offering and for $40,000 in the second offering.

18\. In my view, the decision of the board as to the criteria to be adopted by
them and the number of members they intended to recruit cannot be a basis for
any actionable misrepresentation or breach of contract and in this respect no
material is placed before me to warrant an inference that the said documents
might enable the plaintiffs to advance their case or damage that of the
defendants. One can imagine that in any commercial venture there is bound to
be discussions and decisions as to how the said venture should proceed to
obtain optimum returns. In a dynamic and fluid corporate environment,
decisions are made and unmade to provide for contingencies. On the question
how the criteria contemplated and decisions taken by the defendants’ board
would enhance the plaintiffs’ case, or damage that of the defendants, there
was very little forthcoming from the plaintiffs.

19\. _Item 5_ : The document here relates to application forms to the club
submitted after 30 November 1996 and before March 2000 approved for membership
at the fee of $28,000. Quite apart from the fact, the applicants might well
object to their personal particulars disclosed to all and sundry, in my view,
these application forms have little relevance to the representations allegedly
made to the plaintiffs and breach spoken of. The request covers not only the
period the alleged representations were supposedly made in the said common law
prospectus but also the ensuing four years. Again, I was not persuaded as to
the relevance how this group of documents might advance the case of the
plaintiffs or damage the case of the defendants. Cases referred to by the
plaintiffs’ counsel (_Manilal & Sons (Pte) Ltd v Bhupendra KJ Shan_ (_t/a JB
International)_ [1989] SLR 1182, _The Patraikos 2_ [2001] 4 SLR 308, _Standard
Chartered Bank v SSangyong Cement (Singapore) Limited_ S1173/1991 unreported),
all of them do not detract from the principle that in general where there is
an order of court for discovery, a party is obliged to make discover all
documents relevant to the matters in the action and what these matters are
would depend on the pleadings.

20\. _Item 6_ : Documents ordered to be produced under this item are not the
subject of appeal before me.

21\. _Item 7_ : As mentioned by me earlier (see para 10 infra), documents in
respect of membership numbers as on 31 January 1999, 31 March 2000, 31 March
2001 and 31 March 2002, although not asked for by the plaintiffs, were still
ordered to be produced by the Assistant Registrar. During arguments before me,
plaintiffs’ counsel informed me that he was not pressing for these documents.
As for membership numbers as on 30 December 1996 and 31 March 1997, I was not
inclined to disturb the order below as it would appear that the number of
members in respect of the periods mentioned are germane to the issues to be
addressed in this case.

22\. _Item 8_ : The document ordered is a copy of invitation to membership in
the month of November 1996 by the defendants and their associates. This is
indeed a relevant document and at any rate that there is no appeal by the
defendants in respect of this document.

23\. _Item 9_ : There are two categories of documents, categories (a) and (b),
ordered to be produced under this head. The defendants are not appealing
against category (a) documents which relate to building plans and designs. The
subject of appeal under this item is confined to documents grouped under
category (b) only. They pertain to decisions made by the defendants or their
associates shortly before June 2001 to use $100,000,000 for additional
facilities and the implementation of the plan using the said sum. In relation
to these documents, I am inclined to agree with the defence contention that
any decision that may have been made in the course of the year 2001 cannot
have any bearing or relevance to the alleged representations made in the year
1996.

24\. _Item 10_ : The documents ordered under this head relate to members’
complaints and management replies concerning the inadequacy and overcrowding
in the club’s facilities for the period March 2000 to July 2001. The first
observation in regard to this request is that the plaintiffs, comprising a
united group of 4,995 members, would by themselves, have been able to produce
the letters of complaints they wrote to the management and the replies they
might have received without having to pass the burden to the defendants. In
any event, the complaints and the response are not shown to me to be of
relevance to the issues to be decided.

25\. _Item 11_ : The documents ordered relate to the use of the presidential
or executive suites of the club by a non-member or body corporate and the fees
charged for such use for the period March 2000 and March 2001. What light, the
documents requested would throw on the issues to be determined, I was not made
aware of. In any event, in my evaluation, this request is clearly an endeavour
to unsettle the defendants and has little relevance to the issues at hand.

26\. _Item 12_ : Under this head, the defendants are required to produce for
inspection the originals of item 106 – 129 of their List of Documents
identified as "F & B Daily Sales Analysis" with liberty for the plaintiffs to
take copies at their cost. I was told that the defendants that they on their
own disclosed and produced these documents with certain parts blanked out. The
blanked parts relate to how much money is charged and paid. The defendants’
contention is that those parts are not relevant at all to the issues to be
decided. The plaintiffs’ counsel’s reply is that inasmuch as the defendants
have disclosed the documents to the plaintiffs, the latter must bare all. In
_G.E. Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd v. Bankers Trust Co. and Others_
[1995] 1 WLR 172, it was held by the Court of Appeal in England that a party
giving discovery of a document is not obliged to disclose any part which is
irrelevant to the issues in the case. In that case, the plaintiff had blanked
out from the documents in a list served on the defendants passages considered
irrelevant. The judge in the first instance ordered the complete documents to
be disclosed since it had not been alleged that they were irrelevant. The
plaintiff appealed and the court of appeal allowed the appeal holding that the
judge had applied the wrong test. Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) observed at
p.175 H that the irrelevant parts can be covered without destroying the sense
of the rest or making it misleading. In the case before me, counsel for the
plaintiffs did not address me on the relevance of the blanked parts except to
venture that he would like to know whether the covered parts are relevant or
not.

27\. In _Marks and Spencer plc v Granada TV and Another_ (unreported), a
transcript of which is provided by the defendants’ counsel, Ebsworth J,
commented at page 4 of the transcript (last paragraph) "_[I]t is incumbent
upon a party making an application for a discretionary order, such as
specific**discovery** , to ensure that which is sought is within the proper
limits of relevance and sufficiently specific to be the subject of the
affidavit which is required to be sworn. If it is too wide then it is both
extremely onerous for the opposing party and will add to, rather than save
costs by including matters which are not relevant. In those circumstances, as
Aldous J pointed out in Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd v Carr’s Paper Ltd and others
[1989] RPC 713, the court is entitled to refuse to make an order at all._"

28\. In my opinion, the very rationale for the discovery process, provided for
in the Rule referred to, is relevance. If it is too wide, too onerous or
oppressive then the courts are likely to reject the request. In my
determination, the discoveries sought are too wide, extremely onerous and
appear to lack the essential ingredient of relevance.

29\. Having considered all the arguments and the learning referred to, I am of
the view that discoveries requested and ordered, save for matters conceded and
not appealed against appear to straddle the realm of fishing. In my
determination, most of the documents requested appears to have little or no
relevance to the issues to be decided except for the purposes of expanding the
armoury of the plaintiffs, which the plaintiffs are now trying to assemble at
the expense of the defendants. When the appeal was in train before me, it was
made apparent to me that the present grievance by the plaintiffs arises from a
disclosure obtained by the court in a previous case where the membership
numbers of the defendants surfaced. Having determined that the categories
documents sought by the plaintiffs are extremely wide and bear little
relevance to the issues, the following orders were made by me at the end. They
are as follows:

> (1) Appeal is allowed save for paragraph 1(7) of the Notice of Appeal dated
> 25 April 2002;
>
> (2) In relation to paragraph 1(7) of the Notice of Appeal dated 25 April
> 2002, the Defendant shall give the Plaintiffs by 21 May 2002 either a
> document or furnish best particulars of the:
>

>> (a) number of members as at 30 December 1996; and

>>

>> (b) number of members as at 31 March 1997;

>
> (3) Order the Defendant, by 5.00 pm on 21 May 2002 to comply with the orders
> made by the Assistant Registrar on 23 April 2002 which are not being
> appealed against and the orders made herein.
>
> The Defendant to use its best endeavours to comply with the above orders.

> In default, the Plaintiff may apply to Court to enter judgment against the
> Defendant upon giving 48 hours’ notice to the Defendant;

> (4) There be liberty to apply; and
>
> (5) By consent, costs of the appeal and below be costs in the cause.

_Order accordingly._
