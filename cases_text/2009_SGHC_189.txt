Choo Han Teck J:

1 The accused was a 43 years old unemployed man who was arrested on 28 March
2008 in his rented room at Blk 323, Ubi Avenue 1, #11-573. He was subsequently
charged with 13 charges of drug-related offences. The Deputy Public Prosecutor
(“DPP”) applied to proceed with the first charge and the remaining 12 charges
were stood down pending the outcome of the trial. The first charge was a
capital charge for having possession of 64.34g of diamorphine for the purposes
of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable
under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

2 The evidence showed that the accused was arrested at 9.45am on 28 March 2008
when officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) entered his flat and
broke into his room. He was found holding a maroon coloured bag in which the
CNB officers found 36 packets of white substance subsequently ascertained to
be heroin. More heroin was found elsewhere in his room and the aggregate of
which formed the subject matter of the first charge. The CNB officers also
found drug trafficking materials, namely, a weighing scale, a pair of scissors
and some small plastic sachets. Several other persons were also arrested at
about the same time. They were later ascertained not to be concerned with the
charges involving the accused.

3 The prosecution also adduced seven statements made by the accused in which
he gave detailed accounts of how he came to be staying at the flat, and how he
came into the business of drug trafficking. These included details of his own
addiction, how he was introduced to his supplier, and also the persons to whom
he delivered drugs to. He obtained his supply from a Malaysian man known to
him only as “Ah Seng”. He started delivering drugs for Ah Seng in February
2008. The drugs would be sent by courier to the car park near Blk 322, Ubi
Avenue 1. Ah Seng would send heroin, Ecstasy tablets, Ice, and Erimin-5, all
wrapped in black tape. Ah Seng would notify the accused whenever anyone wanted
to take delivery. The accused would then follow Ah Seng’s instructions to make
the delivery and collect payment on his behalf. He was paid $150 for each
delivery he made. He made about 7 or 8 deliveries a week. He admitted that he
had just collected a batch of drugs from Ah Seng’s courier on the morning of
the day of his arrest. The drugs were meant to be collected from him sometime
later but no instructions had been received at the time. The accused merely
checked the bundles and weighed them as instructed.

4 The accused did not challenge any of the evidence having instructed his
counsel that he would plead guilty to the charge. At the close of the
prosecution’s case, counsel declined to make any submission. I then called
upon the defence and the accused elected to remain silent. His counsel again
declined to make any submission. On the evidence, I was satisfied that the
prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and I thus convicted
the accused and sentenced him to death.
