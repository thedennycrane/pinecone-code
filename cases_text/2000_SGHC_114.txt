: **_Background_**  
  
By a letter of award dated 20 May 1996 from the defendants` architect, the
plaintiffs were engaged by the defendants as the main contractors in respect
of a proposed super-structure for proposed service apartments cum shops at 1st
storey with two basement carparks on Lots 30-1, 30-2 and 31 TS No 20 at
Killiney/Lloyd Road at a contract sum of S$24,388,000 (`the project`).  
  
The main contract between the parties (`the contract`) incorporated the
Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Measurement Contract) Fourth
Edition, reprint March 1990 issued by the Singapore Institute of Architects
(`the SIA Conditions`) with amendments.  
  
The architect of the project was originally Mr Eric Huay Kwok Meng of Ong &
Ong Architects and subsequently, one Mr Steven Low of Ong & Ong Architects
(`the architect`). The quantity surveyor of the project was WT Partnership
(`the quantity surveyor`).  
  
On 28 August 1999, the plaintiffs submitted progress claim No 32 for an amount
of S$1,605,574.43 being all work done as at the date of completion. The
progress claim included the balance of variation works which the quantity
surveyor had assessed as approximately S$200,000 due to the plaintiffs but not
yet included in the previous payment certificates issued by the architect.  
  
The project was completed on 29 August 1998 according to the completion
certificate issued by the architect. The maintenance period commenced on 30
August 1998. The maintenance period was stipulated to be 12 months and `For
defects which occurred (sic) at more than two complaints of the same trade
over at different place, such liability to extend for a further period of 6
monthly (sic)`. Hence, the maintenance period for defects should have expired
on 29 August 1999 or 29 February 2000.  
  
Under cl 27(2) of the SIA Conditions, the architect was to deliver a Schedule
of Defects not later than 14 days after the expiry of the maintenance period
and on receipt of directions or instructions to do so, the plaintiffs are to
rectify all remaining defects.  
  
Under cl 27(4), the architect was entitled to require that the contract sum be
reduced, such reduction to be assessed by the quantity surveyor, in lieu of
rectification work.  
  
Under cl 27(5), when the defects had been rectified or had been dealt with
under cl 27(4), the architect was to issue a maintenance certificate.  
  
The plaintiffs were placed under judicial management on 21 January 2000 and Mr
Chee Yoh Chuang and Mr Lim Lee Meng were appointed judicial managers pursuant
to an order of court.  
  
As at the date of completion of the project, the defendants had retained a
total sum of S$1,219,400 being retention moneys up to 5% of the contract Sum.
During the maintenance period, the first half of the retention moneys was
released in tranches to the plaintiffs. The defendants retained the second
half of the retention moneys amounting to S$609,700.  
  
By a letter dated 4 October 1999, the plaintiffs requested the quantity
surveyor to recommend a payment certificate for the balance of variation works
assessed by the quantity surveyor to be approximately S$200,000.  
  
The plaintiffs alleged that notwithstanding various requests from them, the
architect did not certify the plaintiffs` progress claim No 32.  
  
By a letter dated 21 March 2000, the quantity surveyor wrote a letter to the
architect stating that the plaintiffs` claim No 32 could not be recommended
because the final accounts had yet to be finalised and that the defective
works had not been fully rectified. This letter was forwarded to the
plaintiffs vide the architect`s letter dated 22 March 2000. The plaintiffs
replied to the quantity surveyor`s letter in its letter dated 31 March 2000 to
the architect alleging that the interim payment sought had nothing to do with
the final account as it was for work carried out before the issuance of the
completion certificate.  
  
**_Performance Bond No 01-6501802 for S$2,438,800_**

****

Pursuant to the main contract, the plaintiffs had procured Performance Bond No
01-6501802 to be issued by QBE Insurance (International) Limited (`QBE`) dated
17 July 1996 for the sum of S$2,438,800 in favour of the defendants (`the
bond`).  
  
By a letter dated 18 February 2000, the defendants through their solicitors,
M/s Jing Quee & Chin Joo made a demand on the bond for S$2,438,800. The
plaintiffs, through its former solicitors, M/s Lourdes Chen & Lee objected to
the call on the bond through their letters dated 21 February 2000 and 25
February 2000.  
  
**_Action against QBE_**

****

On 7 April 2000, the defendants commenced an action in the High Court in Suit
129/2000 against QBE for the sum of S$2,438,800 under the bond.  
  
**_Plaintiffs` action_**

****

On 27 April 2000, the plaintiffs commenced the present action, ie Suit
214/2000 against the defendants. The primary relief sought was a permanent
injunction to restrain the defendants from receiving the S$2,438,800 or any
part thereof under the bond.  
  
The plaintiffs also sought a stay of the action against QBE.  
  
On the same day, the plaintiffs applied for an interlocutory injunction to
restrain the defendants from receiving the S$2,438,800 or any part thereof
under the bond and for a stay of the action against QBE and other
consequential relief.  
  
On 28 April 2000, counsel for the plaintiffs, for the defendants and for QBE
attended before the court and the plaintiffs` application was adjourned three
weeks for full arguments on an inter parte basis. In the meantime, the court
ordered that there be no payment out on the bond until further order.  
  
On 17 May 2000, counsel for each of the three parties appeared before me.
After hearing arguments, I granted an order in terms of the primary relief
sought by the plaintiffs with the qualification that the defendants are
restrained from receiving more than $1.6m under the bond until further order.
In other words, the defendants could receive up to $1.6m under the bond but no
more.  
  
My order was to apply until further order as the main litigants were going to
arbitration for their disputes. Consequential orders were made.  
  
The plaintiffs have appealed against that part of my order which did not
restrain the defendants from claiming the S$2,438,800 or any part thereof. In
other words, the plaintiffs want the defendants to be restrained from
receiving the $1.6m which I was prepared to allow the defendants to receive.  
  
**_Terms of the bond_**

****

The material terms of the bond for present purposes are:

> _
>
> 1 In consideration of you not insisting on the contractor paying Singapore
> Dollars Two Million Four Hundred And Thirty Eight Thousand and Eight Hundred

**_Whether defendants must prove a breach of contract before calling on the
bond_ **

****

Mr Chuah for the plaintiffs submitted that the defendants had to prove a
breach of contract by the plaintiffs before calling on the bond. He referred
to the following statement from the judgment of LP Thean J (as he then was) in
**Royal Design Studio Pte Ltd v Chang Pte Ltd** [1990] SLR 1116 at 1125-1126:

> _In innumerable cases, courts have, in appropriate circumstances, in
> exercise of their equitable jurisdiction granted interim injunctions
> restraining parties from enforcing their contractual provisions until the
> resolution of their disputes then pending ... In this case, the defendant is
> only entitled to call on the bond in the event of breach of contract by the
> plaintiff. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff was in breach of
> contract but that allegation is hotly contested; the plaintiff said that it
> was not in breach and that it was the defendant who was in breach.
> Obviously, this issue can only be resolved at the trial or arbitration,
> depending on which forum the parties choose to conduct their litigation.
> Until that issue is decided in favour of the defendant, it cannot be said
> that at the moment the defendant is entitled under the agreement to call on
> the bond._

  
  
I was of the view that that statement did not apply generally. There the
beneficiary of the bond had alleged that a breach had occurred. Hence it was
only logical that the beneficiary had to prove the breach. Furthermore, the
terms of the bond there may be such as to require a breach to be established
first.  
  
Whether a beneficiary has to establish a breach before calling on a
performance bond must depend on the terms of the bond. In the present case
before me, it was clear that the terms of the bond did not require the
defendants to establish a breach by the plaintiffs before being entitled to
call on the bond.  
  
**_Certain terms of the contract_**

****

Mr Chuah`s next argument was that certain terms of the contract between the
plaintiffs and the defendants dictated that the defendants were not entitled
to call on the bond just yet.  
  
Mr Chuah referred to the amended cll 42 and 43 of the contract. They state:

> _
>
> 42 Urgent Repairs
>
> _

> _If, at any time during the currency of the contract, the Architect
> determines that any remedial, protective, repair or other like works is
> urgently necessary to prevent loss of or damage to the Works or to any
> property or to prevent personal injury to or the death of any person the
> Architect shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, notify the contractor of
> that determination and the contractor shall carry out the work immediately
> on receipt of that notice and if the contractor is unable to (sic) unwilling
> at once to do the work the Employer may, by his own or other workmen, do
> such work as the architect may determine to be necessary. If the work so
> done by the Employer is work which the Architect determines to be work which
> the contractor was liable to do at his own expense under the contract then
> all costs and charges properly incurred by the Employer in doing the work
> shall be repaid to it by the contractor and may be recovered by the Employer
> as a debt due to the Employer by the contractor, or may be deducted by the
> Employer from any moneys which may then be or thereafter become payable to
> the contractor by the Employer, including any retention moneys then held by
> the Employer and, if such moneys are insufficient for this purpose, from the
> contractor`s Performance bond under the contract._

> _Response time for defects (sic) works is as follows:_

  
  

Nature of Defects | Response Time  
---|---  
|  |   
1 | Emergency Works | Within 1 day  
2 | Nuisance Defects | Within 2 days  
3 | Poor Workmanship | Within 1 week  
4 | Poor Materials Within | Within 2 weeks  
|  |   
Note: Nature of defects to be determined by the Architect  
  
  
  

> _
>
> 43 Performance bond
>
> The contractor shall as a condition precedent to the commencement of any
> Works under this contract, furnish the Employer with an unconditioned (sic)
> banker`s guarantee from a Singapore bank or a foreign bank with office in
> Singapore in a sum equal to ten percent (10%) of the contract Sum by way of
> a deposit of security for the due performance and observance by the
> contractor of all stipulations, conditions and agreements herein contained.
> The bond or guarantee so furnished hereunder shall cover the Twelve (12)
> months Maintenance period and shall be released after the expiry of
> Maintenance period.`
>
> _

  
  
Mr Chuah submitted that even if there were rectification works required to be
done by the plaintiffs, the defendants would first have to get others to do
such work. Thereafter the defendants were to deduct the cost of the
rectification works from moneys payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs
including any retention money held by the defendants. Lastly, if the moneys
payable to the plaintiffs were insufficient, then the defendants could call on
the bond.  
  
As for cl 43, Mr Chuah conceded that it was contrary to his submission because
cl 43 required the plaintiffs to furnish an unconditional banker`s guarantee.
However, Mr Chuah submitted that on the contra proferentem rule, the
contradiction should be read against the defendants as the amended cll 42 and
43 were, he believed, drafted by the architect who is the agent of the
defendants.  
  
Mr Chuah also submitted that the terms of the contract are independent of the
terms of the bond. He said that in deciding whether the defendants were
obliged to satisfy certain requirements first before calling on the bond, I
should consider cll 42 and 43 independently of the bond.  
  
Mr Wong of the defendants submitted that cl 42 pertained only to urgent
rectification works.  
  
I am of the view that Mr Wong`s submission on the meaning of cl 42 is the
correct one. It applies only when the architect determines that works are
`urgently necessary to prevent loss of or damage to the Works or to any
property or to prevent personal injury to or the death of any person`. In that
situation the plaintiffs are to carry out the work required by the architect
`immediately on receipt` of the notice from the architect. The response time
to carry out such works varied from one day to two weeks.  
  
Furthermore, such urgent work does not have to arise from the plaintiffs`
default. If it arises from the plaintiffs` default, and the defendants had to
get someone else to do the works that the defendants may recover the cost
thereof by deducting the cost from moneys held by the defendants and payable
to the plaintiffs and lastly, if such moneys are insufficient, then to call on
the bond.  
  
It was not suggested that the disputes between the parties regarding
rectification works were works that were urgently required.  
  
Accordingly, there was no contradiction between cll 42 and 43.  
  
In any event, even if, for the sake of argument, Mr Chuah`s interpretation of
cl 42 is correct, that would not assist the plaintiffs.  
  
I do not agree that the contract terms are to be construed independently of
the terms of the bond. The shoe is on the other foot as the plaintiffs are
attempting to restrain the defendants from receiving moneys under the bond (as
the call has already been made). It is the terms of the bond that are to be
construed independently of the terms of the contract between plaintiffs and
the defendants.  
  
Even if I were to take into account the terms of the contract and assuming,
for the sake of argument, that Mr Chuah`s interpretation of cl 42 is correct,
it was common ground that the bond was issued after the amended cll 42 and 43
were included in the contract and that the plaintiffs had caused the bond to
be issued on the terms contained therein. I am of the view that by causing the
bond to be issued on the terms therein, the plaintiffs would then have varied
the terms of cl 42 or waived their right to argue that various requirements in
cl 42 must be complied with first by the defendants before they were even
entitled to call on the bond.  
  
**_Unconscionability_**

****

Mr Chuah`s final argument was that although the bond was payable on demand, it
was unconscionable for the defendants to receive any moneys under the bond.  
  
He submitted that fraud was not the only reason to restrain a beneficiary from
receiving moneys under such a bond, and that unconscionability was another
reason. He cited a few cases for this proposition but it is only necessary for
me to refer to one.  
  
In **GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd** [1999] 4 SLR 604 ,
the Court of Appeal said at [para ] 24 p 615:

> _We agree that performance bonds are used frequently in the construction
> industry; that they are provided by and to parties who deal at arm`s length;
> that the use of performance bonds has resulted in substantial benefits to
> the parties and also in savings; that the courts should give effect to the
> intention of the parties; and that the law in relation to performance bonds
> should be placed on `a clear and unambiguous footing` so that they could be
> accepted by parties whether in Singapore or abroad. But, with respect, these
> are not the points involved with which we are concerned. We are concerned
> with abusive calls on the performance bonds. It should not be forgotten that
> a performance bond can operate as an oppressive instrument, and in the event
> that a beneficiary calls on the bond in circumstances, where there is prima
> facie evidence of fraud or unconscionability, the court should step in to
> intervene at the interlocutory stage until the whole of the circumstances of
> the case has been investigated. It should also not be forgotten that a
> performance bond is basically a security for the performance of the main
> contract, and as such we see no reason, in principle, why it should be so
> sacrosanct and inviolate as not to be subject to the court`s intervention
> except on the ground of fraud. We agree that a beneficiary under a
> performance bond should be protected as to the integrity of the security he
> has in case of non-performance by the party on whose account the performance
> bond was issued, but a temporary restraining order does not prejudice or
> adversely affect the security; it merely postpones the realisation of the
> security until the party concerned is given an opportunity to prove his case
> (per Chan Sek Keong J in**Chartered Electronic** at p 31 of the
> transcript)._

  
  
I consider this judgment to be binding on me. Furthermore, Mr Wong did not
dispute that the court could restrain the defendants from receiving moneys
under the bond if it was unconscionable for them to do so. However he
submitted that it was for the plaintiffs to establish unconscionability and
that this should require something more than unfairness. He submitted that
where there was a genuine dispute, then regardless of what the court might
think of the merits of the respective positions, it was not unconscionable for
the defendants to receive moneys under the bond.  
  
In the unreported judgment in **_Raymond Construction Pte Ltd v Low Yang Tong
& Anor _**, Lai Kew Chai J referred to the concept of unconscionability as
involving `unfairness, as distinct from dishonesty or fraud, or conduct of a
kind so reprehensible or lacking in good faith that a court of conscience
would either restrain the party or refuse to assist the party` (at [para ] 5).
This definition was adopted in **Sin Kian Contractor Pte Ltd v Lian Kok Hong &
Anor** [1999] 3 SLR 732  at [para ] 22 and repeated in **Min Thai Holdings Pte
Ltd v Sunlabel Pte Ltd & Anor** [1999] 2 SLR 368  (see the article entitled
`Restraining a call on performance bond: Should "Fraud or Unconscionability"
be the new orthodoxy?` by Adrian SP Wong in the **_Singapore Academy of Law
Journal_** Vol 12, March 2000 at p 162, 170 and 171).  
  
Mr Chuah accepted that it was for the plaintiffs to establish
unconscionability.  
  
**_Liquidated damages for delay_**

****

The architect had issued a delay certificate dated 5 May 1998 against the
plaintiffs and subsequently a termination of delay certificate and a further
delay certificate.  
  
Under the terms of the contract, liquidated damages were payable by the
plaintiffs at the rate of $12,000 per day. Under the delay certificates, the
liquidated damages payable was $1,131,876.30.  
  
Mr Chuah submitted that even if the plaintiffs were liable for the full sum of
liquidated damages or part thereof, the sum had earlier been deducted or set-
off against progress payments certified to be due to the plaintiffs. This was
not disputed by Mr Wong. Hence the liquidated damages are not relevant for the
application before me.  
  
**_Defects_**

****

There was correspondence from the architect about defects and eventually the
architect issued a letter to the plaintiffs dated 10 November 1999 enclosing a
schedule of defects (`the schedule of defects`).  
  
The plaintiffs alleged that they then attended to the rectification works.
Thereafter, they sent a letter dated 24 January 2000 to the architect. In that
letter they alleged that `most` of the items in the Schedule had been made
good and some were not within their responsibility.  
  
The architect replied on 27 January 2000 to say that there would be a joint
site inspection of the outstanding defects on 2 February 2000.  
  
A letter dated 10 February 2000 from the architect to the quantity surveyor
refers to the joint site inspection. It said that the inspection viewed only
the major defects. It then listed twenty items which were supposed to comprise
the major defects. These were:

> _
>
> 01 Main Lobby Marble Flooring Inherent Defects
>
> EIPL laid marble with inherent defects despite verbal objections before
> laying. EIPL suggests monetary compensation.
>
> 02 Swimming Pool Solhofen Tiles Badly Stained & Discolored
>
> CGH alleged that stains were from the spraying and cleaning up of the
> fa+ade.EIPL claimed this defect was previously signed off. O&O to

The letter ended with the architect requesting the quantity surveyor to
evaluate the quantum required to rectify the defects where the plaintiffs had
suggested monetary compensation in order than an amicable settlement could be
reached.  
  
By a letter dated 18 February 2000, the defendants` lawyers made a call on the
bond.  
  
By a letter dated 17 March 2000, the judicial managers of the plaintiffs wrote
to the architect to ask for the amount of compensation assessed in respect of
outstanding defects and issuance of a payment certificate for progress claim
No 32.  
  
By a letter dated 22 March 2000, the quantity surveyor wrote to the architect
to give an estimated cost for rectifying the defective works for certain items
only. The estimated cost pertained to eight items of defects only and amounted
to $627,600.  
  
Mr Chuah submitted that apart from the Schedule of Defects, the architect had
issued various directions, the last being dated 1 March 2000. He said that all
had been complied with and there were no further directions from the architect
and this indicated that there was nothing further to be done by the
plaintiffs.  
  
Mr Chuah also submitted that the plaintiffs` attempts to carry out
rectification works had at times been frustrated by failure to obtain access
to units.  
  
As regards the $627,600 estimated cost of eight items of defects, Mr Chuah
submitted that the defendants were holding sufficient funds to cover that. ie
the defendants were still holding half of the retention moneys amounting to
$609,700 and the plaintiffs` progress claim No 32 for $1,606,574.43 (including
the $200,000 for variations) had yet to be certified.  
  
The defendants referred to two quotations from WTK Builder Pte Ltd and Shan
Construction Pte Ltd dated 20 August 1999 and 13 September 1999, ie before the
Schedule of Defects (attached to the 10 November 1999 letter from the
architect) was issued before the joint inspection on 2 February 2000 and
before the 22 March 2000 estimate of costs by the quantity surveyor in respect
of eight items.  
  
Mr Chuah submitted that these quotations were irrelevant in the light of the
Schedule of Defects. He argued that it was not for the defendants to take
matters into their own hands but for the architect to issue instructions or
directions.  
  
I am of the view that while it is for the architect to issue instructions or
directions, this does not mean that the defendants must stand by idly and they
are entitled to obtain quotations for rectification works.  
  
Mr Wong relied primarily on the quotation from WTK Builder Pte Ltd (`WTK`).
This quotation was for a sum of $2,528,986.  
  
I asked Mr Wong if he could match the items in the quotation from WTK to the
Schedule of Defects. Notwithstanding an attempt by him, he was not able to do
so to my satisfaction. However, I had to bear in mind that the Schedule of
Defects was issued by the architect after the quotation. Therefore WTK would
not have intended to try and match the works in its quotation with those in
the Schedule of Defects. Neither was it suggested that the Schedule of Defects
was intended to match the works mentioned in the quotation. Besides, the words
used in each document may be different although they refer to the same thing.
In any event the quotation had not yet been revised after the Schedule of
Defects had been issued or after the list of twenty items of major defects had
been stated arising from the joint inspection on 2 February 2000.  
  
I did not consider it safe to reject the quotation from WTK from all
consideration at this stage.  
  
The quotation included the cost of $1,030,000 for rectifying curtain walling
and aluminium works. Water seepage at curtain walling was mentioned in the
twenty items of major defects after the joint inspection. The quantity
surveyor`s estimate of costs for the eight items did not include this item.  
  
Mr Chuah sought to persuade me that the curtain walling seepage was no longer
in issue and that any other water seepage problem was confined to two rooms
only.  
  
On the other hand, Mr Wong drew my attention to various letters. I need refer
to only two:

(a) A letter dated 23 March 2000 from the architect to the plaintiffs stated
at para 2 thereof:

> _
>
> 2.0 We refer to paragraph (2) of your letter. We refute your claim that only
> two guest rooms had leakage problems. The two guest rooms were inspected at
> random and does not construe to mean that only these two guest rooms has
> leakage problems.
>
> _

(b) Another letter dated 29 March 2000 from the architect to the plaintiffs
stated at para 2 thereof:

> _
>
> 2.0 We refer to 3rd paragraph of your letter. We refute your statement that
> the architect detected no water seepage through the wall during the joint
> inspection on 15 February 2000. Our Mr Steven Lee was at the joint
> inspection to observe the condition of the wall and did not made any
> comments confirming no water seepage detected through the wall.
>
> _

  
  
It will also be recalled that the quantity surveyor had written a letter dated
21 March 2000 to the architect stating that the plaintiffs` claim No 32 could
not be recommended because, inter alia, the defective works had not been fully
rectified.  
  
Such correspondence shows that there is a water seepage problem and it is not
necessarily confined to two rooms although it did not mention water seepage at
the curtain wall. However, I note that item 5 of the twenty items mentioned in
the architect`s letter dated 10 February 2000 to the quantity surveyor
mentioned curtain walling water seepages being attended to by M/s Acme who was
perhaps a specialist sub-contractor. This showed that as at the date of that
letter, there was such a problem.  
  
It was not clear to me whether the water seepage at the curtain walling had
been resolved and if so what the extent of the other water seepage problem,
which did not pertain to the curtain wall, was.  
  
As regards the estimate of costs by the quantity surveyor for eight items of
defects, he executed an affidavit to say that they were based on rates in the
contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants and refuted any notion that
they could be used as a gauge of the cost of another contractor to perform the
rectification works.  
  
As regards Mr Chuah`s point that the architect had not issued any further
directions, Mr Wong countered that the architect also had not issued the
maintenance certificate.  
  
As for progress claim No 32, too much should not be made out of the
architect`s omission to certify payment of the same. It will be recalled that
this progress claim was dated 28 August 1998, one day before the certified
completion date of 29 August 1998. The progress claim may have been more in
the nature of a final claim. Indeed it appeared that if the plaintiffs were
paid the entire $1,605,574.43 under this claim, there might not be a final
claim from them.  
  
It is clear to me that there are genuine disputes between the plaintiffs and
the defendants. However, the extent of the disputes and the cost of
rectification works are not clear to me. This is not surprising bearing in
mind the nature of the application before me and that the nature of disputes
regarding building defects are among the most technical and complex.
Accordingly, it was not unconscionable for the defendants to receive moneys
under the bond.  
  
**_Quantum claimed under the bond_**

****

However I did consider the quantum claimed under the bond. The call on the
bond was for about $2.43m. The quotation from WTK was for about $2.5m. I also
took into account the fact that the defendants were still holding about
$600,000 as part of the retention sum and there was about $200,000 worth of
variation works which was not really disputed by them. Although the plaintiffs
still had a substantial claim under claim No 32, besides the claim for the
$200,000 variation works, it was uncertain how much of the claim would be
allowed.  
  
Using a broad-brush approach, I deducted $800,000 (being the $600,000 retained
and the $200,000 undisputed variation works) from $2.4m and hence restrained
the defendants from receiving more than $1.6m. I considered that it was
unconscionable for the defendants to receive more than $1.6m but that they
should be entitled to receive up to that sum pending final resolution of the
disputes.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
