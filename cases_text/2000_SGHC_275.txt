**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

__The claim__

1\. The "KAY" was arrested in this action by her crew on 18 November 1998. It
was sold for $1,620,000 including bunkers on board. After payment of the
Sheriff’s expenses, crew’s wages and the claims by the shipyard there remained
to the account of the action about $570,000. Two parties are scrambling for
it.

2\. By Notice of Motion No 250 of 1999 a Liberian Corporation have asked for
the funds in Court to be paid out to them. By name it is Falkland Investments
Ltd ("Falkland"). A Russian corporation Vladivostock Base of Trawling and
Refrigeratory Fleet ("VBTRF") by its liquidator opposes the application.

3\. Falkland asserts the claim for the funds on the premises that it was the
owner of the "KAY" at the time of the arrest and sale. The determination of
the issues depends on whether the premises put forward by Falkland are true or
false. So I shall at once state the premises relied on by Falkland.

____

The premises

4\. Falkland’s basic premises is that the former owner of the "KAY", that is
VBTRF, by an agreement dated 16 January 1998 transferred the vessel to
Falkland as _datio in solutum_. The Latin phrase means "An accord and
satisfaction under the civil law, wherein the consideration is in property and
not in money". The document states "indemnity" as the equivalent of _datio in
solutum_. The vessel was then known as "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" and belonged to
the Port of Vladivostock.

5\. Following the transfer, says Falkland, the vessel was on 1 July 1998
registered provisionally at the Port of Belize in the state of Belize. It is
in Central America. It was formerly known as British Honduras. The provisional
registration certificate was issued on 1 July 1998.

6\. The transfer document refers to Falkland as "Creditor" and VBTRF as the
"Debtor". The recitals in the transfer document read as follows :

> "(1) The debtor and the Creditor on 2 June 1997 concluded a Loan Agreement
> (the "Loan Agreement") under which the Debtor received a loan in the amount
> of USD7,000,000 (seven million) and was to repay same to the Creditor within
> 11 July 1997 in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement.
>
> (2) The debtor and the Creditor on 2 June 1997 concluded a mortgage
> agreement in respect of MV "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" and which is registered in
> the State Register of Ships in the Fishing Sea Port of Vladivostock No 43 on
> 3 June 1997 ("the Mortgage Agreement").
>
> (3) The debtor has defaulted in the due performance of his obligations under
> the Loan Agreement, has acknowledged his debt in full and undertakes in all
> respects to procure the repayment of the moneys to the Creditor due under
> the Loan Agreement but is unable to make any repayments."

7\. The operative parts of the document which effected the transfer of title
read as follows :

> "1.1 In consideration of the matters set out in this Agreement the Debtor
> undertakes in lieu of the partial performance of its obligations under the
> Loan Agreement and the performance of its obligations under the Mortgage
> Agreement to transfer to the Creditor the vessel "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN"
> ("the Vessel") and the Creditor undertakes to accept the said Vessel as an
> indemnity (_datio in solutum_) in accordance with the present Agreement.
>
> 1.2 The Vessel "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" is registered in the State Register of
> Ships in the Fishing Sea Port of Vladivostock 19 July 1990 under No 6. The
> vessel is sailing under the Russian Flag, has a call signal UHGP.
>
> 1.3 It has been mutually agreed between the Parties that the transfer of the
> Vessel and the rights of ownership therein to the Creditor shall extinguish
> the Debtor’s obligation under the Loan Agreement only in the amount of
> US$3,500,000 (three million, five hundred thousand) and provided always that
> the transfer of the Vessel is completed and shall extinguish the Debtor’s
> obligations under the Mortgage Agreement. Save as aforesaid the Debtor’s
> obligations under the Loan Agreement and all other associated security
> documents shall remain in full force and effect.
>
> 2\. Transfer of the vessel and Documents.
>
> 2.1 The vessel shall be transferred in its entirety, including any of its
> part and appurtenance such as her engines, equipment, life boats, spare
> parts and materials, bunkers and other consumable as well as non-consumable
> supplies whether on board the vessel or ashore and whether available at the
> time of the conclusion of the present Agreement or acquired thereafter.
>
> 2.2 Upon signing this Agreement all rights of ownership (title) in the
> vessel are immediately transferred by the Debtor to the Creditor and the
> Debtor will transfer to the Creditor all the documents relating to the
> vessel and any additional documents confirming the transfer of the right of
> ownership (title) therein which the Creditor may require.
>
> 2.3 The Debtor hereby transfers the vessel and all rights of ownership
> therein to the Creditor and undertakes to assist the Creditor in complying
> with all legal formalities which may be required.
>
> 2.4 The Debtor shall transfer to the Creditor all the documents relating to
> the Vessel by no later than close of business in London on 28 February 1998
> as well as any additional documents confirming the right of ownership (other
> than this Agreement) which may be required by the Creditor.
>
> 2.5 The transfer of the vessel shall take effect when this Agreement is
> signed by the parties and shall be deemed finally accomplished and the
> obligations of the Debtor under the Loan Agreement in the respective part
> and under the Mortgage Agreement shall be extinguished, but only to the
> extent provided by this Agreement."

8\. The transfer document provided that it "shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with English Law".

9\. There was an earlier attempt to transfer the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" also
by way of _datio in solutum_ by a by a transfer agreement dated 9 September
1997. It was not consummated because VBTRF’s inability. Hence the second
transfer agreement. Both transfer agreements were signed for VBTRF by Nikolay
Nikitenko.

____

The Mortgage

10\. There was incontrovertible evidence that the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" was
mortgaged by VBTRF in favour of Falkland. The mortgage was duly entered in the
ship register on 3 June 1997. It was part of a fleet mortgage of seven
vessels. The aggregate amount in respect of all the seven mortgages was
USD12m. The amount of USD7,000,000 was transferred on behalf of Falkland by
Clydesdale Bank plc (UK) through National Australia Bank Limited. It was
transferred to VBTRF’s bank, Darylbank, Vladivostock. The value date was 5
June 1997.

____

The arrest in China

11\. Falkland caused the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" to be arrested at the Port of
Dalian, China on 30 January 1998. The vessel remained under arrest in China
till 1 July 1998. On that day at the request of Falkland the vessel was
released from arrest. It was on 1 July 1998 that provisional registration of
the vessel was effected at the Port of Belize. Falkland no longer maintain the
arrest since it became the registered owner on 1 July 1998. Its new name was
"KAY".

____

The "KAY" comes to Singapore

12\. Falkland engaged crew for the"KAY" who began their service on 1 September
1998. From Dailan the "KAY" sailed into Singapore under the ownership of
Falkland. At Singapore, the vessel was placed in the hands of Singapore
Technologies Marine Ltd ("ST Marine") for repairs. The vessel was brought to
Singapore by Lithuanian crew.

____

Claims against Falkland

13\. (i) At Singapore the "KAY" was arrested by its master and crew in this
action. The master filed an affidavit positively asserting that (i) they were
engaged by Falkland Investments Ltd, (ii) Falkland was the owner of the "KAY"
and (iii) the vessel was registered at the Port of Belize.

(ii) Falkland made a substantial payment to ST Marine but not all. ST Marine
instituted in rem proceedings against the "KAY" in Admiralty in Rem No 855 of
1998. Again ST Marine positively asserted that it contracted with Falkland and
filed an affidavit exhibiting invoices addressed to Falkland. Eventually ST
Marine obtained judgment and $553,731.86 was paid out to it.

(iii) Bankassure Insurance Services Ltd and Aon Group Ltd commenced a personam
action against Falkland to recover premiums payable to them in respect of crew
liability and port risk insurance. They obtained default judgment in Suit No
609 of 1999 against Falkland on 25 May 1999 for USD133,726.04 plus interest
and costs. In respect of the "KAY" there were 23 debit notes covering the
period beginning 23 January 1998 and ending 4 December 1998. All debit notes
named Falkland as the insured party.

____

Admissions by VBTRF

14\. In Korea, Falkland caused the arrest of two vessels in the ownership of
VBTRF. This was on 24 March 1998, that is before the "KAY" was provisionally
registered at the Port of Belize. In July and August 1998 they were sold by
the Korean Court for an aggregate amount of USD6.7m. Falkland causes three
other vessels belonging to VBTRF to be arrested in Korea. According to
Falkland two of these three vessels broke arrest and sailed off. Those on
board no doubt would have reported to VBTRF about the other VBTRF vessels in
Korea. VBTRF disputes that the vessels broke arrest but does not deny that the
vessels were in the Korean port and departed from them. Admiralty arrests are
unknown in Russia. The third vessel was sold by the Court for USD300,000. It
is Falkland’s case that moneys claimed in Korea were in respect of a different
loan transaction. It was over and above the USD7m in respect of which the
"KAY" and another vessel the "VIRGO I" were transferred to Falkland _datio in
solutum_. It was in partial satisfaction of the US$7m loan that the "KAY" ex
"VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" was transferred to it – that is US$3,500,000.

15\. Now comes the nub of the matter. VBTRF filed documents in Korean Court
proceedings made the following admissionary and assertions :

> (i) Falkland Investments Ltd loaned VBTRF USD7,000,000 ON 2 June 1997 and
> USD8,977,601.08 ON 14 July 1997.
>
> (ii) On January 6, 1998 VBTRF and Falkland signed a settlement agreement for
> repayment of the above credit and debt (namely the USD7m). The content of
> the settlement was that VBTRF assigned the rights and ownership of vessels
> owned by VBTRF, the "KAPITAN VOLOSHIN" (the "VIRGO I") and "VLADIMIR
> CHIVILIKHIN" (the "KAY") and as the vessels were valued at USD3,500,000
> each, the above debt of USD7,000,000 was completely repaid. In accordance
> with the above settlement agreement, VBTRF assigned the rights and ownership
> of the above vessels to Falkland, the above debts was totally repaid.
>
> (iii) Additionally, in accordance with the performance of the above
> settlement agreement VBTRF’s mortgage has already been cancelled in Russia.

16\. VBTRF is now in liquidation and there are proceedings in Russia. There
too there is a ruling affirming that "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" (renamed "KAY")
and "KAPITAN VOLOSHIN" (renamed "VIRGO I") were transferred to Falkland in
satisfaction the debt of USD7,000,000 due from VBTRF to Falkland. Thus the
transfer agreement is recognized.

17\. The above is an extraction of the essential elements Falkland relied on
to make out the premises on which it founded its case. It omits considerable
peripheral matters. What I have stated is the sort of evidence one wants to
see before giving summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules of the Court. There
are all inconvertible facts which appear in black and white.

____

Discussion

18\. When logic and the law of contract and evidence are applied to the matter
I have outlined it leads to the inescapable conclusion that Falkland was the
registered owner of the "KAY" from 1 July 1998. The vessel was not taken away
from VBTRF by any foul or fraudulent means. It was done with full knowledge of
VBTRF. When Falkland took steps to place the vessel in the Belize register the
French Classification Society, Bureau Veritas notified VBTRF of the change of
class and registry. The Classification Society notified VBTRF on 10 September
1998 that "taking into account content of the Transfer Agreement dated 16
January 1998 and having now received copy of the International Merchant Marine
Registry of Belize ‘INMARBE" Patent of Navigation, copy enclosed we cannot
anymore delay Classification After Construction Surveys". The vessel in
question was the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN". VBTRF therefore was fully aware of it
reclassification and registration at Belize. Nothing was said to anyone that
there was something foul. The classification society went ahead and
reclassified the vessel. Belize gave it provision registration – provisional
because VBTRF failed to secure a deletion certificate at the Russian Registry.
This was in breach of the transfer document. Clearly VBTRF was taking
advantage of its own wrong. I repeat that the mortgage on the vessel according
to VBTRF was deleted at the Russian Register.

19\. VBTRF stood by while the whole world, including Russia, acted on the
transfer document and subsequent registration in Belize.

20\. Several debts were incurred by Falkland in respect of which admiralty
actions were filed in Singapore. VBTRF never batted an eyelid against the
other claimants who contracted with Falkland. It was only when Falkland
applied to enter appearance and to apply for the balance of the proceeds of
the sale that it came on the scene and made vociferous objections. There was
much rhetoric on behalf of VBTRF accompanied by voluminous documents. There
was nothing in them to answer the solid and substantial documentary evidence
placed before this Court by Falkland.

21\. What emanated from the VBTRF camp was confusion, contradiction,
confabulation (both conscious and unconscious and obfuscation). It was a
feeble attempt to wrest the facts to suit their claim. There was in fact a
veiled concession that they had no hard evidence to produce. They said that
there was some important evidence in London. They had been saying that for
some time but never came up with anything. In view of the glaring admissions
VBTRF had made and the long elapse of time since the transfer document I was
not convinced that they could produce anything relevant and credible.

22\. The high water mark of VBTRF’s case was that one Oleg Nikitenko was the
principal shareholder of Falkland. His father Nikolay Nikitenko was the
President of VBTRF, and it was the father who signed the transfer document. It
was further said that on 16 January 1996 Nikolay Nikitenko could not have
signed the transfer and therefore it was a forgery. Finally, it was said, the
witness to his signature had no authority. So it was void. I was not
persuaded. If it was all right for VBTRF to take a loan from the son’s company
and for the father to sign the loan agreement it must be all right for him to
sign the settlement and transfer document since he was the President of VBTRF.
A witness need not be an employee of the organization on behalf of which the
document is executed. The more important point to note is the admission,
reliance and reaffirmation of VBTRF on the transfer agreement.

23\. The crucial point is whether VBTRF received the money. Admittedly it did.
There are several obvious and conspicuous admissions to that effect in
incontrovertible documents. There was a document evidencing the transfer of
US$7m to VBTRF. It was said that Falkland was a nett debtor to VBTRF. The
Singapore Court, however, is not concerned with the global picture. The
concern of the Singapore Court in this action is the "KAY". So this Court has
no jurisdiction, when disposing of an admiralty case to bring into this case
by a side-wind a myriad of hypothetical matters unrelated to what is at hand.
In good measure, I must record here Falkland has said to this Court that when
the balance of the proceeds is received by it, due credit will be given for it
in other proceedings between it and VBTRF.

24\. The true aim of VBTRF’s intervention was to ask this Court to set aside
this transfer agreement. To achieve that end VBTRF must show that it repaid
the loan. Did VBTRF repay? All the evidence pointed to the fact of _datio in
solutum_ and not payment by money. Time and again VBTRF asserted and
reaffirmed the transfer document and repayment by _datio in solutum_.**** It
must not resile from it. Accordingly there is not even an iota of evidence to
set aside the transfer agreement.

25\. Counsel for Falkland put it poignantly that since the loan and mortgage
are not disputed Fakland must be entitled to payment of the balance of the
proceeds in that right. But VBTRF has admitted, first in writing that on the
basis of the transfer _datio in solutum_ dated 16 January 1997 and that the
mortgage registrations at the Russian registry of ship was cancelled on that
basis. Secondly, VBTRF never took any steps to prevent the registration of the
vessel at the Port of Belize. Thirdly, VBTRF did nothing while the vessel was
under arrest in China. Fourthly, VBTRF did nothing in Singapore while actions
were being filed and judgments being entered; for that matter VBTRF did not
object to the money being paid out to the crew and ST Marine. Fifthly, VBTRF
has not brought any action against Falkland for stealthily taking the ship
away from VBTRF. Sixthly, VBTRF has not produced a shade of direct evidence to
establish repayment of the loan of USD7m other than by _datio in solutum_.
Having slumbered all this time how can it now come and deny, after all those
events, that Falkland is the owner of the "KAY". All that VBTRF has done is to
obfuscate and confuse the real issue by bringing in irrelevant and
inadmissible materials such as the additional loans which are the subject
matter of legal proceedings elsewhere. I agree.

____

The result

26\. That compels me to conclude at once with moral certainty that Falkland
established its entitlement to the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the
"KAY".
