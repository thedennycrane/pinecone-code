(delivering the judgment of the court): This is an appeal against a decision
of the High Court which declared that an agreement for the sale of a certain
property belonging to the estate of Lee Chong Miow (the deceased) which was
purportedly entered into between one Christina Lee, a co-administratrix of the
estate, and the appellants was invalid and was therefore not binding on the
estate. [See [1999] 2 SLR 360.]  
  
**_The facts_**

****

The facts of the case are largely undisputed. The deceased passed away
intestate on 4 July 1969. On 1 March 1971, one Martin Lee, the son of the
deceased, petitioned for letters of administration to be granted jointly to
himself and his sister, Christina Lee, as administrators of the estate. The
order appointing them as such was made on 12 March 1971. However, nothing more
was done by both of them and the grant was never extracted.  
  
In 1989, Martin Lee suffered a severe stroke and became incapable of managing
his own affairs by reason of his mental disability. By an order of court dated
10 August 1994, Martin Lee`s son, the respondent in this case, and the wife of
the respondent were appointed as the Committee of his Person and Estate
(`Committee`).  
  
Sometime on or before 20 July 1995, Christina Lee and the respondent made an
application to court to revoke the original grant of letters of administration
and to appoint them as administrators of the estate. The application was
granted on 28 July 1995. The grant of the letters of administration was only
extracted on 14 August 1996.  
  
The deceased was the registered proprietor of a plot of land comprising Lot
91-81 Mukim 28 at Upper Changi Road (the `property`). In the meantime, on 23
February 1994, Christina Lee purportedly entered into an agreement with the
appellants for the sale of property to the appellants (`the agreement`). She
entered into the agreement in her capacity as `a personal representative of`
the deceased. The dispute before the court below and before us is whether the
agreement is valid and binding on the estate since it was executed by only one
of two administrators of the estate.  
  
At the time of the agreement, the property was the subject of an adverse
possession claim by one Wama bte Buang, who was the daughter of the deceased`s
gardener, against Martin Lee and Christina Lee as personal representatives of
the estate. Wama bte Buang had successfully claimed ownership over the
property in the High Court and was granted a judgment in OS 156/90. A notice
of appeal was filed against the decision vide CA 127/93 (`the appeal`) before
Christina Lee executed the agreement.  
  
The appellants first became interested in the property as a result of the
considerable media coverage of the litigation in OS 156/1990. The managing
director of the appellants, one Goh Hoon Leum (Goh), had through the
introduction of a broker, sought out and met with the wife of Martin Lee and
Christina Lee. Goh was told by Mrs Martin Lee that her husband could not be
present because he had suffered a stroke. Goh was under the impression that
Martin Lee was wholly incapacitated even though Mrs Martin Lee did not say so
explicitly.  
  
During this meeting, it was agreed that the appellants would purchase the
property. They also reached an in-principle agreement that the appellants`
solicitors M/s Pereira & Tan would take over the conduct of the appeal from
M/s Rodyk & Davidson, who were then the solicitors in charge. Following the
meeting, further negotiations were conducted through solicitors and the
agreement was drawn up and executed by Christina Lee, as a personal
representative, and by Goh on behalf of the appellants. The agreement set out
in brief the relevant history of the property.  
  
Some of the material terms of the agreement are: (i) the purchase price would
be $2m; (ii) a deposit of $50,000 would be paid to Christina Lee who would
return the same if the appeal was not successful; (iii) the appellants would
bear the costs of the appeal regardless of the outcome; (iv) if the appeal was
successful, the sale and purchase would be completed within ten weeks
thereafter but such completion was subject to certain conditions, and two of
the material conditions are the following:

> _
>
> 11 Completion of the sale and purchase herein is further subject to the
> following:
>
> ...
>
> (b) The approval of the court for the sale of the property since more than
> six years have elapsed since the date of death of the deceased;
>
> (c) The vendor [Christina Lee] obtaining the probate/letters of
> administration in respect of the estate of the deceased which the vendor
> hereby confirms she is presently in the process of obtaining.
>
> _

  
  
The sanction of the court is necessary by virtue of s 35(2) of the
Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 63) (`CLPA`) which states that no
sale of land belonging to the estate of a deceased person shall be made by the
legal personal representative(s) of that person after the expiration of six
years from his death unless with the sanction of the court.  
  
Eventually this court allowed the appeal and dismissed Wama bte Buang`s claim:
**Lee Martin & Anor v Wama bte Buang** [1994] 3 SLR 689 .  
  
However, the proceeding in OS156/90 was not the only problem which beset the
property. There were also two other adverse possession claims against the
property. In Suit 191/92, the claimant was one Amir bin Ahmad. The appellants`
solicitors took over the conduct of this suit from M/s Rodyk & Davidson and
had the case dismissed by the court on 22 January 1996. In Suit 1182/94 the
claimant was a beneficiary of the estate of a deceased brother of Wama bte
Buang. Again, the appellants` solicitors succeeded in having this suit
dismissed on 14 November 1994.  
  
Even though the agreement did not refer to the other two suits, the
appellants, in accordance with the spirit of the agreement that the estate
should not be out-of-pocket of any expenses, also bore the costs of having the
two suits dismissed. Furthermore, when the beneficiaries of the estate of the
deceased brother of Wama bte Buang tried to physically occupy the property,
Christina Lee permitted the appellants to take possession of the property in
order to prevent any further trespass or unauthorised occupation. According to
Goh, on the insistence of Christina Lee, the appellants, after having taken
possession, maintained the property at their own expense for almost four
years, from 11 June 1994 to 9 June 1998.  
  
In accordance with the agreement, following the successful outcome of the
appeal, two matters required attention before the purchase of the property
could be completed. The first was the extraction of the grant of letters of
administration and the second the obtaining of the court`s sanction for the
sale of the property. However, the incapacity of Martin Lee engendered some
controversy amongst the deceased`s descendants over who should administer the
estate. At first, both the respondent and his sister, Pat Lee, wanted to be
appointed as administrators of the estate in place of their father. Christina
Lee objected to this. The respondent then changed his mind and wanted to be
made a co-administrator together with Christina Lee. Again, Christina Lee
refused. When the respondent and his wife were appointed as the Committee, a
caveat was lodged by them in the probate application in respect of the estate
of the deceased to prevent Christina Lee from extracting the grant of letters
of administration. Eventually Christina Lee agreed to the respondent being
appointed as a co-administrator together with herself. As mentioned above, on
28 July 1995, the original grant to Christina Lee and Martin Lee was revoked
and in substitution thereof Christina Lee and the respondent were duly
appointed as co-administrators of the estate of the deceased. The grant was
extracted on 14 August 1996.  
  
Following the extraction of the grant, the appellants` solicitors made several
requests that an application be made to the court to obtain the requisite
sanction under s 35(2) of the CLPA. When no satisfactory response was
forthcoming from Christina Lee or the respondent, the appellants took out OS
1174/97 against Christina Lee and the respondent for an order compelling them
to file the necessary application for sanction. However, this originating
summons was never served because the appellants` solicitors and the estate`s
solicitors were trying to seek an amicable solution.  
  
The attempts failed and on 20 May 1998, the respondent commenced OS 611/98
against the appellants for a declaration on the validity or otherwise of the
agreement. Two main grounds were relied upon by the respondent to contend that
the agreement was not binding on the estate. Firstly, there was a lack of
authority on the part of Christina Lee. She could not bind the estate without
the consent of the co-administrator, Martin Lee, who at the time was
incompetent. Secondly, the sanction of the court for the sale of the property
to the appellants pursuant to the agreement was not obtained.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

The learned judge below had no difficulty in rejecting the respondent`s second
contention because the completion of the transaction was clearly made subject
to Christina Lee obtaining the requisite court sanction under s 35(2) of the
CLPA. However, relying on the case of **Hudson v Hudson** [1737] 1 Atk 460; 26
ER 292 he held that the agreement was not binding on the estate because
Christina Lee, a co-administratrix in a joint administration, acting alone did
not have the authority to bind the estate. The learned judge also rejected the
appellants` contention that the respondent was estopped from asserting that
the agreement was not binding on the estate, as he was involved in some of the
negotiations leading to the conclusion of the agreement. He felt that either
Christina Lee had the power to bind the estate, or she did not. Furthermore,
the appellants had not proven any facts to support the submission.  
  
**_This appeal_**

****

Before us the same issues were canvassed as was done in the court below. The
following broad issues are raised in this appeal.

(a) whether the agreement is valid and binding on the estate of the deceased;

(b) whether the respondent is estopped from denying that the agreement is
valid and binding on the estate.  
  
**_Whether the agreement is valid and binding on the estate_**

****

The bulk of the appellants` submission on this issue concerns the question
whether a co-administrator must act jointly with the other administrator(s) in
order to bind the estate. The appellants also addressed briefly the question
whether the execution by Christina Lee of the agreement, before the letters of
administration was extracted, was validated by the doctrine of relation back  
  
The crux of the issue is whether administrators have joint and several
authority to deal with the assets of the deceased such that the act of one of
them is binding on the other and the estate.  
  
At common law, there are basically two lines of authorities. On the one hand
there are the cases of **Hudson v Hudson** [1737] 1 Atk 460; 26 ER 292, **Earl
of Warwick v Greville** [1809] 1 Philim 123, **Bell v Timiswood** [1812] 2
Phill Ecc 22; 161 ER 1066 and **Stanley v Bernes** [1828] 1 Hagg Ecc 221; 162
ER 564 which held that administrators must act jointly. However, in the recent
case **Fountain Forestry Ltd v Edwards & Anor** [1975] Ch 1, Brightman J,
after a review of the cases and following **Smith v Everett** [1859] 29 LJ Ch
236, assumed, without deciding, that an administrator could act without the
concurrence of the other administrator(s).  
  
We will now briefly examine these cases, starting with the most ancient of the
lot, **Hudson v Hudson** [1737] 1 Atk 460; 26 ER 292 where the joint
administrators of the deceased estate appointed two attorneys to get in the
effects abroad of the intestate. Eventually one of the administrators, without
the consent of the other, settled an account with the agents, received the
moneys due from them and gave them a general release. This administrator died
and the other administrator subsequently instituted proceedings to set aside
the stated account and the release. Hardwicke LC held that one administrator
could not release a debt or convey an interest so as to bind the other and
that the position of an administrator was different from that of an executor.
He reasoned:

> _But the case of executors differs essentially from that of administrators;
> executors receive all their power and interest from the testator, and though
> before they can maintain an action they must prove the will ..._

> _... the interest arises not from the probate, but from the testator;
> therefore an executor may release a debt, or assign a term before
> probate**(Dyer, 367 a, pl 39. Mead v Lord Orrery, post, 3 vol 239)** , and
> if after probate he sues for the same, the precedent act done by him may be
> pleaded in bar: if an executor appoints another to be his executor, and
> dies, he is immediate representative to the first testator, but on the death
> of an administrator, his whole interest determines, and administration **de
> bonis non, & c,** must be granted._

> _So if a creditor makes his debtor his executor, the debt is totally
> extinguished, and cannot be revived, (1) though the executor should
> afterwards die intestate, and administration de bonis non, & c, of the first
> testator should be granted: but if a debtor be appointed administrator, that
> is no extinguishment of the debt, but a suspension of the action, and his
> representative on his death would be chargeable at the suit of the
> administrator **de bonis non, & c,** of the first intestate **Salk 299; 8 Co
> 135**._

> _The right of an administrator is expressed so differently in the books, as
> if they were at a loss how to describe it. In 8 Co 135b, it is called an
> authority, because the administrator has nothing to his own use;
> in**Vaughan** , 182, it is with greater propriety called a private office of
> trust, ..._

> _If therefore an administration be in the nature of an office, what will the
> consequence be in the present case? for if an office is granted to two, they
> must join in the executing the acts of the office, and one cannot act unless
> in the name of both, and on this kind of reasoning the present case will
> depend.`_

  
  
In the later case, **_The Earl of Warwick v Greville_** (supra), the court
(Sir John Nicholl) in considering competing proposals for appointment as
administrators said:

> _It has been correctly stated that the court never forces a joint
> administration because, if the administrators were at variance, it almost
> put an end to the administration. Further, the court prefers ceteris paribus
> a sole to a joint administration, because it is infinitely better for the
> estate; administrators must join and be joined in every act, which would not
> only be inconvenient to themselves, but, what is of more consequence, must
> be inconvenient to those who have demands on the estate either as creditor
> or as entitled in distribution._

  
  
A couple of years later in **_Bell v Timiswood_** (supra), again a case of
competing applications for the grant of letters of administration, Sir John
Nicholl repeated his views that co-administrators must act jointly:

> _The court never forces a joint administration and for an obvious reason;
> because it is necessary for administrators to join in every act, there might
> be a complete contrariety of action, and it would be in the power of one of
> them to defeat the whole administration._

  
  
Finally, in **_Stanley v Bernes_** (supra) the court was asked to allow the
joint administrators, instead of entering into a joint administration bond, to
enter into separate bonds for half the proposed sum for each administrator.
This was refused by Sir John Nicholl who could

> _... see no necessity for it, nor would any advantage result, because
> administrators must always act jointly; they cannot, like executors, act
> independently._

  
  
The other line of authority is reflected in the recent case **_Fountain
Forestry v Edwards_**(supra). There, the widow and the son of the deceased
were jointly granted letters of administration. The son entered into a
contract with the plaintiffs which was expressed to be made between himself
and the widow of the one part and the plaintiffs of the other. The widow did
not sign the contract and refused to execute the conveyance. The plaintiffs
sought specific performance against the son and widow. There was evidence that
the son never consulted the widow on the contract. The plaintiffs submitted
that one administrator had the power to bind the estate. Brightman J first
reviewed the position of an executor and held that at common law one of two
executors was competent to sell or contract to sell an asset forming part of
the personal estate of the deceased. He said that as a result of statutory
intervention, between 1898 and 1925, one of two executors could contract to
sell and convey leaseholds and pure personalty but could not contract to sell
or convey freehold land. Further statutory intervention occurred in 1925 by
virtue of the Administration of Estates Act 1925, under which the position
would appear to be that one of two executors is now able to enter into a
contract binding on a deceased`s estate to sell freehold and leasehold land
and pure personalty of the deceased although he cannot implement that contract
in relation to freeholds without the concurrence of his co-executor(s) or an
order of court.  
  
Turning to the position of administrators, Brightman J termed it a `difficult
question`. Having considered the facts in **_Hudson v Hudson_** he felt that
the views expressed therein on the point were strictly obiter, as Hardwicke LC
proceeded to decide (p 284):

> _first, that the attorneys were accountable to the administrators in their
> personal capacity and not in their representative capacity and that
> therefore a release by one principal was sufficient, as in the case of joint
> creditors: secondly, that the release was unfair and collusive and ought to
> be set aside in equity._

  
  
Brightman J then referred to what was an unreported case, **_Willand v Fenn_**
(cited in 2 Ves Sen at 267) where **_Hudson v Hudson_** was not followed and
where it was apparently held that no distinction in this regard should be
drawn between executors and administrators. But he recognised that there was
some doubt as to what was precisely decided in **_Willand v Fenn._**  
  
He also noted the views expressed by Sir John Nicholl in **_Warwick v
Greville_** and **_Stanley v Bernes_** as well as the decision in **Smith v
Everett** [1859] 29 LJ Ch 236. In this latter case, where the question was
whether all the executors of an estate must participate in the settlement of a
partnership of which the deceased was a partner, Romilly MR said:

> _It is a settled principle with respect to executors, that any two may
> settle an account; in fact, one may settle an account, and it binds the
> other, though it may be a question as between co-executors whether they are
> liable to each other or whether they are liable to their cestuis que trust
> for acting improperly ... There was, then, a question whether the same
> principle extended to administrators, and later authorities have held that
> it does._

  
  
Brightman J made two observations on the views of Romilly MR which we have
just quoted. Firstly, the remarks about the position of administrators were
clearly obiter. Secondly, in one report of the case, the words `and later
authorities have held that it does` did not appear although they appear in two
other reports.  
  
We would add a third observation to that. Though Romilly MR referred to `later
authorities`, not a single case was cited. Viewed also in the light of the
second observation of Brightman J, one cannot help but entertain much doubt as
to what was exactly said by Romilly MR.  
  
Brightman J`s conclusion on the whole question was (at p 285):

> _It appears to me that there is no decisive authority which answers the
> question whether one administrator, acting without his co-administrator, has
> the same power of disposition as an executor acting without the concurrence
> of his co-executor. But having regard to the statement of Romilly MR that
> the question was settled by 1859 in favour of the administrator who acts
> alone, I am content to assume for present purposes that the view which he
> expressed was a correct interpretation of the law._

  
  
In **_Williams on the Law of Executors Administrators_** (13th Ed, 1953) the
learned authors, relying on **_Willand v Fenn_** and **_Jacomb v Harwood_** 2
Ves Sen 265, 268; 28 ER 172 stated that `despite earlier views to the
contrary, it seems to be now settled that one of two or more administrators
stands in the same position as one of two or more executors.` We note that the
views of these learned authors were relied upon by Whitton J in **Chia Foon
Sian v Lam Chew Fah & Anor** [1955] 1 MLJ 203  where it was held that `the act
of one administrator binds the other`. But it seems to us clear that in
**_Chia Foon Sian_** this point was not one upon which full arguments had been
advanced by counsel for the parties. In fact, the two main issues in **_Chia
Foon Sian_** were (i) whether the authority of an administrator takes effect
on the date of the grant or the date on which the grant was extracted; and
(ii) whether and the extent to which an administrator was bound by his own
acts as executor de son tort.  
  
In the latest edition of Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks: **_Executors
Administrators and Probate_** (17th Ed, 1993) the learned authors state that
(at p 690), under a joint grant of representation, the act of one
representative is regarded as the act of all unless there is statutory
provision to the contrary and that the position is the same for executors and
administrators. A similar view is also taken in 17 **_Halsbury`s Laws of
England_** (4th Ed) at para 1082:

> _A joint representative is regarded as a single person. Accordingly, one of
> several executors may give a good discharge for a debt due to the estate,
> and settle an account with a person accountable to the estate, even, it
> would appear, against the dissent of his co-executor, and**it seems** that
> the same principle applies to joint administration. [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
In the light of these divergences of views, the position under common law is
far from clear. In fact, in none of the authorities were the views expressed
therein absolutely necessary to decide the case and even in **_Fountain
Forestry_** Brightman J did not decide the point but made an assumption. As
far as executors are concerned, it is accepted by a whole line of authorities
that an executor (if there are more than one executors for the estate) can
bind the estate. So is there anything which differentiates an administrator
from an executor so much so that the law should confer upon an administrator
competence vis-.-vis the estate which is different from or less than that of
an executor?  
  
In **_Hudson v Hudson_** Hardwicke LC had highlighted the differences between
an executor and an administrator, both in respect of their sources of power
and their competence. It seems to us that the different sources of power of
the executors and administrator are an important consideration to the
question. This was a point noted by Warren LH Khoo J in **Syed Ali Redha
Alsagoff (administrator of the estate of Mohamed bin Ali, deceased) v Syed
Salim Alhadad** [1996] 3 SLR 410 , where he said that unlike the position of
an administrator, the appointment of an executor was presumed to be founded
upon the special confidence which the testator had in him and thus an executor
was therefore allowed to transmit his powers to his own executor as a person
in whom he has equal confidence. Such confidence on the part of the deceased
is not present in so far as administrators are concerned.  
  
There is another factor which we think is also germane to the determination of
the question in hand. Section 6(1) of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap
251) provides that:

> _Probate or letters of administration shall not be granted to more than 4
> persons in respect of the same property, and letters of administration
> shall, if there is a minority or if a life interest arises under the will,
> be granted either to a trust corporation, with or without an individual, or
> to not less than two individuals.`_

  
  
It seems to us that implicit in this provision is the premise that
administrators must act jointly. If an administrator could act alone then why
would the statute provide that if a minority or a life interest is involved
there would have to be at least two administrators or the administration would
have to be granted to a trust corporation. This requirement for two
administrators is obviously intended as a safeguard. That safeguard would be
wholly negated if one administrator could act independently and bind the
estate.  
  
We think there is considerable force in the argument that an administration is
in the nature of an office and where two or more persons are appointed as
administrators, they should act jointly in the discharge of that office.
Furthermore, in the interest of orderly administration of an estate, there is
also much to be said in favour of the proposition that all the administrators
of an estate should act jointly. People who deal with an estate must be able
to deal with it confidently that the estate would fulfil its bargain. This
would not be achieved if each administrator could act individually in his
separate ways. We appreciate that this argument would apply just as aptly to
executors. But then the common law position of an executor is too well settled
for us to revisit it de novo. We would mention in passing that since the
decision in **_Fountain Forestry_** there is a further statutory intervention
in England. By s 16 of the English Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act 1994, an executor cannot act separately in creating a binding contract for
the sale of land. For such a contract the personal representatives must act
jointly.  
  
Accordingly, we hold that administrators of an estate must act jointly and the
act of one administrator cannot bind the estate, unless that act is ratified
by all the administrators.  
  
**_The doctrine of relation back_**

****

Before turning to consider the doctrine of relation back, it is necessary to
consider if an administrator has the authority to enter into any contract on
behalf of the estate before the extraction of the grant. As stated above, the
sources of the powers of an executor and an administrator are clearly
different. An executor derives his title from the testator`s will, whereas an
administrator derives his title from the grant of the letters of
administration. The property of the testator vests in an executor from the
time of the testator`s death. In the case of intestacy, the estate of the
deceased would, by virtue of s 37 of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap
251) and, until the grant of administration, rest in the Public Trustee
(before 1 October 1997 it would have vested in the Chief Justice: see s 4 of
the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1997). On the grant of
administration, the property of the estate would vest in the administrator(s).
However, such vesting of the property in the administrator(s) does not confer
on the latter the authority to deal with those assets until the
administrator(s) extract the order of the grant: see **Chay Chong Hwa & Ors v
Seah Mary** [1984-1985] SLR 183  [1984] 2 MLJ 251 , a decision of this court
which was affirmed by the Privy Council.  
  
There LP Thean J (as he then was), who delivered the judgment of the court,
explained the position as follows ([1984-1985] SLR 183, 187; [1984] 2 MLJ 251,
254):

> _... Plainly, this section [s 37] concerns only with the vesting of
> property, movable and immovable, of a person dying intestate so as to avoid
> a situation where the property of the deceased is not vested in anyone. The
> mere vesting of such property by operation of law does not authorise an
> administrator to deal with the same. He must proceed to extract the grant of
> letters of administration and only upon such grant being extracted is he
> clothed with the authority and power to deal with the property of the
> deceased. Under s 2 of the Probate and Administration Act letters of
> administration means a grant under the seal of the court issuing the same
> authorising the person or persons named therein to administer an intestate`s
> estate in accordance with the law._

> _In our opinion, without extracting the grant of letters of administration
> of the estate of the deceased, the fourth appellants are unable to complete
> the sale of the deceased`s undivided one quarter share of the property._

  
  
However, counsel for the appellants sought to limit the scope of the
principles enunciated in **_Chay Chong Hwa_** by arguing that what it decided
was that an administrator may not complete a sale of property without
extracting the grant. It did not mean that an administrator may not enter into
an agreement. In **_Chay Chong Hwa_** the first, second and third appellants
and one Lee Ee Hoong (the deceased) were registered proprietors as tenants in
common over a certain property. The fourth appellants were the administrators
of the estate of the deceased. By an agreement, the appellants agreed to sell
the property to the respondent. However, at the time the agreement was entered
into, the fourth appellants had not extracted the grant of letters of
administration of the estate of the deceased. The respondent took up an
originating summons seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the fourth
appellants produce the grant of the letters of administration before the
respondent could be called upon to complete the purchase of the property. The
judge granted the declaration.  
  
It is true that in **_Chay Chong Hwa_** the court was not dealing with the
specific point whether an administrator has the authority to enter into an
agreement binding on the estate before the grant is extracted. But taking from
the reasoning of the court there, that the authority of an administrator to
deal with the property of the deceased stems from the extracted grant,
entering into an agreement for sale is to deal with the property. Perhaps the
point would become clear if we look at the problem from another angle. If, as
the appellants contend, that the agreement is valid and enforceable, could the
buyer sue for specific performance of the agreement? If he cannot, as we think
that is the position, it must mean that the agreement is not enforceable and
the reason for that can only be that he has no authority to deal with the
property. Accordingly, we hold that Christina Lee had no authority to enter
into the agreement before the grant was extracted.  
  
This is where the doctrine of relation back becomes relevant. The
administrator`s title to the assets of the estate vests in him from the time
the grant of the letters of administration is extracted. The doctrine of
relation back is an exception to that rule. The doctrine permits the title of
the administrator to relate back to the time of the death of the deceased so
as to give validity to certain acts done by an administrator before the
letters of administration are extracted. The object and scope of the doctrine
is described in 17 **_Halsbury`s Laws of England_** (4th Ed) paras 735 and 736
as follows:

> _In order to prevent injury being done to a deceased persons` estate without
> remedy, the courts have adopted the doctrine that upon the grant being made
> the administrator`s title relates back to the time of death. This doctrine
> has been consistently applied in aid of an administrator seeking to recover
> against a person who has dealt wrongfully with the deceased`s chattels or
> chattels real. It is also applicable against a person dealing wrongfully
> with the deceased`s real estate. It cannot be applied, however, to disturb
> the interests of other persons validly acquired in the interval, or to give
> the administrator title to something which has ceased to exist in the
> interval._

> _The doctrine of relation back is also applied to render valid dispositions
> of the deceased`s property made before the grant when it is shown that those
> dispositions are for the benefit of the estate, or have been made in the due
> course of administration. The disposition need not have been made by the
> person who ultimately obtains the grant, provided that it is ratified by the
> administration on obtaining the grant ... Although, after grant, the
> administrator may enforce a contract entered into before grant, he is not
> estopped in an action brought after grant from setting up his title of
> personal representative to defeat his own acts before grant._

  
  
In **_Executors, Administrators & Probate _** by Williams, Mortimer and
Sunnucks, the learned authors explained the doctrine in this manner (at p 90):

> _The general proposition that letters of administration do not relate back
> to the date of death is subject to a number of exceptions or apparent
> exceptions which apply by statute or at common law where this is for the
> benefit of the estate. The test is objective, that is to say, the grant will
> `relate back` only if this actually benefits the estate and not because the
> expected administrator thinks it will benefit the estate. Although there is
> no authority on the question it is thought that the test of `benefit` must
> be as at the date of the act in question regardless of supervening events.`_

  
  
The question that arises is whether the fact, that the order appointing
Christina Lee to be an administratrix was extracted on 14 August 1996,
validates the agreement executed by her under the doctrine of relation back.
We would observe that the respondent has not challenged the bona fides of
Christina Lee in entering into the agreement. Neither has he alleged that the
property was sold at an undervalue.  
  
In this case it is not contended that the agreement was entered into in due
course of administration but rather was entered into by Christina Lee for the
benefit of the estate. The concept of `benefit` in this context is not
confined to the mere prevention of injury to the estate or preservation of the
property belonging to the estate: see **_Foster v Bates_** (1843) 12 M & W
226; 152 ER 1180, **Mills v Anderson** [1984] QB 704 and **Kechik & Ors v
Habeeb Mohamed & Anor** [1963] MLJ 127 .  
  
Thus, the pre-condition which must be satisfied is whether the agreement
entered into by Christina Lee was for the benefit of the estate. On this point
we have no doubt whatsoever. Even the respondent admitted as much: see his
solicitors` letter of 12 September 1995. At the time the agreement was
negotiated and signed, the estate had lost ownership over the property after
the High Court`s ruling in favour of Wama bte Buang, though an appeal had been
filed. By entering into the agreement, the estate was assured of being able to
pursue the appeal with the ultimate aim of recovering the property without
having to bear any costs, whatever the outcome. And, as stated before, it is
not alleged that the sale to the appellants was at an undervalue. At the time
of the agreement both sides were legally represented. In our judgment the
arrangement set out in the agreement was clearly for the benefit of the
estate; it was undoubtedly to protect and preserve the assets of the estate.  
  
In passing, we would observe that in the court below it was contended that the
sale should not be sanctioned under s 35(2) of the CLPA because the value of
the property had gone up substantially since the date of the agreement. But no
evidence has been adduced in support of this allegation.  
  
However, there is one other circumstance of the case we ought to mention. The
hearing of this appeal was first scheduled for 24 March 1999. It was adjourned
with the express object of inviting Christina Lee to participate in the
proceedings and indicate her position. Nevertheless, she chose to stay away.
She did not object to the adoption of the agreement; but neither did she
expressly indicate her ratification of it.  
  
In **Mills v Anderson** [1984] QB 704, the court held that a settlement
agreement reached by an administrator before he obtained the grant was not
binding on him (see also **_Doe d Hornby v Glenn_** 1 Ad & E 49; 110 ER 1126).
In **_Mills_** , the court also held that as the settlement was not beneficial
to the estate, the doctrine of relation back did not apply.  
  
While it is open to Christina Lee to disavow the agreement, by choosing not to
participate in the proceedings when invited, we hold that she must be taken to
have implicitly ratified the agreement.  
  
But there is still one other issue which has to be addressed. If Christina Lee
had been the sole administrator, then by the doctrine of relation back the
estate would be bound. Here, there is a co-administrator who has refused to
ratify the act of Christina Lee. Is the ratification of all the administrators
necessary for the application of the doctrine of relation back? The respondent
submitted that the doctrine does not automatically apply to validate contracts
entered into by a person who subsequently is appointed with another as joint
administrator, unless the other person upon the grant being extracted, also
ratifies the same. Neither counsel was able to render much assistance to the
court in terms of authorities. There does not appear to be any case on point.  
  
In **Re Watson, ex p Phillips** [1886] 18 QBD 116 Watson, a solicitor, was
instructed by an intermeddler, Easton, to perform certain services in relation
to the administration of the estate of the deceased. At that time there was no
personal representative. Later, one Robert Phillips was granted letters of
administration de bonis non and he refused to pay Watson for his services. The
Divisional Court held (affirmed by the Court of Appeal) that the administrator
was not obliged to pay as it must be shown not only that the services were for
the benefit of the estate but that they were rendered under a contract with
someone who subsequently by obtaining letters of administration became
authorised to bind the estate, and ratified the contract. It seems to us that
**_Re Watson_** would appear to suggest that for the doctrine of relation back
to apply the administrator who entered into the arrangement (before extraction
of the grant) should ratify the arrangement. However, in **_Re Watson_** the
question whether all the administrators should ratify, if there be more than
one administrator, did not arise.  
  
We have held above that upon the extraction of the grant, joint administrators
are required to act jointly to bind the estate. If we were to hold that an act
of one administrator done before he was duly appointed binds the estate under
the doctrine of relation back, notwithstanding the objection of his co-
administrator, then it would mean that such a person has greater competence
before his appointment than after. We are not able to see any logic in this.
In our view, consistency would demand that both administrators must ratify the
act of one before the doctrine of relation back can apply. As the concurrence
of the respondent is not forthcoming, the agreement cannot bind the estate
under the doctrine of relation back.  
  
**_Estoppel_**

****

We now turn to the second main argument of this appeal. The appellants
contended that the respondent is estopped from asserting that the agreement
was not binding on the estate. The gist of the appellants` argument is that
the respondent knowing that the appellants had entered into the agreement with
Christina Lee, as a personal representative of the estate, stood idly by for
some four years while the appellants were fulfilling the terms thereof, in the
belief that there was a binding contract with the estate.  
  
The appellants alleged that the respondent knew about the agreement and the
sale of the property as his mother had instructed M/s Rodyk & Davidson to
negotiate the terms of the agreement. In this regard, Goh asserted in his
affidavit that he was `reasonably confident that the plaintiff [respondent]
was aware of the agreement long before the commencement of these proceedings.`
There is no denial of this from the respondent.  
  
The appellants further relied on the following exchange of correspondence to
show that the respondent had reinforced their belief that the agreement was
binding on the estate. After M/s Drew & Napier was appointed as the solicitors
representing the Committee, M/s Pereira & Tan wrote to them on 9 June 1995 (CB
p 113) enquiring about the position in respect of the obtaining of the grant
of letters of administration in respect of the estate of the deceased and
stating that the appellants had already incurred substantial costs and
expenses pursuant to the agreement. Not only had they borne the costs of the
appeal as well as the costs in Suit 1192/94, they would be bearing the costs
of defending another adverse possessor`s claim in Suit 192/92 which was still
pending before the High Court at that time. In addition, they had been
incurring costs in maintaining and protecting the property against any further
attempts at trespassing by any other party. By a letter dated 12 September
1995, M/s Drew & Napier stated that the appellants` claim on the property was
disputed by the respondent because the grant of administration was not
extracted at the time of the purported agreement and therefore no one was
authorised to deal with the estate of the deceased. They also requested for
more information on how the appellants became involved in the appeal and Suit
1192/94. M/s Pereira & Tan replied in a letter dated 29 September 1995 setting
out the circumstances in which the agreement was entered into. There was no
subsequent reply refuting the contents of that letter.  
  
Thereafter, M/s Drew & Napier kept the appellants` solicitors informed of the
progress of the application and the extraction of the grant of letters of
administration. On 16 August 1996, M/s Drew & Napier informed them that the
grant was extracted on 14 August 1996. The appellants alleged that there was
no reason for the solicitors to do that if the respondent did not intend to be
bound by the agreement. Following that, M/s Pereira & Tan sent several letters
to the solicitors for the respondent and Christina Lee requesting that their
clients proceed with the necessary application under s 35(2) of the CLPA. The
respondent did not indicate that the agreement was not binding on the estate
and that therefore he would not be making the application for sanction. In the
meantime the appellants continued to maintain the property and took steps to
prevent trespassers.  
  
In the light of all the above circumstances, the appellants alleged that it
was unconscionable for the respondent to now challenge the binding effect of
the agreement some four years after its execution and when the appellants had
performed their side of the bargain and had continuously maintained the
property.  
  
Counsel for the respondent contended that there was no evidence, apart from
Goh`s bald assertion, to suggest that the respondent knew of the agreement
when it was made. M/s Rodyk & Davidson did not represent the respondent during
the negotiation of the terms of the agreement. At all material times, the
respondent was represented by M/s Drew & Napier. Since the respondent was not
involved in the negotiations at all and he had not made any representation to
the appellants, no estoppel could arise against him. Even if a representation
was made, counsel for the respondents submitted that the appellants had not
relied on the representation to their detriment because as far as they were
concerned, the agreement was a potentially profitable venture. If they win the
appeal, they would get the property and if they lose the appeal, they need not
proceed with the purchase and would lose nothing other than the legal costs.  
  
In order for the appellants to succeed in their claim in estoppel, there must
be a clear and unequivocal representation on the part of the respondent that
he did not dispute the binding effect of the agreement which was purportedly
entered into by Christina Lee and that he treated the agreement as being
valid. Although a representation giving rise to such an estoppel need not be
express and may be implied, it must, nonetheless, be clear and unequivocal.
Mere silence and inactivity will not normally suffice, and in the words of
Robert Goff LJ in **The Leonidas D; Allied Marine Transport Ltd v Vale do Rio
Doce Navegacao SA** [1985] 1 WLR 925 at p 937 `it is difficult to imagine how
silence and inaction can be anything but equivocal` (endorsed by this court in
**Fook Gee Finance Co Ltd v Liu Cho Chit and another action** [1998] 2 SLR 121
).  
  
However, it would be different where there is a duty to speak. In such a
situation the silence could amount to a representation. One example would be
in a situation like that in **Greenwood v Martins Bank Ltd** [1933] AC 51
where an account holder, knowing that his wife had been forging his signature,
failed to inform the bank of the same until the wife had died. He was estopped
from recovering from the bank the money paid out under the forged cheques. The
court was of the view that his silence had been deliberate and was intended to
produce the effect which it in fact produced, namely, leaving the bank in
ignorance of the true facts so that no action might be taken by it against his
wife.  
  
In **Spiro v Lintern** [1973] 1 WLR 1002, the defendant`s wife purported to
sell his property to the plaintiff. When the plaintiff sued the defendant for
specific performance of the contract, he contended that his wife had acted
without his authority. The court held that he was estopped from proving that
the contract had been made without his authority because he had known that the
plaintiff was acting in a mistaken belief that there was a legal obligation on
the defendant to sell the house to the plaintiff. In those circumstances, the
defendant had been under a duty to disclose to the plaintiff that his wife had
acted without his authority and his failure to do so amounted to a
representation by conduct that she had his authority. Buckley LJ opined at p
1011:

> _... in our judgment, if A sees B acting in the mistaken belief that A is
> under some binding obligation to him and in a manner consistent only with
> the existence of such an obligation, which would be to B`s disadvantage if A
> were thereafter to deny the obligation, A is under a duty to disclose the
> non-existence of the supposed obligation._

  
  
Reverting to the facts before us, the appellants claimed that the respondent
knew about the agreement at the time his mother was negotiating the terms
through her solicitors, M/s Rodyk & Davidson. In this regard, we note that
this assertion of Goh was not denied by the respondent on affidavit even
though his counsel purported to give evidence from the bar by alleging
otherwise in his written submissions. Although we are unable to attach much
legal significance to this because until the respondent was appointed the
administrator for the estate, his inactivity or silence could not reasonably
be interpreted by the appellants as any form of representation in respect of
the dealings with the estate property, we would say this much. By the time the
respondent and his wife were appointed to be the Committee of his father, the
respondent would have known the state of affairs regarding the property and
the agreement. It is inconceivable that his mother did not tell him since he
would be managing his father`s affairs. The fact that he entered a caveat
against Christina Lee extracting the order soon after his appointment to the
Committee clearly indicated that he was appraised of the affairs of the
estate.  
  
We are of the view that the respondent`s conduct subsequent to his appointment
amounted to a representation that he was not disputing the validity of the
agreement. He was appointed a joint administrator with Christina Lee on 28
July 1995, though the order was not extracted until 13 September 1996. By 29
September 1995, the respondent was fully appraised of the fact that the
appellants had incurred substantial expenditure in the appeal and in Suit
1182/94. They continued to incur additional expenditure in defending Suit
191/92 and in maintaining the property to prevent further trespassing until
June 1998. The respondent undoubtedly knew that all these acts were done on
the faith of the validity of the agreement. The respondent did nothing to
dispel that notion. Instead, he stood by while the appellants continued to
incur expenditure thinking that they would eventually obtain title to the
property. In fact, the impression created by his conduct was that the
agreement was binding as his solicitors continued to update M/s Pereira & Tan
on the progress of the application for the extraction of the grant of
administration, which was a necessary condition to be fulfilled under the
agreement. Bearing in mind that the respondent was represented by solicitors
throughout this period, it is not unreasonable to assume that he had been
advised as to the legality of Christina Lee`s acts. In such circumstances, the
respondent was under a duty to inform the appellants that he did not intend to
ratify the agreement. It is significant that soon after the respondent and his
wife were appointed to be the Committee for his father on 10 August 1994 they
lodged a caveat in the probate application to prevent Christina Lee from
extracting the grant. Yet the respondent took no steps even after the order
was granted on 28 July 1995 appointing him and Christina Lee as joint
administrators, to inform the appellants that he would not accept the
agreement and that the appellants should not continue to incur further
expenses in safeguarding the property. His failure to do so is a clear
representation that everything was in order.  
  
We are unable to comprehend the respondent`s argument that the appellants had
suffered no detriment as a result of such representation. We are not concerned
at all with the question of whether the appellants had struck a commercially
viable deal by entering into the agreement. In our judgment, the appellants
had relied on the respondent`s silence and had continued to incur expenditure
towards the preservation of the property which they would not otherwise have
done. That was the detriment they suffered. In this regard, we found the
following passage from Spencer Bower and Turner: **_The Law Relating to
Estoppel by Representation_** (3rd Ed, 1977) at p 111 instructive:

> _It is further to be noted that a representee is deemed to have altered his
> position, not only when he has adopted a positive course of action which he
> would not have adopted but for his belief in the truth of the
> representation, but also when he has abstained from taking measures for his
> protection, security or advantage which he had in contemplation, and which,
> but for the representation, he would have taken; or**when he has persisted
> in a line of conduct which he would have abandoned or was on the point of
> abandoning**. [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
Having carefully considered all the circumstances, we are satisfied that in
this case the elements needed to be fulfilled to raise estoppel have been
satisfied and accordingly we find that the respondent is estopped from
asserting that the agreement does not bind the estate.  
  
**_Judgment_**

****

Accordingly, we would allow the appeal with costs here and below. As the
appellants have succeeded on only one out of two main issues canvassed, we
order that they be entitled to half costs. There shall be the usual
consequential orders.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
