Choo Han Teck J:

1 The facts of this case have been dealt with in the main judgment on the
question of liability. This judgment concerns this court’s decision on the
issue of damages assessed as a result of the breach of contract by the first,
third and fourth defendants in failing to purchase the plaintiff’s stake,
amounting to 2.5% in Distribution Management Solutions Pte Ltd. In the
assessment proceedings the plaintiff and his expert witness Mr Vishal Sharma
(“Mr Sharma”) testified whereas the defendants called no evidence, and only
the first defendant had filed a submission challenging the evidence of the
plaintiff.

2 The first question concerns the date at which the value of the shares ought
to be ascertained. Mr Fong, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that although
the date of the breach would be the date normally taken for the purposes of
assessment of damages, he asked, on the authority of _Ho Kian Siang & Anor v_
_Ong Cheng Hoo & Ors_ [2000] 4 SLR 376 (“ _Ho Kian Siang_ ”) that the date of
the judgment, namely, 30 June 2006, be used in this case. I am of the view
that _Ho Kian Siang_ does not apply because _Ho Kian Siang_ concerned the case
where a plaintiff had abandoned his claim for specific performance and sought
damages-_in_ -_lieu_. The plaintiff in this case pursued his claim for
specific performance all the way to the end of the trial. His claim for
damages was an alternative claim, weakly pursued. I would therefore assess
damages on the basis of the value of the shares as at the date of the breach,
namely, 30 April 2005.

3 The contract price for the plaintiff’s shares was $4.5m, of which $750,000
had been paid. Mr Sharma valued the shares as at 30 April 2005 to be $180,000.
Had the 30 June 2006 date been used as the operative date, the value of the
shares would be $220,000. He referred to three ways of valuation, including
the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) approach favoured by Mr Ng, counsel for the
first defendant. The other two methods were the “market approach” and the “net
asset value” method. Mr Sharma decided that in this case because of the
absence of any financial projection, the most reliable method was the net
asset value method. Although Mr Ng performed admirably in testing Mr Sharma on
the usefulness of the DCF method, I am of the view that Mr Sharma’s
disagreement was not unreasonable, and in the absence of any countervailing
expert’s view, I would accept Mr Sharma’s evidence. The burden of proof on the
first defendant to persuade me that the DCF method ought to have been used was
not discharged.

4 Accordingly, I would award damages at $3.57m against the first, third and
fourth defendants jointly with interest at 5% per annum from date of judgment.
The interest shall be calculated from the date of judgment. Cost is to be
taxed if not agreed.
