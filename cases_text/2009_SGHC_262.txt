Civil Procedure – Striking out  
  

23 November 2009 |   
---|---  
  
Tan Lee Meng J:

1 The appellant, Nico Marine Pte Ltd (“the company”), is a tug and barge
operator. The respondents, Mr Abdul Hamid, Mr Amrin Alex, Mr Denny Aritonang,
Mr Nur Hakim, Mr Nur Ikhwan and Mr Rasyidin Ar, who are Indonesian seamen and
the company’s former employees, instituted the present proceedings on 29 July
2008 to recover what they claim to be outstanding wages owed to them by the
company.

2 On 27 May 2009, the company’s application for the respondents’ claim to be
struck out was dismissed by Assistant Registrar Tan Wen Hsien (“AR Tan”). On
25 September 2009, I dismissed the appeal against AR Tan’s ruling and now give
the reasons for my decision.

3 The respondents do not deny that they had received from the company what
they thought had been the wages and allowances under their contracts of
employment with the company. However, after they left the company, they
discovered that the crew agreements, which had been submitted by the company
to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (“MPA”), showed that their
wages were in fact more than what they had been paid. The respondents did not
know about this discrepancy because Mr Goh Wee Hang (“Goh”), the company’s
employee, had forged all their signatures on the said agreements before
transmitting them to the MPA. Why this was done is not clear at this stage but
what is evident is that the respondents did not get to see the crew agreements
and they did not know that they had not been paid the amounts stated therein
as their remuneration.

4 Goh’s machinations came to light after the respondents had ceased to work
for the company when Goh was prosecuted for his wrongdoing and fined $1,600.
The police had also investigated whether or not Goh had benefited from the
forgeries in question.

5 It is the respondents’ case that they had been misled by the company with
respect to their real wages. The seriousness with which the MPA views the
wages of crew may be gleaned from its instructions to masters of vessels,
which include the following:

  
2  
  
3 |  The Merchant Shipping Act requires the Master of every Ship … to enter into an Agreement with every Seaman whom he carries to sea as one of his Crew…. In order to enable the Crew to know the contents of the Agreement, the Master, at the commencement of the voyage, is bound … to have a legible copy (omitting the signature) posted up in some part of the ship which is accessible to the Crew. Every erasure, interlineation or alteration in the Agreement (except additions in shipping substitutes or persons engaged after the first departure of the ship) is inoperative unless proved to have been made with the consent of all the persons interested, by the written attestation … of a Superintendent, or elsewhere, of a Consular Officer.  
---|---  
  
6 The respondents complained that with Goh’s forgery of their signatures, the
company managed to give the MPA the impression that they had all seen and
signed the Crew Agreements when the truth is that they had not seen the said
agreements. The company thus succeeded in keeping them in the dark about their
real wages during the time they worked for the company. They asserted that as
the company had represented to the MPA that the amounts stated in the
falsified Crew Agreements were their real wages, the company was liable to
reimburse them the difference between their wages as stated in the said
Agreements and what they had already received from the company.

Whether the action should be struck out

7 When considering whether or not the respondents’ action should be struck
out, reference may first be made to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), which provides as follows:

(1) |  The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading  
or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or
in the endorsement,  
on the ground that —  
---|---  
|  (_a_) |  it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;  
|  (_b_) |  it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;  
|  (_c_) |  it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or  
|  (_d_) |  it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,  
and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered
accordingly,  
as the case may be.  
  
8 As the court’s power to strike out an action is rather draconian, an action
should not be too readily struck out. In _Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong
Jin_ [1998] 1 SLR 374 (“ _Gabriel Peter_ ”), the Court of Appeal explained at
[18] as follows:

In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of striking
out should be invoked. … It should not be exercised by a minute and protracted
examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to see if the
plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of the courts has been
that, where an application for striking out involves a lengthy and serious
argument, the court should decline to proceed with the argument unless, not
only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the pleading but, in addition,
it is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity for a trial or
reduce the burden of preparing for a trial.  
---  
  
9 In contrast, where a case is hopelessly doomed to fail, it should be struck
out. In _Bandung Shipping Pte Ltd v Keppel TatLee Bank Ltd_ [2003] 1 SLR 295,
Chao Hick Tin JA noted at [34] that to allow a claim that is hopeless to
proceed further for trial would be to compel the defendants to expend time and
money in defending a case which obviously had no merit whatsoever.

10 In the present case, the company asserted that the respondents’ claims are
doomed to fail because they are unfounded and baseless. The company contended
that it is not responsible for the forging of the respondents’ signatures in
the crew agreements and pointed out that it is illogical for the respondents
to mount a claim for wages long after leaving its employment when they had not
complained about the matter when they were its employees.

11 The position is not as straightforward as claimed by the company. The
respondents’ counsel, Mr Navinder Singh, relied on _Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co_
[1912] AC 716 for the proposition that depending on the circumstances, an
employer may be liable for the fraud of his employee. Mr Singh also asserted
that Goh and the company are parties to the fraud against the respondents and
that he is entitled to cross-examine Goh and the company’s directors to prove
this assertion. I agree that whether or not the company is responsible for
Goh’s fraud cannot be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence alone.

12 The company also asserted that some parts of the respondents’ claims are
doomed to fail because they are time-barred. However, in respect of the
allegedly barred claims, the respondents have pleaded fraud and relied on s 29
of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), the relevant part of which
provides as follows:

29(1) |  Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act –  
---|---  
|  (a) |  the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent ….;  
|  (b) |  the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person as aforesaid; ….  
the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has
discovered the fraud …  
or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.  
  
13 Whether or not the respondents’ claims are time-barred can only be known
after issues relating to Goh’s fraud in relation to the crew agreements
submitted to the MPA and the company’s liability for his fraud have been fully
ventilated at a trial.

14 For the reasons stated, I dismissed the company’s appeal against AR Tan’s
decision. The respondents are entitled to costs with respect to the appeal.
