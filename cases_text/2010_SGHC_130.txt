Introduction

1 This is an application by the plaintiff, Gammon Pte Limited, for an
injunction to restrain the defendant, JBE Properties Pte Ltd, from receiving
payment from BNP Paribas Singapore on a performance bond.

Background facts

2 The defendant is a developer and the owner of a building at 6 Handy Road
(“the Building”). By a letter of award dated 19 January 2006, the defendant
engaged the plaintiff to construct the Building for a sum of $11,515,000. SCDA
Architects Pte Ltd (“SCDA”) was engaged as the architect and the
superintending officer for the works. The contractual completion date was 17
May 2007. However, SCDA certified an extension of the completion date to 16
August 2007.

3 During the period between 12 October 2007 and 7 January 2008, defects with
the façade cladding of the building were highlighted to the plaintiff through
the issuance of superintendent officer instructions (“SOIs”). The plaintiff
undertook to rectify these defects in its letter dated 28 January 2008.

4 On 12 February 2008, SCDA issued the completion certificate certifying
completion on 16 January 2008 (“completion certificate”). Enclosed with the
completion certificate was a schedule of 52 outstanding classes of defects. To
date, not all the defects have been rectified by the plaintiff. Owing to the
plaintiff’s failure to remedy the outstanding defects despite several
reminders by the defendant, the defendant called on the performance bond on 6
and 27 February 2009 to fund the completion of the rectification work to be
done by other contractors engaged by the defendant.

The performance bond

5 The relevant terms of the on-demand performance bond excerpted in the
defendant’s submissions are as follows:

Now in consideration of the Employer not insisting on the Management
Contractor paying ten (10) percent of the total value of the Contract as a
security deposit for the said Contract, we (at the request of the Management
Contractor) hereby agree as follows:

1\. In the event of the Management Contractor failing to fulfil any of the
terms and conditions of the said contract, we shall indemnify the Employer
against all losses, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise sustained by the
Employer thereby up to the sum of Singapore Dollars One Million, One Hundred
and Fifty One Thousand and Five Hundred Only (S$1,151,500.00) (“the Guaranteed
Sum”) upon receiving your written notice of claim for payment made pursuant to
Clause 4 hereof.

2 We shall not be discharged or released from this guarantee by any
arrangement between yourself and the Management Contractor with or without our
consent or by any alteration in the obligations undertaken by the Management
Contractor or by any forbearance whether as to payment, time, performance or
otherwise.

…

4 This guarantee is conditional upon a claim or direction as specified herein
being made by you by way of a notice in writing addressed to us and the same
being received by us at 20 Collyer Quay #04-01 Tung Centre Singapore 049319
within 180 days from the expiry of this guarantee…

…

5 We shall be obliged to effect the payment required under such a claim or
direction within 30 business days of our receipt thereof. We shall be under no
duty to inquire into the reasons, circumstances or authenticity of the grounds
for such claim or direction and shall be entitled to rely upon any written
notice thereof received by us (within the period specified in Clause 4 hereof)
as final and conclusive.

Unconscionability

6 The plaintiff did not dispute that there were outstanding defects but
alleged that it would be unconscionable for the defendant to call on the
performance bond. It is settled law in Singapore that in addition to fraud, an
injunction to restrain a call on a performance bond may be granted on the
ground of unconscionability. Whether unconscionability can be established
largely depends on the factual matrix of each case.

7 The Court of Appeal in _Dauphin Offshore Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v The
Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan_ [2000] 1
SLR(R) 117 at [38] cited _Raymond Construction Pte Ltd v Low Yang Tong & Anor_
[1996] SGHC 136 (per Lai Kew Chai J, at [5]) for the proposition that:

…The concept of ‘unconscionability’ to me involves unfairness, as distinct
from dishonesty or fraud, or _conduct of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in
good faith_ that a court of conscience would either restrain the party or
refuse to assist the party. _Mere breaches of contract by the party in
question … would not by themselves be unconscionable_. … [emphasis added]

Outstanding sums due to defendant inclusive of the cost of rectification

8 The outstanding sums due to the defendant to date inclusive of the cost of
rectification of outstanding defects were set out by the defendant in its
written submissions as follows:

OUTSTANDING SUMS DUE TO THE DEFENDANT  
---  
S/No |  Item of claim |  Amount (SGD)  
1 |  Rectification of non-cladding defects in SOI 266/08 based on the lowest quotation from TLT dated 15 April 2009 (inclusive of GST) |  $455,905.60  
2 |  Rectification of Cladding Defects in SOI 266/08 and SOI 271/08 (awarded to Weng Thai Construction) |  $2,200,800.00  
3 |  Technical Support & service by Econflo Systems |  $321.00  
4 |  Replacement of Door panels & Base unit side gable by KHL Marketing |  $2,323.80  
5 |  Claim from the tenant of #04-02 due to the inhabitable condition of the unit during defects rectification |  $1,052.50  
6 |  Liquidated damages from Extended Completion Date to Completion Date  (17 August 2007 to 16 January 2008: 153 days at $2,000 per day) |  $306,000.00  
**SUB-TOTAL** |  **$2,966,402.90**  
SUMS CERTIFIED TO THE PLAINTIFF  
7 |  Interim Certificate No 22  |  ($582,528.31)  
8 |  Interim Certificate No 23 |  ($563,676.00)  
**SUB-TOTAL** |  **$1,146,204.31**  
**NETT AMOUNT DUE TO THE DEFENDANT** |  **_$1,820,198.59_**  
  
  

9 The defendant justified the call on the performance bond on the basis that
the outstanding sum due to it was $1,820,198.59 (which included a sum of
$2,200,800 as the cost of rectification of the cladding defects).

10 In my view, the plaintiff had shown a strong prima facie case of
unconscionability. The glaring item was defendant’s claim of $2,200,800 for
the rectification of cladding defects in SOI 266/08 and SOI 271/08 which
according to the defendant was awarded to Weng Thai Construction (“WTC”) on 10
February 2009. The plaintiff alleged that the award to WTC was a sham. The
letter of award was a one page document with no scope of work detailed at all.
No time frame to carry out the work was specified. The method of rectification
was not stipulated. The address of WTC was an HDB flat which appeared to be
owned and occupied by one Mr Teoh Weng Thai. WTC did not appear to have any
expertise in design, fabrication and installation of cladding. WTC operated as
a sole proprietor and was owned by someone not known in the industry. WTC’s
incompetence in carrying out the rectification works was confirmed by its
supposed intention to appoint another entity, CLK Systems Pte Ltd, to carry
out the work. The price of $2,200,800 for the contract awarded to WTC was
wholly out of proportion to the value of the works. By comparison, the sub-
contract awarded to Seiko for the design, supply and installation of the
curtain wall and glazing works was for only $1,690,000. The portion to design,
fabricate, supply and install the aluminium panel cladding for the whole
façade of the building was only S$371,664. However, the price quoted by WTC
for merely rectifying the defects to the aluminium panel cladding was a hefty
six times more.

11 I concluded that WTC’s tender price of S$2.2 million essentially to repair
some 83 relatively minor cladding defects was astronomical and grossly
inflated so as to enable the defendant to justify the call on the full sum of
the performance bond. Serious questions had crossed my mind as to whether
there was collusion between the defendant and WTC in this regard.

12 According to the plaintiff, the defendant still had not paid the plaintiff
the following sums:

(a) |  Interim Certificate No 22/09 dated 21 January 2009 |  $543,000.00  
---|---|---  
(b) |  Interim Certificate No 23/09 dated 16 April 2009 |  $526,800.00  
(c) |  Retention (2.5%) |  $287,875.00  
(d) |  Admitted prolongation costs |  $347,237.64  
|  TOTAL |  $1,704,912.64  
  
  

13 On top of this sum due to the plaintiff, the defendant still sought to call
on the performance bond for a further sum of S$1,151,500. The total amount in
excess of $2.9m which the defendant claimed the plaintiff owed primarily for
defective works amounted to more than 25% of the original contract value of
$11,515,000, which the defendant awarded to the plaintiff to construct the
_entire_ building. It would in my view be most surprising that SCDA would have
issued a completion certificate certifying that the works were in all respects
completed (save for 52 minor outstanding works) when some $2.9 m worth of
rectification works remained outstanding if the defendant were to be believed.

14 This indicated to me that there was gross exaggeration of the costs of
rectification of outstanding defects made in support of the defendant’s call
on the bond. A call on the performance bond in this fashion was clearly
unconscionable, abusive and bordered on being fraudulent.

15 In _GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd and another_
[1999] 3 SLR(R) 44, the Court of Appeal addressed an instance where the call
would be unconscionable at [24]:

... We are concerned with _abusive_ calls on the bonds. It should not be
forgotten that a performance bond can be used as an oppressive instrument, and
in the event that a beneficiary calls on the bond in circumstances, where
there is _prima facie_ evidence of fraud or unconscionability, the court
should step in to intervene at the interlocutory stage until the whole of the
circumstances of the case has been investigated. ... [emphasis added]

16 In the course of the hearing, I asked the plaintiff to obtain quotations so
that a comparison could be made with WTC’s tender price. The quotations
obtained by the plaintiff were so much lower than those obtained by the
defendant. Five quotations were obtained and the highest of those was $560,000
based on a total replacement of the panels. The next highest quotation was
$335,000 based on repairing the panels. These were nowhere near the amount
quoted by WTC. These huge discrepancies confirmed my belief that WTC’s price
of $2,200,800 for the panel repairs had been grossly inflated. I had grave
doubts that WTC’s quotation for the rectification work obtained by the
defendant was not a sham.

Orders made

17 Accordingly, I made the following orders:

(a) Call on the bond is to be deferred until further order, with liberty to
apply;

(b) All rectification works to be completed by the plaintiff within 6 months.
Inspection of rectification work to be carried out in the month of October
2010;

(c) Any dispute on the quality of the rectification works in accordance with
the warranty will be determined by the court. If the court determines that the
rectification works in accordance with the standard set out in the warranty is
not satisfied, the court may direct that, subject to call on the bond, a joint
tender be carried out in order to rectify the balance of the unrectified
defects as determined by the court. The completion of the balance of
rectification works, through the joint tender, shall be deemed to be in
accordance with the standard set out in the warranty. The specifications for
the contractors for the joint tender, shall be the original specifications for
the works; and

(d) Costs are reserved.
