**JUDGMENT:**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. This is an appeal against some parts of a decision by the District Judge
Mrs Emily K Wilfred on ancillary matters of a divorce petition.

2\. The parties are David Chan Teck Hock (the Husband) and Leong Mei Chuan
(the Wife). They were married on 21 September 1983 but unfortunately their
marriage eventually floundered.

3\. On or about 10 February 1997, the Husband left the matrimonial home.

4\. On 21 November 1997, the Wife petitioned for divorce and a Decree Nisi was
granted on 24 September 1998.

5\. The parties then fought over the ancillaries and on 20 January 2000, the
District Judge made an Order on various aspects of the ancillaries, some of
which are the subject of appeal by the Husband and some by the Wife.

6\. I set out below those parts of the Order which are the subject of appeal
by either party:

> (1) The Wife has sole custody, care and control of the 3 children of the
> marriage with reasonable access to the Husband as follows:
>
> [The details of access are not material for the appeals before me. However,
> the Husband is appealing for an order that on the issue of the childrens
> education, the Wife is to consult and obtain his prior consent. His appeal
> in respect of the childrens religion was withdrawn before me.]
>
> (2) The Husband is to pay the Wife a sum of $16,000 per month for the
> maintenance of the 3 children and the Wife ($5,000 per child per month and
> $1,000 per month for the Wife) with effect from 1 January 2000 and
> thereafter the first day of each month, payment to be made directly.
>
> [The Husband is appealing that the maintenance be reduced to:
>
> (a) $8,000 per month for the children as follows:
>

>> (i) $3,500 for the eldest child Cheryl,

>>

>> (ii) $2,500 for the second child Sean, and

>>

>> (iii) $2,000 for the youngest child Valerie, and

>
> (b) $500 per month for the Wife.
>
> On the other hand, the Wife is appealing that (a) the maintenance for her be
> increased to $5,000 per month, and (b) the maintenance for her and the
> children be paid with effect from February 1996.]
>
> (3)
>
> (4)
>
> (5) The Wife shall be entitled to 15% of the Husbands Dell stocks, namely:-
>

>> (i) 111,100 shares purchased from the open market and valued at
US$4,575,986.80;

>>

>> (ii) 10,821 shares bought from the Employee Stock Purchase Plan valued at
US$445,695; and

>>

>> (iii) The gains from Dell stocks vested and exercised by the Respondent
under the Non-Statutory Stock Option Agreement scheme amounting to
US$2,573,328 less tax to be paid on such gains (proof on demand of payment
from the IRAS).

>
> [The Wife is appealing for 30% instead of 15%.]
>
> (6) There shall be no division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Stock
> Option Agreements which have yet to be vested in the Husband.
>
> [The Wife is appealing for a 30% or 15% share.]
>
> (7)
>
> (8)
>
> (9)
>
> (10)
>
> (11)
>
> (12)

7\. The Wifes appeal with regard to a property in Gold Coast, Australia, was
withdrawn before me.

Childrens education

_**

8\. I refer to para 5 of the Grounds of Decision (GD) of the District Judge:

> There had been umpteen applications for access since 1997 and the parties
> had resorted to communicating with each other through their lawyers on every
> small issue concerning the children. It can be gleaned through their
> numerous affidavits that their relationship was highly contentious and
> acrimonious. I could not foresee the parents cooperating with each other on
> the education and religion of the children. Furthermore I was of the view
> that (_sic_) children were old enough to voice their own views on such
> matters and if the wife was to force her views on the children, they could
> inform their father who could then make the necessary application to court .
> With regard to education, the children are already attending schools. In all
> fairness, the husband has not accused the wife of being incapable of raising
> the children. In fact he consented to her having care and control of them. I
> was of the view that it would be detrimental to the welfare of the children
> if I made an order that the husbands consent be obtained on matters of
> religion and education in view of their acrimonious relationship.

9\. I have considered the many affidavits filed by the respective parties. The
acrimony between the parties is clear.

10\. In my view, it is unrealistic to compel the Wife to consult and seek the
prior consent of the Husband on the childrens education. That would be a
recipe for disaster.

11\. As the Husband has consented to the Wife having care and control of the
children, he should not qualify his consent by imposing the condition which is
the subject of his appeal before me. Much as he loves the children, he should
come to terms with the situation.

**_

Maintenance

_**

12\. Section 69(4) of the Womens Charter (Cap 353) 1997 Edition requires the
court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case when ordering
maintenance for a wife or child including various factors listed as (a) to (h)
under sub-section (4).

13\. The Wifes job history is as follows:

> | _Description of Job_ | _Remuneration per month_ |  _Duration of Employment_  
> ---|---|---|---  
> (a) | Private Banker with Citibank | $3,000 (1983) | 1983 1989  
> | N.A. | $5,000 (1984) |   
> (b) | Private Banker with the Royal Bank of Canada  
>  (The Wife alleged that she $12,000 resigned to follow the Husband to Tokyo at his request. The Husband said she resigned because she was having problems with an ex-boss. The reason for the Wifes resignation is not material to me.) | Started with $11,000 and then increased to | 1990 1991  
> (c) | Regional Treasurer with Carnaud Metal Box (Pte) Ltd (the name was described differently and the spelling was different between paras 74 and 85 of the Wifes AEIC)  
>  (The Wife resigned at end 1993 presumably to look after 3 children) | $13,000 | 1993  
> (d) |  Private Client Advisor with Kim Eng Securities (Pte) Ltd | $4,000 (basic salary excluding bonus) | 19/8/96 and still continuing.  
  
14\. The Wife said she received $13,000 per month from the Husband when she
resigned from her job with Royal Bank of Canada. This was for six months and
the Husband was to continue paying for family and household expenses. The
Husband said the $13,000 per month was to include the family and household
expenses and the Wife was supposed to look for a job.

15\. It is immaterial to me whether the $13,000 per month was to include or
exclude family and household expenses. It was obviously given to the Wife
because she had resigned from her job. She had also accompanied the Husband to
Tokyo. It was a special situation then.

16\. As can be seen from the Wifes job history, the Wifes earning capacity was
quite great. However she alleged that all her previous jobs required her to
travel on a frequent basis. Subsequently, she decided not to take a job which
required her to travel as that would mean leaving the children alone for long
periods. Her present job with Kim Eng Securities (Pte) Ltd was taken on the
basis that she does not have to travel at all, hence her low income (see para
96 of her affidavit filed on 30 August 1999).

17\. However, although the Wifes current basic salary is $4,000 per month, she
is entitled to receive a bonus.

18\. I had asked for the Form IR8A and Notice of Assessment of the parties for
Year of Assessment (YA) 1999 and YA 2000.

19\. For YA 1999, the Notice of Assessment shows the Wifes income from
employment to be $42,736. This was less than $4,000 a month but it was not
explained to me why this was so.

20\. For YA 2000, the Notice of Assessment shows her income from employment to
be $92,657 which was about $7,700 per month.

21\. The Husband was working with IBM but stopped in about March 1994\. His
job history from 1994 is as follows:

> | _Description of Job_ | _Remuneration per month_ | _Duration of Employment_  
> ---|---|---|---  
> (a) | Managing Director of Quorum Growth (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Quorum) (but subsequently instead of being paid direct, his services were rendered through CSV Holdings Pte Ltd (CSV) so that his income from Quorum would be paid to CSV. CSV is jointly owned by the Husband and the Wife although not in equal shares. The income from Quorum was re-directed in January 1996 by the Husband to another company which he had incorporated with his brother-in-law). | About $36,000 (including bonus) | 3/94 - 5/96  
> (b) | \-- | Unemployed | 6/96 - 12/96  
> (c) | Dell Computer Asia Pte Ltd (Dell Asia) | (a) $24,730 (from Feb 98)  
>  (b) $27,001 (from Jul 98)  
>  (c) $28,352 (from 1/3/1999) | According to affidavit evidence, the Husband worked for Dell Asia in Singapore from 1/1/97 to March 98 and then went to work for the same company in Hong Kong.  
> |  |  | The tax return filed in Hong Kong shows that his income from Hong Kong started from 1 October 1998.  
  
22\. The Husbands income from Dell Asia was not confined to his basic salary.
Aside from allowances, he was also entitled to receive a bonus provided
targets were met.

23\. For 1998, the Notice of Assessment shows his income from employment in
Singapore was $181,405. The Form IR8A indicated that this income from
Singapore ceased on 30 September 1998.

24\. The Employers Return of Remuneration & Pensions for Hong Kong income for
the year ended 31 March 1999 showed his income for six months from 1 October
1998 to 31 March 1999, excluding various allowances, to be HK$820,438 (i.e
about $182,320 at an exchange rate of, say, HK$4.5 to S$1). There was nothing
for bonus.

25\. It is easier to consider the Employers Return for Hong Kong income for
one full year from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. This was HK$1,792,829 for
salary and HK$1,333,283 for bonus, i.e a total of HK$3,126,112 (or about
$694,692 at the same exchange rate). This works out to $57,891, say, $58,000
per month (including bonus) or about S$33,200 per month (excluding bonus).
Neither figure includes G & S allowance, Auto allowance and Stock Purchase
discount or gains realised from stock options for the Husband.

26\. At this stage, I refer to the case of _Susy Suryani Santoso v Lee Kong
Eng & Alexis Khoo_ (Divorce 1704/98 and RAS 95 and 96/99). In that case,
Justice Judith Prakash ordered that the husband pay additional maintenance
based on each months bonus received by the husband if and when he was paid any
bonus. Her decision on this point was reversed by the Court of Appeal but no
written reasons were given.

27\. I am of the view that the decision of the Court of Appeal does not mean
that bonuses should never be taken into account on the issue of maintenance.
Each case must depend on its own particular facts and it should be borne in
mind that bonuses may not be paid or, if paid, may not be for the same sum
each year.

28\. Prior to the District Judges order on maintenance, there were two earlier
orders for maintenance.

29\. On 2 February 1998, the Wife applied for maintenance. The parties then
consented to an order dated 13 February 1998 under Summons No MSS 265/1998
(the 1st Maintenance Order).

30\. Under the 1st Maintenance Order, the Husband was to pay $11,000 per month
for maintenance of the Wife and the three children with effect from 15
February 1998 and thereafter on the 15th of each month.

31\. Just a few months later, the Wife applied on 25 June 1998 for an increase
in the maintenance.

32\. The parties again consented to an order this time dated 13 August 1998
and made under Summons No MSS 3099/1998 (the 2nd Maintenance Order).

33\. Under the 2nd Maintenance Order, the Husband was to pay $14,500 per month
for maintenance of the Wife and three children with effect from 15 August 1998
and thereafter on the 15th of each month.

34\. However the 2nd Maintenance Order was made without prejudice to the
ancillary issues to be dealt with in the divorce petition. The 1st Maintenance
Order did not have this qualification.

35\. While Counsel for each party stressed that the 2nd Maintenance Order was
made without prejudice to the ancillaries, neither was too keen to say much,
if anything, as to why her client had agreed to the amount of maintenance
ordered under the 1st Maintenance Order. The reason for this was obvious. In
the case of the Husband, he was seeking less than what had been ordered
thereunder and in the case of the Wife, she was seeking more.

36\. After considering various factors, as set out in paras 15 to 17 of her
GD, the District Judge made an order for maintenance at $16,000 per month, as
set out in para 6 above.

37\. In so far as the Husband had sought to use the 1st Maintenance Order and
the 2nd Maintenance Order against the Wife, he was not entitled to use the 2nd
Maintenance Order to do so as it was made without prejudice to the ancillaries
(even though the without prejudice qualification may have been included at his
request). The without prejudice privilege applies to both parties and Mrs
Anamah Tan for the Husband did not contend otherwise.

38\. As for the 1st Maintenance Order, it can be taken into account for or
against either of the parties, and not just against the Wife.

39\. It is incumbent on either party seeking less or more than what had been
ordered under the 1st Maintenance Order to justify why a decrease or increase
should be allowed.

40\. As for the Wife, her Counsel Ms Kanya submitted that when the Wife agreed
to the $11,000 per month, this was because the Husband was supposed to
continue paying the utility bills, payments in respect of the matrimonial home
as well as supermarket expenses. These were paid by GIRO and when the Husband
stopped the GIRO payment subsequently, the Wife sought an increase in
maintenance which resulted in the 2nd Maintenance Order.

41\. However, this reason turned out to be untrue.

42\. Under the 1st Maintenance Order, the Wife was to pay for the mortgage,
TAS, PUB, maintenance charges and property tax for the matrimonial home. The
1st Maintenance Order was silent about the subsequent supermarket expenses. I
am of the view that it was for the Wife to require an express stipulation if
the Husband was to continue paying supermarket expenses.

43\. In any event, the Wife herself did not give the reason which Ms Kanya
gave when the Wife sought an increase in maintenance which resulted in the 2nd
Maintenance Order.

44\. In the Wifes second complaint which led to the 2nd Maintenance Order, she
gave the following reasons for seeking an increase to about $33,000 per month:

> 2(a) That the maintenance sum of $11,000-00 is insufficient to meet the
> needs of the Complainant and the children of the family.
>
> (b) That the Respondent has not fully declared his means to the Court and is
> able to support the family in the sum to be varied.
>
> (c) That the Respondent has not been paying sufficient maintenance since
> January 1996.

45\. I am of the view that her paragraph 2(c) is not a valid reason for
increasing maintenance from a consent order.

46\. As for her paragraph 2(a), I do not agree that $11,000 per month is
insufficient to meet the needs of the children and the Wife. Whether it is
sufficient to enable them to live in the lifestyle they were used to is
another matter.

47\. The real reason for the Wife seeking an increase was her paragraph 2(b).
This reason is reiterated in paras 25 to 28 of her affidavit filed on 12
August 1998 i.e one day before the 2nd Maintenance Order was made.

48\. Furthermore, in para 20 of her Affidavit of Evidence in Chief 1st for the
Ancillary matters filed on 25 June 1999 (AEIC) the Wife said that she was
seeking maintenance of at least $33,000 per month, based on the Respondents
last known income earned in Singapore of $840,416.15 in 1997, and his last
known income earned in Hong Kong, for the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March
1998, of HK$18,735,755. This income was earned by the Respondent prior to his
promotion from Vice President, Asia Direct, to President of Dell, Hong
Kong/China. This translates to an (_sic_) approximately monthly income of
S$382,297.26.

49\. This reinforces the point that her ground for seeking an increase in
maintenance in June 1998 and later in her AEIC for ancillaries was because she
had found out more about the Husbands income.

50\. The question I have to consider is whether there is some basis for the
Wife to say that she would not have agreed to $11,000 per month had the
Husband not misrepresented his income.

51\. From the correspondence between solicitors and the Husbands own affidavit
filed on 11 August 1998 in respect of the 2nd Maintenance Summons, it is clear
to me that the Husband had said that he was earning slightly over $20,000 per
month when the Wife first agreed to $11,000 per month for the 1st Maintenance
Order (of 13 February 1998).

52\. The Husband sought to explain this away by saying that he was not asked
to state the exact figure. Even so, I am of the view that he was giving a
lower round figure than he should have and he had omitted to mention his
eligibility for bonus.

53\. I am of the view that the Wife has established that she would not have
agreed to the $11,000 per month had the Husbands true income then been
disclosed and certainly not when his income for the year 1 April 1999 to 31
March 2000 (see para 25 above) is known.

54\. However, I have still to consider the alleged expenses for the children
and her.

55\. For this purpose, I start with the Wifes initial claim for maintenance
which led to the 1st Maintenance Order. She had listed out various alleged
expenses.

56\. According to Ms Kanya and Mrs Tan, the total of the alleged expenses
amounted to $24,340.14.

57\. Both Counsel then assumed that the Wife had claimed maintenance of about
$24,000 per month.

58\. I noted that both Counsel had used an incomplete complaint made by the
Wife under s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Item 5 of the complaint in
which the Wife was to state the amount of maintenance claimed was blank.
Therefore I asked for a copy of the completed complaint to be provided to me
and eventually this was done.

59\. As it turned out, the completed complaint showed that the Wife was then
claiming $21,000 (and not $24,000) per month as maintenance for herself and
the three children. This is quite telling because it was a claim she had made
before she was misled about the Husbands income.

60.In just under five months, she was subsequently alleging that her expenses,
and corresponding claim for maintenance, had increased to $33,000 per month
for her 2nd claim for maintenance.

61\. The Wife provided a list of alleged expenses for her 2nd claim for
maintenance. She also provided a list of such expenses in her AEIC (for
ancillaries) and it is this list which I have considered. It appears to me
that she had inflated her expenses in an attempt to justify her claim for
$33,000 per month. Also, some of the items should not be included in a
maintenance order.

62\. For example, the Wife included insurance premiums for policies she had
taken out. These appeared to have a savings or investment element in them as
the premiums were rather high bearing in mind the sums insured. The Wife did
not deny this but considered it right that the Husband should pay the
premiums. I do not agree. When the policies mature, the Wife or the children
will have the benefits and not the Husband.

63\. The Wife also claimed for monies given to her mother and for making gifts
to relatives and friends. While a court would encourage filial piety and
generosity, this cannot be at the expense of the Husband.

64\. Also, in claiming for household expenses, the Wife was claiming for a
household of seven i.e herself, the three children, a maid and her parents.
She gave the reason that her parents were helping to take care of the children
but I do not accept that the parents contribution to the care of the children
was to such an extent that it was right to compel the Husband to provide for
household expenses for the parents.

65\. The Wife also said that the amounts paid by CSV from 1994 to January 1995
would support her claim of expenses amounting to about $33,000 per month. She
alleged that all payments by CSV were for such expenses. I have considered the
payments made by CSV during this period. Some of the payments for large sums
were to the Husband or to the Wife for their respective salaries. Some were
for their respective credit card expenses and it was unclear what other
payments to the Husband were for. Some of the other payments were also
dubious, eg there were payments of $1,000 a month to Leong Kuan Swee (the
Wifes father) for transport, presumably as some sort of chauffeur, of $800 a
month to Tan Cheng Poon (the Wifes mother) for tuition, and of $2,000 a month
to Kam Swee Kee (the Husbands mother) for tuition. I doubt that such payments
were genuinely for chauffeur services or for tuition. They were probably to
draw money out from CSV for these relatives.

66\. At this point, I would mention that the Husband sought to use the Wifes
new list of alleged expenses to his advantage. That new list had three
headings: (a) Household Expenses, (b) the Wifes Expenses and (c) the Childrens
Expenses. The Childrens Expenses amounted to slightly over $9,000 per month.
Using this, the Husband said that $8,000 per month for the children was fair
after taking into account some exaggeration on the part of the Wife.

67\. I am of the view that the Husbands approach was not correct. Obviously
some of the Household Expenses would also be for the account of the children.
Furthermore, he himself had consented to maintenance of a total of $11,000 per
month for the Wife and the children under the 1st Maintenance Order and yet
was now seeking to convince the court that it should be $8,500 per month (ie
$8,000 per month for the children and $500 per month for the Wife).

68\. Mrs Tan did not give any reason why the Husband had agreed to $11,000 per
month in the first place.

69\. Coming back to the Wifes appeal for an increase in maintenance, Mrs Tan
had submitted that the Wife was trying to have two bites at the cherry, first,
by using the Husbands stock options to claim higher maintenance and, secondly,
by claiming a share in the Husbands stock options in the division of
matrimonial assets.

70\. Ms Kanya denied this. She referred to para 15 of the GD in which the
District Judge had determined that the Husbands average monthly income was
$44,281 without taking into account his stock options or gains therefrom.

71\. However, I note that in para 20 of the Wifes AEIC, the contents of which
I have cited in para 48 above, the Wife did take into account the Husbands
gains from stock options when she was seeking $33,000 per month as maintenance
(see also para 40(2)(g) and (h) at p 32 and p 307 and 310 of the Wifes AEIC).

72\. In any event, at present, the Wife is no longer seeking $33,000 per month
in her appeal before me but $20,000 per month (instead of the $16,000 per
month allowed by the District Judge) for the children and herself. The
increase of $4,000 per month is sought for herself.

73\. In the light of Ms Kanyas argument, as mentioned in para 70 above, it
appears that Ms Kanya is not relying on the stock options to seek the
additional $4,000 per month for the Wife. Accordingly, I am disregarding the
stock options for the issue of maintenance.

74\. After taking into account the Wifes initial claim for maintenance, the
amount consented to under the 1st Maintenance Order and the factors I have
mentioned as well as the factors listed in s 69(4) of the Womens Charter, and
using a broad-brush approach, I am of the view that the maintenance should be
$15,000 a month and that it should be spread more evenly among the children
and the Wife, ie $4,000 per month for each of the children and $3,000 per
month for the Wife.

75\. Taking into account the Wifes income, she should have $19,000 per month,
even if she does not receive bonuses, for the children and herself.

76\. On the part of the Husband, he will have enough for himself even if he
does not receive bonuses.

77\. According to paragraph 18(ii) of Mrs Tans submissions, the Husband has
left Dell Asia since October 2000. However, Mrs Tan pointed out, and I agree,
that this is not relevant because I am not dealing with an application or
appeal based on a change of circumstances.

**_

Back-dating of maintenance

_**

78\. The Wife has sought maintenance from February 1996 on the basis that the
Husband has not provided any maintenance since then. Accordingly, if the
maintenance ordered by the District Judge is increased under the Wifes appeal,
the Wife is also seeking that the increase be back-dated to start from
February 1996.

79\. The claim for the maintenance to be back-dated to February 1996 was
mentioned in an affidavit of the Wife but Mrs Tan pointed out to me that it
was not pursued in the submissions on the Wifes behalf to the District Judge.

80\. Furthermore, if the maintenance is reduced under the Husbands appeal, the
Wifes position is that it should not be back-dated to the effective date of
maintenance under the District Judges order i.e 1 January 2000 or to the
effective date of maintenance under either the 2nd Maintenance Order or the
1st Maintenance Order.

81\. Ms Kanya even took the technical point that the Husbands Notice of Appeal
did not say that any reduction should be with effect from 1 January 2000.
Therefore any reduction should be from the date of my decision or thereabouts.
I am of the view that this argument is a non-starter. The Husband is appealing
from the decision of the District Judge and hence any order made by me to
reduce maintenance should take into account the effective date of maintenance
under the District Judges order.

82\. It is clear to me that the Wife is trying to have her cake and eat it.

83\. In any event, I am not satisfied that the Wife has established that the
Husband has failed to pay any maintenance between February 1996 to 15 February
1998\. Indeed I note from the completed complaint leading to the 1st
Maintenance Order that her allegation then was that the Husband had failed to
maintain her and the three children since January 1996 adequately as opposed
to at all.

84\. In the circumstances, my order on maintenance is to take effect from the
effective date of maintenance under the District Judges order i.e 1 January
2000. The 2nd Maintenance Order will cease to apply from this date.

**__**

Stock Options

85\. The Husband was employed by Dell Asia. From time to time he received
agreements from Dell Computer Corporation (the Corporation), a Delaware
corporation, to grant him stock options in the Corporation which he in turn
had apparently agreed to.

86\. The terms of each agreement are similar but not identical as I will
elaborate below.

87\. Under each agreement, the Husband was granted what is described as a Non
Statutory Stock Option to purchase a certain number of the Corporations stock.
However the option does not vest in him immediately i.e. he cannot exercise
the option immediately.

88\. Portions will vest at stated periods, for example, 20% on each of the
first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of the grant.

89\. Once the option vests, it must be exercised before a termination date
which, for example, is ten years from the date of the grant but there may be
periods of unexercisability, to be determined by the Corporation, to avoid
insider trading.

90\. Should the Husband decide to exercise a vested option, he has to give
notice for the number of shares of stock being purchased with payment of the
exercise price. I was informed by both Counsel that this had been done in the
past and the Husband then sold some shares or stock and made a profit although
there appears to be no obligation on him to sell them.

91\. Ms Kanya categorised the options into three categories:

> (a) options which have vested and which have been exercised by the Husband
> (the 1st category),
>
> (b) options which have vested but have not yet been exercised by the Husband
> (the 2nd category),
>
> (c) options which have not vested in the Husband (the 3rd category).

92\. The District Judge granted the Wife 15% of the gains from the 1st
category but nothing for the 2nd and 3rd categories.

93\. The Wifes position is that as regards the 1st category, she should be
granted 30% for her indirect contributions to the marriage as that was the
District Judges decision in respect of the matrimonial home.

94\. As for the 2nd and 3rd categories, the Wifes position is that she should
also be granted 30% of the value of the options, or alternatively, 15%.
However, Ms Kanya accepted that the options may not vest or, even if vested,
may not be exercised by the Husband. That is why she sought an if and when
order to be made rather than ask for a value to be ascribed to the 2nd and 3rd
categories.

95\. Ms Kanya also submitted that an if and when order is within the purview
of s 112(5)(e) of the Womens Charter.

96\. Section 112(5)(e) states:

> (5) In particular, but without limiting the generality of subsections (3)
> and (4), the court may make any one or more of the following orders:
>
> (a)
>
> (b)
>
> (c)
>
> (d)
>
> (e) an order postponing the sale or vesting of any share in any matrimonial
> asset, or any part of such share, until such future date of until the
> occurrence of such future event or until the fulfilment of such condition as
> may be specified in the order;

97\. In my view, s 112(5)(e) enables a court to postphone the sale or vesting
of any share in any matrimonial asset which is already vested in one or both
of the parties. It does not apply to the situation where the vesting of a
matrimonial asset is delayed under the terms of the agreement which allegedly
gives rise to the acquisition of the asset.

98\. The Amended Notice of Appeal of the Wife in respect of the 2nd and 3rd
categories seeks that:

> 3\. There be a division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Stocks Option
> agreements which _have vested but yet to be exercised by the Respondent and
> which_ have yet to be vested in the Respondent.

99\. Technically, even with the amendment, it is not appropriate to refer to a
division of Dell stocks because no Dell stock has been acquired yet as regards
the 2nd and 3rd categories. However it is clear to me that this prayer was
intended to refer to a division of the stock options under the 2nd and 3rd
categories and indeed, the submission of both Counsel proceeded on that basis.

100\. Section 112(1) and (10) of the Womens Charter (1997 Ed) states:

> Power of court to order division of matrimonial assets
>
> 112\. (1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the
> grant of a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to
> order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale
> of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of
> the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and
> equitable.
>
> (10) For the purposes of this section, "matrimonial asset" means
>

>> (a)

>>

>> (b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party
or both parties to the marriage,

>
> but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been
> acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not
> been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by
> both parties to that marriage.

101\. Ms Kanya submitted that the 2nd and 3rd categories are choses in action
and that they come within the wide definition of any other asset of any
nature.

102\. She referred to Halsburys Laws of England, Fourth Edition Reissue Volume
6 at para 8 which states:

> 8\. **Enumeration of choses in action.** In order that a more comprehensive
> idea as to the nature and extent of the expression "chose in action" may be
> formed, it may be convenient to show in some detail what kinds of things and
> property have been held to be choses in action. The following things have
> been held to be choses in action; they are grouped in five divisions for
> purposes of convenience only.
>
> (1) Debts, whether due by specialty or by simple contract, .
>
> (2) The benefit of a contract, including an option to purchase shares, ; a
> right to be issued shares in a company .
>
> (3) Recognised subjects of property, such as stock in public funds; a share
> of bank stock; shares in joint stock companies, and presumably in every kind
> of company, including stock issued by national corporations; a fund in
> court; .
>
> (4) Equitable rights to property, such as beneficial interests under trusts
> .
>
> (5) Miscellaneous rights, such as a right of action arising under contract,
> including a claim for unliquidated damages for breach of contract; .

103\. Ms Kanya further submitted that although the Singapore High Court and
the Court of Appeal have not in the past made any decision as to whether stock
options are matrimonial assets for the purpose of dividing them, these courts
have included shares or stocks for the purpose of dividing matrimonial assets.

104\. She also referred me to the American case of _Barbara Green v Michael
Green_ (8 July 1985, Court of Special Appeals of Maryland).

105\. In that case, Karwacki J, delivering the judgment of the Court of
Special Appeals of Maryland said:

> In _Deering v. Deering, 292 Md. 115, 437 A.2d 883 (1981)_ , the Court of
> Appeals held that a spouses pension rights, to the extent accumulated during
> the marriage, constitute "marital property" within the meaning of The
> Marital Property Act. The Court of Appeals emphasized that its holding
> applied to all pensions, whether vested or unvested, or whether matured or
> unmatured. This Court in _Ohm v. Ohm, 49 Md.App. 392, 431 A.2d 1371 (1981)_
> had earlier reached the same conclusion. The Court of Appeals in Deering
> noted: "It is significant that over the past several years, pension benefits
> have become an increasingly important part of an employees compensation
> package which he or she brings to a marriage unit". _292 Md.at 122, 437 A.2d
> 883_. And in Ohm, this Court identified, through citations to numerous
> cases, those jurisdictions which have held that rights under a private or
> public pension plan, to the extent such rights were acquired during the
> marriage, are property subject to division upon dissolution. We noted that
> these decisions rested upon the rationale "that retirement benefits are a
> form of deferred compensation or wage substitute and the right to receive
> such benefits, being contractual in nature, is a chose in action and thus,
> property" _Ohm, 49 Md.App. at 397, 431 A.2d 1371._
>
> As with pension plans, restricted stock option plans like those we consider
> here are a form of employee compensation, providing to the employee the
> right to accept within a prescribed time period and under certain conditions
> the corporate employers irrevocable offer to sell its stock at the price
> quoted. If the employer attempts to withdraw that offer, the employee has "a
> chose in action" in contract against the employer. We therefore conclude
> that stock option plans, like other benefits in an employees compensation
> package, constitute "property" as used in the definition of marital
> property. Furthermore, because the plans in the case sub judice granted
> stock options to the appellee while he was married to the appellant, those
> options were "acquired" during the marriage. See _Harper v. Harper, 294
> Md.54, 448 A.2d 916 (1982)._ The stock options are therefore marital
> property under the terms of 8-201(e) and as such are subject to valuation
> and equitable adjustment in the form of a monetary award, pursuant to 8-204
> and 8-205.
>
> The trial court stated in its memorandum opinion that the stock options were
> valueless because they had no "fair market value". Although it is true that
> an unassignable, unsalable option has no fair market value, it is
> nonetheless an economic resource, comparable to pension benefits, to which a
> value can be attributed. We will comment briefly upon the method by which

>
> The appellate courts of Maryland have recognized the complexity of the task
> confronting trial courts in properly valuing and allocating certain forms of
> marital property. _Deering, 292 Md. At 129, 437 A.2d 883; Ohm, 49 Md.App. at
> 405-06, 431 A.2d 1371_. An elastic approach to the problem is required so as
> to accommodate the circumstances presented by each case. _Nisos v. Nisos, 60
> Md.App. 368, 383, 483 A.2d97 (1984)._ As with pensions, the valuation and
> allocation of stock options necessitates such a flexible approach. In
> completing steps 2 and 3 of the procedure for allocating this marital
> property by formulating an equitable monetary award, the court must take
> into consideration the nature of the appellees property right in the
> options. In simple terms, the appellees property interest can be described
> as the right to choose whether or not to purchase 5,000 shares of Network
> Systems stock on certain dates at specified prices. Thus the court may not
> adopt an approach to the equitable adjustment of that property which would

> right to make a choice regarding the exercise of the options.
>
> The trial court may in its discretion, however, adopt an "if, as and when"
> approach to the valuation and equitable allocation of the unexercised
> options, including the 2,500 matured options as well as the 2,500 unmatured
> options. This approach has proven to be a workable method for the allocation
> of unmatured pensions, see _Deering, supra,_ and we believe, is equally
> effective in the allocation of stock options. We explain. Under the second
> of the three step process for the determination of a monetary award in
> adjustment of this marital property, the court must attach a value to
> options as of the date of the decree, see _Nisos, 60 Md.App. at 381-85, 483
> A.2d 97._ That value may be determined by taking into consideration the
> market value of shares of Network stock as of the time of that decree, and
> the cost to the appellee of exercising the options. The court may, then,
> pursuant to the third step of the process, determine a percentage by which
> the profits should be divided if, as and when the options are exercised.
> Under such an approach to the equitable allocation of this marital property,
> the appellee is under no compulsion to exercise his options. At the same
> time, however, the appellants equitable interest in the options, if
> exercised, is protected. We believe this approach fairly implements the
> process of adjusting the equities between the parties with respect to
> marital property as mandated by the Act.
>
> For these reasons, we hold that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its
> conclusion that the stock options were valueless and in failing to include
> them in its determination of the marital property. We will thus remand this
> case in order that the court may make appropriate findings of fact with
> respect to the valuation of those assets, and make such adjustment to the
> monetary award as it deems equitable.

106\. Mrs Tan submitted that it was arguable whether a stock option per se is
in fact a chose in action.

107\. She also submitted that it is not a matrimonial asset to be divided by
the court under s 112 of the Womens Charter. She said that our courts have
always divided tangible assets but she did not dispute that our courts have
considered shares as matrimonial assets.

108\. She sought to distinguish stock options from shares by saying that
shares are tangible and already belong to someone whereas stock options in the
2nd and 3rd categories do not yet belong to anyone.

109\. She argued that there must be certainty of ownership and to include a
stock option or a chose in action as a matrimonial asset would have far-
reaching ramifications. It will mean that a debt owing to one party would then
be a matrimonial asset but this would create a problem if the monies were not
recovered.

110\. She also argued that the Green case cited by Ms Kanya was not applicable
in Singapore as, first, the system of American matrimonial law differs from
ours as theirs is based on community property, and secondly, even within their
country, it may differ from state to state.

111\. She further argued that the Husband had not yet acquired the stock
options under the 2nd and 3rd categories. He acquires these stock options only
when the same are both vested and exercised by him.

112\. Mrs Tans main point was that there were too many uncertainties until the
options are vested and exercised by the Husband. For this argument, she
referred to various provisions in the agreements granting the stock options.

113\. One provision in point is that the options are not vested immediately
upon the execution of the stock option agreements.

114\. A second provision in point is that the vesting of the options can be
deferred, but not beyond a certain date which can be specified in the
respective agreements.

115\. A third provision in point is that the options will be terminated if the
Husbands employment is terminated for serious misconduct. If it is terminated
for reasons other than serious misconduct, options in the 3rd category will
expire then and options in the 2nd category will expire after a certain time.

116\. A fourth provision in point is that in some (but not all) of the
agreements granting the stock options, there is also a provision for the
forfeiture of option proceeds. Under such a provision, certain option proceeds
will have to be repaid by the Husband if he competes with the Corporation
within a certain time frame after the termination of his employment.

117\. Mrs Tan further supported her argument about non-acquisition by
referring to the definition of the word acquired in The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary. It defines acquire as to gain, or get as ones own (by ones own
exertions or qualities); to receive, come into possession. She argued that, By
this definition, once an asset is acquired, it is yours period and no one can
take it away from you.

118\. It is not disputed that the Green case involved the consideration of
what constitutes martial property within the meaning of a different
legislation i.e. The Marital Property Act.

119\. However, in my view, that case is authority for the proposition that a
stock option is a chose in action. This is similar to the position under
English law as set out in Halsburys Laws of England (see para 102 above). That
case also illustrates the use of an if, as and when order. I will refer to
such an order as an if and when order for simplicity.

120\. I am of the view that clearly the stock options in the 2nd category are
choses in action. As regards the stock options in the 3rd category, where the
options have not yet vested in the Husband, these are also choses in action.
The Husband has a benefit under a contract or contracts to have the options
vested in him at some future date.

121\. I am also of the view that the stock options of the 2nd and 3rd
categories come within the wide definition of matrimonial asset under s
112(10)(b) of the Womens Charter i.e. any other asset of any nature. In my
view, matrimonial asset is not confined to tangible assets.

122\. Accordingly a debt owing to one of the spouses can be a matrimonial
asset if acquired during the marriage.

123\. I do not agree with Mrs Tans argument about far-reaching ramifications.
Indeed, if she were correct, a spouse will be encouraged to lend monies to
various persons when the marriage is floundering, and then claim that such
debts should not be treated as part of matrimonial assets for the purpose of s
112.

124\. I am also of the view that any difficulty in establishing the value of a
matrimonial asset should not be confused with its existence.

125\. The uncertainties mentioned in Mrs Tans arguments are conditions
subsequent to the acquisition of the choses in action. They are not pre-
conditions to the acquisition. Accordingly, the Husband has acquired the
choses in action under the 2nd and 3rd categories.

126\. I also do not think that it is correct to describe a share as a tangible
asset but, in the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to elaborate further
on this point.

127\. As regards Mrs Tans argument that the provision for the forfeiture of
option proceeds (which would apply if the Husband were to compete with the
Corporation within a specified time frame of the termination of his
employment) demonstrated non-acquisition, this is not a valid argument. If she
were correct, then even the stock options under the 1st category cannot be
said to be acquired by the Husband if such a provision applies to those
options.

128\. As regards Mrs Tans argument that once an asset is acquired, no one can
take it away from you, this is also not a valid argument. For example, a house
bought by the Husband and mortgaged to a bank can be taken away from the
Husband if he fails to pay the bank. Yet no one would say that the house has
not yet been acquired by the Husband for the purpose of s 112.

129\. As for the definition of acquire in The Shorter Oxford Dictionary, I am
of the view that it is neither here nor there.

130\. Mrs Tan had one other argument. She submitted that the Wife had taken
all the stock options into account in determining the Husbands remuneration
for the issue of maintenance and the Wife should not be allowed to have them
taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets. Otherwise, the Wife
would be having two bites of the same cherry.

131\. I have already mentioned above that Ms Kanya is not relying on the stock
options to claim additional maintenance for the Wife and I have disregarded it
for that issue.

132\. I now turn to the District Judges reasons for not ordering a division of
the stock options in the 2nd and 3rd categories. In para 14 of her GD, she
said:

> 14\. There was no doubt that the unvested Dell stock options were part of
> the husbands salary package and although they were allotted to him once in
> every six (6) months, they were intrinsically tied up with his performance
> in the company. Furthermore if his employment were to be terminated with
> just cause, he would lose all the vested stock options, which he had
> exercised. In _Susy Suryani Santoso v. Lee Kong Eng & Alexis Khoo_ (Divorce
> 1704/98 and RAS 95 & 96/99), the wife had asked for a portion of his year
> end bonus. The court of the first instance declined to make such an order as
> bonuses were invariably a discretionary measure contingent on several
> factors e.g employees performance, companys performance and a variety of
> other imponderable conditions. On appeal, her Honour, Justice Judith Prakash
> reversed the earlier decision on the issue of bonus and ordered that "the
> husband pay the wife additional maintenance of S$6,000 for each months bonus
> received by him _if and when_ (the emphasis is mine) he was paid any bonus".
> The Court of Appeal in their oral judgment, delivered on 25th January 2000,
> reversed her decision on this issue. I declined to make a "if, as and when"
> order for the following reasons:-
>

>> the share value of the stock option was based on market value at the time
it was exercised;

>>

>> the husband had, in the past, not exercised his rights to those stock
options and this may cause the wife to enquire why he had failed to do so;

>>

>> there may be double counting as the husband was paying maintenance and the
stock options form part of his salary package;

>>

>> the "if, as and when" order was vague and posed uncertainty as there would
be liabilities to be met when he exercised those rights;

>>

>> the above order also runs contrary to the clean break principle in the
division of matrimonial asses; and

>>

>> most importantly, the unvested stock options were allotted to the husband
after the breakdown of the marriage and her indirect contribution was not
substantial enough to merit a share in his unvested stock options (see para 11
above).

133\. The case of _Susy Suryanti Santoso v Lee Kong Eng & Alexis Khoo_ cited
by the District Judge is not applicable here because there the question was
whether the husbands bonus should be taken into account for the issue of
maintenance. That point did not involve stock options or the division of
matrimonial assets.

134\. Furthermore, as there was no written judgment from the Court of Appeal
in that case, I am of the view that it is likely that the decision of the
Court of Appeal was on the particular facts in that case. It is not an
authority for the proposition that an if and when order should, generally, not
be made.

135\. As for the list of reasons given by the District Judge, I am of the view
that:

> (a) Although it may be said that the share value of a stock option is based
> on market value at the time the option is exercised, it does not follow that
> this is the only value that can be ascribed to a stock option. If the option
> is vested but not yet exercised, its value may be less, and if it is not yet
> vested, its value may be even lesser. However, as I have already said above,
> this does not detract from the fact of its existence. Furthermore, any
> difficulty in valuing share options under the 2nd and 3rd categories is not
> an adequate ground for denying their existence or for refusing to attempt to
> divide them. Thirdly, there is no need to give a value at present if an if
> and when order is made.
>
> (b) Although the Wife had made inquiry in the past as to why the Husband did
> not exercise any of the unexercised stock options, this is also not an
> adequate ground for refusing to take such options into account in the
> division of matrimonial assets. Besides, suffice it to say that the Husband
> is not obliged to exercise the stock options. If he has chosen not to
> exercise them bona fide, the Wife has no legal basis to complain. However
> if, for example, the Husband has given up any right to have the stock
> options vested in him in exchange for other rights or assets in order to
> defeat the Wifes claim, then the Wife can pursue her legal rights. However,
> the burden will be upon her to establish her assertion.
>
> (c) There is no question of double counting if the stock options are not
> taken into account for the maintenance issue.
>
> (d) While an if and when order poses some uncertainty, this is also not an
> adequate reason to disregard the stock options in the 2nd and 3rd categories
> for the purpose of division. That the Husband would have to pay the exercise
> price can be taken into account in an appropriately worded if and when
> order.
>
> (e) If such an order is vague and does not cover all the eventualities which
> subsequently arises, this can be addressed by the parties seeking
> clarification or further directions. After all, under s 112(3) to (8) of the
> Womens Charter, the court is given very wide powers to give effect to any
> order it makes for the division of matrimonial assets. Furthermore, it is
> open to the parties to agree on a lump sum settlement of the Wifes
> entitlement to the stock options rather than be troubled with having to
> comply with an if and when order.
>
> (f) I would add that the concept of stock options is not novel although it
> appears to be used more and more for so-called New Economy businesses. A
> scheme for stock options provides the answer to attracting and retaining key
> personnel without causing the businesses to fail under the weight of huge
> salaries before huge returns are achieved. Furthermore, very often, it is
> such a scheme, and not the salary, that attracts the key personnel.

136\. Therefore, it is my view that it would be only realistic to take into
account stock options in the context of maintenance or the division of
matrimonial assets, unless there are reasons on the particular facts of a case
why this should not be done. No such reasons exist in the case before me.

137\. While an if and when order would not achieve the clear-break principle,
this principle is not paramount. It must be subject to the more important
principle of justice in accordance with the law.

138\. Furthermore, if the stock options (in any of the categories) were
allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the marriage, that is a factor
in determining whether the Wife should be granted a share in them and if so,
the extent of the share. It is not a reason to deny any division outright. In
so far as the District Judge said that the Wifes indirect contribution after
the breakdown of the marriage was not substantial enough to merit a share, I
will come back to this point later below.

139\. As this stage, I need refer only to _Yeo Gim Tong Michael v Tianzou_
[1996] 2 SLR 1. In that case, L P Thean JA, delivering the judgment of the
Court of Appeal, said at p 4:

> We agree that the husbands CPF moneys accrued or accumulated prior to the
> date of the marriage should be excluded in the computation of the husbands
> assets for division under s 106 of the Womens Charter. But, we are unable to
> accept that assets acquired by a party, and in this case the husband, after
> the date of the breakdown of the marriage should not be included. Subsection
> (1) and (3) of s 106 each refer to assets acquired during the marriage, and
> the marriage is only dissolved when the decree nisi is made absolute.
> Normally the ancillary matters come before the court for hearing prior to
> the date when the decree nisi is made absolute. As a matter of practically,
> the court would take, for the purpose of determining the assets falling
> within s 106, in the case of CPF moneys of the spouses, the latest
> statements issued by the Central Provident Fund Board, and in other cases
> the assets of the spouses as of that date. _Therefore any assets acquired
> during the marriage including those acquired after the marriage has broken
> down fall to be considered under these provisions. What contribution a
> spouse makes to the acquisition of such assets during this period depends on
> the facts of the case._ In making a division under s 106(3) the court would
> have regard to the period in which the husband and wife have ceased to
> cohabit and the indirect contribution, if any, made by the wife during the
> period. In this case, the wifes indirect contribution continued: she
> continued to look after the child after she had filed the petition, and her
> contribution fell within s 106(3).
>
> [Emphasis added.]

140\. Although that case was applying s 106(1) and (3) of the then Womens
Charter (1985 Edition) which are not identical with s 112(1) and (10) of the
present Womens Charter, the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the meaning of
assets acquired during the marriage would still apply to the same phrase in
the present s 112(10)(b).

141\. I have already set out the provisions of s 112(1) and (10)(b) of the
present Womens Charter.

142\. For easy comparison, I set out the provisions of s 106(1) and (3) of the
Womens Charter (1985 Edition):

> 106(1) The court shall have power, when granting a decree of divorce,
> judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between
> the parties of any assets acquired by them during the marriage by their
> joint efforts or the sale of any such assets and the division between the
> parties of the proceeds of sale.
>
> (2)
>
> (3) The court shall have power, when granting a decree of divorce, judicial
> separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties
> of any assets acquired during the marriage by the sole effort of one party
> to the marriage or the sale of any such assets and the division between the
> parties of the proceeds of sale.

143\. I should also mention that the Wife is confining her claim to stock
options already granted as at the date of the decree nisi (whether vested or
not and whether exercised or not). This is a fair cut-off point.

**_

Share of the Wife in the stock options

_**

144\. As regards the 1st category of stock options, the District Judge had
granted the Wife a 15% entitlement.

145\. Ms Kanya submitted that the Wife should be entitled to 30% which was the
percentage granted by the District Judge to the Wife for her indirect
contribution in respect of the matrimonial home. She submitted that the same
percentage should apply to the stock options.

146\. However, the facts in relation to the stock options are not the same as
the facts pertaining to the matrimonial home. The latter had been acquired
when the marriage had not broken down.

147\. The first agreement to grant stock options to the Husband was dated 12
August 1996. The Husband left the matrimonial home in February 1997.

148\. There was no suggestion that all was well with the marriage until
February 1997. On the contrary, it is clear that some years before, the
marriage had already broken down.

149\. For example, when the Husband was performing services for Quorum between
1994 to 1996, he was already under severe stress because of his marital
problems, although I would add that he is not as blameless as he would like
the court to think.

150\. The Wife had been extremely suspicious about the Husband and harassed
his secretary on his whereabouts and even complained to his boss about him.
Apparently she also threatened to complain to the President of Dell
Corporation when the Husband was subsequently working for Dell Asia.

151\. Although the Wife denied harassing the secretary and complaining to the
boss in Quorum, I am of the view that she did complain about him and had been
harassing his secretary and him.

152\. The situation did not improve when the Husband began to work for Dell
Asia in January 1997.

153\. Thereafter, the Divorce Petition was filed on 21 November 1997. The 1st
Maintenance Complaint was filed on 2 February 1998, the 2nd Maintenance
Complaint was filed on 25 June 1998. The Decree Nisi was made on 24 September
1998. The parties were engaged in all kinds of acrimonious disputes including
access to the children which entailed the filing of numerous affidavits.

154\. It was because of these factors that Mrs Tan submitted that the Wifes
indirect contribution was a negative one and that even 15% was generous
although the Husband had decided not to appeal against the decision of the
District Judge on the 15% entitlement of the Wife in respect of the 1st
category. Mrs Tan submitted that the Wife should not be entitled to any share
of the stock options as regards the 2nd and 3rd categories.

155\. As regards the argument about the Wifes negative contribution, Ms Kanya
submitted that the District Judge had taken this argument into account and had
nevertheless granted the Wife 15% of the stock options under the 1st category.

156\. However, Ms Kanyas submission would in turn detract from her other
argument seeking 30% for the Wife for all the three categories.

157\. The District Judges reasons for awarding 15% are set out in para 11 of
her GD. It includes some of the factors I have mentioned and the fact that
notwithstanding the Wifes so-called negative contribution, the Wife was still
taking care of the children while the Husband was pursuing his career in Hong
Kong.

158\. The District Judge also took into account factors like the Wife (a)
having had exclusive use of the matrimonial house since February 1997 when the
Husband left, (b) had obtained 60% of the matrimonial property and (c) 100% of
a property in Gold Coast, Australia, although there is an outstanding mortgage
on it which the Wife will be responsible for.

159\. I am of the view that the District Judge was correct in awarding 15% of
the stock options under the 1st category to the Wife. However, I do not agree
that this should be confined to the 1st category only.

160\. I have already dealt with the District Judges reasons for declining to
give the Wife anything for the stock options under the 2nd and 3rd categories.

161\. As regards her last reason i.e that the unvested stock options were
allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the marriage, I have already
mentioned that the marriage did not breakdown only when the Husband left the
matrimonial home but some time before. Even the stock options under the 1st
category were allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the marriage.

162\. In my view, the fact that the marriage had broken down was one of the
main reasons for the District Judges decision to allot 15% instead of 30% to
the Wife for the 1st category. That reason should not be used again to reduce
the 15% to nil for the 2nd and 3rd categories.

163\. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Wife is entitled to 15% of the
stock options under the 2nd and 3rd categories.

>

>> (i) the Husband is to notify the Wife in writing within thirty days of the
sale of the stocks or shares giving rise to the net gain and to provide
supporting documents of the net gain or estimated net gain. If the Husbands
position is that he has not exercised any of the stock options and/or that he

>>

>> (ii) The net gain means the gain after deducting any amount paid by the
Husband to exercise any stock option, any fee or charge in the sale of the

>>

>> (iii) Within thirty days of the sale of the stocks or shares resulting in

notification from the Husband with supporting documents.

15% of the net gain or estimated net gain, subject to the same proviso as in
(iii) above. The monies are to be held by the Wifes solicitors in an interest-
bearing escrow account until the said term ceases to apply whereupon the
monies and interest thereon shall be paid to the Wife. However, if the Husband
is required under the said term to pay the net gain to the Corporation, then
the Wifes solicitors shall release the monies held in the interest-bearing
account to the Husband upon receipt of supporting documents that the net gains
have to be paid to the Corporation under the said term. If the interest earned
need not be paid to the Corporation, then the interest shall be paid to the
Wife.
