**JUDGMENT:**

__

The claim__

1\. The plaintiff Arul Chandran is a practising lawyer. He has been so for
more than 30 years. This case concerns an office of honour he held in the
Tanglin Club, Vice-President, for one year from 25 May 1998\. That office also
made him a member of the general committee of the Club. There were 11
committee members all told.

2\. On 31 March 1999, he was removed from office at a meeting of the general
committee. It was the result of a simple majority constituted by the six
defendants in this case : William J Gartshore, Colin A Taylor, Andre C
Bouvron, Chim Hou Yan, Chan Kong Thoe, Kenneth Chew Keng Seng.

3\. The plaintiff felt deeply aggrieved by that decision. So he commenced this
action. His purpose was to have his removal declared unlawful and ineffective,
with the result that he continued to hold that office as elected Vice-
President for the full term. Additionally, he sought as extra relief general
damages for mental distress and damage to reputation. As it was an office of
honour without an honorarium he did not assert any financial loss. When the
plaintiff’s counsel suggested general damages in the sum of $30,000 against
each defendant, I remarked that he should have gone to the District Court. In
response he mutated it to $50,000 against each defendant. According to him,
the amount of compensation the plaintiff was entitled to was directly
proportionate to the number of defendants, even though there was only one act
and one indivisible damage. He never explained the logic of this submission. I
shall not let it detain me and I shall continue with the story.

4\. In his statement of claim, the plaintiff pleaded his case on the basis of
breach of the contract of membership between the parties. The contract was a
hypothesized contract which the law constructs for the salvation of someone
who has been unfairly victimized by Club politics. At the trial, however, he
abandoned his claim for general damages for defamation against the sixth
defendant only.

5\. In respect of the expulsion, the plaintiff claimed general damages against
all six defendants on the basis that "he had suffered embarrassment,
humiliation and damage to his reputation and standing and had been unable to
and/or been unfairly and/or unjustly deprived of his elected office and/or
been unable to attend to his elected duties at the Club as Vice-President and
a member of the general committee and had suffered embarrassment, humiliation
and damages to his position as a member of the Club".

6\. At the commencement of the trial on 23 November 1999, the plaintiff
indicated that he might amend his statement of claim to plead conspiracy and
add parties for that purpose, but eventually he did not do so.

7\. The purported removal was pursuant to the following rule in the
constitution of the Club :

> Any President, Vice-President, Honorary Treasurer or Member of the Committee
> who in the opinion of a majority of the Committee behaves in a manner
> prejudicial to the interest of the Club or conducts himself in a manner
> unbecoming a Member of the Committee or the Club shall cease to hold office
> and shall be removed from the Committee.

This rule hides a power which can lead to division and destabilization in the
Club. It enables six members of the general committee to overthrow the
President or the Vice-President, who might have been elected to that office by
six hundred members of the Club. There is much room for abuse because power
tends to be abused particularly when personal prejudices are involved. As long
as that power of removal remains in the hands of the general committee
members, there is every likelihood of litigation of the kind that is before
me. It is not conducive to the good name of the Club. That is something for
the Club to ponder.

8\. The defendants sought to defend the action. The cornerstone of their
defence was that the plaintiff had acted improperly in connection with a
certain financial transaction relating to his position as a member of the
previous general committee. It went like this. The Club had taken out a
protection and indemnity insurance for the benefit of the members of the
general committee. In early 1998, all 11 members of the previous general
committee were taken to court by three ordinary members in respect of a
separate matter. The present plaintiff was a defendant in that action, in
which he decided to be his own lawyer. The other 10 defendants in that action
were represented by two sets of lawyers. The Court, Lee Seiu Kin JC, decided
against the committee members : See _**Graeme McGuire v John Rasmussen**_
[1998] 3 SLR 180. They were ordered to pay the costs of the action. Following
this, they lodged a claim against the insurance company seeking an indemnity
for their costs. The insurers agreed. As the insurance was also for his
benefit as a committee member the present plaintiff asked the insurers whether
they would pay him for the legal work he had done. He revealed to the insurers
that if they would not agree, he would not charge the Club. The insurers
agreed to pay his legal charges and eventually paid him. The amount the
plaintiff received was $17,000. The defendants in the present action felt that
there was something wrong in the plaintiff receiving that amount. It was on
that score that they acted in concert and voted him out of office. They said
that in their opinion there was sufficient justification to expel him from his
elected office of Vice-President. I should mention here that in relation to
the legal expenses and any damages the present defendants might have to pay in
this suit, they have in fact sought refuge under the same insurance facility
as the plaintiff did.

9\. The case came up for trial before me. The plaintiff was cross-examined. As
the facts unfolded before me it became evident that the act of the defendants
amounted to an unwarranted interference with the arrangement between the
plaintiff and the insurers. The Club lost nothing by his act. He had made the
claim because he believed that the insurance policy taken out by the Club was
for his benefit and that it enabled him to make a claim against the insurers.
The insurers were also of the same view. The defendants therefore concerned
themselves with something which did not in any way alter or diminish the
interest of the Club or the committee. Indeed, someone had made a complaint to
the Law Society about the plaintiff’s conduct. The Society saw no warrant to
impeach him for any impropriety. The defendants’ course of action, therefore,
was ill-founded on the facts by all accounts.

10\. In the event, even before the conclusion of the cross-examination of the
plaintiff in the trial before me, the defendants threw in the towel and
consented to judgment against themselves. The consent judgment declared as
follows : "The plaintiff’s removal as Vice-President and as a member of the
general committee of the Tanglin Club was wrongful and consequently, the
plaintiff remained the Vice-President and a general committee member of the
Tanglin Club until 25 May 1999". In addition it included a term that damages
were to be paid by the defendants. Such damages, if not agreed, were to be
assessed by the trial Judge. Damages were not agreed. More than that, the
defendants radically changed their position and said subsequently that as a
matter of law substantial damages were not payable. The matter came up before
me. The assessment proceedings, in the event, became a trial of an issue of a
point of law on damages. It should be mentioned at this juncture that in their
defence the defendants did not raise any special defence on damages.

__

Denial of liability for damages

__

11\. The arguments for the defendants were advanced by the lawyers of the
Club’s insurers. On the issue of damages their submission went as follows :
The plaintiff’s office at the Club as its Vice-President and a general
committee member was not an office of profit. Accordingly he had not suffered
any pecuniary loss as a result of his wrongful removal. In any case, the
plaintiff had not pleaded any pecuniary loss. The plaintiff was claiming
damages for breach of contract for embarrassment, humiliation and damage to
his reputation and standing. Save in very exceptional cases (of which this was
not one), such damages were not recoverable for breach of contract. The
plaintiff’s claim for damages for loss of reputation and standing could have
been brought in defamation. In that situation the defendants would have had
their defences available. He had not pursued that course of action. He had
endorsed such a claim against the sixth defendant on the writ of summons but
decided to abandon it. The plaintiff had also indicated at the start of the
trial that he might amend his statement of claim to allege conspiracy and add
parties. That, too, he had decided not to proceed with. In the premises, the
plaintiff was, at most, entitled to nominal damages, which the defendants
submitted should be limited to a sum of $1.00 each, making a total of $6.00.

A trilogy of Singapore decisions

__

12\. I shall preface the analysis of the law on the issue before me by
bethinking a trilogy of Singapore decisions on the matter. In _**Haron Mundir
v Singapore Amateur Athletic Association**_ [ 1992] 1 SLR 18 I rejected a
claim for general damages for mental distress in a club case. I did so on the
basis of _**Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd**_[1909] AC 488. In _**Haron Mundir**_
,_****_ I attempted to explain one facet of the underlying reason for the
rule. Unbeknown to me, the law had turned a full circle. I shall explain this
later. Next, _**Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd**_ [1992] 1 SLR 884
I refused a claim for general damages for injury to reputation in a breach of
contract case. Finally, in the case of _**Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong**_
[1999] 3 SLR 630 ruled that the law will not award general damages for mental
distress when damages are to be assessed on a breach of contract basis. In
that case, I made a further attempt to explain another facet of the underlying
reason for the rule. The last of the trilogy was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal in _**Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew**_.

__

Analysis of the law - Mental Distress

__

13\. I now commence an analysis of the law on the issue. Historically
speaking, English law acted on the apriorism that pure mental suffering
without physical injury was an inevitable fact of interpersonal relationships
in private and public life alike. Unlike actionable physical injury, which
arises from an external cause, mental distress stems from inherent
predisposition of the individual. As it arose from the constitution and
circumstances of the individual it did not traditionally give a cause of
action. After all, people must learn to accept with a certain degree of
stoicism the slings and arrows of this vale of tears. In such instances, they
should be slow to rush to the law with a tale of tears and fears save in
certain recognised circumstances. It makes no difference whether the event
causing such suffering was the commission of a tort or the breaking of a
contract. In the time-honoured language of the law, such suffering is too
remote for recompense at law: see _**Victorian Railways Commissioners v
Coultas**_ (1888) 13 AC 222. At one time, it was thought that this was not a
desirable situation because it failed to deter the callous conduct of
irresponsible people. So an attempt was made to move the boundary by Wright J
in _**Wilkinson v Downton**_ (1897) 2 QB 57. Notably, that was not a contract
action. Even in tort the novelty failed to flourish. It is settled law that
mental distress by itself does not constitute sufficient damage to found a
cause of action. In 1957, Devlin J stated the correct position in _**Behrens v
Bertram Mills Circus Ltd**_ [1957] 2 QB 1 at 28 : "The general principle
embedded in the common law that mental suffering caused by grief, fear,
anguish and the like is not assessable." It is apt for me to repeat here what
I said in _**Haron Mundir v Singapore Amateur Athletic Association**_ [1992] 1
SLR 18 at p 31 :

> The object of awarding damages in contract is different from tort. The
> underlying logic for the difference is that the law of contract is concerned
> with a defendant’s failure to improve the claimant’s position by his failure
> to keep a promise. In contract the loss is monetary and, being measurable in
> terms of money, is therefore special. The law of tort, on the other hand, is
> concerned with the plaintiff’s position made worse by a wrongdoing of the
> defendant. The damage is in the main non-economic and, being immeasurable,
> is general. Damages must be assessed.

14\. Furthermore, in **_Lonrho v Fayed_ (No 5)** [1993] 1 WLR 1489, the
English Court of Appeal emphatically stated that damages for injury to
reputation and injury to feelings, though recoverable in an action for
defamation, could not be recovered in an action for conspiracy. To sustain a
claim for conspiracy, actual financial loss must be proved. The bottom line
position is that in tort damages for mental suffering became a subsidiary
element in the assessment of damages.

____

Present authorities

15\. The position in contract is very circumscribed. The present state of the
law is stated clearly and concisely in _**Chitty On Contracts**_ 28th Edition,
Para 27-069 as follows :

> 27-069 - Normally, no damages in contract will be awarded for injury to the
> claimant’s feelings, or for his mental distress, anguish, annoyance, loss of
> reputation or social discredit by the breach of contract; as where an
> employee is wrongfully dismissed in a humiliating manner.

16\. _**Halsbury’s Laws of England**_ , 4th Edition, Vol 12(1) encapsulates
the current law in these words :

> 957**-** Whether damages are recoverable in contract for loss of enjoyment,
> loss of amenity, disappointment, vexation, distress or similar suffering
> caused by breach depends on the nature of the contract broken and on whether
> the innocent party suffers any accompanying physical discomfort or
> inconvenience. Such damages are awarded only exceptionally and awards are
> traditionally modest.
>
> 958 - The general rule is that a contract breaker is not liable for
> distress, frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension or
> aggravation caused to the innocent party by the breach of contract. The rule
> is one of policy and applies notwithstanding the foreseeability of the
> distress or other adverse event.

17\. The American wisdom on the matter is accurately articulated in _**Modern
Law of Contracts**_ , 1999 Revised Edition, by Howard O. Hunter at p 18-12 :

> Recovery for mental distress, disappointment, and anguish is inappropriate
> in contract actions for four reasons : (1) it is not directly related to the
> economic effect of the breach; (2) it is open to speculation; (3) it may be
> the subject of frivolous claims; and (4) it is not reasonably within the
> contemplation of the breaching party.

____

Damage to reputation

18\. Closely related to the problem of awarding damages for mental distress is
the problem of damage to reputation. As far back as English legal history can
go, English law has recognised damage to one’s reputation as a cause of
action. This was because reputation carries greater value than material
wealth. This justification was well expressed in these words in _**Otello Act
III Scene 3**_.

> Good name in man and woman,
>
> Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
>
> Who steals my purse steals trash; ’tis something, nothing;
>
> ’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
>
> But he that filches from me my good name
>
> Robs me of that which not enriches him,
>
> And makes me poor indeed.

It is on that moral fundament that the torts of libel and slander were
founded. Since, save in certain exceptional circumstances, no general damages
would be awarded in breach of contract cases, financial loss resulting from
damage to reputation must be proved in contract cases.

19\. Para 27-071 _**Chitty On Contracts**_ states the true principle that
"Damages for loss of reputation as such are not normally awarded for breach of
contract, since protection of reputation is the role of the tort of
defamation". See also _**Malik v Bank of Credit And Commerce International
SA**_ [1998] AC 20 where at page 40 Lord Nicholls said : "I agree that the
cause of action known to the law in respect of injury to reputation is the
tort of defamation."

__

The Malik case

__

20\. (i) However, that recent decision of _**Malik v Bank of Credit And
Commerce International SA**_ made a slight variation to the above rule. This
case made it possible to recover financial loss, that is special damages,
where breach of a contract damages one’s reputation which in turn causes
foreseeable _financial loss_ to the claimant. The claim is subject to the
established limiting principles of remoteness causation and mitigation.

(ii) The _**Malik**_ case arose out of a contract of employment and the
disastrous collapse of the infamous bank – Bank of Credit and Commerce
International SA ("BCCI") ("the bank"). Malik was the head of deposit accounts
and customer services at a branch office of the bank. When the bank was
ordered to be wound up he was dismissed by the provisional liquidators on the
ground of redundancy. He brought an action asserting that he had lost more
than his job. He said that by reason of the corrupt and/or dishonest manner in
which the bank operated and the consequential collapse of the bank he was at a
handicap on the labour market because he was stigmatised by reason of his
employment by the bank. He claimed £50,000 based on some "table of service".
His claim was based on an implied term in his contract of employment that "the
employer will not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a
manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of
confidence and trust between employer and employee." The liquidators rejected
the claim.

(iii) On appeal Evans-Lombe J refused to imply the term contended for. The
Judge found _**Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd**_ the principal stumbling block. On
appeal the Court of Appeal was prepared to imply a term to the effect that the
bank was under a duty not, without reasonable and proper cause, to conduct
itself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the
relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee.
Nevertheless, "stigma damage" as a head of compensation was not recoverable in
law. Once again _**Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd**_ provided the justification for
the decision. Malik appealed to the House of Lords. His appeal was allowed.
The House of Lords ruled that the bank had broken its implied obligation of
trust and confidence. Accordingly Malik was entitled to damages for the
financial loss suffered by him upon proof and to the extent that his future
employment prospects were prejudiced by the stigma of his employment with the
eggregious employer.

(iv) The _**Malik**_ case does not, however, affect the law relating to
general damages for breach of contract. It must at once be appreciated that
this was not a case of wrongful termination of employment. The breach there
related to an independent implied term. Next, it was not a claim for general
damages but special damages – that is to say financial loss. Despite
_**Malik**_ ’s case, the general rule remains that for breach of contract, the
compensation is for proven financial loss and not general damages

__

The Ruxley Electronics case

__

21\. It is now necessary to consider another House of Lords decision, namely,
_**Ruxley Electronics and Construction v Forsyth**_ [1996] AC 344. This case
gives effect to the ancient Greek wisdom : "Nothing too much". That saying was
transformed into a rule of law by the great American judge – Cardozo J. In the
leading case of _**Jacob & Youngs Inc v Kent**_ (1921) 129 N.E. 889 Cardozo J,
delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeals of New York,
held that the court will not award damages which would be grossly and unfairly
out of proportion to the good to be obtained. In the _**Ruxley Electronics**_
case, the defendant had contracted to build a swimming pool with a diving area
7 feet 6 inches deep. On completion the diving area was only 6 feet deep. The
owner claimed £21,500 being the estimated cost of rebuilding it to the
contractual dept of 7 feet 6 inches. The plaintiff had no intention of
reconstructing the pool to the contractual depth. Judge Diamond QC rejected
the claim of special damages and awarded general damages in the sum of £2,500
for loss of pleasurable amenity. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision.
The House of Lords restored the decision of Judge Diamond QC. The House of
Lords held that the plaintiff was entitled to something for loss of amenity.
The claim for the estimated cost of reinstatement in the circumstances of the
case was unreasonable.

__

The plaintiff’s arguments

__

22\. The present plaintiff pitched his case at a high level. It was postulated
to depend on the proposition that general damages would be awarded for mental
distress and its cognates arising from breach of contract if that was within
the contemplation of the parties. The plaintiff relied on _**Cox v Philips
Industries Ltd**_ [1976] 1 WLR 638 which first articulated the proposition in
1975.

23\. Another case relied on by the plaintiff was _**Tippett v International
Typographical Union**_ (1976) 71 DLR (3D) 146. In that case, it was held that
general damages within reasonable bounds were recoverable for loss of
reputation and mental distress arising from breach of contract. The case
applied the test of foreseeability. The court sidestepped _**Addis v
Gramophone Co Ltd**_ on the understanding that in that case the mental
distress was not foreseeable.

24\. The plaintiffs further cited **_Brown v Waterloo Regional Board of
Commissioners of Police_ **(1982) 136 DLR (3d) 49. The case stated, inter
alia, the following at p 56 :

> It is now clear that damages are recoverable for mental suffering flowing
> from a breach of contract if such damage is within the contemplation of the
> parties at the time they enter the contract. Normally, in ordinary
> commercial contract situations, it is not contemplated that mental suffering
> will result from a breach of contract; however, where the contract affects
> "personal, social and family interests", the likelihood of mental suffering
> in the event of a breach may be foreseen. There has been a dramatic
> breakthrough in the law in this area in recent years. The earlier law as set
> out in _Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd_ is being abandoned.

25\. In the above case, the Court relied on _**McGregor on Damages**_ 13th Ed
(1972) and the following proposition of Lord Denning MR in _**Cook v S**_
[1967] 1 All ER 299 at p 303 "I think that, just as in the law of tort, so
also in the law of contract, damages can be recovered for nervous shock or
anxiety state if it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence".

26\. Great reliance was placed by the plaintiff on a New Zealand case :
_**Whelan v Waitaii Meats Ltd**_ [1991] 2 NZLR 74. In that case the New
Zealand High Court awarded $50,000 as general damages in a wrongful dismissal
case. The principal reason the court gave for not following _**Addis v
Gramophone Co Ltd**_ was that the proposition that the law did not permit
general damages for breach of contract was no longer the law as the House of
Lords itself had departed from it in _**Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd**_
[1920] AC 102.

27\. After reviewing the relevant authorities, I concluded that the plaintiff
relied on outdated law based on outdated cases and books. _**Cox v Philips
Industries Ltd**_ was overruled by _**Bliss v South East Thames Regional
Health Authority**_ [1987] 1 C.R. 700. The 16th edition of _**McGregor On
Damages**_ has abandoned the purported changes in law stated in earlier
editions. By 1991, attempts to put an end to the conventional wisdom had died
a silent death. The law had turned a full circle. In 1991, in the case of
_**Watts v Morrow**_ [1991] 1 WLR 1421, Bingham L.J. lucidly put the point and
purpose of the correct rule at 1445 :

> A contract-breaker is not in general liable for any distress, frustration,
> anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension or aggravation which his breach of
> contract may cause to the innocent party. This rule is not, I think, founded
> on the assumption that such reactions are not foreseeable, which they surely
> are or may be, but on considerations of policy.
>
> But the rule is not absolute. Where the very object of a contract is to
> provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom from molestation,
> damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or if
> the contrary result is procured instead. If the law did not cater for this
> exceptional category of case it would be defective.

In _**Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong**_ [1999] 3 SLR 630, counsel for the
claimant declared with great fanatical force that it was a monstrous principle
and vowed to have it reversed on appeal. The case went on appeal. The
Singapore Court of Appeal, on the basis of _**Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd,**_ as
further amplified in _**Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd**_ [1973] 1 All ER 71 and
**_Malik_ **cases, held that general damages are not recoverable for mental
distress arising from breach of contract. See _**Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan
Yew**_ (Civil Appeal No 303 of 1998) [1999] 4 SLR 560.

____

Conclusion

28\. On the basis of the above discourse I have no alternative but to dismiss
the claim for substantial general damages. I award nominal damages of $1
against each defendant. In doing so I should make it clear that the
disallowance of the plaintiff’s extra relief for damages does not in any way
discount the exculpation he has been given with the agreement of his
opponents.

29\. Had the plaintiff been suspended from or deprived of his Club membership
I would have given general damages under the exception of loss of amenities.
In this case the plaintiff remained a member at all times.

Dated this 10th day of March 2000.
