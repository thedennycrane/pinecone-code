THE APPLICANTS AFFIDAVIT FILED ON 18 SEPTEMBER 2000

_

3 In the Applicants affidavit filed on 18 September 2000, he listed five
reasons for this application:

> (1) the primary reason was to get some form of final settlement to his
> financial problems which were taking a toll on his mind, his health and his
> career;
>
> (2) while he was presently unable to repay all his creditors in full, he
> believed that he would be able to repay a substantial amount with an initial
> lump sum payment of $4.4 million within six months of his proposal being
> accepted;
>
> (3) if the creditors commenced legal proceedings against him, the costs
> (which would mostly be on an indemnity basis) would add to his financial
> misery without helping the creditors in any way;
>
> (4) the general scheme of his proposal was to pay an initial lump sum
> payment of $4.4 million within the first six months and to repay at least
> 50% of his debts over 27 months, with a high probability of full repayment;
> and
>
> (5) rendering him a bankrupt would not help the creditors in recovering the
> money owed to them.

4 Various legal proceedings have been commenced against him and one creditor
(Coutts Bank) presented a Bankruptcy Petition against him in February 2000 and
which was to be heard on 22 September 2000.

5 The Applicant wished to have Mr Ho Wah Onn, a practising Advocate &
Solicitor, to be his nominee and trustee for the purposes of this application
and to carry into effect the scheme proposed. Mr Ho has been the solicitor for
the Applicant and his companies on previous occasions. On 12 September 2000,
the Applicant gave written notice of his proposal to Mr Ho which contained a
summary of the scheme of voluntary arrangements.

6 The Applicant then set out his personal history. He is 43 years of age,
married and has a daughter aged eight and a son aged six. He is a director of
Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd which was set up to market and to manage a resort
development project in Bintan, Indonesia.

7 He completed his A level examinations in Singapore in 1978 as a private
student while serving National Service. He then worked as flight steward until
October 1980 when he became a property agent. He was very successful as a
property agent until the 1983 recession. He then decided to enrol as a student
in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University of Singapore.

8 To support himself through university, the Applicant continued to deal in
property and bought into a hairdressing business. He also traded in seafood on
a fairly large scale. All this were too much a strain on him and he had to
apply for a years leave from his studies.

9 By 1988, his mainstay business was trading in properties. He also ventured
with MBf Holdings Bhd into the food business and set up a company. He has
since sold all his shares in that company to the other shareholders.

10 In July 1990, he married and then incorporated his family investment
company, Elle Holdings Pte Ltd. Elle performed very well from 1990 to 1995 and
even made an extraordinary gain of some $9 million in 1995 from the sale of
its investment properties.

11 In 1994, the Applicant ventured into the forestry business and incorporated
SINO P.N.G. Resources Pte Ltd. He still owns about 35% of the equity of SINO
which has a paid up capital of nearly $6 million.

12 Elle has a convertible loan of about $2.5 million due from SINO which, when
converted into equity, would cause Elle and the Applicant to own a combined
and controlling stake of 57% of SINO.

13 In August 1996, the forest assets of SINO (three large concessions in the
Republic of Congo) were valued at US$52 million. In his proposed scheme of
voluntary arrangements, it was stated that these concessions were held through
SINOs fully owned subsidiary which owned 80% of them. In 1995, Idris
Hydraulics Bhd, a public company listed on the main board of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange, made an offer to purchase 50% of the equity of SINO for US$40
million. That offer was rejected by the shareholders as the company was then
valued at US$120 million by Rothschild Ventures Asia. In the said proposed
scheme of voluntary arrangements, the Applicant stated that the Asian
financial crisis had caused SINO to suspend its operations since mid-1997.

14 In 1995, Elle re-entered the property market and purchased 26/A/B/C/D Ewart
Park, Singapore for about $11 million. After spending another $600,000 on
renovations, these properties generated about $300,000 of annual rental income
between 1996 to the middle of 1998.

15 In March 1996, Elle purchased 733 Mountbatten Road, Singapore. The property
was refinanced in July 1997 by Coutts Bank (Schweiz) AG, with a total drawdown
of $7.75 million. Elle also borrowed US$9 million from the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China ("ICBC") to finance the forestry business and to
renovate the Ewart Park properties.

16 The Applicants liabilities arose as a result of his personal guarantees
given to various banks for loans granted to Elle. Except for Coutts Bank, none
of the other banks had issued any demand for repayment and the Applicant was
working cordially with them to resolve his financial matters. The loan from
Coutts Bank was used to repay the previous mortgagee bank $5.8 million, to
repay ICBC $200,000, to repay a loan of $1 million to Galleries Development
Pte Ltd, to extend a friendly loan of $500,000 to the Grandlink Group Pte Ltd
and to set aside $200,000 to service the loan. The outstanding debt due to
Coutts Bank is $1.45 million.

17 Elle has sued Grandlink for $450,000 and obtained judgment against
Grandlink and its guarantor, Ricky Goh. Ricky Gohs bankruptcy, execution of
that judgment was delayed until late June 2000 when the bankruptcy order
against Ricky Goh was rescinded.

18 On 18 August 2000, Elle was ordered to be wound up on the petition of
Coutts Bank. Elle was appealing against that order and would proceed to
reinstate its claim against Coutts Bank for fraud and would seek substantial
damages arising from the banks action.

19 The proposed scheme of voluntary arrangement was necessitated by Coutts
Banks relentless pursuit to bankrupt the Applicant and put an end to any
further claims against the bank. Coutts Bank was still holding a parcel of
land of about 330,000 square feet in the prime Tanjung Langsat Industrial
Estate in Johor worth RM 2 million as security. When subdivision of that piece
of land was approved, its value could be easily enhanced to at least RM 8
million. As Coutts Bank could afford to sit and wait for the value of the land
to rise over time, it had little to lose in making the Applicant bankrupt to
the disadvantage of his other creditors. Coutts Bank would do everything to
prevent him from succeeding in the proposed scheme. As the matter was being
investigated by the police, the Applicant was unable to disclose further
information on it. The Applicant enclosed a letter dated 12 June 2000 from the
AGs Chambers informing him that his letter dated 2 June 2000 had been
forwarded to the police for investigations. The subject heading of that letter
was "Report against false Affidavit used in Court proceedings".

20 The Applicants proposed scheme of voluntary arrangements listed the
following as his assets:

> (1) a three-room HDB flat in Holland Close;
>
> (2) 1.3 million ordinary shares in Elle, said to be worth about $21.5
> million;
>
> (3) 2.15 million ordinary shares in SINO, said to be worth about $18.4
> million;
>
> (4) 150,000 ordinary shares of Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd;
>
> (5) 330,000 square feet of land in Tanjung Langsat, Johor, worth RM 2
> million;
>
> (6) Villa Puteri condominium worth RM 300,000, pledged to RHB Finance Bhd
> for about RM 300,000.

21 His liabilities to creditors amounted to some S$28 million and RM 300,000.
In addition, he owed his family and friends S$290,000.

22 The proposed scheme of voluntary arrangements dated 12 September 2000,
after describing Elle and SINO, continued as follows:

> "**MAPOR ISLAND RESORT PTE LTD ("MAPOR")**
>
> This name of this company was changed in 1994 to reflect the change in the
> principal activities of the company. The company has been awarded a project
> management and marketing contract to manage and market a large scale resort
> development project in Bintan, Indonesia. The principal terms of the
> contract are as follow:
>

>> 1\. Mapor will procure a project loan of not less than US$20 million. For
her role, Mapor will be paid a fee of 20% of the loan procured subject to a
maximum fee of US$8 million. The loan must be procured within a 12 month
period.

>>

>> 2\. Mapor will also manage the project. For her role, Mapor will be paid a
fee equivalent to 2% of the project cost. At a projected cost of approximately
S$150 million, Mapor will earn a gross fee of approximately S$3 million. The
net fee is expected to be about S$1.2 million. This fee is expected to be paid
over a 36 month period.

>>

>> 3\. Mapor will market the entire project and is expected to earn
approximately S$8 million in gross fees. The net fee receivable is expected to
be about S$4 million. The marketing of the project is scheduled to commence by
the first quarter of Year 2001.

>
> In total, Mapor will earn a net income of approximately US$4 million (S$6.8
> million) within 12 months and another S$5.2 million over another 36 months.
> This translates to an income of about S$450,000-00 every quarter.

> which anticipate a total fee of almost S$12 million within 36 months.
>
> Setting aside a budgeted sum of S$20,000-00 per month for business expenses,
> this will take up S$72,000-00 over a 36 month period. Personal expenses of
> S$5,000-00 or S$180,000-00 over 36 months will also be provided.
>
> **
>
> This will leave not more than S$11.1 million for distribution to the

>
> SCHEDULE OF PAYMENT
>
> **
>
> The following schedule of repayment is proposed:
>

>> 1\. All creditors listed in Annexure B owed less than S$50,000-00 to be
fully repaid within 6 months from the date of acceptance of the scheme of
voluntary arrangement by the creditors.

>>

>> 2\. All creditors listed in Annexure B owed more than S$50,000-00 with the
exception of the creditors listed under (10) to be repaid 50% of all monies
due to them. For the purpose of determining monies owing, the **outstanding
debt** shall be the gross amount owing as at 31 August 2000 less the market
value of any security pledged to the creditors.

>>

>> 3\. Further to Paragraph 2 above, a sum of not less than 25% of the

proportion to their share of the outstanding debt up to the full amount
outstanding as at 1 September 2000.

>>>

>>> ****

>
> **
>
> WHY THIS SCHEME WILL SUCCEED
>
> **
>
> The opportunity for Mapor to raise money using the assets of a third party
> gives the scheme a greater probability of success. The minimum amount of
> money to be raised does not exceed 20% of the current valuation of the
> property to be pledged for the loan. That same loan is also utilized to
> start the project. This will lead to the management and marketing contract
> to crystallize.
>
> There is sufficient assets in Sino, if properly managed or disposed off, to
> repay a substantial portion of the outstanding loan.
>
> The property market is in consolidation and improving at a very stable and
> steady rate. The approval of a sub-division of the land in Johor held by
> Coutts will realize at least RM 4 million. Leasehold land sold by the Johor
> Corporation in the same location is being sold for approximately RM 25 per
> square foot. The land in question is freehold in tenure and will support a
> minimum value of RM 8.25 million.
>
> The local and regional economies are growing very rapidly after recovering
> from the Asian financial crisis in 1999.
>
> A large portion of the outstanding loan was caused by foreign exchange loss
> and interest and further penalty interest accrued over the last 30 months.
>
> In supporting the scheme, creditors stand to be repaid at least 50% of the
> outstanding debt and a high probability of being repaid in full.
>
> The past 30 months were very unproductive with too much time spent in
> litigation and defending various legal actions brought about by both
> creditors and debtors alike. If the scheme is approved, I will be focused on
> raising money and looking for opportunities to fulfill my legal
> responsibilities."

THE INTERIM ORDER DATED 2 OCTOBER 2000

_

23 On 2 October 2000, the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court granted an
order in terms of prayers (1) and (2) of the application and made no order on
prayer (3). He granted an interim order up to 30 October 2000. The solicitor
for Coutts Bank who attended that hearing reported to the Court that the writ
action for fraud against the bank was dismissed.

_

ROBERT YOONGS AFFIDAVIT FILED ON 28 OCTOBER 2000

_

24 The solicitor for the Applicant, Mr Robert Yoong, filed an affidavit on
behalf of the Nominee, Mr Ho Wah Onn, as the latter was away on a business
trip. He reported that the Applicant and the Nominee had met several times
since the making of the interim order and that the Nominee found the proposed
scheme viable and had given instructions that a copy thereof be sent to all
creditors and that a meeting of the creditors be held on 15 November 2000. On
24 October 2000, a copy of the proposed scheme and a notice of meeting were
sent to the creditors.

_

THE ORDER OF COURT DATED 30 OCTOBER 2000

_

25 The Deputy Registrar extended the interim order to 6 November 2000 for the
Nominee to file his report.

_

__

THE NOMINEES AFFIDAVIT FILED 4 NOVEMBER 2000

_

26 The Nominee reported that he was satisfied that the proposed scheme merited
consideration subject to verification of the various assumptions that the
Applicant had stated. He also suggested that the Creditors nominate one or two
members from amongst themselves to consider the proposed scheme and to make
recommendations. He also asked that the interim order be extended for another
28 days.

_

THE ORDERS OF COURT DATED 6 NOVEMBER 2000 AND 20 NOVEMBER 2000

_

27 The Deputy Registrar extended the interim order by another two weeks to 20
November 2000.

28 On 20 November 2000, the Applicants solicitor applied for a weeks
adjournment to file the Nominees report on the meeting held on 15 November
2000. The Deputy Registrar extended the interim order by another week to 27
November 2000.

_

THE NOMINEES AFFIDAVIT FILED 28 NOVEMBER 2000

_

29 A copy of this affidavit was used at the hearing on 27 November 2000. The
Nominee reported that at the meeting held on 15 November 2000, he raised the
issue of a potential conflict of interests as his law firm had acted for the
Applicant in a number of matters. He had also informed the creditors that he
would file an affidavit setting out such matters and would not act as Nominee
should the creditors or he (the Nominee) take the view there might be a
potential conflict of interests.

30 The Nominee then went on to say that he was of the view that such a
conflict could arise but, in order to facilitate the proceedings, it was
decided at the meeting that the documents relating to Elle, SINO and Mapor
requested by the creditors would be produced by the Applicant by 27 November
2000 for their perusal before they consider the proposed scheme.

_

THE ORDER OF COURT DATED 27 NOVEMBER 2000

_

31 The Deputy Registrar discharged the Nominee and extended the interim order
to 4 December 2000 for another Nominee to be appointed.

_

THE APPLICANTS AFFIDAVIT FILED 2 DECEMBER 2000

_

32 The Applicant stated that it would be very difficult for him to appoint
another Nominee within a week as it took him more than eight weeks to appoint
Mr Ho Wah Onn. He had earlier sought the assistance of an accountant whom he
had known for more than ten years but who asked him "to place some money into
account for the work needed to be done" and he was unable to comply with that
request. Mr Ho Wah Onn later agreed to act as Nominee without any fee or
charge after studying the proposed scheme for more than two weeks.

33 Only two creditors solicitors had felt uncomfortable with Mr Ho acting as
Nominee and they had agreed to seek their clients instructions to retain Mr Ho
as Nominee but had not reverted to the Applicant. As Mr Hos expertise was in
financial restructuring and as it would be an uphill task for the Applicant to
convince a suitable person to be Nominee without some form of assured payment,
the Applicant pleaded that Mr Ho be retained as Nominee.

34 Alternatively, he asked for four weeks to search for a substitute and "to
search for some funds from family and friends to pay for these services". He
would furnish the documents requested by the creditors through his solicitors.

_

THE ORDERS OF COURT DATED 4 DECEMBER 2000 AND 8 JANUARY 2001

_

35 On 4 December 2000, the Court granted the Applicants solicitors request for
more time and extended the interim order to 8 January 2000.

36 On 8 January 2001, the Applicants solicitor requested another four weeks
and if the matter could not be resolved by then, he would leave it to the
Court to deal with the matter as it deemed fit, including the possibility of
discharging the interim order. The request was again granted and the interim
order was extended by another four weeks to 5 February 2001.

_

__

THE APPLICANTS AFFIDAVIT FILED ON 3 FEBRUARY 2001

_

37 Two days before the adjourned hearing, the Applicant filed an affidavit
stating that Ms Winifred Gomez, an Advocate and Solicitor, had consented to
act as Nominee and that she had undertaken to file an affidavit affirming her
consent within two weeks as she was then attending to her mother who had
suffered a stroke on 28 January 2001.

_

THE ORDER OF COURT DATED 5 FEBRUARY 2001

_

38 At the hearing on 5 February 2001, the solicitor holding a watching brief
for Coutts Bank attended and informed the Court that the bank was of the view
that the interim order should be discharged as it was more than three months
since the order was made on 2 October 2000 (indeed it was more than four
months).

39 The Deputy Registrar agreed and discharged the interim order as he felt
that the matter had been "outstanding without any positive result for a long
time". The Applicant appealed against this decision.

_

THE APPEAL

_

40 One day before the hearing of the appeal, the Applicant filed an affidavit
stating that Ms Winifred Gomez had agreed to act as Nominee on or about 15
January 2001 and he had intended to ask her to file an affidavit a week before
the expiry of the interim order on 5 February 2001\. Unfortunately, Ms
Winifred Gomezs mother became seriously ill from 29 January 2001 and Ms Gomez
was therefore unavailable for the entire week to attend to this matter.

41 He also informed the Court that Coutts Bank had written to the Court to
restore its bankruptcy petition against the Applicant and that the hearing was
scheduled for 23 February 2001. He then repeated his allegations as to why
Coutts Bank was bent on making him a bankrupt despite being a creditor for
only 5% of his total debts while ICBC, which was a creditor for about 85% of
his total debts, was willing to explore the proposed scheme.

42 Since November 2000, he had prepared the documents requested by the
creditors. He stated that the Loan Compensation Agreement and the Project
Management and Marketing Agreement in respect of Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd
"were obtained at great cost to me and only concluded after several months of
negotiation with the other party".

43 The Applicant also exhibited a list of prices of land published by the
Johor State Economic Development Corporation which showed that 60-year
leasehold land in the Tanjung Langsat Industrial Estate was offered at between
RM 15 to 17 per square foot. His enquiries revealed that 99-year leasehold
land was being offered at RM 27 to 30 per square foot. His freehold land in
that industrial estate would be worth RM 8.9 million at RM 27 per square foot.

44 Further, he had applied to the Johor Land Office for the full conversion
and subdivision of the said land and out of a total of ten departments
reporting to the Johor Land Office regarding his application, only two had not
replied. His consultants had advised him that the entire process would not
take more than six months. Once approved, the land could be readily sold or
refinanced for more than the S$1.45 million owing to Coutts Bank.

45 He had spoken to the Official Receivers office on 14 February 2001 and that
office indicated its support and consent to pursue Elles claim against its
judgment debtors. He wished to make it known to his creditors that there were
enough assets and sources of income to repay them if the proposed scheme was
properly executed.

46 He asked that the interim order be restored and that Thomas Tham Kok Leong,
an Advocate and Solicitor, be appointed Nominee. Mr Thomas Thams consent to so
act was enclosed.

47 At the hearing of the appeal on 21 February 2001, the solicitor for Coutts
Bank held a watching brief but was given permission to take part in the
proceedings. I was informed by the Applicants solicitor that the Applicant was
not able to pay the $10,000 or so requested by people he had approached to be
his Nominee. However, by virtue of the Mapor agreement in which he was the
broker, he would get 20% of whatever amount was successfully negotiated and
the loan he was brokering was US$50 million. I was also informed that "the
police case against Coutts Bank is still outstanding".

48 I was not persuaded that anything useful would come out of the extension of
the interim order and therefore dismissed the appeal against the Deputy
Registrars discharge of the interim order.

49 I agreed to hear further arguments upon the written request of the
Applicants solicitor.

50 On 29 March 2001, the same parties attended before me to present further
arguments. As "the bulk of the income will be derived from Mapor" apart from
the proposed sale of the forest concessions, (see the proposed scheme) and
since the Mapor Commercial Loan Fee/Compensation Agreement signed on 11
October 2000 was to expire after 180 days (i.e. on 10 April 2001), I decided
to see what the Applicant could come up with in respect of this agreement and
adjourned the hearing to 12 April 2001.

51 On 11 April 2001, the Applicant filed another affidavit to inform the Court
of the status of the various aspects of his proposed scheme, highlighting "the
key issues in evaluating the feasibility of the scheme". The affidavit stated:

> "**MAPUR ISLAND RESORT PROJECT**
>
> 4\. The viability for the entire project depends entirely on the ability of
> the developer and/or the project manager to raise the necessary project
> financing. This task as elaborated in my scheme filed on 18 September 2001
> (sic) has been assigned to Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd, a company
> beneficially owned by me.
>
> 5\. As at 28 October 2000, a Term Sheet outlining a funding proposal was
> received by Atlas Group Holdings Limited ("Atlas"), a company owned by one
> Chay Kok Kee, an ex-banker with Overseas Union Bank Limited acting on behalf
> of Mapor Island Resort Pte Ltd.

THE DECISION OF THE COURT

_

52 The Law and Practice of Bankruptcy in Singapore and Malaysia (1999) states
(at page 22):

> "Broadly, a voluntary arrangement is a statutory regime that facilitates and
> enables an insolvent debtor to enter into a binding arrangement with his
> creditors in respect of payment of the debtors debt. The regime was
> introduced in 1995 as part of Singapore law by the Act, and the governing
> positions can principally be found in Part V of the Act.
>
> The local regime is based mainly on the provisions contained in sections 252
> 263 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986, the provisions of which, in turn, were
> first introduced in the UK in 1985. In the circumstances, the English cases
> on the construction of the relevant provisions of the UK Insolvency Act 1986
> are helpful and persuasive."

53 Sections 46 and 48 of our Bankruptcy Act read:

> "46. (1) Every debtor making a proposal for the purpose of this Part shall
> in such proposal appoint a nominee to act in relation to the voluntary
> arrangement either as trustee or otherwise for the purpose of supervising
> its implementation.
>
> (2) No person shall be appointed as a nominee unless he is
>

>> (a) registered as a public accountant under the Accountants Act (Cap. 2A);

>>

>> (b) an advocate and solicitor; or

>>

>> (c) such other person as the Minister may, by order published in the
_Gazette_ , prescribe.

>
> (3) The Minister may make rules prescribing the scale of fees to be charged
> by nominees assisting debtors in respect of voluntary arrangements.
>
> 48\. (1) The court shall not make an interim order on an application under
> section 45 unless it is satisfied that
>

>> (a) the debtor intends to make a proposal for a voluntary arrangement;

>>

>> (b) no previous application for an interim order has been made by or in
respect of the debtor during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the
date of the application; and

>>

>> (c) the nominee appointed by the debtors proposal is qualified and willing
to act in relation to the proposal.

>
> (2) The court may make an interim order if it things that it would be
> appropriate to do so for the purpose of facilitating the consideration and
> implementation of the debtors proposal."

54 Rule 71 (1) of the Bankruptcy Rules provides:

> "71. (1) An application to the court for an interim order under Part V of
> the Act shall be by way of originating summons entitled "_In the Matter of
> Part V of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20)_ " and shall be accompanied by an
> affidavit stating
>

>> (a) the reasons for the making of the application;

>>

>> (b) particulars of any execution or other legal process which, to the
debtors knowledge, has been commenced against him;

>>

>> (c) that the debtor is able to petition for his own bankruptcy;

>>

>> (d) that no previous application for an interim order has been made by or
in respect of the debtor in the period of 12 months ending with the date of
the affidavit; and

>>

>> (e) the name of the person to be appointed as the nominee under the
proposal and that he is a person who is qualified and willing to act as a
nominee in relation to the proposal."

55 It can be seen from the above statutory provisions that the nominee
appointed must be "qualified and willing to act". It is incumbent on the
Applicant to procure such a Nominee. Willingness to act must of course be
coupled with the ability to do so. Nothing useful will be accomplished by
appointing a Nominee who is willing to act but will only be able to do so say
two months later for whatever reasons. It is just too bad if the Applicant is
not able to have a Nominee because no one wants to be one. It is certainly not
his creditors fault.

56 Secondly, the Court will make, and consequently should extend, an interim
order if it would be appropriate to do so for the purpose of facilitating the
consideration and implementation of the Applicants proposal. _Muir Hunter on
Personal Insolvency_ (1987), commenting on the English equivalent of our
Section 48, states (at pages 3018 and 3019):

> "The court must be satisfied of the seriousness and bona fides of the
> application, because of the far-reaching effect which its consequent order
> under section 254 may have, in staying proceedings by the debtors creditors.
>
> The terms "appropriate" and "inappropriate" occur several times in this
> Part, and also in Part IX, _post._ Little guidance is given as to the
> criteria of appropriateness which are to be applicable to the context. It
> may imply here that the proposal is more complicated than can be digested at
> the first hearing of the application, or that its terms are necessarily
> incomplete, and that time is needed to perfect them.
>
> In determining the "appropriateness" or otherwise of making an interim
> order, the court will consider whether the debtors proposal for voluntary
> arrangement to be put to his creditors is serious and viable. "If, in a
> particular case, the judge before whom the application for an interim order
> comes concludes that the proposal is not one which can be described as
> serious and viable, it would be expected that as a matter of discretion the
> judge would refuse to make an interim order. Judges must, I think, be
> careful not to allow applications for interim orders simply to become a
> means of postponing the making of bankruptcy orders, in circumstances where
> there is no apparent likelihood of benefit to the creditors from such a
> postponement": see _Hook v. Jewson Ltd_ [1997] 1 B.C.L.C. 664, Scott, V.-C,
> following _Re A Debtor (Cooper v. Fearnley) (1 of 1994)_ [1997] B.P.I.R. 20,
> Aldous J.
>
> Thus, in _Hook v. Jewson_ itself, the Vice-Chancellor upheld the district
> judges refusal to make an interim order to enable a proposal to be put to a
> meeting under section 257, which failed adequately to comply with the
> requirements of Rule 5.3, and which seemed unlikely (if approved) to
> generate any return for unsecured creditors.
>
> It is however not a good ground for refusing to make an interim order that
> the return to creditors will be small (though not derisory); it is for the
> creditors themselves to decide on its adequacy: see _Knowles v. Coutts &
> Co._ [1998] B.P.I.R. 96."

57 It was surprising that the Applicant, at the meeting with the creditors on
15 November 2000, did not have the necessary documents available to back up
his assertions in the proposed scheme. This fact alone would cast doubt on the
Applicants sincerity in his proposal.

58 When documents were exhibited in his subsequent affidavits, they appeared
on the face to be unsigned or spent documents. For instance, the "Loan
Proposal/Term Sheet" referred to in his last affidavit was unsigned, dated 27
October 2000 and was stated explicitly to expire on 1 November 2000. It should
also be noted that this document was not alluded to nor produced until the
eleventh hour. Further, third parties were introduced for the first time
without any concrete evidence of their involvement or participation in the
purported elaborate financial arrangement.

59 The "Commercial Loan Fee/Compensation Agreement" exhibited in the
Applicants affidavit filed on 20 February 2001 was apparently signed on 11
October 2000. On the face of that document, it expired after 180 days (or by
10 April 2001). At page 4 of the document, the "Broker understands and
appreciates that time is of the essence to the Borrower". All we have on
record was another bare assertion by the Applicant that the other party to the
agreement had agreed to extend the agreement by another 180 days and had
signified such consent on 6 April 2001 by endorsing on the Applicants letter
dated 30 March 2001. If that was true, surely the one-page signed document
could have been easily faxed over or even sent by courier from Riau, Indonesia
to Singapore.

60 Even if there was such an extension, the agreement was with Mapor Island
Resort Pte Ltd in which the Applicant was Managing Director. If his
involvement was so crucial and would be likely to produce results, he could
easily seek the Official Assignees permission (assuming he was made a
bankrupt) to carry on with his work in that respect. However, I was informed
by the Applicants solicitor at the final hearing that a third party (the Atlas
Group) was negotiating on the Applicants behalf "because the Applicant on his
own does not carry any weight".

61 In any event, the proposed resort project, which the developers intended to
commence in the second quarter of 2001 (see "Letter of Appointment" dated 15
December 2000 in the Applicants affidavit filed on 20 February 2001), did not
even appear to be at the starting line. This Letter of Appointment, which the
Applicant described as a Project Management and Marketing Agreement in his
affidavit, stated that it was "subject to final agreement to be executed
between us" and even the terms of payment for the Applicants companys services
"shall be negotiated at the agreement stage".

62 The documents in respect of the purported forestry concessions were old
ones going back to 1998, 1996 and 1995. Again, the Applicant has shown no
concrete evidence that he had a serious and viable venture in respect of these
purported concessions.

63 Similarly, for the property in Tanjung Langsat Industrial Estate, Johor,
the application to subdivide was taken out as long ago as January 1997, more
than four years back. No active step appeared to have been seriously taken
over the past several years. Even if the subdivision would enhance the value
of the land, there was no reason why the Official Assignee (again assuming the
Applicant was made a bankrupt) could not carry on the process.

64 The Ewart Park properties were owned by Elle and that company has been
wound up. These properties were mortgaged to ICBC to which the Applicant owed
some $23 million. It was not clear why the Applicant was including these
properties in his affidavit in this application for an interim order.

65 Looking at the proposed scheme in the light of all that has transpired, I
was of the view that it would not be appropriate to continue the interim
order. The proposed scheme appeared to be nothing more than the Applicants
earnest hopes that somehow, someday, something would happen to relieve him of
his financial woes. I was not persuaded that it was a serious and viable one
meriting the further extension of the interim order. I therefore affirmed the
Deputy Registrars decision discharging that order.
