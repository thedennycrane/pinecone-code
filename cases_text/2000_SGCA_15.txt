(delivering the judgment of the court): **_Introduction_**  
  
The appellant brought this appeal against the decision of Warren LH Khoo J who
dismissed the appellant`s application for a declaration and an injunction to
compel the respondents to refer a dispute between the appellant and his former
employers, Singapore Airlines Ltd (`Singapore Airlines`), concerning the
termination of the appellant`s employment, to the Industrial Arbitration Court
(`the IAC`).  
  
**_Background facts_**

****

The appellant had been an employee of Singapore Airlines from 1973 until he
was dismissed from the organisation in March 1997. Between 1989 to 1995, he
was seconded to the Singapore Airlines Staff Union (`the SIASU`). During that
time, he held various positions in the SIASU such as Assistant General
Secretary, Chairman of Marketing Division, Chairman of Disciplinary Committee
and Chairman of Sports Committee.  
  
Sometime in 1996, the appellant came under investigation by the Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau. As a result, he voluntarily resigned from his
posts in the SIASU but retained his ordinary membership.  
  
On 18 February 1997, the appellant was charged with offences in the
Subordinate Courts. The appellant was accused of obtaining bribes in the form
of loans from three union members who were facing disciplinary inquiries. As
he was unable to raise the bail amount of $20,000, the appellant was remanded
in Queenstown Remand Prison till his trial was heard. While in remand, the
appellant received a letter from Singapore Airlines dated 5 March 1997, the
relevant portion of which reads:

> _Dear Mr Clement,_

> _You have not reported for work since 21 February 1997 nor have you given
> the company any reason for your unauthorised absence. You have therefore
> broken your contract of service with the company and your employment is
> terminated with effect from 21 February 1997. Your last day of service was,
> therefore, 20 February 1997._

> _
>
> 2 Consequent on your termination, you will be paid your salary up to and
> including 20 February 1997.
>
> _

> _..._

  
  
The appellant was subsequently acquitted of the charges after his trial in
June 1997. He then sought reinstatement in Singapore Airlines by writing
letters to various people in Singapore Airlines throughout the months of June
and July 1997. On 31 July 1997, the appellant met representatives from
Singapore Airlines to discuss a compensation package in lieu of reinstatement.
Some members of the SIASU were also present at this meeting. However, no
agreement on the compensation package was reached between the parties and the
appellant subsequently took out DC Suit 4989/97 against Singapore Airlines in
November 1997 claiming damages for his alleged wrongful dismissal. However, in
May 1998, the appellant instructed his solicitors to discontinue this action
against Singapore Airlines.  
  
At around the time he discontinued his action against Singapore Airlines, the
appellant wrote two letters to the President and the General Secretary of the
SIASU requesting them to file an application on his behalf to the IAC under ss
35(1) and 82 of the Industrial Relations Act (Cap [shy ]136) (`the IRA`) to
adjudicate in the dispute between him and Singapore Airlines. He also said
that there were other grounds on which the matter could be brought before the
IAC. These included the fact that he had not been treated fairly and
impartially by Singapore Airlines; that he had been singled out and victimised
by Singapore Airlines; that Singapore Airlines was engaging in unfair labour
practices; that his termination was unfair, in breach of the terms of
employment and in violation of natural justice; that he was not accorded a
fair and impartial hearing on his alleged misconduct, and that his termination
was not in accordance with and was in breach of the express and implied terms
of the Collective Agreement between the SIASU and Singapore Airlines.  
  
There was no reply to the appellant`s first letter dated 26 May 1998. However,
on 1 September 1998, after the executive council of the SIASU had held a
meeting at which the matter was considered, the appellant received a response
to his second letter of 11 August 1998 in the following terms:

> _Re: Your application to IAC_

> _We refer to your letters dated 26 May 1998 and 11 August 1998 on the
> above._

> _The executive council in its meeting on 31 August 1998 had deliberated at
> length on your appeal to the union to file an application under s 35(1) of
> the Industrial Relations Act._

> _In order to support an application under s35(1) of the Industrial Relations
> Act the Union must be able to show that the termination of service is due to
> the reasons as stated in the Act._

> _Based on the facts and evidence given, to date, however there are no
> grounds in our view to support the application._

> _In view of this, we regret that we will not be able to accede to your
> request._

> _We wish you all the best in your endeavours._

> _By order of the Executive Council._

  
  
The appellant then applied to the court for a declaration and an injunction to
compel the SIASU to act pursuant to his request and refer the matter to the
IAC.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

The appellant claimed that the SIASU had an obligation to bring his case
before the IAC by virtue of art 3.2(iii) of the constitution of the SIASU. The
constitution was a contract which gave rise to contractual rights and
obligations between the SIASU and its members. In failing to accede to his
request, the SIASU had breached its obligations under the constitution.
Furthermore, the appellant said that the SIASU had acted in contravention of
the rules of natural justice as he was not given an opportunity to be heard
before the executive council of the SIASU made the decision. He felt that his
was a fit case for being brought before the IAC under ss 35(1) and 82 of the
IRA.  
  
As the judge was of the opinion that art 3 of the SIASU`s constitution only
sets out the generality of the objects and purposes of the union and did not
give rise to a contractual obligation between the SIASU and an individual
member which was enforceable by the compulsive powers of the court, he
rejected the appellant`s arguments that the executive council of the SIASU had
acted improperly in refusing to intercede with Singapore Airlines on the
appellant`s behalf. In any event, the wording of art 3 indicated that the
SIASU was given a discretion to decide whether to take up a member`s case with
his employer.  
  
The judge also held that the appellant had not shown how his case came within
the requirements provided by the IRA in order for the IAC to have jurisdiction
over the matter, commenting that the appellant`s case obviously did not fall
within any of the provisions of s 31. As far as ss 35 and 82 were concerned,
the appellant was caught by the limitation in s 35(1A) that the IAC could only
consider a dispute relating to the dismissal of an employee in circumstances
arising out of a contravention of s 82 by the employer. The situations in s 82
however, concerned dismissals of employees in connection with trade union
activities, which did not arise in the appellant`s case.  
  
The judge concluded that the appellant could not make out a prima facie case
that his case was one fit for referral to the IAC. The judge felt that there
was also no substance in the appellant`s claim that the SIASU had acted in
breach of the rules of natural justice in not giving him the opportunity to be
heard. The appellant had made the representations and the SIASU had considered
them. In the circumstances, this was all that was required of the SIASU. The
judge thus dismissed the appellant`s application with costs fixed at $500.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

The appellant appealed against the whole of the judge`s decision. The
appellant, who appeared in person, submitted firstly that there was a contract
between himself and the SIASU with its constitution forming the terms of the
contract and that the wording of art 3.2(iii) indicated that the SIASU had an
obligation to take up the member`s case with his employer at the request of
that member in every case; secondly, that the appellant`s case was a trade
dispute and industrial matter as defined in s 2 of the IRA, that a declaration
in the same terms should have been granted by the judge and that the
appellant`s case fell within the jurisdictional provisions of ss 31, 35(1) and
82 of the IRA; and finally, that the SIASU had acted in breach of the rules of
natural justice as they had never deliberated over the appellant`s case before
coming to their decision not to pursue the matter with Singapore Airlines.  
  
**_Effect of the constitution of the SIASU_**

****

The appellant`s first ground of appeal was that the SIASU is contractually
obliged to intercede with Singapore Airlines on his behalf. The appellant
submitted that the fact that he pays a certain amount of subscription each
month to the SIASU is an indication of the contractual relationship between
him and the SIASU, the terms of which were found in the constitution of the
SIASU. The article in the constitution of the SIASU relied on by the appellant
in support of his contention that the SIASU is obliged to represent him is
found in the section titled `Objects`. Article 3.2(iii) reads:

> _
>
> 3.2 The other objects of the Union shall be:
>
> _

> _..._

> _
>
> (iii) to represent the members before their employer and/or other persons
> whenever necessary or desirable in their interest;
>
> _

  
  
The appellant alleged that the words used in art 3.2(iii) along with the
normal practice of the SIASU of making representations on behalf of their
members impose on the SIASU the obligation to make such representations
whenever a member puts in a request. This is because the main reason for an
employee of a company joining a trade union is to ensure that his welfare is
looked after by the union whenever desirable and necessary in his best
interest, so that he is not discriminated against, victimised or unfairly
treated by his employer. Article 3.2(iii) thus does not give the SIASU a
discretion not to represent the appellant and they should have acted
accordingly when he put in his request.  
  
We are of the opinion that, while it may well be the case that a contract
exists between the SIASU and the appellant and that the rules of a trade union
form the terms of such contract between the parties, the judge was correct to
hold that art 3.2(iii) is not a term in the constitution capable of being
enforced by a court of law. Article 3 as a whole sets out the objects of the
SIASU, the principal one being to regulate relations between its members and
Singapore Airlines. The provision relied on by the appellant comes under the
other objects of the SIASU which include, inter alia, fostering a sense of
involvement and identity amongst employees of Singapore Airlines, co-operating
with Singapore Airlines in striving for the success of the company with a view
to benefiting the members through a fair and equitable sharing of the fruits
of such success and to promote the educational, cultural, vocational,
recreational, social and material interests and welfare of the members.  
  
The appellant argued that the article had to be read in the context of how a
member would interpret it and that the drafters of the provision did not
intend for discretion to be given to the relevant union officials in such
matters. He added that as the SIASU has had a practice of interceding with
Singapore Airlines in a number of cases involving the reinstatement of
employees whose services had been terminated for one reason or other, the
SIASU were thus bound to take up the matter for him and act pursuant to his
request that the SIASU file an application with the IAC to hear the dispute.  
  
We cannot agree with the appellant. In our judgment, art 3.2(iii) cannot be
read as being a mandatory order to the SIASU that they have to represent an
employee in every case that is brought to their attention. A reasonable
interpretation of the provision indicates that some discretion was built into
the provision by its drafters through the words `whenever necessary or
desirable in their interest`. Simply because there were some cases in the past
where the SIASU may have chosen to take an active role in seeking the
reinstatement of employees whose services had been terminated does not mean
that they are thus bound to do so in every case. The objects of the SIASU are
to protect the interests of its members and obviously in quite a number of
cases, the SIASU would have felt that it was appropriate to intercede with
Singapore Airlines on behalf of some of the employees. However, it is just as
likely that there were other cases where the SIASU did not feel that it was
necessary or desirable in the member`s interest to represent him before
Singapore Airlines. Saying that it is a practice or custom for the SIASU to do
so in some situations is insufficient to establish the appellant`s contention
that they are contractually obligated to represent him in this particular
case. The evidence of practice and custom is not adequate to establish the
existence of an implied rule that the SIASU is bound to intercede with
Singapore Airlines in all cases involving the termination of an employee`s
services. All that the SIASU is required to do is to consider the matter and
assess if it is an appropriate one in which it should intercede. That is the
entire scope of art 3.2(iii). As such, we do not think this ground of appeal
can succeed.  
  
**_Whether this case amounts to a trade dispute and meets the jurisdictional
requirements of the IRA_**

****

Section 31 of the IRA states that the IAC shall have cognizance of a trade
dispute under certain circumstances. In other words, the matter sought to be
brought before the IAC must first be described as a `trade dispute`. In s 2 of
the IRA, `trade dispute` is defined as `a dispute as to industrial matters`.
`Industrial matters` is likewise defined in s 2 as `matters pertaining to the
relations of employers and employees which are connected with the employment
or non-employment or the terms of employment, the transfer of employment or
the conditions of work of any person`.  
  
We are of the opinion that the appellant`s case is a trade dispute as defined
by the IRA. However, this does not mean that the appellant is entitled to a
declaration in those terms if that declaration serves no purpose. The
appellant is essentially asking this court to procure the SIASU to make an
application for his case to be heard before the IAC. Even though this matter
can be defined broadly as a trade dispute, the other jurisdictional provisions
have to be met before the IAC can have cognizance of the matter. A declaration
alone that the appellant`s case is a trade dispute is pointless unless the
other jurisdictional provisions in the IRA are shown to have been met.  
  
The IAC has cognizance of a trade dispute under the following circumstances
listed in s 31 of the IRA:

> _
>
> (a) all the trade unions and employers who are parties to a trade dispute
> jointly make a request in writing to the Registrar that the trade dispute be
> submitted to arbitration;
>
> (b) a trade union or an employer who are a party to a trade dispute makes a
> request in writing to the Registrar that pursuant to s 50(1) of the
> Employment Act (Cap 91) the trade dispute be submitted to arbitration;
>
> (c) a trade union which or an employer who is a party to a trade dispute as
> to any matter arising from or connected with a transfer of employment makes
> a request in writing, whether before or after the transfer of employment, to
> the Registrar that the trade dispute be submitted to arbitration;
>
> (d) the Minister by notice in a Gazette directs that the trade dispute be
> submitted to arbitration; or
>
> (e) the President of Singapore by proclamation declares that by reason of
> special circumstances it is essential in the public interest that a trade
> dispute be submitted to arbitration.
>
> _

  
  
More importantly, under s 35 of the IRA, the IAC may only consider a dispute
relating to the dismissal of an employee under certain circumstances. This
section in effect acts as a restriction on the IAC`s jurisdictional powers
under s 31. The relevant portions of s 35 read:

> _..._

> _
>
> (1A) A Court shall not consider a dispute relating to the dismissal of an
> employee or make an award relating to the reinstatement of an employee
> except in circumstances arising out of a contravention of section 82.
>
> (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1A), where an employee considers that he has
> been dismissed without just cause or excuse by his employer, in
> circumstances other than those arising out of a contravention of section 82,
> he may, within one month of such dismissal, make, through his trade union,
> representations in writing to the Minister to be reinstated in his former
> employment.
>
> _

  
  
Section 82 deals with situations concerning the injuring of an employee on
account of industrial action and reads:

> _
>
> (1) An employer shall not dismiss or threaten to dismiss an employee or
> injure or threaten to injure him in his employment or alter or threaten to
> alter his position to his prejudice, by reason of the circumstance that the
> employee
>
> (a) is, or proposes to become an officer or member of a trade union or an
> association that has applied to be registered as a trade union;
>
> (b) is entitled to the benefit of a collective agreement or an award;
>
> (c) has appeared or proposes to appear as a witness, or has given or
> proposes to give evidence, in any proceedings under this Act;
>
> (d) being a member of a trade union which is seeking to improve working
> conditions, is dissatisfied with such working conditions;
>
> (e) is a member of a trade union which has served notice under section 17 or
> which is a party to negotiations under this Act or to a trade dispute which
> has been notified to the Registrar in accordance with Part III;
>
> (f) has absented himself from work without leave for the purpose of carrying
> out his duties or exercising his rights as an officer of a trade union where
> he has applied for leave in accordance with section 81 before he absented
> himself and leave was unreasonably deferred or withheld; or
>
> (g) being a member of a panel appointed under section 6 has absented himself
> from work for the purpose of performing his functions and duties as a member
> of a Court and has notified the employer before he absented himself.
>
> _

  
  
The appellant argued that the judge should have declared the dispute between
him and Singapore Airlines to be a trade dispute falling under s 31 and then
directed the SIASU to refer the dispute to the IAC under s 31(d) of the IRA,
ie through a referral by the Minister. In response to the restrictions to the
IAC`s jurisdiction in cases involving the termination of employment imposed by
ss 35 and 82 of the IRA, the appellant submitted that his case does fall
within the circumstances listed in s 82 of the IRA. This is on the basis that
in his second affidavit, the appellant had listed certain grounds in support
of his claim that the dispute falls within the scope of s 82. He stated that:

> _
>
> a Under s 82(1)(a): I was a member of SIASU at the material time.
>
> b Under s 82(1)(b): I will be entitled to the benefit of the recently
> concluded Collective Agreement which is a court award under s 26 of the
> Industrial Relations Act.
>
> c Under s 82(1)(d): I was an official with the defendants (SIASU) seeking
> for better working conditions in the Marketing Division of SIA, namely,
> Passenger Relations Department, AULD Department, Cargo and Route Revenue
> Departments.
>
> d Under s 82(1)(e): I was an official with the defendants (SIASU) which
> served notice under s 17 (to invite the company SIA to negotiate for a new
> collective agreement) and was also a party with the defendants (SIASU) which
> is a party to the negotiations under this Act.
>
> _

  
  
The problem with the appellant`s submissions on this issue is the wording of s
82(1). This provision expressly states that the employer shall not dismiss or
threaten to dismiss the employee `by reason of` the circumstances listed in
sub-ss (a) to (g). The appellant was not dismissed from Singapore Airlines
because he was a member of the SIASU or that he was entitled to the benefit of
the Collective Agreement, his services were terminated because he was absent
from work without leave. This is clearly the case from the face of the
dismissal letter sent to the appellant by the Personnel Manager on 5 March
1997 as well as the actual events that took place. Crucially, the appellant
does not deny the fact that he was absent from work without authorisation as
stated in the dismissal letter. As for the other two reasons given by the
appellant that he was an official with the SIASU, this could not form any
alleged reason for his dismissal as he had resigned from these posts in 1996,
long before Singapore Airlines decided to terminate his services. Furthermore,
s 35(2) of the IRA, which is the only relevant section to the appellant`s
situation, cannot apply such that the appellant could ask the SIASU to make
representations to the Minister about his reinstatement, as the appellant only
sought reinstatement more than a month after he had been dismissed. The
appellant was caught by the time limit in s 35(2).  
  
We agree with the judge that the appellant has not been able to make out a
prima facie case that his case is one fit to be brought before the IAC. Thus,
there is no substantive basis on which any declaration ought to be granted
that the SIASU be ordered to refer the matter to the IAC by writing in to the
Minister for Manpower on behalf of the appellant and requesting that the
matter be brought before the IAC for arbitration under s 31(d) of the IRA.  
  
**_Alleged breaches of the rules of natural justice_**

****

The appellant`s final ground of appeal is that the SIASU never deliberated on
his request made in his two letters addressed to the president and the general
secretary of the SIASU in the manner that the SIASU claimed to have done in
its reply to the appellant. Furthermore, he alleged that the members of the
executive council of the SIASU who came to the decision not to pursue the
matter further were not aware which sections of the IRA applied to the
appellant`s case and thus acted unfairly, unreasonably, in bad faith, ultra
vires their powers and in a manner that no reasonable committee would have in
arriving at their decision. The appellant argued that it was not up to the
executive council to interpret the IRA as that involved a consideration of
questions of law. He also said that they had erred by taking into account
wrong facts in arriving at their decision and asked that their reply to the
appellant dated 1 September 1998 be declared null and void.  
  
The minutes of two meetings held by the executive council show the following
facts. The executive council of the SIASU first considered the matter in a
meeting on 31 August 1998 and decided to seek legal advice. It was presumably
after seeking legal advice that the executive council replied to the appellant
on 1 September 1998 informing him that based on the facts, there were no
grounds to support the application to the IAC. At a second meeting on 21
September 1998, this matter was discussed further and the general secretary
commented that he did not know under which section of the IRA the executive
council could refer the appellant`s case to the IAC as the appellant was no
longer an official of the trade union at the time of his dismissal. It was
also reiterated at this meeting that the SIASU could not find any prima facie
evidence that s 82 of the IRA had been contravened by Singapore Airlines.  
  
In our view, the appellant had no basis on which he could say that the SIASU
acted in breach of the rules of natural justice based on the facts related
above. The minutes of the meeting show that the executive council sufficiently
considered the matter, sought legal advice and correctly came to the
conclusion that the appellant`s case did not fall within the purview of the
IAC through the relevant provisions of the IRA. The dispute was not one in
which the IAC had jurisdiction to make an award. The appellant had obviously
placed a very strained interpretation on the comment of the general secretary
about not knowing which section of the IRA applied to the appellant`s case. A
realistic interpretation of this comment indicates the general secretary`s
view that the SIASU could not make an application to the IAC on the
appellant`s behalf because no section in the IRA applied to the appellant`s
case. The appellant`s argument that the executive council should not have
interpreted the IRA as it was an issue of law is also misconceived as they
would not have been able to come to a decision on whether it was appropriate
to apply to the IAC on the appellant`s behalf if they did not first consider
whether the appellant`s case fell within the jurisdictional provisions of the
IRA.  
  
As such, we do not think that the appellant`s claim that the SIASU had acted
in breach of the rules of natural justice in deciding not to make an
application to the IAC on his behalf can succeed. Accordingly, we agree with
the judge and hold that there should be no declaration that the SIASU`s reply
to the appellant is null and void.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

While we sympathise somewhat with the appellant`s position given the
circumstances under which he lost his job, we cannot find a legal basis on
which to make the declarations he applied for which compel the SIASU to make
arrangements such that his case may be brought before the IAC. If at all, the
proper party against whom the appellant should pursue his redress, if he feels
that he has been done wrong by, is Singapore Airlines. In the premises, we
dismiss the appeal with costs to be taxed. We make the usual consequential
order that the security deposit be released to the respondents or their
solicitors on account of costs  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
