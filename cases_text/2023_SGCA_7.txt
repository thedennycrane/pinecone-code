Introduction

1 Ms Tan Beng Hui Carolyn (“the Appellant”) appealed against the decision of a
judge of the General Division of the High Court (“the Judge”) in HC/OS
432/2021 (“OS 432”). Before the Judge, the Appellant sought to review and set
aside the decision of the Council of the Law Society (“the Council”) to impose
a penalty of $10,000 for her breaches of the Legal Profession (Professional
Conduct) Rules 2015 (“PCR”). The Judge dismissed her application, which was
made under s 95 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”),
finding that the penalty imposed was appropriate and justifiable.

2 We dismissed the appeal on 12 September 2022. We now set out our reasons for
dismissing the appeal, which mainly turned on a preliminary issue before us.
The appeal was made to the Court of Appeal and the preliminary issue, which
was one of jurisdiction, was whether the Appellant ought to have brought her
appeal to the Appellate Division of the High Court instead of to the Court of
Appeal. The Appellant maintained that her appeal arose from a case relating to
administrative law, such that the appeal to the Court of Appeal was correct,
based on para 1(a) of the Sixth Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature
Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”). The Respondent, the Law Society of Singapore,
disagreed; it argued that the appeal should have been made to the Appellate
Division since the appeal was simply against the order of the Judge dismissing
the Appellant’s application made under s 95 of the LPA. We held that the
appeal ought to have been made to the Appellate Division. Aside from the
jurisdictional point, the appeal was also plainly unmeritorious. We elaborate
on this view later in these grounds.

Background of events leading to the decision of the Council to impose a
penalty

3 The Appellant is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of
Singapore. Whilst acting as an advocate and solicitor in a matter before the
General Division of the High Court in HC/OS 1100/2017 (“OS 1100”) in September
2018, the Appellant made several allegations against the lawyers for the other
parties, as well as against the judge, Dedar Singh Gill JC (as he then was)
(“Gill JC”). Unsurprisingly, complaints were duly made against the Appellant
and that led to an investigation by the Respondent.

4 By OS 1100, the Appellant’s law practice, Tan & Au LLP, had commenced an
interpleader action in respect of moneys held by Tan & Au LLP as stakeholder
against seven respondents who had claimed an interest in the moneys. Tan & Au
LLP was both the applicant (the “Applicant”) and the solicitors on record for
the Applicant in the interpleader action. The 1st, 4th and 5th respondents in
OS 1100 were represented by Central Chambers Law Corporation (“CCLC”). The
2nd, 3rd and 6th respondents in OS 1100 were represented by Yeo-Leong & Peh
LLC (“YLP”) (now known as Adsan Law LLC). The complaints lodged against the
Appellant were by the solicitors of both CCLC and YLP. In these grounds of
decision, we refer to the six solicitors as the Complainants.

5 The allegations against Gill JC were made during the hearing of OS 1100 in
September 2018. On 13 September 2018, after the cross-examination was
completed, the Complainants brought to Gill JC’s attention, in chambers, that
Tan & Au LLP had included in their Bundle of Documents a document that was not
in evidence. Gill JC directed that the new document was not to be admitted.
Shortly thereafter, Tan & Au LLP filed a recusal application against Gill JC.
In support of the recusal application, the Appellant filed a supporting
affidavit the following day (the “Recusal Affidavit”), where she made certain
allegations against Gill JC as well as some of the Complainants. The
allegations formed the subject matter of the complaints against her.

6 On 17 September 2018, Tan & Au LLP filed their Bundle of Documents, which
still contained the new evidence on page 98 (which was subsequently ordered to
be struck out by the court) (“Page 98”). Notably, CCLC also invited Tan & Au
LLP to expunge portions of the Recusal Affidavit; this was on the basis that
those portions contained allegations against other solicitors, made without
giving the other solicitors an opportunity to respond. Tan & Au LLP declined
to remove the impugned portions. CCLC then applied to court to strike out
these paragraphs (the “First Striking Out Application”). The solicitors from
YLP also sought to expunge Page 98, as Gill JC had directed its exclusion. The
Appellant declined to remove the impugned portions of the Recusal Affidavit.
She responded by e-mail on 20 September 2018 (the “20 September 2018 E-mail”)
to one Mr David Kong (“Mr Kong”), who was a solicitor of YLP. In the 20
September 2018 E-mail, the Appellant claimed that she had left several
messages for Mr Kong, and her calls had not been returned. Additionally, she
accused YLP of suppressing the truth from their clients, and at the same time,
informed them that Tan & Au LLP would be filing the Amended Bundle of
Documents. We set out an extract of the 20 September 2018 E-mail:

7 After the 20 September 2018 E-mail was sent, Mr Kong filed an affidavit to
refute the allegation, stating that he did not receive any calls from the
Appellant. YLP also took out a separate application to remove Page 98 of the
Bundle of Documents (the “Second Striking Out Application”). On 25 September
2018, the Striking Out Applications and the Recusal Application were heard.
Both Striking Out Applications were allowed, while the Recusal Application was
dismissed. After the hearing, Tan & Au LLP requested further arguments on 28
September 2018 (the “Request for Further Arguments”), wherein another
allegation against Mr Kong was made. The Appellant alleged that Mr Kong had
lied on oath and committed perjury when he said on affidavit that he did not
receive any calls from the Appellant, as the Appellant had indeed made several
phone calls to him and left several messages. The Appellant also lodged a
police report on 27 September 2018, essentially repeating the same allegation
that Mr Kong had committed perjury by stating in his affidavit that he had not
received any of the calls referred to in the Appellant’s 20 September 2018
E-mail (the “Police Report”). Annexed to the Police Report were screenshots
from a call log and a chat log showing that there were calls and messages sent
on 13 September 2018.

8 Gill JC declined the Appellant’s Request for Further Arguments on 10 October
2018. Crucially, Gill JC agreed that in Mr Kong’s affidavit, he was clearly
referring to the fact that no calls had been made on 20 September 2018, and
not that none had been made on 13 September 2018. This was in response to the
allegation in the Appellant’s 20 September 2018 E-mail that Mr Kong “had
failed to return [their] call”. Likewise, Mr Kong’s affidavit was also
referring to the messages supposedly left on 20 September 2018. When
questioned by Gill JC, the Appellant confirmed that she did not make any calls
on 20 September 2018.

9 On 12 October 2018, Tan & Au LLP filed the Applicant’s Closing Submissions
in OS 1100, repeating the same allegations that had been raised in support of
the Request for Further Arguments (see [7] above). Again, YLP and CCLC invited
Tan & Au LLP to expunge the allegations in the Applicant’s Closing
Submissions. Again, Tan & Au LLP declined and YLP and CCLC obtained Gill JC’s
order for these paragraphs to be struck out.

10 As alluded to at [3] above, the Complainants lodged 13 complaints with the
Respondent on 26 October 2018. The allegations were made against the Appellant
and her husband, another solicitor, Mr Au Thye Chuen (“Mr Au”). Both are
partners with Tan & Au LLP. The complaints were numerous, and the Inquiry
Committee (see [11] below) considered there to be six categories of complaints
dealing with various breaches of the PCR. Four of the categories pertained to
the following complaints:

(a) Category 1 complaints: these related to the Appellant’s allegations that
Mr Kong had committed perjury by lying on oath that he had not received any
calls or messages from the Appellant. The Complainants claimed that these were
false allegations, and the Appellant was as such in breach of rr 7(1) and 7(2)
of the PCR.

(b) Category 3 complaints: these complaints related to the Appellant’s and Mr
Au’s conduct in filing Page 98 in the Applicant’s Bundle of Documents in
breach of the court’s previous directions, and in reproducing in the
Applicant’s Closing Submissions a paragraph which had been expunged for
quoting Page 98. These were allegedly a breach of r 13 of the PCR.

(c) Category 4 complaints: the Appellant and Mr Au allegedly breached r 13 of
the PCR as they did not treat the court with respect in making false and grave
allegations against Gill JC in the Recusal Affidavit and in the Applicant’s
Closing Submissions.

(d) Category 6 complaints: the Appellant and Mr Au allegedly failed to provide
other solicitors with the opportunity to respond to the allegations made
against them in the Request for Further Arguments and in the Applicant’s
Closing Submissions, which breached r 29 of the PCR.

11 An Inquiry Committee (“IC”) was convened. The IC issued a report on 30 July
2019 (the “IC Report”) following a hearing held on 17 July 2019. The IC’s
findings were as follows:

(a) Category 1 complaints: the IC noted that the complaints were that the
allegations of perjury were false. However, for the purpose of determining
whether there was a breach of r 7 of the PCR, which is that it is not proper
for a lawyer to make allegations about another lawyer, it was not relevant
whether the allegations were true or not. Although the Appellant did not make
the allegations maliciously, and did not knowingly make a false statement that
she had left messages for Mr Kong on 20 September 2018 (when she likely had
those from 13 September 2018 in mind), it remained the case that the Appellant
had repeatedly made serious allegations against various parties, particularly
Mr Kong, in less than courteous language. The IC was of the view that there
was no cause of sufficient gravity for the matter to be referred to a
Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”), but the Appellant should be ordered to pay a
penalty as she had acted in breach of rr 7(1) and 7(2) of the PCR.

(b) Category 3 complaints: the IC accepted that the filing of the Applicant’s
Bundle of Documents with Page 98 included may have been due to an error, and
that there was no intention to breach Gill JC’s direction knowingly and
deliberately. However, this did not explain why the Applicant’s Closing
Submissions reproduced a paragraph that had earlier been expunged for quoting
Page 98. It remained the case that the Appellant had repeatedly acted in
breach of the court’s directions and orders to expunge Page 98. The IC
therefore recommended a formal investigation by a DT against the Appellant and
Mr Au on a charge of breaching r 13 of the PCR.

(c) Category 4 complaints: the IC considered that it was not within its
purview to comment on whether the allegations made against Gill JC were false.
Further, the making of allegations against Gill JC did not, in itself, amount
to a breach of the PCR, as it was inevitable that allegations of bias would be
made in recusal applications. Nevertheless, it considered that allegations of
bias on the part of a judge are grave and should not be made without clear
justification. The IC recommended a formal investigation by a DT against the
Appellant and Mr Au on a charge of breaching r 13 of the PCR.

(d) Category 6 complaints: the IC noted that the Appellant and Mr Au’s
acknowledgement that they had not given the Complainants the opportunity to
respond to the allegations made against them in the Request for Further
Arguments and the Applicant’s Closing Submissions. The IC referred a charge to
a DT for a breach of r 29 of the PCR in respect of the allegations made
against Mr Kong in their Request for Further Arguments and in the Applicant’s
Closing Submissions.

12 Following the issuance of the IC Report, the Respondent sent a letter to
the Appellant on 18 November 2019 (the “18 November 2019 Letter”) with the IC
Report enclosed, and informed the Appellant that the Respondent had adopted
the IC’s findings and determinations. In respect of the Category 1 complaints
in particular, the Respondent stated that it had considered the IC Report and
determined that no formal investigation by a DT was necessary, but that the
Appellant should be given a warning, a reprimand or be ordered to pay a
penalty of not more than $10,000. The Appellant was asked if she wished to be
heard before the Council made its decision.

13 A DT was appointed to address the charges referred to it against the
Appellant according to the Council’s recommendations. As for Mr Au, the DT
found that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether he was present at the
hearing in chambers on 13 September 2018. There was also no direct evidence
that he was involved in drafting the relevant documents where the allegations
were raised. The charges against him were therefore dismissed.

14 The first charge (the “First Charge”) the DT found the Appellant to be
guilty of was with respect to the disrespectful remarks made against Gill JC
that formed the subject of the Category 4 complaints. The Appellant therefore
breached r 13(2) of the PCR which is the duty to be respectful of a court.
This charge was made out, save for one statement stated in the charge. This
matter, however, is not the subject of the Appellant’s appeal.

15 The second charge concerned the allegations made against Mr Kong and other
solicitors, as stated in Tan & Au LLP’s Request for Further Arguments and the
Applicant’s Closing Submissions. These relate to the Category 6 complaints.
The Appellant sought to challenge this on appeal. The second charge (the
“Second Charge”) read as follows:

That you, [the Appellant], are charged that you are guilty of a breach of Rule
29 of the [PCR], in that, you, permitted documents to be filed on behalf of
your client Tan & Au LLP in [OS 1100] containing the following allegations
against other legal practitioners, in particular:

(1) On or about 28 September 2018, you permitted a letter from the Applicant
to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Singapore to be filed [ie, the
Request for Further Arguments] which contains the following allegation against
David Kong Tai Wai:-

Mr David Kong had lied on oath that [the Appellant] did not call him. He has
committed perjury and/or false statements under oath …

(2) On or about 12 October 2018, you permitted Closing Submissions to be filed
which contains allegations against Chooi Yue Wai Kenny, David Kong Tai Wai,
Fong Kai Tong Kelvin and Twang Kern Zem, that: -

… When Counsel for the Applicant asked whether there were other messages,
Counsel for the 2nd, 3rd and 6th Respondents [ie, Mr Chooi, Mr Kong and Mr
Fong] had kept silent and the silence is telling. In an inexplicable move, the
Judge accepted an evidence [sic] from the Bar of Mr Twang Kern Zern, counsel
of 1st, 4th and 5th Respondents relating to his testimony that he received a
message from the Interpleader although the Interpleader Counsel had disputed
the content as the Interpleader only communicated with the Counsel’s clerical
staff.

without allowing the said other legal practitioners the opportunity to respond
to the said allegations, and by doing so, you have been guilty of improper
conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s
83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).

16 For the Second Charge, the Respondent contended before the DT that the
phrase “silence is telling” in the Applicant’s Closing Submissions meant that
the Complainants, particularly Mr Chooi, Mr Kong and Mr Fong, had something to
hide. The DT was unable to accept the Respondent’s view. While it reflected a
regrettable choice of phrase, the point made was more an observation about the
proceedings than an allegation against other solicitors. But with respect to
the allegation made against Mr Kong in the Request for Further Arguments, the
DT was of the view that there could be no doubt that the Appellant had alleged
that Mr Kong had lied on oath. It was no answer to the charge that Mr Kong had
the opportunity in his affidavit of 21 September 2018 to respond to the
allegation. Although Mr Kong responded to the Appellant’s 20 September 2018
E-mail through his affidavit, the Request for Further Arguments filed by the
Appellant continued to assert that Mr Kong’s response was false, and that Mr
Kong was lying on oath. Hence, the Second Charge was made out in so far as the
Appellant’s allegation against Mr Kong in the Request for Further Arguments
was concerned. Accordingly, the DT found that there was a breach of r 29 of
the PCR, which states that a legal practitioner must not permit an allegation
to be made against another legal practitioner in any document filed on behalf
of the first legal practitioner’s client in any court proceedings, without the
other practitioner being given the opportunity to respond to the allegation.
We pause here to mention that Mr Kong unexpectedly passed on sometime in
February 2019.

17 For completeness, we add that the charge relating to the Category 3
complaints was dismissed by the DT.

18 Following the DT’s report, the Council accepted the DT’s findings, and,
after hearing the Appellant, determined that a penalty of $10,000 should be
imposed on the Appellant for breaching rr 7(1) and 7(2) of the PCR for the
allegations against Mr Kong (ie, the subject of the Category 1 complaints), r
13(2) of the PCR for making disrespectful statements to the court (ie, the
subject of the Category 4 complaints and the First Charge), and r 29 of the
PCR for failing to give Mr Kong an opportunity to respond to the allegations
(ie, the subject of the Category 6 complaints and the Second Charge). The
Council’s decision was communicated to the Appellant in a letter dated 8 April
2021 (the “8 April 2021 Letter”). Prior to the Council’s determination, the
Appellant was given the chance to respond and did submit two written
mitigation statements dated 9 November 2020 and 3 March 2021, as well as an
oral mitigation before the Council on 25 March 2021.

19 By way of OS 432, the Appellant applied under s 95 of the LPA to have the
court review and set aside the decision of the Council to impose a global
penalty of $10,000, as conveyed to the Appellant in the 8 April 2021 Letter.

Decision below

20 The Judge dismissed the Appellant’s application in OS 432 to review and set
aside the penalty imposed by the Respondent. Before the Judge, the Appellant
initially confirmed that her case was restricted to a determination as to the
merits on the question of what the appropriate penalty to be imposed on the
Appellant should be. Much later in the proceedings, the Appellant changed her
approach and broadened the challenge to setting aside the Council’s
determination on the breaches (see [23] below).

21 The Judge observed that the scope of the application under s 95 of the LPA
was confined to a review of the appropriate penalty. OS 432 was not a
challenge of the Council’s determination on the existence of sufficient cause
for formal investigation as it was not brought under s 96 of the LPA, nor was
it a substantive review of the DT’s findings and decision as it was not
brought under s 97 of the LPA.

22 As for the penalty imposed, there were three distinct breaches of rr 7, 13
and 29 of the PCR. These were not trifling breaches, as they arose from
separate acts impacting different interests. The penalty imposed was in
accordance with the relevant sentencing precedents and was justified by the
relevant aggravating factors. The Appellant was a senior lawyer, and her
conduct in the proceedings evidenced a lack of remorse. Her mitigation
statements before the DT dated 9 November 2020 and 3 March 2021 still
contained discourteous comments which reflected her lack of contrition. Hence,
the Judge saw no reason to disturb the penalty imposed.

23 During the hearing, the Judge also observed that the Respondent’s 8 April
2021 Letter did not accurately capture the nature of the Appellant’s breach of
r 7 of the PCR (the Category 1 complaints which were not referred to the DT).
The breach was with respect to her making allegations against Mr Kong; it was
not for the making of “false allegations” as the 8 April 2021 Letter seemed to
suggest. The Respondent subsequently issued a letter dated 7 February 2022 to
rectify its earlier letter (the “Clarification Letter”). The Appellant filed
further submissions to respond to the Clarification Letter. In her further
submissions, she enlarged the scope of her arguments to seek a review of the
Council’s determination on the breach of r 7 of the PCR. She argued that the
Council had conflated her allegation of criminal conduct (ie, perjury
committed by Mr Kong) with an allegation of professional misconduct against Mr
Kong. As the Judge saw it, there was no basis for the Appellant to seek such a
review. In any event, there was no conflation to speak of and the Judge
rejected the submission as being without merit. The Judge held that the
Appellant’s breach of r 7 was not due to her filing of a police report but
because of her repeated allegations against Mr Kong in the 20 September 2018
E-mail, the Request for Further Arguments and the Applicant’s Closing
Submissions.

The court to which the appeal should have been made

24 We turn to address the two issues before us, starting with the preliminary
question of which court this appeal ought to have been made to.

25 The Appellant maintained that this appeal was before the correct court. The
appeal related to administrative law because she was seeking a review of the
administrative action undertaken by the Respondent. She relied on Iskandar bin
Rahmat v Law Society of Singapore [2021] 1 SLR 874 (“Iskandar”) for the
proposition that the disciplinary jurisdiction exercised by a Judge under ss
95, 96 and 97 of the LPA is part of the civil jurisdiction of the court and
can form the subject matter of an appeal to the Court of Appeal. Further,
there is a very strong public interest in ensuring that allegations of
misconduct are fully ventilated before the Court of Three Judges.

26 In contrast, the Respondent argued that the present case did not fall
within any of the categories set out in the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA, and
accordingly the appeal should not have been made to the Court of Appeal. In
any event, the Judge did not err in finding that the court’s determination
under s 95 was confined to determining what the appropriate penalty should be,
and the Appellant could not rely on s 95 of the LPA to request the court to
review the merits of the substantive decision of the IC or the DT. On the
issue of the correct appellate court to hear the present appeal, OS 432 was
commenced by the Appellant pursuant to s 95 of the LPA for the court to review
the penalty ordered by the Council. The court’s role was limited to affirming,
varying, or setting aside the penalty that had been imposed. The review under
s 95 was based on a statutory right to review which was separate and distinct
from the Appellant commencing judicial review proceedings in respect of the
Respondent’s actions. Notably, OS 432 was not filed under O 53 r 1 of the
Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”), which requires a
party to obtain leave to commence judicial review proceedings. The Judge did
not have to consider any legal issues relating to administrative law or apply
any judicial review principles to the present case. Hence, the correct court
to hear the appeal should be the Appellate Division.

27 We were unable to agree with the Appellant that her appeal fell within para
1(a) of the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA, as OS 432 was not a case relating to
administrative law.

28 Sections 29C(1) and 29C(2) of the SCJA provide that an appeal against a
decision of the General Division in the exercise of its original or appellate
civil jurisdiction is to be made to the Appellate Division and not to the
Court of Appeal, unless the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA or any other written
law provides otherwise. Paragraph 1(a) of the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA
provides that where an appeal “arises from a case relating to constitutional
or administrative law (even if the appeal does not raise any issue relating to
constitutional or administrative law)” it should be made to the Court of
Appeal. In Dongah Geological Engineering Co Ltd v Jungwoo E&C Pte Ltd [2022] 1
SLR 1134 (“Dongah”) at [11]–[16], the court held that a review of an
adjudication determination by an adjudication panel constituted under the
Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed)
(the “SOPA”) would not constitute an administrative review or, in turn, a case
relating to administrative law. A review of a SOPA adjudication determination
is unrelated to the regulation of the exercise of public powers by public
authorities (Dongah at [15]). Although the principles applied in such a review
may possibly be similar or akin to those typically applied in administrative
law, ultimately something more is required to engage paragraph 1(a) of the
Sixth Schedule (Dongah at [15]).

29 The Appellant sought to distinguish Dongah from the present case, on the
basis that Dongah concerned an adjudicator holding parties to their private
law contractual obligations, whereas the present case concerned “wider public
considerations” relating to the right of Law Society members to make
allegations of criminal misconduct by other members. We did not have to decide
whether this was an appropriate way to delineate when a case relates to
administrative law. This is because, as we explain from [36] below, this case
was not about any purported right to make allegations of criminal conduct to
begin with.

30 In its further submissions, the Respondent referred us to the case of Seow
Fook Sen Aloysius v Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP [2022] SGCA 40 (“Seow
Aloysius”). At [13], the court held that a case that engages paragraphs 1(a)
to 1(e) of the Sixth Schedule is one where, at the least, there is “some
reasonable relationship … between the specified subject matter and the ‘case’
from which the appeal arises, whether with regard to the legal issues therein
or the application of the law to its facts, in the court below, so that either
or both of which may arise for consideration in the appeal” [emphasis in
original]. The Appellant did not address Seow Aloysius in its written or oral
submissions, and we consider it unnecessary to comment further on the
decision. As alluded to above, this present case simply did not give rise to
any administrative law issues.

31 The Appellant’s reliance on Iskandar was also misplaced. In Iskandar, the
issue before the court was whether there was a right of appeal against
decisions made under Part VII of the LPA, and the court concluded that there
is a right of appeal based on the disciplinary jurisdiction exercised by a
Judge under ss 95, 96 and 97 of the LPA:

86 … It is evident to us that proceedings under s 96 are not akin to
suspension or disbarment proceedings because the Judge is statutorily
empowered to review the Council’s determination but not to investigate the
solicitor’s conduct or impose penalties herself (see [22(b)] and [30] above).
In the context of an appeal brought against such a decision, the Court of
Appeal would only be concerned with the question of whether the High Court
Judge’s decision is correct. A court hearing such an appeal against a decision
made under s 96 would not be in a position to exercise the same powers as the
Disciplinary Tribunal or the C3J. It may disagree with the Judge, if it finds
it appropriate, and affirm the Council’s decision or direct the Law Society to
apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal, but
it cannot itself dispose of the matter. To the extent that disbarment or
suspension proceedings are sui generis, the proceedings before the High Court
and the Court of Appeal do not encroach on the jurisdiction of the C3J.

87 For those reasons, we consider that the disciplinary jurisdiction exercised
by a Judge under ss 95, 96 and 97 of the LPA is part of the civil jurisdiction
and can form the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal.

[emphasis added in bold italics]

32 Clearly, the reference to the Court of Appeal in that case (at [87]) was in
relation to the existence of a right of appeal where the underlying matter is
a review of the disciplinary tribunal’s decision by a High Court Judge. The
court in Iskandar was not addressing the issue of the correct appellate court
that should hear the appeal. Moreover, Iskandar was heard on 22 October 2020.
This was before the creation of the new Appellate Division of the High Court
which came into existence in January 2021. The issue of whether the Court of
Appeal was the correct forum vis-à-vis the Appellate Division did not arise
for the court’s determination. The Appellant’s reliance on Iskandar was taken
out of context.

33 Turning to the present case, OS 432 was an application made pursuant to s
95 of the LPA. It was not commenced by way of a judicial review for which the
Appellant would have needed to obtain leave as per O 53 r 1 of the ROC 2014.
The reliefs sought by the Appellant in OS 432 were to review and set aside the
decision of the Council, which were not the reliefs provided by judicial
review (ie, mandatory order, prohibiting order, and quashing order).

34 We also noted that the grounds of the Appellant’s application in OS 432
pertained to the merits of the Council’s determination, rather than the
legality of it. In her view, Mr Kong did commit perjury. According to her the
Council “reversed the Burden of Proof” in finding that the Appellant had made
a false allegation against Mr Kong. Her assertions do not relate to the
legality of the Council’s determination and do not give rise to administrative
law issues.

35 Moreover, the Appellant also sought to challenge the appropriateness of the
penalty. This would evidently entail a substantive review of the merits of the
Council’s determination, as the court could potentially substitute the penalty
imposed. The basis of this penalty review is statutory and not found in
administrative law judicial review powers, and the inquiry also differs from
that in judicial review.

36 Before us, the Appellant raised several contentions, including the
contention that the Council acted ultra vires and/or outside of its
jurisdiction by disciplining the Appellant for making a police report in
relation to a criminal offence. This would therefore be an administrative law
issue as it pertained to the illegality of the Council’s determination.

37 We agreed with the Judge that the Council did not sanction the Appellant
for the very act of making a police report. It did so for, among other
reasons, the less than courteous language which she consistently used in her
e-mail correspondence against the Complainants, the Request for Further
Arguments, the Applicant’s Closing Submissions as well as the Police Report
(see above at [6]–[9]). The argument that she was being penalised for making a
police report was a mischaracterisation of the nature of the charge against
her. The upshot is that there was no issue of illegality in the Council’s
exercise of jurisdiction.

38 We were not persuaded by the Appellant’s submissions that she did not make
false allegations because she did make calls on 13 September 2018 and Mr Kong
failed to return her calls, and that he had committed perjury by stating that
he had not received calls. Based on the chronology of events, Gill JC first
ruled on 13 September that the impugned Page 98 should be removed (see [5]
above). Yet, on 17 September, the Appellant filed the Bundle of Documents
containing Page 98 (see [6] above). The Complainants then invited her to
remove Page 98 on 20 September, to which the Appellant replied by way of the
20 September 2018 E-mail, claiming that she had left several messages for Mr
Kong. As Gill JC has similarly observed, it was in the context of the
Appellant’s 20 September 2018 E-mail that Mr Kong deposed in his affidavit
that he had received no calls. He was therefore referring to the fact that he
received no calls on 20 September, not that he had received no calls a week
earlier on 13 September. The Appellant’s allegation of perjury against Mr Kong
was untenable.

39 In a related vein, we noted that there was no prejudice to the Appellant
from the removal of the word “false” in the Clarification Letter. The
Council’s determination plainly stated that the falsity of the allegation was
not the crux of the complaint; it was the lack of professional courtesy which
the Appellant had continuously exhibited. This was made clear in the IC Report
(see [11(a)] above). We were also of the view that the Council was quoting
from the original complaints in using the word “false”; its inclusion in the
Respondent’s 8 April 2021 Letter was at best a clerical error that did not
prejudice the Appellant. Therefore, the Appellant’s claim of prejudice
encompassing notions of breach of natural justice was misconceived. She had
wrongly asserted that the Respondent decided on the issue of falsehood and
then changed its mind in the Clarification Letter after the Judge’s comments.
The IC made it explicit that it was not deciding on falsity, and this is also
set out at para 38 of Mr Gopalan’s (the Respondent’s representative’s)
affidavit.

40 In any event, we did not think that an allegation of prejudice, without
more, rendered this case one relating to administrative law. The fact that a
judge may apply principles such as natural justice to set aside an order does
not make a case an administrative law case. Our conclusion is that the present
appeal did not arise from a case relating to administrative law.

41 For the reasons stated, the appeal should have been made to the Appellate
Division. The appeal was made to the wrong court.

The appeal has no merit

42 Besides the preliminary issue, we considered the other arguments raised by
the Appellant that the Judge had erred. We did not consider any of them to be
meritorious. The Judge was right not to vary the penalty or to set aside the
Council’s decision.

43 We begin with the scope of review under s 95 of the LPA. We noted that the
Judge had observed that the court’s role was only to review the
appropriateness of the penalty imposed by the Respondent, and that the court
was not to examine the merits of the findings made, referring to the court’s
observations in Iskandar. We would clarify that although the court is not to
engage in a full merits review under s 95 of the LPA, in so far as it would
not be conducting a re-hearing of the dispute, the court does have the
jurisdiction to scrutinise the basis of the Council’s decision, such as
whether the facts before the IC warranted the IC’s findings, and in the event
that the findings were wrong in law or in fact, to determine whether the
Council’s acceptance of the IC’s findings should be set aside. This is
consistent with Law Society of Singapore v Ang Boon Kong Lawrence [1992] 3
SLR(R) 825 at [10], where the court rejected the Law Society’s argument that
the court had no jurisdiction under s 95 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161,
1990 Rev Ed) (“LPA (1990 Rev Ed)”) to enquire into an Inquiry Committee’s
conduct of the matter, but only the Council’s determination. The court found
that it had such jurisdiction, since the Council was statutorily bound under s
87 of the LPA (1990 Rev Ed) to consider the Inquiry Committee’s report and
would regard it as one of the most important factors in its determination as a
matter of practice. The court thus held that if the Inquiry Committee’s
recommendations were wrongly or improperly arrived at, this may be a
reviewable matter as the Council may have taken extraneous matters into
consideration. We would also emphasise that under ss 95(3)(a) and 95(3)(b) of
the LPA, the court can vary or set aside the penalty. This would necessarily
involve an examination of the merits of the underlying decision. As we have
observed in Iskandar at [33], this contrasts with the power granted to the
court under s 97 that does not encompass the power to decide on any penalty.
In our view, the court’s power and scope of review under s 95 is not so
circumscribed.

44 We now return to the substance of the appeal. The Appellant raised a new
contention that she was falsely charged for the breaches of rr 7(1) and 7(2)
of the PCR. The charge that the Appellant had answered to, as stated in the 18
November 2019 Letter and the 8 April 2021 Letter, was confined to false
allegations of perjury. When the Respondent issued the Clarification Letter,
it removed the word “false”, which fundamentally changed the charge against
the Appellant. This amounted to a breach of natural justice, as the Appellant
was denied a fair opportunity to put her own case to correct or contradict the
Respondent’s allegations against her. The Judge also wrongfully allowed the
Respondent to amend the charge. We have dealt with this contention above at
[39]. Given our conclusion there, it could not be said that there was any
deficiency in the Respondent’s process that prejudiced the Appellant.

45 Further, there was also no breach of the rules of natural justice in the
conduct of the Council or that of the court below; the Appellant had the
opportunity to be heard. Before the Council, the Appellant was given the
opportunity to make a mitigation plea and she did make use of this
opportunity. Before the Judge, the Appellant was not denied the opportunity to
respond. In fact, after Mr Gopalan’s affidavit was filed in OS 432, the
Appellant responded with another affidavit filed on 30 June 2021. The
Appellant was also given the opportunity to present her case before the Judge.

46 In addition, the Appellant alleged that Mr Gopalan’s affidavit contained
multiple instances of hearsay, particularly in paragraph 8. However, she did
not particularise why paragraph 8 of the impugned affidavit was hearsay. We
could not agree that it was. Paragraph 8 of Mr Gopalan’s affidavit set out a
short summary of the events leading up to the filing of the complaints. This
included what happened in OS 1100, and the established timeline of events, all
of which are included in the Notes of Evidence and Notes of Argument of Gill
JC (these being the Notes of Evidence from the hearing on 13 September 2018
and the Notes of Argument from the hearing on 10 October 2018), and in the IC
Report which contains the same undisputed timeline. Even if Mr Gopalan had no
personal knowledge of what happened in the OS 1100 hearings, we agreed with
the Respondent that, in this case, the Notes of Evidence are public records
made by a public officer in the discharge of his official duty, which fall
within the exception to the hearsay rule under s 37 of the Evidence Act (Cap
97, 1997 Rev Ed). In Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju and
another matter [2017] 4 SLR 1369 (“Udeh Kumar”), the Court of Three Judges
held that the minute sheets recorded and signed by various district judges
constituted entries into a public record by public officers in the discharge
of their official duties, and were thus relevant and admissible under s 37 of
the Evidence Act. Gill JC’s minute sheets were no different. Like the court in
Udeh Kumar, we observed that s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev
Ed) defines “public officer” to mean the holder of any office of emolument in
the service of the Government, which would include a Judicial Commissioner,
and that s 76(a) of the Evidence Act defines “public documents” to include the
documents recording the acts of public officers (including judicial officers)
in Singapore, which would include Notes of Evidence and Notes of Argument.

47 Section 32(1)(b) is also an applicable exception to the hearsay rule. The
court in Udeh Kumar also found that the district judges’ minute sheets would
have come within the exception under s 32(1)(b) of the Evidence Act, which
rendered statements “made by a person in the ordinary course of a trade,
business, profession or other occupation” relevant and thus admissible (Udeh
Kumar at [13]–[14]). While s 32(4)(b) of the Evidence Act read with O 38 r 4
of the ROC 2014 would have required the Respondent to give notice of its
intention to rely on evidence falling within s 32(1) of the Evidence Act, like
the court in Udeh Kumar (at [14]), we were prepared to exercise our discretion
under O 2 of the ROC 2014 to cure this non-compliance. The failure to give
notice did not prejudice the Appellant. The Appellant had filed requests for
copies of the Notes of Evidence dated 13 September 2018 and Notes of Argument
dated 10 October 2018 in the course of OS 1100. Gill JC’s notes were also
referred to in the reports of the IC and DT. These would have given the
Appellant sufficient notice of the contents of both sets of notes, which in
any event originated from proceedings in which the Appellant was intimately
involved as the Applicant’s solicitor.

48 Earlier we touched on the Appellant’s contention that the Respondent had
exceeded its statutory power by disciplining and penalising the Appellant for
making the Police Report against Mr Kong for the criminal offence of perjury
(see [36]–[37] above). We will now examine her contention in detail. Her point
was that the Respondent was not authorised under the LPA to determine
allegations of criminal conduct. Her argument was that a member of the Law
Society is entitled to make a police report of an offence committed by another
member. However, if the charges against the Appellant for breaches of rr 7(1)
and 7(2) of the PCR were to be allowed, any member of the Law Society making a
police report against another member would be deemed to be breaching the PCR.
By extension of this argument, the Appellant also submitted that this could
not be a breach of r 29 of the PCR, since the proper forum for Mr Kong to
respond to the Appellant’s allegations of the criminal offence of perjury is a
forum in which he could defend himself, ie, in criminal proceedings.

49 As alluded to above at [37], the IC’s findings were not based on the making
of the Police Report as such; rather, they were based on her pattern of
conduct in repeatedly making serious allegations for purposes other than
making a complaint to the Law Society. It cannot be said that this finding was
wrong in law.

50 Finally, on the question of whether the penalty imposed was appropriate,
the penalty sum of $10,000 was a global sum in respect of three distinct
breaches of the PCR. This was based on the IC’s recommendation that the
Appellant should be ordered to pay a penalty for breaches of rr 7(1) and 7(2)
of the PCR (this was not referred to the DT as there was no cause of
sufficient gravity), and the DT’s determination that a penalty should be
imposed for breaches of rr 13(2) and 29 of the PCR. Given that there were
three distinct breaches of the PCR, the global sum of $10,000 was not out of
line with the precedents:

(a) In Law Society of Singapore v Looi Wan Hui [2018] SGDT 6, the respondent’s
discourteous actions were found to be a breach of r 7(2) of the PCR. He faced
two charges for continuing to practice using the name of another law practice
without permission and for failing to finalise his exit from the said law
practice, causing the law practice to have to take up a formal application to
rectify the situation. The global penalty was $8,000, based on $4,000 per
charge. The lack of courtesy in that case was much less serious than the
repeated serious and spiteful allegations the Appellant had made against Mr
Kong.

(b) In Law Society of Singapore v Ravi S/O Madasamy [2012] SGDT 12, the
Disciplinary Tribunal ordered that the respondent pay a penalty of $3,000 for
making disparaging remarks against a judge, which went against an advocate and
solicitor’s duty to act with due courtesy to the court before which he or she
was appearing, as prescribed under r 55(a) of the Legal Profession
(Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed). In that case, the
mitigating factors in favour of the respondent were stronger than in the
present appeal. The respondent was suffering from bipolar condition at the
material time, and subsequently, was contrite over his behaviour.

51 The Appellant’s lack of remorse was indeed a relevant factor. The charge
was never about the making of false allegations, but that she had persistently
resorted to making discourteous remarks against a fellow practitioner. The
lack of remorse was therefore relevant in determining the penalty for failing
to accord courtesy to a fellow legal practitioner. In fact, this pattern of
conduct continued in her two written mitigation statements dated 9 November
2020 and 3 March 2021. She stated that the “Complainants tried to poison the
mind of an inexperience [sic] Judge”, and that “[the] dead man [referring to
Mr Kong] is not here to make his case. How can the dead man [sic] non-
testimony be preferred over mine …”. She also stated that “[t]here was no time
to ask niceties of an evil person whom God has punished by taking his life in
his prime”, a statement which was not only spiteful but which also fully
displayed her own self-righteousness. The Council was right in relying on
these remarks as indicative of her lack of remorse. The Council was also not
wrong in considering the fact that the allegations were contained in multiple
documents. They were not found in the 20 September 2018 E-mail alone, but also
in the other documents specifically mentioned in the IC Report. Hence, the
multiple occasions on which the allegations were made, coupled with the lack
of remorse on the Appellant’s part, were sufficient aggravating factors that
justified the Council’s decision on the penalty.

52 Hence, there was no basis on which the Council’s imposition of the penalty
should be varied or set aside.

Conclusion

53 In summary, the appeal should have been made to the Appellate Division, and
it was in any event completely without merit. We dismissed the appeal with
costs to the Respondent, fixed at $30,000 (all-in). The usual consequential
orders applied.

SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE

22 February 2023

Case summary

Tan Beng Hui Carolyn v Law Society of Singapore [2023] SGCA 7

  

Court of Appeal – Civil Appeal No 16 of 2022

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Belinda Ang Saw Ean JCA):

Outcome: The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the appellant advocate
and solicitor against the $10,000 penalty imposed by the Law Society of
Singapore.

Pertinent and significant points of the judgment:

• The appeal was not a case relating to administrative law and should not have
been made to the Court of Appeal. It was not brought by way of judicial review
for which leave would have been required under O 53 r 1 of the Rules of Court
(Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). The reliefs sought were not those made available
by judicial review, and the appellant sought to challenge the merits of the
Law Society’s determination, not the legality of it: at [27], [33], [34],
[35].

• The scope of the court’s review under s 95 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap
161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”), while not a full merits review, could extend to
scrutinising the basis of a decision of the Council of the Law Society (the
“Council”). This is because s 95 empowers the court to vary or set aside a
penalty ordered by the Council: at [43].

Background to the appeal

1 The Appellant, Tan Beng Hui Carolyn, is an advocate and solicitor of the
Supreme Court of Singapore and a partner in Tan & Au LLP. Whilst acting as an
advocate and solicitor in a matter before the General Division of the High
Court in HC/OS 1100/2017 (“OS 1100”) in September 2018, the Appellant made
several allegations against the counsel for the other parties (namely, counsel
from Central Chambers Law Corporation (“CCLC”) and Yeo-Leong & Peh LLC
(“YLP”)), as well as against Dedar Singh Gill JC (as he then was) (“Gill JC”)
who heard OS 1100. Complaints were made by counsel from CCLC and YLP (the
“Complainants”) to the Law Society over the Appellant’s conduct.

2 On 13 September 2018, the Complainants informed Gill JC that Tan & Au LLP
had included in their Bundle of Documents a document that was not in evidence.
Gill JC directed that the new document was not to be admitted. Shortly
thereafter, Tan & Au LLP filed a recusal application against Gill JC. In the
Appellant’s supporting affidavit (the “Recusal Affidavit”), she made certain
allegations against Gill JC as well as some of the Complainants, which formed
the subject matter of the complaints against her. CCLC invited Tan & Au LLP to
remove parts of the Recusal Affidavit, on the basis that they contained
allegations against other legal practitioners made without giving them a
chance to respond. Tan & Au LLP refused to do so.

3 Further, on 17 September 2018, Tan & Au LLP filed its Bundle of Documents,
which still contained the new evidence on page 98 (“Page 98”). YLP invited Tan
& Au LLP to remove Page 98, as Gill JC had directed its exclusion. The
Appellant declined, and responded by e-mail on 20 September 2018 (the “20
September 2018 E-mail”) to one Mr David Kong, a solicitor of YLP. In the 20
September 2018 E-mail, the Appellant claimed that she had left several
messages for Mr Kong, and her calls had not been returned. Mr Kong filed an
affidavit to refute the allegation, stating that he did not receive any calls
from the Appellant.

4 On 25 September 2018, Gill JC allowed CCLC’s and YLP’s striking out
applications for impugned portions of the Recusal Affidavit and Page 98 to be
removed, and dismissed the recusal application. After the hearing, Tan & Au
LLP wrote to request to make further arguments on 28 September 2018 (the
“Request for Further Arguments”), where another allegation against Mr Kong was
raised. The Appellant alleged that Mr Kong had lied on oath when he said on
affidavit that he had not received any calls from the Appellant and thus
committed perjury, as the Appellant had in fact made several phone calls to
him and left several messages. The Appellant had also lodged a police report
on 27 September 2018, essentially repeating the same allegation.

5 The Appellant’s Request for Further Arguments was dismissed by Gill JC, who
found that Mr Kong’s affidavit was referring to the fact that no calls were
made on 20 September, and not that no calls were made on 13 September.
Subsequently, on 12 October 2018, Tan & Au LLP filed closing submissions in OS
1100, repeating the same allegations which were ordered to be struck out by
Gill JC.

6 The Complainants lodged 13 complaints with the Law Society on 26 October
2018 against the Appellant and/or one Mr Au Thye Chuen (“Mr Au”), another
partner with Tan & Au LLP. The present appeal concerned three categories of
complaints against the Appellant: (a) the failure to accord respect to other
legal practitioners, through her allegations against Mr Kong (breach of rr
7(1) and 7(2) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015
(“PCR”)); (b) the failure to be respectful of a court, through her remarks
about Gill JC (breach of r 13 of the PCR); and (c) the failure to provide
other solicitors with the opportunity to respond to allegations, particularly
her allegation of perjury against Mr Kong (breach of r 29 of the PCR).

7 An Inquiry Committee (“IC”) was convened and recommended in its report (the
“IC Report”) that the rr 13 and 29 breaches be referred to a DT for formal
investigation, and the breach of r 7 not be referred but that a penalty be
imposed. The Law Society adopted these findings and determinations.

8 The DT found the rr 13(2) and 29 breaches to have been established. The
Council accepted the DT’s findings and determined that a penalty of $10,000
should be imposed for the breaches of rr 7(1), 7(2), 13(2) and 29 of the PCR.
This determination was conveyed to the Appellant in a letter dated 8 April
2021 (the “8 April 2021 Letter”).

9 On 3 May 2021, the Appellant applied by way of HC/OS 432/2021 to have the
court review and set aside the decision of the Council under s 95 of the LPA.
The Judge dismissed the application, finding that the penalty imposed was in
line with relevant precedents and was justified by the relevant aggravating
factors. At the hearing, the Judge had also observed that the 8 April 2021
Letter did not accurately capture the nature of the Appellant’s breach of r 7
of the PCR, which was for the making of allegations against Mr Kong rather
than the making of “false” allegations. Thereafter, the Law Society issued a
clarification letter (the “Clarification Letter”) removing the word “false”.
The Appellant then filed further submissions essentially seeking a review of
the entirety of the Law Society’s determination. The Appellant argued that the
Law Society had conflated her allegation of criminal conduct with an
allegation of professional misconduct against Mr Kong. The Judge found no
basis for the Appellant to seek such a review, and, in any event, no
conflation of allegations.

10 The Appellant filed her appeal before the Court of Appeal. She argued that
the appeal should be heard by the Court of Appeal and not the Appellate
Division of the High Court, as the appeal concerned a case relating to
administrative law. The Law Society disagreed. The Appellant also sought to
challenge the Law Society’s determination on the basis that the Law Society
acted outside its jurisdiction when it effectively disciplined the Appellant
for making a criminal complaint, when such a matter was to be determined by a
criminal court. The Appellant also submitted that the Law Society’s reply
affidavit for OS 432 contained hearsay.

The decision of the Court

11 The Appellate Division was the correct forum to hear the appeal, as OS 432
was not a case relating to administrative law and therefore did not fall
within paragraph 1(a) of the Sixth Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature
Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed): at [27].

12 First, OS 432 was an application made pursuant to s 95 of the LPA. It was
not commenced by way of judicial review for which the Appellant would have
needed to obtain leave under O 53 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
2014 Rev Ed). The reliefs sought were the review and setting aside of the
Council’s decision, and not reliefs provided by judicial review: at [33].

13 Second, the grounds of application under OS 432 pertained to the merits of
the Council’s determination, rather than the legality of it. The Appellant
also sought to challenge the appropriateness of the penalty imposed, which
entailed a substantive review of the merits of the Council’s determination, as
the court could potentially substitute the penalty imposed. The basis of this
penalty review was statutory, and not found in administrative law judicial
review powers: at [34], [35].

14 Although the Appellant raised contentions on appeal that the Council had
acted ultra vires, as the IC Report made clear, the Council did not sanction
the Appellant for making a police report as such, but for repeatedly making
serious allegations against a fellow legal practitioner. There was no issue of
illegality in the Council’s exercise of jurisdiction: at [37], [49].

15 There was also no prejudice caused to the Appellant when the Clarification
Letter removed the reference to the allegations being “false”. The IC made it
explicit that its findings were not based on the allegations being false. In
any event, an allegation of prejudice, without more, did not render this case
one relating to administrative law: [39], [40], [44].

16 In exercising its powers of review under s 95 of the LPA, the court could
scrutinise the basis of the Council’s decision, since it had the power to vary
or set aside the penalty pursuant to ss 95(3)(a) and 95(3)(b) of the LPA. This
was consistent with the holding in Law Society of Singapore v Ang Boon Kong
Lawrence [1992] 3 SLR(R) 825 at [10], that where an Inquiry Committee’s
recommendations were wrongly or improperly arrived at and considered by the
Council, this may be a reviewable matter as the Council may have taken
extraneous matters into consideration. This was in contrast to s 97 of the
LPA, which does not allow the court to decide on any penalty: at [43].

17 The appeal was completely without merit. There was no breach of natural
justice as the Appellant was not prejudiced by the Clarification Letter; the
Appellant was also given the opportunity to be heard: at [45].

18 The Law Society’s representative’s affidavit did not contain inadmissible
hearsay. The impugned portions outlined events that had been included in
public records falling within the exception to the hearsay rule under s 37 of
the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). They also qualified as statements made
by a person in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or other
occupation under s 32(1)(b) of the Evidence Act: at [46], [47].

19 The penalty of $10,000 was appropriate. It was a global sum in respect of
three distinct breaches of the PCR and was not out of line with the
precedents. It was also justified by the Appellant’s lack of remorse and
repeated making of allegations, which were aggravating: at [50], [51].

of decision. It is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the
