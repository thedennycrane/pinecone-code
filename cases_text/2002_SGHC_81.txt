**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. The plaintiff, Mr Peer Voss, carries on business in Germany as a seller of
automobiles under the style of Peer Voss Automobiles. In August 2000, Mr Voss
sent out a circular to various customers in Korea in which he offered for sale
one model CLK320 convertible Mercedes Benz motorcar with a silver body and
black leather interior at a C&F price of DM108,600. This desirable vehicle was
snapped up by a company called Seohwan Trading Co Ltd of Seoul, Korea
(‘Seohwan’) on 15 August 2000.

2\. Seohwan having made a down payment of DM48,500, Mr Voss arranged for
shipment of the car to them. Through his forwarding agents he entered into a
contract of carriage with the defendants, APL Co. Pte Ltd (‘APL’), who agreed
to carry the car on board the vessel ‘Hyundai General’ from Hamburg to the
port of Busan, South Korea. The car was loaded on board the vessel on 28
August 2000.

3\. In respect of the shipment and the contract of carriage, APL issued at
Bremen, Germany, on 28 August 2000, a document entitled ‘Bill of Lading’
bearing the number ‘APLU 701416646’. The bill of lading, as is customary,
contained several blank boxes with printed headings which were then completed
by the parties. In the box entitled ‘Shipper’, Mr Voss’s full name and address
were inserted. The box entitled ‘Consignee’ contained the following printed
words:

> ‘(Name and Full Address/Non-Negotiable Unless Consigned to Order)  
>  (Unless provided otherwise, a consignment "To Order" means to Order of
> Shipper.)

Typed into the box were Seohwan’s full name and address. That was all. The
words ‘Or Order’ did not appear in this box. The consignee box was followed by
a ‘Notify Party’ box and that was also completed by the insertion of Seohwan’s
full name and address. At the bottom of the front page of the document, just
above APL’s signature the following words appeared:

> ‘A set of 3 originals of this bill of lading is hereby issued by the
> Carrier. Upon surrender to the Carrier of any one negotiable bill of lading,
> properly endorsed, all others shall stand void.’

The bill of lading also bore the endorsements ‘Freight Prepaid’, ‘Shipped on
board Aug. 28, 2000’ and ‘Original BL’.

4\. The three original bills of lading were released to Mr Voss and he then
sent an invoice dated 28 August 2000 to Seohwan for the full price of
DM108,600. He retained the bills pending receipt of the balance due from
Seohwan, ie DM60,100. Mr Voss asserts that todate this money has not been
paid.

5\. The vessel arrived at Busan sometime in the third week of September 2000
and the car was duly discharged into the custody of APL’s Korean office. On 25
September, a man named Seoh Pyung Hwan went to that office and identified
himself as being from Seohwan. He claimed delivery of the car. He produced two
documents, namely a copy of a commercial invoice from Peer Voss Automobile to
Seohwan dated 22 September 2000 for DM107,500, and a copy of an outgoing cable
from the Korea Exchange Bank to a bank in Frankfurt purporting to show a
remittance of DM207,500 to Mr Voss in respect of this vehicle and of another
transaction as well. On the basis of these documents, APL’s Korean office
authorised the release of the car into Seohwan’s custody the same day.

6\. The next day, Mr Voss’s forwarders told APL’s Hamburg office not to
release the cargo to Seohwan without production of the original bill of
lading. Following this conversation Mr Kim of APL’s Korean office spoke to the
consignee on more than one occasion and the consignee insisted that payment
had already been made to Mr Voss but that there were disputes between Seohwan
and Mr Voss regarding other transactions which were not related to this
shipment.

7\. In November 2000, Mr Voss wrote to Seohwan demanding payment of the
balance sum by 7 November 2000. No reply was received. In mid December 2000,
he wrote to APL’s Hamburg office regarding the alleged mis-delivery of the
cargo and demanded that they pay the balance sum. APL refused to make payment
as it took the position that it had been entitled to make delivery to Seohwan
as the named consignee without production of the original bill of lading.

8\. This action was commenced in May last year. Mr Voss claimed that in breach
of the contract of carriage or in breach of their duty as bailee and/ or
negligently APL had failed to exercise due care with the cargo and had failed
to deliver the cargo against presentation of the original bill of lading and
instead delivered it to Seohwan, the consignee, who did not have or present or
produce the original bill of lading. He therefore claimed the balance sum of
DM60,100 from APL.

9\. In June 2001, Mr Voss made an application for summary judgment. This was
followed by an application from APL for the determination of the following
question under O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court:

> Whether, on the construction of the bill of lading, APLU 701416646, APL was
> entitled to deliver the cargo described therein without production of the
> original bill of lading.

The two applications were heard together before the Deputy Registrar, Mr Foo
Chee Hock, who found in favour of Mr Voss and consequently made the following
order:

> (1) on the true construction of the shipping documents, in particular the
> bill of lading as exhibited at "PV-1" of the plaintiff’s first affidavit
> filed the 19th day of June 2001, the Defendants were contractually not
> entitled to release the cargo described therein without production of the
> original bill of lading, the clear inference from the undisputed objective
> evidence being that the parties had contracted on the basis that the
> original bill of lading would be produced against delivery of the cargo
> described therein.
>
> (2) There being no defence to the claim, final judgment be entered for the
> plaintiff against the defendants for the sum of DM60,100.00 or its Singapore
> dollar equivalent.

The Deputy Registrar also ordered APL to pay interest and costs. APL appealed
against the whole of this order.

Did the contract of carriage require production of the bill of lading for
delivery of cargo?

**

10\. The submission made on behalf of Mr Voss was that it is a firmly
established principle of law in the mercantile world that in a contract for
the carriage of goods by sea, delivery of the cargo is to be made at the
discharge port by the carrier to the consignee only upon the production by the
consignee of the original bill of lading. This principle is implied into all
contracts for the carriage of goods by sea. In support counsel cited the well
known observation of Lord Denning that ‘It is perfectly clear law that a ship-
owner who delivers without production of the bill of lading does so at his
peril. The contract is to deliver, on production of the bill of lading, to the
person entitled under the bill of lading’. See _Sze Hai Tong Bank v Rambler
Cycle Co. Ltd_[1959] 25 MLJ 200 at 201.

> > 11\. APL’s reply was that Lord Denning’s observation and similar remarks
> made by other judges applied only to the situation where the bill of lading
> issued was a ‘to order’ bill of lading. If the bill made the goods
> deliverable to a specific person as consignee and did not contain any words
> importing transferability, the carrier’s duty was simply to deliver the
> goods to the consignee on proof of identity. The carrier would not need to
> obtain the original bill of lading (or any one of the original bills of
> lading) from the consignee in order to make delivery. It was common ground
> that the bill issued by APL was not an order bill since the consignee box
> contained Seohwan’s name only.

12\. The basic issue therefore to be considered was whether when it came to
delivery, there was a distinction between the delivery of goods covered by a
bill of lading that was made out ‘to order’ or ‘to bearer’ and commonly known
as an order bill of lading and one that specified the name of the consignee
without the addition of the words ‘to order’ or ‘assigns’. This latter type of
bill of lading has been referred to variously as a ‘non-negotiable’ bill of
lading, a ‘straight consigned’ bill and a ‘straight bill’. In this judgment I
will call it a straight bill.

13\. This issue was last considered by this court in _Olivine Electronics Pte
Ltd v Seabridge Transport Pte Ltd_[1995] 3 SLR 143, where the facts were
practically identical with the facts here. In that case, the plaintiffs were
the shippers of a cargo of colour television sets which was carried by the
defendants on board the vessel _Leeward_ from Singapore to Vostochny, Russia.
A company called Orient Plus was named as the consignee and the notify party
in the bill of lading. On arrival of the cargo at Vostochny, it was delivered
by the defendants to Orient Plus without production of the bill of lading. The
plaintiffs, who had not been paid, sued the defendants for the price and took
out an application for summary judgment. The defendants resisted and the
Assistant Registrar granted them conditional leave to defend. Both parties
appealed and the appeal came on for hearing before Goh Joon Seng, J. The
appeal was dismissed.

14\. In his grounds of decision, Justice Goh noted that the defendants’
argument had been that the principle of law enunciated by Lord Denning in the
_Rambler Cycle_ case only applied to bills of lading which were made out ‘To
order’ or ‘to bearer’ and did not apply to a ‘straight consigned bill’ which
was one with a named consignee. In support they had relied on a passage from
the fourth edition of Benjamin’s _Sale of Goods_(18-010). The plaintiffs on
the other hand had relied on dicta from _Evans & Reid v Cornouaille _[1921] 8
LLR 76 where Hill J had stated the master of a vessel could not deliver cargo
to a consignee named in a bill of lading without production of the original
bill.

15\. Justice Goh reached no concluded decision on the issue. In the event, the
point was not finally decided in that case because the defendants were unable
to furnish the security ordered and the plaintiffs consequently signed
judgment in default. Interestingly enough, the law firms representing the
plaintiffs and defendants in _Olivine Electronics_ were the same law firms who
represented Mr Voss and APL respectively before me and, having been given the
opportunity to revisit this issue, they did so quite exhaustively.

16\. The first decision that supported Mr Voss’ arguments was _The Stettin_
[1889] 14 PD 142. The plaintiff there shipped goods in London on board a
German vessel belonging to the defendants, under a bill of lading, drawn in
two parts by which the goods were to be delivered at a German port to the
consignee named in the bill of lading or to his assigns. The master delivered
the goods at the port of discharge to the consignee without the production of
either part of the bill of lading. It was held by Butt J that according to
English law (which he held to be the same as German law on the point) and the
English mode of conducting business, a shipowner was not entitled to deliver
goods to the consignee without the production of the bill of lading and that
the defendants had to take the consequences of having delivered the goods
without production of either of the two parts of which the bill of lading
consisted. Although the bill of lading in that case was to the named consignee
or his assigns thus making it an order bill, the learned Judge did not
distinguish in his judgment between an order bill and a straight bill. This is
significant since in the submissions before the court this distinction had
been drawn and it had been strongly argued that under German law in the case
of a bill of lading with a named consignee, the contract of carriage would be
fulfilled by delivering the goods to such named consignee without calling for
the bill of lading, as the master would have had in his possession the ship’s
copy of the bill of lading bearing the name of such consignee. That the Judge
chose to use the term ‘consignee’ in his judgment instead of ‘holder’ or
‘presenter’ of the bill of lading was a firm indication that he considered
that even a named consignee had to produce one part of the bill of lading in
order to obtain delivery. In the 13th Edition of _Carver’s Carriage by Sea_
published in 1982, _The Stettin_ was cited for the proposition that delivery
to the consignee named in the bill of lading does not suffice to discharge a
shipowner where the consignee does not hold the bill of lading. See 1593.

17\. The _Cornouaille_ decision came in 1921, some 32 years later. It appears
from the report that _The Stettin_ was not cited to Hill J. His views would
therefore appear to reflect a general understanding of the law at the time. He
stated:

> ‘In this case the plaintiffs shipped at Cardiff a cargo of coal on board the
> French steamship _Cornouaille_ , under a Bill of Lading for delivery at
> Nantes to the plaintiffs' order. The plaintiffs shipped the coal under a
> contract of sale entered into with the Cie. Charbonnire d'Armement et
> Transbordement Maritimes, of Paris, the terms of sale being a price f.o.b.,
> cash against documents. The documents were presented to the buyers, and were
> not taken up. The Bill of Lading was still in the hands of the plaintiffs,
> in whom the property in the coal remained. In this state of circumstances,
> the defendants' agents at Nantes and the Master of the ship delivered the
> coal to the Socit Union Charbonnire et Mtallurgique, taking a receipt upon
> the Master's copy of the Bill of Lading, and obtaining from the Socit Union
> payment of the freight.
>
> …
>
> _
>
> The fact that the coal was intended to be delivered to the Socit Union did
> not entitle the Master to deliver to anybody without production of the Bill
> of Lading. It would not have entitled him to deliver even if the Socit Union
> had been the consignees named in the Bill of Lading. It is said that the
> plaintiffs ought to have informed
>
> _ the defendants that the buyers of the coal had not taken up the documents.
> There is no such duty upon the plaintiffs. The transaction between the
> buyers and the plaintiffs had nothing to do with the shipowners. The latter
> were only concerned with the fulfilment of their Bill of Lading contract,
> and the plaintiffs were entitled to rely upon this, that the ship would not
> give delivery of the goods until the Bill of Lading, with the plaintiffs'
> endorsement upon it, was presented to the Master.’ (emphasis added)

18\. That such an understanding existed was also reflected in the first
instance decision of _Thrige v United Shipping Company Ltd_[1923] 16 Ll.L. Rep
198 which concerned a bill of lading made out to a consignee. Rowlatt J in
coming to a decision in favour of the plaintiff shipper of the goods stated:

> ‘The bills of lading were in favour of the consignee; they were made in
> duplicate and the shipper got both parts, keeping one set and sending the
> other to the bank in London. … The retaining of the bills of lading is
> important, as it retains to the plaintiff the property or control of the
> goods so that he might have the right to bring an action. The position in
> regard to a steamship company would be clear. A bill of lading is a
> protection to them; they deliver goods and take back the document on which
> they are responsible to produce the goods and so they are safe: but it is
> known to everybody that the shipper may keep a bill of lading as this
> shipper did and not hand it over to the person to whom the goods are sent
> until he is paid; and therefore the shipowner owes a duty to the shipper not
> to hand over the goods until there is production of the bill of lading.’

In this case, the shipper had sued the agent of the shipowner rather than the
shipowner himself and, on appeal, Rowlatt J’s decision was reversed on the
basis that there had been no contract between the shipper and the shipowner’s
agent. In the Court of Appeal, Scrutton LJ observed that it was not necessary
for the purposes of the appeal to decide the question as to whether when a
bill of lading is made to a consignee and the property passes on shipment, the
shipowner who delivers to the named consignee without production of the bill
of lading is or is not guilty of any breach of contract. He went on, however,
to state that if _The Stettin_ decided that there was such a duty it might
require reconsideration (at [1924] 18 Ll.L. Rep 829). So far as I am aware
Scrutton LJ’s comment is the only instance in which the correctness of _The
Stettin_ has been judicially doubted.

19\. Then came the _Rambler Cycle_ case in 1959 where Lord Denning made the
statement relied on by Mr Voss. APL says that that was a case of an order bill
and therefore Lord Denning’s comments should be looked at in that context. The
complete passage from Lord Denning’s judgment reads:

> ‘It is perfectly clear law that a shipowner who delivers without production
> of the bill of lading does so at his peril. The contract is to deliver, on
> production of the bill of lading, to the person entitled under the bill of
> lading. In this case, it was "unto Order or his or their assigns" that is to
> say, to the order of the Rambler Cycle __ Company, if they had not assigned
> the bill of lading, or to their assigns, if they had. The shipping company
> did not deliver the goods to any such person. They are therefore liable for
> breach of contract unless there is some term in the bill of lading
> protecting them. And they delivered the goods, without production of the
> bill of lading, to a person who was not entitled to receive them. They are
> therefore liable in conversion unless likewise so protected.’ (at p 201)

It is clear from the above that as far as Lord Denning was concerned, there
was a general rule that delivery was to be made only on production of the bill
of lading to a person entitled under the bill and that in the situation of an
order bill the delivery had to be made in accordance with the orders of the
shipper. Nothing Lord Denning said can be read as restricting the principle he
enunciated to the situation of the order bill only.

20\. The next famous passage on this issue is the oft quoted statement of Lord
Justice Diplock in _Barclays Bank Ltd v Commissioners of Customs and Excise_
[1963] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 81:

> ‘The contract for the carriage of goods by sea, which is evidenced by a bill
> of lading, is a combined contract of bailment and transportation under which
> the shipowner undertakes to accept possession of the goods from the shipper,
> to carry them to their contractual destination and there to surrender
> possession of them to the person who, under the terms of the contract, is
> entitled to obtain possession of them from the shipowners. Such a contract
> is not discharged by performance until the shipowner has actually
> surrendered possession (that is, has divested himself of all powers to
> control any physical dealing in the goods) to the person entitled under the
> terms of the contract to obtain possession of them.
>
> So long as the contract is not discharged, the bill of lading in my view,
> remains a document of title by indorsement and delivery of which the rights
> of property in the goods can be transferred. It is clear law that where a
> bill of lading or order is issued in respect of the contract of carriage by
> sea, the shipowner is not bound to surrender possession of the goods to any
> person whether named as consignee or not, except on production of the bill
> of lading (see _The Stettin_ , (1889) 14 P.D. 142). Until the bill of lading
> is produced to him, unless at any rate, its absence has been satisfactorily
> accounted for, he is entitled to retain possession of the goods and if he
> does part with possession he does so at his own risk if the person to whom
> he surrenders possession is not in fact entitled to the goods.  
>  (at pp 81-89)

It can be seen from that passage that Diplock LJ was endorsing the legal
principle enunciated in _The Stettin_ that it is a breach of contract to
deliver the goods otherwise than in return for an original bill of lading and
did not share the doubts as to its correctness evinced by Scrutton LJ.

21\. _The ‘Houda’_ [1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 541 was a decision of the English
Court of Appeal on a dispute arising out of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
One of the main issues involved there was whether time charterers could
lawfully require shipowners to discharge cargo loaded on board their vessel
without production of the bills of lading. In the course of answering this
question in the negative, the three justices of appeal expressed their views
on a shipowner’s obligation in regards to delivery of cargo covered by a bill
of lading. Neill LJ said (at p 552):

> ‘I can see no good reason to depart from the general rule that the owners do
> not fulfil their contractual obligations if the cargo is delivered to a
> person who cannot produce the bill of lading. Of course if such a delivery
> is made and the person to whom the cargo is delivered proves to be the true
> owner no damages would be recoverable.’

Leggatt LJ agreed with that view stating that under a bill of lading contract
a shipowner is obliged to deliver goods upon production of the original bill
of lading and delivery without production constitutes a breach of contract
even when made to the person entitled to possession (at p 553). The third
member of the court, Millett LJ while citing the _Rambler Cycle_ and the
_Barclays Bank_ cases to support the principle that under a bill of lading
contract, the shipowners are obliged to deliver cargo only against
presentation of a bill of lading, went further than his brethen in ascribing
the reason for this principle to be the fact that, a bill of lading being a
negotiable receipt for the cargo, once the master had signed it and part with
it he would have subjected the owners to a contractual obligation, enforceable
at the suit of any person to whom the bill had been negotiated, to deliver the
cargo to that person. Millett LJ was therefore specifically dealing with a
negotiable bill of lading but the views of the other two judges were not so
circumscribed.

22\. Now I must deal with two decisions by Justice Clarke in the English
Admiralty Court. The first, _The Sormovskiy 3068_ [1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 266,
was decided in January 1994. The _Sormovskiy 3068_ was chartered to the
plaintiffs to carry a cargo of sugar. The plaintiffs subsequently acquired the
original bills of lading for the cargo which were delivered to them endorsed
in blank. The vessel then arrived at the port of discharge and began discharge
without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiffs. None of the three original
bills of lading was presented to the master before discharge began and by the
time the plaintiffs learnt about the discharge and stopped it, about 2,070
tonnes of sugar had been discharged. The plaintiffs claimed against the
defendants as owners of the vessel for the loss sustained by reason of
delivery of 2,070 tonnes of sugar without presentation of an original bill of
lading.

23\. It was held by Clarke J inter alia that:

> (1) the defendants correctly accepted that under the bill of lading they
> were obliged to deliver the goods to the person entitled to possession of
> it; since the bill was expressed to be ‘to order’, those persons were the
> plaintiffs as holders of the bill of lading because it had been endorsed in
> blank.
>
> (2) subject to the terms of the contract and save in exceptional
> circumstances a shipowner must not deliver the goods otherwise than against
> presentation of an original bill of lading unless it was proved to his
> reasonable satisfaction both that the person seeking the goods was entitled
> to possession of them and that there was some reasonable explanation of what
> had become of the bills of lading.

In coming to the conclusions stated above, Clarke J undertook a survey of the
existing authorities including _Barclays Bank_ , _Rambler Cycle, The Stettin,_
and _The ‘Houda’_. He observed (at p 272) :

> ‘None of those cases is my judgment inconsistent with the plaintiffs’ case,
> namely that subject to the terms of the particular contract and save in
> exceptional circumstances, a shipowner must not deliver the goods otherwise
> than against presentation of an original bill of lading. That seems to me to
> be implicit in the express provision quoted above that any one of the bills
> of lading being accomplished the others to stand void. In my judgment it is
> implicit in that provision that, save perhaps in exceptional circumstances,
> one would expect of the bills to be ‘accomplished’ by being presented to the
> master or a shipowner. The above quotation from the judgment of Lord Denning
> in the _Sze Hai Tong_ case suggests that he would have taken the same view.
> I observe that in Cooke on Voyage Charters at p. 387 the authors cite that
> case as authority for the proposition that
>

>> ‘… the bill of lading, by implication if not expressly, makes the goods
deliverable upon, and only upon, the surrender of the bill of lading.’"

Clarke J also stated that he preferred the plaintiffs’ submissions because
they appeared to be consistent with the tenor of the authorities and to make
more commercial sense as:

> ‘It makes commercial sense to have a simple rule that in the absence of an
> express term of the contract the master must only deliver the cargo to the
> holder of the bill of lading who presents it to him. In that way both the
> shipowners and the persons in truth entitled to possession of the cargo are
> protected by the terms of the contract.’ (at p 274)

Although Clarke J was dealing with an order bill, it is clear from his
judgment that he considered these principles on delivery to apply to all bills
and not only to order bills.

24\. In the next case, _The ‘Ines’_ [1995] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 144, decided in March
1995, the plaintiffs were the owners of telephones shipped to St. Petersburg
under a bill of lading naming one company as consignee and another as the
notify party. The cargo was released by the port authorities, acting as agents
for the shipowner, to the notify party without presentation of an original
bill of lading to themselves or to anyone else before delivery. Clarke J held
that the shipowners were liable to the plaintiffs for breach of contract
because the goods had been delivered without presentation of an original bill
of lading. In reaching this conclusion, he did not draw any distinction
between an order bill and a straight bill.

25\. The Malaysian High Court too has accepted the principle that it is a
breach of contract for a shipowner to deliver cargo without the production of
the bill of lading even when delivery is made to the consignee. See ‘ _The
Taveechai Marine’_ [1995] 1 MLJ 413.

26\. There are also several academic writers who believe that the above is the
correct position. Among these is William Tetley who in the third edition of
his well known text _Marine Cargo Claims_ states (at p 985) ‘if goods are
delivered to someone who does not present the original bill of lading, even if
that person is the named consignee, the carrier will be responsible for any
resulting loss. In common law jurisdictions, the carrier would be liable for
tort for conversion …’. In para 1.4.1 of _Bills of Lading and Bankers’
Documentary Credits_ by Paul Todd, it is stated that when a bill of lading is
made out to a named consignee, he alone may validly present it to obtain the
goods from the vessel and in the 20th Edition of _Scrutton on Charterparties
and Bills of Lading_ at page 292 the following passage appears:

> ‘The shipowner or master is justified in delivering the goods to the first
> person who presents to him a bill of lading, making the goods deliverable to
> him, though that bill of lading is only one of a set, provided that he has
> no notice of any other claims to the goods, or knowledge of any other
> circumstances raising a reasonable suspicion that the claimant is not
> entitled to the goods. If he has any such notice of knowledge, he must
> deliver at his peril to the rightful owner, or must interplead. He is not
> entitled to deliver to the consignee named in the bill of lading, without
> the production of the bill of lading, and does so at his risk if the
> consignee is not in fact entitled to the goods.’

The 10th Edition of _Schmitthoff’s Export Trade_(published in 2000)__ echoed
(at pp 290-292) the view expressed in the 9th Edition that even a bill of
lading which was not negotiable operated as a document of title because the
named consignee could only claim the goods if able to produce the bill of
lading.

27\. I now turn to the authorities cited by APL to justify their position. APL
relied on three fairly recent cases and various passages from _Carver on Bills
of Lading_ (1st Ed, 2001) which equate a straight bill of lading with a sea
waybill when it comes to obligations relating to delivery of cargo. A sea
waybill is the maritime version of a document that has long been in use in the
context of land and air carriage. It operates as a receipt for goods received
for shipment and evidences the contract of carriage. One significant
difference between it and a bill of lading is that it is never ever a
negotiable instrument and is therefore usually used on short sea routes and
where neither the shipper nor the cargo receiver needs to pledge shipping
documents in order to raise finance. It is not issued in sets and the receiver
is able to take delivery of the goods merely by establishing his identity. The
original sea waybill need not be produced. Further, since it is not a bill of
lading the Hague Rules and the Hague Visby Rules do not apply to it. See
_Contracts for The Carriage of Goods_ edited by David Yates.

28\. _Carver on Bills of Lading_ takes the position that straight bills and
sea waybills are actually one and the same thing. This is because a straight
bill, like a sea waybill, is not a document of title since it cannot be used
to transfer ownership of goods unlike an order bill. This view is clearly
expressed in 6-007 which reads:

> ‘**Straight or non-negotiable bills and sea waybills not documents of
> title**
>
> A "straight" bill is not a document of title in the common law sense, so
> that its transfer does not operate as a transfer of the constructive
> possession of the goods. _It is not a symbol of the goods because the

I point out here that whilst one cannot endorse a straight bill so as to
transfer constructive possession of the goods, this does not mean that the
straight bill does not impose a contractual term obligating the carrier to
require its production in exchange for delivery. The sea waybill was developed
to get away from such a legally imposed obligation.

29\. For the proposition that the carrier is entitled and bound to deliver the
goods to the named consignee without production of the bill, _Carver_ cites
reports by the English and Scottish Law Commissions and also the case of _The
Brij_ [2001] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 43. The latter was a decision of the Hong Kong High
Court on a dispute between a plaintiff shipper of garments and the owner of
the vessel in which they were shipped. The facts are somewhat complicated
because the shipment was effected by a freight forwarder (WTW) which also
operated its shipping side under the name of Talent Express Line (‘Talent’).
WTW issued the plaintiff with Talent bills of lading which named the plaintiff
as the shipper, the consignee to order and the buyer’s agent Amaya as the
notify party. The plaintiff used these bills as documents of title to try to
obtain payment from the buyer under the appropriate letters of credit. At the
same time, unknown to the plaintiff, by arrangement between WTW and the
operator of the vessel, CAVN, CAVN issued bills of lading to WTW evidencing
shipment of the goods but naming WTW as shipper and the consignee as Amaya.
These bills were kept by CAVN. When the ship arrived in Venezuela the goods
were discharged into the custody of the Venezuelan customs and later released
by the customs to agents for Amaya, the consignee under the CAVN bills. The
actual buyer did not pay for the goods and the Talent bills were in fact never
given to the buyer or Amaya. The plaintiff sued the defendant carrier for mis-
delivery of the goods.

30\. It was held by Waung J that the true position was that between the
plaintiff and WTW they regarded Talent as the carrier under the Talent bill;
WTW kept the CAVN bills because they were the contracts of WTW and not the
contracts of the plaintiff; the plaintiff was not a party to the CAVN bills
and its claim in contract failed. Secondly, the plaintiff failed in tort
because there was no breach of duty of care since the duty of the carrier
under the CAVN bills was only to deliver to the named consignee Amaya. In his
judgment Waung J stated that the essence of straight bills is ‘that they are
not negotiable and the contractual mandate is to deliver to named consignee
without the production of the original document’ (at p 434). For this
proposition, he relied on a passage from the fifth edition of _Benjamin on
Sale of Goods_ which reads:

> ‘Two things follow from the fact that a document of this kind is not
> transferable by indorsement and delivery. First, the consignee (if in
> possession of the document) cannot, by purporting to transfer it in this
> way, impose on the carrier a legal obligation to deliver the goods to
> another person. Secondly, the shipper cannot oblige the carrier to deliver
> the goods to a different consignee from the one named merely by indorsing
> and delivering the bill to that other person; for under a straight bill the
> carrier is entitled and bound to deliver the goods to the originally named
> consignee without production of the bill, so that, when he delivers the
> goods, he may have no means of knowing of the purported transfer of the
> bill. This difficulty cannot arise in the case of an order bill, under which
> the goods are deliverable only on production of the bill.’

The text cites no authority for the proposition that under a straight bill the
carrier is bound to deliver to the named consignee without production of the
bill. Waung J relied only on this passage for his statement of the law. He
seems to have treated it as an uncontentious point. The various cases that I
have mentioned in 17 to 25 do not appear to have been brought to his
attention. In my view, neither _The Brij_ nor the passages of _Carver_ which
rely on it without consideration of contrary authority are strong support for
APL’s stand.

31\. The next case which APL cited was a very recent English decision. In
_‘The Chitral’_ [2001] 1 LLR 529, two sets of bills of lading were issued for
a shipment from Bremen to Dubai. The persons arranging for the shipment were
freight forwarders in Dubai (Al Ghaith) and in Germany they acted through
their agents IASC. The first set was issued by IASC to the sellers of the
cargo and named them as shippers. The consignee was expressed as ‘to the order
of CBQ’ (the bank financing the shipment). The second set of bills was issued
on behalf of the owners of the vessel to IASC as shippers and Al Ghaith was
named as consignee. The goods arrived at Dubai in a damaged condition and the
issues before the court were first whether IASC or Al Ghaith had title to sue
the carrier and if so whether, secondly, their claim was time barred. The case
basically concerned the construction of the second set of bills of lading and
whether the phrase within the printed section of this bill to the effect that
delivery was ‘to be unto the above-mentioned consignee or to his or their
assigns’ was capable changing what was on its face a straight bill into an
order bill. Steel J concluded that it was not and that the bill was non-
negotiable and that therefore under the _Carriage of Goods by Sea Act_ 1992
the parties with title to sue on it were IASC as the original party to the
contract of carriage and Al Ghaith as the person to whom delivery was to be
made. The Judge did not make any comments on whether Al Ghaith as the party to
whom delivery had to be made would have to produce the bill of lading in order
to claim the goods. It was not necessary for Steel J to do so in view of the
issues before him. The case does stand as authority for the proposition that a
bill of lading form may be drafted in such manner that it contemplates that it
may be used both as a straight bill and as a negotiable bill as required by
the carrier. It does not go further to propose different delivery obligations
depending on what decision the carrier makes as to how the bill should
operate.

32\. Finally, APL cited _The River Ngada_ reported in the 13th September 2001
issue of the Lloyd’s Maritime Law Newsletter. In this English case, Belinda
Bucknall QC sitting as a deputy judge stated that in a straight bill of lading
naming X as the consignee, the carrier’s obligation was to deliver the goods
to X and he was entitled to require X to discharge any relevant liabilities.
In such circumstances production of the bill of lading by X was not a
necessary precondition for delivery or for the exercise by the carrier of his
rights against X. The statement about production of the bill of lading was
obiter since the issue in the case was who had title to sue. Further no
authority was cited for that statement.

33\. It appeared to me that the weight of the authorities was with Mr Voss.
The position that he took had been one taken by many judges over a substantial
period of time and, even though in most of the cases the views expressed were
obiter, this did not detract from their weight as they reflected the common
understanding of the legal position. Secondly, this position had also been
endorsed by academics and writers of popular texts. It was in my view also
consistent with commercial sense as stated by Clarke J. The straight bill of
lading and the consequent delivery obligation it imposes on a carrier has been
well known for decades. A shipper who, like Mr Voss in this case, asks for the
issue of a straight bill of lading even though the alternative of a sea
waybill is available to him, wants to retain some degree of control over the
delivery of the goods. The shipowner is aware of this. If he is not prepared
to accept the restriction on delivery rights that a bill of lading imposes he
can insist on issuing a waybill instead. Once he issues a bill of lading
instead, however, whether it is an order bill or a straight bill, he must not
deliver the cargo except against its production. The contrary view had much
less support and most of it was recent and cursory. Neither Waung J nor
Belinda Bucknall QC undertook the extensive review of the authorities that
Clarke J conducted in the _Sormovskiy 3068._

34\. There was no doubt in this case that the document issued in respect of
the carriage of the car from Hamburg to Bremen was a bill of lading, not a
waybill. It called itself a bill of lading. It was issued in a set of three
and bore the endorsement ‘Original B/L’. Although the format used contemplated
that it could be used either as a non-negotiable bill or as an order bill as
in the case of _The Chitral_ , it contained no term that would vary the
carrier’s delivery obligation depending on which type of bill it was chosen to
issue. Finally, APL accepted in their pleadings that they had issued a bill of
lading. No assertion was made that the document evidencing the shipment of the
goods was, instead, a sea waybill.

35\. The other issue in the case was whether Mr Voss had in fact received full
payment for the car. Though APL tried to raise doubts about his claim to have
received only part payment, I was satisfied from the documents produced that
their arguments had no merit.

36\. Accordingly, I dismissed APL’s appeal.
