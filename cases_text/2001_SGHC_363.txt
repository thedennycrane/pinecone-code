**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. This appeal turns on the effect of Article 22(2) of the Warsaw Convention
as amended by the Hague Protocol (hereinafter referred to as "the convention")
in limiting a carriers liability for the loss, damage or delay of baggage or
cargo in the course of carriage by air.

2\. The facts of the appeal are not complicated. The consignor Philips
Singapore Pte Ltd shipped 1,000 cellular digital spark transceivers from
Singapore to Hong Kong to the consignee and plaintiff, Philips Hong Kong Ltd.
The transceivers were shipped with the defendant China Airlines Limited. An
air waybill was made out by the consignor under Article 6 of the convention
stating the "No. of pieces" stated as "1" and the gross weight as 154
kilograms. In the consignors invoice attached to the waybill, the entry under
"Packing List" was "1 pallet". The pallet arrived at Hong Kong damaged, with a
shortage of 440 transceivers of a total value of US$74,360.

3\. It is common ground between the parties the convention applies to the
claim by virtue of the Carriage by Air Act (Cap 32A).

4\. The plaintiff accepts that it is not entitled to recover the full value of
the 440 lost transceivers and that its claim is limited by Article 22(2) of
the convention which provides that

> (a) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the
> carrier is limited to a sum of 250 francs per kilogramme, unless the
> passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed
> over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at
> destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In
> that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared
> sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the passengers or
> consignors actual interest in delivery at destination.
>
> (b) In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or
> cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into
> consideration in determining the amount to which the carriers liability is
> limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned.
> Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered
> baggage or cargo or of an object contained therein, affects the value of
> other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill,
> the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into
> consideration in determining the limit of liability.

The Carriage by Air (Singapore Currency Equivalents) Order sets the equivalent
of 250 francs at $49.58.

5\. After the shortfall in delivery was discovered the defendant requested for
the packing details of the transceivers and they received a revised invoice
showing 8 cartons of 112 transceivers and 1 carton of 104 transceivers. By the
defendants description "(t)hese 9 cartons were packed into a pallet using
shrink polyethylene sheet. The shrink polyethylene sheet is a thin plastic
sheet. This is to keep the cartons together as they belonged to the same owner
for ease of handling in accordance with standard industry practice." The sheet
was damaged, and 4 cartons containing 440 transceivers were missing. The total
weight of those 4 cartons was 60 kilogrammes.

6\. The parties disagreed over whether in applying Article 22(2)(b) the
compensation was to be limited on the basis of 1 package of 154 kilogrammes as
the plaintiff contends, or 4 packages of a total 60 kilogrammes according to
the defendant. If it is the former, the compensation payable is $7,635.32 but
by the latter, it is $2,974.80.

7\. The question went before a deputy registrar who held that compensation
should be computed on the latter basis. The plaintiff appealed against the
decision to a district judge and failed. The matter came before me on appeal
from the district judges decision, and I allowed the appeal. The matter is now
to go to the Court of Appeal as I gave leave to the defendant to appeal
against my decision so that the issues can be decided at the highest level.

8\. The main issue I had to decide is whether the consignment is to be
regarded as 1 package or 9 packages. For the defendant, it was argued that

> (A)lthough Air Waybill mentioned only 1 pallet, they are allowed to produce
> evidence of details of packaging of the goods. In other words, the
> Defendants are entitled to introduce evidence of the 9 cartons even though
> the air waybill did not mention the 9 cartons.

9\. The next issue is the validity of the defendants complaint that the
plaintiffs claim is unjust because

> Article 22 is compensatory provision. It is not intended to unjustly benefit
> the Plaintiffs. Where only part of the cargo is lost, the Defendants are
> entitled to bring evidence to show the weight of the lost cargo.

The number of packages

_

10\. The convention does not define a package, but there is little doubt over
what may constitute a package. A receptacle like a box, a carton, or a pallet
can be a package. If a consignment consists of an item in a box, the box is a
package. If a consignment consists of a carton holding an item, the carton is
a package, and if the consignment is a pallet holding an item, the pallet is a
package. Differences of opinions arise where these receptacles are combined,
e.g. where a consignment is made up of a pallet formed by 5 cartons, each
containing 10 boxes. In this situation, there cannot, for the purposes of
Article 22(2) be at the same time 1 pallet-package, 5 carton-packages and 50
box-packages.

11\. This problem arises in all modes of carriage of goods. In carriage by sea
the same issue has given rise to the views and treatments referred to in Lord
Justice Phillips comprehensive review of the issues in connection with the
Hague Rules in _The "River Gurara"_[1998] 1 Ll LR 225.

12\. For the carriage of goods by air coming within the convention, assistance
is provided by Article 11(2) which states that

> **
>
> The statements in the air waybill relating to
>
> ** the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those
> relating to **the number of packages** , **are** **_prima facie_ evidence**
> **of the facts stated** ; those relating to the quantity, volume and
> condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except
> so far as they both have been and are stated in the air waybill to have
> been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the
> apparent condition of the cargo. (Emphasis added)

13\. This provision gives the parties, especially the consignor who prepares
the air waybill, the discretion to decide how the number of packages for a
particular consignment is to be reckoned. It is not the consignors sole
discretion because the carrier can have a say on it before it accepts the
consignment for carriage.

14\. Once the number of packages is fixed and stated in the air waybill, that
is _prima facie_ the number of packages for the purpose of the convention. As
long as the number stated is a correct figure, it will apply. In the example
used the number of packages could be stated as 1 (for pallets), 5 (for
cartons), or 50 (for boxes). Each of them will be the operative number of
packages when it is stated in the waybill. The number stated is not conclusive
if it is not correct, e.g. if it is stated as 3 in the example given,
reflecting neither the number of pallets, cartons nor boxes.

15\. The defendant submitted that evidence of the 9 cartons can be adduced
although it was not stated in the waybill, citing _Yusen Air & Sea Service (S)
Pte Ltd v. Changi International Airport Services Pte Ltd _[1999] 4 SLR 135
where the Court of Appeal held that the weight on an waybill can be rebutted
with proper evidence. That applies to all _prima facie_ evidence and reflects
the essential character of _prima facie_ evidence. The question here is not
whether the _prima facie_ evidence can be rebutted, but whether it is .

16\. The defendant accepts that the consignment was in a pallet consisting of
9 cartons holding 1,000 transceivers. The number of packages could be taken to
be 1, 9 and arguably 1,000 if the transceivers were packed in individual
boxes. When it was stated as 1 in the waybill, it was a proper description. If
it was stated as 9, that would also be proper, but it did not happen. The
defendant is now obliged by Article 11(2) to acknowledge that the number of
packages was correctly stated as 1.

Unjust benefit to the plaintiff

_

17\. Counsel for the defendant placed considerable reliance on the argument
that it is impermissible and unjust to use the full weight of a consignment in
quantifying the compensation when only a part of the consignment is lost.

18\. This argument arises from a fallacy. Article 22(2) sets the limit to the
compensation payable. It says that for lost, damaged or delayed cargo, the
compensation shall not exceed 250 francs per kilogramme of the package or
packages concerned. It does not fix the compensation at 250 francs per
kilogramme of the package or packages lost, damaged or delayed.

19\. Article 22 does not enable a consignee to recover more than its loss. If
a consignee suffered a loss of 1,000 francs as a result of the loss, damage or
delay of its goods in a consignment of 50 kilogrammes, it cannot recover
12,500 francs. The most it can recover is 1,000 francs, and less if the
compensation is reduced by limitation. This is evident in the present case.
The value of the lost transceivers is US$74,360. The plaintiff limits its
claim to $7,635.32, while the defendant contends that it should be limited to
$2,974.80. The defendant may argue that the plaintiffs claim is subject to a
lower limitation (if the number of packages is taken as 9), but it is
overstating the case to complain that the claim would result in an unjust
benefit to the plaintiff.

20\. While dealing with this complaint, it should also be noted that the
weight of consignment lost, damaged or delayed is not used in the computation
under Article 22(2)(b) which provides for "the total weight of the package or
packages concerned" to be taken into consideration. Where a package is
partially lost, damaged or delayed, the total weight of that package is taken
into account. If that is unjust, it arises from Article 22(2)(b) itself.

21\. Counsel for the defendant also argued that the

> Plaintiffs claim is only for part of the cargo. (T)hey proceeded under
> Article 22(2)(b). If the Plaintiffs claim is for the whole of the cargo,
> they would have proceeded under Article 22(2)(a). It is submitted that they
> recognise there is a difference between losing the whole cargo and part of
> the cargo and the 2 situations must be treated differently.

22\. I do not think that it is a correct reading of Article 22(2) that sub-
article (2)(a) applies to claims for total loss and sub-article (2)(b) applies
to claims for partial loss. On my reading, sub-article (2)(a) sets the
monetary limit by weight to claims for total as well as partial loss, damage
or delay. Sub-article (2)(b) sets out the basis on which monetary limit is to
be computed. It states that for partial damage, loss or delay, the total
weight of the package concerned is taken into account, but it does not refer
to claims arising from total loss, damage or delay in which the total weight
of the package must apply. Put another way, there is a need to refer to claims
for partial loss, damage or delay to remove any doubt whether the partial or
full weight should apply, but there is no need to refer to total loss, damage
or delay where there is no uncertainty over that. Like sub-article 2(a), it
applies to total and partial loss, damage or delay.

23\. Counsel for the defendant also cited _Bland v British Airways Board_
[1981] 1 Ll LR 289 where Lord Denning in discussing the convention held at
page 290

> Article 22(2)(a) covers the case when the _whole_ of a persons baggage is
> lost. I need not deal with that. But art.22(2)(b) covers the case when only
> _part_ of the baggage is lost. That article says:
>

>> In the case of loss, damage or delay of _part_ of registered baggage the
amounts to which the carriers liability is limited shall be only the total
weight of the package or packages concerned. (Emphasis supplied)

>
> _
>
> So it depends on the weight of the "package concerned". Compensation depends
> on the number of kilogrammes you have lost.
>
> _ (Emphasis added)

24\. I humbly repeat my views on the application of Article 22(2). In any
event, the effect is the same. As the judge pointed out, the limitation to the
carriers liability (and the consignees entitlement) is set by reference to the
weight of the package concerned (not the weight of the lost, damaged or
delayed part of the package) whereas the compensation is measured by the
weight of the lost, damaged or delayed part thereof. This applies equally to
claims for total and partial loss.

25\. The plaintiffs full loss is US$74,360. Its claim under Article 22(2) is
for $7,635.32. The plaintiffs claim was properly made on the basis that the
consignment was in one package. There is no unjust benefit in the sense that
the compensation sought exceeds the loss incurred. The plaintiffs appeal was
allowed for these reasons.
