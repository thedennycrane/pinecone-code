**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

_

SUMMONS-IN-CHAMBERS 6252 OF 1999

_

1 In Summons-in-Chambers 6252 of 1999, the Defendants applied for the
following orders:

> "1. That the proceedings in this action be stayed until after the
> determination of the Defendants’ action, General role number 98081572 in the
> Commercial Court of Paris between Comwealth Investments & Trading Pte Ltd,
> Madam Shih Shia Wah against Mr Luis Chang and Mrs Chang;
>
> 2\. (i) Alternatively that the Plaintiff do within twenty-one (21) days from
> the date of the order to be made hereon, furnish security for the
> Defendants’ costs up to setting down in the sum of $50,000.00;
>
> (ii) That in default thereof, the Plaintiff’s claim herein be dismissed with
> costs;
>
> (iii) That in the meantime all further proceedings be stayed;
>
> 3\. That the costs of this application be paid by the Plaintiff to the
> Defendants.
>
> 4\. Such further and/or other reliefs that the Court deems fit and proper."

2 The learned Assistant Registrar heard the application and ordered that
prayer 1 be dismissed. She also ordered the Plaintiff to furnish security for
costs for $35,000 by 10 December 1999 (i.e. within 21 days of the date of the
order), made no order in respect of prayer 2 (ii) and granted the order sought
in prayer 2 (iii). She further ordered costs for the application fixed at $300
to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendants and granted liberty to apply for
further security.

_

REGISTRAR’S APPEAL 499 OF 1999

_

3 The Defendants appealed to a Judge in Chambers against the dismissal of
prayer 1 of the above application. I allowed the appeal, granted an order in
terms of the said prayer 1 and made no order on the other prayers. I also
ordered costs fixed at $1,000 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendants in
respect of the appeal, leaving the order of costs made by the learned
Assistant Registrar to stand. I further directed that should the French Court
decline jurisdiction, the Plaintiff would have the liberty to restore this
action here.

THE DEFENCE

5 The Defendants filed their Defence after having been served a 48-hour notice
to do so. In response to the Plaintiff’s Claim, the Defendants averred the
following additional express terms of the contract dated 19 December 1997:

> (1) if, within one year from the date of the contract, the Defendants were
> unable to get back their rights and interests, the Plaintiff was to return
> the US$550,000 (without interest) within three months; and
>
> (2) both parties would abide by the written agreement which was to take
> effect upon signing.

6 It was further pleaded as an implied term that the Plaintiff would "make
regular report to the Defendants of the progress and status of his work or
otherwise as and when requested by the Defendants".

7 The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff was in repudiatory breach by
failing to comply with the above implied term. On or about 27 April 1998, the
Defendants accepted the repudiatory breaches and demanded the return of the
US$550,000. The Defendants denied any discussion or agreement on the
requirement of a Power of Attorney as alleged in the Claim.

8 The Plaintiff by his fax dated 14 May 1998 to the Defendants’ lawyers in
Paris admitted that he had not started any work. The Defendants then commenced
legal proceedings against the Plaintiff in Paris for the return of the
US$550,000.

__

THE DEFENDANTS’ CASE

9 Shih Shia Wah, a director and shareholder of the Defendants, stated that the
action in Paris arose out of the same agreement as the one in the present
action. The US$550,000 was converted to French Francs and remitted to the
Plaintiff and his wife’s joint-account in Paris. The Plaintiff did not intend
to assist the Defendants and had used the said money instead to purchase a
property in Paris.

10 On 30 September 1998, a writ was issued in the Paris Commercial Court for
the return of the US$550,000. The Plaintiff’s accounts at BNP and at Banque
San Paolo in Paris were garnished. On 5 November 1998, the High Court in Paris
granted a provisional mortgage against the Plaintiff’s property in Paris and
that was registered on 18 November 1998. I was told that such a mortgage
amounted to a Mareva Injunction against the property.

11 The Plaintiff had until 29 September 1999 (an extended date) to file his
Defence in the Paris action but did not do so. The case was therefore
adjourned to 10 November 1999. The proceedings in Paris were close to
conclusion.

12 The Plaintiff had actually commenced an earlier action here in Suit No.
2142 of 1998 on 24 November 1998. That also concerned the same agreement. It
was commenced one day before the Plaintiff was to have filed his pleading in
the Paris action and one week after the registration of the provisional
mortgage. Judgment in default of appearance was entered by the Plaintiff
against the Defendants in the earlier suit but that was subsequently set aside
on 12 March 1999 because of defective service.

13 The Plaintiff was ordered to re-serve the writ but did not do so. A notice
under O. 12 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court was taken out by the Defendants to
require the Plaintiff to serve the writ within 14 days or discontinue the
action. No action was taken and the Defendants accordingly applied to strike
out the action.

14 On 7 April 1999, the Court here ordered the Plaintiff to re-serve the writ
by 4 pm on 9 April 1999 failing which the action be dismissed. Costs of $350
were ordered against the Plaintiff. Due to the continued inaction on the part
of the Plaintiff, Suit No. 2142 of 1998 was finally dismissed on 13 April
1999.

15 On 3 May 1999, the present action was commenced and, until the Statement of
Claim was amended in September 1999, the claim was the same as that in the
earlier Singapore action. The writ in the latter action was served on the
Defendants only after a similar notice under O. 12 r 8(1) of the Rules of
Court had been issued.

16 The Plaintiff had been avoiding the merits of the French action by abusing
the procedure there to delay the action and by juxtaposing the two Singapore
actions. He had also tried to sell the Paris property inspite of the
provisional mortgage.

_

THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE

_

17 The Plaintiff, who stated his present address as being in Las Vegas, USA,
but who affirmed his affidavit on 4 November 1999 before a Notary Public in
China, said that he had instructed his lawyers in France to challenge the
jurisdiction of the French Court on the ground that Singapore was the proper
forum for the trial. The French Court has not decided this question. The
Plaintiff’s French lawyers have advised that the French Court did not have the
jurisdiction to try this matter as it concerned an agreement signed in
Singapore in the Chinese language for work to be performed in China.

18 The merits of the French action have also not been decided and that action
has progressed no further than the present one here. The French lawyers have
also advised that a Singapore judgment could, under certain conditions, be
recognised and enforced in France.

19 Most of the relevant documents in this case were in the Chinese language.
Under French law, the law of the contract was Singapore law. French law should
not be applied as the contract was made in Singapore, the Defendants were
Singaporean and the entire contract was to be performed in China. The contract
was also in Chinese. When the contract was entered into, French law was not
contemplated at all. Even if Chinese law was the proper law, the Singapore
Court would be in a better position than the French Court to apply such law.

20 The Plaintiff resided presently in the USA while the Defendants were a
Singapore company and Shih Shia Wah also resided here. Most, if not at all, of
the witnesses would be from China and most of the evidence would relate to
events there.

21 The money paid to the Plaintiff did not have to be applied for any
particular purpose.

22 He was prepared to furnish security for $30,000 up to the stage of setting
down and had made payment of all the costs ordered against him. He was serious
about proceeding in Singapore.

_

THE DECISION OF THE COURT

_

23 Paragraph 9 of the First Schedule in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
confers on the High Court:

> "Power to dismiss or stay proceedings where the matter in question in res
> judicata between the parties, or where by reason of multiplicity of
> proceedings in any court or courts or by reason of a court in Singapore not
> being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought not to be continued."

24 In _The Hooghly Mills Co Ltd v Seltron Pte Ltd_ [1995] 1 SLR 773, the
Plaintiffs were a company incorporated in India and carrying on business in
Calcutta while the Defendants were a company incorporated in Singapore. The
Plaintiffs agreed to sell the Defendants two million hessian sugar bags with
payment to be made by way of a bill of exchange drawn on the Defendants
payable to the Vysya Bank Ltd. The bill was dishonoured by non-payment when
presented. The Defendants contended that the goods delivered did not conform
to specifications and were unmerchantable and commenced a suit in India in
June 1993 against the Plaintiffs and Vysya Bank Ltd. The writ in that action
was not served on the Plaintiffs until 10 January 1994. On 16 October 1993,
the Plaintiffs commenced their action in Singapore. The Defendants did not
file a Defence to the Singapore action but applied instead to stay the action
on the grounds that Indian law was the governing law of the transaction, that
the transaction took place in India and the witnesses were there and that
there was _lis alibi pendens_.

25 The Assistant Registrar there ordered a stay of the Singapore action with
liberty to apply to lift the stay should the Indian action be discontinued or
stayed. The Plaintiffs appealed. In allowing the appeal , Judith Prakash JC
made the following observations at page 780 of the report:

"(3) Lis alibi pendens

> The approach which the court should take when one of the grounds supporting
> an application for stay is that there is a pending action involving the same
> parties and the same issues in a foreign forum was set out by Lord Goff in
> _de Dampierre v de Dampierre_ at pp 107-108 in the following words:
>
> "Under the principle of forum non conveniens now applicable in England as
> well as in Scotland, the court may exercise its discretion under its
> inherent jurisdiction to grant a stay where ‘it is satisfied that there is
> some other tribunal, having competent jurisdiction, in which the case may be
> tried more suitably for the interests of the parties and for the ends of
> justice’: see _Sim v Robinow_ [1892] 19 R (Ct of Sess) 665, 668, per Lord
> Kinnear. The effect is that the court in this country looks first to see
> what factors there are which connect the case with another forum. If, on the
> basis of that inquiry, the court concludes that there is another available
> forum which, prima facie, is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the
> action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by
> reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be
> granted: see the _Spiliada_ case [1987] AC 460, 475-478. The same principle
> is applicable whether or not there are other relevant proceedings already
> pending in the alternative forum: see _The Abidin Daver_ [1984] AC 398, 411,
> per Lord Diplock. However, the existence of such proceedings may, depending
> on the circumstances, be relevant to the inquiry. Sometimes they may be of
> no relevance at all, for example, if one party has commenced the proceedings
> for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of a competent jurisdiction,
> or the proceedings had not passed beyond the stage of the initiating
> process. But if for example, genuine proceedings had been started and have
> not merely been started but have developed to the stage where they have had
> some impact upon the dispute between the parties, especially if such impact
> is likely to have a continuing effect, then this may be a relevant factor to
> be taken into account when the foreign jurisdiction provides the appropriate
> forum for the resolution of the dispute between the parties.""

26 On the facts, the learned Judge said (at page 781):

> "It was true that the plaintiffs themselves had not taken any further steps
> in the Indian proceedings in that they had not filed any defence to the
> action. It was argued that the Indian proceedings would not have been halted
> at the initial stage if the plaintiffs had taken active role in defending
> the claim. In my view, however, the plaintiffs were not to be penalised for
> having concentrated their efforts on removing the restraining order since
> their view of the matter was that the action should proceed in Singapore
> rather than in India.
>
> …
>
> When I considered all the circumstances relating to the Indian proceedings
> and the steps taken by the defendants therein, I agreed with the plaintiffs’
> submission that the Indian action was defensive in nature and that the
> course of events indicated that there was no true desire on the part of the
> defendants to litigate in India. In this regard, I noted that the
> Defendants’ claim as formulated in the Indian courts substantially exceeds
> the plaintiffs’ claim for the price on the goods. One would have expected a
> party with a claim for such a significant amount to have vehemently pursued
> it in the Indian court instead of sitting on the matter for so long.
> Further, while to say so might come perilously close to judicial chauvinism
> (to use Lord Diplock’s phrase in _The Abidin Daver_), I found it difficult
> to believe that a Singaporean party would sincerely consider that its claim
> would be better dealt with in a foreign court even though the foreign party
> concerned was willing to litigate in Singapore. I had the clear impression
> that the defendants had ulterior motives in wanting to shift this litigation
> from Singapore.
>
> Thus, whilst the court must always be concerned to try and avoid the
> complications that arise when there are concurrent proceedings in different
> jurisdictions involving the same parties and similar issues, in this
> particular case, I was not convinced that the existence of the Indian
> proceedings was a positive factor making the Indian court the more
> appropriate court to adjudicate the dispute."

27 The learned Judge therefore concluded that the Defendants there had not
discharged the burden on them to show that the Indian Court was clearly and
distinctly the appropriate court for resolving the dispute. The Defendants’
subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

28 In a more recent decision, _Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte
Ltd_ [1998] 1 SLR 253, the Court of Appeal pronounced on the principles
governing an application to stay proceedings. This pronouncement appears
compendiously in the headnotes as the first holding as follows:

> "The principles governing an application to stay proceedings were clear and
> established. If a court concluded that there was some other available forum
> which prima facie was clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action,
> it would ordinarily grant a stay unless there were circumstances by reason
> of which justice required that a stay should nevertheless not be granted.
> However, the mere fact that a plaintiff had such a legitimate advantage for
> proceeding in Singapore was not decisive and the interests of all the
> parties and the ends of justice had to be taken into consideration."

29 The contractual document in the present case was nothing more than a one-
page handwritten note in the Chinese language (save for the names of the
parties, the date and the currency) on paper provided by the Pan Pacific Hotel
of Singapore. The terms therein appear sufficiently from the pleadings and
they should pose little difficulty to any Court studying them. No choice of
law or of jurisdiction was stated. The applicable law would either be
Singapore law or Chinese law. If it is Singapore law, obviously it would be
ideal that the matter be dealt with in this jurisdiction. If it is Chinese
law, this issue becomes a neutral one in that it would not matter whether the
action is tried in Singapore or in Paris. There is no ground whatsoever to
presume that either jurisdiction would be better placed than the other to deal
with Chinese law.

30 The Defendants are based in Singapore and so is the Defendants’ principal
witness, Shih Shia Wah. However, she has unequivocally elected to travel to
Paris for the action to be tried there. The Plaintiff, holding a Honduran
passport, with his constantly changing address, appears to be a globetrotter
and therefore the forum for trial would be quite immaterial to him. However,
he has not denied that his family is still in Paris. His constant change of
residence from one country to another appears suspicious and was probably done
to remove a connecting factor with the French jurisdiction.

31 He also claimed that practically all his witnesses would come from China
and there would be less difficulty and saving of costs if the action was tried
here as Chinese is one of the official languages here and the witnesses would
have to travel less and within the same time zone. I am not persuaded that
Paris would not be able to provide the same interpretation facilities as are
available in Singapore. The longer travel time and the different time zones
are really relatively minor considerations.

32 The denominated currency in the contract did not swing the balance one way
or the other. Indeed, the US dollar was converted into French Franc and
remitted to the joint-account of the Plaintiff and his wife in Paris and it
was not denied that the money was used to purchase the property in question.

33 The Plaintiff also claimed that he had a personal or juridical advantage in
proceeding here in that he would be able to realize the fruits of his judgment
here if successful. If the matter was litigated in Paris and the outcome was
favourable to him, he would not be able to register the French judgment here
in Singapore under our Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. This
is where his sincerity in litigating in Singapore is seriously in question. He
has not explained his strange, lackadaisical attitude in the first Singapore
action. Within three weeks after that action was dismissed for non-
prosecution, he commenced the present suit in which he had to be goaded again
by the Defendants to serve the writ. While he had declared his readiness to
provide security for costs and had been ordered by the Court to so provide, he
had not done so.

34 On the other hand, the Defendants here have shown that they were entirely
serious about proceeding in Paris. They have swiftly taken out applications to
preserve the Plaintiff’s assets and were unable to move significantly further
towards final resolution because of the delays caused by the Plaintiff’s
procedural manoeuvres. Having delivered two punches by way of the garnishee
and provisional mortgage applications, the match would have got underway if
the Plaintiff would only step into the ring.

35 I have no doubt that the Plaintiff was less than serious about proceeding
with his action here and was merely playing one jurisdiction against the
other. This second Singapore action was nothing more than an instrument to
persuade the French Court not to assume jurisdiction over the case and
consequently to lift the provisional mortgage on his Paris property.

36 I was therefore of the view that the Paris action should proceed while the
Singapore action should be stayed. If the French Court should decline
jurisdiction subsequently, the Plaintiff would be at liberty to restore the
present action and proceed to final resolution of the dispute on the merits.
