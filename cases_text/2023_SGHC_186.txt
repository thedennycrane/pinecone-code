Lee Seiu Kin J:

Introduction

1 In this case, the applicant sought to set aside an adjudication
determination and adjudication review determination under the Building and
Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “SOPA”)
on the basis of non-compliance with the provisions of the SOPA and on the
ground of fraud. I allowed the application in part on the ground of fraud and
ordered that the review determination award be reduced by $155,160. The
following are the grounds of my decision.

Facts

The parties

2 JP Nelson Equipment Pte Ltd (“JP Nelson”) is a Singapore-incorporated
company and the employer of a building project, the “Proposed New Erection of
Front Four-Storey with Roof Garden Office, Dormitory and Rear Three Storey
Factory with Office on Lot 0196K MK at 28 Benoi Road, Singapore 629899” (the
“Project”). 1

Background to the dispute

4 On 8 June 2018, JP Nelson awarded Builders Hub a contract for the Project
(the “Contract”). 3

##### Foot Note 3

Seh Yin Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at para 8.

The Contract price was $9,942,280 and the Contract incorporated the Real
Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore Design and Build Conditions of
Contract (Third Ed, October 2010) (the “REDAS Conditions”), among other
documents. 4

5 On 20 May 2022, Builders Hub served Payment Claim No 37 on JP Nelson for the
sum of $2,287,156.69 (including GST) for works carried out from 11 September
2018 to 20 May 2022 (“PC 37”). 5

Subsequently, on 10 June 2022, JP Nelson served its payment response, Interim
Valuation No 37, on Builders Hub for the sum of $329,284.98 (inclusive of GST)
(the “Response Amount”), based on works completed as of 31 May 2022 (the
“Payment Response”). 6

The adjudication application

6 On 24 June 2022, Builders Hub lodged adjudication application SOP/AA 099 of
2022 for PC 37, because it disputed the Response Amount of $329,284.98
(inclusive of GST). Builders Hub claimed for JP Nelson’s “response amount
which [had] not been paid and the difference between its claimed amounts and
[JP Nelson’s] certified amounts for certain items of the variation works” 7

7 On 4 July 2022, JP Nelson lodged its adjudication response. Among other
things, JP Nelson objected to the Adjudication Application on the basis that
it was filed prematurely, in breach of s 13(3)(a) of the SOPA. JP Nelson
argued that Builders Hub should have filed the Adjudication Application
between 7 and 13 July 2022, instead of 24 June 2022. 9

8 On 4 August 2022, the adjudicator (the “Adjudicator”) issued his
determination (the “Adjudication Determination”). The Adjudicator dismissed JP
Nelson’s jurisdictional objection and found that the Adjudication Application
was not filed prematurely. Further the Adjudicator determined that JP Nelson
was liable to pay Builders Hub $847,381.92 (inclusive of GST) (the
“Adjudicated Amount”). 10

The adjudication review application

9 On 11 August 2022, JP Nelson filed an application for the review of the
Adjudication Determination in SOP/ARA 006 of 2022 (the “Adjudication Review
Application”). In the Adjudication Review Application, JP Nelson maintained
its objection that Builders Hub’s Adjudication Application was premature and
should have been rejected. 11

10 Then, on 26 August 2022, JP Nelson terminated Builders Hub’s employment
under the Contract by way of letter, pursuant to cl 30.2 of the REDAS
Conditions, for allegedly committing various breaches of the Contract. 12

11 The adjudicator for the Adjudication Review Application (“Review
Adjudicator”) issued his determination on 12 September 2022 (the “Adjudication
Review Determination”). Inter alia, the Review Adjudicator upheld the
Adjudicator’s determination that the Adjudication Application was not
prematurely lodged. 14

The Review Adjudicator also reduced the review adjudicated amount payable by
JP Nelson to Builders Hub by $329,284.98 from the Adjudicated Amount of
$847,381.92 (inclusive of GST) to the final adjusted sum of $518,096.94
(inclusive of GST) (the “Review Adjudicated Amount”). This was because JP
Nelson had already paid the sum of $329,284.98 to Builders Hub on 1 July 2022,
but the sum was nonetheless included in the Adjudication Determination so as
to amount to a patent error. 15

12 On 29 September 2022, JP Nelson filed the present application in HC/OA
616/2022 ("OA 616”) to set aside (a) the Adjudication Review Determination;
and (b) the Adjudication Determination. 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

HC/OA 616/2022 filed 29 September 2022.

13 Following the filing of OA 616, JP Nelson discovered the alleged fraud
committed by Builders Hub. As I will elaborate below, this alleged fraud
formed one of the key pillars of JP Nelson’s case in the present setting aside
application.

Alleged fraud by Builders Hub

(1) Discovery of the alleged fraud

14 Cappitech Engineering Pte Ltd (“Cappitech”) was a subcontractor of Builders
Hub and had supplied air-conditioning systems for the Project before Builders
Hub stopped work on the Project. 17

##### Foot Note 17

Teong Boo Bing’s affidavit dated 21 November 2022 at para 16.

15 On 15 November 2022, Mr Teong Boo Bing (“Mr Teong”), an employee of Infield
Projects Pte Ltd (“Infield”) which was JP Nelson’s representative for the
Project, 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

Teong Boo Bing’s affidavit dated 21 November 2022 at paras 10 and 12.

approached Cappitech to ascertain whether Cappitech was prepared to continue
supplying air-conditioning systems for the Project after JP Nelson appointed a
new main contractor following Builders Hub’s termination. During a
conversation with an employee of Cappitech, Mr Teong was informed that
Cappitech had only received $6,000 from Builders Hub for the Project. This
surprised Mr Teong, as Builders Hub had informed him that it had paid
Cappitech at least $242,842.06 for the supply of air-conditioning equipment
and provided documentary evidence to support this statement. 19

##### Foot Note 19

Teong Boo Bing’s affidavit dated 21 November 2022 at para 16.

16 On the same day, by way of email, Mr Teong sought Cappitech’s confirmation
of: (a) whether Cappitech had received a Builders Hub cheque for $242,842.06;
and (b) whether Cappitech had issued four documents to Builders Hub (which
will be elaborated below at [18]). Cappitech replied by way of an email dated
16 November 2022, and confirmed that it had never issued the four documents to
Builders Hub, nor had it received any cheque (“Cappitech’s 16 November
Email”). 20

17 On 16 November 2022, Builders Hub responded to Cappitech’s 16 November
Email, which I reproduce here: 21

##### Foot Note 21

Teong Boo Bing’s affidavit dated 21 November 2022 at paras 25–26.

Dear Ms Evelyn Chen

Refer to your email below is correct and further to our conversation that we
had not claimed and they also did not pay us too. It is our side that my staff
had mixed up with other projects and lumped all the labour aircon equipments
[sic] with piping work and installation with fresh air ductwork together with
your aircon equipments [sic] bill and never separated them.

Nevertheless, the total tender contract amount is still the same.

As for the progress approval claim from the owner QS, we confirm they have not
paid for any of the aircon equipments [sic] at all and attached the JP nelson
QS last report progress claim for your reference which highlights in yellow.

We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.

In its email, Builders Hub agreed that Cappitech’s version of events was
correct.

(2) The Five Cappitech Documents

18 Between 22 November 2021 and 8 March 2022, JP Nelson received the five
allegedly false documents from Builders Hub (collectively, the “Five Cappitech

The parties’ cases

JP Nelson’s case

21 JP Nelson contended that the Adjudication Determination and Adjudication
Review Determination (“Adjudication Determinations”) should be set aside on
the following grounds.

The timeliness of the Adjudication Application

22 First, JP Nelson submitted that the Adjudication Application was served
prematurely in breach of s 13(3)(a) of the SOPA and should have been rejected
on this basis. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

Seh Yin Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at paras 26–31.

JP Nelson disagreed with the findings of both the Adjudicator and Review
Adjudicator (collectively, the “Adjudicators”): (a) that there was an
agreement to vary the payment claim’s contractual date of service; 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

JP Nelson’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at para 2.1; Seh Yin
Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at paras 32–41.

and (b) that JP Nelson was estopped from relying on cl 22.1.1 and cl 22.1.4 of
the REDAS Conditions because JP Nelson did not make any representations
contrary to an email from Builders Hub implying that the contractual date of
service had been varied. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

JP Nelson’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at para 2.2; Seh Yin
Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at paras 44–50.

The fraud ground

23 Second, JP Nelson contended that the Adjudication Determinations were
tainted by fraud. JP Nelson averred that Builders Hub had fraudulently created
the Five Cappitech Documents and delivered them to JP Nelson in order to
deceive JP Nelson into making a total downpayment of $155,160 to Builders Hub
(the “Downpayment”). This sum amounted to 45% of the contract price (being
$344,800) between JP Nelson and Builders Hub for air-conditioning systems. 36

##### Foot Note 36

×

JP Nelson’s supplemental submissions dated 26 January 2023 at paras 11–16.

JP Nelson relied on the two-step process set out by the Court of Appeal in
Facade Solution Pte Ltd v Mero Asia Pacific Pte Ltd [2020] 2 SLR 1125 (“Facade
Solution”) to argue that the Adjudication Determinations should be set aside.
37

##### Foot Note 37

×

JP Nelson’s supplemental submissions dated 26 January 2023 at paras 33–73.

Builders Hubs’ case

24 Builders Hub submitted that the Adjudication Determinations should not be
set aside.

The timeliness of the Adjudication Application

25 Builders Hub had three primary arguments. Firstly, Builders Hub averred
that JP Nelson was seeking to review the merits of the Adjudicators’
decisions, which was outside the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. This was
because JP Nelson’s setting aside application was centred on the issue of
whether the Adjudication Application lodged on 24 June 2022 was premature,
which had been fully canvassed in the Adjudication Determinations. 38

##### Foot Note 38

×

Lawrence Lee’s affidavit dated 26 October 2022 at paras 28–36; Builders Hub’s
written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at paras 43–64.

Secondly, Builders Hub submitted that JP Nelson only filed the present setting
aside application after undue delay and not within a reasonable time. 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

Lawrence Lee’s affidavit dated 26 October 2022 at paras 20–27; Builders Hub’s
written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at paras 13–42.

Thirdly, Builders Hub argued that in any event, the Adjudicators had correctly
found that the Adjudication Application was not prematurely filed. Builders
Hub also argued that pursuant to s 11(1)(a) of the SOPA, even if the payment
claim submission date was not varied by parties, the Adjudication Application
was still lodged on time. 40

##### Foot Note 40

×

Lawrence Lee’s affidavit dated 26 October 2022 at paras 37–54; Builders Hub’s
written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at paras 65–111.

The fraud ground

26 Builders Hub countered that JP Nelson did not satisfy the requirements of
the two-stage Facade Solution test. First, the Adjudicators did not rely on
the facts of the fraud in making their respective determinations. The Five
Cappitech Documents were not even submitted as part of the adjudication bundle
of documents. 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

Builders Hub’s supplemental submissions dated 26 January 2023 at paras 9–12.

Further, it was completely without merit for JP Nelson to argue that the
Adjudicators relied on the facts of the fraud because the Adjudicators relied
on Interim Valuation No 37, which certified a sum inclusive of the Downpayment
induced by fraud. 42

##### Foot Note 42

×

Builders Hub’s supplemental submissions dated 26 January 2023 at paras 14–16.

27 Second, JP Nelson failed to satisfy the second step of the test as the
facts in question were not material to the issuance of the Adjudication
Determinations. The Five Cappitech Documents were not material because they
related only to the main contract works and not to any part of the claims for
variation works (as the only disputed claims) on which the Adjudication
Determinations were based. Further, the Response Amount, which JP Nelson
claimed was tainted by fraud, was paid before the Adjudication Determination
was issued. Additionally, JP Nelson’s liability to Builders Hub was reduced by
the Response Amount in the Adjudication Review Determination to reflect the
payment made by JP Nelson. Therefore, no part of the amount eventually awarded
to Builders Hub by the Adjudicators contained the sum of $329,284.98. 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

Builders Hub’s supplemental submissions dated 26 January 2023 at paras 17–23.

28 In any event, Builders Hub also argued that the costs for the air-
conditioning systems under Item H1a of the original contract works were not
claimed in PC 37. In PC 37, Builders Hub claimed 5% of the contract sum under
Item H1a of Bill No 6. This claim was solely based on work done for the
completion of piping, ducting and cable work for the air-conditioning system.
Therefore, this excluded the Downpayment monies that were tainted by fraud. 44

##### Foot Note 44

Builders Hub’s supplemental submissions dated 26 January 2023 at paras 24–29.

Orders sought by the applicant

29 Based on its claims, JP Nelson sought the following orders: 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

HC/OA 616/2022 filed 29 September 2022; JP Nelson’s supplemental submissions
dated 26 January 2023 at para 74.

(a) That the Court set aside: (a) the Adjudication Review Determination dated
12 September 2002 made in SOP/ARA 006 of 2022; and (b) the Adjudication
Determination dated 4 August 2022 made in SOP/AA 099 of 2022.

(b) That Builders Hub pay JP Nelson the sum of $518,096.94 (being the Review
Adjudicated Amount).

(c) That Builders Hub pay the costs of and incidental to OA 616 to JP Nelson
on an indemnity basis.

(d) Such further order(s) that the Court deems just.

Issues to be determined

30 A preliminary issue to JP Nelson’s first ground was whether the court had
jurisdiction to determine the timeliness of the Adjudication Application,
notwithstanding that the issue had been canvassed in the Adjudications.

31 Assuming that the preliminary issue was answered in the affirmative, the
issue then was whether the Adjudication Application had been lodged
prematurely.

32 In terms of the second ground, the question was whether the Adjudication
Determinations should be set aside because they were tainted by fraud.

Issue 1: The timeliness of the Adjudication Application

The law

33 The fundamental rule underlying the court’s role in hearing and determining
an application to set aside an adjudication determination is that the court
should not review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision: Lee Wee Lick
Terence (alias Li Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt
Construction Engineering) and another appeal [2013] 1 SLR 401 (“Chua Say Eng”)
at [66]. A non-exhaustive list of grounds for the court to set aside an
adjudication determination is set out in s 27(6) of the SOPA. Section 27(6)(d)
of the SOPA provides that a party to an adjudication may commence proceedings
to set aside an adjudication determination where the adjudication application
or the adjudication review application was not made in accordance with the
provisions of the SOPA.

34 In this case, the relevant provisions in the SOPA relate to the timelines
for the adjudication process. This was well summarised by Quentin Loh J (as he
then was) in Newcon Builders Pte Ltd v Sino New Steel Pte Ltd [2015] SGHC 226
(“Newcon Builders”) at [22]:

(a) A payment claim is to be served at such time as specified in the contract
or determined in accordance with the terms of the contract, or where the
contract does not contain such provision, by the last day of each month
following the month in which the contract is made: see s 10(2) of the [SOPA]
read with reg 5(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of
Payment Regulations (Cap 30B, Rg 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Regulations) [sic].

(b) A payment response shall be provided to the claimant by the date as
specified in or determined in accordance with the terms of the contract, or
within 21 days after the payment claim is served, whichever is the earlier, or
where the construction contract does not contain such provision, within 7 days
after the payment claim is served: see s 11(1) of the [SOPA].

(c) The claimant is entitled to make an adjudication application in relation
to the payment claim if, by the end of the dispute settlement period (ie, the

payment response is required to be provided), the dispute is not settled or

Preliminary objection

35 I first addressed a preliminary objection by Builders Hub. Builders Hub
submitted that JP Nelson was seeking an examination of the merits of the
Adjudication Determinations. 46

Builders Hub’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at paras 43–44.

In the adjudication proceedings and review adjudication proceedings, JP Nelson
had already extensively argued that the adjudication application was lodged
prematurely, and both Adjudicators rejected this argument. 47

Once again, in OA 616, JP Nelson was canvassing the same argument. Here, JP
Nelson’s case was predicated on its disagreement with a finding of fact made
by the Adjudicators – that parties had varied the contractual date for
submitting payment claims. 48

##### Foot Note 48

Builders Hub’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at para 61.

If the court were to consider whether the Adjudication Application was made
prematurely, and to subsequently make a finding on whether parties had varied
the contractual date for submitting payment claims, that would amount to
reviewing the merits of the Adjudication Determinations. This would fall
outside the court’s supervisory jurisdiction.

36 In my view, it was entirely within the court’s supervisory jurisdiction to
determine whether Builders Hub had lodged the Adjudication Application
prematurely. The timeliness of the Adjudication Application was a question
that determined compliance with s 12(2) and s 13(3)(a) of the SOPA, and
therefore went to the jurisdiction of the Adjudicator. I agreed with Builders
Hub that the Adjudicators were fully entitled to make a finding in relation to
the Adjudicator’s jurisdiction, but the court was not bound by this finding.
These are for the reasons that I explain below.

37 The Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (Amendment) Act
2018 (Act 47 of 2018), which took effect on 15 December 2019, introduced a
non-exhaustive list of grounds for setting aside an adjudication determination
under s 27(6) of the SOPA. Section 27(6)(d) of the SOPA specifically provides
that a party can commence court proceedings where the adjudication application
was not made in accordance with the SOPA. In this case, if the Adjudication
Application was lodged prematurely, it would be non-compliant with ss 12(2)
and 13(3)(a) of the SOPA: see Newcon Builders at [30]. Section 13(3)(a)
prescribes that an adjudication application must be made within seven days
“after the entitlement … first arises” [emphasis added]. The wording of the
statute makes clear that the entitlement to make an adjudication application
must have first arisen. This entitlement is governed by s 12(2) of the SOPA,
which, inter alia, provides that where the claimant disputes a payment
response by the respondent, and the dispute is not settled by the end of the
dispute settlement period, the claimant is entitled to make an adjudication
application under s 13 of the SOPA. Therefore, if the Adjudication Application
was made before Builders Hub’s entitlement to do so arose, it was not a valid
adjudication application.

38 Prior to the enactment of s 27(6)(d) of the SOPA, the Court of Appeal had
already made clear in Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte
Ltd [2015] 1 SLR 797 at [49] that a court in a setting aside application is
concerned with:

… the propriety of the [adjudication determination] itself (that is to say,
with issues relating to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator, including non-
compliance with the SOPA, and procedural propriety in the adjudication,
including whether there was a breach of natural justice).

[emphasis added]

39 I recognised that on a plain reading of s 27(6)(d) of the SOPA, the
provision could conceivably cover any breach of the Act regardless of the
materiality of the breach. This contrasted with the seemingly narrower view
taken in the case law prior to its enactment. The Court of Appeal in Chua Say
Eng observed that an adjudication determination could be set aside if:

… the claimant, in the course of making an adjudication application, had not
complied with one (or more) of the provisions under the Act which was so
important that it was the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of
the provision should be invalid …

[emphasis added]

40 However, I made no finding on whether Parliament intended to invalidate all
adjudication and review applications that were “not made in accordance” with
the provisions of the SOPA. In the case of Newcon Builders, which was decided
before the enactment of s 27(6)(d) of the SOPA, Loh J found that an
adjudication application made before the expiry of the dispute settlement
period was invalid. Further, Loh J held that the court was entitled, as part
of its supervisory jurisdiction, to set aside an adjudication determination
which had been rendered pursuant to a premature adjudication application in
breach of ss 12(2) and 13(3)(a) of the SOPA (Newcon Builders at [45]). Loh J
provided extensive reasoning for this conclusion (at [23]–[45] of Newcon
Builders), with which I respectfully agree. In my judgment, these arguments
applied with even greater force in this case, where the Adjudication
Application was alleged to be made even earlier than in Newcon Builders, ie,
before the dispute settlement period arose.

41 In my judgment, it made no difference that the Adjudicators had determined
the validity of the Adjudication Application. In my earlier decision of
Lendlease Singapore Pte Ltd v M & S Management & Contracts Services Pte Ltd
[2019] SGHC 139 (“Lendlease”), I considered an application to set aside an
adjudication determination on the grounds that the adjudication application
had been lodged by the defendant out of time, in breach of s 13(3)(a) of the
SOPA (Lendlease at [1]). Crucially, this jurisdictional objection had been
canvassed in the adjudication process. The plaintiff had already detailed its
objections that the adjudication application was lodged out of time in the
plaintiff’s adjudication response, and the adjudicator below dismissed the
plaintiff’s objection in the adjudication determination (Lendlease at
[4]–[5]). Nonetheless, I set aside the adjudication application because the
contractual terms clearly showed that the time for lodging the adjudication
application began to run from the date of physical service of the payment, as
opposed to the date stated in the payment claim, which meant that the
application was lodged out of time (Lendlease at [18]–[19]).

42 Builders Hub also relied on the case of Emergent Engineering Pte Ltd v
China Construction Realty Co Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 276 (“Emergent Engineering”)
to support its position that JP Nelson was essentially mounting a backdoor
attempt to review the merits of the Adjudicators’ decisions. 49

##### Foot Note 49

×

Builders Hub’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at paras 57–63.

In my judgment, Builders Hub had misapplied the decision in Emergent
Engineering. In that case, the respondent had sought to set aside the
adjudication determination on the basis that the applicant was not entitled to
serve payment claim 25 (“PC 25”) because the respondent had terminated the
sub-contract (Emergent Engineering at [48]). However, the court in Emergent
Engineering held that there was no genuine question of the adjudicator acting
in excess of his jurisdiction. The respondent in that case did not allege that
any of the requirements for service of payment claims, stipulated under s 10
of the SOPA, were breached. In fact, it was undisputed by parties that PC 25
was compliant with all the payment claim requirements under s 10 of the SOPA.
Therefore, the respondent’s case was not based on s 27(6)(a) of the SOPA,
which provides that a party to an adjudication may commence proceedings to set
aside an adjudication determination on the ground that the payment claim was
not served in accordance with s 10 of the SOPA (Emergent Engineering at [48]).
Instead, it was premised fundamentally on the respondent’s disagreement with
the adjudicator’s finding that the respondent had not validly terminated the
sub-contract. This contrasted with the present case, where the finding of
whether the parties had varied the contractual date for submitting payment
claims has a bearing on s 27(6)(d) of the SOPA.

43 In short, JP Nelson was entitled to seek a review of whether the
Adjudication Application had been lodged prematurely. For completeness, I was
also unconvinced by Builders Hub’s submission that the setting aside
application should be dismissed as OA 616 was not brought within a reasonable
time.

The decision

44 I held that Builders Hub did not lodge the Adjudication Application
prematurely. Therefore, I did not set aside the Adjudicators’ Determinations
on this ground.

45 According to JP Nelson, pursuant to cl 22.1.1 of the REDAS Conditions,
Builders Hub was contractually required to serve its payment claims on the
last day of each month following the month in which the Contract was made: 50

##### Foot Note 50

JP Nelson’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at para 7.

22.1.1. The Contractor shall serve on the Employer with a copy to the
Employer's Representative a Payment Claim on the last day of each month
following the month in which the Contract is made (or otherwise by such time
or on such day as stated in Appendix 1) showing the amount which the
Contractor considers himself to be entitled for that month together with the
relevant supporting documents.

[emphasis added]

As the Contract was entered into on 8 June 2018, and as Appendix 1 did not
stipulate a date, Builders Hub would be required to serve each payment claim
on the eighth of each month. 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

JP Nelson’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at para 8.

Correspondingly, the deadline for serving PC 37 was 8 June 2022.

46 JP Nelson posited that pursuant to cl 22.4 of the REDAS Conditions, it
would then be required to serve the Payment Response within 21 days after PC
37 was served on the Employer, ie, JP Nelson: 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

Seh Yin Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at TBB-1 p 209; JP Nelson’s
written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at para 14.

22.4. The Interim Payment Certificate issued under clause 22.2.1 or the Final
Payment Certificate issued under clause 24.4 shall be deemed the Payment
Response from the Employer to the Contractor under the SOP Act in the event
that the Employer fails to provide any Payment Response to the Contractor
within 21 days after the Payment Claim is served on the Employer by the
Contractor. Where the Employer provides a Payment Response within 21 days
after the date the Payment Claim is served in compliance with the SOP Act, the
Employer's Payment Response shall take precedence over the Interim Payment
Certificate issued under clause 22.2.1 or the Final Payment Certificate issued
under clause 24.4 and shall constitute the Payment Response to the Contractor.

47 However, cl 22.1.4 of the REDAS Conditions stipulated that even if Builders
Hub served its payment claim early, JP Nelson would not be required to issue
its payment response earlier than if Builders Hub had served its payment claim
in accordance with the contractual date in cl 22.1.1: 53

##### Foot Note 53

×

Seh Yin Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at TBB-1 p 209.

22.1.4. In the event that the Contractor serves his Payment Claim earlier than
the time period as provided under clause 22.1.1 above, the Employer's
Representative shall not be required to issue the Interim Payment Certificate
or the Employer to issue the Payment Response earlier than the case if the
Contractor had served his Payment Claim in accordance with clause 22.1.1.

48 Therefore, JP Nelson argued that notwithstanding that Builders Hub served
PC 37 on 20 May 2022, the deemed date of service of PC 37 was 8 June 2022.
Applying cl 22.4 of the REDAS Conditions, JP Nelson contended that the last
day for JP Nelson to serve the Payment Response would then be 29 June 2022. 54

49 According to ss 12(2) and 12(6) of the SOPA, if Builders Hub disputed a
payment response provided by JP Nelson, Builders Hub would only be entitled to
make an adjudication application at the end of the dispute settlement period,
which meant the “7 days after the date on which … the payment response is
required to be provided under section 11(1)”. On the basis that the Payment
Response was required by 29 June 2022, the dispute settlement period was from
30 June 2022 to 6 July 2022. 55

50 I have summarised JP Nelson’s account of Builders Hub’s entitlement to file
the Adjudication Application:

Event| Basis| Date  
---|---|---  
Date of the Contract| | 8 June 2018  
Service of PC 37 by Builders Hub to JP Nelson| | 20 May 2022  
Deemed date of service of PC 37| Clauses 22.1.1 and 22.1.4 of the REDAS
Conditions| 8 June 2022  
Payment Response filed by JP Nelson| | 10 June 2022  
Adjudication Application filed by Builders Hub| | 24 June 2022  
Last date for JP Nelson to serve the Payment Response | Clause 22.4 of the REDAS Conditions| 29 June 2022  
Dispute resolution period| Sections 12(2) and 12(6) of the SOPA| 30 June 2022
to 6 July 2022  
Builders Hub’s entitlement to file the Adjudication Application| Section
13(3)(a) of the SOPA| 7 July 2022 to 13 July 2022  
  
51 Therefore, JP Nelson averred that Builders Hub filed the Adjudication
Application prematurely on 24 June 2022, before it was entitled to do so from
7 July 2022 to 13 July 2022.

52 However, Builders Hub’s case was that the contractual submission date for
payment claims had been varied to the third week of the month, ie, Builders
Hub was required to serve each payment claim between the 15th and 21st of each
month (both dates inclusive). If the Contract was varied, the Adjudication
Application would not be premature.

53 Builders Hub submitted that parties had varied the requirement of
submitting a payment claim on the 8th of each month. The agreement was
allegedly made at a meeting held on 7 October 2020 and attended by
representatives of both parties (“Meeting No 35”). This meeting was apparently
a usual project meeting held every two weeks between the key representatives
of JP Nelson, Builders Hub and JP Nelson’s representative, Infield, for the
Project. 57

Having reviewed all the evidence before me, I held that the Adjudicators came
to the correct decision. The evidence was strong that both parties intended to
vary the contract terms on submission for payment claims.

55 I highlighted the following facts. Firstly, the language of the agreement
recorded in the Minutes was mandatory and not permissive. The Minutes stated
that Builders Hub “shall” submit progress claims on every third week of the
month. It was unsustainable for JP Nelson to argue that at most, the Minutes
suggested that Builders Hub could serve its payment claim on the third week of
each month. 60

##### Foot Note 60

JP Nelson’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at para 35.

Furthermore, it did not make sense for parties to record that Builders Hub was
permitted to serve its payment claim on the third week of each month, because
Builders Hub was clearly already allowed to do so under cl 22.1.1 read with cl
22.1.4 of the REDAS Conditions of the original contract. Therefore, I agreed
with the Adjudicator’s finding that the sentence “was probably intended as … a
direction that delivered a mandatory requirement”. 61

It also bears noting that the Minutes were prepared by JP Nelson’s Project

Item A(1) that “[a]ll parties … agreed that there [was] no amendment to
previous minutes of meeting”. 62

##### Foot Note 63

No objection was raised by JP Nelson.

56 Second, I considered the email sent by Builders Hub to JP Nelson on 18
April 2022 with the subject “28 Benoi Road – Claim No 36” (the “18 April
Email”). In the 18 April Email, Builders Hub informed JP Nelson of the
following: 64

##### Foot Note 64

×

Seh Yin Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at p 1206.

…

Kindly be informed that for this month we will need a little more time to
prepare our claim. We will therefore only be able to submit it on the last day
of the 3rd week based on what you had previously directed in the meetings.
Should we not hear from you otherwise, we will submit our claim accordingly on
21 April 2022.

…

[emphasis added]

57 The 18 April Email was consistent with a finding that there was an earlier
agreement in Meeting No 35 to submit payment claims every third week of the
month. I was unconvinced by JP Nelson’s argument that the 18 April Email was
completely unrelated to PC 37. According to JP Nelson, this was illustrated by
how the subject title stated “Progress Claim no. 36”, not PC 37, and how the
reference to requiring more time to prepare the claim was in relation to “this
month”, as opposed to any other payment claim. 65

##### Foot Note 65

×

JP Nelson’s written submissions dated 16 November 2022 at paras 41–44.

In my view, if there had been no agreement to vary the dates for payment claim
submissions, there was no reason for Builders Hub to inform JP Nelson that
they needed “a little more time to prepare our claim”. This was because, based
on the original contract, Builders Hub would only have had to submit payment
claim 36 by 8 May 2022, ie, it had a period of three weeks from the 18 April
Email to furnish payment claim 36. Furthermore, it was undisputed that JP
Nelson did not respond to the 18 April Email. If JP Nelson disagreed that it
had previously directed that payment claims are to be served on the third week
of the month, it would be more probable for JP Nelson to have replied to the
18 April Email and to have expressed its disagreement.

58 For completeness, Builders Hub’s conduct after the alleged variation of
Contract was a neutral factor. JP Nelson argued that in spite of the alleged
variation, 15 out of the 20 claims served by Builders Hub after Meeting No 35,
ie, payment claims 18 to 37, were not served on the third week of the month.
On the other hand, none of those payment claims were served on the eighth of
the month either. Therefore, I found that the contractual terms on service of
payment claims had been varied by parties, and the Adjudication Application
was not premature.

59 In the alternative, Builders Hub averred that JP Nelson was estopped from
insisting that PC 37 was required to be submitted on the 8th day of each
month. JP Nelson’s failure to respond to the 18 April Email and failure to
object that there was an agreement amounted to a representation that Builders
Hub was to submit its payment claims on the third week of the month.

60 The Adjudicator found that even if parties had not agreed to vary the
Contract: 66

##### Foot Note 66

×

Seh Yin Yoke’s affidavit dated 29 September 2022 at p 80.

a clear representation had been made by the Respondent to the Claimant to
submit its payment claims within a certain time period at the said meeting.
The Claimant, as can be seen from its email of 18 April 2022, was evidently
under the impression that this direction had to be complied with and had
indicated it would submit it on the 21st of April 2022 if it did not hear from
the Respondent otherwise. It is quite indisputable that such a direction was
given. If the Respondent stayed silent when a reply was clearly awaited if
what was asserted in the said email was incorrect, it is inequitable for and
the Respondent should be estopped now to make the assertion that it is now
making.

61 I had no reason to disagree with this finding. In its submissions, JP
Nelson’s disagreement was premised on its claim that the 18 April Email was
confined to payment claim 36, 67

which I found to be inaccurate. Therefore, I found that in the alternative, JP
Nelson was estopped from insisting that PC 37 was required to be submitted on
the eighth day of the month. On this basis, the Adjudication Application was
not lodged prematurely.

Issue 2: Fraud

The Law

62 Section 27(6)(h) of the SOPA provides that a party to an adjudication may
commence proceedings to set aside an adjudication determination where the
making of the adjudication determination was induced or affected by fraud or
corruption.

63 In the case of Facade Solution, the Court of Appeal established a two-step
test to determine when an adjudication determination should be set aside on
the ground of fraud. The burden of establishing both steps falls on the party
seeking to set aside the adjudication determination, ie, the innocent party
(Facade Solution at [38]).

64 In the first step, the innocent party must show that the adjudication
determination was based on facts which the party seeking the claim knew, or
ought reasonably to have known, were untrue. The objective test of knowledge
would apply to every stage of the adjudication proceedings (Facade Solution at
[29]). To set aside the adjudication determination, the innocent party would
therefore have to establish (Facade Solution at [30]):

(a) The facts which were relied on by the adjudicator in arriving at the
adjudication determination.

(b) That those facts were false.

(c) That the claimant either knew or ought reasonably to have known them to be
false.

(d) That the innocent party did not, in fact, subjectively know or have actual
knowledge of the true position throughout the adjudication proceedings.

65 Notably, the requirement set out at [64(d)] is restricted to subjective or
actual knowledge because there is no need for the innocent party to show that
the evidence of fraud could have been obtained or discovered with reasonable
diligence during the adjudication proceedings (Facade Solution at [31]). This
is because parties, in dealing with the adjudicator, are expected to act with
utmost probity, and a fraudulent party should not be allowed to get away with
fraud because he had not been found out earlier in the course of the
adjudication proceedings (Facade Solution at [33]).

66 In the second step, the innocent party must establish that the facts in
question were material to the issuance of the adjudication determination.
Materiality would be established if there was a real prospect that the outcome
of the adjudicator’s determination might have been different, had he known the
truth. In other words, the facts must have been an operative cause in the
issuance of the adjudication determination, based on the reasoning and
arguments at the time the determination in question was made (Facade Solution
at [35]).

67 Where an adjudication determination was obtained by fraud, the court is
generally unsympathetic to the claimant, as the claimant would have engaged in
deliberate and dishonest conduct to acquire benefits to which it was not
entitled. On this basis, fraud unravels all and the starting point is that the
adjudication determination that was corrupted by fraudulent conduct would be
tainted in its entirety, and the whole must fail. This serves to discourage
claimants from committing fraud. However, in exceptional circumstances, the
court may exercise its discretion to sever the impugned portion of an
adjudication determination to permit the claimant to retain the balance
adjudicated sum. This discretion would be exercised where the fraud was de
minimis both in terms of nature and quantum, such that the policy
consideration of facilitating cash flow under the SOPA would outweigh the need
to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice. The factors that
the court should consider include: the nature of the fraud, the quantum of the
claim affected by the fraud and the requirements of textual and substantial
severability as enunciated by the High Court in Rong Shun Engineering &
Construction Pte Ltd v CP Ong Construction Pte Ltd [2017] 4 SLR 359 at [155]:
see Facade Solution at [61].

The decision

68 Before I considered the elements of the test in Facade Solution, I made the
following findings of fact.

The falsity of the Five Cappitech Documents

69 Firstly, I found that Builders Hub had fraudulently submitted the Five
Cappitech Documents to deceive JP Nelson. It was undisputed that Builders Hub
sent the Five Cappitech Documents to Builders Hub (see above at [18]–[19]). On
the face of it, each document, except for Cheque No 128899 (which was
allegedly sent by Builders Hub to Cappitech), originated from Cappitech.
However, in Cappitech’s 16 November Email, it denied ever issuing the four
documents to Builders Hub, nor receiving Cheque No 128899. JP Nelson also
provided the following counterevidence in relation to each of the Five
Cappitech Documents:

(a) Proforma Invoice 21-0086: In Cappitech’s records, its proforma invoice no.
21-0086 was dated 29 March 2021 for No 9 Tuas Link 2 for the sum of $24,289.
It was not for a downpayment of $84,034.80 (excluding GST). 68

not $310,990. 69

(e) Proforma Invoice No 22-0030: In Cappitech’s records, its proforma invoice
no 22-0030 was dated 22 February 2022 and for the sum of $162,000 (before
GST), and Cappitech confirmed that this invoice was not paid for. 72

70 In Builders Hub’s response to Cappitech’s 16 November Email, it claimed
that its “staff had mixed up with other projects and lumped all the labour
aircon equipments [sic] with piping work and installation with fresh air
ductwork together with your aircon equipments [sic] bill and never separated
them”. 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

Teong Boo Bing’s affidavit dated 21 November 2022 at TBB-1 p 64.

I found this explanation to be unbelievable. As JP Nelson had given evidence
that Cappitech did not create the four documents or receive Cheque No 128899,
it was implausible for Builders Hub to simply mix up otherwise non-existing
documents with that of other projects. Further, in its submissions and
affidavits, Builders Hub did not deny that it created the Five Cappitech
Documents. On the whole of the evidence, I found that Builders Hub had
fraudulently submitted the Five Cappitech Documents to deceive JP Nelson.

JP Nelson’s reliance on the Five Cappitech Documents

71 Next, I found that the Five Cappitech Documents represented to JP Nelson
that Builders Hub had made payments to Cappitech, and in reliance on these
representations, JP Nelson was induced to make the Downpayment totalling
$155,160 to Builders Hub.

72 According to JP Nelson, after JP Nelson received the fake Invoice No
21-0086, which represented that Builders Hub had paid Cappitech $84,034.80, JP
Nelson agreed to pay Builders Hub 30% of the $344,800 contract price between
JP Nelson and Builders Hub for air-conditioning systems, ie, $103,440, as a
downpayment for aircon equipment. This downpayment was reflected in Interim
Valuation 31 dated 16 December 2021 under Items H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii) for
“Air-conditioning System”. The remarks to Items H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii)
stated that the payments were for “Downpayment for Aircon equipment”. 74

73 Subsequently, on receipt of Cheque No 128899, which represented that
Builders Hub had paid Cappitech an additional $242,842.06, and the 17 January
Quotation for $310,990, JP Nelson agreed to pay 50% of the quoted $310,990
equipment cost. This agreement was recorded in JP Nelson’s email to Builders
Hub dated 10 March 2022. Mr Teong informed Builders Hub that JP Nelson agreed
to pay 50% of the aircon equipment cost, based on a total equipment cost of
$310,000, “as per Cappitech’s Proforma Invoice”. 75

This advance payment was then reflected in Interim Valuation 34 dated 9 March
2022, prepared by Infield, under items H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii) for “Air-
conditioning System”. It was stated that JP Nelson would pay an additional 15%
of the $344,800 contract price between JP Nelson and Builders Hub for air-
conditioning systems, amounting to $103,440. The remarks stated that this
additional payment was for “downpayment for aircon equipment”. 76

amounting to 45% of the $344,800 contract price between JP Nelson and Builders
Hub for air-conditioning systems. 77

75 Builders Hub did not deny that the Five Cappitech Documents led to the
$155,160 Downpayment. On the balance of probabilities, I found that the Five
Cappitech Documents induced JP Nelson to make the $155,160 Downpayment.

The Facade Solution test

76 In my judgment, JP Nelson did not satisfy the requirements of the Facade
Solution test. Principally, this was because the facts of the fraud were not
relied on by the Adjudicators in arriving at the Adjudication Determinations,
ie, JP Nelson did not satisfy Step 1(a) of the Facade Solution test.

77 According to JP Nelson, the Adjudicator relied on the facts of the fraud
because he relied on Interim Valuation 37, which provided the Response Amount
of $329,284.98. It is undisputed that the Adjudicator found that JP Nelson was
liable to pay the Response Amount of $329,284.98 (as set out at paragraph 221
of the Adjudication Determination). 78

The connection to the fraud was that in Interim Valuation 37, JP Nelson
certified that Builders Hub was entitled to 75% of the contract sum for Items
H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii) on “Air-conditioning system”. 79

Further, in PC 37, Builders Hub had claimed an additional 5% of the contract

therefore forming part of the Response Sum payable to JP Nelson. 81

78 In the Adjudication Review Determination, the Review Adjudicator reduced
the amount that JP Nelson had to pay Builders Hub by $329,284.98. This was to
avoid a double count because JP Nelson had paid the sum of $329,284.98 earlier
on 1 July 2022. However, according to JP Nelson, Builders Hub was still
retaining the fruits of its fraud as it retained the $329,284.98 paid by JP
Nelson. 83

79 In my view, Interim Valuation 37 had not been tainted by fraud. In PC 37,
under Items H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii) on “Air-conditioning system”, Builders
Hub only claimed an additional 5% of the contract sum from the previous
payment claim. The percentage increase was from 70% in payment claim 36 to 75%
in PC 37. Subsequently, in Interim Valuation 37, JP Nelson certified the 5%
claimed under Items H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii). This 5% then formed part of
the Response Amount of $329,248.98. To be clear, however, the remaining 70%,
had been claimed in previous payment claims, and was therefore not part of the
5%. Further, in Interim Valuation 37, Builders Hub stated that the “Reason for
Difference” from the previous valuation was “Based on Workdone”. Even on JP
Nelson’s case, by Interim Valuation 37, Builders Hub had completed 5% of the
works. 85

JP Nelson’s third written submissions dated 20 March 2023 at para 12.

Therefore, none of the Downpayment tainted by fraud formed part of the 5%
certified in Interim Valuation 37. As such, when the Adjudicator relied on the
Response Amount set out in Interim Valuation 37 to award that sum to Builders
Hub, it was untainted by fraud.

Fraud unravels all

80 However, notwithstanding that the present case does not pass the test in
Façade Solution, in my view, the court there did not intend it to be the only
situation under which a court may intervene. As succinctly enunciated by
Denning LJ in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley [1956] 1 QB 702 at 712 (and
affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Facade Solution at [22]), no court would
allow or assist a person to retain any advantage obtained by fraud since fraud
unravels everything:

… No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he has
obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be
allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything.
The court is careful not to find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and
proved; but once it is proved, it vitiates judgments, contracts and all
transactions whatsoever …

81 In my judgment, Builders Hub was still holding onto the fruits of its
fraud, and this was something that the court had the power to interfere with.

82 On 26 August 2022, the Contract between JP Nelson and Builders Hub was
terminated. It was undisputed that Builders Hub had received at least 75% of
the price for the air-conditioning system works. However, Builders Hub never
supplied the air-conditioning units to JP Nelson. In relation to the contract
for air-conditioning system works, Builders Hub only completed the piping,
ducting and cable tray works for the air-conditioning systems. Prima facie,
this meant that 75% of the contract price for air-conditioning system works
was apportioned to ducting, piping and cable tray works. Otherwise, JP Nelson
would have overpaid for its air-conditioning system works.

83 Both parties had tendered further submissions on the 75% valuation for the
air-conditioning works in Interim Valuation 37. JP Nelson argued that the
costs of the air-conditioning units would far exceed the 25% of the contract
price that Builders Hub had quoted, and therefore there had been overpayment.
Based on Builders Hub’s computations, which relied on Cappitech’s fake
quotation sum of $310,990, the air-conditioning equipment cost roughly 54% of
the contract sum, and the piping and cable tray works cost about 46% of the
contract sum. 86

In contrast, Builders Hub concluded that the air-conditioning equipment costs
amounted to $91,740.73, ie, 26.61% of the total contract price of $344,800 for
air-conditioning works. 87

Builders Hub’s third written submissions dated 20 March 2023 at paras 17–20;
Lawrence Lee’s affidavit dated 2 March 2023 at p 16 and 17.

This also exceeded the 25% allocation for air-conditioning units installation
that Builders Hub had claimed. Therefore, on both parties’ cases, Builders Hub
had been overpaid for the air-conditioning works contract. Taking Builders
Hub’s case at its highest, it had been overpaid by a sum of $5,540.73.

84 By the end of their contractual relationship, JP Nelson had overpaid
Builders Hub, and this was a result of the Downpayment that had been induced
by fraud. These monies continued to remain in the hands of Builders Hub.
Further, by virtue of its fraud, Builders Hub also acquired another
substantive benefit – it secured an early payment in the form of the
Downpayment. Conversely, when JP Nelson made early payment, it was exposed to
risk of losing the Downpayment, especially if Builders Hub became insolvent.
The court takes a serious view towards fraud, and there is no public interest
in allowing a litigant who had acted fraudulently to retain the fruits of its
fraud. According to Builders Hub, this amounted to about $5,540, and JP Nelson
was unable to provide a figure that was substantially higher. As Denning LJ
said, “fraud unravels everything” The question then is, what constitutes
“everything”? In my judgment, to simply order Builders Hub to repay the sum
overpaid would be an inadequate expression of the court’s disapprobation
towards fraud. Builders Hub would hardly be worse off, and this order would
not account for the early payment received by Builders Hub. Such a lenient
view would be insufficient to deter fraudulent conduct. On the other hand, to
invalidate the entire Payment Claim would unfairly punish Builders Hub as the
amount claimed was far in excess of the $155,160 which was the subject of the
fraud. In the circumstances of the case, I held that the Review Adjudicated
Amount should be reduced by the amount that the Builders Hub had unlawfully
gained as a result of its fraud, ie, $155,160.

Conclusion

85 In the circumstances, JP Nelson succeeded on its ground on fraud. I ordered
that the Adjudication Review Amount be reduced by the amount of $155,160, and
Builders Hub is ordered to repay JP Nelson the sum of $155,160, being the sum
that Builders Hub had unlawfully gained by the fraud. As JP Nelson had
partially succeeded in its application, and in view of the conduct of Builders
Hub, I ordered costs in favour of JP Nelson. Having regard to parties’
submissions, as well as all the relevant factors, I awarded JP Nelson $12,000
in legal costs (inclusive of disbursements) plus GST. Builders Hub shall pay
these costs to JP Nelson, with interest from the date of judgment at 5.33%.
