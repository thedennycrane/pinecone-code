Debbie Ong JC:

Background facts

1 The parties were married in September 1996 and had four children (“the
Children”). At the time of the hearing before me, the plaintiff husband (“the
Husband”) was 48 years old, the defendant wife (“the Wife”) was 49 years old
and the Children were 18, 17, 14 and 13 years of age. The two older children
are boys (“the Sons”) while the two younger children are girls (“the
Daughters”). One of the Daughters, Q, was diagnosed with cancer in December
2006. This was undoubtedly a difficult time for the family. Fortunately, Q has
recovered.

2 The Husband left the matrimonial home in September 2007 and filed for
divorce shortly thereafter. Interim judgment for divorce was granted in August
2009. I heard the ancillary matters relating to custody, care and control of
the Children, division of matrimonial assets, and maintenance for the Wife and
the Children on 3 June and 22 August 2016. On 14 September 2016, I delivered
my oral judgment with brief reasons. The parties have appealed against my
orders and I now give fuller grounds of my decision.

Custody, care and control, access

3 Although the Wife initially submitted that she should have sole custody,
this was not a matter that was pursued during the hearings. The parties were
content to have joint custody and the Husband was agreeable that care and
control should remain with the Wife. The Wife also informed the court that she
was supportive of the Husband having access to the Children. The aspects on
which the parties wished the court to make specific orders related to access
arrangements. The parties informed the court that there were no problems with
access generally, but were of the view that specific access arrangements
particularly in respect of the younger children and holidays would benefit the
family.

4 I ordered that the Husband and Wife shall have joint custody of the
Children, and the Wife shall have care and control of them. As for access, I
noted that the Sons were older and would have more varied schedules than the
Daughters. I ordered that the Husband have access to the Children in the
following manner:

(a) The Husband shall have reasonable liberal access to the Sons. Access to
the Sons shall be mutually arranged, with the participation of the Sons, as
the case may be.

(b) The Husband shall have access to the Daughters in the following terms:

(i) Alternate weekend access with (A) alternating with (B):

(A) overnight weekend access from Saturday 2.00 pm to Sunday 5.00 pm; and

(B) weekend access during the day on Sunday from 12.00 pm to 6.00 pm.

(ii) The third and fourth weeks of the June school holidays.

(iii) The third, fourth and fifth weeks of the December school holidays.

(iv) Alternate public holidays from 10.00 am to 5.00 pm. He shall have access
on the first day of the Chinese New Year in one year and the second day of the
Chinese New Year in the following year.

(c) The Husband may take the Children out of Singapore during his access time.
He shall give the Wife 48 hours’ notice of his intention to take the Children
overseas and the Wife shall provide the Children’s passports for the purpose
of the overseas access.

5 I was heartened by the efforts put in by both parties to work together in
the interests of the Children and I commend the parties for cooperating with
each other in enabling the Children to spend time with both parents. Section
46 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Women’s Charter”)
imposes a legal obligation on both parents to “co-operate with each other ...
in caring and providing for the children”. I exhort the parties to continue to
discharge their parental responsibilities by also supporting the other parent
in parenting and bonding with the Children. To this end, the access
arrangements which I have ordered may be adjusted by the parties’ mutual
agreement. It is not in the welfare of the Children to be inflexible with
access arrangements. For example, the parties may arrange between themselves
for access to be carried out in different weeks of the school holidays and for
different lengths, in accordance with the best interests of the Children. If
the Children wish to spend more weekends overnight with the Husband, the
parties can also mutually agree to make suitable arrangements.

Division of matrimonial assets

The applicable legal principles

6 Section 112 of the Women’s Charter provides that the court shall have the
power to order the division of matrimonial assets in such proportions as the
court thinks just and equitable. It is well established that the court’s power
to divide matrimonial assets is to be exercised in broad strokes. The court
ought not to be engaged in a precise mathematical exercise. This approach,
which has come to be known as the “broad brush approach”, has been adopted in
numerous decisions (see, for example, Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye [2007] 3
SLR(R) 520 at [33]–[35] and ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ANJ”) at [17] and
[21]).

7 In ANJ, the Court of Appeal set out a structured framework consistent with
the broad brush approach for the division of matrimonial assets that would
sufficiently accord recognition to each party’s direct and indirect
contributions to the marriage. The structured approach involves the following
steps (at [22]):

Using the structured approach, the court could first ascribe a ratio that
represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other
party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has
made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. Next,
to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage,
instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the
other an “uplift” to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court
should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect
contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other.
Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions,
the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the
family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further
adjustments (to take into account, inter alia, the other factors enumerated in
s 112(2) of the [Women’s Charter]) may need to be made to the parties’ average
percentage contributions ….

8 The Court of Appeal in ANJ cautioned that the application of the structured
approach is not a return to an arithmetical exercise, which has been
consistently eschewed by the court. For instance, the court observed that the
parties’ direct financial contributions towards the acquisition of the
matrimonial assets would often be far from clear. The broad brush approach is
applied even in respect of ascribing a ratio which represents each party’s
direct contributions: where the evidence falls short of establishing the
direct financial contributions of the parties, the court must make a “rough
and ready approximation” of the figures, approaching the issue with sound
judgment, having regard to the “inherent veracity of each party’s version of
events reflected in their affidavits or testimony as well as the documentary
evidence” (see ANJ at [23]). This is an important point in the present case,
and is a point that I will return to later.

The parties' matrimonial assets and their values

9 The parties’ most substantial matrimonial asset is their matrimonial home
located at Alnwick Road (“the Alnwick Property”) which they own in joint
names. Besides the Alnwick Property, the Husband also owns 48.41% of the
shares in a real estate services company (“the Company”), where he is the
Chief Executive Officer. The matrimonial assets also include bank accounts,
insurance policies and motor vehicles. The pool of matrimonial assets were not
disputed by parties, but the valuation of certain assets were disputed.

10 At the first ancillary matters hearing on 3 June 2016, I directed parties
to submit the most updated agreed summary of their matrimonial assets and
their values (indicating the agreed values and the disputed values), in the
form of a table. The parties subsequently submitted other information that I
had directed be filed, but did not submit this tabular summary of matrimonial
assets. At the subsequent hearing on 22 August 2016, without this direction
being complied with, the court gave both parties copies of a table of figures
reflecting the parties’ matrimonial assets and liabilities (“the Table”),
which was prepared by the court from perusing the papers in these proceedings.
Both counsel examined the Table and accepted the figures therein as accurate.
The figures in the Table are presented below at [18]–[20].

11 The operative date for the purposes of determining the value of the
matrimonial assets I adopted in the present case is the date of the ancillary
matters hearing. The Court of Appeal in Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and
another appeal [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“Yeo Chong Lin”) was of the view (at [39])
that Parliament did not intend to prescribe a definite cut-off date for
identifying the pool of matrimonial assets, but stated that once an asset was
regarded as a matrimonial asset to be divided, its value should be assessed at
the date of the hearing of ancillary matters. This should be understood in the
light of ARY v ARX and another appeal [2016] 2 SLR 686, where the Court of
Appeal held that the date of the interim judgment of divorce ought to be taken
as a starting point, but not a fixed operative date, for identifying the pool
of matrimonial assets and further, that “the court has not only the discretion
to select the operative date to determine the pool of matrimonial assets, it
also has the discretion to determine the date at which those assets should be
valued” (at [36]) [emphasis in original]. In my view, the date of the
ancillary matters hearing ought to be used as a starting point as the
operative date for valuing the assets. As it was impractical to have parties
constantly updating every value each time the matter was fixed for hearing,
the values which I adopted were the values which the parties adduced that were
as close to the date of the ancillary matters hearing as possible.

Values of the Alnwick Property and the shares in the Company

12 While the parties had agreed to most of the values stated in the Table, the
value of the Alnwick Property and the shares in the Company were disputed. The
parties initially took different positions on the value of the Alnwick
Property. It was then agreed during the hearing on 3 June 2016 that the
parties would appoint a valuer to conduct a valuation of the Alnwick Property.
The Alnwick Property was inspected on 19 July 2016 by a valuer from Savills
Valuation and Professional Services (S) Pte Ltd and valued at $4,100,000 as at
28 July 2016. This was the value I adopted for the purposes of the division
exercise.

13 Turning to the shares in the Company, a report by Nexia TS Advisory Pte Ltd
(“Nexia”) dated 1 February 2016 valued the 100% equity in the shares at
$174,000 as at 31 December 2013. This valuation was done pursuant to an order
of court dated 13 May 2013, which ordered that a valuation of the Company be
done by an independent expert to be jointly appointed by both parties.

14 The Wife submitted that the valuation of the Company by Nexia was flawed
because the information that Nexia had of the Company came solely from the
Husband and that the Husband had not been fully forthcoming with the
information. She requested that Nexia be ordered to release the information
relied on to reach its valuation of $174,000 or that a new valuation to be
made.

15 I declined to do so. Nexia was an independent expert appointed by both
parties pursuant to the order of court. It was the Husband’s evidence that the
Wife was the party who chose Nexia as the expert. Given that the Nexia report
on the Company was made by independent professionals who were appointed by
both parties and commissioned by the Wife, I do not find sufficient reason to
reject the values presented therein in favour of another report or to use a
different value.

Table of matrimonial assets

16 The parties did not dispute the values of the other assets and were content
to accept the values on the face of the documents. As stated above at [10],
both counsel accepted the figures in the Table at the hearing on 22 August
2016.

17 Based on both counsel’s confirmation, the following tables set out the
assets and liabilities of the parties. These tables of assets only include
assets which have a value of more than $1,000. The Husband’s joint bank
accounts with the Children were not included in the pool of matrimonial assets
as the amounts therein are small. Further, I treated them as intended for and
belonging to the Children. One of the Husband’s bank accounts (OCBC Account No
5XX-X-XXX748) was also excluded as it was also held in the Husband’s mother’s
name and had a relatively small balance of slightly more than $1,000 (as at 30
November 2015).

18 The following shows the assets and liabilities in the Husband’s name:

The net asset value of the assets in the Husband’s name is $411,393.35 (which
I rounded to $411,400 for ease of calculation).

The net value of the assets in the parties’ joint names is $4,000,106.24
(which I rounded to $4,000,000).

21 Based on these tables, the total net value of the matrimonial assets is
$4,739,800.

Parties’ direct contributions

Direct contributions to the Alnwick Property

22 The Alnwick Property was purchased in January 2002 for $1.25m. This was
financed in part by a $1m loan from UOB Bank. Based on the UOB bank
statements, the cost of acquiring the Alnwick Property (excluding stamp duty
and legal fees) may be computed as follows:

Table 6: Cost of acquisition of the Alnwick Property  
---  
Description| Value  
Upfront cash payment| $250,000  
Mortgage repayments (including interest)| $1,119,100.79  
Total| $1,369,100.79 (rounded to $1.37m)  
  
23 It was not disputed that $210,201.89 from the Husband’s CPF account and
$264,911.19 from the Wife’s CPF account were used to purchase the Alnwick
Property. It was also not disputed that the parties each contributed
$73,784.70 for payment of stamp duties and legal fees. However, the parties
advanced vastly different positions on their contributions with respect to
other payments (eg, towards discharging the mortgage).

24 The Wife’s position was that the funds for the acquisition came from the
sale proceeds of the parties’ second property (“the Ripley Property”). The
Ripley Property was purchased for $930,000 in 1999 and sold for $1,050,000 in
2002. According to the Wife, she had used the entire sale proceeds of $208,000
from the sale of a condominium unit which she owned solely (“the Tanglin
Property”) to pay for the cash portion of the Ripley Property. When the Ripley
Property was sold in 2002, the sale proceeds of $325,000 were used to purchase
the Alnwick Property. Whilst the Husband agreed that the Wife had put in about
$200,000 for the purchase of the Ripley Property, he also stated that he had
put in more than $130,000 in cash, paid for the stamp duty and legal fees and
funded the renovations for the Ripley Property such that his financial
contribution to the Ripley Property exceeded the Wife’s financial
contribution.

25 Besides the issue of contribution to the Ripley Property, the Wife also
argued that she contributed to the acquisition of the Alnwick Property through
her director’s fees amounting to $473,000. It was not disputed that the Wife
was a director of the Company during the subsistence of the marriage. The
Wife’s position was that she assisted the Husband in the business, handled the
accounts of the Company and received director’s fees which were used to
discharge the mortgage over the Alnwick Property.

26 On the other hand, the Husband’s position appeared to be that he
contributed entirely to the mortgage repayments. He submitted that the Wife
was only a nominal director in the Company and did not perform any substantial
role. According to the Husband, the Wife’s director’s fees from 2000 to 2004
were only declared for tax purposes and no sums were received by the Wife.
However, from April 2004 onwards, the director’s fees were paid directly into
her designated bank account for the purpose of allowing her to receive regular
income for the family and also to enable the Husband to take advantage of tax
deductions in order to reduce his tax liability. It was not entirely clear
whether or not the Husband’s position was that the Wife’s director’s fees were
used to pay the mortgage on the Alnwick Property. On the one hand, he stated
at para 8 of his affidavit dated 30 July 2014 that “[t]he mortgage for the
home was never at all paid from her director’s fees but it was from my
account”. However, at para 65 of the same affidavit, he stated:

The [Wife] talks as if she was a partner and a co-worker. She is seeking to
misguide the Court as to her role and place. She was never anything in the
company except in name and she was used to receive CPF and director’s fees
which was used to make payment for the [Alnwick Property] in order to minimise
tax incidence for myself.

27 Putting the assertions of the parties aside, the documentary evidence
showed that the mortgage loan for the Alnwick Property was progressively
repaid from 2002 to 2013. The Wife also exhibited income tax information for
the years 2001 to 2011 which showed that she had been paid director’s fees.
These income tax information were forms submitted by the Husband (as employer)
to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore over those years as a declaration
that these sums were paid by the Company to the Wife. However, there was
little else by way of objective evidence. For example, there was no
documentary evidence clearly showing the proportion of the parties’ direct
financial contributions to the Ripley Property. Neither was there evidence
indicating that the sale proceeds from the Ripley Property were used entirely
to fund the purchase of the Alnwick Property, nor evidence which proved that
the Wife’s director’s fees had been fully channeled towards the mortgage
repayments.

28 Many of the arguments proffered by the parties were not substantiated with
documentary evidence. This was not surprising. It is only to be expected that
when parties are still in a functioning marriage, neither may keep records of
transactions with a view to producing them in the event of a divorce. As the
Court of Appeal had noted in ANJ (at [23]):

Even in respect of direct financial contributions of the parties, not
infrequently, the situation is less than clear. In a case where the
documentary evidence falls short of establishing exactly who made what
contribution and/or the exact amount of monetary contribution made by each
party, the court must make a “rough and ready approximation” of the figures
(see NK v NL … at [28], citing Hoong Khai Soon v Cheng Kwee Eng [1993] 1
SLR(R) 823 at [17] with approval). At the end of the day, the court would have
to approach the issue by exercising sound judgment, having regard to the
inherent veracity of each party’s version of events reflected in their
affidavits or testimony as well as the documentary evidence. This is where
“broad brush” comes in.

The broad brush approach is thus also applicable to the process of reaching
the parties’ direct financial contributions.

29 Having regard to the totality of the evidence, I accepted that the truth
was somewhere in between both parties’ assertions. In my view, the Wife’s
director’s fees might have been used, in part, to repay the mortgage loan. I
also accepted that both the Husband and the Wife had contributed to the
purchase of the Ripley Property, and that the sale proceeds of the Ripley
Property might have been used, in part, to fund the purchase of the Alnwick
Property. At the same time, it was clear from the evidence that the Husband
was the main breadwinner, who worked hard as a businessman and generated most
of the parties’ wealth during the marriage. Although the Wife had contributed
to the Company, her contributions were not as substantial as the Husband’s.
Given the evidentiary difficulties, it was not possible to arrive at a precise
mathematical conclusion, apart from these broad factual observations.

30 It was therefore necessary to apply a broad brush approach and approximate
the parties’ respective direct financial contributions to the acquisition of
the Alnwick Property, having regard to the broad factual premises which I have
observed above. To reiterate, it was likely that the funds for the acquisition
of the Alnwick Property came from both the sale proceeds of the Ripley
Property, the Husband’s own funds derived from the real estate business, and
the Wife’s director’s fees that had been declared by the Company. In this
regard, the sale proceeds of the Ripley Property were attributable to the
efforts of both the Husband and the Wife. With this in mind and taking a broad
brush approach, it was, in my view, fair to attribute the payments towards the
acquisition of the property (after accounting for the amount contributed from
each party’s CPF funds over which there was no dispute) in the proportion of
70% to the Husband and 30% to the Wife. The following table sets out the
relevant calculations:

Table 7: Parties’ direct contributions to the acquisition of the Alnwick
Property  
---  
Description of contribution towards acquisition| Husband’s contribution|
Wife’s contribution  
Husband’s CPF| $210,201.89| -  
Wife’s CPF| -| $264,911.19  
Payments towards mortgage or other payments (70:30)| $626,420.84| $268,466.08  
Total contribution of each party to the cost of acquisition of the Alnwick
Property ($1.37m)| $836,622.73| $533,377.27  
  
31 The parties’ undisputed contribution of $73,784.70 each for payment of the
stamp duty and legal fees may also be attributed to each of them as their
direct financial contributions to the purchase of the Alnwick Property.

32 The Husband also submitted that he had contributed to the general upkeep of
the Alnwick Property as well as towards renovation costs and provided receipts
and invoices evidencing his contributions. I accept that the Husband made such
contributions but I took them into account as the Husband’s indirect
contributions to the marriage, which I accounted for below (see [40] below).
It was noted that the Husband had submitted that these expenses formed part of
his indirect financial contributions in his affidavit of asset and means dated
23 February 2011 (at para 22).

Direct contributions to the other matrimonial assets

33 As there was no evidence of the parties’ historical contributions towards
the acquisition of the assets held in the parties’ own names, I applied a
broad brush approach and used the value of the assets in the parties’
respective names (see [18] and [19] above) as reflecting their respective
direct financial contributions.

Ratio of the parties’ direct contributions

34 The ratio of the parties’ direct financial contributions to the matrimonial
assets was thus computed as follows:

Table 8: Ratio of the parties’ direct financial contributions  
---  
Direct financial contributions| Husband’s contribution| Wife’s contribution  
Assets in the name of either party| $411,400| $328,400  
Contributions towards acquisition of Alnwick Property| $836,622.73|
$533,377.27  
Stamp duty and legal fees for Alnwick Property| $73,784.70| $73,784.70  
Total contributions| $1,321,807.43| $935,561.97  
Percentage| 58.55%Rounded to 59%| 41.45%Rounded to 41%  
  
Parties’ indirect contributions

35 The Wife submitted that she had taken on the role of homemaker even when
she was working during the early years of the marriage. Between 1994 and 2000,
the Wife was employed as a regional marketing manager in an American company.
This job required her to travel a fair bit. Thus, in the early years of the
marriage when the Sons were very young, she was working and caring for the
family with the assistance of domestic helpers.

36 In 2000, the Wife left her job with the American company. Between 2000 and
2004, she helped out in the Husband’s real estate business and studied for a
bachelor’s degree in real estate valuation at the National University of
Singapore in the years before 2004. During this period, the Daughters were
born. It appeared from the evidence that, compared to the earlier years of the
marriage, the Wife spent more time with the Children during this period.

37 As mentioned earlier, Q was diagnosed with cancer in December 2006. This
was a stressful time for both the Husband and the Wife. In her first affidavit
of asset and means, the Wife detailed her efforts in taking care of Q. It was
around this time that cracks began to appear in the parties’ relationship. The
Children lived with the Wife after the Husband left the matrimonial home
sometime in 2007.

38 The Husband submitted that during the early years of the marriage, he was
involved in looking after the Sons when the Wife was travelling for business.
Not only did he provide for the welfare of the family then, he also took on
responsibilities in the school advisory committee of Deyi Secondary School
from 2004 to 2010. He was also involved in taking care of Q during the period
of her illness and juggled between his home and business duties during this
period.

39 It was clear from the evidence that the Wife’s contributions to the welfare
of the family were substantial. The parties had raised four children in this
marriage. She was the main caregiver of the Children during the marriage and
had taken care of the Children for many years after the parties were
separated. Although she appeared to have spent some amount of time away from
the family during the early years of the marriage, she played a much more
active role in the family during the later years of the marriage, when she
managed the Children’s daily needs, assisted them with their homework, and
sent the Children for their various extra-curricular activities. During the
period of Q’s illness, the Wife was heavily involved in caring for Q. In a
report, Dr Chan Mei Yoke, Q’s doctor, noted that the Wife was the one who
accompanied Q to her hospitalisation and outpatient appointments. The Wife
stated that when Q was settled in the hospital ward, she would be home in the
afternoon to check on the other children before heading back to the hospital
later in the day.

40 The Husband had also contributed to the family’s welfare in no small
amount. It was important to note that the Wife was employed in the early years
of the marriage, and that the parenting effort (especially of the Sons) would
have come from both parents (though not necessarily to an equal extent). When
Q was ill and the Wife was focused on caring for her, the Husband played a
role in taking care of the home and the other children. Besides his care of
the Children, the Husband also contributed substantially to the family’s
welfare financially. As I have stated above, I had taken the amounts that the
Husband paid towards the upkeep of the Alnwick Property (ie, the matrimonial
home) as his indirect contributions to the marriage. This amount of
approximately $800,000 is substantial and if it had been included in the
calculation of the ratio of direct contributions, would have raised the
Husband’s ratio by a fair amount. In my assessment of the facts, the Husband’s
contribution to the upkeep of the matrimonial home was just one instance of
his overall provision for the family. It was therefore important to give
sufficient weight to this when this was being accounted for as indirect
contributions. While this was not a precise mathematical exercise, due weight
had to be given to the Husband’s efforts in providing a comfortable life for
the family.

41 In the circumstances, I found it fair to attribute the indirect
contributions to the marriage in the proportions of 60% to the Wife and 40% to
the Husband.

Just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets

42 Applying the structured framework in ANJ, the average ratio was derived as
follows:

Table 9: Derivation of the average ratio  
---  
| Husband| Wife  
A. Direct contributions| 59%| 41%  
B. Indirect contributions| 40%| 60%  
Average of A and B| 49.5%| 50.5%  
  
43 This was a 13-year marriage where four children have been raised. Both the
parties participated, to different degrees, in homemaking, parenting and the
generation of wealth. Taking a broad brush approach, I found it just and
equitable for each party to receive an equal share of the total pool of
matrimonial assets valued at $4,739,800. This worked out to each receiving the
value of $2,369,900 in the assets.

Adverse inferences

44 Both parties submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against
the other. The structured approach under ANJ permits adverse inferences to be
drawn where these are warranted by the facts (at [29]). This may result in the
court either increasing the pool of matrimonial assets to account for the
undisclosed assets or awarding the party whom the court finds to have failed
to make full and frank disclosure a lower proportion of the known assets.
However, a court would not draw an adverse inference against a party too
readily (see Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah [2007] SGCA 21 (“Koh Bee Choo”) at
[30]). In order for an adverse inference to be drawn, it must be demonstrated
that there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case
against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn, and that person
must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be
hiding (see Koh Bee Choo at [28] and Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim [2015] 2 SLR
195 at [62]).

45 The Wife submitted that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the
Husband for his failure to disclose his assets such as his ownership in a sole
proprietorship known as RX, his safe deposit box, as well as some apartment
units in Singapore and in Beijing. The Husband, on the other hand, alleged
that the Wife had failed to provide the money trail of the Tanglin Property
sale proceeds.

46 I did not think that there was a sufficiently solid substratum of evidence
upon which it was appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the Husband
or the Wife. The Husband’s assertion against the Wife concerning the proceeds
of the Tanglin Property was a bare one, not sufficiently supported by any
prima facie evidence. Indeed, the evidence was that the Wife had purchased the
Tanglin Property in 1995 and sold it in 1998 and unless the Wife was so
unusually fastidious with record-keeping, it was only to be expected, given
the passage of time, that she would not be able to provide coherent records of
the money trail.

47 I accepted that the Husband’s initial failure to disclose his interest in
RX was a result of inadvertence and that the sole proprietorship was not of
substantial value. The Husband also explained that he had closed up his safe
deposit box in September 2008, and supported this with a letter confirming the
closure of the safe deposit box.

48 The Wife raised the issue of the Husband’s alleged apartment units in
Singapore. Some of these units were located in a condominium development known
as the Icon (“the Icon units”), while another unit was located in another
condominium development known as the Riviera (“the Riviera unit”). In respect
of the Icon units, it appeared that the Husband co-owned one unit with two
other family members. There was evidence that other Icon units were purchased
by the Husband’s family members or companies. During the hearing of 22 August
2016, the Wife’s counsel confirmed that the Wife was not asserting that the
Icon and Riviera units were specific matrimonial assets to be included in the
matrimonial asset pool but was only asking the court to make adverse
inferences against the Husband. The Wife asserted that the Husband’s family
members and companies were holding these properties for him. I was unable to
find a prima facie case that the Husband was hiding assets in the name of his
family members or the companies with respect to the Icon units. In respect of
the unit in which he co-owned, there was little information provided about the
source of funds for that purchase, when this unit was purchased or when it was
sold. In an affidavit dated 22 May 2012, the Husband stated that the Icon
units were purchased after the parties had separated and had already been
sold, with the profits divided according to each person’s contribution. In my
view, the Husband could have provided more information on the units he owned,
but I find that his failure to do so was due to a lack of diligence and I was
not satisfied that it was appropriate to make an adverse inference against him
under the circumstances.

49 As for the Riviera unit, this was owned by the Husband’s sister and
appeared to have been sold sometime in 2009 or 2010 after the parties had
separated. The Wife relied on a court judgment regarding the sale of this
property involving the Husband’s sister, but the judgment only demonstrated
that the Husband acted as his sister’s agent in the sale, and not that he had
beneficial ownership of the property. This could explain why the Husband did
not furnish further information on this property.

50 The Wife also alleged that the Husband was concealing a property in
Beijing, and relied on a transcribed conversation as evidence of this. The
conversation apparently recorded the Husband speaking to a friend about money
and a Beijing apartment. The transcript recorded a man speaking, but it was
not clear from the transcript itself whether the man was the Husband, when the
conversation took place, and with whom the conversation took place. Without
more information, such as the primary recording or the evidence of how the
recording took place, there was little weight, if any, that I could place on
this evidence.

51 Finally, although this was not a matter raised by the Wife as an issue
before me, I note that, in relation to disclosures of the shares in companies
held by the Husband, there was insufficient basis for me to draw an adverse
inference against the Husband, even if he could have been fuller in the
disclosures. The Husband had disclosed his shareholding in these companies
from his first affidavit of asset and means and there was no evidence that he
had an intention to actively conceal this information. When discovery was
sought of the financial statements for 2009 and 2010, the Husband produced
them. The Wife did not argue that the Husband’s interest in these companies
ought to fall within the pool of matrimonial assets, and the only contest
concerning the Husband’s shareholding in the various companies before me was
in relation to the valuation of the Company, which I have dealt with at
[13]–[15] above.

Maintenance

The Wife

52 The Wife is presently employed and earning an income. She submitted that
she earned $2,800 per month. Although her income tax statements reflected a
higher amount, it was explained that these were because her statements
reflected the interim maintenance of $1,200 per month which she had been
receiving from the Husband. I accepted this explanation which was
substantiated by supporting documentation.

53 The Wife submitted that she spent about $2,780 per month on the basis that
the household expenses were shared with the Children. Her income was therefore
sufficient for her own expenses. Further, she was to receive more than $2m
worth of assets in the division order. I therefore ordered that there shall be
no maintenance for the Wife.

The Children

54 The Husband submitted that the maintenance for the Children be fixed at
$5,000 per month. On the other hand, the Wife submitted that the expenses of
the Children amounted to about $9,500 per month. It is noted that the Children
had been receiving $5,100 per month as interim maintenance.

55 In my view, the list of expenses which the Wife exhibited were rather
generous. For example, the list included an expenditure of $1,000 per month on
holidays, and $460 per month on dining out, movies and concerts. Some of the
sums, such as home maintenance of $400 per month were also questionable and,
in my view, there was also some double-counting within the list of expenses.
Also, the expenses of various items would fluctuate each month depending on
the Children’s activities. A holistic approach ought to be taken, instead of
one which microscopically analyses each item of anticipated expense.

56 Expenses and needs are not the only factors to be considered. I note that
the Husband was a man of some means. He earned an annual income of $227,204 in
the past year (ie, year of assessment (“YA”) 2016), which amounts to an income
of about $18,750 per month. I also note that the Husband earned the following
annual income: (a) $152,932 in YA 2015; (b) $302,552 in YA 2010; and (c)
$300,452 in YA 2009. The Husband has therefore been able to earn between
$12,000 and $25,000 per month, though I noted that the Husband’s income in YA
2015 appeared to be somewhat of an anomaly relative to his income in other
years.

57 Having regard to the Children’s monthly expenses as well as the Husband’s
income, I ordered that the Husband shall pay $7,500 per month for the
Children’s maintenance.

Conclusion

58 For the above reasons, I made the following orders:

(a) The parties shall have joint custody of the Children, with care and
control to the Wife and access to the Husband on the specified terms.

(b) The Husband and Wife shall each receive 50% of the total pool of assets
valued at $4,739,800.

(c) There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

(d) The Husband shall pay $7,500 as monthly maintenance for the Children.

(e) The parties shall bear their own costs.
