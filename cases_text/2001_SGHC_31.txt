Civil Procedure – Appeals – Leave to appeal – Application for leave to appeal
to High Court – Amount of damages claimed below statutory amount – Whether
leave could be granted – s 21(1) Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322)  
  

: In this case, the plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to as `LSH`), who shipped
a cargo of mace from Belawan, Indonesia, to Singapore, sued the defendants
(hereinafter referred to as `ICS`), their insurers, for failing to indemnify
them for the loss of a part of the said cargo. Their claim, which was
instituted in the district court, was dismissed by the trial judge. As the
amount claimed was less than $50,000, LSH applied for leave to appeal to the
High Court. I dismissed the application and now set out my reasons for having
done so.  
  
LSH, a Singapore company, are in the business of trading spices. They ship
spices from overseas markets to Singapore and prepare them for sale.  
  
To facilitate their trade, LSH applied for and received from ICS a Marine Open
Cover, which commenced on 9 December 1998, and was intended to be in force
until it was cancelled by either party. The limit of liability under the cover
for any shipment under the arrangement was US$1.25m and LSH had to declare
every consignment to ICS. Where this has been done, ICS was bound to accept
the risk for up to the limit of liability.  
  
In January 1999, LSH shipped 14 metric tons of mace from Belawan to Singapore.
Mace is the outer covering of the nutmeg seed and is an aromatic spice used
for cooking purposes. The cargo of mace was packed in lined gunnysacks. There
were 434 bags of mace and they were loaded into two containers on board a
vessel, the Penang Glory.  
  
Without LSH`s knowledge, the carrier removed the two containers containing
LSH`s cargo of mace and loaded them onto another vessel, the Seven Seas
Beacon. The original bill of lading was not substituted with a new one.  
  
On 2 February 1999, ICS, after having been informed by LSH about the cargo in
question, issued LSH a policy, which noted that the cargo of mace was shipped
on board the Penang Glory. It is pertinent to note that by then, the cargo had
already arrived in Singapore on board the Seven Seas Beacon.  
  
After the vessel arrived in Singapore, it was discovered that 117 bags of mace
were wet. The damaged cargo was sold as salvage. LSH then made a claim against
ICS for $41,050.08, the loss suffered as a result of the sale of the damaged
cargo at a heavily discounted price.  
  
In due course, ICS discovered that LSH`s cargo had not been carried on board
the Penang Glory and that the Seven Seas Beacon, which carried the cargo to
Singapore, took 17 days to sail from Belawan to Singapore, when a vessel
usually completes this voyage in about two days. The reason for this delay was
not explained.  
  
Although ICS invited LSH to submit a claim for their consideration, they did
not settle the claim. As such, LSH instituted an action in the district court
against ICS to recover their loss. ICS resisted LSH`s claim on several
grounds, including lack of good faith, inherent vice, insufficiency or
unsuitability of packing, failure to act with reasonable despatch and delay.
As far as loss by delay was concerned, ICS relied on the Institute Cargo
Clauses (A) (hereinafter referred to as `ICC(A)`), which were applicable to
the policy. Clause 4 of the ICC(A) provides as follows:

> _
>
> 4 In no case shall this insurance cover
>
> 4.5 loss, damage or expense proximately caused by delay even though the
> delay be caused by a risk insured against ...
>
> _

  
  
In addition, ICS relied on s 55(2)(b) of the Marine Insurance Act (Cap 387),
which provides that unless the policy otherwise provides, the insurer on ship
or goods is not liable for any loss proximately caused by delay although the
delay be caused by a peril insured against.  
  
The trial judge found that there were two proximate causes of the loss in
question. The first was the prolonged exposure of the damaged mace to the sun,
rain and cold. The second was delay. The trial judge explained as follows:

> _The plaintiffs submitted at trial that the proximate cause of damage was
> the prolonged exposure of the affected container to the external factors of
> sun, rain and the coolness of night ..._

> _In my findings, I accepted the plaintiffs` submission that prolonged
> exposure to external factors of sun, rain and the coolness of night was a
> proximate cause of damage. Ironically, it was the plaintiffs` own theory of
> causation that proved fatal to their claim. It was to me obvious that mere
> exposure to weather conditions cannot be the sole proximate cause of damage.
> An equally vital element is the prolonged exposure which occurred [because
> of] the delay to the voyage. I therefore found that delay and exposure to
> climatic conditions were the joint proximate causes of damage._

  
  
It is trite law that where there are two or more concurrent causes of a loss,
the insurer is entitled to avoid liability if one of the causes falls within
the ambit of an exception in the policy. This principle has been applied in
innumerable cases, including **Siang Hoa Goldsmith Pte Ltd v The Wing On Fire
& Marine Insurance Co Ltd** [1998] 2 SLR 777 , a decision of the Court of
Appeal. Having found that there were two proximate causes of the damage to the
plaintiffs` cargo of mace, the trial judge held that as damage which is
proximately caused by delay was an excluded peril in the policy, ICS was
entitled to avoid liability for LSH`s loss.  
  
On 22 September 2000, the trial judge heard LSH`s application for leave to
appeal to the High Court against his judgment and dismissed the same. As a
result, LSH filed an application in the High Court for leave to appeal against
the decision of the trial judge.  
  
For the purpose of determining whether or not leave to appeal against the
judgment of the trial judge should be granted to LSH, it would be helpful if
the following words of Lai Kew Chai J in **Anthony s/o Savarimiuthu v Soh
Chuan Tin** [1989] SLR 607  [1989] 3 MLJ 5  are borne in mind:

> _The High Court`s power is obviously discretionary and such discretionary
> power has to be exercised judicially and ought to be exercised if prima
> facie and generally it could be shown that justice would require an
> appellate investigation of the case._

> _... To obtain leave to appeal when the amount involved is below the
> statutory amount, an applicant for leave must show that a serious and
> important issue of law is involved. That was held by Murray-Aynsley CJ in
> [**Wong Yin v Wong Mook** [1948] MLJ 164 ], on the basis that rights of
> appeal are purely creatures of statute and a court cannot entertain any
> which cannot be brought strictly within the statutory limit. The
> circumstances for granting leave would include (though obviously not limited
> to) cases where an applicant is able to demonstrate a prima facie case of
> error or if the question is one of general principle upon which further
> argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to public advantage.
> This was pronounced by Edgar Joseph Jr J in [ **Pang Hon Chin v Nahar
> Singh** [1986] 2 MLJ 145 ]. These propositions have a common thread: that to
> deny leave may conceivably result in a miscarriage of justice._

  
  
More recently, in **Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong** [1997] 3 SLR 489  at p
496, Yong Pung How CJ summed up the position in the following succinct terms:

> _[F]rom the cases, it is apparent that there are at least three limbs which
> can be relied upon when leave to appeal is sought: (1) prima facie case of
> error; (2) question of general principle decided for the first time; and (3)
> question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a
> higher tribunal would be to the public advantage._

  
  
LSH asserted that a denial of leave to appeal to the High Court would
conceivably result in a miscarriage of justice. In the main, they disputed the
trial judge`s finding that there was delay and that delay was one of the
proximate causes of the loss. I saw no merit in allowing an appeal for the
sake of determining whether or not the trial judge was right in concluding
from the facts and after hearing witnesses that delay was one of the proximate
causes of the loss.  
  
As for LSH`s argument that ICS failed to plead that the claim was defeated by
the defence of delay, this cannot be countenanced. Perhaps, the pleadings
could have been clearer but it is obvious from the pleadings that this defence
was relied upon by ICS. After all, reference was made to the relevant clauses
of the ICC(A) and the Marine Insurance Act with respect to delay and paras 9
and 15 of the defence filed by ICS stated as follows:

> _
>
> 9 The alleged bill of lading for this subject shipment was issued on 11
> January 1999. According to the said bill of lading, the subject container
> was allegedly shipped on board the `Penang Glory` on 11 January 1999. The
> normal transit time from Belawan, Indonesia to Singapore is about two days
> at the maximum. In this case, the voyage took approximately 17 days.
>
> ...
>
> 15 Further and/or in the alternative, the defendants repeat the matters
> pleaded in para 9 hereof. In the premises, the damage was due to the
> aforesaid delay.
>
> _

  
  
LSH also asserted that as the policy issued for the cargo in question referred
to the date of the vessel`s arrival but not to the date of her departure from
Belawan, it may be assumed that ICS was not interested in the duration of the
voyage from Belawan to Singapore. LSH contended that, in view of this, ICS
should not be allowed to complain that the delayed arrival of the vessel was a
cause of the damage to part of their cargo of mace. This line of argument is
erroneous. If it is correct, this would mean that by not stating the departure
date in the policy, ICS would have lost the right to avoid liability for any
loss caused by delay if the vessel carrying LSH`s cargo left Belawan eight
months ago but was delayed in an intermediate port for several months for
unexplained reasons. In such a situation, ICS would, without more, certainly
be entitled to rely on the exception in the policy with respect to damage
caused by delay.  
  
LSH next pointed out that insufficient attention was paid to cl 8.3 of the
ICC(A), which provides as follows:

> _The insurance shall remain in force ... during delay beyond the control of
> the Assured ..._

  
  
LSH contended that the effect of cl 8.3 of the ICC(A) is that where a voyage
has been prolonged by circumstances beyond their control, ICS is not entitled
to avoid liability by relying on an exception with respect to damage caused by
delay. LSH submitted that there was an inconsistency between the terms of cl
8.3 of the ICC(A) and s 55 of the Marine Insurance Act and said that it would
be in the public interest if these are `reconciled and clarified by a higher
tribunal in view of the far reaching implications`.  
  
LSH`s interpretation of cl 8.3 of the ICC(A) is incorrect. This clause merely
makes it crystal clear that the policy shall remain in force during delay
beyond the control of the assured. It does not have the effect of negating the
other terms of the policy, including the exceptions to the insurer`s liability
for loss. This clause does not say that if delay is an excepted cause of loss
in the policy, an excusable prolongation of the voyage will render that
exception inapplicable. It should also be noted that cl 4.5 of the ICC(A)
specifically provides that the insurance cover provided does not cover loss,
damage or expense proximately caused by delay even though the delay is caused
by a risk insured against. If LSH`s construction of cl 8.3 of the ICC(A) is
correct, cl 4.5 of the ICC(A) would have no room to operate.  
  
It was very obvious that there was no reason for granting leave to LSH to
appeal to the High Court against the judgment of the trial judge. In view of
this, LSH`s application for leave to appeal was dismissed. As for the question
of costs, LSH asserted that the trial judge erred when he awarded ICS full
costs even though he rejected all but one of the many defences pleaded. LSH
contended that it was inequitable that ICS should be awarded full costs in
these circumstances. However, as the parties have since reached a settlement
with respect to the question of costs, the matter need not be considered any
further and I made no order with respect to costs.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application dismissed.
