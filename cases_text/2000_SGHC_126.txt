: The plaintiff is the sole proprietor of a business registered as Coco
Properties. She averred that she carried on the business of a real estate
agent. She brokered a sale of the defendants` property at 1 Amber Road for
$2.7m. The contract for sale was concluded between the defendants and the
purchaser on 20 August 1998 and the sale was completed on 21 October 1998.  
  
The plaintiff by this action sued the defendants for her commission of $27,000
(being one per cent (1%) of the purchase price) agreed between the defendants
and herself.  
  
The defendants applied to strike out the plaintiff`s claim on the ground that
it discloses no reasonable cause of action, is frivolous, vexatious or
otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. The defendants` case was that
the plaintiff had no licence under the Auctioneer`s Licences Act (Cap 16) to
carry on her business as a housing agent and was, therefore, in breach of s
9(2) of the Act. Accordingly, the contract between them and the plaintiff was
illegal and cannot be enforced.  
  
The writ was struck out by the deputy registrar of the Subordinate Courts. The
plaintiff appealed to the district judge in chambers. The learned District
Judge Mr Khoo Oon Soo dismissed the appeal and the plaintiff thus appealed
before me against the decision of the learned District Judge. In the course of
argument it became obvious to me that the proper procedure was to apply for a
trial of a preliminary issue. The facts and circumstances here do not merit a
striking out on the ground that the writ discloses no reasonable cause of
action (as the defect is not apparent on the pleadings) or that it was
frivolous or vexatious (in which case different considerations apply).However,
having come thus far, and since my decision on the arguments as presented
achieves the same result, it would be inappropriate and futile to correct that
procedural mistake now.  
  
The issue before me is purely one of law. On the facts as I had set out above,
was the plaintiff entitled to recover the commission through the process of
court? Mr Eric Low for the plaintiff argued very forcefully that a distinction
ought to be drawn between a contract which is prohibited by statute and one in
which is not prohibited whether expressly or by implication. He submitted that
the failure to obtain a licence may be an offence under the Act and renders
the plaintiff liable to be fined for it, but there is nothing in the Act which
expressly or impliedly suggests that a contract made with an unlicensed
housing agent is illegal and cannot be enforced by him.  
  
Mr Low conceded that he will be hard put to argue that an unlicensed doctor
should be permitted to sue for his fees; likewise, an unlicensed architect or
lawyer. He distinguished such cases on the basis that the consequences of
those unlicensed persons may result in serious harm. In this case, he argued,
no harm ensues from the failure of the housing agent who does not obtain a
licence to carry on his business as such. Mr Low may have overlooked the case
of **_Gremaire v Valon_** 2 Camp 143; 170 ER 1110 cited in **_Cope v
Rowlands_** (1836) 2 M & W 149; 150 ER 707 which Mr Assomull referred to at
the hearing. It is not a point of any significance in my view, but it should
be made for the record. In Gremaire Lord Ellenborough held that a surgeon was
entitled to sue for his fees even though he was not licensed. Parke B in
**_Cope v Rowlands_** doubted the correctness of the decision of Lord
Ellenborough, and reminded the parties before him that that case was affirmed
on appeal on a different ground, namely, that there was no evidence that the
surgeon was not licensed.  
  
Mr Assomull submitted that the licensing requirement was not a purely revenue
provision. He argued that the Act was intended to regulate the business of
housing agents and auctioneers, and public policy requires that unlicensed
agents be prevented from seeking the assistance of the courts to enforce their
contracts. Counsel found support in the Canadian case of **Commercial Life
Assurance Co v Drever** [1948] 2 DLR 241 in which the Supreme Court of Canada
ruled that a person holding himself out as a real estate agent cannot support
a claim for commission if he did not possess the requisite licence under the
Real Estate Agents` Licensing Act 1942. This was a very brief judgment and did
not provide sufficient grounds to satisfy Mr Low`s deeply held belief that
unless one can imply a prohibition under the statutory provisions in question,
the mere failure to obtain a licence does not render a contract made by an
unlicensed housing agent unenforceable.  
  
In the course of further arguments Mr Low drew my attention to the decision in
**Foo Kee Boo v Ho Lee Investments (Pte) Ltd** [1988] SLR 620 . That case
concerned a housing developer who executed an option that was not in the
prescribed form under the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Rules.
The Rules there provided that the penalty for breach is the imposition of a
fine or imprisonment. There, the learned judge Grimberg JC was of the view
that the penalties provided under the Rules were the only consequence intended
by the legislature. He found that there was nothing in the Rules or the
Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act which expressly prohibits the
enforcement of a contract that was made in breach of the rules. The learned
judge reviewed various authorities which held that a contract would be
rendered void and unenforceable if that was the intention behind the statutory
provisions in question. The relevant portion of his decision is found at p 628
as follows:

> _I turn to apply the principles set out above to the facts of the present
> case. The rule as to the form of options was imposed as a condition of the
> granting to the defendants of their licence - see s 21(ii)(d) of the Act.
> Breach of the rule could have been serious or trivial. It could have
> resulted in a fine of up to $5,000 and/or six months` imprisonment - r 20
> or, if charged as a breach of the licence, to a fine not exceeding $20,000 -
> s 4(8) of the Act. I take the view that liability to penalty or imprisonment
> was the only consequence intended by the Act and the Rules to flow from a
> breach of the Rules. To hold that any breach, however trivial, rendered the
> contract void could lead to absurdity. Were this the result it would have
> been open not only to the purchaser but also the developer to invoke the
> invalidity of the contract. This cannot, in my view, have been the intention
> of the legislature._

> _I am fortified in my view by the fact that the Act does not provide
> expressly that an option or agreement that arises from it, is incapable of
> enforcement if a statutory offence is committed in that the prescribed forms
> have not been used._

  
  
I am of the view that the facts and circumstances in **_Foo Kee Boo_** `s case
is entirely different. I am loathe to distinguish a decision of a lawyer and
judge, especially one who is as well regarded as the learned Mr Grimberg,
without stating precisely why I do so. I begin with the obvious observation
that the nature and objectives of statutes may differ from one to the other.
In **_Foo Kee Boo_** the offending conduct was the use of a wrong form which,
in the learned judge`s view, did not prejudice the substance of the private
contract between the plaintiff purchaser and the defendant vendor. There were
sufficiently serious sanctions under the statute concerned in the event of a
breach of the statute and its by-laws, including the penalty of imprisonment.
In this case before me the only penalty is a fine of no more than $2,000. The
difference in the respective penal provisions is, in my view, significant for
reasons which I shall elaborate shortly. I have no disagreement with the views
of Mr Grimberg on the broad principles or the authorities cited by him.
Indeed, I find comfort in the brief passage from the judgment of Lord Wright
in the **Vita Food Products Inc v Unus Shipping Co Ltd** [1939] AC 277, cited
by Mr Grimberg in his decision:

> _[T]he rule by which contracts not expressly forbidden by statute or
> declared void are in proper cases nullified for disobedience to a statute is
> a rule of public policy only, and public policy understood in a wider sense
> may at times be better served by refusing to nullify a bargain save on
> serious and sufficient grounds._

  
  
I accept that public policy is best gauged through the parliamentary pulse;
and when it becomes necessary to determine what public policy, if any, a
legislative enactment was intended to pursue, the purpose of the licensing
requirements of the Act in question must be considered to be of paramount
importance. The Act in this case seeks to regulate and control persons
carrying on the business of housing agents. It provides expressly that on one
may carry on such a business unless licensed. The prohibition against carrying
on such a business encapsulates a prohibition against making contracts which
form the very business itself. The licensing requirement in the Auctioneers`
Licences Act is more than merely a revenue generating provision as Mr Low
argued. Section 14 of the Act clearly envisages a policing policy. The Act
prohibits certain persons (such as a person who has committed a of breach of
trust) from carrying on the business of a housing agent or appraiser as the
case may be. Thus, the licensing regime was enacted to ensure integrity of the
licensees for the protection of the public. It is not right to allow an
unlicensed housing agent to enforce his contractual rights ($27,000 in this
case) with the court`s assistance when the maximum fine for his offence is
only $2,000. The payment of the fine in these circumstances becomes a gesture
of mockery instead of the penalty that it was intended to be. The test, as Mr
Grimberg aptly put in **_Foo Kee Boo_** , is whether the aims of the [Housing
and Developers] Act would be promoted. In the case before him, he found that
it would not be if the contract there in question was invalidated. I am of the
view that the aims of the Auctioneers` Licences Act in this case would not be
promoted if the unlicensed agent is able to enforce his contract; a contract
which under the Act he has no business to make. I am, therefore, of the view
that it is contrary to public policy for the courts to assist the unlicensed
agent in collecting his fees. The contract itself may not be void, but I think
that it is certainly unenforceable by the agent. Whether it could be enforced
by the client if he seeks to recover money already paid is not the issue
before me, but I should think that that answer also depends on the facts and
circumstances of the case.  
  
I should, in passing, say that the conduct of the defendants in this case is
not a material or relevant consideration. It is natural to attach some odium
to a party who reaps the benefits of his contract but does not perform his
part of the bargain, but Mr Assomull tells me that the agreement between the
defendants and the plaintiff was that no fee was payable in respect of the
property in this case because the parties had agreed that in consideration of
the waiver of the fees by the plaintiff, the defendants would let him manage
their other and future properties. Whether this is true can only be decided
after a proper enquiry, but the determination of the point of law before me
has rendered that enquiry unnecessary.  
  
For the reasons above, this appeal was dismissed.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
