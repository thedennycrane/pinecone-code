: This was an appeal by the prosecution against the acquittal of the
respondent, who was charged with the offence of abetting one Ong Soon Chye, by
instigating him to commit an offence of giving false evidence in a stage of a
judicial proceeding. After hearing counsel from both sides, I allowed the
appeal and convicted the respondent. I now give my reasons.  
  
**_The charge_**

****

The respondent, Ng Ai Tiong (`Ng`), who was also known as Francis Ng, had
claimed trial to the following charge:

> _DAC 28311/98_

> _You, Ng Ai Tiong, m/49 years, NRIC No 10706049/F are charged that you, on
> or about 24 March 1997, at Plaza Hotel Singapore, did abet one Ong Soon Chye
> (bearer of NRIC No 0050101/H) by instigating Ong Soon Chye to commit an
> offence of giving false evidence in a stage of judicial proceeding, to wit,
> you instigated Ong Soon Chye to agree to state that he had taken a loan from
> one Yong Pin Khing Jeremy (`Jeremy Yong`) (bearer of NRIC No S 0409692/D),
> which statement and circumstance you knew to be false, and which false
> statement and false circumstance was intended by yourself to be used in the
> course of your defence in a judicial proceeding, namely, MC Suit No 10427 of
> 1997, which offence was not committed as a result of your abetment, and you
> have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 116 read with s 193 of
> the Penal Code (Cap 224)._

  
  
I noted the trial judge`s observation that the date of the meeting between the
respondent and Ong Soon Chye at Plaza Hotel was erroneously stated in the
charge as 24 March 1997 when the intended date was 24 March 1998. The error
did not, however, cause any confusion or prejudice to either the prosecution
or the respondent as the actual date of the meeting was clear to all parties
concerned and there was no dispute over this fact. As such, there was no
necessity for the court to exercise its powers to make any amendment to the
charge.  
  
**_The facts_**

****

Before going into the facts proper, a summary of the background of the
relationship between the relevant parties involved would be useful here. There
were three main parties concerned with the proceedings, Ng, Jeremy Yong Pin
Khing (`Yong`) and Ong Soon Chye (`Roger Ong`). They were all businessmen who
were acquainted with each other and were friends. It was undisputed that Yong
and Roger Ong were closer friends with each other than either were with Ng.
All three of them were customers of Club 5, a lounge located at the ground
floor of Plaza Hotel, which they would patronise from time to time.  
  
**_The $25,000 loan and the civil suit_**

****

On 5 February 1997, Ng, who was the managing director of Transcity Cargo
System Pte Ltd, borrowed a sum of $25,000 from Yong. The purpose of the loan
and the actual amount received by Ng were matters disputed by the parties.
According to Yong, Ng had told him that he needed a loan to pay for the
release of Ng`s German client`s cargo which had been detained by the Johor
customs for under-declaration. The loan was an interest-free loan which was
meant to be repaid within a few days. Ng, on the other hand, alleged that the
money was for his company`s project in Terminal One of the Changi Airport and
an interest of $1,500 was charged on the loan, with repayment of the sum
borrowed to be made within three months. The parties were, however, able to
agree that the loan was advanced in cash and that Ng had given Yong a
collateral in the form of a cash cheque, dated 5 February 1997, of the amount
$25,000.  
  
Ng subsequently failed to repay the loan despite repeated demands by Yong to
do so. The cash cheque given by Ng was also dishonoured when it was presented.
On 2 June 1997, Yong brought civil proceedings, MC Suit 10427/97 (`the civil
suit`), against Ng to recover the amount owed. In the course of the
proceedings, Yong applied for summary judgment and an affidavit was filed in
support of it. In the affidavit filed in response, Ng raised the defence that
Yong was an illegal moneylender. It was alleged by Ng in this affidavit, that
Yong `had previously over a few drinks mentioned to me that [Yong] had lent
money to various people, one of whom I knew`. Yong then filed a further
affidavit in reply, in which he denied all of the allegations relating to him
being involved in illegal moneylending.  
  
Sometime in October 1997, Yong met up with Roger Ong at the Asia Hotel. During
this meeting, Yong mentioned to Roger Ong the problems he was having with Ng
and that he was going to sue Ng for failing to repay the money that Yong had
lent him. On 5 February 1998, interrogatories were served on Yong by Ng`s
solicitors, which included the following questions:

> _
>
> 2 Have you given loans to other people?
>
> 3 If yes,
>
> (a) What are the particulars of these people?
>
> (b) Was interest charged?
>
> 4 Did you get (sic) a loan to one Roger Ong?
>
> 5 If yes,
>
> (a) give particulars of the loan;
>
> (b) was interest charged.
>
> _

  
  
On 11 March 1998, Ng affirmed his affidavit of evidence in chief for the civil
suit in which he deposed, inter alia, that:

> _
>
> 5 On 4 February 1997 when I was facing some financial problems I decided to
> approach [Yong] for a loan. Previously [Yong] had told me that he had lent
> money to various people. **_One of them was someone I knew called Roger Ong,
> a regular patron of Club 5._** [Yong] had told me that he had a lot of
> shares in listed companies especially Plaza Hotel and lots of spare cash to
> invest ... [Emphasis mine.]
>
> _

  
  
This affidavit was filed only later on 30 March 1998 and served on Yong`s
solicitors on 31 March 1998.  
  
**_The alleged abetment by Ng_**

****

On the evening of 24 March 1998, there was a brief encounter between Ng and
Roger Ong which started in a toilet next to Club 5 and continued into the
corridor outside which led to the club. It was the statements made and
questions asked by Ng in the conversation that took place during this occasion
that led to the present charge being brought against him. Slightly different
versions of what exactly took place were proferred by Roger Ong and Ng. The
general gist of Roger Ong`s account was that Ng had asked him whether Yong had
lent him (Roger) money with interest, that Ng mentioned that Yong had told Ng
about the loan to Roger and that Roger need not worry about admitting to
taking such a loan. It was Roger Ong`s evidence that Ng persisted in asking
him to say yes to his question despite the fact that Roger Ong had clearly
replied in the negative. Roger Ong said that he was under the impression that
Ng needed him to say that he had taken a loan from Yong. Roger Ong also said
that Ng mentioned that Yong was suing him. On Ng`s part, he did not deny that
he asked Roger Ong whether Yong had lent Roger Ong money and that he repeated
this question. Ng also admitted that he said that Yong had mentioned to him
about the loan to Roger Ong. Ng further remarked that he had borrowed money
from Yong and that Yong was after him. Ng, however, disagreed that he insisted
on Roger Ong giving him a positive reply to his question. Ng`s explanation was
that he repeated the question so that Roger Ong could understand it and Roger
Ong had replied that he would talk to Yong for Ng. Ng denied that he
volunteered information to Roger Ong about the civil suit and that when he
said that Yong was `after him`, what he meant were the demands that Yong had
made on the telephone to Ng for the repayment of the loan, and this was not
intended as a reference to the civil suit.  
  
Soon after the incident, on 27 March 1998, Roger Ong telephoned Yong on his
handphone to inform him that he had met Ng outside Club 5. Yong had
immediately replied that he needed to meet Roger Ong and show him some
documents. This was a short telephone conversation as Yong was in China at
that time. Yong and Roger Ong met up a couple of days later on the morning of
30 March 1998 at Yong`s office. Yong said he took out the documents relating
to the civil suit and showed them to Roger Ong. Roger Ong recalled that he was
shown selected parts of the affidavit affirmed by Ng on 21 August 1997 and the
interrogatories where his name appeared. Roger Ong was concerned that he would
become involved in the civil suit between Ng and Yong and he was shocked and
angry at the way Ng had made use of his name. Roger Ong was also frightened
and worried for himself and his family as he feared that loan sharks may be
involved and he was afraid that Ng may use his name in other cases where Ng
had also borrowed money. Roger Ong thus decided to file a police report as he
wanted to clear his name and dissociate himself from Yong and Ng on this
matter. Roger Ong then went to the nearby Jalan Besar Neighbouhood Police Post
and made a police report at about 10am on the same day. The police report made
was in the following terms:

> _On 24/3/98 at 2130 hrs at Plaza Hotel, I met (1) Francis Ng._

> _Which he mention that whether Jeremy Yong Pin Khing has lend me money with
> interest._

> _Which I told him `No such thing`._

> _But he force me to say yes and do not worry._

> _Which I do not understand his intention._

> _On the 27/3/98 I called my friend Mr Yong (2) on his handphone and told him
> what happen the night I met Francis Ng, and Mr Yong suggested we meet on
> 30/3/98 to show me document regarding his civil case against Mr Ng._

> _I am shock to see my name used by Mr Ng in his defence, without my
> knowledge._

> _I will further take civil action against Mr Ng for wrongfully using my name
> for his cheating of my friend money._

> _The particulars of persons included:_

> _
>
> (1) Francis Ng Ai Tiong I/C 1076049/F
>
> (2) Yong Pin Khing, Jeremy I/C 0409692/D
>
> _

> _That`s all_

  
  
After Roger Ong made the police report, he went with Yong to see Yong`s
lawyer. Roger Ong spoke to Yong`s lawyer and sought advice on how he should
deal with this matter. Roger Ong was advised by the lawyer to make an
affidavit of evidence in chief which he affirmed the next day on 31 March
1998. He was, however, not advised as to the nature of the interrogatories as
well as the fact that, in making the affidavit, he would be a witness for Yong
if the civil suit went to trial. As for Yong, he was present during this
meeting between Roger Ong and Yong`s lawyer. He too made his own affidavit of
evidence in chief on the same day, 30 March 1998.  
  
The civil suit in question did not eventually proceed to trial. On 9 July
1998, the first day scheduled for the commencement of the trial, the parties
managed to reach a settlement and a consent judgment was entered against Ng in
the following terms:

> _
>
> 1 The defendant do pay the plaintiff the sum of $25,000 and costs of $7,000
> in full and final settlement of this suit by way of instalments of $1,500
> per month payable on the 1st day of every month commencing 1 August 1998, by
> direct payment into such bank account as shall be nominated by the
> plaintiff.
>
> 2 In the event of default of payment of any instalment, the balance debt
> becomes due and payable immediately in which event, the plaintiff is
> entitled to commence enforcement or such other relevant proceedings
> immediately.
>
> 3 The defendant shall file an affidavit within one (1) week from the date
> hereof which shall depose as follows:
>
> `I withdraw the contents of all my affidavits filed in respect of this suit
> for the purpose of an amicable settlement.`
>
> _

  
  
In accordance with para 3 of the consent order, Ng filed an affidavit
containing the required deposition. However, Ng immediately defaulted in his
payments and did not pay Yong anything at all. Upon the petition of Yong, Ng
was made a bankrupt.  
  
**_Ingredients of the charge_**

****

The principal offence which Ng was charged with abetting was the offence of
giving or fabricating false evidence for use in any stage of a judicial
proceeding, which is punishable under s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). As
for the charge that Ng was facing, it was for an inchoate offence since the
person alleged to be instigated, Roger Ong, did not give any false evidence or
statement which Ng had allegedly wanted him to give. The trial judge correctly
pointed out that this was immaterial, however, since an offence of abetment
could still be made out even if the act abetted was not committed. Section
108, Penal Code, makes this clear by providing, inter alia, that:

> _A person abets an offence who abets either the commission of an offence, or
> the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person
> capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge
> as that of the abettor...._

> _Explanation 2_

> _To constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act
> abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the
> offence should be caused._

  
  
On the present facts, in order to establish the guilt of Ng under the charge,
the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following
ingredients:

(i) the statement that Roger Ong had taken a loan from Yong was false;

(ii) Ng knew such statement to be false;

(iii) Ng instigated Roger Ong to make the false statement; and

(iv) Ng intended to use such false statement in the civil suit.  
  
**_Whether the statement was false_**

****

The statement that Roger Ong was alleged to have been abetted by Ng to make
was that he (Roger) had taken a loan from Yong. Other than the oral
testimonies of Yong, Roger Ong and Ng, there was no evidence before the court
to prove the truth of the statement. This being the case, the inquiry here was
essentially an examination of one party`s word against the other`s. At the
outset, I would state that the affidavit filed by Ng in accordance with para 3
of the consent judgment given for the civil suit, the terms of which have been
reproduced earlier, whereby he withdrew the contents of all his affidavits
filed in respect of the suit, did not amount to an admission by Ng that the
statements and allegations he made therein were untrue. I agreed with the
trial judge`s view that the withdrawal was made only `for the purpose of an
amicable settlement` and thus I was not inclined to draw any adverse
inferences against Ng on this basis alone.  
  
The evidence given by both sides at the trial below was understandably
conflicting. The existence of such a loan was adamantly denied by both Yong
and Roger Ong. On the other hand, Ng alleged that he knew of Yong`s loan to
Roger Ong as both of them had told him about it. It was Ng`s evidence that
Yong had previously mentioned over some drinks that he had given loans to
other persons. During his cross-examination, Ng further gave an account of how
Roger Ong had told him about the loan and the amount involved. In the court
below, the trial judge noted that Ng`s assertions on Roger Ong telling him
about the loan were never put to Roger Ong, who therefore had no opportunity
to respond to the allegations made. This seriously undermined Ng`s assertions
and led to the trial judge concluding that Roger Ong did not tell Ng that he
had borrowed money from Yong. On the weight of the evidence before him, the
trial judge found that Roger Ong did not in fact take a loan from Yong and
that any statement to that effect would be false.  
  
The question of whether Roger Ong had indeed taken a loan, interest bearing or
otherwise, from Yong was one involving a finding of fact. At this juncture, it
would be appropriate to set out briefly the well-established principles
governing an appellate court`s decision to overturn findings of facts made by
the trial judge. It is trite law that an appellate court will generally be
reluctant to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where
they turn on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of
witnesses. In the recent case of **Tan Hung Yeoh v PP** [1999] 3 SLR 93 , I
had summarised the relevant principles as follows [at [para ] 23]:

> _The principles governing an appellate court`s role in reviewing a trial
> judge`s findings of fact are well settled. In**Lim Ah Poh v PP** [1992] 1
> SLR 713 , FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal
> Appeal, held at p 719:_

> _`**An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are
> clearly reached against the weight of the evidence**. In examining the
> evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither
> seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges`
> findings and their reasons therefor.`_

> _This principle has been endorsed repeatedly in numerous local High Court
> and Court of Appeal decisions: see for eg**Soh Yang Tick v PP** [1998] 2 SLR
> 43 , **Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP** [1997] 3 SLR 464 , **Yap Giau Beng
> Terence v PP** [1998] 3 SLR 656 , **Ng Soo Hin v PP** [1994] 1 SLR 105  and
> **Lee Tiaw Chwee v PP** [1998] 3 SLR 563 ._

> _**It is thus clear that a trial judge`s findings of fact will only be
> overturned by the appellate court if they are clearly wrong.** [Emphasis
> added.]_

  
  
Bearing in mind the fact that the respondent, Ng, did not dispute this finding
in the appeal since the ultimate decision reached by the trial judge was in
his favour, and that there was no suggestion that the judge was clearly wrong
in reaching this conclusion, I was satisfied that the finding was not made
against the weight of the evidence and therefore there was no reason to
disturb it.  
  
**_Whether Ng knew that the statement was false_**

****

Having reached his earlier conclusion by accepting the evidence of Yong and
Roger Ong, and rejecting that of Ng, the trial judge went on to hold that Ng
must also have known that any such statement that Roger Ong had taken a loan
from Yong was false. In view of my determination on the earlier finding of
fact and that the respondent was similarly not disputing this part of the
decision by the trial judge, I did not see any reason or necessity to disturb
this factual finding.  
  
**_Instigation_**

****

Next, I considered the question of whether there was any instigation by Ng, an
inquiry which was the main focus of the parties` arguments as the decision
below turned essentially on this particular finding. To summarise briefly, it
was the prosecution`s case that the events that took place on the evening of
24 March 1998, outside Club 5, showed that Ng had abetted Roger Ong by
instigating him to admit to a falsehood, namely, that Roger Ong had taken a
loan from Yong.  
  
Considering that the determination of this point could be pivotal to the
result of this appeal, it was imperative to carefully examine the law on
`instigation`. The applicable principles of law on what amounts to abetment by
instigation are well-settled. The question of what constitutes `instigation`
was considered in the local case of **_PP v Lim Tee Hia_** n [1992] 1 SLR 45,
where Lai Kew Chai J held:

> _The offence of abetment by instigation was considered in at least two
> Malaysian cases dealing with abetment by instigation under s 107 of the
> Penal Code (FMS Cap 45) which is in pari materia with the equivalent kind of
> abetment under s 107 of our Code. In**PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris &
> Ors** [1977] 1 MLJ 180 , Abdoolcader J (as he then was) stated at p 196:_

> _`**Instigation consists of acts which amount to active suggestion or
> support or stimulation for the commission of the main act or offence**.
> Advice can become instigation if that advice is meant to actively suggest or
> stimulate the commission of an offence: **Ragunath Das v Emperor** [1920] 21
> Cr LJ 213.`_

> _**In my view, mere acquiescence or silence is not sufficient to constitute
> the offence of abetment by instigation. That the prosecution must show that
> there has been active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement to
> make good the offence of abetment by instigation** was affirmed by Raja
> Azlan Shah CJ (as he then was) in **Haji Abdul Ghani bin Ishak & Anor v PP**
> [1981] 2 MLJ 230  at p 248 in the following terms:_

> _`In fact it is an essential ingredient in a prosecution for abetment
> that**there must be some evidence to show that the abettor actively
> suggested or stimulated the principal offender to the act by any means or
> language, direct or indirect, in the form of "expressed solicitation" or of
> "hints, insinuations or encouragement". ... The word "instigates" in s 107
> of the Penal Code does not merely mean placing of temptation to do a
> forbidden thing but actively stimulating a person to do it** ...` [Emphasis
> added.]_

  
  
In **_Gour`s Penal Law of India_** (10th Ed) Vol I at p 937-940, the learned
authors wrote:

> _

Under the charge as framed, the prosecution must be able to establish that Ng
instigated Roger Ong to admit to a falsehood, ie that Roger Ong had loaned
money from Yong before. In the decision below, the trial judge was of the view
that the element of `instigation` had not been made out on the facts. He held
that there was no instigation by Ng of Roger Ong to either give evidence in
the civil suit or to make a statement, such as an affidavit, for Ng`s use in
the civil proceedings. The trial judge appeared to place much emphasis on the
fact that Roger Ong himself had admitted as much that Ng never expressly asked
him to give evidence as a witness or make any statement for Ng to use in the
civil suit. The trial judge opined that it was unlikely for Ng to have done so
anyway since he was well aware that Yong and Roger Ong were good friends and
it would have been silly of Ng to ask Roger Ong to give false evidence against
Yong. I observed that the fact that Ng did not directly express to Roger Ong
his intention, if any, to make use of the statement in the civil suit was
crucial to the trial judge`s finding as he seemed to be of the opinion that,
in order for the element of `instigation` to be established on the present
facts, it must be shown that Roger Ong had either the intention or knowledge
of the use of the statement, had he been willing to admit to it, in the civil
suit.  
  
A query thus arose as to whether it was necessary for the prosecution to prove
that the person abetted, Roger Ong in this case, had the requisite intention
or knowledge for the commission of the principal offence. Or to put it in a
different manner, must it be shown that the abettor had expressly made known
his criminal intention to the person abetted. It was submitted by the
prosecution that the answers to the above questions must be in the negative.
The prosecution referred to s 108 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) to support their
proposition that a person could be guilty of abetting an offence even though
the person abetted did not have the same extent of knowledge or intent as the
abettor. The relevant portion of s 108 reads as follows:

> _Explanation 3_

> _It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of
> committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or
> knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge._

> _Illustrations_

> _
>
> ...
>
> (d) **_A_** , intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to
> take property belonging to **_Z_** out of **_Z_** `s possession. A induces B
> to believe that the property belongs to **_A_**. **_B_** takes the property
> out of Z`s possession, in good faith believing it to be **_A_** `s property.
> **_B_** , acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and
> therefore does not commit theft. But **_A_** is guilty of abetting theft,
> and is liable to the same punishment as if **_B_** had committed theft.
>
> _

  
  
Relying on the above provision, the prosecution contended that the intention
and/or knowledge of Roger Ong was actually immaterial to the question of
whether there was any instigation by Ng. The relevant fact that ought to be
investigated should instead be the intention of Ng when he persistently
pressed Roger Ong for an affirmative reply to his questions on the night of 24
March 1998.  
  
In the attempt to counteract the above assertion, Ng`s counsel referred to an
interpretation of the word `instigate` as advocated in the Indian case of
**Baby John v State** [1953] Cri LJ 1273 where the court had held, at p 1274:

> _In interpreting the meaning of the word `instigate` in the case that is
> reported in**Emperor v Amruddin Salebhoy Tyabjee** [1923] AIR 44, the
> learned Chief Justice Macleod CJ in the course of his judgment quotes an
> extract from **Russell on Crimes** where the word `instigation` is
> explained. The learned judge quotes the following passage:_

> _`A person is said to instigate another to an act when he actively suggests
> or stimulates him to the act by any means or language direct or indirect,
> whether it takes the form of express solicitation or of hints, insinuation
> or encouragement`_

> _Applying the meaning of the word `instigate` as explained in**Russell on
> Crimes** , **it is not necessary that express and direct words should be
> used to indicate what exactly should be done by the persons to whom
> directions are given by a person in the position of the first accused.**
> [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
The words of an Act of Parliament must be given effect to and, having heard
the arguments of both sides on this particular issue, I found that I must
agree with the submissions of the prosecution. The query was evidently
answered by reference to the plain words of Explanation 3 of s 108 of the
Penal Code, which removes any doubt that one may have on this matter. However,
I must add that inasmuch as I fully agreed with the meaning of the word
`instigate`, as adopted in the Indian case which Ng`s counsel cited, I failed
to see how such a definition assisted the respondent`s case. The
interpretation was expressed in very wide terms and the part of the extract
which I have highlighted earlier made it patently clear that it was not
necessary for the abettor to express directly to the person abetted what
exactly was to be done. From the above conclusion, it was thus immaterial that
Ng did not expressly tell Roger Ong to assist him in the civil suit by
admitting to the false statement or of his intentions to rely on the false
statement from Roger Ong to his benefit in the civil suit. It was also
immaterial whether or not Roger Ong had any knowledge of Ng`s true intentions
in asking him those questions on 24 March 1998. As contended by the
prosecution, the focus of the court`s inquiry should instead be on the
intention of the abettor himself at the time of the alleged instigation.  
  
Having examined in detail the facts and evidence put forward by the parties, I
was convinced that Ng`s intention and motive, during the encounter with Roger
Ong outside Club 5, was undoubtedly to extract an admission to a falsehood
from Roger Ong, which he would rely on to buttress his defence in the civil
suit. There was no question that such a false statement would certainly have
been most useful in substantiating Ng`s defence in the civil suit that Yong
was engaged in illegal moneylending. In fact, Ng himself had also admitted
that, had Roger Ong agreed that he had taken a loan from Yong, Ng would have
informed his lawyer about this and would have used such a statement in the
civil suit. Just shortly before the 24 March 1998 incident outside Club 5, Ng
had affirmed his affidavit of evidence in chief for the civil suit where he
had reiterated his allegations that Yong had told him that he (Yong) lent
money to various people and one of them was Roger Ong. Judging from the topic
of conversation that Ng chose to harp on during that brief encounter with
Roger Ong, the civil suit and his defence were obviously on Ng`s mind when he
met Roger Ong outside Club 5. The most telling piece of evidence here was the
fact that, in order to get Roger Ong to admit to the falsehood, Ng lied to
Roger Ong about Yong having told him about the loan to Roger Ong. The cunning
nature of Ng did not escape the court`s notice as to how he concocted a story
in the trial below of Roger Ong telling him about the loan and the amount
involved. As pointed out earlier, this fabrication was dismissed by the trial
judge.  
  
Hence, the trial judge was manifestly wrong in holding that all that Ng had
done was to question Roger Ong in a robust manner and nothing more. With
respect, I found the trial judge`s reasoning to be misconceived. Although I
had earlier concluded that it was not necessary to show that Roger Ong had the
guilty intention or knowledge with respect to the use of the false statement,
I nonetheless found on the facts that Roger Ong was clearly aware of the
existence of the civil suit and the relevance that his conversation with Ng
might have on the civil proceedings. During the incident outside Club 5, Ng
had in fact begun the conversation by mentioning the loan that he had taken
from Yong and that Yong was after him for it. Prior to this, Roger Ong had
already been informed by Yong that Yong was going to sue Ng for the return of
the sum loaned. All this and coupled with Roger Ong`s reaction to the incident
by anxiously contacting Yong to notify him about the encounter with Ng, showed
that Roger Ong was conscious of the significance of Ng`s questioning and its
relation to the civil suit between Ng and Yong. This being the case, then
Roger Ong would certainly have been guilty of giving false evidence in any
stage of a judicial proceeding if he had given in to Ng`s relentless prodding
and had admitted to the false statement.  
  
In the result, I was satisfied that the element of `instigation` had been
established by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. Ng`s persistence in
continuing to question Roger Ong despite the unequivocal reply and his attempt
to trap Roger Ong into making the false statement by lying about what Yong had
said, all went beyond active suggestion to Roger Ong to admit to the
falsehood. In the light of all the incontrovertible evidence, I was persuaded
that Ng`s actions on 24 March 1998, outside Club 5, amounted to an instigation
of Roger Ong to admit to a falsehood which Ng had intended to use in the civil
suit, albeit that this ultimately turned out to be an unsuccessful venture by
Ng.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

As all the ingredients of the charge were established on the evidence, I
allowed the appeal. Since full proceedings had been conducted in the court
below, I saw no necessity to send the case back to trial and there was no
prejudice caused to the accused in not doing so. Accordingly, I found Ng to be
guilty as charged and, taking into account all the circumstances, sentenced
him to a term of one year`s imprisonment.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
