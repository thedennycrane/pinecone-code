Court of Appeal — Originating Summons No 9 of 2018  
Tay Yong Kwang JA and Belinda Ang Saw Ean J  
26 November 2018

Tay Yong Kwang JA (delivering the judgment of the court):

1 The applicant, Mr Ho Soo Fong (“Mr Ho”), was a director and 75% shareholder
of Ho Pak Kim Realty Pte Ltd (“HPK”). HPK was the plaintiff in an action
against the respondent, Revitech Pte Ltd (“Revitech”) in Suit No 36 of 2006
(“S 36/2006”). On 2 August 2010, following the determination of liability in S
36/2006, the court ordered costs to Revitech on its counterclaim. It also
ordered that, in the event HPK was unable or unwilling to pay Revitech costs
when taxed or agreed, Revitech would be at liberty, after giving due notice to
Mr Ho, to make Mr Ho pay such costs personally (“the Costs Order”) on the
basis that Mr Ho was the alter ego and the moving force behind HPK.

2 On 24 May 2017, Mr Ho filed Originating Summons No 563 of 2017 (“OS 563”)
seeking to be added as a party to S 36/2006 and to set aside the Costs Order.
OS 563 was heard and dismissed by Lai Siu Chiu SJ (“the Judge”) on 29 January
2018.

3 Before us, Mr Ho sought an extension of time to file and serve a notice of
appeal against the Judge’s decision in OS 563. Having heard from the parties,
we dismissed Mr Ho’s application on the basis that OS 563 was devoid of merit
and had no prospect of success. OS 563 was simply an attempt to re-open
matters that have long been concluded. We now set out the facts and the brief
reasons for our decision.

Brief facts and procedural history

4 We provide here a summary of the salient events in this matter. A more
detailed chronology appears in the annexure at the end of our grounds of
decision.

5 In 2006, HPK commenced S 36/2006 against Revitech over a construction
dispute. Revitech filed a counterclaim. Mr Ho was HPK’s representative during
the trial and was its main factual witness. The trial was heard in three
tranches. On 2 August 2010, after the conclusion of the trial, the Judge
ordered costs on a standard basis against HPK on Revitech’s counterclaim. She
also made the Costs Order.

6 On 30 September 2010, the Court of Appeal heard HPK’s appeal from S 36/2006.
The appeal was in the main dismissed although the Court of Appeal directed
that the Costs Order be suspended pending the assessment of damages, with
liberty to either party to apply after the completion of the assessment of
damages.

7 Damages were eventually assessed in Revitech’s favour. The suspended Costs
Order came up for further consideration before the Court of Appeal on 11 July
2014 (“the 11 July 2014 hearing”). As HPK’s solicitors had been discharged
prior to this hearing, Mr Ho represented HPK at the hearing. Mr Ho addressed
the Court of Appeal on the merits of the Costs Order. After hearing Mr Ho and
Revitech, the Court of Appeal restored the suspended Costs Order.

8 Dissatisfied with the Court of Appeal’s decision at the 11 July 2014
hearing, HPK filed several applications in 2014 and 2015 supported by
affidavits by Mr Ho seeking to set aside, stay and vary the decision. 1

See SUM 3656/2014, filed on 21 July 2014; SUM 6346/2014, filed on 12 December
2014; and SUM 210/2015 filed on 12 August 2015.

At the hearing of each of these applications, HPK (represented by Mr Ho) was
again given the opportunity to address the Court of Appeal. These applications
were dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

9 The costs in the Costs Order were eventually taxed on 23 August 2016. HPK
and Mr Ho filed an application to set aside the taxation and in the
alternative, to obtain an extension of time to apply for a review of the
taxation. This was dismissed on 3 May 2017. 2

See BC 152/2010 and SUM 1455/2017, filed in BC 152/2010 on 28 March 2017.

10 On 24 May 2017, Mr Ho filed OS 563 seeking to be added as a party to S
36/2006 and to set aside the Costs Order. While OS 563 was underway, the
Attorney-General (the “AG”) applied pursuant to s 74 of the Supreme Court of
Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) to restrain Mr Ho (and HPK)
from continuing proceedings connected with S 36/2006 on the basis that Mr Ho
was a vexatious litigant. Mr Ho consented to the AG’s application and a
consent order was recorded (“the vexatious litigant order”).

11 As a result of the vexatious litigant order, Mr Ho required leave of court
to continue with OS 563. He therefore applied ex parte for such leave and his
application was granted by Chan Seng Onn J (“Chan J”). 3

See SUM 1220/2017, filed on 26 October 2017.

12 On 29 January 2018, OS 563 was heard and dismissed by the Judge. Because of
the vexatious litigant order, Mr Ho also needed to obtain leave of court
before he could appeal against the Judge’s dismissal of OS 563. Mr Ho again
applied ex parte for such leave and it was granted by Chan J on 13 March 2018.

See OS 223/2018, filed on 22 February 2018.

13 On 28 March 2018, about a month after his time to appeal against OS 563 had
lapsed, Mr Ho filed his current application before us seeking an extension of
time to file and serve his notice of appeal.

Our decision

14 A court faced with an application for extension of time should consider
four factors: (a) the length of the delay; (b) the reasons for the delay; (c)
the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing were extended; and
(d) the prejudice caused to the would-be respondent if an extension of time
was in fact granted: see Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and
others and another suit [2008] 1 SLR(R) 757 (“Lee Hsien Loong”) at [28].

15 On the facts of this case, the primary consideration was whether Mr Ho’s
intended appeal against OS 563 was so hopeless that granting an extension of
time would really be an exercise in futility and a waste of time and costs. In
our view, OS 563 had no chance of success.

16 Although counsel for Mr Ho raised several issues before us and in OS 563,
his main contention was that Mr Ho was not given an opportunity to address the
court on 2 August 2010 on the Costs Order before it was made as he was not a
party to the proceedings in S 36/2006. 5

Applicant’s Skeletal Submissions in OS 563, dated 23 January 2018, at paras
8–9 and 23; Applicant’s Skeletal Submissions for the Applicant’s Application
for Extension of Time to File and Serve Notice of Appeal in OS 9/2018 (“Mr
Ho’s OS 9 Submissions”), dated 10 May 2018, at paras 8–9 and 33.

In fact, Mr Ho claimed that he had notice of the Costs Order only as late as
23 August 2016 when costs were taxed.

17 Mr Ho’s claims could not be correct. He would have been the person
instructing HPK’s counsel at the hearing on costs on 2 August 2010 and he did
not allege that his then counsel failed to inform him about the Costs Order
after it was made by the Judge. Mr Ho was not only present at the 11 July 2014
hearing concerning the Costs Order, he also represented HPK. It is plain to us
that Mr Ho was aware of the Costs Order by 11 July 2014 at the latest.

18 The documentary evidence on record – including Mr Ho’s own affidavits filed
in support of HPK’s subsequent successive applications to challenge the Costs
Order – proved this to be so. In his affidavit dated 21 July 2014, Mr Ho
detailed exchanges between himself and the Court of Appeal at the 11 July 2014
hearing. At that hearing, Mr Ho addressed the Court of Appeal on why he should
not be made personally liable for costs. The suspended Costs Order was
explained to Mr Ho and was then restored. On at least three further occasions
after 11 July 2014, Mr Ho had the opportunity to ventilate his case on the
Costs Order before the Court of Appeal. There could therefore be no doubt that
Mr Ho had notice of the Costs Order by 11 July 2014 at the latest and had been
heard on the same issue several times. Indeed, many of the grounds raised
before us appeared to have similarly been raised before the Court of Appeal on
those prior occasions.

19 Mr Ho’s application in OS 563 was merely another attempt to re-open the
proceedings in S 36/2006 and the Court of Appeal’s decision on the Costs
Order. Such matters have long been concluded. In our view, the Judge was
therefore entirely justified in dismissing OS 563. Mr Ho’s appeal against the
Judge’s dismissal of OS 563 would ultimately be a non-starter. Accordingly, we
dismissed his application.

Observations on the ex parte proceedings

20 Before we conclude, we think it is useful to address one other point
canvassed by counsel for Mr Ho. As Mr Ho was subject to the vexatious litigant
order, he had to satisfy the High Court that his intended proceedings were not
an abuse of process of the court and that there was a prima facie ground for
the proceedings: s 74(1)(b) of the SCJA. It was submitted that since Mr Ho had
succeeded in obtaining leave to continue proceedings in the two applications
before Chan J, OS 563 could not be an abuse of process and had a prima facie
chance of success. 6

Mr Ho’s OS 9 Submissions, at paras 15 and 24; see also Ho Soo Fong’s affidavit
in OS 9/2018, dated 28 March 2018, at paras 26 and 29.

21 Mr Ho’s applications were made ex parte, in Revitech’s absence. The court’s
attention was not brought to the fact that Mr Ho had had the opportunity to
address the Court of Appeal on multiple occasions on the merits of the Costs
Order. Mr Ho’s affidavits and submissions before Chan J claimed that he had
notice of the Costs Order only on 23 August 2016, which, as shown above, could
not be correct. They made no mention of the 11 July 2014 hearing or his three
applications thereafter to set aside, stay and vary the Costs Order. Other
than a cursory reference to Mr Ho’s affidavit filed in OS 563, which in turn
made passing reference to the Court of Appeal’s reinstatement of the Costs
Order, none of the materials either directly or indirectly explained that the
Court of Appeal had considered and upheld the Costs Order after submissions
were made on whether Mr Ho should be made to pay costs personally. Had the
full history of the proceedings been brought to the court’s attention, leave
to continue might not have been granted as OS 563 and the intended appeal from
its dismissal would be frivolous and completely hopeless in merit. In those
circumstances, Mr Ho could not rely on the ex parte proceedings as evidence of
the merits of his proposed appeal from OS 563.

Conclusion

22 For the above reasons we dismissed the present application with costs.
After hearing the parties on costs, we ordered Mr Ho to pay Revitech costs
fixed at $3,300 inclusive of disbursements, which is the amount that Revitech
asked for. We also made the usual consequential orders on the security for
costs.

**Case Summary**

**_Ho Soo Fong v Revitech Pte Ltd_** **[2018] SGCA 82 _  
_ Court of Appeal Originating Summons No 9 of 2018 **

____________________________________________________________________

**Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Tay Yong
Kwang):**

Outcome: CoA gives its reasons for dismissing an application for extension of
time to appeal on the basis that the putative appeal would have no prospect of
success.

**Introduction**

1 The applicant was a director and shareholder of Ho Pak Kim Realty Pte Ltd
(“HPK”). HPK was the plaintiff in an action against Revitech Pte Ltd
(“Revitech”) in Suit No 36 of 2006 (“S 36/2006”). On 2 August 2010, following
the determination of liability in S 36/2006, the High Court ordered costs to
Revitech on its counterclaim. It also ordered that, in the event HPK was
unable or unwilling to pay Revitech costs when taxed or agreed, Revitech would
be at liberty, after giving due notice to the applicant, to make him pay such
costs personally (“the Costs Order”) on the basis that he was the _alter ego_
and moving force behind HPK.

2 On 24 May 2017, the applicant filed Originating Summons No 563 of 2017 (“OS
563”) seeking to be added as a party to S 36/2006 and to set aside the Costs
Order. OS 563 was heard and dismissed by the High Court on 29 January 2018\.

3 About a month after the time to appeal against OS 563 had lapsed, the
applicant applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to appeal
against the High Court’s dismissal of OS 563. The Court of Appeal dismissed
the application.

**The Court of Appeal’s decision**

4 On the facts of the case, the primary consideration in deciding whether to
grant the extension of time was whether the applicant’s intended appeal
against the dismissal of OS 563 was so hopeless that granting the extension of
time would be an exercise in futility. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the
intended appeal against OS 563 had no chance of success: at **[15]**.

5 The applicant’s main contention was that he had not been given an
opportunity to address the court on 2 August 2010 before the Costs Order was
made. He claimed that he only became aware of the Costs Order on 23 August
2016. However, this could not be correct:

a The applicant would have instructed HPK’s counsel at the costs hearing on 2
August 2010 and did not allege that his then counsel failed to inform him of
the Costs Order after it was made: at **[17]**.

b The applicant was aware of the Costs Order by 11 July 2014 at the latest. On
that date, he represented HPK in a hearing before the Court of Appeal
regarding whether the Costs Order, which had been suspended pending the
assessment of damages in S 36/2006, should be reinstated. At this hearing, the
applicant addressed the Court of Appeal on why he should not be made
personally liable for costs: at **[17]** , **[18]**.

c On at least three further occasions after 11 July 2014, the applicant had
the opportunity to ventilate his case on the Costs Order before the Court of
Appeal. There could therefore be no doubt that the applicant had been heard on
the same issue several times. Indeed, many of the grounds raised before the
Court of Appeal appeared to have similarly been raised before the Court of
Appeal on those prior occasions: at **[18]**.

6 OS 563 was merely another attempt to re-open the proceedings in S 36/2006
and the Court of Appeal’s decision on the Costs Order. Such matters had long
been concluded. The High Court was therefore entirely justified in dismissing
OS 563. The applicant’s appeal against the dismissal of OS 563 would
ultimately be a non-starter. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal refused to grant
the extension of time: at **[19]**.

7 As the applicant was the subject of a vexatious litigant order, he had to
obtain leave from the High Court to continue proceedings in OS 563 and to
pursue his appeal against the High Court’s dismissal of the same. The
applicant submitted that since he had succeeded in obtaining such leave, OS
563 could not be an abuse of process and had a _prima facie_ chance of
success. However, those applications had been made _ex parte_ and the court’s
attention was not brought to the fact that the applicant had previously
addressed the Court of Appeal on multiple occasions on the merits of the Costs
Order. Had the full history of the proceedings been brought to the court’s
attention, leave might not have been granted. In those circumstances, the
applicant could not rely on the _ex parte_ proceedings as evidence of the
merits of his proposed appeal from OS 563: at **[21]**.
