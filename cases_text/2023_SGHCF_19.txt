4401 of 2021  
Choo Han Teck J  
16 February, 20 March 2023

3 April 2023 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff (the “Husband”) and the defendant (the “Wife”) registered
their marriage in Korea on 9 September 1999. The Husband is 58 years old and
is a procurement manager in a multinational corporation. The Wife is 51 years
old and is a hair stylist operating a hair dressing salon. They have one
daughter, born on 2 January 2002 (the “Child”). She is presently 21 years old
and is pursuing her undergraduate studies in Singapore. The Husband filed for
divorce on 16 September 2021 and obtained interim judgment on 16 February
2022. The only issues that remain are the determination of ancillary matters.
Parties had agreed on all issues pertaining to the Child in the interim
judgment. Accordingly, the remaining matters to be decided are the division of
matrimonial assets and the maintenance of the Wife.

Division of Matrimonial Assets

2 The parties had agreed on most of the matrimonial assets (including the
valuation), save for the following assets which parties dispute either as to
their inclusion as matrimonial assets or their valuation:

S/N| Asset| Nature of Dispute  
---|---|---  
1\. | Jointly owned Matrimonial Home| Valuation  
2\. | Husband’s POSB Account| Adverse Inference  
3\. | Wife’s NTUC Insurance| Classification as matrimonial assets  
4\. | Wife’s Prudential Insurance  
  
3 At the hearing on 16 February 2023, counsel for the Wife informed the court
that parties have agreed that the Wife’s insurance policies (items 3 and 4)
shall form part of the matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the remaining assets
to be determined are items 1 and 2.

4 As to the matrimonial home, the Wife says that it should be valued at
$3,8000,000 based on an independent valuation conducted on 17 June 2022. On
the contrary, the Husband says that it should be $3,200,000 based on a
valuation dated 15 March 2022. Both valuations are out-of-date by the time of
this appeal, nine months on. Thus, at the hearing on 16 February 2023, I
directed parties to commission a joint independent valuation report. That
report, produced by CBRE Pte Ltd, values the matrimonial home at $3,520,000 as
at 24 February 2023, which I adopt as the valuation for the purposes of asset
division.

5 The second asset which the parties dispute is the Husband’s POSB Account No
056756914, a joint account with his mother (the “Joint Account”). The issue is
whether an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Husband. Counsel
for the Wife, Ms Tee Lee Lian, submitted that the Joint Account should be
addressed by way of an adverse inference drawn against the Husband instead of
it being added to the matrimonial assets. This is an implicit acceptance that
the that the Joint Account is not a matrimonial asset — neither party had
referred to it previously as part of their matrimonial assets. Counsel invites
me to make a finding that the Husband had breached his duty of full and frank
disclosure which justifies the drawing of an adverse inference, giving her a
10% uplift of all the other known matrimonial assets. In reply, counsel for
the Husband, Mr Trent Ng, says that the Husband had made full and frank
disclosure of his assets. Mr Ng further explained that the Husband had taken
the consistent position that the Joint Account was opened to store his
mother’s life savings and facilitate day to day transactions.

6 An adverse inference may only be drawn if there is evidence establishing a
prima facie case against the Husband, and the Husband has access to the assets
that he is said to be hiding: Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah [2007] SGCA 21.
The Wife’s argument for an adverse inference to be drawn is two-fold. First,
she says that the Husband’s late disclosure of two UOB trading accounts and
three brokerage accounts with the Phillips Online Electronic Mart System
(“POEMS”) was a breach of his duty of full and frank disclosure when he did
not disclose these accounts in his affidavit of assets and means sworn on 5
April 2022, and only disclosed them thereafter on 17 June 2022. Secondly, she
refers to transactions of sizeable amounts in the Joint Account, which she
says are evidence that the Joint Account was not used as the Husband’s
mother’s day-to-day spending account (as he claims), but rather, for the
purpose of share trading and the collection of dividends. This, the Wife says,
is evidence that the Husband has been trading under his mother’s name since
the opening of this Joint Account in 2003, and had amassed certain assets in
her account which he is said to be hiding.

7 On the first ground, although the Husband’s late disclosure of his assets
may be a breach of his duty of disclosure and a relevant consideration for
costs, but not necessarily for the drawing of an adverse inference. A breach
of the duty of full and frank disclosure alone does not automatically result
in the drawing of an adverse inference. As the Court of Appeal held in UZN v
UZM [2021] 1 SLR 246 (“UZN”) at [29]:

[…] What is just and equitable must be seen in the light of the objective of
drawing an adverse inference in this context in the first place – to counter
the effects of non-disclosure of assets which diminishes the value of the
matrimonial pool and thereby places those assets out of the reach of the other
party for the purposes of division under s 112 of the Women’s Charter as
matrimonial assets (see [16] above). The preferred approach should enable the
court to most appropriately reach a just and equitable division of the true
material gains of the parties’ marriage.

An adverse inference is not used as a punishment for breaching the duty of
full and frank disclosure, but to make adjustments to the matrimonial assets
by giving a value to assets which had been hidden, or siphoned from the
matrimonial assets. In this case, notwithstanding the Husband’s failure to
disclose the assets, it is not the Wife’s case that the Husband’s late
disclosure is evidence of undisclosed assets or bank accounts. An adverse
inference cannot usefully be drawn in such circumstances.

8 The second ground that the Wife relies on concerns the transactions of large
sums of monies in the Joint Account. The Wife refers to the withdrawals of
$60,135.56 and $33,815.56 on 4 March 2022, as well as the deposits of
$80,592.30 on 16 July 2021 and $25,007.70 on 23 January 2022. The Wife says
that such significant movements of funds are inconsistent with the Husband’s
explanation that this account was opened to deposit his mother’s savings and
pay for day-to-day living expenses. On this basis, the Wife invites the court
to draw an adverse inference that the Husband has been using his mother as a
front to amass a sizeable amount of money in his mother’s share trading
account. The Wife says that since the mother’s share trading account was not
disclosed, an uplift of 10% to the Wife’s share of the assets is justified.

9 I agree with the Wife that the Husband’s explanation for the joint account
is not consistent with the value of the withdrawals. But the Joint Account was
not considered a matrimonial asset by the parties. Accordingly, transactions
within those accounts, whatever the amount, is irrelevant to an adverse
inference against the Husband, which concerns dissipation out of the
matrimonial assets. What the Wife must show is that the Husband had been
dissipating funds from matrimonial assets into that Joint Account with his
mother, and not transactions within those accounts. This, however, has not
been established by the Wife. In fact, the Wife’s case was one step removed —
not that the Joint Account was a matrimonial asset, but that the transactions
in the Joint Account suggested that the Husband had been using his mother’s
trading account to hide his assets. It is not disputed that the mother’s
trading accounts are not matrimonial assets and were not disclosed. But when I
asked Ms Tee whether discovery was sought over these trading accounts, it was
conceded that this was not done. An adverse inference cannot be used as a
remedy to a lapse by the party in the interlocutory process. If it is the
Wife’s case that the Husband had been using his mother’s account to amass his
own wealth, the burden lies on her to seek discovery over the documents
necessary to prove her case. I therefore decline to draw an adverse inference
against the Husband concerning the Joint Account.

10 Nonetheless, I find that the Husband’s counsel’s attempt to use an
affidavit that had been sworn but not filed, to be unacceptable. At the
hearing on 20 March 2023, he produced an affidavit sworn but not filed by the
Husband. It contained the details of the Husband’s mother’s trading accounts.
Counsel wanted to use that in defence against the Wife’s call for the drawing
of an adverse inference in regard to activities in that account. He said that
whether they would file that affidavit depended on what orders I make at the
hearing, that means, depending on how persuaded I was by the Wife’s counsel’s
arguments. Arguments, not evidence, may be changed to adapt to the
circumstances as the case progresses. Parties cannot choose to disclose
evidence in instalments, depending on whether the situation has become
desperate enough for them to do so. If they have the evidence, they must
disclose or risk the court rejecting it.

11 The matrimonial assets (including their valuations) are as follows:

S/N| Manner of Holding| Asset| Net Value / in SGD  
---|---|---|---  
1\. | Joint Names| Matrimonial Home| $3,520,000.00  
2\. | Husband’s Name| DBS eMulti-Currency Account| $0.00

Grand Total| $9,354,647.48  
  
Division Ratio

12 The only difference in the parties’ computation of direct financial
contributions was their contributions to the purchase of the matrimonial home
purchased in 2007. The Wife says that their contribution should be attributed
based on their respective holding as tenants-in-common in the ratio of 74%
(Husband): 26% (Wife). The Husband says that their respective contribution is
based on the amount they contributed to the purchase price, which he says
amounts to $1,470,827.01 (Husband): $231,900.00 (Wife). I do not agree with
the Wife’s approach. She is hoping to ascertain the direct contribution of
yesteryears based on today’s valuation. This is incorrect in principle — the
financial contribution of parties should be determined by reference to the
monies expended at the time of acquisition of the matrimonial asset. Since the
global ratio for direct financial contribution is determined by totalling up
the monies applied to the marital partnership by each party, using the current
valuation of the matrimonial home would inflate the raw values contributed for
the purpose of calculating that ratio. Thus, I accept the Husband’s approach
of ascertaining contributions by the amount the parties actually paid.

13 Parties are in general agreement as to their contribution to the
matrimonial home save for three items: the monthly cash repayment toward the
outstanding HSBC mortgage loan, the renovations done to the matrimonial home
and the furniture, fittings and finishings.

14 It was not disputed that the loan for the HSBC mortgage was $448,000.00.
The Husband says that he paid for the entire loan. He produced monthly
repayment statements from April 2011 to March 2016 in support of his
assertion. The Wife says that she has reimbursed the Husband $120,000.00, by
way of cash and telegraphic transfers. Although the Husband exhibited
statements that the payment originated from his account, it does not prove
that the entire mortgage repayment was made by him. It is not inconceivable
that mortgage payments are made by one spouse who then receives a contribution
or reimbursement from the other spouse. That is as convenient as sending money
from a joint account, and more so than sending payments from the spouses
individually.

15 The Wife’s assertion that she paid $450 a month from her CPF account was
made without supporting evidence. Thus, I am unable to accept this assertion.
However, I accept that the Wife made certain contributions to the repayment of
the HSBC mortgage. Although there is no conclusive proof that the other
telegraphic transfers were earmarked for the mortgage repayment, I am
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these telegraphic transfers
went toward the mortgage repayment. First, they were consistent with the mode
of final repayment. The telegraphic transfers and cashier’s orders exhibited
(at Tab M of DAOM-1) are consistent with the cashier’s order that the Wife
drew up for the final redemption repayment of $76,600.00, which was not
disputed by the Husband. Secondly, the payments of monies were made during the
time when the mortgage was being repaid. Finally, the telegraphic transfers
were sizeable amounts transferred to his bank account for which the Husband
did not give any other explanation for these payments. Accordingly, I am of
the view that the Wife contributed $64,029.93 to the mortgage repayment, being
the amount of the transfers exhibited.

16 It is not disputed that the renovation costs amounted to $145,797.12. The
only dispute concerns the Wife’s claim that she contributed $20,000. However,
to support her claim that she paid for the renovation costs, she uses the same
telegraphic transfers exhibited at Tab M of DAOM-1. But they are the same
exhibits which she claimed were used to reimburse the Husband for the
mortgage. Each record of transfer can only be for one purpose. Since I have
already credited the Wife for all the exhibits in Tab M of DAOM-1 toward her
mortgage repayment, I accordingly reject her assertion that she contributed
$20,000.00 to the renovation costs.

17 Finally, the Wife claims that she paid $50,000.00 for furniture and
furnishings. This, however, was not supported by any documentary evidence. Not
a single receipt was produced, even if only to show some contribution on her
part. Accordingly, I am unable to accept the Wife’s bare assertion of this
head of contribution.

18 Accordingly, the breakdown of the parties’ respective contributions to the
matrimonial asset are as follows:

Item of Contribution| Wife| Husband  
---|---|---  
5% Deposit| 0| $71,000.00  
CPF Lumpsum including stamp duty and legal fees| $16,900.00| $296,300.00  
Balance Payment| 0| $19,849.25  
Further CPF Withdrawal| $50,500.00| $181,500.00  
Monthly $900 repayment of mortgage loan from CPF OA| $90,900.00| $90,900.00  
Final redemption of HSBC Mortgage| $73,600.00| $216,680.64  
Monthly cash repayment towards the outstanding loan | $64,029.93| $383,970.07‬  
Renovations| $0| $145,797.12  
Furniture, fittings and furnishings| $0| $0  
Grand Total| $295,929.93| $1,405,997.08  
  
19 Accordingly, the direct financial contribution of the parties are as
follows:

Matrimonial Asset| Wife| Husband  
---|---|---  
Matrimonial Home| $295,929.93| $1,405,997.08  
Assets in Parties’ sole names| $1,554,034.58| $4,280,612.90  
Direct Financial Contribution| $1,849,964.51| $5,686,609.98  
Ratio| 24.5%| 75.5%  
  
20 Both parties have taken diametrically opposite positions on indirect
financial contribution, with the Wife saying that the ratio should be 70:30 in
her favour and the Husband saying that the ratio should be 70:30 in his
favour. Counsel on both sides made extensive submissions detailing their own
contributions while downplaying the other’s. The assessment of indirect
financial contribution ought not descend into an exercise of fault-finding.
This was a long marriage of over 20 years. However, in assessing indirect
contributions, the Court must consider only the facts and circumstances of the
case. The evidence reflects that that not only did the Husband contribute more
financially to the day-to-day running of the household, he was also the more
involved parent in the upbringing of the Child. Although both parents held
full-time jobs, I am of the view that the Husband was the primary caregiver.
However, I can accept that the Wife played a part in this long marriage,
albeit to a smaller extent. Thus, I am of the view that a ratio of 60%
(Husband): 40% (Wife) would be a fair reflection of indirect financial
contributions of the parties to the marriage.

21 I accord direct and indirect contribution equal weight. The overall ratio
and entitlement to the matrimonial pool of $9,354,647.48 are as follows:

| Wife| Husband  
---|---|---  
Direct Contribution| 24.5%| 75.5%  
Indirect Contribution | 40%| 60%  
Overall Ratio| 32.3%| 67.7%  
Share of matrimonial pool | $3,021,551.14| $6,333,096.34  
  
Maintenance of the Wife

22 The Wife seeks a lump sum maintenance of $540,000.00 on the basis that she
suffered financial inequity in having to sacrifice her career as a result of
having to care for the Child. She also relies on the fact that her occupation
as a hairdresser requires her to be in good health.

23 I do not agree with the Wife. First, the evidence shows that the Husband
was the primary caregiver of the Child. I had interviewed the Child, and am
fortified in this finding. Both parents made sacrifices to bring up the Child,
not just the Wife. I thus do not accept the Wife’s assertion that she was
unduly crippled by her homemaking responsibilities. Secondly, her assertion as
to reduced earning capacity due to ill health are speculative. This is evident
in her written submission that “in short, if [the Wife] were to suffer any
mishaps/medical illness and be unable to work [...]”. Maintenance is not an
insurance policy. If there is a material change in circumstances, the law
allows for variation. I will not make contingent orders in the event of her
ill health. I am of the view that the Wife is sufficiently capable of
maintaining herself presently. I thus make no orders as to maintenance.

24 I will hear parties on costs at a later date.
