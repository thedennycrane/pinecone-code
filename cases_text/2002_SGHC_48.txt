1\. The Accused was originally charged with murder. Before the trial
commenced, the Prosecution tendered an amended charge which reads as follows
:__

> "That you, **SIVARAMAN REDDY SIVAKUMAR**
>
> on or about the 29th day of September 2001, between 12.00 p.m. and 1.45
> p.m., at Blk 12 Pine Close #12-87, Singapore, did commit culpable homicide

>
> _
>
> Investigations
>
> _
>
> 5 Sergeant Azam from Tanglin Police Division was at TTSH conducting
> investigations into another case when he received the information on the
> death of deceased. He conducted preliminary investigations.
>
> 6 Sergeant Azam interviewed the accused person at the waiting area of the
> hospital. The accused stated that the deceased was his wife and they stayed
> at Blk 12, #12-87, Pine Close. On 29 Sep 2001, at about 12.00 – 1.45 pm, he
> had a dispute with the deceased over her desire to meet her mother and
> staying at her grandmother’s house at No: 10B Jubilee Road for the night.
>
> 7 The accused claimed that the deceased had stabbed herself once on the
> stomach when the accused refused to allow her to leave the house. After the
> deceased collapsed, the accused pulled the knife out of the deceased’s
> abdomen. He broke the knife and washed his hands and the knife over the
> kitchen sink. Accused then threw the knife into a rubbish bag located in the
> kitchen. The accused then sent the deceased to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
>
> 8 SIO Patrick Lim, from Bedok Police Division, took over investigations from
> Sergeant Azam. He went to the residence of deceased and accused and entered
> the unit #12-87, Pine Close. He found a few droplets of blood on the floor
> near the entrance leading into the kitchen. 2 handbags and 1 plastic bag
> containing costume jewelry belonging to the deceased were found on the floor
> in the living room. Some cast-off droplets of blood were found on the wall
> of the living room adjacent to the handbags. A kitchen knife with a broken
> blade used in the stabbing was found in a rubbish bag inside the kitchen.
>
> 9 There was no evidence to suggest that a violent struggle had taken place.
> The immediate neighbours were questioned and they did not hear any commotion
> coming from the unit at about the time of incident.
>
> _
>
> Autopsy Report, Annex A
>
> _
>
> 10 On 30 Sep 2001 at about 9.00 am, the forensic pathologist, Dr Wee Keng
> Poh, conducted a post-mortem on the deceased. He found that the deceased had
> suffered two stab wounds, one at the lower abdomen with a 2.5 cm cut and had
> a penetrating-depth of 13 cm. The other stab wound was near the rib-cage
> with a 2 cm cut and a penetrating-depth of 9 cm. Besides the 2 stab wounds,
> the deceased had a ‘defence injury’ in the form of a bruise on her left had.
>
> 11 Dr Wee was of the opinion that 2 injuries were sufficient to have caused
> the death of the deceased in the ordinary course of nature as the 2 stab-
> wound were inflicted on a vital area of the body – the abdomen. He certified
> the cause of death was hemorrhage due to stab wounds of the abdomen. Dr Wee
> opined that each of the stab wounds was fatal.
>
> 12 Dr Wee opined that that 2 stab wounds could not have been self-inflicted.
> There were no "hesitation-cuts" found on the skin which are characteristic
> of a self-inflicted stab wound. He found that the stab wounds were made
> deliberately by someone intent to cause harm to the deceased. In addition,
> the clothing that the deceased was wearing at the time of the incident
> usually would not have any stab tears if these wounds were self inflicted.
> He was of the opinion that a person intent on committing suicide by self-
> stabbing would bare that area of his body that he intends to inflict the
> injury.
>
> 13 Dr Wee also opined that it is not likely that two fatal abdominal stab
> wounds with a single defensive injury (bruise) over the left arm were caused
> in the course of a struggle. Considering the totality of the circumstances,
> Dr Wee is of the opinion that it may be possible for one stab wound to be
> caused in the course of a struggle, but not two stab wounds. One stab wound
> would have incapacitated the deceased because of the pain and blood loss
> that there will not be any further need for the assailant to continue to
> struggle to "take control of the knife" and further inflict the second stab
> wound.
>
> 14 The accused had maintained that the deceased had stabbed herself not once
> but twice with the kitchen knife with a blade measuring 20.2 cm. When told
> of the autopsy findings, the accused admitted that he had stabbed his wife
> twice.
>
> _
>
> Circumstances Leading To Death
>
> _
>
> 15 On 29 Sep 2001, both the accused and deceased woke up at about 11.00 am.
> A while later, deceased received a phone call from her mother. They were to
> meet up at Serangoon Road at about 1-1.30 pm for the deceased to buy a gold
> ‘thali’ (worn on the neck) representing that the deceased is married.
>
> 16 After the phone conversation, deceased dressed up in her uniform as she
> was working on the afternoon shift that day. Deceased told accused that she
> was going to Serangoon Road to meet her mother before she goes to work. Upon
> hearing that, accused told her that he would come along with her to meet her
> mother. The request was refused by the deceased. Accused insisted on coming
> along since he was alone in the house and he needed to pass time.
>
> 17 An argument ensued and the accused refused to allow the deceased to leave
> the house without him. Accused stood at the main door preventing the
> Deceased from going out of the house.
>
> 18 According to the Accused, deceased went to the kitchen and reached for 2
> knives from the knife-stand. She placed one of the knives near her throat.
> The Accused claimed that the deceased threatened to commit suicide if the
> accused did not let her go. Accused claimed that he relented to her demands.
>
> 19 The deceased went into the baby’s room and took a set of her clothing
> from the baby’s play-pen and walked out of the room. She then placed the
> clothes into her blue coloured bag, which was on the floor in the living
> room. After placing the clothes in the bag, she carried it together with her
> handbags and plastic bag. The accused asked the deceased where she was going
> with the extra clothes. She replied that she was going to Jubilee Road. The
> argument continued.
>
> 20 The accused got hold of deceased’s left hand which was holding the knife,
> with his right hand, to grab the knife away from her by pulling it towards
> him. While snatching the knife away, the accused stabbed the deceased on her
> stomach. He then withdrew the blade from the deceased’s stomach and stabbed
> her a second time. The deceased collapsed. The accused had deliberately
> inflicted both stab wounds on the abdomen and which act was done with the
> intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause the death of
> his wife.
>
> 21 The accused pulled the knife out from the deceased’s stomach with his
> hands. He broke the knife. When he noticed that his hands were stained with
> blood, he ran to the sink and washed his hands together with the broken
> knife. Thereafter, he dropped the broken knife into the rubbish bag.

Antecedents

**_

3\. The Accused had a clean record before this case.

_**

  
The Mitigation Plea

**_

4\. The Accused is 26 years old and was born and brought up in India. His
father abandoned the family of 3 children when the Accused was 5 years old and
they were brought up by the mother, a woman steeped in tradition. His mother
had regular prayer meetings in Singapore and the deceased got to know her
through her aunt.

5\. The deceased was very depressed by a failed relationship and her thyroid
disorder at that time and turned to the Accused’s mother for advice and
spiritual guidance. She was advised to seek medical treatment in India.

6\. On one such visit, the deceased got to know the Accused and their
relationship developed to the extent that they decided to get married. His
mother disapproved of the proposed marriage as the deceased was several years
older than the Accused and because she felt that the deceased might not fit
into their culture and tradition. Despite this, the couple registered their
marriage in Singapore on 9 Mar 2000.

7\. Subsequently, they informed the Accused’s mother that they wished to hold
their customary wedding in May 2000. When the mother found out that the
deceased was pregnant, she advised them against going through the customary
rites during their wedding. However, the Accused went along with the wishes of
the deceased to carry out the customary rites. As a result, the Accused’s
mother refused to attend the wedding on 15 May 2000.

8\. After the wedding, the couple moved into the house of the deceased’s uncle
and her grandmother at 10B Jubilee Road as they had no home of their own. The
deceased’s uncles and their families were already living there.

9\. The Accused remained unemployed as he was unable to obtain an Employment
Pass to work here. He had been working in the State Bank of India and was in
charge of sales, being the top performer for 1999, before he resigned in
December that year to join the deceased in their new life in Singapore. He was
undergoing a course of study leading to a Bachelor of Business Administration
degree but did not complete it. He arrived here in Feb 2000 and has remained
here on a social visit pass since then, save for a period of about one month
when he returned to India.

10\. The members of the deceased’s extended family in 10B Jubilee Road did not
treat the Accused too kindly. They were unhappy that they had to vacate one
room for the couple to live in. They ridiculed, taunted, humiliated and
embarrassed him, reminding him constantly of his inability to find work. His
occasional verbal retaliation to their remarks created problems in the
relationship between him and his wife.

11\. The Accused loved his wife dearly, preparing meals for her, accompanying
her to the bus stop when she left for work and waiting for her return to have
their meals together. He made sure she took her prescribed medication. During
her pregnancy, he also ensured that she had a cup of milk daily as advised by
the doctor. On one occasion when she refused to take the milk and threw it
away, the Accused became angry and slapped her once. That was the only time he
had laid hands on her.

12\. When their son was born on 2 Dec 2000, the Accused and his wife were
overjoyed. However, the members of his wife’s family took control of the child
and gave the Accused hardly any time to be alone with his son. When his wife
told him she would be sending their son to join her parents, who have
emigrated to Australia, he was not happy with the arrangement but relented for
the sake of the son.

13\. In April 2001, the Accused was assaulted by his wife’s father at a bus
stop. He had to seek medical attention as a result of that incident. He
produced a medical report in support of this allegation.

14\. Things got so bad that the Accused decided to leave 10B Jubilee Road in
May or June 2001. He went to stay with his friends, returning constantly to
visit his young son. When he tried to explain his difficult position to the
members of the deceased’s family by way of a letter, they were deeply offended
by it and an aunt rubbed the letter on his face, tore it into pieces and threw
them at his face.

15\. All these eventually led to the purchase of the flat at Pine Close. A
housewarming ceremony was held on 12 Sep 2001 and the couple moved into their
new home about a week later.

16\. On 29 Sep 2001, the Accused wanted to accompany the deceased to meet her
mother at Serangoon Road so that he could explain to her their marital
problems. He hoped that her mother would then advise her to go for counselling
and to take her medication regularly. A bitter quarrel took place when she
vehemently refused to allow him to accompany her. She also wanted to stay at
10B Jubilee Road that night and the Accused was concerned that would give the
wrong impression to her family members that they were having marital problems.
The quarrel became physical when she scratched and hit him. He was then clad
in a towel only and allowed her to scratch him without resisting. She took the
knife and threatened to get him into trouble by hurting herself. She abused
him physically and verbally and his pent up frustrations began to work on him
when the deceased raised the old family issues again.

17\. The Accused’s main concern was to take the knife away from the deceased
who was behaving erratically. However, this resulted in a struggle and he
stabbed her twice.

18\. Immediately after the stabbing, the Accused came to his senses and cried
out in despair in Tamil, " Latha, this thing has happened to us ". He then
sought frantically to bring her to a doctor. Forgetting to even put on his
footwear or closing the door to the flat, he carried his badly hurt wife into
the lift and brought her downstairs. He asked someone to call for an ambulance
but when he saw a car passing by, he pleaded with the driver to send him and
his wife to the nearest doctor. The driver kindly agreed to do so.

19\. During the journey in the car, he held on to his weakening wife, kept
talking to her and praying for her. His wife asked him to hold her tightly. He
also performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and pounded her chest when she
lost consciousness.

20\. Counsel for the Accused also tendered a report by Dr Lim Yun Chin, a
psychiatrist in private practice who is also a Visiting Consultant in the
Singapore General Hospital and the Institute of Mental Health. After
interviewing the Accused on 7 Mar 2002, during which essentially the same
matters mentioned in the mitigation plea were recounted, Dr Lim opined that
"_there was a rapid building up of intense anxiety and fear when he saw his
wife brandishing the knife. He was acutely aware of his wife’s propensity to
harm herself, given her unpredictable outburst and his paramount concern was
to snatch the knife away from her. However, when he felt the searing pain from
the cut inflicted by her actions and she showed no remorse, he began to feel
the surge of anger and rage towards her"._

21\. Dr Lim went on to explain that when a person was hurt or injured
physically or emotionally, it was a very primal emotional response to feel
angry and that this could lead to a sudden surge of aggression, even for a
mild-mannered person. He was also of the opinion that the Accused’s behaviour
after the stabbing suggested intense remorse following the abatement of the
anger, fear and anxiety.

22\. The psychiatrist also perused the medical reports on the deceased made in
Feb 1996, Aug 1998 and Jun 1999 and stated that the thyroid disorder diagnosed
in 1998 and the other auto-immune diseases that the deceased could have been
suffering from were often associated with mental instability including
depression and irritability. Her own doctor reported in 1998 that she was
"feeling unstable". Dr Lim added an opinion that the deceased was prone to
mental instability due to her thyroid illness but, upon objection by the
Prosecution, Defence Counsel agreed that that opinion should be deleted.

23\. Finally, the Accused pleaded for leniency and compassion to be shown by
the Court. It was submitted, on the authority of _PP v Tan Kei Loon
Allan[1999]_ _2 SLR 288_ that life imprisonment was not an appropriate
sentence in this case.

_**

  
The Prosecution’s Response

**_

24\. The Prosecution objected to the admissibility of the psychiatric report
insofar as it related to the deceased as Dr Lim was attempting to do a
psychological autopsy on her state of mind. Two authorities were cited to
support the objection against admissibility – _R v Gilfoyle_ _[2001] 2 Cr App
Rep 57_ and _Teh Thiam Huat v PP[1996] 3 SLR 621. _In any event, the
Prosecution argued, the autopsy report dated 30 Sep 2001 on the deceased
indicated that her thyroid appeared normal.

_**

  
The Sentence

**_

25\. I will first deal with the legal issue raised by the Prosecution that, on
the authority of the cases cited, the psychiatrist’s report here is
inadmissible. I do not think _R v Gilfoyle_ went so far as to hold that a
medical expert who has not interviewed a subject cannot give an expert opinion
on his condition. That case was concerned with the admission of further
evidence after trial and the psychologist’s reports were held to have failed
to identify any criteria by which the Court there could test the quality of
his opinions. The application to admit further evidence was dismissed in any
event as the Court of Appeal did not think that the jury would have returned a
different verdict even if the further evidence had been admitted.

26\. As in _Teh Thiam Huat v PP,_ Dr Y C Lim’s report in our present case is
admissible but it is at best a hypothesis based on past medical reports
concerning the deceased and is therefore of not much assistance to the Court.
In any event, as will become apparent from the rest of my judgment, the
question whether the deceased had suicidal tendencies or not is quite
immaterial to the facts of this case.

27\. The only witness of the events leading to the fatal stabbing on 29 Sep
2001 is the Accused. Except where admitted by the Prosecution, the Court is
not bound to accept everything said in mitigation as the truth. The Court is
entitled to test his account against the admitted facts and the objective
evidence and to decide whether his version is inherently incredible or self-
contradictory.

28\. The matters pleaded by Defence Counsel show at best that the Accused was
subject to occasional taunts and uncomplimentary remarks from the Deceased’s
family members. However, the Accused was not a poor, pitiful victim of
circumstances. It appears that he was quite capable of standing up for himself
whenever the circumstances required him to do so. He was capable of giving his
wife a swollen cheek when he was angry. He is not an uneducated man. He is no
stranger in this country and neither is his mother. He also has friends here.

29\. Even if all the things he alleges about the treatment he received from
the deceased and her family are true, do they justify or mitigate his conduct
on 29 Sep 2001 in the new matrimonial home ? By then, he had already left 10B
Jubilee Road sometime ago. He and his wife had a place of their own to call
home. The fact that his wife wanted to go alone to Serangoon Road to meet her
mother was of no great import and would certainly not cause a man to fly into
an implacable rage unless he is an extremely unreasonable and suspicious sort
of person and it is quite apparent from the events of that day that the
Accused is indeed such a person.

30\. Even if it were true that his wife had taken the knives from the kitchen,
she was not threatening to harm him with the knives in any way. The Statement
of Facts and even the Accused’s statement to the psychiatrist (at paragraph 19
of the report) show that all the wife wanted to do was to get her clothes and
leave the flat. She was clearly not about to stab or slash him or herself.
There was no reason at all for any fierce struggle to take place unless the
Accused was the aggressor.

31\. How could a man who, a few moments earlier, stood submissively clad in a
towel while his wife clawed ferociously at his unprotected flesh suddenly
become so overcome by anger and rage over a cut inflicted unintentionally in
the course of a struggle precipitated by himself that he would wrest the knife
away and plunge it twice into his wife’s abdomen ? Why would a man determined
to thwart any attempt at suicide stab his wife not once but twice in such a
violent manner ? The chain of events points undoubtedly to the Accused being
the aggressor on 29 Sep 2001.

32\. I am also not convinced that he experienced ‘intense remorse’ after the
stabbing. He was more fearful and anxious about the consequences of his
actions than he was remorseful. This is shown by the fact that he maintained
that his wife had stabbed herself until confronted with the forensic report
the next day.

33\. The following are the mitigating factors in his favour :

> (1) he pleaded guilty upon being offered the amended charge ;  
>  (2) he had no criminal record ; and  
>  (3) he did try quite frantically to save his wife after the stabbing.

34\. In the circumstances, I do not think life imprisonment is appropriate
here. I sentence the Accused to 10 years’ imprisonment with effect from 29 Sep
2001 and to receive 15 strokes of the cane.
