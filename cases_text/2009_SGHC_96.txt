Lai Siu Chiu J:

1 Chan Chin Cheung (“the plaintiff”) sued Chan Fatt Cheung, Chan See Chuen and
Chan Chee Chiu (“the first, second and third defendants” respectively and
collectively “the defendants”) for defamation in this suit. The plaintiff had
also sued the defendants in Malaysia in three actions, _viz_ Suit
S5-22-267-2002, Suit S-22-799-2003 and Originating Summons No.S1-24-1252-2005
(collectively “the Malaysian proceedings”).

2 The defendants applied by Summons No. 1882 of 2008 (“the application”) for a
stay of this suit pending the outcome of the Malaysian proceedings. The court
below dismissed the application against which decision the defendants appealed
to a judge in chambers in Registrar’s Appeal No. 284 of 2008 (“the Appeal”). I
heard and allowed the Appeal with costs and granted a stay of this suit
pending the outcome of the Malaysian proceedings. The plaintiff is
dissatisfied with my orders and has filed a notice of appeal (in Civil Appeal
No. 148 of 2008) against my decision.

The background

3 The background is extracted from the affidavits filed by the parties in
relation to the application and exhibited affidavits filed by the parties in
the Malaysian proceedings. The second defendant filed affidavits on behalf of
the defendants.

4 The plaintiff is a brother or half brother of the first and the second
defendants while the third defendant is the nephew of the plaintiff and a son
of the plaintiff’s brother Chan Chor Cheung. The plaintiff and the defendants
are the beneficiaries under the Will, dated 5 February 1947 (“the Will”), of
their late father Chan Wing (“the deceased”) who passed away in February 1947.
Probate of the estate of the deceased (“the Estate”) was granted in Malaysia
in April 1949 to four sons of the deceased, _viz_ Chan Hin Cheung, Chan Tak
Cheung, Chan Ting Cheung and Chan Kat Cheung, as the executors of the Estate.
Chan Ting Cheung passed away on 21 December 1988, followed by Chan Hin Cheung
on 1 July 1993 while Chan Tak Cheung died on 7 January 2002. Chan Kat Cheung
resigned as executor on 7 January 1972. Chan Chak Cheung who was appointed a
trustee on 1 June 1997, died on 7 May 2003. The defendants are the current
trustees of the Estate with the second defendant being appointed in January
1973 while the first and third defendants were appointed on 5 January 2004.

5 The deceased, during his lifetime, was a founder of two Malaysian banks,
Kwong Yik Bank (in 1913) and Lee Wah Bank (in 1931). He left substantial
assets and properties upon his death in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), Singapore and
Hong Kong. The bulk of the Estate (99%) according to the second defendant is
now in the United States and 1% is split between Singapore and Malaysia. The
net assets of the Estate in Singapore were valued at $2,109,890 as of 31
December 2000 while the Malaysian assets (primarily cash) were valued at
RM5,825,810 as of 31 December 1999 while the net assets in Hong Kong were
valued at US$9,106,661 as of 31 December 2000.

6 There are other beneficiaries of the Estate besides the parties in this
action. Eight of the beneficiaries (including the defendants) reside in
Singapore, two (including the plaintiff) reside in Malaysia, two reside in
Hong Kong, one resides in Canada and one resides in England. The office of the
Estate is in Singapore.

7 The plaintiff alleged that the defendants’ mismanagement of the Estate
caused him concern as which result he commenced various actions in Malaysia
_viz_ , Suit No. S5-22-267-2002 (“the first Malaysian suit”), Suit No.
S22-799-2003 (“the second Malaysian suit”) and Originating Summons No.
S1-24-1252-2005 (“the third Malaysian suit”). The Malaysian proceedings are
contested by the various defendants in the actions and are still pending.

8 In the first Malaysian suit, the plaintiff sued the second defendant and
another brother Chan Chak Cheung (“Chak Cheung”) as the trustees of the
Estate. (Since Chak Cheung passed away on 7 May 2003 (see [4]), that left the
second defendant as the sole defendant in the action). The plaintiff alleged
that the named defendants (now only the second defendant) had failed to give
the plaintiff any information at all relating to the Estate’s account. He
asked for an account of the estate and for an investigative audit to be
conducted on the accounts of the estate for the past six years by an
accounting firm. The plaintiff applied to stay the first Malaysian action
pending the disposal of this action. The second defendant opposed the
plaintiff’s application and it was dismissed by the Malaysian courts on 6
March 2008; the plaintiff did not appeal against the dismissal.

9 In the second Malaysian suit, the plaintiff again sued Chak Cheung and the
second defendant. The plaintiff alleged he was unaware when Chak Cheung was
appointed a trustee, that the Estate was a Malaysian trust with its place of
administration in Malaysia and that the defendants ‘moved’ the Estate’s office
out of Malaysia to Singapore. As the defendants were permanent residents of
Singapore and had remained out of Malaysia for more than twelve months, the
plaintiff contended they ought to be removed as trustees. The plaintiff asked
that he be appointed a trustee of the Estate.

10 In the third Malaysian suit, the plaintiff along with his sons Chan Kam Kew
and Chan Kam Ming (collectively “the sons”) sued the three defendants asking
that the first and second defendants concur with the plaintiff and he sons in
appointing the sons as trustees of the Estate in place of the first and third
defendants and that the property of the Estate be transferred to the sons who
would be allowed to charge remuneration for their services as such trustees
according to what was set out in the Will of the deceased. The Malaysian court
has dismissed the third Malaysian suit against which ruling the plaintiff and
the sons have filed an appeal which is pending.

11 To complete the picture, the defence filed by the defendants pleaded that
the plaintiff filed a fourth suit against the second defendant personally in
2007 in D3-29-153-2007, seeking payment of his share of the 2006 annual
distribution from the Estate. Payment of the same was withheld by the
defendants as the plaintiff had failed (despite a request from the defendants’
Malaysian solicitors) to give his acknowledgment of receipt to the Annual
letter of distribution 2006 and its enclosed audited accounts without which
the beneficiaries (including the plaintiff) well-knew that no payment could be
released.

**Events which led to the commencement of this suit**

12 According to the second defendant, the dispute between the parties centred
on the interpretation of a clause in the Will. The clause in question was
clause 14 which sub-clauses stated as follows:

(4) |  My Trustees shall pay all necessary expenses of educating all my grandsons in the male line, maintain any helpless widow in our said family and also pay all necessary expenses in administering my said shares. Provided however, that all such payments as are named in this sub-clause must be first be passed by a meeting of my male descendants in the male line and can be revoked by them at any time.  
---|---  
(5) |  My Trustees shall also pay the expenses of the Ching Ming Ancestral worships of our said family.  
(6) |  And the balance of the income of the said remaining shares in my Estate shall be divided among my sons and grandsons in the male line then living in Ching Ming, the 3rd moon of the Chinese Calendar, each year.  
And I declare that upon the death of the last survivor of my said wives and
sons my Trustees shall divide the said remaining shares of the Estate among
all my grandsons in the male line then living.  
  
13 On 1 May 2001, the plaintiff wrote to the defendants and requested that
they obtain DNA certification that all grandsons listed as beneficiaries were
the natural and biological sons of their respective fathers. The plaintiff
further warned the defendants that “the trustees who fail to carry out their
duties will have to face legal consequences”.

14 The defendants replied on 10 May 2001 expressing surprise, stated that the
legitimacy of each grandson’s claim was based on strict conventional legal
merit and not by the DNA method, named the deceased’s twelve existing
grandsons, invited the plaintiff to share any special information which was
not available to them as to why the DNA method was superior to the
conventional method and stated that in the absence of any better suggestions
supported by facts and reasons, the defendants as trustees would maintain
their present procedure for determining the legitimacy of each grandson’s
claim.

15 The plaintiff repeated his request to the defendants for DNA certification
in his letter dated 25 May 2001.

16 The defendants informed the plaintiff by letter dated 10 June 2001 that the
defendants had sent to every beneficiary the legal opinion they had obtained
from their professional advisers in Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia for the
legal determination of which “grandsons” qualified as beneficiaries under the
Will and the lawyers had unanimously opined that for a grandson to qualify as
a beneficiary under the Will, that grandson must be born to a son of the
deceased and the son’s legal spouse within legal wedlock. The defendants
pointed out that they had already rejected two previous claims by persons
purporting to qualify as “grandsons” under the Will on the basis that the
latter did not satisfy the legal requirement. The defendants again invited the
plaintiff to share any authentic legal documents which questioned the
legitimacy of any of the twelve grandsons and described DNA tests as
“nonsensical” since there were so many blood relatives of the deceased and it
would be an irresponsible and offensive witch hunt.

17 The defendants then received the plaintiff’s letter dated 1 March 2002
forwarding the claims of the sons in [10] who asserted they were grandsons of
the deceased under cll 14(4) and (6) of the Will (see [12]) and qualified as
beneficiaries to the residue of the Estate. The plaintiff also enclosed the
DNA tests of the sons which confirmed he was their “putative” father together
with their birth certificates which stated that Chan Kam Kew and Chan Kam Ming
were born to him by a woman called Chan Ah Mooi on 26 October 1974 and 27 July
1979 respectively.

18 By a letter dated 4 March 2002, the defendants informed the plaintiff that
it was the first time they were informed of the existence of the two sons and
the deceased’s “grandsons”, that as advised by the trustees’ professional
advisors, for a grandson to qualify as a beneficiary under the Will, that
grandson must be born to a son of the deceased and that son’s spouse within
legal wedlock. The defendants accordingly requested the plaintiff to furnish
the marriage certificate between himself and Chan Ah Mooi. As far as the
defendants were aware, the plaintiff was married to Madam Lee Moi Yin in 1958
(Madam Ho) at Westminster, England and there were two daughters but no sons
from the marriage. The defendants were not aware of any dissolution of the
plaintiff’s marriage to Madam Ho.

19 The plaintiff’s response was to file the first Malaysian suit on 19 March
2002 (see [7]) wherein the second defendant was alleged to have failed to
render the plaintiff any information at all relating to the Estate’s accounts,
despite the plaintiff’s requests.

20 The first Malaysian suit was followed by the filing of the second Malaysian
suit on 11 July 2003 which was followed in turn on 22 July 2005 by the filing
of the third Malaysian suit.

21 What triggered this suit was the defendants’ act of informing the
beneficiaries of developments in the Malaysian proceedings. After filing their
defences to the three suits, the defendants periodically sent circulars to the
beneficiaries to update the latter on the status quo of the Malaysian
proceedings. In particular the defendants sent to the beneficiaries three
circulars one dated 5 April 2006 (“the first circular”), another dated 16 May
2007 (“the second circular”) and the third dated 25 May 2007 (“the third
circular”). The three circulars were exhibited as “CSC 16”, “CSC 17” and “CSC
18” in the second defendant’s affidavit filed on 25 April 2008 in support of
the application.

22 The first circular was headed ‘Annual Distribution 2006 (y/e 31/12/2005)’
and was signed by the defendants. The second circular was intituled ‘Annual
Distribution 2007 “AD” (y/e 31/12/2006)’ and was signed by the defendants. The
third circular was headed ‘Annual Distribution 2007 “AD” (y/e 31/12/2006)
payment US$113,046’ and was signed by the second and third defendants.

23 The second circular contained, as attachments, four lists that commented on
the Malaysian proceedings and which contained (according to the plaintiff)
defamatory comments that formed the basis of his action for defamation. The
second circular itself contained words which the plaintiff found
objectionable, in particular, the following:

2(iv) …To prevent any member of our family falling prey to “CCC’s” [the
plaintiff’s] deceptive lies, we enclose [sic] list of his blatant lies &
perjured statements filed in his 3 above suits. These are over and above his
other despicable acts that we had already informed you. Everyone must know how
base & ruthless Chan Chin Cheung can be.

24 The first and second lists referred to the second Malaysian suit, the third
list referred to the third Malaysian suit while the last list referred to the
second Malaysian suit.

25 A sampling of the statements in the four lists that the plaintiff
considered to be defamatory of his reputation and good standing in Malaysian
society are as follows:-

(a) “CCC’s” 2 alleged sons claimed to become “Beneficiaries of ECW [estate of
Chan Wing] as well as for inheritance” – Shows greed, personal gain & ulterior
motive. Both not qualified to be Beneficiaries.

(b) His [the plaintiff’s] mental instability is best defined in the Oxford
Dictionary as, quote:-

1 “paranoia”: – mental derangement with delusions of grandeur, persecution,
etc, abnormal tendency to suspect & mistrust of others.

2 “schizophrenia” – mental disorder marked by disconnection between intellect,
emotions etc & actions.

(c) It is to be noted that Suit S-22-799-2003 and Suit S1-24-1252-2005 are
very similar in nature. Both had petitioned the Court to remove “serving
Trustees” & to appoint “CCC” or “his 2 alleged sons’ to replace the removed
Trustees.

(d) untrue – Plaintiff is both dishonest & untruthful.

(e) Chan Chin Cheung is most unsuitable to serve as a Trustee of the ECW. He
had misappropriated money from both of our family companies; Chan Wing
Holdings “CWH” in 1973 & from Happy Homes “HH” in 1974. Plaintiff only
returned the money misappropriated from CWH in 1975 despite constant demands
from Members of the Companies. Despite all demands, the money taken from HH
was returned after he was sued in High Court, commercial Division Suit C8 of
1983. Currently, “CCC” is also sued for a debt, money allegedly owing by him
to his niece in case S3-22-1124-2004.

The list of perjuries committed by “CCC” alone speaks volumes on his character
and suitability to be a Trustee.

(f) “CCC” is malicious, vindictive & and is full of hatred.

(g) “CCC” is consumed by greed, self interest, conflict of interest & contempt
for all members of the family.

(h) “CCC” contemptuously sponsored his 2 alleged sons to become Beneficiaries
of the ECW & claimed inheritance knowing that they are not qualified as
claimed. When rebuffed, ‘CCC” demands a DNA test for all grandsons &
threatens. To take revenge, he filed 3 High Court Cases (“grand schemes”) in
anger & in rapid succession.

(i) “CCC” is an unreliable witness and his word is worthless.

**The application**

26 The plaintiff filed his writ of summons on 31 August 2007 which was
followed by an amended statement of claim on 3 September 2007. On 14 September
2007 the plaintiff applied under Order 29 rule 2 of the Rules of Court for an
order (which he obtained on 18 October 2007) that the defendants preserve all
documents relating to the financial records of the Estate pending the outcome
of this action (“the preservation order”). The defendants filed their common
Defence on 19 October 2007. The plaintiff’s Reply was filed on 6 November
2007. The first defendant filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors on 13
February 2008. On 6 March 2008, the plaintiff applied to court for discovery
of specific documents under Summons No. 1061 of 2008 (“the discovery
application”). A Notice of Change of Solicitors was then filed by the second
and third defendants on 12 March 2008. On 2 April 2008, the first defendant
filed a second Notice of Change of Solicitors so that all the defendants were
again represented by the same firm of solicitors. The application was filed by
the defendants’ present solicitors on 24 April 2008 after the plaintiff failed
in his attempt to stay the first Malaysian suit on 6 March 2008 (see [8]). The
discovery application was then granted on 15 July 2008.

27 In support of the application, the second defendant filed an affidavit
wherein he deposed to facts/reasons why this action should be stayed on the
ground that Singapore was the _forum non conveniens_ because the connecting
facts were all in favour of Malaysia and the Malaysian courts were the more
appropriate forum to try the plaintiff’s claim.

28 The second defendant’s reasons were:

(a) |  the background of this suit related to and was a continuation of the several disputes which are the subject of the Malaysian proceedings.  
---|---  
(b) |  the plaintiff was seeking redress for the alleged damage to his reputation arising out of the defendants’ comments in the circulars (see [25]). As evidence of his good standing in Malaysian society, the plaintiff had pleaded (at para 31 of his statement of claim in the second Malaysian suit) his curriculum vitae as well as the various/many public offices he held/had held over the years.:  
|  Year |  Positions held  
|  1963 |  Founder trustee, Malaysian National Art Gallery.  
|  1966-1970 |  President of the Selangor Shooting Association.  
|  1968-1974 |  Member of Board of Trustees of Employees’ Provident Fund (“EPF”).  
|  1972-1981 |  Director of Bank Negara Malaysia.  
|  1972-1982 |  Treasurer of National Scouts Association.  
|  1976-1981 |  Member of Board of Governors of Lady Templar Hospital.  
|  1974-1992 |  Director of Malaysian public company Sime Darby Bhd.  
|  1982-1984 |  Member of Advisory Panel of EPF.  
|  1984-1986 |  Director of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia.  
|  1989-1999 |  Director of Malaysian public company Renong Bhd.  
|  2000 |  Chairman of Malaysian public company Multi-Purpose Holdings.  
(c) |  the plaintiff had also stated that many of his appointments, particularly his directorships in Malaysian public companies and banks, were made on the recommendation of the Malaysian government. He added that he had also been awarded an honour for public service by the Malaysian king in 1977. The plaintiff further described himself in the same pleadings as “a person of good standing financially and socially in Malaysia”.  
(d) |  in the second Malaysian suit the plaintiff had also pleaded that he was born in Malaysia, was/is a citizen of Malaysia and remained a resident of Malaysia throughout his life. The sons and their mother, Madam Chan Ah Mooi, also lived in Malaysia and so too did Madam Ho. Consequently, the plaintiff’s roots were in Malaysia and it was the country where his reputation required protection.  
(e) |  some of the beneficiaries resided in Malaysia. Of the six who resided in Singapore, they had indicated to the second defendant that they would attend the trial if this suit was stayed and the plaintiff commenced his defamation action afresh in Malaysia. Of the remaining two beneficiaries, one was the plaintiff’s full brother who may wish to remain neutral for that reason, while the other beneficiary spent most of his time in Thailand doing missionary work.  
(f) |  the alleged publication of the alleged defamatory statements took place in Malaysia.  
(g) |  if a stay was not granted, there was a danger of inconsistent findings by the Malaysian and Singapore courts in relation to the same or similar facts.  
(h) |  the defendants had pleased justification and qualified privilege in relation to the alleged libellous statements. The defence of justification related to the Malaysian proceedings which the defendants contended the plaintiff had started in bad faith, prompted by self interest or ulterior motives.  
(i) |  on the loans the plaintiff had taken from family companies _viz_ from Chan Wing Holdings Sdn Bhd and Happy Homes Sdn Bhd, both were Malaysian companies and maintained their records in Malaysia.  
(j) |  the plaintiff had allegedly made false reports to Bank Negara Malaysia in respect of alleged breaches by the defendants of the Malaysian Exchange Control Act 1953 and the Malaysian Trustees Act 1949 and to the Malaysian Registrar of Companies of breaches of the Malaysian Companies Act.  
  
29 As the Malaysian courts were already seized of jurisdiction in relation to
the various disputes and they had rejected the plaintiff’s application to stay
the Malaysian proceedings, it made sense for this suit to be stayed for the
plaintiff to commence defamation proceedings in Malaysia.

30 Not unexpectedly, the plaintiff objected to the application. In his
affidavits filed to oppose the application, the plaintiff:

(a) |  contended that the offending circulars originated from Singapore where the defendants and eight of the beneficiaries reside;  
---|---  
(b) |  revealed that when the defendants objected to the stay of the Malaysian proceedings, the second defendant had deposed in his opposing affidavit that the issues in the first Malaysian suit and this suit were completely different, separate and distinct and so too were the parties to the actions. The same point was made in the defendants’ submissions in relation to the preservation application.  
(c) |  deposed that in rejecting the plaintiff’s application for a stay, the Malaysian court hearing the same had accepted the second defendant’s arguments.  
(d) |  contended it was therefore untenable of the defendants to take a contradictory stand in the application.  
(e) |  pointed out that the first and third defendants were not parties to the first and second Malaysian suits nor were they involved in the management and administration of the Estate nor were they trustees at the material time.  
(f) |  noted that in the Malaysian proceedings (which were still pending more than six years after the time of filing of the first Malaysian suit) the Malaysian courts would not make a finding as to whether he had made false statements under oath in Malaysia or whether he had made false reports to various Malaysian authorities as these issues were not relevant to the Malaysian proceedings but were only pertinent to the defence of justification in this suit. Most of the issues prayed for in the Malaysian proceedings related to questions of Malaysian law.  
(g) |  deposed that whether the trustees in the Malaysian proceedings were in breach of the relevant Malaysian statutes raised by the second defendant in his supporting affidavit was not an issue in this suit and cannot support the defendants’ application.  
(h) |  contended that the background to this suit related solely to the defamatory comments about him published by the defendants to all the beneficiaries and whether they could rely on the defence of justification at the time of making them and had nothing to do with the Malaysian proceedings.  
(i) |  complained that his reputation had been tarnished by the defendants amongst all the beneficiaries the majority of whom lived in Singapore.  
(j) |  pointed out that if he commenced his defamation action in Malaysia and succeeded, he would have to face the cumbersome burden of having to register the judgment in Singapore for enforcement against the defendants who are residents of Singapore.  
(k) |  pointed out that in this action, he had prayed for an order for an apology from the defendants to be advertised in English and Chinese in the Malaysian and Singapore daily newspapers.  
(l) |  alleged that the real motive behind the application was an attempt to avoid giving specific discovery of documents in the discovery application.  
(m) |  prior to the filing of the application, the defendants had led him and the court to believe that this action would proceed to be tried here for which he had incurred considerable legal fees and disbursements to-date. Indeed, trial dates had been fixed in November 2008 (against the wishes of the defendants whose counsel informed the Registrar at a pre-trial conference that no trial dates should be fixed pending the outcome of the appeal).  
(n) |  pointed out time was not on his side because of his age (73 years).  
  
The Submissions

31 The arguments tendered by the parties were essentially a repeat of the
points made in their respective clients’ affidavits.

**The defendants’ arguments**

32 Counsel for the defendants pointed out that nothing on the face of the
alleged defamatory circulars/lists suggested that they referred to events in
Singapore apart from the fact that five of the circulars reached the
beneficiaries in Singapore. On the contrary, everything related to Malaysian
suits or misdemeanours in Malaysia – even the alleged defamatory comments
affected the plaintiff in the eyes of Malaysian society as his reputation was
established in Malaysia. He pointed out that the core issue of the defendants’
defence of justification was whether the plaintiff had commenced the Malaysian
proceedings in bad faith causing the defendants to have to incur unnecessary
expense to defend the same using the funds of the Estate. Counsel informed the
court that the first Malaysian suit had been fixed for hearing from 9 to 12
December 2008 while the second Malaysian suit would be heard in 2009.

33 Counsel for the defendants submitted that the court below fell into error
in concluding that this suit was for defamation whereas the Malaysian
proceedings related to breaches of trust and hence no stay should be granted.
The pleadings show that our courts cannot deal with this suit in isolation
without stepping on what is rightly within the jurisdiction of the Malaysian
courts in the Malaysian proceedings and that would be inappropriate on the
basis of the international rules on comity of nations. All the Malaysian
witnesses would also have to be brought to Singapore if this suit was not
stayed. The court should follow the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Good Earth
Agricultural Co Ltd v Novus International Pte Ltd_ [2008] 2 SLR 711 (“ _Good
Earth_ ”) which reaffirmed the two stage test in _Spiliada Maritime
Corporation v Cansulex Ltd_ [1987] AC 460 (“ _Spiliada_ ”) for stay of
proceedings.

**The plaintiff’s submissions**

34 Counsel for the defendants did not disagree with the _Spiliada_ test nor
with the principles cited by his opponent for the exercise of the court’s
discretion in granting a stay of proceedings in favour of another and more
appropriate foreign forum. He cited other (earlier) local cases that had
applied the _Spiliada_ test in particular _Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp
& PT Airfast Services Indonesia_ [1992] 2 SLR 776, _Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak
Hern_ [1995] 3 SLR 97 as well as _Rickshaw Investment Ltd & Anor v Nicolai
Baron von Uexkull_ [2007] 1 SLR 377.

35 Counsel for the plaintiff however took a stand contrary to the defendants’
and argued that applying the _Spiliada_ test would mean that no stay should be
granted as all connecting factors pointed to Singapore being the more
appropriate forum particularly (i) the jurisdiction in which the tort
occurred; (ii) the applicable law; (iii) the location of witnesses; (iv) the
defendants’ place of residence and that of the majority of the beneficiary
witnesses and (v) the location of the Estate’s documents.

36 He pointed out that it was for the court to determine what meaning should
be attached to the defamatory words – whether they should be the natural and
ordinary meaning and/or innuendo meaning pleaded by the plaintiff or the
alternative meaning pleaded by the defendants, _viz_ , that the plaintiff had
commenced the Malaysian proceedings in bad faith motivated by self interest,
the defendants as trustees were forced to incur unnecessary expenses for the
Estate in defending the Malaysian proceedings, that the plaintiff had made
false statements on oath in the Malaysian proceedings and the plaintiff was
seeking to take control of the Estate and its assets.

37 Consequently, if the court granted the stay application, which was premised
on the defendants’ alternative meanings, it meant this court would essentially
be holding that the alternative meanings were the correct meanings to attach
to the defamatory words, a finding which was within the sole purview of the
trial judge after hearing the evidence of the parties. In any event, counsel
submitted, the defendants had failed to show that their alternative meanings
were issues relevant to the Malaysian proceedings, either in relation to the
plaintiff’s request for an account from the defendants and an investigative
audit of the Estate (the first Malaysian suit) or for the removal of the
defendants as trustees (the second Malaysian suit). The defendants’ allegation
that the plaintiff had perjured himself in the Malaysian proceedings had not
resulted in contempt proceedings being taken against him by the defendants nor
was a police report lodged by them. The allegation of perjury was not
dependant on the outcome of the Malaysian proceedings nor was it an issue
therein.

38 Counsel also complained of the lateness of the application which fact I did
consider and for reasons which I will set out later, I did not consider fatal
to the defendants. He opined that the defendants’ ulterior motive for the
application was to avoid giving specific discovery to the plaintiff.

The decision

39 I reversed the decision of the court below and allowed the appeal as I was
of the view that the Assistant Registrar had erred in taking too restrictive a
view that the issues in this action related strictly to defamation and had
nothing to do with the Malaysian proceedings and/or the Estate.

40 At this juncture, it would be appropriate to consider what the two stage
test in _Spiliada_ (see [33]) entails. Lord Goff of Chieveley spelt out the
test as follows (at p 476):

(a) the basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of
forum non conveniens where the court is satisfied that there is some other
available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum
for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably
for the interest of all the parties and the ends of justice.. ..in general,
the burden of proof rests on the defendant to persuade the court to exercise
its discretion to grant a stay…

(b) Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that there is another available
forum which is prima facie the appropriate forum for the trial of the action,
the burden will then shift to the plaintiff to show that there are special
circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the trial should
nevertheless take place in this country.

41 I turn next to the facts of this case. It is noted that although this claim
is the tort of defamation, its genesis was the Estate and the facts were
similar to, if not the same, as those pleaded in the Malaysian proceedings
launched by the plaintiff. To quote from the appellate court’s decision in
_Good Earth_ (see [46] _infra_), this suit was effectively a continuation of
the parties’ dispute arising directly from the Malaysian proceedings and the
plaintiff’s obvious unhappiness over the defendants’ refusal (as trustees) to
recognise the sons born outside wedlock as beneficiaries of the Estate.

42 Consequently, applying stage 1 of the _Spiliada_ test, the defendants had
successfully discharged the burden and proven that Malaysia was a more
appropriate forum for the trial of this action. Indeed, this dispute between
the parties should preferably be dealt with by the same court that would hear
the first and second Malaysian suits. The plaintiff’s insinuation (in the
defendants’ word) of an inefficient Malaysian judicial system was baseless and
not to be considered in the light of the rule on the comity of nations (see
[48] _infra_). Issues involving Malaysian companies (Chan Wing Holdings Sdn
Bhd and Happy Homes Sdn Bhd) and Malaysian law (alleged breaches of the
Malaysian Exchange Control Act, Malaysian Trustees Act and Malaysian Companies
Act) should best be decided by Malaysian courts.

43 I was of the view that the location of the Estate’s office (and its
documentation) and the residence of the defendants being in Singapore were at
best a neutral factor. The defendants were still Malaysian citizens albeit
permanent residents of Singapore while the Estate’s office had previously been
sited in Kuala Lumpur before its relocation to Singapore. Moreover, as the
Malaysian courts had dismissed the plaintiff’s application to stay the
Malaysian proceedings against which dismissal he did not appeal, it would be
best to avoid duplicity of proceedings and inconsistent judicial findings by
having a Singapore court determine this dispute. Equally, the location of the
witnesses or beneficiaries was not a critical factor, be they in Singapore or
in Malaysia. In any case, if necessary, the plaintiff could have recourse to
the Evidence (Civil Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) Act (Cap 98, 1985 Rev
Ed),which s 4(1) states:

**Power of High Court to give effect to application for evidence**.

4 — (1) Subject to this section, the High Court shall have power, on any such
application as is mentioned in section 3, by order to make such provision for
obtaining evidence in Singapore as may appear to the High Court to be
appropriate for the purpose of giving effect to the request in pursuance of
which the application is made; and any such order may require a person
specified therein to take such steps as the High Court may consider
appropriate for that purpose.

while the plaintiff’s suspicions that the application was an attempt by the
defendants to avoid giving specific discovery and that they intended to
destroy documents, would be allayed by s 4(2) of the same Act; which states:

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) but subject to this
section, an order under this section may, in particular, make provision —

(a) for the examination of witnesses, either orally or in writing;

(b) for the production of documents;

(c) for the inspection, photographing, preservation, custody or detention of
any property;

…

44 As the defendants had crossed the threshold of stage 1, I moved on to
consider stage 2 of the _Spiliada_ test. Under this stage, the burden shifted
to the plaintiff to persuade the court that notwithstanding Malaysia being the
more appropriate forum, there were special circumstances by reason of which
justice required that the trial should nevertheless take place in Singapore. I
was of the view that the plaintiff had failed to discharge the requisite
burden of proof. Consequently, I granted the application when I allowed the
appeal.

45 In _Good Earth_ (see [33]), the appellant Good Earth (“the plaintiff”) sued
the respondent Novus (“the defendant”) in Hong Kong for wrongful termination
of an oral contract. Judgment was given to the plaintiff which it registered
and enforced in Singapore against the defendant. In the Hong Kong action, the
defendant had tried unsuccessfully to file a counterclaim alleging that the
plaintiff had made and retained secret profits by charging its end-customer a
higher price than that agreed between the parties (“the Hong Kong
counterclaim”). Its application in September 2006 was dismissed as it was
deemed to be made too late, given that trial had been set down to commence on
4 December 2006. The defendant then filed a fresh action in Singapore to
recover the alleged secret profits (“the Singapore action”). The plaintiff
applied for a stay of the Singapore action (which was disallowed) on the
ground that Hong Kong would be the natural or more appropriate forum to hear
the defendant’s claim for secret profits.

46 The plaintiff’s appeal was allowed and a stay was granted by the Court of
Appeal, _inter alia_ , on the basis that the Singapore action was effectively
a continuation of the parties’ disputes arising from the termination of the
oral contract. The Singapore action was in substance and effect the Hong Kong
counterclaim in another guise and was the most compelling factor in favour of
Hong Kong being the natural or more appropriate forum.

47 It was held to be not a significant factor that the defendant did not have
a presence in Hong Kong as, if it succeeded in its claim for secret profits in
Hong Kong, enforcement would be facilitated by the fact that the plaintiff was
a Hong Kong company with assets there. The plaintiff had named four witnesses
who resided in Hong Kong while the defendant had one Singapore-based witness.
The appellate court held that Hong Kong appeared to be the natural or more
appropriate forum in terms of location of witnesses.

48 On international comity, the Court said at [27]:

The Singapore courts have nothing but unreserved respect for the Hong Kong
legal system. Indeed, it is not insignificant to note that English law
constitutes the foundation of both legal systems. If Novus’ claim for secret
profits is heard in Hong Kong, any suggestion centring on the possibility of
actual or apparent judicial bias is, in our view, wholly unjustified. Further,
this court has in the past emphasised the high regard that it places on the
maintenance of international comity. The words of Chao Hick Tin JA delivering
the judgment of this court in _The Hung Vuong-2_ [2001] 3 SLR 146 at [27] bear
repeating:

We must point out at once that it is not for this court or any court in
Singapore to pass judgment on the competence or independence of the judiciary
of another country, all the more so of a friendly country. Comity between
nations would be gravely undermined if such a wholly invidious pursuit is
embarked upon.

49 The Court of Appeal then added at [29]:

We would also like to take this opportunity to clarify that should a factor
such as “judge shopping” ever become relevant in future cases, it should be
considered at Stage 2 of the _Spiliada_ test.

There was no question of ‘judge shopping’ in our case.

50 The plaintiff had complained of the lateness of the application (which the
defendants did not deny). However, one reason for the delay was obviously the
need to know the outcome of the plaintiff’s stay application in Malaysia. That
was only known on 6 March 2008 (see [8]) while the application was filed on 24
April 2008. Although the application could indeed have been filed earlier, it
would have made no sense to do so until after the Malaysian courts had decided
on the plaintiff’s own application to stay the first Malaysian suit. A further
delay was necessary as the defendants had to wait to see if the plaintiff
would file a notice of appeal against the dismissal of his stay application.

51 Counsel for the defendants pointed out that the plaintiff himself was
guilty of delay as the plaintiff waited for over five years to file his stay
application for the first Malaysian suit (which had been commenced in 2002).
Apparently, the plaintiff had also failed to comply with case management
directions issued more than a year ago by the Malaysian courts for the first
and second Malaysian suits. This caused a delay in the trial of the second
Malaysian suit.

52 I accepted the defendants’ submission that the Malaysian courts’ ruling in
March 2008 finally settled the issue of where trial of the Malaysian
proceedings should take place. Their counsel submitted, with which I agreed,
that it changed the entire complexion of the case.

53 Another argument raised by the plaintiff was his age, which the defendants
described as a ploy to gain the court’s sympathy. The defendants pointed that
the plaintiff’s pious hope in his affidavit that he wished to be vindicated
while he was fit mentally, physically and during his lifetime should be
contrasted with his statement of claim in the second Malaysian suit where he
pleaded [at para 31(c)] that he possessed good mental and physical health in
his quest to remove the defendants and have himself and the sons replace them
as trustees. In blowing hot and cold when it suited his purpose to do so, the
plaintiff lost credibility. In any case, there was no medical evidence to
support his alleged infirmities.

54 Yet another prong of attack from the plaintiff was the defendants’ alleged
inconsistent stand. Counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that before the
court which granted the preservation order, the defendants took the stand that
this suit had nothing to do with the financial records of the Estate and that
the trust issue and this suit were wholly unrelated. However, in the
submissions tendered by their counsel in Malaysia to oppose the plaintiff’s
stay application, the defendants had said:

the subject matter and focus of [the first Malaysian suit] are completely
different from the subject matter and focus of the Singapore suit. [The first
Malaysian suit] has been filed by the plaintiff for relief pertaining to the
accounts of the Trust, and is based on the second defendant’s alleged wilful
default as Trustee. The Singapore Suit on the other hand has been filed by the
plaintiff for damages for alleged defamation by the second defendant and his
co-Trustees. The causes of action, subject matter and focus of the 2 suits are
therefore completely different.

55 Counsel for the plaintiff countered the above argument by pointing out that
both sides said different things earlier on. He contended that the plaintiff
had equally adopted an inconsistent stand in the Malaysian proceedings. There,
the plaintiff had stated that the issues pleaded in the defence in this suit
were also issues for determination in the first Malaysian suit and that it was
apparent from the Singapore defence that the issues arising in the first
Malaysian suit would be argued on the merits of this suit. The plaintiff
argued for a stay of the first Malaysian suit to avoid a duplication of
proceedings.

56 As both sides appeared to be inconsistent in their stands in relation to
the Malaysian proceedings and the stay application for the first Malaysian
suit, I decided it was best to ignore their previous conduct, focus on the
legal position and determine whether the _Spiliada_ test had been satisfied.

57 There was one very important consideration which the plaintiff did not
consider – the plaintiff would do himself and his reputation an injustice if
his claim for defamation was tried in Singapore. The plaintiff’s impressive
credentials set out in [26(b)] above had everything to do with Malaysia and
nothing to do with Singapore. While I do not doubt his credentials, as far as
I am aware, the plaintiff is not a well-known personality in Singapore. Should
he pursue and succeed in his defamation suit in Singapore, the measure of
damages he would obtain would be considerably less than what he would obtain
had he sued in Malaysia.

58 For all the above reasons, I allowed the appeal with costs, reversed the
decision of the court below and granted a stay of this suit pending the
outcome of the Malaysian proceedings.
