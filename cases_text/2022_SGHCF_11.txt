General Division of the High Court (Family Division) — Divorce (Transferred)
No 1156 of 2019  
Choo Han Teck J  
27 April 2022

24 May 2022 Judgment reserved

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff (“the Wife”) and the defendant (“the Husband”) married in
Singapore on 4 April 1988. The marriage lasted 31 years before the Wife filed
for divorce in 2019. Interim judgment was granted on 30 May 2019. The Husband
is a banker and the Wife is a full-time homemaker. The parties have three
children who are all above the age of 21. There are no issues of custody, care
and control, or maintenance for the children. The only two issues before me
are (1) the division of matrimonial assets; and (2) the Wife’s claim for
maintenance.

2 On the issue of division of matrimonial assets, the parties disagree as to
which assets should constitute the matrimonial pool. The Wife says that two
Singapore properties, the Crowhurst Property (“Property C”) and the Bloxhome
Property (“Property B”), are gifts from her late mother and registered in her
sole name, and thus should be excluded from the matrimonial pool:

(a) For Property C, the Wife says that it should not be regarded as a
matrimonial home because it only became the parties’ home in 2004, when her
late mother gave the property to her. The Wife also says that after the
Husband had accepted a job in Geneva in 2007, the family moved with the
Husband to Geneva until 2009 and did not occupy Property C during this time.
The Wife further says that the Husband also did not substantially improve
Property C but instead, diminished the net value of the property by mortgaging
Property C for loans.

(b) For Property B, the Wife says that although it was linked to Property C
via a back-gate, it was a distinct and separate property and was never meant
to be the parties’ matrimonial home. The Wife says that the parties lived
primarily in Property C whereas Property B was mainly occupied by their two
oldest children. Property B was renovated in 2012 after it was given to the
Wife, and again, in 2018. The Wife says that the renovations cannot be
construed as the Husband’s substantial improvement of Property B because the
money used for the renovations of Property B was obtained from mortgaging
Property C (which was also a gift by the Wife’s late mother).

3 The Husband says that Property C and Property B are both matrimonial assets.
The Husband says that when they first moved into Property C, Property C was in
a dilapidated condition and they had to use the proceeds of sale of their
previous house, the Namly Property, to renovate Property C to livable
conditions. The Husband also says that Property B was given to the Wife in
2012 to provide more personal space for their family, including the parties’
growing children. The Husband says that the parties took steps to physically
link the two properties together to effectively merge the properties into a
single large matrimonial home. The Husband further says that the 2012
renovations included installing a common kitchen and dining area in Property B
and converting the kitchen in Property C into study rooms.

4 I am of the view that Property C and Property B are both matrimonial assets.
Under section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Women’s
Charter”), an asset acquired by one party by way of a gift can be a
matrimonial asset if it had been used as a matrimonial home, or if it had been
substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both
parties to the marriage. In the present case, notwithstanding the fact that
Property C and Property B were gifts from the Wife’s late mother, I am of the
view that both properties were used as the matrimonial home for the family. As
early as 1994, the parties moved into Property C with the permission of the
Wife’s late mother. By 2004, when Property C was formally transferred to the
Wife by way of a gift, the parties had already been occupying Property C as
their matrimonial home for 10 years. In 2012, Property B, which was adjacent
to Property C, was given to the Wife to expand the parties’ matrimonial home
for the collective benefit of the parties and their growing children. When
renovating Property B, the parties built a gate, thus joining the two
properties. This suggests that the parties intended to use both properties as
their matrimonial home, which they did. The mere fact that the family stayed
overseas in Switzerland for a period of two years from 2007 to 2009 does not
change the fact that the two properties were the home for the parties and
their children. Therefore, I am of the view that both Property C and Property
B formed the matrimonial home of the parties and should be counted in the pool
of matrimonial assets.

5 Apart from Property C and Property B, the Wife also says that a total of
twelve DBS, UOB and HSBC Malaysia accounts in her sole name were gifts from
her late mother and should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets.
The assets are listed in the table below:

S/N| Asset| Net Value / in SGD  
---|---|---  
1\. | DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430 (Cash and Cash Investments)| 3,418.91  
2\. | DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430 (Equity)| 430,936.00  
3\. | DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430 (Fund)| 429,329.90  
4\. | DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430 (Fixed Income)| 574,696.98  
5\. | HSBC Jade Global Insurance Policy No. ending 1139| 387,881.69  
6\. | UOB BGF Global Multi Asset Income Fund Account No. ending 01012| 232,810.43  
7\. | HSBC Malaysia Account No. ending 7108 | 17,330.98  
8\. | HSBC Malaysia Account No. ending 7131| 49,339.84  
9\. | HSBC Malaysia Account No. ending 7132| 51,279.28  
10\. | HSBC Malaysia Account No. ending 7133| 51,279.28  
11\. | HSBC Malaysia Account No. ending 7136| 16,446.61  
12\. | HSBC Shares/UT/Bonds/SUKUK| 68,245.23  
Total:| 2,312,995.13  
  
6 Out of the twelve assets listed above, the Husband does not dispute that the
Fixed Income Portion of DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430 and the HSBC
Jade Global Insurance Policy are gifts to the Wife from her late mother and
ought to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. For the remaining
ten assets, the Husband says that the Wife did not identify these assets as
gifts in her Affidavit of Assets and Means filed in 2019 and only raised the
matter in her 2nd Ancillary Matters Affidavit filed in 2021, which suggests
that her allegation is merely an afterthought. The Husband also says that the
Wife has failed to produce any evidence regarding the source of the ten assets
and has therefore failed to discharge her burden of proving that the ten
assets are gifts.

7 The Wife tendered the following evidence to support her claim that the
twelve assets are gifts from her late mother:

(a) In relation to the assets in DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430, the
Wife adduced bank statements showing the source of all the assets in DBS
Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430 (and not only the fixed income portion)
originated from her late mother’s account, DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending
6450. The Wife also adduced evidence showing that the value of the assets in
DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 6450 (S$1,680,230.45) is similar to the
value of all her assets in DBS Treasure Portfolio No. ending 5430
(S$1,438,381.79).

(b) In relation to the assets in HSBC Malaysia Account No. ending 7108, 7131,
7133 and 7136 (“HSBC Malaysia Assets”), the Wife says that her late mother
transferred the assets to the joint HSBC Malaysia bank accounts between the
Wife and her late mother, before transferring the assets to the HSBC Malaysia
bank accounts under the Wife’s sole name. The Wife produced bank statements
from the joint HSBC Malaysia bank account with her mother showing that there
were assets totalling MYR 587, 080.61 as of 5 October 2017. The Wife says that
this is not far from the existing value of the assets in the HSBC Malaysia
Assets of MYR 771,995.92 and that the increase in value is attributable to
gains over time.

(c) In relation to UOB BGF Global Multi Asset Income Fund Account No. ending
01012, the Wife says that the investment was held in joint names between
herself and her late mother. The Wife does not have the documents to prove
that the assets originated from her late mother but the Wife relies on
circumstantial evidence, including the fact that she ceased full-time work in
1993 and could not have amassed a sum close to S$232,810.43 through work. The
Wife also says that it is not possible for the Husband to have paid for the
purchase given that his expenses exceed his salary.

8 Having perused the bank accounts statements tendered by the Wife, I am of
the view that the Wife has produced sufficient evidence to show that the
assets in the twelve accounts may be traced back to monies given to her by her
late mother. Her mother had been consistently generous to her. The Wife had no
independent source of income of her own. It is not the Husband’s case that he
purchased the assets or that he substantially improved the assets in the
twelve accounts. Therefore, I am of the view that the assets in the twelve
accounts should be excluded from the matrimonial pool.

9 The Husband says that the sum of S$109,000.00 should be added to the
matrimonial pool because it was unilaterally withdrawn by the Wife from the
Husband’s DBS Account No. ending 6676 on 18 March 2019, 6 days after the Wife
filed the Writ for Divorce. The Husband says that the sum was used by the Wife
to pay for her three-week holiday in Europe and a retreat to Johore Bahru
without the Husband’s consent and should be added back to the matrimonial pool
for division between the parties. I agree. Where substantial sums are expended
by one spouse during the period when divorce proceedings have commenced but
before the ancillaries are concluded, the sum must be returned to the asset
pool if the other spouse is considered to have a putative interest in it and
has not agreed to the expenditure (TNL v TNK and another appeal and another
matter [2017] 1 SLR 609) (“TNL v TNK”). I note that the Wife does not dispute
that she withdrew the said amount from the Husband’s bank account after the
commencement of the divorce proceedings and without the consent of the
Husband. I am of the view that in this case, given the unusual spending of
such a large sum in the midst of divorce proceedings, the S$109,000.00 should
be added to the matrimonial pool.

10 The Husband also says that the sums of S$420,827.04 and S$80,484.28 should
be added to the matrimonial pool because they were paid towards the monthly
instalments for the mortgage of Property C and a Thailand property, the Hunsa
Property, since the start of the divorce proceedings in March 2019. The
Husband says that these sums ought to be included in the matrimonial pool
because the amounts were incurred to preserve the matrimonial assets after the
commencement of the divorce proceedings.

11 Although I agree with the Husband that expenses incurred to preserve
matrimonial assets pending the determination of ancillaries ought to be
divided between the parties, I do not accept the quantum of the mortgage
repayments which should be added back to the matrimonial pool. The net value
of Property C was determined to be S$3,083,773.12 after deducting the
outstanding mortgage of S$1,961,226.88 as of 14 October 2021. In making the
deduction of the outstanding mortgage, the agreed net value of Property C
would have accounted for the Husband’s mortgage payments until 14 October
2021. There will be double-counting if mortgage repayments from March 2019 to
October 2021 are added back into the matrimonial pool. The correct approach
would be to add the mortgage payments for Property C from October 2021 to
present date into the matrimonial pool. That would amount to approximately
S$70,137.84.

12 The Husband says that the monthly payment for the mortgage of the Hunsa
property is THB55,300.00 (S$2,238.48) and that the total mortgage payment of
$80,858.28 from March 2019 to March 2022 should be added to the matrimonial
pool. However, the only evidence tendered by the Husband is a receipt from MBK
Guarantee Company Limited showing that the Husband made a payment of
THB55,300.00 to the company on 15 September 2019. Furthermore, the receipt
showed that the total outstanding mortgage for the Hunsa property as of 15
September 2019 was only THB682,672.00 (S$30,753.69). If the Husband had, as he
claims, made timely repayment of S$2,238.48 every month, the outstanding
mortgage would have been fully repaid by November 2020 and the total payment
would not have exceeded S$30,753.69. Therefore, I find that the correct figure
to add back into the matrimonial pool is S$30,753.69.

Subtotal for assets under Husband’s name| 915,388.57  
Total assets| 8,537,297.73  
  
14 In addition to S$8,537,297.73, I find that the sums of S$109,000.00,
S$70,137.84 and S$30,753.69 should be added back into the matrimonial pool.
This brings the total value of the matrimonial pool to S$8,747,189.26

15 Turning to the issue of division of matrimonial assets, the Wife says that
the matrimonial assets should be divided 80:20 in favor of the Wife. The
Husband asks for an equal division of the matrimonial assets. In long single-
income marriages, courts tend towards an equal division of matrimonial assets
(TNL v TNK at [48]). But, wealth accumulation in every marriage is different
and the courts have the discretion to deviate from equal division even in long
single-income marriages to account for the circumstances of each case (UVM v
UBN [2017] 4 SLR 921 at [66]).

16 In the present case, I am of the view that the matrimonial assets should be
divided 55:45 in favor of the Wife. The parties were married for 31 years with
three children to the marriage. The Husband was the main breadwinner and the
Wife was a homemaker. This fits the paradigm example of a long-term single-
income marriage in which the courts will tend towards an equal division of
matrimonial assets. With that being said, I accept the Wife’s submission that
her indirect contributions to the welfare of the family outweigh that of the
Husband. The Wife was the primary caregiver of the family who chose to
sacrifice her career in 1993 to devote all her time and energy to raise the
parties’ children. The Husband, on the other hand, was preoccupied with work
and made frequent “business” trips to Thailand, although it is unclear whether
these trips were for legitimate business or “business” with his mistress in
Thailand. Furthermore, the family benefitted greatly from the assets given to
the Wife by the Wife’s late mother — even the parties’ matrimonial home was a
gift from the Wife’s late mother. Hence, I am of the view that a fair and
equitable division of the matrimonial assets should be 55:45 in favour of the
Wife.

17 The Wife says that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband
because he has failed to make full and frank disclosure of his matrimonial
assets in Thailand. The Wife says that the Husband has been evasive towards
the production of documents for his assets in Thailand and has delayed the
production of relevant documents until months before the ancillary hearing.
The Wife also says that large sums of monies are frequently deposited into the
Husband’s Bangkok Bank Account since 2014 and that after each deposit, there
would be corresponding cash withdrawals, which suggests the existence of other
undisclosed matrimonial assets and/or the dissipation of matrimonial assets.
The Wife also says that the Husband has not fully accounted for loan monies
obtained from Property C’s mortgage and that the loan monies could have been
used to acquire other non-disclosed matrimonial assets.

18 After reviewing the evidence, I am of the view that an adverse inference
should be drawn against the Husband. The bank statements of the Husband’s
Bangkok Bank Account No. ending 5504 showed that a total sum of approximately
THB21,827,022.35 (S$889,210.77) had been deposited into the account from 2014
to 2019. This averages to S$14,820.18 per month which far exceeded the
mortgage payments that the Husband made towards the Hunsa property
(THB55,300.00 or S$2,486.96 per month). Moreover, the bank accounts showed
that after each deposit, there would be multiple cash withdrawals from the
Bangkok Bank Account, which Husband had not provided adequate explanations
for. In the circumstances surrounding the deposits and withdrawals from the
Husband’s bank account, I am of the view that an adverse inference should be
drawn against the Husband.

19 In the present case, given the lack of information as to the true extent of
non-disclosure or dissipation, I incline to adopt the uplift approach in TQU v
TQT [2020] SGCA 8, and award a greater share of the total pool of matrimonial
assets to the Wife. I am of the view that a 5% uplift in favour of the Wife
would be appropriate to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of
matrimonial assets. After the uplift, the matrimonial assets should be divided
60:40 in favour of the Wife. Therefore, the Wife should be entitled to
S$5,248,313.56 and the Husband should be entitled to S$3,498,875.70

20 I thus order as follows:

(a) Parties are to retain assets in their sole names.

(b) Assets in the parties’ joint names, including the Kuching Property, the
Hua Hin Property and the Hunsa Property, shall be given to the Husband.

(c) The Wife shall pay the Husband the sum of S$1,600,000.00.

21 Since the parties’ liabilities in their sole names (excluding the
outstanding mortgages for the properties which have already been accounted for
in calculating the net value of those properties) are roughly equal, and both
will be well-provided for after the division, I order each party to bear the
liabilities under his/her sole name himself/herself. For the avoidance of
doubt, this does not affect the parties’ responsibility for outstanding
mortgages — each party should be responsible for the outstanding mortgages of
the properties under his or her name after the division.

22 Lastly, on the issue of maintenance for the Wife, the Wife asks for a lump
sum maintenance payment of S$1,080,000.00, calculated at S$6,000.00 per month
for 15 years. The Husband says that he should not be required to pay
maintenance to the Wife given that the Wife will be in possession of
substantial financial resources from her share of the matrimonial assets and
her inheritance from her late mother.

23 The court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to
order division of matrimonial assets. The court can take into account each
party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum
of maintenance to be ordered (ATE v ATD [2016] SGCA 2 at [31]). In the present
case, the Wife will be receiving 60% of the matrimonial pool, amounting to
over 5 million dollars. Further, I have also found that the twelve bank
accounts in the Wife’s sole name, which contained assets worth S$2,312,995.13,
should be excluded from the matrimonial pool and should remain the Wife’s
assets. In these circumstances, I agree with the Husband that the Wife will be
in possession of substantial financial resources to maintain herself at a
standard of living that is commensurate with the standard of living she
enjoyed during the marriage. I, therefore, make no orders as to maintenance
for the Wife, with liberty to the Wife to apply. Each party to bear its own
costs.
