: The appellant, Silvalingam Sinnasamy (`Mr Sinnasamy`), pleaded guilty in the
district court to two charges: a charge under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic
Act (Cap 276, 1997 Ed) (`RTA`) and a charge under s 65 of the RTA. He appealed
against the sentence imposed by District Judge Christopher Goh in respect of
the charge under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA.  
  
**_The facts_**

****

Prior to his conviction under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA, Mr Sinnasamy had been
convicted on 25 February 1987 of an offence under the former s 68(1) of the
RTA (Cap 92, 1970 Ed), which reads:

> _Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a
> road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to
> such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle,
> shall be guilty of an offence ..._

  
  
Section 67(1)(b) of the RTA, under which Mr Sinnasamy is now convicted, was
enacted in 1996. Section 67(1) reads:

> _Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a
> road or other public place -_

> _
>
> (a) is unfit to drive in that he is under the influence of drink or of a
> drug or an intoxicating substance to such an extent as to be incapable of
> having proper control of such vehicle; **_or_**
>
> (b) has so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath
> or blood exceeds the prescribed limit,
>
> _

> _shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine
> of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a
> term not exceeding 6 months and,**in the case of a second or subsequent
> conviction** , to a fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000
> and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. [Emphasis is
> added.]_

  
  
The main question in the appeal was this: having been convicted on 25 February
1987 under the former s 68(1) of the RTA, was Mr Sinnasamy a second time
offender for the purpose of sentencing under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA?  
  
**_Decision of the judge_**

****

The judge was of the view that the main aim of s 67(1)(b) of the RTA is to
target drivers who drink and drive, and that the amendments were introduced to
assist the prosecution, by doing away with the need to prove that the driver
is incapable of controlling his vehicle when his blood alcohol concentration
level exceeds the statutorily prescribed limit. In his opinion, it was clearly
the intention of Parliament that such offenders should be treated as second
time offenders and accordingly be made subject to the enhanced punishment
prescribed in s 67(1) of the RTA.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

Mr Selva K Naidu, who appeared on behalf of Mr Sinnasamy, submitted that the
judge was wrong in holding that Mr Sinnasamy should be treated as a second
time offender under s 67(1) of the RTA. The thrust of his submission was that
the former s 68(1) and the current s 67(1)(b) create distinct offences. Under
the former s 68(1), the key element of the offence was `driving under the
influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper
control of the vehicle`. Under s 67(1)(b), the key element is now having `so
much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood
exceeds the prescribed limit`.  
  
Mr Naidu went on to submit that, since they are distinct offences, if
Parliament had intended for a previous conviction under the former s 68(1) to
be treated as a conviction under s 67(1)(b), it would have done so by way of a
deeming provision, such as with s 68(4) of the RTA. This section provides:

> _Where a person convicted of an offence under this section has been
> previously convicted of an offence under section 67, he shall be treated for
> the purpose of this section as having been previously convicted under this
> section._

  
  
The need for a deeming provision in s 68(4) is understandable, since ss 67 and
68 are clearly distinct offences. Section 67 covers persons who are driving
while under the influence of drink, while s 68 covers persons who are **_not
driving_** , but are nevertheless in charge of a motor vehicle when under the
influence of drink.  
  
According to Mr Naidu, the former s 68 is clearly distinct from s 67(1)(b),
because the former s 68 has been re-enacted as s 67(1)(a). The language of the
present s 67(1)(a) is almost the same as that of the former s 68. The key
element in both the former s 68 and the present s 67(1)(a), is that of driving
while under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of
having proper control of such vehicle. In contrast, s 67(1)(b) makes it an
offence to have alcohol in the body beyond statutorily prescribed limits,
regardless of whether the driver has proper control of the vehicle.  
  
However, even if Mr Naidu is right, there is still no basis for saying that Mr
Sinnasamy should not have been treated as a second time offender under s
67(1). This is because s 67(1) does not draw a distinction between s 67(1)(a)
and (b) for the purposes of enhanced penalties for second time offenders. A
person is guilty of an offence under s 67(1) if he either drives while in an
intoxicated state and does not have proper control of the vehicle (s
67(1)(a)), **_or_** , if he drives while he has so much alcohol in his body
that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exceeds the prescribed limit
(s 67(1)(b)). Either way, he is guilty of the offence of `driving while under
the influence of drink` under s 67(1) and liable to the sentences prescribed
there. Thus, if he had first been convicted under s 67(1)(a), which Mr Naidu
concedes is a re-enactment of the former s 68, that would count as a first
conviction under s 67(1). If he was subsequently convicted under s 67(1)(b),
that would, on the language of the provision, be that person`s second
conviction under s 67(1), and the enhanced penalties for second time offenders
would follow.  
  
Notably, both s 67(1)(a) and (b) come under the same section heading, `Driving
while under influence of drink or drugs`. Both of them seek to discourage the
same mischief, driving while in an intoxicated state, and Parliament has made
it clear from the language of s 67(1) that, regardless of whether the first
conviction comes under s 67(1)(a) or s 67(1)(b), if someone decides time and
again to drive while in an intoxicated state, he will have to suffer the
enhanced penalties.  
  
Mr Naidu also submitted that the sentence imposed by the judge was manifestly
excessive. Mr Sinnasamy was in the process of reversing his car into a parking
lot when he hit the front bumper of another car. There was some slight damage
to the bumper, but nothing substantial. In addition, his previous conviction
occurred ten years ago. On the other hand, Mr Sinnasamy was found to have
272mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, way above the prescribed limit of 80mg of
alcohol per 100ml of blood.  
  
The judge imposed a sentence of five weeks` imprisonment, a fine of $7,000,
and disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all
classes of vehicles for a period of six years. In **PP v Lee Soon Lee
Vincent** [1998] 3 SLR 552 , the respondent, upon a second conviction under s
67(1) of the RTA, was sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment, fined $6,000 and
disqualified for four years. In that case, however, the respondent`s breath
alcohol level was over the limit by only 3mg per 100ml of breath. In this
case, Mr Sinnasamy`s blood alcohol level was over the limit by 192mg per 100ml
of blood. He exceeded the statutory limit by almost 3[half ] times. I have
said before in **Ong Beng Soon v PP** [1992] 1 SLR 731  at 733, that `A person
substantially over the limit is obviously in more flagrant violation of the
Act than a person marginally over the limit.` The sentence imposed by the
district judge was not manifestly excessive and was in fact fully justified.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
