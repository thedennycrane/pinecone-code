**JUDGMENT:**

1 The dispute in this action concerns copyright issues over certain sketches
of a framing system for fire-rated or fire-resistant glass doors and glass
screens. The second head of the claim straddles issues pertaining to breach of
confidence.

**_

The parties

_**

2 The first and second plaintiffs who initiated the proceedings are companies
incorporated in Singapore. They are in the business of manufacturing and
installing fire-rated glass-doors and glass screen systems.

3 The third plaintiffs a Belgian company came into the picture much later.
They are also in the business of making and selling fire-rated glass and are
said to be owners of copyright in drawings of their own framing systems.

4 The first and the second defendants were partners of a firm trading as KDM
Metals Glass Works (KDM). The third defendants are a private exempt company
incorporated by the first and second defendants. The third defendants are also
in the business of manufacturing and installing fire-rated glass doors and
fire-rated glass screen systems.

5 The first and the second defendants are the only two shareholders in the
third defendants. For the period between 6 August 1994 and 20 December 1997,
the first defendant was a director of the third defendants. Although the first
defendant ceased to be a director of the third defendants with effect from 20
December 1997, he continued to hold himself out as the managing director of
the third defendants.

6 The second defendant had been a director of the third defendants and that
the first and second defendants have also been responsible for the day to day
running of the third defendants business.

**_

Claims based on copyright infringement

_**

7 The first and the third plaintiffs have instituted these proceedings for
copyright infringement of their reportedly, original works. In this regard the
first plaintiffs have sued the first, third and fourth defendants for
infringing their copyright in the _preliminary sketches_ of their framing
system used in relation to fire-rated glass doors and fire-rated glass
screens. The third plaintiffs have sued the first and the third defendants for
infringing their copyright in an artistic work consisting of the design of
their framing system used in relation to fire-rated glass screens. [Highlight
added].

**_

Claims based on breach of confidence

_**

8 The first and second plaintiffs in the same action have also sued their
former sub-contractor, the first defendant for committing a breach of his
obligation of confidence for allegedly using and disclosing, without the
consent of the first and second plaintiffs, confidential information belonging
to the first and second plaintiffs to the latters detriment.

9 The first plaintiffs have also sued their former employee, the fourth
defendant, for breaching his obligation of confidence for allegedly using and
disclosing confidential information belonging to the first plaintiffs to
others without the consent of the first plaintiffs.

10 As regards the second defendant, it transpired in the course of the trial,
that the action against her had been discontinued by the first and second
plaintiffs with costs to the second defendant to be taxed if not agreed. The
third plaintiffs did not at any time make any claim against the second
defendant.

16 Insofar as the first and third defendants are concerned, the defendants say
amongst other things that annexures A and B adverted to in this case
illustrate non-proprietary principles or methods and that the said method has
been in common use in the fire-resistant glass door industry for about 20
years. They also claim that there is no infringement since the products of the
defendants would not appear to persons who are not experts in relation to such
doors to be reproductions of the plaintiffs alleged works. As regards the
claim based on breach of confidence, the first and third defendants deny that
the acts alluded to against them constitute a valid claim.

> resistant glass on a hollow steel section between fire-proof calcium
> silicate boards. The steel section and calcium silicate boards are then
> joined to form a structural frame. The gap between the fire-resistant glass
> and the calcium silicate board is filled using fire-proof materials.

Agreed facts

_**

19 Counsel for both parties, at the invitation of the court furnished the
court with a set of agreed facts and the list of issues to be decided in this
case.

20 The agreed facts as submitted by the parties are as follows:

> 1\. Sometime in May 1985, the 3rd Plaintiffs ("Glaverbel") Production
> Manager, Robert Vanderstukken ("Vanderstukken) created the design of frame
> for a fire rated fixed screen.
>
> 2\. At all material times, Glaverbel was and still is a company incorporated
> and resident in Belgium and Vanderstukken was and still is a resident in
> Belgium.
>
> 3\. The preliminary drawings of the frame design no longer exist. The frame
> design is illustrated in the University of Ghent Test Report No. 5244 dated
> 10 May 1985 ("PB/203-221"), Test Report No. 5673 dated 18 June 1987
> ("PB/222-237") and Test Report No. 6223 dated 10 May 1990 ("PB/255-271").
>
> 4\. By virtue of Regulation 3(3) and 4 of the Copyright (International
> Protection) Regulations 1990 edition, read with the Copyright (International
> Protection) (Amendment) Regulations 1996, copyright subsists in the
> preliminary drawings in Singapore with effect from 15 November 1996.
>
> 5\. Any copyright subsisting in the frame design vests in Glaverbel as
> Vanderstukken created it as an employee in the course of employment with
> Glaverbel.
>
> 6\. By reason of the above matters, Glaverbel enjoy copyright protection in
> its frame design for fire rated glass screen in Singapore.
>
> 7\. The original preliminary drawings were not shown to Loke Gim Tay
> ("Loke") or the Defendants. **[The Plaintiffs rely on the 1 st Defendants
> admission that he had seen the 3rd Plaintiffs test reports before Swissflame
> obtained their first test report WFRC Report No. SC 1262 dated 14 March
> 1995. See NE/1187-88.]**
>
> 8\. Sometime between April and July 1991, Loke using Glaverbels Test Report
> No. 5592, 6223 and 5673 as precedents created preliminary drawings of frames
> for a fire rated glass and fixed screen as an employee in the course of his
> employment with the 2nd Plaintiffs ("Flametech").
>
> 9\. Loke engaged a free-lance draughtsman to reproduce the preliminary
> drawings into shop drawings. The preliminary drawings were then destroyed or
> thrown away after the shop drawings were made. The frames contained in the
> preliminary drawings are illustrated in Annexures A and B to the Statement
> of Claim. The Defendants have never seen these preliminary drawings. For
> avoidance of doubt, the Defendants dispute having seen Annexures A and B.
> **[The Defendants say that Annexures A and B illustrate the arrangement of
> the components used to construct a fire rated glass screen and glass door.
> The Plaintiffs say that just as all the profiles of the _other_
> manufacturers illustrate the arrangement of the components used to construct
> a fire rated glass screen and glass door, each of these other profiles are
> different and can be the subject of copyright protection.]**
>
> 10\. At all material times, Flametech was and still is a company
> incorporated and resident in Singapore and Loke was and still is a resident
> in Singapore. The copyright subsisting in those preliminary drawings vests
> in Flametech as Lokes employers.
>
> 11\. Sometime in October 1992, Loke left Flametech to form his own company,
> the 1st Plaintiffs ("Flamelite"). Sometime in April 1994, Loke acquired
> Flametech.
>
> 12\. The copyright in the preliminary drawings made by Loke was assigned by
> Flametech to Flamelite with effect from 15 April 1994 by virtue of a _nunc
> pro tunc_ Deed of Assignment dated 21 May 1999.
>
> 13\. By virtue of the above assignment, Flamelite became the owners of the
> copyright in the preliminary drawings of frames made by Loke and as
> illustrated in the Annexures A and B to the Statement of Claim.

Plaintiffs evidence

_**

22 The plaintiffs called four witnesses to support their case: Mr Robert
Vanderstukken (Vanderstukken) (PW-1) of the third plaintiffs, Mr Loke Gim Tay
(Loke) (PW-2) the managing director of the first and second plaintiffs, Mr Goh
Mong Chew (Goh) (PW-3) a sub-contractor who undertook the stainless steel
works at the first plaintiffs project at Shaw House and Mr Robert Tang (Tang)
(PW-4) of Schr Mont Pte Ltd, the distributors of the third plaintiffs Pyrobel
glass in Singapore.

**_

Vanderstukken (PW-1)

_**

23 Vanderstukken outlined in his evidence how he came to design the third
plaintiffs framing system, more particularly illustrated in a report called
University of Ghent Report No 5244 in 1985. He said that since about 1977 has
been responsible for the sale and development of a fire-resistant glass which
the third plaintiffs marketed under the brand Pyrobel. He was at this time the
designer and author of a frame for holding the fire-resistant glass. The
cross-section of the frame he designed is illustrated in four test reports
prepared by the University of Ghent (Belgium) for the third plaintiffs. Copies
of these test reports No 5244, 5592, 5673 and 6233 dated 10 May 1985, 16
December 1986, 18 June 1987 and 10 May 1990 respectively could be found at
pages 203 to 271 of the plaintiffs bundle of documents. He added that he
created these designs as an employee of the third defendants in the course of
his employment with them.

24 Vanderstukken added that the third plaintiffs first sold their fire-
resistant glass in Singapore sometime in 1985 in relation to a project in
Marina Square, Singapore. _However, the third plaintiffs never sold any frames
with glass in Singapore or elsewhere_ (highlight added). Instead, the third
plaintiffs granted manufacturers of steel frames in Singapore and elsewhere
licences to manufacture frames according to the third plaintiffs designs.
These licenses were granted orally. However, the third plaintiffs did not
grant any licence to the defendants.

25 Vanderstukken detailed as to how the third plaintiffs orally licensed the
first plaintiffs through the recommendation of Tang of Schr Mont Pte Ltd, the
third plaintiffs agent in Singapore. He also said that he was aware that Tang
from time to time gave copies of the third plaintiffs brochures and test
reports to Loke.

26 He further said that he instructed Tang to consent to the first and second
plaintiffs use of the design of the third plaintiffs framing systems as
contained in their test reports, if they wanted them. He then went on to
assert that he had seen the first and second plaintiffs drawings of their
_framing systems and noted that the latter had developed their own framing
systems for the fire-rated glass doors._ [highlight added]. The third
plaintiffs framing system was only in relation to a fixed screen. The first
and second plaintiffs added a steel capping and aluminium capping to the
framing system and also modified the framing system for use in relation to a
fire rated door.

27 Touching upon the first and third defendants alleged infringing acts, it is
best that Vanderstukkens averments as appear in paras 18 to 20 of his
affidavit are reproduced. They read as follows:

> 18\. I am also advised that the Defendants produced copies of the test
> reports and brochure of the 3rd Plaintiffs glass and steel framing systems.
> As such, the Defendants clearly had access to the 3rd Plaintiffs design.
>
> 19\. At paragraphs 5 and 7 of the Amended Defence of the 1st and 3rd
> Defendants, they admitted that their framing systems were reproduced (sic)
> by using the Method illustrated in the above test reports and brochure.
>
> 20\. A comparison between the Defendants designs of their framing systems as
> evidenced in their drawings disclosed by them and the 3rd Defendants designs
> reveals a substantial similarity between the Defendants designs and the
> Plaintiffs designs. I therefore respectfully invite this Honourable Court to
> draw an inference that the 1st and 3rd Defendants copied the 3rd Plaintiffs
> design.

28 Under cross-examination, Vanderstukken agreed that the University of Ghent
Report No 5244, the first one on the series, illustrated possibly an
_elementary framing system_ (page 179 of the NE) and a _simple principle of
construction_ (page 194 of the NE). He also disclosed that the first
plaintiffs had in fact agreed to underwrite the third plaintiffs costs of the
proceedings [highlight added].

**_

Loke (PW-2)

_**

29 Loke was the principal spokesman for all the plaintiffs in these
proceedings. His evidence can be summarised as follows.

30 Loke is currently the managing director of the first and second plaintiffs.
He is a graduate in Building Management from the National University of
Singapore. After his graduation in 1983, he worked for the Singapore
Government more particularly with its Fire Safety Bureau (FSB). He
incorporated the second plaintiffs with the support of a company known as PD
International Ltd (PD). Later he resigned from the second plaintiffs to set up
the first plaintiffs although he is the majority shareholder in both the first
and second plaintiffs. He said that shortly after he joined the second
plaintiffs (incorporated in February 1991), he was handed a contract by PD to
supply fire-rated glass doors. As he became aware that fire-rated glass doors
could be sold at high prices (para 12 of his affidavit) he conceived the idea
of manufacturing them.

31 He then started thinking about the overall design and construction of a
fire-rated glass door to meet a one-hour fire rating. The structural frames or
the framing system formed only a part of the overall design of the fire rated
door.

32 He knew that the glass and frames must be fire-resistant. The frames must
be strong enough to hold the glass, which generally weighs about 100kg or
more. He did not want to use hinges at the sides of the door because fire
could penetrate through the gaps between the hinges. Covering the gaps would
be troublesome, time consuming and ugly. Regardless of where the hinges are
located, they must be strong enough to hold the weight of the glass door and
withstand the stress of the normal usage of a door.

33 He ruled out pure aluminium frames even though aluminium is light because
he knew that aluminium has a low melting point. He also felt that aluminium
might not be strong enough to carry the weight of a glass door. Timber was
also overruled because he felt that he would need to use thick timber to
withstand one hour of fire. That would make the door too thick and cumbersome.
If he were to use a pure steel frame, it would be heavy and might not be able
to withstand intense heat. He also had to consider which fire-resistant glass
to use. He then approached Tang of Schr Mont, the local agent of Pyrobel
glass.

34 He told Tang he was trying to have a fire-resistant glass door made in
Singapore and asked if he would agree to supply a few pieces of Pyrobel glass
for use in testing. He told Tang that if the second plaintiffs were successful
in their endeavours, they would buy fire- resistant glass from Schr Mont. Tang
was very supportive and agreed. This was a great help as the second plaintiffs
did not have very much capital then. He then learnt from Tang that the third
plaintiffs were his principals.

35 Sometime in May and June 1991 he received from Tang two test reports
prepared by the University of Ghent on the Pyrobel glass. The framing system
used by the third plaintiffs in the said two test reports was for a fixed
screen. _Tang told him that the framing system was meant to be a suggestion or
idea_. [highlight added] If the second plaintiffs wanted to use the third
plaintiffs framing system, they had the third plaintiffs consent to do so. The
second plaintiffs were also free to design their own framing system

36 Loke reiterated that the third plaintiffs test reports were in respect of a
fixed screen and not a door. These reports would not have been acceptable to
SISIR or FSB (Fire Safety Bureau) for the purpose of approving the fire door
and panel that the second plaintiffs wanted to build. _The second plaintiffs
needed to come up with their own framing system for their door and obtain
their own SISIR test and FSB approval._ [highlight added].

37 _He noted that the fire-resistant glass in the third plaintiffs framing
system was supported by the calcium silicate boards screwed to the steel core.
He felt that the calcium silicate boards by themselves might not be strong
enough to hold the heavy glass. He also noted that the calcium silicate boards
cracked slightly when the screws were applied through them. He was also
concerned that the calcium silicate boards might not be able to take the
stress of normal usage of the door_. He learnt that he had to pass a cyclical
test for the door, specifically that the door had to be able to turn 100,000
times without giving way. With the calcium silicate boards alone, the door
might not pass the cyclical test [highlight added].

38 He was worried about the glass falling off if people were to lean on the
glass door or panel. He felt that it was not safe to have the calcium silicate
boards exposed because over passage of time, exposure to rain, mechanical
impact and constant cleaning, the boards are likely to weaken and impair their
ability to hold the glass firmly.

39 Moreover, the exposed calcium silicate boards might not look presentable
and as such needed to be covered. After much thought, he decided to add steel-
capping to the calcium silicate boards. The steel capping would not only
protect the calcium silicate boards from the elements but it would also
increase the framing systems resistance to fire.

He then set the screws through the steel capping, the calcium silicate boards
and the hollow steel core. By this design, the weight of the glass would be
supported by the steel-capping and core. Other ways of affixing the steel-
capping such as putting the steel capping around the entire calcium silicate
board or an inverted C steel- capping were considered and rejected. To the
best of his knowledge, until the second plaintiffs did so, no one else had
done this in Singapore.

41 _He added that by_ _merely studying the third plaintiffs fixed screen, he
could not convert the screen into a door. Making a door required
considerations, among other things, to be given to_ :

> (a) _hanging the door_ ;
>
> (b) _use of intumescent strips_ ;
>
> (c) _capping_ ; and
>
> (d) _fixing lock-sets and handles which require the cutting of an opening
> through the stiles and frame_.
>
> [highlight added].

42 How should he then fix the fire glass door to the frame? Without hinges at
the side of the door, the door had to be hung via the top and bottom rails. To
him the answer lay in the use of pivot hinges which could support the weight
of the door and withstand the stress caused by its swinging action.

43 The use of pivot hinges was common in the industry. There was nothing
special about making this selection. The plaintiffs were not claiming
proprietary right to such use. However, the way he laid the door-straps in the
top and bottom rails of the plaintiffs door was peculiar to the plaintiffs and
is confidential. This is not known to any one in the trade other than the sub-
contractors who worked for and are working for the plaintiffs.

44 The door-strap cannot be fixed onto calcium silicate. Calcium silicate is
brittle and would not be able to take the stress caused by the swinging action
of the door. He had to attach the door-strap directly to the steel core. To do
this, he removed a portion of the calcium silicate cladding. This however
created two problems. First, the door- strap would be too low and only a short
length of the pivot can be inserted into it. This may cause the pivot to slip
out of the strap resulting in the door falling off. Next, there would be a gap
through which fire can pass easily.

45 To solve the first problem, he reinforced the door-strap by placing steel
plates on top of it, so that the pivot would not slip so easily. As for the
gaps, he filled it up with intumescent strips. In the event of a fire, the
strips would intumesce and seal the gap between the frame and the rails.

46 Each intumescent strip is made up of layers of intumescent material. He
caused the strips to be laid in such a manner that they would fill the gaps as
they expanded. How he used the intumescent strips is confidential to the
plaintiffs.

47 He also used intumescent seals to address the gaps between the three sides
of the door and the frame, and the meeting stiles of double leaf doors. As
stated above, the intumescent material would expand under heat and cover the
gaps to prevent fire penetration.

48 One of the things he did was to test the various types of intumescent fire
seals to select one that he preferred. He tested with polysulphide based
intumescent compound and palusol intumescent strips. He found that the
polysulphide based intumescent compound became a loose cluster of spongy mass
after burning. It disintegrated and was blown off easily by moving air. In
contrast, the palusol intumescent strips formed a hard charcoal like compound
after burning and did not disintegrate easily. He therefore selected the use
of palusol fire seal.

49 _In referring to the tests done with the intumescent fire seals above, he
said that he was not claiming proprietary right to the intumescent fire seal
selected by him but was narrating a part of the process in arriving at the
second plaintiffs design for their fire door. However, the steel capping did
not look very nice. So he thought of adding an aesthetic capping to the steel-
capping_[highlight added].

**_

Creation of sketches and shop drawings

_**

50 Before engaging a subcontractor to fabricate a specimen for testing, he
needed to provide the subcontractor with shop drawings.

51 He was no draughtsman so he drew sketches of the elevation and cross
sections of the framing system. At the suggestion of the foreman of PD, he
included a fixed screen around the door. This was to enable the second
plaintiffs to use the SISIR report to obtain FSB approval in the event that
his company is asked to provide fixed screens without a door. He passed the
sketches to a draughtsman who was doing freelance work called Seah Ke Wait
(Seah) to reproduce the sketches in shop drawings for the second plaintiffs.

52 Seah was not required to and did not give any input to the designs of the
fire-rated door, panel or frames. Seah just followed Lokes sketches and
reproduced them into shop drawings. When Seah finished the drawings, he showed
them to Loke for his approval. Loke believed that he made some amendments to
the first shop drawings and asked Seah to incorporate the amendments, which
the latter did. On behalf of the second plaintiffs, he paid Seah for the shop
drawings.

53 He was not able to produce the sketches he drew as they had either been
destroyed or thrown away after the shop drawings were made. He designed the
fire-rated glass doors and panel and the framing system in the course of his
employment with the second plaintiffs.

54 _His design was not necessarily better than or an improvement over the
prevailing designs at that time_. Whatever may be the merits or otherwise of
his design, it is still his own creation made from his own knowledge, effort
and time, and are not slavish copies of other designs. (highlight added)

**_

Modifications/Additions to the third plaintiffs framing system

_**

55 _Whilst he derived the idea from the third plaintiffs framing system, he
did not copy the third plaintiffs drawings as illustrated in the University of
Ghent Reports. At any rate, the third plaintiffs framing system was for a
fixed screen and not a door. It was not possible to use the third plaintiffs
framing system without any modifications at all_. [highlight added.]

56 He modified the third plaintiffs framing system by adding:

> (a) a steel capping over the calcium silicate board and putting the screws
> through the steel capping;
>
> (b) intumescent seals along the top rail, bottom rail and stiles of the
> door;
>
> (c) pivot hinges at the top and bottom rails of the door;
>
> (d) door handles; and
>
> (e) lock-sets.

57 The third plaintiffs framing system, however, did not have any of the above
features.

**_

The third plaintiffs consent

_**

58 Insofar as the second plaintiffs framing system was derived from the third
plaintiffs framing system, the second plaintiffs had the consent of the third
plaintiffs to do so.

**_

Confidential information

_**

59 The following according to Loke are confidential information belonging to
the second plaintiffs as well as the first plaintiffs:

> (a) the plaintiffs shop drawings containing the design of the plaintiffs
> framing system and the design itself;
>
> (b) the plaintiffs peculiar method of laying the door straps with steel
> plates and intumescent strips around them; and
>
> (c) the plaintiffs peculiar method of affixing the aesthetic cladding.

60 When he took over the second plaintiffs from PD, he assigned the copyright
in the design of the framing system to the first plaintiffs. (see PB-411 for a
copy of the copyright assignment made n _unc pro tunc_ (now for then) and
dated 21 May 1999).

**_

Confidentiality

_**

61 Loke asserted that he had told the first defendant that the door and glass
screen system in the shop drawings were the plaintiffs design. He would not
have given the first defendant the second plaintiffs drawings or showed him
the second plaintiffs confidential methods if the first defendant was not
about to be engaged as the second plaintiffs sub-contractor.

62 Besides KDM and other sub-contractors of the plaintiffs, drawings of the
plaintiffs (but not the confidential methods) were shown only to Singapore
Institute of Scientific & Industrial Research (SISIR) and Fire Safety Board
(FSB), Warrington Fire Research, their main contractors, architects and their
potential and actual customers.

63 In the case of SISIR, it was for the purpose of testing the fire-rating of
the products. The practice of SISIR has always been to keep such drawings
confidential and not pass them to other contractors for their manufacture or
use.

64 In the case of FSB it was to get approval for the use of the fire-rated
glass doors and/or glass screens in a particular building and/or area. Again,
their practice has always been to keep these applications confidential.

65 Loke maintained that the design of the plaintiffs framing system has not
entered into the public domain even though their fire-rated glass doors and
glass screens have been installed in public places.

**_

Employment of the fourth defendant

_**

66 Loke said that on 19 November 1992, the first plaintiffs employed the
fourth defendant as a Technical Services Executive.

67 Among his responsibilities were:

> (a) to deliver the technical/shop drawings to the sub-contractor,
> contractors and architects;
>
> (b) to ensure proper workmanship at the sites; and
>
> (c) to liaise with KDM.

68 The fourth defendant had access to the plaintiffs drawings and knew that
those drawings were proprietary to the first plaintiffs because Loke told him
so.

69 Loke terminated the fourth defendants employment with the plaintiffs on 30
June 1994. Subsequently and at a date unknown to the plaintiffs, the fourth
defendant joined the third defendants.

70 Loke _added that as an ex-employee who had seen the plaintiffs drawings,
the fourth defendant knew or ought to have known that the third defendants
framing systems infringed the plaintiffs framing system. Yet he continued to
offer to sell or sell the third defendants product. By doing so, he has
infringed the plaintiffs copyright._ [highlight added]

71 Loke claimed that the fourth defendant owed the first plaintiffs a duty to
act in good faith. That includes the duty not to disclose or use the first
plaintiffs confidential information. Loke alleged that the fourth defendant
breached this duty when he offered to sell or sold products based on the first
plaintiffs confidential information.

**_

Cross examination of Loke

_**

72 It is not necessary at this stage to dwell at length on the replies Loke
gave during his cross-examination. They will be referred to, if necessary at a
later stage. However, two significant aspects require mention. In a set of
brochures (PB-322 to PB-324) produced by Loke, there was a claim by the first
plaintiffs that one of their glass-frame designs called compartment lite was a
patented product. When Loke was confronted by defendants counsel whether he
had any patent for such a design, he conceded that it was not. He tried to
explain that owing to the proximity of time between the printing of the
brochures in the course of 1994 and 1996 and legal advice on the matter, he
did not have time to correct the false impression (pages 397 and 506-511 of
the NE). It is pertinent to observe at this stage that a false claim of having
a patent most certainly offends s 100(1) of the Patents Act (Cap 221) which
provides that:

> 100.-(1) If a person falsely represents that anything disposed of by him for
> value is a patented product, he shall, subject to this section, be guilty of
> an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000
> or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.
>
> **__**

Goh (PW-3)

73 Goh Mong Chew, the sole proprietor of one Unique Stainless Steel and Iron
Works who were in the business of supplying, fabricating and installing
stainless steel and iron works said in his evidence that sometime in 1992, he
was asked by Loke to fabricate and instal stainless steel framing systems for
use in relation to fire-rated glass screens and doors at Shaw House,
Singapore. In the course of such works he agreed at Lokes request that the
provision and installation of the fire-resistant glass be carried out by Lokes
sub-contractor, Lam Heng Chung (DW-1) (Lam). After the Shaw House project, Goh
had no business dealings with Lam. However, sometime in 1996 Lam approached
him and asked for the plaintiffs shop drawings in respect of the Shaw House
project but his request was rejected by Goh.

74 An observation is appropriate at this stage. It would seem that the purport
of Gohs evidence was to show that Lam was bent on copying the plaintiffs shop
drawings. The immateriality of Gohs testimony was however admitted by the
plaintiffs counsel when he said _(page 832, lines 15 to 19 of the NE)
"actually the impression I had was that Mr Lam needed the drawings from Mr Goh
so that he could copy them. That impression has since been removed by the
production of the defendants drawings"_ (pages 832 to 834 of the NE)
[highlight added.]

**_

Tang (PW-4)

_**

75 Tangs evidence can be summarised as follows. He is presently a director of
Schr-Mont Pte Ltd (Schr-Mont), the local agent for the third plaintiffs
architectural glass and mirrors and has been importing the Pyrobel brand of
fire-resistant glass from the third plaintiffs. Schr-Mont sells only fire-
resistant glass without the framing system. In his testimony, he said that he
gave Loke copies of the third plaintiffs test reports prior to Loke embarking
on his designing exercise. He claimed that he facilitated Lokes design process
by sending it to the third plaintiffs for their comments and acted as a
conduit between them. He conceded that he could not read technical drawings.

**_

Defendants evidence

_**

76 There were altogether six defence witnesses: Mr Lam Heng Chung (DW-1),
(Lam) the first defendant (who is also a shareholder and director of the third
defendants); Mr Wu Kum Fei (DW-2) (Wu) the fourth defendant; Mr Chan Chee Kien
(DW-3), a technical sales manager of Saint-Gobain Exprover (St Gobain),
manufacturers of architectural and fire-proof glasses; Mr Chan Hon Lam (DW-4),
the managing director of a company known as Esai Trading Pte Ltd which largely
deals in glass products; Mr Chew Chye Heng (DW-5), an Associate Professor in
the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering in the National
University of Singapore and Mr Stephen Kettle (DW-6), the Regional Manager of
a company known as Warrington Fire Research (S) Pte Ltd. The second defendant
Sim Bee Hoon who is the wife of the first defendant was not required to make
her appearance since proceedings had been discontinued against her.

**_

Lam (DW-1)

_**

77 The evidence of Lam is as follows.

78 He is a shareholder and director of the third defendants. He first came to
know Loke of the plaintiffs around 1992. He was introduced to him because Loke
needed someone to continue the completion of the works on some doors which the
first plaintiffs were installing at Ocean Building at Raffles Place.
Apparently, the first plaintiffs had engaged another subcontractor to
undertake those works but that subcontractor had abandoned the works halfway.
The first plaintiffs needed someone to complete the works and it was then that
he came into the picture.

79 Lam had previous experience in installing aluminium and steel-framed doors
and windows. However, when he was told that the doors in question were to be
fire-rated glass doors, he was a little apprehensive because he had not
undertaken such work before but he was prepared to give it a try.

80 In the event, one Ms Michelle Loke of the first plaintiffs took him to
their factory and showed him around. _He learnt during that visit that the
only difference between ordinary metal-framed glass doors and fire-rated glass
doors was that fire-rated glass was used in place of ordinary plate glass, and
the joint between the glass and the metal frame was covered with a piece of
fire-board before the external metal capping was applied._ [highlight added]

81 Lam was neither told that there was any secret in respect of the first and
second plaintiffs method at that meeting; nor was he informed that the method
of construction alluded to was confidential in any way before, during or after
that visit. He felt confident that he could undertake the works in a good and
professional manner. Consequently, he accepted the assignment and did complete
the works. The first plaintiffs were evidently happy with his work since they
continued to engage him for subsequent jobs. Over the next several years, he
undertook numerous jobs for the first plaintiffs, including rectification
works at Tanjong Pagar MRT Station which was first installed in the 1980s by a
company known as Esai Trading. The glass was defective and had to be replaced.
He undertook that particular job and completed it.

82 In all the jobs he undertook as a subcontractor for the first plaintiffs,
the first plaintiffs would be responsible for ordering and supplying the glass
in the specified size from the manufacturers. The fourth defendant, Wu would
normally be the person who liaised with Lam on the dimensions of the steel
frame and the thickness of the calcium silicate fire-board to be used.
Instructions were relayed to Lam by the fourth defendant by way of rough hand-
drawn sketches which set out the necessary dimensions. No copies of these
sketches were ever kept. The materials for the steel frame as well as the
calcium silicate fire boards were all standard material from third-party
suppliers. Lam maintained that he had never, prior to these proceedings, seen
the second plaintiffs drawings as shown in annexures A and B in the plaintiffs
statement of claim.

83 The last job which he did for the first plaintiffs was the installation of
fire-rated glass panels at Alfa Centre along Bukit Timah Road. Following a
dispute with the first plaintiffs which is not relevant to these proceedings,
his business relationship with the first plaintiffs and Loke ceased.

**_

Relationship with the fourth defendant

84 Lam came to know Wu, the fourth defendant, when he undertook jobs from the
first plaintiffs. Lam did not have contact with Wu for some time when Lam
ceased working with the first plaintiffs after the Alfa Centre project. When
Lam met Wu again, he learnt that Wu had left the first plaintiffs and had been
working for sometime with one Radiantech Engineering Pte Ltd and later as a
freelance fire-protection consultant.

85 Wu and Lam discussed the possibility of working together. Lam learnt that
the fourth defendant had contacts with a few major glass manufacturers whereas
for his part Lam had the requisite experience in metal fabrication. In the
event, Wu joined the third defendants as their technical manager.

**_

Business of the third defendants

_**

86 Lam mentioned that the third defendants were able to obtain distributorship
rights for the following major glass manufacturers:

> (a) Pilkington Glass Ltd;
>
> (b) Saint-Gobain Exprover;
>
> (c) Securiglass Company Ltd;
>
> (d) Schott Glas; and
>
> (e) Promat International

87 Lam asserted that the third defendants designs (which the plaintiffs
complain as being infringement of their copyright) were put together by them
using the fire-rated glass of the manufacturers whom the third defendants
represent. Neither Wu nor Lam did, in any way, refer or try to reproduce the
sketches of the first plaintiffs from the time KDM did work for the first
plaintiffs. Lam added that although there are similarities in the designs,
they are dictated by the shape of the door and a common method known in the
industry. According to Lam, a detailed examination of the allegedly infringing
drawings and annexures A and B would show that the dimensions all differ. Only
the method is common.

88 Lam averred that to his knowledge, the method mentioned is the most
commonly used framing system and has been in existence for as long as the
insulating glass market. Lam added that the method mentioned is the simplest,
easiest and most basic means of constructing a fire rated glass door. He said
that the plaintiffs are trying, by means of this suit, to claim proprietary
rights over the said method for the purposes of stifling competition and
stopping legitimate competitors from using the said method. He said that the
plaintiffs should not be allowed, by employing a copyright claim, to gain a
monopoly over the said method which is a basic means of assembling fire rated
glass doors.

Wu (DW-2)

_**

89 The evidence of the fourth defendant, who is the technical manager of the
third defendants, is as follows.

90 He was employed by the first plaintiffs as a technical sales executive from
about December 1992 until June 1994. Prior to joining the first plaintiffs he
worked in the construction industry and was involved in general construction
work. He had some exposure to the work of manufacturing and assembling doors,
structural frames, screens and panels. One of his previous employers was the
now-defunct South Seas Construction Pte Ltd.

91 Sometime in mid-1994, he left the employ of the first plaintiffs after a
disagreement with Loke. This disagreement came about over works undertaken by
the first plaintiffs at a project in Alfa Centre along Bukit Timah Road. There
was a dispute between the first plaintiffs and the main contractor over the
type of steel finishing for the project. Loke felt that Wu was to blame for
the dispute, a view Wu declined to accept. He therefore tendered his
resignation and left the employ of the first plaintiffs.

92 After he resigned from the first plaintiffs, he joined one Radiantech
Engineering Pte Ltd from July 1994 to March 1995. During the period of his
employment with Radiantech, he gained much insight into the workings of the
fire-protection industry. Later he left Radiantech and after six months of
freelance work joined the third defendants as their technical manager on or
around March 1995.

Scope of duties with the first plaintiffs, Flamelite (S) Pte Ltd

_**

93 During his employment with the first plaintiffs, he was mostly assigned to
supervise on-site work. He was also assigned tasks like taking delivery of
supplies ordered by the first plaintiffs, convening and attending site-
meetings as the first plaintiffs representative; and generally ensuring that
works were carried out properly and in accordance with the contract entered
into. He was also responsible for taking site measurements and relaying them
to the first plaintiffs for further action. He denied that he was ever given
or entrusted with information which was told to him to be confidential by the
first plaintiffs.

94 One of his duties whilst in the employ of the first plaintiffs included
relaying instructions to the other parties. In this connection, Loke would
sometimes sketch out technical instructions and give them to him for onward
transmission to subcontractors. These sketches were very rudimentary. He often
had to redraw Lokes sketches as neatly and legibly as he could before they
were sent to sub-contractors and/or architects for action.

95 He was aware that the first plaintiffs had technical documents from the
manufacturer of the "Pyrobel" glass. However, throughout his employment with
the first plaintiffs he never saw any of those documents as Loke kept them
strictly "under wraps". He had also never seen the drawings in annexures A and
B of the statement of claim and the first time he had sight of them was when
he was served with the Writ of Summons in this action.

96 Subsequently when working for the third defendants, his employers, he
designed fire-rated door frames wherein the fire-rated glass was mounted on a
steel frame and the gap between the glass and steel was covered with calcium
silicate. To his knowledge, this is the most basic method of constructing
fire-rated glass doors. He asserted that he did not in any way copy Lokes
sketches as he did not think about them at any time.

97 He further said that throughout the period of his employment with the first
plaintiffs, his employers never imparted to him any knowledge or skill
pertaining to fabricating or assembling the components of the fire-rated glass
systems nor did they provide him with any special training in this field. To
the best of his knowledge and belief, he received no confidential information
or material whilst in the first plaintiffs employ. He denied that he ever
disclosed any information or material of a confidential nature belonging to
the first plaintiffs to the third defendants or to anyone else at any time.

98 The evidence of Associate Professor Chew and Mr Stephen Kettle (DW-4) was
that the plaintiffs framing system is elementary and basic. Insofar as is
material, paras 1, 2, 3, 14, 15 and 16 of Associate Professor Chews report
dated 8 February 2000 require reproduction and read as follows:

Mr Stephen Kettle (DW-4)

_**

99 Mr Stephen Kettle who holds a diploma in Advanced Timber Technology and an
Associate of the Institute of Wood Science and a person involved in the fire
protection industry for over 20 years, testified that there are two basic
approaches to assembling a framing system. According to him, either the
component providing mechanical support is located in line with the edge of the
glass and both sides are clad with an insulating component or the insulating
material is placed in line with the glass edge and steel plates or beads are
applied to both sides (para 21 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief). In his
opinion the plaintiffs used the first method.

100 According to Mr Kettle the entire system generally comprises the
following:

> (a) The glass panel;
>
> (b) An intumescent fire seal;
>
> (c) A structural frame made out of a hollow mild steel section;
>
> (d) Calcium silicate building boards;
>
> (e) Metal capping for the calcium silicate boards; and
>
> (f) Edge sealing materials.

101 After examining the drawings of glazed construction by both the plaintiffs
and the defendants, he opined in paras 26 and 27 of his affidavit as follows:

> 26\. _I express no opinion whatsoever on whether the Defendants drawings
> have been copied from the Plaintiffs. However, I would state that all the
> drawings appear to be typical examples of the first method of constructing a

> within a steel frame and "sandwiching" the glass between two outer layers of
> insulating material._
>
> 27\. _It is my understanding that technically similar basic designs have
> been in existence for some time, and have been previously tested by others
> in conjunction with other proprietary types of insulating glass._ [highlight

Chan Hon Lam (DW-4)

_**

102 Chan Hon Lams evidence insofar as is material, can be stated as follows.

103 He first became involved in the glass industry sometime around 1980. Up
till about 1985, he worked for Lindeteves Jacoberg Ltd (Lindeteves Jacoberg),
which is the exclusive agent for St Gobain glass in Singapore. He left
Lindeteves Jacoberg in late 1986 or early 1987 to set up Esai Trading Pte Ltd.

104 The St Gobain glass systems which Lindeteves Jacoberg dealt with, were
imported from Europe fully assembled. They were then installed on site. The
imported systems have already been tested and certified by the relevant
testing authorities such as the University of Ghent to European standards.
Authorization to install these systems in Singapore is issued by the Fire
Safety Bureau (FSB) based on the accompanying test reports and manufacturers
certificates.

105 After he left Lindeteves Jacoberg and set up Esai Trading Pte Ltd in late
1986 or early 1987, he continued the practice of importing fully assembled
systems. He purchased his product from a Belgian company manufacturing frames,
known as Arteliers Meyvaert (Meyvaert). Maeyvert uses Contraflam glass (also
manufactured by St. Gobain) in their systems.

106 Sometime in 1987, Meyvaert offered to grant him a license to assemble
their glass systems in Singapore. From the test reports it can be seen that
the principle involved in the construction of the Meyvaert system is simple
_the fire-rated glass is mounted on a steel channel and sandwiched between
fire insulating boards made of calcium silicate or vermiculite and then capped
with a metal finish. Such systems are relatively easy to construct._

Chan Chee Kien (DW-3)

_**

107 Chan Chee Kien, the technical sales manager of St. Gobain, produced two
reports: EMPA No 46245 dated 27 July 1982 and EMPA No 43171 dated 10 February
1981 (DB-376 to DB-402). If one were to view the drawing in DB-389 (read with
the translation thereof in DB-382) and also DB-402 with DB-396, the framing
system bespoken had been in existence in Europe since about 1981.

**_

Issues, arguments and conclusion

_**

108 With the foregoing evidence in the background, I now propose to deal with
the issues raised in this case.

**_

The first issue

_**

_Whether the defendants infringed the plaintiffs copyright by copying both the
idea and expression of the plaintiffs copyrighted works or whether the
defendants copied only the idea (namely the method of construction) but not
the expression of the plaintiffs copyright._

109 The plaintiffs counsels submission in regard to this issue (para 32(a) to
(g) )is that:

> (a) _copyright subsists in the preliminary sketches of the first plaintiffs
> framing systems though the latter may look simple. The sketches thus made
> are not slavish copies of the third plaintiffs drawings which are limited
> only to a fixed screen. The sketches adverted to include a framing system
> for a door and a C-channel for the frames, elements of which are material
> embellishments to the third plaintiffs drawings. Moreover, the third
> plaintiffs acknowledged that the copyright in Lokes drawings belonged to the
> first plaintiffs and not to the third plaintiffs in Mr Vanderstukkens
> affidavit._ [highlight added]
>
> (b) The third defendants drawings and products made in accordance with them
> clearly infringed the plaintiffs copyright. This is evidenced by the first
> defendants access, and through him the third and fourth defendants access,
> to the plaintiffs drawings and test reports, coupled with the substantial
> similarities (to the extent of near exact reproduction) between the
> plaintiffs drawings and the defendants drawings.
>
> (c) As a matter of law and contrary to the defendants contention, there is
> no requirement in this case for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants
> products were near exact reproduction of the plaintiffs drawings to the
> extent that the same dimensions and the same materials must be used.
>
> (d) In any case, the defendants drawings are near exact reproductions of the
> plaintiffs drawings even if different materials are used and/or slightly
> different dimensions are used.
>
> (e) In this case, contrary to the defendants contention that they copied
> only the idea in the plaintiffs drawings, the defendants copied the material
> expression of the plaintiffs works.
>
> (f) A notional non-expert is entitled to look at the internal parts of the
> defendants products to compare the same with the plaintiffs drawings so as
> to determine whether they are substantially similar. So comparing, the non-
> expert will find that the defendants drawings are substantially similar to
> the plaintiffs drawings even to the extent of being near exact reproduction.
>
> (g) For the reasons above, the first, third and fourth defendants have
> clearly infringed the first plaintiffs copyright in the preliminary sketches
> of their framing system.

110 In addition, plaintiffs counsel endeavoured to highlight in para 74 of his
submission that the plaintiffs who had a concept as to how to make their
framing system, put that concept into a material expression ie, the sketches
and from these sketches the shop drawings were made. And from those shop
drawings the fire doors and glass screens were produced. The plaintiffs, he
argued, are seeking to protect their copyright in their material expression.

111 At this stage it is perhaps instructive to recall a few well-established
principles on the laws of copyright as annotated by the authors of Copinger
and Skone James on Copyright (14th Edn). They say in paras 7 to 10 of their
work:

> In dealing with the question of copying, there should be borne in mind the
> well established principle that there is no copyright in mere ideas,
> concepts, schemes, systems or methods. Rather, the object of copyright is to
> prevent the copying of the particular form of expression in which these
> things are conveyed. If the expression is not copied, copyright is not
> infringed. Thus, to be liable, the defendant must have made a substantial
> use of this form; he is not liable if he has taken from the work the
> essential idea, however original, and expressed the idea in his own form, or
> used the idea for his own purposes. Protection of this kind can only be
> obtained, if at all, under patent law or the law relating to confidential
> information.

112 The authors go on to comment later in the same para:

> It is not a correct statement of English law that because a copyright work
> contains the expression of an idea it may be copied; nor that if there is
> only one way of expressing an idea, then that way cannot be the subject of
> copyright; nor that where the expression of an idea is inseparable from its
> function, it form part of the idea and is not entitled to copyright
> protection. The correct position is that although copyright cannot prevent
> the copying of a general idea, where the idea has been worked out in detail
> in the form of writing, drawings, etc., it will be an infringement if the
> labour which went into the expression of the idea is appropriated. In such a
> case, it is not the idea which has been copied but its detailed expression.

113 The foregoing principles are extracted from a number of leading cases,
chief amongst them are: **_LB (Plastics) Ltd v Swish Products Ltd_** [1979]
RPC 551 at 619, 633, HL; **_Johnstone Safety Limited v Peter Cook (Int) PLC
And Another_** (1990) FSR 161 (CA); and **_Harman Pictures N V v Osborne_**
[1967] 1 WLR 723 at 728.

114 In this context, it is equally important to remember that the fact that
the plaintiffs work might have been the chief prod or inspiration for the
defendants output will not of itself render the defendants work an
infringement (para 8-54, Copinger 13th Edn and **_Baumann v Fussell_** [1978]
RPC 485).

115 An obviously discordant feature in the plaintiffs case is that what
apparently started as a claim for an infringement of copyright in the
"_plaintiffs engineering shop drawings, designs and systems on the fabrication
and construction_ " (see the deleted para 2 of the original statement of
claim) transformed itself into a claim for an alleged infringement of the
_plaintiffs copyright in the "preliminary drawings"_ which a little later
metamorphosed into an infringement of the plaintiffs "_preliminary sketches_
". The said preliminary sketches themselves are admittedly lost according to
the plaintiffs. What they have now is a set of drawings (annexures A and B to
the statement of claim) which, they say, evidence or contain the original
authentic works.

116 The defendants position as advanced by their counsel is this: That the
annexures A and B referred to by the plaintiffs in this suit illustrate
nothing but a non-proprietary principle or method which has been common use in
the industry in Singapore since at least since 1991 and in Europe since last
1981 in relation to the construction of fire-rated glass doors and structural
frames. The method, according to the defendants, involves mounting fire
resistant glass on a hollow steel section, sandwiched between calcium silicate
boards before being capped. The defendants assert, secondly that the method
adverted to has come about as a matter of form following function.
Additionally, the defendants stoutly deny that they had ever seen or had
possession of those preliminary sketches. In fact it would appear from the
evidence that those sketches are no longer in existence; nor is there any
suggestion that the defendants have made reproductions of those preliminary
sketches. Both annexures A and B as well as the University of Ghent Reports
and the accompanying drawings are said to be nothing but evidence of the said
drawings.

117 The first and second plaintiffs through Loke claim that Loke developed the
design on his own although he is admittedly no expert in technical matters of
fire protection. Loke said that his redoubled effort in developing his own
design and the consequent copyright therein had been wrongfully infringed by
the first and the third defendants. Oddly, however, the third plaintiffs who
seemed to have made their entry rather late in the proceedings also maintain
that their copyright (in respect of the drawings in the Ghent Report) had also
been infringed by the defendants.

118 In my opinion, there is first of all, a perceptible inconsistency between
the claim of the first and the second plaintiffs and that of the third
plaintiffs. Let me amplify. Lokes evidence (para 32(a) of the plaintiffs
counsels submission) is that the framing system developed by the third
plaintiffs was for fixed screens only. Furthermore, Tang who has been
representing the third plaintiffs at the relevant period has intimated to Loke
that the third plaintiffs framing system is no more than a suggestion or idea
and that Loke had the blessings of the third plaintiffs to make use of their
design whatever its worth (para 27 of Lokes affidavit). According to Loke
(para 55 of his affidavit) his design in relation to screen as well as door is
his own creation born of his own thinking, effort and time and is certainly
not a slavish copy of any others.

119 If the foregoing assertions are correct, can the third plaintiffs, whose
designs are admittedly mere ideas, having expressly authorised the first and
second plaintiffs to make use of their designs in the development of the
latters altogether a fresh and new-fangled design, now come to court and mount
an independent claim against the defendants? Did the defendants copy the works
of the first and the second plaintiffs or that of the third plaintiffs? If the
claim of the first and the second plaintiffs is correct, then the third
plaintiffs who had given their consent to the first and the second plaintiffs
to enhance their framing system have, by simple deduction, no legitimate basis
to maintain this claim. In my view, there appears to be a degree of unwitting
duplication and double-counting as well as a substantial measure of
inconsistency between the claims of the first and the second plaintiffs on the
one hand and that of the third plaintiffs on the other.

120 To compound the issue, a surprise revelation was made by Vanderstukken
during the proceedings, admitting that there is in existence an agreement
between the first and the second plaintiffs with the third plaintiffs whereby
the latters costs in this action would be underwritten by the former. This
disclosure no doubt raised the spectre of abuse of legal process and is indeed
suggestive that there is a concerted effort by the plaintiffs to maintain a
vindictive process against the defendants. In my view, insofar as the third
plaintiffs claim is concerned, besides the admission by Vanderstukken that his
design is somewhat elementary and involves a simple principle of construction,
it also seems to collapse under its own inconsistency adverted to earlier. I
shall return to this later.

121 Reverting to the first and second plaintiffs claim, there is in my view no
satisfactory evidence to conclude that the defendants had copied or
appropriated the first and second plaintiffs preliminary sketches. In this
respect, what Lam, the first defendant, says in para 10 of his affidavit is as
follows:

> 10\. In all the jobs I undertook as subcontractor for the 1st Plaintiffs,
> the 1st Plaintiffs would be responsible for ordering and supplying the glass
> in the specified size from the manufacturer. I had no contact with the
> clients or the glass manufacturer. The 4th Defendant would normally be the
> person who liaised with me to give instructions on the dimensions of the
> steel frame to be used, as well thickness of the calcium silicate fire-board
> to be used. Instructions were relayed to us by the 4th Defendant vide rough
> hand-drawn sketches setting out the necessary dimensions. No copies of these
> sketches were kept.

122 In my determination what Lam says above appears to have an impress of
truth. At any rate, the plaintiffs claim based on copyright infringement in
the plaintiffs preliminary sketches does not take them far.

123 I need at this stage to make reference to a decision by the English Court
of Appeal in **_Johnstone Safety Limited v Peter Cook (Int) PLC And Anor_**
[1990] FSR 161. The facts of this case bear a close resemblance to the facts
in the present case. The facts of the case and the decision as appear from the
report can be summarised as follows.

124 The plaintiffs sued the defendants for infringement of copyright in a
drawing relating to a hollow, stackable traffic cone to be made of plastic
material; this was referred to as the 18-inch C-type cone. They also relied,
_inter alia_ , on drawings of an earlier design of traffic cone namely the
B-type cone. The trial judge (Whitford J) held that copyright in the drawing
for the C-type cone had been infringed by the defendants 18-inch cones, there
having been copying by the defendants of a substantial part of the drawing for
the 18-inch C-type cone. The defendants appealed and on appeal challenged the
originality of the drawings for the C-type cone in the light of the earlier
drawings for the B-type cone. The defendants also challenged the trial judges
finding as to the credibility of M, the plaintiffs former director, who had
later joined the defendants to supervise the production of the 18-inch traffic
cones in issue. There was no defence based on section 9(8) of the Copyright
Act 1956 (non-expert defence).

125 After agreeing that the plaintiffs drawing for the 18-inch C-type cone was
original, the Court of Appeal in allowing the appeal of the defendants held
that the plaintiffs had no right to prevent the use of functional ideas
incorporated in the traffic cones which they produced. This included certain
design features, namely the hexagonal base, the collar above the base and the
skirt with step and upturned lip, which were all known in the industry.

126 The authors of Copinger (13th Edn) list three types of infringements in
relation to architects plans and works of architecture. They are: infringement
of plan by plan; infringement of plan by building and infringement of building
by building. Insofar as the plaintiffs grievances appear somewhat similar to
the infringements listed, it bears to reproduce what the authors of Copinger
say in paras 8-72 to 8-75:

> **Architects plans and works of architecture.** It has already been seen
> that copyright may subsist in both architects plans and in the works of
> architecture themselves. Architects are therefore concerned with
> infringements of their rights in three different forms. These are the
> copying of plans in the form of other plans, the copying of plans in the
> form of buildings, and the copying of a building by another building. The
> copying of a building by a two-dimensional representation, such as a
> photograph or drawing, is not an infringement.
>
> **
>
> Infringement of plan by plan.
>
> ** Where plans are alleged to be infringed by other plans or sketches, the
> question to be decided is similar to that arising in connection with other
> artistic works. **
>
> Infringement of plan by building.
>
> ** As an example of the second type of infringement, it has been held that
> an architects elevation representing a shop front was infringed by the
> erection of an actual shop incorporating the elevation, on the ground that
> the same was a reproduction of the elevation "in a material form." It is
> submitted that this decision is confined to cases in which the apperance of
> the complete building appeals to the eye as being a reproduction of what
> appears on the architects plan or elevation, and that it would not be an
> infringement of the copyright in a plan, such as a ground plan, to erect a
> building based thereon, if the resulting erection bore no resemblance to the
> plan except when dissected and measured. But if a completed structure
> appears to the eye to be a reproduction of what appears in a floor plan then
> it will be an infringement. **
>
> Infringement of building by building.
>
> ** The third form of infringement is confined to copying that in which
> copyright subsists, namely the features of the building having artistic
> quality. Copyright is infringed by something which, to the eye, is a copy of
> the original, and the use of processes or methods of construction would not,

> slavishly copied down to the smallest detail, there seems no good reason for
> depriving him of the right to complain. Slight differences between buildings
> of no marked originality will prevent them from being held to be copies of
> each other_ , which would not be the case if the buildings were of an
> original character. [Highlight added]

127 It would appear from the manner in which the case is fought, the
plaintiffs position appears to be that the defendants have copied their work
in the door frames and screens both externally and internally. In this
connection if one were to retrace the events laboriously narrated by Loke in
his affidavit, it would seem that he lay great emphasis on the skill and
labour devoted by him to develop the idea he had conceived and hence the now-
lost preliminary sketches. The annexures A and B are admittedly of a much
later origin. But the settled law is that "[w]_hat is protected is the skill
and labour devoted to making the "artistic work" not the skill and labour
devoted to developing some idea or invention communicated or depicted by the
artistic work_." (see **_Catnic Components Limited And Another v Hill & Smith
Limited_** [1982] RPC 183 (CA) at page 223, approved in **_Interlego AG v Tyco
Industries Inc & Others_** [1989] 1 AC 217). I must also add that the simpler
and more commonplace the copyright drawing (which is the situation in the
present case) the more closely must the alleged infringer adhere to it in
order for liability to exist (see **_Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall and
Another_** (1990) 18 IPR 481).

128 Returning specifically to the case at hand, I had the benefit of the
comparison chart produced by defendants counsel (DB-677 to 678 including the
continuation statement). In my view besides the differences as to dimensions,
not all the features which appear in the plaintiffs product can be found in
the defendants design. Besides, looking at the products from the standpoint of
details, I am also in agreement with defendants counsel that the design
alluded to by the plaintiffs has been demonstrably elementary and this aspect,
insofar as the fourth plaintiffs designs are concerned, it had been conceded,
albeit rather gingerly, by Vanderstukken (page 179 of the NE) that they were
elementary. The addition of the much-talked about armour cladding by Loke too
does not take their case any further as it is not claimed that that feature
forms part of the infringement. In my determination, annexures A and B
illustrate nothing but a non-proprietary principle or method of constructing
the fire-rated glass doors and structural frames. I agree in this regard with
the testimonial assertions by the defendants, that the method referred to
involves the commonplace mounting of fire-resistant glass on a hollow steel
section between fireproof calcium silicate boards. The steel section and
calcium silicate boards are then joined to form a structural frame. The gap
between the fire resistant glass and the calcium silicate board is filled
using fireproof materials. I must further mention that I accept as valid the
opinion of Associate Professor Chew that the framing system alluded to
illustrate the simplest and most fundamental method of constructing a fire-
rated glass door from an engineering point of view. I also accept as valid, Mr
Kettles view that technically similar basic designs have been in existence for
sometime and have been previously tested by others in conjunction with other
proprietary types of insulating glass. One other observation which requires
inclusion here is that any likeness or close resemblance between the
plaintiffs and the defendants drawings is mainly owing to the function and
functionality of the method which I accept as elementary.

129 Additionally, Lokes assertion in the brochures that his designs had been
patented does not set him in good light. His bombast is admittedly untrue and
has in a manner exposed him to the attendant consequences for possible breach
of s 100 of the Patent Act. Be that as it may, his action herein is plainly an
attempt at stymying competition in the market and in this the plaintiffs had
patently roped in the third plaintiffs late in the show to destabilise the
defendants. As I observed earlier the third plaintiffs claim for copyright
seems to implode under its own inconsistency. Having maintained that the third
plaintiffs had allowed the first and second plaintiffs to make use of their
drawings to develop the latters design, the third plaintiffs in my view have
little legal basis to maintain a claim against the defendants when the first
and the second plaintiffs themselves reiterate that it is their copyright in
their work which has been infringed. Conversely, as stated in Copinger (paras
8-69, 13th Edn) that: if the plaintiffs drawing is based partly upon an
earlier drawing and all that the defendant has appropriated is the work of the
earlier draughtsman, there will be no infringement of the drawing in which the
plaintiff claims copyright.

130 As observed by me earlier, what the first defendant had done here is that
he had developed his design as submitted by the defendants counsel having
regard to a common method known in the fire-rated glass industry over a long
period of time. No doubt, he had the benefit of working for the first and the
second plaintiffs earlier. But judicial process cannot be enlisted to stymy
skilled workmen from carrying in their cerebra, the skills they had learnt in
the course of their employment for use later for their advancement. Of course
if the matter complained of is a method, process or a design subject to
protection by patent or by design registration, different considerations will
apply. However, in the absence of any patent or design rights, the present
attempts by the plaintiffs to monopolise an elementary and non-proprietary
principle cannot, in my view, be supported by the court.

131 In the premises the first issue is to be answered in favour of the
defendants; and that none of the defendants has infringed the copyright either
of the first and the second plaintiffs or of the third plaintiffs.

Issue No 2

_**

Whether the defendants have established the non-expert defence provided under
section 69 of the Copyright Act.

132 Section 69 of the Act provides, inter alia, as follows:

> 69\. For the purposes of this Act
>

>> (a) the making of an object of any kind that is in 3 dimensions does not
infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 2 dimensions; and

>>

>> (b) the making of an object of any kind that is in 2 dimensions does not
infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 3 dimensions,

>
> if the object would not appear to persons who are not experts in relation to
> objects of that kind to be a reproduction of the artistic work.

The defence under this section only arises after the plaintiffs have
established that there has been what would otherwise be an infringement.

133 The foregoing provisions require no paraphrasing. As respects copyright
infringement in different dimensions, the said section provides for a defence
popularly known as non-experts defence and it owes its origin to s 9(8) of the
UK Copyright Act of 1956, enacted following a recommendation by the Gregory
Committee on Copyright (Cmnd 8662) that functional designs should receive no
greater protection under copyright law than that which they were entitled to
receive as a registered design (see _George Wei_ at pp 173-174, para 7.30).

134 How the court should approach this non-experts defence is enunciated by
the House of Lords in **_LB (Plastics) Ltd v Swish Products Ltd_** [1979] FSR
145, where Lord Wilberforce reiterates at p 152:

> The [defence] applies by way, and only by way of defence, ie after the issue
> of copying has been decided, and on the assumption that it has been decided
> in favour of the plaintiff. It is for the defendant to make it good. In
> relation to the subject matter, it was, as both sides seem to have accepted,
> for the judge, placing himself in his position of a non-expert to decide
> whether the respondents components appeared, or rather did not appear, to be
> reproductions of the appellants drawings. For this purpose he must be
> entitled to compare the objects with the drawing, and, in my opinion, to
> take account of any written matter on the drawing. In performing this task
> the judge must also be credited with some ability to interpret design
> drawings But the comparison to be made is, as I understand it, a visual
> comparison. The (non-expert) judge should not repeat the process which, as
> judge with the assistance of expert and other witnesses, he has gone through
> in deciding whether there has been copying or not.

135 I have already concluded that there is no infringement on the part of the
defendants against the plaintiffs copyrights. Nonetheless, for the sake of
completeness, I should state my ancillary findings which are as follows.

136 In my opinion, even if there had been a copyright infringement, which is
not the situation here, the statutory defence as envisaged under s 69 of the
Act is clearly available to the defendants.

137 The test to be applied in this connection is spelt out in Copinger (13th
Edn, para 8-71). The authors say that although it may be more convenient to
compare the defendants three-dimensional object with the plaintiffs three-
dimensional object made from the plaintiffs original three-dimensional work,
strictly the first should be compared with the last and it is the plaintiffs
drawing taken as a whole which should be studied.

138 In the premises as submitted by defendants counsel one is required to look
at the defendants final product, that is, the fully assembled door. When
examined this way from the specimens submitted, I agree with the defendants
submission that all one could see is the capping outside. No one will be able
to see the steel frame, the calcium silicate boards or even the so-called
armour capping. On this basis the court as the notional non-expert is unable
to conclude that there has been copying of the original design drawing which
the plaintiffs say is evidenced in annexures A and B.

139 In the premises, issue number 2 is answered in favour of the defendants.

**_

Issue Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6

_**

3 _Whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently particularised their claim of
breach of confidence in relation to the design of their framing system as
illustrated in their shop drawings. [The Plaintiffs in their closing
submissions abandoned the claims based on the cladding and the method of
laying the door straps.]_

4 _Whether the information contained in the shop drawings were of a
confidential nature._

5 Whether the Defendants received the shop drawings in circumstances imparting
an obligation of confidence.

6 Whether there was unauthorised use of the Plaintiffs confidential
information.

140 In this regard, a preliminary point is being raised by defendants counsel.
He contends that the plaintiffs claims on this head should have been pleaded
in detail but this has not been done in the present case and in the
circumstances, such a failure is fatal to the plaintiffs claim. Reliance is
placed on the case of **_Chiarapurk Jack & Ors v Haw Par Brothers
International Ltd & Anor_** [1993] 3 SLR 285.

141 As regards the first defendant (the allegation against the second
defendant has already been withdrawn), the averments as to the alleged
confidential information disclosed to him as pleaded in para 22 of the claim
is rather scanty and somewhat skeletal. The purported particulars bespeak: (a)
handing over to him the plaintiffs shop drawings and specifications in
relation to a project; (b) explaining to the first defendant the mode of
installing the fire-rated glass doors and (c) explaining to him how to affix
the door straps. The plaintiffs claim that these communications are
confidential and that the first defendant had breached his duty which the
plaintiffs label as "fiduciary".

142 The correct test to be applied in dealing with claims founded on breach of
confidence is pithily stated by Laddie J in **_CMI-Centers For Medical
Innovation GMBH And Anor v Phytopharm PLC_** [1999] FSR 235. He said

> For a plaintiff to succeed in a breach of confidence action he had to
> address at least four matters: (i) he had to identify clearly what was the
> information he was relying on; (ii) he had to show that it was handed over
> in circumstances of confidence; (iii) he had to show that it was information
> of the type which could be treated as confidential; and (iv) he had to show
> that it was used without his licence or there was a threat to use it.

143 I am of the view that the purported particulars provided under paras 22 of
the statement of claim against the first defendant are regrettably inadequate
and worse still what is alleged there does not, in my view, establish that it
is information of the type which could be regarded as confidential. Showing
workmen and contractors how to install doors and affix the straps in
accordance with the plans can in no way be characterized as imparting aspects
of confidential information. Secondly, the information relating to the
affixing of door straps directly to the steel frame which is in the
manufacturers recommended method of fixture as can be seen from the catalogues
and instruction materials produced, was abandoned by the plaintiffs halfway
through the proceedings. Next, the method joining the external cladding so as
to give a clean or polished edge is again simple metal working theory which,
in my determination, can be satisfactorily completed by any journeyman metal
worker. This aspect also does not qualify as information of a confidential
nature.

144 In my determination as concerns the first defendant (the second defendant
is no longer in the suit) the so-called instructions or explanations given to
him as to how to instal doors and affix straps cannot amount to imparting
confidential information. At any rate, the first defendant was admittedly
engaged for his experience in fitting and installing aluminium and steel-
framed doors albeit his lack of experience in fitting fire-rated doors. In the
result, showing him the components and how they are to be installed is out of
pure necessity to have the work done in an efficient manner. In my finding,
the claim based on breach of confidence is a late addition and one of
reflection than substance. Here I accept the first defendants evidence that he
was neither cautioned nor told that there was any secret or confidential
process involved in such installation work.

145 In my opinion, insofar as the first defendant is concerned there is no
acceptable evidence to warrant a conclusion that he was bound by a
relationship of confidence with the plaintiffs. On the facts, the information
alluded to lacks the requisite quality of confidentiality; neither does it
possess the characteristic akin to a trade secret.

146 In the premises I find that the issues raised under the heading breach of
confidence are to be answered as follows: (a) the plaintiffs have not
sufficiently particularised their claim based on breach of confidence; (b) the
information contained in the shop drawings, even if they were handed to the
first defendant, which is denied, are not of a confidential nature except in
its generic sense; (c) the first defendant received those drawings not in
circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and (d) there is no
evidence of any unauthorised use of the plaintiffs' material by him to anyone
so to speak.

147 I must add that a worker or contractor employed cannot in the absence of a
specific contractual restraint be made to be denuded of any knowledge gained,
expertise acquired or novelty learnt in the course of work undertaken by him
in the course of his employment. To prevent him from using his experience in
subsequent ventures, employment or enterprises is contrary to reason, fairplay
and public policy.

Fourth defendant

_**

148 As regards the fourth defendant who was in the first and second plaintiffs
employ for less than two years, his purported duties according to Loke was
merely to deliver technical/shop drawings to sub-contractors, contractual
architects, to ensure proper workmanship and to liaise with KDM Metals.

149 The first and second plaintiffs complain that to their dismay the fourth
defendant who was entrusted in confidence with designs and detailed
specifications in relation to the fire-rated doors and screens started
assisting his current employers, ie, the third defendants in approaching the
first plaintiffs customers to promote and sell fire-rated doors and screen
systems similar to that of the first plaintiffs. As a result, they contend
that the fourth defendant is not only in breach of his duty to his former
employers but also is said to have infringed the plaintiffs copyright (see
paras 125 and 126 of Lokes affidavit of evidence-in-chief).

150 In my view, the plaintiffs claim against the fourth defendant is
altogether hopeless. Their claim, if read objectively, seems to convey the
impression that the fourth defendant should not have joined the third
defendants and should not have marketed products similar to that of the first
and the second plaintiffs especially when the fourth defendant whilst in the
employ of the first plaintiffs happened to be dealing with the first
plaintiffs designs and specifications. There is no averment however, that
there has been any contractual restraint between the fourth and the first
plaintiffs. In my determination, merely because the fourth defendant left the
plaintiffs employ and later started working for the third defendants who are
currently marketing systems similar to that of the first and the second
plaintiffs, it does not even remotely justify the plaintiffs bringing this
action against the fourth defendant for breach of confidence, breach of
fiduciary duty and worse still infringement of copyright. Another irony in
this case is that the first and the second plaintiffs had to embarassingly
back-pedal on their allegations that the fourth defendant attempted to obtain
the plaintiffs drawings from Goh. In my evaluation, the fourth defendants
evidence that he had not seen annexures A and B whilst he was in the
plaintiffs employment, appears to have a ring of authenticity. It is
appropriate at this stage to observe that whereas the annexure A to the
statement of claim has a month and year stamp: "November 1997", it is not in
dispute that the fourth defendant had already left the plaintiffs employ
sometime in June 1994. In any event, in my finding, whatever designs handed to
him during the period of his employment with the plaintiffs were merely for
the purposes of delivery to sub-contractors, architects and for the purposes
of ensuring proper workmanship and that there was no satisfactory evidence
placed before me to conclude that the so-called designs were handed to him in
circumstances of confidence nor could those be treated as confidential.

151 In my opinion, the plaintiffs case against the fourth as well as the other
defendants based on breach of confidence and or duty is wholly unmeritorious
and in my view intended to thwart legitimate competition. The claims under
this head against all the defendants consequently fail.

**_

Issue Nos 7 and 8

_**

7 _Whether the first plaintiffs agreement ought to underwrite the 7hird
plaintiffs costs of the action amounts to unlawful maintenance?_

8 _If the above agreement amounts to unlawful maintenance, should the court
penalise the first plaintiffs by way of costs._

152 In this context, my observations and comments as appear in paras 118 to
120 and 129 of these grounds are relevant and apply here. In my opinion, the
agreement between the first and the third plaintiffs whereby the first and the
second plaintiffs are underwriting the costs of the third plaintiffs is
unwholesome and almost borders on an abuse of legal process. Although counsel
for the defendant characterizes this arrangement as amounting to maintenance,
I am of the view this does not, within the guidelines provided in **_Giles v
Thomson_** [1994] 1 AC 142, amount to a wanton and officious meddling by a
third party without justification, since the fourth plaintiffs appear to have
a peripheral, albeit questionable interest in the subject matter of the claim.
Although I am of the view the third plaintiffs late entry into this action
would appear to have been contrived by the first and the second plaintiffs in
order to exert pressure on the first and the third defendants and brow-beat
them, all the facts considered, I am disinclined to penalise the first
plaintiffs by awarding costs against them on an indemnity basis for their role
in this saga, as is being suggested by the defendants counsel.

153 In the premises, issues 7 and 8 are to be answered in the negative.

**_

Conclusion

_**

154 For the reasons I have stated, the claims of the first, second and the
third plaintiffs based on copyright infringement as well as the first and
second plaintiffs claims based on breach of confidence against the respective
defendants fail and are hereby dismissed with costs.

_

Order accordingly.
