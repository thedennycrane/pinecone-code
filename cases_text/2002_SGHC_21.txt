**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The plaintiff and the defendant are both in the construction industry. In
1998, the defendant obtained a sub-contract in respect of part of the work for
a project relating to the construction of a depot for the Singapore Mass Rapid
Transit System North East line (‘the project’). The project involved the
erection of a large number of concrete beams and columns over a large area. In
September 1998, the parties entered into a contract whereby the plaintiff
agreed to sell and the defendant agreed to purchase the plaintiff’s formwork
system for use in the construction of the project.

2\. In July 2001, the plaintiff filed this action pursuant to which it claimed
from the defendant the following:

> (a) the sum of $1,032,987 in respect of the outstanding purchase price of
> formwork supplied;
>
> (b) $339,460.19 as compensation for formwork which had not been returned;
>
> (c) $270,741.68 as compensation for damaged formwork; and
>
> (d) $895,700.77 as the cost of additional material supplied.

In due course, the defendant filed a defence and counterclaim whereunder it
claimed the sum of $308,116.26 in respect of what it considered to be
overpayment to the plaintiff as well as costs which it incurred by reason of
the plaintiff’s breach of contract.

3\. The plaintiff subsequently filed an application for summary judgment. The
defendant resisted this application successfully and was given unconditional
leave to defend. The plaintiff appealed. I heard the appeal and allowed it, in
part. I ordered that the plaintiff be entitled to enter interlocutory judgment
in respect of the formwork which had not been returned by the defendant.
Damages for this loss were to be assessed. The defendant has appealed.

The contract

**

4\. The contract was not the normal contract for sale of goods. Although it
started by stating that the plaintiff had agreed to sell and the defendant had
agreed to buy what was described as the ‘THYSSEN HUNNEBECK FORMWORK SYSTEM for
Refurbished KST Table Form and Refurbished Manto Column Form’, and set out the
lump sum price payable for the same (S$3,000,000 plus GST) it then contained a
buy back guarantee. This read as follows:

> ‘1.2 BUY BACK PRICE
>

>> The Buyer [the defendant] guarantees to sell-back and the Seller [the
plaintiff] agrees to buy-back 40% of all standard sale equipment from the
Buyer as follows:

>>

>> Lump Sum Sales Price | S$3,000,000.00  
>> ---|---  
>> Less Plywood Sales Price | S$ 300,000.00  
>> |   
>> Value of Standard Equipment | S$2,700,000.00  
>> Value of Buy-Back @40% | _S$1,080,000.00_  
>> |   
>> Value of Equipment after buy back  | S$1,620,000.00  
>> Add in Plywood  | S$ 300,000.00  
>> |   
>> Buyer pays | S$1,920,000.00  
>>  
>> *This Buy-back Price will be subject to variation due to lost or damaged
equipment. The Seller will be entitled to compensation for the cost of lost
equipment as per Appendix B, C, & D (refer to Buy-Back Terms & Conditions
Appendix A).’

It should also be noted that under clause 6, payment for the formwork had to
be made upon delivery of the same and that the amount of the payment was the
net value after deduction of the buy-back price. Thus, in the first instance,
the plaintiff would receive only the ultimate price of $1,920,000 and not the
original lump sum price of $3,000,000.

5\. Under clause 2 of the contract, the parties agreed on the area of formwork
to be delivered in respect of each type to be supplied. The plaintiff also
agreed under clause 2.3 to supply the defendant with additional formwork on
loan without rental charges in the event that acceleration of the project was
required provided that the defendant gave the plaintiff four weeks advance
written notice. It was specifically provided that if loan equipment was lost,
the plaintiff would be compensated for the lost of the equipment in the manner
set out in Appendices B, C and D of the contract.

6\. There were also clauses in the contract relating to the fabrication of the
formwork. Under clause 3 the plaintiff was obliged to provide the defendant
with all necessary shop drawings for the first application of the materials
related to the system formwork. It had also to provide two site supervisors at
the project site for a period of six months for the purpose of assembly,
erection and operation of the system formwork. Under clause 9 it was specified
that the defendant was to provide adequate labourers/site personnel who were
to liase closely with the plaintiff’s site supervisor during the fabrication,
erection and dismantling of the formwork on site.

**

  
Parties’ contentions

**

7\. In the first affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff in support of its
order 14 application, its general manager, Mr Prins, dealt briefly with the
claim for lost formwork. He pointed out that under clause 1.2 of the contract,
the plaintiff was entitled to compensation for the cost of lost formwork as
set out in the Appendices to the contract. He went on to assert that the
plaintiff was entitled to compensation of $339,460.19 (inclusive of GST) for
the cost of lost formwork and referred to a schedule annexed to his affidavit.
This schedule was a document prepared by the plaintiff which contained very
brief details of the type of formwork lost together with the cost of the same.
Nine types of formwork were specified but there were no details of the number
of individual pieces lost nor the total area of the lost pieces.

8\. In 22 and 23 of its defence and counterclaim, the defendant had asserted
that under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was obliged to fabricate
the formwork and/or supply the formwork in pre-assembled form ready for use by
the defendant. In breach of such obligation, the plaintiff failed to fabricate
the formwork and/or supply it in pre-assembled form. Due to the plaintiff’s
said breach of contract, many of the materials and items supplied had to be
cut and consumed in the fabrication and assembly undertaken by the defendant.
Accordingly, the quantities of the materials returned could not tally with the
quantities supplied. The defendant asserted that the non-return of formwork
was therefore due to the plaintiff’s own breach of contract and the
plaintiff’s claim was not maintainable. This assertion was reiterated in the
affidavit filed by Mr Teo Hock Chwee, the defendant’s managing director, in
the order 14 proceedings.

9\. Mr Prins replied to Mr Teo’s affidavit. He disputed the assertion that the
plaintiff had any obligation to fabricate the formwork and/or supply it in
pre-assembled form as alleged. He said that it was not possible to pre-
assemble the formwork and then take it to the construction site because of the
sheer size of the formwork. There was, in fact, a designated area within the
construction site for fabrication of the formwork. Mr Prins pointed out that
under clause 3 of the contract, the plaintiff’s obligation was to provide two
site supervisors to supervise the assembly, erection and operation of the
formwork on site. He also said that although the plaintiff gave the defendant
a quotation of $2,100,000 (sale price less buy-back price) for the supply of
formwork, the defendant had itself given a much higher quotation for formwork
to the main contractor. The amount quoted by the defendant was $8,851,229. Mr
Prins claimed that the higher quotation showed that the defendant knew full
well from the onset that it was the defendant’s obligation to fabricate the
formwork.

10\. In a further affidavit, Mr Prins elaborated on his assertion that it was
impossible to pre-assemble the formwork. He stated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of
his third affidavit that:

> ‘9. … Due to the height of the tables required, the KST Table Form used on
> this project was of the fixed leg type (as opposed to folding leg type). The
> pre-assembled KST Table Forms are several storeys high, as can be seen from
> the photographs annexed hereto and exhibited as ‘**MFP-17** ’. It would not
> be possible to transport these to the construction site and the formwork has
> to be pre-fabricated on site in the configuration required, which would
> normally consist of six (6) legs along with KST heads and a flat table fixed
> to the top.
>
> 10\. For the record, it should be noted that in many formwork systems such
> as the plaintiff’s Manto column forms, the moulds for the concrete are
> assembled before each separate casting. The speciality of the plaintiff’s
> KST Table Form System is that the table is pre-assembled out of a mixture of
> steel and timber components to form the finished table shape. These pre-
> assembled tables are then joined together to form the support of the slab
> table to be cast. After casting of the concrete slab, the tables are then
> separated and moved to the next casting area, and they are continuously used
> in their pre-assembled form.’

Reasons

**

11\. I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant had no ground on
which to assert that the plaintiff had to pre-assemble the formwork before
delivering it to the site. The photographs annexed to Mr Prins’ affidavit
showed the massive nature of the formwork once assembled. The parties could
not have contemplated any pre-assembly of this formwork. The plaintiff’s
obligation was to supply the components of its formwork system and the
defendant then had to assemble these components into the structures required
for the construction of the project. That this was so was made quite clear by
the contract which obliged the defendant to provide sufficient labour for the
assembly and also required the plaintiff to have two supervisors on site for a
period of six months. If the assembly was to take place prior to delivery
there would have been no need for the plaintiff’s supervisors to go to the
site at all let alone for such a long period.

12\. It was also provided in the contract that the defendant was to be
responsible for the maintenance of the equipment during the construction
period and to keep it in good working condition. On completion of the project,
the defendant was responsible for the dismantling and rounding up of all the
parts and bringing them back to street level. These provisions of the contract
were also contrary to the defendant’s submission about pre-assembly. If the
defendant had nothing to do with the assembly of the formwork and it could be
delivered in pre-assembled condition, it did not need to have any
responsibility for dismantling since such pre-assembled formwork could also be
redelivered in the same condition.

13\. The defendant had admitted that it had, in putting pieces of the formwork
together for the purposes of the project, cut and consumed parts of the
formwork in this fabrication and assembly work. It had further admitted that
accordingly the quantities of the materials returned could not tally with the
quantities supplied. The defendant was the purchaser of the formwork. If it
wanted to rely on the resale provisions in the contract, it had to be able to
redeliver what it had purchased originally. It could not do so. It was
contemplated in the contract that it might not be able to do so and the
defendant agreed that in that event it would pay for those parts of the
formwork that it could not redeliver.

14\. In my opinion, the defendant had no defence in principle to the
plaintiff’s claim for the cost of formwork that was not redelivered and thus
resold to the plaintiff. The only reason why I gave interlocutory judgment to
the plaintiff was that the plaintiff had not sufficiently proved the
calculation of its loss at $339,460.19. I considered that it should at an
assessment hearing produce the delivery orders and the redelivery orders
respectively and then quantify the number and type of pieces of formwork which
had not been redelivered so that the court and the parties could calculate the
amount due in respect of each of the lost pieces. The defendant would then
also have the opportunity of challenging the plaintiff’s calculations and/or
documents to show that more pieces had been returned than the plaintiff had
given credit for.
