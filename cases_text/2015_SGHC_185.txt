Chan Seng Onn J:

1 The plaintiff, Mr See Kian Teck (“Mr See”), claims cumulatively (i) a 50 per
cent share of the profits arising from the construction project entitled the
“Re-roofing Works to Existing Clubhouse At Sime Road for the Singapore Island
Country Club” (“the Project”) and certain works performed in relation to the
Skylights at the golfing office of the Singapore Island Country Club (“SICC”)
(“Skylights works”); and (ii) the costs he incurred in relation to the Project
less the amount of $680,000 already paid to him by the defendant, SG-Bogen Pte
Ltd. He mounts his claim based on an oral joint venture agreement (“Oral JVA”)
between himself and the defendant.

2 Looking at the pleaded cases and submissions of both parties and the
evidence of Mr Pui Cheng Giap who was instrumental in connecting the parties,
I find that the terms of the Oral JVA broadly track those contained in the
unsigned draft joint venture agreement that was prepared for the parties. As
such, I am of the view that the terms of the Oral JVA contemplate that the
parties share the profits of the Project equally after recovering the expenses
they have incurred respectively in relation to the same. I note that the
defendant has sought to assert, relying on a letter allegedly sent by it on 4
May 2007 (“4 May 2007 letter”), certain additional terms in the Oral JVA
regarding (i) the plaintiff’s role as Project Director during the defects
liability period and (ii) the plaintiff’s personal obligation to provide the
site team or management at his own cost. The plaintiff denies having received
the 4 May 2007 letter. After considering, _inter alia_ , the evidence of Mr
Lee Choon Sing (“Mr Lee”), Mr See and Mr Pui, I find that the 4 May 2007
letter was not sent and these alleged terms did not form part of the Oral JVA.
My findings here have implications on the defendant’s counterclaim, which I
will deal with below.

3 Turning to the plaintiff’s claim for the breach of the Oral JVA, I note that
the final contract sum of the Project that has been paid to the defendant
stands at $1,738,071.54. In order to satisfy the legal burden in relation to
his claim, the plaintiff has produced invoices and vouchers in relation to the
various payments he has made to subcontractors. I also note that a number of
subcontractors and the Project Engineer of the Project have given evidence at
the trial for the plaintiff on having received payments from the plaintiff. It
is also uncontroversial that the relevant works had been done by the
subcontractors in relation to the Project. Therefore, with the exception of
the works done in relation to the Timber Ceiling (“Timber Ceiling works”),
which has been a point of dispute in this action, the plaintiff has
established a _prima facie_ case that the payments as set out in the invoices,
vouchers and affidavit evidence of the subcontractors had been made by him to
the subcontractors. In any case, I note that the defendant did not dispute the
authenticity of the invoices and vouchers adduced by the plaintiff within the
window provided to it under O 27 rr 4(1)-(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
R5, Rev Ed 2014).

4 I now turn to the payment invoice in relation to the Timber Ceiling works.
At the trial, the defendant called Mr Ong Guan Kiat (“Mr Ong”), the sole
proprietor of Do Renovation Contractor, as its witness to testify that Do
Renovation Contractor, the subcontractor who purportedly issued the invoice in
relation to the Timber Ceiling works, did not perform the said works. To that
end, Mr Ong gave evidence that the plaintiff had asked him to provide his
letterhead for the preparation of an invoice for the Timber Ceiling works and
produced in Court an audio recording of a conversation between himself and the
plaintiff that suggested that Mr Ong had not performed the Timber Ceiling
works and the plaintiff was coercing Mr Ong to give favourable evidence in
Court. Notwithstanding the fact that the aforementioned audio recording was
only a portion of the entire conversation between the plaintiff and Mr Ong, I
am of the view that the defendant has adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy
me that the Timber Ceiling works were not performed by Do Renovation
Contractor.

5 Be that as it may, it is clear from the evidence of Mr Thng Kim Hock, a
former senior maintenance executive of the SICC that the Timber Ceiling works
(and all the works in relation to the Project) have been fully
completed.[note: 1] Therefore, while the plaintiff will not be able to claim
the amount set out in the invoice by Do Renovation Contractor in the absence
of proof as to its authenticity, he would still be able to claim the value of
the Timber Ceiling works. In this regard, I note that one “Choon Sian Wei” had
apparently received $190,000 for the Timber Ceiling works. A bill record
showing the record of this payment was adduced as an exhibit in Court during
the trial.[note: 2] Having regard to the value of the Timber, I am of the view
that $190,000 would fairly represent the value of the payments made by the
plaintiff in relation to the Timber Ceiling works. I therefore allow the
plaintiff to recover this amount as expenses incurred in relation to the
Timber Ceiling works (see _Annex A: plaintiff’s expenses_ for the computation
of the plaintiff’s expenses).

6 Having analysed the expenses of the defendant, I find that the defendant had
established through affidavit evidence, invoices and vouchers that it had
incurred $483,369.34 as expenses in relation to the Project (see _Annex B:
defendant’s expenses_ for the computation of the defendant’s expenses). The
plaintiff accepted that most of these expenses were incurred in relation to
the Project. I have disallowed a claim by the defendant for certain worker
expenses that were not proved to be linked to the Project. I have also
disallowed the expenses arising from the provision of a vehicle for Mr Chua
Yuen Shen (“Mr Chua”) and a 10 year warranty, as the defendant has not been
able to substantiate with evidence what exactly these expenses entailed. I
note that the plaintiff has suggested that the defendant’s claim for purchase
of Timber from Huang Huat Timber Trading Pte Ltd (“Huang Huat”) should not be
allowed as the defendant has not been able correlate the invoices from Huang
Huat with its claim. The invoices from Huang Huat for both plywood and Timber
purchased by the defendant in relation to the Project cumulatively amount to
$104,365.62 (see computation in _Annex C_ : _Huang Huat invoices_). I allow
the defendant to claim the whole amount as it is clear on the face of the
invoices that the Timber and plywood were delivered to the site of the Project
during the period when the Project was in progress. I highlight, for
completeness, that there is no double-counting of the defendant’s expenses for
plywood in relation to the “Temporary Hoarding and Lighting”.

7 As regards the Skylight works for the golfing office of the SICC, I find
that these works are also covered by the profit sharing arrangement under the
Oral JVA. Given that the Skylight works were done in SICC on the instruction
of one Ms Vivian Heng of RSP Architects, who were the architects and civil and
structural engineers of the Project, with the same team of workers onsite for
the Project,[note: 3] on a balance, the Skylight works were part of the
Project. In any case, I note that the letter from the defendant’s solicitors
dated 11 March 2013 did not exclude the Skylight works as part of the
Project.[note: 4]

8 I now turn to the defendant’s counterclaim. I have already found that the
two terms alleged by the defendant regarding (i) the plaintiff’s role as
Project Director during the defects liability period; and (ii) the plaintiff’s
personal obligation to provide the site team or management at his own cost are
not part of the Oral JVA. This would substantially defeat the defendant’s
counterclaim. The plaintiff therefore has no personal obligation to pay the
“Salary of Project manager +1” counterclaimed by the defendant. The plaintiff
is also not personally liable for the “failure [to] perform during defect
period” as he was not obliged to so perform under the Oral JVA. I have
nevertheless allowed the defendant to recover part of the salary paid to Mr
Chua during the Defect Liability Period as expenses incurred in relation to
the Project. The defendant is also unsuccessful on the last limb of his
counterclaim relating to the “loss of administration fee”. Apart from the fact
that the defendant did not lead any cogent evidence in relation to this part
of its counterclaim (_ie_ “loss of administration fee”), I find that the
extension of the Defect Liability Period resulting from the delays in
rectifying defects were caused by Mr Chua’s non-responsiveness as evinced from
the email correspondences adduced in evidence.[note: 5]

9 In sum, the plaintiff succeeds in his claim against the defendant for unpaid
sums in breach of the Oral JVA. Taking into account the $680,000 already paid
to the plaintiff, the defendant is to pay the plaintiff $357,700.50 (see
_Annex D: computation of award_). I award the plaintiff interest on the sum of
$357,700.50 at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of service of the
writ to the date of judgment. The defendant’s counterclaims are dismissed. I
will hear the parties on costs.

34 |  Tender expense |  $2,004.00 |  Accepted by plaintiff

I find that there is a close enough nexus with the Project for this to be a Project expense.
