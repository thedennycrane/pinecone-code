18 April 2019 Judgment reserved.  

Woo Bih Li J:

Introduction

1 The background to this action is set out in my judgment dated 2 January 2019
in Seraya Energy Pte Ltd v Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another suit (YTL
PowerSeraya Pte Ltd, third party) [2019] SGHC 02 (“the 1st Judgment”).
Subsequent to that, I determined the extent of the liability and quantum in a
supplementary judgment dated 29 January 2019 in Seraya Energy Pte Ltd v Denka
Advantech Pte Ltd and another suit (YTL PowerSeraya Pte Ltd, third party)
[2019] SGHC 18 (“the 2nd Judgment”).

2 Thereafter, I heard the parties on costs and disbursements of the action. I
will use the same definitions as in the 1st Judgment.

The Offer to Settle

3 It transpired that on 31 October 2016, Denka had made an offer to settle
(“the OTS”) SE’s claims. The offer remained open for five months and was
withdrawn on 31 March 2017. The first day of the trial was 7 November 2017,
more than seven months after the OTS was withdrawn.

4 Under O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)
(“ROC”), a defendant who has made an offer to settle, which is not withdrawn
and has not expired before the disposal of the claim, is entitled to costs on
an indemnity basis from the date of service of the offer if the plaintiff does
not accept the offer and the plaintiff obtains judgment which is not more
favourable than the terms of the offer. In that scenario, the plaintiff is
entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served. This
provision is subject to any order which the court may otherwise make.

5 On the other hand, under O 22A r 9(5), where an offer to settle has been
made and notwithstanding anything in the offer, the court has full power to
determine by whom and to what extent any costs are to be paid. This provision
is without prejudice to various provisions including O 22A r 9(3).

6 As the OTS was withdrawn and was not kept open for acceptance until the
disposal of the claim, I initially decided on 5 March 2019 that each party was
to bear its own costs of the action.

7 However, upon hearing further arguments, I am of the view that more weight
should be given to the fact that the OTS had remained open for acceptance for
five months and less weight to the fact that it was withdrawn after five
months. After all, there was no suggestion by SE that it would have accepted
the OTS had it not been withdrawn.

8 Under the 2nd Judgment (at [4]–[5]), SE was entitled to receive/retain:

(a) $1,850,000 being the aggregate sum received from three bank guarantees (on
22 December 2014); and

(b) $77,911.72 from DAPL.

9 On the other hand, SE was liable to pay DSPL $1,097.72. The nett mount which
SE was entitled to was therefore $1,926,814 (excluding interest and costs).

10 Under the OTS, SE would have been entitled to receive/retain:

(a) $1,850,000; and

(b) $ 792,450.

The total would have been $2,642,450 (excluding interest and costs).

11 The difference between the principal amounts offered under the OTS and
awarded under the 2nd Judgment was $715,636 or about 37% of the principal
amount under the 2nd Judgment. In absolute and in percentage terms, this was
not a small difference even though the maximum aggregate amount of SE’s claim
was about $31m and the total sum offered, ie, about $2.642m, was less than 10%
of the maximum claimed.

12 Accordingly, I am of the view that, in principle, Denka should be awarded
some costs.

Quantum of costs

13 Denka sought $2m as costs on an indemnity basis and $1.2m as costs on a
standard basis. Denka stressed that SE had itself sought $1.2m as costs
against Denka on a standard basis. This was based on complexity, novelty and
importance of the issues on quantum which pertained to the enforceability of
certain provisions on liquidated damages which appeared to be prevalent in
electricity retail contracts between commercial parties.

14 Using O 22A r 9(3) as a guide and considering the court’s discretion under
O 22A r 9(5) ROC, it is open to the court to award SE costs on a standard
basis up to the date the OTS was served and award costs to Denka on an
indemnity basis thereafter even though the OTS was withdrawn after five
months.

15 However, I also considered two other points. First, it was not entirely
unreasonable for SE not to accept the OTS since the total sum offered was less
than 10% of the maximum sum claimed and one could not say then that it was
obvious that SE would not succeed for the maximum sum claimed. Secondly, Denka
had lost on the issue of liability for repudiatory breach of contract. While
it is true that this issue would not even have to be considered if SE had
accepted the OTS, I place some weight on Denka’s conduct in resisting
liability for breach of contract.

16 In my view, it was obvious that Denka had reneged on its contractual
bargain in the three electricity contracts in question. Denka had sought an
accommodation from SE regarding a steam supply agreement and agreed to the
terms thereof except for some technical details which remained outstanding.
The terms of the accommodation required Denka to enter into the three
electricity contracts with SE. When the price of electricity eventually went
against Denka, it reneged on the three electricity contracts and attempted to
avoid liability, using arguments which were clearly without merit.

17 Also, as mentioned, while SE lost its claim for liquidated damages, I could
not say that its case for such a claim was clearly without merit. Likewise, I
could not say that its alternative claim for general damages of a substantial
sum which called for the court to disregard a contract for difference, was
also clearly without merit.

18 In the circumstances, I am of the view that it would be just and also
neater to simply award Denka costs on a standard basis, instead of on an
indemnity basis, from the date the OTS was served and no costs to SE from the
date the Writ was filed, ie, on 19 December 2014 to the date the OTS was
served, ie, on 31 October 2016.

19 As the Writ was filed on 19 December 2014 and the OTS was served on 31
October 2016 and the first day of trial was on 7 November 2017, I am of the
view that I should award Denka 90% of the costs of the action as most of the
getting-up costs and work for the trial would have accrued after 31 October
2016. Indeed, that was the position of both sides as well.

20 The question then is what 100% of the standard costs should be before
applying the 90% figure.

21 Under Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions which provides
costs guidelines, the daily tariff for a complex contract case is $17,000
daily but this is on a tiered basis, ie, 100% for the first five hearing days,
80% for the next five days and 60% thereafter.

22 The trial was for 12 days (and not 13 days as mentioned by one counsel).
Applying the guideline in Appendix G will result in the following costs:

(a)| $17,000 x 5 days| $ 85,000  
---|---|---  
(b)| ($17,000 x 5 days) x 80%| $ 68,000  
(c)| ($17,000 x 2 days) x 60%| $ 20,400  
| Total:| $173,400  
  
23 However, in my view the arguments on liquidated damages were complex enough
to warrant some increase from the guideline of $17,000 daily although this
rate was already the daily tariff for complex contract cases. Furthermore,
there should also be an uplift as the maximum amount of SE’s claims was for
about $31m. As already mentioned, it was not clear that the claim for this sum
was without merit, unlike some other cases where it is quite obvious that the
sum claimed is without basis. In other words, the potential liability of Denka
for this sum was quite real. Likewise, the potential gain for SE was also
quite real.

24 Taking these two factors into account, as well as the total sum awarded of
about $1.926m under the 2nd Judgment, and the estimated costs figure of $1.2m
submitted by each side, I am of the view that it would be just to increase the
costs by a factor of 2.5 ie, $173,000 x 2.5 = $432,500. 90% of that figure
would be $389,250 which I round up to $390,000.

25 I would also mention that, aside from the OTS, parties also argued as to
whether the bulk of the work done for the trial was in respect of liability or
quantum. In my view, the issue of liability was much less difficult than the
issue of quantum which included the question as to whether the applicable
provision on liquidated damages applied and, if not, what the general damages
amounted to. In any event, I have taken into account the point that SE had
resisted liability.

26 As for disbursements, I am pleased to note that parties have agreed on the
quantum thereof although this is on the basis of disbursements for the entire
duration of the action. I am of the view that Denka is entitled to
disbursements incurred from the date the OTS was served. For the avoidance of
doubt, SE is not entitled to the disbursements incurred before the date the
OTS was served.

27 In summary, I make the following orders:

(a) I set aside my earlier decision of 5 March 2019 on costs and
disbursements.

(b) SE is to pay Denka 90% of the costs of the action, on a standard basis,
from the date the OTS was served. This is fixed at $390,000.

(c) SE is to pay Denka the disbursements of the action from the date the OTS
was served. This is to be agreed or fixed by the court.

Parties are to agree on such disbursements within 14 days from the date of
this judgment, failing which Denka is to write in for an appointment to fix
the quantum of disbursements within 21 days from the date of this judgment.

(d) SE is to pay Denka $3,000, all in, for getting up and for work done for
submissions on costs and disbursements.
