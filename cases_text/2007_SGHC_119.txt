Kan Ting Chiu J:

1 Since giving my grounds in respect of CA 79 of 2007, the plaintiff has filed
another appeal, CA 80 of 2007, in respect of the orders which I made on 12
July 2007 on the plaintiff’s application SUM 2910 of 2007 filed on 6 July
2007:

2\. that the date for the filing and exchange of the Plaintiff’s reply
affidavits to the Defendant’s affidavits of evidence-in-chief be extended from
7 July 2007 to four (4) weeks from the date of the Order made herein;

2 The plaintiff had by that time filed one affidavit of evidence-in-chief by
Mr S P Slattery (“Slattery”), its Vice President of Regulatory and
Interconnect Strategy, and the defendant had filed four affidavits of
evidence-in-chief, two by its officers Mr Thomas Ee Chong Gay and Ms Rosalind
Liew Pieak Yoke and two by expert witnesses Dr Allaudeen Hameed and Dr Ivan
Png Paak-Liang.

3 In the application filed one day before the deadlines set previously, the
grounds of the application were stated as:

(a) One of the reply affidavits will be filed by Sean Patrick Slattery. Mr
Slattery was required to attend before the Indonesian business competition
regulator in Jakarta from 3 to 5 July 2007 to assist in investigations
involving the Plaintiff, and is only back in the office today. Mr Slattery has
not had the opportunity to fully review the Defendant’s affidavits of
evidence-in-chief.

(b) The Defendant has filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief affirmed by Dr
Allaudeen Hameed and Dr Ivan Png Paak-Liang. The Plaintiff is considering
appointing experts to respond to the contents of these affidavits, and this is
expected to take awhile.

4 It is noteworthy that besides alluding to the fact that the plaintiff was
“considering appointing experts”, no explanation was offered as to why it had
not appointed experts earlier, at least by the time it received the affidavits
of evidence-in-chief of the defendant’s experts in the previous week on 30
June 2007, who the possible experts might be, and why it was felt a four-week
extension was necessary when, as no experts had been appointed, the plaintiff
would not have known how long the experts would need.

5 In the circumstances, I extended the time for Slattery to file his affidavit
in reply to 14 July (and I extended it further to 18 July when the plaintiff
informed me that Slattery was on leave and was due to return to work on 16
July as he was moving out of his apartment to a new apartment).

6 However, the plaintiff did not make out a case for extending the time for
filing the replies to the defendant’s experts’ affidavits of evidence-in-
chief, and I declined to extend the deadline for this purpose.
