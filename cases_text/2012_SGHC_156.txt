Choo Han Teck J:

1 The appellants were each charged for an offence under s 8(4) of the Common
Gaming House Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) for “promoting” a game of chance called
“Red and Blue” using cash as stakes. The Statement of Facts stated that on 21
February 2012 the appellants were each “seen manning a makeshift table
promoting a game of chance styled “Red and Blue” using cash as stakes… and
encouraging by-passers to place bets at the gaming table”. The appellants were
each sentenced to two weeks jail and fined $20,000 and in default of which, 40
days imprisonment. The appellants had served the two weeks imprisonment but
now filed an appeal. In their petition of appeal they stated that they pleaded
guilty after they were told by the Bangali interpreter “that they must plead
guilty and don’t make trouble or otherwise their sentence may be higher”. The
appellants’ case was that they did not “promote gaming” and were only “curious
bystander[s]” who had placed bets. They thus prayed that their convictions be
set aside.

2 Mr Darryl Soh, the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“the DPP”) applied for the
affidavit of the said Bengali Interpreter to be admitted in evidence. The
affidavit dated 18 May 2012 was admitted without objection by Mr S K Kumar for
the appellants. The interpreter denied the allegations stated in the petition
of appeal. The DPP submitted that the appellants’ version cannot be true. A
finding of fact of this nature cannot be made without a trial, but that is
unnecessary in this instance. While I see no reason to doubt that the
interpreter had discharged his duty properly, the appellants might still have
misunderstood the interpreter.

3 The appellants were arrested on 21 February 2012 and convicted on 23
February 2012 when they pleaded guilty without counsel. They were foreign
workmen earning $480 each a month. The Notes of Evidence showed that the court
had asked the appellants if they were maintaining their stand, made in
mitigation, that they were “not the organiser[s]” but were only customers. The
court informed them that if that were the case, the pleas would be rejected.
Given the circumstances, I will accept that the interpreter had duly
interpreted the court’s comments. The appellants are not trained in the law
and were unlikely to know that a plea of guilty must be unqualified and
acceptance of the statement of facts is essential. It is possible that they
did not understand they could and should claim trial if they disputed the
statement of facts. I therefore set aside the conviction. I directed that the
case be remitted to the District Court for the plea to be re-taken.
