(delivering the judgment of the court): **_The parties_**  
  
Povl Friis (`Friis`) is a Danish businessman residing in Kuala Lumpur. He was
the first plaintiff in the action below. The second plaintiff, Combined
Overseas Transport Sdn Bhd (`Combined`), is a company owned and controlled by
him. The defendants in the action were Casetech Trading Pte Ltd (`Casetech`),
Stephen Wiffen (`Wiffen`), his wife, Stevany Wiffen (`Mrs Wiffen`) and Lars
Arne Kent Linden (`Linden`). The Wiffens reside in Singapore and are directors
of Casetech, which is in the business of dealing in cranes and construction
related equipment. Linden is a Swedish businessman, who used to reside in
Kuala Lumpur and was a former director of Casetech.  
  
**_The facts_**

****

The relevant facts giving rise to the dispute have been sufficiently set out
in the judgment below, which we respectfully adopt. Briefly they were as
follows. Friis first met Linden sometime in 1989 at the Danish club in Kuala
Lumpur, and thereafter socially from time to time. Arising from their
conversations on these occasions, Friis learnt that Linden was in the business
of supplying construction related equipment and had businesses in Malaysia and
Singapore. On one such occasion, Linden mentioned that he had a business
partner in Singapore and he had some cash flow difficulties as a result of a
project having gone wrong. Friis intimated that he might be able to offer some
financial assistance. However, nothing developed from that conversation, until
Linden wrote to Friis on 6 July 1990 outlining a proposal to Friis and
inviting him to take up a 33% share in Casetech, in return for which Friis
would provide financial assistance by arranging for the opening of letters of
credit up to a maximum limit of $1m to finance Casetech`s operations, and also
provide security for a bank overdraft to Casetech up to a limit of $100,000.
In that letter, Linden said that he was one of two partners of Casetech and
would welcome Friis as an equal partner. Linden proposed that he, his partner
and Friis should meet on 11 or 12 July 1990 for further discussions.  
  
Soon after this, Friis met Linden and Wiffen at the Lake Club in Kuala Lumpur.
He learnt from them that Casetech bought cranes and construction related
equipment for re-sale by way of `back-to-back` trade, and that it would only
purchase equipment from a seller when there was already a purchaser at hand.
They told him that this trade had been financed by way of letters of credit
arranged by a company called Cawthorne Trading Pte Ltd. Casetech`s business
was managed mainly by Wiffen in Singapore. Linden and Wiffen owned Casetech
and had an equal share of its profits after giving Cawthorne their share.
After a discussion on Friis` proposed involvement, the parties came to the
following broad agreement (`the 1990 oral agreement`):

(1) Friis would help Casetech finance its trade on a case-by-case basis by
procuring and obtaining letters of credit to be opened by the branch of
Citibank at Kuala Lumpur;

(2) In return, Friis would be entitled to one third of the profits of the
trade;

(3) The transactions financed by Friis would be back-to-back trades only, and
not the purchase of stocks or anything that would put the funds at risk;

(4) Friis would be regularly provided with a full account of all sales and
purchases of equipment made by Casetech that were financed by him; and

(5) Friis would be reimbursed all expenses incurred by him in financing the
trades.  
  
Linden also proposed at the meeting that Friis should take up one-third of the
shares in Casetech as well as a directorship in that company, but no agreement
was reached in this respect at the time. Later, Wiffen sent him a Form 45,
which is a form of consent to act as a director, for him to sign, but Friis
said that he eventually decided against this proposal.  
  
Pursuant to the 1990 oral agreement, the parties from August 1990 undertook a
series of transactions financed by Friis in the following manner. Linden would
request Friis to procure a letter of credit to be established and Friis would
instruct his bank, Citibank at Kuala Lumpur, to open the letter of credit. On
a few occasions, Friis obtained bank drafts to pay for the equipment. These
transactions were profitable and Wiffen submitted monthly reports to him.  
  
After a while, the parties found that applying for letters of credit and bank
drafts was cumbersome, and in early 1991 a variation was made to the financing
arrangement. Friis had an account with Den Danske Bank, Singapore (`DDB`) and
he obtained from them a bank guarantee for $950,000 to secure the facilities
granted to Casetech by Deutsche Bank, Singapore (`DB`). The DB facilities
included an overdraft account and facilities for letters of credit. Casetech
used the DB facilities to finance its crane trading operations. In June 1992,
Casetech obtained similar facilities from the Singapore branch of The Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (`HSBC`) in place of DB. This was
also secured by a DDB`s guarantee for $1m procured by Friis. These foregoing
facilities will be collectively referred to as `the overdraft facilities`.
These arrangements made in 1991 and 1992 were, in effect, a variation of the
1990 oral agreement. Instead of procuring a letter of credit to be opened on a
case by case basis, Friis procured a banker`s guarantee to secure the
overdraft facilities to finance the back-to-back trades of construction
related equipment. There was no other change to the terms of the 1990 oral
agreement.  
  
The arrangement appeared to work smoothly until sometime in late October or
early November 1992, when Linden called Friis and informed him that something
was amiss in Casetech`s accounts. However, Linden assured him that he would
sort it out. Later, on 30 December 1992, DDB informed Friis that HSBC had
called on the guarantee and in consequence DDB had deducted a sum of $1m from
his account with them to effect the payment.  
  
Wiffen and Linden then arranged a meeting with Friis in Kuala Lumpur on 31
December 1992 to discuss the matter. This was held at the office of the
auditors Ernst & Young. They discussed how Friis was to be repaid the $1m.
Wiffen and Linden agreed that Casetech would sell whatever equipment they had
and direct the proceeds of sale towards repayment to Friis (`the December 1992
agreement`). With this in mind, a list detailing Casetech`s assets was drawn
up, which primarily consisted of the equipment available for sale and their
estimated selling prices. It was found that the total of the estimated sale
proceeds of the equipment was close to what was needed to repay Friis. Wiffen
and Linden then apportioned the responsibility between themselves for the sale
of the individual equipment. All the designated items of equipment were to be
sold by 31 March 1993. It was also agreed that rental proceeds from those
items of the equipment then rented out would also be applied towards the
repayment to Friis. All proceeds received from sales and all rentals would be
paid into a new account in which Friis would be the sole signatory.  
  
Unfortunately, only a total sum of $97,390.30 was paid into that account in
March and April 1993 and thus received by Friis. In fact, before any money was
received, he was asked by Wiffen in January 1993 to pay out a sum of
$27,103.22, being the freight due on one item of the equipment in order to
secure its release. Friis paid this sum and thus only received a net sum of
$70,287.08 pursuant to the December 1992 agreement, leaving a balance of
$929,712.92 unpaid.  
  
Friis did not take any action until some years later. He considered that the
antagonism that had developed between Linden and Wiffen, over the events
leading to and after the December 1992 agreement, would prevent any
possibility of recovery. However, in early 1998, Linden came forward with
information that the DDB`s guarantee was called on as a result of a misuse of
the overdraft facilities. That prompted him to take action against all the
parties concerned.  
  
Friis brought the present action on 7 July 1998 and he joined his company,
Combined, as the second plaintiff. We shall hereafter refer to Friis and
Combined, where appropriate, as the plaintiffs. In the action the plaintiffs
claimed against Casetech, Wiffen, Mrs Wiffen and Linden, inter alia, the
balance sum of $929,712.92 as damages for breach of contract on the ground
that they were contractually bound to use the overdraft facilities only for
the back-to-back trade as agreed, but that they had instead used the
facilities for other types of trades resulting in the loss. Alternatively, the
plaintiffs claimed that the defendants, save for Mrs Wiffen, held the
overdraft facilities on trust and had acted in breach of trust in the use of
the facilities. Mrs Wiffen was sought to be made liable as an accessory to the
breach of trust, on the ground that she knowingly assisted the three
defendants in the breach. Accordingly, the plaintiffs sought an account from
the defendants of the use of the overdraft facilities and all profits made
from their use. Only Casetech, Wiffen and Mrs Wiffen resisted the claim;
Linden, however, did not enter an appearance and defend the claim, although
the writ was served on him. Eventually, judgment in default was entered
against him.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

Dealing first with the claim against Mrs Wiffen, the trial judge found that
there was no evidence that she was involved in any contract with the
plaintiffs. Friis did not allege that she had participated in any of the
discussions he had with Wiffen and Linden. Mrs Wiffen`s evidence was that she
was not involved in any of the dealings between Wiffen and Friis, and that she
was merely an employee of Casetech during part of the relevant period.
Accordingly, the learned judge dismissed the claim of $929,712.92 against her.  
  
Turning to the claim against Casetech the learned judge found that Wiffen`s
evidence was only a bare denial and none of the defendants had contended that
the sum of $929,712.92 was not due to the plaintiffs. On the evidence, he
found that there were clear breaches of the 1990 oral agreement (as varied in
1991 and 1992) in the use of the overdraft facilities, and that Friis had only
received $70,287.08. Accordingly, the learned judge held that the plaintiffs
were entitled to the sum of $929,712.92 as damages for breach contract and
entered judgment against Casetech for that amount.  
  
On the question whether Wiffen was personally liable to Friis for that sum,
the trial judge found that both Wiffen and Linden were parties to the 1990
oral agreement and therefore were personally liable to the plaintiffs for
damages for breach of the 1990 oral agreement. Thus, he also entered judgment
against Wiffen for that amount.  
  
The learned judge next turned to the plaintiffs` claim for an account on the
ground that Casetech, Wiffen and Linden were constructive trustees of the
funds from the overdraft facilities provided by DB and subsequently by HSBC
which were guaranteed by the bank guarantee procured by Friis. Here again he
dismissed the claim against Mrs Wiffen, as accessory to the breach of trust
alleged to have been committed by the three of them, on the ground that she
was only an employee and later a director of Casetech at the material time,
and there was nothing which supported such a claim. The learned judge found
that plaintiffs had not proved that she was a constructive trustee or that she
was an accessory to any breach of trust.  
  
The learned judge found that the arrangement made between, on the one hand,
Wiffen and Linden and, on the other, Friis was `akin to a partnership
arrangement` and he imposed a constructive trust on the funds in the DB
account and subsequently, the HSBC account. He held that both Linden and
Wiffen were trustees of the funds and were accountable to Friis for the use of
those funds. The defendants were thus liable to account for the profits made
from the improper use of the facilities. However, the plaintiffs filed the
writ on 7 July 1998, and therefore any claim for account for the period of
more than six years from that date, ie before 7 July 1992, was time-barred by
virtue of s 6(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) and their remedy of account
was limited to the funds paid out of the HSBC overdraft account from 7 July
1992 onwards. In respect of the period of limitation, the learned judge found
that there was no fraud or fraudulent concealment of any breach of trust
postponing the running of the time under s 29(1) of the Limitation Act, as the
defendants had merely mixed their own funds in the overdraft account without
any intent to defraud.  
  
Lastly, the learned judge ordered that interest be paid on the judgment sum
and any sum found due on the taking of accounts, and this interest was to run
only from the date of writ. For convenience, we shall hereafter refer to
Casetech, Linden and Wiffen as `the defendants`, where appropriate.  
  
**_The appeals_**

****

Against the decision of the learned judge two appeals were filed. Civil Appeal
203/99 was filed by the plaintiffs, and CA 204/99 was filed by Casetech,
Wiffen and Mrs Wiffen. From the respective cases filed the appellants have
appealed against numerous points dealt with by the learned judge in his
judgment, and their cases have raised a host of issues. For our purpose, the
issues which we need to decide are the following:

(a) whether Wiffen was a party to the 1990 oral agreement;

(b) whether there was a constructive trust or any trust over the funds from
the overdraft facilities;

(c) whether Mrs Wiffen was an accessory to the breach of trust which the
learned judge held that the defendants had committed;

(d) whether Mrs Wiffen should be awarded costs below;

(e) whether any part of the claim for the sum of $929,712.08 as damages for
breach of contract was time-barred; and

(f) whether interest on the judgment sum and sum found on the taking of
account should run from the date of writ as ordered by the learned judge.  
  
Our decision on these issues would resolve all the material points raised in
their respective cases.  
  
**_The 1990 oral agreement_**

****

We deal first with Wiffen`s personal liability under the 1990 oral agreement.
Counsel for Wiffen contends that the trial judge`s finding on the personal
liability of Wiffen under the 1990 oral agreement was erroneous. He complains
that the learned judge placed too much emphasis on the contradictions in
Wiffen`s testimony on whether he met Friis in Kuala Lumpur and failed to
consider that Friis` evidence was vague and plagued by memory lapses.  
  
In our view, there is absolutely no merit in Wiffen`s appeal on this issue.
The learned judge considered the evidence adduced before him at great length.
He properly tested both the evidence of Wiffen and that of Friis against other
evidence before him and entertained serious doubts on the credibility of
Wiffen`s evidence. On the other hand, he found that the evidence of Friis was
consistent with the other evidence and in particular with the documentary
evidence produced. He accepted Friis` evidence that Casetech was merely a
vehicle that Linden and Wiffen used to conduct the transactions, and that he
did not have any idea of the makeup of Casetech and therefore would not have
provided the financial assistance (which he did), if he had not had the
assurance from both Linden and Wiffen that they would be personally liable.
The learned judge rejected Wiffen`s evidence that he was not a party to the
arrangement made at the meeting at Kuala Lumpur and that he was not present at
that meeting. The learned judge arrived at the following conclusion at [para ]
19 of his judgment:

> _Taking the evidence in its entirety, and comparing the demeanour of Friis
> and of Wiffen and the consistency of their versions with the documents and
> the surrounding factual matrix, I conclude that Wiffen was at the Lake Club
> meeting in July 1990 and that the 3 of them arrived at the oral agreement as
> Friis claims. Both Wiffen and Linden were parties to the oral agreement and
> therefore personally liable to the Plaintiffs in respect of damages arising
> from their breaches of its terms._

  
  
The learned judge was amply justified in coming to this conclusion, and we
agree with him entirely. Given the fact that Wiffen was at the time Linden`s
partner, that the arrangement made was to provide finance for the operations
of Casetech in Singapore, and that Wiffen himself was in charge of such
operations, it would be surprising if he could implement the arrangement
agreed with Friis without having been involved in the negotiations with Friis
and coming to an agreement with him. We ourselves are also unable to accept
Wiffen`s evidence that he did not participate in the negotiations with Friis
at Kuala Lumpur and was not a party to the arrangement made with Friis.  
  
**_Constructive trust_**

****

We now turn to the question of constructive trust as found by the learned
judge, which is the most important issue in these appeals. It is necessary to
consider what the arrangement made between, on the one hand, Linden and Wiffen
and, on the other, Friis, was. The terms of this arrangement, namely the 1990
oral agreement, have been set out in [para ] 3 above, and there does not
appear to be any dispute with regard to such terms. The arrangement was varied
in 1991 and 1992. The learned judge made the following finding on this
arrangement at [para ] 22 of his judgment:

> _As concerns CTL and Wiffen, the facts before me are as follows. Wiffen and
> Linden had entered into an oral agreement with Friis in July 1990 wherein
> Friis would procure financing for CTL`s trades in equipment in return for
> which Friis would receive one third of the profit. Initially the financing
> was done by way of LCs and bank drafts procured by Friis. This proved
> cumbersome and in early 1991 this method was changed. On the security of a
> DDB guarantee procured by Friis, CTL obtained credit facilities in DB up to
> $950,000. In June 1992, the DB account was closed and credit facilities for
> up to $1m was obtained under CTL`s HSBC account. This was also secured by a
> DDB guarantee procured by Friis._

  
  
It is implicit that the overdraft facilities, provided by DB or later by HSBC
secured by the bank guarantee procured by Friis, were to be used solely for
the back-to-back trading of equipment as contemplated in the 1990 oral
agreement, although such a term was not expressly spelt out in the variations
made in 1991 and 1992. It was clearly a term of the 1990 oral agreement that
the transactions to be financed by Friis were to be confined to the back-to-
back trades only. It could not have been the intention of Friis, in 1991 and
1992, to provide security to finance the use of the overdraft facilities for
other purposes.  
  
The learned judge found that Casetech had used the overdraft facilities for
purposes other than financing the back-to-back transactions contemplated in
the 1990 oral agreement, and that Wiffen and Linden did not bother to keep
separate the two types of transactions. After referring to the case of
**Coulthard v Disco Mix Club Ltd & Ors** [1999] 2 All ER 457, he said at [para
] 25:

> _I do not find the**Coulthard** case to be relevant to the question of
> whether Wiffen and Linden owed the plaintiffs a fiduciary duty in this case.
> There was an arrangement in which Friis had, in effect, placed $1m of his
> money at the disposal of Wiffen and Linden in order that they may carry out
> the undertaking. It is akin to a partnership arrangement and I can see no
> reason not to impress Wiffen and Linden with a constructive trust over the
> funds in the DB account and subsequently, the HSBC account._

  
  
This is the core finding on the basis of which the learned judge held that the
funds in the overdraft accounts with DB and HSBC were impressed with
constructive trust. With respect, we are unable to agree with this finding.
Friis did not `in effect, [place] $1m of his money at the disposal of Wiffen
and Linden`. Friis merely provided security in the form of a bank guarantee to
secure the overdraft facilities provided by Casetech`s bank, which was first
DB and later HSBC. Friis himself was quite clear in his own mind of what he
had provided for Casetech, namely, a bank guarantee of $1m to secure
Casetech`s overdraft facilities. In giving evidence in the cross-examination
he said as follows:

> _
>
> Q: After all, you yourself invested $1m in Casetech based on an oral
> agreement.
>
> A: I did not invest $1m in Casetech Trading. I did not invest $1m in the
> venture, I provided a $1m guarantee.
>
> Q: You had exposed yourself to $1m liability based on an oral agreement
> alone?
>
> A: Yes.
>
> _

  
  
Thus what Friis had provided was a bank guarantee for $1m to secure the
overdraft facilities of Casetech. It is true that these overdraft facilities
were to be used solely for the purpose of back-to-back trades and not for
other transactions of Casetech. But that restriction on the use was based on
the terms of the 1990 oral agreement (as varied); it was purely contractual
and did not arise out of the creation of any trust. The funds made available
by Casetech`s bank on the overdraft facilities and utilised by Casetech,
whether for the back-to-back trading in compliance with the agreement or for
other purposes in breach of the agreement, did not belong to Friis in law or
in equity. Nor were these funds held in trust for Friis. In our opinion,
neither Linden nor Wiffen was at any time a trustee for the plaintiffs or
either of them and consequently no breach of trust was committed by either
Linden or Wiffen.  
  
Nonetheless, the question remains whether by reason of the 1990 oral
agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992, Linden and Wiffen stood in any other
fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs and in particular Friis. As we have
held, both Linden and Wiffen were in a contractual relationship with Friis:
they were both parties to the 1990 oral agreement made with Friis, as varied
in 1991 and 1992. The question is whether this contractual arrangement also
gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between, on the one hand, Linden and
Wiffen and, on the other, Friis, such that the former became fiduciaries of
the latter. We think not. The arrangement made between them was purely a
commercial financing arrangement whereby Friis would provide security for the
overdraft facilities to finance certain transactions to be carried out by
Casetech and in return would receive a share of the profits. Such an
arrangement did not give rise to a fiduciary relationship.  
  
In this respect, there is a material feature in this financing arrangement
which bears mentioning. Under the 1990 oral agreement, there was no
requirement or obligation on the part of Linden and Wiffen that any or all of
the back-to-back trades undertaken by Casetech were to be financed by the use
of the overdraft facilities. Casetech was entitled to act entirely in its own
self-interest in determining when the overdraft facilities were to be used,
and when it should use its own funds for the purpose. Casetech was certainly
at liberty, at any time, to enter into transactions, even if they were back-
to-back trades of equipment, with its own resources without the use of the
overdraft facilities, and in such case would be entitled retain the profits
from such transactions wholly for itself. It is implicit from the terms of the
agreement made with Friis that Friis would only be entitled to a one-third
share of the profits from the back-to-back transactions actually financed by
the overdraft facilities. The corollary of this is that Friis had no right to
participate in the management of the back-to-back trades or determine which
trades were to be accepted. Thus, if and when the overdraft facilities
(secured by the bank guarantee procured by Friis) were used for such trading,
then and only then would Friis be entitled to a one-third share of the
profits.  
  
Arising from the change in the arrangement made in 1991 and 1992 in the way in
which the back-to-back transactions of Casetech were to be financed, there was
no doubt greater confidence and reliance reposed by Friis in Wiffen and Linden
to effectuate the purposes of the 1990 oral agreement. Confidence and reliance
per se, however, have never been a touchstone of a trust or fiduciary
relationship in a commercial context. Otherwise, almost every contractual
relationship involving some form of confidence or reliance (unilateral or
mutual) would give rise to a fiduciary relationship between the parties
concerned.  
  
We find the Australian case of **Hospital Products Ltd v United States
Surgical Corp** [1984] 156 CLR 41 of some assistance. Briefly the facts there
were these. An American company was the manufacturer of surgical stapling
products which were made of its own design and marketed under the name of
`Auto Suture`. The company appointed a dealer to be the sole distributor of
the stapling products in Australia. After the appointment, the dealer went
about setting up the distributorship. He acquired from the company a large
quantity of demonstration products. He caused them to be sterilized and then
sold them in competition with or in substitution of the company`s products.
Later, he also manufactured his own products locally and deferred filling
orders for the company`s products but instead filled the orders with his own
products. The company instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South
Wales, claiming, inter alia, a declaration that the dealer`s assets were held
on constructive trust and other consequential orders. The trial judge held
that a fiduciary relationship existed between the parties, that the dealer had
acted in breach of his fiduciary duty and ordered an account of profits. On
appeal, the Court of Appeal declared that there was a constructive trust over
the dealer`s assets in favour of the company. On further appeal, the High
Court of Australia held, inter alia, that the dealer was in breach of the
distributorship agreement and, by a majority, that there was no fiduciary
relationship between the parties. Gibbs CJ said at p 72:

> _An examination of all the circumstances confirms in my opinion that the
> relationship between the parties was not a fiduciary one. It is true that
> USSC relied on HPI to promote the sale of its products and left it to HPI to
> determine how it should go about doing so, and that HPI had it in its power
> to affect USSC`s interests beneficially or adversely. However, there are two
> features of the case, in particular, which together constitute an
> insuperable obstacle to the acceptance of USSC`s contention that a fiduciary
> relationship existed between itself and HPI. In the first place, as I have
> said, the arrangement was a commercial one entered into by parties at arm`s
> length and on an equal footing. ... An ordinary commercial contract made in
> those circumstances, even as a result of fraud, is unlikely to give rise
> fiduciary to obligations. Secondly, it was of course clear that the whole
> purpose of the transaction from Mr Blackman`s point of view, as USSC knew,
> was that he, and later HPI, should make a profit._

  
  
Dawson J at p 147 made the following general observations:

> _The circumstances in which the contract between USSC and Blackman was made
> do not suggest any disadvantage or vulnerability on the part of USSC
> requiring the intervention of equity to protect its interests. Those
> negotiations were of a commercial nature and were at arm`s length. They were
> conducted by persons on both sides who were experienced in the market place
> ..._

> _It may be conceded that USSC eventually accepted that there was no need for
> a formal agreement because of the misplaced trust which Hirsch and Josefsen
> had in Blackman`s integrity and ability. But that is not the sort of trust
> or confidence which equity will protect by the imposition of fiduciary
> obligations.**A fiduciary relationship does not arise where, because one of
> the parties to a relationship has wrongly assessed the trustworthiness of
> another, he has reposed confidence in him which he would not have done had

> persons who have dealings with one another frequently have confidence in
> each other and sometimes that confidence is misplaced. That does not make
> the relationship a fiduciary one ... A fiduciary relationship exists where
> one party is in a position of reliance upon the other **because of the
> nature of the relationship and not because of a wrong assessment of
> character or reliability**. That is to say, the relationship must be of a
> kind which of its nature requires one party to place reliance upon the
> other; it is not sufficient that he in fact does so in the particular
> circumstances ... [Emphasis is added]_

  
  
In our opinion, the 1990 oral agreement made between, on the one hand Linden
and Wiffen and, on the other, Friis, as varied in 1991 and 1992, was purely a
commercial financing arrangement, whereby Friis would provide security for the
overdraft facilities financing the back-to-back trading of equipment and in
return would receive a one-third share of the profits. In our judgment, the
rights of the parties are purely contractual, and neither Linden nor Wiffen
stood in any fiduciary relationship with Friis and none of the defendants were
fiduciaries of Friis or his company, Combined. In the words of Dawson J, the
circumstances in which the agreement was made did not suggest any inherent
disadvantage or vulnerability on the part of Friis requiring the intervention
of equity to protect his interests. The negotiations conducted were of a
commercial nature and were at arm`s length.  
  
**_Account of profits_**

****

The learned judge ordered that an account of the profits be taken of the use
of the funds withdrawn from the overdraft facilities, on the ground that the
defendants held those funds in trust for the plaintiffs and in breach of trust
had used the funds for other purposes. As we have now held that the defendants
were not trustees of the funds, and also did not stand in a fiduciary
relationship with the plaintiffs, it follows that there was no breach of trust
or breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the defendants. The defendants had
committed a breach of contract and for such breach an award of damages has
been made.  
  
The question now is whether in this case the plaintiffs are entitled to an
account of the profits derived from the use of the funds. We revert once again
to the terms of the 1990 oral agreement, the terms of which have been set out
in [para ] 3 above and it is unnecessary to replicate them here. Under the
terms of the agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992, the transactions to be
financed by the overdraft facilities were to be confined to the back-to-back
trading of equipment, and Friis was given to understand that Casetech would
only purchase the equipment from the seller when there was a ready purchaser
therefor, and consequently only profits from such transactions were
contemplated. On the basis of such terms as agreed, no sharing of any loss
from these trades was stipulated and agreed, and Friis was insulated from any
loss arising. In other words, under the 1990 oral agreement, as varied in 1991
and 1992, Friis would not be responsible for any loss occasioned by such back-
to-back transactions, and would not have to bear any part of it.  
  
It is not in dispute that Casetech had used funds from the overdraft
facilities provided by DB and later by HSBC for the purpose of financing back-
to-back transactions of equipment, and also for other purposes. The learned
judge said at [para ] 22:

> _There is evidence that CTL had used the overdraft in the DB and the HSBC
> accounts for purposes other than financing transactions under the oral
> agreement. What happened was that Wiffen and Linden had not bothered to keep
> separate the two types of transactions. Wiffen also gave evidence that
> although the funds were mixed, at all times the amount drawn down did not
> exceed the cost of equipment purchased under the oral agreement._

  
  
In so far as the funds from the overdraft facilities had been used for the
purpose of the back-to-back transactions - and these transactions had been
agreed by the parties - Casetech had not breached the agreement made with
Friis. As we have said above, if losses were incurred in any of such
transactions, Friis would not be responsible for such losses and would not
have to bear any part thereof. On the other hand, if profits were made, as the
parties had contemplated, Friis was entitled to a one-third share thereof, as
provided in the agreement. Thus, under the 1990 oral agreement, as varied in
1991 and 1992, Friis is entitled to an account of his share of the profits,
and an order should be made for an account to be taken of the profits from
such transactions but limited to the transactions occurring after 7 July 1992.
This is purely a contractual right to an account.  
  
We now turn to the use of the funds from the overdraft facilities for purposes
other than financing the transactions under the 1990 oral agreement. Such use
of funds by Casetech was clearly in breach of the agreement, and such breach
was not disputed by Casetech or Wiffen. The remedy for a breach of contract is
an award of damages. Subject to what is said below on restitutionary damages,
the general rule is that damages awarded for breach of contract are
compensatory and are intended to compensate the innocent party for the loss he
has sustained and not to disgorge the gain the wrongdoer has made and transfer
it to the innocent party. The object is to put the innocent party, so far as
money can do so, in the same position as if the contract had been performed.
In **Tito & Ors v Waddell & Ors (No 2)** [1977] 1 Ch 107, 332, Megarry V-C
said:

> _[I]t is fundamental to all questions of damages that they are to compensate
> the plaintiff for his loss or injury by putting him as nearly as possible in
> the same position as he would have been in had he not suffered the wrong.
> The question is not one of making the defendant disgorge what he has saved
> by committing the wrong, but one of compensating the plaintiff._

  
  
The question now is whether, in addition to the award of damages, the
plaintiffs are entitled to an account of profits derived from the use of the
funds in breach of the agreement. In **The Siboen; Occidental Worldwide
Investment Corp v Skibs A/S Avanti & Ors** [1976] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 293, where,
among other things, the owner of the two vessels on charter to the charterers
wrongfully withdrew the vessels in breach of the charterparties, it was held
that the charterers were entitled to damages in respect of the remainder of
the charter periods, and not to an account of the profits the shipowner had
derived from a more lucrative employment of the vessels elsewhere. Kerr J
said, at p 337:

> _In respect of the remainder of the charter periods they [the charterers]
> claim either an account of the profits which the owners made from the use of
> the ships or alternatively damages. I can see no basis for the charterers
> being entitled to an account of the profits made by the owners. If they are
> entitled to anything they are entitled to damages in the normal way on the
> ground that the owners wrongfully repudiated charter-parties by withdrawing
> the ships from their service._

  
  
It is helpful to refer also to **Surrey County Council & Anor v Bredero Homes
Ltd** [1993] 3 All ER 705. There, two local county councils, who were the
owners of two parcels of adjoining land, sold the land to a developer. In the
sale contract, the developer undertook to obtain planning permission for the
development of the site in accordance with the councils` scheme. Such planning
permission was duly obtained by the developer. The developer subsequently
applied and obtained fresh planning permission which enabled it to build more
houses than the number specified in the scheme approved by the councils. In
breach of contract, the developer proceeded to build the houses, and the
houses were eventually completed and were sold. On being sued by the councils,
the developer conceded the breach of contract, but argued that the councils
were entitled only to nominal damages. Both the judge at first instance and
the Court of Appeal held that the councils had not suffered any loss and were
not entitled to recover any substantial damages. The headnote of the case
states:

> _The remedy at common law for breach of contract was the award of damages to
> compensate the victim for his loss, not to transfer to the victim, if he had
> suffered no loss, the benefit which the wrongdoer had gained by his breach
> of contract. Furthermore, the innocent party was to be placed, so far as
> money could do so, in the same position as if the contract had been
> performed. Although damages might in an appropriate case cover profit which
> the injured plaintiff had lost, they did not cover an award to the
> plaintiffs of the profit which the defendant had gained for himself by his
> breach of contract when the plaintiff had himself suffered no loss. Since
> the plaintiff councils had not suffered any loss, it followed that the
> damages recoverable had to be merely nominal._

  
  
Dillon LJ said at p 709:

> _[T]he remedy at common law for a breach of contract is an award of damages
> and damages at common law are intended to compensate the victim for his
> loss, not to transfer to the victim, if he has suffered no loss, the benefit
> which the wrongdoer has gained by his breach of contract._

  
  
Later his Lordship said at p 712:

> _Given that the established basis of an award of damages in contract is
> compensation for the plaintiff`s loss, as indicated above, I have difficulty
> in seeing how Sir William Goodhart`s suggested common law principle of
> awarding the plaintiff, who has suffered no loss, the gain which the
> defendant has made by the breach of contract, is intended to go._

  
  
Steyn LJ, the other member of the court, while agreeing with Dillon LJ on the
award of damages, went further to consider whether the plaintiffs were
entitled to restitutionary damages. His Lordship said at p 714:

> _An award of compensation for breach of contract serves to protect three
> separate interests. The starting principle is that the aggrieved party ought
> to be compensated for loss of his positive or expectation interests. In
> other words, the object is to put the aggrieved party in the same financial
> position as if the contract had been fully performed. But the law also
> protects the negative interest of the aggrieved party. If the aggrieved
> party is unable to establish the value of a loss of bargain he may seek
> compensation in respect of his reliance losses. The object of such an award
> is to compensate the aggrieved party for expenses incurred and losses
> suffered in reliance of the contract. These two complementary principles
> share one feature. Both are pure compensatory principles ..._

> _There is, however, a third principle which protects the aggrieved party`s
> restitutionary interest. The object of such an award is not to compensate
> the plaintiff for a loss, but to deprive the defendant of the benefit he
> gained by the breach of contract. The classic illustration is a claim for
> the return of goods sold and delivered where the buyer has repudiated his
> obligation to pay the price. It is not traditional to describe a claim for
> restitution following a breach of contract as damages. What matters is that
> a coherent law of obligations must inevitably extend its protection to cover
> certain restitutionary interests. How far that protection should extend is
> the essence of the problem before us._

  
  
Having said this, his Lordship went on to consider various authorities and the
circumstances of the case, and declined to allow restitutionary damages: see p
715.  
  
It is perhaps pertinent to mention that in the very recent case of **A-G v
Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd, third party)** [1998] Ch 439, the Court of Appeal in
England considered (without however the benefit of any argument) the question
of retitutionary damages as a proper remedy for breach of contract, and held
obiter that there are at least two situations in which justice requires the
award of restitutionary damages where compensatory damages would be
inadequate. The first is where the defendant fails to provide the full extent
of the services which he has contracted to provide and for which he has
charged the plaintiff. The second is where the defendant has obtained his
profit by doing the very thing which he contracted not to do: see p 458.  
  
Reverting to the case at hand, the learned judge has made an award of damages
for breach of contract. That award is to compensate the plaintiffs the loss
they had sustained. In our judgment, the plaintiffs are not entitled, in
addition, to have an account taken of the profits derived from the use of the
funds by Casetech in breach of contract. In any event, even if the plaintiffs
were so entitled, we would not be disposed to make such an order in this case,
as the defendants did not appear to have made any profits from such use but
had sustained a loss, and it would be futile to order an account to be taken
of the profits, if any. For completeness, we would add that this is not a case
where an award of retitutionary damages is an appropriate remedy.  
  
We therefore set aside the order made below for the taking of accounts, and in
lieu thereof order an accounts to be taken of the profits made from the use of
funds from the overdraft facilities for the back-to-back trades or
transactions which the parties had agreed, but such taking of accounts be
limited to the back-to-back transactions occurring after the 7 July 1992. In
respect of the earlier period, the claim for an account is time-barred.  
  
**_Claim against Mrs Wiffen as an accessory to breach of trust_**

****

As there was no breach of trust committed by Linden or Wiffen, the question of
Mrs Wiffen`s involvement as an accessory to the breach of trust as alleged by
the plaintiffs does not arise. We would dismiss such claim against her.  
  
**_Mrs Wiffen`s costs below_**

****

The plaintiffs` claims against Mrs Wiffen for damages for breach of contract
and for an account of profits as an accessory to the alleged breach of trust
failed and were dismissed by the trial judge. However, the learned judge did
not make an order awarding her any costs. She now appeals against the failure
or refusal to make such an order.  
  
Presumably, the learned judge took the view that she, Wiffen and Casetech were
represented by the same firm of solicitors and by the same counsel in court,
and that she and Wiffen filed a joint defence, and no extra time and expenses
were incurred in her defence. We think that in this case some extra time and
expenses were incurred in preparing for her defence. She filed her affidavit
evidence in defending the claims and she gave evidence in court on the extent
of her involvement in the matters alleged by the plaintiffs. In our opinion,
an order as to costs should have been made in her favour. We would allow her
appeal.  
  
**_The limitation defence in respect of the claim for $929,712.92_**

****

Casetech and Wiffen raised the defence of limitation under s 6 (1) of the
Limitation Act in respect of a part of the claim for damages for breach of
contract. The amount of damages was quantified in the sum of $929,712.92,
after deducting the amount paid to Friis from the proceeds of sale or rentals
pursuant to the December 1992 agreement. That amount was part of the
outstanding sum of $1m on the overdraft account with HSBC at the time, when
the call was made on DDB`s guarantee and Friis` account with DDB was debited
with the sum of $1m. That was on or about 30 December 1992. Counsel for
Casetech and Wiffen submits that the plaintiffs` right of action for damages
for breach of contract arose with each amount overdrawn on the overdraft
account, and as at 6 July 1992, the overdraft account with HSBC was overdrawn
by a sum of $563,510.78, and this represented part of the damages which, in
counsel`s submission, was time-barred. Accordingly, the amount of damages
awarded should be reduced by this amount.  
  
We are unable to accept this argument. The sum of $929,712.72 was the balance
of the losses which amounted to $1m. On or about 30 December 1992, HSBC called
on the DDB`s guarantee for payment of the $1m, and that amount was paid by DDB
and debited to the account of Friis. The $1m represented the total amount of
the losses incurred by Casetech in or arising out of its performance of the
1990 oral agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992. Part payments amounting in
total to $70,287.08 were made in March and April 1993, leaving the balance of
$929,712.72, which was the amount claimed in the action. The claim for this
amount or any part thereof is therefore, in our view, not time-barred.  
  
It should be borne in mind that the overdraft account with HSBC was a running
account on a fluctuating basis, and deposits to and withdrawals from the
account were made from time to time. Assuming that the debit balance on the
overdraft account stood at $563,510.78 as at 6 July 1992, thereafter there
were made from time to time deposits to and withdrawals from that account, and
each deposit made would have gone towards payment, in whole or in part, of the
amount withdrawn in breach of the agreement. This account had throughout been
maintained as a running account, and the outstanding amount was crystallized
only when HSBC demanded payment of the sum of $1m and called on the DDB`s
guarantee.  
  
At any rate, under the financing arrangement made between the parties, there
was an implied obligation by the defendants to indemnify Friis against any
loss, and this implied indemnity could only be invoked when the DDB`s
guarantee was called on by HSBC and the amount paid by DDB was debited to his
account. The time on this claim by Friis did not begin to run until the call
was made and the amount was paid under the guarantee and debited to Friis`
account. It was only then that the true extent of the defendants` liability
could be ascertained.  
  
**_Interest on judgment debt_**

****

The trial judge awarded interest on the sum of $929,712.92 and any sum found
due under the account of profits from the date of writ. The plaintiffs
challenge this exercise of discretion under s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43,
1999 Ed) on the ground that it is a departure from the general practice of
awarding interest from the date of accrual of loss, that is 31 December 1992,
when HSBC called on the DDB`s guarantee.  
  
Although the general rule as contended for by the plaintiffs is indeed
established, the principal exception of this rule is unwarranted delay by the
plaintiff: **_McGregor on Damages_** , para 658, 668-669. This factor was
expressly considered by the learned judge in his judgment (at [para ] 29),
where he noted that Friis was content to sit on his claim for five years
before taking any action. The plaintiffs have not offered any other reasonable
explanation for the delay. Further, an award of interest covering the period
from date of writ to date of judgment is not without precedent in such a
context, although other methods are more common: see **Metal Box v Currys**
[1988] 1 All ER 341.  
  
The plaintiffs rely on **Mahtani & Ors v Kiaw Aik Kang Land Pte** [1995] 1 SLR
168  in support of the argument that to disallow such interest from the date
of accrual of loss would allow the defendants to profit from their own breach
of contract. That case is, however, distinguishable for the simple reason that
there, the defendants had the use of the money which was the subject of claim,
whereas here, the judgement sum represented compensation for loss suffered
which was never represented by any sum held by the defendants. We consider,
therefore, that there is no compelling reason in principle to interfere with
the exercise of discretion below and this order should continue to apply.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

For the reasons given, we allow CA 204/99 to the extent as follows: we set
aside the order made below for a taking of accounts, and in lieu thereof,
order an account to be taken of the profits made from the use of the overdraft
facilities for the back-to-back trades or transactions which the parties had
agreed, but such taking of account be limited to the back-to-back transactions
occurring after the 7 July 1992. We also award interest on the amount found
due on the taking of such account at the same rate as that awarded below, such
interest to run from the date of the writ. We allow Mrs Wiffen`s appeal on
costs, and award her the costs of defending the claims below.  
  
Turning to the costs of this appeal, we award Mrs Wiffen the costs of her
appeal. As regards Casetech and Wiffen, they have succeeded in part only, and
there are numerous points they took in this appeal, on which they failed. We
therefore award them only 30% of the costs of their appeal. The deposit in
court as security for costs is to be refunded to the appellants or their
solicitors, together with interest, if any.  
  
We dismiss CA 203/99 with costs. The deposit in court as security for costs is
to be paid to the respondents in this appeal or their solicitors, with
interest, if any, to account of costs.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
