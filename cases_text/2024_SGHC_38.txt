General Division of the High Court — Originating Claim No 193 of 2022
(Registrar’s Appeal No 243 of 2023)  
Goh Yihan J  
15 January 2024

8 February 2024 Judgment reserved.

Goh Yihan J:

1 This is an appeal by the first and second defendants in HC/OC 193/2022 (“OC
193”) against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar Jacqueline Lee
(“AR Lee”) to refuse their application in HC/SUM 2893/2023 (“SUM 2893”) for
the striking out of the whole or part of the claimants’ claim against them for
certain amounts (referred to hereafter as the “Overwithdrawn Sums”). In the
alternative, the first and second defendants seek an order from the court
directing the claimants to make appropriate amendments to their pleadings to
clarify that the claimants have relinquished any claim to certain sums
(referred to hereafter as the “Internal Transfers”). 1

2 Having taken some time to consider the matter, I dismiss the first and
second defendants’ appeal for the reasons below.

Background facts

3 I begin with the background facts as formulated for the purpose of the
present application. From early 2016 to early 2020, the first claimant, Envy
Asset Management Pte Ltd (“EAM”) purported to be in the business of nickel
trading. It did so by supposedly purchasing quantities of nickel at a
discount, and then reselling the nickel at a profit. Investors invested in
EAM’s purported nickel trading by entering into Letters of Agreement (“LOAs”)
with EAM. In brief, under the terms of the LOA, investors would invest a
principal sum with EAM, and upon the maturity date of the LOA, they would be
entitled to a return of their principal investment along with profits paid out
from EAM’s profits from its purported nickel trading business. 2

4 Subsequently, it emerged that EAM’s purported nickel trading was non-
existent. Instead, profits were paid out to earlier investors from the
invested funds of subsequent investors. 3

After the scheme unravelled, EAM and its related companies (collectively, the
“Envy Companies”), the second and third claimants, Envy Management Holdings
Pte Ltd and Envy Global Trading Pte Ltd, respectively, were compulsorily wound
up. 4

##### Foot Note 4

5 OC 193 is an action brought by the liquidators of the Envy Companies to
recover certain sums that were paid to the defendants, who are former
employees of the Envy Companies, in connection with the non-existent nickel
trading. 5

##### Foot Note 5

×

Yap’s 8th Affidavit at para 2.2.1.

6 For the purposes of SUM 2893 and the present appeal therefrom, only the
claim in respect of the Overwithdrawn Sums is relevant. 6

##### Foot Note 6

×

Yap’s 8th Affidavit at para 2.2.2.

The Overwithdrawn Sums represent the fictitious profits from the non-existent
nickel trading that were paid out to the first, second, and fifth to eighth
defendants (the “relevant defendants”), who received the said sums not
strictly as employees of the Envy Companies but as investors. As mentioned
above, the Overwithdrawn Sums were paid out from the invested funds of other
investors.

7 The claimants have sought to claw back the Overwithdrawn Sums through
various causes of action: (a) transactions defrauding creditors under s 73B of
the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”) and/or
s 438 and s 439(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018
(2020 Rev Ed) (“IRDA”); (b) transactions at an undervalue under s 224 of the
IRDA; (c) unfair preferences under s 225 of the IRDA; and (d) unjust
enrichment.

8 To compute the quantum of the Overwithdrawn Sums that are claimed against
the relevant defendants, the claimants have applied a “running account”
approach. This entails setting out all inflows and outflows in respect of each
of the relevant defendants’ purported nickel trading accounts with the Envy
Companies (based on the records available to the claimants). 7

##### Foot Note 7

×

Yap’s 8th Affidavit at para 3.1.2.

From this, the claimants have derived the quantum of the Overwithdrawn Sums
which is the net of aggregating the inflows and outflows. 8

The parties’ arguments

The first and second defendants’ arguments

9 The first and second defendants sought in SUM 2893 to strike out the whole
or part of the claimants’ claim for the Overwithdrawn Sums in OC 193. The
principal objection that the first and second defendants raised is the
claimants’ inclusion of a specific category of transfers as relevant outflows
in their computations pursuant to the running account approach. 9

193/2022 (“Lau’s 3rd Affidavit”) dated 21 September 2023 at paras 13–15; 3rd
Affidavit of Teo Wei Wen, Benjamin in HC/OC 193/2022 dated 21 September 2023
(“Teo’s 3rd Affidavit”) at paras 13–15.

This impugned category of transfers is the aforementioned Internal Transfers
(at [1] above), which refer to transfers from the relevant defendants’
purported nickel trading accounts to the accounts of other investors.

10 In essence, the first and second defendants argued that since the
claimants’ pleaded case is that the Internal Transfers do not entail any
actual withdrawal of moneys out of the Envy Companies, the claimants’ claim
for the Overwithdrawn Sums must fail in as much as they include the Internal
Transfers. 10

dissipation of assets from the estate of the relevant company. 12

Since the Internal Transfers did not lead to such dissipation of assets, the

and law. 14

##### Foot Note 14

×

DWS (SUM) at p 13.

11 Furthermore, the first and second defendants also argued that it is
impermissible for the claimants to rely on the Internal Transfers to derive
the total Overwithdrawn Sums claimed against the relevant defendants. Rather,
the court must consider the derived quantum of Overwithdrawn Sums if the
Internal Transfers were to be excluded from the computation. In this respect,
as regards the first defendant, because the Internal Transfers exceed the
amount being claimed against him, the computation of the Overwithdrawn Sums
would produce a net negative figure. This would result in the claimants’ claim
against him being dismissed entirely. As for the second defendant, while the
Internal Transfers do not exceed the amount being claimed against him,
striking out the Internal Transfers would result in a lower computed quantum
of the Overwithdrawn Sums, and therefore a lower claim against him. 15

In addition, as I mentioned at the outset of this judgment, they now also
seek, for the first time, on appeal, that the claimants be directed to make
appropriate amendments to their pleadings to clarify that they are not seeking
to claw back the sums constituting the Internal Transfers. 17

##### Foot Note 17

According to them, the claimants have a duty to plead their case in as clear

their pleadings. 19

The claimants’ arguments

13 In response, the claimants argue that the first and second defendants’
complaint essentially pertains to the methodology used by the claimants in
calculating the Overwithdrawn Sums. Any dispute over methodology should be
determined at trial. 20

14 In response to the first and second defendants’ allegations that the
Internal Transfers do not entail any actual withdrawal of moneys out of the
Envy Companies, the claimants make the following submissions. First, the
Internal Transfers may have been subsequently transferred out of the Envy
Companies, and may therefore not necessarily remain within the Envy Companies’
bank accounts. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

CWS (RA) at para 4.1.6.

This possibility is not precluded by the mere fact that the Internal Transfers
were transfers to the bank accounts of other investors. 22

Second, even if the moneys remain within the Envy Companies’ bank account, the
relevant defendants could still have received consideration and/or been
enriched by the Internal Transfers. 23

At the hearing, Ms Lee Ping, who appeared on behalf of the claimants, further
submitted that it is self-evident that the claimants are not claiming for the
Internal Transfers. In this regard, she pointed to the fact that while the
Internal Transfers amount to over $7m, the claimants’ pleaded claim for the
Overwithdrawn Sums is roughly only $584,700. There was therefore no defect or
ambiguity in the pleadings to justify a striking out or requiring any
amendment to be made. 24

My decision: the appeal is dismissed

15 Having considered the parties’ arguments, I dismiss the first and second
defendants’ appeal for the reasons below.

The applicable law

16 To begin with, the first and second defendants’ application in SUM 2893 to
strike out the claimants’ claim in OC 193 was based on O 9 r 16(1) of the
Rules of Court 2021 (the “ROC 2021”), which provides that:

Striking out pleadings and other documents (O. 9, r. 16)

16.—(1) The Court may order any or part of any pleading to be struck out or
amended, on the ground that —

(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence;

(b) it is an abuse of process of the Court; or

(c) it is in the interests of justice to do so,

and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered
accordingly.

However, and this is a point that I will return to below, the first and second
defendants do not make clear in their written submissions for this appeal
which limb in O 9 r 16(1) that they are relying on.

17 In the High Court decision of Leong Quee Ching Karen v Lim Soon Huat and
others [2023] 4 SLR 1133 (“Karen Leong”), the court made the following general
observations on the law on striking out (at [25]–[26]):

25 First, it is trite that the bar for succeeding in a striking out
application is a high one. Thus, it has been said in Wing Joo Loong Ginseng
Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another
and another appeal [2009] 2 SLR(R) 814, where the Court of Appeal cited its
previous decision in Ko Teck Siang v Low Fong Mei [1992] 1 SLR(R) 22, which in
turn endorsed the English Court of Appeal case of Wenlock v Moloney [1965] 1
WLR 1238, (at [172]) that the power to strike out is “very sparingly
exercised, and only [applied] in very exceptional cases” and would not be
justified “merely because the story told in the pleadings was highly
improbable, and one which it was difficult to believe could be proved”. …

26 Second, pursuant to the above, the applicant in a striking out application
bears the burden of proving that the claim is “obviously unsustainable, the
pleadings [are] unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable,
for the claim to succeed before the court will strike it out” (see the High
Court decisions of Koh Kim Teck v Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch [2015]
SGHC 52 at [21] as well as Bank of China Ltd, Singapore Branch v BP Singapore
Pte Ltd and others [2021] 5 SLR 738 at [21]).

18 As for the first ground in O 9 r 16(1)(a), the Court of Appeal explained
(albeit in relation to its predecessor provision) in Gabriel Peter & Partners
(suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“Gabriel
Peter”) (at [21]) that the guiding principle in determining what constitutes a
“reasonable cause of action” is whether the pleadings demonstrate some chance
of success or raise a question fit to be decided at trial. Similarly, the
Court of Appeal explained in Iskandar bin Rahmat and others v Attorney-General
and another [2022] 2 SLR 1018 (“Iskandar”) (at [17]) that the test under O 9 r
16(1)(a) is whether “the action has some chance of success when only the
allegations in the pleadings are concerned”. Thus, a cause of action will not
be struck out just because the case is weak and is not likely to succeed. In
assessing the viability of an action, a court will presume the pleaded facts
to be true in favour of the claimant since this is properly a question of law
(see the High Court decision of Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd [1991] 1
SLR(R) 844 at [29]).

19 Turning now to the two grounds in O 9 rr 16(1)(b) and 16(1)(c), the High
Court has held (albeit in relation to the predecessor provisions) that there
would be an abuse of process (which is the ground under r 16(1)(b)) if a
claimant knowingly pursues a case that is “doomed to fail” (see Kim Hok Yung
and others v Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as
Rabobank) (Lee Mon Sun, third party) [2000] 2 SLR(R) 455 (“Kim Hok Yung”) at
[17]). In such a case, the claimant would, in effect, be wasting the court’s
time and this would amount to an abuse of process as the proceedings serve no
useful purpose (see Karen Leong at [28]). Further, the Court of Appeal
explained in Iskandar (at [18]) that this ground “includes considerations of
public policy and the interests of justice”, in that “the process of the court
must be used bona fide and properly and must not be abused”. Therefore, the
emphasis is on preventing the “improper use of [the courts’] machinery and the
judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the
process of litigation” (see Iskandar at [18], referring to Gabriel Peter at
[22]).

20 As for the broad ground under r 16(1)(c), Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC has
observed that this is a new provision that has no counterpart in O 18 r 19 of
the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). The learned author comments that this
provision is “residuary in nature and is intended to empower the court to
terminate an action or dismiss a defence or make any other appropriate order
if this outcome is necessary to achieve the interests of justice”. Thus, the
inclusion of this provision means that “if there are circumstances which do
not fall within paras (a) and (b) of r 16(1), they may be caught by para (c)
of r 16(1)” (see Jeffrey Pinsler, Singapore Civil Practice (LexisNexis, 2022)
at para 24−113).

The first and second defendants are relying primarily, if not only, on the
ground in O 9 r 16(1)(a)

21 While the first and second defendants do not make clear in their
submissions for this appeal which of the grounds in O 9 r 16(1) they are
relying on, it appears that they are relying on ground (a) given their
characterisation of the claimants’ “cause of action” as being “unsustainable”
or “untenable”. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

DWS (RA) at para 15.

In my view, counsel should clearly specify which limb of O 9 r 16 they are
invoking, and to particularise their arguments according to the legal standard
for that limb. This ensures conceptual clarity in their arguments.

22 To be fair to the first and second defendants, they did state in their
written submissions before AR Lee that they were relying on all three grounds
in O 9 r 16(1). 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

DWS (SUM) at para 19.

However, even then, their submissions below largely centred on how the
claimants’ case is “unsustainable in law”. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

DWS (SUM) at pp 13–18.

In this appeal, without specifying which limb of O 9 r 16 they are invoking,
the first and second defendants state, in a heading to a particular section in
their written submissions, that “[i]t is legally and factually unsustainable,
and an abuse of process, for the Claimants to seek to claw back the
Overwithdrawn Sums …” [emphasis added]. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

DWS (RA) at p 9.

The first and second defendants therefore appear to have collapsed grounds (b)
and (c) in O 9 r 16(1) into ground (a). In effect, they seem to be saying that
because the claimants are pursuing a case that discloses no reasonable cause
of action, the claimants must, by extension, be abusing the process of the
court, and that it must also be in the interests of justice to strike out the
claimants’ claim.

23 As a matter of principle, I am hesitant to collapse the three grounds in O
9 r 16(1) in the manner that the first and second defendants seem to be doing.
In the first place, the three grounds in O 9 r 16(1) are framed in the
alternative to each other. This connotes that they are separate and distinct.
If the first and second defendants’ logic were correct, every striking out
application that succeeds on ground (a) would also succeed on grounds (b) and
(c). This would defeat the purpose of setting out three separate grounds for
striking out. More broadly, and on a slightly different point, I respectfully
agree with Hri Kumar Nair J’s observations in the High Court decision of Asian
Eco Technology Pte Ltd v Deng Yiming [2023] SGHC 260 (at [18]) that “the
grounds of ‘abuse of process’ and ‘interests of justice’ under O 9 r 16 of the
ROC 2021 should not be construed too widely” because “[a]n overly liberal
interpretation of the grounds under O 9 r 16 may invite a deluge of striking
out applications and appeals arising out of these applications”.

24 As such, I do not think that a claimant who pursues a case (or part of a
case) that discloses no reasonable cause of action is necessarily one who has
abused the court’s process. Instead, the emphasis of the ground in O 9 r
16(1)(b), as the Court of Appeal held in Iskandar (at [18]), is on matters of
public policy. One policy concern encompassed by O 9 r 16(1)(b) is that a
claimant, who knowingly pursues a case that is “doomed to fail”, should have
its claim struck out. In this sub-category of cases, however, the focus is on
the mental state of the claimant, and not the mere fact that the claimant
happens to have brought a case that turns out to be unsustainable.

25 Indeed, this understanding of O 9 r 16(1)(b) is borne out by Kim Hok Yung,
which was concerned with its predecessor provision in the prevailing Rules of
Court at the time. In Kim Hok Yung, the plaintiffs were recruited by the
defendants to help the latter set up, operate, and carry on the business of
investment banking. When the defendants ceased their investment business and
terminated the plaintiffs’ employment (as they were contractually entitled
to), the plaintiffs brought claims for misrepresentation in tort and under
statute pursuant to s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed).
The alleged misrepresentations included, among others, that the defendants had
taken steps to establish an investment banking business and the plaintiffs’
expertise was required to participate in this business (at [3]). The High
Court seems to have found that the plaintiffs could not have, and must have
known that they had not, relied on the purported misrepresentations (at [15]
and [18]). Therefore, in suing for misrepresentation, the plaintiffs were
bringing an action that they knew, or must have known, could not succeed. In
doing so, they were making a frivolous and vexatious claim, thereby, abusing
the process of court (at [17]). This is thus consistent with my view that O 9
r 16(1)(b) is concerned with, among others, claimants who knowingly pursue a
case that is “doomed to fail”.

The claimants’ case on the Internal Transfers is not without a reasonable
cause of action

26 Taking the first and second defendants’ reliance to be primarily on the
ground in O 9 r 16(1)(a), I find that the claimants have shown a reasonable
cause of action in their case on the Internal Transfers.

27 First, I agree with the claimants that it is not necessarily the case that
the Internal Transfers remained within the Envy Companies’ bank accounts, and
that the mere fact that the Internal Transfers were transfers to the bank
accounts of other investors does not preclude the possibility that they were
later transferred out of the Envy Companies. 29

##### Foot Note 29

CWS (RA) at para 4.1.6.

What has eventually become of the moneys that were the subject of the Internal
Transfers is something for the claimants to prove at trial.

28 Second, I also agree with the claimants that, even if the Internal
Transfers remain within the Envy Companies’ bank accounts, this does not
necessarily preclude the claimants from claiming for the underlying sums. The
claimants may be able to establish, on the facts and in law, that the relevant
defendants had received consideration and/or were enriched. For instance, the
claimants have pointed out the possibility that the relevant defendants may
have nominated third parties to receive the Internal Transfers. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

CWS (RA) at para 4.1.8.

Again, this is something for the claimants to prove at trial. This argument
also potentially responds to the first and second defendants’ argument (at
[10] above) that for the claimants’ claim to the Overwithdrawn Sums to
succeed, they must prove either a dissipation of the Envy Companies’ assets,
or a benefit enjoyed by the Envy Companies. Given what I have said above, the
claimants’ case is not unarguable. It certainly cannot be said that the
claimants are so plainly wrong that their case in relation to the
Overwithdrawn Sums should be struck out.

29 Third, and more broadly, the claimants have pleaded the material facts at
length. They have also provided an account of their calculation of the
Overwithdrawn Sums paid to the relevant defendants. 31

Thus, while the first and second defendants say that they cannot be left to
guess which transactions from the line entries led to the Overwithdrawn Sums
the claimants are claiming, it is clear from the pleadings that the claimants
are not claiming for the Internal Transfers. In any event, I find that there
is also a factually and legally sustainable claim under O 9 r 16(1)(c) when
one looks beyond the pleadings to the affidavit evidence (which would not have
been permitted under the ground in O 9 r 16(1)(a); see the High Court decision
of Peloso, Matthew v Vikash Kumar and another [2023] SGHC 308 at [26]).
Indeed, in the relevant affidavit evidence, 33

the claimants clearly define the Overwithdrawn Sums as “monies in excess of
the principal amounts which are in the nature of purported profits from the
Purported Nickel Trading paid to [the relevant defendants].” 34

It should therefore be clear to the first and second defendants the case that
they have to meet. In any event, I agree with the claimants that the essence
of the first and second defendants’ complaint is really about the methodology
that the claimants have used in arriving at the Overwithdrawn Sums. But this
does not mean that the claimants’ case on the Overwithdrawn Sums is so wrong
as to be struck out for not disclosing a reasonable cause of action.

30 Fourth, as I indicated to counsel for the first and second defendants, Mr
Daniel Liu (“Mr Liu”), at the hearing, I have difficulty in striking out a
claim in its entirety that, on the first and second defendants’ best argument,
is overinclusive. 35

The first and second defendants’ case is only that the Internal Transfers,
being part of the claimants’ calculation of the quantum of the Overwithdrawn
Sums (or so they argue), should be struck out for not disclosing a reasonable
cause of action. Yet, their prayers are for all references to the
Overwithdrawn Sums to be struck out. 36

Thus, to strike out such references would be overinclusive as it would also
strike out line entries that are not Internal Transfers, which are not – on
the first and second defendants’ own case – without a reasonable cause of
action. In so far as the first and second defendants suggest that the
Overwithdrawn Sums are derived from, among others, taking into account the
Internal Transfers, that is an argument that goes towards the claimants’
methodology, as opposed to any fundamental flaw in the claimants’ case that
warrants a striking out at this stage.

31 Accordingly, it cannot be said that the claimants’ case in relation to the
Internal Transfers fails to demonstrate some chance of success or raise
questions fit to be decided at trial. For these reasons, I dismiss the first
and second defendants’ appeal against AR Lee’s decision below.

The first and second defendants’ new prayer for the pleadings to be amended is
not allowed

32 For completeness, I also dismiss the first and second defendants’ new
prayer for an order that the pleadings be amended by the claimants. While the
first and second defendants do not specify the provision which they are
relying on in the ROC 2021 for this prayer, it appears to me that this ought
to be O 9 r 16(1). This is because this is a case of a defendant asking for
the claimant’s pleadings to be amended, as opposed to a claimant taking the
initiative, as is the usual case, to seek permission to amend its pleadings
(see O 9 r 14(1) of the ROC 2021).

33 To begin with, this is a fresh point on appeal. To be fair to the first and
second defendants, Mr Liu clarified at the hearing that this new point has
only been taken up on appeal in light of the claimants’ allegedly new position
before AR Lee 37

that they would not be claiming for the Internal Transfers. 38

##### Foot Note 38

Minute Sheet (RA) at p 3.

Nevertheless, the point remains that the claimants could not meaningfully
respond to this fresh prayer because they only had sight of it after the
exchange of the written submissions for this appeal.

34 More substantively, it appears to me that, as a matter of logic, if a
defendant’s application to strike out a pleading for a particular reason under
O 9 r 16(1) fails as a result of that reason not being established, then their
application for amendment will likely not succeed under the same provision, if
the reason proffered for the amendment is the same as that advanced to support
the unsuccessful striking out application. In this regard, O 9 r 16(1)
provides the grounds not only for striking out but also for amendments. This
much is clear from the wording of O 9 r 16(1): “[t]he Court may order any or
part of any pleading to be struck out or amended on the ground that …”
[emphasis added]). As such, once a court concludes that all the grounds in O 9
r 16(1) have not been established by the reason advanced by a defendant in
support of a striking out, then it should generally follow that those same
grounds in O 9 r 16(1) are also not established by the same reason in support
of an amendment. However, these observations should also be read subject to
the Court of Appeal’s observations in Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the extate
of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit and another appeal [2000] 1 SLR(R)
53 (at [12]), that “[i]n general, the court’s approach to an application to
strike out the statement of claim is to consider if the deficiency or defect
therein, on the basis of which the application was made, could be cured by an
amendment, and would prefer to allow an amendment rather than to take the
drastic course of striking it out”.

35 In the present case, it is important that the first and second defendants
have essentially relied on the same reason to support both their prayer for
striking out and their prayer for amendment, which is that the claimants have
no basis to include the Internal Transfers in their claims. In this regard,
implicit in my dismissal of the first and second defendants’ application to
strike out the affected pleadings based on this reason, is a finding that they
have also failed to establish any of the grounds for amendment under O 9 r
16(1) in respect of those pleadings for the same reason. Therefore, it must
follow that the first and second defendants’ new prayer for the same pleadings
to be amended for the same reason must be dismissed.

Conclusion

36 For all the reasons discussed above, I dismiss the first and second
defendants’ appeal.

37 Unless the parties can agree, they are to submit their respective written
submissions on the appropriate costs order, limited to seven pages each,
within 14 days of this decision.
