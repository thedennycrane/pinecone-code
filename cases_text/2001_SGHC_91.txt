**JUDGMENT:**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

_

Background

_

1\. The nature of the dispute before me arose from a settlement agreement
reached between the parties in the consolidated Companies Winding Up Petition
162 of 1996 and Originating Summons 727 of 1996. The parties in the
consolidated matters may be categorized into three groups. The plaintiffs are
members of the Bajumi family from Indonesia. The second to fifth defendants
are members of the Tan family from Singapore. The first defendant is a company
(the "Company") in which the Bajumi and Tan families own or control equal
shares. Essentially, the Company has three principal assets. First, a major
block of shares in Ssangyong Corporation Ltd, secondly, the leasehold interest
in the building known as the Afro-Asia Building, and thirdly, a rubber
plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. The Company was founded by the patriarchs of
the two families many years ago. The families now no longer share a common
vision for the company and that gave rise to disputes which culminated in the
two consolidated actions. On the date of the trial of the actions, namely 14
April 1998, the parties appeared by counsel to record a settlement in which
the general intention was that the Bajumis from Indonesia would keep the
Indonesian assets and the Tan family would take the Singapore assets
(comprising the Ssangyong shares and the Afro-Asia Building). This
necessitated a valuation of the assets for the purpose of one party buying
over the others share. The parties were unable to agree as to how the order of
court was to be carried out and that led their return to the court on 10
November 1998 to vary the orders of 14 April 1998. The original orders and
subsequent variations were all made by consent. Consequently, both sides
adduced valuation reports of the three assets that were so far apart that the
dispute concerning the values of the three principal assets had to be resolved
by this court.

2\. In these proceedings the parties had, by consent, nominated three
assessors (as independent assessors) to assist me in respect of each of the
assets. Mr. Sajjad Akhtar (assisted by Mr. Andrew Grimmett) of Arthur
Andersen, was appointed as assessor in respect of the valuation of the
Ssangyong shares, and as co-assessor together with Dr. Chee Kheng Hoy of Lyman
Agro, in respect of the valuation of the rubber plantation. Mr. Philip Leow
(assisted by Ms Chiah Soo Ling) of Debenham Tie Leung, was appointed in
respect of the valuation of Afro-Asia Building. The assessors are all highly
qualified experts in their field, and I will say at the outset that they had
discharged their duty and function most professionally and impartially; and I
record the courts indebtedness to them especially for the immense amount of
work they had so diligently put in, and in easing my way through the work of
the valuation experts - work which is at times scientific and at times
artistic.

3\. Before I dwell on the valuations individually, it is necessary to set out
the consent orders of 14 April and 10 November 1998. They are as follows:

The Ssangyong Shares

_

4\. The Company holds 17.4 million shares in Ssangyong Cement Singapore Ltd.
The issue between the parties lie in their disagreement over the agreed terms
of settlement (as varied). The Bajumi family take the view that the consent
order required the parties to produce a fair value of the shares by reference
to the six dates specified in the variation order; and by this they understand
to mean calculating the fair value by ascertaining the market value of the
shares on the six dates and then deriving the average value. The Tan family,
on the other hand, emphasized that the consent order requires the six dates to
be taken into account only if that was possible. Counsel for the Tan family,
Mr. Wong Meng Meng SC, submitted that it was impossible to have a fair value
of the shares with reference to six different dates. He submitted that the
expert valuer must first determine the appropriate method for valuing the
shares before proceeding to take into account the specifics such as the
reference to the six dates. In short, his submission was that fair value ought
not be interpreted as "market value". Consequently, Mr. Wong submitted that
the "dividend yield" method used by his expert (Mr. Chan Ket Teck) was the
correct approach. Mr. Chan was of the view that the rival approach (that of
Dr. Low) is maintainable only if a huge discount of 40% is made to off-set the
illiquidity of having 17.4 million shares on the market. Mr. Wong had a
further criticism of using market price as an indicia for fair value. He said
that even Dr. Low admitted that there were "wide fluctuations" in the price
and that reflected a substantial price volatility. Mr. Chans dividend yield
method based on a dividend yield of 10.44% thus produced the value of
$17,922,000 or $1.03 a share. Dr. Lows method produced $64,140,605 or $3.69 a
share. He also gave an alternative calculation with a weighted average which
produced $63,853,024 or $3.67 a share. On the other hand, Dr. Low had two
criticisms of the dividend yield method. First, he said that companies have in
recent times been more reluctant to pay dividends; and secondly, that it is
the desire for capital gains and not dividends that actuates investors.

5\. It was not disputed that there is more than one way of evaluating the fair
value of shares in a public company. No specific method was agreed between the
parties save that in calculating the fair value, reference must be made to the
six dates selected by the parties if possible. No reasons were given as to why
these six dates were important. The question is, whether it is possible to
assess the fair value of the shares "with reference to the six dates". Dr. Low
testified that he had no difficulty understanding the consent order and was
able to evaluate the fair value of the shares with reference to the six dates.

6\. The first issue I have to determine, therefore, is whether it is possible
to calculate the fair value of the shares with reference to the six dates.
This term was included as part of the consent order so it must reasonably be
assumed that the six dates are of some importance to the parties one way or
the other. However, the defendants object to the disclosure of the
significance of the six dates, and in this regard, they may have a valid
point. They say that various events took place over those dates and these are
highly contentious matters. Thus, the compromise reached in their agreed
formula for division was to calculate the fair value of the shares not on any
one of the dates (as should ordinarily be the case), but to do so with regard
to all six dates. Although the defendants expert, Mr. Chan, was of the view
that it was not possible to take the six dates into account, but if he was
compelled to do so, he could do it, but only after factoring a 40% discount in
the final result. This was necessitated by the illiquidity of the stock. No
basis was given as to how he arrived at the rate of 40% although I will accept
that such an exercise is largely arbitrary. I am of the view that a flat rate
of 40% applied to the final result may be excessive. Applying, strictly, the
dividend yield method over the period 1995 to 1997, Mr. Chan arrived at the
value of S$17.904 million, rounded to S$1.03 a share. Dr. Low the plaintiffs
expert, on the other hand, had no problems with the method proposed in the
consent order. He took the market value of the shares and averaged them, after
assigning various weights to the individual six dates, to arrive at his figure
of S$62.614 million. Dr. Low took the subjective (and thus disputed)
significance of the six dates (using information supplied by the clients) in
calculating the weight to be assigned to those dates. I have no hesitation in
finding that this would be wrong. However, Dr. Low had also proposed a simple,
unweighted average of the market values of the shares over those six dates and
he arrived at S$58.5445 million, rounded up to S$3.34 a share. He had to apply
a volume-weighted share price for each of the six months as follows:

> October 1994 - S$5.41
>
> August 1995 S$3.96
>
> February 1996 S$4.34
>
> July 1996 S$3.79
>
> January 1998 S$0.93
>
> April 1998 - S$1.72

7\. I am of the view that this alternative method of Dr. Low is preferable to
Mr. Chans. The consent order of court requires the parties to have regard to
the six dates, but since no information is supplied in respect of the
significance of the six dates, no special weight need be given to any of them,
but they should not be ignored. Although the dividend yield method is an
acceptable method of calculating the fair value of a companys shares, there
are some negative aspects to this method. One of which is that many modern
companies do not declare dividends in order to allocate the funds to other
beneficial use. It appears that such was the case in respect of the company in
question. Secondly, once the parties agree to calculate the fair value with
reference to six dates, the overly flexible nature of the dividend yield
method will have to be applied six times over, thereby exaggerating any
inaccuracy in the process. Where the market value is freely available it is
certainly reasonable to use that as a guide unless there are sufficiently
compelling reasons against its use. In this case, I have no difficulty in
applying the market values over the six dates. I have no difficulty with the
volume weighted price for each of the six months. The opposing experts held
widely differing views as to how much discount ought to be given to take into
account the liquidity (or lack of it) when such a large block of shares is put
on the open market. However, neither had considered the counter-balance of the
power of control that the holder of this block of shares can wield. Taking
these factors into account, and accepting that the actual discount rate is to
a large extent arbitrary, I find that the fair value of the Ssangyong shares
to be S$3.34 a share (or S$58,110,000.00).

_

The Afro-Asia Building

_

8\. The agreement in respect of the valuation of the Afro-Asia Building was
similar in principle to that concerning the Ssangyong shares. The only
difference was that instead of having reference to six dates, the parties
agreed to refer to four dates, as Mr. Wong quickly pointed out, "if possible".
The dispute involved not only the question whether it was possible to have
regard to the four dates in the valuation, but whether the valuation ought to
be made with regard to the full potential of the building. The four dates
stipulated under the consent order were October 1994, August 1995, July 1996,
and April 1998. The expert valuer for the Bajumis family was Ms. Lydia Sng
from the Knight Frank Pte Ltd. Ms. Sng adopted the comparable sales method as
well as the residual land value method as the basis for her valuation, with
each being used as "a check against the other". The market value as at each of
these dates was $59,520,000, $74,120,000, $75,259,000, $56,150,000
respectively. The expert for the Tan family was Mr. Li Hiaw Ho from CB Richard
Ellis Pte Ltd. He produced the valuation of the building as at April 1998 only
and his valuation was $37,110,000. It will be seen at once that the valuations
of Mr. Li and Ms. Sng differ substantially in respect of the April 1998 date
alone.

9\. Apart from the critical difference of Mr. Lis single date valuation and Ms
Sngs four-date valuation, there was another important difference in the two
approaches, namely that Mr. Li disregarded the full potential of the building
whereas Ms. Sng took that into account in her valuation of 8 March 2000. That
was the valuation put forward at trial and will be the one I would use to
determine the strength of the plaintiffs case. It will be seen that the
valuation of the Afro-Asia Building requires more art than the valuation of
the Ssangyong shares although market value forms the backbone of the valuation
in both instances. In the latter case, the market value was, in fact, a
comparative market value and not the market value of the building itself as it
was not put up for sale at the material times. For the same reasons as I have
set out in respect of the Ssangyong shares, I am of the view that the single
date valuation is not the correct approach. The parties had agreed to value
the property according to the fair value, if possible, by reference to the
market values of the building on the four dates they agreed upon and I am not
persuaded that this would be impossible to do.

10\. Mr. Li assessed the building in its existing state as at 14 April 1998 as
S$37,000,000.00 (or about S$600 per square foot). This was on the basis that
the development charge (or differential premium) is paid off. Mr. Li takes the
value on the basis of the 53 years remainder of the 99-year lease. In my view,
it is not reasonable to exclude the potential of the building in evaluating
its fair value. In this case, there are two potential factors. First, the
owner may top-up the lease to bring it back to a full 99-year lease, and
secondly, to re-develop building. He might do either or both. Taking the
potential into account is more difficult than it seems because it is a
subjective appraisement. The new owner may decide that he would do neither. In
this case, taking the existing condition of the building and the length of the
remaining lease, it appears to me that a potential buyer will look towards
redevelopment rather than be content to harvest the fruit of the planted tree
until the end of the trees natural life. In this regard, I am of the view that
Ms Sngs valuation of 8 March 2000 to be the more appropriate and reasonable of
the two. Her valuation based on the average of the four dates is
S$66,260,000.00. The court assessor, Mr. Leow, is in full agreement, but he
cautioned that Ms Sngs valuation is ostensibly flawed in one respect, namely
that she had not taken the holding cost on the differential land premium into
account. Hence, the estimated differential land premium must be deducted at
the end of the computation for each of the four years. If that is taken into
account, the valuation of Ms Sng will be adjusted to S$57,625,000.00. The
courts assessor, Mr. Leow would have done a few things differently from the
two opposing experts, but acknowledging the highly subjective nature of this
exercise, he accepts my view that there should be no interference other than
the one above. I, therefore, find that the fair value of the Afro-Asia
Building to be S$57,625,000.00.

_

The Rubber Plantation In Indonesia

_

11\. If the valuation of property is more art than science, the valuation of a
rubber plantation borders on fortune-telling. Given the expertise of the two
protagonist experts, Mr. Fernandez (for the Bajumis) and Dr. Wijesekera, the
difference in their respective assessment was vast. Mr. Fernandez calculated
the value to be US$3.5 million whereas Dr. Wijesekeras calculations came to
US$66 million. The difficulties of valuing the plantation are manifold. First,
there are various methodologies that may be used for the valuation. In this
case, however, both experts had used the discounted cash flow method. Even so,
deep discrepancies opened up between them over the factors to be taken into
account, and also the individual assessment of each of these factors vary
greatly. For example, Mr. Fernandez used a discount factor of 20% whereas Dr.
Wijesekara used a discount factor of 10%. Secondly, the quality of trees
planted, the infra-structure of the land, the quality of rubber produced and
manufactured, planting and production costs, and the future demand and price
of rubber have all to be taken into account. Plantations differ also in the
manner in which they are run, and in this regard, those in Sri Lanka are
acknowledged to be among some of the better run ones in the world. To complete
the picture, however, I find that the plantation in question appears to be a
well managed one. The wide, well tarred roads within the plantation shown in
the photographs produced at trial also give a fairly clear picture of this
impression.

12\. The first duty of the court is to satisfy itself that the person put
forward as an expert in his field is indeed one. In this case, Mr. Fernandez
and Dr. Wijesekera each holds an impressive list of paper certification and
experience. I need not recite the list save to say that their paper
credentials were not challenged. Mr. Wong made a vigorous submission that Mr.
Fernandez had "disqualified himself as an expert", but I am unable to agree
with that view. I think that Mr. Fernandezs words that he did not think
himself an expert was taken out of context. He clearly meant that he was not
an accountant by training as Dr. Wijesekara is. Mr. Fernandez is an expert in
estate valuation with particular experience in the valuation of rubber
plantations in Malaysia. Dr. Wijesekera is a chartered accountant by training,
but has experience in the valuation of rubber plantations in Sri Lanka. The
experts competency is, naturally, enhanced by the quantity and quality of his
research, and the study he undertakes. There is no special category of expert
known as the "valuation expert on rubber plantations". The persons appointed
to assist the court is a team consisting of an agronomist and an accountant.
There are, therefore, many routes to qualify as an expert in the valuation of
rubber plantations, and I have no difficulty in accepting Mr. Fernandez and
Mr. Wijesekara as experts in this field although they each have their
strengths and weaknesses. While Mr. Fernandez is familiar with the state of
rubber plantations and the rubber industry in Malaysia, Dr. Wijesekara is
familiar with that in Sri Lanka. There can be little doubt that the conditions
of this industry vary greatly in different countries and a sound knowledge of
what goes on in the country in question is important. Intimate knowledge of
details such as the fact and effect of the presence of squatters in the
vicinity of the plantation affect the valuation of yield, for instance. Mr.
Fernandez had made a site inspection of the plantation in question but Dr.
Wijesekara did not. Quite apart from the individual mannerism, style, and
personality of the witness which, in varying degree, may add to or detract
from the overall confidence the court may repose in his testimony, the
substance and quality of an experts evidence is best approached with the
summary of the duties and responsibilities of an expert, as set out by
Cresswell J in the _Ikarian Reefer_ [1993] 2 Lloyds rep 68, 81, firmly and
constantly in mind. I will here set out the relevant portion.

> "1. Expert evidence presented to the Court should be, and should be seen to

To these salutations, I need only add that in discharging his duty the expert
is required to make reasonable appraisement of reasonable factors. Often, he
cannot be proved right; and he must thus gain acceptance of his opinion by the
depth of his research, the soundness of his analysis and arguments, and the
honesty and impartiality in which he presents his views.

13\. The plantation in question is in Palembang, Sumatra. The clear evidence
shows that sometime in 1990 the parties (with PT Bumi Rambang Kramajaya)
acquired a site of some 10,000 hectares of land for the purposes of
establishing the plantation. However, according to Mr. Fernandezs report, this
portion of which I have no difficulty in accepting, only 2,133.22 hectares
have been planted with rubber trees with varying ages of three to nine years.
There is a plantable reserve of 3,586.63 hectares. Roads and buildings take up
384.90 hectares; while 1,204.84 hectares is swampland; and 3,140.42 hectares
were occupied by villagers.

14\. The various factors that were considered by the parties experts are
individually assessable and I, therefore, considered each item to determine
which of the two views, if they differ, is the more reasonable. I then take
into account the whole, and whether any factor had been omitted or required
adjustment. On that basis, I shall proceed as follows.

_

Date of Valuation

_

15\. Dr. Wijesekera used April 1998, the date of the order of court, as the
date of valuation whereas Mr. Fernandez used March 2000, which was the date he
commenced his valuation. In the absence of any agreement or indication by the
parties to the contrary, I am of the view that the date of valuation ought to
be the date of the order of court and find that the date for valuation should
be April 1998. Dr. Wijesekera took the period of valuation to be from 1990 to
2020 while Mr. Fernandez took the period as 1999 to 2029. In view of the lease
granted to the plantation to be 30 years, I am of the view that the proper
period should be from 1990 to 2020. It is noted that there is no dispute that
the field was first planted in 1990 and the year of commencement of production
was 1996.

_

Production Costs

_

16\. These would include the costs of tapping and collection; upkeep and
maintenance; and general charges. Dr. Wijesekera did not set out sufficiently
all his detailed assumptions in his report and evidence. Mr. Fernandez is of
the opinion that the costs would be Rp1,600 per kg; Rp300,000 per hectare; and
Rp300,000 per hectare respectively. I am of the view that the assessment of
the costs of tapping and collection to be on the high side and will therefore
adjust the figure to Rp700,000 per hectare.

_

Capital Expenditure

(a) Factory, Building And Installation

_

17\. Dr. Wijesekara presented figures from US$44,000 in 1990 to US$2.65
million in 2006 whereas Mr. Fernandez regarded the period from 1990 to 1994 as
irrelevant for consideration, and estimated Rp300 million for the period 2000
to 2004. In this regard, I am of the view that there should be no relevance
for the period 1990 to 1994 as capital for this period is part of sunk cost.
In respect of the period 2000 to 2004 I am content to accept Mr. Fernandezs
assessment of Rp300 million.

_

(b) Transportation, Equipment, Roads, And Bridges

_

18\. I agree with Mr. Fernandez that these costs are irrelevant for the period
1990 to 1997 as they are part of sunk cost, but some amount must be factored
for the period 1998 to 2004 and in this regard, I am of the view that the
figures estimated by Mr. Fernandez to be reasonable.

_

(c) Land Licence Fee

_

19\. I am of the view that the Land Licence Fee is not relevant for assessing
the fair value of the plantation as it is also a sunk cost in 1989/1990.

_

(d) Planting Cost And Planting Programme

_

20\. Dr. Wijesekeras estimate so far as the planting cost is concerned from
the first to fifth year is not supported by sufficient details, and I am of
the view that Mr. Fernandezs estimate to be reasonable. So far as the cost of
the planting programme from 1995 to 2008 is concerned, I am of the view that
Dr. Wijesekeras estimate to be a little high and, therefore, I accept Mr.
Fernandezs values in this regard.

_

Revenue

_

21\. There is a great measure of arbitrariness when it comes to assessing the
revenue from the plantation. Insofar as the actual revenues were not
available, I have used adjusted World Bank figures. From the year 2006 to
2009, I have used the simple average from the year 2005 to 2010 World Bank
prices. From 2011 to 2020 I have used the prices determined for the year 2010.
The rubber price in US Dollar per kg are set out in Appendix I to this
judgment. The average yield per hectare of planted area is set out in Appendix
II to this judgment.

_

Working Capital

_

22\. I have calculated the working capital simply by taking the average of the
figures used by Dr. Wijesekera (Mr. Fernandez did not provide any figures) as
being the fairest in the circumstances, and in the absence of hard evidence.

_

Residual Value

_

23\. Dr. Wijesekara valued the trees at US$3 each in his assessment of the
residual value. Thus, on the assumption of 2.6m tress, he worked out the
residual value as between US$7 to US$8 million. After consultation with my
assessors, I am of the view that this is grossly excessive. Although Dr.
Wijesekara may have adopted a "recognised formula" as Mr. Wong submitted, but
formulae are only feasibly applied if realistic figures are used. In this
regard, I am of the view that the residual value per tree shall be calculated
as between US$0.50 to US$0.60 for 400 hectares of trees.

_

Discount Factor

_

24\. This is by far the most significant factor. The discrepancy between Dr.
Wijesekeras 10% and Mr. Fernandezs 20% accounts for a large proportion of the
difference in valuation. Mr. Fernandez applied a discount rate of 10% to 15%
in his valuations of Malaysian plantations, but in his view, the financial and
economic factors in Indonesia differ from the case of plantations elsewhere.
Each plantation must be assessed on its own. In his study, Mr. Fernandez
reported that a discount rate of 23% had been used in an Indonesian
plantation. He had discussions with other ASEAN (Association of South East
Asian Nations) based plantation valuation experts in which the general opinion
was that a discount rate of 20% to 25% is fair so far as Indonesian
plantations are concerned. I note Mr. Wongs objection and criticism especially
when the other experts are not available for cross-examination. However, it is
accepted that an expert is entitled to take into account what would otherwise
be hearsay evidence because the nature of an experts function necessarily
prohibits any restraint on his research and methodology. In the end, it is the
testifying expert who must stand by his final report and be cross-examined on
it. There is virtually nothing in substance to support a discount rate of 10%
in respect of a plantation in Indonesia. I am more inclined towards Mr.
Fernandezs assessment but 20% may just be on the extreme end. I will,
therefore, adjust the rate down to 17%. This discount is arrived at after
taking into account the potential of developing the estate into a world class
plantation. This assumption has been made on largely speculative factors such
as the future production, costs, and revenue. The discount must also reflect
not only the track record but known uncertainties and circumstances, and the
assumption of marginal impact on prices. The subjectivity of applying the
discount rate may itself be a cause of concern to the potential investor, and
that is something that cannot be ignored. I am of the view that Dr.
Wijesekeras rate was much too conservative while Mr. Fernandezs was just a
little too extravagant.

_

Size Of plantation

_

25\. Ordinarily, the size of a plantation is purely a question of fact and is
answered easily enough. In this case, some confusion arose because there was
no evidence of a proper survey, and furthermore, some indirect and
unsubstantiated evidence as to the possibility of additional hectares being
acquired. I accept the evidence of the Izin Lokasi letters issued by the
Indonesian government in determining the size of the plantation land. The size
so determined is about 10,450 hectares.

_

Fair Value

_

26\. Having regard to all the above, I come to the finding that the fair value
of the plantation to be US$17.54 million, of which it must be noted that 40%
belongs to the Company and 10% to Mr. Tan Choo Suan.

_

Costs

_

27\. I will hear the parties on the question of costs at a later date if
parties are unable to agree costs between themselves.
