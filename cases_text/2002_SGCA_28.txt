Facts

Tong Tien See Construction Pte Ltd (‘TTSC’) was a major player in the building
construction industry. In 2000, TTSC was wound up on the ground of insolvency,
it being unable to pay its debts of some $53.3 million. The liquidator, after
examining the affairs of the company, came to the conclusion that the
directors had breached their fiduciary duties to the company and commenced
actions against the founder of the company, Tong Tien See (‘Tong’), some of
his family members, as well as associated companies and parties who had
wrongfully received assets from TTSC.

In the court below, the trial judge found that Tong, his wife (‘Koo’) and
daughter (‘Angela’) had breached their fiduciary duties. Not only had they
deceived TTSC’s creditors by manipulating the company’s accounts, the Tongs
also siphoned large sums of money for their personal benefit. Furthermore, the
evidence showed that they caused TTSC to transfer a total of $984,899.60 to
Caltong (Australia) Pty Ltd (‘Caltong’). With these funds, Caltong purchased
three properties in Australia, one of which was 70 Barker Road, Sydney. This
property was sold in 1999 for A$800,000. Koo’s sister, Sally, was Caltong’s
sole shareholder and director and despite her claim that one of her
properties, No. 17 Woodward Avenue ( the ‘Woodward property’), had nothing to
do with TTSC or its funds, the trial judge found that the property was bought
using proceeds from the sale of 70 Barker Road.

At the end of the trial, the trial judge ordered Tong, Koo and Angela to pay
TTSC $53.3 million in damages. He also held that they were constructive
trustees in respect of this sum of money and the properties bought by them
using the company’s funds. With regard to Caltong and Sally, the trial judge
declared that they were constructive trustees of the $984,899.60 which Caltong
received from TTSC as well as the Woodward property and the two Australian
properties owned by Caltong. Dissatisfied with the ruling against them,
Caltong and Sally appealed against the trial judge’s decision, arguing, _inter
alia_ , that Sally should not be personally liable to account for the
$984,899.60 and that the trial judge erred in declaring that Sally held the
Woodward property on trust for TTSC. TTSC also appealed, contending that the
trial judge erred in refusing to grant it the tracing orders that it sought
against the Tongs, Caltong and Sally.

Held

**, allowing both appeals in part:

> (1) Sally was not guilty of dishonest assistance or of knowing receipt vis--
> vis the sum remitted from TTSC to Caltong. As such, she should not be held
> to be personally liable for this sum. To be liable for knowing receipt,
> three elements must be proved. First, the plaintiff must show a disposal of

>
> (2) The elements which must be proved to establish dishonest assistance are
> (a) that there has been a disposal of assets in breach of trust or fiduciary

> (c) the defendant acted dishonestly; and (d) resulting loss to the claimant;

Per Curiam

**

A party may be liable to another for damages on account of a tort the former
had committed, but that does not render that party a constructive trustee of
the same. It remains a personal debt (see 27).

**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. These two related appeals arise from a decision of the High Court in an
action instituted by the liquidator of a company, Tong Tien See Construction
Pte Ltd ((TTSC), against primarily its former directors and shareholders for
conspiracy, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duties, and for the necessary
reliefs. At the conclusion of the trial, judgment and various reliefs were
granted in favour of TTSC. However, the High Court refused to grant a tracing
order to TTSC and this formed the subject matter of the appeal by TTSC in CA
600130/2001.

2\. Some of the orders made in favour of TTSC were against Caltong (Australia)
Pty Ltd (Caltong) and Wei Fong Rasiah, Sally (Sally), the 8th and 12th
defendants respectively in the action below. Both Caltong and Sally have
appealed against the orders on the ground that their scope is too wide.

**

  
The facts

**

3\. TTSC was in the building construction business. It was a major player in
the industry, having attained the highest grade (G8) under the HDB ranking
system for building contractors. It was a family owned company, started by the
patriach Tong Tien See (Tong), the first defendant. It was initially a sole-
proprietorship and was converted into a private limited company in 1985. Tong
controlled TTSC with the help of his wife, Koo Yoke Fong (Koo), the second
defendant, and a daughter, Tong Hui Chee, Angela (Angela), the third
defendant.

4\. On 26 May 2000, TTSC was wound up on the ground of insolvency, it being
unable to pay its debts amounting to some $53.3 million. In fact, earlier, on
2 March 2000, TTSC was placed under interim judicial management.

5\. The liquidator, having examined the affairs of the company, came to the
conclusion that breaches of fiduciary duties had occurred on the part of the
directors, among others, which included the improper disposal of the assets of
the company. He also discovered that TTSC was, in fact, insolvent from the
financial year 1995/96. What happened was that in order to maintain the "G8"
status of TTSC, a hallmark of credit worthiness which required TTSC to have a
net worth of $5 million, a scheme was hatched by Tong and others. This
involved transferring losses of TTSC to an affiliated company, Tong Joo Aik
Construction Pte Ltd (Tong Joo), the sixth defendant, by the raising of sham
bills over a period of some years, amounting in total to about $25 million.

6\. As part of the scheme to siphon money from TTSC, bills were also raised by
Tong Joo to TTSC to enable large sums of money to be transferred from TTSC to
Tong Joo. It should be noted that Tong Joo did not carry out any business of
its own other than being so made used of. The moneys of TTSC received by Tong
Joo were used by Tong and Koo to purchase residential properties under their
personal names.

7\. Tong and Koo also transferred in total a sum of some $194 million from
TTSC and placed them on interest bearing accounts, with Tong and Koo keeping
the interest earned and returning only the capital sums to TTSC. Even after
the winding up order was made, Tong withdrew a total of $482,000 from TTSC for
his own personal use.

8\. One of the properties which Tong bought with monies from TTSC was a plot
of land at No. 4 Kew Drive. It was subsequently subdivided into four plots
where four new houses were constructed and they were later known as Nos 4 and
4A Kew Drive and Nos 755 and 757 Upper East Coast Road. These four properties
were registered in the names of Koo and Angela. The building costs were funded
from a loan from OCBC Bank but the interest due was paid by Tong Joo, using
funds from TTSC.

9\. Between 1996 and 2000, TTSC’s funds of up to $3.7 million were utilized by
Tong, Koo and Angela (‘the Tongs’ where appropriate) for their personal
benefit. The Tongs also bought holiday homes in Perth and Sydney.

10\. Thirteen persons were identified by the liquidator as having dealt with
or received moneys from TTSC and were made defendants to the action. They
were:-

> **First defendant** | – Tong Tien See (Tong)  
> ---|---  
> **Second defendant** | – Koo Yoke Fong (Koo), the wife of Tong. While she was never formally appointed a director of TTSC, she was effectively the number two person in the company, next to Tong. She was a _de facto_ director.  
> **Third defendant** | ****– Tong Hui Chee, Angela (Angela), the second daughter of Tong and Koo. She is an accountant by profession and was very much involved in the affairs of TTSC.  
> **Fourth defendant** | – Koo Say Hee, Raymond (Raymond), a younger brother of Koo. He was the Deputy Managing Director of TTSC and took care of things at work sites.  
> **Fifth defendant** | \- Chia Siew Keng (Chia), a director of TTSC. She started work with Tong in 1975 when TTSC was a sole proprietorship. She resigned from TTSC in March 2000.  
> **Sixth defendant** | – Tong Joo Aik Construction Pte Ltd (Tong Joo), an affiliated company of TSSC. It has also become insolvent.   
> **Seventh defendant** | – Tong Development Pte Ltd (TDPL), another affiliated company of TTSC, being wholly owned by Tong Joo.  
> **Eighth defendant** | \- Caltong (Australia) Pty Ltd (Caltong), another affiliated company incorporated in Australia. It was an investment company set up by Tong, Koo and Angela.  
> **Ninth defendant** | – Tong Hui Li Linda (Linda), the eldest daughter of Tong and Koo. She was a director and shareholder of Tong Joo and a director of TDPL.  
> **Tenth defendant** | – Tong Hui Chuen, Carol (Carol), the third daughter of Tong and Koo. She was a director of Tong Joo.  
> **Eleventh defendant** | – Tong Hui Fung, Cindy (Cindy), the**** fourth daughter of Tong and Koo. She became a director of TTSC only in February 2000.  
> **Twelveth defendant** | – Wei Fong Rasiah, Sally (Sally), the younger sister of Koo. She is an Australian citizen. She and her husband operated two McDonald’s restaurants in Sydney.  
> **Thirteen defendant** | – Lee Han Chye Alvin (Alvin), the husband of Angela, the third defendant.  
  
**

** 11\. Before the commencement of the trial below, Tong was, on 23 February
2001, adjudicated a bankrupt. Earlier, in the beginning of 2000, after having
sold their properties here, Tong, his wife and daughters, Angela and Carol,
moved south to settle in Australia.

12\. The evidence showed that by 1998, because of the way Tong and Koo had
been fiddling with the accounts and moneys of TTSC (treating its moneys very
much as their own), TTSC was no longer able to meet its commitments to its
sub-contractors. As a result, supplies and services needed for TTSC projects
were disrupted because payments due to the sub-contractors were not made. On
account of the manipulations, TTSC was able to maintain its G8 status and
continue to receive big construction contracts. As a result, sub-contractors
were deluded into contractual arrangements with TTSC.

13\. TDPL was a housing developer, and had borrowed various sums of money from
TTSC for its business. Repayments of the loans were made from time to time but
as at the date of liquidation of TTSC, TDPL was owing the former some $1.5
million. Between 1995 and 2000, Tong Joo had also transferred about $8.66
million to TDPL.

14\. From November 1994 to April 1997, TTSC transferred a total of $984,899.60
to Caltong. By a directors’ resolution of TTSC, the debt was switched from
Caltong to Tong. With the funds, Caltong purchased two properties in Australia
– 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney and The Stamford, 5256 Goderich Street, Perth. A
third property, 70 Barker Road, Sydney, was also bought by Caltong but sold in
1999 for A$800,000. Until November 1998, the first three defendants, Tong, Koo
and Angela, held 1/3 share each in Caltong. Thereafter, Sally became the sole
shareholder and in November 1999, the sole director.

15\. Sally and her husband owned several properties in Australia. One property
which was of concern to the present action was No. 17 Woodward Avenue
(Woodward property), which was a rather large house, purchased by Sally in
March 2000 in her sole name at a price of A$1.47 million. She claimed that to
purchase that property she borrowed A$670,000 from Tong and the remainder came
from the resources of herself and her husband. However, some months after the
purchase, the property was mortgaged for A$800,000. The evidence pointed to
the fact that Sally bought this rather large house because Tong and Koo and
their family were coming over to live in Australia. That was the finding of
the judge below although Sally claimed that the house had nothing to do with
TTSC or its funds. She said she rented it out to the Tongs but there was no
fixed rental.

16\. As for Alvin, he worked full time as a fuel oil broker earning a
substantial salary of $12,000. He and Angela lived with her parents at 2 Kew
Drive until 755 East Coast Road (No. 755) was completed. He bought over No.
755 from Koo and Angela for $1.7 million, using $170,000 from his CPF and
$340,000 in cash and the rest, $1.19 million, came from a bank loan. Of the
$340,000 in cash, $230,000 was a three-year interest free loan which he
obtained from one Peggy Koo, the youngest sister of Koo (the second
defendant). The records indicated that the 10% due on the exercise of the
option to purchase No. 755 was never paid, though eventually the full purchase
price was paid.

**

  
Findings of trial judge

**

17\. For several years prior to the winding up of TTSC, no formal Annual
General Meetings or Directors’ Meetings were held. Raymond and Chia would sign
whatever documents were placed under their noses by the first three
defendants. The trial judge did not make Raymond and Chia accountable for the
wrongdoings in relation to the disposal of the assets of TTSC because he felt
that they were under considerable duress. The judge also did not make any
order against Linda, Carol and Cindy, the three daughters of Tong because they
were not really involved in the day-to-day running of TTSC, Tong Joo or TDPL.

18\. The judge held that the real culprits of the entire scheme were Tong, Koo
and Angela. They had, knowingly, carried on the business of TTSC with intent
to defraud its creditors. He held them to be personally liable pursuant to s
340 of the Companies Act without any limitation of liability for all the debts
of TTSC.

19\. We have earlier mentioned four houses being erected on No 4 Kew Drive.
One of the four houses, No. 757 Upper East Coast Road, was sold by Koo and
Angela in July 1996, reaping a profit of $501,000. In January 2000, the
remaining 3 houses were purportedly sold to Tong Joo at 10% above valuation,
with a view to reducing Tong and Koo’s indebtedness to Tong Joo. Although this
transaction was recorded in the books of Tong Joo, Koo and Angela remained the
owners of the three properties. Indeed, the property at No. 755 was sold to
Alvin.

20\. Interestingly, to support the application for judicial management, the
three properties, Nos 4 and 4A Kew Drive and No. 755, together with No 2 Kew
Drive (the residence of Tong and Koo), an Ocean Park apartment (bought by Tong
in 1990), and the balance of sale proceeds of the Eastwood Lodge developed by
TDPL, were treated as assets of TTSC in the computation of dividends payable
to unsecured creditors. It was anticipated that the balance of the sale
proceeds of the Eastwood Lodge development would be some $1.024 million. There
was no record as to what happened to this sum.

21\. As TTSC’s funds were used to develop the four houses on No. 4 Kew Drive
and the Eastwood Lodge, the court held that TTSC would have an interest in
them or their proceeds of sale.

22\. As for the Woodward property, the judge found it was bought by Sally as
Tong and Koo were then about to migrate to Australia and needed a large house.
The funds for the purchase came from the proceeds of sale of 70 Barker Road
(see 14 above). The judge did not believe that Sally bought the Woodward
property for her own purposes because, _inter alia_ -

> If (Koo) did not have enough funds to purchase a larger house, it was indeed
> strange that her husband (Tong) could then give (Sally) a loan of A$670,000
> for the purchase of 17 Woodward Ave. Further, this was the only property in
> her sole name, unlike others which she had purchased earlier with her
> husband. Being so highly geared financially already, what was her purpose in
> purchasing such a large house at S$1.47 million?

23\. In reaching this conclusion, the judge also drew an adverse inference
against Sally on account of her reluctance to produce the records of Caltong.
He viewed the alleged burglary and vandalisation of her accountant’s office in
Australia (see 41 below) as mere excuses to avoid having to produce Caltong’s
records.

24\. However, as regards the sale of No. 755 to Alvin, the judge found that
the disposal was not made with an "intention to defraud creditors". Moreover,
the sale was at a price approved by the mortgagee, OCBC Bank. In any case, it
would be unjust, in all the circumstances, to invalidate the transaction, as
Alvin had borrowed from the bank and taken money from his CPF account to pay
for the property.

25\. In the light of the above, the judge made, _inter alia_ , the following
orders:-

> (i) that Tong, Koo and Angela repay the sum of $53.3 million as damages on
> the ground that (a) they were guilty of conspiracy to injure by unlawful
> means and (b) that they were in breach of their fiduciary duties to TTSC.
>
> (ii) that on account thereof they were constructive trustees in respect of
> the said sum.
>
> (iii) that Tong, Koo and Angela held the four properties developed on No. 4
> Kew Drive in trust for TTSC and they were to account for the use of these
> assets.
>
> (iv) Caltong and Sally were constructive trustees in respect of the sum
> $984,899.60 received from TTSC and were to account for the same and were
> also constructive trustees in respect of the following properties.

> > (a) No. 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;
>>

>> (b) Stamford Apartment, Goderich Street, Perth;

> > (c) No. 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney.

**

  
Appeal of Caltong and Sally

**

26\. We will first consider the appeal of Caltong and Sally. In order to
determine whether the orders made against them are or are not too wide, it is
necessary that we set out their precise terms:-

> "The Eighth and Twelfth Defendants are –

> (i) To hold the sum of S$984,899.60 paid by the Plaintiff as constructive
> trustees for the Plaintiff;
>
> (2) To account to the Plaintiff for the sum of S$984,899.60, including:

> > (a) the use of such monies (which includes details of to whom such monies
> were paid, when such monies were paid, the quantum of payment and reasons
> for payment);
>>

>> (b) all properties and/or benefits and/or assets obtained from the use of
such monies;

> (3) To pay to the Plaintiff monies, and all profits and/or benefits and/or
> assets, including simple interest;
>
> (4) To hold the following properties as constructive trustees for the
> Plaintiff:

> > (a) 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;
>>

>> (b) Stamford Apartment, Perth; and

>>

>> (c) 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney.

> …

(3) The Twelfth Defendant do pay to the Plaintiff 25% of the Plaintiff’s costs
in these proceedings …"

27\. At this juncture, we would like to make this observation. The judge
seemed to think that on account of the damages which Tong, Koo and Angela were
required to pay TTSC because of their conspiracy, Tong, Koo and Angela were
thereby rendered constructive trustees of the same. A party may be liable to
another for damages on account of a tort the former had committed, but that
does not render that party a constructive trustee of the same. It remains a
personal debt.

28\. We would comment that while the appeal is taken by both Caltong and
Sally, it is really an appeal by Sally. It was never disputed that Caltong
received the sum of S$984,899.60 from TTSC. Sally’s contention is that as she
was in control of Caltong only after November 1999, when she became the sole
director, she should not be made to account for events before that. The sum
never passed through her hands. There was no reason to make her personally
liable. Furthermore, the Woodward property had nothing to do with Caltong. She
also contends that the order on costs requiring her to bear 25% of the action
is excessive and unreasonable.

29\. What Sally is basically arguing is that until she became the sole
director, she was really only a nominee director of Caltong. She did not know
what was happening there, which was effectively being managed by Tong and
Angela, particularly the latter. She did not touch the sum of S$984,899.60
which came into the account of Caltong. This aspect of the matter did not
appear to have been specifically addressed by the judge below. He did not find
that when the money was received by Caltong, Sally knew that the money was
remitted by Tong in breach of trust. Neither did he find her guilty of
dishonest assistance.

30\. While the knowledge of Tong and Angela may be imputed to Caltong (see _HL
Bolton (Engineering) Co Ltd v T.T Graham & Sons Ltd_ [1957] 1 QB 159), they
being the controlling mind of Caltong, there is no evidence to indicate that
Sally knew that the money received by Caltong from Tong was improperly
siphoned off from TTSC. There is also nothing to suggest that Sally
dishonestly assisted the Tongs in siphoning money from TTSC.

31\. To be liable for knowing receipt which would render the recepient a
constructive trustee, three elements must be proved, and in the words of Lord
Hoffman in _El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings_ [1994] BCLC 464:-

> "the plaintiff must show, first a disposal of his assets in breach of
> fiduciary duty; secondly, the beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets
> which are traceable as representing the assets of the plaintiff; and,
> thirdly, knowledge on the part of the defendant that the assets he received
> are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty."

What were missing in relation to Sally are the second and third elements. She
did not receive the money. Neither was it shown that she knew the money
received by Caltong was tainted. Thus, she could not be liable under the
principle of knowing receipt, even though Caltong, by virtue of the knowledge
of Tong and Angela, would be liable to account for knowing receipt.

32\. The fact that she agreed to be a nominee director in Caltong did not mean
that she had assisted the Tongs in committing a breach of fiduciary duty
towards TTSC. Sally’s duty as a director (though nominee), was to Caltong, not
to TTSC. The case _Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Craddock (No. 3)_
[1968] 2 All ER 1073 merely established the principle that just because a
person was a nominee director, it did not mean that he did not owe a duty of
care to the company of which he was a director.

33\. The elements which must be proved to establish dishonest assistance are
(see _Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan_[1995] 2 AC 378):-

> (a) that there has been a disposal of his assets in breach of trust or
> fiduciary duty;
>
> (b) in which the defendant has assisted or which she/he has procured;
>
> (c) the defendant has acted dishonestly;
>
> (d) resulting loss to the claimant.

34\. There is no evidence that Sally had dishonestly assisted Tong, Koo or
Angela in siphoning off the funds of TTSC to Caltong. In fact, she played no
role in remitting TTSC’s moneys to Caltong. She was merely a nominee director
of Caltong.

35\. This association _per se_ could not mean that she would also know what
was done by the Tongs as far as siphoning of TTSC’s moneys to Caltong was
concerned. In short, there was nothing to implicate Sally to the wrongdoings
of the Tongs.

36\. Accordingly, Sally could not be guilty of dishonest assistance or of
knowing receipt that the sum was remitted from TTSC to Caltong in breach of
trust. She should not be held to be personally liable. To this extent, the
order made by the court below would have to be modified.

**

  
Woodward property

**

37\. We now turn to the Woodward property, which Sally says the court was
wrong to have declared that she held it on trust for TTSC. She argues that
TTSC had not pleaded anything with regard to this property. The pleadings only
touched on the S$984,899.60 received by Caltong from TTSC. Therefore, she did
not allude to this property, or on how she acquired it, in her affidavit.
While this may be so, there is considerable weight in the counter-argument of
TTSC that it did not so plead because it only became apparent in the cross-
examination of Sally that the Woodward property had been purchased with moneys
which originated from TTSC. This also explains why, when Tong and Koo were
giving evidence, they were not cross-examined by TTSC on this aspect. In any
case, during the cross-examination of Sally, TTSC gave notice that it was
claiming the property as trust property. She was cross-examined on it.

38\. Moreover, TTSC had also pleaded that it would claim against any assets
which were purchased with the S$984,899.60 or their proceeds. That should
suffice to notify Sally that a tracing was being asked for. It would have been
easy for Sally to show, from the bank records of Caltong, that none of the
moneys of Caltong were used to purchase the Woodward property. It would also
have been a matter within her knowledge as to the sources of funds which she
had utilized to effect the purchase.

39\. The judge below came to the conclusion that the sale proceeds of 70
Barker Road, which was one of the properties purchased by Caltong from the
$984.899.60 remitted by TTSC/Tong, were probably used to purchase the Woodward
property. Among the factors which the judge took into account in deciding this
question were - (i) the Barker Road property was sold in September 1999 for
about A$800,000; (ii) the Woodward property was bought at a time when the Tong
family was moving to live in Australia and required a large home; (iii) it was
the only property bought in Sally’s sole name whereas her other properties
were in the joint names of herself and her husband; (iv) after the purchase,
the Tongs were living there allegedly as tenants; (v) it was strange that Tong
was able and would lend to Sally a sum of A$670,000 to purchase the property
when Tong did not have enough money to buy his own house; (vi) there was no
reason why Sally should buy this large house with borrowed money when she was
already owing substantial loans in respect of her other properties.

40\. While an explanation was offered by Sally in respect of each of these
points, they were not sufficiently persuasive to the judge. This being a
finding of fact, there is hardly any sufficient basis for us to overturn this
finding. Indeed, we agree with it. We would add that in making this finding
the judge also took into account Sally’s conduct at the trial.

41\. As stated above, the Barker Road property was sold for some A$800,000. It
would have been a straightforward matter to show where the proceeds had gone.
Yet, there was considerable reluctance to disclose the bank records of
Caltong. They were eventually not produced because of an "alleged" burglary at
Caltong’s accountant’s office and the records were reportedly lost as a
result. The judge felt it was too much of a coincidence. On 2 May 2001 he made
the order requiring Sally to disclose the records by 8 May 2001. It was on 8
May 2001 that Caltong’s counsel informed the court of the "burglary" which
occurred on 4 May 2001. Counsel could not give further details. Interestingly,
Tong’s evidence was that the proceeds of the Barker Road property were spent
on "living expenses" during the period of some six months from September 1999
to March 2000. Bearing in mind their financial circumstances then, it
certainly seemed like a very tall story, squandering such a large sum in such
a short time.

42\. In cross-examination, Sally said that matters relating to the financing
of the purchase of the Woodward property were handled by her husband, Thava.
In the circumstances, she asserted that TTSC should have called Thava to
clarify those matters. Yet it did not do so. Accordingly, Sally submits that
TTSC is precluded from contending otherwise now. But it is important to note
that Thava did not say anything on this in his affidavit at all. What he did
state was not disputed by TTSC. If indeed Thava did possess the relevant
information as Sally had asserted, then the information should have been set
out in a supplemental affidavit of Thava. This is a matter exclusively within
her knowledge. She must go further and get that person to depose to those
facts. This issue has nothing to do with the principle in _Browne v
Dunn_[1893] 6 R 67, which precludes a party from asserting otherwise if he
fails to cross-examine a witness as to what the latter stated in his affidavit
or in his evidence-in-chief.

43\. There is another aspect which cast doubts on the credibility of Sally.
Caltong’s counsel tendered to court its tax returns and balance sheets
relating to the years 1995-1999. On these documents, Caltong’s name appeared
on the tax assessments in respect of those years. But Caltong only took this
name on 24 January 2000\. Previously, it was known as "Tong Tien See
(Australia) Pty Ltd". Similarly the documents also bore the new address of
Caltong’s accountants but the accountants only moved to their new offices in
2000 or 2001. Sally was not able to explain these discrepancies. Thus, there
was the suggestion that perhaps Sally fabricated these documents.

44\. Ordinarily, when a trustee mixes trust funds with his own funds, the law
assumes that the whole is subject to the trust. In _Frith v Cartland_ (1865)
71 ER 525 at 526, Page Wood VC observed: "… if a man mixes trust funds with
his own, the whole will be treated as the trust property, except so far as he
may be able to distinguish what is his own." See also _Re Tilley’s Will Trust_
[1967] Ch 1179 at 1182.

45\. However, in the present case, while there is no direct evidence to show
that, in using the proceeds of the Barker Road property to buy the Woodward
property, Sally knew that the proceeds were tainted, we nevertheless find, on
balance, that she did have the knowledge. First, she denied having used the
proceeds of the Barker Road property to purchase the Woodward property.
Second, unlike all her other properties, she purchased the Woodward property
in her sole name. Thirdly, she submits tax documents to court which appeared
to be fake and she was unable to explain the clear discrepancies (see 43
above). Fourthly, her reluctance to produce the records of Caltong. All these
indicate a guilty mind. Thus, it appears to us that she had knowingly mixed
trust money with her own when purchasing the Woodward property. The burden was
on her to show which portion of the purchase price came from her own sources
and was not tainted by the breach of trust committed by Tong and Angela.
However, having regard to the nature of the pleadings, and the manner in which
the trial had proceeded in the court below, it would probably be fairer if an
opportunity be afforded to Sally to show the extent to which she and/or her
husband had contributed (from their own funds) to the purchase of the Woodward
property.

46\. The final point raised by Sally relates to the order on costs. She says
that even if she were to fail in this appeal, the 25% costs awarded against
her for the trial is plainly excessive as the points she raised would probably
have taken only two days to hear. She submits that her role in the whole
matter was minor, whereas the trial took a total of 39 days.

47\. From the grounds of judgment, it is clear that in arriving at its
decision on costs, the court below did give careful consideration to Sally’s
contention that costs awarded against her should be limited. The question of
costs is a matter of discretion. It has not been shown that the judge had
erred. The court is entitled to take all the circumstances into account, in
determining the appropriate apportionment as to costs. But whether this order
on costs should be varied, in the light that this appeal would, for the
reasons indicated above, be allowed in part, will be dealt with later.

**

  
TTSC’s appeal on tracing

**

48\. Although the appeal by TTSC would affect Tong, Koo, Angela, Tong Joo,
TDPL and Caltong, only Caltong is defending it as the other parties are either
bankrupt or are being wound up.

49\. A preliminary point was raised by Caltong that TTSC cannot proceed with
this appeal against Tong and Angela without the leave of court as required
under s 76(1)(c)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act as they are both bankrupt:-

> "no action or proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the
> bankrupt, except by leave of the court and in accordance with such terms as
> the court may impose."

50\. Quite apart from the question whether Caltong has the _locus standi_ to
raise this point on behalf of Tong and Angela, there is really nothing in the
point as leave of court to commence the action against Tong and Angela had
already been obtained prior to the trial. Caltong seems to be arguing that
leave of court is required at every stage, the trial stage as well as the
appeal stage, and that an appeal is no doubt a "proceeding" within s
76(1)(c)(ii).

51\. This court had in _Overseas Union Bank v Lew Keh Lam_ [1999] 3 SLR 393
stated that the purpose of s 76(1)(c)(ii) was to prevent the liquidators or
administrator’s task from being made more difficult due to a scramble among
creditors in taking action or obtaining decrees against the debtor or his
assets. The requirement to obtain leave is to ensure that the court could
guard against any inequity on account of such a scramble. It must follow that
once leave is obtained to commence an action against a bankrupt debtor, that
leave should hold good until the final determination of the proceeding,
including any appeal. There is really no good reason why leave should be
obtained at every stage.

52\. With respect, we think counsel for Caltong has misconstrued _Lew Keh
Lam_. In that case there was an application to strike out the creditor’s
appeal on the ground that the creditor had failed to obtain the requisite
leave. This Court ruled that leave was required but granted retrospective
leave. But that case is no authority for the proposition that you need leave
for the action at the trial and you need leave again for any appeal therefrom.
The significant aspect of that case which must be borne in mind is that there
the bankrupt was so adjudicated only after the trial. An appeal was pending.
Obviously, an appeal is a "proceeding" and leave must be obtained if
bankruptcy intervenes.

53\. Turning next to the substantive issue, it should be noted at the outset
that "tracing", as pointed out by Lord Millett in _Foskett v McKeown_ [2000] 3
All ER 97, is really a process rather than a remedy. It enables a plaintiff to
trace what has happened to his property, identify the persons who have handled
or received it and justify his claim that the assets/property which they
handled or received can properly be regarded as representing the plaintiff’s
property. It also seeks to identify which new asset is the substitute for the
old or the traceable proceeds of the plaintiff’s property and enables the
plaintiff to substitute the traceable proceeds for the original asset as the
subject matter of his claim. Thus, normally tracing is the precursor to a
claim.

54\. It is true that perhaps TTSC should have first only asked for a
declaration of a breach of trust and a tracing order against Caltong and the
other defendants before proceeding to ask the court for a declaration of
constructive trust in relation to specific properties. In this case, while the
court below accepted that there were breaches of trust and made declarations
of constructive trusts against some of the defendants, it nevertheless refused
to grant any tracing orders. It gave three reasons. First, there would be
great difficulties involved in identifying the sources of funds and the way
they were used or rolled over. Second, the proceedings would be unnecessarily
prolonged. Third, tracing orders would be unnecessary in the light of the
orders to account which the court had made.

55\. The main ground advanced by TTSC in asking for a tracing order is to
identify and establish potential proprietary claims that may exist. When a
constructive trust is imposed due to a breach of fiduciary duties, the
beneficiary is entitled to elect between an _in personam_ action against the
errant fiduciaries and/or a proprietary action to claim the property or its
traceable proceeds. Again, in the words of Lord Millett in _Foskett v McKeown_
(supra) at 119 "A beneficiary of a trust is entitled to a continuing
beneficial interest not merely in the trust property but in its traceable
proceeds also, and his interest binds every one who takes the property or its
traceable proceeds, except a _bona fide_ purchaser for value without notice."

56\. Bearing in mind that the key individuals and the companies involved in
the conspiracy in the present case are either bankrupt or wound up, an _in
personam_ action would not be of much assistance. If a proprietary claim could
be established, then TTSC would be able to claim the assets from an indefinite
class of persons, rather than just the trustees who, in the present case,
would not be able to compensate TTSC for its losses.

57\. As far as Caltong is concerned, it contends that a tracing order would
not be appropriate as neither the moneys to be traced nor the traceable
proceeds have been identified. It is clear that for a tracing order to
operate, the assets (either of physical property or moneys) for a tracing
process to begin must be identified. It is plain logic that one can only trace
from a specific thing, be it a specific property or a sum of money, otherwise
it would be impossible to begin. It is not at all necessary to identify
traceable proceeds, as that is the very object of a tracing exercise, to
establish into what form the original assets have been converted. It is, in
our judgment, incorrect to suggest, as Caltong does, that the traceable
proceeds must first be identified before a tracing order may be made. If that
were so, it would turn logic on its head as that is the very object of a
tracing order. Of course, a tracing order would not necessarily lead to a
proprietary claim. For example, if a particular asset has gone into the hands
of a _bona fide_ purchaser for value without notice of the breach, then in so
far as that asset is concerned, the tracing must end, and no claim may be made
by the beneficiary against that _bona fide_ purchaser: per Megarry V-C in _Re
Montagu’s Settlement Trusts_[1987] Ch 264 at 276

58\. The court is entitled to take all the circumstances of a case into
account in determining whether a tracing order should be granted. It is true
that in one of the prayers, TTSC asked for an -

> "order that the plaintiff is entitled to trace the monies (which are held in
> trust for it by the various respondents) into the hands of the (respondents)
> or elsewhere."

It did not ask the court to compel a party to do or refrain from doing
something. While this prayer may be inadequately formulated, this should not
preclude a court from granting an appropriate tracing order if the case
warrants it. As mentioned before, the court below refused to grant a tracing
order not because the pleadings were inadequate (54).

59\. The first ground indicated by the judge in refusing to grant a tracing
order is certainly pertinent in relation to the breaches committed by the
Tongs. There would be great difficulties in identifying the specific sums from
which tracing is to be initiated. The sum of $53.3 million for which Tong, Koo
and Angela were held to be accountable represented the total amount of the
creditors’ claims against TTSC. This is the total of the debts owing by TTSC
to its creditors. It may not represent the net total sum which the Tongs had
siphoned off from TTSC. What was siphoned off could have been more or it could
have been less. Bearing in mind the numerous transactions which would have
taken place between TTSC and these three defendants and Tong Joo and TDPL, a
tracing exercise would be an extremely daunting, if not an impossible, one. It
would not be in order to make a tracing order based on the $53.3 million which
is owing to creditors.

60\. However, the same is not so with regard to the sum $984,899.60 which was
admittedly received by Caltong from Tong/TTSC. While we recognise that this
sum was not received in one remittance, it is the starting point from which
tracing may be made. Obviously when tracing is carried out, proceedings will
be extended. That is inevitable.

61\. Then, there is the third reason given by the judge. He felt that a
tracing order is unnecessary in view of the order made requiring Caltong to
account. In a sense an order to account is similar to that of a tracing order:
see _Khan v Khan_ [1982] 2 All ER 60. But an order to account is personal in
nature, binding on the party named. An appropriate tracing order, on the other
hand, could compel third parties, such as a bank, to assist. In relation to
Caltong, a tracing order might well serve a purpose as Caltong has not been
very cooperative in disclosing its records.

62\. It is also true that a tracing order would also mean the incurring of
further costs. But this is unavoidable. Who, ultimately, would have to bear
the additional costs would depend on the outcome of the exercise. If the
tracing leads to a dead end then TTSC would have to bear the costs. But if the
exercise should lead to a third party or lead back to Caltong (because it
withheld information) then the additional costs would have to be borne by the
latter.

Judgment

**

63\. Accordingly, the appeal in CA 600130/2001 is allowed to the extent that
Sally is not to be held personally liable to return the $984,899.60.

64\. The appeal in CA 600124/2001 is also allowed to the extent that a tracing
order shall be made in respect of the sum $984,899.60 received by Caltong.

65\. Paragraph 4 of the order made by the court below on 17 September 2001
shall be amended to read as follows:-

> "The eighth defendant and the twelfth defendant, in her capacity as the
> director of the eighth defendant, are –

> (1) To hold the sum of S$984,899.60 paid by the Plaintiff as constructive
> trustees for the Plaintiff;
>
> (2) To account to the Plaintiff for the sum of S$984,899.60, including:

> > (a) the use of such monies (which includes details of to whom such monies
> were paid, when such monies were paid, the quantum of payment and reasons
> for payment);
>>

>> (b) all properties and/or benefits and/or assets obtained from the use of
such monies;

> (3) To pay to the Plaintiff monies, and all profits and/or benefits and/or
> assets, including simple interest;
>
> (4) To hold the following properties as constructive trustees for the
> Plaintiff:

> > (a) 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;
>>

>> (b) Stamford Apartment, Perth; and

>>

>> (c) 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney, except in relation to the part represented
by the portion of the purchase price which was paid from sources of the
twelfth defendant and/or her husband as may be established by her.

>
> There shall be an inquiry to trace the assets or proceeds into which the sum
> $984,899.60 received by Caltong had been converted, with liberty to apply to
> the court below."

66\. As regards the question of costs of the two appeals, they ought to be
approached separately. In respect of CA 600130/2001, Sally, the twelfth
defendant, has succeeded in part in the sense that she is not to be personally
liable for the $984,899.60. She, however, failed as regards her contention
that the Woodward property is entirely her personal property and has nothing
to do with Caltong or the sum of $984,899.60 received by Caltong from
TTSC/Tong. She shall, therefore, be entitled to only half the costs of this
appeal. The security for costs, with any accrued interest, shall be refunded
to the twelfth defendant or her solicitors.

67\. Turning to CA 600124/2001, TTSC succeeded against Caltong to the extent
that a tracing order is granted herein in respect of the sum $984,899.60
received by Caltong. TTSC shall have the costs of the appeal against Caltong.
Sally is, in no way, involved in that, other than as a director of Caltong.
The security for costs, together with any accrued interest, shall be refunded
to TTSC or its solicitors.

68\. As regards the order for costs at the trial, the question is whether it
ought to be modified in the light of the decisions in these appeals. It is
true that by virtue of our decision in CA 600130/2001, Sally is no longer
personally liable in respect of the sum $984,899.60 received by Caltong. The
receipt by Caltong of that sum was never in dispute. But she should
nevertheless bear the costs in relation to the issue concerning the Woodward
property. Taking a broad view of things, we would reduce the proportion of the
costs to be borne by the twelfth defendant personally to 15%.
