Appellate Division of the High Court — Civil Appeal No 81 of 2021  
Quentin Loh JAD, Chua Lee Ming J  
10 February 2022

1 April 2022 Judgment reserved.

Quentin Loh JAD (delivering the judgment of the court):

Background facts

1 Mr Lau Keuk Ling William Ignatius, the “appellant”, being dissatisfied with
the quantum of damages awarded to him below, appeals against the various
aspects of the damages awarded or disallowed by the learned trial judge (the
“Judge”) in Lau Keuk Ling William Ignatius v Chan Chun Sheng Gary [2021] SGHC
184 (the “Judgment”).

2 The appellant was injured in a road traffic accident on 14 February 2017
when a car, driven by Mr Chan Chun Sheng Gary (the “respondent”) at high
speed, collided into the rear of the appellant’s stationary car. This caused
the appellant’s car to collide into the rear of the stationary lorry in front;
both these vehicles were at a traffic light-controlled junction awaiting the
green light. The appellant suffered, inter alia, neck and head injuries.

3 The respondent failed to cooperate with his motor insurer, NTUC Income
Cooperative Limited, or take any part in the proceedings. On 11 July 2019,
interlocutory judgment was entered with damages to be assessed. The
respondent’s insurer, repudiated liability to indemnify the respondent but
nonetheless intervened in the action (the “intervener”) as it was liable to
satisfy any judgment obtained by the appellant for damages for bodily injuries
under the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189,
2000 Rev Ed) (the “MVTPR Act”), if the respondent failed to pay the same.
Having intervened, the intervener was entitled to raise any defences or raise
any arguments open to the respondent in resisting the appellant’s claims,
subject of course to costs.

4 The appellant was 62 years old at the time of the accident and was 66 at the
time of the trial for the assessment of damages (though turning 67 years old
in 2021). At the time of the accident, the appellant was a driver for Grab
Holdings Inc (“Grab driver”) but his contention was that it was only a
temporary job. He was diagnosed to have suffered a right frontal subarachnoid
haemorrhage and he was discharged after an overnight stay. He subsequently
complained of headaches, chest discomfort and nasal discharge and was
readmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) for observation and treatment on
17 February 2017. He was discharged six days later on 22 February 2017.

8 The intervener agreed to the following claims:

(a) medical expenses (and continuing): $24,132.64; and

(b) transport expenses: $1,000.00.

9 The intervener disputed the remaining claims for various reasons, including
an alleged overestimation of the quantum of damages suffered and denial of the
bodily injury suffered based on their expert’s evidence which we shall deal
with below.

11 In brief, the appellant contends that the Judge erred in her findings of
facts which thereby resulted in the granting of erroneous sums of damages.

The principles applicable to appellate intervention for assessment of damages

12 The appellant relies on Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v
Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others [2014] 3 SLR 562 at [37] to argue
that the threshold for appellate intervention is crossed where “it can be
established that the trial judge’s assessment is plainly wrong or against the
weight of the evidence”. 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

AC at para 1; Appellant’s Bundle of Authorities (“BOA”) Tab C at p 36.

It bears mentioning, however, that the word “assessment” in the cited
paragraph does not refer to the assessment of damages but rather the
assessment of fact:

As much of the present appeal hinges on findings of fact made by the Judge, we
think it apposite to first set out the principles governing appellate
intervention vis-à-vis findings of fact by the trial judge. In Singapore, the
applicable principles have been authoritatively elucidated in Tat Seng Machine
Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Leasing Singapore Ltd [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 as follows
(at [41]):

… The appellate court’s power of review with respect to finding[s] of facts is
limited because the trial judge is generally better placed to assess the
veracity and credibility of witnesses, especially where oral evidence is
concerned … However, this rule is not immutable. Where it can be established
that the trial judge’s assessment is plainly wrong or against the weight of
the evidence, the appellate court can and should overturn any such finding …

13 The intervener relies on Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David [2013] 4 SLR
718 (“Tan Boon Heng”), 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

Intervener’s BOA Tab D at p 114.

another case relating to the assessment of damages arising from a road traffic
accident, for the applicable legal principles to appellate intervention in
cases concerning the assessment of damages. In that regard, the appellate
court (at [7]):

… may vary the quantum of damages awarded by the judge only if it is shown
that the latter: (a) acted on the wrong principles; (b) misapprehended the
facts; or (c) had for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate
of the damages ...

As such, while the parties rely on two separate case authorities, the two
authorities, when read together, are consistent and applicable to the present
case.

14 We add that the objective of damages is, in turn, meant to compensate the
claimant for his loss (Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong
Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong [2019] 1 SLR 145 (“Lua Bee Kiang”) at [9]):

As with any claim in the tort of negligence, the basic principle for
determining the quantum of damages for personal injury is to award the
claimant “full compensation” for his loss … This means that the award should,
as far as money can accomplish, restore him to the position that he would have
been in had the injury not been sustained … In the case of pecuniary losses,
such as lost earnings, the idea of full compensation gives rise to little
difficulty, at least in principle. However, where non-pecuniary loss is
concerned, such as pain, suffering and loss of amenity, full compensation is
inherently difficult to measure because such loss cannot be assessed by
mathematical calculation. The guiding principle, in this context, is therefore
that of “fair compensation”, in the words of Field J at first instance in the
English Court of Appeal decision of Phillips v The London and South Western
Railway Co (1879) 5 QBD 78 at 80. This means that compensation ought to be
reasonable and just, and need not be “absolute” or “perfect” (see Cane and
Goudkamp at pp 131–132 and the English Court of Appeal decision of Fletcher v
Autocar and Transporters Ltd [1968] 2 QB 322 (“Fletcher”) at 335A–B per Lord
Denning MR).

15 The Court of Appeal in Lua Bee Kiang thereafter discusses two methods for
quantifying damages (ie, the “component method” and the “global method” (at
[10])). In the present case, the Judge adopted the “component method” (without
mentioning it as such) and the method adopted is not disputed by parties. As
such, we highlight the principles applicable to the “component method” (Lua
Bee Kiang at [14]–[18]):

Quantification of individual items of loss, at the first stage, is essential
because it requires the court as far as possible to explain its reasons for
arriving at the final sum awarded. The court does this by placing a monetary
value on compensation for each discrete injury, and explaining why the value
is appropriate, having regard to the nature of the injury and its effect on
the claimant. …

Reference may be made to assessment guidelines at the first stage of the
analysis. In Singapore, the main resource is Charlene Chee et al, Guidelines
for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases (Academy
Publishing, 2010) (“the Guidelines”) … The Guidelines are of assistance
because they set out indicative assessment ranges for most types of personal
injury. However, it should be borne in mind that they are no more than
guidelines. As the former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong observed in the
foreword (at p vii), they provide a “good starting point” for negotiation.
More importantly, the Guidelines’ own premise behind the validity of the
indicative assessment ranges is that the injury concerned is the dominant
injury or is a distinct injury that the claimant has suffered. …

That explains the need for the second stage, which considers whether the
aggregate award is reasonable and neither excessive nor inadequate. If either
obtains, then the award will have to be adjusted. This is not an
impressionistic exercise, but is instead guided by at least two well-defined
considerations.

The first is what is often called “overlapping” injuries. This refers to the
phenomenon of injuries which either (a) together result in pain that would not
have been differentially felt by the claimant (Winston Tan ([10] supra) at
[16]) or (b) together give rise to only a single disability (Samuel Chai ([10]
supra) at [49]). In such circumstances, compensating for each distinct injury
would likely result in an excessive award. … Ultimately, the court must be
astute in assessing the claimant’s true loss, whether in the context of pain,
suffering and loss of amenity or future expenses, in order to avoid making
duplicative awards.

The second consideration is precedent. Reference to precedent assists in
arriving at a fair estimate of loss by drawing on experience contained in
previous decisions. It also ensures that like cases are treated alike. …

Issues to be determined

16 We now turn to those items of damages that are the subject of the appeal
before us, viz: 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

AC at para 5.

(a) general damages:

(i) pain and suffering for psychiatric conditions, ie, MDD, TRD and CP;

(ii) LFE;

(iii) FME;

(iv) future transport expenses;

(b) special damages:

(i) pre-trial loss of earnings;

(ii) dismissal of the appellant’s claim for loss of his car;

(iii) dismissal of the appellant’s claim for loss of use of his car; and

(c) costs for the proceedings below fixed at $45,000; and

(d) disbursements for the proceedings below fixed at $8,500.

17 The issue before this court is thus whether the Judge erred in the
assessment of damages. In that regard, the threshold for appellate
intervention is crossed only if the appellant shows that the Judge: (a) acted
on the wrong principles; (b) misapprehended the facts; or (c) had for these or
other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages (Tan Boon Heng
at [7]).

18 We shall first deal with the largest head of claim and the findings of fact
will encompass two items on appeal, viz, pre-trial loss of earnings and LFE.
It will be convenient to deal with them in a reverse order.

Loss of earnings (LFE and pre-trial loss of earnings)

The parties’ arguments below

19 The appellant claimed, unsuccessfully, $861,800 for pre-trial loss of
earnings and $2,052,000 for LFE (Judgment at [46]–[47], [100]). The LFE is
based on a multiplicand of $19,000/month with a multiplier of nine years (ie,
to work until he was 75 years old). The pre-trial loss of earnings is
similarly based on a multiplicand of $19,000/month for 50 months (from 14
February 2017 to September 2020, and October 2020 to 7 April 2021), less the
appellant’s monthly income of $2,100 as a Grab driver for 42 months (from 14
February 2017 to September 2020). 21

AC at para 96.

20 According to the appellant’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), his
employment history is as follows (Judgment at [10]–[11]):

(a) Motorola Semiconductor (Singapore) Pte Ltd (1985–2004), starting as a
strategic account manager in 1985 and promoted to territory manager in 1987;

sales manager and took a severance package in end-2014; 23

AC at para 48.

(d) Basler Asia Pte Ltd (“Basler”) (mid-2015–late-2016), starting as the
regional sales manager and promoted to regional sales director, drawing a
monthly basic salary of $11,800 (excluding a $700 monthly transport
allowance). 25

##### Foot Note 25

Appellant’s CB Vol II at p 23 (Mr Lau’s AEIC at paras 40–41).

The appellant tendered his resignation on 21 September 2016 and left in end-
October 2016 (Judgment at [12]).

21 The appellant thereafter applied for various positions, including the
following, for which there were no replies: 26

##### Foot Note 26

Appellant’s CB Vol II at p 25 (Mr Lau’s AEIC at para 44).

(a) business development director at APAC/Enterprise Market (on 31 December
2017);

(b) territorial sales manager at Global Digital Software Vendor (on 17 January
2018) which offered a salary of up to $300,000 a year;

(c) director of partnerships and business development Asia at Jivox
Corporation (on 17 January 2018);

(d) sales manager at Pangea Resourcing (on 7 March 2017); and

(e) APAC regional sales director at Comcast Technology Solutions (on 15 May
2017).

22 The appellant was also approached by a head-hunter with an opportunity for
Microchip Technology over a message on LinkedIn on 22 January 2017. Due to the
accident, the appellant was unable to contact the head-hunter until 19
February 2017, by which time he was told that the position was no longer
available. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

Appellant’s CB Vol II at pp 25–26 (Mr Lau’s AEIC at paras 45–46).

The appellant thereafter corresponded with other head-hunters for other
managerial/directorial positions, but was unsuccessful.

23 At the time of and after the accident, the appellant worked as a Grab
driver earning about $2,100 a month. Oddly, the appellant did not produce his
income tax returns to support his estimated monthly earning as a Grab driver
(Judgment at [24]). Rather, the appellant submitted his income tax returns
from 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (ie, for incomes earned some three years before
the accident) only. In support of his position that his income as a Grab
driver is a “significant decrease from [his] pre-accident earnings of about
$19,000/month”, the appellant relied on his income tax returns: 28

24 As for the multiplier, the appellant asserted that in his “previous
vocation as a regional sales director, the typical age of retirement is 72
years old” based on research findings on company directors published by the
Stanford Graduate School of Business (the “Stanford Publication”). 29

##### Foot Note 29

Appellant’s CB Vol II at p 36 (Mr Lau’s AEIC at para 71).

In that regard, “if not for the accident”, the appellant “would have continued
working” as he was “at the peak of [his] previous career as a regional sales
director” and is confident he would work till “75 years old given [his] senior
management position”. 30

Appellant’s CB Vol II at pp 36–37 (Mr Lau’s AEIC at para 72).

25 The intervener did not dispute the appellant’s employment history as
reproduced above. However, the intervener disagreed that the appellant had
voluntarily resigned from Basler by tendering his resignation on 21 September
2016 (with his last day in office being 31 October 2016). This is because, a
few days prior to that on 19 September 2016, Basler had already issued the
appellant a notice of severance (the “Notice”). 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

Intervener’s Supplemental CB at pp 31–32 (Notice of Severance dated 19
September 2016).

The Notice, issued to the appellant by Basler’s managing director, stated that
the appellant’s “last day of work with the company is 19 Sept 2016” and the
appellant “will be paid severance benefits” in the sum of $17,719.50.

26 More pertinently, the intervener disputed the appellant’s computation for
damages at $19,000 per month for nine years amounting to $2,052,000 based on a
retirement age of 75 years (Judgment at [107]). In that regard, the appellant
had already left or lost his previous employment with Basler “for 4 months 26
days before the accident”. Furthermore, in cross-examination, the appellant
testified that he informed his superior at Basler that he wanted to retire and
conceded that 62 was the retirement age in Singapore, subject to re-employment
opportunities: 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

ROA Vol III Part D at p 144–145 (Transcript dated 1 February 2021 at pp
15–16).

Q August. And you left in September, you have been 62 already.

A Yah.

Q Alright. Are you aware that the official retirement age in Singapore is 62
and you are entitled to ask for re-employment to 67?

A At that point, I didn’t really look into age. I think age is just a number,
it’s how---

Q Mr Lau, my question is---

…

Court: The retirement Singapore as of now is 62. Do you accept that? And even
then, right?

Witness: Yes.

…

Q And---but of course, we accept that you are entitled to request re-
employment up to 67 or 8. Do you accept that statement?

A Right.

Q Thank you. And you will be 67 years of age today this year by August?

A Correct.

Q Thank you. And just another point in case I overlook. Your departure from
Basler in September of 2016 was departure where you were given a severance of
1½ months, is that correct?

A No, I spoke to my boss, the MP of Singapore, and I told him I wanted to
retire and then there were some problems over should I get a quarter for
bonus. So at the end of all our discussion, it ended up to be a 1½ month.

27 Furthermore, the appellant did not disclose that he was working as a Grab
driver at the time of the accident in his AEIC or that he had applied for a
Taxi Driver’s Vocational Licence (“TDVL”) as early as November 2014. Weekly
statements obtained from Grab showed that the appellant worked as a Grab
driver from May to November 2019 after the accident, averaging at $2,100 per
month (Judgment at [108]). On 28 September 2020, the appellant received a
letter from the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) informing him that his TDVL
would be expiring on 18 November 2020. If the appellant wanted to renew his
TDVL, he would have to first attend a five-hour refresher course conducted by
the LTA. However, the appellant failed to do so (Judgment at [111]).

28 The intervener’s position is that the appellant’s loss of earnings was due
to his act of giving up his TDVL. Nevertheless, in the alternative, if the
court rules in favour of the appellant, then the multiplicand awarded should
be based on $2,100 per month. For pre-trial loss of earnings, the appellant
should be limited to claim only the days on which he was unable to work (ie,
sought medical treatment based on his medical bills). This totalled 186 days.
As such, the appellant’s pre-trial loss of earnings would be $13,020 ($70 per
day multiplied by 186 days) (Judgment at [113]–[114]).

The Judgment

29 The Judge accepted the intervener’s submission for pre-trial loss of
earnings at $13,020. As for LFE, the Judge declined to use 75 years as the
retirement age for the present case. The Judge distinguished the present case
from Lua Bee Kiang, on which the appellant sought to rely, in order to claim
beyond Singapore’s minimum retirement age of 62 years (Judgment at [115],
[118]–[119]). The claimant in Lua Bee Kiang was a carpenter, an occupation
which is not limited by one’s age and could very well have worked until 70.
While one could indeed request for re-employment for another five years at 62
(ie, until he is 67 years old), such option was not available to the appellant
because he was not in gainful employment at age 62, having left Basler in
October 2016.

30 As for the Stanford Publication, the Judge held that the “retirement age in
the US has no relevance to Singapore” (Judgment at [121]). The Judge also
remarked that, in the US, “the founders of technology/e-commerce behemoths
like Microsoft and Amazon have stepped down from their positions well before
they even reach 60”.

31 Rather, an award for LFE compensates a victim for a real and assessable
drop in income (ie, for the difference between the post-accident and pre-
accident income) (Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian [2010] 3 SLR 587
at [20]). 33

Intervener’s Supplemental BOA Tab B at p 89.

The claimant bears the burden of proving the damage claimed and a claim for
LFE must be “real assessable loss proved by evidence” (at [19]). In contrast,
loss of earning capacity (“LEC”) compensates for the risk or disadvantage,
which the claimant would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the
job that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open
employment market (at [20]). The Court of Appeal confirmed that LFE and LEC
are “separate and distinct” (at [20]).

32 The Judge assumed arguendo that the appellant did suffer LFE for five years
until the mandatory retirement age of 67 and awarded him $50,000. This is
based on a multiplicand of $10,000 per year (which is a discount on the
intervener’s figure of $13,020 due to accelerated receipt) multiplied by five
years (Judgment at [128]).

The parties’ cases on appeal

33 The appellant appeals against the Judge’s “erroneous calculation of LFE” as
they are “against the weight of the evidence”. 34

##### Foot Note 34

AC at p 32 and para 60.

First, the multiplicand used of $10,000 is based on the intervener’s
“calculation of pre-trial loss of income over a period of four years, more
specifically over 186 days” [emphasis in original]. As a matter of
computation, if the Judge accepted the appellant’s private hire driving income
as the basis for the multiplicand, then the figure of $25,200 (before
factoring accelerated receipt) should be used instead (ie, $2,100/month
multiplied by 12 months). Secondly, such an award essentially allows for some
double recovery to the appellant. Using a multiplier of five years (from 62 to
67 years of age) would overlap with the pre-trial loss of earnings of $13,020
(when the appellant was 62 at the time of the accident to 66 at the time of
the trial).

34 The appellant contends, contrary to the Judge’s findings of fact, that: 35

##### Foot Note 35

AC at paras 61–62.

(a) the appellant “had no intention to retire or settle for private hire
driving after leaving Basler” and “needed to continue working in senior
management positions to adequately provide for his family financially”;

(b) the appellant’s age “would not put him at a disadvantage in competing for
senior management positions given his wealth of experience and expertise”;

(c) the appellant was “incapable of testing himself by accepting a senior
management position, due to his reduced physical and mental abilities” which
had “greatly compromised his performance in interviews”; and

(d) the appellant’s decision “to not renew his private hire license upon its
expiry in November 2020 was in accordance with medical advice on his injuries
and disabilities consequent to the accident” [emphasis in original].

35 The appellant also submits that the Judge erred in awarding $13,020 for the
appellant’s pre-trial loss of earning. The appellant maintains that he “had
not intended to settle for private hire driving and the multiplicand used
should not be his monthly salary for the same” and that the appropriate
multiplier should be “based on his number of days of medical leave” of 50
months and “not for 186 days” [emphasis in original]. 36

##### Foot Note 36

In that regard, using a multiplicand of $19,000/month, the appellant submits

doctor’s memo dated 8 October 2020 that the appellant “has not been driving

Q … Between November 2016, after you left Basler and until you---your licence

treatment. Is that correct?

A Correct.

40 In response, the appellant emphasises that whether the appellant had lost
his job as a regional sales manager because of the accident is immaterial.
Rather, it is material that the appellant only intended to work as a Grab
driver temporarily, whilst searching for another job involving some managerial
position. As such, the appellant’s work at the time of the accident does not
demonstrate the appellant’s intention to work as a Grab driver full-time “for
the rest of his life”. 49

41 The appellant also contends that the intervener’s reliance on the October
Doctor’s Memo (see [37(c)] above) is misplaced and the intervener failed to
appreciate that, although the appellant may have been working consistently in
the period from May to November 2019, the appellant’s latest medical condition
is that he is unable to work and stopped work as a private hire driver. Thus,
the appellant could not earn an income from private hire driving since October
2020. 50

Our analysis on loss of earnings

The quantum of damages for LFE

42 Having considered the submissions and the evidence, we agree with the
learned Judge that the evidence did not support a multiplicand of $19,000 per
month. The appellant’s contention that he would have worked in a senior
management position in a company until he was 75 is without any valid basis.

43 The October Doctor’s Memo states the appellant’s date of birth as 16 August
1954. The Judge correctly assessed the evidence as regards his employment
history, which we have reproduced above at [20]. The appellant was about 60
years old when he took the severance package from Freescale in 2014. He
proceeded to look around for another job in the industry for six months before
securing a job at Basler. The appellant’s position was that he tendered his
resignation on 21 September 2016 because he was unable to fit in well with the
management style and left at the end of October 2016. However, the evidence
shows Basler issued the appellant the Notice on 19 September 2016 which stated
that his last day of work was 19 September 2016 and that he would be paid
severance benefits which came up to $17,719.50. We highlight that the
appellant would have been 62 when he left Basler.

44 As set out at [21]–[22] above, the appellant had contacts with various
head-hunters and recruiters but there were no concrete job offers forthcoming
up to the time of the accident. The appellant attempts to link the accident to
his failure to secure a job offer by two reasons: first, one of those
positions was no longer available by the time he had replied; and secondly,
that he struggled to recall details and hesitated during a conversation with
one head hunter on 9 April 2017 (ie, about two months after the accident),
which prejudiced his chances with that head hunter. 51

##### Foot Note 51

Appellant’s Written Submissions at para 30.

45 On the evidence that emerged at trial, it transpired that the appellant had
applied and obtained a TDVL in November 2014 which was not mentioned in the
appellant’s AEIC (as mentioned at [27] above). That seems to have coincided
with the time he left Freescale. It also transpired that he was working as a
Grab driver at the time of the accident. The objective evidence showed that
the appellant driving as a Grab driver from May to November 2019 averaging
$2,100 per month (ie, well over two years after the accident and prior to the
assessment of damages).

46 We note that the Judge carefully considered the evidence relating to the
appellant’s work history, what occurred after the accident and the medical
evidence and came to her findings of fact. The undeniable objective fact was
that at the age of 62, his employment with Basler ceased. Without being unduly
unkind to the appellant, his claims of being at the height of his career are
not at all convincing given the evidence of the Notice (as mentioned at [25]
above) and it is the appellant’s own evidence that he left because he could
not fit in with their management style. The appellant could not find another
job up to the time of the accident; and that was not for want of trying.

47 We therefore see no reason to intervene on the learned Judge’s finding of
fact on this score. Indeed, we agree with the learned Judge that there was no
realistic prospect of the appellant being employed in a similar senior
management position after he left Basler.

48 We emphasise that the appellant’s case for his LFE claim on the basis of
his intention to work in a senior management position is unconvincing and
untenable at law. As we mentioned at the hearing before us, such intention to
work does not necessarily mean that damages must be awarded based on a
claimant’s intention. Counsel for the appellant was unable to point us to any
local authority in support of his point. On the contrary, as we set out at
[14] above, it is trite that compensation should, as far as money can
accomplish, restore a claimant to the position that he would have been in had
the injury not been sustained. In the circumstances and given the appellant’s
employment history at the material time of the accident, we are satisfied that
allowing the appeal on LFE based solely on the appellant’s intention without
more would put him in a better position than he would otherwise been in.

49 We accordingly dismiss the appellant’s claim for LFE at $2,052,000 based on
a multiplier of nine years at $19,000 per month with little hesitation. The
learned Judge’s award of LFE at $50,000 based on earning a discounted figure
of $10,000 a year for five years was a reasonable conclusion based on the
evidence and in our view, must stand.

50 For completeness, we briefly address the appellant’s point that the award
based on a multiplier of five years from 62 to 67 years of age essentially
overlaps with the appellant’s pre-trial loss of earnings (see [33] above).
Nevertheless, the intervener agrees with the Judge’s order for LFE for a sum
of $50,000 and we are of the view that there is no need to disturb the Judge’s
order on LFE. We recognise that this would in effect grant LFE from the period
of about 2021 (ie, the time of the trial) to 2026, when the appellant would be
about 72 years old. We find no basis to disturb such award in principle as the
applicable multiplier was based on the appellant’s earnings as a Grab driver –
for which he may have continued beyond the retirement age of 67 years if his
health allowed it.

51 We qualify that our remarks should in no way be interpreted to mean that a
claim for LFE should ordinarily go beyond the prevailing retirement age in
Singapore to 72 or otherwise endorsing the Stanford Publication mentioned at
[24] above. It is axiomatic that each case must be assessed on its own
particular facts. As in the case of Lua Bee Kiang, an occupation is not
necessarily limited by one’s age, depending on the precise nature of the job
for that occupation (see [29] above).

The quantum of damages for pre-trial loss of earnings

52 The appellant faces the same difficulty with the multiplicand for his pre-
trial loss of earnings. As we set out at [35], the appellant likewise takes
the position that the applicable multiplicand is $19,000 a month in respect of
his pre-trial loss of earnings. For the same reasons which we elaborate at
[42]–[48] above, we reject the appellant’s position in this regard.

53 It will be noted that the appellant (as we elaborated at [35] above),
accepts that for a period of 42 months (from the date of the accident to,
presumably, end September 2020), the sum of $2,100 representing his average
earnings as a Grab driver should be deducted from the multiplicand of $19,000.
The evidence before the court in respect of the appellant’s earnings was that
for the period 29 May 2019 to 27 November 2019, the appellant was driving for
Grab and the parties accept averaged earnings of $2,100 per month. We also
note that the significance of the latter date (ie, September 2020) is that on
8 October 2020, he was certified medically unfit to drive pursuant to the
October Doctor’s Memo and therefore could not work as a Grab driver
thereafter.

54 The learned Judge awarded the appellant pre-trial loss of earnings based on
his earnings as a Grab driver, at $13,020 or $70 per day and limited to the
186 days when he was not driving but seeking medical treatment. The appellant
accepted in cross-examination that he was driving as a Grab driver during that
period except for those periods he sought medical treatment (as we reproduced
at [39] above) and that same approach was echoed somewhat in his submissions
before us but, perhaps with more time for reflection, refined to take into
account the period from 8 October 2020 onwards after he was medically
certified as unfit to drive. With respect, we do not agree that this award for
pre-trial loss of earnings was entirely correct on the facts and evidence
before the court.

55 For a start, it is undisputed that the appellant was on medical leave from
17 February 2017 to 15 June 2020 (as mentioned at [38]). At the hearing before
us, counsel for the intervener admitted that it was likewise highly unlikely
that the appellant could have possibly driven immediately after the accident
(ie, from the period of 14 to 16 February 2017). We are satisfied that the
appellant’s medical certificates constitute objective evidence which must be
accorded some weight. This is consistent with appellant’s contention that on
some days, he did not feel so well and could not drive a full day or even not
at all. As against that, we have evidence that the appellant was driving
substantial hours per day from 29 May 2019 to 27 November 2019 and his
admission in court as to his driving everyday save for the 186 days’ during
which he was seeking medical treatment. From this, the parties accept and we
agree with the Judge, that there is sufficient evidence to show that the
appellant’s earnings as a Grab driver is about $2,100 per month or $70 per
day. However, we allow the appeal as against the multiplier as the Judge’s
finding below on the applicable multiplier is against the weight of the
evidence.

56 In our view, the starting point is that the pre-trial loss encompasses the
periods for which the appellant was on medical leave between 14 February 2017
to 1 February 2021, which total 1,401 days. We note briefly that, although the
appellant was readmitted to TTSH only on 17 February 2017, the intervener does
not seriously dispute that from 14 to 16 February 2017 (ie, immediately
following the traffic accident), the appellant would be unable to work as a
driver for Grab. As such, in our judgment, it would be more accurate to take
those dates into account when determining the appropriate multiplier. On the
evidence before us, the appellant was able to and did drive for a period of
about 183 days (from 29 May 2019 to 27 November 2019). If we take this into
account in calculating the appropriate multiplier, the result is 1,218 days.
We pause to note some discrepancy in the evidence below. In the appellant’s
AEIC, he states that he has been “driving Grab for five days a week.” However
the parties accepted below that the earnings of the appellant as a Grab driver
is $70 per day based on $2,100 per month, which means thirty working days per
month. These figures of $70 per day and $2,100 per month are not in contention
before us. We will therefore not disturb these figures because this is not
contradicted by the evidence from Grab for the period referred to above and it
would make little difference to the final figure because any decrease in the
number of working days per month would result, in view of the parties’
acceptance of the earnings of $2,100 per month, an increase in the
multiplicand.

57 We further highlight that, despite the appellant’s evidence, we are not
satisfied that the intervener has shown that on a balance of probabilities
that the appellant had worked on every single day whilst he was on medical
leave except for the days on which he had sought treatment (ie, 186 days) on
the evidence before the court. For example, it is undisputed that the
appellant was certified medically unfit to drive since 8 October 2020 and his
TDVL expired shortly thereafter, on 18 November 2020. If the intervener’s
contention was that the appellant had worked beyond the period from 29 May
2019 to 27 November 2019 but simply failed to disclose all of Grab’s weekly
statements in his possession, then it was for the intervener to have sought
specific discovery for the same and if that was not forthcoming from the
appellant, it could subpoena Grab for its records. Counsel for the intervener
candidly admitted that neither was done in the proceedings below.

58 At the hearing before us, counsel for the intervener also admitted that of
the four days on which the intervener had conducted a discreet surveillance on
the appellant (ie, 29 July 2019, 31 July 2019, 13 August 2019, 20 August
2019), the appellant was seen to be driving only on the first two days of
surveillance but not the latter two. 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

Intervener’s Supplemental CB at pp 17–29 (Report of Nemesis Investigations
Private Limited).

In our judgment, such evidence of the appellant working on certain days (but
not all) only buttresses our analysis for our finding. We also take into the
account the fact that the appellant was certified medically unfit to drive on
8 October 2020 and his medical certificates ended on 6 April 2021.
Accordingly, we award pre-trial loss of earnings of $85,260 based on a
multiplier of 1,218 days and a multiplicand of $70 per day.

Conclusion on loss of earnings

59 From the foregoing, we dismiss the appeal against the LFE but allow the
appeal against pre-trial loss of earnings in part. The appellant is thus
entitled to $50,000 for LFE as the Judge decided below and $85,260 for the
pre-trial loss of earnings.

Pain and suffering for psychiatric conditions

The parties’ arguments below and the Judge’s finding

60 As we noted at [10] above, the appellant claimed damages of $65,000 for
psychiatric conditions. The appellant submitted that he suffers from: (i) MDD,
(ii) TRD and (iii) CP. The intervener argued that “notwithstanding the
[appellant’s] litany of complaints such as headaches, fatigue and depression,
he is fully independent in his activities of daily living and he manages his
pain through medication”, which was evident from the fact that he was able to
work as a Grab driver (Judgment at [65]).

61 The intervener also referred to Charlene Chee et al, Guidelines for the
Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases (Academy Publishing,
2010) (the “Guidelines”) for the quantum of awards in cases of general
psychiatric disorders for claims for depressions, avoidant phobias, anxiety
attacks etc (Judgment at [80]). The Judge agreed with the intervener that the
appellant’s “depression is only moderately severe” but rejected the
appellant’s figure of $65,000 and the intervener’s figure of $15,000 (Judgment
at [81]). We note that the typical range for quantum awarded for “moderately
severe” general psychiatric disorders is $8,000–$25,000 whereas the typical
range for “severe” general psychiatric disorders is $25,000–$55,000 under the
Guidelines (Judgment at [80]). Although the Judge made no reference to the
appellant’s claim for CP, the Judge held that “a more appropriate figure would
be $45,000” – which is well beyond the upper limit for a “moderately severe”
general psychiatric disorder.

62 Regarding TRD in particular, the Judge found that “it is unlikely that the
[appellant] suffers from TRD” as only one doctor, Dr Chan Lai Gwen (“Dr
Chan”), has confirmed the same (Judgment at [67]) and Dr Chan based her
assessment of the appellant’s intolerance to two drugs based on what the
appellant had told her. In that sense, the Judge found that no “clinical
trials/tests were conducted to determine if the [appellant] has TRD” (Judgment
at [68]). The Judge instead preferred the opinion of another doctor, Dr Lim
Yun Chun (“Dr Lim”), who was of the opinion that it was premature to conclude
whether the plaintiff has TRD (Judgment at [66] and [69]).

The parties’ cases on appeal

63 Parties disagree whether the appellant suffers from TRD. The appellant
submits that the Judge “erred in preferring Dr Lim’s opinion because it is
against the weight of the evidence” and instead, “Dr Chan’s testimony that
[the appellant] suffers from TRD should have been preferred” for several
reasons: 53

In that case, the Court of Appeal rejected the argument that a judge must

parts of an expert’s evidence (and if so, which parts) is guided by
considerations of consistency, logic and coherence which requires a scrutiny

upon (at [90]–[92]). 59

lead to a diagnosis of TRD, a definitive conclusion of TRD cannot be drawn

dosage and duration must be for a sufficient duration and calibrated before
such conclusion could be drawn. 61

Our analysis on the appellant’s pain and suffering

Whether the appellant suffered from TRD

67 The areas of disagreement on Dr Chan’s diagnosis lie on two fronts: (a)
whether a scrutiny of Dr Chan’s methodology in diagnosing the appellant’s
psychiatric condition reveals that her methodology is medically unsound; and
(b) whether Dr Lim is of the view that the appellant does not have TRD and, if
so, whether Dr Lim’s evidence is preferrable.

68 We deal with the first point of contention briefly. From the outset, it
bears mentioning that the court is not concerned with assessing the doctors’
respective preferred methods of assessing the appellant’s TRD. Judges are not
medical experts and it would be wholly unhelpful for us to scrutinise the
precise methods used to assess the appellant’s psychiatric condition as the
parties contend unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, which is not
the case before us. Rather, the true – and sole – issue to be determined in
this regard was whether the Judge erred in preferring Dr Lim’s evidence to Dr
Chan’s. In our judgment, the evidence of the parties’ respective experts are
not as contradictory as the intervener submits.

69 At the trial, Dr Lim frankly admitted that his opinion was limited to a
short interview on one occasion: 64

Q Okay, and of course, you would invite him to sit down, and then you would
write down what the patient tells you, is that correct?

A That’s correct.

Q And you would be asking him about his general background, his age, and what
he’s doing, then after that, you go to---the next step is his physical health,
and so on and so forth, is that correct?

A That’s correct.

Q How long did the whole process take, Dr Lim?

A Usually, I earmark about 1 hour to 1½ hour for the interview. …

opinion on her diagnosis of requiring lifelong treatment: 65

Q Nobody wants to be lifelong dependent on drugs.

A That’s right.

Q … Now, doctor, but going back to the paragraph that you have stated, page
85, you did say that, based on these guidelines, if it’s a case of 2 years,
whereby we are talking about maintenance treatment of antidepressant, and it
is a case whereby it is still non-responsive, based on this guideline, purely
on what you have written and what Dr Chan is of the opinion that it’s
lifelong, would you then defer to her?

A I think she would do a---make a critical judgment at the right time.

Q So you would defer to her?

A Yah, if---yah, that’s right, yah.

70 The only doubt which Dr Lim casted on Dr Chan’s diagnosis, on which the
intervener seeks to rely, is as follows: 66

Appellant’s CB Vol II at pp 221–222 (Transcript dated 5 February 2021 at p
347, line 21 to p 348, line 5).

A I think, conventionally, TRD is only fulfilled if the patient is given a
chance to complete the medication regime that is first recommended. …

…

A … In other words, you know, she tried, and the patient was never given -
what we would say - adequate medication. The trouble with antidepressant, that
you must give the patient the dosage that is seen to be therapeutic and for a
duration that is accepted that this will be the therapeutic period before you
can say it’s not working. So that was not Dr Chan’s experience as far as I
read her notes, that this patient couldn’t tolerate, and then he let go. Not
by Dr Chan’s desire, but the patient don’t want to take. So I think that’s
where the---the definition of treatment-resistant depression could be disputed
on that grounds.

[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]

From the foregoing, it is clear that Dr Lim was careful to qualify his opinion
for disagreeing with Dr Chan’s diagnosis of TRD. In that regard, Dr Lim
qualified his evidence by stating that it was based on what he could tell from
a reading of Dr Chan’s notes only. Given Dr Lim’s admission that he had only
one short interview with the appellant, Dr Lim would not be in the position to
reliably postulate that the basis upon which Dr Chan made her diagnosis was
because the appellant did not want to take the previously prescribed
antidepressants without first attempting to complete trials for various
antidepressants (of the appropriate dosage and duration).

71 For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully disagree with the learned Judge
that Dr Lim’s opinion is to be preferred over Dr Chan’s. We thus find, on the
weight of the evidence, that the appellant does suffer from TRD. We also
mention that the Judge had likewise recognised the appellant’s condition at
least in principle. In that regard, the Judge ultimately awarded the appellant
with two years’ worth of rTMS partly “in deference to the views of [his]
doctors” (Judgment at [89]). We now turn to address the quantum of damages to
be awarded, in the light of the appellant’s TRD.

The quantum of damages for the appellant’s psychiatric conditions

72 Although we find that the appellant does suffer from TRD, we disagree that
such TRD (and CP) should be used to increase the awarded amount for
psychiatric conditions from $45,000 to $65,000 as the appellant contends. 67

Appellant’s Reply at para 17.

We highlight that $65,000 would be substantially higher than the upper end of
the range for damages in respect of “severe” general psychiatric disorders
under the Guidelines 68

Intervener’s Supplemental BOA Tab F at pp 166–167.

(ie, $25,000–$55,000). One relevant description for “severe” cases is that
“[d]espite treatment, the prognosis remains very poor as the person is
unlikely to be able to return to employment permanently or even take charge of
his daily affairs”. In contrast, the typical range for “moderately severe” is
$8,000–$25,000 where the “prognosis will be much more optimistic” than in the
“severe” cases and the person is “able to perform the activities of daily life
independently”.

73 In our judgment, the learned Judge was correct to find that the appellant’s
general psychiatric disorder can be described as only “moderately severe”.
Even if the appellant has TRD, it is undisputed that he is able to conduct the
activities of daily life independently. Although the Judge may not have
expressly mentioned CP, we are satisfied that such CP is adequately accounted
for in the awarded sum of $45,000. We agree with the intervener’s submission
that the sum awarded of $45,000, which would be in between the typical range
for “severe” cases and an uplift from the typical range for “moderate” cases
appropriately recognises the level of the appellant’s pain and suffering.

74 Accordingly, the Judge cannot be said to have made a “wholly erroneous
estimate of the damages” (Tan Boon Heng at [7]). In our view, $45,000
sufficiently compensates for the appellant’s MDD, TRD and CP and we dismiss
the appellant’s appeal on this issue.

FME and future transport expenses

The parties’ arguments below and the Judge’s finding

75 Given that the Judge had found the appellant did not suffer from TRD, the
Judge thus remarked that “the rTMS procedure would appear to be unnecessary”.
However, the intervener accepted two courses of rTMS a year (ie, for a sum of
$4,560) instead of three courses a year as claimed by the appellant (Judgment
at [87]). As such, the Judge awarded the appellant “two years’ worth of rTMS”
for a sum of $13,680 (ie, $6,840 for three courses per year multiplied by two
years) (Judgment at [89]).

76 As regards the appellant’s claim for lifelong medication, the Judge found
that the appellant would be “doing himself a great disservice – if he
continues with his cocktail of drugs for the rest of his natural life”. In
that regard, the appellant should be “detoxified from opiate-based drugs and
if his pain cannot be controlled or eased with conventional drugs, then
alternatives such as TCM should be explored” (Judgment at [90]). The Judge
expressed that the appellant should not be deprived of medication “in the
short term but is loath to award him lifelong medication that would probably
do him more harm than good” (Judgment at [91]). The Judge thus reduced the
period for which the appellant is awarded medication from 12 years to five
years only (Judgment at [92]).

The parties’ cases on appeal

77 The appellant appeals against the Judge’s decision against only the
multiplier (and not the multiplicand) for pharmacotherapy, consultations with
TTSH psychiatry ($144.00 per year) and rTMS ($6,840.00 per year). 69

##### Foot Note 69

Appellant’s Written Submissions at para 19.

The plaintiff’s pharmacotherapy includes trazodone, clomipramine, zopiclone,
bromazepam, Concerta, tramadol and pregabalin for a total of $2,405.20 per
year (Judgment at [94]).

78 The appellant submits that the Judge erred in preferring Dr Lim’s
unsubstantiated approach of detoxifying the appellant from painkillers and
thereafter explore alternative treatments. The appellant contends that Dr
Lim’s concern was based on general observations and not borne out in the face
of other medical experts’ evidence. Furthermore, painkillers are appropriately
and necessarily prescribed to the appellant and, in any case, he has already
attempted alternative treatment methods which proved to be ineffective. 70

79 The intervener’s position is that the damages awarded for FME on a five-
year basis (and associated future transport expenses) is eminently reasonable
and ought not to be disturbed. 71

In that regard, the intervener highlights that the applicable legal test for
determining whether a medical expense should be allowed is one of
reasonableness (Poh Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil

and we would add that “reasonableness” is, in turn, dependent on a range of
circumstances including whether or not the particular treatment in question is
necessary and whether or not it was taken pursuant to a doctor’s advice. The
intervener submits that: 73

trazodone and Concerta) was not based on a lifetime basis but instead between

(b) the appellant’s FME in relation to pain is contingent on the outcome of
his psychiatric treatment (in particular, rTMS); and

(c) there is a risk of overcompensation if FME is allowed on a lifetime basis.

80 In response, the appellant argues that Dr Chan did not opine that rTMS for
two years would be sufficient. Rather, according to her letter dated 9 January
2020, treatment is “usually lifelong”. 75

Our analysis on the appellant’s FME and future transport expenses

The need for rTMS and pharmacotherapy

81 From the outset, we agree with the parties’ common position that the
appellant’s need for pharmacotherapy may be significantly reduced if rTMS
proves effective. While we understand the Judge’s concern that “lifelong
medication” may do the appellant “more harm than good”, we respectfully
disagree that it was for the Judge to make such a finding on the long-term
effect of the appellant’s prescribed medications in the circumstances – this
being a medical question for the appellant’s doctors to determine. Rather, the
overarching guiding principle for the award of damages in the present case is
to restore the appellant into the position that he would have been in, as far
as possible, if not for the accident.

82 Having considered the parties’ submissions, we respectfully disagree with
the Judge in respect of the applicable multiplier for rTMS. Given our
preference for Dr Chan’s evidence that the appellant does indeed suffer from
TRD, we see no reason to reject Dr Chan’s evidence that the rTMS treatment
would be lifelong. We agree that the appropriate multiplier for rTMS treatment
should be 12 years as submitted by the appellant, which is based on the male
life expectancy of 84.3 years according to the Ministry of Health’s data on
Population and Vital Statistics 2018 (Judgment at [83]) and taking a discount
of about 1/3. 78

##### Foot Note 78

×

AC at para 45.

83 Having considered the appellant’s alternative position, we are satisfied
that there is no need to disturb the Judge’s multiplier of five years for
pharmacotherapy. To be clear, we disagree with the Judge’s holding that the
appellant is not entitled to lifelong pharmacotherapy as “that would probably
do him more harm than good” (as mentioned at [76] above) and our judgment
should not be read as such. It bears emphasising that the appropriateness of
pharmacotherapy for a claimant is ultimately a medical decision for which
judges lack the medical expertise to decide. Rather, we accept the Judge’s
multiplier of five years for a wholly different reason – that such
pharmacotherapy would likely not be lifelong in view of the lifelong rTMS
treatment. As parties agree that pharmacotherapy is meant to be a short-term
solution, there is no need to further increase the multiplier from five years
to six years. The appellant’s appeal to increase the quantum of damages for
pharmacotherapy is accordingly dismissed. The Judge’s award totalling $12,026
(ie, $2,405.20 per year as mentioned at [77], multiplied by five years) for
the appellant’s pharmacotherapy stands.

Other consequential adjustments

84 Consequently, consultations with TTSH Psychiatry would likely need to
continue for that duration of rTMS treatment and the same multiplier should be
adopted as well.

85 In respect of psychiatric hospitalisation, the Judge is correct to have
omitted it from the award. This is because the appellant has not proved the
reasonableness of such expenditure on a yearly basis, especially if the
appellant and the appellant’s doctor, Dr Chan, are hopeful that rTMS would be
effective.

86 Finally, as the appellant would require lifelong treatment and
consultation, we consequently award future transport expenses on a lifetime
basis (instead of a five-year basis).

Conclusion on FME and future transport expenses

87 In summary, we:

(a) dismiss the appeal against the quantum of damages awarded for
pharmacotherapy (totalling $12,026, being $2,405.20 per year for five years);

(b) allow the appeal to increase the multiplier for rTMS (totalling
$82,080.00), consultations with TTSH Psychiatry (totalling $1,728.00) and
future transport expenses to 12 years (totalling $2,500); and

(c) dismiss the appeal against the dismissal of the claim for psychiatric
hospitalisation.

Damage to car

88 The appellant made a claim for the loss of his car at $37,959. The learned
Judge dismissed the claim on the ground that the intervener is only liable to
the appellant for claims for bodily injury. With respect, this is not correct.
The appellant, as plaintiff, sued the respondent, as the tortfeasor, for
damage caused to his car. There can be no doubt that the respondent is fully
liable for the accident, interlocutory judgment has been entered on that basis
and it follows that the respondent must be liable to the appellant for damage
caused to his car as a result of the accident. Judgment is entered against the
respondent/defendant, not the intervener, even for those items of loss and
damage caused by the personal injuries suffered by the appellant. The
appellant did not sue the intervener.

89 The intervener becomes liable to pay the appellant only because s 4 read
with ss 7 and 9 of the MVTPR Act provides that if the respondent fails to pay
the appellant the loss and damage for personal injury as a result of the road
accident, then notwithstanding the fact that the intervener is entitled to
repudiate liability to indemnify the respondent, its insured, under the motor
vehicle policy, the intervener has to satisfy the judgment provided certain
conditions under s 9 of the MVTPR Act are met (this is not in issue here). The
MVTPR Act then enables the insurer to seek an indemnity from the respondent.

90 In this case, there was evidence that the appellant ’s car was a
constructive total loss. GTG Appraiser Services LLP (“GTG”) noted, in its
Inspection Report dated 9 October 2017, that the appellant’s car sustained bad
damage to the rear and front portions of the car. There were photographs to
evidence the damage. GTG’s licensed appraiser stated that the market value of
the car was $79,800 at the time of the accident and the repairer’s estimate to
repair the car was $150,000. The car was therefore a constructive total loss
and its salvage value was $46,300. The appellant was subsequently informed
that the salvage value was $42,941 as stated in a sale and purchase agreement
for the wreck and after deducting a service charge of $1,100, the appellant
received $41,841. The appellant’s loss was therefore $37,959 ($79,800, less
$41,841). This evidence and figures were, for obvious reasons, not challenged
below.

91 We therefore allow the appeal on this item and enter judgment for the
appellant for $37,959 in respect of his loss of his car as a result of the
respondent’s negligence.

Loss of use of the car

92 The appellant’s claim for loss of use for 7 months from 14 February 2017 to
the date of inspection of his car on 11 September 2017 was also dismissed by
the learned trial judge on the same ground, viz, that the intervener was “not
liable” for the property damage. With respect, this is wrong for the same
reason in respect of the damage to the car.

93 We have not been told why it took so long for the car to be inspected.
There is no evidence as to who caused this delay. As it is the appellant who
is making the claim, it is incumbent on him to prove why it took so long to
justify a loss of use claim of 7 months. The appellant is entitled to a
reasonable period for loss of use of his car. If we take into account the
immediate aftermath of the accident and the appellant’s injuries, we take the
view that the appellant should have pushed for resolution of inspection and
appraisal and therefore decided whether he wished to go into the second-hand
market to purchase an equivalent used car. We would therefore award the
appellant loss of use for 60 days. This is the equivalent of about two months
and we understand this consistent with the practice of the State Courts to
have a maximum period of two months barring any exceptional facts that
militate a longer period. The appellant’s car was a Category B car (above
1,600 cc) being a Volvo S60 with a two-litre engine and two-wheel drive. The
State Courts again peg the loss of use of Category B cars at between $100 to
$120 per day.

94 In our view, it would be fair to enter judgment in favour of the appellant
against the respondent for $6,600 being 60 days at $110 per day in respect of
his claim for loss of use of his car as a result of the accident.

Costs and disbursements

95 The appellant appeals against the Judge’s order of costs at $45,000 and
disbursements of $8,500 based on the appellant’s Schedule of Costs. The
intervener, however, agrees that given the damages awarded and that the
proceedings at the court below was limited to only the assessment of damages
which took place over three and a half days, the Judge’s award in costs and
disbursements are fair. 79

##### Foot Note 79

×

IC at para 88.

In response, the appellant submits that a total of $158,000 in costs and
$42,981.95 in disbursements would be “fairly commensurate with the work done
considering the appeal and quantum submitted in this matter”. In the
alternative, the appellant asks for “costs and disbursements to be taxed, if
not agreed”. 80

##### Foot Note 80

×

Appellant’s Written Submissions at para 45.

96 On face value, the appellant’s Schedule of Costs shows a breakdown for the
total of $158,000 in costs and $42,981.95 in disbursements (inclusive of costs
and disbursements for the appeal). At the time of the assessment of damages,
the previous Appendix G was applicable. It does counsel no credit when
extravagant claims for costs are put forward which can bear no reference to
the guidelines in Appendix G. There is no question of this being a very
difficult case.

97 We have taken note of the issues upon which the appellant succeeded below
and upon which he failed to prevail. The largest quantum related to his LFE
and pre-trial loss of earnings. On both these items, he failed. Considerable
time was spent on these issues. Considerable medical evidence was also called.
Bearing all the facts of this case, the course of the assessment of damages
below, and the modest success on appeal, we see no reason to disturb the
Judge’s exercise of discretion. If anything, it is not ungenerous from the
point of view of the appellant.

Conclusion

98 For the foregoing reasons, we allow the appeal in part as set out above. In
summary, we allow the following claims for particular items of damages as
follows:

Damage| Judgment| Appeal| Quantum  
---|---|---|---  
Pain and Suffering – Brain Injury| $70,000.00| Not appealed| -  
Pain and Suffering – Psychiatric Conditions (MDD, TRD, CP)| $45,000.00 | Dismissed| $45,000.00   
Pain and Suffering – Shoulder Injury| $5,000.00| Not appealed| -  
Pain and Suffering – Neck Injury| $7,000.00| Not appealed| -  
FME| $12,746.00 (Medical Treatment / Consultations)| Dismissed as against
pharmacotherapy, allowed as against TTSH Psychiatry consultations| $13,754.00  
$13,680.00(rTMS)| Allowed| $82,080.00  
Future Transport Expenses| $1,000.00| Allowed| $2,500.00  
LFE| $50,000.00| Dismissed| $50,000.00  
Medical Expenses| $24,132.64| Not appealed| -  
Transport Expenses| $1,000.00| Not appealed| -  
Pre-Trial Loss of Earnings| $13,020.00| Allowed| $85,260.00  
Total Loss of Car| Dismissed| Allowed| $37,959.00  
Loss of Use of Car| Dismissed| Allowed| $6,600.00  
Costs| $45,000.00| Dismissed| -  
Disbursements| $8,500.00| Dismissed| -  
  
99 As for the costs of the appeal before us, the appellant submitted a sum of
$50,000 and disbursements of $7,786.83. Bearing in mind that the appellant has
not succeeded on all his claims before us, especially his claims of LFE and
damages for pain and suffering for his psychiatric condition, and bearing in
mind the converse success of the intervener on those and other issues where
the intervener prevailed, we order that each party bears its own costs.

100 However, the appellant is entitled to his costs against the respondent in
respect of his property damage and loss of use claim. We accordingly award the
appellant $2,500 all in, payable by the respondent, for these two items of
damage. There will be the usual consequential orders.
