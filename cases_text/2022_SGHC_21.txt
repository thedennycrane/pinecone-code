General Division of the High Court — Suit No 79 of 2018  
Choo Han Teck J  
24 January 2022

28 January 2022 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 In the normal case where several defendants are sued, it would only be fair
and just when awarding costs to ascertain the degree of liability and the
incursion of costs by each of them individually.

2 In a case such as the present where the defendants all worked in tandem as
part of their plan to induce the plaintiff to pay over money for a purpose the
defendants never intended to fulfil, there is often, as in this case, the
difficulty of the fact-finding court to determine the exact contribution of
each of the defendant.

3 Furthermore, the intention and the acts of the individual defendant meshed
into the one to carry out the device they planned. For the purposes of costs
in such cases, neither the individual contributions by the defendants nor
their internal hierarchy is of significance as to how costs should be
apportioned. They are all to be liable in costs jointly or severally.

4 It remains only as to the amount of costs payable. The plaintiff is seeking
costs of $350,000. The second defendant’s counsel submits that $100,000 is
sufficient. Mr Kang for the third defendant submits that costs should be
$93,000. Mr Chong submits that costs should be ordered only after the appeal
is heard. He fears that the plaintiff may not reimburse the defendants should
they succeed on appeal. In any event, he submits that $350,000 is excessive.

5 I see no reason why I should not order costs now. It should be the preferred
approach so that the parties can appeal both merits and costs before the
appellate court at the same time.

6 It remains for me to determine the appropriate quantum. I approve the
submissions of the plaintiff’s counsel, but on the whole, I am of the view
that a slight adjustment should be made and I therefore award the sum of
$300,000 costs plus disbursements against the second to fourth defendants
jointly and severally.
