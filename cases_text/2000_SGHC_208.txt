**JUDGMENT:**

_**Cur Adv Vult**_

In this action the plaintiffs ("Nuplex"), a company incorporated in New
Zealand engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical resins, are claiming
against the defendants the sum of US$49,364.00 being the value of 48x200 kg
drums of Chemical resins code-named PANVL and 144x200 kg drums of chemical
resins code-named CHEMTEX which they had placed on quasi-bailment with the
defendants ("Panatron"), a company incorporated in Singapore engaged in the
manufacture and sale of chemical sealants and other coating products. Nuplex
claim that the said sum has become payable under the terms of their agreement
with Panatron.

2 Panatron, who obtained a licence from Chemtour, the sole-proprietorship of
Eral Dettrick ("Dettrick") of Australia to manufacture the chemical sealants,
deny that they are liable to pay for the chemical resins placed on quasi-
bailment. They further assert that Nuplex had agreed to supply chemical resins
in perpetuity for as long as they wanted the resins. In relation to the resins
placed on quasi-bailment Panatron also claim that it was agreed that the
agreement implementing the quasi-bailment could only be terminated if both
parties mutually agreed. In other words, either party could under the alleged
agreement keep the quasi-bailment afoot for so long as they choose to do so.
Panatron allege that Nuplex were in breach of both agreements and they claim
substantial damages against them.

3 By para 11 of their Re-Amended Defence and Amended Counterclaim Panatron
advance the allegation that Nuplex had colluded with Dettrick to cause loss
and damage to Panatron. They aver that Dettrick "had pressurised or influenced
(Nuplex) to wrongfully and/or recklessly terminate (the agreement for) the
supply of goods".

4 Panatron have also alleged civil conspiracy against Dettrick and other
parties in Suit 2061/1997. That suit and this action were tried before me one
and after another and it was agreed that evidence in one case may be used in
the other. I have set out in more details the parties and the material
background in a judgment in that action and issued on even date. Such parts as
are relevant for present purposes are incorporated into this judgment by
reference. On the evidence and for the reasons set out in that action, I
rejected Panatron’s allegation of a civil conspiracy committed by Dettrick and
the defendants in the other suit. In this action, I shall set out the evidence
which bear on the allegation of a civil conspiracy between Dettrick and Nuplex
to injure Panatron and for the reasons hereinafter appearing I find that the
allegation is entirely without substance.

The facts

5 In late September 1995 Panatron entered into a licence agreement with
Chemtour, the sole-proprietorship of Dettrick, for Panatron to manufacture and
market waterproof paints and coatings in Singapore and the region. Such paints
and coatings use chemical sealants. Panatron were introduced to Nuplex by
Dettrick. Nuplex’s related company in Australia had been supplying the
chemical resins, chemically known as "Viscopol 140" (code-named PANVL) and
"Texicryl 13031"( code-named CHEMTEX, to Dettrick’s companies.

6 Panatron started production in early January 1996. They also started to
purchase the two chemical resins from Nuplex. Each shipment was carried out in
the following manner. Panatron’s plant manager or the Senior Vice-President,
Peter Yin ("Yin") who gave evidence in this case for Nuplex and who was one of
the conspirators named by Panatron in the other suit, would complete a
purchase requisition for the amount of resins needed. It was usually a full
container load ("FCL"). The President of Panatron, Phua Mong Seng ("Phua"),
who gave evidence for Panatron, would approve and issue the purchase order.
The purchase order set out the terms of each purchase, stating the mode of
payment for the resins (which was usually by means of a letter of credit) at
the prevailing quoted price, and the estimated time of arrival of the resins.
The purchase order would then be faxed to Nuplex who indicated their agreement
by signing at the indicated portion and faxing it back to Panatron. Nuplex
would then ship the goods to Panatron CIF Singapore. At intervals of about
every quarter, Nuplex would send to Panatron the revised prices for their
products. On the face of it, each sale and purchase of the chemical resins was
pursuant to a separate and discrete contract.

7 On 6 August 1996 Yin met the Export Manager of Nuplex, Tony Leggett
("Leggett") for the first time when the latter visited them in Singapore. Yin
was instructed by Phua to arrange for Nuplex to place a "consignment" stock of
the goods. The presence of such a stock of the resins would prevent any
disruption of the manufacturing process, quite apart from not having to pay
for them just yet. The terms of the agreement were indicated in a fax dated 7
August 1996 which Nuplex sent to Panatron. The Fax was in these terms:

> "FURTHER TO YOUR DISCUSSION WITH MR LEGGETT HE HAS ADVISED THAT WE HAVE
> AGREED TO SEND 1 FCL TO YOU AS CONSIGNMENT STOCK. PLEASE BE ADVISED OF THE
> FOLLOWING TERMS FOR CONSIGNMENT STOCK;
>
> CONSIGNMENT STOCK WILL REMAIN THE PROPERTY OF NUPLEX INDUSTRIES LTD UNTIL
> SUCH TIME AS IT IS MUTUALLY AGREED TO TERMINATE THIS ARRANGEMENT. AT SUCH
> TIME PANATRON PTE LTD WILL PAY NUPLEX INDUSTRIES LTD FOR THIS STOCK AT THE
> MARKET PRICE PREVAILING AT THE TIME.
>
> CAN YOU PLEASE CONFIRM BY RETURN THAT YOU ARE AGREEABLE TO THE ABOVE
> TERMS…."

The fax then went on to discuss the arrangements for the shipment of the next
three full container loads under apparently 3 contracts for the sales of
goods.

8 By a letter transmitted on 9 August 1996 to Nuplex, Panatron referred to the
fax and went on to state as follows:

> "I confirm the following understanding:
>
> 1\. The 1 x FCL consignment stock will remain the property of Nuplex
> Industries Ltd.

> 2\. Panatron Pte Ltd will pay for the consignment stock at the prevailing
> market price at the end of this arrangement.

> I will send you a P.O. for the abovementioned FCL and advise the desired
> shipment ETA date."

9 By a Purchase Order of 14 August 1996 Panatron specified the details of the
consignment stock required. They required 24x200kg drums of PanVL (4.8 Mtons)
and 72x200kg (14.4 Mtons). It noted as follows: ‘CONSIGNMENT STOCK’ and the
further notation was: "No value or price attached as this shipment is for
consignment only." Under the Terms and Conditions, the following were agreed:

> "Prices : CIF Singapore, based on prevailing product prices at the time of
> the termination of the consignment agreement.
>
> Terms : L/C 60 days from the consignment agreement termination date.
>
> …
>
> ETA : Singapore 20 September 1996"

10 By early September 1996 it became apparent that the 1 full container loan
of chemical resins, which could meet Panatron’s manufacturing needs for about
a month, was insufficient. Phua then instructed Yin to obtain from Nuplex a
second FCL buffer stock. Yin obtained Leggett’s agreement and the second
buffer 1 FCL buffer stock was sent.

11 On 23 August 1997 Dettrick terminated the Licence Agreement with Panatron
for the reasons mentioned in the other judgment. After the cancellation of the
licence Panatron were no longer authorised to manufacture the Chemtour
products of Dettrick. Panatron therefore no longer had any need to use PANVL
or CHEMTEX.

12 By a letter of 10 September 1997 signed by Yin, Panatron informed Nuplex of
the amount of resins still held by the defendants and inquiring whether Nuplex
wished to invoice Panatron for the amount of the buffer stock used to date. As
for the balance of the stock, Yin asked whether he wanted to invoice Panatron
for the balance, nominate a third party and assign them the rights to the
stock, or dispose of it in any other way. He concluded by stating: "As the
stock with Panatron rightfully belongs to and is the property of Nuplex, I
await your feedback on how you (as the owner’s representative) wish to
proceed…" Yin explained in evidence that he wrote in this way, although
Panatron was obliged to pay, because he was hoping that Nuplex would pick one
of the other options he suggested. Nuplex’s response was to request for the
payment of US$12,468 for the stock used. As for the balance of the unused
stock, Nuplex said they would revert after they had found a warehouse. No
payment was made by Panatron.

The factual issues

13 Phua in his evidence claims that the introduction of Nuplex to Panatron in
August/September 1995 to supply of the unique chemicals was "part of the
technology transfer" by Dettrick under the Licence Agreement for Panatron’s
manufacture of the products known as NewFlex, NewFlex R100, Flexicote,
BlockFlex, Primer and Tuffcote. He further alleges that Nuplex (without naming
anybody from Nuplex) and Dettrick "represented to Panatron at the time of the
introduction that the chemicals were vital resin for Panatron’s manufacture of
the products "and also stated that (Nuplex) shall supply on a long term
basis." Phua, as if to fortify his assertions, claims that the chemical resins
"are unique in nature and substance" which Panatron would need on a long term
basis to enable them to manufacture the products.

14 Both Dettrick and Yin gave evidence which contradicted Phua’s version.
Leggett in his evidence said that the 2 resins are not unique in nature and
substance. In the manufacture of paints, coatings and similar products the
practice of the industry is to have alternative raw materials of all
components. This is a prudent measure to prevent disruptions or to prevent
exploitation. He points out that similar resins are available from 9 other
suppliers worldwide, including Hoechst AG, Eternal Chemicals, Taipei and so
on. Yin confirmed that Panatron was free to source for the resins from other
suppliers, after obtaining the approval of Dettrick who put in this
contractual requirement to ensure that quality control of the Chemtour
products was maintained.

15 I come now to the circumstances surrounding the cessation of supply by
Nuplex. In early September, 1997, according to Dettrick, he received a
telephone call from Leggett. Leggett informed him that he had received an
inquiry from a certain David Kinsman for Nuplex products. That was the first
time Dettrick had spoken to any employee of Nuplex. Other than this, Dettrick
had never maintained any contact with any employee of Nuplex. It was also
during this telephone conversation that Dettrick informed Leggett of the
termination of the Licence Agreement with Panatron. Leggett confirmed this
evidence.

16 As between Nuplex and Panatron, the payment for the consignment stock
became a bone of contention between the two parties. Panatron, through Phua,
declined to pay. He also declined to release the balance of the unused buffer
stock of the two resins. On 20 October 1997 Nuplex through their solicitors
terminated the ‘consignment’ arrangements and demanded the return of the
remaining unused stock from both Panatron and their warehouse keeper, Messrs
KNT Transport Services. Panatron refused to pay for the portion used and
declined to release the remaining buffer stock, alleging that Nuplex had
agreed to the long term supply of the two resins and that the consignment
arrangement was not terminable except with the consent of both parties.

****

My decisions

17 I turn to the first question: did Nuplex agree to supply the two resins in
perpetuity for so long as Panatron wanted, as asserted by Panatron in paras 1,
2, 3 and 5 of their Re-Amended Defence and Amended Counterclaim? In evaluating
the evidence, I am struck by the tenuous and tentative nature of Phua’s
evidence. He was unable to give direct evidence. Much of his evidence is
without basis. He is wrong to assert that the two resins are unique in
substance and in nature. He is wrong to say that they can only be obtained
from Nuplex. While I appreciate that sometimes facts are stranger than
fiction, I must say that in this instance, Phua has not convinced me that
there are any convincing circumstances which make it likely that Nuplex would
agree to what is, on the face of it, a rather burdensome obligation in
perpetuity. I am driven to reject his evidence. Leggett, Dettrick and Yin are
far more credible witnesses in contrast to Phua.

18 The next issue is a matter of construction of the two ‘contractual’ letters
and turns on the circumstances, if at all, under which the ‘consignment’
agreement could be terminated. Panatron assert that it is terminable only and
only if both parties agree. This is another way of saying that this was an
agreement which could not be terminated without the consent of Panatron. This
contention calls to mind the pragmatically wise dictum of Lord Reid in
_Wickman Tools v Schuler AG_ [1994] AC 235 at p 251 E: "The fact that a
particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant
consideration. The more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that
the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more necessary
it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear." Reading the two
letters between Nuplex and Panatron and evaluating the conflicting oral
evidence, there is, in my view, no justification to place too literal a
meaning to the phrase "mutually agreed" in Nuplex’s letter. That was an offer
of a term which was left unanswered by Yin in his reply. The single phrase is
far too narrow, and is certainly inapt, to express with sufficient clarity if
the mutual intention was that the buffer stock agreement was to be terminable
only with the consent of both parties. In my view, a reasonable construction
is to imply the term that the agreement was terminable on reasonable notice.
What is reasonable notice is in every case a question of fact. Panatron also
fail on this part of their claim.

19 Finally, I will deal with Phua’s allegation that Nuplex had colluded and
committed civil conspiracy with Dettrick to injure the interest of Panatron.
The allegation against Nuplex in the context of this case is so far fetched
that I am driven to remark that this notion is a figment of Phua’s fevered
imagination. Dettrick was never in contact with anybody of any authority in
Nuplex before the termination of his Licence Agreement with Panatron on 23
August 1997. There was no combination at all because the alleged civil
conspirators had never been in touch in any way at all material times. The
supply of the 2 chemical resins are easily available from many suppliers the
world over and there was no basis or motivation for any sort of conspiracy.

****

Conclusions

20 Accordingly, there must be judgment with costs on the High Court scale for
Nuplex in the sum of US$49,364.00 together with interest thereon at 6% p.a.
calculated from 28 November 1997, the date Nuplex commenced their suit in the
Subordinate Court. Panatron’s counterclaims are dismissed with costs.
