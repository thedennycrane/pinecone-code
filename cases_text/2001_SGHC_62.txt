: Specialty Laboratories International Ltd (`SLI`) is a company incorporated
in the British Virgin Islands. Specialty Laboratories Asia Pte Ltd (`SLA`) is
a company incorporated in Singapore. In Suit S32/2000/E, SLI claimed against
SLA the repayment of a loan. SLA did not enter appearance and on 22 March
2000, SLI entered judgment in default of appearance in the sum of
US$1,951,554.24 plus interest and costs.  
  
On 29 March 2000, SLI issued a statutory demand to SLA for the judgment sum
plus interest and costs and served it at the purported registered office of
SLA. SLI did not receive payment within the statutory three weeks and on 26
May 2000, in CWU 162/2000, they petitioned the court to wind up SLA. This was
also served on the purported registered office of SLA on 2 June 2000. On 14
July 2000, the court appointed provisional liquidators pending the hearing of
the winding up petition.  
  
Remedi Pharmaceuticals (M) Sdn Bhd (`RP`) is a company incorporated in
Malaysia. They are minority shareholders of SLA and hold 30% of the issued
share capital. They oppose the petition.  
  
This matter is fraught with allegations of fraud. SLI is the majority
shareholder of SLA, holding 60% of the total issued share capital. RP allege
that SLI, being both the controlling shareholder and the petitioning creditor,
had permitted SLA to be placed in a position where they are liable to be wound
up. RP submit that this is apparent from the fact that SLA allowed judgment in
default of appearance to be entered. RP had, on 21 June 2000, applied to the
court in OS 923/2000 for various orders for the purposes of intervening in
these winding up proceedings and to wrest control of SLA in order to set aside
the default judgment and defend that action. This matter is further
complicated by parallel proceedings in California. There, another creditor of
SLI, Mr Paul Fasi (`Fasi`), had applied ex parte for a receiver to be
appointed. On 28 April 2000, the Superior Court of California in the County of
San Diego appointed a receiver against the assets of SLI. Fasi is also an
opposing creditor in this petition.  
  
At the hearing for the winding up order on 21 December 2000, counsel for Fasi,
Mr Chacko, raised a preliminary objection to the application. After hearing
submissions of counsel for the parties, I upheld the objection and dismissed
the petition. I awarded costs on the standard basis against the petitioner in
favour of the opposing creditor, Fasi and minority shareholder, RP. On 19
January 2001, SLI appealed against my decision and I now give my written
grounds.  
  
**_incorrectly sent to me_**** _Specialty Laboratories Asia Pte Ltd is not
located at this address_** Mr Chacko`s objection pertains to the service of
the statutory demand of 29 March 2000. It was addressed to and served on
**_105 The Inglewood, Singapore 575112_** (`the Inglewood`). Although this was
the address that appeared in the records of the Registry of Companies &
Businesses (`RCB`) at the material time as the registered office of SLA, Mr
Chacko submitted that it was in fact not the registered office of SLA and SLI
was aware, or ought to be aware, of this fact. From the affidavits the
following facts emerged.

(i) On 2 February 2000, a notice of change of registered office (Form 44A) was
lodged with the RCB. It was dated 24 January 2000 and gave notice to the
registrar that the registered office of SLA would be at the Inglewood with
effect from 1 January 2000. The notice was signed by one Dr James Bernard
Peter (`Peter`) in his capacity as a director of SLA.

(ii) Peter has effective control of both SLI and SLA through his shareholdings
in them.

(iii) There was no evidence of any resolution passed by the board of directors
of SLA in respect of this purported change of registered office.

(iv) At the material time, there were only two directors in the board of SLA,
Peter and one Miss Ng Wai Fun (`Ng`). Ng was not aware of this purported
change of registered office on 2 February 2000. The Inglewood is in fact Ng`s
residence.

(v) Even when the petition was served on her residence on 29 March 2000, Ng
was not aware that a notice had been filed in respect of the change of
registered office. Ng deposed that she was shocked to receive at her home in
the Inglewood on 7 March 2000 a letter of demand from SLI`s solicitors for
payment of the debt. This was followed by a writ of summons on 11 March.

(vi) Ng said that on 14 March 2000, she returned the letter of demand and the
writ to SLI`s solicitors with a letter stating that they were `. `.

(vii) Ng deposed that on 29 March 2000, she received the statutory demand
which was served on her residence at the Inglewood. A copy of the judgment
entered against SLA was also served on her residence. She was still puzzled as
to why these documents should be addressed to her home. Ng`s affidavit is
silent as to whether she returned these documents to SLI`s solicitors. There
is no submission from counsel for SLI that she had sent the statutory demand
to any of the other directors or officers of SLA. Indeed, the implication from
the rest of Ng`s affidavit is that she did not. This is because she had stated
elsewhere in her affidavit that she had forwarded other documents to Bart
Thielen, the then managing director of SLA, including the winding-up petition.
Therefore, I find as a fact that Ng did not send the statutory demand to any
of the other officers of SLA.  
  
I now turn to the relevant law. Section 142 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994
Ed) (`the Act`) requires a company to have, from its date of incorporation, a
registered office to which all communications and notices may be addressed.
This section states as follows:

> _
>
> (1) A company shall as from the date of its incorporation have a registered
> office within Singapore to which all communications and notices may be
> addressed and which shall be open and accessible to the public for not less
> than 3 hours during ordinary business hours on each day, Saturdays, weekly
> and public holidays excepted.
>
> (2) If default is made in complying with subsection (1), the company and
> every officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence
> and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and also to
> a default penalty.
>
> _

  
  
Under s 143, the registrar must be notified within 14 days of any change in
the address of the registered office. The relevant part of s 143 provides as
follows:

> _
>
> (1) **_Notice_** in the prescribed form **_of the situation of the
> registered office_** , the days and hours during which it is open and
> accessible to the public, **_shall_** , in the case of a proposed company,
> **_be lodged with the Registrar_** together with its memorandum and its
> articles, if any, at the time of lodgment for the incorporation of the
> proposed company **_and in the case of any subsequent change of the
> particulars therein be so lodged within 14 days of any such change_** , ...
>
> (1A) In subsection (1), **_the word "particulars_** ", in relation to the
> situation of the registered office, **_shall be deemed to include the_**
> address and designation of the situation or **_address of the registered
> office_**. [Emphasis is added.]
>
> _

  
  
The company is obliged to maintain an agent at the registered office and this
is provided for in s 171(3) which states as follows:

> _The secretary or secretaries shall be appointed by the directors and at
> least one of those secretaries shall be present at the registered office of
> the company by himself or his agent or clerk on the days and at the hours
> during which the registered office is to be accessible to the public._

  
  
It is clear from these provisions that a registered office is required to be
established by a company incorporated under the Act for the purpose of service
of all communications and notices. To this end, the company is obliged to keep
such office open for a minimum number of hours on each weekday and have
someone there who can receive any notices or documents on behalf of the
company. There are many provisions in the Act that deem delivery of a document
on the registered office to be sufficient service on the company for various
purposes. In the present case, for example, s 254(2)(a) deems a company to be
unable to pay its debts if a statutory demand has been served on it by leaving
it at its registered office and the debt is not paid, secured or compounded
within three weeks.  
  
The first question is whether the registered office of SLA was changed prior
to 2 February 2000 when the Form 44A notice was lodged with the RCB. There was
no board resolution to change the existing registered office to the Inglewood.
The case of **Ross v Invergordon Distillers** [1961] SLT 358 involved a
company that changed its registered office to another location. The directors
of the company had resolved at a meeting to remove the registered office but
this was not notified to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with the
Companies Act before a writ was served at the original registered office. The
Scottish Court of Session held that the writ was regular because the
registered office was not effectively changed within the meaning of the
Companies Act until the statutory notice to the registrar has been given. Lord
President Clyde said at p 360:

> _Although the directors had at [the date of service of the writ] resolved to
> change the registered office, they had not effectively done so. For, in my
> view, the new office cannot be the registered office until the statutory
> machinery of intimation to the registrar has been carried out ..._

> _In my view, there is not a registered office within the meaning of the
> Companies Act until,**not merely have the directors resolved where the
> office is to be** , but the statutory notice to the registrar has been
> given. It is then, and then only, that the company`s registered office is
> `registered` or, if a change has been made, is changed. Till intimation of a
> change, the creditors and others dealing with the company are entitled to
> assume that the registered office remains where it originally was and it is
> only when the necessary steps have been taken to inform the registrar of the
> change, so that he may record the same in terms of section 17, that the
> original registered office ceases to be the registered office of the
> company. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
This decision was cited with approval and applied by the High Court in **Re
Shangri-la Cruise** [1990] SLR 799  [1991] 1 MLJ 22  
  
The present case involves the reverse situation. Here, there was no resolution
passed to effect the change of registered office, but the statutory notice was
given of a purported change. Lord President Clyde had said in **_Ross v
Invergordon Distillers_** that there are two conditions precedent to an
effective change of address of the registered office, viz (i) a directors`
resolution to make the change; and (ii) statutory notification being made. It
follows that failure of the first condition renders the change ineffective,
subject to any overriding principle (which I shall consider below).  
  
The first condition really pertains to the power to change the registered
office. This power is vested in and exercisable by the board of directors. It
is only if the board have delegated such power to any person that he may
change the registered office without a resolution. However, counsel for the
petitioning creditors, Mr Lim, did not submit that such power was delegated to
Peter, the director of SLA, who filed the statutory notice. Indeed, there is
no evidence that this had been done. Instead, Mr Lim relies on the rule in
**Turquand** (Unreported) **Royal British Bank v Turquand** (Unreported) ) and
argued that the petitioners are entitled to rely on the address of the
registered office of SLA that is found in the RCB records. This is the
overriding principle that I have alluded to in the preceding paragraph.
However, this rule is only a presumption of regularity that a third party, who
would not be in a position to ascertain whether the company had properly
carried out the necessary procedural matters, is entitled to rely on. SLI is
far from being a third party in this matter. Indeed, Peter, who is the
controlling mind of the both SLI and SLA, was the person who filed the notice
of change of registered office. He was responsible for the irregularity. And
SLI is the controlling shareholder of SLA. In the circumstances, SLI cannot
rely on this presumption. Moreover, the petitioners` arguments cannot be
sustained from the point of view of the one of the objectives of the
registered office scheme, which is to enable documents served on a company to
be brought to the attention of their management. This was not done in this
case because on Ng`s evidence, the statutory demand was not forwarded to nor
brought to the attention of those in control of SLA. While the law will hold
that an unrelated third party is entitled to rely on the address of the
registered office on record in the RCB, in the circumstances of the present
case, SLI will be denied recourse to this presumption.  
  
It therefore follows that the statutory demand was not validly served on SLA
pursuant to s 254(2)(a) because it was not left at the registered office of
the company. Accordingly, s 254(2)(a) does not operate to deem SLA to be
unable to pay its debts and the petitioner`s application, which is based on
this provision, fails. As for costs, I see no reason why it should not follow
the event and awarded the opposing creditor, Fasi, and minority shareholders,
RP, their costs on a standard basis, to be paid by the petitioners.  
  
**Outcome:**

Petition dismissed.
