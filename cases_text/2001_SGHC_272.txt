**Judgment:**

1\. The plaintiffs, AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty Ltd (hereinafter
referred to as "AFM 2000"), contended that their former sales and handling
agents for sea freight, the defendants, Freight Links Express Ltd (hereinafter
referred to as "FLE"), caused them loss by wrongfully withholding their cargo
and by failing and/or refusing to carry out their contractual obligations to
tranship or deliver cargo forwarded to them. FLE denied having breached their
contractual obligations and made a counterclaim for the sum of US$635,165.30,
which they claimed was owed to them by AFM 2000.

****

A. BACKGROUND

2\. Until August 2000, FLE and another company, AFS Freight Management Pty Ltd
(hereinafter referred to as "AFS") had an agency arrangement, under which both
companies agreed to act as exclusive agents for each other in sea freight
consolidation services between Australia and Singapore. AFS owed FLE more than
S$1m for services rendered under the agency arrangement.

3\. In early 2000, AFS wanted to sell their assets and goodwill. Discussions
were held with the New American Consolidators Association (hereinafter
referred to as "NACA") and it was finally agreed that Trident Logistics (Aust)
Pty Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Trident"), a company within the NACA
Group, would acquire the fixed assets and goodwill of the AFS Group. The
acquisition, which was concluded on 18 August 2000, did not involve the taking
over of the AFS Group’s debts.

4\. After the completion of the purchase, Trident incorporated a new company,
AFM 2000, to run the business of sea freight consolidation previously
conducted by AFS. This new company, which was keen to continue AFS’ business
links with FLE, proposed that a new agency agreement with FLE be signed. The
agreement, which was left with FLE, was never signed. However, it is pertinent
to note that FLE adopted the freight rates stipulated in the unsigned
agreement in their dealings with AFM 2000.

5\. FLE asserted that the AFS representatives and NACA’s own representatives
represented to them that AFM 2000 would assume the massive debt (hereinafter
referred to as "the AFS debt") owed to them by the AFS group. They contended
that on the basis that AFM 2000 would be liable for the AFS debt, they did
business with AFM 2000. However, AFM 2000 asserted that it was made clear to
FLE that Trident had merely purchased the business assets of the AFS Group and
that there was no transfer of the liabilities and/or debts of the AFS Group.

6\. In the early part of 2001, FLE realised that the AFS Group was in
liquidation. Relations between FLE and AFM 2000 took a turn for the worse.
According to AFM 2000, their customers started to complain from late February
to March 2001 that consignments that had been shipped with them, and which had
been forwarded to FLE as far back as January 2000, had not arrived at their
intended final destination. AFM 2000 asserted that FLE’s unreasonable conduct
exposed them to potential claims from their customers. After paying FLE around
US$41,000, which FLE claimed was owed to them for services rendered, and a
further sum under protest with respect to storage charges for the detained
goods, the goods in question were finally released.

**

B. THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM AGAINST FLE

FOR WRONGFUL DETENTION OF CARGO

__

**

7\. AFM 2000’s claim against FLE centres around the consequences of what they
claimed was the wrongful detention of their cargo in the first quarter of
2001. They asserted that whatever grouses FLE may have had against them, there
was no justification for the detention of the cargo forwarded to FLE under
agreed agency arrangements. AFM 2000 thus sought the following:

> > (a) a declaration that FLE acted in breach of contract when they detained
> the cargo in question;
>>

>> (b) damages for breach of contract; and

>>

>> (c) the refund of the sum paid by them under protest for storage charges
for the detained cargo.

8\. FLE initially contended that they were not in breach when they detained
AFM 2000’s cargo because they had not been paid for their services under the
agency arrangements with AFM 2000. However, FLE’s senior vice-president, Mr
Alex Ng, conceded during the trial that his company had acted without
justification when they detained the said cargo. When cross-examined and when
he was questioned by me, he said as follows:

> Q. I put it to you that FLE had no basis to withhold cargo shipped to them
> by the plaintiffs in March 2001. Do you agree?
>
> A. I agree.

Ct. You agree with the plaintiffs’ counsel that what FLE did was wrong?

A. Yes.

9\. When FLE’s counsel, Mr Francis Goh, gave him an opportunity during re-
examination to clarify his position, Mr Alex Ng reiterated that FLE had no
right to detain the cargo in question when he said as follows:

> Q. It was put to you that you had no basis for withholding the cargo in
> March 2001. You said that you agreed. Would you like to clarify the position
>
> A. I stand by my earlier answer.

10\. Whether or not Mr Ng conceded the point, there can be no doubt that FLE’s
detention of AFM 2000’s cargo cannot be justified. FLE admitted that they gave
AFM 2000 no notice whatsoever of their intention not to handle any more of the
latter’s goods. Mr Alex Ng said as follows during cross-examination:

> Q. Prior to taking action to withhold AFM 2000’s cargo, did FLE inform the
> latter that they would do so if no money was forthcoming?

    1. No.

>   17. AFM 2000 would have assumed that you would deal with their cargo as
> you had always done?
>

    1. Yes.

>   17. If you were going to hold their cargo, why did you not inform AFM 2000
> about that?
>

>   1. I am not certain about that.
>

Q. You are a senior management person representing your company at this trial
and yet you are unable to say why no warning was issued to AFM 2000 that you
would withhold their cargo?

>

> A. I cannot comment on that.

11\. I thus hold that FLE breached their contractual obligations when they
detained AFM 2000’s cargo. Damages will be assessed by the Registrar. AFM 2000
are also entitled to a refund of the storage charges paid by them to FLE under
protest to secure the release of their cargo and to costs.

****

C. FLE’S COUNTERCLAIM

12\. I now turn to FLE’s counterclaim, which relates to the allegation that
AFM 2000 is responsible for the AFS debt of more than S$1m. FLE’s case, as
pleaded, is that around August 2000, Mr Steve Reison, AFS’ managing director
and subsequently AFM 2000’s chief operating officer, represented to them that
the following terms will govern the future relationship between FLE and AFM
2000:

> > (a) AFM 2000 shall represent the AFS Group of Companies and FLE shall
> represent the Freight Links Group of Companies;
>>

>> (b) AFM 2000 will be responsible for and settle the debts of the AFS
companies; and

>>

>> (c) AFM 2000 will make payments promptly when due for all new business.

13\. FLE also asserted that in or about October 2000, two representatives of
NACA and AFM 2000, namely Mr Bob Hackett, AFM 2000’s managing director, and Mr
Pece Gorgievski, the then vice-president of business development in the NACA
Group, made the following representations to them:

> > (a) NACA were effectively the new owners of AFS;
>>

>> (b) NACA wanted FLE to continue as AFM 2000’s agents in Singapore;

>>

>> (c) NACA was aware of the substantial debts owed by AFS to them and AFM
2000 will be responsible for settling the debts; and

> (d) FLE will continue to work closely with Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott
> Bell.

14\. I have no hesitation in rejecting FLE’s assertion that AFM 2000 had
agreed to be responsible for the AFS debt for a number of reasons. FLE’s
witnesses contradicted one another and their hesitant answers did not convince
me that their case rested on solid ground. To begin with, FLE’s evidence as to
when the alleged representations were made leaves much to be desired.
Initially, they asserted that they relied on representations made to them in
July 2000 and that these representations were subsequently repeated in
writing. These assertions were contained in a letter from their solicitors,
Ari, Goh & Partners, to AFM 2000’s solicitors, Drew & Napier LLC, on 23 March
2001. The relevant parts of this letter are as follows:

> > 2\. The AFS companies, in the course of their dealings with our clients
> incurred total debts which presently amount to in excess of $1,000,000.
>>

>> 3\. In about July 2000, it was intimated by Mr Steve Reison and Scott Bell,
who are presently with your clients that there was a change of ownership in
the AFS group and that Australian Freight Services Ltd was to be renamed …
[AFM 2000] … to manage the operations of the group. Our clients were given at
the point to understand that they were dealing in effect with the same parties
and that the changes were in line with the reorganisation being effected
within the group. These oral representations were subsequently followed up in
writing.

>>

>> 4\. It was further represented by Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott Bell … [that
AFM 2000] would continue to be responsible for the existing debts of the AFS
companies ….

>>

>> 5\. Our clients continued their business on the basis of the aforesaid. It
transpired in about early March 2001 that the AFS companies were being placed
under receivership …. Our clients have come to know that the AFS companies and
[AFM 2000] are controlled by the same parties.

>>

>> 6\. Our clients are by reason of the aforesaid facts entitled to lift the
corporate veil vis--vis the aforesaid companies to show that they are owned
and controlled by common parties. They will be making a claim against [AFM
2000] for the entirety of the sums due to them.

15\. A comparison of the contents of the above letter and FLE’s pleaded case
will reveal fundamental flaws in FLE’s position. Contrary to what was asserted
in Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001, FLE conceded during the trial
that no representations were made in writing and no serious attempt was made
during the trial to pierce the corporate veil.

16\. Secondly, although Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001 referred
to representations that were made in July 2000, FLE’s Defence and Counterclaim
did not refer to any such representations. Instead, reliance was placed on
alleged representations made by Mr Steve Reison in August 2000 and by a NACA
team in October 2000.

17\. A question arises as to why the alleged representations that were
allegedly made by Mr Steve Reison in August 2000 and by NACA’s representatives
in October 2000 were not referred to in Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23
March 2001\. That the alleged representations by NACA’s representatives are
important to FLE’s case was conceded by Mr Alex Ng, FLE’s senior vice-
president, who said as follows during cross-examination:

> > Q. The understanding reached with NACA’s representatives in October 2000
> is an important part of FLE’s position that AFM 2000 had taken
> responsibility for payment of the AFS debt to FLE?
>>

>> A. Yes….

18\. Mr Ng could not shed any light as to why the important October 2000
meeting with NACA representatives and the August 2000 meeting with Mr Steve
Reison were not referred to in Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001.
When cross-examined, he merely said as follows:

> > Q. Given that the entire basis of FLE’s claim is based on representations
> made in August and October 2000, can you explain why no reference was made
> to those representations in this letter?
>>

>> A. I have no explanation.

19\. Apart from being unsure about when the misrepresentation of facts was
made, FLE was also unclear as to what had been allegedly misrepresented. FLE
was clutching at straws when they said that AFM 2000 must be taken to have
assumed liability for the AFS debt because they had been told that it was
"business as usual" and that after the formation of AFM 2000, Mr Steve
Reison’s business card was similar to that used by him when he was in AFS. The
words "business as usual", if used, must be read in their proper context. More
importantly, FLE’s allegation that they thought that it was "business as
usual" because Mr Hackett had represented to them in October 2000 that FLE
could continue to work with AFS’ stalwarts, Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott Bell,
cannot be believed. It is most unlikely that Mr Hackett would have represented
to FLE that Mr Bell would be working with FLE for the simple reason that the
latter did not join AFM 2000 or NACA. In any case, it is rather odd that after
having asserted that FLE felt reassured that they could continue to work with
Mr Scott Bell, FLE’s Mr Alex Ng denied any knowledge of the fact that Mr Bell
was not part of the AFM 2000 team. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> > Q. You were assured that FLE could work with Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott
> Bell?
>>

>> A. With both of them.

>>

>> Q. How could that be when Mr Scott Bell did not join AFM 2000 or NACA?

>>

>> A. I am not aware of that.

>>

>> Q. Did you ever deal with Mr Scott Bell after August 2000?

>>

>> A. No.

>>

>> Q. In that case, you must have known that Mr Scott Bell had no role to play
in the new company?

>>

>> A. I am not aware of his specific role in AFM 2000.

20\. It is important to note that Mr Alex Ng finally conceded that as far as
he was concerned, it was his own perception that AFM 2000 had assumed
liability for the AFS debt. When questioned by me, he said as follows:

> > Ct. Did Mr Reison tell you that AFM 2000 were going to pay the AFS debt?

A. No.

> > Ct. Is it your own understanding that AFM 2000 will pay the AFS debt?

A. Yes.

21\. Apart from the uncertainties regarding the time and nature of the alleged
representations made by AFM 2000, FLE did not act as if they really believed
that AFM 2000 were responsible for the AFS debt. From the time FLE commenced
business with AFM 2000 in August 2000, no notice was served on AFM 2000
regarding the amount owed by AFS until after AFS had gone into liquidation.
Admittedly, Mr Lee Hock Seng, FLE’s assistant vice-president, claimed that
before Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001 was sent to AFM 2000’s
solicitors, FLE had informed AFM 2000 of the amount owed by AFS. When cross-
examined, he asserted as follows:

> > Q. Do you have any documentary evidence that prior to the letter of 2001,
> the plaintiffs were informed of the debt of the AFS Group?
>>

>> A. There were letters from our financial controller.

>>

>> Q. Are any of these letters in evidence?

>>

>> A. They are with our financial controller.

>>

>> Q _. Is it your personal evidence that letters were sent to the plaintiffs,
demanding payment of the debts of the AFS Group?_

>>

>> A _. Yes._

(emphasis added)

22\. Mr Alex Ng also asserted that FLE had sent AFM 2000 monthly statements
with respect to the AFS debt. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> > Q. Is there any documentary evidence to show that before your lawyers
> wrote a letter of demand, FLE informed AFM 2000 of the amount owed by AFS?

> A. No, not that I know of.

> > Q. I put it to you that no statement of accounts was sent to AFM 2000 with
> respect to the AFS debt because they did not assume AFS’ liability.

> A. We have monthly statements sent to overseas trading partners.

Q. You just said that FLE did not send AFM 2000 any documentary statement on
the amount owed by AFS.

A. I was talking about a letter of demand. We sent monthly statements of
accounts of the amount owed by AFS to AFM 2000.

23\. FLE’s financial controller, Mr Thomas Woo, contradicted Mr Lee and Mr Ng.
When cross-examined, he stated that he took no steps to inform AFM 2000 about
the AFS debt because "internal senior people assumed the responsibility of
collecting the debt". That no statement of accounts relating to the AFS debt
was ever sent to AFM 2000 is patently clear from the following position taken
by Mr Woo during cross-examination:

> > Q. From August 2000 until the matter became a legal problem, no demand was
> made to AFM 2000 for payment of this large debt of $1m.
>>

>> A. No demand was made.

>>

>> Q. From August 2000 to March 2001, you never sent a notice of demand to AFM
2000 to show that they owed the debt of $1m?

>>

>> A. No.

24\. Apart from not demanding from AFM 2000 the amount owed by AFS until after
the latter had gone into liquidation, FLE’s senior vice-president, Mr Alex Ng,
agreed with AFM 2000’s managing director, Mr Bob Hackett, in March 2001 that
the total amount owed by AFM 2000 to FLE was only around US$41,000. On 12
March 2001, Mr Hackett wrote to Mr Ng as follows:

> > I understand your position has been that AFS Freight Management 2000 had
> owed FLE around USD41,000 and therefore had exceeded your credit limit, so
> that bookings were blocked by your system. Further, I understand that all
> you desire is that we pay each other what we owe, and move on. This is all
> we want as well.

25\. On 13 March 2001, Mr Ng replied to Mr Hackett as follows:

> > As you correctly said, our position has been that [AFM 2000] is owing
> [FLE] about US$41,000 plus, details of which have been given to you. If you
> are agreeable to this amount, please arrange to settle this urgently.

26\. Mr Ng made no reference whatsoever to the AFS debt when he stated that
FLE’s position has been that AFM 2000 owed FLE around US$41,000. AFM 2000 paid
the sum claimed by FLE even though they thought that the amount should have
been a little less. FLE is in no position now to say that the AFS debt was not
included in Mr Ng’s confirmation of the amount owed by AFM 2000.

27\. If one looks at the whole picture squarely, much as AFM 2000 wanted to
have a business relationship with FLE, there was no reason for them to cripple
themselves by assuming liability for the AFS debt, which amounted to more than
S$1m. In paras 11-13 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Steve Reison,
AFM 2000’s chief operating officer and the man accused of having represented
to FLE that the AFS debt would be paid by the new company, stated as follows:

> > 11\. Immediately following the conclusion of the purchase of the AFS Group
> by Trident, AFS sent a written announcement out to all customers, vendors
> and agents, advising them of the changes arising from the purchase and how
> the accounting was to be treated….
>>

>> 12\. The announcement made clear that notwithstanding the sale, all
transactions prior to 31 July 2000 would remain the responsibility of AFS.

>>

>> 13\. As the Defendants were agents of AFS, the fax announcement would have
been sent to the Defendants. In addition, I personally followed up with
several telephone calls thereafter to one Wang Tek Lee from the Defendants.
During those phone calls, I advised the Defendants again that neither Trident
nor the Plaintiffs were responsible for the debts owed by AFS prior to 31 July
2000.

28\. The announcement, which was sent to FLE, was in the following terms:

> > We are pleased to announce that effective from 1st August 2000 AFS has
> undergone a change of ownership and has joined the N.A.C.A. (New American
> Consolidators Association) organization.
>>

>> This change of ownership will also change our trading name to:

>>

>> AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty Ltd

>>

>> The previous structure of AFS Freight Forwarding operations, offices and
personnel will remain unchanged and it is business as usual….

>>

>> All invoices and credit notes up to 31st July 2000 in the name of [AFS]
will continue to be processed and reconciled from Brisbane and we would ask
that you refer any matters on this to:

>>

>> AFS Freight Management Pty Ltd

>>

>> [Queensland]

>>

>> All invoices and credit notes for business arriving 1st August 2000 and
thereafter will be finalised in the name of the new company and we would ask
that you issue invoices/credit notes to the relevant office of [AFM 2000] as
shown below. All shipment documentation, bills of lading, and airway bills are
also to be issued to AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty Ltd.

29\. I have no doubt that this announcement did not put the position clearly.
Mr Bob Hackett was honest enough to concede that the above-mentioned
announcement regarding the setting up of AFM 2000 and the treatment of
accounts with effect from 1 August 2000 could have been more clearly worded.
However, he asserted that whatever ambiguities may have remained after the
announcement, they were cleared up soon enough. When cross-examined, he said
as follows:

> > I can understand that if the announcement was the only communication that
> took place with the agents, there could be a misunderstanding. The reality
> of the situation was that all the announcements were followed by personal
> dialogue, telephone calls and other communications that I believed clarified
> with potential partners that this was a goodwill purchase and that the AFS
> debts were not acquired by the new company.

30\. Mr Hackett testified that he personally explained the position to FLE
when he came to Singapore in October 2000 and that the FLE team fully
understood the implications of their relationship with AFM 2000. When cross-
examined, he said as follows:

> > I went into more details in the October meeting. I told the defendants
> that Trident had purchased the business and not the company and that it had
> set up a new company to handle its business. I asked them if they understood
> and they said ‘yes’. I further explained that acquisition did not include
> debtors or creditors. Mr Wang said that he understood and accepted that. He
> said that there were some outstanding debts but I told them that they had to
> discuss these debts with the directors of the old company, Mr Reison and Mr
> Bell. That was the end of the discussion. It was not a long discussion.

31\. Mr Hackett’s account of what transpired at the October 2000 meeting was
supported by Mr Pece Gorgievski, who categorically denied that representations
had been made to FLE that AFM 2000 would assume liability for the AFS debt.

32\. Taking all circumstances into account, there can be no doubt that the
evidence of AFM 2000’s witnesses is more credible than that of FLE’s
witnesses. As FLE has not discharged the burden of proving that
representations were made to them that AFM 2000 would take over the AFS debt,
their counterclaim against AFM 2000 is dismissed with costs.
