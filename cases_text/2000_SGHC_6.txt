**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT**

1 The parties were married at the Singapore Marriage Registry on 12 May 1975
under the provisions of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353).

2 They have two children, namely:

> (i) Tan Keng Ann, female, born on 4 February 1977 (‘the daughter’).
>
> (ii) Tan Teng Luck, male, born on 15 January 1980 (‘the son’).

3 On 28 February 1996, the Petitioner filed the petition for divorce on
grounds of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Respondent. The
Petitioner’s complaints of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the
Respondent included that of the latter’s adultery with one Majid and her
assault on him with a belt.

4 On 28 October 1998, I granted the Petitioner a decree nisi dissolving the
said marriage with ancillary issues relating to custody, care and control of
the two children, division of matrimonial assets and maintenance adjourned for
hearing in chambers

5 On custody, when the ancillary issues came before me for hearing, the
daughter was already over 21 years old and had chosen to live with the
Petitioner. Accordingly, no order on custody was made regarding the daughter.
In the case of the son, I made an order of joint custody. Pending his ‘O’
level examination, the son will continue to live with the Respondent at Block
8, Ghim Moh Road, #05-277, Singapore (‘the matrimonial flat’) because it is
nearer to his school than 46B Holland Grove Road, Singapore where the
Petitioner lives. I gave the parties liberty to apply.

6 On division of matrimonial assets, I made the following orders:

> (i) The Respondent is to transfer her interest in the matrimonial flat to
> Petitioner.
>
> (ii) The Respondent is to transfer her interest in Block 1, Jalan Bukit
> Merah, #01-4518, Singapore (‘the Bukit Merah Clinic’) to the Petitioner with
> the Petitioner assuming responsibility for the outstanding balance of the
> mortgage loan.
>
> (iii) The Petitioner is to retain his business of ‘Khye Hua Chinese
> Physician’ and other assets in his sole name.
>
> (iv) The Respondent is to retain the following:
>

>> (a) Block 21, Ghim Moh Road, #01-181, Singapore (‘Ghim Moh Shophouse’).

>>

>> (b) No. 20, Jalan Timah 8, Johore, Malaysia.

>>

>> (c) No. 63, Jalan Timah 8, Johore, Malaysia.

>>

>> (d) #02-07, Batam Square, Batam, Indonesia.

>

>> (e) #02-25, Batam Square, Batam, Indonesia.

>>

>> (f) Monies withdrawn by her from the DBS accounts.

>>

>> (g) The business of Volks Florists and Gifts.

>>

>> (h) All shares and insurance policies in her sole name.

>>

>> (i) Whatever other assets in her sole name. This includes balances in the
bank accounts in her name.

7 On maintenance, the Petitioner is to pay the Respondent $400 a month for her
maintenance and upkeep with effect from 1 October 1999. The Petitioner is also
to pay $350 a month to the Respondent with effect from 1 October 1999 for the
maintenance and upkeep of the son so long as he resides with her. In addition,
the Petitioner is to pay for the son’s education and his personal expenses
with a daily allowance. These may be paid direct to the son.

8 On costs of the ancillary proceedings, I awarded the Petitioner two-thirds
of the taxed costs.

9 The Respondent has appealed to the Court of Appeal against my orders on
division of the matrimonial assets, maintenance and costs. I now give my
reasons. To avoid confusion, the Respondent, now the appellant in the appeal,
will continue to be referred to as the Respondent and the Petitioner will
continue to be referred to as the Petitioner.

_**

The background

**_

10 The Petitioner is the holder of a Higher School Certificate. The Respondent
obtained a certificate in art from the Baharuddin Vocational Institute.

11 After leaving school, the Petitioner worked as an assistant manager from
1970 to 1971 in Mono Trading Company, which was his uncle’s sole
proprietorship firm. He was paid $400 a month. When Mono Trading Company was
converted to a private limited company known as Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd,
the Petitioner was promoted to manager. He left Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd
sometime in 1979. His last drawn salary was $800 a month. From the date of the
marriage in 1975, the Petitioner’s salaries went into the pool from which
drawings were made for the family’s expenses, investments and savings.

12 While working for his uncle, the Petitioner learned from his younger
brother who was the section lead of the Anglo Chinese School band that the
band needed uniforms for its members. Through the introduction of his brother,
the Petitioner obtained the order from the band’s teacher in charge to supply
the uniforms. The order was subcontracted and satisfactorily fulfilled. From
this, the Petitioner saw the potential in starting a family business to supply
uniforms and costumes to schools. This led to the Petitioner setting up Volks
International Enterprise after discussions with the Respondent.

13 Volks International Enterprise was registered in 1975 with the Respondent
as sole proprietress. I accepted the Petitioner’s explanation that this was
because he was still working for Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd. The registered
address of the firm was 73 Ming Teck Park, Singapore, which was his father’s
home. It was later changed to 72 Circular Road which was his father’s clinic
and medicine shop. His father is a Chinese physician. It was the Petitioner
who came up with the name and who arranged for the firm’s letterhead to be
designed by one of his friends. It was through the efforts of the Petitioner
that the firm obtained orders from the Extra-Curricular Activities Centre of
the Ministry of Education for supplying uniforms and costumes to schools for
the Youth Festival. Having had her training in art, the Respondent worked as
the designer, with the Petitioner overseeing the management and business
aspects of the firm.

14 The Petitioner’s participation in the business is confirmed by invoices
with the Petitioner’s handwritten notes on them. The Petitioner also signed
off as Manager.

15 Although the Respondent was the designer, not much creative designing for
uniforms and costumes was required, especially for uniforms as the designs
were pre-determined by the schools. When they went to the schools to obtain
the orders, the Respondent would take the measurements and the Petitioner
would do the recording. He would then sort out the measurements, obtain
samples of textiles, confirm orders for materials and purchases, make
arrangement to subcontract the orders, collect and deliver the uniforms and
bank in payments received.

16 In 1979, they decided to go into the garment business as well. So they set
up Volks Fashion House. It was also registered with the Respondent as sole
proprietress because the Petitioner was still working for Mono Trading Company
Pte Ltd. Shortly thereafter, the Petitioner resigned from Mono Trading Company
Pte Ltd to attend fulltime to the two family businesses. His responsibilities
included taking orders, pricing the goods, displaying the goods, attending to
customers, sales and purchasing, supervising staff, stock-checking and
finance. He even typed some of the invoices.

17 The activities of both businesses were largely seasonal. In order to have
an even spread throughout the year, the Petitioner set up Aya Business Company
in 1981 with himself as sole proprietor. Its business was in wholesale supply
of garments imported by Volks International Enterprise.

18 The profits from these family businesses were drawn to maintain the family,
and the excess channeled into savings and investments.

19 In the meantime, although the Petitioner had resigned from Mono Trading
Company Pte Ltd, he remained a guarantor for the company’s bank facilities at
his uncle’s request. When his uncle became ill with cancer, the company was
unable to pay its debts. The Petitioner as the guarantor for its debts was
accordingly made a bankrupt in 1983. Because of his bankruptcy, Aya Business
Company closed down.

20 From 1984 to 1986, the Petitioner took up a part-time job at Robert &
Stanley Credit Corporation while he continued to manage Volks International
Enterprise and Volks Fashion House. He was paid by Robert & Stanley Credit
Corporation a salary of $1000 with commission averaging $500 per month. He
paid monthly $70 to the Official Assignee and the balance was deposited into
the Respondent’s bank account and/or went towards helping to pay for the
family’s expenses.

21 For two years from 1984, he also helped out at a bean sprout factory at
night between 11.00 pm and 1.00 am. His earnings of about $2000 to $3000 a
month were paid to Volks International Enterprise because he was still a
bankrupt.

22 In 1990, the Petitioner started working at his father’s clinic as a Chinese
physician. At the same time, he took a part-time course in Chinese medicine,
attending classes three nights a week. He was paid $2000 a month by his
father. He maintained his family with his salaries while continuing to help in
the two family businesses on a part-time basis.

23 From 1993 to 1995, the Petitioner set up his own practice as a Chinese
physician under the name and style of ‘Tan Khye Hua Chinese Physician’.
Because he was still a bankrupt, the business was registered with the
Respondent as the sole proprietress. His earnings as a Chinese physician also
went into the pool from which funds were drawn for the family’s expenses and
investments or accumulated as savings.

24 In 1995, after his discharge from bankruptcy, the Petitioner requested the
Respondent to transfer to him the business name registration of ‘Tan Khye Hua
Chinese Physician’, the Respondent refused. The Petitioner then registered his
own sole proprietorship ‘Khye Hua Chinese Physician’ under which he now
practises as a Chinese physician.

25 The matrimonial flat. It was purchased on 1 October 1976 for $35,500 plus
$1089 for stamp fees. It was paid for with a cash payment of $2190, a sum of
$9399 from the Petitioner’s Central Provident Fund (‘CPF’) account and the
balance with a loan of $25,000 from the Housing & Development Board (‘HDB’).
The loan has been fully repaid. The Petitioner values it presently at

28 In division of matrimonial assets the factors that have to be taken into
account are set out in s.112 of the Women’s Charter. Matrimonial assets are
assets acquired or improved upon by the parties during the marriage. To have
an equitable division of the matrimonial assets, I must have regard to the
contribution of the parties to their acquisition.

29 The Respondent claimed that the assets were acquired by her from the
profits she made from Volks International Enterprise and Volks Fashion House.
It is quite clear from the evidence that the Petitioner was actively involved
in the running of the two firms. They were registered in the name of the
Respondent because of the Petitioner’s employment with Mono Trading Company
Pte Ltd. The bank accounts were operated and all the assets except the
matrimonial flat were registered in the Respondent’s name because of the
Petitioner’s bankruptcy. In any case, the profits from the two businesses
would not have enabled her to acquire so many properties. From 1979 to 1994,
the average monthly profits was only $1273.09. Quite clearly, the payment for
these assets were supplemented by contributions from the Petitioner’s salaries
and his other earnings from the various jobs he took on.

30 I was therefore of the view that in the absence of clear evidence to the
contrary, the property should be treated as having been acquired by them
jointly with equal contribution from each party. On this basis, I found the
contributions of each party to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets to be
as follows:

(i) _Matrimonial flat_

| _Petitioner_ | _Respondent_  
---|---|---  
(a) Initial capital payment | $9,399.00 | -  
(b) Downpayment (cash) (taken on joint basis) | $1,095 | $1,095  
(c) Initial renovations | $10,000 | -  
(d) CPF (towards loan) | $24,161 | -  
(e) Cash contribution (estimated, taken on joint basis) | $7,326 | $7,326  
(f) Subsequent renovations (taken on joint basis) | $16,000 | $16,000  
(g) Property Tax (23 years at about $100 per year) | $2,300 | -  
| $70,281 | $24,421  
| (~ 74.21%) | (~ 25.79%)  
  
(ii) _Bukit Merah Clinic_

> From the monthly payments evidenced by the cheques issued by the Petitioner
> in favour of the Respondent and the bank-in slips of the same into the
> Respondent’s DBS account no. 008-4906-8, the contribution of the Petitioner
> came up to 88% and that of the Respondent 12%.

(iii) The remaining matrimonial assets were acquired from the joint earnings
and savings and hence financial contribution of the parties was 50:50.

31 On non-financial contributions, there is no doubt that the Respondent would
have played a bigger role in the care of the children and the home. This is
usual in a family in which the spouses come from traditional Chinese
backgrounds. The Petitioner also would have less time to devote to the family
because of the various jobs he held to supplement the income from the two
businesses.

32 Based on the financial and non-financial contributions of the parties, the
Petitioner should be entitled to at least 50% of the matrimonial assets. But
taking into account the needs of each party and to avoid dislocation due to
disposal of the matrimonial assets on a 50:50 division, I made the orders
appealed against. In the case of the matrimonial flat, I ordered that the
Respondent transfer her interest to the Petitioner so that he and the daughter
and the son, if he later chooses to stay with the father, could have a home to
live in.

33 I also ordered the Respondent to transfer the Bukit Merah Clinic to the
Petitioner because he needs it to carry on his practice as a Chinese
physician. The Respondent was given the Ghim Moh Shophouse so that she could
continue her business of Volks Florists & Gifts on a portion of the first
storey and let out the remaining portion as before. The second storey could be
her residence.

34 The Respondent was allowed to retain whatever else was in her name
including her unexplained vast cash withdrawals from her bank accounts into
which their joint earnings were paid.

35 On this basis, without taking into the account the rentals from the Ghim
Moh Shophouse and the Johore properties appropriated by her, the award worked
out to a division in the region of 45:55 per cent to the Petitioner and the
Respondent respectively.

36 On maintenance for the son, the Petitioner was ordered to pay to the
Respondent $350 a month with effect from 1 October 1999 as long as the son
resides with her. In addition, the Petitioner is to pay for the son’s
education, and his personal expenses with a daily allowance. For the
Respondent’s maintenance and upkeep, the Petitioner was ordered to pay her
monthly $400 with effect from 1 October 1999. I made this award bearing in
mind her own income from Volks Florists & Gifts and the rentals that she will
continue to receive from the properties that she is to keep.

37 On costs, these ancillary proceedings were as acrimonious as the divorce
proceedings because of the stand taken by the Respondent. She relied on the
Petitioner’s bankruptcy to belittle the financial contribution of the
Petitioner in the acquisition of, and to deny him a share in, the assets
registered and paid for with funds from bank accounts in her name. This was
what she stated in her affidavit of 24 August 1999:

> "His salary throughout was not enough to maintain the family and himself
> [indeed from day 1 of the marriage he never gave me any maintenance for the
> family until 19 years later (in June 1994) when he paid maintenance of
> $2500/- for the 1st time]. He was a bankrupt for more than 12 years during
> which I gave him financial assistance and moral support. During his
> bankruptcy, he studied part-time and helped in his father’s shop and did not
> earn the kind of money which could help him acquire any of the matrimonial
> assets (except part of the matrimonial flat as admitted). If not for my hard
> work and efforts, there would be no matrimonial assets (except the flat) to
> fight over."

It was however clear to me these matrimonial assets were acquired and the bank
accounts operated in the Respondent’s name, because of the Petitioner’s
bankruptcy. But when it came to maintenance, she claimed a sum of $103,800 as
amount short paid over the years, dating her claims back to June 1994 when the
Petitioner was still a bankrupt. As these ancillary proceedings had been
unnecessarily protracted by the stand taken by the Respondent, I ordered her
to pay two-thirds of the Petitioner’s taxed costs.
