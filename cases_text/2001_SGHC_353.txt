**_Background_**

****

  
  
The plaintiff is Ng Poh Guan (`Mr Ng`).  
  
In his statement of claim, he alleged that there was an oral agreement between
him and the first defendant Chan Ai Leng (`Ms Chan`), who represented herself,
the second defendant Apirade Pramersa and the third defendant Ak Tiong Hua,
for him (Mr Ng) to buy the shares of the first to the third defendants in the
fourth defendant Honey Entertainment Pte Ltd (`Honey`). The purchase price was
$328,000.  
  
Honey had the benefit of a tenancy of No 33 Mohamed Sultan Road [num ]01-01,
[num ]01-02, [num ]01-03, [num ]01-04 and [num ]01-05/06 Singapore 238977
(`the premises`). It had entered into an agreement dated 3 September 1999 with
the landlord Hong Joo Co Pte Ltd (`the landlord`) to rent the premises for a
term of three years commencing from the expiry of a two-month rent-free
period, which rent-free period was to commence upon issuance of the temporary
occupation permit.  
  
The terms of the oral agreement between Ms Chan and Mr Ng were set out in a
letter of intent dated 9 September 2000 and pursuant to such terms, certain
payments by him were made. Also, a formal agreement was to be drafted and
signed.  
  
Mr Ng alleged that there was a subsequent oral agreement on 14 October 2000
between Ms Chan and him under which, inter alia:

(1) the defendants would procure the drafting of and submission to him of the
formal share agreement on or before 18 October 2000;

(2) if there was any breach by the defendants, he would be refunded everything
he had paid, half of all rent payments from 1 October 2000 and liquidated
damages of $125,000.

  
  
He alleged that the defendants were in breach of the oral agreements. The
allegations in respect of breach were:

(1) they failed to deliver any draft of the formal share agreement by 18
October 2000 or at all;

(2) the defendants failed to take any step towards the drafting of the formal
sale agreement;

(3) the first to third defendants had caused the fourth defendant to surrender
the premises back to the landlord without just and reasonable cause.

  
  
He alleged that the consideration for whatever payments he had made had failed
and the defendants had received and had had the use of the same, and he was
entitled to and did rescind the oral agreements.  
  
He claimed the return of whatever moneys he had paid and $125,000 as
liquidated damages.  
  
In their defence and counterclaim, the defendants did not deny that there was
an oral agreement between Mr Ng and Ms Chan pertaining to the sale of the
shares in Honey to Mr Ng. They alleged that the letter of intent did not set
out all the terms agreed or accurately. However, it turned out that the
alleged difference in terms was not material.  
  
The defendants also did not deny the subsequent oral agreement on 14 October
2000.  
  
However, the defendants denied any breach.  
  
The defendants alleged that the keys to the premises were handed to Mr Ng on
12 October 2000 for the purpose of cleaning, and doing some fitting up, and to
enable him to re-position some air-conditioners but not to demolish anything
without the concurrence of the landlord.  
  
However, on or around 14 October 2000, Mr Ng had caused the following to be
demolished:

(1) two of the 200mm thick party walls;

(2) toilet walls, wall tiles and toilet accessories;

(3) electrical installations;

(4) kitchen exhaust;

(5) built-in furniture and fittings;

(6) three built-in DJ counters;

(7) three built-in bar counters.

  
  
I will refer to these works as `the unauthorised works`.  
  
The defendants alleged that as a result of the unauthorised works, the
landlord was furious. The landlord had threatened to re-enter the premises and
to claim damages.  
  
As a consequence, the defendants had to negotiate with the landlord resulting
in the surrender of the premises to the landlord and a deduction of $10,000
from a tenancy deposit so as to avoid having to pay further damages.  
  
The defendants counterclaimed:

(1) loss of the two-year tenancy;

(2) loss of the time spent on renovations of the premises;

(3) loss of profit if the fourth defendant had continued with the tenancy with
the landlord;

(4) loss of a chance to sell the shares in the fourth defendant to any other
party;

(5) return of various licences which had been handed to Mr Ng pending
completion of the sale;

(6) refund of the sum of $10,000 paid to the landlord.

  
  
In his defence to counterclaim, Mr Ng asserted that Ms Chan had personally
indorsed the unauthorised works even before the commencement thereof but
abandoned this assertion at trial.  
  
Mr Ng also alleged that if the prior concurrence of the landlord was required,
it was the responsibility of the defendants to obtain the same and not him.  
  
He also repeated the allegation that the fourth defendant`s surrender of the
premises to the landlord was without just cause and unwarranted.  
  
The pleadings of Mr Ng and of the defendants were atrocious. In many material
parts, they made no distinction between the first to third defendants on the
one hand and the fourth defendant on the other hand.  
  
The amendment of the defence and counterclaim, while addressing some of the
deficiencies, did not address all of them.  
  
The amended defence and counterclaim also still failed to assert Honey`s cause
of action as against the plaintiff, given that Honey had no contract with Mr
Ng.  
  
At the conclusion of the trial, I declared that it was Mr Ng who was in breach
of his contract with Ms Chan and the second and the third defendants.  
  
I dismissed Mr Ng`s claims and ordered him to pay damages to Ms Chan and the
second and the third defendants to be assessed. However, their damages were
not to include any loss of profit if Honey had continued with the tenancy of
the premises because the evidence showed that the first to third defendants
were not intending to continue with any operation of a pub and, if Mr Ng had
not breached his contract, he would have owned and controlled Honey in any
event.  
  
Honey`s counterclaim for damages was dismissed and consequential orders were
made regarding the licences.  
  
Mr Ng has appealed against that part of my decision which is adverse to him.  
  
**_Further allegations and facts_**

****

  
  
At the time of the trial, Mr Ng was operating a pub at 27 Mohamed Sultan Road.  
  
In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (`AEIC`), he explained that in August
2000, he was keen on operating a pub along Mohamed Sultan Road. He found the
premises suitable and on 2 August 2000, his agent offered to rent the premises
from the landlord at $50,000 a month. Upon further investigation, he
discovered that Honey had a tenancy of the premises for about $30,000 a month
(the actual rent was $32,000 a month). Accordingly, he decided to try to take
over Honey`s tenancy by taking over Honey. He thought he could achieve this as
Honey`s business was not doing very well then.  
  
With this in mind, he met Ms Chan on 6 September 2000. Ms Chan was agreeable,
on behalf of herself and the other shareholders of Honey, to sell all the
shares in Honey to Mr Ng for $328,000.  
  
To Mr Ng, this route would enable him (1) to save on some rent, (2) there
would be minimal renovations and (3) he had estimated that it would take him
less than a month to spruce up the place and open for business (para 7 of his
AEIC).  
  
During the discussions with Ms Chan, she had told him that Honey needed money
to pay the landlord some moneys owing. As he did not wish to jeopardise
Honey`s tenancy, he agreed to and did issue a cheque for $32,960 in favour of
the landlord (para 8 of his AEIC).  
  
Ms Chan and Mr Ng signed the letter of intent on 9 September 2000. Although
this document is stated to be subject to contract, both sides proceeded at the
trial on the basis that it constituted or evidenced a binding agreement.  
  
Subsequently on 18 September 2000, he met Ms Chan who informed him that more
money was required to pay debts including moneys owing to the landlord. It was
common ground that he eventually paid $100,000 (including the $32,960) as part
payment of the purchase price (NE 12 line 15 and 16).  
  
In cross-examination, he said that he had received a copy of Honey`s tenancy
agreement in September or the first week of October 2000. He said he did read
the agreement and cll 2(g), (h), (j) and 4(e) thereof.  
  
Clause 2(g), (h) and (j) state:

> _
>
> 2\. The Tenant hereby covenants with the landlord as follows:-
...

(g) to carry out at their own expenses all or any of the following works
within the demised premises:-

(i) Partitioning within the demised premises and any variation to the standard
corridor or inter-tenancy partitions for subdivided suites, supplied and
erected by the landlord;

(ii) Installation of all necessary electrical wiring, conduits, etc, for
additional power points, light fittings, etc;

(iii) Any alteration works relating to existing ceiling light fixtures, air-
conditioning supply and return grilles, fire protective devices, etc supplied
by the landlord;

(iv) Provision of carpets and other approved floor covering or finishes within
the demised premises.

(h) To ensure the abovementioned works are undertaken whereby necessary by
specialist sub-contractors **_nominated or approved by the Landlord_** , in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications **_to be endorsed by the
Landlord_**. Where prior approval by the relevant building authority is
necessary, no works shall commence until such approval is obtained in writing.
All professional fees, charges and expenses incurred in this regard shall be
borne by the Tenant;

(i) ...

(j) Not to make any alterations **_structural or otherwise_** to the demised
premises **_without the prior written_** (**_sic_**) **_of the relevant
authorities during the tenancy_** and in the event there is any unauthorised
structure required to be removed, the Landlord shall immediately engage a
contractor to remove the same and the Tenant shall reimburse the Landlord the
cost for the removal of the unauthorised structure; [Emphasis is added.]

_

  
  
Clause 4(e) states:

> _That if the rents hereinbefore reserved or any part thereof shall at any
> time be in arrears and unpaid for seven (7) days after the same shall have
> become due (whether legally demanded or not)**or if the Tenant shall at any
> time fail or neglect to perform or observe any of the covenants and
> agreements herein contained and on the Tenant`s part to be performed and
> observed** or if the Tenant being a Company shall enter into liquidation
> (whether compulsorily or voluntarily) or the Tenant making an assignment for
> the benefit of creditors or enter into agreement or make any arrangement for
> liquidation of the Tenant`s debts by compensation or otherwise or suffer any
> distress or process of execution to be levied on the Tenant`s goods or
> merchandise, **then in such case it shall be lawful for the Landlord** or
> any person or persons duly authorised by the Landlord on his behalf **to re-
> enter** into and upon the demised premises or any part thereof in the name
> of the whole and thereupon this tenancy shall absolutely determine but
> without prejudice to any right of action or remedy of the Landlord in
> respect of any antecedent breach by the Tenant of any of the covenants or
> agreements herein contained. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
It was not disputed that on 10 or 11 October 2000, Ms Chan met with Mr Ng at a
hotel and, at his request, she signed on some renovation plans pertaining to
the premises although she unwittingly signed where the landlord should have
signed.  
  
On 11 October 2000, Mr Ng`s solicitors Kenneth CP Tan & Liew (`Kenneth Tan`)
forwarded to the solicitors for all the defendants MN Swami & Yap (`MN Swami`)
a draft of a loan agreement and of a shareholders` agreement.  
  
On 12 October 2000, MN Swami replied to suggest a meeting on Saturday, 14
October 2000.  
  
In the meantime, the keys to the premises were given to Mr Ng for the reason I
have mentioned above (see [para ]12).  
  
In the meeting of 14 October 2000, various matters were discussed with a view
to signing a formal agreement.  
  
In the meantime and unknown to Ms Chan, the unauthorised works were being
carried out.  
  
Ms Chan`s evidence was that on 15 October 2000, she received a telephone call
from the landlord`s agent who told her that the landlord was furious about the
unauthorised works, although at that point in time, he might not have been
aware of all the unauthorised works.  
  
The next day, she went to the premises to check and found that the padlock or
padlocks had been changed. However, she looked in to see the unauthorised
works.  
  
Ms Chan sought the help of MN Swami and Honey`s architect Mr Yeo Chye Teck
(`Mr Yeo`).  
  
On 18 October 2000, MN Swami sent an urgent fax to Kenneth Tan. It said:

> _Dear Sir_

2\. **_In the event the landlord is to exercise his rights under the Tenancy

should be liable for all consequences and losses to be sustained by our
clients including the rental of the premises and loss of income for the
unoccupied period of lease pursuant to **_such termination_**.

_

On 19 October 2000, Kenneth Tan replied as follows:

> _We refer to your fax to us dated 18 October 2000. Our instructions are as
> follows:_

> _
>
> (a)**_Our client denies carrying out unauthorised renovation work_**.
> Rather, and as was mentioned during the meeting on 14 October 2000, it was

(b) ...

(c) Our client has been advised that the renovation works do not require prior
approval from any authority prior to commencement of works. **_They involve
minor internal addition and alteration works, and do not compromise the
structural integrity of the premises_**. Nonetheless, and as your clients are
undoubtedly aware, our client intends to submit necessary documents from time
to time, according to industry practice, to the relevant authorities. However,
and as your Mr Swami was twice informed by our Mr Lewis Koh today, **_your
client Ms Chan Ai Leng has not endorsed and has even taken away plans to be
submitted to the URA, FSB and BCA for approval_** , in breach of her agreement
to "co-operate" with our client. Your client will undoubtedly realise that the
retention of such plans is to her detriment as they are intended, not only to
cover the intended works, but also to regularise her omission in respect of
her renovations, and we trust she will therefore hand over the endorsed plans
accordingly. Also, **_such retention does not detract from her patent approval
of the renovations works as borne out by the many plans and forms which she
has already signed. In the event that, contrary to normal practice_** , your
client insists that all work be suspended until approvals are applied for and
obtained, then it would not be equitable for our client to be made to continue
lending your client money to pay the rent in the interim.

(d) Before such time our client takes over all the shares in the Company,
**_our client regrets that he does not have any locus or nexus to obtain the
landlord`s consent_** , assuming in the first place that such consent is
required. Our client does not see how there was any breach, let alone a
fundamental one as alleged. We trust your client understands that our client
cannot stop anyone from commencing legal proceedings even if, in our client`s
view, there is insufficient basis to found a legal suit.

_

> _Be that as it may, our client suggests that a meeting be convened tomorrow
> between your clients and ours to resolve the matter amicably._

> _We look forward to receiving your draft agreement, which was due to have
> been transmitted to us yesterday, in the meantime. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
On 20 October 2000, MN Swami wrote to Kenneth Tan as follows:

> _RE: HONEY ENTERTAINMENT PTE LTD AND SHARE AGREEMENT_

> _We refer to your fax dated 19.10.2000._

> _Our clients reiterate what has been set out in our letter dated
> 18.10.2000._

> _**The landlord has requested to inspect the premises at 4.00 p.m. today**._

> _We shall be obliged if you could kindly advise your clients to open the
> said premises to the landlord or their servants or agents, as they are
> entitled to inspect the premises as per the terms of the Tenancy Agreement._

> _Our clients` representative will be at the said premises as well._

> _Due to the fresh development, we need to have further discussions after

> _In the meanwhile, please note that our client had at no time authorised
> your clients to replace the old locks with the new locks and**kindly advise
> your clients to handover a set of keys to our clients immediately**.
> [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
Ms Chan said she asked Mr Ng to attend the inspection. He did not. He did,
however, arrange for a messenger to bring one key on 20 October 2000.  
  
According to Mr Yeo, the inspection was attended by:

(1) Ms Chan.

(2) The landlord`s representative, Nicholas.

(3) Mr Yeo Chye Teck, the architect.

(4) A professional engineer Mr John Portwood (`the PE`) (NE 71 line 11).

  
  
Ms Chan said that when the landlord`s representative saw the extent of the
unauthorised works, he threatened to repossess the premises immediately as the
works were carried out without the landlord`s consent or approval from the
relevant authorities. He also threatened to take legal action and hold Ms Chan
and Honey liable for all damages, ie to claim the reinstatement costs and
legal fees and forfeit the deposit (see para 13 of her AEIC and NE 49 line 18
and 19).  
  
According to Mr Yeo, he had received a telephone call from the landlord on 14
October 2000. In para 13 of his AEIC, he said:

> _By the 14th of October 2000, I did not receive the said computer drawings
> or the interior design from Tony Teo to enable me to finalise the
> submission. However at about 4.30p.m on the same day, I received a phone
> call from the landlord that he had received (**sic**) from his upstairs
> tenants that there are heavy hacking from the premises. The landlord told me
> that when he went to the premises, he found that the party walls and toilet
> walls had been hacked off. He had also stated that the glass panel on the
> external wall outside the premises had been removed and that he feared that
> the bricks above the opening could fall. The landlord told me that he had
> taken photographs of the contractor who was seen hacking the walls. He told
> me that pursuant to what had happened to the premises without his approval,
> he wanted to re-possess the premises immediately and claim for damages. At
> his request I went to look at the opening from outside the premises to
> ascertain whether the bricks could fall from the top._

  
  
In re-examination, Mr Yeo added that the landlord`s representative had said he
wanted to take action against him (NE 72 line 14).  
  
On 21 October 2000, Kenneth Tan wrote to MN Swami to state:

> _We refer to your fax to us dated 20 October 2000._

> _**We were instructed to reiterate that your clients authorised the
> renovation works** and for this purpose willingly gave our client the keys
> to the premises ..._

> _We now turn to the fifth paragraph of your said fax, in respect of which we

>
> (a) Our client has always been willing to discuss matters with your clients,

> avoidance of doubt, all our client`s rights are hereby reserved; and
(b) Even before one can enter into an agreement, it is imperative that there
be a draft of such agreement on the table to discuss. Our client therefore
requests that you transmit to us without further delay **_a copy of the draft
agreement, which you said you could draft and deliver latest by 18 October
2000, this Monday 23 October 2000_** , for our client`s instructions and
comments. Thank you. [Emphasis is added.]

_

  
  
Ms Chan said that it was she who tried to contact Mr Ng between 15 and 20
October 2000 (NE 33 line 10-16). She disagreed that it was Mr Ng who tried to
contact her about the sale of shares agreement.  
  
On 23 October 2000, the landlord`s solicitors Dennis Singham & Teresa Chan &
Partners (`Dennis Singham`) sent an urgent fax to MN Swami. It stated:

> _No 33 Mohamed Sultan Road [num ]01-01, [num ]01-02, [num ]01-03, [num

In cross-examination, Ms Chan said that she had not informed Mr Ng about
Dennis Singham`s fax but in re-examination she claimed that she did.  
  
Subsequently the landlord`s solicitors met with MN Swami on 27 October 2000 as
a result of which it was agreed that:

(1) Honey would surrender the premises on 30 October 2000 on receipt of the
return of the deposit less $10,000, ie $96,000 less $10,000.

(2) The landlord would undertake the responsibility of reinstating the
premises.

(3) There would be no further claims by the landlord or Honey against each
other.

  
  
The premises were accordingly surrendered on 30 October 2000 and $86,000 was
returned to Honey.  
  
In response to an inquiry by Kenneth Tan dated 30 October 2000 about the draft
agreement, MN Swami replied on 31 October 2000 to inform them that the
premises had been returned to the landlord.  
  
As far as reinstatement works were concerned, Ms Chan said she had consulted
Mr Yeo and he had estimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000. Mr Yeo
confirmed that it would cost `not less than $300,000` (NE 66 line 15).  
  
On some of the items constituting the unauthorised works, Mr Yeo`s evidence
was that the cost of reinstating just the two party walls which were
demolished on Mr Ng`s instructions was estimated to be $25,000 to $30,000. The
cost of reinstating the five toilets would be $10,000 each. On these items
alone, the cost would be about $80,000.  
  
Ms Chan said that Honey did not have the money to do reinstatement works and
this was not challenged.  
  
Mr Ng`s evidence on doing reinstatement works vacillated.  
  
Initially when his attention was drawn to the fax dated 18 October 2000 from
MN Swami to Kenneth Tan, he said that he did not take steps to reinstate the
premises because he was of the view that this was not the solution (NE 16 line
16-21).  
  
He also did not believe that the unauthorised works would jeopardise the
tenancy agreement because they were not serious enough (NE 23 line 1-5). He
had taken the position that they did not affect the structural integrity of
the premises.  
  
Then he said that as events unfolded he did not even have the chance to
reinstate or consider reinstating the premises (NE 23 line 10-13).  
  
In his view, the matter could have been `regularised with a bit of
communication with the landlord`. However, his idea of regularisation was to
show the landlord that Honey was not just taking steps to rectify what had
existed but to show his (Mr Ng`s) plans to the landlord so that the landlord
could get the certificate of statutory completion for the premises (NE 24 line
10-17).  
  
He said he kept pursuing Ms Chan for the indorsement of the plans but he was
not successful (NE 24 line 19 to NE 25 line 12).  
  
On Ms Chan`s part, she said she took away the plan (or plans) from Mr Yeo`s
office as she did not want Mr Ng to carry on with renovation work without the
consent of the landlord. She did not see any point in co-operating with Mr Ng
in view of the unauthorised works (para 43 of her AEIC).  
  
She disagreed that she was not willing to co-operate with Mr Ng to rectify the
situation with the landlord (NE 40 line 9 to NE 41 line 8).  
  
As it turned out, the demolished party walls and toilets were not reinstated
and the premises are currently used by someone else (NE 66 line 23 to NE 67
line 5).  
  
**_Arguments and my conclusion_**

****

  
  
Mr Ng initially took the position that the unauthorised works did not require
the approval of any authority. He relied on a notice issued by the Building
Control Division, Public Works Department dated 1 April 1998.  
  
The notice states:

> _NOTICE TO OWNER OF NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS_

> _EXEMPTION FROM APPROVAL FOR MINOR BUILDING WORKS AND ALTERATIONS TO NON-
> RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS_

> _

> Part A of the Schedule.
2\. Whilst these minor building works and alterations may be exempted under
the Building Control Act, some of the works may be subject to the control of
other authorities. You are advised to consult or liaise directly with the

However, there was an important note which states:

> _The above does not apply to gazetted conservation areas and monuments.
> (Back to Table of Content)_

  
  
As it turned out, the premises were in a gazetted conservation area.  
  
Even if no permission of any relevant authority was required, Honey was still
required under cl 2(h) of the tenancy agreement (set out in [para ]36 above)
to ensure that any works mentioned in cl 2(g) (which included the unauthorised
works) be carried out by specialist sub-contractors to be approved by the
landlord and this was not done. Indeed, in para 8 of the supplement to the
plaintiff`s opening statement, it was conceded that the unauthorised works
were done without the concurrence of the landlord.  
  
I would add that it was also conceded that they were done without the
concurrence of the defendants although the faxes from Kenneth Tan dated 19 and
21 October 2000, which I have cited in [para ]48 and 55 above, and Mr Ng`s
pleadings had alleged that the defendants/Ms Chan had authorised such works.  
  
Also, the insistence by Mr Ng that the unauthorised works were not structural
was besides the point. They were done in breach of the tenancy agreement.  
  
Accordingly the fact that the demolished party walls and demolished toilets
have not been subsequently reinstated by the landlord or a new tenant and the
premises are being currently used by a new tenant did not assist Mr Ng.  
  
Furthermore, while he categorised the unauthorised works as minor, Mr Yeo
described them as, `Major and the landlord was very furious` (NE 72 line 6).
Also, Mr Ng did not call any architect to give evidence on the nature of the
unauthorised works.  
  
The truth of the matter was that Mr Ng was in too much of a rush to do the
unauthorised works, `because the faster I finish, the earlier I can open the
premises for business` (NE 9 line 10).  
  
He had assumed that the landlord would not mind the unauthorised works and
would allow him to get the paper work done concurrently with the physical
works as, in his view, that was the normal practice. In my view, even if this
was the normal practice, which would be against the law, a landlord should at
least be notified in advance of such works and his concurrence obtained.  
  
Mr Ng had said he did not want Honey`s tenancy to be jeopardised when he made
some advance payments to or on behalf of Honey. Yet the unauthorised works did
precisely just that.  
  
Mr Edwin Kung, acting for Mr Ng, submitted that Ms Chan and the other
defendants were repudiating the sale agreement and were evidencing an
intention not to be bound by it because they had put Honey in the position
where Honey would no longer have the tenancy. He also submitted that Mr Ng had
rescinded the sale agreement by a subsequent letter from Kenneth Tan dated 6
November 2000.  
  
In my view, there was no doubt that Ms Chan wanted to proceed with the sale of
the shares in Honey but the unauthorised works had put a spanner in the works.  
  
The surrender of the tenancy was not to repudiate the sale agreement but was
to mitigate the damage caused by Mr Ng`s irresponsible action as the landlord
was threatening to terminate the tenancy, forfeit the deposit and claim
reinstatement and legal costs.  
  
Any suggestion that the draft agreement still had not been prepared by her
solicitors by 18 October 2000, must also be seen in the context of the
unauthorised works and the landlord`s reaction thereto. Indeed, in para 7 of
the supplement to the plaintiff`s opening statement, it was conceded that the
defendants had taken steps to get the agreement drafted.  
  
In addition, any suggestion that Ms Chan was subsequently withholding plans
must be seen in the context that she had trusted Mr Ng by handing over the
keys to the premises only to discover that he had carried out the unauthorised
works. There was otherwise no reluctance on her part to assist him. As I have
mentioned, earlier she had on 10 or 11 October 2000, at his request, when she
met him at a hotel, signed some renovation plans.  
  
The main point raised for Mr Ng was that Honey should not have surrendered the
premises to the landlord.  
  
On this point, Mr Kung did not assert that there was no breach of the tenancy
agreement.  
  
Instead, he argued that the notice from the landlord`s solicitors Dennis
Singham was invalid, relying on s 18(1) and (10) of the Conveyancing and Law
of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Ed) (`CLPA`).  
  
Section 18(1) of the CLPA states:

> _Restrictions on and relief against forfeiture of leases._

> _
>
> (1) A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any provision or stipulation in
> a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in a lease, shall not be
> enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless the lessor serves on the lessee
> a notice specifying the particular breach complained of and, if the breach
> is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach, and, in any
> case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and
> the lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter, to remedy the breach,
> if it is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money, to
> the satisfaction of the lessor, for the breach.
_

  
  
Section 18(10) of the CLPA states:

> _This section shall apply to leases before, on or after 1st August 1886, and
> shall have effect notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary._

  
  
Mr Kung argued that under s 18(1) of the CLPA the notice from Dennis Singham
must give sufficient details of the breach by Honey and this was not done.  
  
In **Lee Tat Realty v Limco Products Manufacturing** [1999] 1 SLR 263 , Chao
Hick Tin J (as he then was) said that a valid notice under s 18(1) of the CLPA
must contain sufficient particulars of the alleged breach. With respect, I
agree.  
  
In the present case before me, the notice from Dennis Singham, which is set
out in [para ]57 above, did set out some particulars of breach, ie the removal
of the party wall between the units and the removal of walls to the toilets.  
  
However, it was not necessary for me to decide whether the notice constituted
sufficient particulars for the following reasons.  
  
First, the reference therein to cl 2(j) of the tenancy agreement was wrong.
Clause 2(j) refers to the consent of the relevant authorities, and not of the
landlord.  
  
Second, the breach was capable of remedy but the landlord did not require
Honey to remedy the breach. This was contrary to s 18(1) of the CLPA.  
  
I accepted that the notice was invalid. However, it did not follow that Honey
should not have surrendered the premises.  
  
First, it would not serve much purpose to challenge the validity of the notice
unless Honey intended to carry out reinstatement works for which it needed
more time. After all, the landlord could have sent a valid notice if the
validity of the first notice had been challenged.  
  
Second, it was not disputed that Honey did not have money to do reinstatement
works. Ms Chan also accepted that she was not aware of Honey`s right to do
reinstatement works under s 18(1) of the CLPA.  
  
It was put to Ms Chan during her cross-examination that Mr Ng was not aware
that the landlord was going to terminate the tenancy and Mr Ng did not have an
opportunity to carry out reinstatement works (NE 43 line 8 to NE 44 line 20).  
  
I accepted that the subsequent notice dated 23 October 2000 from Dennis
Singham was not brought to the attention of Kenneth Tan or Mr Ng until after
the premises were surrendered, although Ms Chan had various telephone
discussions with Mr Ng.  
  
On this point, I did not accept Ms Chan`s belated evidence in re-examination
that she had mentioned the written notice from Dennis Singham to Mr Ng in
telephone discussions with Mr Ng between 24-27 October 2000. In cross-
examination, she had already said that she had not done so.  
  
I would add that there was no suggestion that the omission was deliberate.
Indeed, Ms Chan and Honey were under considerable pressure from the landlord
to respond to the landlord`s threat quickly.  
  
In any event, the omission did not mean that Mr Ng was completely unaware of
the danger that the landlord might terminate the tenancy. The danger had
already been mentioned in the fax from MN Swami to Kenneth Tan dated 18
October 2000 (see [para ]47 above).  
  
As for the allegation that Mr Ng did not have an opportunity to carry out
reinstatement works, the truth of the matter was that Mr Ng did not intend to
do reinstatement works.  
  
His intention was to carry on with what he had done. That is why he asserted
during cross-examination that he still expected the landlord to indorse his
plans notwithstanding the unauthorised works (NE 17 line 15-17, NE 23 line
22-24, NE 24 line 10-17).  
  
That is also why Mr Ng did nothing to redress the situation or placate the
landlord. Even if Ms Chan did not orally tell him about the inspection on 20
October 2000, he knew about it from the fax dated 20 October 2000 from MN
Swami to Kenneth Tan, pursuant to which one key was sent via a messenger. He
did not turn up for the inspection. He also avoided approaching the landlord
on the excuse that he had no contractual relationship with the landlord. He
could and should have offered to see the landlord with Ms Chan but he did not.
Yet he had the temerity to say that the matter could have been regularised
with a bit of communication with the landlord.  
  
Furthermore, while Mr Kung criticised Honey for not relying on s 18(1) of the
CLPA, Kenneth Tan themselves did not raise this provision at the material
time. I find that they themselves had been unaware about it or had forgotten
about it then. That is why the question of reinstatement under s 18(1) of the
CLPA was never raised in their faxes/ correspondence to MN Swami before 30
October 2000. Even after 31 October 2000 when they were informed about the
surrender of the premises, they did not assert in any fax or correspondence
that reinstatement works should have been done or that Mr Ng had been denied
the opportunity of doing such works. This was also not raised in Mr Ng`s
pleadings.  
  
I was of the view that s 18(1) of the CLPA was raised as an afterthought to
extricate Mr Ng from the mess he had created.  
  
Mr Kung also argued that the chain of causation had been broken by the act of
surrendering the premises.  
  
I did not agree. The surrender of the premises was an ordinary and natural
consequence of the unauthorised works.  
  
It may be that Honey could have mitigated by doing reinstatement works but
that is a different point which was not specifically pleaded by Mr Ng.  
  
Secondly, Honey had acted on the advice of its architect Mr Yeo who had
estimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000 and Honey did not have this sum
or even the $80,000 I have mentioned in [para ]62 above. It must be remembered
that Honey was in dire financial straits, and that is why it had to obtain
advance payment from Mr Ng.  
  
Thirdly, Honey had acted on the advice of its solicitors in agreeing to
surrender the premises with a forfeiture of only $10,000 of its deposit. As I
have said, the intention behind the surrender was with a view to mitigating
its damages.  
  
Fourthly, at no time prior to 30 October 2000 did Kenneth Tan suggest that
reinstatement works be done.  
  
Fifthly, everything was happening very quickly, starting with the shock of
learning about the unauthorised works and the landlord`s fury.  
  
It may well be that the landlord was taking advantage of the situation but it
was a situation created by Mr Ng.  
  
In all the circumstances, I did not think that Honey had acted unreasonably or
had failed to mitigate (assuming this had been pleaded) by surrendering the
premises.  
  
Accordingly, I was of the view that it was not Ms Chan and the second and
third defendants who were in breach of contract but Mr Ng. His purported
rescission of the sale agreement was wrongful.  
  
By his deliberate act in carrying out the unauthorised works, he had made it
impossible for the first, second and third defendants to carry out their part
of the sale agreement. In my view, this entitled them not only to be excused
from being unable to provide the tenancy and carry on with the sale agreement
but also to claim damages from him.  
  
**Outcome:**

Claim dismissed; counterclaim allowed in part.
