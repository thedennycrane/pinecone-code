Conflict of Laws – Choice of jurisdiction – Exclusive – Shipper indorsing bill
of lading in blank to respondents – Carrier delivering cargo without
production of bill of lading – Respondents suing carrier for breach of duty –
Carrier seeking stay of action – Jurisdiction clause – Whether real dispute
exists – Whether court entitled to consider conflicting opinions of experts on
foreign law – Whether strong cause to disregard jurisdiction clause exists  
  

When the respondents took out an application for summary judgment, the
appellants applied to have the proceedings stayed on the ground that there was
a jurisdiction clause in the B/L referring all disputes arising from the B/L
to the country of the appellants principal place of business, which was
Vietnam. The clause also stated the governing law to be that of Vietnam.

The appellants called an expert on Vietnamese law, Mr Cuong, who opined that
notwithstanding the "blank" endorsement by Pacific Sugar on the B/L, the
respondents were not the persons entitled to receive the cargo. Mr Cuong
relied on article 84(b) of the Maritime Code of Vietnam, which reads:

> " An order bill of lading is transferred by writing in its counter signing
> square on the back of the bill of lading the name of the person who has the
> right to issue an order for delivery of the cargo ".

According to Mr Cuong, this meant that the B/L could be transferred only if
the name of the transferees (i.e. the respondents in this case) was written on
the back of the B/L. In the present instance, this was not done as Pacific
Sugar only endorsed their own name on the back of the B/L and not the name of
the respondents. It was thus argued that the respondents were not entitled to
sue for the loss. Mr Cuong further opined that there was no such concept as
"the holder of the Bill of Lading" under Vietnamese law. This opinion was
contradicted by the expert called for the respondents. The appellants however
argued that the difference in expert opinion gave rise to a "dispute" between
the parties for the purposes of the jurisdiction clause, which had to be
referred to Vietnam for adjudication.

The stay application was dismissed by the assistant registrar. That decision
was in turn affirmed by the learned judge below. The appellants appealed.

**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Judgment**

1\. This was an appeal against the decision of Amarjeet Singh JC affirming the
Assistant Registrars refusal of the appellants application for a stay of
proceedings on the ground of an exclusive jurisdiction clause contained in a
bill of lading (B/L). At the conclusion of the hearing, we upheld the decision
of the learned judge. We now give our reasons.

**

The facts

**

2\. The facts giving rise to this admiralty action were largely undisputed.
The respondents claim was in respect of a cargo of 2,000 metric tons of raw
sugar (the cargo) which was shipped by a Thai company, Pacific Sugar
Corporation Ltd (Pacific Sugar), on board the appellants vessel _, "Hung
Vuong-3",_ at Bangkok for discharge at the main port of South China.

3\. By a contract dated 19th December 1997, the respondents agreed to sell
4,000 metric tons of raw sugar, FOB Bangkok (and/or three other Thai ports),
to a company in China called _Guangxi Yulin Prefecture Economic Trade
Development Co (Guangxi)_. Shipment was to be effected during the period of 15
December 1997 to 15 February 1998. Payment was to be by way of letter of
credit (LC). To fulfil in part the obligations of the respondents under this
contract, they purchased the cargo from Pacific Sugar.

4\. For the shipment of the cargo, the appellants issued a "to order" B/L to
Pacific Sugar as the shipper. The B/L was in turn endorsed over in blank by
Pacific Sugar to the respondents in this manner:

> "PACIFIC SUGAR CORPORATION LTD
>
> Sgd.
>
> ____________________________________
>
> (YONCHAILAI JATURAFIS)
>
> GENERAL MANAGER"

The B/L (in three original copies) was duly conveyed by Pacific Sugar to the
respondents.

5\. Problems arose when _Huang Vuong-3_ , on arrival at Beihai, China,
delivered the cargo to _Guangxi_ , without the production of any of the copies
of the B/L. The respondents had tendered all the relevant documents to
negotiate the LC but failed to receive payment under it. The B/L was in due
course returned to the respondents. However, _Guangxi_ did make part payment
for the cargo - US$120,772.95 out of US$654,000, being the purchase price.
Thereafter the appellants sought to pressurise _Guangxi_ to pay the balance.
But it remained unpaid at the time the action was commenced.

6\. Upon the institution of Admiralty in Rem No 733 of 1998, the respondents
caused to be arrested _"Hung Vuong-2"_ , a sister ship of the _"Hung_
_Vuong-3". "Hung Vuong-2"_ was later released after the appellants P&I Club
posted sufficient security to meet the respondents claim.

**

Stay application

**

7\. The basis of the respondents claim was that the B/L was endorsed in blank
to them by Pacific Sugar. Being the holders of the original B/L (all three
copies thereof), they had acquired title to the cargo and were entitled to
delivery of the same. The appellants delivery of the cargo to _Guangxi_ ,
without the production of the B/L, constituted a clear breach of contract
and/or duty on the part of the appellants. Thus the respondents claimed for
their losses, based on the balance purchase price of the cargo amounting to
US$533.227.05.

8\. The respondents took out an application for summary judgment against the
appellants on the ground that there was no defence to the respondents claim.
They contended it was clear beyond doubt that the appellants were in breach
when the latter delivered the goods to _Guangxi_ without the production of any
of the original copies of the B/L. However, the appellants applied to have the
proceedings stayed on the ground that there was a jurisdiction clause in the
B/L which read as follows:

> "Any dispute arising from this B/L shall be decided in the country where the
> Carrier has his principal place of business, and law of such country shall
> apply except as provided elsewhere herein."

As the appellants principal place of business was and is in Vietnam, they
contended that the action here should accordingly be stayed. As a result, the
respondents application for summary judgment was adjourned pending the outcome
of the stay application, which was eventually dismissed by the assistant
registrar. That decision was affirmed by the learned judge.

**

Issues

**

9\. Two main issues were canvassed before us. They were broadly the same
issues which were raised before, and rejected by, the learned judge, namely:

> (i) whether the appellants had raised a dispute for the purposes of the
> jurisdiction clause, so that by virtue of the clause, the respondents claim
> would have to be brought in Vietnam and not Singapore.
>
> (ii) whether the circumstances of this case were such that they constituted
> strong cause justifying this court to disregard the jurisdiction clause.

**

Was there a dispute

**

10\. It is trite law that a party seeking to bring an action in a Singapore
court in breach of a jurisdiction clause must show "strong cause". The factors
or circumstances which the court would take into account in determining
"strong cause" were those enunciated by Brandon J in _The Eleftheria_[1969] 1
Lloyds Rep 237 at 242 and which were adopted by this Court in _Amerco Timbers
Pte Ltd v Chatsworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd_[1975-77] SLR 258. They were:-

> "(a) In what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated or more
> readily available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and
> expense of trial as between the Singapore and foreign courts.
>
> (b) Whether the law of the foreign court applies and, if so, whether it
> differs from Singapore law in any material respects.
>
> (c) With what country either party is connected and, if so, how closely.
>
> (d) Whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or
> are only seeking procedural advantages.
>
> (e) Whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the
> foreign court because they would:
>

>> (i) be deprived of security for their claim;

>>

>> (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained;

>>

>> (iii) be faced with a time-bar not applicable here; or

>>

>> (iv) for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a
fair trial."

11\. It was in relation to factor (d) that the question, whether there was a
genuine dispute between the parties, became crucial. It would be difficult for
a party to contend that he seriously desires trial in the contractual forum if
he was unable to show that there was a real dispute, or putting it another
way, that he had a real defence to the claim. In the recent decision of this
Court in _The Jian He_[2000] 1 SLR 8, we reviewed the cases where the courts
had refused a stay on the ground that there was no real dispute. There is
clearly jurisdiction on the part of the court to make this determination.

12\. We will now examine the basis upon which the appellants contended that
there was a dispute. Counsel for the appellants conceded that the burden was
on them. Their point was that notwithstanding the "blank" endorsement, the
respondents were not the persons entitled to receive the cargo and thus sue
for the loss. For this they relied upon the legal opinion of a Vietnamese
Attorney-at-Law, Mr Tran Quang Cuong (Mr Cuong). The basis upon which Mr Cuong
arrived at his conclusion was article 84(b) of the Maritime Code of Vietnam,
which reads

> "A bill of lading may be transferred in accordance with the following
> principles:  
>  .  
>  .  
>  An order bill of lading is transferred by writing in its counter signing
> square on the back of the bill of lading _the name of the person who has the
> right to issue an order for delivery of the cargo._ The last person who has
> the right to issue an order for delivery of cargo is the legal cargo
> receiver, even where counter signing square remains blank."

According to Mr Cuong, in order for the respondents to be the "legal cargo
receivers" their names had to be written on the back of the B/L. In the
present instance, this was not done as Pacific Sugar had only endorsed their
own name on the back of the B/L and not the name of the respondents.

13\. For a more complete picture, it is necessary for us to also set out the
provisions of articles 81(2) and 93 of the same Code:

_

> Article 81(2)

_

"The original B/L is a document of title for disposing of the cargo and for
taking delivery thereof."

_

Article 93

_

"When the vessel arrives at the port of destination, the carrier is obliged to
deliver the cargo to the legal cargo receiver who has at least one original
bill of lading or forwarding document or similar way bill as referred to at
paragraph 2 of Article 80 of this Code. After the cargo has been delivered,
all other copies of the bill of lading stand void for receiving the cargo."

14\. First, we would observe that the opinion of Mr Cuong seemed somewhat
tentative as he stated that "the defendants (the owners) _may_ not be liable
to the plaintiffs (cargo owners)". Furthermore, his conclusion was that "the
defendants may have a defence to the claim."

15\. On the other hand, the legal expert of the respondents, Mr Nguyen Manh
Dung (Mr Dung), deposed that in accordance with article 93 the shipowners
should only deliver the cargo against the production of the B/L (at least one
original copy) and if they did otherwise they would be acting at their own
risk. He said the Vietnamese Maritime Code allowed the transfer of a "to
order" B/L by endorsement and upon such transfer, the consequential rights and
interest in the cargo were similarly transferred. It was adequate that the B/L
was endorsed "in blank". Mr Dung opined that in the light of the blank
endorsement of the B/L affected by Pacific Sugar, together with the actual
transfer of the B/L to the respondents, the latter had acquired title to the
cargo. The respondents were entitled therefore to sue the appellants, who were
liable to the respondents for the misdelivery of the cargo to _Guanxi,_
without the production of any of the original copies of the B/L. All the three
original copies of the B/L were at all material times in the possession of the
respondents.

16\. We recognised that questions of foreign law are questions of fact and
where the opinions of experts conflict on such foreign law, the court should
as a general rule refrain from making a determination on the basis of
affidavit evidence. Furthermore, there is much to be said for the proposition
that disputes about foreign law should more appropriately be resolved by the
courts of that foreign country: see _The Asian Plutus_[1990] 2 MLJ 449. But it
does not follow that in every instance where there is a conflict of opinions,
the Singapore courts should always shy away from examining the opinions given.
Counsel for the appellants conceded that this Court was entitled to consider
the opinions.

17\. Upon a prima facie examination of Mr Cuongs opinion and the relevant
provisions of the Vietnamese Maritime Code, it was clear to us that there was
no basis for his opinion that article 84(b) required the specific endorsement
of the transferees name (i.e., the respondents) on the reverse side of the
B/L. It was common ground between the parties that the B/L here was an "order"
B/L. It would be useful for us to set out again the relevant portion of
article 84(b):-

> "An order bill of lading is transferred by writing in its counter signing
> square on the back of the bill of lading the name of the person who has the
> right to issue an order for delivery of the cargo."

18\. The critical words in this provision are "the person who _has the right_
to issue an order." The question to ask is, who at that point in time
immediately before the execution of the transfer, has the right to issue an
order for delivery of the cargo. It cannot be the transferee. It has to be the
transferor, who is the person who "has the right". Until the transfer is
completed and effected the transferee would have no right to issue any order
for delivery. Therefore, in this case, the party whose name that must be
endorsed on the reverse side of the B/L was that of Pacific Sugar. This was
what was done here. Thus, the rights to receive the cargo had effectively been
transferred to the respondents upon the B/L being delivered to the latter. We
found the following opinion of Mr Dung wholly logical and sensible

> "Such an "Order" Bill of Lading is transferred in writing. It is transferred
> in writing when the name of the person who has the right to issue an order
> for delivery of the cargo countersigns his name on the back of the Bill of
> Lading. The person who has that right on this Bill of Lading is Pacific
> Sugar Corporation Ltd, the shipper. The Bill of Lading is marked "To Order"
> which means it is to the order of Pacific Sugar Corporation Ltd. Pacific
> Sugar Corporation Ltd is the last person who has the right to issue an order
> for delivery of the cargo. They can transfer this right by countersigning
> their name in the counter signing square on the back of the Bill of Lading.
>
> In this case there is no square on the back of the Bill of Lading providing
> for this. Pacific Sugar Corporation Ltd therefore can sign their name on the
> reverse side of the Bill of Lading. By doing so, they transfer in writing
> the right to an issue of the Delivery Order. That right becomes transferred
> to the Holder of the Bill of Lading. This Bill of Lading itself states on
> the face of it that the Holder of this Bill of Lading is also bound by the
> contract evidenced by the Bill of Lading. That is the manner in which an
> "Order" Bill of Lading is transferred under Article 84(b) of the Maritime
> Code of Vietnam."

19\. In our judgment, the opinion of Mr Cuong, that what must be endorsed on
the reverse side of the B/L was the name of the transferee, was clearly
unsustainable. It, therefore, followed that the appellants assertion that
Vietnamese law did not recognise the concept of "holder of the bill of lading"
also could not be sustained. It seemed to us that what was reflected in
article 84(b) was really that concept and was wholly in line with
international maritime practice. In passing, we would add that we felt
fortified in this view by the fact that the B/L itself had provided that "the
shipper, consignee and the holder of this bill of lading hereby expressly
accepts all printed provisions on this bill of lading, including those on the
back hereof". On the back of B/L, the term "shipper" was defined to include,
inter alia, "the holder of the bill of lading". It was quite disingenuous on
the appellants part to deny the existence of such a concept.

20\. The appellants, while submitting that the respondents were not the
persons entitled to receive the cargo, asserted that they need not "prove who
(would) be the legal cargo receiver". However, they volunteered the view that
the legal cargo receiver were "the shippers", presumably they meant, Pacific
Sugar. But under the terms of the B/L, "the shipper" would include "the holder
of the bill of lading". With respect, we thought it was absurd for the
appellants to so suggest when all the three original copies of the B/L had
already been transferred by Pacific Sugar to the respondents. Pacific Sugar
had already been paid for the cargo and would not have any basis whatsoever to
make any claim to the cargo.

**

Strong cause

**

21\. We now turn to the second main issue, the question of strong cause, which
we do not think should detain us for long in the light of our views on the
first issue. The factors which a court should take into account are those
which are listed in 10 above. The weight which the court should accord to each
factor is a matter of judgment in the light of the nature of the claim and all
the surrounding circumtances. However, this exercise is not just a numbers
game. It does not follow that because a greater number of factors favour one
approach, that approach would necessarily be adopted by the court. The weight
to be given to each factor is not the same. We recognised that in this case
the B/L was governed by Vietnamese law and the appellants were resident in
Vietnam. The respondents were a Hong Kong company, although they had since
moved their operations to Singapore. But once it is shown that there is no
defence to the claim, and thus no dispute, as in the present case, then there
is really nothing to go for trial at the contractual forum. In these
circumstances to insist, as the appellants had, that the claim should
nevertheless proceed to trial in the contractual forum would cast considerable
doubt as to the bona fides of that party in wanting to have a trial in the
contractual forum.

22\. In _The Vishva Prabha_ [1979] 2 Lloyds Rep 286, the plaintiffs shipped
bales of cloth on board the defendants vessel. However, there was a hole in
the bulkhead of the hold. Oil went through the hole and damaged the cloth. The
plaintiffs brought an action in England despite the existence of a
jurisdiction clause referring any dispute to the place of the carriers
principal place of business, Bombay. The plaintiffs asserted that the hole had
been in the bulkhead even before the loading of the goods, so that the
defendants had no defence to the plaintiffs claim. All the defendants could do
was to suggest that the hole could have been caused by an act of sabotage that
occurred after the goods had been loaded into the hold. Sheen J, having
examined the allegation of sabotage, rejected it. He said (at p.288):

> Apart from the suggestion of sabotage in Boulogue, as a suggestion that
> cannot be excluded, the shipowners have not at any stage since the damage
> occurred suggested any defence to this claim. I am left in no doubt that as
> to that part of the claim there is no dispute at all. I hold that there is
> no dispute on the question of liability, which ought to be submitted to the
> Court in India.

23\. In _The Jian He_ this court had reviewed three other cases where a
similar approach was also taken: _The Atlantic Song_ [1983] 3 Lloyds Rep 394,
_The Frank Pais_[1986] 1 Lloyds Rep 529 and _Standard Chartered Bank v
Pakistan National Shipping Corp_ [1995] 2 Lloyds Rep 365. We do not propose to
traverse over them again. What those cases show is that this Court is entitled
to look into the alleged defence to see whether there is any real substance in
it.

24\. Reverting to the instant appeal, we did not think there was any dispute
to be submitted for trial at the contractual forum. There would be no sense in
staying the proceedings. It seemed to us that the appellants were really
seeking to gain a technical advantage in asking for a stay. Furthermore, any
stay would only cause unnecessary delay.

25\. Finally, the appellants had also made the point that there was a dispute
as to the correct measure of damage, asserting that the loss should be based
on the market value of the cargo at the discharge port and not the contract
value, citing, ironically, the Privy Council case from Singapore _Jag Shakti_
[1986] 1 Lloyds Rep 1, in support. This would suggest that the Vietnamese law
on quantum of damages was the same as that applied by the Singapore/English
courts. In the statement of claim the respondents claim was also based on the
"arrived value of the cargo". Thus, the applicable principle was not in
dispute. The "arrived value" would be that as at Beihai, China, not Vietnam.
To insist that the mere determination of the value warranted a trial in
Vietnam seemed again to us to indicate a desire for delay or other procedural
advantages.

26\. In the premises, we were satisfied that a strong cause had been shown and
the stay application should be refused. Thus, we upheld the decision of the
learned judge below.

27\. Before we conclude, we ought to mention that various other matters had
also been raised by the respondents in their affidavits which they thought
were germane to the courts consideration of the stay application. Among them
were the following : doubts as to the competence of the Vietnamese judges on
maritime law; doubts as to the independence of the Vietnamese courts; and the
question whether the maritime law of Vietnam was sufficiently developed. We
must point out at once that it is not for this court or any court in Singapore
to pass judgment on the competence or independence of the judiciary of another
country , all the more so of a friendly country. Comity between nations would
be gravely undermined if such a wholly invidious pursuit is embarked upon. We
have to disregard entirely such arguments. Equally it is not for this court to
say whether the maritime law of Vietnam is sufficiently developed, especially
when the parties themselves had agreed that Vietnam law would apply to the
B/L. We would observe that all these matters are wholly alien to the factors
enunciated by Brandon J in _The Eleftheria_(supra) which the court ought to
give consideration to.
