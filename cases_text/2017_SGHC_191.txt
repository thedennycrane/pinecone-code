High Court — Suit No 542 of 2012  
George Wei J  
1 August 2017

7 August 2017

George Wei J:

Introduction

1 This action arose out of a contract between the plaintiff, PT Sandipala
Arthaputra (“Sandipala”), and the second defendant, Oxel Systems Pte Ltd
(“Oxel”), for the supply of microchips (“chips”) from the first defendant,
STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“ST-AP”). In PT Sandipala Arthraputra
v STMicroElectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others [2017] SGHC 102 (“the
Judgment”) which sets out the facts of the action in full, I dismissed
Sandipala’s claims against the defendants, while allowing Oxel’s counterclaim
against Sandipala and the second and third defendants in the counterclaim, Mr
Paulus Tannos (“Mr Tannos”) and Ms Catherine Tannos (“Ms Tannos”).

2 Oxel has requested clarifications with regard to [284(c)] of the Judgment,
in which I awarded Oxel interest in respect of the other awards it was
entitled to. These clarifications relate to details such as the dates from
which the awarded sums of interest are to run. All parties attended before me
in chambers on 1 August 2017 for a short hearing on this issue, where counsel
for Sandipala, Mr Tannos and Ms Tannos confirmed that his clients had no
objections to the clarifications proposed by Oxel. Accordingly, I provide the
necessary clarifications in this supplemental judgment.

Orders made in the Judgment

3 I set out the relevant parts in [284(b)-(c)] of the Judgment here:

(b) Oxel’s counterclaim against Sandipala as well as its counterclaim against
Sandipala, Mr Tannos and Ms Tannos are allowed as follows:

(i) Oxel is entitled to the price of the 4,805,875 chips that were delivered
in the fifth to ninth shipments. Oxel is also entitled to the price of the
6,457,414 chips in the tenth to 15th shipments (amounting to 11,263,289 chips
altogether). The total award for price is assessed at US$5,406,378.72.

(ii) Oxel is entitled to US$279,813.36 being the down payment in respect of
2,331,778 chips.

(iii) Oxel is entitled to US$15,960,654.65 being the losses suffered by Oxel
in respect of the payments made to Danatel and Logii.

(iv) Oxel is entitled to a pro-rated sum for its loss of profits for the
remaining 87,668,222 chips amounting to US$175,336.44.

…

(c) Oxel is entitled to interest as follows:

(i) Interest at the contractual rate of 1.5% per month for the price of the
chips that was assessed at US$5,406,378.72 and the down payments assessed at
US$279,813.36.

(ii) Interest at the usual rate for the other awards.

Clarifications on interest to be paid to Oxel at the contractual rate

4 At [284(c)(i)] of the Judgment, I awarded Oxel interest “at the contractual
rate of 1.5% per month for the price of the chips that was assessed at
US$5,406,378.72 and the down payments assessed at US$279,813.36.” This
contractual rate was based on Oxel’s standard terms and conditions,
incorporated by reference into the agreement of 9 November 2011 under which
Oxel was to supply 100m chips to Sandipala (“the Agreement”) (see [34] of the
Judgment). Oxel’s standard terms and conditions provided that all invoiced
sums were due and payable to Oxel by the 30th day following the dates of the
invoices, and that interest would be imposed on all late payments at a rate of
1.5% per month.

Interest in respect of the US$5,406,378.72 award

5 My award of US$5,406,378.72 to Oxel was in respect of 11,263,289 chips which
were delivered to Sandipala between January to April 2012. During this period,
Oxel issued 11 invoices to Sandipala seeking payment for the delivered chips,
but Sandipala did not settle these invoices.

6 The interest on each of the 11 invoiced sums shall therefore run from the
31st day following the date of each invoice, at the contractual rate of 1.5%
per month, as set out in the following table:

No| Amount (US$)| Date from which interest is to run  
---|---|---  
1| 241,003.68| 12 February 2012  
2| 266,216.16| 18 February 2012  
3| 539,942.88| 20 February 2012  
4| 733,816.32| 4 March 2012  
5| 525,840.96| 11 March 2012  
6| 447,300.96| 22 March 2012  
7| 422,864.64| 29 March 2012  
8| 376,225.92| 2 April 2012  
9| 294,960.00| 10 April 2012  
10| 1,292,577.60| 11 May 2012  
11| 265,629.60| 17 May 2012  
  
Interest in respect of the US$279,813.36 award

7 My award of US$279,813.36 to Oxel was in respect of the unpaid 20% down
payment on 2,331,778 chips delivered to Sandipala (see [258] of the Judgment).
On 26 January 2012, Oxel issued an invoice to Sandipala for this down payment.
Under Oxel’s standard terms and conditions, the down payment was due and
payable to Oxel by 25 February 2012, ie, 30 days after the invoice date.

8 The interest in respect of the sum of US$279,813.36 shall therefore run from
26 February 2012, at the contractual rate of 1.5% per month.

Clarifications on interest to be paid to Oxel at the usual rate

9 At [284(c)(ii)] of the Judgment, I awarded Oxel interest “at the usual rate
for the other awards.” Section 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) empowers the
High Court to order pre-judgment interest on any debt or damages to be
recovered. Parties did not dispute that the “usual rate” of interest should be
pegged at 5.33% per annum as directed in paras 4 and 5 of the Supreme Court
Practice Directions No 1 of 2007.

10 Counsel for Oxel specifically sought clarification on the following two
sums:

(a) my award of US$15,960,654.65, being the losses suffered by Oxel in respect
of the payments made to PT Danatel Pratama (“Danatel”) and Logii Inc (“Logii”)
(see [275] of the Judgment]); and

(b) my award of US$175,336.44, being a pro-rated sum for Oxel’s loss of
profits for 87,668,222 chips (see [279] of the Judgment).

Interest in respect of the US$15,960,654.65 award

11 The interest on each of the sums comprising the US$15,960,654.65 award
shall run at the default rate of 5.33% per annum, in the manner set out in the
following table:

No| Amount (US$)| Date from which interest is to run  
---|---|---  
1| 783,650.34| 2 January 2013  
2| 10,165,023.04| 21 December 2013  
3| 1,515,585.91| 16 October 2015  
4| 1,666,012.81| 27 October 2015  
5| 1,830,382.55| 30 December 2015  
  
12 I note that these sums take into account Sandipala’s payment of
US$7,374,403.24 for 1,068,489 chips. These dates represent the dates of the
latest five of Oxel’s seven payments to Danatel and Logii, plus one day.

Interest in respect of the US$175,336.44 award

13 According to the Agreement, Oxel was to deliver all 100m chips to Sandipala
by the end of the fourth quarter of 2012, thus the latest possible invoice
date would have been 31 December 2012. Any invoiced sum would have been due
and payable to Oxel by the 30th day following the invoice date, and interest
should start running one day thereafter.

14 The interest in respect of the sum of US$175,336.44 shall therefore run
from 31 January 2013, at the default rate of 5.33% per annum.
