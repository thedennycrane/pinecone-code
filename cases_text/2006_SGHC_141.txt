Woo Bih Li J:

1 The parties, Tan Tian Seong (“the Husband”) and Koh Mui Noi (“the Wife”),
were married on 9 April 1984. They have three sons with the following ages:

(a) |  the eldest child |  - |  18 years old (as at 27 April 2004)  
---|---|---|---  
(b) |  the second child |  - |  16 years old (as at 27 April 2004)  
(c) |  the third child |  - |  15 years old (as at 27 April 2004).  
  
2 The ages of the parties, also as at 27 April 2004, were:

(a) |  the Husband |  - |  53 years old  
---|---|---|---  
(b) |  the Wife |  - |  55 years old.  
  
3 Due to differences between the parties, they led separate lives since
mid-1998 and seldom spoke to each other except on matters relating to the
children or to finance. A domestic maid did the laundry and cleaning of the
matrimonial home which was 53 Serenade Walk (“the matrimonial home”). The
Wife’s sister, Koh Khar Noi (“KKN”), did the marketing and cooking with the
assistance of the maid.

4 Eventually the Wife presented a divorce petition on the ground of separation
for more than four years. A decree _nisi_ was granted by the court on 5 March
2004. The ancillaries were heard by me.

5 As regards the matrimonial home, KKN claimed a 27.8% interest therein. The
Husband initially acknowledged KKN’s interest but changed his position because
he said he was misled into thinking that KKN had been paying for part of the
mortgage instalments.

6 Mr Vincent Yeoh, counsel for the Wife, submitted that KKN’s claim was not
part of the ancillaries to be determined as between the Husband and Wife. He
also submitted that I should make an order regarding the sale of the
matrimonial home and direct the setting aside of 27.8% of the net sale
proceeds pending a subsequent resolution of KKN’s claim in respect of the
matrimonial home. This approach was not contested by the Husband’s counsel, Ms
Ng Pui Khim and Ms Devi Haridas. In any event, I agreed that KKN’s claim was
not part of the ancillaries to be determined by me.

7 On 5 May 2006, I made various orders on the ancillaries. The main orders
were:

(a) Custody, care and control of the three children would be granted to the
Wife with reasonable access to the Husband.

(b) The Husband was to pay maintenance for the children as follows:

(i) the eldest - $550 (comprising $400 + $500 – $350 from National Service)
per month

(ii) the second - $1,200 (comprising $700 + $500) per month

(iii) the third - $1,700 (comprising $1,200 + $500) per month. This included
tuition fees.

The first component for each child was for his personal expenses and the
second component was fixed at $500 per month for his share of the household
expenses.

(c) The Husband was to pay maintenance of $350 per month for the Wife.

(d) Maintenance for the Wife and for the children was to commence from 1 May
2006, a date which counsel did not object to.

(e) After setting aside 27.8% for KKN’s claim of an interest in the
matrimonial home, I granted the Wife 36% of the balance and the Husband 64%.
Consequential orders were made regarding the sale of the matrimonial home.
Details of the consequential orders are stated in my oral judgment of 5 May
2006 and I need not repeat them here.

(f) Of the other matrimonial assets, I found the Husband to hold assets
amounting to $494,881.72 and the Wife to hold assets amounting to $136,253.65.
I granted the Wife 40% and the Husband 60% of the aggregate of the other
matrimonial assets and made consequential orders thereon. Again, details may
be found in my oral judgment.

8 Each party was dissatisfied with certain aspects of my decision and has
appealed in respect of those aspects.

**Custody, care and control of the three children**

9 My decision on the matter of custody, care and control of the children was
made by consent. The Husband did not seek joint custody but only reasonable
access. Accordingly, this matter is not the subject of either party’s appeal.

**Maintenance**

10 The Husband is dissatisfied with the maintenance orders I made for the
three children while the Wife is dissatisfied with the maintenance order I
made for her. Therefore, there are cross-appeals in respect of maintenance.

11 I will elaborate on my decision for the maintenance of the Wife first.

12 The Husband was working as an accountant with Sing Lin & Company Pte Ltd.
According to the Wife’s calculation, the Husband’s net income, after taking
into account bonuses and his own contribution to his Central Provident Fund
(“CPF”) account and some share dividends, was around $7,710 per month. The
Husband’s calculation indicated his net income was, say, $6,960 per month in
2004 (Year of Assessment 2005). The difference between the Wife’s calculation
of $7,710 and the Husband’s calculation of $6,960 may have been due to the
fact that Mr Yeoh had not taken into account that there is a cap on the amount
of bonuses which attract a contribution to CPF.

13 The Wife sought $1,494.70 per month as her personal expenses which were:

Handphone |  $30.00  
---|---  
Cosmetics |  $50.00  
Hairdo |  $60.00  
Medical and dental checkups |  $50.00  
Gastric medicine |  $31.20  
Chinese medicine |  $200.00  
Shoes and handbags |  $40.00  
Clothing |  $50.00  
Car - Petrol |  $300.00  
Road tax |  $65.50  
Insurance |  $78.00  
Servicing |  $60.00  
Parking and electronic road pricing (“ERP”) |    
$80.00  
Family entertainment, holidays and miscellaneous |  $400.00  
|  $1,494.70  
  
14 The Husband’s response to such personal expenses was as follows:

(a) The handphone was a luxury item as he himself did not carry one. Moreover
he had not been asked to pay for the Wife’s handphone bills during the
marriage.

(b) He had never paid for the Wife’s cosmetic expenses nor her handbags, shoes
and clothes.

(c) The sum claimed by the Wife for medical and dental check-ups was
excessive. He worked out a reasonable sum to be $14.58 per month. I do need to
elaborate on the formula he used. The Husband also said he was not aware that
the Wife was suffering from gastric pains and there was no documentary
evidence of expenses for gastric medicine (although she appeared to have
claimed and been paid the same before).

(d) The Husband did not contribute to the acquisition of the car. He used to
reimburse the Wife for petrol charges as she was ferrying the children to and
from school. However, the children had become old enough to take public
transport. As for the road tax, servicing and insurance, the Husband said he
had not been asked to pay for the same before.

(e) The Husband considered the sum claimed for parking and ERP to be high. The
family stayed in a landed property and he was not aware of the Wife having to
drive under ERP gantries to do household chores. I noted he did not elaborate
whether she had to go through such gantries while fetching the children to and
fro. Nevertheless, the Husband also said that the Wife often drove KKN to
various places.

(f) The Husband also said he had not been paying for the Wife’s holiday and
entertainment expenses and he required elaboration of the miscellaneous
expenses claimed.

15 If the Husband was required to pay the Wife’s personal expenses, he was
prepared to pay only $44.58 a month since he had not been paying for most of
the items claimed during the marriage.

16 As for the share of each member of the family for household expenses, the
Wife had set out a list of such expenses amounting to $3,525.20 per month for
six persons _ie_ , the Husband, the Wife, the three children and KKN. She
suggested that this sum be divided by six to reach an average of, say, $558.00
per person. The Husband, however, considered some of the sums claimed to be
unnecessary or excessive. He was also suggesting that the household expenses
such as food and groceries be divided by seven, including the maid, but the
rest should be divided by four namely the Wife and the three children. Based
on the Husband’s calculation, the household expenses for four persons would
amount to $950.65 which worked out to, say, $238.00 per person per month.
This, however, was on the basis that he was also of the view that it was
unnecessary to provide for a maid as the children were no longer young. I set
out below his tabulation of the Wife’s claim, then the Wife’s claim if based
on a household of four persons and then his position based on four persons.

**S/N** |  **Item** |  **Wife’s position** |  **Wife’s position, but based on a  
household of four persons** |  **Husband’s position**

|  **Total** : |  _$3,755.20_ |  |  _$950.65_  
  
17 It seemed to me that although the children were not young any more, the
Husband should not exclude expenses in relation to the maid since he also
expected the Wife to go back to work part-time, if not full-time. Also, as Mr
Yeoh stressed, the Wife was already not claiming rent for alternative
accommodation although the matrimonial home was to be sold. In the
circumstances, I was inclined to allow more of what the Wife was claiming as
household expenses and I determined a reasonable sum, for maintenance
purposes, to be $500.00 per month for each of the Wife and the three children.

18 If I allowed the Wife’s personal expenses as claimed by her, _ie_ ,
$1,494.70 per month and add her share of $500.00 per month as household
expenses, the aggregate would be just below $2,000.00 per month. This is not
much if compared with the Husband’s assessment of his average monthly expenses
of $3,080.00, which comprised the following:

Food and living expenses |  $600.00  
---|---  
His parents (although he has other siblings) |  $400.00  
Transport (public transport) |  $200.00  
Utilities (anticipated) |  $80.00  
Telephone, cable TV and Broadband Internet bills |  $100.00  
Rentals |  $1,200.00  
Entertainment and recreation (including wedding  
dinners) |    
$150.00  
Clothes and shoes |  $50.00  
Income tax |  $300.00  
|  _$3,080.00_  
  
19 I was of the view that as the Wife was not claiming rental, the Husband
should also not be claiming rental. The matrimonial home was to be sold and
with reimbursement to his CPF account and since he was going to reach 55 in
2006 soon after the hearing before me, he would be able to withdraw some
moneys from his CPF account. If she was to work, she too would have to pay
taxes just as he would have to do. If his rental and income tax were excluded,
his monthly expenses would be $3,080.00 – $1,500.00 = $1,580.00, much less
than the Wife’s $2,000.00 per month because the Wife would have to maintain a
maid and was also maintaining a car. In any event, the Wife was only claiming
$1,494.70 per month for her personal expenses because she was not claiming
maintenance for her share of household expenses. The reason why I have spent
some time on the household expenses is because she is claiming the children’s
share of household expenses which I shall come back to later. The Wife was
also seeking lump sum maintenance for herself with a multiplier of 11 years or
132 months, relying on a few case law authorities. This would work out to
$1,494.70 per month x 132 months = $197,300.40.

20 On the other hand, the Husband’s position was that the Wife should not be
given any maintenance in view of her earning capacity or, alternatively,
nominal maintenance.

21 The main issue in respect of maintenance for the Wife was her earning
capacity. The Husband said that the Wife was a fully qualified, London-trained
beauty therapist. She was a full-time beautician before the marriage and had,
during the marriage, been working as a part-time beautician, until she said
she stopped working around 2001, _ie_ , three years before his first affidavit
of 27 April 2004. On the other hand, the Wife said that she had completely
stopped working as a beautician in 1986 after the birth of the first child
and, at her age of 55 in 2004, she would not be able to obtain employment,
whether full-time or part-time.

22 There was in evidence some statements of account relating to the Wife’s CPF
account. They showed that there were some contributions to that account in the
second half of 1992 and for 1993 up to January 1994. Her employer was stated
to be The Blue Angels – Hairstylist and Beautician. When the Wife was
confronted with such evidence during her cross-examination and asked whether
she had received her half-yearly CPF statements, she promptly claimed that she
had received the statements of account when the Husband showed them to her
solicitors. This prompted her own counsel, Mr Yeoh, to stand up and clarify,
as he should, that it was he who had applied for such statements pursuant to
an earlier order of court. It seemed to me that the Wife’s response in respect
of how she received such statements demonstrated a lack of credibility on her
part.

23 The Wife also sought to rely on an affidavit by Mdm Wong Ah Khew (alias
Wong Peng Khew) who was operating the salon in question from November 1977 to
May 1994. Mdm Wong denied that she had made any contribution to the Wife’s
account between 1992 and 1994. I considered the CPF statements of account to
be more reliable evidence than Mdm Wong’s affidavit.

24 I also noticed that para 9 of the Wife’s fifth affidavit of 20 July 2005
suggested that the credits in her CPF statements of account might have been
due to the Husband making such payments for “purposes best known to him”
because she believed she had given blank cheques to the Husband in the past. I
was of the view that this was a desperate suggestion in the face of the
documentary evidence against the Wife. There was no reason for the Husband to
make payments into her CPF account, let alone to do so without informing her.
Besides, those payments would have been reflected as debit entries in her bank
statements and she was not the sort of person who would have sat quietly by
without seeking an explanation. I therefore rejected such a suggestion.

25 Furthermore, the Husband said that the tax returns submitted for the Wife
indicated she had been earning employment income up to about 2001. The income
tax assessments for the Wife from Years of Assessment 1987 to 2001 showed her
annual employment income to vary between $12,000 and $24,000 a year. The
Wife’s position was that she had left it to the Husband to fill up the joint
income tax returns as he was the accountant. She found tax matters too
complicated for her. Yet, she admitted that she had signed the tax returns
which had to be submitted before the assessment was done and she did not claim
to have signed the tax returns while they were blank or incomplete.

26 I noted that the Wife was not the simple person she portrayed herself to
be. For example, she used to set out in detail items of expenses for each
month when she was seeking reimbursement from the Husband in the past. I did
not think she was as much in the dark about her income tax returns as she
claimed. When she signed the tax returns, she must have realised what her
annual employment income was stated to be. Indeed, the Husband’s position was
that it was she who told him what her annual employment income was.

27 Besides, there was no logical reason for the Husband to declare employment
income for her if in fact she was not earning the same. It would have been
foolish of him to attract tax on her declared employment income if in fact she
had no employment income. Furthermore, as he asserted, he was also denying
himself the opportunity to claim wife relief by declaring that she was earning
employment income. Mr Yeoh must have realised the weakness of the Wife’s
position in the light of the income tax returns and assessments. Accordingly,
he suggested that the Husband had continued to declare the Wife’s employment
income over several years because the Husband had to satisfy a mortgagee of
the matrimonial home that both the Husband and the Wife were employed in order
that the mortgagee would not withdraw a loan granted in 1986 or 1987. The
Husband denied this. Moreover, there was no independent evidence to show that
the couple were in arrears of their mortgage instalment payments or that the
mortgagee required annual proof of dual income before allowing the loan to
continue. It seemed to me that Mr Yeoh’s suggestion was borne out of
desperation in the face of the tax returns and assessments.

28 Thirdly, the Wife’s Post Office Savings Bank (“POSB”) passbook showed that,
for example, between January 2000 and May 2000, there were various cash
deposits therein ranging from $500 to $10,000, if the smaller deposits are
ignored. Paragraph 6 of the Wife’s affidavit of 16 June 2004 stated that the
deposits of $500, $5,000 and $10,000 in late February 2000 belonged to KKN.
The Wife alleged that she and KKN were out then and the moneys were deposited
into the Wife’s POSB account for convenience, since KKN did not have her
passbook with her. That was why the moneys were withdrawn soon after the
deposits were made. This explanation suggested that all the three deposits
were in cash but that was not the case. Two were transfers from another
account and one was a cheque deposit for $10,000. Furthermore, in cross-
examination, the Wife gave a different explanation. She said that the deposits
were repayments by a cousin who had borrowed money from KKN. The cousin had
handed cash to the Wife which the Wife had deposited into her own POSB account
first. This explanation did not satisfactorily explain transfers of moneys
from an account to the Wife’s account or the cheque deposit. The Wife tried to
explain the transfers from another account to hers by saying that she and this
cousin were very close and this cousin had her account number to transfer
moneys to. Interestingly, KKN had said in para 3 of her 16 June 2004 affidavit
that the deposits of $500, $5,000 and $10,000 into the Wife’s POSB account
towards end February 2000 were moneys which she (and not the Wife) received
from the cousin Koh Cheng Chang who had borrowed the sums earlier from her
(KKN). KKN said that, for convenience, KKN had deposited the cash or cheque
into the Wife’s POSB account first but this explanation was contradicted by
the fact that the deposits of $500 and $5,000 in late February 2000 were
inter-bank transfers as I have said. Furthermore, there were other deposits of
$1,000 to $5,000 between January 2000 and May 2000 for which no explanation
was given by the Wife. Therefore, I did not accept KKN’s or the Wife’s
explanation in respect of the three deposits they chose to respond to.

29 The Wife had also sought to rely on an affidavit from the eldest child
stating that he was not aware of his mother having worked part-time or full-
time after he was born. I did not give any weight to his assertion in the
light of the CPF statements and income tax returns and assessments which he
was obviously unaware of. The Wife should not have involved him on this issue.

30 It seemed to me that the Wife had another source of income which she was
not prepared to admit to.

31 In the light of the documentary evidence, it was immaterial that the
Husband did not have more information about the Wife’s past employment. I was
persuaded that, notwithstanding her age, the Wife had a capacity to earn
income of between $1,000 and $2,000 even if she was able to get part-time work
only. Since she was claiming maintenance of $1,494.70 per month only, I was of
the view initially that she should be able to maintain herself, especially if
I were to order the Husband to maintain the children without any contribution
from her. Therefore, I considered initially whether I should allow her only a
nominal sum of $1.00 maintenance to preserve her claim for maintenance in the
future for herself. However, the Husband had at one time offered the Wife
$350.00 per month for herself even when their marriage was deteriorating. At
that time the Wife had declined the offer for a reason which I need not
elaborate on. In the light of that offer, I ordered the Husband to pay
maintenance of $350.00 per month for the Wife from 1 May 2006. He is not
appealing against this aspect of my decision but the Wife is, as presumably
she wants more.

32 In the circumstances, the question of a lump sum maintenance of the quantum
sought by the Wife was academic. In any event, the Husband himself is getting
on in years. He alleged that he would retire when he reached 60 years of age
under “current employment rules”. It was not clear to me whether he meant the
rules of his employer or rules under legislation. In any event, it seemed to
me preferable to order maintenance for the Wife on a monthly basis so that
subsequent developments may be taken into account, if necessary. There was
also no suggestion that the Husband would default in his maintenance
obligation if he was gainfully employed.

33 The dispute regarding the quantum of the maintenance for each of the
children centred on two main points, _ie_ , whether the maintenance should
include tuition fees for the third child and the quantum of the household
expenses.

34 In principle, I saw no reason why the tuition fees for the third child
should be disallowed when the Husband had paid for such fees prior to the
filing of the divorce petition. In the case of the eldest child, the tuition
fees of $1,100.00 per month were no longer relevant because he was no longer
schooling and was doing his National Service, earning $350.00 per month. I did
take into account the latter and reduced the maintenance for him accordingly.

35 In the case of the second child, there was no tuition fee, as such, to be
considered and so no dispute in respect of his personal expenses.

36 The tuition fees for the third child amounted to $950.00 per month and I
allowed this in addition to other personal expenses. Accordingly I ordered
$1,200.00 per month maintenance for his personal expenses.

37 As for the household expenses, the Husband’s position was that they
amounted to $950.65 for the reasons I have given. Divided between the Wife and
three children, this worked out to, say, $238.00 per person. He was prepared
to pay the following maintenance for each of the children (_ie_ , for the
personal and household expenses of each):

(a) $300.00 for the eldest child,

(b) $600.00 for the second child, and

(c) $500.00 for the third child.

The above figures were taken from the submission for him and were higher than
what he had initially offered in paras 15 to 17 of his second affidavit of 18
May 2004.

38 The above figures from the written submission did not elaborate on how the
Husband had added up the personal expenses and household expenses for each
child. For example, he had accepted that the personal expenses for the second
child were $687.50 per month. Even if I were to accept his calculation of
$238.00 per month for each child’s household expenses, the total for the
second child’s maintenance would be, say, $925.00 per month and not the
$600.00 per month he had offered.

39 However, from the Husband’s affidavits, I learnt that he was suggesting
that in addition to the Wife not receiving any maintenance, the Wife should
also contribute to each of the children’s maintenance. However, the Husband
did not elaborate as to how much she should contribute. Working backwards in
the case of the second child, it seemed, for example, that he was suggesting
that she should contribute $325.00 per month, if I accepted his figures.
Working backwards, she would also have to contribute between $300.00 and
$400.00 for the eldest child and even more for the third child since the
tuition fees alone for the third child (which he refused to pay for) amounted
to $950.00 per month.

40 As I have mentioned above, I determined each child’s share of the household
expenses to be $500.00 and not $238.00 per month. This meant that if I allowed
the Husband to pay what he proposed in submission, the Wife would be bearing
the greater part of the burden of maintaining the children even though it was
not suggested that her earning capacity was as great as his.

41 I found the Husband’s proposal for maintenance for the children
unreasonable, especially when he was also proposing no maintenance for the
Wife. Furthermore, he used to hand over about $4,000 per month at one time to
the Wife for various expenses. This figure of about $4,000 was found in some
hand-written notes on pieces of paper which the Wife gave him to claim each
month’s allowance from him.

42 As the Husband was to pay only $350.00 per month maintenance for the Wife
and bearing in mind his larger earning capacity and what he used to provide, I
was of the view that he was able to afford and should fully maintain each
child based on (a) the undisputed figures for their personal expenses, (b) my
allowance of tuition fees for the third child and (c) my determination that
each child’s share of household expenses was $500.00 per month. The actual
maintenance for each child is already stated in [7(b)] above and I need not
repeat it. The total, including the maintenance for the Wife, is still less
than $4,000.00 per month.

**Matrimonial assets**

43 I come now to the division of matrimonial assets. The parties dealt with
the matrimonial home separately from the rest of the matrimonial assets (“the
other matrimonial assets”). This has been a common practice in divorce
proceedings and I proceeded along the same lines. On further reflection, I
wonder whether such an approach should be adopted for other divorce
proceedings and whether a better approach would be to consider the matrimonial
home together with the other matrimonial assets. For example, it may be
fortuitous whether a wife uses her money to pay proportionately more for the
monthly instalments on a mortgage than for household expenses or _vice versa_.

44 Coming back to the case at hand, the financial contribution by each party
to the acquisition of the matrimonial home was largely undisputed save for a
down payment of $132,900.00. The down payment was paid by a cheque issued on
the Wife’s bank account but the dispute was as to who had provided her with
the moneys to make that payment.

45 The Husband’s position was that he had provided the moneys from his
savings. He had put the moneys into the Wife’s account because at that time he
did not have an account from which he could issue cheques. Hence, whenever he
wanted payments to be made by cheque, he would deposit the cash into the
Wife’s account and she would issue the cheque for the requisite amount. He
illustrated this by exhibiting documents in relation to a separate
transaction.[note: 1]

46 Interestingly, when Mr Yeoh applied in chambers to cross-examine the
Husband, Mr Yeoh informed me that one of the issues on which the Husband was
to be cross-examined was the source of the moneys for the down payment. Yet,
when the Husband was being cross-examined, Mr Yeoh refrained from cross-
examining the Husband on this issue. This was not an oversight because I
remember that I had asked Mr Yeoh in open court whether he was going to cross-
examine the Husband on this issue (in view of what he had informed me in
chambers). Mr Yeoh said he was not. Indeed, upon hearing my query, the Husband
indicated that he would welcome any question on this issue but Mr Yeoh did not
take up the challenge. I drew an adverse inference from Mr Yeoh’s omission. I
also considered the Husband’s willingness to be questioned on this issue to be
persuasive of the fact that he was telling the truth.

47 However, that was not all. When the Wife was cross-examined on her source
of moneys for the down payment, she said that the moneys were given to her by
her late mother who did not give her the moneys in a lump sum but in various
sums. There was a dispute as to whether her mother had the mental capacity to
do so as, according to the Husband, her mother was already suffering from
dementia when they were married on 9 April 1984 whereas the matrimonial home
was purchased in 1989. I did not have to decide whether the mother had the
mental capacity to give the sums of money alleged because I was not persuaded
by the Wife’s explanation, in cross-examination, that her mother gave her the
sums of money to look after another sister who was mentally retarded, _ie_ ,
one Koh Mui Tiam who passed away in January 2003. If the Wife’s explanation
were true, then she would not have used the moneys to buy the matrimonial home
but to look after Mui Tiam, even if Mui Tiam was to stay with the couple at
the matrimonial home. I mention this only because I note that para 21 of the
Husband’s first affidavit of 27 April 2004 and para 11 of the Husband’s sixth
affidavit of 22 August 2005 mention that the Wife’s late sister had lived with
them. However, the Wife did not assert in affidavit or in cross-examination
that she had used the moneys meant for the care of Mui Tiam to pay the down
payment because Mui Tiam would be living with them. Furthermore, if the down
payment was to be some sort of investment for Mui Tiam in the matrimonial home
(which the Wife again did not allege in any event) the Wife would have told
the Husband of this just as the Husband was told of KKN’s interest in the
matrimonial home.

48 Accordingly, I found the Husband’s explanation to be more credible and I
accepted that the moneys for the down payment came from him.

49 There was a minor difference on the monthly instalments paid by the
Husband. To Mr Yeoh’s credit, he was prepared not to take issue with the minor
difference alleged in the Husband’s figures which credited the Husband with
having paid $2,197 more than the Wife’s calculation of his contribution. In
the circumstances, I found that the Husband’s direct financial contribution to
acquire the matrimonial home to be:

(a) from his CPF account - $317,872.90

(b) the down payment - _$132,900.00_

_$450,772.90_

50 Excluding a payment made by the Wife which was allegedly for KKN’s interest
and which interest would be dealt with separately in another forum, I found
that the Wife’s direct financial contribution in respect of the matrimonial
home, and not confined to the acquisition thereof, to be:

(a) from her CPF account - $20,000.00

(b) repairs and improvements - _$10,519.25_

_$30,519.25_

51 The Husband did not dispute the amount the Wife said she had spent as
repairs and improvements but suggested that this should not be taken into
account as he too had made payments towards repairs and improvements. I did
not doubt that the Husband had also paid for repairs and improvements but he
did not provide any specific evidence for such payments. For direct financial
contribution, I had to disregard whatever he might have contributed towards
repairs and improvements but I did not disregard the Wife’s claim for the
same.

52 The total of the Husband’s and the Wife’s financial contributions in
respect of the matrimonial home was therefore $481,292.15. Of this, the
Husband provided, say, 94% (actually 93.66%) and the Wife, say, 6% (actually
6.34%).

53 I also had to consider the Wife’s indirect contribution because it was not
disputed that she was the primary caregiver in respect of the three children.
In the circumstances, it is not necessary to elaborate on allegations made by
the Wife and the eldest child to show how distant the Husband was as a father
which the Husband had sought to counter. Even if he could or should have spent
more time with the children, he did provide for them and the Wife financially.
I hasten to add that I am not suggesting that it is good enough for a man to
provide financially for his family. As the saying goes, there are some things
which money cannot buy. Having said that, I am not saying that the Husband was
totally distant. Suffice it for me to say that I found that he was not close
to the children. However, I also took into account that I was not able to give
him any credit for his financial contributions to repairs and improvements for
the matrimonial home and that the Wife had the assistance of a maid and her
sister (KKN) for the household chores.

54 All things considered, I was of the view that after leaving aside 27.8% to
be determined later in respect of KKN’s interest, it would be fair to give the
Wife an additional 30% of the balance of the matrimonial home. With her direct
contribution of 6%, her aggregate share amounted to 36% and the Husband’s
would correspondingly be 64%. I would add that Mr Yeoh had asked for a lower
figure of 20% for the Wife’s indirect contribution. I did not hold him to this
because his submission appeared to be premised on the basis that the Wife
would succeed on her assertion about the source of the moneys for the down
payment and hence increase her share of the financial contribution in respect
of the matrimonial home. In future, counsel will have to be more careful as
the court may not grant such indulgence always. Having said that, I would add
that Mr Yeoh was, generally speaking, quite a formidable opponent to the
Husband’s counsel.

55 The Husband’s counsel also relied on three District Court cases to submit
that the parties’ CPF accounts should be reimbursed first from the sale
proceeds and then the net balance be distributed according to the shares I was
allowing to each of the couple. Suffice it for me to say that those cases were
peculiar to their facts and the general rule in the division of matrimonial
assets is not consistent with the approach advocated. Indeed, if the parties’
CPF accounts were reimbursed first, there would be some double-counting as I
have already taken into account, _inter alia_ , the payments made from their
CPF accounts in determining their respective shares of the matrimonial home.

56 I come now to the other matrimonial assets. I found such assets held by the
respective parties to be as follows:

_Husband_ |   
---|---  
CPF account |  $271,649.84  
Shares from CPF Investment Scheme |  $156,469.00  
POSB |  $29,485.65  
Other listed shares |  $4,777.23  
Painting |  _$32,500.00_  
|  _$494,881.72_  
  
_Wife_ |   
---|---  
POSB |  $1,471.69  
CPF |  $10,470.30  
Shares |  $5,767.00  
Car (after allowing for some depreciation) |  $24,000.00  
Jurong Country Club Social membership |  $1,300.00  
Jewellery |  $9,000.00  
One NTUC Life insurance policy No  
0061112636 |  $64,870.00  
Four AIA insurance policies |  _$19,374.66_  
|  _$136,253.65_  
  
I did not treat other NTUC policies and a Prudential policy as matrimonial
assets as they were educational policies. The Wife was to continue paying the
premiums for those NTUC policies and the husband was to continue paying the
premiums for the Prudential policy. The moneys payable on the maturity of
those policies were to be held in trust for the education of the child
concerned. I left it open to the parties to argue whether such policies should
be taken into account in any future application for variation of maintenance.

57 The total of the other matrimonial assets was:

$494,881.72 + $136,253.65 |  = $631,135.37  
---|---  
Husband’s portion was, say, 78% |  (actual was 78.41%)  
Wife’s portion was, say, 22% |  (actual was 21.59%)  
  
I adjusted the above portions to take into account the Wife’s indirect
contribution as the primary caregiver of the children so that the Wife was
given 40% of the total of the other matrimonial assets and the Husband was
given 60%. Rounded to the nearest dollar, 40% was $252,454.00. After
deducting, say, $136,254.00, being those assets held by the Wife, the Husband
was to give the wife $116,200.00. The Husband was allowed to pay the
$116,200.00 to the Wife from his share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial
home after setting aside a portion of the sale proceeds attributable to the
alleged share of KKN and paying off a bank loan secured by the matrimonial
home. I also made consequential orders in respect of the sale which are found
in my oral judgment.

58 There was no dispute on the other matrimonial assets held by the Husband.

59 The values of the Wife’s assets were provided mainly from her. The Wife
alleged that her shares, car, club membership and the NTUC Life insurance
policy No 0061112636 were paid from money given to her by a deceased brother.
The onus was on the Wife to establish her assertion and I was not persuaded
she had done so.

60 As for her jewellery, she claimed that she did not buy any and all were
given to her by her mother. The Husband, however, said that he knew the Wife
had bought diamonds. There was more jewellery in a safe deposit box in
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”) in the joint names of the
Wife and KKN which was said to belong to KKN solely except for some coins
therein which the Wife had bought for the children. The jewellery in the box
comprised one pendant, one ring, two bracelets and three necklaces. The Wife
did not provide any value for such jewellery. I found it hard to believe that
the Wife did not buy any jewellery. In any event, I was of the view that it
would be fair if I treated all the jewellery she had declared as hers,
although allegedly given by her mother, as part of the pool of matrimonial
assets and leave out the rest of the jewellery in the joint safe deposit box
from the pool.

61 The Wife and KKN held a joint account with OCBC which had a closing balance
of $226.77 as at 13 July 2005 and a joint account with POSB with a closing
balance of $1,444.45 as at 30 June 2005. The amounts involved were relatively
small and in view of the joint assertions that the moneys in these two
accounts belonged to KKN solely, I did not include these two accounts in the
pool.

**Reimbursement**

62 The Wife also wanted the Husband to reimburse her for a list of expenses
between 2001 and 2004 for which she said she had borrowed money from KKN to
pay. Her notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal does not appear to include my
disallowance of this claim. As a matter of caution I will also deal with it.
The expenses were:

a |  Eldest child’s tuition for February, March,  
April 2004 |  $3,300.00  
---|---|---  
b |  SP Services utilities bill dated 31 April  
2004, leakage at underground service  
pipe |  $1,434.25  
c |  Replacement of one set National  
air-conditioner on 9 August 2003 |  $1,550.00  
d |  Repair toilet cistern on 17 September  
2002 |  $65.00  
e |  Tan Tock Seng Hospital A&E and X-ray  
on 8 December 2002 |  $70.00  
f |  Supply and installation of fabric and  
canopy on 7 October 2001 |  $2,000.00  
g |  Painting works on house (after 13 years)  
on 3 October 2001 |  $4,300.00  
h |  Repair and replacement of kitchen cabinet  
door/table top on 17 September 2001 |  $ 1,170.00  
i |  Singapore Cable Vision Ltd installation of  
cable in 1999 |  $2,351.00  
j |  SP Services |  $865.82  
|  **Total:** |  **$17,106.07**  
  
63 The Husband’s responses to the claim for reimbursement were as follows:

a. I reiterate paragraph 11 of my affidavit herein. I only agreed to my eldest
son taking an intensive revision course or he should approach his teachers if
he does not understand his subject;

b. The high amount was due to water leakage caused by a non-functioning solar
water heater. This was installed by the Petitioner’s sister who had failed to
maintain it. I had raised objection to the Petitioner’s sister installing it
on the roof because of the risks of water leaking and damaging the roof.
Nevertheless, I have paid the costs of $300.00 to repair the leakage apart
from the monthly utilities bill I have to pay for the Petitioner’s sister;

c. Replacement of the air-con in the dining room was done without my
knowledge. The place is also where the Petitioner’s sister’s friends and
relatives congregate. It was installed mainly for the Petitioner’s sister’s
benefit. It is airy if all sliding doors are open and I have purchased a fan
to circulate the air in the room.

d. The Petitioner’s sister should pay this repair of the toilet cistern cost
as I had paid for many other repairs;

e. The Petitioner has been paying her own medical expenses and should continue
to pay herself;

f. Replacement of the canopy was done without my agreement or knowledge. The
idea and decision to put up the original canopy were made by the Petitioner’s
sister whom [_sic_] had paid for it;

g. House painting was done without my agreement. I have told the Petitioner’s
sister I would do touch-up on the house which I have done before;

h. Repair and replacement of kitchen furniture and fittings were done without
my knowledge and agreement;

i. The installation of the SCV was done for the benefit of the Petitioner’s
sister who is the only one who has the facility to watch cable TV channels in
her room. I had specifically objected to its installation because there were
more than enough normal TV channels to watch and

j. Again, the unusually high [bill] was due to water caused by a non-
functioning solar water heater that was installed by the Petitioner’s sister
who failed to maintain it. I had raised objection to her installing it on the
roof [because] of the risks involved. Nevertheless, I have paid the
Petitioner’s sister the monthly utilities bill.

64 I accepted the Husband’s explanation but had some doubt for item (a) which
was tuition for the eldest child. As mentioned above, I was of the view that
his obligation to maintain the children should include their tuition fees, if
reasonably incurred. Nevertheless, this item had not been claimed under
maintenance and it also seemed to me that the Wife had accepted that the
Husband was not paying for these three months as there was no elaboration from
her as to why she was not claiming future tuition fees for the eldest child in
2004. In the circumstances, I disallowed her entire claim for reimbursement
and did not make any order for the Husband to pay the same.

65 I should add that I did prepare a draft oral judgment which I read to
counsel. The draft was a summary of the orders I intended to make and of the
reasons. I also took the liberty of giving counsel a copy thereof for their
consideration. This was so that they could point out any obvious or
inadvertent error I might have made. Having received their subsequent
responses orally, for which I am grateful, I finalised the draft judgment
which I have referred to herein as my oral judgment.
