Choo Han Teck J:

1 This was an application by the applicant to reserve questions of law to the
Court of Appeal. It arose from an appeal by the applicant in respect of his
conviction on two charges under the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap 268,
1985 Rev Ed). One charge was preferred under s 13E(5)(a) for refusing to
provide a blood sample. The other was under s 13(2)(a) to have his finger
impressions and photograph taken. I allowed the appeal in respect of the first
and dismissed the other. The facts and my grounds of decision of those appeals
are set out in _Mah Kiat Seng v Public Prosecutor_ [2010] SGHC 320.

2 The relevant facts of this application concerned his refusal to give his
finger impressions to the police after he was arrested on suspicion of having
committed an offence of causing grievous hurt. He was not subsequently charged
for the offence under investigation but was charged for the offences under the
Registration of Criminals Act (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed) when he declined to
comply with the requests by the police. So far as the charge relating to the
refusal to provide his blood sample was concerned, I allowed the appeal when
the Public Prosecutor conceded that the express procedure was not followed in
that the applicant was not produced before a Magistrate for a determination
that the blood sample would be necessary.

3 In respect of the second charge, the only relevant point of law here and in
the appeal previously, was whether the applicant was obliged in law to have
his finger impressions and photograph taken.

4 In this application the applicant recited 22 questions of law for reference
to the Court of Appeal under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap
322, 2007 Rev Ed). In this regard, the questions were rambling, repetitious
and many concerned not questions of law but fact. Since the applicant is now,
as was in the appeal hearing, unrepresented by counsel, it would be helpful to
summarise the nature of his complaint. There were two aspects. The first was
factual – whether the police had made the request for him to provide his
finger impressions and photograph. The trial judge found that they had. The
appellant was dissatisfied with the trial judge’s decision and on it, he (the
appellant) enunciated a long list of questions which he claims to be questions
of law of public interest.

5 Although s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev
Ed) admits of more than one question of law to be reserved for the
determination of the Court of Appeal (by reason of the rule of interpretation
that the singular includes the plural), it must be applied with care and as
far as possible, the question of law must be expressed as a single question
without also setting out ancillary and underlying questions that might be
asked in the course of answering the question so reserved. The real question
of law was whether the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed)
applied to compel a suspect as opposed to a convicted criminal. This was the
issue in the appeal and I was of the view that it did. Section 8(a) of the Act
is unequivocal and provides as follows

8Any authorised officer may —

(a)take or cause to be taken the finger impressions and photographs of any
person under arrest who is accused of any crime; …

The section making an offence of any refusal to comply with a request under s
8 is also unequivocal –

13(2)Where a person to whom subsection (1) applies refuses, without reasonable
excuse, to submit to the taking of his photograph or finger impressions or to
provide any registrable particulars or other particulars when lawfully
required by an authorised officer or by an officer in charge of a prison —

(a)that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction
to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
month or to both; …

6 “Any person under arrest” would include a suspect who had been arrested.
There is no question therefore to say that ss 8 and 13 do not apply to a
suspect. Accordingly, there was no basis to reserve the questions to the Court
of Appeal for its determination. The application was thus dismissed.
