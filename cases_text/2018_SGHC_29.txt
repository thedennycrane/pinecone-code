George Wei J

George Wei J:

Introduction

1 This is an application for summary judgment under O 14 r 1 of the Rules of
Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). The plaintiffs brought claims
against the 1st defendant for breach of contract and fraudulent
misrepresentation, and against the 2nd defendant under a personal guarantee.
The plaintiffs paid about $6m in total to purchase the 1st defendant’s
receivables on an online platform run by the 1st plaintiff, 1

and later found out that the invoices had been fabricated. 2

##### Foot Note 2

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 48–51.

The defendants have failed to make payment or repurchase the traded debts. In
their defence, they mainly contend that the entire arrangement was in
substance an illegal moneylending transaction. The defendants do not deny
receipt of the monies. 3

##### Foot Note 3

Plaintiffs’ submissions, para 37 and Defence, para 28.

2 Having heard the parties, I find that the plaintiffs have succeeded in
proving a prima facie case and that the defendants have not shown a fair or
reasonable probability that they have a bona fide defence. Accordingly, I
grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs.

Background

The parties

3 The 1st plaintiff, Capital Springboard Ltd, is an Irish company which owns
and operates an online peer-to-peer invoice financing platform (“the CS
Platform”) where small and medium-sized enterprises can sell their receivables
to investors. 4

##### Foot Note 4

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 5 and 10.

4 The 2nd plaintiff, Capital Springboard (Singapore) Pte Ltd, is a local
company which acts as the collection and administrative agent for investors on
the CS Platform. 5

##### Foot Note 5

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 6 and 12.

5 The 1st defendant, Vangard Project Management Pte Ltd, is a local company in
the business of providing renovation and interior design services.

6 The 2nd defendant, Choy Peiyi, is the sole director and shareholder of the
1st defendant. 6

##### Foot Note 6

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, para 9 and KCW-2.

She obtained a diploma from the Palin School of Arts and Design in Singapore
and thereafter decided to set up her own interior design and renovation
business, Vangard Project & Design Pte Ltd (“VPD”), in 2012. 7

##### Foot Note 7

Choy Peiyi’s affidavit (“Choy’s affidavit”), para 18.

She was a director of VPD until she had to step down because of criminal
proceedings which had been brought against her (see [29] below). 8

At the material time, the 2nd defendant was also a director and shareholder of
another interior design company, Project Creative Pte Ltd (“PCPL”). 9

Dealings between the parties

8 Around August 2014, the 2nd defendant saw a marketing e-mail blast from a
company named Finaqe Group Pte Ltd (“Finaqe”) promoting its services of
providing working capital to companies. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

Choy’s affidavit, para 19.

The 2nd defendant, who was still a director of VPD at the time, was interested
in getting a term loan for VPD and reached out to Lee Jun Xiao (“Lee”), the
Finaqe broker and contact person named in the marketing e-mail. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

Defence, para 7(a); Choy’s affidavit, paras 19–20.

9 In late October 2014, Lee e-mailed the 2nd defendant requesting documents to
assess VPD’s eligibility for a term loan. It turned out that VPD did not
qualify for a term loan. The 2nd defendant then enquired with Lee about other
available options. According to the 2nd defendant, Lee told her that Finaqe
had a new contact, Centurion Group (“Centurion”) which could offer an
alternative form of financing, and set up a meeting between Centurion and the
2nd defendant on 19 December 2014. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

Choy’s affidavit, paras 20–22.

10 The meeting on 19 December 2014 was attended by the 2nd defendant, Lee and
Centurion’s Business Development Director, Ginnie Chin Lee Jin (“Chin”). At
the meeting, the 2nd defendant entered into written receivables purchase
agreements on behalf of VPD and PCPL, with ARC Trade Finance Fund (“ARC”)
which was owned by Centurion. I will refer to these agreements as the “VPD
RPA” and the “PCPL RPA”. These agreements governed the sale of receivables by
VPD and PCPL to ARC, and both are titled “Receivables Purchase Agreement”. ARC
was the “Financing Entity” and the sellers were both corporate entities.

11 There is some dispute between the parties about whether Chin orally
explained to the 2nd defendant at the meeting how the VPD RPA would work, and
that it was an agreement for the sale and purchase of receivables. According
to the 2nd defendant, Chin only explained how Centurion would offer VPD
business financing if VPD provided its customers’ invoices to Centurion. The
2nd defendant also averred that her understanding of the process was that she
would be given money upon providing her customers’ invoices to Centurion, and
then required to repay Centurion with a larger amount of money at a later
date. 14

##### Foot Note 14

×

Choy’s affidavit, paras 23–24.

12 On the other hand, Chin avers that she explained to the 2nd defendant that
VPD was ARC’s collecting agent for the sale and purchase of receivables, and
that VPD was obliged to provide ARC with an undated notice of assignment as
VPD would be selling receivables to ARC without disclosing the sale and
assignment of the receivables to its debtors (ie, on an undisclosed basis).
Chin maintains, contrary to the 2nd defendant’s averments, that she never told
the 2nd defendant that the notice of assignment was to secure the 2nd
defendant’s borrowing, or that VPD’s debtors would not be contacted as long as
the 1st defendant repaid the borrowed monies. 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, paras 18–19.

I note that the terms of the written VPD RPA and PCPL RPA do not suggest that
they were in substance loan agreements. 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

See Chin’s 1st affidavit, para 22 and CLJ-2.

13 I pause to note that the 2nd defendant’s position is that she did not
understand what or how the VPD RPA and PCPL RPA worked and that she thought
the sums were simply loans. To this end, she asserts that she is not familiar
or versed in financing and that she did not know how to obtain credit
facilities. 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

Choy’s affidavit, para 18.

Nevertheless, it is not disputed that between 2014 and 2016, she submitted
some 174 invoices pursuant to the financing arrangement. She avers that these
monies were borrowed for the purpose of developing her interior design
business. The total sum received by the 2nd defendant/VPD was about $18.3m. A
total sum of $19.5m was paid back under the arrangement. The 2nd defendant’s
position is that interest of $1.5m was paid in respect of the monies advanced
on these 174 invoices. 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

Choy’s affidavit at para 33.

14 The 2nd defendant’s assertion that she was naïve and unsophisticated sits
rather uneasily with the number of invoices against which she was able to
raise $18.3m. Whilst these 174 invoices are not the subject matter of the
present dispute, the 2nd defendant submitted that a trial was warranted so
that the nature of these 174 invoices could be explored. The point raised was
that an examination of the circumstances relating to the 174 invoices together
with the 60 invoices in dispute in the present case (see [25] below) would
support her case that the transactions were in fact money-lending. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

Choy’s affidavit at paras 44 and 48–49.

In other words, the disputed 60 invoices and “traded debts” were said to be
part of a history of lending that dated back to the 174 invoices.

15 The fact however is that the 2nd defendant does not assert that the 174
invoices were fake or fabricated. To be clear, she appears to advance the
argument that the $18.3m was in fact loans secured by the invoices, and that
these loans were paid off together with interest of $1.5m. That said, the
terms of the written VPD RPA and PCPL RPA are entirely consistent with the
plaintiffs’ position that they were in fact receivables purchase agreements. I
note also that the VPD RPA and PCPL RPA agreements are not the subject matter
of this suit and involve different parties.

16 In any event, around late January 2015, the 2nd defendant contacted Chin
and requested that the VPD RPA and the PCPL RPA be transferred to her sole
proprietorship, Vangard Project (“VP”).

17 I pause here to note that Chin asserts that the 2nd defendant informed her
that VP had been set up because the 2nd defendant did not wish to continue
working with her business partner in VPD and/or PCPL. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, para 25.

An enhanced credit bureau search was conducted. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, CLJ-3.

Chin was informed that VPD and PCPL’s business would be diverted to VP. The
2nd defendant’s affidavit does not refer to or give any explanation as to why
VP was established or why she did not wish to continue with her business
partner. Indeed, this is a matter on which nothing at all is said by the
defendants. Their amended defence simply states that in or around August 2014,
the 2nd defendant was director of the now defunct VPD 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

Defence, para 7(b).

and that on 22 January 2015, a new agreement was discussed and executed with
the 2nd defendant’s newly set-up sole proprietorship, VP. 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

Defence, para 7(f).

18 In any case, it is clear that on 22 January 2015, ARC and VP entered into a
“written receivables purchase agreement.” 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, para 27 and CLJ-4.

19 Around April and May 2016, the 2nd plaintiff took over as the paying and
collecting agent for transactions under ARC’s receivables purchase agreements.
Sellers of receivables were informed through brokers such as Lee that ARC
would be migrating its receivables purchase agreements to the CS Platform run
by the 1st plaintiff. Another change was that sole proprietorships such as VP
would not be permitted to list and sell receivables on the CS Platform.
However, in the event that the owner of a sole proprietorship were to
incorporate a company to carry on the same business as the sole
proprietorship, the 1st plaintiff would allow the said company to list and
sell receivables on the CS Platform. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, para 34.

20 The 1st defendant was then incorporated on 10 May 2016. It is disputed as
to whether Chin had specifically requested that the 2nd defendant incorporate
a company so that the 2nd plaintiff could continue providing financing to VP.
26

##### Foot Note 26

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, paras 35–40.

In any event, on 18 May 2016 prior to the CS Platform going live, the 1st
defendant entered into a written receivables purchase agreement with ARC (“the
VPM RPA”).

21 On 16 June 2016, Chin informed the 2nd defendant by e-mail that all
directors of member companies were required to provide the 2nd plaintiff with
a guarantee in the form of a deed poll of guarantee and indemnity (“the
Guarantee”). Chin’s e-mail reiterated that the arrangement to sell the
receivables was on an undisclosed or “non-notified basis” (see [12] above). 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

Chin’s 2nd affidavit, para 46 and CLJ-6.

Chin sent the 2nd defendant a follow-up e-mail on 29 June 2016 reminding her
to sign the Guarantee by 8 July 2016. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, paras 46–48.

22 On 1 July 2016, the 2nd plaintiff sent an e-mail to the 2nd defendant
containing a hyperlink to view and sign a number of relevant documents for the
CS Platform, namely the membership application form, the terms and conditions
(“CS T&Cs”), the members’ guide (which was known as the Member Guidance), the
fee schedule and the privacy notice. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, paras 49 and 54 and CLJ-8.

These documents constituted the membership agreement, which I will refer to as
the “CS Membership Agreement”.

23 The 2nd defendant signed the Guarantee on 4 July 2016, guaranteeing payment
for the 1st defendant’s repurchase obligations under the CS T&Cs. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, para 15 and KCW-2.

Following that, on 13 October 2016, she filled up the online membership
application form acknowledging that she had, on behalf of the 1st defendant,
read and accepted the documents mentioned at [22] above which had been
incorporated into the membership application form. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, para 54 and CLJ-8.

She signed the form electronically in her capacity as the director of the 1st
defendant. 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

Chin’s 1st affidavit, para 55–56.

The 1st defendant thereby became a member of the CS Platform.

24 Under the CS T&Cs, each sale and purchase took effect as an unconditional
sale and purchase of the entire legal and beneficial interest in the said
receivable, and the seller agreed to assign the receivable to the investor
with full title guarantee. The 2nd plaintiff was appointed by the respective
investors as the collection and administrative agent to handle matters
relating to the receivable in question. If the 2nd plaintiff so required, the
seller would perfect the assignment of the receivables to the investors by
giving notice to the customers to pay the receivables to the 2nd plaintiff.
The seller was obliged to act as the investors’ agent to collect payment of
the receivables from the customers, and then hold such payment on trust for
the investors and remit it to the 2nd plaintiff. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, para 20.

A notice of repayment would be issued to the seller, setting out the invoice
details and terms upon which the receivable was purchased. Sellers were
required to provide the 2nd plaintiff with a notice of assignment for each
assignment of a receivable. 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 23 – 24.

25 The 1st defendant subsequently listed 60 receivables (“the Traded Debts”)
on the CS Platform for sale to investors. The Traded Debts were in respect of
60 tax invoices issued by the 1st defendant to six of its customers (“the
Customers”), and were purchased by investors (including the 3rd to 46th
plaintiffs) by way of a bidding process. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 16–19.

The consideration for the sale of each receivable was 80% of the invoice
amount, less an origination fee. 36

##### Foot Note 36

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, para 22.

The total advance sum paid by the investors in respect of the 60 Traded Debts
was $6,885,840. 37

##### Foot Note 37

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, para 26.

The plaintiffs own a 99.312% share of this sum, which amounts to
$6,783,433.86. 38

##### Foot Note 38

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 27–28 and KCW-5.

26 The respective payment dates for all 60 Traded Debts have expired. The
Traded Debts were not paid by the 1st defendant as required under the CS T&Cs,
and thus became “disputed debts” within the meaning of cl 17.1 of the CS T&Cs.
The 1st defendant was required under the CS T&Cs to pay the repurchase price
and a repurchase fee. The 2nd plaintiff thus issued repurchase demands dated
29 March, 30 March and 7 August 2017 to the 1st defendant in respect of the 60
Traded Debts, requiring the 1st defendant to repurchase them and to pay the
stated repurchase price. The 1st defendant has not done so. 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 29–34 and KCW-6.

27 On 30 March 2017, the plaintiffs’ solicitors issued letters to the
Customers giving notice of assignment of the Traded Debts, enclosing copies of
the notice of assignment and other relevant documents, and demanding payment
of the Traded Debts. One of the Customers, Evershine Services Pte Ltd
(“Evershine”), responded by e-mail on 30 March 2017 stating that it had never
heard of the 1st defendant and had no dealings with it. The 2nd plaintiff then
got in touch with four out of five of the other Customers by telephone and was
informed by them that they did not have any dealings with the 1st defendant
either. 40

##### Foot Note 40

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 48–49 and KCW-10.

Fish & Co Restaurants Pte Ltd (“Fish & Co”), who was one of the four Customers
whom the 2nd plaintiff had contacted by telephone, followed up by e-mail on 5
April 2017 stating that it had looked at the purchase orders attached to the
notice of assignment of receivables, and concluded that they were falsified
documents with fake and duplicated signatures. 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, para 51 and KCW-10.

28 The plaintiffs’ position is that the invoices in respect of Evershine and
Fish & Co were fabricated. 42

##### Foot Note 42

Statement of claim, para 38.

The plaintiffs further plead that they have reason to believe that all the
underlying tax invoices for the remaining Traded Debts were similarly
fabricated. 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

Statement of claim, para 39.

The defendants’ pleaded case in this respect is that the allegations are not
admitted and that the plaintiffs are put to strict proof. 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

Defence, para 29.

This is a point that I return to below.

29 The 2nd plaintiff filed a police report against the defendants on 2 April
2017. On 6 and 12 April 2017, the 2nd defendant was charged with 60 counts of
cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) in respect of the 60 Traded
Debts. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 56–59.

These criminal proceedings against the 2nd defendant are currently ongoing.

30 The plaintiffs’ solicitors made demands on 6 and 12 May 2017 for the 2nd
defendant to pay the repurchase prices to the 2nd plaintiff in respect of the
60 Traded Debts as required under the Guarantee, but the 2nd defendant did not
do so. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, paras 38–39.

31 The aggregate sum of the repurchase prices for all 60 Traded Debts was
$8,523,456.84 as of 16 August 2017. The plaintiffs’ 99.312% share of this sum
totals $8,464,740.92. 47

The present action

32 On 20 June 2017, the plaintiffs commenced the present suit against the
defendants. As set out in the amended statement of claim dated 16 August 2017:

(a) The plaintiffs claim the sum of $8,464,740.92 against the defendants,
being the plaintiffs’ share of the repurchase prices and repurchase fees in
respect of the 60 Traded Debts, and which continues to accrue until the date
of judgment. 48

Amended statement of claim, pp 23–25.

(b) Alternatively, the plaintiffs seek remedies for the 1st defendant’s
fraudulent misrepresentation such as rescission, a declaration that the paid
sums are held on trust for the plaintiffs, the lifting of the 1st defendant’s
corporate veil, and/or an order that the defendants return the sum of
$6,783,433.86 (see [25] above) to the plaintiffs. 49

##### Foot Note 49

Amended statement of claim, p 25.

33 On 13 September 2017, the plaintiffs applied for summary judgment under O
14 r 1 of the ROC.

The law on summary judgment

34 The legal principles on summary judgment under O 14 of the ROC are well-
known. In order to obtain judgment, a plaintiff must first show that he has a
prima facie case for summary judgment. If the plaintiff satisfies this, the
burden then shifts to the defendant to show that there is an issue or question
in dispute which ought to be tried (O 14 r 3(1) of the ROC; M2B World Asia
Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko [2015] 1 SLR 325 (“M2B”) at [17]). If the
defendant can establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he
has a bona fide defence, he ought to have leave to defend (Habibullah Mohamed
Yousuff v Indian Bank [1999] 2 SLR(R) 880 at [21]).

35 Singapore Civil Procedure 2018 vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &
Maxwell, 2018) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”) at para 79/1/8 states that if the
defence set up is that the plaintiff is an unlicensed moneylender and a prima
facie case to that effect exists, unconditional leave to defend the action
must be given. Singapore Civil Procedure goes on to state that “[w]here only
bare allegations of unauthorised moneylending are asserted to resist an
application for summary judgment for a loan the borrower may be given only
conditional leave to defend”.

36 The court will not grant leave “if all the defendant provides is a mere
assertion, contained in an affidavit, of a given situation which forms the
basis of his defence”, or if the assertions in affidavit are equivocal,
lacking in precision, inconsistent or inherently improbable (M2B at [19]). The
proper course is not for the court to assume that every sworn averment is to
be accepted as true, or that such an averment may, ipso facto, provide a basis
for leave to defend (Abdul Salam Asanaru Pillai (trading as South Kerala
Cashew Exporters) v Nomanbhoy & Sons Pte Ltd [2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 at [38]; Goh
Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan [2003] 3 SLR(R) 32 at [25]).

37 Apart from showing the existence of triable issues, the defendant may also
avoid summary judgment by showing “that there ought for some other reason to
be a trial” (O 14 r 3(1) of the ROC).

The parties’ cases

38 The plaintiffs submit that there is a prima facie case for judgment on
their contractual claim for their share of the aggregate repurchase price in
respect of the 60 Traded Debts. 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

Plaintiffs’ submissions, paras 51–52.

Against the 1st defendant, the plaintiffs’ case is that the relevant terms of
the CS Membership Agreement, as contained in the key documents such as the CS
T&Cs, make clear that the 60 Traded Debts had to be paid by the 1st defendant
within 14 days of their respective payment dates. As the 1st defendant did not
do so, the 60 Traded Debts became “disputed debts” within the meaning of the
CS T&Cs. The plaintiffs submit that the 1st defendant’s failure to pay the
repurchase prices for the 60 Traded Debts amounts to a breach of the CS
Membership Agreement. 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

Plaintiffs’ submissions, paras 29 and 39–44.

Further, they contend that the 2nd defendant has breached her express
obligations under the terms of the Guarantee by failing to repay the purchase
prices owed by the 1st defendant. 53

##### Foot Note 53

×

Plaintiffs’ submissions, paras 48–50.

39 In support of their alternative claims, the plaintiffs submit that the
essential elements of fraudulent misrepresentation or the tort of deceit have
been met. The plaintiffs contend that the 1st defendant had knowingly made
false representations, warranties and undertakings when listing the 60
fabricated receivables on the CS Platform, with the intention that the
investor plaintiffs would rely on such representations and purchase them to
their detriment. 54

##### Foot Note 54

×

Plaintiffs’ submissions, paras 241–261.

The plaintiffs also argue that the separate legal personality of the 1st
defendant had been abused by the 2nd defendant to commit fraud or deceit
against the plaintiffs, thus the corporate veil should be lifted and the 2nd
defendant should be held personally liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.

40 The defendants submit that the present application should be dismissed as
they have a bona fide defence and there are triable issues. The “main plank”
and “crux” of their defence is the illegal moneylending defence. 56

##### Foot Note 56

Defendants’ submissions, paras 6, 11 and 32.

The defendants argue that the “sale of receivables” on the CS Platform in
substance amounted to moneylending transactions, as they were advancements of
monies in consideration of a larger sum being repaid. They contend that the
plaintiffs are unlicensed moneylenders within the meaning of the Moneylenders
Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed), thus the contract between the parties in respect
of the 60 Traded Debts is unenforceable and the monies paid by the plaintiffs
are not recoverable (see s 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act).

41 The defendants further allude to several other defences in their pleadings,
although these were not argued before me during the course of the hearing or
in written submissions. These other defences are as follows:

(a) There is no basis to lift the corporate veil of the 1st defendant, as the
1st defendant was purportedly incorporated at Chin’s behest. 57

##### Foot Note 57

(b) There were no contractual relations between the parties as the defendants

Further, the plaintiffs’ solicitors have refused to provide copies of the

which may not even be real. 59

In particular regard to the illegal moneylending defence, the plaintiffs

defendants’ case that the express terms of the VPM RPA and the documents
incorporated into the CS Membership Agreement do not represent what was agreed
upon between the parties. The plaintiffs accordingly take the position that
the Moneylenders Act does not apply to the present case. 64

Whether the plaintiffs have a prima facie case for summary judgment

The primary claims under the CS Membership Agreement and the Guarantee

43 I begin with the question of whether the plaintiffs have a prima facie case
for summary judgment. I find it clear on the basis of the relevant documents
constituting the CS Membership Agreement that a prima facie case on the
plaintiffs’ contractual claims has been made out.

44 The CS T&Cs is the document that sets out the terms and conditions
governing the sale and purchase of receivables on the CS Platform. I set out
the relevant clauses here: 65

##### Foot Note 65

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, KCW-2.

2.6 True sale: Each Trade will take effect as an unconditional sale of the
entire legal and beneficial interest in the Traded Debt to the Purchasing
Investor… with us [ie, the 1st plaintiff] acting as the purchasing agent and
CSSG [ie, the 2nd plaintiff] as collection and administrative agent for the
Purchasing Investors. The Seller and Investors confirm the intention of any
Trade is that it shall constitute a true sale of the Traded Debt and not a
security arrangement for any obligations of the Seller.

2.7 Investors as Owners: Upon each Trade, the successful Investor(s) will hold
all rights under the Trade, including the Traded Debt, as legal and beneficial
owner(s) and CSSG is irrevocably appointed by the Purchasing Investors as
collection and administrative agent to handle matters relating to the Trade
and the Traded Debt for the owner(s)...

2.8 Assignment: As Seller you agree to assign to the Purchasing Investors,
with CSSG as agent for the Purchasing Investors, your future Traded Debts with
full title guarantee.

…

2.10 Perfection of assignment: If CSSG requires, as Seller you will promptly
and at your expense:

(1) execute, stamp and deliver to us a formal written assignment of any Traded
Debt, in the form that CSSG may require, including any assignment in CSSG’s
name as agent for named Purchasing Investors or undisclosed Purchasing
Investors;

(2) take any other action necessary to perfect the assignment to the
Purchasing Investors of, or the Purchasing Investors’ title to, or the trust
in their favour in relation to, any Traded Debt and the Proceeds of the same;
and/or

(3) give notice to Customers to pay any Traded Debt, any Non-Traded Debt that
cannot be separated from Traded Debt and the Proceeds of the same to the
Escrow Agent via the Escrow Account, or to CSSG as agent for the Purchasing
Investors.

5.4 Overdue interest: Overdue interest on any outstanding amount owing by the
Seller to the Purchasing Investor, or to us or to a service provider, shall be
charged from the 15th days after the due date of such amount up to the
Seller’s actual payment date, both days inclusive, at the Default Rate. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Discounting Charge will continue to accrue at the
Discount Rate for the 14 days after the Expected Payment Date and if unpaid
shall itself be subject to overdue interest as aforesaid.

…

6.2 Agency for collection: Upon the sale of any Debt, as Seller you will
automatically be appointed as CSSG’s sub-agent for the purpose of
administering, collecting and enforcing the Traded Debt for the Investors and
at your own expense…

6.3 Trust of Proceeds: Whether or not as Seller you remain as collection
agent, if at any time you receive or recover any Proceeds in respect of a
Traded Debt, you…

(3) will hold the Proceeds on trust for the Investors pending receipt of it by
CSSG as agent for the Investors or payment into the Escrow Account. This trust
will terminate, in relation to any Proceeds, as soon as CSSG receive the same
on behalf of the Investors or if the Proceeds are paid into the Escrow
Account.

…

10\. REPURCHASE OF DEBTS

10.1 Repurchase: We or CSSG may (but are not obliged to) require a Seller to
repurchase a Traded Debt upon or at any time after the occurrence of a
Termination Event other than the Customer’s Insolvency, or CSSG has grounds to
believe that the Debt is or has become or is likely to become a Disputed Debt.
The Seller must then pay the Repurchase Price and the Repurchase Fee as
directed by CSSG.

10.2 Repurchase Price: The Repurchase Price, in respect of any day on which a
Traded Debt is outstanding, will be calculated in accordance with the formula:

[DF + DC + A + RF] – C - E; where

DF is the Discount Fee

DC is the outstanding Discounting Charge on such day

A is the Advance

RF is the Repurchase Fee

C is any sum actually received in cleared funds and applied by us in or
towards the discharge, in whole or in part, of the Traded Debt

E is the Early Payment Incentive on such day.

For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that the Repurchase Price
is a net repurchase price after netting off the balance of the Purchase Price
for that Traded Debt and hence the balance Purchase Price for a Traded Debt
shall be treated as paid via netting off upon the Seller being required to
repurchase a Traded Debt.

45 In summary, the CS T&Cs make clear that the entire legal and beneficial
interest in the Traded Debts passed to the investors upon sale. The 1st
defendant was responsible for collecting and enforcing payment of the Traded
Debts by the Customers, so that the investors could be paid. The 1st and 2nd
plaintiffs may require the 1st defendant to repurchase the Traded Debts on the
basis that they have become “Disputed Debts” within the meaning of cl 17.1,
which provides:

“Disputed Debt” means a Debt (a) payable by a Customer who the Seller knows or
ought to know is disputing or is likely to dispute its liability to pay the
Debt in full or to pay the Debt by the Expected Payment Date, (b) is not paid
within 14 days after the Expected Payment Date except when such non payment is
due to the insolvent winding-up or bankruptcy of the Customer, or (c) which
will be reduced to be less than its Face Value without the Purchasing
Investors’ consent

46 As the Traded Debts were disputed by the Customers and not paid within 14
days of the Expected Payment Dates, they became “Disputed Debts”, such that
the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs were entitled to require the 1st defendant to
repurchase them. Although the defendants dispute their liability for the
repurchase price generally, they do not contend that the calculations done at
[31] by the plaintiffs in accordance with the formula in cl 10.2 are
inaccurate.

47 On the basis of the express terms in the CS T&Cs that govern the
contractual relationship between the parties, it is clear to me that the
plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case for judgment against the 1st
defendant on the contractual claim.

48 As for the 2nd defendant, she had “irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantee[d]” by way of the Guarantee to pay on demand “all present and future
payment obligations and liabilities” of the 1st defendant incurred under the
CS T&Cs “arising out of any obligation to repurchase any present or future
Traded Debt”. She had also “irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee[d] the
due and punctual performance and observance by the [1st defendant] of its
repurchase obligations under the CS T&Cs” to the 2nd plaintiff and each
investor. 66

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, KCW-2, pp 84 and 86.

Barring any bona fide defence, there is no question that this would cover the
repurchase obligations owed by the 1st defendant in respect of the 60 Traded
Debts. As such, I find that the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case
for judgment against the 2nd defendant as well.

The alternative claims in fraudulent misrepresentation

49 Having found that that the plaintiffs have a prima facie case against the
defendants for summary judgment, there is strictly no need for me to consider
the plaintiffs’ alternative claims in fraudulent misrepresentation or the tort
of deceit, and its arguments for lifting the 1st defendant’s corporate veil. I
note that the defences raised by the defendants which apply to the primary
claims all apply in equal measure to the alternative claims. 67

##### Foot Note 67

×

See Defendants’ submissions, para 55.

I note as well that the sum claimed under the alternative claims (ie,
$6,783,433.86, being the plaintiffs’ share of the advance sum paid for the
Traded Debts) is lower than the sum claimed under the primary claims (ie,
$8,464,740.92 and upwards, being the plaintiffs’ share of the aggregate
repurchase price payable by the defendants which will continue to accrue until
the date of the judgment). That said, I nonetheless state that I also find
that the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case in respect of the
alternative claims. I will be brief in my reasons on this issue.

Fraudulent misrepresentation

50 In Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another [2001] 2 SLR(R)
435 at [14], the Court of Appeal summarised the elements of the tort of deceit
as follows:

… First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct.
Second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be
acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the
plaintiff. Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the
false statement. Fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage
by so doing. Fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is
false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any
genuine belief that it is true.

51 The defendants’ position on whether the 60 invoices are fabricated is odd
to say the least. They do not affirmatively plead that the 60 invoices are
genuine. Then again, they do not admit that the invoices were in fact
fabricated. Instead, as noted at [28] above, what is pleaded is merely that
the allegations are not admitted, and the plaintiffs are put to strict proof.
The responses in evidence of Evershine and Fish & Co however make clear that
the invoices in their names were fabricated or false. Indeed, the 2nd
defendant is now facing 60 charges of cheating under the Penal Code in respect
of the 60 trades. Whilst this court is aware that the 2nd defendant has not
been convicted of any of the charges, the equivocal pleadings of the
defendants as to whether the 60 invoices are genuine or false or fabricated is
disturbing. These invoices are from the 1st defendant which operates under the
control of the 2nd defendant.

52 The inescapable conclusion is that these invoices were fabricated by the
1st defendant and listed on the CS Platform so that they would be purchased by
investors. In so doing, the 1st defendant made a wilfully false representation
with the intention that it be acted upon by the plaintiffs and other
investors. The plaintiffs who purchased the Traded Debts acted upon this false
representation to their detriment. This satisfies all elements of the tort and
establishes a prima facie claim for the return of the plaintiffs’ share of the
advance sum paid to the 1st defendant in respect of the 60 Traded Debts.

53 I briefly remark that if the 60 invoices are in fact genuine trade
receivables as the plaintiffs have been led to believe, then as I will discuss
below, there would be no viable defence of moneylending. On the other hand, if
the 60 invoices are fake or fabricated, this would not affect the plaintiffs’
position as purchasers of the Traded Debts, unless the VPM RPA was a sham and
the plaintiffs, in particular the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs, were aware of and a
party to an elaborate sham. There is nothing however that supports or tends to
that conclusion. I will turn to this point again later.

Lifting of the corporate veil

54 I also consider it appropriate for the 1st defendant’s corporate veil to be
lifted, such that the 2nd defendant should be held personally liable in
fraudulent misrepresentation. There appears to be no question that the 2nd
defendant, the sole director and shareholder of the 1st defendant, was the one
who had submitted the fabricated documents (the 60 invoices) and perpetrated
the entire fraudulent scheme. The parties do not dispute that the very purpose
of incorporating the 1st defendant was so that VP could list its receivables
on the CS Platform (see [19] above), regardless of whether the incorporation
of the 1st defendant had in fact been pursuant to suggestions made by Chin or
anyone else.

55 In these circumstances, there is at least a prima facie case for the
corporate veil to be pierced so as to prevent the abuse of corporate
personality by the 2nd defendant as the 1st defendant’s true controller, and
so that the court will not lend its aid to a fraudulent scheme (see Dynasty
Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sia Sukamto and another [2013] 4 SLR 253 at [103],
citing Walter Woon on Company Law (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell,
2009) at paras 2.50–2.51).

56 Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, The Law of Torts in Singapore (Academy
Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at pp 772– 775 sets out a helpful summary of the
situations whereby a director incurs personal liability for the tort of a
company. One situation is where the director authorised, directed or procured
the company’s tort (at para 18.044). This also applies here.

57 In any case, the liability of the 2nd defendant does not rest solely on her
liability as the sole director and shareholder and her role in the deceit. The
2nd defendant is in any case directly liable under the personal guarantee
which she had entered into.

Whether the illegal moneylending defence amounts to a bona fide defence

58 The burden now shifts to the defendants to show that they have a bona fide
defence in order to resist summary judgment. As the defendants put it, they
“rely on a singular defence to show cause why the Plaintiffs’ present
application should be dismissed, on the basis of the illegal moneylending
defence”. 68

##### Foot Note 68

×

Defendants’ submissions, para 55.

In essence, the defendants contend that the sale and purchase of the Traded
Debts constitute loans that are unenforceable under the Moneylenders Act,
while the plaintiffs deny this.

Relevant provisions in the Moneylenders Act

59 I begin with the relevant provisions in the Moneylenders Act. Section 5(1)
provides that:

(1) No person shall carry on or hold himself out in any way as carrying on the
business of moneylending in Singapore, whether as principal or as agent,
unless —

(a) he is authorised to do so by a licence;

(b) he is an excluded moneylender; or

(c) he is an exempt moneylender.

Section 2 in turn defines “excluded moneylender” to include, inter alia, any
person who lends money solely to corporations (s 2(e)(iii)(A)). The parties
are in agreement that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are not authorised by licence
to lend money, nor are they exempt moneylenders within the meaning of the
Moneylenders Act.

60 Section 3 sets out the presumption that “[a]ny person, other than an
excluded moneylender, who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger
sum being repaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a
moneylender.”

61 Section 14 on “Unlicensed moneylending” provides that the contravention of
s 5(1) is a criminal offence. Section 14(2) then reads:

(2) Where any contract for a loan has been granted by an unlicensed
moneylender, or any guarantee or security has been given for such a loan —

(a) the contract for the loan, and the guarantee or security, as the case may
be, shall be unenforceable; and

(b) any money paid by or on behalf of the unlicensed moneylender under the
contract for the loan shall not be recoverable in any court of law.

62 The Court of Appeal in Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong
Kong) Ltd [2014] 3 SLR 524 (“Sheagar”) at [75] summarised the principles to be
adopted in relation to s 14(2) as follows:

(a) To rely on s 14(2) of the MLA [ie, Moneylenders Act], the borrower must
prove that the lender was an "unlicensed moneylender";

(b) If the borrower can establish that the lender has lent money in
consideration for a higher sum being repaid, he may rely on the presumption
contained in s 3 of the MLA to discharge this burden;

(c) The burden then shifts to the lender to prove that he either does not
carry on the business of moneylending or possesses a moneylending licence or
is an "exempted moneylender";

(d) However, if there is an issue as to whether the lender is an excluded
moneylender, the legal burden of proving that he is not will fall on the
borrower.

It follows from the first principle in (a) that if the purported borrower
cannot prove that the purported lender was an “unlicensed moneylender”, s
14(2) is inapplicable.

Whether the sale and purchase of the Traded Debts amounts to moneylending

63 I agree with the plaintiffs that a sale and purchase of receivables is not
generally to be regarded as a loan transaction. The “purchase of debts … for
the purpose of providing finance, or relieving the seller from administrative
tasks or from bad debts or for any or all of such purposes” is also known as
“factoring” (Noel Ruddy, Simon Mills & Nigel Davidson, Salinger on Factoring
(Sweet & Maxwell, 4th ed, 2006) (“Salinger on Factoring” at para 1-04). While
the object and commercial purpose of a factoring facility may be similar to
that of a loan facility, it is not a loan facility at least in form (see SAL
Industrial Leasing Ltd v Hydtrolmech Automation Services Pte Ltd and others
[1997] 3 SLR(R) 676 at [53]).

The courts’ general approach

64 In City Hardware Pte Ltd v Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd [2005] 1 SLR(R) 733
(“City Hardware”) at [24]–[25], the learned V K Rajah J (as he then was)
articulated the courts’ general approach to determining whether a transaction
constitutes moneylending:

24 … What constitutes lending must of course remain a question of fact in
every case. Careful consideration has to be given to the form and substance of
the transaction as well as the parties’ position and relationship in the
context of the entire factual matrix. It is axiomatic that if there has been
no lending there can be no moneylending.

25 It ought to be stressed, however, that the court ought not to be
overzealous in analysing or deconstructing a transaction in order to infer
and/or conclude that the object of the transaction was to lend money…

65 Rajah J (at [25]) went on to cite and endorse Lord Devlin’s decision in
Chow Yoong Hong v Choong Fah Rubber Manufactory [1962] AC 209 at 216:

… There are many ways of raising cash besides borrowing. One is by selling
book-debts and another by selling unmatured bills, in each case for less than
their face value. Another might be to buy goods on credit or against a post-
dated cheque and immediately sell them in the market for cash. Their Lordships
are, of course, aware, as was Branson J., that transactions of this sort can
easily be used as a cloak for moneylending. The task of the court in such
cases is clear. It must first look at the nature of the transaction which the
parties have agreed. If in form it is not a loan, it is not to the point to
say that its object was to raise money for one of them or that the parties
could have produced the same result more conveniently by borrowing and lending
money. But if the court comes to the conclusion that the form of the
transaction is only a sham and that what the parties really agreed upon was a
loan which they disguised, for example, as a discounting operation, then the
court will call it by its real name and act accordingly.

In short, while factoring arrangements and the sale of book debts are not
moneylending in form, the court will take a pragmatic approach by looking to
the nature of the transaction and consider whether the arrangements are in
fact a sham to disguise what was really a loan transaction.

66 Reference was made in City Hardware (at [26] and [27(a)]) to the English
case of Olds Discount Co Ltd v John Playfair Ltd [1938] 3 All ER 275 (“Olds
Discount”), where it was held that the sale of book debts is not a
moneylending transaction. Rajah J also quoted the following passage in Olds
Discount at 280:

Unless there was evidence upon which it would be proper for the court to act
that the parties had deliberately entered into those documents knowing that
they did not represent what had been agreed between them, but that what had
been agreed between them was something quite different, it seems to me that
the proper course for the court to take is to accept the formal agreements
between the parties, and to decide their rights according to those agreements.

Analysis of the arguments raised by the defendants

67 In these circumstances and on the basis of the documents constituting the
CS Membership Agreement, I see no reason to doubt that the sale and purchase
of the Traded Debts were genuine sale transactions of book debts and not
disguised loan transactions. To show otherwise, the defendants raise a number
of arguments, but I do not find them to be persuasive for the reasons stated
below.

68 First, the defendants place reliance on the fact that the Traded Debts, as
well as the receivables previously traded under the VPD RPA, were purchased at
a discounted rate of 80% of the invoice value. 69

##### Foot Note 69

×

Choy’s affidavit, para 51; Defendants’ submissions, para 52(a).

However, this discount is fully consistent with the nature of a sale and
purchase of receivables. The plaintiffs cite Welsh Development Agency v Expert
Finance Co Ltd [1992] BCC 270 at 283, in which the English Court of Appeal
explained that the “essence” of a factoring transaction is that the sale price
is “necessarily discounted from the full aggregate face value of the debts”.
This is primarily “because the trader will be getting an immediate payment,
while the finance company will have to wait for the debts to come in from the
debtors and they may well not be presently payable” (see also Salinger on
Factoring at para 3-35).

69 On a related note, the defendants seek to rely on the statutory presumption
in s 3 of the Moneylenders Act that “[a]ny person, other than an excluded
moneylender, who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being
repaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender.”
70

##### Foot Note 70

×

Defendants’ submissions, paras 37–38.

The defendants highlight that the discounted sums were paid out in
consideration of larger sums being repaid. This may be true, but it misses the
point that the presumption in s 3 requires the lending of money in the first
place, which is not the case in a true sale of receivables. As Rajah J
remarked in City Hardware at [24], “[i]t is axiomatic that if there has been
no lending there can be no moneylending”. In this case, without some
indication that the factoring of any of the Traded Debts or past receivables
was in substance a loan transaction, the presumption in s 3 does not apply.
Moreover, I add that it is expressly stated that s 3 does not apply to an
“excluded moneylender”, and I will address this issue at [81] below.

70 Next, and also related to the above point regarding the discount rate, the
defendants complain that the “interest rates” charged by the 1st and 2nd
plaintiffs were exorbitant, this being about 7.9% to 10% of the advance sums
paid to the 1st defendant. Further, there was a 2% processing fee imposed for
each transaction. 71

##### Foot Note 71

×

Defendants’ submissions, para 52(b).

Again, the fact of a discount or processing fees, even if “exorbitant” as the
defendants claim, does not ipso facto suggest that these were interest charges
or that the sale of the Traded Debts were loans. As Salinger on Factoring
states at para 3-35, “as opposed to interest which accrues from day-to-day, a
discount is fixed as a deduction from the purchase price at the time of the
purchase”. Further, although this was not specifically argued by the
defendants, I agree with the plaintiffs that the imposition of some interest
for overdue payment under the CS T&Cs does not suffice to change the overall
nature of the transactions involving the Traded Debts from factoring into
loans. 72

##### Foot Note 72

×

Plaintiffs’ submissions, paras 209–210.

71 The defendants further argue that the 1st defendant’s invoices were simply
security for lending. 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

Defence, para 14(f).

This contention is at odds with the CS T&Cs, which provide that each sale and
purchase took effect as an unconditional sale and purchase of the entire legal
and beneficial interest in the said receivable (see [44] above). There is
nothing to suggest that any invoice was meant to be held as a security
interest. Nor do I find that the notices of assignment were held as security
for lending. Even if Chin had previously told the 2nd defendant that Centurion
would hold onto the notices of assignment “just in case” VPD failed to pay,
this was done to facilitate the collection and enforcement of the receivables
from VPD’s customers. The same applies for the 2nd plaintiff and the 1st
defendant in respect of the Traded Debts; cl 6.1 of the CS T&Cs provides for
the 2nd defendant’s right to do so. 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, KCW-2, p 50.

Salinger on Factoring explains at para 3-19 that in confidential invoice
discounting, as was the case here, “notices to the debtors of the assignments
of the debts is not required except in the case of a serious breach of the
agreement by the client or its insolvency”. Here, the notices of assignment
were only sent to the Customers on 30 March 2017 upon the 1st defendant’s
failure to repurchase the Traded Debts (see [27] above). There is no basis
upon which the court may infer that the invoices or the notices of assignment
were being held by the 1st or 2nd plaintiffs as security for payment by the
1st defendant.

72 The 2nd defendant’s affidavit made mention of two other arguments which I
deal with briefly.

(a) First, it was said that the obligation of payment always remained on the
defendants, and that the 2nd plaintiff had no interest in whether the
Customers had made payment. 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

Choy’s affidavit, para 52.

But by providing for the 2nd defendant’s right to collect and enforce the
payment of the Traded Debts by the Customers, cl 6.1 of the CS T&Cs shows that
the 2nd defendant’s argument in this regard is inaccurate. Clause 6.2 confirms
that the 1st defendant is merely the 2nd plaintiff’s sub-agent to administer,
collect and enforce the Traded Debts vis-à-vis the Customers. 76

##### Foot Note 76

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, KCW-2, p 50.

(b) Second, it was contended that the presence of contractual recourse
provisions in favour of the 2nd plaintiff meant that the risk of ownership
remained with the 1st defendant, and would have passed onto the 2nd plaintiff
instead if it had been a true sale agreement. 77

##### Foot Note 77

×

Choy’s affidavit, para 53.

In my view, it was entirely open to the 2nd plaintiff to contractually provide
for the right to require the 1st defendant to repurchase the Traded Debts, and
this does not necessarily indicate that the relevant transactions ought to be
treated as loans. Indeed, such recourse provisions proved vital in protecting
the interests of the plaintiffs, considering the events which precipitated
following the sale of the Traded Debts.

73 The defendants produced correspondence which they argue is consistent with
their characterisation of the arrangement as loan transactions. Specifically,
there was an instant messaging chat transcript between the 2nd defendant and
Lee in December 2014, wherein Lee referred to Chin or Centurion as the
“lender”. 78

Lee was not a representative of ARC, Centurion or any of the plaintiffs, but a
broker from Finaqe that was assisting VPD with procuring capital at the time.
The context was that in late 2014, Lee was in contact with the 2nd defendant
to assess VPD’s eligibility for a term loan, and to help VPD find alternative
financing solutions. Considering this isolated use of the term “lender” by a
third party in context, this does not suffice to create a triable issue. I
also place little significance on the use of the words “repay”, “repaid” or
“repayment” in certain contractual documents and correspondence between the
parties, 79

as I do not think that this necessarily points towards the existence of a
loan.

74 As the defendants describe, there was “a system and continuity to the
financial arrangements to the parties”. According to the defendants, the
contractual documents and agreements entered into by the parties and their
predecessors were all meant “to facilitate, and provide a veneer of
authenticity to, the arrangement between the parties which were, in essence,
moneylending transactions”. The defendants seek to rely on the 174 invoices
(which I have referred to above at [13]) submitted between 2014 and 2016
pursuant to a financing arrangement between Centurion and the 1st defendant’s
predecessors, and highlight that “the total sum repaid was higher than the
total sum that was advanced”. But again, the defendants do no more than to
simply assert that the differences between the discounted price and face value
of the invoices amount to exorbitant “interest” payments, 80

which gives me little cause to draw a different conclusion about the nature of
these previous arrangements than I did at [70] above in respect of the sale of
the Traded Debts.

75 Finally, the defendants annexed to their submissions a list of factual
disputes which they submit give rise to triable issues. 81

##### Foot Note 81

Defendants’ submissions, Annex A.

I have already expressly dealt with some of these purported disputes (eg, the
relevance of the 174 past invoices and the nature of the parties’ relationship
as evidenced by correspondence), whereas some others (eg, the defendants’
awareness of the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs and whether the CS Platform was real)
will be dealt with later on in the judgment. The remaining questions raised by
the defendants are as follows:

(a) who introduced Chin to Finaqe;

(b) whether Chin explained to the 2nd defendant at the 19 December 2014
meeting how the VPD RPA would work and the purpose of the notice of
assignment; and

(c) whether the 1st defendant was incorporated upon Chin’s suggestion.

76 However, even supposing that these amounted to factual disputes, they are
not legally significant facts for the determination of this case. Even if I
accept that Chin had, as the defendants allege, (i) been introduced to Finaqe
by the plaintiffs’ solicitors; (ii) failed to orally explain the VPD RPA and
the notice of assignment to the 2nd defendant; and (iii) suggested that the
2nd defendant incorporate the 1st defendant to be eligible to list the shares
on the CS Platform, these facts do not go any way towards establishing a bona
fide defence for the defendants. In relation to (ii), I note in particular
that the VPD RPA and the documents constituting the CS Membership Agreement
expressly set out the arrangements concerning the sale of invoices.
Considering the elaborate scheme of fabricated invoices and the high-value
transactions that the 2nd defendant had previously entered into on the behalf
of the companies she was a director of, I am also sceptical of the defendants’
characterisation of her as a naïve and unsophisticated retail borrower, 82

##### Foot Note 82

Defendants’ submissions, para 17.

and the suggestion that she would not have been able to understand even the
key terms in the relevant agreements.

77 I find that there are no triable issues as to whether the transactions in
question were really loans in substance. On the face of the documents
constituting the CS Membership Agreement, the sale and purchase of receivables
was intended by the parties. Although the defendants cite the case of Ochroid
Trading Limited (formerly known as Orion Trading Ltd) and another v Chua Siok
Lui (trading as VIE Import & Export) and another [2017] SGHC 56 (“Ochroid
Trading (HC)”) affirmed on appeal at Ochroid Trading Limited (formerly known
as Orion Trading Ltd) and another v Chua Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &
Export) and another [2018] SGCA 5 (“Ochroid Trading (CA)”), there was evidence
in that case that the wife of the 2nd plaintiff had insisted on the fabricated
invoices to mask the true nature of the agreements in question (at [91]). On
the facts, the High Court found that the sums claimed were not investments in
the defendants’ wholesale food business (registered in the first defendant’s
name) but were in fact loans. Further, the plaintiffs were unlicensed
moneylenders and the exception in s 5(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act (lending
exclusively to corporations; see [81] below) did not apply.

78 In the present case, the defendants do not seriously allege that the
plaintiffs were in any way complicit to the fabrication of the invoices, nor
do they make any supportable allegation that the true nature of the relevant
agreements was being masked.

79 In iTronic Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Swee Leon and another suit [2016] 3 SLR
663, the High Court at [63], citing Neuberger J (as he then was) in National
Westminister Bank plc v Rosemary Doreen Jones [2001] BCLC 98 at [59], held
that “[t]he crux of a sham is a common intention to mislead” and that “there
is a strong presumption that parties intend to be bound by the provisions of
agreements which they have entered into”.

80 I see no basis upon which this presumption can be rebutted in the present
case. Apart from the bare assertions of the defendants, there is also no basis
upon which the court may find that the parties entered into the CS Membership
Agreement knowing that the documents did not represent what had been agreed
between them. In such cases, the proper course for the court is to accept the
formal agreements between the parties (Olds Discount at 280). The defendants
cannot create a triable issue in this regard simply by making unsupported
assertions about the nature of the transactions.

Whether the Moneylenders Act applies to the plaintiffs in any event

81 Even if I am wrong in finding that there are no triable issues as to the
nature of the factoring transactions, I note that s 5(1)(b) of the
Moneylenders Act creates an exception for “excluded moneylenders”, which is
defined in s 2(e)(iii)(A) to include any person who lends money solely to
corporations (see [59] above). The defendants do not allege that the 1st and
2nd plaintiffs themselves loaned money to any specific entity or person apart
from corporations. Based on the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs’ requirement that only
corporations could list receivables on the CS Platform, this does not appear
to be the case either. Although the defendants allege that Centurion and ARC
had disbursed funds to “all and sundry, and not just corporations”, 83

##### Foot Note 83

×

Defendants’ submissions, para 35(c)(ii).

this would require me to consider transactions that had been entered into by
Centurion and ARC as being imputable to the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs. Given
their separate legal personalities and the fact that the contracting parties
to the various agreements were different, I would be hesitant to do so. That
said, I reiterate that this is not a point upon which my decision turns.

82 I note also that there is no suggestion or assertion by the defendants that
the monies advanced were in fact loans extended to the 2nd defendant as
opposed to the 1st defendant. Instead, the defence is that the monies were in
fact loans to the 1st defendant. The question is, why would it be necessary to
structure loans to the 1st defendant as transactions for the sale and purchase
of receivables? After all, the Moneylenders Act does not catch loans to
corporations. Whilst the Moneylenders Act does apply to cases where a person
lends money to individuals (and non-corporate entities), it does not catch the
sale and purchase of receivables for the reasons discussed earlier.

83 Regardless, on the basis that the sale and purchase of the Traded Debts do
not amount to moneylending, the defendants have not satisfied their burden of
showing that they have a bona fide defence of illegal moneylending against the
plaintiffs’ claims.

Whether the defendants have any other defence that is bona fide

84 For completeness, I will briefly deal with the other arguments raised in
the defence (see [41] above), even though they were not canvassed in the
defendants’ written or oral submissions.

Whether there was a contractual relationship

85 First, I reject the defendants’ argument that no contractual relationship
existed between the parties. It does not matter that the defendants did not
know the identities of the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs. It suffices that the 1st
defendant listed its receivables on the CS Platform while knowing that they
would be purchased by investors.

Whether the investors, transactions and the CS Platform were genuine

86 The defendants even seek to cast doubt on whether the CS Platform was real
and whether any investors had actually purchased any invoices from the CS
Platform. The 2nd defendant points to the plaintiffs’ “evasiveness” in
providing the warrants to act (from the investor plaintiffs) as support for
the belief that the investors may have purchased nothing at all from the “so-
called platform.” 84

87 The defendants’ contentions regarding the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs are
contradicted by the documents exhibited by the plaintiffs, such as the copies
of the membership applications signed by the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs as
potential investors 85

and e-mail correspondence between the 2nd plaintiff and some of the other
plaintiffs. 86

The identities of the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs were, in any event, made known to
the 1st defendant in the 45 repurchase demands issued by the 2nd plaintiff on
29 and 30 March 2017. 87

##### Foot Note 87

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, KCW-6, pp 819–869.

While I would have preferred to have supporting affidavits from at least a few
of the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs before me, and for the plaintiffs’ solicitors to
have been more forthcoming with producing the warrants to act when requested
to do so by the defendants’ solicitors, I nonetheless see no reason to doubt
that the investors and the transactions involving the Traded Debts were in
fact genuine. The defendants, on the other hand, have not provided any
evidence or material to support their bare assertion that the CS Platform is
not real.

88 Indeed, I note that Kuah Chun Wei (“Kuah”), in his capacity as a director
of the 2nd plaintiff, avers that the 2nd plaintiff had since January 2017 made
repeated requests of the 2nd defendant to provide updated bank statements and
financial documents of the 1st defendant as part of the ongoing due diligence
conducted on all sellers on the CS Platform. This assertion is supported by an
email dated 8 February 2017 sent by Kuah to Lee explaining that the
origination fee of 2% was being imposed (previously waived for the 1st
defendant) to bring it in line with what was charged to the other sellers.
Further, Kuah’s email stated that the cost of servicing the 1st defendant’s
account had increased due to the need to answer investor queries, reimburse
investors for interest discrepancies and follow up with latest bank and
financial statements which the 2nd defendant had yet to receive. 88

Whether the 1st defendant is a party to the CS Membership Agreement and listed
receivables on the CS Platform

89 The defendants then argue that the 1st defendant is not a party to the CS
Membership Agreement. It is clear that the 2nd defendant signed the membership
application form in her capacity as the sole director of the 1st defendant,
and filled in the 1st defendant’s details such as its address and registration
number. 89

90 The 1st defendant also denies having listed any receivables on the CS
Platform as the 2nd defendant had handed the relevant documents to Lee. The
1st defendant’s claim that it was unaware of having listed its receivables on
the CS Platform is plainly disingenuous. This process was consistent with cl
2.1(1) of the CS T&Cs, which provides that “the Seller will List the Debt
through CS Broker”, 90

×

the said broker being Lee. Following the sale and purchase of each Traded Debt
on the CS Platform, a notice of repayment was sent to the 1st defendant
setting out details regarding the listing and purchase of the Traded Debt (see
[24] above). 91

##### Foot Note 91

See Choy’s affidavit, p 186.

Moreover, the 2nd defendant states at [59] of her affidavit that:

Whenever the 2nd Defendant wished to raise funds on the security of the
invoices from the 2nd Defendant (or its related entities) to its customers, I
would contact [Lee] so that he could come by my office and pick up the
required documents. Thereafter, I would leave it to [Lee] to liaise with the
representatives from the 2nd Plaintiffs and/or its related entities for the
administrative aspects of the advancements.

It is abundantly clear that the 2nd defendant submitted the invoices to Lee
and that these related to customers.

Whether the Guarantee is enforceable

91 The defendants further plead that the Guarantee is unenforceable as it was
not signed, sealed and delivered. I note however that the Guarantee expressly
states above the 2nd defendant’s signature that it was executed as a deed poll
and delivered by the 2nd defendant (as the guarantor) in the presence of a
named witness. 92

##### Foot Note 92

Jason Ng’s affidavit, p 19.

In any case, consideration was furnished by the plaintiffs in the form of
their purchases of the Traded Debts and by allowing the 1st defendant to list
its receivables on the CS Platform. The Guarantee is thus enforceable.

92 Contrary to the defendants’ arguments, UCTA is inapplicable to the CS T&Cs.
The plaintiffs do not rely on the CS T&Cs to exclude or restrict any
liability, nor to render substantially different or no contractual
performance, thus it does not matter whether it is a standard form contract as
the defendants point out (see s 3 of UCTA).

Whether the defendants have a defence to the alternative claims

93 Reference was made earlier to the plaintiffs’ alternative claims against
the 1st defendant for fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit as well as the
2nd defendant’s liability for the same through a lifting of the veil of
incorporation. The defendants make certain arguments in respect of the
alternative claims in particular.

(a) First, they read Ochroid Trading (HC) as standing for the proposition that
a “trial court would necessarily have to examine the evidence in the form of
documentary evidence and oral witness testimony, to come to a finding on
whether the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation could be made out”. 93

##### Foot Note 93

×

Defendants’ submissions, para 57.

This is inaccurate. It was simply the case in Ochroid Trading (HC) that the
claim for fraudulent misrepresentation was not made out on the facts. As
observed at [77] above, the facts here are easily distinguishable. It does not
appear that the plaintiffs were aware that the invoices were fabricated, and
the 2nd defendant’s conduct in contacting the Customers and filing a police
report was entirely consistent with this.

(b) Second, they argue that there is no basis to lift the corporate veil of
the 1st defendant, as it was purportedly incorporated at Chin’s behest. In the
same way that I found at [75] above that this dispute of fact was not legally
significant in the context of the illegal moneylending defence, it does not
detract from a finding that the corporate veil should be lifted. I reiterate
that it was not seriously contended that the plaintiffs or Chin knew about the
fabricated invoices. Even if Chin had made the initial suggestion that the 2nd
defendant should incorporate a company to list VP’s receivables on the CS
Platform, this does not change the fact of the 2nd defendant’s intention to
use the 1st defendant as an instrument to further her fraudulent scheme.

Concluding Observations

94 The plaintiffs had entered into what they thought were genuine contracts
for purchase of account receivables of the 1st defendant: a company that was
set up and run by the 2nd defendant. There is no dispute that the 1st
defendant received and accepted considerable sums of money pursuant to the
agreement. So far as the plaintiffs are concerned, the intention was to enter
into a binding contract with the 1st defendant for the purchase of
receivables. The defendants, on the other hand, took the position that the
documents were a sham intended to mask the fact that the arrangement in
substance was illegal moneylending, but failed to provide any support for
their bare allegations in this regard.

95 In summary, the defendants have not established that there is a fair or
reasonable probability that they have a bona fide defence to the plaintiffs’
claims. I add that I do not see any other reason for a trial (see O 14 r 3(1)
of the ROC).

96 In Ochroid Trading (CA), the Court of Appeal observed at [2] that “the
primary issue arising from the appellants’ claim in contract is legally
straightforward, albeit factually intensive – whether the claim fails because
the agreements were illegal moneylending contracts which are unenforceable
under the Moneylenders Act”. This is similar to the present case. In coming to
my decision, I am aware that Ochroid Trading (HC) was decided at first
instance after a full trial. I am also cognisant of the Court of Appeal’s
clear statement in Ochroid Trading (CA) at [206] that the Moneylenders Act
extends not just to the rogue loan shark who preys on the poor and vulnerable,
but to anyone who engages in the business of moneylending within the meaning
of the Moneylenders Act without licence. There is no doubt that the
Moneylenders Act fulfils an important regulatory purpose. That said, for my
reasons at [77] and [93(a)] above, the present case is clearly
distinguishable.

97 Finally, it will be recalled Singapore Civil Procedure states at para
79/1/8 that if a bare allegation of moneylending is asserted to resist summary
judgment, “the borrower may be given only conditional leave to defend”
[emphasis added]. Nevertheless, it does not follow that the court must grant
conditional leave just because a bare allegation of illegal moneylending has
been made. Whether it is appropriate to do so (and on what conditions, such as
payment into court of some, or all, of the amount claimed) must depend on the
usual principles as discussed in Singapore Civil Procedure at para 14/4/12. In
the circumstances, whilst I do not see fit to grant the defendants conditional
leave to defend, a very substantial payment would have been appropriate if I
had been of the view that a case for conditional leave to defend was merited.

Conclusion

98 For the above reasons, I grant summary judgment for the plaintiffs.

99 I allow the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants for their share of the
repurchase prices and repurchase fees in respect of the 60 Traded Debts,
accruing until the date of this judgment.

100 Under cl 14.1 of the CS T&Cs, the 1st defendant agreed to compensate and
indemnify the 1st plaintiff “in full for all losses, actions, proceedings,
costs, claims, demands, awards, fines, orders, expenses and liabilities
(including legal fees on an indemnity basis) incurred” in respect of any
breach of the 1st defendant’s obligations under the CS Membership Agreement
(cl 14.1(1)) or as a result of the 1st defendant’s “fraud or wilful
misconduct” (cl 14.1(6)). 94

##### Foot Note 94

×

Kuah’s 1st affidavit, KCW-2, pp 59–60.

Although I am aware that these contractual obligations strictly only apply
between 1st defendant and the 1st plaintiff, I consider it appropriate under
these circumstances to order that the costs of these proceedings to be agreed
or taxed on an indemnity basis, and paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs.
