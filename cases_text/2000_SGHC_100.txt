**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

_

The facts

_

1\. The plaintiffs and the defendant are brothers. Their father was Leo Ann
Peng (the deceased) who died on 28 September 1989 leaving a Will dated 26
March 1970 (the Will). Two of the sons, namely Leo Teng Kit (the first
plaintiff) and Leo Teng Choy (the defendant) were appointed trustees under the
Will.

2\. In 1956, the deceased purchased a property situated at No. 42, Phillips
Avenue (the property) and resided there until his death; the property was his
only asset. Clauses 2, 3 and 4 of the Will provided for its disposition as
follows:

> 2\. I give and devise my land and house No. 42, Phillips Avenue, Singapore
> unto my trustees UPON TRUST to stand possessed of the same and to allow my
> wife Heng Took Kin and my sons Leo Teng Kit, Leoh Teng Hee, Leo Teng Choy
> and Leo Tang Foh to reside therein free of rent provided each of my said
> sons shall pay one-fourth share of all rates, taxes, charges and expenses on
> repairs as shall from time to time be incurred.
>
> 3\. I direct that my said land and house No. 42, Phillips Avenue, Singapore,
> shall not be sold, rented out or in any way converted into cash unless and
> until unanimously agreed upon by my said sons Leo Teng Kit, Leo Teng Hee,
> Leo Teng Choy and Leo Tang Foh in which event the net proceeds of sale from
> the said land and house shall be distributed to my said sons in equal
> shares.
>
> 4\. In the event of the death of any of my aforesaid sons either before my
> death or after my death but before the said land and house is sold his share
> shall be divided among his children in equal shares and if there be no
> children his share shall revert to the surviving beneficiaries in equal
> shares.

3\. After the demise of the decease, the first plaintiff and the defendant
applied for grant of probate in Probate No. 1750 of 1992 which grant was
extracted on 27 January 1993.

4\. Although all members of the Leo family lived at the property, friction
developed amongst them even during the lifetime of the deceased primarily due
to overcrowding arising from space constraints; the family grew as each of the
sons married and started their own families in turn. Due to the frequent
quarrels amongst the family members, Leo Teng Hee (the second plaintiff) and
his family moved out sometime in 1980. His departure was followed by that of
the first plaintiff with his family in 1992.

5\. Sometime in September 1992, the parties' mother Madam Heng Took Kin
suffered a stroke. After her discharge from hospital, the defendant refused to
take her back so Madam Heng went to live with the second plaintiff. The third
plaintiff moved out not long after, leaving the defendant (and his family) in
exclusive occupation of the property.

6\. In December 1996 when the first plaintiff visited the property, he noticed
that the furniture and belongings of himself and his other siblings as well as
of his mother were missing. When he inquired of the defendant, he was told
that most of them had been thrown away.

7\. On or about 22 December 1996, the first plaintiff (and his wife) visited
the defendant to inform the latter that the first and second plaintiffs wanted
to meet him to discuss the conveyance of the property to the four
beneficiaries under the Will; they were concerned about the delay in conveying
the property after the grant of probate was extracted and, they were not
getting any younger. The first plaintiff alleged that the defendant flew into
a rage when he broached the subject and threatened to assault the first
plaintiff, prompting the latter to lodge a police report. That incident was
followed by another on 23 December 1996 when the defendant and his son went to
the first plaintiff's flat in the early hours of the morning and demanded to
see the first plaintiff who refused to accede to their demand and whose son
had to call for the police before the defendant would leave.

8\. After the first plaintiff and the other plaintiffs had discussed the
matter with their mother, they unanimously agreed to sell the property and to
divide the sale proceeds amongst the four beneficiaries. Apparently, the
defendant's (former) solicitors had earlier advised him that the property
should be conveyed to the four beneficiaries. Subsequently however, the same
solicitors (in December 1996) reversed their previous advice and said the four
beneficiaries only had an interest in the sale proceeds of the property but
not in the property itself. The defendant, also on the same solicitors'
advice, had made a primary application to bring the property under the Land
Titles Act but withdrew the application subsequently. Although reminded by the
first plaintiff's solicitors in July and September 1999, the defendant refused
to proceed with the application. Apparently he had also misplaced the title
deeds for the property but failed to obtain a replacement.

9\. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant adopted an oppressive and
hostile attitude towards them and that, he was dilatory in the discharge of
his duties as a trustee of the estate, seemingly content to do nothing on his
former lawyers' (erroneous) advice that the beneficiaries have no equitable
interest in the property and therefore the property need not be conveyed to
them. However, the property was conveyed to the first plaintiff and the
defendant as trustees sometime in 1999.

10\. Believing that it was not their father's intention to let the defendant
or any beneficiary occupy the property to the exclusion of other beneficiaries
and as their father would not have envisaged the impasse that had since arisen
between his sons, the plaintiffs instituted these proceeding and applied inter
alia, for the following reliefs:-

> a. that it may be determined on a true construction of the Will, whether the
> property is held by the first plaintiff and the defendant as executors and
> trustees of the Will on trust for the first, second and third plaintiffs as
> well as for the defendant;
>
> b. that it may be determined whether the beneficiaries under the trust are
> beneficially interested in the property as tenants in common or as joint
> tenants;
>
> c. that, if tenants in common, whether the said interests are in equal
> shares or in some other shares and if so, which;
>
> d. that the first plaintiff and the defendant be ordered to sell the
> property being property held by them as such trustees upon sale,
> notwithstanding that the defendant refuses to consent to the sale or consent
> of the defendant cannot be obtained;
>
> e. alternatively, that the property be sold by order of the Court.

In support of their application, the plaintiffs exhibited a statutory
declaration which their mother had made on 5 June 1997 'for use in any legal
proceedings in relation to any dispute which may arise in relation to [her]
late husband's property'. In essence she supported the allegations made by the
first plaintiff in his affidavit.

11\. After making several attempts (without success) to persuade the parties
to try and resolve their differences by having the defendant buy out the
beneficial interests of the plaintiffs in the property (based on its current
market value) if he wished to continue to reside there, I made the following
orders on 15 February 2000:-

> a. an order in terms of prayer (a);

> b. that the plaintiffs and the defendant as beneficiaries are entitled to
> the property as tenants in common each holding Œ share;
>
> c. the property be sold within 60 days (namely by 15 April 2000) with vacant
> possession at or above $3.75m by either public auction or by private treaty,
> such sale to be conducted by plaintiffs' solicitors with defendant's
> solicitors' cognisance;
>
> d. costs to the plaintiffs fixed at $4,000 with disbursements on a full
> indemnity basis to be deducted from the defendant's share of the net sale
> proceeds;
>
> e. parties to have liberty to apply.

The defendant has appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No 26 of
2000).

The arguments

(i) the plaintiffs' case

12\. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that a plain reading of cll 3,4 and
6 of the Will meant that the plaintiffs and the defendant are absolutely
entitled to the property as tenants in common in equal shares, contrary to the
opinion of the defendant's former solicitors that the beneficiaries only had a
contingent pecuniary interest in the sale proceeds. They argued that the
provision under cl 3 of the Will (that the property cannot be sold without the
unanimous consent of the beneficial owners) was only a super-added direction
which did not detract from the deceased’s intention to give the property to
the beneficiaries who, being adults and absolutely entitled, can unanimously
terminate the trust and divide the property amongst themselves under the rule
in _Saunders v Vautier_ [1835-1842] All ER 58.

13\. Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the Court has a discretion
to order a sale of the property under s 59(1) of the Trustees Act 1985 edition
(which is now s 56(1) of the 1999 edition (Cap 337), citing various English
cases to support their proposition. They argued that the pre-condition of
unanimity by the beneficiaries before a sale can be effected only related to
the timing of the sale, not that it was prohibited altogether, relying on
_Marlborough (Duke) v Attorney-General (No. 2)_ [1944] Ch 145 and _Rajabali
Jumabhoy v Ameerali R Jumabhoy_ [1998] 2 SLR 439.

__

(ii) the defendant's case

14\. Before I go into the arguments presented on behalf of the defendant, I
should briefly mention the contents of his affidavit in reply to the first
plaintiff's filed in support of the application herein. Like the plaintiffs,
he had (by way of rebuttal) raised numerous but irrelevant issues including
inter alia, the fact that he had contributed towards the construction of a
proper access road (in lieu of a gravel road) to the property in or about
1966. Not unexpectedly, he denied he was on bad terms with his brothers and,
that he had assaulted or attempted to assault any of his siblings (including
the first plaintiff) or their children, citing various instances over the
years where he had assisted his siblings and or their children financially. He
pointed out that the three plaintiffs moved out because they had purchased HDB
flats even before the deceased's demise, not because they could not get along
with him. He further denied he refused to let his mother Madam Heng return to
reside at the property after her hospitalisation due to a stroke, accusing the
third plaintiff of poisoning her mind against him. He discovered subsequently
that the third plaintiff had taken the mother to see a lawyer to execute a
will, in September 1992, prior to her stroke. Even after the mother went to
live with the second plaintiff, the defendant claimed that he visited her
frequently until he was forbidden by the second plaintiff in 1994 from going
to the latter's home.

15\. The defendant explained that he disposed off his siblings' belongings and
furniture which they left behind because they eventually resulted in termite
infestation which damaged the wooden partitions of the property; he exhibited
a survey report to support his contention.

16\. The defendant revealed that when the first plaintiff visited him on 22
December 1996, it was to ask him to sign a Deed of Assent and Conveyance which
had been prepared by the trustees' former solicitors on the first plaintiff's
instructions (without consulting him although he was a joint trustee) and
which would have made the four siblings joint title-holders of the property
which effect (he ascertained subsequently), would have meant that the property
could be sold with a majority vote instead of unanimously, as required under
the Will; naturally he refused to sign as a responsible trustee. The first
plaintiff then attempted to persuade him to sell the property and distribute
the sale proceeds. When the defendant refused, the first plaintiff threatened
to force a sale by legal means. The defendant denied he had not been diligent
in the discharge of his duties as executor of the estate of the deceased. In
fact, it was the first plaintiff who was derelict in his duties as a trustee
(including failing to attend a trustees' meeting held on 27 December 1996 at
the first plaintiff's behest), leaving it to the defendant to perform all the
duties alone. He therefore questioned the first plaintiff's ulterior motive in
suddenly wanting to perform his duties as a trustee … it was to sell the
property and to enrich the first plaintiff. He accused all the plaintiffs of
colluding to circumvent the Will by alleging misconduct on his part.

17\. Finally, the defendant alleged that the statutory declaration made by
Madam Heng was done under the undue influence of the plaintiffs as, after her
stroke, she was unlikely to be able to have a considered opinion on such
matters.

18\. Turning now to the arguments presented for the defendant, his counsel
took a stand contrary to that of counsel for the plaintiffs. Counsel submitted
that the plain and literal meaning of cl 6 of the Will meant that the children
only had an interest and a right to the _residue and remainder_ of the estate
without restrictions; they had no interest per se in the property, only in its
sale proceeds. Consequently no tenancy in common in the property exists
between the siblings. No authorities were cited by counsel for this
proposition. Counsel had also overlooked the fact that the property was the
only asset of the deceased’s estate and as such there could be no residue and
remainder in which the beneficiaries could have an interest. He pointed out
that the Will imposed conditions if the siblings wished to stay at the
property but no penalty if they chose not to and, expressly forbade its
renting out. The plaintiffs moved out voluntarily and fortified their action
by not contributing their Œ share of the charges for the upkeep of the
property. The pre-requisite for a unanimous decision before a sale could be
effected was to ensure that none of the siblings wanted to reside at the
property any longer. Counsel said that to allow the plaintiff's proposed
forced sale would be to go against the wishes of the deceased.

_

The decision

_

19\. There is little doubt that the plaintiffs were prompted to make this
application in their own interests and, by the same token, the defendant is
resisting it for his own selfish reasons. I disbelieved both sides' claims to
the noble reasons for their respective actions.

20\. The only issue that needed to be determined was, does the Will expressly
prohibit a sale of the property as the defendant contends or, does it merely
postpone it as the plaintiffs submit? Attendant to the issue is the peripheral
issue of whether the four beneficiaries under the Will only have a contingent
interest in the sale proceeds of but, not in the property itself. I had, in
the orders which I made, taken the view that the sale of the property was not
prohibited but only postponed which postponement I terminated and in the
process expedited the sale, in order to bring about an equitable solution to
the existing impasse between the siblings.

21\. It would be appropriate to first refer to s 56(1) of the Trustees Act Cap
337 (the Act); it states:-

> Where in the management or administration of any property vested in
> trustees, any sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release or other
> disposition, or any purchase, investment, acquisition, expenditure, or other
> transaction, is in the opinion of the court expedient, but the same cannot
> be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose vested in
> the trustees by the trust instrument, if any, or by law, the court may –
>
> (a) by order confer upon the trustees, either generally or in any particular
> instance, the necessary power for the purpose, on such terms, and subject to
> such provisions and conditions, if any, as the court may think fit; and
>
> (b) direct in what manner any money authorised to be expended, and the costs
> of any transaction, are to be paid or borne as between capital and income.

The above section has to be read with s 2(2) of the Act which states:-

> The powers conferred by this Act on trustees are in addition to the powers
> conferred by the instrument, if any, creating the trust, but those powers,
> unless otherwise stated, apply if and so far only as a contrary intention is
> not expressed in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, and have effect
> subject to the terms of that instrument.

The above two sections would help to address whatever shortcomings there may
be in the Will in carrying out the wishes of the deceased so long as it did
not mean going against his express wishes. Section 59(3) of the Act
specifically empowers either trustees or beneficiaries under the trust to
apply to court under the section.

22\. Next, I turn to the cases cited. In support of their submission that the
Court was empowered by s 59 of the Act to order an immediate sale of the
property, the plaintiffs relied on the recent decision in _Rajabali Jumabhoy &
Others v Ameerali R Jumabhoy (supra). _There, the Court of Appeal inter alia
had to determine the terms of a deed of settlement relating to a property (at
No. 8 Scotts Road) which expressly gave the trustees a power of sale but with
the discretion to postpone the sale for so long as the trustees think fit. The
appellate court, following the decision in _Marlborough v Attorney-General_
(supra) held that the fact that there was a discretion vested in the trustees
as to the timing of the sale did not prevent the trust for sale from arising.

23\. In _Marlborough v Attorney-General_ the English Court of Appeal had to
interpret the following clause 11 of a deed of settlement dated 11 April 1905
made by the then Duke of Marlborough:

> Notwithstanding anything herein contained no sale of any hereditaments for
> the time being subject to the trusts hereof or of any right or interest
> therein or thereover and no purchase of any hereditaments under any power
> herein contained and no investment of any capital money for the time being
> held on the trusts hereof and no change of any investment for the time being
> held on the trusts hereof shall (except in pursuance of an order of the
> court) be made by the trustees or trustee without the previous consent in
> writing of the present Duke during his life and after the death of the
> present Duke without the previous consent in writing of the person in whom
> the Dukedom of Marlborough settled by the said Act 5 Anne Chapter 3 , shall
> for the time being be vested thereunder if such person shall be of full
> age…..

Morton LJ held that the trust for sale effected an immediate conversion
notwithstanding the necessity for consent. He said (at pp 154-5):-

> The doctrine of conversion arose, no doubt from the rule of equity which
> considers that as being done which ought to be done, and the courts might
> have taken the view in the past that if a sale under the trust for sale in a
> deed is only to take place with the consent of AB no conversion takes place
> until such consent is given to the trustees. It might have been held that
> then, and only then, does it become the duty of the trustees to sell, and
> then, and only then, does conversion take place in equity. It is however,
> well settled that if real property is vested in trustees on trust for sale
> with the consent of AB, the consent is treated as intended to regulate the
> exercise of the trust for sale, but not to prevent the trust for sale from
> being an immediate trust; and if there is an immediate trust for sale,
> whether subject to consent or not, the trust operates at once to effect a
> conversion…..

24\. Looking at cl 3 of the Will in its context, and bearing in mind the above
extract from Morton LJ's judgment, it seems quite clear to me that a sale of
the property was merely postponed, not prohibited, until all four
beneficiaries unanimously agreed to the same.

25\. Counsel had also relied on _Saunders v Vautier_ in support of the
plaintiffs’ proposition that they had an immediate, not a contingent interest
in the property. The headnotes in that case read:-

> By his will the testator bequeathed to his executors and trustees all the
> East India stock which should be standing in his name at his death on trust
> to accumulate the dividends until his great nephew V should attain twenty-
> five and then to transfer the principal, together with such accumulations,
> to V, his executors, administrators, or assigns absolutely. The will also
> contained a residuary bequest. The testator had  2,000 East India stock
> standing in his name at his death.
>
> **
>
> Held
>
> ** : V took an immediate vested interest in the legacy although he was a
> minor at the testator's death and, the stock, with its accumulations, would
> be transferred to him on his attaining the age of twenty-five.

Looking at cll 2 and 3 of the Will in the above context and in the light of my
decision on the main issue, I was unable to accept the argument of counsel for
the defendant that the four beneficiary sons of the deceased only had a
contingent interest in the sale proceeds of the property, if and when a sale
was effected.

26\. I had fixed the sale price of the property at or above $3.75m based on
the two valuations obtained, one from the plaintiffs' valuers (at $4.3m) and
the other from the defendant's valuars ($3.2m); I took the average of the two
valuations ($7.5 ‹ 2). I should add that the defendant instructed his valuer
to apportion the valuation figure of $3.2m between the house ($150,000) and
the land ($3,050,000), an unreasonable and unjustified stance. It was clear
from photographs exhibited in the affidavits that the house itself was
worthless and the value of the property was in the land; any purchaser would
have to demolish the existing house and rebuild. Counsel for the defendant
informed the court that even based on his client's own valuation, the
defendant would have difficulty obtaining a loan from any financial
institution (due to his age and income level) to buy over the Ž share of his
siblings. Yet, he was adamant on continuing to reside at the property. The
defendant's attitude to say the least was unreasonable. Even if he succeeded
in postponing the sale of the property until his death, the defendant was
being short-sighted in his complacency. The day of reckoning could not be
postponed indefinitely and a time would come when selling the property became
inevitable either during or after, the lifetime of the defendant. The
defendant and or his family would then be forced to seek alternative
accommodation which can only become increasingly more expensive in land
scarced Singapore.

27\. Consequently, the only feasible solution in the interests of all the
siblings, none of whom were particularly well-to-do, was to order an immediate
sale of the property so that all the beneficiaries could obtain their Œ share
of the sale proceeds either to purchase an alternative home (as in the case of
the defendant) or to find some other use for their money which would be quite
substantial; hence the orders which I made.
