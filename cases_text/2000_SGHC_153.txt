: On 15 February 2000, the 15 defendants in this originating summons commenced
Suit 600156/2000 against Lachman s/o Teckchand and Jethi Bai Bhagwandas,
trading as Shah Electronics, and against Ramesh s/o Lachman, formerly trading
as Shah Electronics (hereinafter referred to as `the debtors`). On the same
day, the present defendants applied by ex parte summons-in-chambers for an
attachment order before judgment pursuant to s 17 Debtors Act and for an order
that the Sheriff be directed to seize the properties listed in a schedule
attached to the summons-in-chambers as a pledge or surety to answer the just
demand of the present defendants until the trial of the action and
satisfaction of any judgment in the sum of $1,435,879.64 and costs estimated
at $25,000. The properties described in the schedule comprised a shop unit
B1-08 High Street Centre 1, a residential unit in Dunman Road, a motor car,
all the stock-in-trade lying at the debtors` shop premises at [num ]02-11,
Satnam House, High Street and all moneys in the names of the debtors with DBS
Bank, Raffles City Branch.  
  
The affidavit in support of the above application was affirmed by one Raj
Kumar who stated as follows (the `plaintiffs` mentioned in the affidavit being
a reference to the present defendants):

> _
>
> 1 I am the Operations Manager of the ninth plaintiffs and the duly appointed
> and authorised representative of the all the other plaintiffs in this action
> to make this affidavit.
>
> 2 I depose that the facts and matters stated in this affidavit that are
> within my own personal knowledge are true and that the facts and matters
> stated in this affidavit that are not within my own personal knowledge are
> true to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.
>
> 3 My appointment have been made on the basis that I am known to the various
> plaintiffs and I was previously appointed as one of the members of the
> creditors committee which was formed to enter into a scheme of arrangement
> with the defendants. I have been in the electronics industry for the last
> twenty four (24) years and I am personally known to most established
> electronics traders in Singapore.
>
> 4 The plaintiffs in this action have a good cause of action against the
> defendants. Now produced herewith and marked as exh `RK-1` to `RK-15` are
> copies of invoices/statements of account supporting the plaintiffs` claims.
> The plaintiffs` claims total S$1,435,879.64.
>
> 5 The defendants` firm `Shah Electronics` was a customer of the plaintiffs
> and had purchased electronics goods from time to time. A perusal of the
> invoices would reveal that bulk of the electronics goods were purchased by
> the defendants in the third quarter of 1999, shortly before ceasing
> business.
>
> 6 About early December 1999 the defendants informed their creditors that
> they were facing financial difficulties and would be unable to pay their
> creditors. The defendants` total debts are in the region of about
> S$2,000,000.
>
> 7 The defendants firm `Shah Electronics` comprised three (3) partners,
> consisting of father and mother. The first and second defendants (husband
> and wife) left Singapore for India in or about late December 1999 and have
> not returned since. The third defendant is in Singapore although his exact
> whereabouts are not known. The third defendant has intimated to me recently
> that he may leave for India as his parents are not in good health. I have
> difficulty tracing the physical whereabouts of the third defendant
> presently.
>
> 8 In the absence of the first and second defendants, the third defendant,
> being the son of the first and second defendants, had purported to enter
> into a scheme of arrangement with creditors and had applied for an interim
> order under the bankruptcy act for a stay. I verily believe that such order
> was discharged principally on grounds that the third defendant has since
> withdrawn as a partner of the defendants firm of Shah Electronics and had no
> locus standi to in the matter to affirm affidavits.
>
> 9 Now annexed herewith marked `RK-16` is a recent Registry of Business
> search on the defendant firm which confirm the withdrawal of the third
> defendants as a partner.
>
> 10 The third defendant did not inform the creditors of his withdrawal. To
> the best of my knowledge the third defendant is carrying on business in
> electronics trade in Serangoon Road. There is no indication whatsoever of
> the return to Singapore of the first and second defendants. Their precise
> place of abode in India cannot be discovered. Being late in years their
> return to Singapore is unlikely.
>
> 11 In the proposed scheme of arrangement the assets for distribution
> proposed by third defendant, (without disclosure that he had ceased to be a
> partner) offered the following ownership whereof have been admitted. A copy
> of the written proposal is annexed marked `RK-17`.
>
> 12 Despite repeated requests for details of bank statements, to show his
> bona fides, the third defendant has refused to disclose his financial
> movements. This is clearly inconsistent with the proposal of scheme of
> arrangement made by the third defendant. On or about 15 December 1999, a
> cheque drawn by the defendants on their bankers DBS Bank, Raffles City
> branch, Singapore was countermanded. Although it is obvious there were funds
> in the said account, payment was intentionally stopped by the defendants. To
> date in spite of the rejection by the court of the defendants` application
> for an interim order, the defendants have failed to take any step towards
> payment or account for the said sum to the 15 plaintiffs. Now produced
> herewith and marked as `RK-18` is a copy of the cheque and return advise
> from the bank dated 15th December 1999 which is self-explanatory. In the
> light of the fresh involvement by the third defendant in business, it is

> indicate the defendants` intention to obstruct or delay the execution of any
> judgment or order that may be made against them.
>
> 13 On or about the 31 December 1999, the defendants` tenancy of their
> business premises, namely, No 67, High Street, [num ]01-07 Satnam House
> expired. Although the registered principal place of business remains
> unaltered in the Registry of Business, the stock-in-trade of the defendants

The ex parte summons-in-chambers was fixed for hearing before me at 10 am on
16 February 2000. Mr Darshan Singh Purain who attended the hearing as counsel
for the 15 present defendants informed me that he was applying under s
17(1)(a) and (c) Debtors Act. I granted him the orders sought.  
  
On 21 February 2000, the present plaintiffs applied by SIC 600852/2000 for
leave to intervene in Suit 600156/2000 and for the attachment order made on 16
February 2000 to be discharged. The respective solicitors for the present
plaintiffs, the present defendants and the debtors appeared before a judge on
24 February 2000 when the application was adjourned one week because of
another application on 28 February 2000 which could resolve the matters
raised.  
  
The matter fixed for hearing on 28 February 2000 was an application for
judgment by admission. Only the solicitors for the present defendants and for
the debtors attended before the senior assistant registrar. The matter was not
contested and judgment was entered for the amount claimed and for costs of
$4,000.  
  
On 9 March 2000, the application for leave to intervene was heard by a judge.
Counsel for the said three parties attended. An order in the following terms
was made:

> _
>
> 1 Leave be granted to withdraw the applicants` application;
>
> 2 No costs be payable by the applicants unless fresh proceedings relating to
> the same matter are instituted by the applicants. In such an event, cost of
> this application will be considered and will follow the event.
>
> _

  
  
The `applicants` referred to in the above order are the present plaintiffs in
this originating summons.  
  
The present plaintiffs and present defendants failed to resolve their
differences and on 22 March 2000, the present plaintiffs commenced this
originating summons against the 15 defendants for the following orders:

> _
>
> (1) The ex parte attachment order dated 16 February 2000 obtained in Suit
> 600156/2000 by the defendants (the plaintiffs in Suit 600156/2000) against
> (the debtors) be discharged and/or be set aside;
>
> (2) a declaration that the plaintiffs have priority of the sale proceeds
> pursuant to the WSS 51324/2000 filed in DC Suit 51250/99;
>
> (3) the Sheriff be directed to retain the sale proceeds or part thereof
> until the hearing of this matter and/or the final disposal of the same;
>
> (4) costs be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs;
>
> (5) costs in respect of SIC 600852/2000 in Suit 600156/2000 be paid by the
> defendants to the plaintiffs; and
>
> (6) such further order or other relief as this honourable court deems just.
>
> _

  
  
Vishinu s/o Metharam, a director of the present plaintiffs, stated that on 14
December 1999, the present plaintiffs commenced proceedings against the
debtors for goods sold and delivered for the sum of $135,737.51 in DC Suit
51250/99. What followed therefrom were listed in a chronology of events as

Due to the interim order obtained on 3 January 2000 by the debtors pursuant to
Part V Bankruptcy Act, the plaintiffs here only obtained judgment on 15
February 2000. The next day, the plaintiffs filed Writ of Seizure and Sale
(`WSS`) 51324/2000 against the debtors` property. Vishinu then went on to set
out the facts pertaining to Suit 600156/2000 mentioned earlier in this
judgment. He explained that the application for leave to intervene was
withdrawn on 9 March 2000 for the purpose of settling the matter amicably but
talks held on 10 March 2000 failed to resolve the differences and hence the
present originating summons.  
  
On 9 March 2000, the Sheriff proceeded with the auction sale under the WSS
600019/2000 filed by the present defendants on 28 February 2000 pursuant to
the judgment by admission obtained by them. The sale proceeds were still in
the possession of the Sheriff.  
  
Vishinu incorporated all the court papers filed in Suit 600156/2000 and stated
that it was clear from the chronology set out by him that the present
plaintiffs` application for judgment had either been prevented and/or
adjourned by reason of the applications taken up by the debtors and/or the
present defendants during the period between 3 January 2000 to 16 February
2000 and that the plaintiffs` application for judgment originally fixed to be
heard on 6 January 2000 was eventually heard and granted only on 15 February
2000.  
  
For the reasons stated in his affidavit filed on 21 February 2000 in Suit
600156/2000, he believed:

(1) the defendants had failed to make a case for an ex parte attachment order
(`AO`) of the debtors` properties before judgment;

(2) that the purpose of obtaining the ex parte AO was to gain priority or at
the least to rank equally with the plaintiffs` claim;

(3) that the debtors had no intention to obstruct or delay the execution of
any judgment;

(4) that there was no evidence that the debtors had removed or concealed or
were making away with any of their movable or immovable properties or had done
any act with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any judgment;

(5) that the debtors had disclosed liberally all their assets and their
location/whereabouts and that their conduct throughout had been transparent.  
  
His affidavit of 21 February 2000 began by setting out the history of the
proceedings from the time the plaintiffs commenced their action against the
debtors in the District Court until the judgment obtained on 15 February 2000.
It incorporated the court papers in the District Court proceedings and in the
debtors` bankruptcy applications.  
  
The 21 February 2000 affidavit went on to state that since the voluntary
arrangement, the debtors had kept their stock-in-trade in [num ]01-07 and [num
]02-01 Satnam House and the present defendants were aware of this. Even when
the debtors shifted their goods from [num ]01-07 to [num ]02-11, the
defendants and other creditors were kept informed. An inventory of the goods
was also provided to the creditors. As evidence of their sincerity in paying
the creditors and preventing the dissipation of the goods, the debtors handed
the keys of [num ]02-11 to the creditors` committee convened on 21 December
1999 pursuant to the voluntary arrangement.  
  
On 18 February 2000, after the AO had been granted to the present defendants,
Vishinu visited [num ]02-11 Satnam House and found the premises locked. He
understood that the goods were still inside the premises with the Sheriff`s
notice posted on the door.  
  
According to Vishinu, it was plain that the defendants `orchestrated` the AO
against the debtors on the day after the plaintiffs had obtained judgment in
order to have a prior claim over the plaintiffs and not for the reasons stated
in the affidavit supporting the application for the AO. The first two debtors,
who are Singapore citizens, were presently in India for a short break as
stated in their own affidavit of 11 January 2000. His salesman even saw the
third debtor on a MRT train on 16 February 2000.  
  
Raj Kumar, who affirmed the supporting affidavit for the AO application,
explained that the defendants and the other creditors of the debtors had a
creditors` meeting wherein it was resolved that all creditors would hold their
hands in their respective claims with a view to achieving an amicable
resolution. It was agreed that the assets of the debtors did not need to pass
to the Official Assignee if they could be liquidated with the cooperation of
all the creditors and the proceeds be distributed pro-rata. All the creditors,
including the present plaintiffs, appointed a creditors` committee and
resolved not to take legal action against the debtors. Raj Kumar was a member
of that committee.  
  
However, contrary to the aforesaid understanding, the present plaintiffs
commenced an action `to procure and take advantage over the other creditors`.
As a consequence, the debtors applied for an interim order under Part V
Bankruptcy Act to stay all proceedings. The interim order was subsequently
discharged on technical grounds by the plaintiffs.  
  
As a result of the discharge of the interim order, all the creditors were free
to proceed with their actions. Due to the changed circumstances, it was
legitimate for the present defendants to preserve their interests collectively
by commencing Suit 600156/2000, obtaining the AO and subsequently the judgment
and the WSS.  
  
On 9 March 2000, the plaintiffs (as proposed interveners in the abovesaid
suit) saw the futility of their application and withdrew the same. They
persuaded the present defendants not to demand costs as a result of the
withdrawal as they had agreed to cooperate with them. The distribution of the
sale proceeds under the defendants` WSS was thus left to the parties to
resolve.  
  
The defendants` position was that the plaintiffs would rank pari passu with
all the creditors and be paid pro-rata. However, the plaintiffs rejected such
proposals and commenced the present originating summons in disregard of their
commitment to resolve the issue amicably. The defendants asserted that the
plaintiffs` WSS was delayed not because of the defendants but because of the
interim orders obtained by the debtors. The defendants still wished to honour
the spirit of the original understanding of the creditors. If the debtors were
made bankrupts, as they surely would by some creditor, the proceeds would
ultimately be distributed in the same manner anyway.  
  
On 27 March 2000, the defendants wrote to the debtors` solicitors on their
clients` position in this originating summons but were informed that they had
no instructions as the debtors were out of Singapore.  
  
The plaintiffs had not taken any step in execution of their WSS in the
subordinate courts by payment of the deposit required by the Bailiff or by
attending any appointment for execution. The defendants had, on the other
hand, finalized their execution and the net proceeds from the auction sale on
9 March 2000 amounted to $233,035.  
  
Vishinu, in his affidavit of 25 April 2000, denied that there was any
consensus among the creditors at the meeting on 15 December 1999. He attended
that meeting, held one day after the plaintiffs had commenced the District
Court action against the debtors. He left after the conclusion of that
meeting. The creditors` committee was not appointed during that meeting. An
inspection team was formed to ascertain the worth of the stock kept at [num
]02-11 Satnam House. The plaintiffs did not attend any other creditors`
meeting. Two other creditors also started actions against the debtors after 15
December 1999, further evidencing the lack of consensus that day.  
  
At that meeting, it was suggested by the creditors that the keys of [num
]02-11 Satnam House be handed over to the creditors` committee to be formed.
Arrangements were made by the inspection team to verify the stock kept
therein. Vishinu believed that Raj Kumar was a member of the inspection team
and that the creditors collectively placed their own lock on [num ]02-11.  
  
Vishinu also disputed Raj Kumar`s account of the proceedings on 9 March 2000
leading to the withdrawal of the plaintiffs` application. He asserted that the
withdrawal was for the purpose of allowing negotiations and that the
plaintiffs did not persuade the defendants not to demand costs. The right to
commence fresh proceedings was reserved by the plaintiffs and negotiations did
break down.  
  
Vishinu went on to state that there was no need for the plaintiffs to have
proceeded further with their WSS in the subordinate courts as the Sheriff had
already conducted the auction sale on 9 March 2000. The plaintiffs were not
given an earlier date for execution of their WSS due to the existence of the
defendants` AO. The plaintiffs` solicitors had asked for an early date for
execution by their letter dated 15 February 2000 to the Bailiff stating:

> _We shall be grateful if you could allocate us an early date for seizure
> against the first, second and third judgment debtors` movable property at 67
> High Street [num ]02-11 Satnam House, Singapore 179431. The grounds of our
> request is that the first, second and third judgment debtors, we are
> instructed, may be removing goods from their premises and any delay may
> result in our clients being unable to realise the fruits of their judgment._

> _We are prepared to conduct the seizure outside the normal working hours and
> are also prepared to bear the additional costs of the execution._

> _Our clients do not wish to have the first, second and third judgment
> debtors notified of the intended execution and would be most obliged if you
> could let us have an early date for execution as a matter of urgency._

  
  
Vishinu further alleged that the defendants had `failed to show utmost good
faith by not holding back vital information touching upon matters pertinent to
the application.` He also alleged that the defendants had suppressed material
facts at the time the AO was granted.  
  
Raj Kumar replied on 4 May 2000 stating that the creditors` committee was duly
formed and that it carried out its appointed duties. The consensus of the
creditors was that bankruptcy proceedings ought to be avoided and that
consensus crystallized in the formation of the committee. Although some
creditors might have taken independent steps, none of them had taken out
execution proceedings.  
  
Although one set of keys to [num ]02-11 Satnam House was handed over to the
committee, the committee had no access into the premises as the second key was
with the third debtor who also retained the keys to the back door.  
  
On 13 April 2000, the plaintiffs issued a 21-day statutory demand under the
Bankruptcy Act against the second debtor.  
  
In a further affidavit filed on 31 May 2000, Raj Kumar exhibited a letter by
the defendants` solicitors dated 25 May 2000 to the debtors` solicitors
enquiring about the whereabouts of their clients. The debtors` solicitors
replied on 27 May 2000 that they had not heard from the first and second
debtors `for quite some time` and upon receipt of that letter, had contacted
the third debtor who informed them that his parents were out of jurisdiction.  
  
Upon my directions, Mr Darshan Singh Purain conducted searches at the
registries of the Supreme Court and of the Subordinate Courts and reported in
his affidavit of 31 May 2000 as follows. The stamped page of the plaintiffs`
WSS 51324/2000 indicated the time of stamping as 10.32am on 16 February 2000.
The defendants` application for the AO was stamped at 4.20pm on 15 February
2000. Mr Darshan Singh Purain attended before me at 10am on 16 February 2000.
From his recollection, the AO was granted in less than 15 minutes and the
order was extracted and stamped at 11.52am the same day. It was executed by
the Sheriff that same day.  
  
**_The decision of the court_**

****

Section 17(1)(a) and (c) Debtors Act, on which the defendants had relied for
the AO, read:

> _
>
> 17(1) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the court or a judge, at any
> time after the issue of a writ of summons, by evidence on oath, that the
> plaintiff has a good cause of action against the defendant, and -
>
> (a) that the defendant is absent from Singapore and that his place of abode
> cannot be discovered;
>
> (b) ...; or
>
> (c) that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of
> any judgment which has been or may be made against him, has removed, or is
> about to remove, or has concealed, or is concealing, or making away with, or
> handing over to others, any of his movable or immovable property,
>
> _

> _the court or judge may order that the property of the defendant, or any
> part thereof, be forthwith seized by the Sheriff of the Supreme Court as a
> pledge or surety to answer the just demand of the plaintiff, until the trial
> of the action and satisfaction of any judgment that may be made against the
> defendant; but such order shall not constitute the plaintiff a secured
> creditor if the defendant is adjudicated bankrupt:_

> _Provided ..._

  
  
The proviso is not relevant to these proceedings.  
  
Order 74 rr 5 to 11 of the Rules of Court govern the procedural matters
pertaining to an application under the above section. In particular, r 8
provides that seizure shall be effected in the same manner as under a WSS.  
  
The plaintiffs cited various authorities for the proposition that the
jurisdiction to grant an AO is extraordinary in nature and must therefore be
sparingly exercised. This is because the restraint on the use of property
would be before the respective rights of the parties are determined (see for
instance **Kanshi Ram v Hindustan National Bank Ltd** [1928] AIR 376;
**Nanyang Development (1966) Sdn Bhd v Malaysian Armed Forces Cooperative
Housing Society Ltd** [1972] 2 MLJ 149 ). To this extent, the jurisdiction
under the Debtors Act is akin to the general jurisdiction of the courts to
grant injunctions and the principle of full and frank disclosure applies with
equal force to both. It is of course axiomatic that the applicant for an AO
must also satisfy the relevant conditions spelt out in the said s 17(1). The
first prerequisite is that the applicant must have a good cause of action. He
must then satisfy one or more of the disjunctive conditions stipulated in (a),
(b) and (c).  
  
It was further submitted that the jurisdiction in respect of an AO should only
be invoked when the court is satisfied that the debtors are about to dispose
of their property with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any
judgment and that it is imperative that the element of intent be satisfied.  
  
In the High Court suit, the debtors had already conceded that they were
indebted to the defendants here. In fact, within two weeks of the commencement
of that action, judgment by admission was entered. There could therefore be no
doubt that the defendants had a good cause of action against the debtors. In
respect of s 17(1)(a), it was patent that the first and second debtors, the
existing partners of the debtor firm, were not in Singapore at the time of the
application and that, although they were said to have left for India, their
place of abode could not be discovered. Suspecting or even knowing that the
debtors were in any particular country does not detract from this fact. The
fact that they are Singapore Citizens and may or will return some day also
does not change the position. Similarly, the fact that they have solicitors in
Singapore offers cold comfort when the solicitors could not reach them for
instructions. As for s 17(1)(c), paras 5 to 14 of Raj Kumar`s affidavit filed
in support of the AO do support amply the allegation that the debtors had
concealed and made away with the stock-in-trade. The requisite intention, in
almost all cases, can only be inferred from the circumstances. The
countermanding of the cheque, the third Debtor`s resumption of a similar
business elsewhere in Singapore, his failure to inform the creditors earlier
about his withdrawal from the debtor firm and his ability to gain access to
the stock-in-trade in [num ]02-11 Satnam House were circumstances in which one
could justifiably draw the inference that such an intention existed.  
  
At first, I was a little perturbed by para 13 of Raj Kumar`s said affidavit in
that it appeared to suggest that the goods had been siphoned off to [num
]02-11 Satnam House when what was meant was that the goods could have been
siphoned out from [num ]02-11. After considering the matter further, I was
satisfied that para 13 had been drafted inelegantly rather than deceptively.
The failure to disclose the fact that the creditors` committee had one set of
keys and that they had placed a lock on [num ]02-11 did not materially affect
the position as the creditors` committee did not have access to [num ]02-11
anyway and the third debtor had access to the back door of the premises, a
fact the plaintiffs were unable to dispute. It also appeared that the third
debtor could be contacted, at least by his solicitors, although his physical
whereabouts might be unknown to the defendants then. However, this did not
form the crux of the application for the AO.  
  
A recurring theme which emerged in the plaintiffs` submissions was that the
defendants had supported the debtors in their application for an interim order
under the Bankruptcy Act both before and one day after obtaining the AO and
therefore could not have held the belief that caused them to apply for the AO
and that the AO was nothing more than an attempt to steal a march on the
plaintiffs or to prevent the plaintiffs from doing the same to the other
creditors. I note that the debtors had not contested any of the matters
alleged against them in the obtaining of the AO although the AO encompassed
their personal property as well. It was not alleged that the defendants and
the debtors were colluding in this matter. Although they had been generally
cooperative with their creditors, it was not unreasonable for the defendants
to have the fears stated in Raj Kumar`s affidavit supporting the AO in the
light of the changing circumstances of the case. Despite all that the
plaintiffs have argued about the debtors` noble intentions, their solicitors`
letter dated 15 February 2000 to the Bailiff (quoted in para 27 above)
betrayed their true feelings. Having obtained the protection of the AO, it was
not inconsistent for the defendants to have supported the debtors` subsequent
application for another interim order under the Bankruptcy Act if the terms
proposed were acceptable to them.  
  
Considering all the circumstances of this case, I was of the view that the AO
was properly obtained and that there was no material non-disclosure. The duty
of disclosure here need not extend to disclosing each and every affidavit
filed in related proceedings so long as the picture presented to the court is
true and fair.  
  
The matter, however, does not rest there as s 20 Debtors Act provides:

> _Any property so seized, or the proceeds of sale thereof, shall be liable to
> execution in satisfaction of any judgment in the action against the
> defendant; but it shall be subject to the prior claims of any judgment
> creditor whose judgment was obtained within one year before the seizure
> thereof under this Part if the judgment creditor had issued execution
> against the defendant`s property before the making of any order under this
> Part._

  
  
Both ss 17 and 20 fall within Part III of the Debtors Act. It was obvious that
the plaintiffs` judgment had been obtained within one year before the seizure
by the defendants. Have they `issued execution` before the making of the AO?  
  
The defendants said, no, because in **Lloyds and Scottish Finance Ltd v Modern
Cars and Caravans (Kingston) Ltd** [1966] 1 QB 764[1964] 2 All ER 732, Edmund
Davies J, in considering s 26(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1893, made it clear
that until either payment or sale, a WSS remained `unexecuted`. With respect,
I fear that this submission was based on an erroneous reading of the case and
counsel`s submissions therein have been taken as the learned judge`s finding.
The proviso to the said s 26(1) states that no WSS shall prejudice the title
to goods acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable consideration
unless he had at the time when he acquired his title notice that such WSS had
been delivered to and remained unexecuted in the hands of the Sheriff. Edmund
Davies J said (at [1966] 1 QB 764, 781; [1964] 2 All ER 732, 740):

> _... and where such an essential step in execution as actual seizure has
> already been effected, it is, I hold, impossible to regard the writ as one
> which still `remained unexecuted in the hands of the sheriff`._

  
  
In any case, s 20 speaks of `issued execution` and not whether a WSS had been
executed. Order 46 r 4(1) provides that `issue of a writ of execution takes
place on its being sealed by an officer of the Registry`. Order 46 r 1 defines
a writ of execution to include a WSS. Clearly, therefore, the plaintiffs had
`issued execution` against the debtors` property when they took out their WSS.
But did they do so `before the making of any order` under s 17?  
  
Order 42 r 7(1) states that a judgment or order of the court takes effect from
the day of its date. If `before the making of any order` in the said s 20
means the plaintiffs` WSS must have been issued a day earlier, then the
plaintiffs do not obtain priority over the defendants. If those words relate
to the precise time of the day, in all probability the AO was made well before
10.32 am on 16 February 2000 (the earliest time the plaintiffs` WSS could have
been sealed as stamping was required first). The fact that the AO was
extracted well after 10.32am does not change the legal position that it had
been made before the plaintiffs `issued execution`. I therefore hold that s 20
does not accord priority to the plaintiffs.  
  
The defendants also submitted that the plaintiffs had no locus standi to take
out such an application to set aside the AO as the Debtors Act contemplated an
application by the debtor only. In any case, they argued, O 74 r 11 provides
that any claim by a third party to the property seized shall be dealt with in
the manner relating to interpleader proceedings. I do not agree. In the
unusual circumstances here, the plaintiffs obviously had a legitimate interest
as competing creditors to protect. Further, O 74 r 11 only governs
applications by the Sheriff who would proceed by way of interpleader should he
face conflicting claims. It does not deal with the manner in which the
plaintiffs should seek to establish their claim.  
  
In respect of costs, whatever the circumstances leading to the withdrawal of
the plaintiffs` application in Suit 600156/2000 may have been, the order dated
9 March 2000 is clear - it leaves me free to consider the appropriate amount
of costs to award for this originating summons as well as the said earlier
application. As I agreed with some and not all of the defendants` contentions,
I decided that a fair amount of costs to be awarded for both matters would be
$5,000.  
  
In the result, the originating summons was dismissed with costs fixed at
$5,000 to be paid by the plaintiffs to the defendants.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application dismissed.
