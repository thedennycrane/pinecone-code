Philip Pillai J:

Introduction

1 The plaintiff is a painting contractor and the defendant is a manufacturer
and supplier of paint. The full account of the background to the dispute
arising between the parties is set out in _Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger
Paints Singapore Pte Ltd and another appeal_ [2011] 1 SLR 427 (“the CA
decision”).

Background

2 For the purpose of this judgment, which deals solely with the assessment of
damages, it suffices to set out the following salient facts. The plaintiff was
subcontracted to paint the surfaces of a building project at Bukit Batok
Street 23 (‘the Bukit Batok project”) which included:

(a) a 9-storey ramp up building (“Building A”); and

(b) a 30-storey building (“Building B”).

It bought the defendant’s paint for that purpose. The plaintiff applied the
paint to the surfaces of the building project based on the defendant’s
proposed paint system. However, there was extensive discolouration. The
plaintiff bought replacement paint from a third party, Haruna (S) Pte Ltd, and
repainted both the discoloured and adjacent areas in the buildings. Although
the original painting works took 7.5 month to complete, the repainting works
took 16 months. Subsequently, the plaintiff brought the present action
claiming damages for the expense of repainting. It claimed that the defendant
had given a warranty for the paint so long as the use of the paint was based
on the defendant’s proposed paint system. The defendant denied that the paint
was defective and brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff for the
contract price of the goods supplied. It also denied that it had given any
enforceable warranty covering the paint supplied.

3 In _Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte Ltd_ [2010] SGHC
351, I found that the plaintiff had not proven its case (namely that the
defects in the paint had caused the discolouration) on a balance of
probabilities. I also observed _obiter_ that if I had decided on the issue of
the warranty, I would have found that the defendant had warranted all its
products used in any of the plaintiff’s projects for a period of five years,
provided that the use was based on a proposed paint system by the defendant.
The plaintiff appealed. The defendant cross-appealed on the question of the
warranty.

4 The Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant’s cross-appeal on the warranty
at [27]:

... Joseph Yong made his statements to Vincent Lim intending the latter to
rely on them. We therefore find the following assurances given by Joseph Yong
were express terms of the contract:

(a) the Respondent's Decora Emulsion paint would be fit for application on the
internal surfaces of the Bukit Batok project, without the need for a sealer
coat; and

(b) the provision of a five-year warranty for the paints used in the Bukit
Batok project, provided the use of paint was based on a proposed paint system
by the Respondent: see [9] and [10] above as well as [42]-[45] below.

5 The Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff’s appeal and made the following
findings:

38 Accordingly, we find that the paint discolouration was more likely than not
caused by defects in the Decora Emulsion paint supplied by the Respondent.
There has therefore been a breach of the express term of the contract that the
Respondent's paint would be free from defects and fit for application on the
internal surfaces of the Bukit Batok project, without the need for a sealer
coat (see [27(a)] above). This finding obviates the need to consider whether
there is a breach of the implied terms of the SGA.

6 This assessment of damages follows the Court of Appeal’s findings.

My decision

7 The plaintiff’s claim of $1,185,545.60 for special damages is as
follows:[note: 1]

_No._ |  _Description_ |  _Amount_  
---|---|---  
1. |  Worker’s Salary for rectification works |  $631,685.09  
2. |  Dinner for Workers (OT) |  $34,668.00  
3. |  Foreign Worker Levy |  $63,115.00  
4. |  Consumable Tools |  $11,428.35  
5. |  Upkeep for Vehicle GQ 859L |  $11,613.78  
6. |  Accommodation for workers by AC Creative Pte Ltd and Cheer Keong Contractor & Construction |  $29,393.20  
7. |  Administrative Charge |  $16,000.00  
8. |  Rental of Portable Scaffolding, Scissors Lift and Boom Lift from Hup Seng Aluminium Construction Pte Ltd |  $81,579.95  
9. |  Purchase paint from Haruna (S) Pte Ltd for repainting |  $52,242.75  
10. |  Paint Investigation by Setsco Services Pte Ltd |  $10,700.00  
11. |  Sub-Contractor for repainting works by Swiss Plan Construction Pte Ltd |  $224,000.00  
12. |  Repainting works for project at No. 2 Toh Tuck Link |  $9,482.50  
13. |  7% GST |  $82,313.60  
14. |  Set-off for Defendants’ invoice for paint materials |  [less] $72,676.62  
_TOTAL_ |  _$1,185,545.60_  
  
  

8 The general rule is that special damages have to be strictly proven and are
otherwise not recoverable (_Wee Sia_ _Tian v Long Thik Boon_ [1996] 2 SLR(R)
420 at [15]). Where oral evidence is inconsistent with documentary evidence,
and no adequate explanation has been provided, the court may well be justified
in relying solely on what can be proven through documentation and not the oral
testimony, as was the case in _Bocatra Construction Pte Ltd v Thorkildsen_
[1994] 2 SLR(R) 387 at [31]. I bear these principles in mind as I turn to
consider each item claimed by the plaintiff.

9 The plaintiff claims that the entire area that required repainting were as
follows:

(a) 176,882 m² being the equivalent of about 6 out of 9 storeys of Building A;
and

(b) 100,883 m² being the equivalent of about 19 out of 30 storeys of Building
B.

This means that three storeys of Building A and 11 storeys of Building B did
not require repainting by reason of discolouration or had not been originally
painted with the Berger paint. The plaintiff had originally issued a letter of
demand for repainting, of $443,243.20 (excluding the cost of paint). The
plaintiff also claims the costs of a sub-contractor who repainted Building B.

Purchase Paint from Haruna (S) Pte Ltd for repainting

10 The plaintiff claims $52,242.75 for its purchase of 43,400 litres of
replacement paint from Haruna (S) Pte Ltd.

11 In its closing statement, the defendant acknowledged that:[note: 2]

… the Plaintiff is entitled to recover this head of claim should the Defendant
be found liable for the discoloration and if the Defendant is permitted to
recover damages beyond what the parties had contractually agreed.

12 The defendant has since been found by the Court of Appeal to be liable for
the discolouration and damages. Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to
claim for $52,242.75 under this head.

Sub-Contractor for repainting works by Swiss Plan Construction Pte Ltd

13 The plaintiff claims the sum of $224,000.00 as the cost of hiring Swiss
Plan Construction Pte Ltd (“Swiss Plan”) to carry out the repainting works of
the 2nd storey to the 19th storey of the 30-storey building (Building B),
comprising the units’ ceiling and wall and basement-corridor ceiling. This was
completed by March 2009. As this is fully documented in Swiss Plan’s statement
of final account dated 23 March 2009, and is not disputed, I allow this head
of claim.

Other heads of claims

14 What remain to be assessed are the plaintiff’s other heads of claim arising
out of the plaintiff’s repainting works for 6 of the 9 storeys of Building A,
comprising 176,882 m2. It is in evidence from the on-site supervisor, that the
units were repainted for handover by February 2009 and the corridors and
external areas were completed between March and September 2009. The plaintiff
submits invoices and pay slips for these other heads of claim. The defendant
has a common objection to these claims, that the plaintiff has not provided
any evidence to show that these were for costs incurred exclusively for the
repainting of six storeys of Building A. These costs cannot be proved with
complete certainty and I shall accordingly attempt to make an assessment based
on the available evidence. _Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Kamsing Knitting
Factory_ (_A Firm_) [1979] AC 91 at 106.

15 I note that the number of workers originally deployed in the paintworks was
a monthly average of about 20 whilst it was claimed that a monthly average of
23 workers for the repainting. From the invoice submitted by the
subcontractor, Building B was completed by the sub-contractor by March 2009.
Taking into account that the repainting of Building B had been subcontracted
out, and that the plaintiff only repainted 6 storeys of Building A, it would
be safer to adopt a measure of the work done by reference to the 7.5 months
taken to repaint both Building A and Building B which was 7.5 months and to
take into account the respective paint surfaces.

16 Based on the constant of the surface area, Building A comprised around
63.7% of the total surface area originally painted (_ie_ , 176,882 ÷ 277,765 x
100%), all things else being equal, I would apportion the time taken to
repaint Building A (subject to adjustments below) to be around 4.78 months
(_ie_ , 63.7% x 7.5= 4.78 months).

Workers’ Salary for Rectification Works

17 The bulk of the plaintiff’s damage claim is for $631,685.09 allegedly being
the cost of paying its workers to carry out its repainting works. To support
its claim, the plaintiff produced monthly payslips acknowledged by its
workers. Based on the payslips, the plaintiff allegedly took 16,142 man days,
or 16 months, to repaint the affected area.[note: 3]

18 As the plaintiff had already sub-contracted the repainting works of
Building B to Swiss Plan, the plaintiff is only entitled to recover the
workers’ salary for repainting 6 storeys of Building A.

The additional time required for repainting

19 However, I was mindful that the plaintiff had submitted that extra time was
required in repainting given the following:

(a) An extra 15% time to account for the difficulty of re-painting around
windows and fixtures that had to be protected;

(b) An extra 50% to account for the 50% less manpower that the Plaintiffs
deployed (due to the necessity of continuing with the on-going contract
works);

(c) An extra 10% to account for the Plaintiffs not using scissors lifts when
they had the use of them during the original painting works; and

(d) An extra 10% for the sanding off of the discoloured paint before re-
painting works could start.

20 The defendant disputes item (a) in quantum but not in principle. The
difference in the position taken by the respective parties lies in the fact
that the defendant’s expert allowed for a 10% increase in time “in view of the
difficulties encountered during repainting works due to the installed
mechanical and electrical services”, whereas the plaintiff’s expert found that
20% would be a more realistic cost “resulting from difficulties encountered
due to the need to cut-in around installed mechanical and electrical services,
and the protection to windows”. In its closing submissions, the plaintiff
adopted the middle ground of 15% in its computations. The figure of 15%
appears to have been accepted as a reasonable one by the defendant’s expert in
cross-examination. Taking all the above into account, I accept that the figure
of 15% is not unreasonable.

21 With respect to item (b), I note the plaintiff’s expert witness’s evidence
that the plaintiff had deployed an average of 19.89 workers per month during
the original painting works, and 23 workers per month during the repainting
works. Given that more workers were used on average during the repainting
works than the original painting works, I had difficulty accepting that the
time for repainting would have been extended at all due to shortage of labour,
let alone by such a wide margin as 50%. This is especially since the
repainting work for Building B had been outsourced to Swiss Plan which had
completed all of its sub-contracted works by February 2009. The plaintiff’s
workers only had to repaint 6 storeys of Building A. Based on the foregoing, I
would reject the plaintiffs uplift based on item (b).

22 As for Item (c), the plaintiff is claiming that it took extra time for
repainting due to the lack of a scissors lift, which it used during the
original works. However, the plaintiff additionally claims $81,579.95 for the
“Rental of Portable Scaffolding, Scissors Lift and Boom Lift” for the entire
period of repainting as evidenced by an invoice for the period June 2008 to
September 2009 for “scaffolding, scissor lift and boomlift”. As I have allowed
some claim for extra time on Item (a) and (d), I would make no double counting
arising from the alleged non-use of the scissors lift in the repainting.

23 As for Item (d), the plaintiff has led evidence to show that sanding off
was an additional step required before repainting could take place given that
no sealer coat was applied. Although the defendant challenged whether the
plaintiff did or needed to sand off the entire painted surface, _ie_ ,
specifically the internal surfaces to be repainted, no alternative reasonable
figure was proposed and given that in cross-examination, the defendant’s
witness Chin Cheong appeared to have accepted the sanding-off in principle, I
find that the figure of 10% submitted by the plaintiff is not unreasonable.

24 In the premises, I find that the plaintiff’s claim of 16 months for
repainting was inflated. The claim should be reduced to a figure of
approximately 6.05 months, arising from the following:

4.78 months x 115% x 110% = 6.05 months.

25 The plaintiff is therefore only entitled to recover $238,855.93 for the
salary costs of its workers’ deployed to repaint Building A (_ie_ , 6.05 ÷ 16
x $631,685.09 = $238,855.92).

Dinner for workers

26 The defendant challenges the sum claimed under this head (_ie_ ,
$34,668.00) on largely the same basis as it challenges the amount claimed for
worker’s salary. Given my adopting of a 6.05 months proxy for the completion
of repainting the 6 storeys of Block A, and not the 16 months claimed, I
accordingly reduce the sum claimed proportionately to $13,108.84 , _ie_ ,
$34,668.00 x (6.05 ÷ 16) = $13,108.84.

Foreign Worker Levy

27 Like the other heads of claim, the sum of $63,115 should be reduced
proportionately to $23,865.36 following the application of the 6.05 months
proxy for completion of repainting of Building A, _ie_ , $63,115 x (6.05 ÷ 16)
= $23,865.36.

Consumable tools

28 The plaintiff claims $11,428.35 as the costs incurred to purchase
consumable tools to carry out the repainting works. It has produced receipts
to prove that these costs were incurred. The defendant do not dispute that
these tools were purchased. In similar vein to Item 3, however, it does
challenge whether these tools were purchased _for the purpose of the
repainting works_. Its case is that unless the plaintiff discharges its burden
of showing that these tools were purchased for the purpose of the repainting,
I should only grant nominal damages. It is more likely than not that in the
course of the repainting, consumable tools such as turpentine and brushes
would be required. The plaintiff’s has produced evidence of these tools and
affirmed that these tools were purchased and used in the repainting works.
There is no reason to disbelieve the plaintiff. Absent evidence to the
contrary, the plaintiff has proven its claim under this head.

Upkeep for Vehicle GQ 895L

29 In this item, the plaintiff claims petrol, parking and servicing fees as
upkeep for Vehicle GQ 895L (“the Vehicle”), which it says it used during the
repainting works. The defendant objects to the plaintiff’s claim under this
head on a number of grounds. First, it repeats its point that the plaintiff
should not be awarded damages unless it can show that a particular item was
used solely for the purpose of the repainting works and no other. Second, it
cites the plaintiff’s expert’s belief that a reasonable deduction should be
made to account for the “higher running costs” of using an older vehicle as
compared to a brand new one.

30 As to the first objection, the plaintiff has produced receipts verifying
that it has spent $11,613.78 on petrol, parking and servicing in relation to
the Vehicle. Its factual witness testified that these sums were expended in
relation to the repainting works. I accept that testimony. The defendant has
not adduced any evidence to show that the Vehicle was used for other purposes.
It has not adduced any evidence to show that the expenses were incurred in
relation to a different vehicle. I see no basis for finding that the expenses
or the Vehicle were used for purposes other than the repainting works.

31 As for the second objection, the defendant is entitled to claim damages for
expenses reasonably incurred. I do not think it unreasonable that it should
use its existing company vehicle for the purpose of the repainting works. It
was not obliged to obtain a new vehicle for the purpose. The defendant has
also not quantified how the discount should be applied.

32 What is relevant, however, is the fact that the sum claimed under this head
was incurred over a period of 16 months which should be adjusted to 6.05
months proxy. As such, the plaintiff is awarded:

$11,613.78 x (6.05 ÷ 16) = $4,391.46

Accommodation for workers by AC Creative Pte Ltd and Cheer Keong Contractor &
Construction

33 The plaintiff claims $29,393.20 for accommodation of the workers utilised
for repainting works who could not stay on the site of the building project
after February 2009 when the Building A units were handed back to the main
contractor. As such, the plaintiff claims that alternative accommodation had
to be secured for them with AC Creative Pte Ltd and Cheer Keong Contractor &
Construction for period March to September 2009.

34 The defendant is not challenging the fact that the site was handed back in
February 2009. However, it raises the same objections – first, that the
plaintiff has premised its claim on more man days than actually expended, and
second, that the plaintiff has not proven its case that all the workers living
in the alternative accommodation were used solely for the purpose of the
repainting works.

35 The first objection is valid in light of my allocation of 6.05 months to
repaint 6 storeys of Building A. It is in evidence that Building A was handed
back to the main contractor in February 2009. Whilst only the corridors and
external areas of Building A remained to be repainted, the plaintiff has
produced no evidence to establish the number of workers that he utilised for
this remaining area and the duration of their work and accommodation costs.
Accordingly the plaintiff has not established this head of claim.

Administrative charge

36 The plaintiff claims $16,000 as administrative charges for the additional
time spent by the managing director of the plaintiff and his clerical staff in
the administration of the additional work incurred when repainting became
necessary. The plaintiff submits that $1,000 per month is not unjustified as a
measure of value of this work. It is clear that additional management time
would have had to be deployed for the repainting works. I would accordingly
award $6,050 (_ie_ , 6.05 x 1,000) to the plaintiff.

Rental of Portable Scaffolding, Scissors Lift and Boom Lift

37 The plaintiff has adduced an invoice from Hup Seng Aluminium Construction
Pte Ltd which shows that the Portable Scaffolding, Scissors Lift and Boom Lift
were leased to the plaintiff from 1 June 2008 to 30 September 2009 (16 months)
for $81,579.95.

38 Given my allocation of 6.05 months, I would allow the rental costs for this
duration. This amounts to $30,847.42 (_ie_ , $81,579.95 x 6.05 ÷ 16).

Paint Investigation by Setsco Services Pte Ltd

39 The plaintiff originally made a claim of $10,700 as the costs of engaging
Setsco Services Pte Ltd to prepare a report on the paint supplied by the
defendant. It has since withdrawn its claim for this item, and rightly so, as
this should be considered at the taxation stage and not the assessment of
damages stage. An expert report obtained in view of a dispute that has arisen
is a matter for taxation and not assessment of damages.

Repainting work for project at No. 2 Toh Tuck Link

40 The plaintiff did not proceed with its claim under this head at trial. In
its closing submissions, it confirmed that it was not making a claim for this
item.

GST

41 The plaintiff claims 7% GST of all the Items 1-12 in the table above at
[7]. The defendant has disputed the plaintiff’s entitlement to this. It is
surprising, however, that the plaintiff’s closing submissions and reply
submissions do not address this claim at all. That the plaintiff may have paid
GST on some but not all of the items is clear.

42 The plaintiff has failed to show that GST was paid or payable on several of
the items, _eg_ , workers’ salary and dinner, consumable tools, vehicle
upkeep, administrative charge, foreign worker levies. Whilst other invoices
like the paint and subcontractor invoice did include GST, the plaintiff in
issuing its own invoices for this work to the owner/main contractor would be
able to recover GST thereby, it bearing only the differential burden of value
added. It has provided no evidence of this amount. Accordingly I would
disallow this claim.

Set-off for Defendants’ invoice for paint materials

43 Parties are agreed that the defendant is entitled to a set off for paint
supplied in the sum of $72,676.62. I accordingly apply a deduction.

as follows:

_No._ |  _Description_ |  _Amount_  
---|---|---  
1. |  Worker’s Salary for rectification works |  $238,855.92

Conclusion

45 In the light of my findings above, I award damages of $532,113.48 payable
by the defendant to the plaintiff.

46 The plaintiff shall be entitled to interest on the above amount at the rate
of 5.33% per annum from the date of writ (23 November 2009) until the date of
payment.

47 Costs are to be taxed if not agreed.
