> Ed)._

  
  
**_The facts_ **

****

Mr Koh was the managing director of Auto Asia (S) Pte Ltd (`Auto Asia`). The
company was incorporated on 2 April 1991 and was involved in the business of
selling cars. Mr Koh was the majority shareholder, holding 600,000 shares in
the company. The remaining 450,000 shares were held by his wife, Mdm Constance
Tan Gek Suan.  
  
Sometime in early 1998, Auto Asia secured the exclusive right to sell Kia cars
in Singapore. Actual sales began sometime around June 1998, and Auto Asia
managed to sell about 130 cars by year-end. In January 1999, Auto Asia
launched a sales promotion for Kia Mentor cars, priced at $59,900, inclusive
of the Certificate of Entitlement (`COE`). The COE price for the relevant
category of vehicle at that time was $34,508. A second promotion for Kia
Mentor cars was launched in March 1999, at the price of $66,800.  
  
A large number of orders were received pursuant to the promotions. All
customers who placed an order with Auto Asia were required to pay a booking
fee of $2,000 and a COE deposit of $8,000. Among these customers, were the 12
named in the charges. They did not pay the full $10,000 in cash. Instead, they
made a cash payment of between $2,000 to $5,000 for the booking fee and as
partial payment for the COE deposit, and in addition, deposited either the
log-card or the Preferential Additional Registration Fee (`PARF`) certificate
for their existing vehicle with Auto Asia. The log-cards and PARF certificates
will be referred to collectively as `the vehicle documents`. Each of these 12
customers signed the following form (`the form`):

> _**Re: Pledge of Vehicle Log-Card/Parf Cert as Part Payment for COE Bidding
> Deposit** _

> _I,
> [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar],
> NRIC No [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] of

> difference on the full COE amount bidded and other miscellaneous cost

> Original form was drafted in full caps.]_

  
  
The COE bidding process mentioned in the form, was introduced in May 1990 as a
means of controlling the growth of vehicle population in Singapore. Under the
COE system, a COE must be obtained through a process of competitive bidding
before a vehicle can be registered. When making a bid, 50% of the bid amount
is deducted from the applicant`s bank account as deposit for the application.
This deposit is refunded if the bid is unsuccessful. The bidding is usually
conducted by the Land Transport Authority (`LTA`) from the 1st to the 7th of
each month. Bidding usually closes at 4pm on the 7th of the same month,
whereupon the LTA will announce the lowest successful bid for each category. A
successful bidder needs only pay the lowest successful price (`strike price`),
and not the amount that was actually bid.  
  
Auto Asia`s practice was to secure the COE for its customers, either by
bidding for it on its own or through an agent. This required Auto Asia to pay
the required COE deposit to the LTA. Auto Asia had since July 1994, obtained a
COE financing facility from a finance company called DP Financial Associates
Pte Ltd (`DP`). DP was the sole managing agent for Hitachi Leasing (S) Pte Ltd
(`Hitachi Leasing`) in relation to loans provided by Hitachi Leasing. Under
the facility, Auto Asia would submit a list of customers to DP for whom COEs
were required, and Hitachi Leasing would extend the necessary funding for the
COE deposits through DP.  
  
Sometime in early July 1999, Mr Koh submitted to DP a list of 120 customers
who needed COE bidding. The total amount of credit required for the bidding
was $3,010,050. DP was initially willing to extend only $775,000. When Mr Koh
asked DP for additional financing, they replied that they would do so only if
Mr Koh could provide some security.  
  
Consequently, on 5 July 1999, Mr Koh delivered to DP ten vehicle documents.
Eight of these documents belonged to persons named in the charges. On the
security of these documents, DP sent Mr Koh a cheque for $141,600 on 6 July
1999 made out in Mr Koh`s name.  
  
On 7 July 1999, Mr Koh delivered another six vehicle documents to DP. Four of
these documents belonged to persons named in the charges. DP granted further
credit of $80,000 to Auto Asia on the security of these documents. Mr Koh
requested DP to use this $80,000 to finance COE bidding for three persons.  
  
In the July 1999 COE bidding exercise, DP bid for 58 COEs on behalf of Auto
Asia at the bid price of $50,000. The strike price for that bidding exercise
was $45,876. On 15 July 1999, the LTA issued 58 temporary COEs to DP. Auto
Asia was unable to redeem the COEs from DP due to insufficient funds. Auto
Asia has since August 1999, entered into receivership.  
  
The prosecution brought forth 32 charges of criminal breach of trust and 15
charges of cheating against Mr Koh. At the trial, the prosecution proceeded
with 12 charges of criminal breach of trust. The remaining charges were stood
down pending the outcome of the trial.  
  
**_Decision of the judge_**

****

At the end of the prosecution`s case, the judge found that a prima facie case
had been made out in respect of all the charges, and called for the defence.
Mr Koh elected not to give any evidence and did not call for any witnesses.  
  
The judge found that the vehicle documents had been pledged and that there
were no restrictions against a sub-pledge. There was consequently no
misappropriation. Neither did the judge find any dishonest intent in Mr Koh`s
conduct. The judge was also of the view that the circumstances of the case did
not compel the drawing of an adverse inference against him under s 196(2) of
the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). He was accordingly acquitted.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

Against this decision, the prosecution appealed. Section 409 of the Penal Code
(Cap 224) provides that:

> _Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion
> over property, in his capacity of a public servant, or in the way of his
> business as a banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney or agent, commits
> criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with
> imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
> 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine._

  
  
Section 405 defines `criminal breach of trust` in the following way:

> _Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion
> over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that
> property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of
> any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be
> discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made
> touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person
> to do so, commits `criminal breach of trust`._

  
  
An offence under s 409 of the Penal Code contains three elements. First, an
entrustment of property. Second, misappropriation of the property entrusted.
Third, misappropriation of that property with dishonest intent. The only
elements in dispute were the second and third.  
  
**_Misappropriation of property_**

****

The first issue in the appeal then was whether there was misappropriation of
the vehicle documents. A key point of contention on this issue between Mr
Wong, who appeared for the Public Prosecutor, and Mr Shanmugam SC, counsel for
Mr Koh, was whether the deposit of the vehicle documents with Auto Asia
amounted to a pledge, and if so, whether Mr Koh had the right to in turn sub-
pledge these documents to DP. If as Mr Shanmugam contended, the deposit of
vehicle documents with Auto Asia amounted to a pledge without any restrictions
on a further sub-pledge, the element of misappropriation would not be
satisfied.  
  
**_Existence of a pledge_**

****

Mr Wong`s arguments on this issue were built around the fact that when the
vehicle documents were handed over to Auto Asia, there was at the time no debt
owing by the customers, since no COE had been successfully secured by Auto
Asia on the customers` behalf. In his submission, there cannot be a pledge for
a contingent debt.  
  
In making this argument, he was met by a decision of the Supreme Court of
Victoria in **Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Curlett Cannon and
Galbell Pty Ltd** (Unreported) where Ormiston J said at p 103 after a review
of the authorities that:

> _... a pledge may be constituted by a security for a debt which shall or may
> arise in the future or which has arisen at a time other than that of the
> delivery._

  
  
Mr Wong sought to narrow the propositions laid down by this case, arguing that
it was not authority for the proposition that there can be a pledge for a
contingent debt, and that all that was decided was that where there is a
pledge of a contingent debt, the time of reckoning of priorities may be taken
as the time the goods were deposited, and not the time when the debt
subsequently arose.  
  
With respect to Mr Wong, my reading of **_Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group v Curlett Cannon_** did not bear him out. In that case, the plaintiff
bank had a registered mortgage over the assets of the debtor company Najee
Nominees Pty Ltd (`Najee`). In March 1991, Najee defaulted and the bank
appointed a receiver to take possession of the charged property. The receiver
sought from the defendant customs agent release of three consignments of
clothing. The customs agent refused, claiming that they had a right in
priority by virtue of a pledge, which arose when the bills of lading for the
consignments were delivered to them sometime in February 1991.  
  
Although the bank`s registered mortgage had been granted on 3 September 1985,
it was common ground that the bank`s charge crystallised only upon the
appointment of the receiver on 28 March 1991. It was also undisputed that the
customs agent`s pledge, if it could be so characterised, would have priority
since it came earlier in time. The bank sought to counter this by arguing that
they had priority, because their charge had been registered for the purposes
of the Corporations Law, while the customs agent`s right, which they argued
was a registrable charge, had not been registered. Under the relevant law, the
right would not be a registrable charge if it could be characterised as a
pledge. Therefore, the nature of a pledge was very much at the heart of the
decision, contrary to Mr Wong`s suggestion.  
  
It was in this context that Ormiston J made his ruling. It was argued before
him that each transaction did not constitute a pledge because no debt existed
at the time the bills of lading were deposited; **_Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group v Curlett Cannon_** at p 102. This was his response at p 103:

> _The wide class of obligation which can be secured by a pledge is later
> stated by Story J as follows (para 300) [from**The Law of Bailments** (1878)
> 9th Ed]:_

> _`**It may be delivered as security for a future debt or engagement** , as
> well as for a past debt; for one or for many debts and engagements; upon
> condition, or absolutely; for a limited time, or for an indefinite period.
> It matters not what is the nature of the debt or the engagement. The
> contract of pledge is not confined to an engagement for the payment of
> money; but it is susceptible of being applied to any other lawful contract
> whatever.`_

> _See to the same effect**Cotte on Mortgages** , op cit, Vol II p 1459,
> **Fisher and Lightwood** , op cit, p 108, and **Paton on Bailments** [1952]
> p 358._

> _**These authorities sufficiently show that a pledge may be constituted by a
> security for a debt which shall or may arise in the future** or which has
> arisen at a time other than that of the delivery. [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
He went on at p 103 to apply this statement of law to the facts on hand:

> _Here,**when the bills of lading came into the hands of the customs agent,
> possession of the goods was constructively delivered to them for the
> purposes of a pledge** (as set out in cl 22) and there was either an
> immediate liability and debt created for services thereafter to be performed
> or, **at the least, as soon as those services were performed a debt would
> arise which was of a kind which would support a pledge. The fact that the
> bills were delivered before the debt arose could not deprive the customs
> agents of their agreed rights as pledgee**. [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
It is clear from the above that Ormiston J undertook a considered and
extensive review of the authorities in arriving at his conclusion that there
can be a pledge for a contingent debt. There seems little reason to disagree
with this. The earliest statement of a pledge dates back three centuries, when
Sir John Holt CJ said in **Coggs v Bernard** [1703] 2 Ld Raym 909 at 913 that:

> _... when goods or chattels are delivered to one another as a pawn, to be a
> security to him for money borrowed of him by the bailor; and this is called
> in Latin vadium, and in English a pawn or a pledge._

  
  
As Professor Goode observed in **_Commercial Law_** (2nd Ed) at pp 643-644:

> _... in the early days of the common law, the taking of possession by the
> creditor was almost a**sine qua non** of a valid security interest ... With
> the development of documentary intangibles the scope of the pledge
> increased. It could now be applied not only to goods but also to documents
> of title to goods and to instruments embodying a money obligation. Further
> it was not necessary for the creditor to take or retain physical possession;
> it sufficed that he had constructive possession through a third party or
> even through the debtor himself, a particularly useful rule for banks
> financing the import of goods against a pledge of shipping documents, for
> these could safely be released to the buyer against a trust receipt._

  
  
The scope of a pledge has therefore expanded through the centuries, thereby
ensuring the retention of its utility as a security device with changing
times. The underlying rationale for security interests such as pledges, as
well as liens and mortgages, is to facilitate commerce, and if a pledge for a
contingent debt can serve a useful commercial purpose, and there is no denying
its utility in the COE bidding context for both Auto Asia and their customers,
there seems no reason to unduly confine the pledge to being a security device
for existing debts.  
  
In any event, even if a pledge should be so confined, the vehicle documents,
being deposited as security for the unpaid portion of the required COE deposit
of $8,000 in cash, is a pledge for an existing debt. Thus, Mr Wong`s argument
that there is no pledge for a contingent debt fell either way.  
  
**_Right to sub-pledge_**

****

In the Court of Queen`s Bench`s decision in **Donald v Suckling** [1866] LR 1
QB 585, Mellor J had held that there is no authority for implying a general
term against a sub-pledge to the extent of the pledgee`s interest, unless
prohibited by an express term of the contract. Mr Wong therefore argued that
even if there was a pledge, Mr Koh was prevented from sub-pledging the vehicle
documents to DP because of the restrictive wording of the form. This point can
be dealt with quickly. The form has been reproduced above at [para ] 4. What
Mr Wong relied on was the phrase towards the end of the form which states:

> _Upon successful COE bidding and time of registration, I shall allow Auto
> Asia (S) Pte Ltd to sell or scrap my car/PARF cert and to redeem the amount
> they have paid for the COE bidding._

  
  
However, what this prohibits is the sale of the vehicle document before
successful COE bidding and registration. It does not prohibit a sub-pledge of
the vehicle document before the described event. Mr Wong`s reliance on
**Jaswantrai v State of Bombay** (Unreported) was for this reason misplaced.
In that case, it was clear from the cited portion of the agreement and from
Sinha J`s explanation at p 581 that there were specific prohibitions in the
agreement against dealing with the security until the occurrence of certain
contingencies, namely, failure to maintain the proper margin or default in
repayment. Since none of those contingencies had arisen, the pledgee bank had
no right to deal with the securities by way of a pledge, sub-pledge or
assignment. In sharp contrast with **_Jaswantrai v State of Bombay_** , the
form does not contain any prohibition against sub-pledging.  
  
Mr Wong`s response was to argue that, in any event, the court should not look
only to the express wording of the form, but at the contemplation of the
parties, and that both the customers and the sales staff were of the view that
Auto Asia was not authorised to sub-pledge the vehicle documents. In this,
however, he was confronted by ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97).
Section 93 provides that:

> _When the terms of a contract or of a grant or of any other disposition of
> property have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the form of a
> document ... no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such
> contract, grant or other disposition of property or of such matter except
> the document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which
> secondary evidence is admissible under the provisions of this Act._

  
  
Section 94 goes on to state:

> _When the terms of any such contract, grant or other disposition of
> property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a
> document, have been proved according to section 93, no evidence of any oral
> agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such
> instrument or their representatives in interest for the purpose of
> contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms subject to
> the following provisions ..._

  
  
None of the provisos to s 94 applied to the facts of this case. The
application of s 94 has been considered by the Court of Appeal in **Ng Lay
Choo Marion v Lok Lai Oi** [1995] 3 SLR 221 . There, the court held that where
the alleged terms of the oral agreement are in addition to and therefore
inconsistent with the written contract, that evidence is inadmissible.  
  
Mr Wong sought to strengthen his attempt to bring in parol evidence by arguing
that the court should take a wide approach in criminal proceedings, and look
beyond the true interpretation of the form from a commercial point of view,
and look instead at what the parties understood as the terms of entrustment. I
did not find this argument compelling. The purpose of the general rule against
parol evidence is to ensure that there is at least some modicum of certainty
in commercial transactions. Where criminal liability is involved, there is an
even stronger argument that the legality of parties` actions must be based on
what is certain, as set out in the document, as opposed to being based on the
subjective intention of each party.  
  
It is clear from the above that there was a pledge of the vehicle documents by
the customers with Auto Asia, without any restriction on sub-pledging. Mr Koh
therefore could not be said to be misappropriating the vehicle documents when
he sub-pledged them to DP for financing. Having failed to establish a key
element of the offence, the appeal fell on this ground alone.  
  
**_Dishonest misappropriation_**

****

The second issue in this appeal, that of dishonest misappropriation, would
have arisen only if there was, in the first place, misappropriation of the
vehicle documents. Having found that there was no misappropriation, I did not
find it necessary to go into the question of whether there was any dishonest
misappropriation.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

In light of the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal without calling on Mr
Shanmugam to present the case for Mr Koh.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
