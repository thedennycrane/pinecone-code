**

Held

**, allowing the defendants’ appeal in part:

The basic premise, is to compensate the plaintiff as best as possible for the
loss or damage he suffers by reason of the conversion. The loss or damage
ought, therefore, as far as possible to be determined as at the date of the
conversion because that would be the fairest and most accurate measure. The
plaintiff is obliged to purchase his damaged goods in the market if there is a
market. The plaintiffs’ damages should therefore have been assessed as at the
date of conversion at the rate of 32% of the face value of the notes; that
being the known transacted price for the said notes on that day. The
plaintiffs were also entitled to the quarterly payments but only those due at
the date of the conversion (See 9 – 10, 12).

**Judgment** __

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. This was an appeal by the defendants against the assessment of damages by
the assistant registrar below. The plaintiffs had sued the defendants for
conversion of Central Bank of Nigeria promissory notes ("CBN notes") which
were placed as security with them by the first plaintiffs. The first
plaintiffs were the original owners who subsequently assigned the notes to the
second plaintiffs. The defendants were found liable by the trial judge. The
court held that the second plaintiffs were entitled to damages. The
defendants’ counterclaim was dismissed and costs awarded against them to both
plaintiffs. The judgment was handed down on 17 October 2001 and the
defendants’ appeal to the Court of Appeal was subsequently dismissed. The
conversion was committed on 19 March 2001.

2\. The assistant registrar assessed damages at US$2,380,000.00 as well as
US$839,407.82 (quarterly payments) due under the CBN notes from the date of
conversion to the date of assessment. The assessment was adjudged on 17 July
2002.

3\. Mr Tan submitted on appeal that the assistant registrar was wrong in
assessing the value of the CBN notes as at the date of judgment instead of the
value as at the date of conversion. As an ancillary argument, he submitted
that there was no evidence upon which the assistant registrar would arrive at
the value of 34% of the face value of the notes. Secondly, Mr Tan submitted
that the assistant registrar was wrong to award the quarterly payments to the
second plaintiffs.

4\. A brief account of the CBN notes is useful for a proper understanding of
the nature of this appeal. The Nigerian government issued the CBN notes which
would expire in 2010 and, therefore, by that time the notes would be
valueless. In the meantime, quarterly payments (also referred to as
‘instalment payments’) would be made by the Nigerian government to holders of
the notes. The quarterly payments are at attractive interest rates, and hence,
the notes have a secondary market.

5\. CBN notes owned by the first plaintiffs had a face value of US$7m. These
notes were assigned to the second plaintiffs. Meanwhile the first plaintiffs
offered their CBN notes to the defendants as security in respect of debts
owing to the latter. The defendants sold the CBN notes on 19 March 2001 at 32%
of the face value (the act of conversion). The plaintiffs sued, contending
that the defendants had no right to dispose of the security because by that
time the plaintiffs’ liability to them had been discharged. The trial judge
found in favour of the plaintiffs.

6\. Mr Tan’s main argument before me was that the date for ascertaining
damages was the date of conversion and not the date of judgment, relying on
_McGregor On Damages_ , 16th Ed, page 912. It is clearly acknowledged in this
authoritative text that the market value should be ascertained as at the time
of the conversion. Various authorities were cited as leaning one way or the
other. _Mercer v Jones_ (1825) 1 C&P 625; and _Sachs v Miklos_ [1948] 2 KB 23
in favour of a discretion to assess the market value at the date of judgment.
Mr Sandrasegara referred me to the passage in _Halsbury’s Laws of England_ 618
as follows:-

> > "**Time by reference to which value of goods assessed**. Where damages in
> conversion fall to be awarded according to the value of the goods converted,
> the time by reference to which that value is to be assessed is that time
> which is most appropriate to do justice between the parties and to
> compensate the claimant for the loss sustained. The abolition of the tort of
> detinue does not inhibit the court from granting in conversion a measure of
> damages traditionally granted in detinue, namely the value of the goods at
> the date of judgment, rather than their value at the date of conversion. The
> court’s ability to award damages according to value at the date of judgment
> may either increase or reduce the sum awarded, accordingly to whether the
> market has risen or fallen since the conversion."

7\. Mr Sandrasegara also relied on _IBL Ltd v Coussens_ [1991] 2 AER 133. The
principle which he wished me to consider and apply is set out in the head note
as follows:-

> > "Damages awarded under s 3 of the 1977 Act for conversion as an
> alternative to the return of the goods were not to be arbitrarily assessed
> as at either the date of the conversion or the date of judgment but ought to
> be such as fairly compensated the owner for the loss of the goods, taking
> into account such matters as to whether the owner would have kept the goods
> if they had not been converted, if not, when he would have sold or replaced
> them, if they were kept, whether they had increased in value, and whether
> the owner had suffered damage for loss of use."

He submitted that the cost of the CBN notes had risen from 32% as at the date
of conversion, to 35% as at the date of judgment. He thus argued that the
latter should therefore be the measure of damages.

8\. The _Coussens_ case was decided under the English Tort (Interference With
Goods) Act, 1977. The Act did not, as Neill LJ, observed, give any guidance as
to the date at which the goods is to be assessed. Hence, the Court of Appeal
there reverted to the general principles at Common Law. Neill LJ concurred
with the following passage from the judgment of Brandon LJ in _Brandeis
Goldsmidt & Co v Western Transport Ltd _[1981] QB 864, 870:

> > "Damages in tort are awarded by way of monetary compensation for loss or
> losses which a plaintiff has actually sustained, and the measure of damages
> awarded on this basis may vary infinitely according to the individual
> circumstances of any particular case." [1991] 2 AER 133, 139.

9\. The basic premise, therefore, is to compensate the plaintiff as best as
possible for the loss or damage he suffers by reason of the conversion. The
loss or damage ought, therefore, as far as possible to determine as at the
date of the conversion because that would be the fairest and most accurate
measure. Thus, the courts in England and the Court of Appeal here have applied
the corollary principle that the plaintiff is obliged to purchase his damaged
goods in the market if there is a market. As Karthigesu JA held in _The
Endurance_[1991] 1 SLR 661, 663:-

> > "Where there is a market the charterers are expected to diminish the
> damage by going into the market and buying the water-makers in the market,
> so as to put themselves in the position they would have been if they had not
> suffered any wrong at all. If there is no market for the goods converted,
> the measure of damages would be the cost of replacement and the charterers
> must go to their suppliers to purchase the water-makers so as to put
> themselves in the same position as they would have been if not for the
> conversion. There was no evidence before the judge that there was no market
> for the water-makers."

10\. The last line of the above passage clearly underlined the point that the
burden of proving the absence of showing that there was no market was on the
plaintiff, and, that the plaintiff had to act quickly to diminish his loss. In
the present case, the evidence appears to be to the contrary, namely, that
there was a market. The only reason, it appears, that the plaintiffs did not
go to the market, was that, as Mr Sandrasegara submitted, they wanted to
recover the CBN notes from the defendants. But, if there was a ready market,
the plaintiffs ought to purchase their notes from the market and sue for the
difference in price if any.

11\. I am in full agreement with judicial statements in cases such as _IBL Ltd
v Coussens_ espousing the view that the courts should retain the flexibility
of assessing damages at the date of judgment. But that flexibility must be
exercised as an exception to the rule; to provide relief in circumstances
where the normal rule proves deficient. For example, if the plaintiff is able
to show that he had made reasonable efforts to purchase from the market but,
owing to unforeseen circumstances, was unable to buy within a reasonable time
from the date of conversion. There is no evidence in the present appeal before
me that the normal rule (that damages for conversion be assessed as at the
date of conversion) should not apply.

12\. For the reasons above, the appeal is allowed. The plaintiffs’ damages
should be assessed as at the date of conversion at the rate of 32% of the face
value of the notes; that being the known transacted price for the said notes
on that day. The plaintiffs would also be entitled to such quarterly payments
but only as may be due at the date of the conversion.

13\. The appellants’ appeal against the order to pay the costs of Mr Horne was
dismissed. In my view, the evidence of Mr Horne was necessary for the
assessment. The main appeal before me was essentially on a very narrow issue,
namely whether damages ought to be assessed as at the date of conversion or
the date of judgment. An offer was also made to have the evidence of Mr Horne
agreed but that was not accepted by the appellants.

14\. Finally, I upheld the award of costs by the assistant registrar below,
fixed at $10,000, in favour of the respondents for the assessment of damages.
The costs of the appeal before me was fixed at $5,000 in favour of the
appellant for the main appeal; $500 in favour of the respondent in respect of
the costs of appeal against the award of costs for the attendance of Mr Horne
at the assessment.
