Facts

**

On 12 March 1998, the plaintiff was riding his motor-cycle along Sims Avenue.
There was a collision between the motor-cycle and a motor van driven by the
defendant. The plaintiff suffered injuries. He then issued a writ seeking
damages. The defendant did not deny liability. Interlocutory judgment was
entered by consent. Damages were then assessed by in the aggregate amount of
$329,788. Out of that amount, the court below awarded $16,500.42 for pre-trial
loss of earnings, $183,600 for loss of future earnings and $20,000 for loss of
earning capacity. The defendant appealed.

Held

**, varied the amount of damages for pre-trial and future loss of earnings to
a global sum of $120,000 and no award for loss of earning capacity:

> (1) In this case, the loss of earnings was in respect of past and
> prospective earnings and there can be no additional claim for loss of
> earning capacity. The plaintiff in this case was working before the accident
> and returned to work after the accident and the loss of earnings was known
> and assessable. Accordingly, he was not entitled to additional general

>
> (2) In view of the medical evidence, there was sufficient objective basis to

> to maximize his claim for damages. The defendant’s counsel conceded that
> while the plaintiff suffered "a mild disability", it was not, however, so
> minimal to apply the _de minimus_ doctine. The fair and reasonable loss was
> about 25% (see 11).
>
> (3) As the plaintiff was only 28 years old, the court determined a

**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

__

The decision

__

1\. On 12 March 1998, at about 5 pm the plaintiff was riding his motor-cycle
along Sims Avenue. There was a collision between the motor-cycle and a motor
van driven by the defendant. The plaintiff suffered injuries. He then issued a
writ seeking damages. The defendant did not deny liability. Interlocutory
judgment was entered by consent. Damages remained to be assessed by the
Registrar.

2\. Assessment of damages was done by Ms Tan Wen Shan AR. She awarded general
damages in the aggregate amount of $329,788. The breakdown was as follows :

> 1\. General damages $329,000.00

> (a) fracture of clavicle $ 8,000.00
>
> (b) fracture of scapula $ 6,000.00
>
> (c) fracture of ribs $ 8,000.00
>
> (d) reduced sense of smell $ 10,000.00
>
> (e) scarring and abrasions $ 3,000.00
>
> (f) head injuries $ 90,000.00
>
> (g) loss of future earnings $183,600.00
>
> (h) loss of earning capacity $ 20,000.00
>
> (i) cost of future medical cares $ 1,188.00

3\. Then there were special damages. They were as follows :

> (a) Medical expenses (agreed) $ 7,113.91
>
> (b) Pre-trial transport (agreed) $ 150.00
>
> (c) Pre-trial loss of earnings  
>  from 12 March 1998 to  
>  6 August 1998 $ 8,771.78
>
> (d) Pre-trial eanrings  
>  from 7 August 1998 to  
>  28 December 1999 $ 16,500.42
>
> (e) Taxi fare to and from work  
>  @ $15 per day from 7 August  
>  1998 to 21 May 1999 $ 4,290.00

4\. The defendant appealed against the decision of the Assistant Registrar. I
varied the earnings part of the award of the Assistant Registrar as follows :
1(g), (h) and 2(d) to $120,000.00. I awarded a lump-sum to include the items.

5\. The defendant has filed an appeal against the award of $120,000. I shall
therefore elucidate this item.

__

The law

__

6\. First, the legal principles. A finding on damages differs from an ordinary
finding of fact in that it is generally much more a matter of speculation and
estimate. This statement is true in respect of some cases than of others.
Assessment of general damages, in cases like breach of contract for the sale
of goods, for instance, is largely an objective exercise. Findings in such
cases differ little from any other finding of fact. Assessment of damages for
pain and suffering or wrongs such as slander are almost entirely matter of
impression and of common sense. See _**Davis v Powell Duffryn Associated
Collieries Ltd**_ [1942] AC 601 at 624.

7\. An appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own
for that awarded below because it would have awarded something different if it
had tried the case. An appellate court will intervene only when the Judge, in
assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law; or, short of this,
the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that
it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. _**See Flint v Lovell**_
, [1935] 1 KB 354, _**Davis v Powell**_. This rule, however, does not apply to
an appeal from the Registrar to the Judge-in-Chambers. See _**Chang**_ _**Ah
Lek v Lim Ah Koon**_ [1999] 1 SLR 82. It settled the law that an assessment of
damages which comes on appeal to a Judge-in-Chambers is quite unlike an appeal
from a trial judge to the Court of Appeal. The restrictions that bind the
Court of Appeal do not limit function of the Judge. The Judge addresses the
issues before him and assesses the damages _de novo_. He makes his own
findings based, however, on the evidential material written and collected by
the Registrar and the findings made by him. This is why the Court below is not
required to give reasons for its decision; and the appellant is not required
to state the grounds of appeal enumerating the errors of the Court below.
Additionally points not canvassed before the Registrar may be presented before
the Judge. Nonetheless, his decision must be judicial. Unlike the Registrar,
the Judge must write his reasons if his decision is appealed. Even so, the
Judge-in-Chambers ought not unnecessarily embark on an exercise of tinkering
with the decision of the Court below with the view of fine tuning the
decision. That would demolish the important function of the Court below.

__

Loss of earnings

__

8\. In the case of non-fatal injury cases the injured is entitled to recover
both past and prospective earnings. The date of trial or assessment provide
the dividing line. This bifurcation is important because the multiplier is
determined from the date of trial or assessment without any deduction for the
time before the trial long though it might be. See _**Pritchard v Cobden**_
[1987] 2 WLR 627. In that case Pritchard suffered brain damage in 1976. He
became unable to work because of the injury. The assessment of damages was
done at the trial in 1986. Swinton Thomas J took a multiplier of 14 from the
date of trial and applied a multiplicand of 9,000 per annum. The total loss of
earnings, past and prospective, amounted to 126,000. He rejected a submission
that the multiplier should be reduced by the time elapsed since the accident.
The Court of Appeal affirmed his decision. That decision settled the law that
: damages for loss of earnings of a living plaintiff should continue to be
assessed as special damages for the earnings lost between the date of the
accident and the date of assessment. Calculation of the future loss of
earnings is computed from the date of assessment by selecting an adequate
multiplier for the multiplicand to compensate for the likely loss of earnings
for the remainder of his working life.

__

Discriminating loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity

__

9.(i) The expressions "loss of earnings" and "loss of earning capacity" are
often confused. Sometimes they are user tautologically. In this sense they
encompass past and future loss of ascertainable earnings. The loss may be
total or partial. In either case the loss is attributable to loss or reduction
in earning ability. A claim for damages under this head are relatively easy to
assess because the numbers that work the established formula are readily
available.

(ii) There is another sense to the expression "loss of earning capacity". This
arises when the claimant returns to work without any immediate loss of
earning. There is, however, the risk that in the future he may be at a
disadvantage due to a lingering disability by reason of the injury in getting
another job if he loses the present job. Alternatively he may suffer a pay-cut
in the future on account of the disability. This is sometimes referred to as
handicap in the labour market. In this sense the expression is a term of art.
To justify an award under this head there must be a substantial or real risk
that the plaintiff would lose his present employment during his working life.
If there was such a risk the assessment of damages would depend on the degree
of the risk, the time when the loss of employment might occur and the factors
affecting the plaintiff’s chances of obtaining other employment. See
_**Moeliker v Reyrolle & Co Ltd**_ [1977] 1 WLR 132. _**Low Swee Tong v Liew
Machinery (Pte) Ltd**_ [1993] 3 SLR 89 and _**Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat**_
[1994] 1 SLR 634. A claim under this head is hugely speculative and difficult
to assess. Except when clear evidence is adduced a large amount will not be
given under this category. In any event, a claim under this head cannot arise
where the injured was working before the accident and suffered a permanent
total or partial loss of earnings.

(iii) The two heads are alternative and not cumulative. In the case before me,
as the loss of earnings was in respect of past and prospective earnings there
can be no additional claim for loss of earning capacity in the second sense of
the term. The plaintiff in this case was working before the accident and
returned to work after the accident and the loss of earnings was known and
assessable. Accordingly he was not entitled to additional general damages for
handicap in the future as loss of earning capacity in the second sense of the
expression.

__

The facts

__

10.(i) The claim for loss of earnings due to reduction in earning capacity was
based on the following evidential material.

(ii) Dr Karen Chua of Tan Tock Seng Hospital in a medical report dated 21 May
1999 said that : It is likely that subsequent improvement will be slow and the
likely estimated percentage awarded for permanent disability is 20% (twenty)
percent for his residual high level cognitive impairment.

(iii) Dr Kanwaljit Soin, Orthopaedic Surgeon, an acknowledged expert in her
field, said in a report dated 16 July 1999 on the plaintiff : The patient is a
mechanic but as a result of the injuries sustained from the accident,
especially the fracture of the clavicle, _he is unable to carry heavy
objects_.

(iv) The plaintiff’s own assertion on the matter was : "After the accident, I
could no longer carry or handle heavy objections. The scope of my work is thus
restricted. I also take more time to plan and figure out how to produce more
complicated items. Due to the weakness in my limbs, my speed of work also
slowed down. I became less productive and my employer reduced by pay to $850
with effect from November 1998. Further, after the accident, I could not work
the long hours I used to. I have been advised by Dr Karen Chua to take more
rest and not to strain myself. I feel very tired after usual working hours and
o longer have the stamina to work long hours. I therefore go home after
working hours and rest on Sunday."

(v) The plaintiff’s employer’s evidence on the loss of earnings aspect of the
case was this :

> "The plaintiff has been in the employment of Cheong Hup Engineering Service
> since 1990. He is and has always been employed as a fitter and his job
> involves producing metallic fixtures and items of all shapes and sizes. The
> blue print would be given to him and his job includes planning and figuring
> out how to produce the items. His job therefore involve handling metals of
> various sizes and weight. Besides using machines to cut the metal, various
> tools are also utilised, which of course requires certain amount of
> strength.
>
> Prior to the accident he was drawing an average monthly salary of $2,100.00.
> His basic pay was $1,500.00 before August 1997 and with effect from August
> 1997, his pay was $1,300.00, after a $150.00 increment.
>
> He is very hard working and did overtime work almost every day including
> Sunday. The rate of his overtime pay was 1.5 times the hourly rate of his
> basic pay, for weekdays and 2 times of the same for Sunday.
>
> However, after the road accident on 12.3.98, the plaintiff no longer works
> over time as it is too tiring for him and he needs more rest.
>
> Since the accident, the plaintiff could not lift nor handle heavy objects
> any more. His scope of work is therefore also restricted as compared to the
> scope of work he could do before the said accident happened. Further, since
> the accident, his speed of work also slowed down thus becoming less
> productive. As Cheong Hup Engineering Services is making slim profits and
> profits are dependant on the number of items produced, I have no choice but
> to reduce his basic pay to commensurate his scope of work and productivity.
> Thus, from November 1998, his pay was reduced to $850.000."

The findings : Loss of earning capacity

__

11\. Tan Wen Shan AR who saw the witnesses being cross-examined appears to
have accepted the evidence of the plaintiff and his employer. In my view the
evidence given by them was subjective and should be subjected to scrutiny. In
view of the medical evidence and particularly that of Dr Kanwaljit Soin there
was sufficient objective basis to conclude that the plaintiff’s earning
capacity in the first sense was indeed diminished. The evidence adduced,
however, did not support a drastic loss of 60% ($850 over $2100) as asserted
by the plaintiff. He magnified it to maximize his claim for damages. It was a
case of a plaintiff psychologically opting out of hard work in the hope of
recovering his perceived loss of earnings from the defendant who in fact was
an insurance company . The defendant’s counsel conceded that what the
plaintiff suffered "a mild disability". It was not, however, so minimal to
apply the _de minimus_ doctine. The fair and reasonable loss was about 25%.

__

The multiplier

__

12\. I now turn to the multiplier. As I have already stated this is
ascertained from the date of the trial. In this case it was the date of
assessment. As I heard the matter _de novo_ the starting point for future loss
was the date of my decision. It is to be borne in mind that the time that
elapsed from the date of accident to the date of my decision was not too long
for the defendant to grouse about. As the plaintiff was only 28 years old I
determined a multiplier of 18 years. This accorded with the current trend in
relation to a healthy young man.

__

The Malaysian factor

__

13\. It was contended that as the plaintiff was a Malaysian he could not work
in Singapore indefinitely. When considering this matter I noted that the
plaintiff was not an unskilled labourer confined to work at a construction
site. He had acquired a specialised skill for which there would always be a
need in Singapore. Additionally, his employer could not find an equally
skilled replacement during his absence. The probabilities were that Singapore
would hold out a job for him. In this regard I shared the view of Judith
Prakash J in _**Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon**_ [1996] 3 SLR 513 where she
took judicial notice of the fact that a Malaysian construction worker in
Singapore would continue to work here for a good length of time. A skilled
worker has a better future than a construction worker in Singapore.

__

The multiplicand

__

14\. Finally, the multiplicand. The plaintiff’s case was that before the
accident he earned an average of $2,100 per month. This was supported by
Inland Revenue Authority document for the Year of Assessment 1998. His
earnings for the whole year 1997 was $21,629.65. This amount had two
components : First half : $8,988.40. Second half : $12,640.60. The average
monthly income for the period July to December, therefore, was $2,106.77
($12,640.60 6). This was independent and uncontroverted evidence. In view of
this it was very probable and reasonable that his monthly earning at the time
of accident was $2,100. This was number applied to calculate the earnings
before the plaintiff returned to work on 7 August 1998. The plaintiff’s
employer was not a large organisation with an accounting staff. It was not
surprising that there was not much documentation evidencing all the moneys his
employer paid him. For this reason, the tax return was adequate proof of the
plaintiff’s earning before the accident. For the future the plaintiff’s
earnings, if anything, would only go up in the ordinary nature of things. The
plaintiff contended for a loss of $1,250 per month. For reasons already stated
this could not be sustained on an objective basis. In keeping with an estimate
of 25% loss of ability I decided on an estimated monthly loss of $500. That
was the amount I used in calculating his past and future loss of earnings
after he returned to work. That was the most reasonable basis in the special
circumstances of this case.

15\. Those numbers gave these amounts :

> Pre-assessment loss of  
>  Earnings from 7.8.98 to  
>  26.5.2000 (22 months) $ 11,500.00
>
> Prospective loss of  
>  earnings 18 x 12 x $500 _$108,000.00_  
>  Total : _$119,000.00_

16\. As the assessment of past and future earnings or loss of earning capacity
in the first sense of that expression involved estimates I rounded the
aggregate amount to $120,000. It was a global approach to derive a just
result.
