Judith Prakash J:

1 This action, Suit No 955 of 2010 (“Suit 955”) is related to, and to some
extent, its outcome depends on the outcome of, Suit No 314 of 2011 (“Suit
314”). I heard both actions together on the basis that the evidence adduced in
one trial was to be admitted as evidence in the other trial.

2 The plaintiffs in both actions are the same – they are four individuals and
two companies which carry on business as a partnership operating the
restaurant known as “Ku De Ta” in Bali, Indonesia.

3 In Suit 314, the defendant is Nine Squares Pty Ltd (“Nine Squares”), an
Australian company. It is the registered owner of two trade marks in Singapore
bearing the name “KU DE TA” (collectively “the Singapore Marks”). The
plaintiffs’ claim in Suit 314 is for either:

(a) a declaration that the Singapore Marks are held on trust for and should be
transferred to the plaintiffs; or

(b) an invalidation of the Singapore Marks.

4 In Suit 955, the plaintiffs’ action is against Ku de Ta SG Pte Ltd
(“KDTSG”), the company which operates the restaurant cum bar/ lounge/ club at
the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands, styled as “Ku De Ta”. The plaintiffs have two
causes of actions against KDTSG: the first is under s 55 of the Trade Marks
Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) and the second is in passing off. The plaintiffs
seek the following main reliefs:

(a) orders enjoining KDTSG from using the name / mark “Ku De Ta”;

(b) damages, to be assessed; and

(c) further and/or in the alternative, an account by KDTSG to the plaintiffs
of profits made by KDTSG from the use of the name / mark “Ku De Ta”, and
payment by KDTSG to the plaintiffs of all sums found due upon the taking of
such account.

5 KDTSG bases its use of the “Ku De Ta” name on a licence agreement dated 29
June 2009 (“the Licence Agreement”) between Nine Squares, the registered owner
of the Singapore Marks, and one Chris Au, under which Nine Squares licensed to
Chris Au the use of one of the Singapore Marks within Singapore. Chris Au
assigned his rights under the Licence Agreement to KDTSG with effect from 10
September 2009 by way of a deed of assignment dated 23 November 2009.

6 In their closing submissions in Suit 955, the plaintiffs accept that if
their action in Suit 314 is dismissed, they would have no basis on which to
proceed with their action in Suit 955. By my judgment in Suit 314 dated 18
November 2013, I dismissed all the plaintiffs’ claims therein. Accordingly,
this action must also be dismissed. I will hear the parties on costs.
