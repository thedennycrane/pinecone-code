** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. This was an appeal by the plaintiffs and a cross-appeal by the defendants,
against the decision of the Assistant Registrar. The Assistant Registrar had
refused the plaintiffs’ application for discovery but had granted leave to the
plaintiffs to administer Interrogatories on the first defendant. After hearing
the arguments, I allowed both the plaintiffs’ and the defendants’ appeals. The
first defendant and the plaintiffs have now appealed against my decision (in
Civil Appeals No. 600143/2001 and No. 600144/2001 respectively).

_

  
Background

_

2\. The plaintiffs are part of the **Fila** Group of Companies which are well-
known manufacturers and retailers of sports apparel and footwear. The
plaintiffs are the proprietors of the following registered trademarks in
Singapore:

(i) TM No. B77477 (**FILA** logo) in Class 25 in respect of "sports clothing,
stockings and shoes"; and

(ii) TM No. 81702 (**FILA** [stylised]) in Class 25 in respect of "articles of
sports clothings, stockings and shoes" (hereafter collectively referred to as
the ‘trade marks’).

The first defendant is the sole-proprietor of PT International Corporation.
The second defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore, of which the
first defendant is a director and a majority shareholder, holding 90,000 of
the 100,000 paid-up shares in the company. Both defendants share the same
office premises at 102F, Pasir Panjang Road #06-07, Citilink Warehouse
Complex, Singapore 118530.

3\. The plaintiffs took out this Originating Summons requesting for pre-action
discovery and Interrogatories with a view to commencing an action against the
first and second defendants for trade-mark infringement. In the affidavit in
support of the application, the plaintiffs' representative stated that more
than 70,000 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style sandals bearing counterfeits of the
**FILA** and **FILA** logo trade-marks had been seized pursuant to various
raids conducted in Italy. Six container loads of FILA Eurojogger-style sports
shoes bearing counterfeits of the **FILA** and **FILA** logo trade-marks had
also been seized during a raid in Sweden. The plaintiffs alleged that the
counterfeit FILA Tomaia-style sandals and FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes
were imported into Italy and Sweden by a Swiss company known as Dieseel GmbH
(Dieseel). Dieseel informed the plaintiffs that the counterfeit products had
been obtained from the defendants; a copy of an invoice together with shipping
documents were annexed to the affidavit in support of this allegation. The
invoice, which was issued by PT International Corporation and addressed to
Dieseel, showed that 57,600 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style sandals were shipped
from Singapore to Genoa, Italy by the first defendant.

4\. In prayers 1 and 3 of the application, the plaintiffs requested the first
and second defendants to each file an affidavit stating whether the following
documents are or have been in their possession, custody or power and, if not
now in their possession, custody or power, when they had parted with the same
and what had become of them:

(a) purchase orders, invoices, delivery order, receipts or any other documents
relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-
style sports shoes and/or any products bearing the word **FILA** or the "F"
device (FILA products) by the defendants to Dieseel GmbH;

(b) correspondence between the defendants and Dieseel GmbH relating to the
sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports
shoes and/or other FILA products;

(c) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other
documents relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA
Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products by the defendants
to any other parties, apart from Dieseel GmbH;

(d) correspondence between the defendants and any other parties (apart from
Dieseel GmbH) relating to the sale and supply by the defendants of FILA
Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA
products;

(e) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other
documents relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA
Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products from the
defendants or vice versa;

(f) correspondence between the first defendant and the second defendant
relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-
style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products;

(g) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other
documents relating to the purchase, procurement or acquisition by the
defendants of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes
and/or any other FILA products;

(h) correspondence between the defendants and their supplier/s relating to the
purchase, procurement or acquisition by the defendants of FILA Tomaia-style
sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products.

5\. The plaintiffs applied in prayers 2 and 4 for an order that the defendants
allow them within 14 days from the date of the order, to inspect the originals
or copies of the above documents and to make copies thereof.

6\. In prayers 5 and 7 of the application, the plaintiffs applied for leave to
administer the following Interrogatories to the first and second defendants
before the commencement of proceedings:

(1) Have you ever had any business dealings with a Swiss company known by the
name of Dieseel GmbH?

(2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative:-

> (a) state in detail how you came to know Dieseel GmbH;
>
> (b) name the individual/s in your business who deals with Dieseel GmbH;
>
> (c) name the individual/s in Dieseel GmbH who dealt with the individual/s in
> your business:
>
> (d) state whether you at any time sold or supplied to Dieseel GmbH FILA
> Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other
> FILA products?

(3) Did you at any time sell or supply FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA
Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products to any other
party?

(4) If the answer to (3) is in the affirmative:-

> (a) state in detail how you came to know the party identified in you answer
> to question (3) above;
>
> (b) name the individual/s in your business who deals with the party
> identified in your answer to question (e) above;
>
> (c) name the individual/s in the party identified in your answer to question
> (3) above who dealt with the individual/s in your business:

(5) Who did you obtain the FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA Eurojogger-
style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products from?

(6) State in detail how you came to know the party or parties identified in
(5) above;

(7) Name the individual/s in your business who dealt with the party or parties
identified in (5) above; and

(8) Name the individual/s in the party or parties identified in (5) above with
whom you dealt with.

7\. The plaintiffs applied in prayers 8 and 9 for an order that the defendants
answer the Interrogatories set out above and for leave to be granted to the
plaintiffs to use the documents and/or information disclosed pursuant to the
orders against the defendants. __

  
The decision below

8\. The Assistant Registrar refused to grant an order for discovery of the
documents set out above, but leave was granted to administer Interrogatories
in para 6(1) and (2) to the first defendant before the commencement of
proceedings. The first defendant was ordered to answer the Interrogatories and
file and serve the Answers on the plaintiffs within 14 days of the order. The
Assistant Registrar did not grant leave to the plaintiffs to administer
Interrogatories to the second defendant.

9\. The plaintiffs appealed against the Assistant Registrar’s decision in
refusing to grant an order for discovery, in not allowing Interrogatories set
out in para 6(3) to (8) to be administered to the first defendant and, in not
granting leave to administer Interrogatories to the second defendant.
Conversely, the defendants appealed against the decision to grant leave to
administer the Interrogatories set out in para 6(1) and (2) above.

_

  
Order for discovery

_

10\. Before me, counsel for the defendants submitted that there was a real
likelihood that the disclosure as requested by the plaintiffs would expose the
defendants to prosecution under s 49 of the Trade Marks Act Cap 332 (the Act).
It is well-established in Singapore that the privilege against self-
incrimination applies to pre-trial discovery and is not abrogated or affected
by s 134 of the Evidence Act Cap 97; (see _Riedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang_
[1989] SLR 460, _Guccio Gucci SpA v Sukhdav Singh_ [1992] 1 SLR 553, _Lee Thin
Tuan v Louis Vuitton_ [1992] 2 SLR 273). A defendant will be entitled to rely
on the privilege if there is a real or appreciable risk that incriminating
answers will expose the defendant to arrest or prosecution for any criminal
offences (_Riedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang_). Section 49 of the Act
states:-

> Any person who –
>
> (a) ………………
>
> (b) sells or exposes for sale; or
>
> (c) ………………

> Any goods to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied shall, unless
> he proves that –
>
> (i) having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence
> under this section, he had, at the time of the commission of the alleged
> offence, no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark and on demand made
> by or on behalf of the prosecution, he gave all the information in his power
> with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods; or
>
> (ii) he had acted innocently,
>
> be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not
> exceeding $10,000 for each goods or thing to which the trade mark is falsely
> applied (but not exceeding in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for
> a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

11\. Counsel for the plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that the defendants
were not entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, as the
privilege has been abrogated by s 134 of the Evidence Act and that the line of
authorities established by _Riedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang_ should not be
followed. Counsel for the plaintiffs cited authorities from Malaysia (see
_Television Broadcasts Ltd v Mandarin Video Holdings Sdn Bhd_ [1983] 2 MLJ 346
_; AG of Hong Kong v Zauyah Wan Chik And Others_ [1995] 2 MLJ 620) and India,
which held that the privilege against self-incrimination had been abrogated by
their equivalent to our s 134 of the Evidence Act. Counsel also drew the
court's attention to the position in England where (arising from the House of
Lords' decision in _Rank Film Distributions Ltd v Video Information Centre &
Others_ [1982] AC 380 which decision our courts followed), the privilege had
been statutorily withdrawn in intellectual property matters (by virtue of s 72
of the Supreme Court Act 1981) and where the privilege had been criticised in
the context of civil proceedings. Section 134 of the Evidence Act states: -

> (1) A witness shall not be excused from answering any question as to any
> matter relevant to the matter in issue in any suit, or in any civil or
> criminal proceeding, upon the ground that the answer to such question will
> criminate, or may tend, directly or indirectly, to criminate, such witness,
> or that it will expose, or tend, directly or indirectly, to expose, such
> witness to a penalty or forfeiture of any kind, or that it will establish or
> tend to establish that he owes a debt or is otherwise subject to a civil
> suit at the instance of the Government or of any other person.
>
> (2) No answer which a witness shall be compelled by the court to give shall
> subject him to any arrest or prosecution, or be proved against him in any
> criminal proceeding, except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such
> answer.
>
> (3) Before compelling a witness to answer a question the answer to which
> will criminate or may tend, directly or indirectly, to criminate such
> witness, the court shall explain to the witness the purport of subsection
> (2).

12\. The first defendant had admitted in his affidavit that the goods as
disclosed in the shipping documents were supplied to Dieseel by him, but
claimed he honestly believed those goods were genuine. The first defendant
stated in his affidavit that he was claiming the privilege against self-
incrimination, as he had been advised by his solicitors that to reveal any
particulars of transactions relating to the allegedly counterfeit FILA goods
would expose him to a real risk of being prosecuted for offences under the
Act. The second defendant stated in its affidavit that it did not deal with
Dieseel in respect of the sale of the allegedly counterfeit FILA goods and
also claimed the privilege against self-incrimination.

13 I was of the opinion that the first defendant was _not_ entitled to rely on
the privilege against self-incrimination. This was because he had admitted
that he supplied the goods to Dieseel as disclosed in the shipping documents;
he had already incriminated himself. Apart from his admission, the invoice
clearly showed that the first defendant had apparently supplied 57,600 pairs
of FILA Tomaia-style sandals to Dieseel. Consequently, the first defendant
could not claim the privilege in any event.

14\. In respect of the second defendant, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted
(as an alternative to the submission that the privilege had been abrogated in
Singapore), that the privilege against self-incrimination was not available to
a company. Reliance was placed on Australian and American authorities, which
held that the privilege only applied to natural persons and did not extend to
incorporated companies. There was no necessity in this regard to determine
whether in Singapore the privilege against self-incrimination could be relied
on by companies since, there was no basis for an order of discovery to be made
against the second defendant in the first place. I was however inclined to
accept the argument of counsel for the plaintiffs that a company is not
entitled to claim privilege under s 134 of the Act, based on the strict
wording of subsections (1), (2) and (3). I note in this regard that none of
the authorities cited by counsel for the defendants (para 10 supra) involved
companies but individuals as defendants. Even so, the second defendant in its
affidavit had denied any involvement with Dieseel in respect of the sale of
the allegedly counterfeit FILA goods; this was not disputed by the plaintiffs.
There was also no evidence to suggest that the second defendant was involved
in the supply of FILA goods to Dieseel.

15\. Consequently, I made the following orders for discovery:

> 1\. That the first defendant do within seven (7) days from the date of the
> order make and file an affidavit stating whether any of the following
> documents are or at any time have been in his possession, custody or power
> and, if not now in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with the
> same and what has become of them:-
>

>> purchase orders, invoices, delivery order, receipts or any other documents
relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA
Eurojogger-style sports shoes by the first Defendant to Dieseel GmbH,
restricted to the approximately 70,000 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style sandals
seized in Italy and the six container loads of FILA Eurojogger-style sports
shoes seized in Sweden.

>
> 2\. That the first defendant do within fourteen (14) days from the date of
> the order allow the plaintiffs to inspect the originals (or copies, if
> originals are not available) of all documents disclosed pursuant to (1)
> above and to allow the plaintiffs to make copies thereof.

_

  
Interrogatories

_

16\. Counsel for the first defendant submitted that the Interrogatories in
para 6(1) and (2)(a) to (d) were irrelevant as they concerned matters which
were not part of a potential civil action and, that the questions were the
plaintiffs’ attempt to obtain information for the purposes of criminal
proceedings. In particular, counsel contended, the Interrogatory in (1) was
unnecessary since the first defendant had already confirmed that it had
supplied the goods disclosed in the shipping documents to Dieseel. Counsel
claimed that as question (2)(d) was an attempt to uncover past acts of
infringement by the first defendant, the first defendant was entitled to rely
on the privilege against self-incrimination.

17\. I was of the opinion that the Interrogatories allowed below should be
administered to _both_ and not only to the first, defendants. This was because
the invoice and the shipping documents clearly showed that the first defendant
had indeed dealt with Dieseel and, the first defendant was a director and a
majority shareholder of the second defendant which shared premises with the
first defendant. However, under O 26A r 2 of the Rules of Court, it was not
necessary at this preliminary stage for Interrogatories (2)(a) to (c) to be
administered to the first defendant – the plaintiffs can always re-apply for
the same Interrogatories to be administered to the first defendant at or after
the discovery stage, once action has been commenced.

18 At the conclusion of the hearing, I allowed the plaintiffs to administer
the following Interrogatories to both defendants before commencement of
proceedings:

(1) Have you ever had any business dealings with a Swiss company known by the
name of Dieseel GmbH?

(2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative, state whether you have sold or
supplied to Diseel GmbH FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA Eurojogger-style
sports shoes which form part of the goods seized by the plaintiffs in Italy
and in Sweden.

to be answered within 14 days of the date of the order.

19\. Interrogatory 2 above was a revised and restricted version of the
original Interrogatory 2(d) the plaintiffs had applied to administer to both
defendants. I had limited the scope of the question to those goods the
plaintiffs had already seized in Italy and Sweden, instead of allowing the
plaintiffs to obtain information generally on whether the defendants had
sold/supplied to Diseel _'any/or any other FILA products_ '. I was of the view
that Interrogatories should not be used by trade-mark proprietors as a _carte
blanche_ to obtain any information they chose, as a substitute (and an easy
one at that) for their own investigations into possible infringement of their
trade-marks/trade-names and above all, the procedure should not be misused to
shift the burden of disproving the infringement, onto the other party
resisting the application.
