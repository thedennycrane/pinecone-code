**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

__The claim__

1\. Admiralty in Rem No 774 of 1998 and In Rem Suit no 773 of 1998 were
isochrorous actions. This judgment arises from the former.

2\. This action was brought against the ship or vessel "VIRGO I" ex "KAPITAN
VOLOSHIN" of the Port of Belize.

3\. Belize is the main port in the small Central American state called Belize.
Formerly it was British Honduras. It remains within the Commonwealth. Its laws
are based on the British System. It has an open ship registry. In general
vessels owned by foreigners may be registered at its port and fly its flag.

4\. The action was brought by its crew to recover wages and other benefits.
The crew were all Lithuanians.

5\. The action was filed on 18 November 1998. The vessel was arrested the same
day.

6\. Singapore Technologies Marine Ltd ("ST Marine") had a claim against the
vessel. ST Marine had claims against the vessel for repairs, goods supplied
and services rendered at their shipyard at Tuas. They asserted that they did
so at the request of "the defendants, their servants or agents". In order to
protect their interest ST Marine obtained leave and entered appearance as
interveners. At the time of arrest the vessel was moored at the shipyard of ST
Marine.

7\. No appearance was entered by the owners of the vessels. So on 15 December
1998 the crew filed a notice of motion for judgment in default of appearance.
The ship-master of the vessel made and filed an affidavit in support of the
application for default judgment. The master exhibited a copy of his contract
followed by copies of the relevant signed pages of the other plaintiffs’
contracts with the defendants. The contracting party on the shipowners’ side
in each cases was TRANSFLOT KLAIPEDA. The master exhibited several salary
sheets bearing this stamp : M.V. "VIRGO I", BELIZE CITY, REGISTRATION NO.
019831150. The master’s signature appeared on the salary sheets.

8\. On 13 January 1999, the master filed a supplementary affidavit. In this he
stated that Falkland Investments SA were the owners of the "VIRGO I". He
exhibited a letter of authorisation addressed to Klaipeda Transflot Fleet. It
made reference to M/V KAPITAN VOLOSHIN later to be renamed "VIRGO I". He
further confirmed that Tranflot Kkaipeda represented the plaintiffs (the crew)
and recruited them for Falkland.

9\. In April 1999 Bankassure Insurance Services Ltd and Aon Group Limited
("the insurers") filed an action in personam (Suit No 609 of 1999) against
Falkland Investments Ltd. The statement of claim asserted that Falkland "were
the mortgagees in possession and/or the registered owners of the VIRGO I and
KAY" and that the insurers placed or effected insurances for crew liability
and port risk for Fakland’s VIRGO I and KAY. They obtained default judgment
against Falkland for about US$134,000 ON 25 May 1999. In an affidavit the
insurers exhibited many debit notes from 30 December 1997 to 15 December 1998
having Falkland Investments Ltd as the assured. The debit notes were in
respect of the VIRGO I and the KAY. The insurers obtained a stop order against
the proceeds of the sale of the VIRGO I to protect the judgment they had
obtained.

10\. On 15 January 1999, Mr Lee Sieu Kin JC granted judgment for the
plaintiffs. In the meantime on 29 December 1998 the vessels were ordered to be
appraised and sold.

11\. In the event, the "VIRGO I" was sold for S$3,910,000. The price was below
the appraised value of the vessel.

12\. In the meantime on 12 February 1998 ST Marine too had obtained judgment
in default of appearance in Admiralty in Rem No 854 of 1998. ST Marine filed
an affidavit exhibiting an invoice which stated owner’s name as Falkland
Investments Ltd.

Owners enter the stage

13\. On 19 June 1999 Falkland Investments Ltd applied by summons in chambers
to enter an appearance as defendants. Leave was necessary because judgment had
already been entered. In support of the application legal counsel for Falkland
Investments Ltd filed an affidavit. It exhibited the provisional registration
certificate issued at the Belize ship registry "evidencing the fact that
Falkland Investments Ltd were owners of the vessel". It was issued on 28 July
1998. He further exhibited an agreement dated 16 January 1998 evidencing the
"transfer of ownership of the KAPITAN VOLOSHIN from Vladivostock Base of
Trawling and Refrigeratory Fleet to Falkland Investments Ltd upon the signing
of the agreement".

14\. Lawyers, who acting on behalf of the crew filed affidavits by the master
asserting that Falkland Investments Ltd were the owners of the "VIRGO I", now
opposed the application of Falkland Investments Ltd to enter an appearance.
They now appeared on behalf of Vladivostock Base of Trawling and Refrigeratory
Fleet ("VBTRF"). In the event of Falkland Investments Ltd obtained an order to
enter an appearance. This was made by Mr Tay Yong Kwang JC on 21 July 1999. He
made a qualified order, but eminently sensible order. It read as follows :

> "1. [Falkland] be at liberty to enter an appearance as defendants in this
> action.
>
> 2\. This order does not determine the issue as to who is the true owner of
> the vessel and therefore the proceeds of sale.
>
> 3\. [VBTRF] is to take out an application to enter an appearance or to
> intervene in this action within 3 weeks from the date hereof together with
> supporting affidavits.
>
> 4\. No application for payment out of the balance of the proceeds of sale be
> taken out by [Falkland] until after 3 weeks from the date hereof or until
> further order.
>
> 5\. Costs of the appeal be reserved."

15\. Armed with the order Falkland Investments Ltd on 28 July 1999 entered an
appearance as owners. On 17 August 1999 filed a Notice of Motion No 251 of
1999 for payment to them or their solicitors the balance of the proceeds of
the sale of the "VIRGO I".

16\. In the meantime VBTRF intervened in the proceedings.

17\. The next significant development was the filing of Notice of Motion No
288 of 1999. It was filed on 27 September 1999 by VBTRF. By that application
VBTRF sought the following orders :

> "(1) the determination of the issue of the validity and enforceability of
> the purported Agreement dated 16 January 1998 allegedly made between
> [Falkland] and [VBTRF] be reserved and remitted to the Primorskiy Krai
> Arbitration Court; and that until such final determination thereof all
> further proceedings herein are to be stayed;
>
> (2) alternatively, that the purported Agreement dated 16 January 1998
> allegedly made between [Falkland] and [VBTRF] be declared null and void and
> to have been of no effect whatsoever;and that [VBTRF] be substituted as the
> owners of the ship or vessel ‘Virgo I’ (previously known as the ‘Kapitan
> Voloshin’) [as] the defendants herein in place of ‘[Falkland]’; and
>
> (3) the costs of these proceedings and this application be taxed and paid by
> [Falkland] to [VBTRF]."

18\. This was two months after Mr Tay Yong Kwang JC made the order granting
leave to Falkland Investments Ltd to enter an appearance as owners. At this
time VBTRF was in the hands of liquidators in Russia.

19\. Originally Notice of Motion 288 of 1999 came up for hearing on 15 October
1999. On that day VBTRF had not filed any affidavit in support of their
application. They were still casting about. So it was adjourned.

20\. Notice of Motion 288 of 1999 came up for hearing on 23 February 2000.
There was no hearing, however. This was because VBTRF had failed to comply
with an order for security against them. The hearing was adjourned to 27 April
2000\. Once again there was no hearing. The hearing was adjourned to 26 May
2000.

21\. On 26 May 2000 the Notice of Motion 288 of 1999 came up for hearing
before me. Once again there was no hearing on the issues. It was adjourned to
20 May 2000.

22\. Finally, I heard the Notice of Motion 288 of 1999 on 30 June and 3 July
2000. By then more than one year had expired since VBTRF came on the scene in
June 1999 opposing Falkland’s application to enter appearance as owners.

23\. After hearing arguments I denied the motion. I shall now give my reasons.

24\. The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court is based on an International
Convention – that is the Brussels Convention. Under the High Court (Admiralty
Jurisdiction) Act, the High Court has in rem jurisdiction over foreign vessels
in respect of a wide range of maritime matters. Such jurisdiction is based on
reciprocity among maritime nations to assist each other in respect of maritime
matters.

25\. It is in keeping with that spirit and letter that the Singapore High
Court allowed and caused the arrest of the "VIRGO I". The arrest was done on
the basis of the vessel belonged to the Port of Belize. The master and crew
invoked the jurisdiction on the basis that the vessel belonged to the Port of
Belize and her owners were Falkland Investments Ltd. The ship entered
Singapore showing the flag of Belize.

26\. ST Marine supplied goods and rendered services and later instituted
admiralty in rem action on the assertion that Falkland Investments Ltd were
the owners of the "VIRGO I". Singapore exercised in rem jurisdiction over the
ship on the basis that Falkland Investments Ltd were the owners. It would be
wholly incongruous, if at all possible, now to relinquish the jurisdiction
after the sale. The sale proceeds are in Singapore subject to the adjudicating
power of the Court that arrested and sold the ship. I did not think that I had
power to transfer the proceedings or stay the proceedings after the Singapore
High Court has given two judgments (one for the crew and the other for ST
Marine) and made payments out of the proceeds in respect of liabilities
incurred by Falkland Investments Ltd. If Falkland Investments Ltd says that
the moneys in the High Court belong to them it is the responsibility of this
court to adjudicate on it and not leave the matter to be decided by another
Court in another land. If I were to relinquish the case at this last stage it
would shatter the confidence which the nations of the world have in our
administration of justice.

27\. The dismissal of the second prayer follows from the dismissal of the
first prayer. Mr Tay Yong Kwang JC had already given leave to Falkland
Investments Ltd to enter an appearance as owner. There was no appeal against
that order. It must stand. Pursuant to direction given by Mr Tay Yong Kwang
JC, VBTRF intervened in the action and entered an appearance as interveners.
The nett effect and result of that was to afford every reasonable opportunity
to be heard. Falkland Investments Ltd had to establish their entitlement to
the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the ship. VBTRF had the right to
contest the claim of Falkland Investments Ltd. VBTRF would have the
opportunity to be heard in the application for payment out by Falkland
Investments Ltd. VBTRF’s application was unnecessary in the circumstances. It
was a side wind. VBTRF should take the bull by the horn and not pull it by the
tail. Accordingly I denied it.
