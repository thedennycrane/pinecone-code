**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

_**

Introduction**_

1\. These two appeals before us cap a long and acrimonious dispute relating to
the division of matrimonial assets of a former married couple, Mr Chia Shih
Ching James (‘Chia’) and Ms Kay Swee Tuan (‘Kay’), upon the dissolution of
their marriage. On 9 September 2000, the District Court made an order for the
division of matrimonial assets between them. Being dissatisfied with the
decision, both parties appealed to the High Court which dismissed both their
appeals. Against the decision of the High Court, both parties now appeal.

_**

  
Background

**_

2\. Chia and Kay are both advocates and solicitors. They started their
courtship in 1977. In 1978, Kay set up her legal practice under the name and
style of S T Kay & Co. Chia was then the head of the legal department in the
Inland Revenue Department. In 1981, while still working there, Chia was
charged with and was convicted of the offence of cheating under s 420 of the
Penal Code. He was sentenced to one day’s imprisonment and was fined $3,000.
Subsequently, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him by the Law
Society of Singapore, and in September 1984 he was ordered by the High Court
to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. In June 1985, however,
the order was set aside by the Privy Council on appeal on jurisdictional
grounds: see _Chia Shih Ching James v Law Society of Singapore_ [1984-1985]
SLR 53.

3\. Kay stood by Chia during those difficult times, providing emotional, moral
and probably financial support. It was therefore no surprise that they were
married on 27 July 1983, while Chia was still facing serous problems in his
legal career. At that time, Chia’s service with the Inland Revenue Department
had been terminated and he was apparently without a job. The disciplinary
proceedings against him were still pending. After his successful appeal before
the Privy Council, Chia joined Kay in her law firm of S T Kay & Co and was
made an equal partner of Kay in the firm without any payment. They remained as
partners until June 1998, when following the breakdown of their marriage, Chia
left the firm and set up a separate firm of his own.

4\. Whilst Chia and Kay were together in their legal practice, Chia handled
the litigation business and was in charge of the accounts of the firm of ST
Kay & Co, and Kay handled the corporate and conveyancing aspects of the
practice. Kay was also actively engaged in business, spending a lot of time on
her numerous business interests, both locally and abroad. She was a director
of many companies, and in some of these she took on executive or managerial
roles. In particular, from late 1980 to early 1990, Kay was an executive
director of a Malaysian public company, Insas Bhd (‘Insas’), whose shares are
quoted on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. Chia and Kay appeared to complement
each other well on the professional and business sides; they did well in their
legal and other businesses. In the course of their long marriage of nearly 15
years (prior to the breakdown), they amassed substantial assets either in
their joint names or singly in his or her own name. Apart from the matrimonial
home, 5 Tanglin Hill, which is jointly owned by both of them, each party has
his or her own car, CPF monies, bank accounts, club memberships and other
assets.

5\. The couple have two sons, aged 15 and 11 respectively. The marriage began
to turn sour in 1996 and eventually broke down in December 1997, when Kay,
together with the two children, left the matrimonial home. On 26 June 1997,
Kay filed the petition for divorce based on alleged unreasonable behaviour on
the part of Chia. On the same day, Chia also filed the petition for divorce
based on alleged unreasonable behaviour and adultery on the part of Kay. Both
petitions were hotly contested. On 23 November 1998, the District Court struck
out the allegations of adultery in Chia’s petition. Subsequently, after
several sessions of mediation, the parties agreed, on 22 February 1999, not to
contest each other’s amended petitions that were based only on unreasonable
behaviour. At the hearing of the petitions before the District Court on 12
March 1999, a decree nisi was granted with the following ancillary matters,
namely, maintenance, custody and access of children, and division of
matrimonial assets being adjourned to be heard in chambers. Agreement was
subsequently reached between the parties on the maintenance, custody and
access of the children, and only the division of matrimonial assets was
contested. In respect of this issue, numerous affidavits were filed by both
parties. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district judge ordered, inter
alia, as follows:

> (a) that the matrimonial home, 5 Tanglin Hill, be valued by the valuers, DTZ
> Tie & Leong, on the basis of an open market value as at 9 September 2000;
>
> (b) that the property be divided between Kay and Chia in equal shares, and
> Kay transfer her share and interest in the property to Chia without any
> payment;
>
> (c) that Chia be entitled to 50% of the value of the property free of any
> encumbrances, and that accordingly, as the property was mortgaged to
> Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (‘OCBC’) for securing the joint
> overdraft account of the parties, Kay pay to Chia the difference between the
> overdraft balance and the 50% of the value of the property, and that Chia be
> responsible for the payment of the overdraft account;
>
> (d) that Kay pay the amount ordered to be paid to Chia within 9 months, and
> in the meanwhile pay interest monthly on the overdraft as charged by the
> bank, and should she default in such payment, the entire sum due is to be
> paid ‘within 14 days of default or 4 months from the date of the valuation
> report, whichever is the later’;
>
> (e) that each party keep his or her other assets in their respective names.

The orders made by the district judge on the division of the matrimonial
assets were affirmed on appeal by the High Court. The High Court substantially
agreed with the conclusion and reasoning of the district judge.

6\. The hearings before the district judge and on appeal before the High Court
were conducted wholly on the basis of the affidavits filed and the documentary
evidence produced. There was no cross-examination of any of the affidavits
filed by the parties, and no viva voce evidence was given by either of the
parties or any person on behalf of either party. For this reason, we are in as
good a position as the judges below in making findings of fact and drawing
inferences therefrom.

_**

  
The appeal

**_

7\. We consider first the appeal by Kay. The issues raised by her centre
mainly on the following:

> (a) the division of the matrimonial home, 5 Tanglin Hill, as made by the
> district judge;
>
> (b) the imputed profits or sums of money as having been made or earned by
> Kay from her dealing in Insas shares; and
>
> (c) the adverse inference drawn by the district judge against Kay for having
> failed to produce or disclose the bank statements of her account with the
> branch of Citibank NA in Kuala Lumpur, and the consequential inference by
> the district judge that Kay had assets in total amounting to $4 to $5
> million as at the date of the hearing.

As the division of 5 Tanglin Hill was made on the basis of the assets imputed
to Kay and the adverse inference drawn against her by the district judge, we
turn first to examine the judge’s findings on these matters.

_**

  
Insas shares

**_

8\. One of Kay’s main complaints is the district judge’s findings on certain
holdings of Insas shares. The lots of Insas shares in issue may, for the
purpose of clarity, be divided into three groups, namely: first, those shares
which are presently held by Kay; second, those shares which were said to have
been purchased by Kay and subsequently sold or disposed of; and third, those
shares in which, under the Malaysian Companies Act, Kay was deemed to have an
interest.

_**

  
189,150 Insas shares

**_

9\. Belonging to the first group is a lot comprising 189,150 Insas shares.
These are still held by Kay in her name. The annual reports of Insas showed
that, as at 30 June 1996, Kay had a direct interest in 504,400 shares; that,
between that date and 30 June 1997, 315,300 shares were sold leaving a balance
of 189,100 shares, and that as at 30 June 1998 the number of shares in which
she had a direct interest was 189,150 shares. There was probably an error in
that the figure should be ‘189,100’ and not ‘189,150’. Nothing of any
consequence arises from this discrepancy.

10\. Kay’s explanation was this. From time to time, her mother and some of her
friends and she herself bought Insas shares, but all these shares (including
the 315,300 shares) were later sold and disposed of. The remaining 189,150 (or
189,100) Insas shares, which are still held in her name, belonged to the
broker, Peter Leow Thang Fong, to whom she had given the shares in payment for
the work done by him on behalf of her family. This explanation was not
accepted by the district judge, who found that the 189,150 (or 189,100) Insas
shares belong to her legally and beneficially. We agree with this finding.

11\. The value of this lot of shares is comparatively small. It is common
ground that at the date of hearing, i.e. 18 July 2000, the price for the Insas
shares was only 36.5 cents per share and accordingly the total worth of the
189,150 shares was $69,000 (rounded to the nearest $1000). This was also the
finding by the district judge: see 46 of her grounds of decision.

_**

  
2.425 million Insas shares

**_

12\. Within the second group of Insas shares were three lots of Insas shares:
the first lot comprising 2.425 million Insas shares; the second comprising 3.5
million Insas shares; and the third comprising 315,150 Insas shares. We
consider first the lot of 2.425 million Insas shares. It was alleged by Chia
that these shares were purchased and sold by Kay through the company, Dasarmas
Sdn Bhd (‘Dasarmas’), and he imputed a sum of $3.639 million as the proceeds
from the sale of these shares. He imputed these sale proceeds by taking the
price of $1.501 per share based on the average closing price of the shares on
the Singapore Stock Exchange for the period from 1 November 1993 to 10
November 1995. Chia further said that the amount of proceeds of sale was
banked into Kay’s account with Citibank NA in Kuala Lumpur. There was, among
other things, an agreement exhibited by him which showed that Dasarmas
purchased 1.85 million and 3 million Insas shares (totalling 4.85 million
shares) at RM0.50 per share from Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd on 31 May
1990. The share capital of Insas was said to have been subsequently
reorganized by the consolidation of two shares of RM0.50 each into one share
of RM1.00 each, and hence the 4.85 million Insas shares had become 2.425
million shares. Documents were also exhibited which showed that Kay had issued
a guarantee in the sum of RM1.5 million for payment of the shares under the
agreement. The district judge appeared to have accepted Chia’s allegations.
She said at 51 of her grounds of decision:

> 51 … I believed Chia that there was such a purchase in view of the agreement
> exhibited by Chia. Kay did not exhibit any document to support her
> allegation that the sale was aborted and did not explain why the sale to
> Dasarmas was aborted while the sale to Eric Lim and Dr Lim was proceeded
> with. She also did not explain why the guarantee in respect of the purchase
> price was put up by her if she did not have any interest in the purchase.

13\. That there was an agreement made by Dasarmas for the purchase of the
shares was not disputed. But Kay’s evidence was that the purchase was later
aborted and Dasarmas did not proceed with the purchase of the shares, and that
the purchase was taken over by one Eric Lim. That was confirmed by a Malaysian
law firm of Lim Kian Leong & Co in their letter dated 12 February 1992, which,
inter alia, said:

> 2\. _Perwira Habib Bank Bhd_
>
> (a) _Eric Lim Yew Tou (7M Shares)_
>

>> We attach 3 sets of new Sale and Purchase Agreement for Eric Lim Yew Tou
for 4,000,000 shares and 3 sets for 3,000,000 shares. Please arrange for him
to execute them and return them as soon as possible.

>>

>> We understand that Mr Eric Lim will be buying not only the shares presently
contracted by him, but also those contracted by Dasarmas Sdn Bhd, amounting in
all to 7M. It is therefore more convenient to sign new agreements and treat
the old agreements as lapsed as the proportions are different.__

There was no evidence that Kay had paid for these shares or that Kay had
received the huge amount of proceeds of sales of the shares. The bank
statements from Citibank NA of her accounts with the branch in Kuala Lumpur
(which were later produced and admitted by the High Court) did not show that
vast sums were paid into her account as alleged by Chia. In the light of this
evidence, we are inclined to accept Kay’s evidence that the proposed purchase
of the Insas shares by Darsamas had been aborted. In our judgment, no proceeds
of sale or any profit ought to be imputed from this lot of 2.425 million Insas
shares.

14\. It should be noted that the sale agreement for the purchase of the 2.425
million shares was made in 1990 and that was some seven years before the
breakdown of the parties’ marriage. It seems to us that if any significant
profits had been made from such purchase and sale of this lot of shares, Kay
being an enterprising businesswoman as she was, would undoubtedly have made
use of the amount for business and other purposes and probably would have
ploughed back the amount into investments. Those were the happier times of
their marriage, when the parties were together and there was very much trust
and understanding between them, and there was no need for each to account to
the other the amount he or she had spent or invested. In the circumstances, we
do not think that it is realistic now to impute, on the basis of these alleged
transactions, a substantial amount as still being held by Kay. Nor do we think
it appropriate that an investigation in the form of a tracing exercise should
be conducted to find out how she had spent or what she had done with the
moneys, even assuming that the shares were purchased and sold through Dasarmas
and huge amounts of proceeds of sale were realized.

_**  
3.5 million Insas shares**_

15\. We turn to the second lot comprising 3.5 million shares, which it was
alleged by Chia were purchased in early 1993. That purchase was admitted by
Kay. The shares were purchased in early 1993 and were paid for by Kay by
withdrawing two amounts, namely, $1,580,005 on 4 January 1993, and $647,696.75
on 19 February 1993, from the joint account with OCBC. According to Kay, these
3.5 million Insas shares were investments made by her family, and that the two
amounts withdrawn by her were partly repaid by two sums of $1,072,146.75 and
$500,450 deposited with the joint account on 26 February and 16 March 1998
respectively, leaving a balance of $655,105. The withdrawal of the two amounts
$1,580,005 and $647,696.75 by Kay from the joint account for the purchase of
3.5 million shares and the subsequent repayment by her of the two amounts of
$1,072,146.75 and $500,450 into the joint account were admitted by Chia in his
statement of claim in Suit No. 1481 of 1998, in which, among other things, he
claimed against Kay the sum of ‘$655,555’. There was probably an error in the
figure of ‘$655,555’ which should be $655,105. These withdrawals and
repayments were also supported by the bank statements produced in evidence.

16\. The district judge found that the 3.5 million shares purchased with the
money from the joint OCBC overdraft account were jointly owned by Kay and
Chia. She did not accept that these shares were the investments of Kay’s
family, as claimed by Kay. We think that the district judge was justified in
making this finding, and we agree with her.

17\. Next, the district judge imputed a profit of $3.673 million as having
been made by Kay from the sale of these shares between November 1993 and
November 1995 based on the average of the closing price of Insas shares on the
Stock Exchange of Singapore during this period: see 62 – 65 of her grounds of
decision. The district judge referred to Chia’s argument on how the imputed
profits were arrived at. She said at 62:

> 62 Based on the imputed price of $1.501 per share, the sale of 3.5 million
> shares would fetch $5.2535 million. As only about 1.58 million was paid back
> into OCBC joint account, he [Chia] claimed that there was an outstanding
> amount of 3.67 million not accounted for.

She then adopted Chia’s formula for imputing the profit of $3.673 million. She
said at 65:

> 65 This investment differed from other personal investment of Kay as Chia
> had taken an active role in its procurement rather than leaving the matters
> to Kay as in the case of Kay’s other business ventures. I thus found that
> the 3.5 million Insas shares were their joint assets. As Kay did not produce
> any evidence on the sale and the sale price, the imputed price by Chia would
> be adopted. The profits made from the sale would then be imputed to be
> $3.673 million.

18\. It is this imputed profit which is now seriously challenged. Kay’s
evidence was that these 3.5 million Insas shares were disposed of in 1993
through her broker one Peter Leow Thang Fong in the following manner:
2,497,000 shares were sold between 8 April and 18 May 1993 and the total
amount realized was RM3,633,002, which was paid into her account with the
branch of Citibank NA at Kuala Lumpur; and the balance 1,000,000 shares were
given to certain parties as commissions for facilitating the sales, and one of
such parties was Peter Leow. As the sales took place more than six years ago,
the contract notes were not available and hence no copies of such contract
notes could be produced. The only evidence Kay adduced was a letter dated 9
November 1999 written by Peter Leow giving the particulars of the sale and
disposal of the 3.5 million shares on various dates between 8 April and 18 May
1993 and the various amounts realized and banked into Kay’s account with her
bank in Kuala Lumpuir. According to this letter the total amount realized from
the sale of 2,479,000 Insas shares was RM3,633,002. The district judge,
however, did not accept this letter on the ground that it was pure hearsay. At
that time, Kay apparently was unable to obtain the bank statements from her
bank in Kuala Lumpur. On appeal before the High Court, Kay managed to obtain
the relevant bank statements and these statements were then admitted in
evidence. These bank statements showed that between 8 April and 18 May 1993
various sums totalling RM3,633,002 were paid into Kay’s bank account. It is
significant that the amounts shown in the bank statements as paid into her
account tallied exactly with the amounts given by Peter Leow in his letter.
The statements certainly corroborated Kay’s evidence with regard to the
payments into her bank account. If these bank statements had been produced
before the district judge, she would, in all probability, not have imputed the
profit of $3.673 million to Kay. In our judgment, this imputation of $3.673
million cannot be sustained.

19\. There were profits made by Kay from the disposal of the 3.5 million Insas
shares, but the profits were nowhere in the region of $3.673 million. The
total proceeds realized from the 2,497,000 shares (sold between April and May
1993) were RM3,633,002. In May 1993, the rate of exchange between S$ and RM
was $0.628 to RM1, and the amount of RM3,633,002 was therefore equivalent to
approximately S$2,281,525.20. Taking that figure as the net proceeds of sale,
the profits were as follows:

> Proceeds of sale RM3,633,002 equivalent to  | S$2,281,525.20  
> ---|---  
> Less |   
> Amount withdrawn on 4/1/93 from the joint account | S$1,580,005.00  
> Amount withdrawn on 19/2/93 from the joint account | S$647,696.75  
> Net proceeds | S$53,823.45  
  
Thus, on this basis, the net profit made from this lot of Insas shares was
only $53,823.45. And even if we do not accept Kay’s evidence that the
1,000,000 Insas shares had been given as commissions to the brokers and others
for facilitating the sales, we could only impute that these shares are being
still held by Kay. In that event, the value of these shares at 36.5 cents per
share, being the price of the share at the date of hearing, would be about
$365,000. In our judgment, there is no basis for treating these 1,000,000
Insas shares as having been sold between 1993 and 1995 at the imputed price of
$1.501 per share, yielding a total sum of $1,501,000.

20\. Again, the transactions relating to the purchases and sales of this lot
of 3.5 million Insas shares took place in 1993, some four years before the
breakdown of their marriage. Whatever profits that had been made must have
been spent or utilized by Kay for business or other purposes. We do not think
that we can now impute the total proceeds of sale of these shares as still
being retained and held by Kay. As shown from the bank statements, the
proceeds of sales were paid into the account of Kay with Citibank NA at Kuala
Lumpur and were subsequently made use of by Kay for her own or other purposes.
That was in 1993. There was certainly no such huge credit balance in her
account at or about the time of the breakdown of the marriage or at the date
of the hearing.

_**

  
315,150 Insas shares

**_

21\. The third lot of shares falling within the second group comprised 315,150
Insas shares. There is a minor discrepancy in the number of shares comprised
in this lot – whether it should be 315,250 or 315,150 or 315,300. In 47 of her
grounds of decision, the district judge referred to Chia’s argument in which
the number of shares was stated to be 315,250. In 53 and 54, the number of
shares given was 315,150. And according to the annual reports of Insas, Kay
had a direct interest in 315,300 shares, and these shares were sold between 1
July 1996 and 30 June 1997. However, nothing of any importance turns on this.

22\. As we have narrated, Kay’s evidence was that these shares were bought by
her mother and some of her friends and also herself from time to time, and
they were subsequently sold. The district judge did not find her evidence
sufficient, and in the circumstances Kay ‘was held to have owned them and to
have received the benefits of the sale proceeds’, and as she did not produce
any evidence on the sale proceeds, ‘the imputed value’ given by Chia was
relied on. The imputed value as given by Chia was $473,040 at the price of
$1.501 per share based on the average closing price of the share on the
Singapore Stock Exchange for the period 1 November 1993 to 10 November 1995.
We are unable to accept this imputation. According to the annual report, the
sale took place between 1 July 1996 and 30 June 1997, and there is no valid
reason for using a price which was based on the average closing price for the
period long before the sale. At any rate, even assuming that she had realized
this amount of proceeds of sale, we do not see any legal basis for her to
account for this sum for the purpose of the division of the matrimonial
assets. The sales took place sometime before the breakdown of the marriage,
and what she received she was entitled to spend it and we do not think it is
right now to impute that amount as being retained and still being held by her.

_**

  
Deemed interest in Insas shares

**_

23\. We now turn to the third group of Insas shares, i.e. shares in which
under the Malaysian Companies Act, Kay was deemed to have an interest. Falling
within this group were two lots comprising 834,111 and 875,189 Insas shares.
On these lots of shares, the district judge said at 53 – 55 of her grounds of
decision as follows:

> 53 Kay’s position was as follows:
>

>> (1) 834,111 shares did not belong to her (but this was a bare denial
without any further explanation);

>>

>> (2) 875,189 shares belonged to Wistara;

>>

>> (3) 315,150 shares owned by her mother, some of her friends and herself and
managed by Mr Leow for which he was given the 189,150 shares now still held by
Kay;

>>

>> (4) 1,115,664 shares had been transferred to Wistara and belonged to
Wistara (But she did not give any other supporting evidence for her
allegation. However, there was also not sufficient evidence from Chia why
these shares held originally under Singapore nominees were owned beneficially
by Kay).

>
> 54 In respect of the 834,111 shares, 875,189 shares and 315,150 shares, the
> Annual Reports of Insas stated that Kay had either direct or deemed interest
> in them. Kay had not given sufficient evidence to show otherwise. Under the
> circumstances, she was held to have owned them and to have received the
> benefits of the sale proceeds. She did not produce any evidence on the sale
> proceeds and the imputed value given by Chia would have to be relied upon. I
> excluded the 1,115,664 shares from the assets of Kay.
>
> 55 It should however be noted that although Chia alleged that Kay earned a
> lot of monies through the sale of the shares, there was no allegation that
> Kay made use of any joint funds or funds of Chia to purchase these shares.

24\. It is clear to us that the figures of 834,111 and 875,189 were taken from
the 1994 annual report of Insas and the relevant part of the report showed
that Kay was deemed to have an interest through a company, Wistara Sdn Bhd
(‘Wistara’). The relevant part of the report was as follows:

Deemed Interest | _At beginning_ | _Bought_ | _Sold_ | _At end of year_  
---|---|---|---|---  
Kay Swee Tuan (1) | 1,709,300 | \-  | 834,111  | 875,189  
  
The note (1) stated that these shares were held through Wistara. It is
submitted by counsel for Kay that Chia merely plucked the figures of 834,111
(being the shares sold) and 875,189 (being the balance shares at the end of
the year) from Insas’ 1994 annual report and added the two figures together,
and then alleged that Kay owned these shares and had sold them. That was all
the evidence relied upon by Chia.

25\. The annual report did not show that Kay owned these shares in Insas at
that time. A person, who is deemed under the Companies Act to have an interest
in certain shares of a company, may not have any beneficial interest in the
shares. Much depends on the circumstances under which he is deemed to have
that interest.

26\. Kay’s evidence was that these shares were owned by Wistara, in which
Kay’s sister, Kay Swee Ee (‘Swee Ee’), and her husband, Dr Bhinyo Paniypan,
owned 70% of the shares, and they had given her a power of attorney over their
properties and assets including shares in companies. By reason of this, under
s 6A(6)(d) of the Malaysian Companies Act, Kay was deemed to have an interest
in the 1,709,300 Insas shares, as she exercised or controlled the exercise of
a right attached to the shares. According to the report, Wistara held
2,441,856 Insas shares; however, Swee Ee and Dr Paniypan owned 70% of Wistara,
and 70% of 2,441,856 shares came to 1,709,300 shares, and for this reason Kay
declared that she had a deemed interest in 1,709,300 shares in Insas.

27\. In support of Kay’s evidence, Swee Ee swore an affidavit on 17 November
1999, in which she said that she and her husband, Dr Bhinyo Paniyan, are the
sole beneficial owners of 70% of the shares in Wistara and that the balance of
the shares in that company is owned by one Tengku Puteri Seri Kamala Pahang
Tengku Hajja Aisha bte Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah, SIMP, and that Wistara was the
vehicle they used to purchase shares in Insas. Further, until 1992, Wistara
was one of the largest shareholders in Insas and Kay represented their
interest and for that reason was appointed a director of Insas. Swee Ee
confirmed that Kay had no interest in Wistara, and that from time to time Kay
assisted Wistara in selling some of the shares and the proceeds of sale were
paid to her (Swee Ee). Swee Ee also exhibited a copy of the power of attorney
dated 1 August 1986, which she and her husband gave to Kay and which conferred
on Kay very wide powers to deal with any of their properties or assets,
including stock and shares in companies. We are satisfied from the evidence,
to which we have referred, that Kay had no beneficial interest in the two lots
of Insas shares, namely, 834,111 and 875,189 shares.

28\. With respect, the district judge was clearly in error in imputing to Kay
any gains from the sales of these two lots of Insas shares, namely, 834,111
and 875,189 (totalling 1,709,300) Insas shares, which at all material times
were held by Wistaria. At 41 of her grounds of decision, the judge found,
inter alia, that Kay had ‘a deemed interest of 2.441 million share through a
nominee Wistaria’, and at 45, she held that the 2.441 million shares did not
belong to Kay. The 2.411 million Insas shares included the two lots of Insas
shares (834,111 and 875,189), as we have explained in 26 above.

Imputation of profits

**_

29\. In 117 of her grounds of decision, the district judge held:

> There were imputed Insas shares profit of $6.733 million earned by herself
> [Kay] and $3.673 million earned from funds in the joint account around 1993
> to 1995.

In respect of the imputed profits of $6.733 million, the judge accepted Chia’s
allegations and imputed this sum as having been earned by Kay from the
following lots of Insas shares: 2.425 million shares, 834,111 shares, 875,189
shares and 315,250 (or 315,150) shares. The sum of $6.733 million was arrived
at by adding these lots of Insas shares, and multiplying the total number of
shares by the price of $1.501 per share, which was based on the average
closing price of the share on the Singapore Stock Exchange for the period
between 1 November 1993 and 10 November 1995. With respect, for the reasons we
have given, we are unable to accept this imputation for the purpose of the
division of matrimonial assets between Chia and Kay. Nor can we accept the
imputation of the $3.673 million as profits from the 3.5 million Insas shares
which we have discussed in 18 above.

Master Penguin and Sketchley shares

**_

30\. In February 1991, Kay in her name bought a company called Master
Penguin’s Drycleaning & Laundry Pte Ltd (‘Master Penguin’) for $875,000 using
funds from the joint account with OCBC. According to Chia, she only repaid to
the joint account $795,000 leaving a balance of $80,000. Master Penguin in
turn held 760,000 of the 860,000 shares in another company, Sketchley Services
Pte Ltd. Kay also held in her name 99,999 shares in Sketchley leaving one
share being held by a third party. Thus, directly or indirectly through Master
Penguin, Kay wholly owned Sketchley Services Pte Ltd (‘Sketchley’). Sketchley
was the sole proprietor of a laundry business carried on under the name of
Laundryland, and owned ten shop units at Bayshore and three vans and operated
its business in 5 outlets. The ten shop units were mortgaged to Citibank NA to
secure the overdraft and other facilities granted to Sketchley, and in
addition, Kay herself executed a personal guarantee to the bank to secure
these facilities. She was the manager of Laundryland.

31\. Kay claimed that the shares, which she held in Master Penguin and
Sketchley were held on trust for her own family, but there is no evidence that
the source of the funds for the acquisition of these shares came from her
family. The district judge held that she had not discharged the burden of
showing that the beneficial interest in the shares did not belong to her. We
agree with the district judge’s finding that the shares in Master Penguin and
Sketchley belonged to Kay and were part of the matrimonial assets.

32\. The laundry business had not been successful. In early 1999, Sketchley
and Kay were sued by Citibank NA. On 7 May 1999, the bank obtained a judgment
against both of them for the sum of $2,169,475.57 with interest, and an order
for possession of the ten shop units (mortgaged to the bank) was also obtained
by the bank on the same day. Kay said that she was then desperate and arranged
for the sale of all the shares in Sketchley to Vincent Tan, who is the son of
the co-respondent, for $2.4 million and the sale was made on 17 September
1999. Copies of two sale agreements dated 17 September 1999 were produced in
evidence: one made between Master Penguin and Vincent Tan and the other
between Kay and Vincent Tan. According to Kay the sale was a ‘rescue sale’.

33\. The district judge was not too impressed by Kay’s candour in respect of
the financial position of Sketchley and the sale. She said at 37 of her
grounds of decision:

> 37 It was undisputed that there were three judgments against the company by
> Citibank amounting to around $2.4 million including interest. However, there
> was no history that the company was in financial difficulties. Instead, it
> appeared that the company simply allowed a default position to occur.

We have difficulty in agreeing with this inference drawn by the district
judge. First, there was evidence that Sketchley had been in financial
difficulties. The accounts of the company made up to 31 March 1995 showed that
it made a trading loss of $446,353 for the year 1995, and had an accumulated
trading loss in the amount of $1,126,590 in 1993 and $1,602,334 in 1995. The
accounts of the company for later years were not produced. However, for the
bank to have initiated proceedings against the company to enforce the mortgage
over the ten shop units, the company must have repeatedly defaulted in making
payments due to the bank. From the documents produced, it appeared that, on 7
December 1998, the bank wrote to Sketchley demanding payment of the amount of
$498,003.39 which was overdue. Apparently Sketchley failed to pay the amount
as demanded. On 23 December 1998, the bank informed Sketchley that it had
terminated the facilities extended and demanded repayment of all the
outstanding sum.

34\. Secondly, whatever may be the financial position of Sketchley, it would
be foolhardy for Kay, who wholly owned the company, to ‘allow a default
position to occur’. Particularly, in this case, she claimed that the shares in
Sketchley belonged to her and her family and were not part of the matrimonial
assets.

35\. Lastly, Kay is an advocate and solicitor and it could be quite damaging
to her professionally to have a judgment for such a huge sum as $2.4 million
entered against her and remaining outstanding. In particular, under s 28 of
the Legal Profession Act, a solicitor, who has one or more outstanding
judgments against him amounting in aggregate to $100,000 or more, which he has
been unable to satisfy, will be disqualified from applying for a practising
certificate. Presumably, it was for this reason that, after the full payment
of the amount due to the bank, Kay caused to be filed in court a consent to
entry of satisfaction of the judgment signed by an officer on behalf of
Citibank NA. This document would provide an incontrovertible record that the
judgment has been fully satisfied.

36\. That having said, we think that there were grounds for the district judge
to hold that the sale of the shares in Sketchley by Kay to Vincent Tan was
suspect. The numerous affidavits filed in the course of the divorce
proceedings showed that Kay was very close to the co-respondent and his
family. The co-respondent and his son live in the Philippines, and the son
apparently was then still a student at a university. It does not appear to us
that there was any sound commercial reason for the co-respondent and/or his
son to purchase the entire shares in Sketchley, a company engaged in laundry
business. It appears that after the purchase a letter was sent by Sketchley to
Eastbay supermarket, which occupied some of the Bayshore units owned by
Sketchley, requesting Eastbay to forward future rental payments to 80 Robinson
Road, #10-01B, which is the address for Kay’s law firm, ST Kay & Co. No reason
was proffered to explain why Kay was still receiving rental payments for
Sketchley’s properties. It seems to us more likely that the co-respondent by
this arrangement was providing some financial assistance to Kay, with which
she was then able to discharge her personal liability to the bank.

37\. Having held that the sale was suspect, the judge made the following
finding:

> 37 ..... The valuation report [of Sketchley] relied on by Kay was also much
> to be desired. It was based on outdated accounts of the company. The 4 shop
> units were sold at a later time. There was no evidence introduced by either
> party to show the difference in price which could be attributed to the
> difference in time.
>
> 38 Taking the evidence as a whole, I agree with Chia that the sale to
> Vincent Tan was suspect and Kay had not disclosed the real worth of the
> company shares she sold.
>
> 39 Knight Frank desktop valuation of the 10 units as at 28 Oct 1999 was $2.7
> million. In the accounts, there was also $517,000 disclosed as current
> assets. The sum of $2.7 million and $517,000 would be $3.217 million. In the
> absence of any other better evidence, I took the value of the shares to be
> so. The net value after deducting the liability of $2.4 million would thus
> be $817,000.

Although we agree with the district judge’s view that the sale of the shares
by Kay to the son of the co-respondent was suspect, we find it difficult to
agree with her determination of the net value of the shares. She took the
figure of $517,000 as the current assets from the valuation given by the firm
of accountants, H S Lim & Co, who valued the shares in Sketchley as ‘zero’.
She added this figure to the sum of $2.7 million, which was the valuation of
the property as given by Knight Frank and deducted only the liability owed to
the bank, which was in the region of $2.4 m. She did not take into account and
deduct, which she should have done, the other liabilities of Sketchley, which
obviously there were. Unfortunately, there were no accounts of the company
made up to 1998 available, and the only accounts produced were the balance
sheet and profit and loss accounts of the company as at 31 March 1995. And
according to the balance sheet of the company as at 31 March, 1995, the total
amount of liabilities, including the amount owed to the bank and secured by
the mortgage, was $3,818,946.65. On the basis of the accounts of Sketchley
made up to 31 March 1995, the shares in Sketchley had a negative value. In our
opinion, the net value of these shares as at the date of hearing might not be
negative as valued by the accountant, but our inference is that it was
certainly far less than $817,000 as determined by the district judge. For the
year ended 31 March 1995, the company had an accumulated trading loss of over
$1.5 million. On the basis of its inability to discharge its liabilities to
the bank in 1998, which resulted in the action being taken by the bank to
enforce its security, and the 1995 accounts of the company, our inference is
that the business of the company had not been a successful one, and as at the
date of hearing the net value of the shares of the company could not be
considerable. For our purpose, it is not necessary to determine a definite sum
as the net value of these shares.

_**

  
Adverse inferences against Kay

**_

38\. The district judge found that Kay had not made sufficient efforts to
disclose the bank statements of her account with the branch of Citibank NA in
Kuala Lumpur and other documents required for the purpose, and drew an adverse
inference against her. She said at 71 to 73 of her grounds of decision:

> 71 Kay said that the monies in the Citibank (Singapore) account were
> transferred from her Citibank (Malaysia) account. However, there was no
> documentary proof. In Mar 94, RM9,561,656 was withdrawn from the account.
> Kay exhibited a letter from Citibank (Singapore) dated 4 Jan 2000 stating
> that the withdrawal was utilised to repay term loans and overdraft. No
> details were given by Kay of the loans and overdraft repaid. The statement
> however showed that $1.291 million was paid into the overdraft account and
> that the term loan disappeared that month. Thereafter the deposit was
> reduced to RM1.7 million. In November 1994, RM1.7 million was withdrawn.
> There was no evidence given as to what it was used for.
>
> 72 Upon the application of Chia for discovery, Kay was ordered on 2 June
> 1999 to produce 26 items of documents. Chia said that Kay had only produced
> 11 items. The documents not produced by Kay despite the court order included
> the following:
>

>> (1) the monthly bank statements of Kay’s account with Citibank (Singapore)
from January 1990 to February 1993;

>>

>> (2) the monthly bank statements of Kay’s account with Citibank (Malaysia)
from January 1990 to March 1999;

>
> Kay said that she had written to Citibank (Malaysia) for the statements but

> statements were furnished in court as ordered. On the evidence, I did not
> think she had made sufficient effort to secure the statements and therefore
> adverse inference should be drawn against her.

39\. We have the following observations. The bank statements sought by Chia
relate to transactions which took place some six years ago before the hearing
of the ancillary matters. We for our part do not find it surprising that Kay
met with difficulties in seeking to obtain these statements. We note that the
account with the Singapore branch of Citibank NA was closed in 1996, and that
the bank statements of this account for the period 1993-96 were produced. As
for her account with the branch of Citibank NA in Kuala Lumpur, she produced
the statements for the period between February 1994 and December 1998 and they
showed that only a credit balance of RM10,126.67 remained in the account. It
was explained by Kay that the account had been inactive since 1996, and that
she had written to the bank many times for the bank statements covering the
earlier period, but she had had no response. She had also instructed
solicitors in Kuala Lumpur to write to the bank but equally her solicitors met
with no success. As her account with the Singapore branch of Citibank NA was
closed in 1996, and her account with the branch of the bank in Kuala Lumpur
had been inactive for several years and there was only a credit balance of
RM10,126.67 in her account, she could hardly qualify as a preferential
customer, such that the bank would go out of its way and helpfully provide
with due expedition copies of bank statements of her account some six to seven
years ago. To obtain such statements from the bank would normally take a long
time. At any rate, the bank statements were eventually obtained and were
produced at the hearing of the appeals before the High Court and were admitted
in evidence.

40\. The judge in the High Court, however, did not accept fully the bank
statements. He said at 16:

> 16\. … I was uncomfortable in relying on her statements from the Citibank. I
> was not at all sure that the account was the only account which Kay had
> maintained. There could have been other accounts where the imputed profits
> were banked. Kay had been so reluctant to furnish the documentary trail and
> I am compelled to share the district judge’s inclination to infer against
> her by reason of her lack of candour.

With respect, we do not find that there is any ground for this misgiving or
scepticism on the part of the judge. We for our part can find no reason for
not relying on these bank statements. In particular, there was no evidence to
show that Kay had any other account with Citibank NA or any account with any
other bank in Kuala Lumpur. If she had, we think that most likely Chia who, as
the judge found, knew of Kay’s commercial venture ‘intimately’, would be aware
of it.

41\. There are two other matters which we should bear in mind in drawing any
inference against Kay. First, the monetary transactions which Chia sought to
prove took place some three to four years before the breakdown of their
marriage. As we have said, those were the happier times, when there was a
great deal of trust and understanding between Kay and Chia. In those
circumstances, each party must have drawn funds from their own respective
accounts and also the joint account freely without any thought that each had
to account to the other the amount or amounts withdrawn and spent. Secondly,
Chia is a meticulous and careful man, while Kay was rather carefree and must
have been quite lax when the task involved keeping of records and accounts. In
this connection, it is helpful to remember what the district judge said at 106
and 107 of her grounds of decision:

> 106 Chia was a meticulous person keeping a good record of past transactions
> and paper documents and was very attentive to details. He was a cautious
> man. He made some sound investment in real property and he did not get into
> many business ventures. Kay on the other hand was deeply involved in
> business. She was more carefree with monies and more daring in her
> investment. She entered into business deals involving big sums of monies and
> high risks.
>
> 107 They had shared a great deal of love, trust and understanding. It was no
> doubt in part because they had gone through together the rough patch in
> Chia’s life when he was faced with the criminal conviction. Unfortunately,
> the relationship subsequently turned sour.

The judge in the High Court expressed similar views. He said at 5 of his
grounds of decision:

> Until the firm’s dissolution in June 1998 Chia managed the law firm solely
> while Kay spent a major part of her time pursuing commercial opportunities.
> I agree entirely with the district judge that she had invested and pursued
> every commercial opportunity for the benefit of the marriage and the
> children. . . . . . [O]n the evidence, I also agree with the district judge
> that Chia was meticulous and careful in the management of the financial
> resources or the undertaking of commitments to the banks. He held the cheque
> books and knew of the issue of the cheques, many of which he had signed
> himself as the authorized signatory. It would not be open to him to assert
> that he was not aware of Kay’s commercial ventures. In fact, I had no doubt
> that he knew of them intimately and approved every one of those investments.
> Kay had also operated the investments of her mother, siblings and the estate
> of her late father. Those were kept quite separate. Undoubtedly, Chia knew
> what assets and ventures were those undertaken by them as husband and wife
> and those which Kay conducted on behalf of her mother and siblings.

We agree with them entirely.

42\. Having regard to the above and to what we have decided on the Insas
shares, we do not think that there is sufficient underlying basis for drawing
an adverse inference that Kay must have had hidden substantial assets which
she had not disclosed. For the reasons we have given, we are unable, with
respect, to accept the district judge’s inference that Kay had ‘total assets,
known or undisclosed, amounting to $4 to $5 million altogether at the time of
hearing’.

43\. It should also be borne in mind that Kay has a personal account with
OCBC, which is an overdraft account with a debit balance of $5.6 million as at
September 1999 and the overdraft is secured by a mortgage of No. 68 Andrew
Road, which was owned by her father and after his death the property now
belongs to her mother. If indeed she had such assets as inferred by the
district judge, it is somewhat surprising that she did nothing to make use of
at least some of these assets to reduce the overdraft account.

_**

  
5 Tanglin Hill

**_

44\. We are now in a better position to determine the division of No. 5
Tanglin Hill, which was the matrimonial home of the parties. The property is a
detached double-storey house standing on a plot of land having an area of
about 16,000 sq ft. It was bought in 1984 for $1.7 million by Kay through her
family connections. Kay made the initial payment of $316,902 and Chia
contributed a sum of $300,000, with the remaining amount of $1.1 million
borrowed from OCBC on an overdraft facility secured by a mortgage over the
property. The district judge found that the renovation costs were contributed
by the parties. The property was conveyed or transferred solely to Kay.
However, there was a deed of trust executed by Kay stating that she held half
share of the property in trust for Chia; it was dated 30 October 1984 but
stamped on 19 December 1990. There was a dispute whether it was executed on 30
October 1984 or 19 December 1990, but nothing of any consequence turns on it.
On 27 May 1992, pursuant to the deed of trust, Chia was registered as a joint
owner of the property with Kay.

45\. The overdraft account of Kay was subsequently converted into a joint
account which continued to be secured by the mortgage over the property. The
property was rented out from 1984 to 1989, and the rentals were used to
service the mortgage payments. During that time the parties lived at Marina
House arranged by Kay and subsequently at her sister’s house free of rent. In
1989, they moved to their own home. The overdraft used to finance the
matrimonial home was cleared at one stage, but Chia and Kay continued to draw
on the account for personal as well as business purposes. At the time of the
hearing before the district judge, the joint overdraft account was overdrawn
to the order of $5.22 million or thereabouts.

46\. The district judge made an equal division of 5 Tanglin Hill between Chia
and Kay: each to be entitled to 50% of the property. However, having made that
division, she further ordered (i) that Kay transfer her half share to Chia
without any payment; and (ii) that Kay pay to Chia the difference between the
overdraft amount outstanding and 50% of the value of the property, thus giving
Chia 50% of the property unencumbered. She said at 118 and 119:

> 118 The bungalow was worth between 8 m to 9.7 million. The average valuation
> was $8.7 million. The overdraft of $5.5 million was incurred by Kay. The net
> value of the bungalow based on the average valuation was $3.2 million. Chia
> had about $450,000 in his other assets.
>
> 119 I could only take the broad brush approach. The overdraft was at one
> stage cleared meaning the bungalow was at one stage unencumbered. Parties
> already at that stage owned the bungalow fully. I thus felt that Chia should
> have half the value of the bungalow unencumbered, taking into account what
> Kay ought to pay to Chia or account to the joint account in respect of the
> Sommerville property, Master Penguin and Sketchley shares, Insas shares and
> US 137,000 etc. The cars, club membership and other assets they each own
> could remain so. That was in my view a just and equitable division taking
> into account all the circumstances of the case.

47\. The amount outstanding and owing to the bank at the date of hearing was
in the region of $5.22 million or thereabouts. By ordering Kay (i) to transfer
her half share to Chia free of any payment and (ii) to pay Chia the difference
between the overdraft amount and the 50% of the value of the property, the
judge was in effect making Kay solely responsible for the payment of the
overdraft amount. In our opinion, the net effect of the district judge’s order
would, with respect, be giving much too much to Chia.

48\. It is clear to us that the order for the transfer of Kay’s half share and
the payment by Kay was made on the basis of the huge amounts of profits the
district judge imputed to Kay arising from her dealings in the Insas shares,
which we have already discussed above, and the judge’s inference that Kay had
hidden such profits in her account with Citibank NA in Kuala Lumpur which Kay
had failed to disclose. The district judge said at 116 and 117 of her grounds
of decision:

> 116 In respect of the imputed profits, it was pertinent to note that they
> related to profits made around 1993 and latest in 1995. I believed that in
> 1993 or 1994, when Kay was involved in the restructuring of Insas, she
> earned quite a lot of money from buying and selling Insas shares and her
> Citibank accounts probably had huge deposits. But I did not accept Chia’s
> allegation that she earned RM20 million from Datuk Thong as there was no
> evidence to support the allegation. Kay however started to invest in
> Isedecor in 1994. I believed that the project made tremendous losses. It was
> not disputed that the permit to operate the plant was never obtained and
> that substantial funds had been dumped into the project. I also accepted
> that none of her other business ventures had done well after 1996.
>
> 117 Apart from the share in the bungalow at 5 Tanglin Hill, her known assets
> came to about $1.6 million. There were other assets of unknown value. I
> concluded that she would have total assets, known or undisclosed, amounting
> to $4 to $5 million altogether at the time of hearing. This was a figure,
> admittedly, based very much on general impression and gut feel, arrived at
> to the best of my estimation. There was simply no sufficient information
> given during proceedings.

49\. Apart from the equal contributions made by the parties towards the
acquisition and maintenance of the property, we should also take into account
the fact that the property was purchased at a good price from Kay’s family
friend, that Kay had given Chia a half share in the law firm free from
consideration, and that Kay had the custody, care and control of the two
children. All these are relevant considerations in deciding on the division of
the matrimonial home. Further, after the breakdown of the marriage, Chia had
the benefit of occupying the house free of rent for the period from January
1998 to June 2000. In June 2000, Chia finally rented out the house at $16,000
per month, and probably since then he alone had been having the benefit of
this rental, apart from using it to service the mortgage payments.

50\. In view of what we have decided with respect to the imputed profits from
the sales of the Insas share, the value of the shares in Sketchley, and the
adverse inference against Kay, we find that there is no basis for making the
order requiring Kay to transfer her half share of the property to Chia free of
any payment and to pay the difference between the overdraft amount outstanding
and 50% of the value of the property. This order and the consequential order
for payment of interest to OCBC by Kay in the event of default and other
consequential orders cannot stand and should be set aside. We so order.

51\. We agree with the district judge that the property should be divided
equally between them. With respect to the amount outstanding and owing to OCBC
on the overdraft account, both parties should bear equally the liability for
payment of such amount. It may be that the liability was incurred by the
withdrawal by Kay of huge amounts totalling $4.49 million which were for
investment, and in particular for investment in a company in Johore, Isedecor
Sdn Bhd (‘Isedecor’). On the other hand, Kay had given evidence that, between
1990 and 1995, she had deposited vast sums of money totalling about $6.28
million into the joint account. As the district judge found and we agree, Kay
made tremendous losses in that project and none of her business ventures had
done well since 1996. If the investments had been successful, Chia and the
family would be enriched and benefitted. These withdrawals were made at the
time, when the parties were together working jointly to create wealth for the
family, and, in our view, Kay should not be held solely responsible for making
the repayment to the joint account with OCBC.

_**

  
Chia’s appeal

**_

52\. We now turn to Chia’s appeal. Chia raises several issues before us. Some
of these have been dealt with and the only remaining issues we need to
consider are the following. First, he contends that the High Court erred in
holding that the Arcadia penthouse belonged to Fuelcon Pte Ltd, rather than to
Kay. Secondly, Chia claims that the district judge erred in holding that the
$4.49 million withdrawn by Kay from their OCBC joint overdraft account was for
investment in Isedecor. He asserts instead that the amount was a loan to
Isedecor or alternatively was withdrawn by Kay for her other purposes.

_**

  
Arcadia penthouse

**_

53\. During the appeal to the High Court, Chia adduced further evidence with a
view to showing that Kay bought a penthouse in Arcadia Garden. The judge
found, however, that the property was owned legally and beneficially by
Fuelcon Pte Ltd, a company largely owned by the co-respondent, in which both
Kay and the co-respondent were directors. There was affidavit evidence of
independent third parties showing that Kay was acting as a solicitor and the
money for the purchase of the penthouse came from her client and not from Kay.
We agree with this finding, and there is nothing we can usefully add to it.

_**

  
Isedecor

**_

54\. The next contention of Chia relates to Kay’s investment in Isedecor. Kay
was a director of Isedecor, owning 1 million Isedecor shares through
Euroshield Sdn Bhd, which she controlled. Isedecor was a joint venture between
Petroleum Technology Resources Corporation, which was owned by the co-
respondent, and Johor State Islamic EDC. Kay’s evidence was that the Isedecor
shares had become worthless as Isedecor was not issued a licence to operate
its sludge treatment facility in Johor. The judge found that Kay withdrew
$4.49 million from the joint account and used it for her investment in
Isedecor and that Kay lost a lot of money in this investment. Chia contends
that the money was advanced to Isedecor as a loan instead and not to acquire
shares in the company. He also says that the money was used by Kay for other
purposes.

55\. We reject this contention. Chia in his affidavit of 9 September 1999
asserted that the $4.49 million was withdrawn by Kay for her investment in
Isedecor but later in his affidavit of 28 April 2000 and at trial he said that
the $4.49 million was never paid to Isedecor at all but was used by Kay for
other purposes. He appears to us to have changed courses when he discovered
that the investment in Isedecor had failed and was not worth anything. Both
the district judge and the judge in the High Court held, and so do we, that
the investment by Kay in Isedecor was a failed investment and that the $4.49
million was irrecoverable. At any rate, Kay has consistently maintained that
she is prepared to transfer half of her Isedecor shareholding to Chia, an
offer which Chia has declined to accept. It is obvious to us that Chia knew
that the investment in Isedecor had failed.

Division

**_

56\. We now turn to the division of the matrimonial assets. The main asset for
division between Chia and Kay is 5 Tanglin Hill, which is in their joint
names, subject to the mortgage in favour of OCBC which secures their joint
overdraft account. We agree with the district judge that the property should
be divided equally between them. With respect to the amount outstanding and
owing to OCBC on the overdraft account, both parties should bear equally the
liability for payment of such amount. We therefore order that 5 Tanglin Hill
be divided equally between the parties after deducting the amount outstanding
and owing to OCBC. To give effect to this division, we order that the property
be sold in the open market within the next twelve months or such extended time
as the parties may agree, and upon such sale, the proceeds, less expenses
incurred in such sale, be applied in repayment to OCBC of the amount owing,
and subject to that, the balance be divided and distributed to Chia and Kay in
equal proportions. In the meanwhile, all rentals from the said property are to
be paid to the joint account with OCBC in or towards reduction of the
overdraft. Neither Chia nor Kay is hereafter permitted to withdraw any sum
therefrom, save and except for payment of any outgoings payable on the
property. It is hoped that, with the benefit of advice or assistance from
their respective counsel, the parties can reach agreement on the mode of sale,
the price at which it is to be sold, and all other incidental matters
pertaining to the sale. In default of such agreement, the parties are at
liberty to apply to the district court for the necessary directions for the
sale.

57\. There is one other property, which should be subject to division between
Chia and Kay, namely, the Sommerville apartment. Both parties had contributed
to the acquisition of this property. The district judge apportioned 67.5%
thereof to Kay and 32.5% to Chia. We affirm this apportionment. However, the
judge, although she apportioned the value between the two of them, did not
order a specific division of this asset on that basis, but took the
apportionment into account in making the division of 5 Tanglin Hill: see 119
of her grounds of decision which we have quoted above. We think that a more
equitable way of division is to treat this property separately for the purpose
of making a division between the two of them. At the time of the hearing, the
net value was $507,391 or thereabouts, and that is the value to be adopted for
the purpose of this division. Since then, presumably the net value would have
increased owing to the reduction of the mortgage payments by Kay. We order
that the property is to remain with Kay, subject to her payment to Chia of
$164,902 representing the 32.5% of that value. This payment is to be made only
after the sale of 5 Tanglin Hill by way of deduction of that sum from the
portion of the proceeds of the sale of 5 Tanglin Hill, which is to be paid to
Kay.

58\. Apart from 5 Tanglin Hill and the Sommerville apartment, each party has
other assets in his or her name. Chia’s assets in his own name include a
Midland Bank account with a balance of 4000, CDP shares valued at $68,304 as
at December 1998, CPF balances of $120,969, Mercedes Benz worth $40,000,
American Club membership valued at $48,000, SICC membership valued at $139,999
and Laguna club membership worth $90,000 (with $30,000 transfer fee). The
district judge found that the value of these assets came to bout $450,000.
This, however, did not include the amount of $164,902, which we now apportion
to him as his interest in Sommerville apartment.

59\. Kay’s assets in her name (apart from 5 Tanglin Hill and Sommerville
apartment) are the following:

Master Penguin & Sketchley | Value unknown but not considerable  
---|---  
189,160 Insas shares | 189,160 Insas shares held by Kay, valued at $69,000.  
Technology Resources shares in Kay’s CDP | 

  * 25,000 shares which are valued at $30,000 

  
Kay’s Premtec shares | 

  * 800 shares which are valued at $800. 

  
Kay’s Premtec Marine shares | 

  * 80,000 shares which are valued at RM80,000. 

  
Genting View apartment | 

  * The district judge found that the value was RM 82,800.

  
Kay’s Malaysian Citibank Account | 

  * The credit balance of RM10,126 in her account with the branch of Citibank NA in Kuala Lumpur.

  
Kay’s other accounts | 

  * An ICB account with a credit balance of $6,599 balance.
  * An OUB account overdrawn by $10.
  * A Natwest London account – balance is undisclosed.

  
Kay’s Club membership (before deduction of transfer fee) | 

  * Raffles Marina Club ($16,000 with $12,390 transfer fee).

  
Kay’s insurance policies | 

  * 2 Cigna travel insurance policies with no surrender value.

  
Kay’s car | 

  * Lexus – unknown value – bought in 1996 by Kay for $320,000 with $167,821 outstanding loan.

  
Kay’s CPF | 

  * $26,021 balance.

  
  
60\. The district judge found that the value of the assets in Kay’s name,
apart from her share in 5 Tanglin Hill, came to about $1.6 million. But this
included the amount of $817,000 being the imputed value of Kay’s shares in
Sketchley. As we have held, the value of these shares was nowhere near that
sum. Also included in that computation was her entire interest in Sommerville
apartment, of which we now apportion to her only 67.5%.

61\. Subject to what we have specifically ordered in 56 and 57 above, we order
that each party keep his or her assets. Apart from the obvious practical
advantages, such an arrangement is also a just and equitable way of separating
the parties’ assets.

Conclusion

**_

62\. In the result, Chia’s appeal fails and is dismissed. To the extent we
have varied the order made below, Kay’s appeal is allowed. Arising from our
determination of the several issues above, there may be consequential orders
which are required to be made by reason of the lapse of time between the order
made by the district judge and this judgment. Parties are at liberty to
submit, within seven days from the date hereof, a request in writing for such
consequential orders for consideration.

_**

  
Costs

**_

63\. We now turn to the question of costs. The order for costs made by the
district judge should stand and is to remain intact. Chia has failed in his
appeal but Kay has succeeded substantially in her appeal, and we do not see
why costs of the appeals to the High Court and before us should not follow the
event. Accordingly, we award to Kay the costs of the appeals before the High
Court and before us, but as both the appeals were heard together there should
be only one bill of costs for both the appeals, as if there were only one
appeal. The deposit as security for costs, with interest, if any, in Chia’s
appeal is to be paid to Kay or her solicitors to account of costs, and the
deposit as security for costs, with interest, if any, in Kay’s appeal is to be
refunded to her or her solicitors.
