Aedit Abdullah J:

Introduction

1 The plaintiff sued the defendant in defamation for the defendant having
shared on Facebook an article titled “Breaking News: Singapore Lee Hsien Loong
Becomes 1MDB’s Key Investigation Target – Najib Signed Several Unfair
Agreements with Hsien Loong In Exchange For Money Laundering” (the “Article”).

Agreed Bundle of Documents (“AB”) Volume II 1155 to 1157.

The defendant had done this by sharing a hyperlink to the Article in a post on
his Facebook Timeline (the “Post”) for about three days, during which time the
Post attracted multiple responses from individuals who had seen it. 2

2 AB 1168 to 1171.

2 The parties raised a total of nine issues in this trial, which may be
broadly categorised as issues relating to (a) meaning, (b) publication and re-
publication, (c) quantum and loss, and (d) the available remedies, including
whether or not these proceedings were an abuse of process.

The Relevant Background to the Dispute

Brief facts

3 As I had previously outlined the salient facts of this dispute in an earlier
judgment on the striking out of the defendant’s counterclaim in the tort of
abuse of process (see Lee Hsien Loong v Leong Sze Hian [2019] SGHC 66), I will
only briefly set out the facts most pertinent to the instant dispute.

4 The plaintiff, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, 3

brings this suit in his personal capacity. The defendant is, among other
roles, a columnist who describes himself as a well-known campaigner for human
rights and a government critic. 4

LHL at [5] and [6].

It is uncontested that the defendant’s Facebook page is in his own name, and
that he owns and manages the Facebook account from which the Post which forms
the subject of this Suit was posted.

5 On or around 7 November 2018, the Article was published on a website titled
“The Coverage”. “The Coverage” describes itself as a Malaysia-based social
news network. The Article stated, inter alia, that ongoing Malaysian
investigations concerning Malaysia’s 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”)
fund were “trying to find the secret deals between the two corrupted Prime
Ministers of Singapore and Malaysia”. It is not in contention that this
referred to the plaintiff and former Malaysian Prime Minister Mr Najib Razak.
The Article also referenced several “unfair agreements” that Mr Najib Razak
had entered into with the plaintiff, including the agreement to build the
Singapore-Malaysia High Speed Rail, and included other details about the
alleged investigations.

6 At around 6.16pm on 7 November 2018, the defendant shared a link to the
Article in the Post on his Facebook Timeline. 5

2 AB 1168 and 1169.

The Timeline on a Facebook user’s profile page sets out some of their Facebook
activity. Among other functions, the Timeline showcases a user’s posts in
roughly reverse chronological order, with the most recent post generally
appearing first. The defendant did not include any accompanying text or
commentary in the Post, which simply indicated that the defendant had shared a
link, with part of the Article’s title and an image from the Article being
displayed, as shown below:

The plaintiff identified the words of the Article’s title which are displayed
in the Post as the “Offending Words in the Post”, while the words in the
Article, including the title, were described in the plaintiff’s pleadings as
the “Offending Words in the Article”. For ease of reference (and without
acknowledging that the words are necessarily defamatory), I will refer to
these words in both the Post and the Article collectively as the “defamatory
words”.

7 By 10.16pm on 7 November 2018, the defendant’s Post had attracted 22
“reactions”, five “comments”, and 18 “shares”. 6

2 AB 1169.

The Post had been made on the “Public” setting, meaning that other Facebook
users apart from the defendant’s “friends” on Facebook would be able to view
it.

8 The defendant removed the Post from his Facebook page at about 7.30am on 10
November 2018, after he read a notice from the Info-communications Media
Development Authority (“IMDA”) that had been sent to him at around 11.00pm on
9 November 2018. 7

9 Various media outlets covered the Article over 8 and 9 November 2018,

the Straits Times reported responses by the Minister for Law and Home Affairs,
Mr K Shanmugam, 8

The responses reported uniformly sought to refute the Article and its

10 On 9 November 2018, it was further reported in the Straits Times that the
Monetary Authority of Singapore had filed a police report in respect of an
article materially similar to the Article in question which had been published
on 5 November 2018 on the States Times Review (the “STR”), a website which
claims to be an Australia-based blog covering Singapore news. 10

11 As outlined earlier, the defendant removed the Post from his Facebook
Timeline on 10 November 2018. On 12 November 2018, he received a Letter of
Demand from the plaintiff’s then-solicitors, Drew & Napier LLC, demanding,
inter alia, a published apology and compensation. 12

##### Foot Note 12

2 AB 1271 to 1274.

This letter does not appear to have been replied to. On 20 November 2018, the
plaintiff commenced the instant suit.

Procedural history

12 The defendant previously sought to mount a counterclaim against the
plaintiff in the tort of abuse of process. The plaintiff applied in SUM
148/2019 for the said counterclaim to be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of
the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) (“ROC”). That application was
granted, and the appeal against that decision was dismissed.

13 The defendant had also applied to strike out the plaintiff’s claim in SUM
428/2019 (“SUM 428”), but was unsuccessful. This application was heard
together with SUM 148/2019.

14 At trial, two witnesses were called for the plaintiff – himself, and Dr
Phan Tuan Quang (“Dr Phan”). At the close of the plaintiff’s case, the
defendant made a submission of no case to answer. The effect of such a
submission is set out in greater detail below, but it suffices to note at this
point that the defendant acknowledged that his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
(“AEIC”) would therefore not be admitted into evidence, and elected not to
give any evidence in these proceedings. I subsequently directed that parties
make written submissions before further oral arguments were heard before me on
30 November 2020.

The Issues

15 The issues which the parties have identified and joined issue over are as
follows: 13

Plaintiff’s Opening Statement at [1].

(a) Whether the Offending Words in the Post, in their natural and ordinary
meaning, meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was complicit in
criminal activity relating to 1MDB;

(b) Whether the Offending Words in the Article, in their natural and ordinary
meaning, meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff corruptly used
his position as Prime Minister to help Mr Najib Razak launder 1MDB’s funds;

(c) Whether there was substantial publication in Singapore of the Offending
Words in the Post and/or the Offending Words in the Article;

(d) Whether there was republication in Singapore of the Offending Words in the
Post and/or the Offending Words in the Article;

(e) Whether, by reason of the publication and/or republication of the Post
and/or the Article, the plaintiff has been gravely injured in his character
and reputation, and has been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt;

(f) Whether the defendant aggravated the libels;

(g) Whether there was malice on the part of the defendant;

(h) Whether the plaintiff’s decision to issue these proceedings against the
defendant was an abuse of process; and

(i) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs he is claiming and if so,
what is the quantum of damages which he is entitled to?

16 In this judgment, I will address the issues in the following order:

(a) The effect of the submission of no case to answer;

(b) What the meaning of the defamatory words is;

(c) Whether the defendant has substantially published and/or republished the
defamatory words;

(d) Whether the defendant has caused the plaintiff loss;

(e) Whether there has been an abuse of process; and

(f) What the appropriate remedies are.

The Law on a Submission of No Case to Answer

17 The law on a submission of no case to answer is well-settled following the
recent decision by a five-member coram of the Court of Appeal in Ma Hongjin v
SCP Holdings Pte Ltd [2020] SGCA 106 at [32] and [33] that:

32 In summary, the plaintiff does indeed bear the legal burden of proving its
case against the defendant in a civil case on a balance of probabilities.
Where the defendant has made a submission of no case to answer, this
particular standard of proof is met or discharged by the plaintiff satisfying
the court that there is a prima facie case on each of the essential elements
of its claim. This is because in a situation where the defendant has made a
submission of no case to answer, such a submission must be coupled with an
election not to call evidence (pursuant to the principle laid down in Ho Yew
Kong [v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters [2018] 2 SLR
333 (“Ho Yew Kong”)]), with the result being that if the plaintiff has
established a prima facie case on the facts in issue (that are essential to
its claim), this would essentially result in the court finding that the
plaintiff has discharged its burden of proving the aforementioned facts on a
balance of probabilities. This is due to the fact that, upon the plaintiff
establishing a prima facie case with respect to the relevant facts in issue,
the evidential burden will shift to the defendant. However, because the
defendant has had (in the situation of a submission of no case to answer) to
elect to call no evidence, it would be unable to adduce (any) evidence to
either disprove the plaintiff’s position or weaken it such that the facts that
the plaintiff relies upon are “not proved” …

33 We therefore affirm that, in the situation where the defendant has
submitted that it has no case to answer and has (as it legally must) also
elected to call no evidence if it fails in this submission, the plaintiff
would succeed if it can establish that it has a prima facie case on each of
the essential elements of its claim. For the avoidance of doubt (and also for
the reasons stated above, the plaintiff would (simultaneously) have
necessarily proved its (overall) case against the defendant on a balance of
probabilities.

[Emphasis original]

18 Thus, a defendant who elects to make a submission of no case to answer must
make an accompanying election not to call evidence in the event that
submission fails. The defendant here has so elected. Following from that, the
plaintiff will succeed so long as he can establish that he has a prima facie
case on each of the essential elements of his claim.

19 As the Court of Appeal observed in Lena Leowardi v Yeap Cheen Soo [2015] 1
SLR 581 (“Lena Leowardi”) at [24], in assessing whether the plaintiff has
managed to establish a prima facie case, the Court will assume that any
evidence led by the plaintiff is true, unless it is inherently incredible or
against common sense. Further, as noted by the Court in Relfo Ltd v Bhimji
Velji Jadva Varsani [2008] 4 SLR(R) 657 at [20], if circumstantial evidence is
relied on by the plaintiff in a situation where the defendant has made a
submission of no case to answer, the circumstantial evidence does not have to
give rise to an irresistible inference as long as the desired inference is one
of the possible inferences which might arise.

20 Viewed holistically, it is only if (a) the plaintiff’s evidence, at face
value, does not establish a case in law, or (b) the evidence led by the
plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that his burden of proof has not
been discharged that a submission of no case to answer by a defendant
succeeds: Bansal Hemant Govindprasad v Central Bank of India [2003] 2 SLR(R)
33 from [14] to [16].

21 A further issue which arises for my determination is whether or not an
adverse inference should be drawn against the defendant for failing to testify
or adduce evidence in his defence. The plaintiff contends that in certain
circumstances, a defendant’s silence may be construed as strengthening the
plaintiff’s case. The plaintiff points to Thio Keng Poon v Thio Syn Pyn and
others and another appeal [2010] 3 SLR 143 (“Thio Keng Poon”) at [43], where
the Court of Appeal approved the views of Brooke LJ in the English Court of
Appeal decision of Wisniewski v Central Manchester Health Authority [1998]
PIQR P324 at 340, that:

(1) In certain circumstances a court may be entitled to draw adverse
inferences from the absence or silence of a witness who might be expected to
have material evidence to give on an issue in an action.

(2) If a court is willing to draw such inferences, they may go to strengthen
the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party or to weaken the
evidence, if any, adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected
to call the witness.

(3) There must, however, have been some evidence, however weak, adduced by the
former on the matter in question before the court is entitled to draw the
desired inference: in other words, there must be a case to answer on that
issue.

(4) If the reason for the witness’s absence or silence satisfies the court,
then no such adverse inference may be drawn. If, on the other hand, there is
some credible explanation given, even if it [is] not wholly satisfactory, the
potentially detrimental effect of his/her absence or silence may be reduced or
nullified.

[Emphasis original from Thio Keng Poon]

Furthermore, an adverse inference will not be drawn immediately against the
defendants simply because they chose to submit that there was no case to
answer: Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004
(“Lim Eng Hock Peter (HC)”) at [209].

22 In this case, the plaintiff contends that an adverse inference may be drawn
against a defendant who has made a submission of no case to answer if there is
no credible explanation for his silence. The defendant did not appear to
contest this proposition in principle. Rather, the crux of the defendant’s
response in this regard was twofold: that (a) the defendant had good reason to
not provide evidence, and (b) in any event, any adverse inference could only
go towards the issue of whether the defendant was maliciously motivated, since
that was the only issue of fact on which the defendant’s evidence might have
been of assistance. However, whether the defendant was maliciously motivated
was an issue which went towards the aggravation of damages, rather than
towards establishing the defendant’s liability. Accordingly, the defendant
took the view that any adverse inference, even if made, would not assist the
plaintiff in substantiating the defendant’s liability.

23 In my view, no adverse inference can be drawn here. As noted in Lim Eng
Hock Peter (HC) at [209], an adverse inference does not automatically arise
simply because of a submission that there is no case. An adverse inference can
generally be properly drawn if there is something in the evidence that
effectively demands an answer or response from the defendant, such as where
the evidence all points to him and it is apparent that things could be made
clear simply through his evidence coming in. It would otherwise be rare for an
adverse inference to be drawn, and I reject the plaintiff’s argument as
lowering the threshold far too much.

The Appropriate Meaning to be Attributed to the Allegedly Defamatory Words

24 The plaintiff asserts that the defamatory words meant that (a) the
plaintiff was complicit in 1MDB-related criminal activity, and (b) the
plaintiff used his position as Prime Minister to help Mr Najib launder money
from 1MDB.

25 As held by the Court of Appeal, the appropriate meaning to be attributed to
allegedly defamatory words is their “natural and ordinary meaning”, with such
meaning to be determined by reference to an ordinary reasonable person, not
unduly suspicious or avid for scandal, using his general knowledge and common
sense, including inferences from such general knowledge and experience: Review
Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal [2010] 1
SLR 52 (“Review Publishing”) at [27] to [31], and [81]. The intention of the
defendant is irrelevant in determining the meaning of the impugned words: Slim
and others v Daily Telegraph Ltd and others [1968] 2 QB 157 at 172, as applied
in Low Tuck Kwong v Sukamto Sia [2014] 1 SLR 639 at [36].

26 In both Review Publishing at [81], and Lee Hsien Loong v Roy Ngerng Yi Ling
[2014] SGHC 230 at [32], the Court observed that the ordinary reasonable
person is assumed to possess general knowledge and experience of worldly
affairs. This general knowledge extends to matters of current affairs which
have entered the public consciousness. The various matters canvassed by the
Plaintiff do point to a general knowledge that there was wrongdoing in the
affairs of 1MDB. In particular, several news reports indicated that (a) funds
had been corruptly defalcated, (b) efforts were underway in various countries
to try to recover them, and (c) Mr Najib was involved, along with a number of
persons based in Singapore, Malaysia, and abroad. 14

Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions (“PCS”) at [13].

This general knowledge concerning the misuse of 1MDB funds may be said to have
arisen from, inter alia, the following sources:

(a) On 2 July 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that Malaysian
investigators investigating 1MDB had traced nearly US$ 700 m of deposits into
what they believed were the personal bank accounts of Mr Najib;

(b) On 5 July 2015, the Straits Times reported that Malaysian authorities had
raided several Malaysian firms in connection with the funds that Mr Najib was
alleged to have received from 1MDB;

(c) On 20 July 2016, the United States Department of Justice announced through
a press release that it had filed civil forfeiture complaints seeking the
forfeiture and recovery of more than US$ 1 bn in assets associated with an
international conspiracy to launder funds misappropriated from 1MDB. This was
also reported in the Straits Times;

(d) On 2 September 2016, the Straits Times reported that it was Mr Najib whom
the United States Department of Justice alleged had received large sums of
1MDB’s funds through his personal accounts;

(e) In 2016 and 2017, it was reported by the Straits Times and Channel News
Asia that a number of bankers in Singapore had been charged with and convicted
of money laundering and other offences in connection with 1MDB;

(f) On 21 May 2018, the Straits Times reported that the Malaysian government
was investigating possible criminal conduct in relation to 1MDB, and had
raided several residences linked to Mr Najib;

(g) Over the course of July to September 2018, the Straits Times and Channel
News Asia reported on the charges which Mr Najib faced. These included charges
of criminal breach of trust, money laundering, and abuse of power.

In any event, the defendant does not appear to seriously contend that
knowledge of 1MDB and its association with corruption, abuse of power, and
fraud is not within the scope of the reasonable person’s general knowledge.

27 The defendant’s Post, as reproduced above, states that he has shared a
link, from THECOVERAGE.MY, with the following text: 15

Breaking News: Singapore Lee Hsien Long Becomes 1MDB’s Key Investigation
Target – Najib Signed Several Unfair …

28 The title of the Article, which was linked from the Post, was:

Breaking News: Singapore Lee Hsien Loong Becomes 1 MDB’s Key Investigation
Target – Najib Signed Several Unfair Agreements with Hsien Loong in Exchange
of Money Laundering.

29 The phrase “Lee Hsien Loong becomes 1 MDB’s key investigation target”
clearly suggests that the plaintiff was involved at the heart of the 1MDB-
related wrongdoing. After all, the connotation of one having become a “key”
investigation target points strongly towards one’s deep involvement in the
1MDB scandal. The 1MDB scandal has also become, in effect, a byword for
corruption and improper governmental dealings, and the average reader of the
Post and/or Article would be amply aware of this given the multitude of news
articles on the topic. 16

##### Foot Note 16

See PCS at [13].

Moreover, the title of the Article further suggests that various “unfair”
agreements had been entered into between the plaintiff and Mr Najib, which
were the result of a quid pro quo with the plaintiff providing the assistance
of Singapore banks in laundering stolen money. Against the backdrop of
allegations of criminality surrounding the defalcation within 1MDB, the
defendant’s Post extracting part of the title of the Article, and the Article
itself, attract the meaning that the plaintiff is corrupt and, at the very
least, implicated in the wrongdoing associated with 1MDB. The Article, in
particular, clearly insinuates that the plaintiff was involved in criminal
activities in order to obtain agreement on various deals with Mr Najib. The
following extracts from the Article speak for themselves:

Breaking News : Singapore Lee Hsien loong Becomes 1MDB’s Key Investigation
Target – Najib Signed Several Unfair Agreements With Hsien Loong In Exchange
For Money Laundering

It is believed that Najib Razak signed several unfair agreements with
Singapore’s Lee Hsien Loong, like building the Singapore-Malaysia High Speed
Rail when the country was in a trillion RM debt and a grossly under-priced
water sale agreement, in exchange for Singapore banks’ assistance in money
laundering 1MDB’s billions.

If found guilty, Lee Hsien Loong and Singapore may be sanctioned
internationally.

[…]

Malaysian investigators are now trying to find the secret deals between the
two corrupted Prime Ministers of Singapore and Malaysia when Najib was still
in power. It is believed that Najib Razak signed several unfair agreements
with Singapore’s Lee Hsien Loong … in exchange for Singapore bank’s assistance
in money laundering 1MDB’s billions.

If found guilty, Lee Hsien Loong and Singapore may be sanctioned
internationally.

Singapore was forced to reopen the 1MDB investigation after the Najib Razak
dictatorship was voted out of power, despite closing it a year ago in May
2017. After Malaysians voted in a new government. The Singapore government was
immediately summoned for questioning in Kuala Lumpur. According to a source
closed [sic] with the dictator, Lee Hsien Loong refused to be personally
interviewed.

The new Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad has been keeping his
distance away from Lee Hsien Loong after his election. Just last week, the
Malaysian PM rejected Lee Hsien Loong’s invite for a holiday retreat and
called for a bilateral discussion to increase water price.

[Emphasis in bold original, emphasis added in underline]

30 The reference to the news sources cited at [26] above is not reliance on
extrinsic evidence in construing the meaning of words, which is prohibited by
cases such as Review Publishing at [29] and Bank of China v Asiaweek Ltd
[1991] 1 SLR(R) 230 at [16]. As the plaintiff has argued, the Court in Lee
Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party [2007] 1 SLR 675 accepted that news
reports could be considered in determining how widely known certain facts are,
and thus how an ordinary reasonable person would identify the natural and
ordinary meaning of the words used. Given the sheer volume of reporting on the
issue, the facts surrounding the 1MDB episode cannot be said to go beyond the
ordinary reasonable person’s general knowledge. Furthermore, the point of the
extrinsic evidence rule is that reference to such extrinsic evidence may take
the meaning of the allegedly defamatory words out of their natural and
ordinary meaning, such that the meaning then would really be one of innuendo:
Goh Chok Tong v Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam [1997] 3 SLR(R) 46 at [93] to
[100]. A case founded on innuendo would have to be specifically pleaded.
However, there is no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff is in fact relying
on some covert innuendo meaning on the instant facts. As observed by the Court
in Gordon Berkeley Jones v Clement John Skelton [1963] 1 WLR 1362 from 1370 to
1371, what counts as impermissible extrinsic fact for the purpose of the
extrinsic evidence rule is something that goes beyond general knowledge.

31 There was also some argument between the parties about the Chase meanings
as laid down in Chase v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 1772
(“Chase”) at [45]. 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

See, for example, PCS at [54] et seq and Defendant’s Closing Submissions
(“DCS”) at [23] et seq.

I am doubtful though that this was, in the end, useful. Such determination of
meaning was considered in Chase in the context of determining what was to be
put forward in a defence of justification. One must bring in sufficient
evidence to show the truth of what was asserted, which must in turn be
dependent on what exactly was asserted. This thus gave rise to the need to
calibrate, by reference to the three levels of Chase meanings, what
specifically was said in a libel. At [46] of Chase, Brooke LJ traced the
distinction in levels of meaning to Lord Devlin in Rubber Improvement Ltd and
another v Daily Telegraph [1964] AC 234 at 282:

I do not mean that ingenuity should be expended in devising and setting out
different shades of meaning. Distinct meanings are what should be pleaded; and
a reasonable test of distinctness would be whether the justification would be
substantially different. In the present case, for example, there could have
been three different categories of justification – proof of the fact of an
inquiry, proof of reasonable grounds for it, and proof of guilt.

Given that no plea of justification has been raised here, I could not see that
reliance on Chase was useful in the analysis. In any event, I note the
observation in Ng Koo Kay Benedict and another v Zim Integrated Shipping
Services Ltd [2010] 2 SLR 860 (“Ng Koo Kay Benedict”) at [17] that “All three
[Chase] levels are generally regarded as being defamatory, though in varying
degrees”. At highest, therefore, the defendant appears to contend that the
effect of the defamatory words was not particularly impactful. However, this
is simply not borne out on the facts, particularly in relation to the Article.
In the Article, specific allegations are made regarding the plaintiff’s
corruption, notably in relation to the provision of Singapore banks’
assistance in laundering 1MDB funds. Moreover, as the defendant himself
acknowledges, relying on Stocker v Stocker [2020] AC 593 from [41] to [46], a
reader casually parsing a Facebook post adopts an impressionistic and fleeting
response. 18

##### Foot Note 18

DCS at [20] to [22].

He may not be entirely alive to the nuances of the Chase levels, and may
instead only draw a loose and imprecise association between the wording of the
Post and/or Article, and the criminality associated with 1MDB. Whatever the
case, I do not find that the defendant can reasonably claim that the
defamatory words did not impugn the plaintiff’s character and suggest that the
plaintiff was, at the very least, involved in serious and dishonest criminal
activity (see also [29] above).

Whether the Defendant has Substantially Published or Republished the
Defamatory Words

32 There are two sub-issues that arise in relation to the question of whether
or not there has been substantial publication or republication by the
defendant of the defamatory words:

(a) Whether the Post on Facebook amounts to publication of defamatory
material;

(b) Whether hyperlinking to the Article amounts to publication of defamatory
material;

Both questions may be answered in the affirmative on the instant facts.

Publication

33 The plaintiff bases his claim on both the Post, and the Article that was
linked in the Post. As explained above, the Article was accessible through the
Post, by way of a hyperlink.

34 The defendant accepts that he is responsible for having published the Post,
though he contends that there has not been any “substantial” publication as
not many individuals accessed and read the Post. 19

##### Foot Note 19

DCS at [2(a)].

As for the Article, the defendant’s position is that he is not responsible for
its publication because there is no evidence that anyone clicked on it as a
result of his sharing the Post. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

DCS at [2(b)].

35 Implicit in the defendant’s position on the Article, however, is a
recognition that had individuals clicked on the Article as a result of his
sharing the Post, he would be responsible for publication of the Article. Put
another way, the defendant does not appear to deny that providing a hyperlink
to a separate article in a post can, in principle, be a basis for a finding
that there has been publication of that article.

36 On the facts of this case, I find that there has been publication by the
defendant of the Post. The defendant has conceded as much. The issue of how
substantial the publication was will be dealt with subsequently, when I
consider the question of quantum (see below from [92] to [106]). For the
moment, it suffices for me to note the view of Belinda Ang J (as she then was)
in Qingdao Bohai Construction Group Co, Ltd and others v Goh Teck Beng and
another [2016] 4 SLR 977 (“Qingdao Bohai”) at [61] and [136] that
“substantial” publication simply refers to publication to a “sufficient number
[of readers] to justify judgment for damages”. This, I should add, simply
means that there must have been a real and substantial tort, and that the
publication must not be, in effect, de minimis. As I will go on to explain,
the instant publication can hardly be said to not have been substantial in
Singapore.

37 As for the Article, I also find that it has been published by the
defendant. This arises on two bases: First, because the Article is part of the
Post, by virtue of having been hyperlinked from the Post. Second, because the
Article itself has been published because the defendant has made it
accessible, and individuals within Singapore have, through his link, accessed
it. In my view, there is a platform of facts which suffices for me to rely on
either of those two bases to conclude that there has been publication of the
Article.

38 Turning to the first basis for finding that the Article has been published
by the defendant, the reasoning is fairly straightforward: insofar as the
Article forms part of the Post, and the Post has itself been published, the
Article (and its content) can be said to have been published as well.

39 Support for this proposition may be drawn from the view of Nicklin J in
Daniel Poulter MP v Times Newspapers Limited [2018] 3900 QB (“Poulter”) at
[21]:

The position seems to me to be different in relation to the online
publication. I noted in Falter v Altzmon [2018] EWHC 1728 QB that the rule
from Charleston that readers are taken to read the whole of a publication has
its limits in relation to links provided in an online version of an article:

[12] The Internet provides a degree of challenge to [the] orthodoxy [of
Charleston] because it is possible to set out in on-line publications many
hyperlinks to external material. It is perhaps unrealistic to proceed on the
basis that every reader will follow all the hyperlinks, but everything depends
on its context. For example, if in a single tweet there is a single statement
that says, “X is a liar” and then a hyperlink is given, it is almost an
irresistible inference to conclude that the ordinary reasonable reader would
have to follow the hyperlink in order to make sense of what was being said. At
the other end of the spectrum, a very long article could contain a very large
number of hyperlinks. Only the most tenacious or diligent reader could be
expected to follow every single one of those hyperlinks. Such a reader could
hardly be described as the ordinary reasonable reader. How many links any
individual reader would follow would depend on an individual’s interest in or
knowledge of the subject matter or perhaps other particular reasons for
investigating each of the hyperlinks in question.

Of particular note from this extract is the view that if only a single
statement is made, and one hyperlink given, it is “almost an irresistible
inference” to conclude that the ordinary reasonable reader would follow the
hyperlink, thus triggering the rule in Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd
[1995] 2 AC 65 that the material has to be read holistically and in full. It
also bears note that the defendant himself relies on Poulter, and in fact on
this specific extract at [21] of that case.

40 The instant facts, however, are not directly akin to the situation
highlighted in Poulter, where an almost “irresistible inference” would be
drawn. The main difference is that the defendant simply shared a link (with
some of the text of the title of the linked Article shown), without any
comment of his own. If there were some comment from the poster either
endorsing or disparaging the linked remarks or the article, then the
determination would be reasonably clear. But, if nothing else is appended,
then whether the provision of the link amounts to a publication would have to
be more carefully considered.

41 On one view, a bare link is all that it is: there is no publication,
because all that is in fact published is the hyperlink, which on clicking,
would bring the reader elsewhere. This would appear to be the position taken
in Canada in the decision of the majority in Crookes v Newton [2011] 3 SCR
269. Specifically, Abella J (Binnie, LeBel, Charron, Rothstein, and Cromwell
JJ concurring) held at [44] that “… in my view the use of a hyperlink cannot,
by itself, amount to publication even if the hyperlink is followed and the
defamatory content is accessed”. This somewhat absolute position was heavily
influenced by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and has not been
followed in both Australia (see for example, Bailey v Bottrill (No 2) [2019]
ACTSC 167 at [54]) and England (see for example, Caine v Advertiser and Times
Ltd & Ors [2019] EWHC 2278 (QB) at [61], relying on the decision of the
European Court of Human Rights in Magyar Jeti Zrt v Hungary [2018] 12 WLUK 615
at [77]). In any event, I am not persuaded that Abella J’s position should be
adopted in Singapore. It is not only predicated heavily on an instrument which
does not have effect in Singapore, but more fundamentally, ousts an entire
species of publication from potentially being defamatory without closer
examination on the facts of what a bare hyperlink, with no added commentary,
might convey in all the circumstances. A more holistic assessment should be
preferred, and it is for that reason that I find the English and Australian
cases I have cited above to be of greater utility on the facts. A fact-centric
analysis should be pursued.

42 Considering the relevant facts and circumstances, I am satisfied that the
Article should be construed as part of the Post for the following reasons:

(a) First, the link to the Article was the only substantive content of the
Post. Apart from the link, the only other content in the Post was an extract
of the text of the Article’s title, and a photo from the Article. The entire
content of the Post was, in effect, the Article, and it would be artificial to
draw a bright-line distinction between the two.

(b) Second, there does not appear to be any other plausible interpretation of
the link to the Article in the Post apart from the defendant in some way
supporting or endorsing the content in the link. The entirety of his message
in the Post centred around the link to the Article, and he was at the very
least drawing attention to the Article and providing access to it in the Post.
Further, an interpretation that the defendant was endorsing the content of the
Article would cohere with his own self-described role as a “staunch government
critic”. 21

This descriptor is present on, inter alia, the defendant’s own website.

(c) Third, as alluded to at [19] above, one effect of the defendant’s
submission of no case to answer is that the plaintiff does not need to
establish an irresistible inference that the Article was part of the Post. All
that is required is for the plaintiff to show that the desired inference is
one of the possible inferences.

43 In addition, I note two Singaporean decisions pertaining to when
publication online suffices as publication for the purposes of defamation. In
both Qingdao Bohai at [35] and Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v Kairos
Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another [2015] 2 SLR 751 (“Golden Season”) at
[54], the High Court held that publication by the defendant occurred if (a)
the defamatory statements were made available online, and (b) the defamatory
material was received by a third party in such a way that it is understood and
intelligible. (The related but separate question of where such publication
occurred is determined by where the reader or end user accesses the statement:
Ng Koo Kay Benedict at [26]). This implies that a Facebook post which carries
a link, and which makes the defamatory statement available, would count as a
publication if it could be established that third parties had accessed that
link. In contrast, and subject of course to the precise facts, a hypothetical
Facebook post that merely referred or alerted other users to the existence of
the original defamatory statement, without carrying a link, might not count as
publication. I do note that it is perhaps easier for a Facebook user to post
or a share a link to the original statement than to compose and type out an
entirely new statement alerting others to the original, but such ease of
posting or sharing cannot rescue a post from being publication for the
purposes of defamation.

44 The decisions in Qingdao Bohai and Golden Season are decisions of
coordinate jurisdiction, and therefore not binding on me. But, with respect,
their approach is sound in principle. Given that it is common ground that the
defendant did make the Article available online by linking to it in the Post
(thus satisfying the first requirement set out in Qingdao Bohai and Golden
Season), the next issue is whether the second requirement, that a third party
has accessed the defamatory material in an intelligible form, is met. 22

##### Foot Note 22

DCS at [2(a)].

45 On the basis of what has been described as a “platform of facts”, there is
at least a prima facie case that the Article had been accessed through the
link in the Post in an intelligible form. In Koh Sin Chong Freddie v Chan
Cheng Wah Bernard and others and another appeal [2013] 4 SLR 629 (“Koh Sin
Chong Freddie”) at [43] and [44], the Court of Appeal accepted that a platform
of facts could be established from which the Court could properly infer that
substantial publication had taken place. Some of the considerations which
might form the basis for this platform of facts are as follows:

(a) First, the number of “likes”, “shares”, “reactions” and comments which a
post draws might provide insight into the number of individuals who accessed
it, especially since not every individual who reads the post will necessarily
respond in such a fashion: Bolton v Stoltenberg [2018] NSWSC 1518 at [154] and
[155], as upheld in Stoltenberg v Bolton; Loder v Bolton [2020] NSWCA 45 at
[102];

(b) Second, the number of “friends” and “followers” the poster has on the
relevant social media platform is also relevant in determining whether or not
substantial publication has taken place: Pritchard v Van Nes [2016] BCJ No.
781 at [83];

(c) Third, setting the privacy settings of the relevant post to “public” is
also more likely to give rise to an inference that the defamatory statement
had been accessed by third parties and that substantial publication arose:
Doris Chia, Defamation: Principles and Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia
(LexisNexis, 2016) (“Doris Chia”) at [15.10] and [15.11].

46 On the facts, it is uncontested that 45 persons responded to the Post
containing the link to the Article in the manner outlined at [45(a)] above. It
is similarly common ground that, at the material time, the defendant had about
5,000 Facebook friends, and 149 “followers”. Moreover, the privacy settings of
the Post had been set to “public”. Given this evidence, I consider it
exceedingly unlikely that it could seriously be the case that not a single
person accessed the Article through the link in the Post. To my mind,
insisting on direct evidence of such access is unrealistic, and does not
reflect the simple truth of how hyperlinks are used on the internet. In any
event, the circumstantial evidence outlined here does not need to give rise to
an irresistible inference given the defendant’s submission of no case to
answer. All that is required is that the desired inference is one of the
possible inferences: Lena Leowardi at [24], Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction
Pte Ltd [2012] 2 SLR 549 at [37]. I am satisfied that, on the facts outlined
above, it is at least a possible inference that a third party had accessed the
Article through the link on the Post, and that there had thus been publication
of the Article.

47 In sum, there appears to me to be ample basis to find that both the Post
and the Article have been published. The question of whether there has been
substantial publication is considered more fully below from [92] to [106],
where I conclude that there has been publication to a sufficient number of
persons in Singapore to warrant substantial damages.

Whether the boundaries of defamation should take into account alternative
regimes

48 An issue that I asked the parties to address me on was whether the
enactment of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Act
19 of 2019) (“POFMA”), potentially providing an alternative cause of action,
should have any effect on defamation law. The defendant asserts that the POFMA
has a direct and significant impact on defamation in that in circumstances
where the facts of a case might be caught by the provisions of the POFMA, it
should not be open to an individual to be able to bypass the Act and sue in
defamation. The defendant contends that this would deny a citizen the
protections built into the POFMA, and potentially upset the balance struck by
Parliament in an act of “constitutional heresy”. 23

By contrast, the plaintiff argues that the POFMA is separate from and has not
changed the law of defamation in Singapore.

49 I am satisfied that the POFMA does not alter the law of defamation in
Singapore. Given the stated purpose of the POFMA, and in particular the clear
indication in the Ministerial speeches during the Second Reading of the
Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill that the Act was not
intended to alter the law of defamation, I did not see how the defendant’s
position on the POFMA was at all tenable. Moreover, there was a marked absence
of any provisions that could be interpreted as effecting the change in the law
which the defendant asserted.

50 First, and in contradistinction to defamation, the POFMA is concerned with
falsehood rather than the harm caused to reputation as such. The preamble to
the POFMA describes it as “[a]n Act to prevent the electronic communication in
Singapore of false statements of fact, to suppress support for and counteract
the effects of such communication, to safeguard against the use of online
accounts for such communication and for information manipulation, to enable
measures to be taken to enhance transparency of online political
advertisements, and for related matters”. The purpose of the POFMA is thus to
avoid or minimise damage to the country and its people or public confidence in
the government and its agencies engendered by online falsehoods. However, the
POFMA does not provide individuals with any right or cause of action arising
from a false and defamatory allegation against them. This is a key
distinction. While the POFMA is aimed at online falsehoods which trigger
questions of the public interest, a defamation action is “fundamentally an
action to vindicate a person’s reputation on a matter as to which he has been
falsely defamed”, and the damages awarded in a defamation action “have to be
regarded as the demonstrative mark of that vindication”: Tang Liang Hong v Lee
Kuan Yew and another and other appeals [1997] 3 SLR(R) 576 at [128]. It bears
particular note that the POFMA does not introduce any causes of action for
individuals. Rather, it imposes criminal liability, which arises in the public
sphere and which is not a substitute for the tort of defamation, which
operates in the private sphere. I am guided by the observation of the Court of
Appeal in ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd and others [2017] 1 SLR 918 at [185]
that “a criminal prosecution is, by design, a matter between the State and an
accused person; it is not a mechanism for victims to seek vindication of their
private interests”. The POFMA and the law of defamation thus serve markedly
different ends, and I am unable to accept the defendant’s suggestion that the
latter has been constrained by the former.

51 I am fortified in my conclusion on this point by the clear and unequivocal
observations made in the Parliamentary Debates on the POFMA. In a response to
questions posed during the passage of the Protection from Online Falsehoods
and Manipulation Bill, Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam, made the following
observations: 24

##### Foot Note 24

Singapore Parliamentary Debates. Official Report (8 May 2019) vol 94, 8.01pm,
per Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam.

Ms Irene Quay asked about the relationship of this Bill with the Defamation
Act and the Internal Security Act.

The Defamation Act deals in the private law sphere, with damage to reputation.
For example, if someone says you are corrupt, then if it is not true, you can
sue to clear your name. And many people will want to.

The Internal Security Act (“ISA”) deals with threats to national security.
This Bill deals with falsehoods, to mitigate the impact and deter those who
deliberately peddle in falsehoods, with [a] specific framework that is
different from ISA.

52 I note in addition that there is not a single provision of the POFMA which
expressly deals with defamation. Parliament also did not, even in light of the
POFMA, amend any provisions in the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed) or the
provisions providing for criminal defamation at ss 499 to 502 of the Penal
Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Given such absence of any express reference to
defamation, or even to anything that could be construed as having any such
effect, it would be far too much for the Court to dramatically alter the law
of defamation in the manner sought by the plaintiff.

53 In any event, I note that the instant suit was commenced on 20 November
2018, while the POFMA was only passed on 8 May 2019. It is fairly settled that
legislation does not generally apply to actions which are pending at the time
the legislation comes into force unless the language of the legislation
compels the conclusion that Parliament intended that it should: Wilson and
others v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [2004] 1 AC 816 at [198]
and Zainal bin Hashim v Government of Malaysia [1980] AC 734 at 742C. I see no
basis to foist a retrospective application of the POFMA on the instant facts.

Article 14 of the Constitution

54 Turning then to freedom of speech, while Article 14(1)(a) of the
Constitution protects freedom of speech, it is expressly subject to such
restrictions as may be imposed by law by Parliament, including those which
protect against defamation: Art 14(2)(a). Thus, the right of free speech under
Art 14(1)(a) may be circumscribed by laws enacted to deal with defamation.

55 Several cases illustrate this point. In Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee
Kuan Yew [1990] 1 SLR(R) 337 at [5], the Court of Appeal expressly observed
that “the constitutional right of freedom of speech and expression is
unarguably restricted by the laws of defamation”. Observations to similar
effect have been made in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew [1992] 1
SLR(R) 791 at [61], and Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and
others and another suit [2009] 1 SLR(R) 642 at [102].

56 I add for completeness that, given my finding that the POFMA does not
infringe on the law of defamation, I do not see how the POFMA changes the
balance struck between the constraints imposed by the law of defamation on the
one hand, and the right to free speech and expression on the other. In any
event, the balance to be struck between the right to free speech and the
constraints which exist upon that right as a broad question is one for
Parliament to address: Review Publishing from [269] to [271]. In passing the
POFMA, while at the same time also making clear that the POFMA does not
infringe on the law of defamation, Parliament must be taken to have at least
tacitly endorsed the balance struck in the post-POFMA landscape. In any event,
the defendant himself appears to have accepted that Parliament has struck the
balance it deemed fit between freedom of expression and the private right to
reputation following the passage of POFMA. 25

57 I am therefore unable to accept that Art 14 of the Constitution
necessitates that I constrain the law of defamation in the defendant’s favour.
I note for completeness that the defendant has not sought to rely on Reynolds
privilege, as set out in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127, in
its submissions.

Whether the Defendant has Caused the Plaintiff Loss

58 The plaintiff argues that by virtue of the defendant’s substantial
publication and/or republication of the defamatory words, the plaintiff has
been gravely injured in his character and reputation, and has been brought
into public scandal, odium, and contempt. 26

##### Foot Note 26

PCS at [219].

The plaintiff’s case is that it therefore follows that loss was caused.

59 The defendant argues in response that (a) the Post and Article do not bear
the meaning contended by the plaintiff, (b) the Post and Article are not
defamatory, and (c) any damage to the plaintiff’s reputation has already been
vindicated and/or rebutted by a series of statements and articles from
government agencies and ministers refuting the allegedly defamatory meaning.
27

60 Having considered parties’ arguments, I find that loss was indeed caused.
Arguments (a) and (b) by the defendant have already been addressed above when
the meaning of the offending words was considered from [29] to [31]. The only
argument by the defendant relating primarily to the existence of loss,
argument (c), is the sole one which remains at this point. On that argument, I
find that the plaintiff’s reputation was harmed irrespective of the actions or
statements of the government agencies and ministers. I now turn to consider
this in greater detail.

The effect of the actions of the government agencies and ministers

61 The defendant relied on the actions taken by various government agencies
and ministers to counter the allegations in the Article. These actions
include, but are not limited to: 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

DCS at [102].

(a) On 8 November 2018, the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in
Malaysia indicated that the defamatory words were “fake news and clearly
libellous”;

(b) On or around 9 November 2018, Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Law and Home
Affairs, stated that the defamatory words were “absurd”, “false”, and that
“the police will take action against all involved”; and

(c) On or around the same day, the Monetary Authority of Singapore stated that
the defamatory words were “false and malicious” and that a police report had
been filed, while the IMDA released a statement that the defamatory words were
“baseless and defamatory”.

The defendant specifically emphasised that the above actions had been carried
out by individuals or institutions of high public standing, in credible
publications. Accordingly, it was contended that any harm caused by the
defamatory words was neutralised or in some sense ameliorated.

62 These actions and speeches did not, to my mind, reduce the harm caused to
the plaintiff’s reputation for the purposes of ascertaining if there had been
damage suffered in the tort of defamation. First, the law of defamation does
not require proof of actual damage to reputation: Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan
Yew and another and other appeals [1997] 3 SLR(R) 576 from [110] to [112].
Rather, the concern is with the effect on right-thinking members of society:
Sim v Stretch [1936] 2 All ER 1237 at 1240. The standard is notional or
fictional; one does not conduct a survey of a selected group of persons to
determine the effect of the defamatory words and the loss suffered. As long as
it is reasonable that one’s reputation could be harmed, it does not matter if
no one with such a view is in fact found and produced to the court.

63 The fact that there may be countervailing information provided or
statements made does not reduce or negate a defamation, particularly when
those statements or pieces of information do not even originate from the party
which is responsible for the defamation. The focus of the analysis on the
extent of the injury is on the effect of the alleged defamatory statement on
the claimant’s reputation. It is clear following Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam
Joshua Benjamin [1997] 3 SLR(R) 46 at [50] and [84] that even if a defamatory
imputation is so incredulous or outrageous that it would not be believed, such
an imputation would still be defamatory. This was explained on the basis that
if the incredulity of the imputation were a relevant consideration, it would
lead to the ironic situation where an extremely outrageous statement would
never be actionable simply because it was especially outrageous and
unbelievable. The claimant in such a context would never have a right to
vindicate his reputation were that to be the case. Of course, it would be
otherwise if the allegedly defamatory statement were, in and of itself, to be
taken as humour, for instance, but the point I underscore is that reference
must be had to the statement itself, rather than the countervailing or
refuting statements made by other sources.

64 I note also that an ironic or perverse situation, akin to that referred to
in Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin [1997] 3 SLR(R) 46, would arise
on the instant facts if the aggrieved party were held to in fact improve the
position of the defaming party simply because the aggrieved party tried to
refute defamatory allegations. It cannot be the case in the context of
defamation that simply speaking up for oneself to try and clear one’s own name
improves the position of the defamer, nor was any authority to that effect
cited to me.

Has there been an Abuse of Process and if so, what is its Effect

65 The defendant alleges that the instant proceedings are an abuse of process
on two bases:

(a) First, the defendant points to the rule in Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones &
Co Inc [2005] QB 946 (“Jameel”) that the plaintiff’s claim is an abuse of
process because it does not disclose a real and substantial tort;

(b) Second, the defendant argues that the plaintiff has brought the present
action in an attempt to circumvent the rule in Derbyshire v Times Newspapers
Limited [1993] AC 534 (“Derbyshire”) that a government cannot bring an action
in libel.

I am unable to accept that either of these bases is made out.

The doctrine in Jameel

66 In Jameel, the English Court of Appeal concluded that, as there had been no
real and substantial tort committed within England, it was an abuse of process
for the plaintiff in that case to pursue his claim. In Jameel, a foreign
claimant commenced proceedings for defamation in England against the publisher
of an American newspaper in respect of an article posted on a website in
America. The publisher, in response, adduced evidence which showed that only
five persons in the jurisdiction of the English courts had accessed the
website, of whom three were associates of the plaintiff. The publisher thus
applied to strike out the claim on the ground that it had no reasonable
prospect of success. In upholding the decision to strike out the claim, the
English Court of Appeal held that no real and substantial tort had been
committed within the jurisdiction, and that it would be an abuse of process
for the plaintiff to be permitted to proceed with his claim. This was despite
the publisher not having previously objected to the jurisdiction of the
English courts on the basis of forum non conveniens. The English Court of
Appeal specifically observed that even if the plaintiff succeeded, the
vindication it received would be minimal and the cost of the entire suit would
have been out of proportion to what had been achieved.

67 I have some difficulty with the conclusion the defendant invites me to draw
from Jameel, that the case applies wholesale to the instant facts to render
the plaintiff’s claim an abuse of process. First, it appears to me that the
decision in Jameel was animated in large part by developments unique to the
United Kingdom, and which find no ready parallel in Singapore. The application
of the reasoning and principles in Jameel to the Singapore context thus must
be highly fact-specific, and a broad-brush approach to applying Jameel does
not appear entirely appropriate. The Court in Jameel made the following
significant observations:

40 We accept that in the rare case where a claimant brings an action for
defamation in circumstances where his reputation has suffered no or minimal
actual damage, this may constitute an interference with freedom of expression
that is not necessary for the protection of the claimant’s reputation. In such
circumstances the appropriate remedy for the defendant may well be to
challenge the claimant’s resort to English jurisdiction or to seek to strike
out the action as an abuse of process …

54 … An abuse of process is of concern not merely to the parties but to the
court. It is no longer the role of the court simply to provide a level playing
field and to referee whatever game the parties choose to play upon it. The
court is concerned to ensure that judicial and court resources are
appropriately and proportionately used in accordance with the requirements of
justice …

55 There have been two recent developments which have rendered the court more
ready to entertain a submission that pursuit of a libel action is an abuse of
process. The first is the introduction of the new Civil Procedure Rules.
Pursuit of the overriding objective requires an approach by the court to
litigation that is both more flexible and more proactive. The second is the
coming into effect of the Human Rights Act 1998. Section 6 requires the court,
as a public authority, to administer the law in a manner which is compatible
with Convention rights, in so far as it is possible to do so. Keeping a proper
balance between the article 10 right of freedom of expression and the
protection of individual reputation must, so it seems to us, require the court
to bring to a stop as an abuse of process defamation proceedings that are not
serving the legitimate purpose of protecting the claimant’s reputation, which
includes compensating the claimant only if that reputation has been unlawfully
damaged.

[Emphasis added in italics and bold italics]

Neither the Civil Procedure Rules of England and Wales (“CPR”) nor the Human
Rights Act 1998 of the United Kingdom are directly applicable to Singapore.

68 Of course, that is not to say that the principles outlined in Jameel are of
no value in Singapore. Notably, the Court of Appeal made the following
observations on Jameel at [120] of Yan Jun v Attorney-General [2015] 1 SLR 752
(“Yan Jun”):

… In light of our decision above at [111]–[114], it is, strictly speaking, not
necessary for us to decide whether the Judge was correct in following Jameel.
That having been said, there is a relatively significant body of authority in
England endorsing the general principle established in Jameel, viz, that a
claim which discloses no real and substantial tort is liable to be struck out
for being an abuse of process of the court, and the real concerns (as we have
seen above) relate to its application. This last-mentioned point is not
surprising in view of the fact that the line-drawing required is not only
fact-centric but may also be difficult to effect in borderline situations.
Further, and leaving aside the differences in the rules of civil procedure
between England and Singapore, Jameel also contains some general principles
that may be applicable in the Singapore context. Hence, applying the principle
in Jameel to the facts of the present case, we would be of the view that this
was far from being a borderline situation and that the Judge was therefore
correct in following and applying Jameel and holding that the Appellant’s
claim in defamation did not disclose a real and substantial tort. This would
have served as a yet further reason as to why the Appellant’s claim in
defamation should fail.

[Emphasis original]

The upshot of this extract is twofold: First, there remain “real concerns”
with the precise application of Jameel, which must be highly fact-centric,
though certain general principles may be applicable to the Singapore context.
Second, the discussion of Jameel in Yan Jun proceeded on the basis that the
facts in Yan Jun did not disclose a “borderline” situation. Instead, it was
clear in that case that the claim for defamation in Yan Jun was not only
wholly untenable, but also that even if the claim had succeeded, any
vindication received would be out of all proportion to the cost of procuring
it. The reasoning in Jameel was merely a “yet further” (emphasis original)
reason as to why the claim should fail.

69 The second reason why I am reluctant to directly apply Jameel to the
present facts is because the reasoning in that decision centres in very large
part on the English Court’s concern with forum shopping. This is evident from
the face of Jameel itself at [70]:

If we were considering an application to set aside permission to serve these
proceedings out of the jurisdiction we would allow that application on the
basis that the five publications that had taken place in this jurisdiction did
not, individually or collectively, amount to a real and substantial tort.
Jurisdiction is no longer in issue, but, subject to the effect of the claim
for an injunction that we have yet to consider, we consider for precisely the
same reason that it would not be right to permit this action to proceed. It
would be an abuse of process to continue to commit the resources of the
English court, including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an
action where so little is now seen to be at stake. Normally where a small
claim is brought, it will be dealt with by a proportionate small claims
procedure. Such a course is not available in an action for defamation where,
although the claim is small, the issues are complex and subject to special
procedure under the CPR.

As noted in my earlier decision in these proceedings in SUM 428, Jameel was
really a case concerned with private international law principles. The
defendant in Jameel was, after all, a US publisher of a newspaper that had
published an allegedly defamatory article on the internet, and the issue which
arose was whether the defamation claim could be struck out if no significant
publication had occurred in England. Requiring that a real and substantial
tort be “committed within the jurisdiction” (Jameel at [50]) appears to go
towards establishing a connexion with English jurisdiction in the first place.
This is further evident from the reference at [70] of Jameel that it would be
an abuse of process “to continue to commit the resources of the English court,
including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an action where so
little is now seen to be at stake”. The reference to “so little … at stake”
must be understood by reference to the fact that only five persons within
English jurisdiction had accessed the defamatory content. It is certainly
arguable that, insofar as English courts have attracted defamation cases with
little or no connection with England, possibly because of the attractiveness
of English damages awards, Jameel is a response to these concerns. There is no
suggestion that concerns of forum shopping apply on the instant facts.

70 The defendant suggests that the decision in Qingdao Bohai illustrates
wholesale acceptance by the Singapore courts of the reasoning in Jameel. I
decline to go so far, and make three observations on that case. First, Qingdao
Bohai was precisely a case where there were at least some concerns of forum
shopping. As the Court observed at [1] of Qingdao Bohai, that case concerned
12 articles posted on several foreign websites, and two articles containing
similar content which were published in Taiwan on 29 November 2013 in two
newspapers. The Court even went so far as to conclude that the first plaintiff
in that case did not even have a reputation in Singapore at the material time:
Qingdao Bohai at [49], [53], and [60]. Second, Jameel was, at best, a highly
secondary basis for rejecting the plaintiff’s claim. Significantly, the
plaintiff could not even establish that the first requirement for making out
publication in the context of online defamation, namely that the defendant had
uploaded or posted the defamatory material on the internet: at [121]. Jameel
was thus not central to the reasoning of the Court in Qingdao Bohai. Third,
and critically, the facts in Qingdao Bohai were somewhat extraordinary in that
the Court concluded that only one single third party had accessed the
allegedly defamatory material. This quite exceptional consideration is not
reflected in, for example, the present case, where (a) several dozen
individuals had directly interfaced or responded to the Post containing the
linked Article (see [7] above); (b) the Post was published on the defendant’s
Facebook Wall, and would have been flagged to his 5,000 Facebook friends and
149 Facebook followers; and (c) the Post was published on the “public”
setting, meaning that even individuals who were not friends of the defendant
on Facebook could access it.

71 The third point I make above segues appropriately into the broader point I
make in relation to Jameel, which is that even if the approach in Jameel were
to be applied wholesale in Singapore law, it is not applicable to the current
factual matrix. In Jameel, like Qingdao Bohai, very few individuals were found
to have accessed the allegedly defamatory material. In the entirety of the
English Court’s jurisdiction, the claimant could only point to five persons
who had accessed the defamatory material, and three of those five persons were
associated with the claimant himself. This paucity of individuals who had
accessed the defamatory material is markedly absent on the instant facts. To
illustrate the thrust of the mischief which the rule in Jameel seeks to
address, the following extract is apposite:

69 If the claimant succeeds in this action and is awarded a small amount of
damages, it can perhaps be said that he will have achieved vindication for the
damage done to his reputation in this country, but both the damage and the
vindication will be minimal. The cost of the exercise will have been out of
all proportion to what has been achieved. The game will not merely not have
been worth the candle, it will not have been worth the wick.

70 … It would be an abuse of process to continue to commit the resources of
the English court, including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an
action where so little is now seen to be at stake. Normally where a small
claim is brought, it will be dealt with by a proportionate small claims
procedure. Such a course is not available in an action for defamation where,
although the claim is small, the issues are complex and subject to special
procedure under the CPR.

I am not satisfied that the present claim is one “where so little … is at
stake”. As has been accepted in Lee Kuan Yew v Seow Khee Leng [1988] 2 SLR(R)
252 (“Seow Khee Leng”) at [25] and Lee Kuan Yew and another v Vinocur John and
others and another suit [1995] 3 SLR(R) 38 (“Vinocur John”) at [55],
allegations of corruption and criminal conduct are “very grave charges”,
especially when made against the Prime Minister of a country. Such allegations
are an “attack on the very core of [his] political credo” and erode his “moral
authority”. As I observed at [53] of my decision in SUM 428, these grave
allegations may mar the Prime Minister’s reputation even if they are published
to only a small number of individuals. In any event, publication in this case
was not only to a small number of individuals (see [92] to [106] below). I am
accordingly unconvinced that Jameel is applicable to the present facts.

72 The decision in Lait v Evening Standard [2011] 1 WLR 2973 (“Lait”) was also
referred to in argument before me, with the defendant arguing that it
illustrates that Jameel extends beyond any basis in the civil procedure rules
and is concerned with balancing the private right of reputation and the public
interest in freedom of expression. Support for this proposition is said to
derive from [41] and [45] of Lait:

41 … The principle identified in the Jameel case consists in the need to put a
stop to defamation proceedings that do not serve the legitimate purpose of
protecting the claimant’s reputation. Such proceedings are an abuse of
process. The focus in the cases has been on the value of the claim to the
claimant; but the principle is not, in my judgment, to be categorised merely
as a variety of the de minimis rule tailored for defamation actions. Its
engine is not only the overriding objective of the Civil Procedure Rules but
also, in Lord Phillips MR’s words, the need to keep “a proper balance between
the article 10 right of freedom of expression and the protection of individual
reputation”. This will especially be so where a defence of honest comment is
advanced by a responsible – I emphasise the adjective – journalist …
Accordingly the balance to be struck between public interest and private right
will be a material consideration when the court has to consider the
application of the Jameel principle in a case where a responsible media
defendant pleads honest comment. This conclusion is I think fortified by
section 12(4)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998 …

45 I do not consider that this approach … should be regarded as a radical
step. The balance to be struck between public interest and private right is
increasingly to be seen as a function of our constitution; and the law of
defamation is increasingly to be seen as an aspect of it. It is no more than
an ordinary incident of the common law’s incremental method that familiar
notions such as abuse of process should be fashioned for its service.

73 What is immediately apparent from Lait is the observation that the balance
to be struck between public interest and private rights is to be seen as a
function of the constitution. This is a significant distinction which again is
not applicable in the Singapore context – the United Kingdom’s unwritten
constitution does not operate in quite the same manner that Singapore’s
Constitution does. For one, Singapore’s Constitution is expressly stated as
being the supreme law of the land, whereas the United Kingdom’s common law
and/or unwritten constitution does not expressly provide so.

74 Moreover, Lait makes clear the reliance Jameel places on the requirement of
proportionality under the English CPR, as well as the Article 10 right to
freedom of expression under the European Convention on Human Rights. Once
again, these instruments do not have direct cognates in Singapore, even if
some of the principles invoked may, depending on the facts, be applicable.
What is more significant, however, is that there is clear Court of Appeal
authority in Review Publishing (at [269] to [271]) indicating that it is for
Parliament to strike the balance between freedom of expression and the
constraints placed upon it by the law of defamation. My analysis above from
[54] to [57] would thus apply even if I were amenable to the exhortation in
Lait that the balance to be struck between public interest and private right
is “a function of our constitution”.

75 In sum, what can be gleaned from the decision in Lait is that the
substantive underlying factors behind the approach adopted in England include
instruments which have no precise equivalent in Singapore. Lait also involved
a situation where the English Court of Appeal had found that the primary
meaning of allegedly defamatory words was a comment that had been honestly
expressed. The English Court thus was disinclined to expend time and money to
determine the remaining issue, which was “theoretical” and could not succeed
unless it had been maliciously advanced. Since malice had not even been
pleaded, there was no realistic prospect of success. By contrast, a legitimate
and viable endpoint, namely the pursuit of vindication of reputation and
damages, is being pursued by the plaintiff on the instant facts. It thus
suffices for me to note that even if Jameel goes beyond a conflicts of law or
forum shopping issue, the principle laid down is not applicable in this case.
As Choo Han Teck J observed on Jameel in Chan Boon Siang and others v Jasmin
Nisban [2018] 3 SLR 498 at [7], “although the court’s resources ought not to
be used for the pursuit of trivial or pointless claims, each case must be
determined on its own facts”.

The doctrine in Derbyshire

76 The case of Derbyshire stands for the proposition that a government organ
or entity cannot sue in defamation, as that would otherwise impede criticism,
and thus freedom of speech. In his speech at 547F, Lord Keith observed that:

… it is of the highest public importance that a democratically elected
governmental body, or indeed any governmental body, should be open to
uninhibited public criticism. The threat of a civil action for defamation must
inevitably have an inhibiting effect on freedom of speech.

77 The plaintiff argues that the rule in Derbyshire is not applicable as he is
claiming here as an individual, and not as a government organ or entity. The
defendant argues to the contrary that the instant proceedings have been
brought by the plaintiff to circumvent the rule in Derbyshire, and that it is
in fact the government bringing the action under the “unconvincing guise of a
personal suit”. 29

The defendant points to three pieces of evidence which he asserts illustrates
the true nature of the present proceedings as being de facto government
actions:

The defendant asserts that the use of the “majestic plural” as opposed to the

rather than by the plaintiff as an individual. 31

(c) Third, once aware of the defamatory words, the plaintiff was said to have
“set the full machinery of the State into action”, having various ministers
and government entities like the Monetary Authority of Singapore issue
refutations of the said words. 32

78 I am unable to accept the defendant’s three arguments. The defendant’s
citation of the plaintiff’s statement is out of context, and elides the fact
that the plaintiff later went on to state that the consideration he faced was
how to clear his name. In any event, the defendant’s position places undue
emphasis on the mere use of the word “our” – the plaintiff had distinguished,
in his response while under cross-examination, between actions relating to his
role in government (“And our answer is, in the end, put it to the test, the
test of the ballot”) and actions relating to his personal reputation (“but
when somebody defames me, whether he happens to be a [government] critic or
not … I have to think what to do and what my legal options are and how I can
clear my name”). 33

Similarly, I do not accept that the means by which the plaintiff came to know
about the defamatory words is relevant, nor am I persuaded that the statements
and actions by ministers and government entities are decisive. After all,
there was suggestion in the Article that the government, and specifically the
plaintiff in his capacity as head of the government, had behaved improperly.
There was thus good reason for the government to seek to refute allegations
made against it.

79 I instead accept that the plaintiff here is indeed suing as an individual.
Even if Derbyshire represents the law in Singapore, the present facts are
quite different. Nothing in Derbyshire would prevent an official such as the
plaintiff from suing in his own name and in respect of his own injury. The
language of the various judgments did not go so far. It is clear that the
House of Lords was concerned with agencies or entities within the government,
and differentiating such entities from private, ie, non-governmental,
corporations. This can be seen at 547E–G:

There are, however, features of a local authority which may be regarded as
distinguishing it from other types of corporation, whether trading or
nontrading. The most important of these features is that it is a governmental
body. Further, it is a democratically elected body, the electoral process
nowadays being conducted almost exclusively on party political lines. It is of
the highest public importance that a democratically elected governmental body,
or indeed any governmental body, should be open to uninhibited public
criticism. The threat of civil action for defamation must inevitably have an
inhibiting effect on freedom of speech.

80 It may be argued that a similar principle should apply to politicians: That
argument is, however, precluded by the Court of Appeal’s decision in Tang
Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew and another and other appeals [1997] 3 SLR(R) 576
from [116] to [119]. In particular, the Court observed that:

Clearly these two cases [Derbyshire and City of Chicago v Tribune Co (1923)
139NE 86] are distinguishable from the instant cases. In each of the two cases
the party suing was a public authority and as a matter of policy the laws in
those jurisdictions do not permit such an authority to bring an action for
libel. In the cases before us, the plaintiffs are individuals suing as private
citizens. None of them brought the actions in their official capacity. Even
under English law, a prime minister of a minister in office may sue in their
private capacity for damages in respect of defamatory matters published of
them and depending on the circumstances may recover substantial damages. Mr
Gray himself realises this crucial difference because, in the next breath, he
says that Mr Tang “is not arguing that politicians should forfeit the right to
protect their reputations by means of libel actions”.

It was apparent in the present case that the plaintiff was suing in his own
right. The suit is in his name and brings a claim for loss to his reputation.
Crucially, nothing in the claim or arguments raised points to an attempt to
vindicate anything other than the plaintiff’s own personal rights.

Other collateral purposes

81 The defendant asserts that the plaintiff’s bringing of this suit has a
dominant improper purpose “because the [p]laintiff is trying to silence a
critic, not trying to vindicate his reputation”. 34

##### Foot Note 34

DCS at [5].

I do not see how the plaintiff’s actions can be construed as “not trying to
vindicate his reputation”. Quite simply, the defendant has not shown that the
proceedings were mounted to serve some other collateral purpose.

82 The motivations and objectives of litigants would generally be
multifarious. Litigation may be intended to remedy a breach of some
obligation, but may also be intended to obtain vengeance for some slight, to
punish the other party, or to teach the other side a lesson of some sort. The
mere possibility or even existence of such other motivation does not, without
more, colour the proceedings as being abusive. As has rightly been observed,
albeit in the context of shareholder disputes, “it is not the law that only a
plaintiff who feels goodwill towards a defendant is entitled to sue”: Swansson
v R A Pratt Properties Pty Ltd [2002] 42 ACSR 313 at [41]. I do not see how it
can be contended that the plaintiff is not in fact trying to vindicate his
reputation – he has sought an apology for the defamatory words, and is now
seeking damages in defamation. It is well-established in the law of defamation
that damages can vindicate a plaintiff’s reputation, and that they must in
fact be of a sufficient quantum to have that effect: Broome v Cassell and Co
Ltd [1972] AC 1027 at 1071B–E (“Cassell and Co Ltd”), as applied in Tang Liang
Hong v Lee Kuan Yew and another and other appeals [1997] 3 SLR(R) 576 at
[128].

The Appropriate Remedies

83 The plaintiff sought two remedies: damages and an injunction.

Damages

84 An award of damages would follow from a finding that defamation has
occurred: [62] above. Damages in the context of defamation may be broadly
separated into general and aggravated damages. As observed in Arul Chandran v
Chew Chin Aik Victor [2001] 1 SLR(R) 86 (“Arul Chandran”) at [53], general
damages serve three purposes:

(a) First, they act as a consolation to the plaintiff for the distress the
publication causes;

(b) Second, they repair the harm to the plaintiff’s reputation; and

(c) Third, they serve to vindicate the plaintiff’s reputation.

85 The plaintiff argues in favour of substantial damages, pointing to the
existence of a number of factors which are material in determining the award
to be made. In Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another and another
appeal [2010] 4 SLR 357 (“Lim Eng Hock Peter”) at [7], the Court of Appeal
highlighted the following factors as being relevant to determining the quantum
of general damages:

(a) The nature and gravity of the defamation;

(b) The conduct, position and standing of the plaintiff and the defendant;

(c) The mode and extent of publication;

(d) The natural indignation of the Court at the injury caused to the
plaintiff;

(e) The conduct of the defendant from the time the defamatory statement is
published to the very moment of the verdict;

(f) The failure to apologise and retract the defamatory statement; and

(g) The presence of malice.

The plaintiff argues that every one of these factors is relevant on the
instant facts in warranting a significant award of damages. The plaintiff also
argues that another consideration relevant to the determination of the quantum
of general damages is its intended deterrent effect: The Gleaner Co Ltd v
Abrahams [2004] 1 AC 628 at [53], as approved at [8] of Lim Eng Hock Peter.

86 The defendant argues on the other hand that only nominal damages should be
awarded. The libel was not serious, less believable because it was on social
media, and did not originate from the defendant. Rather, it was only shared by
him. Moreover, mitigation occurred, which reduced any effect of the defamatory
words. It was also contended that there was very limited evidence of
publication of the Post and none of the Article. Even if there was any such
evidence, the defendant argued that the publication level was very low. It was
further said that no malice was made out, nor was it properly pleaded. In
addition, while the defendant did not apologise, he removed the post upon
receiving the IMDA notice, had not repeated the libels, and had not defended
the statements made as true.

87 While different cases were cited by the parties as authority, the specific
factors going towards quantum were not in dispute. Given my findings above
that the Post and Article were each published, and that the latter could in
fact be seen as part of the former (see above at [42]), the consequences of
such publication will be taken together.

The plaintiff’s reputation

88 In the present case, a particularly significant factor in determining the
precise quantum of damages is the effect of the defamatory words on the
reputation of the plaintiff, a politician. As argued by the plaintiff,
Singapore courts have drawn a distinction between public and private figures,
with public figures typically awarded substantial damages if the defamation
relates to their honesty, integrity or character. The following extract from
Lim Eng Hock Peter is illustrative on this point:

12 Singapore courts have consistently awarded higher damages to public leaders
than other personalities for similar types of defamation because of the
greater damage done not only to them personally, but also to the reputation of
the institution of which they are members … Public leaders are generally
entitled to higher damages also because of their standing in Singapore society
and devotion to public service. Any libel or slander of their character with
respect to their public service damages not only their personal reputation,
but also the reputation of Singapore as a State whose leaders have acquired a
worldwide reputation for honesty and integrity in office and dedication to
service of the people. In this connection, it is pertinent that it has been
said that the most serious acts of defamation are those that touch on the
“core attributes of the plaintiff’s personality”, ie, matters such as
“integrity, honour, courage, loyalty and achievement” (see Gatley at p 267).

13 Defaming a political leader is a serious matter in Singapore because it
damages the moral authority of such a person to lead the people and the
country … Without a clean or credible reputation, their moral authority to
lead the people is compromised.

89 In Seow Khee Leng, the High Court observed at [25] that:

Allegations of corrupt and criminal conduct are very grave charges, especially
if they are made against the Prime Minister of a country. Such charges unless
challenged head on would destroy the plaintiff … as moral authority is the
cornerstone of effective government. If this moral authority is eroded, the
government cannot function.

Defamation committed against the Prime Minister and political leaders would,
given its serious nature, would have to attract damages that suffice to
vindicate the Prime Minister’s reputation: Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore
Democratic Party and others and another suit [2009] 1 SLR(R) 642 at [103].

The standing of the defendant

90 The plaintiff also points to the standing of the defendant, which, it is
argued, goes to the impact of the defamation and the injury caused. In Lee
Kuan Yew v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin [1979–1980] SLR(R) 24 at [70], F A Chua
J observed that:

… The standing of the plaintiff is such as to mean that the injury done to him
was grave. It was spoken by the principal opposition speaker and a prominent
person whose words would carry more weight than that of a lesser individual
and his hearers would be inclined to believe that there must be something in
the accusation he was making …

I note for completeness that F A Chua J’s decision was upheld on appeal, both
before the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

91 While the defendant describes himself as a staunch government critic, I am
not persuaded that his standing went so far as argued by the plaintiff’s
counsel. Unlike Mr Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, the defendant was not the
“principal opposition speaker”, nor is he a Member of Parliament. He holds no
public office. In Vinocur John, the defendants were the executive editor of
the International Herald Tribune, the editor of the Far Eastern Economic
Review, and the Chief Executive and publisher of the International Herald
Tribune. The International Herald Tribune is a reputable and influential daily
newspaper with a wide circulation both internationally and in Singapore. It
could not, to my mind, be said that the instant defendant had a comparable
level of standing or prominence to the individuals I have mentioned. While he
has been involved in politics, there is a qualitative difference between him
and the other individuals I have identified here.

Reach of the publication

92 In determining the reach of the publication, the relevant evidence includes
many of the matters which have been considered in determining if there has
been publication and/or republication. The defendant has 5,000 friends and 149
followers on Facebook. These numbers do not seem to point to an exceptionally
substantial following, at least in comparison to others on social media, and
other types of social media such as YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, or Tiktok.
Though not adduced before me, I think I can take judicial notice that follower
numbers for various Singaporean personalities can number in the tens of
thousands, if not more.

93 Be that as it may, the plaintiff argued that there would have been a wide
reach for the defamatory material through the internet. However, there was no
direct evidence, whether in the form of view counters or metadata printouts,
that the Post and linked Article had a large circulation. Indeed, there was no
evidence that the post went viral, ie, accumulating several tens if not
hundreds of thousands of reactions, likes, and/or shares. What the plaintiff
depended on to establish the reach of the publication was the likelihood or
probability of broad circulation, based at least in part on (a) the number of
followers and friends of the defendant’s Facebook account, and (b) the number
of persons who had expressed their support or reaction to the Post. This
turned in large part on the expert provided by the plaintiff’s expert, Dr
Phan.

94 Dr Phan’s evidence was that the reach of the Post could be exponential
because of the amplification of posts, especially of false news. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

Bundle of AEICs (“BA”) Vol 2 at 400 and 401.

However, Dr Phan was unable to specify exactly how much publication would have
occurred on the instant facts through reposting and shares. On the instant
facts, there had been five comments, 18 shares, and 22 reactions. The
defendant, as previously noted, had 5,000 friends and 149 followers on his
Facebook account. In my view, even if there was some spread in proportion to
these approximately 5,000 friends and followers, and there was downstream
spread from them, even taking in account the public privacy setting of the
Post and the accelerated rate at which fake news was said to spread, I still
could not find that the evidence showed that there such widespread
distribution that would have approached anything like figures of tens of
thousands.

95 Dr Phan also referred to a study showing that false political news would
reach 20,000 persons three times faster than the time it took for other false
news to reach 10,000 persons. 36

##### Foot Note 36

2 BA 402 at [32].

In addition, the plaintiff’s counsel pointed out that this study had been
cited by the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods in its Report
dated 19 September 2018, and by Singapore’s Minister for Education in the
Parliamentary Debates on the POFMA. 37

##### Foot Note 37

×

2 BA 403 at [33].

Be that as it may, I was not convinced that this study was of direct help on
the instant facts. It does not prove anything in the case before me. Aside
from that, this figure of 20,000 was only referred to in estimating or showing
the speed with which fake political news could spread, especially relative to
other forms of fake news. It could not be inferred, even on a prima facie
standard, that this figure of 20,000 and/or the rate of spreading was the
reach of the Post and Article here. Thus, while I am prepared to accept the
proposition that fake political news may spread faster than other forms of
fake news, I did not see how this assisted my determination on the reach of
the present publications.

96 The plaintiff argues, relying on Dr Phan’s evidence, that the total number
of persons based in Singapore who accessed the Post is likely to be large and
in the thousands. 38

##### Foot Note 38

PCS at [148(b)].

I am not certain that Dr Phan’s evidence bears this out. The core thrust of Dr
Phan’s reasoning in explaining why the number of views would be several times
higher than the number of reactions, likes, comments, and/or shares of the
Post is what is described as the “cascade effect”. 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

2 BA 401 at [27].

Dr Phan, relying on a number of academic articles, explains the cascade effect
as being that the reach of a Facebook post can extend exponentially as it is
“reacted” to, commented on, or shared. 40

were said to show that the reach stemming from an initial post or “seed” could
be extensive.

97 In terms of specifics, I sought to understand from Dr Phan the actual
numbers which he estimated would have viewed the Post. Dr Phan gave evidence
that, applying what in his view was a very conservative estimate of (a) a
minimum of 22 users initially accessing the Post and reacting to/commenting
on/sharing the Post, and (b) each of those 22 users having an average of 300
friends on Facebook, the Post would have appeared on the Facebook “news feeds”
of up to 6,600 users. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

2 BA 407 at [46] and [47].

This was predicated on the assumption that the 6,600 users had logged in to
Facebook during the time the Post was available on the defendant’s Facebook
timeline. Dr Phan suggested that the actual number might be considerably
higher than 6,600 users given the possibility that those 6,600 users may have
themselves shared the Post.

98 I note, however, that there is a distinction to be drawn between
individuals on whose Facebook news feeds the Post might have appeared, and
individuals who actually were online at the relevant times and accessed the
Post. After all, Facebook news feeds continue to update based on the actions
of one’s Facebook friends, and the mere fact of a post potentially appearing
at some point on one’s news feed cannot be taken, without more, to mean that
the post was accessed by that particular user. Moreover, there is no
suggestion that the 6,600 users referred to above were all from Singapore.

99 In relation to my latter concern, Dr Phan’s view was that the minimum
number that would have accessed or downloaded the Post would have been 200 to
400, on the basis that 10 to 20% of the defendant’s 2,060 friends and
followers and followers based in Singapore had done so. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

2 BA 408 and 409.

When queried further on this figure, Dr Phan indicated that these 10 and 20%
estimates were “well below one standard deviation, almost two standard
deviations below [that] which is published in the academic community”, and
that these figures were “really a very conservative, a very lower bound”. 47

##### Foot Note 47

100 The plaintiff argues that since 95% of all sample sizes fall within two
standard deviations, there was a 95% probability that the number of
individuals in Singapore for whom the Post would have been accessible would
have been at or higher than Dr Phan’s estimates. 48

##### Foot Note 48

PCS at [161].

The source the plaintiff relies on for this 95% probability is from the
website Investopedia. 49

##### Foot Note 49

Footnote No. 207 in PCS.

I am, however, not persuaded that the conclusion the plaintiff invites me to
draw is borne out on the evidence. On the plaintiff’s case, assuming a normal
distribution of data, 95% of the data value will fall within the two standard
deviations of the mean value. However, Dr Phan did not testify that the 10%
and 20% figures he relied on, of about 200 to 400, were at the tail of a
normal distribution.

101 Additionally, Dr Phan’s evidence only went so far as stating that the
estimate he had reached was one or two standard deviations below what would be
estimated in the academic community, presumably by reference to the typical
reach of a published post or article. However, the role of this Court is not
to consider what might be the case in abstract – it still had to be
established what the actual reach of the Post was here.

102 Fundamentally, the estimate cited to me of over 2,000 individuals the Post
had been published to in Singapore seemed somewhat speculative. Dr Phan
testified that the posts would have appeared on newsfeeds of 6,600 users, but
this referred to Facebook users generally, not users who were specifically in
Singapore. Though the plaintiff points out that no contrary narrative had been
put forward by the defence, the figures the plaintiff sought to rely on
nonetheless remained speculative. In any event, even if the spread of the Post
was to thousands, it is not clear that it would be in the region of tens of
thousands or more.

103 Given what Dr Phan had actually testified, and in the absence of any
support for any higher figure actually occurring on the facts, I could not
accept the plaintiff’s account. I was mindful in this regard that, framed as
it was in fairly general terms and in reliance on academic studies gauging
overseas contexts, the plaintiff’s case could have been applied to a whole
swathe of situations such that a broad reach for a post could be asserted for
a huge number of posts. To my mind, context remains key. The Court has to be
satisfied that the evidence goes beyond merely showing that a generic post (or
even one spreading false political claims) could potentially spread widely,
and instead that, on the facts of the case, there is enough context to ground
the inference it is invited to draw. On the instant facts, and in relation to
this specific Post and Article, I am not satisfied that there is enough basis
for me to draw the inferences the plaintiff advocates. This is not to say that
publication can only be established by direct evidence. Rather, the platform
of facts upon which the precise extent of publication is made out must be a
robust one, and must relate to the specific context in which publication took
place, rather than merely on academic extrapolation.

104 I also note that the findings in SUM 428 do not show that the plaintiff’s
assertions on the extent of the publication should, without more, be accepted.
Those determinations had been made in the context of a striking-out
application. The fact that the defendant eventually chose to submit that there
was no case to answer in the substantive trial did not mean that the Court
should conclude, without more, that there had been publication to the extent
which the plaintiff asserted. Rather, the evidence, including that elicited
through cross-examination, needs to be considered holistically.

105 In the circumstances, therefore, I find that the extent of the publication
of the Post (which I refer to in this context as incorporating the Article:
see above at [42]), would have been at most about 400 persons to whom the
defamatory words had been published. I emphasise that this figure refers
specifically to (a) users who were based in Singapore, (b) users to whom the
defamatory words had been published, meaning that they must have received the
information in such a way that it was understood (Qingdao Bohai at [35]), and
(c) users who received the information through, whether directly or
indirectly, the defendant’s acts.

106 How this figure of 400 is reached is as follows: At the very least, there
were 22 reactions, 5 comments, and 18 shares. The Post thus must have been
published to at least these 45 individuals, though it is unclear if all of
them were in Singapore, and it is further unclear whether the same person(s)
may have liked and shared the same post. Accounting for the defendant’s
friends and followers on Facebook, there were at least about 5,000 such
Facebook users, though again it is unclear (a) whether all of the accounts in
that figure are based out of Singapore, and (b) whether they would all have
seen the Post on their Facebook Newsfeeds in an intelligible form. The
plaintiff indicates that about 2,060 of the defendant’s 5,000 Facebook friends
and followers are based in Singapore, and Dr Phan estimates that 10 to 20% of
this figure would have accessed the Post in an intelligible form. These
figures of 10 to 20% are 200 to 400 users, and the figure of 400 is reached
accordingly.

Impartiality

107 While the defendant took issue with Dr Phan’s expertise and impartiality,
I do not find that there was any lack of impartiality as had been argued by
the defendant. The thrust of the defendant’s submissions in this regard
related to Dr Phan’s grant from the government for research funding, and the
fact that his AEIC shadowed that of the plaintiff.

108 I do not find that the grant affected the credibility of any part of Dr
Phan’s report or his testimony. Grants, particularly, government-related
grants, are the lifeblood of academic research, and it is to be expected that
many academic experts would have received a grant in one form or another. For
an expert’s credibility to be impugned, there has to be some evidence put
forward that the grant has somehow created a real and substantial risk of the
expert opinion being subverted, breaching the obligation owed by the expert to
the Court. There was no such evidence here.

109 As for the shadowing of the words of the plaintiff’s affidavit, deponents
should generally depose using their own words, but some editing is to be
expected. While there was some unfortunate similarity in language used between
Dr Phan and the plaintiff’s affidavits, I do not find that the shadowing of
the plaintiff’s words here went towards the substance of what Dr Phan had
given evidence on. There was no indication that the words used conveyed
anything other than what Dr Phan intended, and, in any event, the crux of Dr
Phan’s evidence on the cascade effect and his estimates of the Post’s reach in
this case were his own. I thus did not accept the defendant’s attempts to
impugn Dr Phan’s credibility in this regard.

The defendant’s conduct

110 The plaintiff sought to argue by reference to the defendant’s conduct that
the defendant had aggravated the libels. In particular, he pointed to three
broad categories of such acts: 50

##### Foot Note 50

×

PCS from [97] et seq.

(a) First, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant repeatedly took steps to
draw attention to the instant Suit and/or to the libels that are the subject
of the Suit, which had the effect of keeping the libels fresh in the minds of
the people in Singapore. Specifically, the plaintiff points to the following
non-exhaustive examples: (i) several posts by the defendant on his Facebook
page attaching, inter alia, segments of the pleadings in this Suit and the
plaintiff’s letter of demand, (ii) a video interview dated 6 January 2019
given by the defendant to Amnesty International Hong Kong claiming that he was
the “first person in history to be sued for just sharing information on
Facebook” and that this was “really not justified”, and (iii) a paid
advertisement on Facebook publicising a post on the defendant’s Facebook page
containing a link to an article on The Online Citizen’s website titled “Leong
Sze Hian counter-sues Prime Minister…” The alleged upshot of these examples
was that the defendant had used the suit to wage a public campaign to gain
sympathy and support, and had “cynically drawn attention to the Post and the
Article to keep them fresh in the minds of people in Singapore”.

(b) Second, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant continued to make false
claims that the suit had been commenced for reasons other than to vindicate
the plaintiff’s reputation. This was said to have included the defendant’s
counsel’s conduct when conducting his cross-examination of the plaintiff.

(c) Third, the plaintiff highlighted that the defendant had failed to make any
sufficient apology or withdrawal of the defamatory words.

The plaintiff relied on Arul Chandran at [55] and Koh Sin Chong Freddie at
[51] as authority for the proposition that the above acts would aggravate the
injury inflicted by the defendant.

111 I note the observations of Lee Seiu Kin J in Lee Hsien Loong v Ngerng Yi
Ling Roy [2016] 1 SLR 1321 (“Roy Ngerng”) from [84] to [86] in relation to the
nexus the defendant’s subsequent conduct must have to the original defamatory
statement. Lee J recognised the appeal of the position in England as set out
in Collins Stewart Ltd v The Financial Times Ltd [2006] EMLR 5 at [24] to
[27], that the subsequent conduct must have aggravated the injury arising from
the defamation for which the defendant has been sued in order for it to
constitute an aggravating factor. However, Lee J concluded that this position
was inconsistent with the approach taken by F A Chua J in Lee Kuan Yew v
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin [1979–1980] SLR(R) 24 that casting aspersions over
a plaintiff’s motives in the defamation action would in and of itself
constitute an aggravating factor. As Chua J’s decision was upheld on this
point on appeal in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew [1979–1980]
SLR(R) 255 at [17], Lee J found himself “constrained” to find, on the
authority of the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the defendant’s acts were
aggravating.

112 I have considerable sympathy for Lee J’s view. It would be difficult for
the Court to form a view as to the defendant’s subsequent conduct, if
actionable in itself, without a proper consideration of all relevant matters,
including any defences that might be available to the defendant for that
conduct. I also agree with Lee J that allowing the subsequent conduct to be
considered in aggravation could essentially be a backdoor admission for an
unproven tort in the assessment of damages. However, insofar as the Court of
Appeal’s decision in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew [1979–1980]
SLR(R) 255 is binding on me and makes clear at [17] that subsequent conduct,
particularly relating to the impugning of the plaintiff’s motives, can be a
basis for aggravated damages, I accept the plaintiff’s submission on this
point.

113 Turning to the plaintiff’s arguments arising out of the defendant’s
conduct at trial, I was unpersuaded that the defendant’s conduct of the trial
went so far as to warrant aggravated damages on this front. While propositions
were robustly put to the plaintiff, and there was suggestion that there had
been an abuse of process, I did not see these as being, without more,
aggravating. The suggestions the defendant’s counsel invited the plaintiff to
consider were not wholly contumelious, nor did they cause further harm to the
plaintiff: Roy Ngerng at [91]. The defendant’s counsel’s lines of questioning
on why the plaintiff had singled the defendant out from others who had shared
the Article to sue was reasonable, and cohered with the allegation by the
defence that there had been an abuse of process. I was not persuaded that this
line of questioning was wholly irrelevant, and even if it was, I was not
convinced that the defendant had pursued it in such a manner as to warrant
aggravated damages on this front.

114 As for the plaintiff’s argument that the absence of any apology or
refraining from publication is aggravating, I am prepared to place some
limited weight on this. I accept, on the authority of Maidstone Pte Ltd v
Takenaka Corp [1992] 1 SLR(R) 752 at [51] and [60] and L K Ang Construction
Pte Ltd v Chubb Singapore Pte Ltd [2003] 1 SLR(R) 635 at [24], that the
failure or refusal to apologise per se is not evidence of express malice
amounting to an aggravating factor. Rather, the Court has to look at the
reasons for this failure or refusal. On the instant facts, I accept that the
defendant has failed to apologise, and that his removal of the defamatory
material may have been animated in large part by the IMDA notice. I also
accept that the defendant must have learned, at least over the disposal of SUM
428 and the substantive trial, that the content of the Article was false. No
defence of justification was raised, and the defendant gave no evidence to the
contrary to suggest that his refusal to apologise was animated by any other
reason. The defendant might seek to argue that he had declined to apologise
because he did not believe that the Post or Article was false or defamatory,
but that appears very difficult to square with the fact that the Article made
overt and grave allegations about the plaintiff, the truth of which the
defendant did not seek to defend. Even a clarificatory message on the part of
the defendant does not appear to have been contemplated. Accordingly, I accept
that the defendant must have learned of the falsity of the defamatory words at
some point over the course of proceedings, and that his continued refusal to
apologise even thereafter can be a basis for granting aggravated damages.
There is clear authority that aggravated damages may be awarded where the
defendant refuses to apologise even after knowing of the falsity of the
defamatory words: Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and
another suit [2009] 1 SLR(R) 642 at [120], [122] cf [215], Cheah Cheng Hoc &
Ors v Liew Yew Tiam & Ors [2000] 6 MLJ 204 at 226I, and Doris Chia at [20.45].

115 My analysis in the preceding paragraph, however, does not render
irrelevant the fact that the defamatory Post has been removed from the
defendant’s Facebook page, nor does it detract from the fact that the
offending Post was only available on the said Facebook page for a relatively
short period of time. Given all the circumstances, I am prepared to recognise
that there was at least some aggravation arising from the defendant’s conduct,
though perhaps not nearly as much as the plaintiff sought to persuade me of.

116 In sum, while I accept that there has been aggravation on the instant
facts, I do not consider that the allegedly aggravating conduct went so far as
to attract a markedly increased award of damages. In particular, the
defendant’s supposed drawing of attention to the statement had been done in
the midst of explaining his position, and I am satisfied that the quantum of
aggravated damages on these facts should be calibrated to reflect that.

Malice

117 The Plaintiff argues that malice is made out on the facts. As the Court in
Lee Kuan Yew v Davies Derek Gwyn and others [1989] 2 SLR(R) 544 at [112]
observed, malice in defamation refers to any “ill-will, spite, or some wrong
or improper motive”. It is also generally accepted that malice may be inferred
if it is abundantly plain that the defamatory statement is untrue: Mangena v
Edward Lloyd Ltd (1908) LT 640 at 643. As is made clear in Richard Parkes QC
et al, Gatley on Libel and Slander (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2017) at
[32.45], malice may be inferred from the defendant’s conduct at any time,
whether before or after the publication, his actions during the course of
litigation, and his demeanour and attitude at trial. In this regard, the
plaintiff points to three categories of behaviour it alleges make out malice
on the instant facts:

(a) First, the defendant’s conduct in publishing the defamatory words while
knowing them to be untrue or recklessly not caring whether they are true or
not;

(b) Second, the defendant’s alleged conduct in using the suit to wage a public
campaign to gain sympathy and support; and

(c) Third, the defendant’s failure to make any sufficient apology or
withdrawal of the defamatory words.

As is readily apparent, items (b) and (c) are simply restatements of arguments
the plaintiff had relied on in relation to the question of whether the
defendant’s conduct was aggravating. Accordingly, I will focus on item (a)
instead. Before that, however, I consider two preliminary objections by the
defendant to allegations of malice.

118 First, the defendant alleged that malice had not been properly pleaded. I
am unable to agree. I note that the Statement of Claim averred various
matters, including statements from politicians, government agencies, and press
reports which all stated categorically that the content in the Article was
false, and that action was being taken: Statement of Claim from [3(l)] to
[3(n)]. These averments were also the foundation of the claim for aggravated
damages. Given the plain wording of these averments, which went towards
suggesting that the defendant was aware of the false nature of the defamatory
words from an early stage, no further pleading was required.

119 Second, the defendant appears to suggest, by referring to conduct that is
“tantamount to dishonesty” in his submissions, 51

that dishonesty is required in order to establish malice in the context of
defamation. If this is the defendant’s suggestion, it is incorrect given the
clear authority of Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and another
[1998] 2 SLR(R) 971 at [53].

120 In relation to the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant had published the
defamatory words while knowing them to be untrue or recklessly not caring
whether they are true or not, I accept that there is at least a prima facie
case established that the defendant knew that the defamatory words were
untrue. While the Article had referred to a quote from Ms Clare Rewcastle
Brown, whom the defendant believed to be a respected investigative journalist
who had played a role in uncovering the 1MDB scandal, that did not ipso facto
absolve the defendant from verifying the veracity or otherwise of the Article
before linking to it in his Post. It was, at the very least, reckless
disregard of whether the Article was true or not for the defendant to have
posted it without making any enquiries as to its truth whatsoever. In this
regard, I was unassisted by the lack of any direct evidence from the defendant
as to his state of mind, and am satisfied on the basis of the facts before me
that his recklessness as to the truth of the Article may be inferred.

121 In any event, I am also satisfied that, when seen cumulatively with his
refusal to apologise for the defamatory words, malice may be made out on the
facts. However, a further significant question is the extent of the malice –
any uplift to the damages on the facts will be tempered by the fact that the
malice in this case, unlike in several of the other cases cited to me, did not
involve a defendant wilfully posting something he knew to be false at the time
of posting, nor did it involve a defendant who defiantly insisted on the truth
of his libellous claims to the bitter end despite clear evidence to the
contrary.

Other factors

122 The plaintiff also argued that the Court should take into account the
“natural indignation of the court” in determining the appropriate quantum of
damages. Cases such as Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another and
another appeal [2010] 4 SLR 357 at [7] and Lee Kuan Yew and another v Tang
Liang Hong and others and other actions [1997] 2 SLR(R) 81 at [86] were cited
in support of this proposition. Looking at the cases cited to me, I remain
unsure what this factor adds, if anything, to the factors already discussed
above. Given potential concerns of double-counting, I declined to place
significant weight on this consideration.

Quantum

123 The plaintiff argued for an award of damages in line with that made in Roy
Ngerng. In Roy Ngerng, a total of S$150,000 was awarded, covering S$100,000 in
general damages and S$50,000 in aggravated damages.

124 While it is trite that each case must be decided on its own facts, I
accept that reference may be had to other cases involving similar
circumstances in determining the broad range of damages payable within which
the instant case falls. The plaintiff pointed me to a range of cases, but I am
of the view that most of them were not directly applicable insofar as they (a)
involved defendants who were of high public prominence as leaders of the
opposition, or editors of major newspapers with worldwide distribution, and/or
(b) involved far greater degrees of malice or contemptuous behaviour, even
towards the Courts.

125 Roy Ngerng was indeed the most appropriate comparator to the instant
factual matrix. Comparing the facts of Roy Ngerng to those of the present
case, it is immediately apparent that the number of views the defamatory
material in Roy Ngerng received was far larger. The Judge in Roy Ngerng found
that some 95,443 may have seen the home page of the defendant’s website, which
contained the defamatory words. After some calculating and giving the benefit
of the doubt to the defendant in that case, the Court in Roy Ngerng found that
there would have been at least 37,223 distinct individuals who saw the
article. I took the view that the standing of the instant defendant and that
of Mr Ngerng was roughly comparable – both were socio-political commentators
who did not hold any formal positions of public office, and both had some
modicum of following on their websites and online pages. In addition, the
Judge in Roy Ngerng appears to have adopted the view that there was
significant malice and aggravation in that case, which I have not found, at
least to the same extent, on the present facts.

126 While the allegation in Roy Ngerng was described by the Judge in that case
as one of the “gravest” (at [29]), the defamatory statement here was in fact
worse: that the plaintiff was involved in a cross-border defalcation of the
funds belonging to the citizens of another country, in cooperation with the
leader of that country. For that reason, I would find that despite the lower
reach, an award of S$100,000 in general damages was warranted. However, as for
the quantum of aggravated damages, there was a more limited basis to award
such damages on the instant facts, and it would thus suffice to award roughly
a third of the general damages, or about S$33,000, for a total quantum of
S$133,000.

Injunction

127 Turning to the second relief sought, I am doubtful that what has been
shown in this case would justify the grant of an injunction. The greater
threat of continued publication would arguably be from the originators of the
article rather than this defendant, who had swiftly complied with the IMDA
notice once it had been issued. While the defendant has not apologised, he
also has not demonstrated any risk of resuming the publication of the
defamatory material. Should he do so, he would, of course, run the risk of
further claims being made, with potential attendant consequences in costs and
damages.

Miscellaneous

128 At various points, the plaintiff referred to my earlier decision in these
proceedings, in which I declined to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim in SUM
428. My findings in that decision were, of course, subject to the appropriate
standard at that stage, namely, that there was a triable issue which warranted
the matter proceeding to trial. Those findings did not control my
determination at the close of proceedings, even with a submission of no case
to answer being made.

129 The point of the determination in SUM 428 was to determine if there was
enough before the court to warrant a trial; a finding that the prima facie
standard was met on the material before the Court at the interlocutory stage
did not necessarily indicate that a prima facie standard had been met at trial
to warrant a finding for the plaintiff. One clear difference is that following
the submission of there being no case to answer, the plaintiff’s evidence
would have been tested in the cross-examination; it is entirely possible that
sufficient doubt about the evidence may be raised through such questioning
that a prima facie case is not made out. I would thus generally caution
parties against seeking to blithely rely on determinations at an interlocutory
stage as somehow wholly determinative of the outcome for the substantive
proceeding.

Conclusion

130 Given the entirety of the evidence placed before me, the defendant is to
pay the plaintiff the sum of S$133,000.

131 I will deal with the matter of costs separately.
