Introduction

1 The appellant, Brother Tan Kim Hock Anthony, was the former Principal of
Maris Stella High School (“the School”) for 25 years from 1984 to 2009. He was
charged with the offence of criminal breach of trust by a servant under s 408
of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for having dishonestly
misappropriated, via six cashier’s orders between 27 March 2009 and 10
September 2009, the sum of $67,679.05 from the School’s Chapel Building Fund
account (“the Chapel Fund account”) with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”). He used
this sum to pay for certain expenses incurred in renovating Champagnat House,
which is the official residence of the Marist Brothers in Singapore. By way of
background, the Marist Brothers is an international Catholic religious order
which founded the School, and the appellant himself is a Marist Brother.

2 The appellant was convicted on 24 April 2013 by the District Court and
sentenced to five months’ imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction
and sentence, while the Prosecution cross-appealed against sentence. After
careful deliberation, I have decided to uphold the trial judge’s decision. I
therefore dismiss both the appeal and cross-appeal. I now give my reasons.

Decision on conviction

3 I will deal first with the appellant’s conviction. Mr Peter Low (“Mr Low”),
for the appellant, urged me to set it aside for the following reasons:

(a) First, the elements of the offence under s 408 of the Penal Code are not
made out. In particular, Mr Low argued that the appellant did not have a
_dishonest_ state of mind at the time of his offence and, further, that he was
not a “ _servant_ ” for the purposes of s 408; and

(b) Second, even if the elements of the offence were established beyond a
reasonable doubt, Mr Low argued that it was nevertheless unsafe to uphold the
conviction because _excessive judicial interference_ by the trial judge in the
proceedings below had given rise to apparent, if not actual, bias.

I will now address these two submissions in turn.

Have the elements of the offence been made out?

4 I agree with the trial judge that the elements of the s 408 offence have
been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Dishonest misappropriation

5 When read in conjunction, ss 23 and 24 of the Penal Code clearly provide
that a man has a dishonest state of mind in the criminal context if he
intends, by unlawful means, to cause “wrongful gain” to one person or
“wrongful loss” to another. For the appeal to succeed in the present case, Mr
Low had to show that the trial judge was wrong to find that the appellant did
intend to cause wrongful gain and wrongful loss when he withdrew monies from
the Chapel Fund account to renovate Champagnat House.

(1) Wrongful loss

6 Mr Low emphasised in his oral submissions that it was crucial for this court
to appreciate how the appellant had viewed the relationship between the School
and Champagnat House. He submitted that while the School and Champagnat House
may have been formally separate entities, _in the appellant’s mind_ , they
were both united by a common purpose to serve the religious mission of the
Marist Brothers in Singapore, which is to make Jesus Christ known and loved
through the education of young people. To enable this court to draw the same
connection, Mr Low emphasised the following factors. Firstly, that Champagnat
House is the official residence of the Marist Brothers. Secondly, that the
School was founded and continues to be run by the Marist Brothers. Thirdly,
while the two plots of land on which Champagnat House and the School were
built are registered in the names of different statutory corporations in
Malaysia[note: 1] and Hong Kong[note: 2], these corporations share direct
links with the Marist Brothers’ headquarters in Rome. In fact, in the course
of this appeal, it emerged from Mr Low’s submissions that all the Marist
Brothers’ missions worldwide were answerable to the Rome headquarters, whose
controlling influence was not insubstantial.

7 It would thus appear that Champagnat House and the School were no more than
local touchpoints through which the Marist Brothers manifested its presence
and advanced its mission here. Both were in essence owned by the Marist
Brothers. Against this backdrop, Mr Low then sought to persuade me that it was
reasonable for the appellant, as a longstanding Marist Brother himself, to
have thought that there was nothing untoward in his application of the monies
in the Chapel Fund account towards the renovation works for Champagnat House,
as both served, in their different ways, one and the same religious mission.
On this view, the appellant could not have _intended_ to cause any wrongful
loss to the School because, by improving Champagnat House, he believed that he
was thereby benefitting the religious mission which the School was a part of.

8 I am not convinced by Mr Low’s submissions. First, as the learned Deputy
Public Prosecutor had quite rightly pointed out, the alleged direct links
which both Champagnat House and the School had with the Rome headquarters were
not canvassed at all before the trial judge. I am not inclined to accept this
part of Mr Low’s submissions based on his mere say-so. In any case, while it
may well be that, _theoretically_ , the network of Marist Brothers around the
world is answerable to the Rome headquarters, it scarcely accords with
_practical reality_ to say that this alone can engender the belief that funds
from one entity can be used for the purposes of another without any prior
authorisation. I am further fortified in my conclusion by the following facts
that were found by the trial judge. Firstly, two of the Prosecution’s
witnesses who were, significantly, the Local Superior of the Marist Brothers
(PW4) and the Vice-Chairman of the School’s Board of Management (“BOM”) (PW6),
testified that there was no “connection” between Champagnat House and the
School[note: 3]. Secondly, the appellant had himself admitted in cross-
examination that he knew that the Chapel Fund account was only to be used for
the School’s purposes and that the payments for the renovation works on
Champagnat House had nothing to do with the School specifically[note: 4]. It
is hardly surprising to me that the appellant, having been the Principal of
the School for so many years, was fully aware that the monies in the Chapel
Fund account should not be used for the renovation works on Champagnat House.
This must be the case because the trial judge had found that the monies in the
Chapel Fund account came from public donations and the Ministry of Education
[note: 5] and, further, that the Chapel Fund account had a clear designated
purpose as stated in the account opening letter, which was “for building a
Memorial Chapel in Maris Stella High School”[note: 6]. Thirdly, the
appellant’s assertion at trial that he had a wide authority to manage the
School’s finances was also found to be inconsistent with the extrinsic
evidence, which showed that he knew that the approval of the Board of
Management (“BOM”) was required before he could draw on the Chapel Fund
account[note: 7].

9 The evidence adduced therefore undoubtedly establishes that, at the time of
the offence, the appellant _knew_ that the Chapel Fund account was intended
for a specific school-related purpose that was unconnected with Champagnat
House, and that approval from the BOM was required before he could use the
monies in that account. In light of this, it is disingenuous for the appellant
to now claim that he had thought, at the material time, that it was
permissible for there to be a loose intermingling of funds for the use of the
School and Champagnat House merely because they advanced the same cause and
had a common root in Rome.

10 In the interest of completeness, I should briefly mention that Mr Low also
submitted that the appellant had at all times intended to and did in fact
reimburse the Chapel Fund account, and that this is therefore inconsistent
with an intention to cause wrongful loss to the School. However, the learned
trial judge had found that the _timing_ and _manner_ of the appellant’s
reimbursement provided grounds for inferring that the _reason_ for him doing
so was to “cover up” his misappropriations to begin with[note: 8]. I see no
reason to disturb this finding.

11 Mr Low also highlighted the appellant’s track record during his lengthy
tenure as Principal of the School. He referred to several testimonials that
had spoken favourably of the appellant’s character. I was therefore invited to
infer that such an outstanding individual could not conceivably have acted
with the intention to harm the School for which he had sacrificed so much.
While I do acknowledge the admirable contributions made by the appellant to
the School and the wider education sector as a whole, I do not think that this
alone can support the inference which Mr Low was inviting me to draw,
especially in light of the various indicia that spoke of his guilty mind at
the material time.

12 I am therefore in agreement with the trial judge’s finding that the
appellant had intended to cause wrongful loss to the School at the time he
used the monies in the Chapel Fund account to pay for the renovations to
Champagnat House. The appellant was accordingly “ _dishonest_ ” in his
misappropriation of the monies.

(2) Wrongful gain

13 Having already found that the appellant intended to cause _wrongful loss_
to the School, there is strictly no need for me to consider whether he had
also intended to cause any _wrongful gain_. This is clear from the plain
wording of s 24 of the Penal Code, which provides that proof of intent to
cause wrongful gain “ _or_ ” wrongful loss would suffice for a finding of
dishonesty. However, let me state briefly why I agree with the trial judge’s
finding that the appellant was _himself_ the intended beneficiary of a
wrongful gain as a result of his unauthorised transactions, since Mr Low had
taken issue with this point on appeal.

14 In the court below, the trial judge found that the appellant had agreed to
pay for the three items that were part of the renovation works for Champagnat
House out of his own personal funds. By using the misappropriated monies
instead, the appellant had benefitted wrongfully because, according to the
trial judge, he then “did not have to use his personal funds for the
payments”[note: 9].

15 Mr Low questioned the trial judge’s reasoning on appeal. Mr Low argued that
it was incorrect to say that any “gain” had accrued to the appellant in the
form of personal savings when the appellant himself had always considered that
his salary belonged to the Marist Brothers, and not to him. In this regard, Mr
Low pointed out that the appellant had taken a “vow of poverty” when he became
a Marist Brother and, consequent upon such a vow, had dutifully contributed
his salary to the Marist Brothers over the years. Mr Low’s argument,
therefore, was that the appellant could not possibly have intended to improve
his own position by using the monies in the Chapel Fund account because
whatever accrual there was in terms of his personal savings then would not
ultimately be enjoyed by him, as he had all along treated his savings as
belonging to the Marist Brothers. In short, there was _in fact_ no personal
gain to the appellant, which makes it absurd to suggest that he could have
_intended_ the same.

16 Mr Low’s submission on this point, however, is not supported by the
evidence before me. To my mind, what was crucial in shedding light on how the
appellant had treated his personal funds at the material time of the offence
was the undisputed fact that he had stopped contributing his salaries to the
Marist Brothers for a four year period between 2006 and 2009. As the appellant
had explained at trial, his decision to discontinue his monetary contributions
was prompted after witnessing how other Marist Brothers were not properly
taken care of when they became old and sick[note: 10]. Therefore, he kept his
own salary to ensure that his own welfare in his old age was secure. He also
spoke of a concern that his monetary contributions might be used for other
Marist Brothers outside of Singapore[note: 11]. To me, these explanations
given by the appellant are telling. They collectively point to the fact that,
by 2009, which was the period during which the offence was committed, the
appellant had begun to consider his personal funds as standing separate and
apart from the Marist Brothers. While this might not have been the case
before, it certainly seems to have been the case _at the time of the offence_.

17 Essentially, I am unconvinced that the appellant had _always_ treated his
salary as belonging to the Marist Brothers when, in the same breath, he claims
that he had made a deliberate decision to withhold it for use in his old age.
I therefore reject Mr Low’s argument and uphold the trial judge’s finding that
the appellant had in fact applied the misappropriated sum towards Champagnat
House so as to avoid having to make the payments out of his own pocket.

Servant

18 Mr Low also argued that as the School was an unincorporated entity at the
time of the offence, it did not have a legal personality and hence could not
have entered into an employment contract with the appellant. This, it was
submitted, negated the element in s 408 of the Penal Code that requires the
appellant to have been entrusted with the misappropriated monies in his
capacity as a “servant”.

19 I do not accept this argument as I am unaware of there being any legal bar
to an unincorporated association employing its own staff. In fact, common
experience tells us that it will frequently be necessary for such associations
to engage staff to further their activities: see Jean Warburton,
_Unincorporated Associations: Law and Practice_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2ndEd, 1992)
at pp 90–92. In any event, the Court of Appeal in _Khoo Jeffrey and others v
Life Bible-Presbyterian Church and others_ [2011] 3 SLR 500 at [27] clearly
did contemplate the possibility of an unincorporated association employing
staff, as appears from the following passage:

... The faculty members were simply staff hired by the College to carry out
its objects, _just as any unincorporated association can hire non-members, or
even members, as its employees_. ...

[emphasis added]

Therefore, even though the School was an unincorporated entity at the material
time of the offence, this did not mean that it could not have employed the
appellant as its Principal who was, in the somewhat antiquated language of the
Penal Code, accordingly its “servant”.

Is it safe to uphold the conviction?

20 While I am satisfied that all the elements in s 408 of the Penal Code have
been made out, that is not the end of the matter as regards the appellant’s
conviction. Mr Low further contended that the conviction should not be allowed
to stand because excessive judicial interference by the trial judge had
prejudiced the partiality of the proceedings below, or at the very least,
there was apparent prejudice. In this regard, Mr Low referred to the following
portions of the Notes of Evidence (“NE”):

(a) Peter Low’s examination-in-chief (“EIC”) of the appellant at pp 142–167 of
the NE dated 4 December 2012[note: 12];

(b) Peter Low’s cross-examination of Cheng Liang Gek (PW3) at pp 56–59 of the
NE dated 30 October 2012[note: 13]; and

(c) Peter Low’s cross-examination of Chin Hon Mann (PW4) at pp 206–221 of the
NE dated 30 October 2012[note: 14].

21 Before providing my analysis of these material portions of the NE, let me
first say that the allegation being made here is, by all accounts, a serious
one for it raises doubts over the judicial temperament, if not integrity, of
the trial judge below. I am therefore minded to approach this issue with great
care and, to that end, have undertaken a close perusal of the NE. In the
course of doing so, I am also guided by the authoritative decision in
_Mohammed Ali bin Johari v Public Prosecutor_ [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 (“ _Johari_
”) which both parties have relied on. In particular, I have in mind the Court
of Appeal’s statement that, when faced with an allegation of excessive
judicial interference, the “ultimate question” for the court reviewing the
propriety of proceedings below is “whether or not there has been the
possibility of a denial of justice to a particular party (and,
correspondingly, the possibility that the other party has been unfairly
favoured)” (at [175]).

EIC of the appellant

22 I now turn to the first material portion of the NE which Mr Low had flagged
for my attention. This essentially concerns a somewhat extended exchange
between the trial judge and the appellant during the latter’s EIC. It arose
after the appellant had given evidence relating to his disclosure of the
accounts which the School had with Standard Chartered Bank, Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation at a
meeting with the BOM in 2002. At this point, the trial judge wanted to
understand why the appellant had not taken the same opportunity to inform the
BOM of the Chapel Fund account with UOB, especially when he had earlier stated
that he was accountable to the BOM. This exchange appears in the following
excerpt[note: 15]:

Court:  |  Why didn’t you inform the board about of all the existence of all these accounts?  
---|---  
Witness:  |  Uh, because---  
Court:  |  And the 1st meeting 17th July 2002, Annex A. You got that?  
Witness:  |  Yes, Your Honour, uh, because if you want to go into the land, uh, option the board had to show evidence that they themselves raise the money. This money have to be raised 2.---2.3 million---  
Court:  |  No---no---no. Why---you recall the Annex A and the minutes at the board meeting, right? 17th July 2002, is it? You---you---you set out the bank accounts, the purpose, the   
Court:  |  signatories.  
Witness:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  My question to you is this, you were saying item 1, 2, 3 and 4 were pre-2000.  
Witness:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  So why didn’t you give a full and frank disclosure of all the accounts set up by the school and how they want to---because after all these are SMC money, right? After the constitution came in to force in 2000---2001---  
Witness:  |  Your---Your Honour---  
Court:  |  the---the board will have---  
Witness:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  jurisdiction over them, right?  
Witness:  |  Yah. Your Honour, these 4 account is---is reflected in the---in the audited account, the investment.  
Court:  |  No, but you see the op---the operation of this account, the signatories---  
Witness:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  and the numbers, how much money there is, why wasn’t it reported to the board in---in---when you’re discussing all the bank accounts? And there were many several minutes where they ask you to give a---for the update of all the bank accounts held by the school.  
Witness:  |  Your Honour, the---this account is annually is reflected, is reported by the auditor. And then they would have---they would have a copy, that’s why in certain meetings---  
Court: |  It---it is not good enough to fo---for the auditor to know, right? You---you---you earlier told us---  
Witness:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  the board is also your boss, right?  
Witness:  |  Yes.  
  
  

23 Mr Low objected on two grounds to the trial judge’s intervention, which he
said showed that the trial judge had closed his mind and predetermined the
appellant’s guilt. The first pertained to the stage of the proceedings at
which the intervention took place. Mr Low argued that it was “premature” for
the trial judge to begin questioning the appellant when he had only begun
giving his EIC. The second objection related to the sustained nature of the
trial judge’s questioning, as that took up the better part of some 24 pages of
the NE.

24 I do not agree with both objections raised by Mr Low. The trial judge’s
power to ask questions of the witnesses before him is set out in s 167 of the
Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and, as has been observed, this is a “wide
power”: see _Ng Chee Tiong Tony v Public Prosecutor_ [2008] 1 SLR(R) 900 at
[12]. Section 167 of the Evidence Act clearly provides that a trial judge may
ask any question he pleases “at any time” to discover or obtain proper proof
of relevant facts. Hence I do not understand Mr Low’s first objection which
seems to suggest that the trial judge should have exercised greater restraint
by posing those questions only after the appellant’s EIC had reached a more
advanced stage or had been concluded. In any case, the trial judge had also
explained why he had begun questioning the appellant at this relatively early
juncture in the following manner[note: 16]:

Court:  |  If---if there’s something that I---I---I---as it comes to my mind I want to ask him.  
---|---  
Low:  |  Yah---yah, understand.  
Court:  |  Because if---if you pass it after he forget.  
  
  

I find the trial judge’s approach to the matter to be both practical and
reasonable. Accordingly, I see no reason to fault the timing of his
intervention.

25 As regards Mr Low’s second objection, I acknowledge that the trial judge’s
questioning of the appellant does carry on for several pages of the NE.
However, as the Court of Appeal sensibly observed in _Johari_ (at [175]), it
is not merely the quantity but also the “qualitative impact” of the trial
judge’s questions which has to be assessed. It is therefore necessary to look
beyond simply the volume of questions asked by the trial judge. Upon closer
inspection, I have found that the particular exchange here had progressed in
the way that it did largely due to the fact that the appellant’s explanations
had shifted during the course of the questioning[note: 17] and because he had
struggled to give a plausible explanation to satisfy the trial judge’s
queries[note: 18]. This is certainly not a case in which the trial judge had,
or looked as if he had, embarked on his own line of questioning upon which an
adverse case was then constructed against the appellant.

26 Far from appearing to have closed his mind to the case before him, the
trial judge was in fact, through his questions, being open with both Mr Low
and the appellant about the matters which concerned him at the material time.

Cross-examination of PW3

27 Mr Low also submitted that the trial judge’s interruption during his cross-
examination of PW3 was improper. Mr Low argued that his cross-examination was
directed at eliciting facts to show that the appellant had not been dishonest.
By interrupting to insist that the defence be disclosed at this stage, the
trial judge had shown himself once again to have closed his mind to all
further circumstantial evidence that might be probative of the appellant’s
innocence.

28 I see no merit in this submission. While Mr Low is of course right to argue
that proof of dishonesty will depend on all the circumstances, that is surely
not a licence for counsel to pose all manner of questions to witnesses which
may have little or no discernible relevance to the issue at hand on the basis
that they might have some speculative or tangential connection to the factual
matrix. A distinct advantage of the cut and thrust nature of oral advocacy
within our adversarial context is that the issues which require the court’s
determination should, ideally, become progressively sharpened as the trial
proceeds. It will therefore be entirely counter-productive if counsel’s
conduct of the case is to confound rather than assist the judge hearing it.
The trial judge in this case certainly had difficulties following how Mr Low’s
cross-examination of PW3 was relevant to the defence. Hence I find it sensible
that the trial judge proceeded to ask Mr Low to explain the thrust of his
questioning to avoid prolonging the trial unnecessarily. This may be gleaned
from the following extract from the NE[note: 19]:

Court:  |  but how---what---what---how do you hope to use all this as part of a submission on this element of dishonesty? I still---  
---|---  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  have---have not been able to see that the---what you are trying to drive at.  
Low:  |  Ah---  
Court:  |  I mean you need to---to---to---to put your defence case---  
Low:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  to the Prosecution witness---  
Low:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  isn’t it?  
Low:  |  Yes, correct.  
Court:  |  That is the---that is what the Law says---  
Low:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  in cross-examination.  
Low:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  But so far I’ve not seen you putting your case. What is the---the case for the Defence?  
Low:  |  Yah. So I---I will have to draw your---draw out the elements that go into the factual matrix, because you will have to look at the---with the fact I---I will submit, you will have to look at all the circumstances, because nobody knows what goes on in a person’s mind, whether he’s honest or not dishonest. You will have to look at all the circumstances and you have to decide on the matrix which I’m trying to put this trial a bit. On the---  
Court:  |  So far the evidence that we have based on the first 3 witnesses, I do not know what the others are going to say. It seems to---the case seems to be something along these lines, that the---this payment for all this extra work, he has no money---lack of money or whatever and he decided to pay. He said he will pay, the bill was sent by the architects to him for that---for those---certain portions, not all that.  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  So far as those portions which are covered by the contract sums is quite clear from the evidence, is Brother Thomas. From you---for this 21st charge, we’re only talking about the amount of 67-over thousand, right?  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  And your client’s statements were positive. He did admit it came from the school fund, correct?  
Low:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  So you need to---for your defence you need to---and---and you’re aware under the CPC, for you to rely on any defence, right, you need to reveal it at the time of investigation, otherwise adverse inference will be drawn, isn’t it, under 22, 23---under Section 25, is it, of the CPC?  
Low:  |  Yes, but we---  
Court:  |  So---  
Low:  |  already---  
Court:  |  but so far your client has not stated any Defence, in fact he made an admission that he took the money but he reimbursed it. You need to---to---how do you---what is the defence to this?   
|  …  
Low:  |  I just ask for your indulgence to give me some latitude to extract---  
Court:  |  I have---  
Low:  |  the information---  
Court:  |  given you a lot of latitude---  
Low:  |  Yah---  
Court: |  by---  
Low:  |  thank you, Your Honour.  
Court:  |  going through all this document which I still---mind---the mind---the question in my mind is, what’s the relevance?  
Low:  |  Yes, okay.  
Court:  |  Because I have not---you haven’t show me---  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  what’s the relevance.  
Low:  |  Okay, yah---okay.  
Court:  |  You see, you know, in your cross-examination---  
Low:  |  Okay, yah.  
Court:  |  as a Judge I have to decide to allow the questions, know. I have to decide what is the relevance to your defence.  
Low:  |  Correct, yah. I---I’m---  
Court:  |  Right?  
Low:  |  and---  
Court:  |  That is the---  
Low: |  yes---  
Court:  |  role of the Judge---  
Low:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  in the trial, right?  
Low:  |  Yes.  
Court:  |  Otherwise, the trial will go on and---  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  ad infinitum---  
Low:  |  Yes---  
Court:  |  with---  
Low:  |  yes.  
Court:  |  everybody says, I’m entitled to ask many questions so as to be on my case, but---  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  you must first start out with a---a---the---what is the position of your Defence? What is the case of the Defence and then your questions are to---to build up your case.  
Low:  |  Correct, Your Honour.  
Court:  |  But so far I’m not been able to---  
Low:  |  Correct.  
Court:  |  to get from you what is---other than saying that you need all  
Court:  |  these facts and surroundings to build up your case. See, that’s the problem---  
Low:  |  Yah.  
  
  

29 Not only do I find that the trial judge’s intervention was practical in
order to save the court’s time, I also think that it was prudent for the trial
judge to be proactive in ensuring that he had a proper understanding of the
defence’s legal and factual position. The trial judge was also giving Mr Low
an opportunity to clarify the relevance of the line of questioning to the
issues at hand. I therefore dismiss Mr Low’s objection to this part of the
trial proceedings as well.

Cross-examination of PW4

30 Finally, Mr Low took issue with the trial judge’s interruption during his
cross-examination of PW4. Mr Low attempted to show that the appellant had a
wide authority in managing the School’s finances and that this even extended
to using the School’s funds for _non_ -School purposes. The trial judge found
this position difficult to comprehend upon first hearing it and so persisted
in clarifying with Mr Low whether this was indeed the defence he was making.
According to Mr Low, the trial judge had, in so doing, revealed that he had
prejudged the matter. The relevant extract which records this exchange between
Mr Low and the trial judge is reproduced below[note: 20]:

Low:  |  But he was given authority to use the funds in the way---as long as he doesn’t---he doesn’t abscond with the funds.  
---|---  
Court:  |  How can it be used anyhow---thing you like? The problem here is this, the 3 items based on his evidence, he said your client agreed that he will take care of it, he will pay for it. He says your client did not contribute to the Marist Brother common fund, he---your client has the money, so let him pay. The understanding based on his evidence so far, we’ve heard him from the morning until now, is that he---your client has the money, because for---from 2006 to 2010 he did not contribute to the Marist Brothers common fund, from his salary as a principal, which is I think quite substantial in a---any remu---remuneration, being a principal for so many years, easily a super-scale officer in the government and I know how much a super-scale officer earns, from the lowest to the highest. So that’s---that’s the thing. So how---how---I---I just don’t get why---why you are saying that because there are no rules, there are no discre---you’re given wide discretion all these years, you can do what you like with the fund, for purposes other than for the school purposes? I don’t---do---I’m not with you on this point. As a matter of law and logic it does not make sense. When---and especially when these are from donations, as you’re telling me. And people are asked to donate to the school management fund and it’s clear from the---the---he is a senior member of the Marist Brother. He is telling us that the 2 are separate entities and he keep it as that and the agreement between him and your client is that for those items he will pay out from his own pocket, not to touch---it’s quite---quite clear from his evidence, from the morning till now.  
Low:  |  But, Your Honour, you have not heard my client’s evidence. You have not heard---  
Court:  |  No---no---no, I---  
Low:  |  the other evidence.  
Court:  |  _I’m just saying up to now, lah._ But---  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  this is what we have heard.  
Low:  |  Yah.  
Court:  |  But i---_I’m just saying is---is it reasonable_ for you to take the stand that just because there are no rules, no guidelines issued by the---his board of management appointed by him on the use of the school funds and because all these years since 1984 he’s been doing what he likes, he can use the

Low:  |  Yes, Your Honour.

Low:  |  Yes, Your Honour. I---  
Court:  |  That is your case?  
Low:  |  Yah, that is my case.

31 It is clear that the trial judge was merely making the point that the
defence at trial, pitched at the level that it was, appeared to be somewhat
unrealistic. The trial judge’s preliminary observations of the defence’s
weakness from the manner Mr Low was cross-examining the prosecution’s
witnesses at this stage of the trial should not be confused with him having
made a conclusive predetermination on its merits. As the trial judge himself
had stated in the above extract, he was cognisant that there was further
evidence to be led by Mr Low on this point. What is of importance ultimately
is that the trial judge certainly did not prevent Mr Low from continuing with
his chosen line of cross-examination. I therefore fail to see where the denial
of justice lay.

32 Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.

Decision on sentence

33 I come now to the appeal and cross-appeal against sentence. The trial judge
imposed an imprisonment term of five months. I am of the view that this is
neither “manifestly inadequate” nor “manifestly excessive” in the
circumstances.

Is the sentence manifestly inadequate?

34 In both the trial below and in this appeal, the Prosecution relied heavily
on the case of _Goh Kah Heng (alias Shi Ming Yi) v Public Prosecutor and
another matter_ [2010] 4 SLR 258 (“ _Shi Ming Yi_ ”). The Prosecution
highlighted no less than 10 features which _Shi Ming Yi_ had in common with
the present case and therefore submitted that the starting point must be the
sentence imposed in _Shi Ming Yi_ , which was a term of six months’
imprisonment.

35 The trial judge agreed with the Prosecution that _Shi Ming Yi_ had many
similarities with the present case[note: 21], but not with the proposed
starting point of six months’ imprisonment[note: 22]. The trial judge was
careful to note that only four out of the six months’ imprisonment term
imposed in _Shi Ming Yi_ was for the offence of criminal breach of trust
(“CBT”) under s 406 of the Penal Code, whereas the remaining two months were
for the separate offence of providing false information to the Commissioner of
Charities under the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed). As the trial judge
was of the view that the “policy and punishment” underlying the Charities Act
offence had no resonance with the s 408 CBT offence faced by the appellant, he
reasoned that it would be more sound to adopt an imprisonment term of only
four months as the “starting point” here, given that this was the sentence
meted out for the analogous s 406 CBT offence in _Shi Ming Yi_.

36 In my judgment, the trial judge is correct to stress the importance of the
“policy and punishment” underlying a particular penal provision when assessing
the value of sentencing precedents. However, I find it curious that he should
then go on to adopt the sentence imposed for a s 406 offence (in _Shi Ming
Yi_) as the appropriate benchmark for a s 408 offence (in the present case).
This is because while both offences are essentially of the same nature, in
that they involve the dishonest misappropriation of property by a person who
occupies a position of trust, the maximum sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment
for a s 408 offence compared to the maximum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment
for a s 406 offence clearly illustrates that the former is an aggravated form
of the latter. In this connection, I note that Lee Seiu Kin J has described ss
406 to 409 of the Penal Code, which comprise the CBT group of offences, as
revealing a “sliding scale of severity”: see _Public Prosecutor v Tan Cheng
Yew and another appeal_ [2013] 1 SLR 1095 at [102]. Therefore, the trial judge
should not have adopted the sentence imposed for an offence of CBT
_simpliciter_ in s 406 as the starting point for the more severe s 408
offence.

37 While I would have adopted a higher starting point than four months’
imprisonment, I do not think that the final sentence of five months’
imprisonment which the trial judge imposed is “manifestly inadequate” in the
circumstances. In arriving at this view, I am inclined to give a fair amount
of weight to the following factors.

38 First, I note that the appellant has dedicated much of his adult life to
the School, having been its Principal for some 25 years. It is undisputed
that, during his tenure, the School achieved much success as evidenced by the
various awards conferred on it. While these must of course have been the
product of a collective effort from its students and educators, it is
certainly not the case that the appellant had played an insignificant role in
raising the status of the School. So much is clear from the testimonials that
speak glowingly of his contributions to the School and his attributes as a
Principal, and from the many awards he has personally received in recognition
of his dedicated service towards education. The Prosecution, however, relied
on Tay Yong Kwang J’s judgment in _Shi Ming Yi_ and submitted that it would be
wrong to place _any_ weight at all on the appellant’s contributions as they
did not involve a risk of “life and limb” and were therefore not sufficiently
“stellar”.

39 I am not impressed by this argument. Nowhere in the judgment of _Shi Ming
Yi_ did Tay J espouse the extremely narrow proposition which the Prosecution
had articulated in their submissions. While it was indeed the case that
Reverend Shi Ming Yi had undertaken physical risks in his efforts to raise
money and thereby received a discount in his sentence, there is nothing in Tay
J’s judgment which suggests that he was laying down an authoritative
sentencing principle to govern all future CBT cases. In any event, I am of the
opinion that it is unfair to characterise the appellant’s contributions to
society as being not sufficiently “stellar”. That trivialises not only his
contributions to the School and society in general, but also those of other
educators at large. I have therefore taken the appellant’s contributions into
account for, as was eloquently said by Tay J in _Shi Ming Yi_ (at [94]), “one
wrongdoing does not have to be so overwhelming that the many good deeds are
completely forgotten and interred with the bones”.

40 Secondly, I also note that the appellant is 67 years of age now. While I am
aware that there is no general rule _mandating_ a discount in prison time for
offenders of mature years (_Krishnan Chand v Public Prosecutor_ [1995] 1
SLR(R) 737 (“ _Krishnan Chand_ ”) at [8]), I am also unaware of any principle
which _disallows_ me from taking it into account for the purpose of
sentencing. I am therefore inclined to accord at least some degree of
compassion to the appellant on account of his advanced age because, as has
been said, “the rigour of imprisonment is, generally speaking, a harsh
experience for elderly offenders”: _Edward Alfred Braham v R_ [1994] NTSC 60
at [21], _per_ Angel J.

41 Thirdly, I also considered that the appellant has led a crime-free life up
to now. His status as a first-time offender is certainly a factor that is
generally accepted as having mitigating value: _Krishnan Chand_ at [14].

42 Ultimately, while I have explained why I find the five months’ imprisonment
term imposed by the trial judge to be somewhat lenient given the aggravated
nature of this s 408 offence, all things considered, I do not find it to be “
_manifestly_ inadequate” such that appellate interference is warranted. I
therefore dismiss the Prosecution’s cross-appeal against sentence.

Is the sentence manifestly excessive?

43 Mr Low argued that a nominal custodial sentence would suffice in this case.
In my judgment, that would be wholly inappropriate as it marginalises what
should be at the centre of a sentencing judge’s mind where CBT offences are
concerned and in particular, those by servants – _deterrence_ in both its
specific and general aspects. To the particular offender, a short custodial
sentence is no more than a slap on the wrist. Imposing a nominal custodial
sentence in this case will also send out the wrong message that the courts do
not take CBT offences by servants seriously. That is hardly desirable.

44 The trial judge found that (a) the appellant had misappropriated public
funds from a public institution and applied it towards a private purpose; (b)
the manner of his misappropriation was premeditated; and (c) the
misappropriated sum of $67,679.05 was by no means a small amount. Having
regard to these circumstances and the aggravated nature of the offence, I fail
to see how a term of five months’ imprisonment is “ _manifestly_ excessive”. I
therefore dismiss the appeal by the appellant against his sentence.

Conclusion

45 In light of the foregoing, I uphold the decision of the trial judge on both
the appellant’s conviction and his sentence.
