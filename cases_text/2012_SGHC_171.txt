Choo Han Teck J:

1 This was an appeal by the plaintiff–Husband against the decision of the
Family Court on ancillary matters arising out of the divorce of the parties.
The appeal was fixed for hearing before me in chambers on 17 July 2012. At the
hearing and before substantive arguments were heard, counsel for the
defendant–Wife (the Respondent in this appeal), Ms Ng Shoo Cheng (“Ms Ng”)
raised the issue of the Husband’s bankruptcy. Ms Ng objected on the ground
that the Husband had not obtained the “previous sanction of the Official
Assignee” to maintain the present action as required under s 131(1)(a) of the
Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed).

2 The Husband was made a bankrupt on 7 January 2010 but it was only when the
affidavit of assets and means was filed by the Husband on 30 July 2010 that it
was disclosed that the Husband was a bankrupt. Ms Ng and counsel for the
Husband, Mr Robert Leslie Gregory (“Mr Robert”), confirmed that the issue of
the Husband’s bankruptcy was discussed between them then, but because neither
was sure whether the Official Assignee’s consent was needed, no objection was
thus raised at that stage. The hearing before the Family Court on ancillary
matters was held on 24 August 2011.

3 The effect of the Husband’s non-compliance with the requirement to seek the
“previous sanction of the Official Assignee” to maintain the current action
renders the proceedings below null and void. To this end, Mr Robert sought to
salvage the situation with two arguments. First, he submitted that as the
Official Assignee’s sanction had now been given the day before the hearing
before me, his consent had retrospective effect to cure the previous non-
compliance. Plainly, the Official Assignee’s consent cannot be granted
retrospectively, which was also the point made in _Standard Chartered Bank v
Loh Chong Yong Thomas_ [2010] 2 SLR 569. Second, Mr Robert suggested that it
was open to this court to grant retrospective leave to salvage the matter.
Retrospective leave can be granted by the court to save proceedings otherwise
rendered null by operation of s 76(1)(c)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act where a
creditor seeks to proceed against the bankrupt in respect of a debt. Section
76(1)(c)(ii) provides that such action cannot proceed without “leave of the
court”. In contrast, s 131(1)(a) requires the “previous sanction of the
Official Assignee” for the bankrupt to maintain the action. The court cannot
usurp the function of the Official Assignee where it is statutorily provided
that it is the Official Assignee’s sanction which is required.

4 In the circumstances, I ordered the matter to be remitted to the Family
Court for re-hearing upon proof that the Official Assignee’s sanction has been
obtained. This will likely cause no hardship as the submissions and affidavits
will largely be as before. The Husband will, however, be free to raise before
the Family Court any argument that he might have used in this appeal before
me.
