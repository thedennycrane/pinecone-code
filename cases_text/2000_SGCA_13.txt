(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was charged
with and convicted of the crime of murder in causing the death of one Tan Eng
Yan @ Tan Ah Leng @ Lily (`the deceased`). He was sentenced to suffer death.
The offence was committed on 26 August 1998, sometime between 1pm and 2.30pm
at the deceased`s flat at Block 467, Tampines Street 44, [num ]08-140.  
  
We heard the appeal on 24 January 2000 and dismissed it. We now give our
reasons.  
  
**_Evidence led by the prosecution_**

****

The deceased and the appellants were friends prior to the killing. They had
known each other for some three years. There was no known animosity between
them. The deceased worked as a fruit-stall assistant at the market situated at
Block 475 Tampines Street 43. Her work for the day would normally end at about
1pm. In the afternoons, she worked as a part-time hairdresser. The appellant
was a fishmonger at a neighbouring stall in the same market.  
  
On 26 August 1998, at or about 3.15pm, the deceased`s daughter, one Chen Hui
Min, on returning home from school noticed a trail of blood leading to her
flat. The iron gate to the flat was wide open, with the padlock hanging from
its metal chain. She opened the wooden door and entered the flat. She found
the living room in a mess and there were blood stains all over the place. In
the toilet adjacent to the kitchen, she saw her mother`s lifeless body lying
in a prone position, with her face submerged in a pail of water. The pail was
placed under a tap which was still running. She called the police.  
  
Sgt Chua Chee San arrived at the flat some minutes later, at about 3.21pm. Sgt
Chua noticed that the deceased had sustained multiple injuries on her head,
back and neck. Both her wrists had also been severely injured, with the bones
exposed. He also saw that there were bloodstains on the toilet wall and the
floor of the flat. A bloodstained chopper lay in the kitchen sink. He further
observed that there was a trail of blood which ran from the flat to a parking
lot numbered `34` behind Block 469.  
  
The deceased`s husband, one Tan Cheng Guan, upon checking the flat later that
evening discovered that a sum of S$6,600 was missing. This amount consisted of
S$2,200 in notes and the balance in coins in denominations of 10 cent, 20
cent, 50 cent and S$1.  
  
Dr Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist from the Institute of Science and
Forensic Medicine who carried out an autopsy on the deceased, noted that she
had sustained a total of 58 injuries. The injuries consisted of fatal slash
wounds, multiple cuts, bruises, fractures and a ligature mark around her neck.
He certified the cause of death to be acute exsanguination or haemorrhage due
to multiple slash wounds. Four of the injuries were identified by Dr Wee to be
fatal and each of them were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
cause death. The four fatal injuries were:

(i) injury No 4, a deep slash wound on the left posterior lateral lower neck,
measuring 10 cm by 0.8 cm;

(ii) injury No 16, a deep slash wound on the right anterior lateral upper
neck, measuring 11 cm by 2.5 cm;

(iii) injury No 44, comprising a set of multiple deep cuts on the back of the
deceased`s left wrist, causing near total amputation of the wrist, leaving
only a strand of skin on the front of the left wrist; and

(iv) injury No 49, comprising a set of multiple slash wounds on the right
posteromedial hand and lower third forearm, also causing near total amputation
of the right wrist.  
  
In the opinion of Dr Wee, these fatal injuries were all intentionally
inflicted and were not caused accidentally. Injury Nos 44 and 49 were caused
by multiple blows of moderate to severe force, severely fracturing the
underlying bones. These injuries were sustained while the deceased was on the
ground trying to ward off those blows. The severity of the blows could be seen
from the fact that those blows nearly amputated both her hands. All the
injuries the deceased sustained were consistent with having been caused by a
knife or a chopper.  
  
The police took blood samples from the flat for examination. Dr Chuah Siew
Yeam from the Department of Scientific Services, Institute of Science and
Forensic Medicine, who conducted the examination told the court that certain
blood samples taken from the flat matched the DNA profile of the appellant.
Some blood samples, however, were not his. Nothing turned on that as it was
not his defence that he did not kill the deceased.  
  
The appellant was arrested on 31 August 1998. He was referred to the Alexandra
Hospital and was examined by one Dr Desmond Choo, who noted, amongst others,
that there were lacerations to his right big toe, right hand and foot, right
index and middle fingers and a laceration between the index and middle fingers
of his right hand. In Dr Choo`s opinion, the wounds were likely to have bled
when they were fresh.  
  
On the day of his arrest, the appellant led a party of police officers to his
motor pick-up bearing registration plate number GH 5364S which was then parked
on the third level of the multi-storey car park at Block 96 Havelock Road. The
pick-up was rented from one Chua Siong Huat, who ran a business of hiring
motor lorries, pick-ups and vans. Six plastic bags of coins hidden behind the
driver`s seat of the pick-up and another plastic bag of coins placed under the
air-condition unit of the vehicle were recovered by the police.  
  
On 23 October 1998 at about 11.25am, three police officers recovered two
transparent plastic bags of coins from Chua Siong Huat`s flat at Block 286B
Toh Guan Road [num ]21-32. The coins in these two plastic bags were payment
made by the appellant to Chua on 28 August 1998, being the rental of S$400 for
the pick-up.  
  
There was evidence that the deceased was a friendly person and mixed well with
others. But she was also fond of showing off by taking out stacks of notes
from her pouch and boasting that she had a substantial amount of money in her
house. The appellant had heard the deceased saying all these things. There was
also clear evidence from several other hawkers that as at the date of the
incident, the appellant owed them various sums of money. There was also
evidence to suggest that the appellant was in debt because he had lost money
in horse-racing.  
  
The account concerning the circumstances surrounding the killing of the
deceased was provided by the appellant in six written statements given by him
to the police. The first was made to D/SSgt Cher Kwong Chan shortly before his
arrest on 31 August 1998 (exh P168). The second was a cautioned statement
given on 1 September 1998, under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code
(`CPC`), to Insp Lim Song Chai of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
(exh P170). Thereafter, on four different occasions between 4 and 10 September
1998 the appellant gave four more statements under s 121 of the CPC (exhs P171
to P174). At the trial, the appellant did not challenge the admissibility of
any of the statements given by him. The statements were thus admitted in
evidence.  
  
As what were set out in the statements were vital to the charge, as well as
the defences raised by the appellant, it is necessary for us to set out the
relevant parts of his statements in extenso. They are as follows:

> _Exhibit P168_

> _Blk 467 Tampines on the 8th floor corner house. This male Chinese is known
> to me for almost a year and I used to address him as `Ah Meng`. I believe
> `Ah Meng` is a Malaysian._

> _Initially, I used a flower vase which was placed at the hall to hit
> deceased`s head and thereafter I used a chopper taken by me from deceased`s
> kitchen to attack her. Ah Meng also joined in the attack until she collapsed
> in the kitchen. Ah Meng pulled her head and forced it into a red-coloured
> plastic pail and left the tap water running over the deceased`s
> head.Immediately, both of us went in search for money at the flat. I managed
> to locate four plastic containers of coins at the store-room. Ah Meng also
> found some cash at the kitchen._

> _We fled the scene separately. Ah Meng escaped by the lift and as for me, I
> fled by going down staircase to the car park nearby. I also held the two
> containers of coins in my hands. I would like to clarify that two of the
> containers are metal tins. We escaped by using my pick-up No GH5364S which
> was earlier parked at Blk 469 Tampines carpark._

> _Exhibit P170 - cautioned statement_

> _I had no intention of murdering her. I went there with `Ah Meng` to find
> out the whereabouts of the tontine head. She told me that the address was
> written on a piece of paper which was at home and invited me to follow her
> to her house. She did not know `Ah Meng`. We took the lift to the 11th floor
> and walked to her flat at the 8th floor. She opened the door and we entered
> the house. `Ah Meng` was following us from a distance away. Once the door
> was opened, `Ah Meng` dashed into the house and close the door. Lily asked
> me who `Ah Meng` was? I told her that `Ah Meng` is my friend and asked her
> not to ask further. She became unhappy. She asked me whether we came to rob
> her and I denied. I told her to give me `Ah Poh` address. She told me that
> someone had given her the address on a piece of paper. I saw her started
> looking for it. Later, she told me that she could not find. I then told her
> that she was lying. She told me to leave the house or else she would scream
> for help. `Ah Meng` then placed his arm around her neck and they both fell
> down. The deceased grabbed a flower vase and I quickly grabbed it from her
> and placed it on the floor. I was afraid that she might break the vase or
> she might use it to hit me. Lily ran to the kitchen and `Ah Meng` followed.
> They struggled at the kitchen. I saw `Ah Meng` used a chopper to slash her.
> `Ah Meng` did not bring the chopper along. He got it from the kitchen from
> the washing basin. I presumed he got it from there. I told `Ah Meng` that he
> cannot slash her. `Ah Meng` told me that he had no choice and asked me to
> help him. Lily started screaming when they started struggling. After being
> slashed, Lily fell to the floor. `Ah Meng` used his hand to cover Lily`s
> mouth or neck. `Ah Meng` asked me to help him. I used the flower vase to hit
> Lily. Lily caught hold of my hand. I saw the chopper on the floor. I grabbed
> it and chopped her hand. I became daze and dare not look at her. I told `Ah
> Meng` not to kill her. `Ah Meng` said that if she survive, I will die. I saw
> `Ah Meng` pulled her to the bathroom. I had some blood stain on my arm and I
> washed it at the basin. I do not know what `Ah Meng` was doing with Lily in
> the bathroom. I knew that he turned on the water tap. I hurried `Ah Meng` to
> leave the house. `Ah Meng` asked me to look for some money. `Ah Meng` told
> me to go to the room to search. I just went into the room and opened the
> drawer and I did not search and take anything. I went to the storeroom. The
> door of the storeroom was ajar. I saw four tins of coins. `Ah Meng` asked me
> to take the coins. I went to the kitchen to get the paper bags and put all
> the coins in the paper bags. We only took the coins without the tins. I
> again walked to the kitchen and saw a wad of dollar notes and `Ah Meng` took
> them. I hurried him to leave. We carried the coins and left the place. I
> walked down the staircase and `Ah Meng` took the lift._

> _Exhibit P171_

> _
>
> 3 At about 1.15pm, I parked my motor pick-up at the car park behind block
> 469 Tampines Street 44 ... When I alighted from my pick-up, I saw Lily was
> walking at the void deck of block 467 Tampines Street 44 and I shouted for
> her. I walked across and met her at the lift lobby. She asked me why I was
> late and she told me that she was about to leave ... She asked me how much I
> was going to pay her. I told her that I was going to pay her three hundred
> dollars. I then asked her for `Ah Poh`s address and she said that she had

Exhibit P173  
---  
|  
Question 1: | In your previous statements recorded on 31 August 98 and 1 Sep 98, you mentioned that `Ah Meng` went to Lily`s flat with you. Who is `Ah Meng`?  
Answer : | There is no such person. I did it alone. There was no other person involved. I make it up when I was questioned.  
  
  
  

> _Exhibit P174_

> _... She ... started to search for Ah Poh`s address among a bundle of
> documents on top of the cabinet ... She then searched the storeroom. I saw
> some coins in containers when she opened the storeroom door. At that
> juncture, the phone rang and she answered the phone in Malay. The
> conversation was short and Lily told me that she was in a hurry to go off.
> Lily told me to leave. I refused to leave and told her that unless she give

> had described in my statement. I then left the house with two pails of
> coins. I closed the wooden door._

> _I wish to add that after I placed Lily`s head into the basin in the toilet,
> I came out and picked up the chopper from the floor and placed it in the
> washing basin. I washed my hands at the washing basin. That is all._

  
  
It should be noted from the statements of the appellant that the whereabouts
of one `Ah Poh` played a significant part in the occurrence on that fateful
afternoon. Ah Poh`s real name is Phai Sai Poh and she was called by the
prosecution to testify. She admitted having started a tontine group in August
1996 comprising some 17 members. The appellant was one of them. She
discontinued the group on 1 January 1998 as she was in financial difficulties
and was unable to pay out money owed to members who had successfully bid.
Because of that she went into hiding at the end of May 1998 and did not tell
anyone of her new address. She said she owed the appellant only $4,000.  
  
**_Defence_**

****

The appellant did not, at the close of the prosecution`s case, make a
submission of no case to answer. He gave evidence in his own defence and did
not deny having inflicted those injuries on the deceased. His defence was two-
fold. First, he inflicted those injuries under grave and sudden provocation
from the deceased. Second, that the deceased`s death arose out of a sudden
fight between the parties.  
  
The appellant said that he and the deceased were friends. He had borrowed
money from her as well as from others due to his gambling losses. He joined Ah
Poh`s tontine group some three years back. He had paid Ah Poh in respect of
the tontine a total of about $10,000. She had only repaid him $1,000 after
repeated requests. Thereafter, he could not locate her. Five days before the
date of the incident, the deceased told him that she had Ah Poh`s address.
However, in the next few days for various reasons, he did not manage to meet
up with the deceased to get the address from her. It was on 26 August 1998
that he finally met the deceased at the void deck below her flat. The deceased
told him that she could not find Ah Poh`s address and invited him to go up to
her flat to help search for it if he did not believe her.  
  
After some searching at her flat, she still could not find the address. So she
told him in a normal tone `... **_well, couldn`t find, you can`t find Ah Poh
you have lost some money, forget about it._** ` The appellant got angry when
the deceased again told him to forget about it. He accused her of being in
collusion with Ah Poh to cheat him. It was at this point that the deceased
started using abusive and vulgar language on the appellant.

> _Go home and fuck your mother. You are a man. How come you are cheated by a
> woman? You are a man being cheated by a woman. Are you a man?_

  
  
The appellant became extremely angry and told the deceased that no one had
ever used such abusive language on his mother. He, in turn, used abusive words
on the deceased, whereupon the deceased asked him to leave the flat, failing
which she would call the police. He then gave her a push and they both fell
down. There was a struggle and blows were exchanged. The deceased grabbed a
flower vase from the living room. She wanted to strike the appellant with the
vase but he grabbed it from her and put it on the floor outside the kitchen.
She ran into the kitchen. She then threw a porcelain cup at the appellant but
it missed hitting his head. The appellant took the flower vase from the floor
and told her: `**_You want to play?_** ` to which she retorted: `**_Don`t come
near_**. **_I have a knife here_**. **_I will kill you_**.` He then told her
that they could both die together. Another cup fell on the floor in the
appellant`s direction. He rushed at the deceased and hit her on the head with
the vase. He saw her stretching out her right hand and thought that she was
going to grab a knife on top of the flat surface next to the kitchen sink. In
his mind, it was either his life or her life. But he managed to grab hold of
the knife first and started slashing her on the neck. The deceased shouted
that she would kill him. She then grabbed hold of a piece of the broken vase
and tried to `jab` the appellant with it whereupon he slashed at her hands
until she became motionless. He said he was frightened. He then washed his
bloody hands. His right thumb and toe were bleeding. He proceeded to immerse
the deceased`s face in a pail of water and placed the knife which he had used
to slash her into the kitchen sink.  
  
Thereafter, the appellant made an unsuccessful attempt to search for Ah Poh`s
address in the flat. Instead he found some currency notes in an envelope and
coins of various denominations in containers. He took the currency notes and
placed the containers of coins into plastic bags which he took from the
kitchen. Upon realising that the coins were too heavy for the plastic bags, he
transferred the coins into two plastic pails and took them away with him. He
drove off in his pick-up.  
  
It should be noted that the significant difference between what the appellant
said to the court in his testimony and what he stated in the various
statements made to the Police was the absence in the statements of the abuse
and/or threats uttered by the deceased. He explained that this was not
mentioned in his statements because he was not questioned about the oral
exchanges between them. Neither did he mention in his statements that the
deceased had tried to reach for a knife next to the kitchen sink.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

The learned trial judge, Amarjeet Singh JC, rejected both the defences raised
by the appellant. He disbelieved the appellant`s testimony that the deceased
had used abusive or threatening words on him. Furthermore, his allegation that
the deceased had reached out for a knife or chopper on top of the kitchen sink
and had `jabbed` at him with a piece of broken porcelain were also disregarded
by the trial judge as the appellant had failed to mention any of these matters
in his six statements to the Police. As these allegations were only raised for
the first time at the trial, the trial judge drew the `irresistible inference`
that these allegations were afterthoughts, contrived by the appellant for the
very purpose of advancing his defence. With these being rejected what
remained, even as alleged by the appellant, were clearly insufficient to
constitute grave and sudden provocation. In fact, he held that the appellant
caused much of the provocation. The appellant was told to leave the flat but
did not. He insisted on remaining in the flat against the owner`s wishes. He
had also pushed the deceased first, causing her to fall. Her acts of raising
the vase and throwing the two cups at the appellant were thus merely
retaliatory of the appellant`s own show of violence. The trial judge could not
accept Dr Wee`s evidence that the appellant`s acts were those of a person who
had lost his self-control and was in a frenzy, as he felt that the
pathologist`s opinion `did not condescend on the totality of the evidence
adduced in court.`  
  
In any case, the learned trial judge held that even if the abusive and vulgar
words were indeed uttered by the deceased, the insults were not so grave as to
cause the appellant to lose his self-control to the extent of so viciously and
fatally injuring the deceased.  
  
As regards the defence of sudden fight, the trial judge found that there was
no evidence of any fight between the appellant and the deceased of such nature
or intensity for the appellant to fear for his life. What the evidence showed
was a savage attack by the appellant upon the deceased. The appellant had
taken undue advantage and had acted in a most cruel manner. Accordingly, the
defence of sudden fight was rejected.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

Before us, counsel for the appellant pursued only the defence of grave and
sudden provocation. The argument advanced was that the learned trial judge
placed too much emphasis on the fact that the appellant did not mention about
the utterance of the provocative words by the deceased in his statements.
Counsel argued that the appellant, being a fishmonger of low intellect, failed
to mention the said words because he did not understand the importance of
doing so.  
  
**_Provocation_**

****

Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides that culpable
homicide is not murder `if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-
control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who
gave the provocation ...` The `Explanation` to that Exception provides that
`whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence
from amounting to murder is a question of fact.`  
  
How Exception I should be interpreted and applied was recently considered by
this court in **PP v Kwan Cin Cheng** [1998] 2 SLR 345  where it held (at p
355):

> _As the law has developed, there are two distinct requirements for the
> provocation defence to apply: first, a `subjective` requirement that the
> accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation; and secondly, an
> `objective` requirement that the provocation should have been `grave and
> sudden`. The latter requirement involves the application of the `reasonable
> man` test accepted in**Vijayan v PP** [1975] 2 MLJ 8  at p 12; [1975-1977]
> SLR 100 at p 107 and cited in **Ithinin bin Kamari v PP** [1993] 2 SLR 245
> at p 250:_

> _
>
> `In our judgment, under our law, where an accused person charged with murder
> relies on provocation and claims the benefit of Exception 1 of s 300, the
> test to be applied is would the act or acts alleged to constitute
> provocation have deprived a reasonable man of his self-control and induced
> him to do the act which caused the death of the deceased and in applying
> this test it is relevant to look at and compare the act of provocation with
> the act of retaliation.
>
> _

  
  
However, the fact that the second requirement is to be determined objectively
does not mean that any characteristics of the accused, including mental
infirmities, could not be taken into account if they affected the gravity of
the provocation. But individual peculiarities which merely affected the
accused`s power of self-control but not the gravity of the provocation should
not be taken into account: see **DPP v Camplin** [1978] 2 All ER 168 at 175
per Lord Diplock and **Luc Thiet Thuan v R** [1997] AC 131[1996] 3 WLR 45.  
  
In **_Kwan Cin Cheng_** , it was held that in determining if the objective
requirement was satisfied, the emotional state of mind of the accused at the
material time could properly be taken into account as it would affect the
gravity of the provocation from the deceased. The purpose of this objective
test is really to deny the defence to persons who overreact simply because
they are `exceptionally pugnacious, bad-tempered and over-sensitive.`  
  
Some earlier authorities also appear to speak of a separate or distinct
requirement of proportionality, over and above the two requirements relating
to the defence discussed above. This proportionality test suggests that the
retaliation taken must be commensurate with the provocation offered which
caused the accused to lose his self-control: **N Govindasamy v PP** SLR 165
[1976] 2 MLJ 49 ; **Wo Yok Ling v PP** SLR 78  [1979] 1 MLJ 101  and **Koh
Swee Beng v PP** [1991] SLR 319  [1991] 3 MLJ 401 . In the light of the
discussion in **_Kwan Cin Cheng,_** the test of proportionality is probably
not a distinct requirement for raising the defence of provocation. It is a
factor to be taken into account in determining whether the objective test of
gravity and suddenness is fulfilled. Therefore, the fact that the retaliatory
acts may have been out of proportion to the provocation offered does not
necessarily mean that the defence must fail. This is because where the
provocation defence in Exception 1 to s 300 is raised, the accused`s acts of
retaliation would ex hypothesi always have been of an extreme degree,
resulting in the death of another person. An inquiry into `proportionality`
does little to answer the essential question of whether an ordinary person
would, upon receiving the provocation in question, have reacted in the same
way the accused did.  
  
**_Was the appellant deprived of his self-control_**

****

We now turn to determine whether the appellant had, in fact, been deprived of
the power of self-control. It is necessary to look at the objective facts.
Mere assertion would not suffice. In exh P172, the appellant said that he
started to slash at the deceased`s neck in order to silence her and to prevent
her from shouting further. This would indicate he knew what he was doing. In
exh P171, he categorically said that he set his mind to put the deceased to
death. These words show that the appellant had a clear purpose in mind when he
attacked a vulnerable part of the deceased`s body, ie her neck. In court, he
testified that as the altercation continued, it became a question of either
one of them dying. When the deceased attempted to grab him with her hands in
order to defend herself, the appellant aimed specifically at her hands and
chopped at them repeatedly. As soon as the deceased became motionless, the
appellant, despite claiming that he was frightened, nevertheless had the
presence of mind to sweep the broken pieces of porcelain into the toilet to
protect himself from being cut. Furthermore, instead of running away in panic
after the attack, the appellant took his time to wash his hands, placed the
chopper back into the sink and went round the flat looking for Ah Poh`s
address. He did not find the address but found some money (in notes and in
coins) of several thousand dollars, which he took with him. The way he went
about taking away the coins showed that he was very conscious at all times of
what he was doing. Taking all the foregoing aspects into account, they do not
represent the actions of someone who did not appreciate what he was doing.
What is just as significant is that, after the incident, he remembered and
made it a point to keep his appointments with Lee Hoo Guan (PW13) and Goh Seow
Ek (PW15), which were a little later that day. These two persons were the
creditors of the appellant. There was no irrational behaviour on his part.  
  
As regards Dr Wee`s opinion that the deceased`s injuries were likely to have
been caused by a person who had lost his sense of self-control and was in a
frenzy, we agreed with the trial judge that it was obviously a view based
purely on the numerous injuries inflicted by the appellant on the deceased.
The court was entitled to test and reject it in the light of the objective
facts, if that view was not consistent with those facts. In this instance, for
the reasons dealt with in the last paragraph, the trial judge was amply
justified not to accept that opinion.  
  
On this ground alone, the appellant would have failed in this appeal, as he
had not shown that he had met the first requirement necessary to establish the
defence of grave and sudden provocation.  
  
**_Was the provocation grave and sudden?_**

****

We next turn to consider the second requirement. The alleged provocation lay
in his assertion in court that the deceased had abused and insulted his mother
and himself with vulgar words. Furthermore, the deceased had attempted to
reach out for certain knives which were placed on top of the kitchen sink and
had threatened to use them to kill him. But these allegations were, however,
not mentioned in any of the six statements which the appellant gave to the
police.  
  
Before he gave the cautioned statement (P170), he was, as required under s
122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code, informed that:

> _If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court,
> you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court,
> your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad
> effect on your case in general._

  
  
It is not the appellant`s case that the above warning was not read out or
explained to him at the time he gave his s 122(6) statement. In fact, Insp Lim
Song Chai who recorded the statement specifically stated at the start of the
statement that both the charge and the notice of warning were read out,
explained and interpreted to the appellant in the Teochew dialect. The
appellant did not challenge that.  
  
In relation to the four statements given by the appellant subsequent to the
cautioned statement, s 123(1) of the CPC is pertinent and it reads:

> _Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an offence evidence
> is given that the accused, on being charged with the offence or officially
> informed that he might be prosecuted for it,**failed to mention any such
> fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could
> reasonably have been expected to mention when so charged or informed, as the
> case may be, the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for
> trial or whether there is a case to answer, and the court, in determining
> whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged may draw such
> inferences from the failure as appear proper** , and the failure may, on the
> basis of those inferences be treated as, or as capable of amounting to
> corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which
> the failure is material. [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant, being a fishmonger of
low intellect, could have failed to mention the crucial allegations in his
statements because he did not understand the importance of doing so at the
relevant time. In our view, this argument was plainly unsustainable. We did
not see how this argument could be valid as the caution administered was
simple enough. In our view the following observation of the trial judges in
**PP v Tan Boon Tat** [1990] SLR 375 at 388 [1990] 2 MLJ 466  at 474, which
was approved on appeal ([1992] 2 SLR 1), was on point:

> _... the warning is couched in very simple language which is easily
> comprehensible by those who read English. We do not see what else there is
> and how else one ought to explain the warning; it is certainly unsafe to
> simplify it or, on the other hand, to elaborate or amplify it; any such
> attempt may convey a wrong meaning or implication to the accused. It
> follows**that if an accused does not read and speak English, and the charge
> and the notice of warning are both accurately interpreted to him in a
> language which he understands, it would, in our opinion, amount to an
> explanation to him of the charge and the warning; he would have understood
> from the interpreter the substance of the charge and the implication of the
> warning.** [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
There was another reason why we thought the claim that the appellant was of
low intellect could not stand. In his first two statements he had the presence
of mind to think of `Ah Meng` to bear responsibility for the crime, which
person he later admitted did not exist. He tried to explain that it was the
way in which the police questioned him that made him think of `Ah Meng`. This
was never put to the police officers when they testified. So he was not of
such low intellect after all. He was clever enough to think of a fictitious
person to bear the brunt of the blame for the killing. And with that kind of a
mind, how could he have missed out those alleged abuses or threats uttered by
the deceased, or the actions of the deceased in trying to reach out for the
knives, if those things did in fact occur?  
  
What inference should ultimately be drawn under s 122(6) and 123(1) of the CPC
against an accused for an omission is really a matter of judgment for the
trial judge, who would no doubt consider it in the light of the nature of the
omitted fact(s) in relation to the charge the accused faced. Another pertinent
factor would be whether any challenge has been raised by the accused
concerning the adequacy of the explanation given to him. There could also be
other factors. But in so far as the present case was concerned, it was not
alleged that the explanation given was inadequate. Having heard the
appellant`s evidence, the trial judge was certainly entitled, in the
circumstances here, to draw an adverse inference against the appellant. There
was simply no basis for this appellate court to interfere with that
determination.  
  
Therefore, what remained to found provocation were just these: that the
deceased had failed to give the appellant Ah Poh`s address; that she told him
to leave the house and threatened to call the police if he did not; that, on
his refusal, she had lifted a vase intending to throw at him; that on being
pursued to the kitchen she threw one or two porcelain cups at him. In the
words of the trial judge:

> _I found that the accused in fact caused much of the provocation. He had no
> special relationship with the deceased. He was told to leave the flat. He
> did not. He was told that she would call the police. He still did not leave
> the flat. She was entitled to ask him to leave the flat and call for the
> police or eject him from it as it was her home. The accused was wanting to
> remain there against her wishes. He had also in pushing her and causing her
> to fall used physical violence on her first. Her raising the porcelain vase
> after that (which he grabbed from her), her throwing of two cups at him were
> as far as her acts were concerned objectively not grave acts of provocation.
> She was only responding to the accused`s laying his hands on her._

  
  
Looking at all the circumstances objectively, the only thing one could
consider the deceased to be at fault was that she could not find the address
of Ah Poh after having made a search. By no stretch of the imagination could
that have amounted to a grave and sudden provocation. Indeed thereafter, as
the learned trial judge rightly pointed out, it was really the appellant who
was creating trouble and the deceased was merely reacting. It was clear to us
that the appellant had grossly overreacted to the situation before him. Even
accepting that the appellant was angry at the deceased for failing to find Ah
Poh`s address, a reasonable person in the position of the appellant would not
have reacted to the situation in the way the appellant did with such extreme
violence. As mentioned before, the defence of grave and sudden provocation is
not to protect those who are exceptionally pugnacious, bad-tempered or over-
sensitive.  
  
The question may be asked what was the reason or motive for the killing. The
prosecution had not expressly suggested any motive and it was not necessary to
do so. Its only burden was to show that the appellant intended to inflict the
injuries caused, and this burden it had discharged beyond a reasonable doubt.
The fact that the appellant might not have gone to the deceased`s flat with
the intention of killing her was immaterial. There is no requirement in law
that a premeditated design to kill must be established. If the intention to
kill is proved to exist, however sudden such an intention was formed, that
would amount to murder: see **Shaiful Edham bin Adam v PP** [1999] 2 SLR 57 .
In this case the appellant did in fact kill the deceased.  
  
**_Judgment_**

****

For the reasons given above, we were satisfied that the defence of grave and
sudden provocation was clearly not available to the appellant and we,
accordingly, dismissed the appeal.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
