**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1 Wan Kamil Bin Md Shafian (‘the first accused’) born on 1 May 1967, Ibrahim
Bin Mohd (‘the second accused’) born on 18 November 1965 and Rosli Bin Ahmat
(‘the third accused’) born on 20 July 1970, all three from Singapore, were
jointly charged and tried before me for an offence of murder. The charge
against them was that on or about 8 August 2000 at about 11.45am, in
furtherance of the common intention of all, they committed murder by causing
the death of a 42-year-old taxi driver by name Koh Ngiap Yong, along Chestnut
Avenue, Singapore, an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the
Penal Code (Cap 224).

2 The prosecution evidence was that on 8 August 2000 at about 6.10am, the
victim left home, first to take his daughter to school and later to drive his
taxi-cab bearing registration No SHB 540C for hire. He did not return home
that evening or the next day. Alarmed by his disappearance, his family members
lodged a missing person report with the police. On the morning of 9 August
2000, the police were informed by a member of the public that a body of a
person was found in the bushes along Chestnut Avenue. The body was reportedly
first noticed by one of the three young school boys who were cycling along
that road.

3 A police fast response car was despatched to the scene. The first batch of
police officers at the scene were not able at first to locate the body of the
victim. But a little later they came across three school boys and with their
help the body of the victim was located in the bushes in a supine position
with a number of stab wounds to his chest and at the left neck. A handcuff key
with a metal ring was also recovered by the police officers at the scene.
Ambulance officer, Sylvia Ho who arrived at the scene examined the victim at
about 11.30am on 9 August 2000 and found him dead.

4 Forensic examination revealed that the victim had suffered a host of
injuries including four fatal stab wounds to his chest. According to Dr Teo
Eng Swee, the forensic pathologist, death of the victim was caused by the stab
wounds inflicted on his chest. Dr Teo further testified that each stab wound
on the chest of the victim by itself would have been sufficient in the
ordinary course of nature to cause his death. Dr Teo did not find any
defensive injuries on the victim. His conclusion was that the victim was
either unconscious or immobilized at the time the injuries were inflicted. The
estimated time of death was about 12 to 24 hours before the discovery of the
corpse.

5 On 10 August 2000 at about 4.55pm, the taxi of the victim was spotted at a
multi-storey car park at Block 628A Bukit Batok Central at car park lot No 53,
level D.

6 On 15 October 2000, following information all three accused persons were
arrested at various times and places in Singapore. The first accused was
apprehended at about 9.15am when he was stepping out of a lift of his block of
flats at Block 790 Choa Chu Kang North 6, Singapore. The second accused was
arrested at about 10.30am on 15 October 2000 while he was making his way
through the rear entrance of a house at 25 Jalan Pelapah, Singapore. The third
accused was also arrested on the same day at about 12.30pm at Block 236
Bangkit Road, #02-243.

7 Following the arrests, several statements were recorded from all three
accused on various dates by the police. Consequently, 16 statements, five from
the first accused, four from the second accused and seven from the third
accused were admitted in evidence without any objection from the defence, upon
the court being satisfied that they were made voluntarily without any threat,
inducement or promise from any-one in authority before or during their
recording. The statements thus admitted, after expunging portions therein

considered to be significant or material, are reproduced below:

_**  
First accused**_

(1) Oral statement by the first accused by way of an interview by ASP Lim Beng
Gee at SIS/CID on 15 October 2000 at 1525 hours (exh P-240)

> Q6. Can you tell me how the three of you committed the taxi robbery along
> Chestnut Ave?

> A6. Actually the three of us had agreed to commit robbery on money changer
> or people leaving the bank and gold-smith shop. Ibrahim and Rosli suggested
> to get a getaway car. Ibrahim said we could steal a car from any car park or
> parked along the road side. I agreed to it. Rosli said it may be problem
> because if the car owner make a police report, the police might trace it to
> us easily. Rosli then suggested we boarded a taxi and thereafter make use of
> the taxi to use it as a getaway car in committing a robbery.
>
> So, on that day, I remember it was a day before the Singapore National Day,
> i.e. 9 August 2000, we stopped a taxi along Bukit Batok Ave 6. Ibrahim sat
> in front. Rosli sat behind the taxi driver and I sat behind Rosli. Ibrahim
> told the taxi driver to drive to Chestnut Ave. When the taxi driver stopped
> along Chestnut Ave, along a quiet place, I told Ibrahim that we could ask
> the taxi-driver to stop there. Ibrahim then told the taxi driver to stop the
> taxi. As the taxi-driver stopped the taxi, I alighted. Ibrahim told the
> taxi-driver to get out, Ibrahim then walked round the front of the taxi
> towards the driver’s side. Rosli alighted and brought the taxi driver to the
> bushes. Ibrahim and I remained near the taxi. Shortly I heard the taxi
> driver cried out in pain. Rosli came to us later with a knife. I notice the
> knife has some blood stains on its blade. This knife is an army bayonet
> which I had bought it together with the 2 guns in the town of Songkla,
> Thailand. That day, I had carried along a Colt 45 automatic Pistol, it was
> kept in my waist pouch. The Smith & Wesson revolver and a pair of handcuff
> were kept in my Timberland bag. Earlier when I met Ibrahim and Rosli at
> Bukit Batok, I had already handed the bag, with the revolver and handcuff
> and bayonet, to Ibrahim.
>
> After Rosli came out from the bushes with the knife in his hand, the three
> of us left the scene in the taxi. Ibrahim drove the taxi. I sat in front.
> Rosli sat at the back. I remember the taxi was a TIB taxi and its
> registration nos started with ‘5’.
>
> Ibrahim drove the taxi to Bukit Panjang and then out to Woodlands. We
> stopped at the bus-interchange in Woodlands. We parked the taxi in the car
> park and walked to the shops where Rosli and I bought a shirt each. After
> buying the shirt, Rosli and I wore the new shirts and threw away the old
> shirts into the Rubbish bins. We walked around the money-changer shops,
> three goldsmith shops. Though there were opportunity for us to rob the
> money-changer and the goldsmith shops, I was half-hearted as my mind was
> still thinking the taxi-driver at Chestnut Ave. I told Ibrahim and Rosli to
> call off the robbery. Thereafter, the three of us got into the taxi. Ibrahim
> again drove the taxi. I cannot recall how we subsequently arrived at Jurong
> East later.
>
> At Jurong East, I recall we parked the taxi around St 21 near to a block Nos
> 25? We then walked around the shops separately. I saw there were two gold-
> smith shops. I subsequently went to a void deck of a block and sat there to
> wait for Rosli and Ibrahim. Here I wish to add that while driving from
> Woodlands to Jurong East, Rosli and Ibrahim had already planned to cut their
> hair because, while we were along Chestnut Avenue, we saw two cars driving
> past the taxi while Rosli brought the taxi driver to the bushes. Rosli and
> Ibrahim were worried that the two car drivers might be able to recognize
> their faces and hairstyles, so they decided to cut their hairs. Abot half an
> hours later, Rosli and Ibrahim came to join me at the void deck. The three
> of us the got into the taxi and Ibrahim drove to Bukit Batok. On arrival at
> the front of West Mall, Rosli and I alighted. Ibrahim drove the taxi to a
> nearby multi-storey carpark. A while later, Ibrahim came to join Rosli and I
> in front of the Bukit Batok MRT Station. We decided to go our own ways from
> there.
>
> I took a cab and went home. I brought along the timberland bag which
> contained the Smith and Wesson revolver and the pair of handcuff. The knife
> which Rosli had used on the taxi driver was also in the timberland bag.
> Rosli took a separate taxi and left. Ibrahim took a MRT train ride. I
> arrived home at about 5.00 pm.
>
> On arrival at home, I took a bath. Thereafter, I left home with the pair of
> jeans which I was wearing earlier and the knife which Rosli had used
> earlier. On arrival at the common rubbish-chute on the 4th floor of my
> block. I threw the pair of jeans and the knife into the chute. Both the
> jeans and the knife were kept in the same bag. When I threw them into the
> chute. After throwing the 2 items I went home. That’s all about the
> Chestnut’s case.

**(2)** _**Statement of the first accused recorded by SSI Zainal Abidin bin
Ismail on 30 October 2000 at 3.30pm (exh P-261)**_

> …
>
> 2 At about 10.00 am, I left home to West Mall by taxi. I had brought along
> with me a "Adidas" sports bag black in colour containing a ‘Timberland’ bag
> and wore a blue waist pouch which was blue in colour around my waist. I put
> the loaded ‘Smith & Wesson’ revolver with six rounds and a bayonet with its
> sheath in the ‘Timberland’ bag. At the side pocket of the said bag, a pair
> of handcuff was always there. The Colt 45 was placed in the waist pouch
> around my waist. It was loaded with 6 live rounds too. I was attired in a
> black round neck a t-shirt and blue jean with brown leather boots.
>
> 3 At about 20 minutes later, I arrived at West Mall and proceeded straight
> to the coffee shop. Rosli and Ibrahim were not there yet and I waited for
> them. About 10 to 15 minutes later, Rosli arrived and not long after that
> Ibrahim arrived too. Ibrahim was attired in a long-sleeved beige colour
> shirt and faded jeans. I could not remember the shoe he was wearing. Rosli
> was attired in black jeans and I could not remember the shirt and shoe he
> was wearing. Both of them knew that I had brought along the 2 guns when I
> carried the ‘Adidas’ sports bag. I presumed that both of them also knew that
> I had brought a bayonet and handcuffs since this was not the first time we
> had met to commit robbery. Both of them had seen the weapons before. All of
> sat at the coffee shop and ordered some food whilst we discussed about
> committing robbery. We do not have a specific target to rob but amongst
> other plans we discussed were robbing moneychangers, goldsmith shops and
> people coming out of the banks. During the discussions, Rosli and Ibrahim
> suggested that it would be best if we could get a getaway vehicle in our
> plans. My idea was to just run and stopped a taxi after committing the
> robbery but they disagreed by saying that the likely-hood of getting
> arrested is greater without a getaway vehicle. On hearing this, I tend to
> agree with them. Ibrahim suggested that the only way of getting a vehicle
> was to loiter around the car park and roadside, to steal vehicle where the
> owner who had left their vehicles unattended with ignition keys. Ibrahim and
> I agreed to this idea but Rosli had different views. He said that getting a
> taxi would be easier. Subsequently all of us and left the coffee shop. We
> loitered around the car park and roadside at West Mall particularly looking
> for such vehicle that we had discussed. About hour later, we could not find
> such vehicle. Whilst still searching for such vehicle, Rosli began to give
> up and further suggested that it would be better to use a taxi rather than
> to steal unattended vehicles. He added that the owner of the unattended
> vehicle would always report to the police and we might be caught. He added
> further that we should stop a taxi, tied up the driver somewhere, and used
> the taxi as a getaway vehicle. At first, I was quite hesitant to agree with
> him since we need a place to secure the taxi driver. At this juncture,
> Ibrahim and I were still observing vehicles parked along the road. Suddenly,
> Rosli crossed the road and flagged down a TIBS taxi passing by. He called
> the both of us and all of us boarded the taxi. Ibrahim was seated next to
> the taxi driver. I was seated behind Ibrahim and Rosli was seated next to my
> right behind the taxi driver. The taxi driver was a male Chinese. Once we
> were in the taxi, I was not comfortable about Rosli’s plan and was rather
> half hearted to go with it. I told the taxi driver to go to Woodlands. On
> hearing this, Rosli and Ibrahim were looking at me in disagreement since
> that was not the plan we had discussed. Before we boarded the taxi, I have
> told them that I know of a secluded place at Chestnut Avenue, which was my
> former kampong and that would be an ideal place to tie the taxi driver.
> Quickly, I changed my mind and told Ibrahim to tell the taxi driver to go to
> Chestnut Avenue. Ibrahim then told the taxi driver to go to Chestnut Avenue
> and the taxi obliged. It was about 11.30 am when we boarded the taxi.
>
> 4 Based on my recollection, the taxi driver travelled along Bt Batok East
> towards Hillview Road and came out to Upper Bt Timah Road after the
> Chartered Bank. He travelled along Upp Bt Timah Road and turned right into
> Chestnut Drive. He seemed to know the route to Chestnut Avenue without
> anyone of us directing him. Once the taxi turned into Chestnut Drive, I told
> him in English to proceed deeper into Chestnut Avenue and we past the
> private housing followed by a vacant land under construction. I told him to
> proceed further until we past a deserted road with undergrowth along both
> sides of the road. We reached the end of the road where the PUB Waterworks
> is situated. I know the place very well since it was my former kampong. The
> taxi stopped. We did not want to do it there since there is a guardhouse at
> the gate and I told the taxi driver to make a ‘U’ turn and he complied. As
> the taxi moved just after the bicycle trek to Bt Timah Nature Reserve Park,
> Ibrahim told the taxi driver to stop and he did.
>
> 5 Once the taxi stopped, Ibrahim told the taxi driver in English to get out.
> The driver was in a daze and just remained seated in the driver’s seat.
> Subsequently, he complied and got out of the taxi. At this juncture, Rosli
> got out and held the taxi driver as he appeared to run. Ibrahim got out too
> and took over the wheels whilst the engine was still running. I got out and
> stood near the front passenger door of the taxi. I saw Rosli was holding the
> taxi driver’s shoulder and pulling him to the bushes by the roadside on the
> left. I did not see Rosli handcuffed the driver but when he pulled him to
> the bushes, the driver’s hands were already handcuffed behind his back.
> Rosli was holding a bayonet in his right hand. I did not see when he took
> out the bayonet from the ‘Timberland’ bag.
>
> 6 I saw Rosli pulling the taxi driver into the bushes and there were
> movements there. I did not have a good view since it was blocked by the tall
> lallang. I could hear the taxi driver groaning soon after that. As this was
> happening, a car past by towards PUB Waterworks. I shouted to Rosli to hurry
> up. About a minute later, Rosli came out of the bushes. The bayonet in his
> hands was stained with blood and I believed that he had stab the taxi
> driver. I was shocked to see this since it was not part of our plan. What
> Rosli did was his own action and it was neither me or Ibrahim told him to
> harm the taxi driver. He boarded the taxi and seated behind Ibrahim who was
> driving the taxi. I sat next to Ibrahim.
>
> 7 I directed Ibrahim the route out of Chestnut Avenue. I directed Ibrahim to
> travel along a private housing estate leading to Petir Road. Once at Petir
> Road, I led him to Woodlands Road and travelled up to Marsiling Housing
> Estate and stopped at Woodlands, a place where there are several
> moneychangers, goldsmith shops, DBS/POSB bank and shops. …
>
> …
>
> 15 Q1: Did you cock the pistol and pointed it at the taxi driver when he
> refused to get out of the taxi?
>
> 16 A1: No. I just pulled out the pistol halfway from my pouch and showed the
> taxi driver. On seeing the gun, he got out of his taxi.
>
> 17 Q2: Was it your idea to ‘finish off’ the taxi driver and instructed Rosli
> to do so?
>
> 18 A2: No. Ibrahim also did not give any instruction to Rosli to do so.
>
> 19 Q3: Did you plan to rob Cisco officers escorting cash to the ATM machines
> at West Mall on 8th Aug 2000?
>
> 20 A3: No. Actually our main plan that day was to rob the goldsmith shop at
> Jurong East and that was when the idea of getting a getaway vehicle came
> about. However, after the unexpected stabbing of the taxi driver by Rosli,
> we did not stick to the plans. The reason being, I was never involved in a
> violent crime before, I felt uncomfortable about it, and feared of the
> uncertainties. The idea of robbing of Cisco officers escorting cash was just
> one of the plan but I was not serious about it.

> **_…

2 On 8th Aug 2000 at about 9.15 am, I left my Filipino girlfriend’s home at No
25 Jln Pelepah to West Mall by bus service number 51 …

3 I arrived at the coffee-shop at about 10.15am, and Wan and Rosli were
already there. We had breakfast and discussed about committing robbery that
day. We did not have a specific target but discussed on how to commit the
robbery. There were general discussion of robbing goldsmith shops, Toto booth,
moneychanger shops and Cisco officers escorting cash to ATM machines. I would
like to say here that Wan had a waist pouch worn around his waist, Rosli had a
black sling bag, and another black sling bag was on the table. Soon, when I
sat with them, Rosli pushed the bag to me. I took the bag and put it beside
me. The bag was heavy and I knew it contained a revolver because of the shape
when I touched the outside of the bag. I did not take it out to look at it but
Wan ever told me that he had 2 guns. One is a pistol and the other is a
revolver. I knew that the pouch that Wan was wearing contained a pistol and I
have seen it personally. He had showed it to me the first time we met at
Newton Food Centre when Rosli introduced him to me. This was about 2 weeks
ago. I did not know what were the contents in Rosli’s bag but I knew it
contained some weapons.

4 In the discussion we agreed to rob a goldsmith shop but did not have a
specific place yet. We realised that we needed a getaway vehicle. We came with
an idea of stealing unattended cars with their ignition key in it. We decided
that if we could not get any unattended cars, we would go for a taxi. We
intended to tie the taxi driver in a secluded place so we would be able to use
the taxi. There was no discussion about hurting or harming the taxi driver.

5 About 45 minutes later the three of us left the coffee shop and walked along
the road side and car parks near West Mall to look for unattended cars. As we
were walking along the road, we saw a police car coming out from the car park.
On seeing the police car, we panicked since we were armed. I told Wan that we
should not waste time looking for unattended cars and choose for the 2nd
option of getting a taxi and he agreed. Just as we were standing along the
roadside, I saw TIBS taxi coming towards us and I flagged it down. The taxi
stopped and all of us boarded it. I sat in front next to the taxi driver, Wan
was seated at the rear seat behind me and Rosli was seated next to him behind
the taxi driver. The taxi driver was a male Chinese in his 40’s. By then it
was about 11.15 am.

6 Wan told the taxi driver in English to proceed to Chestnut Avenue and he
complied. The taxi driver drove off and he seemed to know the route to
Chestnut Avenue without Wan giving directions. When we reached Chestnut Drive,
Wan the directed the driver to proceed deeper to Chestnut Avenue. I do not
know the place since it was my first time there and Wan seemed to know the
place well. We travelled past private housing and later came to a deserted
road with undergrowth along side it. We came to a road end and there is a PUB
or PWD main gate. The taxi stopped and the driver asked us where we actually
wanted to go. Wan told the driver to make a ‘U’ turn. At this time, Rosli and
I were carrying a sling bag and Wan was wearing the waist pouch that I had
mentioned earlier. The taxi driver complied and made a ‘U’ turn. About 200
metres away, just after the bend, Wan told the driver to stop.

7 The taxi stopped and I ordered him to get out by saying "Uncle go down". By
then the taxi driver thought we wanted to rob him. He wanted to give me his
money but I kept telling him to get out. He was in a daze and remained seated
in the driver’s seat. At that moment, I heard a cocking sound and when I
turned, I saw Wan pointing the pistol at the taxi driver. On seeing the
pistol, the taxi driver got out and I got out too and took over the wheel. By
then Wan and Rosli had also got out and Rosli held the taxi driver. Whilst
seated in the driver’s seat, I turned around and saw Rosli was forcing the
taxi driver to the bushes of tall lalang on my left side of the road. The taxi
was facing Chestnut Drive. Wan was standing behind the taxi.

8 I waited in the taxi and heard the taxi driver pleading from the bushes. I
could not make out what the driver was pleading about. About 7 to 8 minutes
later, Rosli came out from the bushes and boarded the taxi. I saw him holding
a bayonet that was stained with blood. He was also holding a pair of
handcuffs. The bayonet that Rosli was holding was a standard military bayonet.
I know about bayonet as I was in the army before during my national service.
Wan also boarded the taxi and I drove off. Rosli said to us that he had
dropped the handcuff key and could not find it. Wan directed me the route out
of Chestnut Avenue. As I was driving, Rosli told us that the taxi driver might
have died as he had stabbed him about 5 or 6 times at his chest. I just kept
quiet and so did Wan.

9 During the journey, Rosli took out a brown wallet and he told us that he
took it from the taxi driver. Wan told him to count the cash in it. Rosli
counted cash about $500 plus in $50 notes. Rosli also cleaned the bayonet and
his hands in the taxi by using a bottle of water and a piece of cloth. I asked
Wan where we should go next. Wan told me to find a place to park and directed
me the route to take. Although I have a driving licence, I seldom drive and do
not know the roads well.

10 I drove around for about 40 minutes and finally reached a car park. I
realised that we have reached Woodlands. I have been there before and I know
that is a shopping area with many shop houses, coffee shops and food centre. I
parked the taxi and all of us alighted. Wan and Rosli proceeded to a coffee
shop nearby whilst I cleaned the taxi when told by Wan. The reason being, we
wanted to clean off our fingerprints in the taxi. After cleaning the taxi, I
called Rosli’s mobile telephone by using a public telephone. Rosli’s mobile
phone number was 97450847. He answered and I asked him where he was and he
told me to meet him at the coffee shop where I had parked the taxi. I went to
the said coffee shop and waited for them. A short while later, Rosli and Wan
came. I noticed that Wan had changed to a new black round neck t-shirt. Before
that he was wearing a blue round neck t-shirt. Wan told Rosli to dispose off
the taxi driver’s wallet and he did by throwing them separately in 2 different
dustbins at the coffee shop.

11 Having done so, Rosli gave me $50/- and we left the coffee shop to the
nearby food centre. We sat at the food centre and we ordered 2 bottles of
Guinness’ stout that Rosli paid them. A moment later, Rosli left us and he
came back later wearing a new white t-shirt. He wore a black round neck
t-shirt before that. I do not know why Wan and Rosli changed to new attires.
As we sat drinking, Wan told Rosli that it was not part of the plan to stab
the taxi driver but since it had happened that way, then it must be his fate.
I think Wan said this to comfort Rosli because I noticed that Rosli became
quiet and looked worried.

9 Following information, police searched the locker of the first accused at
Cathay Bowl in a shopping centre at Chua Chu Kang and seized a bayonet wrapped
in newspaper. The first accused admitted that the bayonet belonged to him.
Another development was that after the arrest of the first accused, a team of
CID officers led by Ag Inspector David Ang also seized a long-barrelled Smith
& Wesson revolver, a Colt semi-automatic pistol, three pairs of handcuffs and
a bunch of five handcuffs attached to a small metal ring from the flat of the
first accused. Another pair of handcuffs was seized from the second accused.

10 Tests carried out by Mrs Tan Wai Fun, a scientific officer from the
Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) confirmed that the bayonet recovered
from the locker of the first accused had traces of bloodstains inside the
covering of the handle and the analysis of the bloodstains through DNA
profiling established that the blood was that of the deceased.

11 The prosecution also established through the evidence of another HSA
officer, Dr Tay Ming Kiong, that the handcuff key recovered from the scene of
crime was similar in composition, make-up, design and dimension to the
handcuff keys seized from the residence of the first accused. The
investigating officer, Insp Zainal for his part averred that the handcuff keys
seized from the first accused could unlock all the handcuffs seized.

12 At the close of the prosecution’s case defence counsel did not make any
submissions. Having however considered the evidence adduced including the
statements made by the accused persons as well as forensic evidence, I was
satisfied that the prosecution had made out a case against all the accused
persons which if unrebutted would warrant their conviction. Consequently, I
called on them to enter upon their defences and explained the courses open to
them. In the event all of them elected to give evidence on affirmation and
their respective testimonies in their defence can be summarised as follows.

_**

  
Evidence of the first accused

**_

13 On 8 August 2000 at or about 10.45am, the first accused met the second and
third accused, as earlier arranged, at a coffee shop known as S-11 at Bukit
Batok Central. They then planned to rob a goldsmith shop in Jurong East known
as Boon Lay Gems Store. The first accused had been to that shop before and had
surveyed the area. During the discussion the second and third accused felt the
need for a getaway vehicle. The options discussed were either to steal an
unattended vehicle or to seize a taxi from a taxi driver.

14 Their search to find an unattended vehicle was fruitless. Having spent 30
to 45 minutes in this enterprise in vain, the third accused commented that it
was troublesome to search for an unattended vehicle and they should not waste
any further time on finding an unattended vehicle. The third accused soon
hailed a taxi and all of them instantly boarded it. The first accused claimed
that he was initially hesitant to board it because he felt that if the taxi
were to be stolen, they would have to tie up the driver at a lonely spot
which, in his view, was rather cumbersome as compared to stealing an
unattended vehicle. He boarded the taxi, nevertheless. Once inside the taxi he
told the taxi driver to proceed to Woodlands as he was intending to abort the
plan to rob the taxi driver of his vehicle but both the second and third
accused immediately gave him a look of disapproval. He then directed the taxi
driver to proceed to Chestnut Avenue.

15 According to the first accused, in the original plan discussed by them
earlier, the second accused’s role was to drive the taxi, his role was that of
a lookout and the third accused’s role was to take the driver to the bushes
and restrain him by handcuffing him to some trees in the bushes. There was no
discussion however as to what should be done if the taxi driver tried to
escape.

16 The first accused added that their actual plan also included the aspect
that after they had carried out their robbery plan at the goldsmith’s shop at
Jurong East, they would inform the police of the whereabouts of the secluded
place where the taxi driver had been handcuffed and held.

17 In the event, the taxi driver drove the taxi to Chestnut Avenue as
directed. The second accused was in the front passenger seat; the first
accused was at the rear behind the second accused and the third accused just
behind the driver. After the taxi had reached the end of Chestnut Avenue where
the Public Utilities Board’s Works Depot was situated, the first accused
instructed the taxi driver to make a ‘U’ turn. Later, just about 200 metres or
so after the driver made the turn, the first accused told the driver to stop
the vehicle. The taxi driver obeyed and stopped. There were trees and bushes
on both sides of the road where the taxi had stopped.

18 Presently, the second accused told the taxi driver to get out of the
vehicle. The first accused saw the third accused taking out a bayonet from the
bag given to him earlier and tapping the taxi-driver’s shoulders. The taxi
driver who looked dumbfounded, immediately uttered the words: ‘I pay, I pay’.
He did not however, get out of the taxi.

19 In order to make the taxi driver dismount from his vehicle, the first
accused drew out his pistol from his waist bag. This made the taxi driver
comply and leave the taxi. At about this time, the third accused opened the
vehicle door to his right, got out and arrived at the driver’s door to block
the driver from fleeing. The third accused was then holding a bayonet in one
hand and gripping the right arm of the taxi driver in the other. At about this
time, the second accused also got out from the front passenger seat, swiftly
crossed in front and took the vacated seat of the taxi driver. The third
accused then propelled the taxi driver towards the bushes about seven to eight
metres from the rear of the taxi.

20 As the taxi driver was being led into the bushes by the third accused, the
first accused noticed that the former had been handcuffed with hands behind.
The first accused could not see what was happening inside the bushes except
for the fact that he saw both the third accused and the taxi driver jump over
a drain which ran along the bush edge. The first accused then re-entered the
taxi and sat inside. Moments later he saw an oncoming motor car and at about
this time he also heard a voice crying out in pain. He immediately wound down
the window – the first accused demonstrated the winding down motion by making
circular movements with his hand and shouted to the third accused ‘Cepat sikit
Li’ (‘Hurry up Rosli’).

21 A minute or two later, the third accused re-emerged from the bushes
carrying in his hands the blood-stained bayonet and a pair of handcuffs. The
third accused told the first and second accused that he had stabbed the taxi
driver.

22 Both the first and second accused kept quiet. The first accused was taken
aback by the unexpected turn of events. He was shocked. He did not expect the
stabbing of the taxi driver. It was not in their scheme of things.

23 The first accused immediately told the second accused to leave the area and
directed him to go to Woodlands. On the way to Woodlands, the third accused
informed them that he had pocketed the wallet of the taxi driver.

24 The first accused admitted that the bayonet used by the third accused on
that day was given to the latter by the first accused. He said that in order
for them to carry out their robbery plan, he had prepared three bags: the bag
prepared and given to the third accused contained a bayonet, a pair of
handcuffs, a ski-mask and a pair of gloves; the bag prepared and given to the
second accused contained a long-barrelled Smith & Wesson revolver, a pair of
handcuffs and a ski mask; and the first accused had with him a pair of
handcuffs, a ski mask, a pair of gloves, a hammer and a pistol.

25 During the journey from Chestnut Avenue to Woodlands, the third accused
told him that he had taken the taxi driver’s wallet which contained about
$500. The third accused then passed that wallet to the first accused for him
to have a look. There was no cash inside the wallet except for some personal
items of the taxi driver such as the taxi driver’s automated teller machine
(ATM) card and his National Registration Identity Card. During the journey,
the first accused also observed the third accused cleaning the bayonet with a
piece of cloth and water from a bottle that were found inside the taxi. The
third accused also told them that he had stabbed the taxi driver five to six
times and that the taxi driver was still alive when he left him.

26 The first accused was perturbed over what had transpired at Chestnut
Avenue. He decided to cancel all robbery plans for that day but did not convey
this thought to anyone.

27 On the way to Woodlands, they stopped by at Marsiling with a view to
purchasing some T-shirts. They could not find any shops at Marsiling selling
T-shirts so they drove to Woodlands. There the first accused bought a new
T-shirt changed into it and threw away the one he was wearing at a public
toilet. The third accused suggested to the others that they consume Guinness
Stout to take his mind off the killing that had taken place and so they did.
The third accused paid for the drinks and gave the first accused $20.

28 Soon, they left Woodlands for Jurong East where they had earlier intended
to rob a goldsmith’s shop. Although the first accused was not intending to
commit any robbery after the incident at Chestnut Avenue, he nonetheless,
accompanied the others to survey the goldsmith’s shop at Jurong East whilst
the other two went for their haircut. Later, he told the third accused that
there was a closed circuit television camera at the goldsmith’s shop, the
place was crowded and therefore it was not advisable to proceed with the
robbery plan. They then, abandoned the plan. The first accused claimed that
the stabbing of the taxi driver was still on his mind and he therefore,
decided to abort the plans for that day. The first accused then asked the
second accused to drive all of them to West Mall at Bukit Batok to take the
MRT home. There, the first accused collected the bags of weapons from the
other two and took a taxi home. Before all of them parted company, the third
accused distributed to each $120. When he reached home, he washed the bayonet
and took his shower. As he was not feeling too good, he threw one of the
bayonets, a pair of handcuffs, his trousers and a T-shirt into the dustbin
chute.

29 In sum, his defence was that there was no plan either by him or by any of
his companions on that day to stab the taxi driver. He also denied an averment
by the third accused that the first accused threatened the third accused by
pointing the pistol in the direction of the third accused uttering the words
‘finish him off’, when the third accused and the taxi driver were inside the
bushes.

Evidence of the second accused

**_

30 The second accused first met the third accused when the latter used to
frequent his mother’s coffee stall at Telok Blangah Crescent. Later, the first
accused was introduced to the second accused by the third accused. The third
accused had told the second accused that the first accused had a job which
required the second accused to drive a vehicle. The second accused exhibited
an interest in the offer made. Consequently, the third accused arranged for
the second accused to meet the first accused at the Newton Hawker Centre one
night. This was about two weeks before 8 August 2000. When both the second and
third accused were walking from Far East Plaza to Newton Hawker Centre to meet
the first accused, the third accused mentioned to the second accused that the
job the second accused was required to do was something illegal and not
normal.

31 At the meeting at Newton Hawker Centre, the first accused talked about
robbery and told the second accused that he would be required to drive a
Cabstar van of CISCO officers escorting cash for delivery to ATM machines. The
first accused also mentioned goldsmith shops, money changers and Toto booths
as the other targets. The second accused was not impressed. He told the first
accused that it was not easy to commit robbery with knives. Upon hearing this,
the first accused placed a bullet on the palm of the second accused. The
second accused was still sceptical and wryly commented that anyone could make
a locket from a bullet.

32 Later that night, when all of them were at a pub, the first accused showed
the second accused a pistol to further convince him. The pistol was shown to
him again whilst the first and second accused were in the toilet of the pub.
The first accused also told the second accused on this occasion that he had
another firearm at home. They parted company after the first accused informed
the second accused that they would meet again.

33 On 7 August 2000, the third accused contacted the second accused and told
him to meet him at the S-11 coffee shop at West Mall between 9.30 and 10.00am
the next day. When the second accused arrived at the appointed place, he found
the first and third accused seated at a table. He saw two bags on the table.
The third accused instantly slid a bag to the second accused without saying
anything. The second accused touched the bag passed to him and felt the shape
of a revolver. The first accused told them that the robbery target that day
was a goldsmith’s shop. They all then decided to secure a getaway car. Two
options were floated: the first was to look around for vehicles left
unattended at petrol filling stations or by people buying Toto tickets and the
next option was to get hold of a taxi, tie up the driver in a quiet place and
use that taxi. The seized vehicle was to be driven by the second accused.

34 They then left their meeting place and went around scouting for an
unattended vehicle. The search was in vain. Moreover, after they came across a
police vehicle nearby, they decided to abandon their plan to spirit an
unattended vehicle. Soon, the second accused flagged down a taxi driven by the
victim and all three boarded it. The first accused instructed the taxi driver
to proceed to Chestnut Avenue.

35 The second accused added that when all of them discussed the second option
at the S-11 coffee shop, the plan was to tie up the taxi driver in a quiet
place and use the taxi. No decision was however, made as to who would tie up
the taxi driver or who would be the lookout. His role had already been
determined, that was, to drive the vehicle.

36 When all of them boarded the taxi the second accused occupied the front
passenger seat. The first accused took his seat at the rear behind the second
accused and the third accused behind the taxi driver.

37 The second accused denied the first accused’s claim that the latter
initially instructed the taxi driver to go to Woodlands. According to him, the
first accused was the one who directed the taxi driver to proceed to Chestnut
Avenue. The second accused did not know at that time where Chestnut Avenue
was.

38 In the event, the taxi reached the end of Chestnut Avenue. There the first
accused told the taxi driver to make a ‘U’ turn. About some distance away from
where the taxi made the ‘U’ turn, still at Chestnut Avenue, the first accused
asked the taxi driver to stop. The second accused did not know why the first
accused had asked the taxi driver to stop. All the same, the second accused
said to the taxi driver: ‘Uncle, go down.’ The taxi driver did not budge.
Suddenly the first accused took out his pistol, cocked it and pointed it close
to the face of the taxi driver.

39 The taxi driver offered to give them the money he had with him. The offer
was declined and the first accused ordered the taxi driver to get out. As soon
as the taxi driver got out of the taxi, the second accused swiftly exited from
his seat, crossed the vehicle in front and occupied the driver’s seat.

40 The first and third accused were then close to the taxi driver. The third
accused was holding him. As the second accused was about to adjust the rear
view mirror of the vehicle, he happened to turn back and observed that the
third accused and the taxi driver close to the bushes. The first accused was
somewhere behind the taxi holding his pistol in his right hand. The second
accused saw nothing else.

41 The second accused then started playing with the gear of the vehicle and
adjusted the seat. He also opened the bag which was given to him at the S-11
coffee shop earlier, took out the revolver inside and looked at it. Just about
this time, there was a motor vehicle approaching them from the opposite
direction and was heading towards the PUB Waterworks situated at the end of
Chestnut Avenue. After the vehicle had passed the taxi he was in, the first
and the third accused were seen returning to the taxi, the first accused
seated himself in front and the third accused behind.

42 When the third accused re-entered the taxi the second accused noticed that
he was holding a handcuff and the bayonet. At this point of his testimony, the
second accused was asked to clarify a segment in his statement to the police
(P-244, para 2 at page 237 of the PI notes) where he had stated: ‘I saw Rosli
and Wan pulling the taxi driver to bushes.’ as against his present testimony
in court. The second accused declared that he did not actually see both of
them pulling the taxi driver and going into the bushes (see pages 812 to 818
of the NE).

43 The second accused observed that the bayonet the third accused was holding
was stained with blood. A little later, the third accused, after mentioning
that he had dropped the handcuff key, told the others that he had stabbed the
taxi driver five or six times and that the latter may die. The second accused
thought to himself then that they hadn’t even started to commit the planned
robbery yet they had already committed a murder (page 822 of the NE).

44 The first accused told the third accused not to worry about the handcuff
key. The third accused also told the others that he had taken the wallet of
the victim and that it contained about $500 to $600. Presently, the second
accused was directed by the first accused to drive on and the second accused
complied with the direction. The first accused directed him along Chestnut
Avenue through Marsiling and thence to Woodlands. On the way, the first
accused also showed the second accused how to use the revolver which had been
given to him earlier.

45 Once they were at Woodlands, as directed by the first accused, the second
accused cleaned the taxi to remove the fingerprints left inside. The second
accused said that the claim of the first accused that the latter called out to
the second accused to hurry up whilst being seated inside the vehicle was not
true.

46 The rest of the account narrated by the second accused was by and large
similar to that of the first accused except perhaps in relation to some minor
aspects. At Woodlands despite the three of them combing the area, no
particular target was found appropriate for the robbery. There, the first and
the third accused had a change of clothes. Later, all of them left for Jurong
East. At Jurong East, once again the first accused instructed the second
accused to clean the taxi of fingerprints. After cleaning the taxi and parking
it close by, when the second accused arrived near a goldsmith’s shop, the
first accused told him that he was aborting the robbery plan as there were
surveillance cameras in that shop.

47 Later, the second and third accused had a haircut at Jurong East. Soon,
they left Jurong East for West Mall. There again, the second accused was told
to clean the taxi thoroughly of the fingerprints. The second accused parked
the taxi in a multi-storey car park nearby and did the cleaning. Subsequently,
all of them decided to watch a movie and once it was over the second accused
handed over to the third accused the bag of weapons which was provided to him
earlier. He then left the place. The second accused confirmed that he received
altogether $120 from the monies found in the wallet of the deceased driver:
$50 whilst they were in Woodlands and $70 just about the time he was leaving
West Mall for home.

48 In essence, the defence of the second accused was that his role on that day
was only to act as a driver of the getaway vehicle in the planned robbery and
he would not have used and did not have the intention to use the firearm in
his possession to cause injury to anyone. He never intended to cause any
physical injury to the taxi driver. The plan of that day was only to tie up
the taxi driver and relieve him of his taxi and nothing more.

Evidence of the third accused

**_

49 The third accused who was a forklift driver first met the first accused
sometime at the end of June or early July 2000 at Chua Chu Kang MRT Station.
Subsequently they met for drinks on three occasions. The third accused also
visited the house of the first accused for the first time in July 2000.

50 On that occasion the first accused showed him two toy gun lighters and a
while later, the first accused showed him a Colt 45 pistol and a short sword.
The third accused was shocked on seeing them. The first accused told him at
that stage: ‘this thing’ referring to the firearm ‘can make money’ (page 1047
of the NE). The third accused responded to that by saying: ‘Are you a mad pig
or what?’ The first accused retorted: ‘You have tatoos on your body, why
should you be afraid?’ The first accused informed the third accused that he
had obtained the pistol from Thailand.

51 The first accused further took out a magazine with bullets and requested
the third accused to hold it in his hands to convince him that the objects
were genuine. The first accused also cocked the pistol and demonstrated the
use of the pistol.

52 There was a second visit by the third accused to the first accused’s house
two days after his first visit. This time, the third accused was shown a
revolver. The first accused told him that the Colt 45 was for his use whereas
the third accused could use the revolver if he were to accompany him to commit
robbery. The revolver shown to him was one of the weapons produced at the
trial ie, the Smith & Wesson long barrelled revolver.

53 The third accused met the first accused again about two or three days later
at a coffee shop at Jurong East. The first accused in fact wanted the third
accused to accompany him to survey Boon Lay Gems Pte Ltd, a goldsmith shop at
Jurong East with a view to committing robbery.

54 The third accused was not prepared to join in the robbery. He explained to
the first accused that it would be difficult to run away from the scene as
there was no getaway vehicle. He reasoned that if one were to rob a jewellery
shop, the loot was bound to be heavy and without a getaway vehicle it would be
difficult to carry it. The first accused did not persist in his plans that day
although he had brought with him two bags – one Adidas sports bag and another
Timberland sling bag. These were produced at the trial and shown to be
containing weapons.

55 The third accused had become acquainted with the second accused since about
1999. He used to go to the coffee shop where the latter worked. Later, both of
them became drinking companions. The third accused claimed that two or three
days after he had been out with the first accused at Jurong East, the first
accused telephoned the third accused and asked him whether he was ready to
commit robbery. The third accused did not respond and remained silent. The
first accused then remarked that the third accused should think carefully
before anything happened to him. The third accused construed those words as a
threat. He became apprehensive since the first accused abruptly put down the
receiver of the telephone after those remarks.

56 Two days later, the first accused called the third accused again and
inquired where the latter was. The third accused replied that he was at home.
Soon, the first accused appeared at his doorstep. The third accused was
frightened by this sudden appearance. Eventually, both of them repaired to a
coffee shop where the third accused asked the first accused whether he had
made a decision to join the first accused in his plans to commit robbery. This
time too, the third accused remained silent.

57 The first accused asked the third accused whether he knew any person with
driving skills, in great need of money and would be interested in joining
them. The third accused thought of the second accused as the latter’s coffee
shop had been closed for refurbishment. The third accused mentioned the second
accused to the first accused. In the event, the third accused contacted the
second accused and told him that there was work to be done and the work
involved driving. Subsequently, arrangements were made by the third accused to
introduce the second accused to the first accused.

58 Not long after the three of them met at Newton Hawker Centre for an
introductory meeting. On the day, when the third and the second accused were
on their way to Newton Hawker Centre, the third accused already told the
second accused that the work cut out for him entailed going against the law,
that the first accused possessed a pistol and was planning to commit robbery
(page 1065 of the NE).

59 At the meeting at the Newton Hawker Centre, the first accused asked the
second accused that if the latter were to be given an opportunity would he
take it. The second accused’s response was: ‘If you want to commit this by
using knife or parang, you might as well forget it.’ (page 1067 of the NE). To
convince the second accused that the first accused meant business, the latter
held the hand of the second accused and gave him something which the third
accused could not see. The second accused immediately intoned that: ‘this
thing anybody could have … and make [it] into a locket.’ The purported reply
of the first accused was that it was for real: ‘I truly have it.’ (page 1068
of the NE).

60 They then went on to discuss possible targets including CISCO cash delivery
vehicles, jewellery shops, money changers and even illegal bookies at the turf
club. When the first accused mentioned that they would be able to rake in
about S$5 million from their operation, the third accused agreed to join in
the enterprise. The third accused was aware that the first accused was a
former CISCO officer. Later, they left the Newton Hawker Centre to a pub
called Kamasutra for drinks.

61 The third accused met the first accused again a week before 8 August 2000
at a coffee shop. The first accused again mentioned the subject of robbery. On
this occasion, the first accused told the third accused that he had just taken
a look at a Toto booth at Yew Tee MRT Station as one of their targets. The
third accused warned him immediately that there were many people at the Toto
booth and worse still, the booth was located inside the supermarket. Nothing
eventful transpired and both of them left the area thereafter.

62 The next occasion they met was on 8 August 2000. The previous night the
first accused telephoned the third accused and told him to be at West Mall at
10.00am. and also to inform the second accused to be there. The first
accused’s message was that he was going to ‘make a lobang’, meaning that he
wanted to commit robbery. The third accused got in touch with the second
accused and told him to be at West Mall at the appointed time. The third
accused did not however tell the second accused the purpose of the meeting.

63 On the morning of 8 August 2000, after being reminded of the appointment by
the first accused, the third accused met the latter at the entrance of West
Mall. The second accused had yet to arrive. The first accused in the meantime
took the third accused to a cash-on-line booth where the Cabstar van was
likely to be parked, a jewellery shop and a moneychanger at the West Mall,
telling him that those were the possible targets. They then sauntered around
and eventually seated themselves at the S-11 coffee shop where they awaited
the arrival of the second accused.

64 Whilst waiting for the second accused, the first accused opened the Adidas
sports bag that was with with him and took out two sling bags from it. He
indicated that one of the two bags was for the second accused and the other
for the third accused. The first accused told him that the bag meant for the
third accused contained a bayonet and a pair of handcuffs, a ski-cap and a
pair of gloves. The third accused then opened the bag to look at its contents.

65 About 20 to 30 minutes later, the second accused arrived. The third accused
then pushed the bag which was meant for the second accused towards him. The
first accused then talked about the targets he had shown the third accused
earlier. The first accused also mentioned the target at Jurong East which the
first and the third accused had surveyed previously. The first accused
intimated to the other two that the target for that day would be the CISCO
Cabstar van or the jewellery shop at Jurong East.

66 Then their discussion turned towards their escape plan. They all agreed to
secure a getaway vehicle. The second accused suggested stealing an unattended
vehicle from a petrol kiosk, failing which they would hail a taxi and
dispossess the driver.

67 Their search for an unattended vehicle was unsuccessful. Further, when they
observed a passing police vehicle they started to panic. At this juncture, the
third accused noticed that the first and second accused were engaged in a
brief conversation after which the second accused was seen crossing the road
and stopping a taxi. It was then the first accused told the third accused:
‘Li, you have to finish the taxi driver.’ (page 1090 of the NE). The third
accused was confused by this remark. He was wondering whether the first
accused was joking or serious. But he did not seek any clarification from the
first accused and remained silent.

68 In the event, all of them boarded the taxi. The first accused gave
directions to the taxi driver to take them to Chestnut Avenue. When they
arrived at the end of Chestnut Avenue, there was a bit of confusion.
Presently, the first accused told the taxi driver to make a ‘U’ turn. About
200 metres from where the taxi driver made the ‘U’ turn, the first accused
asked the taxi driver to stop. The second accused said something to the taxi
driver at this stage but the third accused could not quite make out what it
was. At that juncture, the third accused took out the bayonet from his bag,
unsheathed it and tapped the taxi driver’s left waist in order to make the
taxi driver get out of the taxi. The taxi driver did not leave the taxi.
Instead he said: ‘I pay, I pay.’ Suddenly, the first accused drew out his
pistol, cocked it, pointed it at the taxi driver and ordered him to get out.

69 In the meantime, the first accused also nudged the third accused with his
knee, signalling the third accused to get down and prevent the taxi driver
from escaping. The scared taxi driver unfastened his seat belt and alighted
from his taxi. The third accused was frightened by the developments. He felt
that it was unnecessary for the first accused to point the pistol at the taxi
driver for after all the third accused had already taken out his bayonet.

70 The third accused quickly came out of the taxi and held on to the taxi
driver whilst the second accused came out of the vehicle and occupied the
driver’s seat. The first accused handed a pair of handcuffs to the third
accused and asked him to handcuff the taxi driver. He also instructed the
third accused to take the taxi driver into the bushes.

71 The third accused followed the instructions and led the taxi driver into
the bushes about two metres away from the rear of the taxi whilst the first
accused stood on the road holding the pistol in his hand. When the third
accused led the taxi driver into the bushes, his intention was to tie him up
although the first accused did not provide him with any rope for that purpose.
He thought of handcuffing the taxi driver to a tree (pages 1102 to 1103 of the
NE).

72 As the third accused was propelling the taxi driver into the thicket, the
taxi driver tripped and fell into a ditch. The first accused came to the
assistance of the third accused to help pull the taxi driver out of the ditch
so that the third accused could take him farther into the bushes with the taxi
driver. Whilst in the bushes, the taxi driver tripped and fell again. The
third accused asked him to get up. The taxi driver replied that he could not
get up. Since the third accused could not raise the fallen taxi driver by
himself, he thought of asking the first accused for help.

73 The third accused instantly turned around and asked the first accused to
assist him in raising the taxi driver. Instead of coming to his assistance,
the first accused pointed his pistol at the third accused and told him to
finish the taxi driver off (pages 1107 and 1108 of the NE).

74 The third accused did not know what to do. He was wondering why the first
accused had asked him to kill the taxi driver. He looked at the first
accused’s face. The first accused looked serious. The third accused was afraid
that the first accused would shoot him if he did not comply. In that state of
fear, he covered the mouth of the taxi driver and stabbed him five to six
times in the region of his chest.

75 At that moment, a motor car passed by. Presently, the first accused, after
concealing his pistol, shouted to the third accused to be quick and to
retrieve the wallet of the taxi driver. The third accused thereafter pulled
out the taxi driver’s wallet from his front trouser pocket and also removed
the handcuffs from the taxi driver. Another vehicle passed by whilst he was
doing this.

76 The taxi driver was motionless when the third accused re-emerged from the
bushes. Once outside, he asked the first accused: ‘How is that this thing can
happen this way?’ (page 1112 of the NE). The first accused’s explanation was
that the taxi driver had seen his firearm. The third accused asked him why he
had taken out his firearm in the first instance. The answer was that it was
because the taxi driver did not want to come out of the taxi when asked. The
first accused also commented that it was the taxi driver’s fate. The third
accused was at that stage somewhat fearful of the first accused since the
latter did not appear to be normal.

77 After both of them had re-boarded the taxi, the first accused instructed
the second accused to drive to Woodlands. During the journey, the third
accused handed the wallet of the taxi driver to the first accused. After
counting the money inside, the first accused returned all the cash to the
third accused whilst retaining the wallet. The first accused then gave him a
bottle of water which was inside the taxi and asked the third accused to wash
the bayonet as well as the third accused’s hands. He told the first accused
that he had lost the key to the handcuff. The third accused then announced to
the other two that he had stabbed the taxi driver four to five times and it
was possible that the taxi driver had ‘gone’ (page 1118 of the NE).

78 The third accused claimed that there was altogether $700 in cash in the
wallet of the taxi driver. Initially, he retained the money but later he gave
the others $200 each and used the balance to pay for the food and drinks they
had consumed that day.

79 At Woodlands, the first accused instructed the second accused to clean the
taxi of fingerprints. All three later went to survey several money changers
before having some Guinness Stout. There was further discussion concerning
robbery targets. The third accused claimed that he felt confused at that stage
and remained quiet when the first accused asked him why the third accused had
stabbed the taxi driver. The third accused and the first accused had also
changed their shirts.

80 All three subsequently went to Jurong East. There the first and the third
accused went to look at the jewellery shops which they had observed earlier on
whilst the second accused went to rid the taxi of fingerprints. However, they
later aborted their plans to rob the jewellery shop as it was noticed that the
shop had been fitted with a closed circuit television camera. The first
accused then asked the second and third accused to have their haircut at a
barber shop so that it would not be possible for anyone to identify them. Soon
they proceeded to a movie theatre to watch a film. Thereafter the second and
the third accused returned the bags containing the weapons to the first
accused and departed for their respective destinations.

81 In the main, the testimony of the third accused appeared to be that, if not
for the first accused pointing the pistol at him and instructing him to finish
off the fallen taxi driver, he would not have stabbed him as he did. His
intention at all relevant times was merely to restrain the taxi driver by
handcuffing him to a tree in the thicket.

Closing speeches

**_

82 Substantial and lengthy addresses were made both by the defence and the
prosecution at the close of the case. Suffice it if I highlighted only the
salients in the said submissions.

_**

  
The first accused

**_

83 As regards the first accused, his counsel submitted that he had no
intention to harm the taxi driver in any way; that intention belonged to the
third accused alone and at any rate the prosecution had failed to prove the
requisite ingredients of s 34 (common intention provision) of the Penal Code
which formed part of the charge. Insofar as is material, paras 3, 19, 20 and
68 of counsel’s submission read as follows:

_**  
Paras 3, 19, 20 and 68 of the submission:**_

> 3\. The Prosecution sought to adduce evidence that:-
>

>> (1) the three accused persons had a common intention to rob the deceased;
and/or

>>

>> (2) the three accused persons had a common intention to rob the deceased of
his taxi; and

>>

>> (3) Rosli murdered the taxi driver in furtherance of that common intention.

>
> 19\. From the above it is submitted that there is preponderance of evidence
> that
>

>> (a) the common intention of the three accused persons was to steal a taxi
from the taxi driver;

>>

>> (b) there was a common intention to ‘tie-up’ i.e. immobilise the taxi
driver while the taxi was to be used in a robbery

>>

>> (c) there was no common intention nor discussion to hurt the taxi driver

>>

>> (d) Wan had the intention to inform the Police of the whereabouts of the
taxi driver after the execution of the intended robbery.

>
> 20\. It is further submitted that there was no intention to physically harm
> the taxi driver other than to tie him up. If ever there was any intention to
> harm the taxi driver in any way, that intention was contemplated by and
> belonged to Rosli, and Rosli alone.
>
> 68\. It is humbly submitted that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether
> the necessary ingredients of Section 34 have been satisfied as regards Wan.
> As such we humbly pray that Wan be acquitted.

84 Counsel for the first accused suggested that the offence committed by the
first accused on the day in question was only that of robbery of the taxi and
if at all, he could be punished only under ss 392, 394 or 397 of the Penal
Code and nothing else.

_**

  
The second accused

**_

85 The arguments advanced on behalf of the second accused was that the second
accused did not share nor did he have the common intention ascribed to him by
the prosecution. Counsel argued that the second accused’s role was to act as a
getaway driver in the robbery planned for that day and the killing of the taxi
driver was never in the equation. It was further submitted that he did not
know that the third accused was armed with a bayonet nor was he aware of any
plan to cause hurt to the taxi driver; the plan was merely to tie up the taxi
driver in a secluded place, take his taxi and use it as an escape vehicle
after the proposed robbery planned at Jurong East.

86 In this connection, the following segments of counsel’s submission are
relevant:

_**  
Paras 8, 9, 19, 25, 32, 33 and 34 of the submission:**_

> 8\. The Second Accused denies that he intended the death of the victim, or
> realised that either the First Accused or the Third Accused would cause his
> death. The Second Accused denies that he knew about the presence of the
> bayonet or realised it would be used in committing robbery of the taxi or to
> stab the deceased.
>
> 9\. The Second Accused gave evidence that although he joined with the First
> Accused and the Third Accused to commit robbery of the taxi, his role was
> only to drive the getaway vehicle.
>
> 19\. The Second Accused told the deceased to leave the taxi with the words
> "_Uncle, go down_ ", very polite words, devoid of aggression. It is
> submitted that the words used convey and confirm the Second Accused’s
> thoughts that the deceased was to be safely tied up only, and not hurt or
> harmed.
>
> 25\. The Second Accused was surprised because so far as he knew the deceased
> was not supposed to die. Had he realised that eventuality he would not even
> have flagged down the taxi along Bukit Batok West Avenue 6.
>
> 32\. The common intention was the pre-arranged plan of the First Accused,
> the Second Accused and the Third Accused to rob the deceased of his taxi.
>
> 33\. Here, the criminal act was the murder by stabbing with a bayonet, of
> the deceased by the Third Accused. For section 34 to apply, it is incumbent
> for the Prosecution to prove that the Third Accused’s intention which was to
> be imputed to the Second Accused (and the First Accused) must not be
> inconsistent with the carrying out of the common intention.
>
> 34\. But for common intention to apply, it is necessary to prove that the
> accused had knowledge of all the essential elements to constitute common
> intention. Here, the Second Accused testified that he did not know that the
> Third Accused carried or was armed with a bayonet. He only became aware of
> the existence of the bayonet after the Third Accused had used it to commit
> the murder of the deceased: __**PP v Lee Chin Guan[1992] 1 SLR 320 at page
> 327 B-D.**__
>
> 35\. The testimony of the Second Accused of his absence of the knowledge of
> the bayonet is supported by his Police statements. There is no mention of
> the bayonet in P244 (his oral statement to Senior Staff Sergeant
> Kamaruzaman). In his long-statement P250, the Second Accused gave a detailed
> account of events. At paragraph 3 thereof (page 369 of the PI notes) he
> frankly admitted knowledge of 2 guns : he frankly admitted he knew the
> slingbag given to him at the "S-11" restaurant contained a revolver, and
> that the First Accused wore a waist pouch with the pistol. Of the Third
> Accused’s slingbag the Second Accused said :
>

>> "I did not know what were the contents in Rosli’s bag but I knew it
contained some weapons."

>
> 45\. The Second Accused did not see what the Third Accused did to the

>
> 50\. Participation in the criminal act is necessary for an accused to be

> 51\. It is humbly submitted that the Prosecution has failed to prove the
> common intention in respect of the Second Accused and therefore he must be

The third accused

**_

87 The mainstay of counsel’s submission on behalf of the third accused was
that the third accused would not have stabbed the deceased taxi driver if not
for the sudden intimidating instructions from the first accused to finish off
the taxi driver whilst a pistol was being pointed at the third accused. His
plan, his counsel submitted, was merely to take the taxi driver into the
secondary jungle and tie him up. But since no rope was made available to him,
his intention was to handcuff him to a tree. Counsel invited the court to
accept the evidence of the third accused in court as the truth. Counsel
however made it explicit that the General Exception defence contemplated under
s 94 of the Penal Code in relation to acts which a person was compelled to do
by threats did not apply and was not available to the third accused. Counsel’s
arguments insofar as material are reproduced below:

>
> 21\. Rosli held the unsheathed bayonet in his left hand. Wan then handed

> Rosli then took the taxi driver to the bushes. Wan did not offer any rope or

>
> 22\. On his own accord, Rosli thought of handcuffing the taxi driver to a

>
> 26\. As Rosli turned around and called for Wan’s assistance, Wan pointed the

>
> 27\. In this state of fear, Rosli covered the taxi driver’s mouth with his

Prosecution

**_

88 The final speech by the learned DPP was comprehensive and detailed. In the
main, the learned DPP after making extensive references to the testimonies of
all three accused urged the court not to give any credence to their repeated
claims that their scheme on that day was merely to tie up the taxi driver and
speed off with the stolen taxi to their main criminal enterprise at Jurong
East. The learned DPP urged the court to hold that these men would not have -
given the fact they were equipped with ski-masks to cover their faces during
the proposed armed robbery - allowed the taxi driver who had seen their faces
in daylight to be around to identify them later. The learned DPP submitted
that in the circumstances of this case, the irresistible inference was that
the killing of the taxi driver by the third accused was indeed part of the
common intention. Insofar as is relevant the following segments of the
prosecution submission require reproduction:

> 100\. The three of them set out on 8 Aug 00 on a highly dangerous mission:
> to rob a goldsmith’s shop which was likely to be guarded by CISCO officers.
> They were armed to the teeth and violence was expected. They were out to
> commit 2 robberies: the robbery of the taxi-driver of his taxi and then the
> robbery of the goldsmith’s shop. The 1st accused, had, at great risk to
> himself, smuggled a Colt automatic pistol, a Smith & Wesson revolver, and a
> bayonet, through the Woodlands checkpoint as he needed them for the grand
> robbery he had in mind. He provided the weapons to the 2nd and 3rd accused
> for their use and they readily agreed to it.
>
> 102\. From the evidence adduced, it is clear that all 3 persons had a great
> fear of being identified. This will be dealt with in greater detail later.
> At this stage, the prosecution would emphasise the following:
>

>> 102.1. The taxi-driver had seen the faces of all 3 accused persons.

>>

>> 102.2. The taxi-driver had seen the 1st accused brandishing a pistol
(according to the 3rd accused, when the 3rd accused asked the 1st accused why
the taxi-driver had to die, the 1st accused replied that it was because the
taxi-driver had seen his firearm)

>>

>> 102.3 While the 3rd accused was in the bushes at Chestnut Avenue, 2
vehicles had passed by (with no evidence as to whether the motorists saw their
faces).

>>

>> 102.4 Their subsequent conduct after the killing:

>>

>>> i The 3rd accused removed the handcuffs from the deceased after stabbing
the taxi-driver as he was afraid that fingerprints may have been left on the
handcuffs.

>>>

>>> ii The 1st and 3rd accused changing T-shirts after the killing.

>>>

>>> iii The 2nd accused and the 3rd accused going for haircuts after the
killing.

>>>

>>> iv The constant cleaning of the taxi to remove fingerprints

>>>

>>> v The plan to use ski-caps when committing the robbery of CISCO officers
or of the goldsmith’s shop.

>
> 103\. Given the fact that the three accused persons were so afraid of being
> recognised by the motorists that drove by Chestnut Avenue even though there
> is no certainty that the motorists had seen their faces, they must have been
> positively terrified of the fact that the taxi-driver had seen their faces
> and could identify them. If they were afraid of being identified by a
> passing motorist, they would have been more afraid of being picked out at an
> identification parade by the taxi-driver. The 3rd accused had only one
> obvious choice when he led the taxi-driver to the bushes: to finish him off.
>
> **The 1 st accused Wan Kamil**
>
> 104\. The 1st accused is clearly culpable under section 34 of the Penal Code
> for the following reasons:
>

>> 104.1. He had supplied the weapons. In particular, he gave the 2nd accused
a Smith & Wesson revolver and the 3rd accused a bayonet. He must have
anticipated that they would be used, otherwise, why did he procure them from
Thailand and why did he provide them to the other 2 accused persons: see Neoh
Bean Chye’s case, where the 1st accused provided the 2nd accused with the
revolver used in the shooting.

>>

>> 104.2. He was the one who chose Chestnut Avenue as the scene for the
robbery.

>>

>> 104.3. He told the 3rd accused to ‘ _habis khan_ ’ or ‘finish off’ the
deceased before even boarding the taxi.

>>

>> 104.4. He stood guard along the road, holding his pistol to provide cover
for the 3rd accused before returning to the taxi.

>>

>> 104.5. He gave orders to the 2nd accused to clean the taxi so that they
would not leave fingerprints in it.

>
> 105\. The prosecution submits that the account given by the 1st accused vis
> --vis how they were going to execute the 2nd option (of robbing a taxi-
> driver of his taxi) is inherently incredible. The 2nd option would entail:
>

>> 105.1 robbing the taxi-driver of his taxi;

>>

>> 105.2. tying the taxi-driver to a suitable tree;

>>

>> 105.3. leaving the scene;

>>

>> 105.4. staging the robbery at the Boon Lay Gem Store successfully; and

>>

>> 105.5. alerting the police to rescue the taxi-driver.

>
> 106\. This sounds comical and ludicrous and cannot be taken seriously by
> this Court.
>
> **2nd accused**
>
> 127\. His defence is two-fold:
>

>> 127.1. That he had no part in the killing and that he did not know that the
3rd accused had intended to kill the driver-driver.

>>

>> 127.2. That his role in the robbery of the taxi-driver was that of a driver
and he had remained in the driver’s seat when the taxi was parked along
Chestnut Avenue, waiting for the 3rd accused to return to the taxi.

>
> 128\. The 2nd accused has attempted to distance himself from the killing of
> the taxi-driver by selectively highlighting certain factors that are
> apparently favourable to him such as the fact that he remained in the taxi
> when the killing occurred. However, it is clear from the caselaw that the
> totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration when
> assessing whether the 2nd accused has the requisite intention. When the
> evidence is assessed _in toto_ , it becomes clear that the 2nd accused, as
> the driver, remained in the taxi in order to make a quick getaway after the
> 3rd accused had dealt with the taxi-driver.
>
> _**Further Evidence from the 2 nd accused’s own statements:**_
>
> 137\. The second accused, in his handwritten statement recorded on 15 Oct 00
> (exhibit P244) at the 2nd paragraph states:
>

>> "I **saw** the 3rd accused and Wan **pulling** the taxi-driver to the
bushes after handcuffing him." (emphasis added)

>
> 138\. The 2nd accused, in his statement recorded on 1 Nov 00 (exhibit P250

>> "Whilst seated in the driver’s seat, I **turned around and saw** the 3rd
accused was **forcing** the taxi-driver to the bushes of tall lalang on my
left side of the road …" (emphasis added)

>
> 139\. The 2nd accused, in his evidence in court denied ever seeing this but

>> Q: Why did you say that you did?

>>

>> A: I do not know why I said.

>
> 140\. There was no reason for the recorder to be putting words in the 2nd

>
> 179\. One of the most incredible aspects of the 2nd accused’s evidence was

> 180\. Even after the 3rd accused had got out of the car and held onto the

driver of his taxi;

>>

>> 205.2. the 2nd accused has satisfied the requirement of ‘presence’ and
‘participation’ by:

>>> i. flagging down the taxi and boarding it together with the other 2
accused;

>>>

>>> ii shortly later, at Chestnut Avenue, instructing the taxi-drive to get
out of the taxi; and

>>>

>>> iii by waiting in the taxi as a getaway car driver while the taxi-driver
was led to the buses by the 3rd accused;

>>

>> 205.3. the killing of the taxi-driver was in furtherance of the common
intention to commit robbery.

>
> 206\. Furthermore, there was never, at any stage, any objection by the 2nd

Conclusion

**_

89 The primary facts that (a) the three accused tricked the taxi driver to
take them to a desolate spot along Chestnut Avenue; (b) there in that place,
one amongst them namely the third accused stabbed him several times; and (c)
the hapless victim died as a result of the wounds suffered by him were not in
dispute. What was put in issue was in relation to their common intention. The
charge of murder on which they were being tried necessarily hinged on a
finding by the court whether such a common intention could be attributed to
all three of them. In this, reference must first be made to s 34 of the Penal
Code which was an integral ingredient of the charge. The section reads:

> When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common
> intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same
> manner as if the act were done by him alone.

90 This section, as stated by the learned authors of Ratanlal (see Ratanlal
and Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes, 23rd Edn, Vol 1, page 85) lays down a principle
of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The essence of that
liability is to be found in the existence of common intention animating the
accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such
intention (_**Mahbub Shah v Emperor**_ (1945) 47 Bom LR 941). It deals with
the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse, by several persons; if all are
done in furtherance of common intention, each person is liable for the result
of them all as if he had done them himself; ‘that act’ and ‘the act’ in the
latter part of the section must include the whole action covered by a
‘criminal act’ in the first part, because they refer to it (_**Barendra Kumar
Ghosh**_ _**v Emperor**_ AIR 1925 PC 1).

91 The most celebrated exposition on this subject which is frequently quoted
and oft-repeated is contained in the advice of Sir Madhavan Nair in _**Mahbub
Shah**_ (_supra_) at page 943. It reads:

> Attention has already been drawn to the words of the section. As it
> originally stood, the section was in the following terms :-
>

>> "When a criminal act is done by several persons, each of such persons is
liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone."

>
> In 1870, it was amended by the insertion of the words "in furtherance of the
> common intention of all" after the word "persons" and before the word "each"
> so as to make the object of the section clear. Section 34 lays down a
> principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section
> does not say "the common intentions of all" nor does it say "an intention
> common to all." Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be
> found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading
> to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke
> the aid of s. 34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act
> complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance
> of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the
> crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the
> act were done by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their
> Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the section implies a
> pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the
> section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert
> pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As has been often observed, it is
> difficult if not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the
> intention of an individual; in most cases it has to be inferred from his act
> or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case.

92 The subject came up for discussion in another Indian case of _**Bashir v
State of Allahabad**_ (1953) AIR All 668 at 671 where the court (per Desai J)
observed:

> (13) What is meant by "common intention" is the "community of purpose" or
> "common design" or "common intent". Section 34 lays down a principle of
> Common Law and it has been pointed out by Lord Sumner in the case of
> _**Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor**_ AIR 1925 PC 1 (C) (ubi supra), at page
> 8 that the Indian Penal Code must not be assumed to have sought to introduce
> differences from the prior law and it must not be suppposed that, because it
> ceases to use the terms "principal in the first degree" and "principal in
> the second degree" it does not intend to provide for the ideas which those
> terms, however imperfectly expressed. Therefore it will not be wrong to
> interpret the words "common intention" to mean "community of purpose",
> "common design" or "common enterprise" which are the words used in the
> English Common Law. In – ‘Mahboob Shah (sic) v. Emperor’, AIR 1945 PC 118
> (D), "common intention" was held to imply a "pre-arranged plan". This does
> not mean either that there should be confabulation, discussion and agreement
> in writing or by word, nor that the plan should be arranged for a
> considerable time before the doing of the criminal act. The Judicial
> Committee in the ‘case of Mahboob Shah (sic) (D)’, did not lay down that a
> certain interval should elapse between the formation of a pre-arranged plan
> and the doing of the criminal act and did not negative the formation of a
> pre-arranged plan just a moment before the doing of the criminal act. …

93 Another principle to be borne in mind is that before any accused can be
convicted of an offence read with s 34, the court must arrive at a finding as
to which of the accused took what part, if any, in furtherance of the common
intention. A conviction without such a finding would be illegal (see _**Fazoo
Khan v Jatoo Khan**_ AIR (1931) Cal 643)

94 The law as to common intention came up for discussion before the Singapore
Court of Criminal Appeal on several occasions. In _**Mimi Wong & Anor v Public
Prosecutor**_ [1972] 2 MLJ 75 as well as in _**Public Prosecutor v Neoh Bean
Chye & Anor**_ [1975] 1 MLJ 3, the Court of Criminal Appeal affirmed the
principles articulated in _**Mahbub Shah**_ as well as _**Barendra Kumar
Ghosh**_.

95 In _**Mimi Wong**_ , Wee Chong Jin CJ delivering the opinion of the
appellate court, rejected a contention by the second accused (who did not
inflict the fatal blow but played a role in throwing toilet cleansing liquid
into the eyes of the victim just as the first accused was about to stab the
victim) that s 34 could only be applied if the common intention of the persons
accused of an offence was to commit the offence with which they were charged,

96 In _**Neoh Bean Chye**_ , the facts as could be gathered from the headnotes
of the case were as follows.

97 The first accused Neoh, and the second accused Lim, were jointly tried for
murder in furtherance of a common intetnion. Lim carried a loaded revolver and
both accused entered a ‘wine shop’ in order to rob the proprietor. When the
proprietor was about to close the shop, they attempted to rob him, but when he
resisted, Lim shot him and both accused ran out. When Neoh was arrested and
charged with the murder of the proprietor, he made a cautioned statement to
the police and another statement to a magistrate. When Lim was arrested and
charged some months later, he also made a cautioned statement to the police.
The accused were separately represented by counsel at the trial. The second
accused Lim contended (a) that a separate trial was desirable as Neoh had
blamed him for the proprietor’s death in his earlier statements and he would
therefore be prejudiced and embarassed in his defence; (b) that his own
statement to a police inspector was inadmissible because Neoh’s cautioned
statement had not been furnished to him before his own statement was taken
from him, but only some time afterwards and accordingly there had been a
breach of rule 9 of Schedule E of the Criminal Procedure Code; and (c) that
his gun had gone off accidentally during a struggle with the deceased
proprietor. The first accused Neoh contended (a) that there was no case to
answer at the end of the prosecution case as there was no evidence of a common
intention to cause the death of the proprietor; and (b) that the proprietor’s
death was in any event accidental.

98 Counsel for Neoh referred to the court the headnotes of _**R v Vincent
Banka & Anor**_ [1936] V MLJ 66, a decision by the Straits Settlements Court
of Criminal Appeal, and argued that Neoh could not be found guilty of murder
unless the prosecution proved that there was common intention on the part of
both accused to commit murder. In _**Vincent Banka**_ , the headnotes said
that ‘[before] a jury can find an accused person guilty of murder by reason of
the provisions of s 34 of the Penal Code, they must be satisfied on the
evidence that _there existed between the participants a common intention to
not only rob but also to kill the deceased_. [Emphasis added]

99 Choor Singh J who tried the case together with D’Cotta J in the first
instance, gave short shrift to the foregoing argument. In rejecting it, he
observed:

> In our judgment the head note of the report of the decision in _Rex_ v.
> _Vincent Banka and another_ does not contain a correct statement of the law.
> In a criminal prosecution where section 34 of the Penal Code is invoked, it
> is not incumbent on the prosecution to prove that there existed between the
> participants a common intention to commit the crime actually committed. For
> section 34 to apply it is sufficient if the prosecution prove that there was
> in existence a common intention between all the persons who committed the
> criminal act and that the act which constituted the offence charged was done
> in furtherance of that common intention. This is clear from the decisions of
> the Privy Council in _Barendra Kumar Ghosh_ v. _Emperor_ , and _Mahboob
> Shah_(sic) v. _Emperor_ , and also from the recent decision of the Court of
> Criminal Appeal of Singapore in _Mimi Wong and another_ v. _Public
> Prosecutor_.

100 The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the decision of the High Court and Wee
Chong Jin CJ delivering the judgment of the appeal court said that the trial
judges were plainly justified in finding the appellant guilty of murder under
s 302 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.

101 Both in _**Mimi Wong**_ and _**Neoh Bean Chye**_ , the Singapore Courts
have unambiguously approved the principles enunciated in _**Barendra Kumar
Ghosh**_. An important segment in the judgment of the Singapore Court of
Criminal Appeal in _**Mimi Wong**_ making reference to _**Barendra Kumar
Ghosh**_ highlights the principle that ‘ _s 34 deals with the doing of
separate acts, similar or diverse, by several persons; if all are done in
furtherance of a common intention, each person is liable for the result of
them all, as if had done them himself, for ‘that act’ and the ‘act’ in the
latter part of the section must include the whole action covered by a
‘criminal act’ in the first part, because they refer to it_ ’ (see _**Mimi
Wong**_ (_supra_) at page 79C-D, left column and _**Barendra Kumar Ghosh**_
AIR 1925 PC 1).

102 The learning on the common intention provisions of the Penal Code is
legion. I need however refer to a few other decisions of the Singapore Court
of Appeal.

103 In _**Lim Heng Soon & Anor v Public Prosecutor**_ [1970] 1 MLJ 166 at
170E-I, (right column) the Federal Court, Criminal Appeal from Singapore (per
Wee Chong Jin CJ) approved a direction given by the trial judge to the jury in
relation to common intention in the following terms:

> … _every person who participates_ in the commission of the criminal act
> _would be liable_ as if he [had] committed the act all by himself,
> _irrespective of the fact he had only played a small role_ in the commission
> of the act. [Emphasis added]

104 In _**Too Yin Sheong v Public Prosecutor**_ [1999] 1 SLR 682, the Court of
Appeal at page 693-I re-affirmed what was stated by Wee Chong Jin CJ in _**Lim
Heng Soon**_ (_supra_). In _**Shaiful Edham bin Adam & Anor v Public
Prosecutor **_(Criminal Appeal No 13 of 1998 at para 61) the Court of Appeal
emphasised the aspect that passive participation by one accused would suffice
to satisfy the requirements of s 34 of the Penal Code. In _**Too Yin Sheong**_
the Court of Appeal also re-affirmed (see p 694, para 37) what was stated by
Mookerjee J in _**King- Emperor v Barendra Kumar Ghos[e]**_ (sic)_****_(AIR
1924 Cal 257 at 280), as follows:

> It is the expectation of aid, in case it is necessary to the
>
> completion of the crime and the belief that his associate is near and ready
> to render it, which encourage and embolden the chief perpetrator, and incite
> him to accomplish the act. By the countenance and assistance which the
> accomplice thus renders, he participates in the commission of the offence.
>
> It is therefore sufficient to hold a party as principal, if it is made to
> appear that he acted with another in pursuance of a common design; that he
> operated at one and the same time for fulfilment of the same pre-concerted
> end, and was so situated as to be able to furnish aid to his associates with
> a view to insure success in the accomplishment of the common enterprise.

105 In _**Public Prosecutor v Gerardine Andrew**_ [1998] 3 SLR 736, the Court
of Appeal re-affirmed what was stated by the Privy Council in **_Barendra
Kumar Ghosh_ **that before a person could be made liable under s 34, there had
to be physical presence at the actual commission of the offence. However,
physical presence did not require the offender to be at the exact spot where
the crime was committed. It would be useful at this stage to refer to what
Yong Pung How CJ observed at page 752 of the decision. He said:

> 36 The question whether an accused person must be physically present at the
> actual commission of the offence is therefore answered in the affirmative.
> The next question which arises for this appeal is whether Gerardine was
> physically present for the purposes of s 34 when the stabbing took place.
> The requirement here is physical presence at the actual commission of the
> offence, not physical presence at the immediate site when the commision of
> the offence occurred. In _Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor_ AIR 1925 PC 1, a
> post-master was shot and killed inside a post office. The accused said that
> he was outside the post-office at the time of the shooting. _Lord Sumner in
> delivering the judgment of the court observed at p 6, ‘Even if the appellant
> did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in
> crimes as in other things "they also serve who only stand and wait_ ’ ". It
> was also noted by Bose J in _Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v State of
> Bombay_ AIR 1955 SC 287 that an accused need not be present in the actual
> room. He can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his
> companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road
> ready to facilitate their escape. What is crucial is that he must be
> physically present at the scene of the occurrence and must actually
> participate in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the
> time the crime is actually committed. …
>
> [Emphasis added]

106 So much for an overview of the law and reasoning relating to s 34 of the
Penal Code. Returning to the contentions before the court, it is proposed to
deal with the role and actions of the **third accused** first for he was the
one who led the taxi driver into the bushes and stabbed him several times and
caused his death.

_**

  
Third accused

**_

107 The third accused had admitted both in his statements and in court that he
was the man who plunged the bayonet a number of times into the chest of his
handcuffed quarry. It was clear from his statements (in particular para 9 of
exh P-256, page 382 of the PI notes) that despite the pleas and entreaties of
the taxi driver not to cause him harm and his further doleful declaration that
he had a family, the third accused still mercilessly stabbed the victim.

108 Forensic evidence on which there was no dispute had further conclusively
established that each stab wound inflicted on the taxi driver was by itself
sufficient to cause his death.

109 Section 300 of the Penal Code insofar as relevant reads:

> 300\. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder –
>

>> (a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of
causing death;

>>

>> (b) if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the
offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm
is caused;

>>

>> (c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any
person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the
ordinary course of nature to cause death; or

>>

>> (d) if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently
dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury
as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for
incurring the risk of causing death, or such injury as aforesaid.

110 In my view, the first accused’s acts in stabbing a completely helpless and
beseeching victim fell in all fours with either limb (a), (b) or (c) of s
300\. The actions of the accused clearly in my mind satisfied both the _mens
rea_ and _actus reus_ elements in the said section. The accused’s perfunctory
explanation in his s 122(6) statement that he had no intention to kill the
taxi driver or cause his death was found by me to be void of any substance.

111 In the course of his testimony, the third accused obliquely attempted to
raise the defence of duress. He claimed that whilst he was looking to the
first accused for assistance to help lift the taxi driver who tripped and fell
in the bushes, the first accused raised his pistol, pointed it at the third
accused and in a manner commanded him to ‘finish off’ the taxi driver. He
implied that if not for such a life-threatening sign from the first accused,
he would not have stabbed the taxi driver for at all times his intention was
merely to tie up the taxi driver and at that time to handcuff him to a tree in
the thicket.

112 In my determination, if his claim that he stabbed the victim because of a
vile threat by the first accused, this would have most certainly featured in
his statements. Further, if what he did was indeed upon threat of violence to
his life, he would not have, in my view, gone about searching for the victim’s
wallet and recovering it from the victim’s trouser pocket, after he had
stabbed him. Still further, his reaction when he re-entered the taxi would be
one of disgust, frustration and revulsion and not one of quietitude and
silence. In my finding, his story that he committed the act under threat and
duress did not appear to have any semblance of truth.

113 In any event, the defence of duress which the third accused was trying to
set up was no defence to the charge of murder. Section 94 of the Penal Code
provides:

> 94\. Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death,
> nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by
> threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension
> that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence:
>
> Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a
> reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place
> himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint.
>
> _
>
> Explanation
>
> _ 1\. – A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat being
> beaten, joins gang-robbers knowing their character, is not entitled to the
> benefit of this exception on the ground of his having been compelled by his
> associates to do anything that is an offence by law.
>
> Explanation 2. – A person seized by gang-robbers, and forced by threat of
> instant death to do a thing which is an offence by law – for example, a
> smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of a house for the
> gang-robbers to enter and plunder it – is entitled to the benefit of this
> exception.

114 In _**Killikyatara Bomma & Others v Emperor**_ (1913) 14 Cr L J 207
(Madras), the Madras High Court held that a person who by threat of death was
induced to do an act in order to facilitate the commission of a murder, could
not claim the benefit of s 94 of the Penal Code.

115 It would not be necessary for me to delve further into the law of duress
for in my view I found the claim of the first accused that he stabbed the
victim four to five times in his chest because of an impending danger to his
life or person to be nothing but a hoax, conceived belatedly to escape the
consequences of his mindless and cruel deeds. He was found by me to be
spinning tales and distorting facts as to what made him commit the heinous
acts admitted to have been committed by him.

116 He claimed that he was an unwilling entrant to the robbery scheme. He said
that when the first accused tried to get him involved with his robbery plans,
he initially remained silent but he caved in only after a chillingly veiled
intimidation as to what could befall the third accused if he did not join in
the robbery plan and the mention of a possible booty of about 5 million
dollars dangled by the first accused.

117 The third accused’s account that he never entertained any thought to cause
any bodily injury to the taxi driver was in my view an improbable story. If
he, as he said, was a reluctant recruit to the robbery scheme and that the
plan as respects the taxi driver was merely to tie him up in the bushes, would
he not have halted in his tracks and either rebuked or counseled the first
accused, when the latter reportedly surprised him with an inexplicable and
cruel instruction to finish off the taxi driver, a few moments before he and
the first accused were about to board the taxi hailed by the second accused
that day. In my view, he was trying to distance himself from the horrible and
mindless crime committed by him.

118 In my determination, the suggestion by the third accused that he had
little choice but to finish off the fallen driver because there was an
imminent threat of harm to his life from the first accused, was a belated
fabrication concocted to evade the consequences of his mindless and cruel deed
committed by him on 8 August 2000.

_**

  
First accused

**_

119 Let me next deal with the defence of the first accused. The first
accused’s defence was one of denial. He claimed that the killing of the taxi
driver was never in the scheme of things. He said that their plan when they
opted to seize a taxi from its driver was merely to restrain him in a secluded
spot; use the taxi and once the robbery was over, inform the police of the
whereabouts of the taxi driver. He further averred that initially he was
unwilling to go to Chestnut Avenue but gave directions to proceed there only
when he encountered some cold and disapproving looks from his companions.

120 He denied ever having mentioned to the third accused to finish off the
taxi driver either before they boarded the taxi or whilst at Chestnut Avenue.
He claimed that he was totally unaware of what in fact the third accused did
to the taxi driver inside the bushes. He claimed that he was seated inside the
taxi and only when he saw an oncoming car, he wound down the window of the
taxi and shouted to the third accused to hurry up. He heard some crying voices
from inside the bushes and a little later learnt from the third accused that
the taxi driver had been stabbed.

121 Notwithstanding the aspect that the account narrated by the first accused
that the third accused threatened him with the pistol when instructing him to
finish off the taxi driver lacked substantiation, I still found the story of
the first accused that he was in fact inside the taxi when the third accused
hurt the taxi driver in the bushes, to be unworthy of belief. The first
accused’s evidence in this regard, in examination-in-chief, was at variance
with what he had said in cross-examination. In examination-in-chief his
evidence was that after the third accused and the taxi driver had gone into
the bushes after jumping over a drain, he went and sat inside the taxi. He
then saw an oncoming car. Then he heard a sound ‘crying in pain’. He then
shouted to the third accused to hurry up. But during cross-examination, his
story was different. He said when cross-examined that whilst he was standing
next to the taxi, he saw an oncoming car. He then went and sat inside the
taxi. He wound the window down (he demonstrated to court how he wound down the
windows by using his hands and showing a rotating movement) and shouted to the
third accused to hurry up. He then heard the cry of pain from the bushes after
he had shouted.

122 Although the details as to sequence can blur from one’s memory after a few
months, the lack of consistency was not the only feature to belie his claims.
The taxi in question, the court was shown with reference to the photographs
produced, did not have a manual handle to lower the windows. The taxi in fact
was proven to have power windows.

123 In my evaluation, the first accused was endeavouring in vain to distance
himself from the murder committed by the third accused. He did not want to
admit that he was either standing guard, rendering assistance or watching the
third accused mercilessly stabbing the victim for obvious reasons. His claim
that he was inside the taxi when the cruel felling of the taxi driver was
being carried out by the third accused was also dashed by the evidence of the
second accused who said that the first accused was some distance behind the
taxi for sometime and that both the first accused and the third accused re-
entered the taxi at about the same time – albeit the first accused stepped
into the taxi first - before they left Chestnut Avenue for Woodlands. In my
finding, the first accused was deliberately being untruthful as regards his
location when the third accused stabbed the taxi driver.

124 The other aspect I must mention is in regard to his claim that he was
reluctant initially to take the taxi driver to Chestnut Avenue. He claimed
that he was in a way bulldozed into it by the cold and disapproving looks of
the other two. This story again was found by me to be an improbable one. First
of all, this claim went against his own claim that the plan was to take the
taxi driver to a secluded spot to tie him up. If so, what difference would it
have made to the other two whether the taxi-driver was taken to Woodlands or
Chestnut Avenue to be tied up. Why would the others give a displeased look
when the first accused mentioned Woodlands and withdraw their disapproval when
he changed the direction to Chestnut Avenue, when it was common ground the
other two were not at all familiar with the Chestnut Avenue area?

125 In fact, if the first accused’s claim was true, why did it not feature in
his lengthy voluntary statements. Its absence in those statements led me to
conclude that the claim by the first accused was also an untruth.

126 As can be gathered from his own testimony, the first accused was the
architect of the entire evil enterprise planned for the 8 August 2000. He was
the master-mind and purveyor of the deadly weapons. In order to commit
robberies, that too in public places and in broad daylight, he had taken pains
to secure firearms from Thailand. He was the one who had pre-packed the bags
of weapons and caused them to be handed over to the other two hoods. He was
prepared and geared to confront even the armed CISCO details and for which
purpose he enlisted the help of the second accused to be the getaway driver.
Yet he tried to portray himself to the court as a person of care, concern and
extreme public-spiritedness and wanted the court to believe that he would have
called the police to inform them of the whereabouts of the restrained taxi
driver once they had completed the robbery planned for that day. In my
finding, his explanations were nothing but untruths and as submitted by the
prosecution, made out to escape liability for his cowardly acts.

127 More would be said in relation to the defence of the first accused after
the defence raised by the second accused had been dealt with.

_**

  
Second accused

**_

128 The defence of the second accused was that he had no part in the killing
of the taxi driver; he did not know that the third accused intended to kill
the victim; he did not know that the third accused was armed with a bayonet or
knife; and his role in the robbery of the taxi driver was to act as a driver
of the vehicle and nothing more.

129 He claimed that he was paying very little attention to what the first and
the third accused did after both of them left the taxi with the driver. His
story was that whilst he was in the driver’s seat he could only recall seeing,
that too for a fleeting few moments, the third accused taking the taxi driver
into the bushes whilst the first accused was standing some distance away
(about 14 to 15 ft) from the rear of the taxi with pistol in his hand and
apart from that nothing significant happened until the first and third accused
re-entered the taxi (see page 907 of the NE). He was remarkably evasive about
what he heard when the third accused and the taxi driver were inside the bush
(see page 988 to 989 of the NE).

130 There was, in my evaluation, a clear attempt on his part to dissociate
himself from the harm done to the taxi driver. He wanted the court to believe
that he was somewhat a greenhorn who would never entertain even a thought of
shooting anyone with his firearm even during the robbery planned to be carried
out in Jurong East. He seemed to suggest that his firearm was just a showpiece
and in the event of any fracas, he would simply take to his heels (page 928 of
the NE). I found him to be entirely unpersuasive.

131 He was also found by me to be prevaricating on numerous occasions in the
course of his testimony. His statements to the police admitted in evidence as
being made voluntarily plainly contradicted his evidence in court, as could be
seen from the following.

132 The second accused in his handwritten statement recorded on 15 October
2000 (exh P-244) at para 2:

> I _saw_ the third accused and Wan _pulling_ the taxi-driver to the bushes
> after handcuffing him. [Emphasis added]

133 Later, the second accused in his statement recorded on 1 November 2000
(exh P-250 at page 370) at para 7 stated:

> Whilst seated in the driver’s seat, I _turned around and saw_ the third
> accused was _forcing_ the taxi-driver to the bushes of tall lalang on my
> left side of the road … [Emphasis added]

134 However, the second accused in his evidence in court denied ever seeing
such incidents and could not come up with any reasonable explanation as to why
he mentioned such matters in his statements.

135 The following segment as appears at pages 812 to 814 of his testimony
would illustrate an attempt on his part at prevarication:

> His Honour: The only point I want you to clarify in this statement is this.
> You look at this statement, somewhere in the middle, (reads), "I asked the
> taxi driver to get out and the taxi. When he alighted I took over the driver
> seat." Can you see it?
>
> Witness: Yes.
>
> His Honour: After that you said, "I saw Rosli and Wan pulling the taxi
> driver to the bushes."
>
> Witness: Yes.
>
> His Honour: Is that correct?
>
> Witness: Yes.
>
> His Honour: You saw both of them pulling the taxi-driver?
>
> Witness: No, this is after the incident, then I know they actually go into
> the bushes.
>
> His Honour: Just a moment.
>
> Witness: It’s actually after the incident, then I know that they actually go
> into the bushes.
>
> His Honour: I don’t understand you?
>
> Witness: It’s because they told me after the incident happened that what is
> actually happening. Then I know that it’s exactly that they are going into

>
> His Honour: No, here you say, "I saw Rosli and Wan pulling the taxi driver

>
> Witness: Yah.
>
> His Honour: Did you see?
>
> Witness: I only see what they are standing there, but I didn’t actually see
> they go into the bushes, your Honour.
>
> His Honour: No, did you see both of them pulling the taxi driver?
>
> Witness: No, your Honour.
>
> His Honour: Then you say, "Rosli brought the taxi driver inside the bushes
> and Wan just stood outside."
>
> Witness: Yes.
>
> His Honour: Is it right?
>
> Witness: Yes, it’s right, is that---that is what I really what I saw and the
> first sentence is what I really heard what they are doing.
>
> Mr Lee: OK.
>
> Q You said in your statement, "I saw Rosli and Wan pulling the taxi driver
> to the bushes after handcuffing him."
>
> A Yes.
>
> Q Now, can you clarify one more time. In the sentence I just read, you said,
> "I saw Rosli and Wan"?
>
> A Maybe I say the wrong word, but it’s actually after the whole story then I
> make this statement---then I just give a rough statement.
>
> Q You said after the incident you learnt this, that Rosli and Wan pulled the
> taxi driver into the bushes?
>
> A Yes.
>
> Q Where did you learn this from?
>
> A After somebody conversation after the incident.
>
> Q Conversation with who?
>
> A With Rosli.
>
> Q Anyone else?
>
> A No.
>
> Q And what did Rosli tell you.
>
> A He said actually Wan needs to help him when the taxi driver fall.
>
> Q You said Rosli told you, Wan helped Rosli when the taxi driver was
> falling?
>
> A Yes.
>
> Q Did you learn what was Wan helping him about.
>
> A He told me that the driver fall to the drain.
>
> Q And what happened?

136 One other aspect that attracted the attention of the court was his claim
that all of them that day intended to rob the taxi driver only of his taxi and
use it for the purpose of the planned robbery later at Jurong East. However in
his handwritten statement (exh P-244), the second accused had this to say:

> In Aug 2000, I went to _Jurong East coffee shop_ (corrected by the 2nd
> accused at the trial to read as the S11 coffee shop at Bukit Batok) to meet
> Rosli and Wan. During the meeting, we thought of committing robbery since we
> do not (sic) have income. Initially, we _agreed to rob individual but if we
> fail we intend (sic) to rob [a] taxi driver_ … [Emphasis added].

137 From the foregoing admission, it could be clearly deduced that there was
also a plan on that day by all of them even to rob an individual.
Consequently, the claim by the second accused as well as the others that their
intention was only to rob the taxi driver of his taxi, tie him up in a
deserted spot and use his taxi and that the retrieval of the taxi driver’s
wallet was just an afterthought by the third accused and was not part of the
plan, was found by me to be yet another lie. In my finding, the second accused
was there not only to act as a passive driver but also to play out whatever
role required of him in the commission of every offence to be carried out for
that day. In my determination, the second accused’s claim that he was an
unwitting knave who never entertained any thought of harm or hurt anyone, let
alone the taxi driver, was not worthy of any credit.

138 Another incredible facet in the testimony of the second accused was his
total ignorance about the third accused’s bayonet although the third accused
brandished it in the close confines of the taxi as well as outside the taxi.
The undisputed evidence was that the second accused who was seated at the
front passenger seat was trying to order the taxi-driver out of the taxi and
when the taxi driver declined to dismount, the third accused took out his
bayonet and tapped the taxi driver on his left waist or shoulder with it. Yet
the second accused, albeit being only inches away from the taxi driver as well
as from the menacing bayonet, did not see the bayonet himself.

139 Even after the third accused had alighted from the vehicle and held onto
the taxi driver to lead him into the bushes, the second accused claimed that
he was not aware of the third accused’s bayonet. In his police statements, the
second accused said that he saw the third accused ‘pulling’ and ‘forcing’ the
taxi driver but in court he changed his evidence on this aspect. In my finding
he was not stating the truth in court. In any event there was an admission on
his part in one of his statements (exh P-250, para 3) that he knew that the
bag carried by the second accused contained weapons.

140 In my finding, the second accused’s claim that he was just a pawn in the
grand game plan of the other two, was void of substance.

141 Having set out my findings and evaluations on the roles played by the
three accused persons in the offence, let me now return to the issue of common
intention. The law as pronounced in _**Barendra Kumar Ghosh**_ and approved in
_**Neoh Bean Chye**_ (_supra_) is well settled in that ‘s 34 deals with the
doing of separate acts, similar or diverse by several persons; if all are done
in furtherance of a common intention, each person is liable for the result of
them all, …’

142 The Singapore Court of Appeal re-affirmed in _**Too Yin Sheong**_ that for
s 34, every person who participates in the commission of that criminal act
would be liable as if he had committed that act all by himself, irrespective
of the fact that he might have only played a small role in the commission of
the act. The said case also seemed to regard the subsequent conduct of the
accused persons and their lack of remorse after the commission of the offence
as an indicia to infer common intention.

143 It is also now well settled that although common intention implied a pre-
arranged plan and acting in concert, it would however be difficult, if not
impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of the individual
and in most cases it had to be inferred from the act, conduct and the relevant
circumstances of the case (see _**Mahbub Shah**_ , _supra_).

144 Above all, it was also approved in _**Too Yin Sheong**_ that it was not
incumbent upon the prosecution to show that the common intention of the
accused was to commit the crime for which he was charged, for it was the
intention of the doer of the criminal offence charged that was in issue (see
[1999] 1 SLR 692, paras 28 to 30).

145 Returning to the facts of the present case, the third accused was found by
me to be demonstrably wicked. He was the one who cold-bloodedly plunged the
deadly bayonet into the chest area of the luckless taxi driver. Such an action
on his part is a clear proof of his intention to snuff out the life of the
taxi driver. He was squarely caught within all fours of the limbs (a), (b) and
(c) of s 300 of the Penal Code.

146 As regards the first accused, he was found by me to be a consummate
prevaricator. A former Cisco man who guided all of them to the secluded
Chestnut Avenue area and supplied the very bayonet which the third accused
used to cause the death of the taxi driver could not now be heard to say that
he did not think nor know that the third accused would stab the taxi driver
with that bayonet. He was in my view fully responsible, vicariously or
otherwise for the dastardly act of the third accused on that day. Whilst there
was no corroboration as to his alleged utterance to the third accused to
finish off the taxi driver, in my finding he was indeed standing close to the
bushes, witnessing the daylight killing of a defenceless taxi driver.

147 As respects the second accused, his protestations of innocence, in my
finding, were nothing but a conceived ploy. He was neither naive nor a serving
boy as he portrayed himself to be in court. His steeliness could be inferred
from his dismissive remark at the first meeting with the first accused when he
proclaimed: forget the whole thing if the robbery was going to be planned with
only knives. In my finding he was in the thick of the plot to rob the taxi
driver not only of his taxi but also of his monies. The fact he and his
companions shared the cash taken from the taxi driver’s wallet further
reinforced my view that he was equally a hard-hearted brigand whose object on
that day was to partake not only in all aspects of whatever robberies planned
but also for the ensuing violence regardless of the consequences. His claim
that he did not see the bayonet the third accused was holding when he led the
taxi driver into the bushes was nothing but pure falsehood.

148 In my determination, the three thugs who were out to enrich themselves
that day at the expense of others were not out for a light-hearted frolic but
for armed robbery regardless of victims or consequences. The fact they were
prepared to even confront and deal with the armed CISCO personnel, was a clear
indication of their mental make-up and that they were doubtless ready for any
ensuing blood bath in their encounters that day.

149 Inured to violence, consumed by greed and plainly indifferent to
consequences, these three unfeeling thugs united in a common purpose and
design snuffed out the life of a chanceless victim whose misfortune was to be
plying around Bukit Batok and meeting these wicked men on that fateful day.
These three tried their best to pass the poisoned chalice from one to the
other. Their gambit however did not succeed. The defence of each one that
there was no plan to hurt the taxi driver but the intention was only to
restrain him in the bushes was rejected by me as being improbable and untrue.

150 The common intention of the three accused persons to rob the taxi driver
of his taxi was not disputed by the defence. Reviewing all the evidence, in my
determination, the compelling inference was that there was clearly a common
intention by all three of them not only to rob the taxi driver of his taxi but
also his monies and in that process to put the taxi driver away for good so
that he would not be around to tell the police what happened and eventually
identify them.

151 In my finding, the prosecution had proven its case against all the accused
beyond a reasonable doubt and that the accused persons had not established
their defence on balance of probabilities. In the circumstances, I found all
three of them guilty as charged, convicted them and imposed the mandatory
sentence for murder.
