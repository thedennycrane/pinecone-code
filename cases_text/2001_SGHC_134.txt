Case Number | : | Suit 858/2000, 859/2000, RA 24/2001, 23/2001  
---|---|---  
Decision Date | : | 16 June 2001  
Tribunal/Court | : | High Court  
Coram | : |  Lee Seiu Kin JC   
Counsel Name(s) | : |  Engelin Teh SC and Thomas Sim (Engelin Teh & Partners) for the plaintiffs; Philip Fong and Melanie Ho (Harry Elias Partnership) for the defendants in both suits   
Parties | : |  De Souza Tay & Goh (suing as a firm) — Singapore Press Holdings Ltd   
  
Tort – Defamation – Libel – Natural and ordinary meaning – Innuendos meaning –
Applicable principles – Whether words and graphics of article defamatory in
their natural and ordinary meaning – Whether words and graphics of article
defamatory in their innuendos  
  

: The plaintiffs are a partnership carrying on business as a law firm. The
partners in the plaintiffs are David De Souza, Cedric Tay Yat Hock and Goh Kok
Yeow. The defendants in Suit 858/2000 are the owners of The Straits Times
(`TST`), the principal daily English newspaper in Singapore. The defendant in
Suit 859/2000 is a journalist with TST.  
  
In these actions, the plaintiffs claim damages from both defendants for libel
in respect of the publication of an article (`the Article`) which appeared in
the 27 September 2000 edition of TST. The plaintiffs assert that the words,
together with the photographs and graphical representations (collectively
called `the graphic`) of the Article are, in their natural and ordinary
meaning, defamatory of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also assert that the
said material, when read in the light of an earlier article published in the
26 September 2000 edition of TST (`the 26 September article`), is also
defamatory of the plaintiffs in their innuendo meaning.  
  
On 4 December 2000, the plaintiffs filed separate applications in these
actions under O 14 r 12 for the determination of:

(1) the natural and ordinary meaning; and

(2) the innuendo meaning,  
  
of the words and the graphic of the Article.  
  
The plaintiffs have pleaded in their statement of claim that the words and the
graphic, in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or in their innuendo
meaning, meant that:

(1) the plaintiffs are participants and/or are directly or indirectly involved
in the suspected illegal and/or fraudulent activity of Lernout & Hauspie
and/or its co-founders and/or its licensees which activity is being
investigated into by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission; and

(2) the plaintiffs` conduct when contacted by the defendants prior to the
publication of the words, the graphic illustration and the captioned
photograph was evasive, thus lending further weight and credence to the above
allegation.  
  
The senior assistant registrar who heard the applications below disagreed with
this and held that the 27 September article was not defamatory of the
plaintiffs. Consequently, he ordered the plaintiffs` statement of claim in
both actions to be struck out on the ground that there was no reasonable cause
of action against the defendants in both actions and accordingly dismissed
those actions.  
  
Before me, the plaintiffs appealed against the whole of that decision.  
  
**_The 27 September article_**

****

The subject matter of these actions was published in the `Money` section of
the 27 September 2000 edition of TST, at p 88. The Article can be divided into
two parts: (1) the words; and (2) the graphic. Together they cover 32%, or
almost a third, of the entire page. The graphic appears at the top of the
Article. It comprises a flow chart indicating transactions between a number of
companies with accompanying words and a photograph that appears to be the name
plate of the plaintiffs` office. The words of the Article comprise a headline
in large bold print, a sub-headline in medium bold print and the text of the
Article.  
  
The principal subject of the Article is a Belgian company known as Lernout &
Hauspie (`L&H`). The following self-explanatory description is found on its
internet home page:

> _Lernout & Hauspie is the world`s leading provider of speech and language
> technology products, solutions, and services to businesses and individuals
> worldwide. It is our mission to break down language barriers through
> advanced translation technology and to enable people to interact by voice-in
> any language-with the machines that empower them. Through such enhanced
> communication, we believe people will lead richer, more fulfilling lives._

  
  
The graphic itself has a headline and it proclaims `Belgian-Singapore
Connection`. This is followed by a flowchart which indicates a circular flow
of transactions between various entities inside four boxes. Beginning with the
principal subject, the first box states as follows:

> _Lernout & Hauspie (L&H)_

> _Belgian maker of Speech recognition software._

> _Listed on Nasdaq. Asia-Pacific HQ in Singapore_

  
  
An arrow emanates from this box towards the second box which states as
follows:

> _L &H co-founders Messrs Lernout & Hauspie_

> _are among the investors who started FLV Fund._

  
  
A second arrow emanates from this box to the third box which says:

> _FLV Fund_

> _Listed in Brussels_

  
  
A third arrow emanates from this box to the fourth box which states:

> _15 Singapore registered companies_

  
  
Accompanying this third arrow are the following words:

> _Paid millions last year for stakes in some companies. Sold the stakes
> months later to a South Korean company._

  
  
These words would be understood to mean that FLV Fund had, in the previous
year, paid the `millions` for stakes in the 15 Singapore-registered companies
which it subsequently sold to a South Korean company.  
  
From the fourth box, a fourth arrow emanates towards the first box with the
following words next to it:

> _Pays US$57 million, boosting L &H`s Singapore revenue from US$29,000 in
> 1998 to US$80.3 m last year._

  
  
These words would be understood as asserting that the 15 companies had paid
out US$57m in total to L&H, causing its revenue to rise from US$29,000 to
US$80.3m the previous year.  
  
There is a fifth arrow emanating from the first box towards the fourth box and
this is accompanied by the words: `Sells software rights`. This would be
understood to mean that the software rights were sold by L&H to those 15
companies in consideration for the US$57m.  
  
At the bottom of the fourth box relating to the 15 companies are the following
words: `Common address in law firm De Souza Tay & Goh in Shenton Way`.
Underneath those words is the photograph of what appears to be the name plate
of the plaintiffs` office.  
  
Finally, at the bottom left corner of the graphic are the following words in
bold print:

> _FLV FUND`S INVOLVEMENT IN THE SINGAPORE COMPANIES RAISES THE POSSIBILITY
> THAT L &H`S FAST SALES GROWTH MAY NOT BE ALL THAT IT APPEARS - Asian Wall
> Street Journal_

  
  
This would be understood to be a quote from the Asian Wall Street Journal.  
  
Below the graphic is the headline of the Article which states, in large bold
print: `L&H licensees: Two sat on 678 boards`.  
  
And below that is a sub-headline in smaller bold print which states:

> _They were directors for just a couple of weeks in many instances; the
> figures are high but legal, says lawyer_

  
  
Below all that, the text of the Article appears. I reproduce it in full below
(with paragraph numbers added for ease of reference):

> _
>
> 1 Two of the shareholders of Lernout & Hauspie`s (L&H`s) licensees here have

At the last page of that edition of TST there is a reference to the Article
(`the blurb`). It occupies a small central block at the top of the page. It is
placed there to attract the reader`s attention to the Article and direct him
to the relevant page. The blurb comprises (1) a colour photograph of what
appears to be the entrance to the plaintiffs` office showing their name plate;
and (2) a caption which reads as follows:

> _Keeping Busy_

> _Two shareholders of Lernout & Hauspie`s licensees have been directors of
> 670 companies.[emsp ]PAGE 88_

  
  
**NATURAL AND ORDINARY MEANING OF THE ARTICLE**

The plaintiffs pleaded that the words and the graphic of the Article have the
same meaning in their natural and ordinary meaning and innuendo meaning. I
first consider the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article. In **Microsoft
Corp v SM Summit Holdings** [1999] 4 SLR 529 , the Court of Appeal stated that
the general principles pertaining to the determination of the natural and
ordinary meaning of words in a defamation action were well established. The
court summarised these principles as follows (at [para ]53 and 54):

> _
>
> 53 The principles applicable in determining the natural and ordinary meaning
> of the words complained of in a defamation action are well-established. The
> court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary,
> reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: **Jeyaretnam
> Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong** [1984-1985] SLR 516  [1985] 1 MLJ 334  and
> **_Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew_** , supra. The test is an
> objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an
> ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The
> meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant.
> Similarly, the sense in which the words were actually understood by the
> party alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is extrinsic
> evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered
> from the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which
> they are set out. The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning
> of the words, but takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person
> may reasonably infer from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads
> between the lines. This court in the latter case said at pp 318-319:
>
> `In determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of,
> the sense or meaning intended by the appellant is irrelevant. Nor for such
> purpose is the sense or meaning in which the words were understood by the
> respondent relevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the
> words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the
> context of the entire speech made by the appellant on that occasion. It is
> the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by reasonable members of the
> audience at the Bedok car park on that evening using their general knowledge
> and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict
> meaning of the words, but includes any references or implications which
> could reasonably be drawn by such persons ...`
>
> 54 Lord Reid said in the oft-cited case of **Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily
> Telegraph Ltd** [1964] AC 234 at p 258:
>
> `What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally
> been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that
> expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are
> two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words
> themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer.
> But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what
> the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also part of their
> natural and ordinary meaning. Here there would be nothing libellous in
> saying that an inquiry into the appellants` affairs was proceeding: the
> inquiry might be by a statistician or other expert. The sting is in
> inferences drawn from the fact that it is the fraud squad which is making
> the inquiry. What those inferences should be is ultimately a question for
> the jury, but the trial judge has an important duty to perform ...`

From the foregoing the following general principles for determining the
natural and ordinary meaning of words in a defamation action may be distilled:

(1) It is an objective test involving the determination of the meaning that
would be conveyed by the words to an ordinary, reasonable person:

(a) using his general knowledge and common sense;

(b) who is not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal.

(2) The following considerations are irrelevant:

(a) the meaning intended by the maker of the statement; and

(b) the sense in which the words were understood by the plaintiff.

(3) Extrinsic evidence is not admissible in construing the meaning of the
words.

(4) The nature of the audience is to be taken into account.  
  
There are of course specific principles formulated for various circumstances
that have arisen in the authorities and these will be considered in the
analysis below.  
  
In the Article, the direct references to the plaintiffs are as follows:

(i) Three statements, one in the graphic and two at paras 5 and 16 of the text
(read with paras 17 and 18), that the 15 Singapore-registered companies
involved in the matter have a common address in the plaintiffs` premises at
Shenton Way.

(ii) One of the plaintiffs` employees, Ms Tan Lee Chin, is the secretary and
director of the 15 companies. She declined to comment when contacted by TST
(para 17).

(iii) Attempts by TST to reach the partners of the plaintiffs were
unsuccessful (para 18).  
  
As for the blurb, there is no reference to the plaintiffs in the caption, but
the photograph shows the name plate of the firm. However, the combination of
the size and font of the letters and the lack of contrast in the photograph,
the name is not easily made out at a glance.  
  
The literal meaning of the direct references to the plaintiffs in the Article
are clearly not defamatory. Neither is it the plaintiffs` case that they are.
Instead, they rely on the inferences that may be drawn from the words and
graphic of the Article. The plaintiffs agree with the defendants that the main
focus of the Article is the investigation mounted by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (`the SEC`) into the suspected criminal
activities of L&H and their licensees. However, the plaintiffs argue that the
effect of the Article is to suggest an insidious link or connection between
the plaintiffs and such criminal activities and in the process they were
`**_tarred by the same brush_** `.  
  
It is therefore necessary to first consider what this brush has tarred in
respect of the villain of the piece, L&H. The bold headline is the first thing
that catches one`s attention. It states `L&H licensees: Two sat on 678
boards`. From there one would either glance at the graphic immediately above
it, or the sub-headline below it. The message conveyed by the graphic and the
sub-headline is that L&H had channelled their funds, via an incestuous network
of companies, back to themselves disguised as sales of their software. In this
manner, L&H had fraudulently boosted their revenue from such sales in a single
year from a minuscule US$29,000 to US$80.3m. Proceeding to the text, paras 1
to 6 describe how two of the shareholders of three of L&H`s licensees in
Singapore had been directors of some 670 companies in the past few years.
Those three licensees shared the same `address` in Shenton Way as 15 other
companies that had paid L&H US$57m in 1999 for their software. Together with
four other obscure companies, they accounted for the US$80.3m revenue that L&H
reported receiving in that year. Paragraphs 7 and 8 state that the SEC had
launched a probe into this surge in sales and therefore `**_a cloud has been
cast_** ` over the matter. The remaining paragraphs provide further details of
the story, alternatively highlighting the unusual nature of the arrangement
and quoting from lawyers who said that such arrangements were not unusual.  
  
The first question is whether the Article is defamatory of L&H. A statement
that a person is under investigation by an enforcement agency is not capable
of meaning that such person is guilty of the crime being investigated, but it
may bear the defamatory meaning that the person is under suspicion or that
there are reasonable grounds for suspicion: **Lewis v Daily Telegraph** [1964]
AC 234[1963] 2 All ER 151. In the present case, there is a reference to a
probe by the SEC which is described as casting a cloud over the jump in
revenue. Added to this is the emphasis in the Article on the fact that two
individuals had acted as directors of 678 companies, many of which appear to
be shell companies. These two individuals are in turn linked to 15 companies
with the same `address` which had paid L&H US$57m for software licences. I
would conclude that the Article would be interpreted by the ordinary,
reasonable reader to mean that L&H had used these companies to manipulate
financial transactions to create the impression that they had achieved a high
sales turnover in 1999 and were therefore guilty of fraudulent conduct. At the
very least, the Article is defamatory of L&H in that it means that there are
reasonable grounds for suspicion that they are guilty of fraud.  
  
I next have to determine whether there is anything in the Article that would
reasonably suggest that the plaintiffs had anything to do with such fraudulent
practices. The plaintiffs argue that the link is in the mention that the 15
Singapore licensees have a `**_common address_** ` in the plaintiffs` office.
Further, the Article mentioned that one of the plaintiffs` employees, Ms Tan
Lee Chin who was the secretary and director of the 15 companies, had declined
to comment when contacted by TST and that attempts to reach the partners of
the firm were unsuccessful. These give the impression that the plaintiffs were
being evasive and deliberately avoided contact, thereby indicating they had
something to hide. Counsel for the plaintiffs then stated that the reports of
evasiveness were not true and he gave reasons for saying that. However, as
this has absolutely no relevance in respect of the determination of the
natural and ordinary meaning of the Article I need not deal with those
reasons. Additionally, the plaintiffs contend that the photograph in the blurb
at the back page further links the plaintiffs to the allegations against L&H.  
  
The defendants submit firstly that the Article did not contain anything that
was defamatory of the plaintiffs. They submit that even if there were parts of
the Article that could singly or collectively cast the plaintiffs in a bad
light, the bane in those parts were neutralised by the antidote in other
parts. In particular the defendants point out that in paras 12, 13 and 14,
some lawyers were quoted who said that the holding of a large number of
directorships was legal and a common practice. Also in paras 19 and 20 other
lawyers were quoted as saying that it was common for companies to use law
firms or accountancy firms as their registered addresses as a matter of
convenience.  
  
In my opinion the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article is not any of
the two meanings pleaded in the statement of claim. Neither does it contain
any lesser defamatory meaning. In coming to this conclusion, I have borne in
mind the principles summarised by the Court of Appeal in **_Microsoft Corp v
SM Summit Holdings_** (supra). While I have arrived at this determination from
reading the Article as a whole, the following points were relevant:

(1) a reasonable reader would not think that there is anything wrong with a
law firm permitting its address to be used as the registered office of a large
number of companies;

(2) this is especially so in the light of the remarks quoted from lawyers that
such a practice was legal and that it was commonly done;

(3) a reasonable person would not associate the law firm with the operations
of the companies;

(4) the reference to the plaintiffs` employee, Ms Tan Lay Chin, being the
secretary and director of 15 of the companies and declining to comment when
contacted by TST does not necessarily mean that she was being evasive. In the
context of the Article, especially the statement of the lawyer at para 14 of
the Article (that interim directors are often appointed), a reasonable person
would not infer any connection between Ms Tan, who is merely described as an
employee, and the nefarious activities of those companies;

(5) similarly, in respect of para 18 of the Article, the fact that TST had
made unsuccessful attempts to reach the partners of the firm need not
necessarily have a defamatory meaning and in the context of the Article cannot
reasonably be construed to have such a meaning. If the partners had been
reached but declined comment, that could have given a different picture. But
it would not be reasonable for a reader to infer that the partners had been
evasive merely because TST had not been successful in contacting them.  
  
**INNUENDO MEANING OF THE ARTICLE**

The plaintiffs next rely on innuendo (or `true` or `legal` innuendo). The
basis for this is an article published the previous day (`the 26 September
article`), of which the Article is a follow-up. The 26 September article is
found at p 70 of that edition and states as follows (with paragraph numbers
added):

> _US regulator`s probe may lead to Singapore_

> _15 companies sharing a local address pay $100m to Belgian firm, whose surge
> in Asian sales sparks scrutiny_

> _
>
> 1 A BELGIAN software company, Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products (L&H), was
> paid a whopping US$57 million (S$100 million) by 15 companies whose official
> address is a law firm in Shenton Way.
>
> 2 This sum totalled nearly 17 per cent of the global revenues of the speech-
> recognition software company.
>
> 3 It was payment for licensing rights to its software, says L&H.

Apart from paras 14 to 16, there is substantively no additional information in
the 26 September article. If it is also defamatory of L&H, it does not add
much to the damage done by the Article published the following day. Paragraph
14 states that Ms Tan (named in the previous paragraph as the secretary and
director of the 15 companies) was not available for an interview. Paragraph 15
goes on to say that when reached by telephone, she said that she had nothing
to say. Paragraph 16 states that the partners of the law firm were not
available for comment. However, the same information is repeated in the
Article, the only significant difference being that the 26 September article
quoted Ms Tan as saying `**_I have nothing to say_** `.  
  
Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that such a statement in the circumstances
raises the inference that Ms Tan had something to hide in respect of the 15
companies. Counsel further submitted that the statement in para 16 that the
partners of the law firm were not available for comment implies that they were
evasive about the matter. A person who had read the 26 September article would
therefore have this background information and upon reading the Article the
following day, which identifies the plaintiffs as the law firm in question,
would form the view that they were involved, directly or indirectly in the
matter.  
  
I agree that the statement in para 15 quoting Ms Tan as saying that she had
nothing to say, read in conjunction with para 16 that the partners of the firm
were not available for comment, does in the context of the 26 September
article, raise an inference that Ms Tan and the partners had something to
hide. However, as I have described above, the Article contained quotes from
lawyers who had stated that it was common for people to be appointed directors
of a large number of companies and to act as interim directors. The Article
had also said that it was common, and a matter of convenience, for companies
to use law firms or accountancy firms as their registered office. The Article
stated that a lawyer explained that such addresses are for the purpose of
official correspondence and public notices.  
  
In **Charleston v News Group Newspapers** [1995] 2 AC 65[1995] 2 All ER 313,
the House of Lords held that where a publication is not defamatory if
considered as a whole, the plaintiff cannot succeed ([1995] 2 AC 65 at 69;
[1995] 2 All ER 313 at 315-316):

> _... on the ground that some readers will have read part only of the
> published matter and that this part, considered in isolation, is capable of
> bearing a defamatory meaning._

  
  
In arriving at this conclusion, Lord Bridge of Harwich said ([1995] 2 AC 65 at
70-71; [1995] 2 All ER 313 at 316-317) that there was:

> _... a long and unbroken line of authority the effect of which is accurately
> summarised in**Duncan & Neill on Defamation**, 2nd ed. (1983), p. 13, para.
> 4.11 as follows:_

> _`In order to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of
> which the plaintiff complains it is necessary to take into account the
> context in which the words were used and the mode of publication. Thus a
> plaintiff cannot select an isolated passage in an article and complain of
> that alone if other parts of the article throw a different light on that
> passage.`_

> _The locus classicus is a passage from the judgment of Alderson B.
> in**Chalmers v. Payne** (Unreported) , who said:_

> _`But the question here is, whether the matter be slanderous or not, which
> is a question for the jury; who are to take the whole together, and say
> whether the result of the whole is calculated to injure the plaintiff`s
> character. In one part of this publication, something disreputable to the
> plaintiff is stated, but that is removed by the conclusion; the bane and
> antidote must be taken together.`_

> _This passage has been so often quoted that it has become almost
> conventional jargon among libel lawyers to speak of the bane and the
> antidote. It is often a debatable question which the jury must resolve
> whether the antidote is effective to neutralise the bane and in determining
> this question the jury may certainly consider the mode of publication and
> the relative prominence given to different parts of it. I can well envisage
> also that questions might arise in some circumstances as to whether
> different items of published material relating to the same subject matter
> were sufficiently closely connected as to be regarded as a single
> publication. But no such questions arise in the instant case ..._

  
  
Thus it is necessary to examine the Article as a whole and in the context in
which the words were used. If there is anything in a part of it that is, of
itself, defamatory of the plaintiffs, one must consider whether there is
anything elsewhere that would put the Article in such a perspective that a
reasonable reader would not reach the conclusion that it is defamatory of
them. In the present case I have to consider the Article in its entirety,
together with the information available to the person who has also read the 26
September article. Considering the matter from that perspective, I conclude
that the antidote in the Article would clearly remove any bane carried by the
innuendo in the 26 September article.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

In conclusion, I would hold that both the natural and ordinary meaning of the
Article and its innuendo meaning based on the 26 September article are not
defamatory of the plaintiffs. Accordingly their appeals are dismissed. I will
hear counsel on the question of costs.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeals dismissed.
