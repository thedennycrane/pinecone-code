** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The appellant, Lim Choo Song, was charged with the following offence:

> That you, LIM CHOO SONG
>
> On or about the 16th day of June 2001 , at or about 11.10 p.m., in a motor
> car bearing registration number SCV 7067K at the Car Arrival Inspection Bay,
> Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore did import into Singapore a controlled drug
> specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act,
> Chapter 185, to wit, 2 packets of granular substances containing not less
> than 23.43 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the said
> Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an
> offence under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 and
> punishable under section 33 of the said Act.

2\. After a trial, the appellant was convicted and given the mandatory
sentence for importing the stated quantity of diamorphine. He appealed against
his conviction. After considering all the evidence, we dismissed his appeal.
We now give the reasons for our decision.

Background

__

3\. When the appellant’s motor vehicle, bearing registration number SCV 7067K,
was stopped by Central Narcotics Bureau ("CNB") officers at the Woodlands
Checkpoint in Singapore on 16 June 2001, he was the only person in the car. He
had just driven from Johore Bahru to Singapore. When his car was searched at a
car inspection pit, Sergeant Choo Thiam Hock discovered a plastic bag in the
arm-rest compartment of the rear seat of the car. Inside the bag were two
brown envelopes containing a granular substance. The appellant was arrested
and the bag and envelopes were seized.

4\. Tests revealed that the two packets seized by the CNB contained not less
than 23.43 grams of diamorphine with a confidence level of 99.9999%.

5\. After his arrest, the appellant gave a number of statements to CNB
officers. As he spoke Hokkien, his statements, and where relevant, questions
posed to him and his answers, were translated by an interpreter.

6\. About two hours after his arrest, the appellant’s first statement was
recorded when he was questioned by Inspector Omer Ali Saifudeen with the
assistance of his interpreter, Sergeant Choo Thiam Hock. The English
transcript of part of this statement is as follows:

> Q. What is this? (pointing at the bundle)
>
> A. I think drugs….
>
> Q. What is it for? Why did you bring it in?
>
> A. "Ah Meng" asked me to bring in and give to "Ah San".
>
> Q. How much does a packet like this cost?
>
> A. I don’t know. They gave me 1000 ringgit to bring this in.

7\. The appellant was offered an opportunity to make a statement when a charge
was framed and read to him pursuant to section 122(6) of the Criminal
Procedure Code. The consequences of remaining silent and the fact that the
penalty, if convicted, was death, was explained to him. An interpreter, Mr Wu
Nan Yong, was present. The appellant elected to say nothing.

8\. The appellant’s next statement was recorded with the assistance of an
interpreter, Mr Tan Chee Leong, on 21 June 2001. It included the following
paragraphs:

> 1\. On 16 June 2001, at about 11.10 pm, I was arrested at the Woodlands
> Checkpoint. I was in my car, a white BMW SCV 7067K. At the rear seat, inside
> the armrest compartment was a plastic bag. __I knew there was drug inside
> the plastic bag__.
>
> 2\. On 16 June 2001, at about 4 pm, I drove my car … into Johore…. I went
> horse-betting at Merlin Tower. …. Then I proceeded for a hair-cut. At this
> point in time, I received a call on my handphone from a man known as Ah
> Meng. Ah Meng asked me to wait for him at the carpark in Jalan Ah Fook at
> 8-plus pm. He also asked me to help him bring something into Woodlands,
> Singapore. He promised me ringgit one thousand for the effort….
>
> 3\. At 8-plus pm, I went to the carpark in Jalan Ah Fook …. Ah Meng came in
> a black car. I saw Ah Meng approaching towards my car with a plastic bag in
> his hands. He opened the back door of my car, … opened the armrest
> compartment at the rear sear, placed the plastic bag inside it. He asked me
> to bring the thing out. __On my part, I knew it was drug, possibly "bae
> Hoon"__.
>
> 5\. Ah Meng asked me to hand over the thing to a man known as Ah San. I was
> told to drive my car to Woodlands KFC carpark. I do not know Ah San or his
> contact number. Ah San would be the one to identify me. He knew my car
> number.
>
> 6\. At 10-plus pm, I drove my car to the Woodlands Checkpoint…. After that,
> I drove my car into Singapore ….
>
> 8\. …. Upon reaching the Arrival Inspection Bay, I was stopped by a Malay
> CNB officer ….
>
> 13\. The officers then forcefully broke open the cover of the armrest
> compartment. They then found the plastic bag inside. They took out the
> plastic bag. They asked me if there were __any more__ drugs. I said no.…  
>  (emphasis added)

9\. On 22 June 2001, the appellant’s fourth statement was recorded with the
assistance of Mr Tan Chee Leong at around 2.10 pm. In it, the appellant
stated, inter alia, as follows:

> 21\. My previous statement of 21/6/2001 was read back to me in Hokkien by a
> Chinese interpreter. I affirm the statement to be true and accurate. I do
> not wish to add or change anything….
>
> 29\. When I was arrested, the Indian officer asked me what are these things,
> pointing at the two packets of wrapping. __I said drug__. He then took a
> knife and cut open one of the wrappers. He again asked me what are these.
> __I said drug__. I told him Ah Meng asked me to give to Ah San. __I told him
> Ah Meng promised to give me ringgit one thousand__.  
>  (emphasis added)

10\. The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant knew that the two
packets seized from him at Woodlands Checkpoint contained drugs. The
prosecution pointed out that apart from the evidence that the appellant was
aware that he had drugs in his possession, the effect of the presumptions in
sections 18(2) and 21 of the Misuse of Drugs Act was that he was presumed to
be in possession of the envelopes seized from him and that he knew that those
envelopes contained drugs.

11\. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the appellant’s counsel submitted
that there was no case to answer. However, the trial judge ruled that there
was a case to answer. When informed of this, the appellant elected not to give
evidence in court and no other evidence was tendered to advance his case. All
the same, his counsel pointed out that he should not be convicted because
there was a doubt as to whether or not he was the person who was arrested at
Woodlands Checkpoint on 16 June 2001 and there were inaccuracies in the
recording of his statements to CNB officers.

12\. The appellant’s counsel pointed out that apart from Assistant
Superintendent Soh Thiam Loon, no one had identified the appellant as Lim Choo
Song or as the person mentioned in the statements of the witnesses. It was
also alleged that the appellant’s passport and identity card were not
identified in court by Sergeant Ng Beng Chin, the officer who seized these
documents. However, the trial judge said that there was no doubt that the
appellant was the person arrested at Woodlands on 16 June 2001. To begin with,
when the charge was read to the appellant, he did not deny that he was Lim
Choo Song. In fact, he claimed trial. Furthermore, the appellant’s counsel,
who conceded that the appellant’s statements were admissible, posed questions
to Inspector Omer Ali Saifudeen and Sergeant Choo Thiam Hock on the basis that
it was the accused who made the statements in question. During cross-
examination, there was no dispute that the appellant was the person arrested
for having drugs in his car. The trial judge also noted that the appellant had
made it clear in his third statement to CNB officers on 21 June 2001 that he
was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on 16 June 2001. In his fourth statement,
which was recorded on 22 June 2001, the appellant admitted that he was driving
the car bearing registration number SCV 7067K when he was arrested.

13\. As for the attacks on the accuracy of the interpretation of the
statements, it was alleged that the appellant did not say in his first
statement that the packets seized from him contained drugs. He had used a
Hokkien word "tok pin", which meant poisonous substances and not drugs. The
interpreter, Sgt Choo, disagreed. However, Mr Tan Chee Leong, who interpreted
the appellant’s statements on two other occasions accepted, when cross-
examined, that "tok pin" could mean either poisonous substance or drugs. As
for the appellant’s third statement, which was recorded on 21 June 2001, the
appellant’s counsel contended that the appellant had not told the interpreter,
Mr Tan, that he knew that there were drugs in the plastic bag or that it was
possibly "Bae Hoon". However, Mr Tan disagreed and said that if the accused
had not used that Hokkien phrase, it would not have been recorded in the
statement. These alleged inconsistencies were not such as to persuade the
trial judge that the appellant had no case to answer.

14\. The trial judge held that in view of the evidence tendered by the
prosecution, the accused’s statements and his silence, the prosecution had
proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The appeal

__

15\. In his written submissions for the appeal, the appellant’s counsel argued
that the appeal should be allowed because the trial judge failed to give the
appellant the benefit of the doubt that he imported the drugs in question into
Singapore on 16 June 2001 and failed to regard the appellant’s statements to
CNB officers as unreliable as their accuracy had been challenged. However,
events which unfolded before the hearing of the appeal made it impossible for
the appellant’s counsel to rely on these grounds.

16\. On 27 February 2002, the appellant filed Criminal Motion No 4 of 2002 for
the purpose of obtaining an order that he be allowed to adduce fresh evidence
to prove his innocence. For this purpose, he filed an affidavit on 26 February
2002, in which he stated that with regard to the matters set out in the charge
against him, he was in fact gathering evidence for the Central Narcotics
Bureau. However, when the Criminal Motion was heard, counsel for the appellant
informed the court that he had instructions to withdraw the Criminal Motion.
Leave was given to the appellant to withdraw the Criminal Motion and we
proceeded to hear the appellant’s appeal against his conviction.

17\. By withdrawing his Criminal Motion to adduce further evidence, the
appellant placed himself in a difficult position because he had, to date,
presented no evidence that he had been authorised to bring the drugs in
question into Singapore. The appellant’s counsel, Mr James Masih, accepted
that the appellant had admitted in his affidavit filed on 26 February 2002
that the drugs were in his possession, albeit for a different purpose. As
such, the appellant was no longer in a position to contend that there was a
doubt as to whether he had brought the drugs into Singapore. No other argument
was advanced as to why the appeal should be allowed. As such, the appellant’s
appeal was dismissed.
