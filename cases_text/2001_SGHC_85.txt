**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. In this suit, the plaintiffs alleged that their former employees and
directors, together with other parties were in breach of their fiduciary
duties as such when they diverted the plaintiffs business to the third
defendant which was incorporated as a vehicle for that wrongful purpose.

2\. The principal directors/defendants commenced a winding-up petition against
each of the plaintiffs in retaliation. The winding-up petitions have been
dealt with in my grounds of decision dated 22 March 2001.

3\. In respect of this suit, the defendants consented to judgment in terms of
a draft consent order dated 14 March 2001. The terms set out, inter alia, as
follows:

> "1. The 1st Defendant is liable to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs for the
> breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs and the 3rd
> and 6th Defendants are liable to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs for knowingly
> and/or intentionally assisting, facilitating, co-operating, abetting and/or
> acquiescing in the breaches of fiduciary duties by the 1st Defendant.
>
> 2\. The 2nd Defendant is liable to the 2nd Plaintiffs for the breaches of
> fiduciary duties owed to the 2nd Plaintiffs and the 3rd and 6th Defendants
> are liable to the 2nd Plaintiffs for knowingly and/or intentionally
> assisting, facilitating, co-operating, abetting and/or acquiescing in the
> breaches of fiduciary duties by the 2nd Defendant.
>
> 3\. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th Defendants are to pay the Plaintiffs costs
> incurred with respect to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th Defendants in this
> action, to be agreed, if not taxed."

4\. In view of the consent judgment, and the concession in respect of the role
of the third defendant in the breach of facilitation of the breach of
fiduciary duty of the other defendants concerned, it must follow that the
injunction against the third defendant must be continued as a permanent one.
