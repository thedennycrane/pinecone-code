**_The Schedule_ **

****

The Schedule referred to in the originating summons sets out the following
proposed scheme, which is in essence a realignment of the Law Society`s
finances to achieve a more economically sensible arrangement:

> _
>
> 1\. To utilise up to $3.75 million in the Compensation Fund established
> under section 75 of the Legal Profession Act ("the said monies") in payment
> of an outstanding loan taken out by the Law Society from Overseas-Chinese
> Banking Corporation Limited ("OCBC Bank") pursuant to or in connection with
> an OCBC Bank facility letter dated 27 August 1997 for the purchase of the
> premises known as the Law Society Building that is located at 39/41 South
> Bridge Road, Singapore 058673.
>
> 2\. To withdraw the said monies from investments placed with UOB Asset
> Management Ltd and monies deposited at the OCBC bank in cash.
>
> 3\. To treat the withdrawal of the said monies as a loan to the Law Society
> at the interest rate of average fixed deposit rates of the existing local
> banks in Singapore at the time of computation of interest plus 0.5% per
> annum, computed on an annual rest basis and payable in advance ("the Fund
> Loan");
>
> 4\. To utilise the annual Building Fund levies of the Law Society that will
> be collected for the years 2002 to 2007 to repay the Fund Loan and interest
> by way of:
>
> (a) 5 payments of $0.7 million yearly, for the years 2002 to 2006; and
>
> (b) a final payment of the balance of the Fund Loan in year 2007.
>
> 5\. To maintain an open mortgage on the Law Society Building to secure an
> overdraft facility up to the amount of $3.8 million. The overdraft facility
> is to be utilised solely, for so long as the Fund Loan remains outstanding:
>
> (a) to repay any shortfall in payments set out in paragraph 4 of this
> Schedule; and/or
>
> (b) in the event of any shortfall in the Compensation Fund, for the payment
> of such amounts as may be needed to meet any claims made against the
> Compensation Fund provided that such amounts drawn on the overdraft facility
> shall not exceed the amount of the Fund Loan outstanding and shall be
> credited towards repayment of the Fund Loan.
>

**_The Compensation Fund_ **

****

The Treasurer of the Law Society, N Sreenivasan, who is also an advocate and
solicitor, explains the background to the application and its rationale in his
affidavit. He begins with the Compensation Fund established pursuant to s 75
of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2000 Ed) (`LPA`) which allows any person
who has sustained loss as a result of dishonesty on the part of advocates and
solicitors or their employees to receive payment out of the Compensation Fund
for the purpose of relieving or mitigating that loss. As the meaning of
various portions of s 75 of the LPA will be examined, it is helpful to set out
the section in full below:

> _Compensation Fund_

> _
>
> (1) The Society shall maintain and administer in accordance with this
> section a fund to be known as the Compensation Fund (referred to in this
> section as the Fund).
>
> (2) Every solicitor shall, in each year prior to his application for a
> practising certificate, pay to the Society a contribution of such sum not
> exceeding $200 as the Council may, from time to time, determine and the
> Society shall pay that contribution to the Fund.
>
> (3) A solicitor who applies for a practising certificate between 1st October
> in any year and 31st March in the next year shall be required to pay only
> half the contribution so determined if the practising certificate for which
> he proposes to make an application will remain in force for less than 6
> months.
>
> (4) The Society may invest any moneys which form part of the Fund and are
> not immediately required for any other purposes.
>
> (5) For the purposes of this section, the Society shall have all the powers
> vested in trustees under the law for the time being in force in Singapore.
>
> (6) The Society may borrow for the purposes of the Fund from any lender and
> may charge any investments of the Fund by way of security for such a loan.
>
> (7) The Society may insure with any person authorised by law to carry on
> insurance business within Singapore for such purpose and on such terms as
> the Society may consider expedient in relation to the Fund.
>
> (8) There shall be carried to the credit of the Fund -
>
> (a) all annual contributions paid to the Society in pursuance of subsection
> (2);
>
> (b) all interest, dividends and other income or accretions of capital
> arising from the investments of the Fund;
>
> (c) the proceeds of any realisation of any investments of the Fund;
>
> (d) all moneys borrowed for the purposes of the Fund;
>
> (e) all sums received by the Society under any insurance effected by the
> Society under subsection (7); and
>
> (f) any other moneys which may belong or accrue to the Fund or be received
> by the Council in respect thereof.
>
> (9) All moneys from time to time forming part of the Fund and all
> investments of the Fund shall be applicable -
>
> (a) for payment of any costs, charges and expenses of establishing,
> maintaining, administering and applying the Fund;
>
> (b) for payment of any costs, charges and expenses of the Council in
> ascertaining whether the rules made under section 72 have been complied
> with, pursuant to the powers given by those rules;
>
> (c) for payment of any premiums on insurances effected by the Society under
> subsection (7);
>
> (d) for repayment of any moneys borrowed by the Society and for payment of
> interest on any moneys so borrowed;
>
> (e) for payment of any grants which the Society may make under subsection
> (11); and
>
> (f) for payment of any other sums properly payable out of the Fund by virtue
> of this section.
>
> (10) If in any year there has been neither an application for a grant from
> the Fund nor a grant made from the Fund, the Council may, in its discretion,
> transfer from the Fund all interest, dividends and other accretions of
> capital arising from the Fund or any part thereof to a fund of the Society
> established for the purposes of purchasing or maintaining a library for the
> use of the members of the Society.
>
> (11) Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Council that any person
> has sustained loss in consequence of dishonesty on the part of any solicitor
> or any clerk or servant of a solicitor in connection with that solicitor`s
> practice in Singapore as a solicitor or in connection with any trust in
> Singapore of which that solicitor is a trustee or any officer or employee of
> a law corporation in connection with legal services performed in Singapore
> by the law corporation, then subject to this section, the Society may, if
> the Council thinks fit, make a grant to that person out of the Fund for the
> purpose of relieving or mitigating that loss.
>
> (12) A grant may be made under this section whether or not the solicitor had
> in force a practising certificate when the act of dishonesty was committed
> and notwithstanding that subsequent to the commission of that act the
> solicitor has died or had his name removed from or struck off the roll or
> has ceased to practise or been suspended from practice or the law
> corporation had wound up, as the case may be.
>
> (13) On the making by the Society of any grant under this section to any
> person in respect of any loss -
>
> (a) the Society shall to the amount of the grant be subrogated to any rights
> and remedies in respect of the loss of the person to whom the grant is made
> or of the solicitor, clerk or servant;
>
> (b) the person to whom the grant is made shall have no right under
> bankruptcy or other legal proceedings or otherwise to receive any sum out of
> the assets of the solicitor, clerk or servant in respect of the loss until
> the Society has been reimbursed the full amount of its grant.
>
> (14) References to subsection (13) (a) and (b) to the person to whom the

Although the Law Society has the authority to collect up to $200 from each
member as an annual contribution to the Compensation Fund, the current levy is
only $100. As at 15 May 2001, 3,237 advocates and solicitors have taken out
practising certificates for the practice year 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002.
The total annual contribution to the Compensation Fund is therefore expected
to be about $300,000.  
  
The financial year of the Compensation Fund is from 1 August to 31 July of the
following year. Over the last five years from 1996 to 2000, there was a net
surplus in the Compensation Fund for each year and, as at 30 June 2001, the
amount in the Compensation Fund stands at $5.7m. This comprises $1.75m in
fixed deposits with OCBC Bank, $0.35m in cash deposit in the same bank and
$3.6m in cash or near cash assets placed in the care of UOB Asset Management
Ltd. The average annualised rate of return between September 1995 to June 2001
is 0.59%.  
  
**_The Building Fund_**

****

At the annual general meeting of the Law Society in 1993, its members gave the
Council the mandate to locate and, subject to their approval, to purchase
suitable premises. In 1995, an unanimous resolution was passed to approve the
imposition of an annual building levy of $300 on each member. In 1996, the
Building Fund was established with the collections from such levy.  
  
In September 1997, the Law Society purchased its present building at 39/41
South Bridge Road Singapore 058673 for $7m, of which $5.6m was borrowed from
the OCBC Bank. This bank loan is to be repaid in full by 2008. The current
interest rate for the bank loan is 5.75%p[thinsp]a, calculated on the basis of
prime lending rate plus 0.25%. As at 30 June 2001, approximately $4.25m
remained owing to the bank.  
  
Between 1996 and 2000, the annual contributions to the Building Fund ranged
from $0.9m to $1.08m.  
  
**_The scheme_**

****

The bank loan is to be repaid in full with $3.75m from the Compensation Fund
and $0.5m from the Building Fund. This amount of $3.75m will be withdrawn from
the investments placed with UOB Asset Management Ltd and from the cash deposit
in OCBC Bank, leaving a balance of $1.95m in the Compensation Fund. No penalty
or break-up fees will be payable to UOB Asset Management Ltd or to OCBC (where
the early repayment of the bank loan is concerned).  
  
The money from the Compensation Fund will be regarded as a loan to the Law
Society at an interest rate which is the average of the fixed deposit rates of
the existing local banks here at the time of computation of interest plus
0.5%p[thinsp]a. This will be computed on an annual rest basis and payable in
advance.  
  
The Law Society will then use the annual contributions to the Building Fund
for the years 2002 to 2007 to repay the loan from the Compensation Fund. The
first repayment will be made on 1 May 2002. An open mortgage, as set out in
para 5 of the proposed scheme, will be maintained.  
  
The Treasurer goes on to explain that the proposed scheme is to address the
forecasted financial constraints of the Law Society. The Law Society needs
more income to finance existing projects and to meet rising costs but the
decreasing number of lawyers applying for practising certificates has resulted
in correspondingly lower income for the Society. The interest payable on the
bank loan is a major item of expenditure. It does not make sense to pay
interest at 5.75%p[thinsp]a while the money in the Compensation Fund generates
much lower returns.  
  
The Treasurer was therefore asked by the Council to draw up a proposal to
optimise the use of funds as a cost-saving measure. He did so early this year.
On 16 March 2001, the Council deliberated on the proposal and decided that an
application be made for the court`s sanction for the scheme. He concludes his
affidavit as follows:

> _
>
> 23\. The Council of the Law Society favoured putting in place the Proposal
> for the following reasons:
>
> (a) The Fund will earn higher interest from the Fund Loan as compared to
> fixed deposit rates; since the Fund Loan will be repaid at average fixed
> deposit rates of the existing local banks in Singapore at the time of
> computation of interest plus 0.5% per annum. Based on our historical data
> (see paragraph 11 above), the interest payable on the Fund Loan would likely
> be significantly higher than the historical average yield from investment
> made by the fund managers.
>
> (b) The Law Society will save on the interest chargeable to the outstanding
> OCBC loan totaling to a sum of slightly more than $600,000. Such savings can
> be utilised to satisfy the financial needs of the Law Society so that the
> Law Society can better achieve the purposes for which it is established.
>
> (c) The operation of the Fund will unlikely be affected by the Proposal for
> the following reasons:
>
> (i) The historical data in the last 5 years (exhibit "NS-1") shows that no
> claim was made against the Fund in the years of 1997, 1999 and 2000. For the
> years of 1996 and 1998, claims made against the Fund were $132,620 and
> $67,500 respectively. For the year of 2001, possible claims amounting to a
> sum of about $600,000 may be made against the Fund as a result of the
> dishonesty on the part of Mr Krishna Bhaksavatsalu. During the first year of
> the Fund Loan, the Fund will have a cash balance of not less than $1.95
> million. Based on the above historical data, the $1.95 million cash balance
> should be sufficient to meet possible claims.
>
> (ii) Beginning in April 2002, the amount of the cash balance should grow, as
> the Fund Loan will be repaid from the annual Building Fund levies yearly.
> Further, the annual contributions to the Fund collected from lawyers will
> also be deposited into the Fund. The available cash would increase at the
> rate of about $1 million per year (before payments out).
>
> (iii) If the cash balance of the Fund cannot satisfy any claims made against
> the Fund, the overdraft facility that is secured by the open mortgage of the
> Law Society Building will be drawn up to the amount of the outstanding Fund
> Loan to pay all proper claims. In addition, the overdraft facility will also
> be drawn to satisfy any defaults on repayment to the Fund Loan, and so long
> as the Fund Loan has not been fully repaid, the overdraft facility will not
> be utilised for purposes other than those purposes set out in this sub-
> paragraph 23(c)(iii).
>
> (d) The Fund Loan will be made out of the Fund at no cost because no
> expenses will be incurred in respect of withdrawing the investment placed
> with UOB Asset Management Ltd.
>
> 24\. I verily believe that the proposed investment scheme for the Fund as
> set out in the Proposal is both a sound and profitable investment and would
> help the Law Society in its mission of serving the community and serving its
> members. Accordingly, I pray for an appropriate order to be made.

On 11 September 2001, the Law Society sent a copy of the originating summons
to the Attorney General and to the Ministry of Law to seek their comments.  
  
On 13 September 2001, the Solicitor General replied as follows:

> _
>
> 1\. The Originating Summons (`OS`) application to the Court refers to
> Section 75(9)(d) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2000 Ed). The
> section provides that:
>
> "All moneys from time to time forming part of the (Compensation) Fund ...
> shall be applicable for repayment of any moneys borrowed by the (Law)
> Society and for payment of interest on any moneys so borrowed."
>
> 2\. In my view, this section has to be read in conjunction with Sections
> 75(6) and 75(8)(d), both of which refer to moneys borrowed for the purposes
> of the Compensation Fund. It would be difficult to maintain that the loan
> taken by the Law Society when it first purchased its premises and mortgaged
> the premises to OCBC Bank was for the purposes of the Compensation Fund. I
> believe that the premises were purchased exclusively for the use of the Law
> Society as its office. Hence, Section 75(9)(d) is inapplicable. The Fund
> cannot be used to repay moneys borrowed by the Law Society, which had not
> been originally borrowed for the purposes of the Fund.
>
> 3\. The next question is whether Section 75(4) is applicable. Under this
> section, the Law Society may invest any moneys which form part of the Fund
> and are not immediately required for any other purposes. The issue then is
> whether the loan scheme as set out in the Schedule to the OS application
> amounts to an investment.
>
> 4\. By proceeding with the application under Section 56 of the Trustees Act
> (Cap 337, 1999 Ed), I assume that the Law Society is regarding itself as the
> trustee managing and administering the Fund, and that the Fund is
> constituted a trust within the ambit of the Trustees Act. I note that under
> Section 75(5) of the Legal Profession Act, the Law Society has been given
> all the powers vested in trustees under the law in force in Singapore and
> that includes the Trustees Act. Section 6(2) of the Trustees Act also
> applies to limit the power of Law Society to invest in accordance with
> directions of the Minister (in particular with regards to investments listed
> in Parts II and III of the First Schedule to the Trustees Act). By
> implication of law, the Law Society is the trustee of the Fund and the
> Trustees Act will apply.
>
> 5\. On this premise, I do not think that a loan to the Law Society (albeit
> with an interest rate 0.5% higher than the average fixed deposit rates of
> the existing local banks) can be regarded as an investment falling within
> Section 4 and the First Schedule of the Trustees Act (Cap. 337, 1999 Ed).
> There are very strict guidelines as to what investments can be made by the
> trustees. Unless the Fund itself buys the Law Society premises at South
> Bridge Road and the Minister`s approval has been obtained, then it will be
> an investment in a building falling within paragraph 4 of Part II of the
> First Schedule. Income will be from the rentals and the Law Society may be
> one of its long term tenants. However, in choosing investments, trustees
> must consider the need for diversification of the investments of the trust
> having regard to the risk and the circumstances of the trust, which includes
> the provision in this case for ready liquidity to pay compensation as and
> when the need arises. Of course that liquidity can be provided by a standing
> Overdraft Facility used only for the purposes of the Fund and secured on the
> investment property purchased by the Fund. I do not mean however to suggest
> this as an alternative but merely as an example of an investment which may
> be within the purview of the Law Society as trustees of the Fund.
>
> 6\. The fact that the application is taken up under section 56 of the

> compensation fund, which focuses on the benefits to itself than on the
> benefits to the Fund.
>
> 7\. To further safeguard the Fund, you may wish to consider the following
> additional conditions to be imposed by the Court :-
>
> (a) That the Council of the Law Society undertakes to the Court that it will
> not, without the consent of the Court, further mortgage or encumber the Law
> Society premises in any way should the Court approve the withdrawal of
> monies from the Fund to discharge any part of the outstanding loan taken by
> the Law Society from OCBC for the purchase of its premises;
>
> (b) That the Council of the Law Society undertakes to the Court that it will
> not, without the consent of the Court, use the OCBC overdraft facilities
> presently secured on the premises for any other purpose except to repay in
> full or in part the outstandings of the loan disbursed to the Law Society
> from the Fund.
>
> (c) That all costs involved in effecting the loan transaction shall be borne
> by the Law Society.
>
> 8\. I am in no position however to comment on how the Court should or should
> not exercise its discretionary powers in relation to your application.
> Nevertheless, I hope you will find my comments above to be of some use.
>
> _

  
  
On 3 October 2001, the Ministry of Law wrote to the Law Society to say that
they had no objections to the proposal.  
  
I am informed by the Treasurer of the Law Society that the Attorney General`s
Chambers and the Ministry of Law have indicated that they will not be
participating further in these proceedings apart from expressing their views
stated above.  
  
**_The decision of the court_**

****

The Law Society submits that s 75(9)(d) of the LPA empowers it to apply moneys
and investments of the Compensation Fund towards borrowings of the Society. It
relies on the legislative history of the present s 75 of the LPA to support
this contention.  
  
Section 75 of the LPA has its origin in s 41D of the repealed Advocates and
Solicitors Ordinance (`ASO`). Section 41D of the ASO was an amendment
introduced in 1962 to make provisions for the setting up of the Compensation
Fund. A comparative table annexed to the Bill introduced in 1966 (Bill No 57
of 1966) to enact the LPA, which would replace the ASO, shows that s 41D of
the ASO corresponded with s 32 and the Second Schedule to the English
Solicitors Act 1957. The English provisions set up a compensation fund in
England. The Law Society says it is entitled to look at any explanatory
statement relating to a Bill when interpreting the law by virtue of s 9A(3)(b)
of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1999 Ed). Section 41D of the ASO became s 78
of the LPA 1966 which in turn became the current s 75 of the LPA.  
  
The present s 75(9)(d) of the LPA corresponds with para 7(c) of the Second
Schedule to the English Solicitors Act which reads:

> _
>
> 7\. All moneys from time to time forming part of the fund and all
> investments of the fund shall be applicable -
>
> ...
>
> (c) for repayment of any moneys borrowed by the Society **_for the purpose
> of the fund_** and for payment of interest on any moneys so borrowed; ...
> [Emphasis is added.]
>
> _

  
  
While our s 75 follows closely the words in the English provisions,
significantly, the words `for the purpose of the fund` in the English
provisions were omitted from our s 75(9)(d). This suggests that the borrowings
by the Law Society contemplated in this provision are not restricted to
borrowings for the purpose of the Compensation Fund. Accordingly, the Law
Society argues, it may apply moneys and investments of the Compensation Fund
for the repayment of any moneys borrowed and the interest payable thereon,
whatever the purpose of the borrowings might be.  
  
I am not able to agree with this interpretation. It is clear that s 75 of the
LPA (and its predecessor) is meant to govern the Compensation Fund only and is
not a general provision on the financial powers of the Law Society. Paragraphs
(a), (c), (e) and (f) of s 75(9) all have specific reference to the
Compensation Fund. Even para (b), which, when read cursorily, could be said to
have extended the use of the Compensation Fund for purposes unconnected with
it, is in fact related to the Council`s powers under s 75(11) to satisfy
itself that there has been dishonesty which has caused loss. Section 72
[referred to in s 75(9)(b)] enables the Council to make rules on the keeping
of accounts by solicitors and also rules empowering the Council to take such
action as may be necessary to enable it to ascertain whether or not the rules
are being complied with. Read in the context in which s 75(9)(d) appears, it
is therefore plain that the `moneys borrowed` must be those envisaged in s
75(6) and (8)(d) and must be for the purposes of the Compensation Fund. It
cannot be that the Compensation Fund may be depleted by borrowings for other
purposes.  
  
It is accepted that the loan for the purchase of the Law Society`s building is
not one for the purposes of the Compensation Fund and therefore cannot be
repaid out of the Compensation Fund.  
  
The Law Society`s alternative arguments centre on the Trustees Act (Cap 337,
1999 Ed) (`TA`) which features here because of s 75(4) and (5) of the LPA.
Sections 4 and 6 of the TA provide:

> _Powers of investment of trustees_

> _
>
> 4(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a trustee may invest any funds
> in his hands, whether at the time in a state of investment or not, in any
> manner specified in Part I, II or III of the First Schedule and may also
> from time to time vary such investments.
>
> (2) Part IV of the First Schedule shall have effect for the interpretation
> and for restricting the operation of Parts I to III of that Schedule.
>
> (3) Every power conferred by this section shall be exercised according to
> the discretion of the trustee, but subject to any consent or direction, with
> respect to the investment of the trust funds, required by the instrument, if
> any, creating the trust or by any written law.
>
> (4) The Minister may, from time to time by order published in the
> **_Gazette_** , amend the First Schedule.
>
> _

> _Statutory powers of investment_

> _
>
> 6(1) In the case of trustees constituted under any written law, other than
> the Companies Act (Cap. 50), the power to invest in any manner mentioned in
> Parts II and III of the First Schedule shall apply only in so far as the
> Minister may direct.
>

The Law Society accepts that, if it comes within s 6(2) of the TA, it will not
be able to put the proposed scheme into effect as the scheme will not be
within the purview of Pts II and III of the First Schedule. Even if it is a
trustee, Pt I of the First Schedule will not permit such an investment.  
  
Section 75(1) of the LPA (and its predecessor) has again departed from the
wording in the equivalent provision in the English Solicitors Act by omitting
the words `shall be held by the Society on trust` in reference to the
Compensation Fund. Despite the absence of an express trust, I am of the view
that there is an implied trust as evidenced by s 75(5) of the LPA. The Law
Society is therefore within the definition of a `trustee` in s 3 of the TA.  
  
Being a trustee by implication of law, the Law Society is entitled to make an
application to sanction the proposed scheme under s 56 of the TA. Section 56
of the TA (which comes under Pt V of the Act relating to powers of the court)
reads:

> _Power of court to authorise dealings with trust property_

> _
>
> (1) Where in the management or administration of any property vested in
> trustees, any sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release, or other
> disposition, or any purchase, investment, acquisition, expenditure, or other
> transaction, is in the opinion of the court expedient, but the same cannot
> be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose vested in
> the trustees by the trust instrument, if any, or by law, the court may -
>
> (a) by order confer upon the trustees, either generally or in any particular
> instance, the necessary power for the purpose, on such terms, and subject to
> such provisions and conditions, if any, as the court may think fit; and
>
> (b) direct in what manner any money authorised to be expended, and the costs
> of any transaction, are to be paid or borne as between capital and income.
>
> (2) The court may, from time to time, rescind or vary any order made under
> this section, or may make any new or further order.
>
> (3) An application to the court under this section may be made by the
> trustees, or by any of them or by any person beneficially interested under
> the trust.
>
> _

  
  
The proposed scheme falls within the terms `investment` or `other transaction`
in this section.  
  
The Court of Appeal in **Leo Teng Choy v Leo Teng Kit** [2001] 1 SLR 256  has
held (at [para ]22) that s 56 of the TA does not confer powers on the
trustees. Instead it confers powers on the court to make the orders sought and
is therefore not subject to s 2(2) of the TA which reads:

> _The powers conferred by this Act on trustees are in addition to the powers
> conferred by the instrument, if any, creating the trust, but those powers,
> unless otherwise stated, apply if and so far only as a contrary intention is
> not expressed in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, and have effect
> subject to the terms of that instrument._

  
  
Section 3 of the TA defines `instrument` as including a written law. The Court
of Appeal also held (at [para ]24) that s 56(1) of the TA could not be invoked
to sanction or authorise an act or transaction expressly prohibited in the
trust instrument.  
  
Is the proposed scheme `expedient`? In **Riddle v Riddle** [1952] 85 CLR 202,
Williams J in the High Court of Australia, in dealing with s 81 of the Trustee
Act 1925-1942 (NSW), said (at pp 221 and 222):

> _The ordinary natural grammatical meaning of "expedient" is "advantageous",
> "desirable", "suitable to the circumstances of the case". If the Court forms
> the opinion that it is desirable to extend the investment powers of trustees
> it can extend them._

> _..._

> _The one and only test is the expediency of the act or thing which the Court
> is asked to authorize the trustees to do or abstain from doing. The Court
> has only to be of opinion that the trust property as a whole will in fact
> benefit from the making of the order._

  
  
The LPA does not expressly prohibit the Law Society from doing what it
proposes to do through the scheme. For the reasons given by the Treasurer in
his affidavit, it is clear that the Compensation Fund will benefit
significantly without having to undertake additional risk or incur extra
costs. Its operation and integrity will not be compromised. In fact, the
current year`s contributions to the Compensation Fund need not even be
utilised for the scheme.  
  
It makes no difference that the Law Society will also benefit from the savings
in interest payments. This additional benefit is not at the expense of the
Compensation Fund. It is a collateral benefit resulting from a sensible
readjustment of the Law Society`s financial arrangements and commitments. The
Law Society is not making a profit for itself; it is merely seeking to spend
less on interest payments while at the same time ensuring a higher and more
assured yield for the Compensation Fund. Clearly, therefore, the scheme is
expedient for the Compensation Fund and should be sanctioned by the court.  
  
The Law Society is willing to include the additional conditions suggested by
the Solicitor General in paras 7(a) and (c) of his letter of 13 September 2001
(reproduced in full earlier). The condition in para 7(b) of that letter is
already included in the proposed scheme.  
  
Accordingly, I make the following orders:

(1) a declaration that s 75(9)(d) of the LPA does not permit the Law Society
to put the proposed scheme into effect;

(2) an order sanctioning the proposed scheme pursuant to s 56 of the TA;

(3) the conditions set out in paras 7(a) and (c) of the Solicitor General`s
letter dated 13 September 2001 are to be incorporated in the proposed scheme;
and

(4) the Law Society has liberty to apply for consequential orders.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application allowed.
