**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. The appellant was a painter employed by the respondent. A notice of
accident was given by the respondent on 31 July 1998 informing the
Commissioner for Labour that the appellant suffered injury in an accident. The
notice did not indicate whether the injury occurred in the course of
employment but gave the date of the accident as 15 April 1998. This date was
not in dispute. The injury complained of was a fracture of the elbow. The
appellant had his injury examined by a doctor at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital
about the 21 or 22 April 1998, that is, a week after the date of the alleged
accident.

2\. An inquiry was conducted by the Commissioner for Labour and an assessment
of compensation was made on 23 July 1999 awarding a sum of $10,886.40 for the
injury. The appellant and respondent both objected to the assessment under s
25(1) of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ch 354.

3\. Consequent upon the objections, a hearing was held by the Commissioner for
Labour over a total of ten days between January and June 2000. At the
conclusion of the hearing the Commissioner for Labour found that the
appellant's injury did not arise in the course of employment and therefore
dismissed his claim. The appellant appealed before me against that dismissal.

4\. Mr. Mohideen appeared on behalf of the appellant and raised two grounds of
appeal. First, he submitted that the Commissioner for Labour had no
jurisdiction to conduct the hearing on the ground that liability had already
been determined. He argued that when a notice of assessment has been served,
the issue of liability is closed and that a dissatisfied employer can only
resort to an appeal on the issue of quantum to the High Court.

5\. It is useful to set out the relevant provisions under the Workmen's
Compensation Act. The first relevant provision is s 24, sub-ss (1) to (3):

> "(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Commissioner shall have
> power to assess and make an order on the amount of compensation payable to
> any person on any application made by or on behalf of that person.
>
> (2) The Commissioner shall cause to be served on the employer and the person
> claiming compensation personally or by registered post a notice stating the
> amount of the compensation payable in accordance with the assessment made by
> the Commissioner under subsection (1).
>
> (3) If no objection is received by the Commissioner within 2 weeks of the
> service of the notice under subsection

(2), the assessment of compensation made by the Commissioner -

> (a) shall be deemed to have been agreed upon by the employer and the person
> claiming compensation; and (b) shall have the effect of an order under
> section 25(2) but no appeal shall lie against such an order." 6. The Notice
> of Assessment dated 17 August 1999 was issued by the Commissioner for Labour
> under this section. The parties were, for their own reasons, unhappy with
> the assessment. The appellant because he felt that the amount awarded was
> too low, and the respondent because they felt that the accident did not
> occur in the course of employment. They lodged an objection each against
> this Notice of Assessment. The objections were lodged pursuant to s 25. The
> relevant subsections are (1) and (2):-

> > "(1) If any employer or person claiming compensation objects to the notice
> of assessment of compensation issued by the Commissioner under section 24,
> he may, within 14 days of the service of the notice of assessment, give
> notice of his objection in writing to the Commissioner stating precisely the
> grounds of his objection.
>>

>> (1A) …

>>

>> (2) On receipt of the notice of objection referred to in subsection (1),
the Commissioner shall as soon as practicable conduct a hearing of the case
and may hand down a decision accordingly and in pursuance of that decision
make such order for the payment of compensation as he thinks just."

7\. To further support his argument that the Commissioner for Labour has no
power to inquire into liability at this stage, Mr. Mohideen drew a distinction
between a "nil assessment" and a computed assessment in which a figure is
given as compensation. He says that in the case of the latter, the issue of
liability would have been determined but not in the case of the former.

8\. I do not accept this interpretation of the effect of s 25. A plain reading
of s 25 does not permit a construction of this nature and I must agree with
Mr. Tan for the respondent that the same provision cannot be interpreted one
way for the appellant and another for the respondent. If the Commissioner for
Labour finds that there was no accident or that it did not occur in the course
of employment he would not be wrong to record a "nil assessment". In that
situation, the workman would be entitled to challenge the finding by lodging
an objection under s 25(1) of the Act. Such an objection is clearly an
objection as to the issue of liability. By the same token, the employer must
similarly be entitled to challenge a finding on liability when the
Commissioner for Labour has made an assessment. Section 25 expressly permits
both parties to lodge an objection after a notice of assessment has been
issued. There is nothing in that provision which implies that the employer's
objection can only be in respect of quantum. It is true that the employer
would have indicated in his notice of accident that the injury did not occur
in the course of work, but very often, there may not be time to make a proper
investigation. There is no other avenue for a formal inquiry into the question
of liability other than s 25(1). Therefore, his omission in this respect here
cannot be read as an admission that the accident occurred in the course of
employment.

9\. I now come to Mr. Mohideen's second point, that is, his contention that
the evidence does not justify the tribunal's conclusion that the injury of the
appellant did not arise in the course of work.

10\. Counsel referred to alleged acts of admission by the employer such as
paying for the medical fees of the appellant. He also sought to explain the
evidence of some of the witnesses whom the tribunal regarded as unreliable.

11\. The tribunal accepted the employers' evidence that they paid the medical
fees because the Workmen's Compensation Department wrote to them and asked
them to pay. The appellant was engaged as their employee and in these
circumstances I do not think that the mere payment of medical fees arising
from the workman's injury ought to be construed as an admission.

12\. The tribunal in its detailed grounds of decision appears to have
considered all available evidence thoroughly and evaluated them in the way a
finder of fact ought to do. The basic statements from both sides were tested
for their inherent credibility; the evidence was then considered in respect of
contradictions and corroboration. The makers' behaviour and conduct as
witnesses were then scrutinised to enable the tribunal's conclusion as to
which version was more probable. Consequently, a finding of fact made in this
way can only be challenged on the clearest evidence of error. There is none
that was plain to me. The employers had, in my view, adequately put their case
to the appellant in cross-examination. The omission to put to him that the
injury arose from a fight or some other cause in this case was, therefore, not
fatal. The point they made to the appellant was that the injury did not arise
at work. It was not necessary for the employer to prove that the injury arose
in any other specific way.

13\. For the reasons above, the appeal was dismissed.
