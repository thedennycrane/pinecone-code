**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1 This was an appeal by the Second Defendants against the damages assessed and
awarded by an Assistant Registrar pursuant to an interlocutory judgment.

2 The events commenced with an accident on 3 May 1997 when the Plaintiff was
using a lift at the Textile Centre at Jalan Sultan. The lift fell to the
bottom of the lift shaft, and she was injured.

3 The Plaintiff was 51 years old at the time of the accident and was working
as a host mamasan at the Volvo (KTV) Karaoke Lounge. She did not resume work
after the accident because of the injuries to her left lower limb, the post-
traumatic stress disorder that developed, and problems she had with her eyes.

4 The Assistant Registrar assessed damages for the Respondent in the aggregate
sum of $415,341.79 on 6 January 2000. The Second Defendants appealed against
five heads of award made by the Assistant Registrar for-

> (i) fracture of the left tibia and fibula \- $30,000
>
> (ii) fracture of the medial malleolus of left ankle - $20,000
>
> (iii) post-traumatic stress disorder - $40,000
>
> (iv) pre-trial loss of earnings - $72,600, and
>
> (v) post-trial loss of income - $162,000

5 I reduced awards (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) and upheld award (iv). As the
Plaintiff has appealed against the reductions, I shall deal with them.

Injury to the left tibia, fibula and malleolus

6 Dr Sarbjit Singh, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon attached to the Tan Tock
Seng Hospital attended to the Plaintiff from the start and had continued to be
in charge of her case. He stated in his report of 27 November 1997 that

> She sustained an open compound fracture of the left tibia and fibula and a
> closed fracture medial malleolus of the left ankle.
>
> Wound debridement, external fixator application of the left tibia and fibula
> and internal fixation of the left ankle fracture was done on the same day.
>
> She was discharged from hospital on 14.5.97.
>
> Patient developed delayed union of the fractured left tibia requiring
> posterolateral bone grafting on 1.8.97.
>
> When last seen on 7.11.97, the wounds had healed well. The fracture site was
> mobile with a varus deformity. She is still on follow-up.

and in a later report dated 9 November 1998, he added that

> Patient developed delayed union of the fractured left tibia requiring
> posterolateral bone grafting on 1 August 97. Serial x-rays confirmed to show
> poor fracture union.
>
> Acute shortening and Ilizarov distraction osteotomy of the left tibia was
> done on 10 March 98.
>
> Serial x-rays showed good progression of the distraction site. Limited bone
> grafting was done on 10 June 98.
>
> The fracture united on follow-up and the frame was removed on 9 September
> 98.
>
> She is presently walking partial weight bearing. Patient has residual
> stiffness of the left ankle.

7 In his last report dated 6 August 1999 he noted

> The non-union of the left tibia healed on follow-up. She has mild stiffness
> of the left ankle and lack 15 ankle dorsiflexion.
>
> Presently, she walks with a shoe raise. Her left knee range of motion is
> full and painless.

8 The Plaintiff was also seen by orthopaedic consultants in private practice.
In particular, Dr Liang Te Shan submitted his report based upon an examination
on 2 February 1999 that

> 1\. She is markedly hyposthetic from the mid shin level downwards. Her sole
> sensation to pressure and pain is reduced making skin pressure sores likely.
>
> 2\. She has chronic limb pain. This is from a combination of nerve injuries,
> altered weight bearing biomechanics from bone malunions, ankle fusion,
> subtalar fibrodesis and flexion contractures causing clawing of the toes.
> (bone fusion, soft tissue joint scarring, muscle loss and scarring resulting
> in contractures.)
>
> She is basically unable to use her left leg to walk without pain and cannot
> be employed in her prior occupation in a lounge.
>
> 3\. There is in addition unsightly scars and atrophic/poor quality soft
> tissue in the leg and foot.

> Assessment:
>
> Mdm Goh has suffered very severe injuries to her left leg. She also has
> other problems requiring consultation with other physicians and
> psychiatrists. Her injuries have resulted in many months of painful
> treatment, multiple surgeries and loss of gainful employment.
>
> Although surgery was successful in preserving her left leg, the leg is
> functionally useless. In addition, she has chronic persistant disabling pain
> that often results in dependancy on sedatives, psychiatric modifying drugs
> and in some, narcotic analgesics.
>
> In my opinion, she is better off with her leg amputated below the knee as
> her function (and cosmesis with an artificial limb) would be far superior.
>
> As it is, she has little to show in beneficial terms for the pain and
> suffering she has endured. She may well decide eventually to have a below
> knee amputation to remove the painful useless limb and then may be
> rehabilitated back into gainful employment.

9 At the hearing before the Assistant Registrar Dr Singh expanded on parts of
his reports. He explained that an Ilizarov distraction is a technique to get a
fracture site to heal. This involves cutting the bone and placing the leg in a
frame, after which the bone is lengthened by gradual adjustments of the frame
over a period of 6 months.

10 Dr Singh also explained that the loss of 15 ankle dorsiflexion meant that
the Plaintiff’s foot could not be horizontal, but would point downwards at 15.
This is a permanent disability which requires her to wear a shoe with a shoe
raise to walk, and even with that, she will walk with a very mild limp. She is
now able to walk short distances of about 30 metres and her walking is
expected to improve, but there will be some pain and discomfort in the left
forefoot and the ankle.

11 He also commented to the matters raised in Dr Liang’s report. He disagreed
that the Plaintiff’s left leg is functionally useless, and considered
amputation very unlikely.

12 When Dr Liang gave evidence he confirmed that he saw the Plaintiff only
once before he put up his report. After the report, he saw the Plaintiff once
again on 15 July 1999. On the second occasion, she was on a wheelchair.
Although he said he tried to get her out of the wheelchair, she was unwilling
to put weight on her leg because of her pain.

13 On the Plaintiff’s own evidence, her condition has improved since Dr Liang
saw her. She testified before the Assistant Registrar that she can walk about
10 steps in her orthopaedic shoes with the help of a walking stick before she
felt pain. She mentioned that she experienced pain when she walked, but did
not complain of the chronic persistent disabling pain Dr Liang referred to in
his report. She did not say that her left leg is functionally useless, and did
not express any intention to have it amputated. Indeed it was not clear
whether the question of amputation has been brought up to her for
consideration.

14 I preferred Dr Singh’s evidence on the Plaintiff’s condition to Dr Liang’s.
Dr Singh had a greater knowledge of the Plaintiff’s condition than Dr Liang
and the Plaintiff’s own evidence was more consistent with his assessment. Dr
Liang could have been of greater assistance if he had seen in the Plaintiff
more often than he did, and closer to the hearing before the Assistant
Registrar.

15 It appears from the evidence that the closed fracture of the medial
malleolus healed without problems, as did the open compound fracture of the
left fibula. The fractured tibia was more troublesome. A delayed union
required bone grafting and Ilizarov distraction before it healed properly. The
fracture of the medial malleolus of the left ankle has also healed with a 15
loss of dorsiflexion (upward flexing) in the left ankle. She has a slight limp
and discomfort when she walks and she can only walk short distances now
although that would improve in time.

16 Counsel for both parties cited precedent awards for injuries similar to
those suffered by the Plaintiff. Two relatively recent awards for fractures of
the tibia and fibula with residual disabilities were of particular assistance.

17 In _Alagamalai s/o Veerasamy v Chan Lian Chan,_ November 1994 MMD 1603, a
39-year-old police officer suffered comminuted fractures of the distal shafts
of the left tibia and fibula. There was malunion at the fracture site with
disuse atrophy of the bones. The left leg was shortened by 2 cm, and the lower
half of the leg was deformed. There was limitation of movement in the left
ankle \- 5 loss of dorsiflexion as well as 15 loss of plantarflexion (downward
flexing). He walked with an obvious limp and was unable to squat fully. He was
awarded $20,000 in 1994.

18 In _Lai Sin Wah v Ng Soo Ngoh_ January 1999 MCL 72 a 42-year-old carpenter
had comminuted fractures of the tibia and fibula. His right leg was infected,
malunited and shortened. He experienced chronic pain over the fractured right
leg aggravated by heavy lifting and chronic discharge from the right shin. He
had a limping gait and unsightly bowing of the right shin, and was unable to
run, jog or squat. For these injuries he was awarded $25,000 in 1998.

19 An older 1991 award for similar fractures with residual disabilities was
also referred to. This was in _Parakatt Sajeev s/o Kunniyer Damodara Kurup v
Camperon Bernard_ – _Singapore Piling Civil Contractors Pte Ltd_[1996] MD 991
_._ A 28-year-old carpenter sustained an open wound over the medial aspect of
the left leg and open fracture of the left tibia and fibula. External fixation
and split skin graft were applied to the open wound. He developed an infected
non-union which required treatment by debridement and Gentamycin beads, but
even with the treatment infection may flare up again in the future. The
residual disabilities were two large scars, a stiff ankle and difficulty in
squatting and rapid ambulation. $36,000 was awarded for these injuries. This
is higher than the 1994 and 1998 awards as the residual injuries were less
severe, with no shortening or deformity. I accepted the two later awards to be
more reflective of the current levels of awards for such injuries.

20 For the injuries to the malleolus and the ankle two awards made in 1992
were cited. $12,000 was awarded to a 21-year-old construction worker for a
closed fracture of the medial malleolus with stiffness of the ankle in _Lee
Wee Yee & Anor v Koh Geok Chee & Ors_ December 1992 MMD 1574. In _Mohamad
Aliman bin Kassim v Zulkifli bin Abdul Latib & Anor _1998 MD 1750, $20,000 was
awarded to a 52-year-old driver/storekeeper for an open fracture of the right
medial malleolus with puncture wound over the fracture site, resulting in
permanent slight restriction in dorsiflexion of the ankle as well as
osteoarthritis in the ankle which may lead to pain that require treatment.

21 I used these awards as guides and benchmarks. I took into account the
differences in the forms and severity of injuries eg the Plaintiff’s limited
ability to walk and the fact that her fractures have healed without
shortening, the overlap between the three fractures to her lower limb, and the
age of the Plaintiff. After considering these matters, I concluded that an
award of $40,000 for the lower limb injuries was appropriate, and reduced the
Assistant Registrar’s awards for these injuries by $10,000.

Post-traumatic stress disorder

22 Three psychiatrists gave evidence on the post-traumatic stress disorder the
Plaintiff developed. Dr Kwek Seow Khee of the Department of Psychological
Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital who had attended to the Plaintiff submitted a
report dated 21 July 1999 that

> Mdm Goh developed Posttraumatic Stress Disorder following the fall of the
> lift she was in from 19th storey. Her symptoms were elaborated in the
> previous report submitted by my colleague dated 4 Feb 99.
>
> She has been regular with her follow-up as well as with her medication.
> Though fairly stable on the whole up to her last visit, her symptoms tended
> to get worse when she ran out of medication. Her treatment also needed
> adjustment at times when she experienced new stressors, such as the repeated
> hospitalization for operations.
>
> She continues to experience fear each time she enters a lift and have
> startle response at the hearing of noise produced by appliances e.g. air-
> conditioner. She needs to be accompanied for most part of her daily life and
> has to avoid items that would remind her of her traumatic experience such as
> a violent scene from a television show.
>
> She has departed from her previous confident character and outgoing
> lifestyle and has tended now to be dependent on people and medication.
>
> It is likely that she needs ongoing treatment for the foreseeable future.

23 Dr Tan Lay Ling of the Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Woodbridge
Hospital is the colleague Dr Kwek referred to. Dr Tan reported on 4 February
1999 that

> Mdm Goh was referred to the Psychological Department by the Department of
> Orthopaedic Surgery of Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 9 July 97\. Mdm Goh
> apparently sustained an open compound fracture of the left tibia and fibula
> and a closed fracture medial malleolus of the left ankle when the lift she
> was in fell 19 floors. She requested for a psychiatric referral as she was
> complaining of insomnia following the accident.
>
> Mdm Goh reported having insomnia since her accident on 4 May 97. She would
> experience recurrent, intrusive images of the scene of the accident that
> disturbed her sleep. She also worries that her air-conditioner would fall on
> her while she sleeps and would startle easily at the slightest noise in the
> room. She developed intense fear and avoidance of taking lifts. She was also
> anxious and had difficulty concentrating on what she was doing.
>
> Mdm Goh was diagnosed to be suffering from a posttraumatic stress disorder
> following the accident. She was started on medications with regular
> outpatient follow-up.
>
> When she was last reviewed on 14 Jan 99, her sleep has improved with the
> medications, but she was still rather anxious. She was not noted to be
> depressed.

24 The Plaintiff saw Dr Peh Lai Huat on 2 February 1999 for a second opinion.
He noted in his report of 19 August 99 that

> Besides her physical injuries, she suffered from psychological symptoms
> after the incident in May 1997 in which she was inside a falling lift. These
> include anxiety and being easily frightened by noises. When she partially
> overcame her fears of using lifts, she grew alarmed when there were many
> people in the lift or when the lift showed signs of not closing properly.
> She manifested phobic avoidance in such situations by letting the lift go
> first or insisting on getting out of it immediately.
>
> These signs and symptoms indicate that she developed Post-traumatic Stress
> Disorder as a result of the lift incident.
>
> She was initially depressed and had insomnia. Her physical disabilities and
> restrictions of lifestyle were factors contributing to her despondency and
> anxieties about her future.
>
> She received treatment for her condition at the Department of Psychological
> Medicine of Tan Tock Seng Hospital but continued to be symptomatic. When I
> reviewed her on 19 August 1999, her mental state was anxious and she
> reported being startled by loud noises such as that from the air-conditioner
> at home. She would also have tremors of her body when she came across
> television scenes of disasters and would avoid them.
>
> In my opinion, Mdm Goh Eng Hong has not fully recovered from her psychiatric
> disorder and needs continuation of treatment. The physical and mental trauma
> she suffered and the loss of functional abilities put her risk of
> depression, even in the future. The psychological part of her rehabilitation
> needs to be taken into consideration, in addition to the treatment of her
> post-traumatic stress disorder.

25 Only one precedent for an award for post-traumatic stress disorder was
cited to me, namely _Pang Koi Fa v Lim Djoe Phing_ [1993] 3 SLR 317. The
plaintiff was a lady of 51 whose daughter died as a result of the negligence
of the defendant, a neurosurgeon. No report of her condition was set out, but
it can be gathered from the judgment that the plaintiff was distraught when
her daughter died. She was on the verge of a breakdown and almost committed
suicide. She complained of heart palpitations, breathlessness, insomnia,
crying episodes, loss of interest in her work and social life. She was
preoccupied with memories of her daughter, and preserved her daughter’s room
at home and her desk at her office. There was evidence that she underwent a
personality change; she stopped cooking for the family, became over-protective
of her son and quarrelled frequently with her husband. Her psychiatrist
diagnosed her to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and
pathological grief, with the grief bringing on the disorder. She was awarded
$30,000 general damages.

26 The signs and symptons described were as severe, if not more severe than
the Plaintiff’s. Furthermore counsel for the Second Defendants drew attention
to the fact that while both ladies developed stress disorder, the plaintiff in
_Pang Koi Fa_ also experienced pathological grief. He argued that the
Plaintiff should not get more than the $30,000 the latter received. I could
not fault the reasoning, and reduced the award under this head from $40,000 to
$30,000.

Loss of income

27 The Plaintiff had claimed that she was earning $6,635 a month at the time
of the accident. She was appointed as a host mamasan in April 1997, after a
2-week trial period. She had a group of 8 to 10 "daughters" under her charge.
She received from the lounge $110 for each bottle of Martell or Hennessy
brandy opened by customers entertained by her or her "daughters". She claimed
that she kept these payments to herself because all the customers were her
customers, and the "daughters" were only entitled to the tips they received
from the customers.

28 Prior to becoming a host mamasan, she was a freelance mamasan from 1988 to
1992. She explained that a freelance mamasan is not employed by or attached to
a nightclub, and accompanies her customers to the nightclubs they patronise. A
host mamasan entertains her customers at a fixed establishment, but she is
also not under its employment. The Plaintiff claimed that her takings as a
freelance mamasan were more than $3,000 a month, but she did not say whether
that was before or after she shared the takings with her "daughters" (as
freelance mamasans do).

29 The Plaintiff did not produce any documentary evidence to support her claim
on her earnings. She called Gan Chin Kuan, a partner of the Volvo (KTV)
Karaoke Lounge (since renamed Classic KTV Karaoke Lounge), as her witness.

30 His evidence was that the Plaintiff had a 2-week trial period as a host
mamasan from about 10 March 1997 and became as a regular host mamasan from 3
April 1997. He confirmed that the Plaintiff received $110 for each bottle of
liquor opened by customers entertained by the Plaintiff or her "daughters". He
produced vouchers recording payment of $6,635 to her in April 1997.

31 However Mr Gan contradicted the Plaintiff’s claim that all the customers
entertained by her and her "daughters" were her customers. He was quite firm
that about 30% of them were customers of the "daughters".

32 The Assistant Registrar did not accept the Plaintiff’s claim that she
earned $6,635 as a host mamasan. He held that

> The Plaintiff’s evidence in court was that the full $6,635 commission was
> hers to keep and that her girls shared no part of it, their remuneration
> consisting solely of tips given by their customers. In my view, the
> possibility of the $6,635 commission having to be distributed between the
> Plaintiff and her girls cannot be overlooked. Apart from the fact that the
> Plaintiff’s testimony was wholly self-serving and uncorroborated by any
> documentary evidence or the evidence of her girls (none of whom were
> called), the owner of the lounge’s (Gan Chin Kuan) testimony was that for
> all of the Plaintiff and her girls’ work, he would pay a lump sum commission
> to the Plaintiff and it was up to the Plaintiff to remunerate her girls, if
> at all. There is thus a real possibility that the Plaintiff merely retained
> part of her $6,635. This is particularly likely in light of the owner’s
> testimony that he knew as a fact that the customers who patronised the
> Plaintiff and her girls belonged to both the Plaintiff and her girls. There
> was consequently no reason for the Plaintiff to pocket the full commission
> when some of the customers were actually not hers.

33 He set the Plaintiff’s pre-trial income at $2,200 per month, applied a
multiplier of 33 months and awarded $72,600 pre-trial loss of earnings. The
Plaintiff did not appeal against this award, which I upheld against the Second
Defendants’ appeal.

34 The Plaintiff has appealed against my variation of the Assistant
Registrar’s award for post-trial loss of earnings of $2,700 a month for 5
years, which worked on to $162,000.

35 The Assistant Registrar set the higher multiplicand for the post-trial
earnings with the explanation that

> The pre-trial multiplicand is significantly lower than the post-trial
> multiplicand because the economy was bad for the second half of 1997, 1998
> and for part of 1999. The services that the Plaintiff provided was in the
> nature of a luxury item and therefore its performance was expected to
> fluctuate with the economy...As for the post-trial multiplicand I have
> decided that $2,700 per month was reasonable.

36 It was not the Plaintiff’s case that her earnings would have increased in
1999. She made her claims for pre-trial and post-trial loss of earnings on the
same multiplicand of $6,635 per month. No submission on economic fluctuations
was made by counsel. There was no evidence before the Assistant Registrar the
state of the karaoke lounge business over that period or how that would impact
on a mamasan’s earnings. With no input from persons in the trade like Mr Gan
or the Plaintiff’s former colleagues, these are not matters on which judicial
notice can be taken.

37 Consequently, I did not uplift the multiplicand for the post-trial loss and
kept it at $2,200.

38 That left the multiplier to be established. The Assistant Registrar set it
at 5 years "considering that the Plaintiff is already 54 at the time of the
trial and the fact that the job in question is dependant on age". There was
little evidence to help the court. The Plaintiff said nothing about it in her
affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and only mentioned during re-examination that
she could have worked for "10 odd years" if she was not injured. Mr Gan told
the Assistant Registrar that host mamasans can work for as long as they want
if they have their customers and "daughters", and that he had seen them
working to between 50 and 60, but he was non-committal about their working
beyond 60.

39 It is not clear what retirement age the Assistant Registrar adopted. I
found that 60 years would be fair on the evidence available. It is trite law
that in assessing lost future income, the multiplier to be applied is not the
full measure of the lost working years. This was made clear by the Privy
Council in _Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd_[1984-1985] SLR
10, where Lord Fraser of Tullybelton held that in the selection of an
appropriate multiplier discounts should be made for the inevitable
contingencies and uncertainties of human life and working capacity, as well as
the fact that an award for lost future earnings is received in an accelerated
lump sum payment.

40 Looking at the Plaintiff’s employment record, she was working as a host
mamasan for about a month and was a freelance mamasan before that. From the
evidence it can be inferred that mamasans are prone to come and go, as are the
lounges and nightclubs they operate in.

41 Apart from the lower limb injuries and stress disorder, the Plaintiff was
having problems with her eyes which would affect her ability to work. She
developed cataracts in both eyes after the accident.

The left eye underwent surgery in September 1997, and the right eye was
operated on in August 1999. The Plaintiff deposed on 29 November 1999 that she
was still having trouble with her vision, with numerical figures appearing
sometimes reversed as in a mirror image, or upside down, or as entirely
different figures, and vision of her left eye is blur. The Assistant Registrar
had found that the eye condition was not connected to the accident and the
Plaintiff had not appealed against this finding.

42 After taking these matters into consideration, I found that the multiplier
of 5 years is not justified, and I set it at 3 years. Consequently I reduced
the award for post-trial loss of income to $2,200 for 3 years, or $79,200,
from the $162,000 awarded by the Assistant Registrar.
