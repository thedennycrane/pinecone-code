2018)

Woo Bih Li J:

Introduction

1 This action was the second action filed by the plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”)
against the defendant, Chen Weiping (“Chen”), as guarantor of the obligations
of Midas Holdings Limited (“Midas”). It was similar to the first action in
Suit No 420 of 2018 filed by the Plaintiffs against Chen. The first action was
in respect of “the Series 003 Notes” issued by Midas. The second action was in
respect of “the Series 004 Notes” issued by Midas.

2 The background to the second action was the same as that to the first
action.

3 On 7 November 2018, the Plaintiffs filed Summons No 5242 of 2018 for summary
judgment against Chen.

4 On 4 December 2018, the Plaintiffs and Guo Bingqiang filed Summons No 5698
of 2018 to strike out the counterclaim by Chen against them.

5 Likewise, on 4 December 2018, Patrick Chew filed Summons No 5705 of 2018 to
strike out Chen’s counterclaim against him and Summons No 5703 of 2018 to set
aside Chen’s Third Party Notice against him. The Third Party Statement of
Claim had apparently not been filed yet.

Decisions

6 As the arguments in respect of the four applications were the same as those
in respect of similar applications made in the first action, the outcome was
the same. I granted the substantive reliefs sought by the applicants in the
four applications in the second action.

7 I am releasing my grounds of decision for the applications in the first
action on the same day as these grounds for the second action. The grounds for
the first action will also apply to the applications in the second action.
