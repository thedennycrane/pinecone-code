Criminal Law – Application by Public Prosecutor under s 60 of the Supreme
Court Judicature Act (Cap 322) asking for question of law of public interest
to be referred to the Court of Appeal – Whether motion be allowed.  
  

1 The Public Prosecutor made an application under s 60 of the Supreme Court of
Judicature Act (Cap 322) (‘SCJA’) asking for a question of law of public
interest to be referred to the Court of Appeal. The matter arose from the
Magistrate’s Appeal No 196 of 2002, whereby the appellant Pius Gilbert Louis
was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for causing grievous hurt under s325
of the Penal Code (Cap 224). As the judge sitting in the appellate capacity, I
had employed the proviso to s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to
increase the appellant’s sentence of imprisonment from 6 to 10 years, despite
the fact that the maximum sentence for a s 325 offence is 7 years. The proviso
reads, "Provided that where a District Court has convicted any person and it
appears that by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents, a
punishment in excess of that prescribed in this subsection should be awarded,
then the District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for a term
not exceeding 10 years and shall record its reason for so doing." The Public
Prosecutor’s question of law for the determination by the Court of Appeal was
framed as such:

Whether the proviso to s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) allows
the District Court, and consequently the High Court in the exercise of its
appellate jurisdiction, to impose a sentence beyond the maximum punishment
prescribed for the offence.

2 Section 60(1) SCJA requires me to reserve for the decision of the Court of
Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen from my
determination of a matter in this case upon an application by the Public
Prosecutor. I therefore allowed the motion and granted an order in terms of
the Public Prosecutor’s application.

_Motion allowed_
