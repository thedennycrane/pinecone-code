AR Christopher de Souza:

**Facts**

This application was taken out by the Defendant for an order that the Suit be
stayed on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_ pursuant to paragraph nine of
Schedule One to the Supreme Court Judicature Act (Chapter 322, 1999 Edn). The
Defendant contends that the appropriate forum of adjudication is a court in
Malaysia.

2 The Defendant is a Malaysian citizen who is the majority shareholder of
Kumpulan City Axis Sdn Bhd (“Kumpulan”). Kumpulan is an investment holding
company that presently holds, inter alia, 49,500,000 shares in ISG Asia Ltd
(“Kumpulan’s investment”), a listed company in Singapore. The Defendant’s
position is that the Plaintiff’s business interests are mainly outside
Singapore, with a sizeable portion in Malaysia.

3 Sometime in 2001, the Plaintiff, together with one Chung Wai Meng (“Chung”),
provided funding to Kumpulan to assist in the listing exercise for Kumpulan’s
investment. The Defendant contends that at this time, it was agreed that
Kumpulan would transfer 21,000,000 shares in Kumpulan’s investment to the
Plaintiff and Chung after the successful completion of the listing exercise.
Approval for this transaction was sought from the Malaysian central bank, Bank
Negara Malaysia. The requisite approval was granted on 17 April 2002.

4 The Listing exercise was completed in July 2002. Thereafter, as maintained
by the Defendant, 15,000,000 shares in Kumpulan’s investment were transferred
from Kumpulan to Sanzio Ltd, the latter being a company jointly owned by the
Plaintiff and Chung.

5 Following this, the Defendant became open to the idea of providing a further
entitlement of assets in Kumpulan to both the Plaintiff and Chung on condition
that Kumpulan’s business operations performed well in the future.
Nevertheless, as emphasised by the Defendant, this openness was merely a
gesture of good will in the form of a ‘gentlemen’s arrangement.’ The Defendant
argued that it was understood at that time that the further entitlement would
be amicably discussed and agreed to by parties concerned before any payments
were executed. It must be stressed that the question as to whether this was
indeed more than just a ‘gentlemen’s arrangement’ is not for this Court to
answer since answering such a question would require the Court to analyse the
merits of the case, which, as will be shown later, is not the role of this
Court.

6 It is the Defendant’s argument that the Plaintiff asked for written
assurance of this “gentleman’s arrangement” and the Defendant, out of
goodwill, agreed to provide him with a comfort letter in this regard.
Thereafter, the parties entered into negotiations in respect of the terms of
the arrangement which negotiations the Defendant insists took place in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.

7 The fruit of the negotiations was a document signed by both parties on 3
January 2004 in Kuala Lumpur. This document was drafted by Mr Wong Swee Min, a
Malaysian-based solicitor. The document provided for a transfer of shares from
Kumpulan to the Plaintiff along with the re-purchase of said shares from the
Plaintiff by the Defendant. This document forms, for all intents and purposes,
the backbone in the argument between the two parties and therefore merits full
reproduction in the judgment text:

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

Made between Yeunh Oi Siong (‘Yeunh’) and Tay Way Bock (‘Tay’) on this 3rd day
of January 2004.

The Parties hereto understand and agree with each other as follows:

1\. Yeunh confirms and acknowledges that Tay is the beneficial owner of
13,000,000 ordinary shares of SGD 0.05 in ISG (formerly known as City Axis
Holdings Ltd) (‘ISGA’)(‘the Sale Shares’) [Note that ISGA is referred to as
“Kumpulan’s investment” in the judgment].

2\. The Sale Shares are registered through Kumpulan City Axis Sdn Bhd.

3\. Yeunh has agreed to buy and Tay has agreed to sell his interest in the
Sales Shares at the purchase price of SGD 0.125 per share (‘Purchase
Consideration’) in accordance with the terms recorded herein this Memorandum
of Agreement.

4\. The sale of the Shares shall be made in 2 tranches and the Purchase
Consideration payable in respect thereto shall be paid by Yeunh to Tay in the
following manner: -

(a) the first tranche of 6,500,000 Sale Shares and a sum of SGD 812,500.00
(equivalent to 50% of the Purchase Consideration) shall be completed and paid
on or before 14 February 2004 (‘First Payment’); and

(b) the second tranche of 6,500,000 Sale Shares and the balance purchase
consideration of SGD 812,500.00 shall be completed and paid on or before 30
July 2004 (‘Second Payment’).

5\. At the request of Yeunh, the Purchase Consideration shall be paid in
Ringgit Malaysia at a conversion rate of SGD 1.70 to RM3.80, to solicitors in
Malaysia appointed by Tay, namely Messrs. Megat Najmuddin Leong & Co. of 102
Jalan Bangsar, 59200 Kuala Lumpur.

8 On 13 October 2005, the Plaintiff commenced these proceedings in the
Singapore High Court, alleging that the Defendant had breached the agreement
above. The Plaintiff, on his part, took issue with the Defendant’s account of
the facts and argued as follows:

(a) The agreement reached on 3 January 2004 was not merely a ‘comfort letter’;

(b) The Bank Negara document exhibited by the Defendant did not state that the
Defendant could avoid payment of the agreed S$0.12 per share to the Plaintiff;

(c) The Bank Negara document predates the agreement and even the listing and
is therefore irrelevant;

(d) The share transfer provided by the Defendant and stamp duty for 10,000,000
shares due to the Plaintiff were lodged and paid in Singapore;

(e) The Plaintiff’s claim is for payment of those shares in the listed company
in Singapore.

9 In addition, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendant had foiled a nearly
successful transfer of 10,000,000 shares to the Plaintiff’s wife. According to
the Plaintiff, the Defendant did so by faxing a letter from Singapore
disclaiming any knowledge of the Plaintiff’s wife. In the words of Counsel for
the Plaintiff, “this was the straw that broke the camel’s back” and the suit
commenced.

**The law**

**_(A) Merits Irrelevant_**

10 It is clear that where the Court is dealing with an application to stay
proceedings on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_ , it is not to apply its
mind to the merits of the case. In the case of **_The Rainbow Joy_** [2005]
SGCA 36, Chao Hick Tin JA ruled:

“In weighing the balance of convenience under the doctrine of _forum non
conveniens_ , the issue of whether there is a defence to the claim is not a
relevant consideration as the court should not be required to go into the
merits.”

11 To use an analogy, the pre-occupation of a Court hearing a _forum non
conveniens_ application should be to ascertain where the ‘shell’ of the case
should be heard – in Singapore or in a more appropriate court overseas. Only
after this has been ascertained and the ‘shell’ lands in the appropriate
jurisdiction, does the Court of that jurisdiction go into the substance within
that ‘shell.’ It is therefore not for this Court to decide whether the
‘gentlemen’s arrangement’ was indeed a binding agreement since the Court is
not interested in the issue of liability here.

**_(B) The Dual Limb Test_**

12 The judicial test to be applied in cases involving stays on the grounds of
_forum non conveniens_ is found in the authoritative case of **_Spiliada
Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd_** [1987] AC 460 where Lord Goff Of
Chievely held:

(a) The basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of
_forum non conveniens_ where the court is satisfied that there is some other
available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum
for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably
for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.

(b) [I]n general the burden of proof rests on the defendant to persuade the
court to exercise its discretion to grant a stay … It is however of importance
to remember that each party will seek to establish the existence of certain
matters which will assist him in persuading the court to exercise its
discretion in his favour, and that in respect of any such matter the
evidential burden will rest on the party who asserts its existence.
Furthermore, _if the court is satisfied that there is another available forum
which is**prima facie** the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, the
burden will then shift to the plaintiff to show that there are special
circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the trial should
nevertheless take place in this country._ [My emphasis].

13 The **_Spiliada_** case was cited with approval by Chao Hick Tin J (as he
then was) in the case of **_Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp & Anor v PT
Airfast Services Indonesia_** [1992] 2 SLR 776. In the **_Brinkerhoff_** case,
Chao J stated that the following rubric, taken from **_Dicey & Morris’s
Conflict of Laws_** (11th Edn) should apply in cases where stays are argued
for on grounds of _forum non conveniens_ :

“The court will look to see what factors there are which point to the
direction of another forum, as being the forum with which the action has the
most real and substantial connection, eg factors affecting convenience or
expense (such as availability of witnesses), the law governing the
transaction, and the places where the parties reside or carry on business.

If at that stage the court concludes that there is no other available forum
which is clearly more appropriate it will ordinarily refuse a stay.

_If there is another forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate the
court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of
which justice requires that a stay should not be granted, and, in this inquiry
the court will consider all the circumstances of the case_. But the mere fact
that the plaintiff has a legitimate personal or juridical advantage in
proceeding in England is not decisive; regard must be had to the interests of
all the parties and the ends of justice.” [My emphasis].

14 In the case of **_PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises_** [2001] 2 SLR
49, Chao Hick Tin JA elaborated on the judicial analysis to be undertaken by
the Court:

“If the court concludes that there is such a more appropriate forum, it will
ordinarily grant a stay unless, in the words of Lord Goff, ‘there are
circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should
nevertheless not be granted. In this inquiry the court will consider all the
circumstances of the case, including circumstances which go beyond those taken
into account when considering connecting factors with other jurisdictions.’”

15 Andrew Phang JC (as he then was) provided a detailed analysis of the
relevant law in the case of **_Q & M Enterprises Sdn Bhd v Poh Kiat_** [2005]
4 SLR 494. It is clear from Andrew Phang JC’s judgment that the **_Spiliada_**
principles which were entrenched in Singapore law through the cases of
**_Brinkerhoff_** and **_PT Hutan_** are binding on this Court today.

16 These four leading cases point to the conclusion that the litmus test to be
applied by the Court possesses two limbs. First, the court must be satisfied
that there is another available forum which is _prima facie_ the appropriate
forum for the trial of the action. Second, the burden will then shift to the
plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which
justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in this
country. Therefore, the test is, intrinsically, a weighing exercise.

**_(C) The Ultimate Question_**

17 The two pronged litmus test exists merely to aid the Court in answering the
ultimate question which according to Chao Hick Tin JA in the **_PT Hutan_**
is:

“Where should the case be suitably tried having regard to the interest of the
parties and the ends of justice?”

18 If in answering the question above the Court decides that the case is most
suitably tried overseas, then the stay of proceedings must be ordered pursuant
to paragraph nine of Schedule One to the SCJA.

**Applying the law to the facts**

19 Having mapped out the facts of this case and having set out the law, the
Court is now required to apply the law to the facts without going into the
merits of the case proper.

**_(A) Factors to consider_**

20 In the case of **_PT Hutan Domas Raya v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd_** [2001] 2
SLR 49, Chao Hick Tin JA elaborated on the factors the Court should take into
consideration when assessing the forum most connected to the circumstances of
the case. Chao JA held:

“In determining [whether, prima facie, there is some other available forum,
having competent jurisdiction, which is more appropriate for the trial of the
action], the court will look to see what factors there are which point in the
direction of another forum as being the forum with which the action has the
most real and substantial connection, eg _availability of witnesses, the
convenience or expenses of having a trial in a particular forum, the law
governing the transaction and the places where the parties reside or carry on
business._ ”

The legal burden of showing these factors rests on the Defendant applying for
the stay.

**_(B) Agreement signed in Malaysia; Preparation and Negotiations leading up
to Agreement carried out in Malaysia; Agreement drafted by Malaysian
solicitor; Agreement envisioned execution to be performed in Malaysia_**

21 The Defendant was clear that the entire series of transactions and
negotiations leading up to the signing of the document, including the funding
arrangements for the listing exercise of Kumpulan’s investment, were carried
out in Malaysia. In addition, the defendant stated that all of these
discussions took place in Kuala Lumpur and/or Malaysia.

22 Based on the evidence before the Court, I found three material facts that
connected the case to Malaysia. Firstly, the document dated 3rd January 2004
was signed in Kuala Lumpur by both the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Secondly,
the document was drafted in Malaysia by a Malaysian solicitor – one Mr Wong
Swee Min. Thirdly, clause 5 of the document unambiguously states that payment
of the monies under the agreement will be paid to the Plaintiff’s Malaysian-
based solicitors (namely, Messrs. Megat Najmuddin Leong & Co. of 102 Jalan
Bangsar, 59200 Kuala Lumpur.)

23 These are significant factors to be taken into account in the weighing
exercise needed to be undertaken by the Court. Indeed, the very judgment of
Andrew Phang JC in **_Q & M Enterprises_** shows that the three facts above
are valuable indicators. Phang JC stated:

“It is, indeed, clear that the majority of the real and close connecting
factors were located in _Malaysia_. These include **_the underlying
transaction upon which the defendant is basing his defences_** , the
**_material_** **_witnesses_** as well as the **_documents_** of ACT (which
had, as already mentioned, since been wound-up as a result of proceedings
initiated by the plaintiff itself in Malaysia). It is important to note that
it is not the mere literal or factual geographical connections that are
important (which the plaintiff raised in the context of Singapore). There must
be legal significance, so that the mere number of geographical connections
_per se_ is not conclusive by any means. Besides, the concessions by counsel
for the plaintiff also militate against the success of his case.

In the circumstances, therefore, I found that the Malaysian courts were
clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action.” [My emphasis].

**_(C) Key witnesses based in Malaysia_**

24 I found merit in the Defendant’s argument that Chung, a Malaysian citizen
who is ordinarily resident there, was a key witness. After the listing
exercise was completed in July 2002, the Defendant was open to the idea of
providing a further entitlement of assets in Kumpulan to both the Plaintiff
and Chung on condition that Kumpulan’s business operations performed well in
the future. Chung’s evidence would therefore be important and relevant – it
will give insight into the nature of the ‘gentlemen’s arrangement.’

25 I was of the opinion that the evidence of the Malaysian solicitor, Mr Wong
Swee Min, would prove crucial since he was instrumental in the drafting of the
document that is at the very heart of the argument. While I am aware that the
Defendant had written a stern letter to him stating that he (the Defendant)
did not agree with the contents of Mr Wong’s draft affidavit, there is
nonetheless the inescapable fact that holding the trial in Malaysia will
provide Mr Wong with a more convenient forum to attend.

26 It is clear from the judgment of Chao J in the **_PT Hutan_** case that the
availability of witnesses was a key consideration the Court should take into
account.

**_(D) Agreement governed by Malaysian Law_**

27 The document which was signed in Kuala Lumpur made no reference to
Singapore Law. In the case of **_Yugiantoro v Budiono Widodo_** [2002] 2 SLR
275, Tan Lee Meng J held:

“If the alleged oral contract was made, it certainly did not deal with the
question of the proper law of the contract. In the circumstances of this case,
it would not be meaningful to try and determine whether or not any inference
may be drawn regarding the intention of the parties on the choice of law. It
would be more productive to determine whether or not the alleged agreement has
the closest and most real connection with Indonesian law.”

28 The ‘most real connection’ principle was extracted from the judgment of
Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) in the case of** _Las Vegas Hilton Corp t/a
Las Vegas Hilton v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny_** [1997] 1 SLR 341 where it was held:

“To determine the question of ‘closest and most real connection’ many factors
may be taken into account, the main ones are — the place of contracting, the
place of performance, the places of residence or business of the parties
respectively; and the nature and subject-matter of the contract: see **_Re
United Railways of Havana and Regla Warehouses Ltd_** [1960] Ch 52 at 91 per
Jenkins LJ.”

For the reasons already cited in paragraphs 22 and 23 above, I find that the
alleged agreement has the closest and most real connection with Malaysian law.

**_(E) Lack of special circumstances to show that forum should remain in
Singapore_**

29 For the sake of completeness, Lord Goff in the **_Spiliada_** case and Chao
JA in the **_PT Hutan_** case stressed that the Court must still apply its
mind to whether there were circumstances by reason of which justice required
that a stay should nevertheless not be granted. In this respect, the Plaintiff
raised three main points in his bid to challenge the stay.

30 The first argument was that a stay would deprive them of a judicial
advantage. I was not persuaded by this argument. The facts showed that the
Malaysian court would be the forum of most convenience and it is the
principles of convenience, entrenched in the leading cases of **_Spiliada,_**
**_Brinkerhoff,_** **_PT Hutan_** and **_Q & M Enterprises_**, that ought to
be the guiding lights for this Court and not enquiries into which forum would
be more advantageous to a certain party. In fact, in the case of **_NM
Rothschild & Sons (S) Pte Ltd v Plaza Rakyat Sdn Bhd_** [1995] 3 SLR 374, Kan
Ting Chiu J re-emphasised the following principle laid down in the
**_Spiliada_** case:

“The fact that a refusal of leave to serve out of the jurisdiction or a stay
of the action might deprive the plaintiff of a legitimate personal or
juridical advantage would not, as a rule, deter the court from granting a stay
or refusing leave if it is satisfied that substantial justice would be done in
the appropriate forum.”

For reasons already cited in paragraphs 22 to 28, I am convinced that
substantial justice will be done in the Malaysian courts. The document was
signed there. Key witnesses are based there. The parties even envisioned that
the transaction was to be completed there. In addition to these
considerations, the Court has the additional duty to respect international
comity. The importance of giving such respect was emphasised by Andrew Phang
JC in the case of **_Q & M Enterprises_**. In particular, Phang JC held:

“The importance of international comity cannot be underestimated. The domestic
courts of each country must constantly remind themselves of this point – if
nothing else, because of the natural tendency towards favouring domestic law
over foreign law.”

Thus, for the reasons given in paragraphs 22 to 28 and 30, the Plaintiff’s
first argument was incapable of challenging the stay application.

31 The second argument put forward by the Plaintiff was that the Defendant’s
application was clearly an attempt to delay proceedings. I am convinced that
the Defendant is not abusing the processes of Court to achieve an ulterior
aim. Admittedly, I say this without any knowledge of the merits of his defence
but quickly add that it is in fact not the purpose of this Court to analyse
the substance of the issue in contention. What is unambiguous is the law on
this issue. It is clear that an assertion by the Plaintiff that the Defendant
was merely taking out an application under _forum non conveniens_ to delay
proceedings is, on its own, an insufficient tool to fight a stay application –
see Lai Siu Chiu J’s judgment in **_PT Jaya Putra Kundur Indah & Anor v
Guthrie Overseas Investments Pte Ltd_** [1996] SGHC 285 and Kan Ting Chiu’s
Judgment in **_NM Rothschild & Sons (S) Pte Ltd v Plaza Rakyat Sdn Bhd_**
[1995] 3 SLR 374. Therefore, this second argument lacked the strength to
displace the merits in support of the stay application.

32 The third argument put forward by the Plaintiff was that one key aspect
within the trial would go beyond the jurisdiction of the Malaysian Courts. In
particular, the Plaintiff argued by way of written submissions:

“14. The Defendant addresses the issue of his non-disclosure of the
Plaintiff’s beneficial interest in the Company’s Initial Public Offering (IPO)
prospectus, with a bare denial, saying that the agreement dated 3 January 2004
was made 2 years after the IPO.

15 The Question of whether a Court will give effect to the said agreement
against the background of the non disclosure in the prospectus, is a decision
only a Singapore Court can make because [it] relate[s] to shares in ISG Asia,
a Singapore listed company.

…

20 The Plaintiff’s beneficial interest in the ISG Asia Ltd was created
sometime prior to the listing company’s listing and is substantial, the
holding of which required a written notice to the Company, and post 1 October
2002 to the Exchange. Any change in the extent of the interest requires
notification. The Defendant is duty-bound to make such notifications in
Singapore as the principal executive here.

21 If a single omission to notify/disclose the Plaintiff’s before 1 October
2002 (the date the relevant part of the Securities Future Act (“SFA”) took
effect) forms the basis of a possible prosecution in Singapore, it would be
brought under the Companies Act (“CA”) and a lesser maximum fine is payable.

22 Hence, this matter of the Defendant’s failure to notify of the Plaintiff’s
substantial shareholding will come to light in the Plaintiff’s suit and hence
only a Singapore Court can give effect to the agreement dated 3 January 2004.”

33 I analysed the provisions the Plaintiff sought to rely on in support of his
third argument against the stay – namely, sections 7(6), 80(1), 80(2), 81(4),
82, 83, 84 and 89 of the Companies Act (Chapter 50) and s 137 of the
Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) – and found that the potential
application of these provisions would not impair a Malaysian Court’s ability
to adjudicate over the issue. The Companies Act provisions deal primarily with
the ‘notification obligations’ of a substantial shareholder who has either
relinquished or gained a substantial quantum of shares. In respect to s 137 of
the Securities and Futures Act, this provision deals with the duty of
substantial shareholders to notify the securities exchange.

34 From what is visible thus far, this case pertains to an alleged agreement
prepared, negotiated, drafted and signed in Malaysia. The issue of liability
is intrinsically linked to the validity of this agreement. Duties and
obligations of notification under the Companies Act and the Securities and
Futures Act will not hinder the Malaysian Court’s ability to scrutinise the
specific issue, which is the validity of the agreement dated 3rd January 2004.
Thus, this third argument was insufficient to challenge the stay application.

**Conclusion**

35 The Plaintiff asserted in an affidavit that the Defendant had dined with
the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s wife. Yet, the Defendant feigned ignorance
of her when she started to play an instrumental role in the transfer of the
shares in question. It was obvious from the Plaintiff’s oral arguments that
this was “the straw that broke the camel’s back.” The consequence is this
suit. Why such ignorance was feigned must remain unanswered at this stage
since probing any further would be to slide into an analysis of the merits of
the case, which falls beyond the duty of this Court.

36 On the basis of the principles entrenched in the leading cases of
**_Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd_** [1987] 1 AC 460,
**_Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp & Anor v PT Airfast Services
Indonesia_** [1992] 2 SLR 776, **_PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises_**
[2001] 2 SLR 49 and **_Q & M Enterprises Sdn Bhd v Poh Kiat_** [2005] 4 SLR
494 the Court finds as follows:

(a) There is another available forum, which is _prima facie_ the appropriate
forum for the trial of the action.

(b) The plaintiff has not shown that there are special circumstances by reason
of which justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in
Singapore.

The two conclusions above have aided the Court in coming to the following
answer to the “ultimate question” as framed by Lord Goff in the **_Spiliada_**
case and Chao JA in the **_PT Hutan_** case:

This case should be tried in Malaysia having regard to the interest of the
parties and the ends of justice.

37 The Court will therefore grant the application in SIC 5963 of 2005/Q and
will allow prayers 1 and 2.
