**JUDGMENT:**

1\. The Plaintiffs were and are mortgagees of the vessel ‘Equator Royal’ (‘the
Vessel’) owned by Thong Soon Maritime Pte Ltd (‘the Owners’).

2\. The Vessel was mortgaged to the Plaintiffs for a facility granted to Thong
Soon Lines Pte Ltd (‘Thong Soon Lines’).

3\. The Owners had entered into a Barecon ’89 Charterparty dated 1 May 1998
with the Defendants for the charter of the Vessel by the Defendants for a
period of twelve months from 1 May 1998. The Defendants had an option to
extend the Charterparty for a further twelve months.

4\. The facility to Thong Soon Lines was terminated by letter from the
Plaintiffs’ solicitors, M/s Rajah & Tann, dated 5 May 1998.

5\. By a letter also dated 5 May 1998, the Plaintiffs also demanded payment
from the Owners for the monies outstanding.

6\. On 20 July 1998, the Plaintiffs commenced action in Suit No 1219 of 1998
in which Thong Soon Lines were the First Defendants and the Owners were the
Third Defendants.

7\. By a letter dated 13 August 1998, M/s Rajah & Tann wrote to the Defendants
to inform them of the Plaintiffs’ interest in the Vessel and asked that all
future hire be paid directly to them as solicitors of the Plaintiffs.

8\. However, they also put the Defendants on notice of the Plaintiffs’
entitlement to take possession of the Vessel and to require that the Vessel be
moved to any location for the purpose of preserving the Plaintiffs’ security
in the Vessel. They therefore required the Defendants to sail the Vessel back
to Singapore immediately.

9\. The Plaintiffs then obtained Judgment in Default of Appearance against the
Owners in Suit No 1218 of 1998. The Judgment was obtained on 28 August 1998
and included a mandatory injunction to deliver up the Vessel to the
Plaintiffs.

10\. There was no reply from the Defendants to the first letter dated 13
August 1998.

11\. A reminder was sent by M/s Rajah & Tann dated 2 October 1998 seeking a
response by 5 October 1998 and threatening legal proceedings in the absence of
a reply. Again there was no reply from the Defendants.

12\. A third letter was sent by M/s Rajah & Tann to the Defendants dated 13
October 1998. This letter enclosed a copy of the default Judgment obtained on
28 August 1998. It also asked the Defendants to revert as to whether they
would be taking steps to deliver up the Vessel. Again there was no reply.

13\. The Defendants did not dispute that the Plaintiffs were entitled to
possession of the Vessel.

14\. The Defendants’ position was that the Charterparty was terminated by the
Defendants on or about 27 July 1998 when due notice was given by the
Defendants to Thong Soon Lines to ‘off-hire’ the Vessel due to a mutiny aboard
and the crew refusing to sail the Vessel amongst other reasons. The Defendants
said that they were no longer the hirer of the Vessel on 13 August 1998 when
the first letter was sent to them and they were not in possession of the
Vessel then.

15\. Prima facie, the Defendants had been in possession of the Vessel prior to
13 August 1998 and even prior to 27 July 1998 pursuant to the Charterparty.
That was not in dispute.

16\. The burden of proof was therefore on the Defendants to establish that
they had terminated the Charterparty on or about 27 July 1998 and that
pursuant to that termination, they had parted with possession of the Vessel
before 13 August 1998.

17\. I find that the Defendants have failed to discharge that burden.

18\. Accordingly, I grant judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs against the
Defendants.

19\. The Defendants are to pay damages for detinue calculated as follows:

> (a) Damages for detention at US$400 per day from 1 September 1998, and not from 13 or 14 August 1998 because the Defendants would have taken some time to sail the Vessel back to Singapore even if they had complied with the Plaintiffs’ directions to do so. Such damages are calculated up to date of judgment. This works out to US$400 x 750 days (731 days for 2 years + 19 days for September 2000) | \- US$300,000  
> ---|---  
> (b) Damages being the value of the vessel as at date of the judgment | \- US$270,000  
> (c) _Less_ the estimated cost of paying the crew to sail the Vessel back to Singapore and other expenses, say, | \- US$10,000  
> | __________  
> | _US$560,000_  
  
20\. The Defendants are also to pay the Plaintiffs the costs of the action.
