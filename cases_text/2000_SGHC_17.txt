: This was an appeal by the plaintiff against the decision of the learned
assistant registrar in SIC 300556/99 where she made determinations on certain
questions of law and made orders flowing therefrom.  
  
**_The parties_**

****

The plaintiff is the daughter-in-law of Manghanmal Hiranand Ramchandani @
Manghanmal Hiranand (`the deceased`) who died on 30 August 1994 at Mt
Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. The deceased was domiciled in Hong Kong. The
first defendant is a daughter of the deceased. The third defendant is the
husband of the first defendant. The second defendant is the son of the
deceased, husband of the plaintiff and brother of the first defendant.  
  
The first and third defendants are the executors of the deceased`s estate
under a will dated 24 April 1986 and a codicil dated 16 October 1987 (to be
collectively referred to as `the 1986 will`).  
  
The second defendant is the sole beneficiary named in the 1986 will.  
  
**_The claim_**

****

The Hong Kong High Court has granted probate of the 1986 will to the first
defendant with leave to the third defendant to apply for and obtain a like
grant. In 1998, when the first defendant petitioned for probate in Singapore,
she discovered that the plaintiff had filed a caveat against the grant of
probate here. Pleadings were then ordered to be filed.  
  
The plaintiff claimed that the 1986 will was not executed by the deceased and
that he did not execute and could not and would not have executed the said
will in the presence of the alleged witnesses, one Raymond Lee (a solicitor)
and Sandy Yung (a clerk) where the will was concerned and the said Raymond Lee
and Betty Yip (a clerk) in the case of the codicil.  
  
The deceased had executed a will in December 1983 (`the 1983 will`) at Los
Angeles, California, wherein the first and third defendants were also named as
executors. The deceased was then of ill health and had executed that will in
urgent circumstances. It did not truly reflect his wishes and concerns and was
revoked by him shortly thereafter.  
  
On 22 November 1988, the deceased executed a document entitled `The Last will
of Manghanmal Ramchandani` (`the 1988 will`) which he declared therein to be
his last irrevocable will and testament which cancelled all previous wills and
codicils. In the 1988 will, said to have been executed at Los Angeles,
provision was made for the deceased`s wife but she predeceased him. That will
also provided that upon the second defendant attaining the age of 45, the
trustees appointed therein would distribute the principals of the trust
together with their undistributed income to the second defendant (25%), the
plaintiff (25%), their three children (15% each) and to all managers of the
deceased`s business worldwide who had served him for ten years and more at the
date of his death (5%).  
  
The 1988 will, described therein as `an undisclosed will`, nominated the first
defendant and one Ram G Hiranand as executors and trustees. It bore the
apparent signature of the deceased but was not witnessed by anyone. However,
all three pages of the 1988 will contained the stamps of `Berris Seton &
Bishton`, law offices in Los Angeles.  
  
The plaintiff averred that the defendants were well aware prior to the
deceased`s death of his intention to distribute his estate in the manner
stated in the 1988 will. Alternatively, the defendants were said to be aware
of the declared intention and wishes of the deceased amounting to the creation
of a trust.  
  
It was further alleged that all three defendants had intermeddled with the
deceased`s properties and their incomes since the death of the deceased and
had failed to distribute the estate in accordance with the trust stated in the
1988 will.  
  
The plaintiff therefore prayed that the petition for probate be dismissed, for
a declaration that the 1983 will stand revoked and that the estate be subject
to the said trust. In the alternative, if the 1983 will or the 1986 will be
admitted to probate, a similar declaration that the estate be subject to the
trust in the 1988 will was sought. The plaintiff also asked for an inquiry and
account of the alleged intermeddling by all three defendants.  
  
**_The defence and counterclaim_**

****

The defendants averred that the 1986 will had been duly executed by the
deceased who was domiciled in Hong Kong. The High Court of Hong Kong has
granted probate to the first defendant on 6 May 1998 and it was therefore the
plaintiff`s burden to prove the matters alleged by her. The plaintiff was also
said to be estopped from challenging the validity of the 1986 will or the
grant of probate by the Hong Kong High Court since she did not protest against
the grant of probate by the Superior Court of California, County of Los
Angeles, on 18 July 1996.  
  
The defendants denied any awareness of the existence or execution of the 1988
will and averred that no trust existed in law or in fact. They also denied any
intermeddling with the estate as the acts of administration by the first
defendant were validly done pursuant to the Hong Kong grant.  
  
The defendants counterclaimed that the court pronounce against the 1988 will,
that the plaintiff`s claim be dismissed, that probate of the 1986 will be
granted to the first defendant with leave given to the third defendant to come
in and prove the same and that the second defendant was the beneficiary under
the 1986 will.  
  
**_The reply and defence to counterclaim_**

****

This, in essence, denied any estoppel against the plaintiff challenging the
grant of probate under the 1986 will as she claimed she was under the mistaken
impression that the defendants or any of them was taking steps to administer
the estate in accordance with the 1988 will in the various jurisdictions in
which the properties were located.  
  
**_The assistant registrar`s order dated 27 April 1999_**

****

The application was taken out by all three defendants who were then
represented by the same firm of solicitors.  
  
**_The affidavits_**

****

All three defendants filed affidavits stating that the 1986 will was the only
testamentary script of the deceased within their possession and knowledge and
their belief that the 1986 will was prepared at the instructions of the
deceased by his Hong Kong solicitors, Messrs Woo Kwan Lee & Lo, whose
solicitor and employees witnessed the execution thereof.  
  
The first defendant also affirmed an affidavit to state that he had sought
legal advice from lawyers practising in Hong Kong (the deceased`s domicile),
India (the deceased`s nationality) and California (where the 1988 will was
purportedly made) as he had been advised that the laws of these three
countries with which the deceased had a nexus could validate the 1988 will,
which was obviously invalid in Singapore because of non-compliance with our
Wills Act. All the lawyers consulted concluded that the 1988 will was invalid
as a will in the respective jurisdictions.  
  
The deceased continued to hold an Indian passport although he had been a
Permanent Resident of Hong Kong since 1950. The entries in that passport
showed that the deceased was in Hong Kong from 20 November 1988 until he left
for the USA on 4 May 1989. It was therefore impossible for the deceased to
have executed the 1988 will in Los Angeles on 22 November 1988.  
  
The defendants also obtained an affidavit by Norris J Bishton, an attorney
practising in California. From 1980 to 1982, he was a partner with the law
firm of Berris, Seton & Bishton practising in Los Angeles.  
  
Mr Bishton stated that the said law firm was not in existence since 1982. The
law firm did not use any of the two stamps appearing in the 1988 will. The
purported Notary Public stamp bearing the law firm`s name was not one used in
California as only individuals, not firms or corporate bodies, could be
notaries. There was also no signature beside the stamps to verify the person
who allegedly placed the stamps on the 1988 will. He confirmed that he did not
place the stamps on that will and neither did he prepare nor witness the
execution thereof. To the best of his belief, no one in that law firm prepared
or witnessed that will. The law firm used various standardized provisions in
wills, none of which appeared in the 1988 will, which was invalid anyhow in
California as there were no two witnesses as required by law.  
  
Norman Berris, another former partner in Berris, Seton & Bishton, said in his
affidavit that he was a partner in the law firm of Berris & Seton from 1970 to
1987 located in Los Angeles. From about 1984 to 1985, the firm changed its
name to Berris, Seton & Bishton. (From the latter portion of his affidavit, it
would appear that Mr Berris meant changed `from` rather than `to`).  
  
Mr Berris confirmed that he was not the one who placed the stamps on the 1988
will and he did not prepare or witness the execution thereof. To the best of
his belief, no lawyer from the firm prepared or witnessed the said execution.
He stated that the stamps were forgeries as the Notary Public stamp was not
one used under the laws of California where only individuals could be
notaries. The typewriter or computer font found in the 1988 will was not a
type used by his former law firm. The name Berris, Seton & Bishton had not
been used since approximately 1985 and in 1987 (about one year before the 1988
will was purportedly executed), the entire law office of Berris & Seton closed
down. All stationery and stamps bearing the name of Berris, Seton & Bishton
were destroyed in approximately 1985 when the firm`s name changed back to
Berris & Seton.  
  
In his opinion, the 1988 will was therefore a forgery. It was invalid in any
event because of non-compliance with Californian law requiring at least two
witnesses to the execution by the testator.  
  
In her affidavit, the plaintiff explained how she came to know of the 1988
will. She was the only daughter-in-law of the deceased and lived in the same
household as he did in Hong Kong. They were extremely close to each other. She
cared for and attended to his needs like a daughter. The deceased and the
plaintiff`s three children loved one another dearly.  
  
In late 1988 or early 1989, the deceased requested the plaintiff, as he often
did, to get his medicine kept in his personal drawer for him. This drawer also
contained his personal items, documents, expensive pens and many gold coins.
While getting the medicine, the plaintiff saw the original 1988 will. She
glanced through it and seeing that it made provisions for her, her husband
(the second defendant) and their three children, she was very grateful to the
deceased although she did not speak to him about the will. Thereafter,
whenever she was asked by the deceased to get something from that drawer, she
would see the 1988 will there.  
  
Sometime after the deceased`s wife died in 1989, he gave the plaintiff a copy
of the 1988 will. At that time, the relationship between the deceased and the
second defendant was strained.  
  
The plaintiff produced copies of faxes exchanged between August to October
1994 between the second defendant and a firm of solicitors in London and a
family friend, which, she claimed, would show that the defendants were well
aware of the existence of the 1988 will. She did not elaborate. The faxes
talked about transfer of the deceased`s properties, avoidance of USA tax and
the deceased deciding to form a trust for his grandchildren and a proposed
power of attorney to be made by the deceased in favour of the first defendant.  
  
She reiterated that her claim was not to admit the 1988 will to probate and
that all the affidavits of the lawyers regarding the validity of that will in
the various jurisdictions were therefore completely irrelevant. As for the
allegation that the deceased could not have executed the 1988 will on 22
November 1988, she said from the abovementioned documents exhibited and `other
evidence which I have in this matter but which is not appropriate to adduce in
detail at this juncture, including several meetings held and telephone
conversations, it is evident that the deceased executed the 1988 will,
intending the contents thereof to be effected and believing that the 1988 will
would be valid as a will; and the defendants were aware of the 1988 will`.
Even if 22 November 1988 was not the date the deceased executed the 1988 will,
that was irrelevant so long as it was executed by him. The important matter
was whether it evidenced a trust.  
  
The plaintiff maintained that all along she was under the impression that
probate was sought for the 1988 will. The first and third defendants had given
her that impression by mentioning after the deceased`s death that the deceased
had wished to give all his properties to her family and that the estate would
be distributed according to his wishes. It was only in November 1997 at a
meeting with the second defendant and his (London) solicitor in London that
she became aware of the 1986 will. On 6 May 1998, her then Hong Kong
solicitors attempted to file a caveat in the Hong Kong High Court but were
told that it was too late. When the defendants took out probate in Dubai, USA
and Hong Kong, she was led to believe that it was the 1988 will that was being
submitted.  
  
In respect of the 1983 will, that was also made in or by the office of Berris,
Seton & Bishton on 30 December 1983 and one of the three subscribing witnesses
and his wife were and remained very close friends of the first and third
defendants. The witness would have at least mentioned the 1983 will to the
First and third defendants, who must have been the ones who arranged for the
1983 will to be prepared by the said Californian law firm and for their good
friend to be one of the witnesses.  
  
Where the 1988 will was concerned, the plaintiff believed that the deceased
must have relied on some person(s) who misled him into believing that the 1988
will was valid as a testamentary document. There was therefore obviously more
than met the eye in this case.  
  
About a week before the appeal finally came up for hearing before me, the
plaintiff`s solicitor filed an affidavit enclosing a statutory declaration
made by the second defendant on 18 August 1999 together with a deed dated 28
May 1999. Both of these documents were made after the learned assistant
registrar`s decision in this matter.  
  
In this surprising turn of events, the second defendant turned the tables on
the first and third defendants. He annexed a copy of a fax dated 6 October
1994 to his solicitor in London (which also appeared in the plaintiff`s
affidavit) wherein he agreed with the solicitor that both the 1983 and the
1988 wills would attract USA tax problems and that in view of this, the
executors (the first and third defendants) had `earlier organised another will
prepared last September and since then I was very nervous to inform you`.
This, according to the second defendant, was the 1986 will. The 1986 will
could not have been made by the deceased since he had passed away on 30 August
1994 before that will was `organised in September 1994`. The signature of the
deceased in the 1986 will was therefore a forgery.  
  
In the statutory declaration, the second defendant went on to explain that
since his father`s death, he had been in a confused state and the first
defendant, who knew about his confused state, had been domineering and was
controlling his affairs and instigating him to divorce the plaintiff and to
forsake the three children. He had no intention of defending this action but
was completely under the influence and domination of the first defendant who
refused to listen to his protests. He had recently begun to realize the folly
of allowing his sister to dominate him in this manner and had been trying to
rectify what had happened since then.  
  
The deed dated 28 May 1999 between the plaintiff and the second defendant
stated that it was to be the full and final settlement of all matters arising
out of this action. The second defendant agreed not to proceed with divorce
proceedings, to remit certain amounts of money to his children by certain
dates and to `implement and faithfully carry out all the wishes of the
deceased as manifested and executed by the deceased in the 1988 will both in
substance and according to the spirit of the 1988 will notwithstanding that
the 1988 will may in any way be defective or unenforceable in law`. The second
defendant also agreed to discharge and/or remove the first and third
defendants as trustees and executors of all three wills in question and to
appoint in their place such person(s) to be approved in writing by the
plaintiff. The parties further agreed that nothing in the deed was to be
construed as an admission by the plaintiff that the 1986 will was executed by
the deceased, that the 1988 will was legally defective or unenforceable and
that the 1983 will had not been revoked. The deed was witnessed by a Notary
Public in London.  
  
**_The decision of the court_**

****

Before the learned assistant registrar and before me, the parties agreed that
the 1988 will was not validly executed and was not a will in Singapore or in
any of the other relevant jurisdictions. It was of course a misnomer to call
it a `will` but I think everyone concerned fully appreciated that and
continued to use that term for the sake of simplicity.  
  
I agreed entirely with the learned assistant registrar`s determination that
the 1988 will was not valid for the purposes of creating and/or evidencing a
trust in the deceased`s estate.  
  
In **Cross v Cross** [1877] 1 LR Ir 389, a promissory note given by a daughter
to her father was kept with the daughter as the father was dying. On his
death, it was found that the promissory note was endorsed by the father with a
direction that it was to be delivered up to be cancelled after his death so
that the daughter would be exonerated from paying on the same. Unfortunately,
the father`s signature was attested by only one witness. The court had this to
say (at pp 400 to 402):

> _I cannot but say that it seems to me that some mischief has been caused by
> endeavouring to sustain the gifts of donors where they fail in the way they
> were intended to take effect, by making them valid in some other manner; for
> instance, by turning the donor into a trustee under an imputed declaration
> of trust. The law is placed upon a sound footing in**Richards v Delbridge**
> , and the passage in the judgment of Lord Justice Turner, in **Milroy v
> Lord** , quoted by Sir G Jessell in that case, clearly states the rule - `I
> think the cases go further, to this extent, that if the settlement is
> intended to be effectuated by one of the modes to which I have referred, the
> court will not give effect to it by applying another of those modes. If it
> is intended to take effect by transfer, the court will not hold the intended
> transfer to operate as a declaration of trust, for then every imperfect
> instrument would be effectual by being converted into a perfect trust.` That
> language applies with peculiar force here. Mr Cross, I think, plainly
> intended to keep the debt on the promissory note alive during his lifetime;
> he only intended that his daughter should be released therefrom on his
> death. That intention cannot be carried out in the manner he desired, as he
> made no valid testamentary disposition of the note in her favour. To hold
> that the note was a present gift **inter vivos** , or that Mr Cross
> constituted himself a trustee of it for his daughter, would appear to me to
> go not merely straight in the face of the endorsement, but to reverse all
> the acts and conduct of himself, and also of his daughter, bearing on the
> note itself ... In truth, Mr Cross endeavoured to make a testamentary gift
> of the note in a manner which the law does not permit. The gift must
> therefore fail._

  
  
Similarly in **Towers v Hogan** [1889] 23 LR Ir 53, the court said:

> _... I decide this case solely on the second point, viz that the document
> relied on as a declaration of trust is a testamentary instrument, and not
> being executed as a will, is completely inoperative ... The language of the
> instrument and all the circumstances connected with it plainly indicate that
> the writer intended it should operate only after his death, and that he
> adopted this form of disposition only to avoid the payment of duty. If a
> document of this character, and executed as this was, were allowed to
> operate as the creation of a trust, the Statute of Wills would be
> practically repealed._

  
  
Documents meant to be testamentary in character (ie having no effect during
the life of the maker) which do not comply with the Wills Act cannot therefore
become virtual wills by being regarded as declarations of trust. The 1988 will
clearly fell within this category. To impose a trust by virtue of this
document is to revoke the 1986 will by a process not sanctioned by law and
thereby nullifying the Wills Act altogether.  
  
The next issue is whether the first and third defendants have to prove the
1986 will notwithstanding the Hong Kong grant of probate. The first and third
defendants relied on Section 43 Evidence Act which reads:

> _
>
> (1) A final judgment, order or decree of a competent court, in the exercise
> of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or bankruptcy jurisdiction, which confers
> upon or takes away from any person any legal character, or which declares
> any person to be entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any
> specific thing, not as against any specified person but absolutely, is
> relevant when the existence of any such legal character or the title of any
> such person to any such thing is relevant.
>
> (2) Such judgment, order or decree is conclusive proof -
>
> (a) that any legal character which it confers accrued at the time when such
> judgment, order or decree came into operation.
>
> (b) that any legal character to which it declares any such person to be
> entitled accrued to that person at the time when such judgment, order or
> decree declares it to have accrued to that person; ...
>
> _

  
  
**_Sarkar`s Law of Evidence_ ** (15th Ed, 1999) Vol 1 at pp 827 to 829
explains that judgments covered in the Indian equivalent of s 43 are usually
referred to as judgments **_in rem_** which are conclusive not only against
the parties involved but also against all the world. `Competent court`
includes a foreign court and it is not in dispute that the Hong Kong High
Court had the requisite jurisdiction to grant probate. **_Sarkar_** goes on to
state that once probate has been granted, it is conclusive of the validity and
the contents of the will and the appointment of the executors until the
probate is revoked in proceedings for that purpose.  
  
Section 46 Evidence Act provides that a judgment, order or decree under s 43
may be shown by a party to have been delivered by a court not competent to
deliver it or to have been obtained by fraud or collusion. Fraud or collusion
in obtaining probate has not been pleaded in the statement of claim. However,
in the plaintiff`s affidavit and the second defendant`s affidavit (where he
did a volte-face), fraud or collusion in the 1986 will was alleged.  
  
With the greatest of respect for **_Sarkar`s_** commentary, I am not prepared
to go so far as to say that the Hong Kong grant of probate made the 1986 will
unimpeachable in a Singapore court. I would have accepted that position if the
Hong Kong grant had been made after contested proceedings challenging the
validity of that will. As it turned out, the grant was made ex parte, the
plaintiff being a little too late to stop it. I would also have accepted that
the 1986 will was unimpeachable here if the proceedings here were for
resealing of the Hong Kong grant. That is because any resealing here is solely
dependent on the probate in Hong Kong and would fall if the probate there is
revoked. In our case, the first and third defendants are seeking a grant of
probate in Singapore and O 71 rr 9 to 13 of the Rules of Court would entitle
the Registrar hearing the petition to require evidence as to the due execution
of the will and other related matters. Accordingly, I called for affidavits to
be filed by the attesting witnesses to the 1986 will since the second
defendant had joined the plaintiff in impugning it.  
  
An affidavit was filed urgently by Raymond Lee, formerly an assistant
solicitor in Messrs Woo Kwan Lee & Lo of Hong Kong and now a partner in
another Hong Kong law firm. He confirmed the due execution of the 1986 will
before him and Sandy ST Yung and of the codicil before him and Betty Yip. He
also confirmed that he had used a shorter signature in the codicil for
convenience. Both Sandy and Betty were employees of Messrs Woo Kwan Lee & Lo
at the material time. He was not aware of where Betty was at present.  
  
Sandy Yung Sheung Tat, now a solicitor in the employ of the Sun Hung Kai Group
in Hong Kong, also filed an affidavit verifying the due execution of the 1986
will. Betty Yip could not be contacted.  
  
The plaintiff`s son, Shaon Lal Hiranand, also filed an affidavit in which he
described a meeting he had with the abovesaid Raymond Lee on 29 April 1999 in
the latter`s law office. That meeting began at about 3pm and lasted about 24
minutes. Shaon mentioned the deceased`s name to Raymond Lee and he said he did
not recall that name. He also showed him four pictures of the deceased ranging
from the 1980s to 1994 but after looking at them, the lawyer said he did not
recall meeting the deceased. Shaon continually asked him to try to remember
and suddenly, he said that he recalled having been asked to witness a will in
Mount Butler Road for an Indian gentleman some time ago and that he only
remembered that one instance clearly. He and a male colleague had gone to `a
house with a big gate and a big driveway`. He could not recall when this event
took place but stated that the male colleague was one Chow Han or something
that sounded like that name. He and that colleague witnessed and signed a will
on that occasion. Asked whether there was a codicil, he could not remember
such an event.  
  
Shaon then produced a copy of the 1986 will and asked Raymond Lee whether that
was his signature in that document. Raymond Lee hesitated and reluctantly said
that it appeared to be so. `When he reached the last page and realized that a
female had allegedly signed as the other witness, he became very nervous and
then quiet`. He then said he couldn`t remember and could not help him any
more. Shaon thanked him and he gave Shaon his business card (which was
exhibited).  
  
As Raymond Lee `had earlier offered his assistance`, Shaon went on to state,
Shaon arranged another meeting about seven to ten days later. Shaon went with
Dr E Srikumar, their family advisor. At this meeting, Raymond Lee was very
uncooperative. It was clear to him that Raymond Lee did not truly remember
signing and witnessing the 1986 will and the subsequent codicil. Raymond Lee
said that the testator`s signatures appeared different between the will and
the codicil, that he must have signed or his signatures would not be there and
that the signatures appeared to be his. He could not however confirm that the
signatures belonged to the testator and stated more than three times that he
could not recall the witnessing and signing of the 1986 will and the codicil.  
  
After that, Shaon tried to contact Sandy Yung for the same purpose but could
not reach her. He ended his affidavit by saying that his family (including the
second defendant here) had commenced an action in the Hong Kong High Court on
6 December 1999 seeking a declaration that the 1986 will is invalid and that
the grant of probate be revoked.  
  
I realize that by making the orders I did, I have enlarged the application
beyond merely answering the question of law in issue. Looking at how the
proceedings had evolved, I thought it appropriate and justifiable to go
further into the question of the 1986 will as that would affect the
consequential orders made by the learned assistant registrar. As the evidence
stood, I saw no reason to doubt the validity of the 1986 will. It should not
be surprising or alarming that a cold call to a solicitor asking him about
events that happened some 12 or 13 years ago should elicit such replies as
Raymond Lee was said to have given. To justify any suspicion that two
solicitors of Hong Kong were lying on affidavit and were implicated in any
fraud, I would require much more tangible evidence than a solicitor`s failure
to recall having been an attesting witness more than a decade ago or another
person`s perception of that solicitor`s reaction to questions. I would also
add that if the first and third defendants thought it fit to `organise`
another will, it seemed strange they did not have the presence of mind to have
that concocted will dated later than the 1988 will in order to avert any
issues such as those raised by the plaintiff and the second defendant here.  
  
I therefore affirmed the assistant registrar`s order on all counts save for
her determination on the second question of law. The proceedings having been
initiated by the plaintiff and the proof of the 1986 will having been
necessitated by her allegations, I was of the view that she should pay the
first and third defendants $10,000 costs in respect of this appeal. The second
defendant was not awarded any costs in view of the vacillations in his stand.  
  
On 7 December 1999, the plaintiff took out OS 1893/99 against the second
defendant for a declaration that he was bound by the trusts set out in the
1988 will, relying on the deed entered into by both of them on 28 May 1999.
This originating summons was heard at the conclusion of this appeal and did
not involve the first and third defendants in any way. The second defendant
consented to the orders sought in the originating summons and I granted a
consent order and ordered him to pay the plaintiff costs fixed at $2,000.  
  
**Outcome:**

Plaintiff`s appeal dismissed.
