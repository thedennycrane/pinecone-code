(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): On 25 November 1994, the
plaintiff, Ms Tan Shwu Leng (`Ms Tan`) was serving on board a Singapore
Airlines (`SIA`) flight from Singapore to Dhaka as a leading stewardess, when
a mid-air incident arose which caused her to suffer a fracture in her left
humerus. Due to this fracture she could not be certified fit to carry on her
duties as a leading stewardess. She had to be grounded and given other duties.  
  
On 3 November 1997 Ms Tan commenced Civil Suit 1906/97 against SIA claiming
damages for negligence, and in the alternative, for breach of statutory duty.
Later Airbus Industrie, the manufacturers of the aircraft, were joined as a
co-defendant. The defendants admitted liability and, on 19 November 1999,
interlocutory judgment was entered against them with damages to be assessed.  
  
An assessment was carried out by the assistant registrar who on 28 September
2000 awarded to Ms Tan the sum of $316,025.81 made up as follows:  
  

(1) | Pain and suffering | $ | 13,000.00  
---|---|---|---  
(2) | Pre-trial loss of earnings | $ | 77,491.60  
(3) | Loss of future earnings | $ | 225,534.21  
Total | $ | 316,025.81  
  
  
  
On this sum, the usual interest was also awarded in respect of the first two
items, making a grand total of $331,855.14.  
  
As this sum awarded was less than an offer of $350,000 which the defendants
made on 24 January 2000 to settle Ms Tan`s claim under O 22A of the Rules of
Court, the assistant registrar ordered that Ms Tan would only be entitled to
costs up to the date of the offer and Ms Tan would have to bear the costs of
the defendants on the indemnity basis incurred after the offer was made.  
  
Ms Tan appealed against the decision of the assistant registrar. Woo Bih Li JC
heard the appeal and he increased the award for loss of pre-trial earnings by
adding two sums, $2,736.31 (being excessive deduction for income tax) and
$14,700 (this will be elaborated later), back into the computation and those
two sums would bear interest at 3%p[thinsp]a from the date of the accident to
the date of the assessment of damages as the assistant registrar had ordered
in respect of pre-trial loss of earnings. In the light of these variations
made by the judge, the total award granted to Ms Tan, including interest,
amounted to $352,279.33.  
  
The offer made by the defendants was $350,000. Taking into account the
interest which this sum would have earned from the date of the offer up to the
date of the assessment by the assistant registrar, it would become
$351,809.82. As this sum was still less than the total sum of $352,279.33
awarded, Woo JC also altered the decision below on costs. The defendants were
ordered to pay Ms Tan`s costs up to the date of the offer. As for the costs
incurred after the offer, Woo JC fixed them at $1,000 payable by the
defendants to Ms Tan. As for the costs of the appeal before the High Court,
Woo JC also fixed it at $5,000, payable by the defendants to Ms Tan.  
  
Both Ms Tan and the defendants appealed against the decision of the High
Court. Ms Tan`s appeal was in respect of the pre-trial earnings and the loss
of future earnings as well as the costs, from the date of the offer to the
date of the assessment before the assistant registtrar, which was fixed at
$1,000. The defendants` appeal was in respect of the judge`s decision to
enhance the loss of pre-trial earnings by the sum $14,700 and his decision on
costs.  
  
At the conclusion of hearing the parties, we dismissed both the appeals. These
grounds are issued in respect of two issues, namely: (1) the defendants`
appeal against the High Court`s decision to enhance the loss of pre-trial
earnings by $14,700; and (2) the question of costs generally, as both these
issues raised some points of law.  
  
**_The increase by $14,700_**

****

The putting back of $2,736.31, being the excessive deduction for income tax,
was not challenged by the defendants before us. The challenge was only in
respect of the judge putting back the sum of $14,700 which the assistant
registrar deducted from what was assessed to be Ms Tan`s loss of pre-trial
earnings on account of Ms Tan`s failure to mitigate her loss from January 1999
to the date of assessment. The assistant registrar was of the view that once
the plaintiff learned that SIA would not put her back on flying duties then
she should have, after the Asian economic crisis had subsided in late 1998 and
early 1999, looked for an alternative non-cabin crew job.  
  
However, Woo JC disagreed with that decision and held that the plaintiff had
not acted unreasonably in failing to seek alternative employment in a
different industry when she was still employed by SIA and earning a decent
salary. Furthermore, there was insufficient evidence to show that the
plaintiff would have been likely to obtain alternative employment at a higher
salary. The determination of the figure of $700 per month was arrived at
without any basis. He therefore restored the sum of $14,700 back to the
plaintiff.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

On this appeal before us, the question that arose for consideration in regard
to the sum of $14,700 was in relation to the principles applicable to the
hearing of an appeal from an assessment made by the assistant registrar to the
High Court. This was raised by the first defendant, SIA. Was the hearing
before the High Court a hearing de novo? Was the High Court entitled to vary
the quantum awarded as it pleased or was it governed by the same principles
applicable to an appeal against an award made by the High Court to the Court
of Appeal, namely, that the appellate court could only vary the quantum of
damages awarded if it were shown that (1) the court below acted on wrong
principles, or (2) misapprehended the facts, or (3) had for these or other
reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages: see **Davies v Powell
Duffryn Associated Collieries** [1942] AC 601 per Lord Wright.  
  
The position taken by the first defendant was that the principles applicable
to an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal are similarly
applicable to an appeal from the Registrar to the High Court. The appellate
court, having not seen and heard the witnesses, should be slow to interfere
and must be satisfied that the court below was clearly wrong before it should
substitute its own decision for that of the court below.  
  
There is no doubt that the principles in **_Davies v Powell Duffryn_** (supra)
have been accepted and applied by this court in relation to appeals on damages
from the High Court to the Court of Appeal, eg **Chow Khai Hong v Tham Sek
Khow** [1992] 1 SLR 4 , **Lim Hwee Meng v Citadel Investment** [1998] 3 SLR
601  and **Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong** [1996] 2 SLR 305  at 310.  
  
What the defendants, however, sought to argue was that the **_Powell
Duffryn_** principles should also be applicable to an appeal on assessment
from the Registrar to the High Court. But in this connection there were two
authorities of this court which they had to overcome. The first was **Chang Ah
Lek v Lim Ah Koon** [1999] 1 SLR 82 , and the second **Ho Yeow Kim v Lai Hai
Kuen** [1999] 2 SLR 246 .  
  
Mr Lawrence Teh Kee Wee, counsel for the first defendants, went into a
detailed analysis of **_Chang Ah Lek_** (supra). He had to do it as this case
stared right at him. This was a case where the plaintiff was injured in a
motor accident. Liability was determined by the trial judge with assessment of
damages being carried out by the assistant registrar who awarded the
plaintiff, inter alia, $30,000 for general damages. On appeal, the High Court
judge increased the amount to $35,000. On the defendants` further appeal to
the Court of Appeal, one of the issues raised was that in enhancing the award
for general damages by $5,000, the judge had overlooked the principles in
**_Powell Duffryn_**.  
  
It is true, as contended by Mr Teh that this court in **_Chang Ah Lek_**
(supra) did, in fact, find that the assistant registrar had misapprehended the
facts and the law and had come to a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages
suffered, applying the **_Powell Duffryn_** principles. But the parties there
did argue that the High Court, on hearing such an appeal, was to apply the
same principles and, it was in response to this argument, that the court there
proceeded to examine the question and offered its opinion.  
  
The court first referred to s 62(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
(Cap 322) which provided that the Registrar shall have the same powers and
jurisdiction as the masters in England. Next, it referred to O 58 r 1 of the
English Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 (like our O 56 r 1 of the Rules of
Court) which provided that an appeal from the master laid to a judge-in-
chambers. It next cited para 58/1/2 of the **_Supreme Court Practice 1997_**
which stated that an appeal from the master to the judge-in-chambers was dealt
with by way of an actual rehearing of the application and the judge treated
the matter as though it came before him for the first time; while the judge
would give the weight the previous decision of the master deserved, he was in
no way fettered by the previous exercise of discretion by the master. On
appeal from the judge-in-chambers, the Court of Appeal would treat the
substantial discretion as that of the judge, not of the master.  
  
The court then examined the decision of the House of Lords in **Evans v
Bartlam** [1937] AC 473 where the House had to consider the question whether a
master`s exercise of discretion in refusing to set aside a judgment in default
of appearance and giving leave to defend could be supplanted by the discretion
of the judge-in-chambers to whom an appeal from the master lay. The judge-in-
chambers set aside the judgment and gave the defendant leave to defend on
terms. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, held that the judge could not
substitute his discretion in place of the master. The House reversed the Court
of Appeal when it held that the judge was entitled to do so. The following
passage of Lord Wright (at p 484), which was also quoted by this court with
approval, was pertinent:

> _The master had, in the exercise of his discretion under Order XXVII r 15,
> or Order XIII r 10, refused to set aside the judgment. But it is clear that
> where the Court of Appeal is required to review a discretionary order of a
> judge reversing the master the substantial discretion is that of the judge,
> and it is the judge`s order which must particularly be considered by the
> appellate court:**Cooper v Cooper** [1936] WN 205. The masters admirably
> exercise their discretion in routine matters of pleading, discovery,
> interrogatories, venue, mode of trial, and other interlocutory directions,
> without any appeal being necessary. But such matters may on occasion raise
> questions most vital to the final issue of the case. The decision of such
> questions is properly for the judge who will no doubt consider carefully the
> order of the master. If a further appeal is taken to the Court of Appeal it
> is the judge`s discretion which that court has either to support or vary or
> reverse._

  
  
The court then concluded:

> _
>
> 19 The same in our view applies to the assessment of damages. As Lord Wright
> said in his speech in **_Davies v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries
> Ltd_** which we have quoted in [para ]8 above, `the assessment of damages is
> more like an exercise of discretion than an ordinary act of decision`. It is
> for this reason that an appellate court is particularly slow to reverse the
> trial judge on a question of the assessment of damages.
>
> 20 But registrars are not trial judges as we have seen from the observations
> of Lord Atkin and Lord Wright in **_Evans v Bartlam_** nor do we think is an
> appeal from the registrar to a judge-in-chambers an appeal in the true sense
> as an appeal from the judge-in-chambers or a judge sitting in open court to
> the Court of Appeal is. As Lord Atkin said in **_Evans v Bartlam_** the
> judge-in-chambers deals with an appeal from the registrar `as though the
> matter came before him for the first time`.
>
> _

  
  
We should point out that in **_Davies v Powell Duffryn_** (supra), Lord
Wright`s pronouncement was that `an appellate court is always reluctant to
interfere with a finding **_of the trial judge_** on any question of fact, but
it is particularly reluctant to interfere with a finding on damages`.  
  
Essentially, two points were made by Mr Teh on **_Chang Ah Lek_** (supra). The
first was that the views of the court in **_Chang Ah Lek_** were obiter. We
did not agree with that. It was clear that what the court did was also to hold
the High Court judge was entitled to enhance the award from $30,000 to
$35,000, for the reason that the **_Powell Duffryn_** principles did not apply
to an appeal to the High Court against the assessment of an assistant
registrar. In any case, even if the views of the court on the point were
obiter and not ratio decidendi, they must be given the highest consideration.  
  
The second point was that the court in **_Chang Ah Lek_** failed to appreciate
that our O 56 r 1 was not entirely in pari materia with the English O 58 r 1
because r 1 expressly stated it was subject to r 2 and r 2 provided that as
far as assessment of damages was concerned, an appeal lay direct from the
master to the Court of Appeal, by-passing the High Court. So in England an
appeal against an assessment of damages made by the master was to be heard by
the Court of Appeal and not by a High Court judge. The Court of Appeal in
England, when hearing such an appeal on assessment, would apply the **_Powell
Duffryn_** principles. Therefore, on an appeal against the Registrar/assistant
registrar`s decision on assessment, the judge-in-chambers should also have
applied the same principles.  
  
Ordinarily, in England, on a matter of discretion when an appeal lay to the
High Court, the latter was entitled to examine and decide the case without
being affected by the decision of the master, but of course, the judge would
no doubt give due weight to the decision of the master. Order 58 r 2 of the
English Rules of the Supreme Court provided for an exception in respect of an
appeal from a master`s decision on assessment of damages which would go direct
to the Court of Appeal. Our Rules did not provide for such an exception and
therefore all appeals from the Registrar would first go to the judge-in-
chambers and there was no reason why the ordinary manner in which the judge
would carry out his function in this regard should be any different just
because the appeal was on a question of quantum of damages. Therefore, in
considering the English practice, we must bear in mind their special rule,
which was not present in our Rules of Court.  
  
The principles which were enunciated in **_Chang Ah Lek_** were reviewed and
affirmed by this court in the subsequent case of **Ho Yeow Kim v Lai Hai
Kuen** [1999] 2 SLR 246 .  
  
In the result, we held that Woo JC was entitled to enhance the quantum of loss
of pre-trial earnings by $14,700.  
  
**_Application of Powell Duffryn principles_**

****

Furthermore, we would add that, even if we were to apply the **_Powell
Duffryn_** principles to this case, the circumstances here warranted the
interference, as we were satisfied that the assistant registrar had erred on a
matter of law and had also failed to appreciate the facts. It is necessary
that we now set out how the assistant registrar viewed the question and why
she thought the deduction for failure to mitigate was justified:

> _I was of the view that the plaintiff did not act unreasonably in not
> seeking alternative employment immediately after the first defendants
> informed her in February 1997 that she was unfit to work on board flights,
> given the uncertain economic climate then and the financial crisis which was
> soon to hit the Southeast Asian region. Even after economic conditions
> improved in late 1998/early 1999, the plaintiff could not be faulted for
> failing to seek employment with other airlines as the residual weakness in
> her left hand made it highly unlikely that she would be able to secure any
> other cabin crew position. The plaintiff should, however, have tried to look
> for an alternative**non-cabin crew** job from that time onwards. Given the
> plaintiff`s good service record with the first defendants, attractive
> personality, and commendable grades in the Malaysian equivalent of the GCE
> `O` and `A` levels, I was of the view that she could have obtained non-cabin
> crew employment, for instance as a secretary, which would have ameliorated
> the loss in allowances which she suffered after she was taken off cabin crew
> duties. To reflect this failure to mitigate her loss, a deduction of $700
> per month for the period from January 1999 onwards - ie a total of $14,700
> ($700 x 21 months) - ought to be made from the lost earnings to be awarded
> to the plaintiff. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
What we could not understand was, why should Ms Tan be required to look for an
alternative non-cabin crew job when she was already in a non-cabin crew job
with SIA as a grounded leading stewardess. If an employer of the size of SIA,
and who no doubt had a wide range of jobs available, and who also were in
possession of her qualifications and work experience, could not offer her any
other job, we did not think it reasonable to infer that another company or
individual would have offered her a job which was better than what she was
given by SIA and would even pay her as much as $700 more per month. There was
simply no evidence of that. The suggestion made was that she could be a
secretary. Then why did SIA not engage her as a secretary and instead only
offered her a position as a grounded hostess? After all, SIA knew her better.
Her previous job was with Public Bank Malaysia, as a clerk. There was no
evidence that a clerk would be paid more than what SIA was paying her as a
grounded leading hostess.  
  
It was thus understandable that Ms Tan did not make any effort to look for
alternative employment. It was not as if she was out of employment. If she
were, then she would have failed in her duty to obtain a suitable job to
mitigate her loss. Here, her own employer, who was liable for her injury, had
offered her alternative employment. It must be assumed that that was the best
SIA could offer her.  
  
Counsel for SIA, while conceding it was difficult to assess the quantum of
damages which could have been reduced if Ms Tan had not failed to mitigate,
argued that in a situation such as this, the court should apply the principle
in **Chaplin v Hicks** [1911] 2 KB 786. This was what Assistant Registrar Tan
did in arriving at the figure of $700 per month. But, in our opinion, the
situations were hardly similar. **_Chaplin v Hicks_** was a case concerning
breach of contract where a candidate in a beauty competition, who had
successfully passed the earlier stages of the competition, was, in breach of
contract, not allowed by the organisers to compete in the later stages.
Notwithstanding that it was difficult to assess damages, substantial damages
were awarded to the candidate for the loss of the chance of being successful.  
  
But the position here was quite different. It is settled law that the onus of
proof on the issue of failure to mitigate is on the defendant: see the
decision of this Court in **Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat** [1994] 1 SLR 634
and **McGregor on Damages** [1997] at p 190. Evidence should have been led by
the defendants on alternative employment the plaintiff could apply for and
which could have paid her more. There was simply no evidence on these. This
was not a question of assessment. It was a question of discharging the burden
of substantiating the allegation of failure to mitigate and the defendants had
failed to discharge that burden.  
  
**_Costs_**

****

We now turn to the question of costs. In the light of the decision of Woo JC,
and as the amount of the offer made by the defendants was less than the total
amount awarded on appeal by the High Court, there could be no question of O
22A r 9(3) coming into play as that rule applied only when the judgment
obtained by the plaintiff was not more favourable than the terms of the offer.
Here, the judgment obtained by Ms Tan was more favourable, though only
slightly. Therefore, we would agree with the judge below that once it was
shown that the offer was less than the judgment sum no matter how slightly, O
22A r 9(3) did not apply. Otherwise, there would be great difficulties in
drawing any line: what was slight and what was not so slight?  
  
Mr Teh had sought to rely upon **Roache v News Group Newspapers** (Unreported)
, where the plaintiff, in a libel action, was awarded the same sum as damages
as that which was paid into court by the defendants. The plaintiff also
obtained an injunction against re-publication. The English Court of Appeal
held that, in the circumstances, it was the defendants who were, in substance,
the successful party. Sir Thomas Bingam MR put the position as follows:

> _The defendants did not wish to fight this action. If they had wished to do
> so they would not have paid o50,000 into court. Plainly they wished to
> settle if they could do so at an acceptable cost. Given that wish, it is in
> my view incredible that they would have allowed a settlement to founder for
> want of an undertaking by them not to republish. No reason has been
> suggested why they should have acted in such an uncommercial way, I do not
> accept the judge`s view that "the plaintiff had to pursue the matter to
> judgment in order to obtain an injunction". The overwhelming probability is,
> in my view, that if he had chosen to accept the money in court he could have
> had an undertaking, equivalent in effect to an injunction, for the asking.
> That he chose to go ahead can only, in my view, have been because he wanted
> to win a large sum from the jury than the defendants had offered. There can
> in my view be no doubt that the defendants emerged from this trial as the
> substantial winners: they had held the award to a sum no greater than was
> already on offer. The injunction was a matter of no significance to them
> because they did not intend to republish anyway._

  
  
We do not disagree with that reasoning. But it would be seen that the
situation in **_Roache_** is quite different from that in the present case.
There, the plaintiff got the same sum as that paid into court by the
defendants. The fact that the plaintiff was also granted an injunction was not
treated as a matter of any great moment, as it was not really a point of
contention.  
  
We would, of course, hasten to add that this is not the end of the matter.
There is still O 22A r 12 to consider.  
  
It would be noted that Woo JC granted Ms Tan only $1,000 as costs, for work
done after the offer, including the assessment before the assistant registrar.
It seemed to us clear that the judge had only granted her nominal costs. In Ms
Tan`s appeal she had contended that as the judgment she obtained was more
favourable than the offer, which rendered inapplicable O 22A r 9(3), she
should be entitled to the full costs of the assessment on the standard basis,
instead of only a sum of $1,000.  
  
At this juncture we would set out O 22A r 12:

> _Without prejudice to Rules 9 and 10, the Court, in exercising its
> discretion with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle,
> the date the offer was made, the terms of the offer and the extent to which
> the plaintiff`s judgment is more favourable than the terms of the offer to
> settle._

  
  
It will be seen that r 12 tempers the rigours of r 9 and gives the court a
wide discretion to do justice as between the parties even in a case where the
offer is less than the sum awarded in the judgment. Here, the judge, in
deciding to grant Ms Tan only $1,000 costs, took into account all the
circumstances, including the fact that the difference between the offer and
the judgment was marginal, that she had some six months to consider the offer,
and that her claim of $1.1m was manifestly excessive, about $750,000 more than
what she was awarded by the court.  
  
In our opinion, the judge was entitled to take all the circumstances into
consideration in awarding the plaintiff only nominal costs in respect of costs
incurred after the offer was made. It must be emphasised that the whole object
of O 22A is to spur the parties to bring litigation to an expeditious end
without judgment, and thus to save costs and judicial time. In the words of
Morden ACJO in the Ontario Court of Appeal case, **Data General (Canada) v
Molnar Systems Group** [1991] 85 DLR (4th) 392 at 398:

> _The purpose of r 49 [in pari materia with our O 22A] is to encourage the
> termination of litigation by agreement of the parties - more speedily and
> less expensively than by judgment of the court at the end of the trial._

  
  
The scheme of things under O 22A is verily to encourage the plaintiffs to be
realistic in their assessment of what they are entitled to and on the part of
the defendants, to make reasonable offers, on pain of having to bear the costs
on the indemnity basis if they should persist in their exaggerated claims or
maintain their unreasonable position (in respect of an offer from the
plaintiff). The order seeks to promote responsible conduct on the part of both
parties. It discourages obstinacy. The wide discretion given to the court in r
12 is to enable the court to take all pertinent facts and circumstances into
account and arrive at an order on costs which is fair and just. In the present
case, the excessively high claim of Ms Tan had no doubt caused the assessment
proceedings to run into some 4[half ] days. The judge below had taken all the
pertinent factors into consideration. It was not shown that he had erred on
any matter of principle. Thus, we could see no reason to interfere in the
exercise of his discretion.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeals dismissed.
