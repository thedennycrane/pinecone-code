General Division of the High Court (Family Division) — Divorce Transferred No
1331 of 2022  
Choo Han Teck J  
11 October 2023

24 November 2023 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff (the “Wife”), aged 46, worked as a regional talent and
workforce planning manager until 1 April 2023. The defendant (the “Husband”),
aged 46, is a director in his own company ECM Pte Ltd. ECM Pte Ltd is the
latest of several companies that he had started and closed. The parties
married on 29 November 2008 and have two daughters to the marriage (the
“Children”), aged nine and six. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 30
March 2022. Interim judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 19 October 2022. The
custody issues were settled in the consent order dated 11 November 2022. The
remaining ancillary matters concern the division of matrimonial assets, and
maintenance for the Children.

Division of matrimonial assets

2 Although counsel for both sides disagreed as to whether this was a dual-
income marriage, the answer is moot because they agree on the principles to be
applied for the division of assets. The date for ascertaining the matrimonial
assets is to be IJ date (19 October 2022), and the assets are to be valued at
the date of the ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing (11 October 2023), or at the
closest available date. Bank accounts and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”)
account balances are to be valued at IJ date.

3 I shall first deal with the valuation of matrimonial assets which are
undisputed, and those with minor differences:

S/N| Asset| Wife’s Case| Husband’s Case| Court’s Decision  
---|---|---|---|---  
Assets that are jointly held by Wife and Husband  
1| POSB Passbook Savings account xxx-xxx02-1| -| $0| $0  
2| Children’s POSBkids accounts| -| $25,322.48 (as at 9 Feb 2023)| $25,322.48  
Wife’s assets  
3| CPF accounts| $406,361  
(as at 14 Jul 2022)| $429,289.82 (as at 28 Jan 2023)| $417,825.41  
4| Bank accounts | $134,699| $144,111.34| $12,959.81 + $93,295 + $2,173 + $3,773.63 + $28,643.70 + $1 = $140,846.14  
5| Investments| $334,056| $333,225.05| $18,311 + $184,466 + $64,360.53 +
$37,218 + $29,285 = $333,640.53  
6| POSB Child Devt accounts| -| $12,936.46| $12,936.46  
7| Outstanding mortgage loan| -$1,669,203| -| $0 (Already accounted for under
joint assets below)  
8| Other loans| -$22,022| -$22,022| -$22,022  
Husband’s assets  
9| CPF accounts | $35,238| $35,238.78| $35,238.78  
10| Investments| $13,068.00  
(as at 29 Nov 2022)| $13,112.75 (as at 31 Jan 2023)| $13,068  
11| Bank accounts| $21,882.00  
(as at 12 Dec 2022)| $16,360.33 (as at 31 Jan 2023)| $21,882  
Total| $978,737.80  
  
4 The parties only dispute the date of the valuation of the assets. I accept
those valuations that are closest to the IJ date. For the Wife’s CPF accounts,
since the Wife’s valuation is just three months prior to the IJ date, and the
Husband’s is about three months after IJ date, I will apply the median. There
are minor differences due to rounding and exchange rates. For the former,
these are nominal differences and I accept the more exact figures. For the
latter, I take average of the two values. As for the joint bank accounts with
the Children, since they are jointly held by at least one party, these
accounts have to be included in the matrimonial assets as well, unless parties
agree otherwise.

5 Next, my decision regarding the rest of the matrimonial assets is as
follows:

S/N| Asset| Wife’s  
Case| Husband’s Case| Court’s Decision  
---|---|---|---|---  
Assets that are jointly held by Wife and Husband  
1| Matrimonial home at xx BT (“BT”)| $5,200,000| $5,500,000| $5,200,000  
2| Outstanding loan  
(mortgage for matrimonial home)| -$1,669,203| -$1,652,304.17 (as at 7 Jan
2023)| -$1,652,304.17 + $72,289 + $13,500 (estimated cash and CPF component
paid in 2023) = -$1,566,515.17 (Estimate of mortgage outstanding as of AM
date)  
Wife’s assets  
3| Jewelry and watches| -| $43,650| $35,350 (Excluding certain items which are
not matrimonial assets)  
4| Refund of sums Wife paid for mortgage of BT | Refund all sums paid by Wife for mortgage repayments from Jan 2022 (when Wife left matrimonial home) to date of division| Operative date to value matrimonial assets is IJ date | -$7,948 – $25,119 – $77,416 = -$110,483 (Refund all sums Wife paid for mortgage of BT after IJ date)  
5| Severance package Wife received from retrenchment| -| Severance package
Wife received would be relevant to the determination of matrimonial assets| $0
(Not a matrimonial asset even if severance package exists)  
Husband’s assets  
6| Personal loan from Husband’s father| No such loan| -$30,000| -$30,000
(Evidence supports the existence of this loan)  
7| Personal loan from Husband’s aunt| No such loan| -$100,000| $0 (Legal fees
not claimable from matrimonial assets. Evidence goes against Husband’s claims
here.)  
8| Unrealised loss from Philip Securities| -| -$16,165.18| $0 (New asset
obtained by Husband after IJ date. Losses are his to bear alone.)  
Total| $3,528,351.83  
  
6 The main asset in dispute between parties is the matrimonial home, BT. I
accept the Wife’s valuation since it is backed up by a valuation report from a
licensed appraiser. In comparison, the Husband’s valuation is from a website,
SRX, and it is unclear to me how reliable this website is. There is an
outstanding mortgage to consider. The mortgage as of 7 January 2023, according
to the documents provided by the Husband, is $1,652,304.17. This needs to be
adjusted to account for further payments by the Wife, namely, $85,789. This is
based on the mortgage and payment statements available. At the date of the AM
hearing, the outstanding mortgage is about $1,566,515.17.

7 The Wife wants a refund of what she paid towards the mortgage from January
2022 (after she had left the matrimonial home) to the date of the AM hearing.
There is no legal basis for such an order. The default operative date for
determining matrimonial assets is the IJ date. There is neither evidence nor
law to justify the date of separation by the Wife (in December 2021) as the
operative date. The Wife’s claim is based on the notion that the marriage had
for all intents and purposes been terminated when she had left the matrimonial
home in December 2021 with the Children. Thus, they no longer intended to
accumulate matrimonial assets together. Although this may be true in
exceptional cases, the parties must show that they had “put an end to the
marriage contract” and “no longer intend to participate in the joint
accumulation of matrimonial assets” (WOS v WOT [2023] SGHCF 36 at [3] citing
ARY v ARX and another appeal [2016] 2 SLR 686 at [32]).

8 The Wife has only shown that she left the matrimonial home, but has not
produced any evidence to show that the indicia of termination were present as
at the time she left the matrimonial home in December 2021. Accordingly, it is
my view that the operative date for determining the matrimonial assets remains
the IJ date. In any event, it is not inequitable for the Wife’s further
payments to the outstanding mortgage up to IJ date to be counted towards the
matrimonial assets because the money, if not paid by the Wife towards the
mortgage repayments, remains as her matrimonial assets at IJ date. Payments by
her after IJ date should be refunded to her. They were payments towards the
reduction of their joint liabilities. Based on the mortgage and payment
statements, I assess the refunds to the Wife at $110,483.

9 The Wife submitted a list of her watches and jewellery, with details of the
dates of purchase and cost. Excluding pre-wedding gifts such as her engagement
ring and wedding ring, and items bought after the IJ date, the value of the
Wife’s valuables to be included in the matrimonial assets is $35,350. The
severance package the Wife received after being retrenched (from 1 April
2023), long after IJ date is not part of matrimonial assets.

10 The Husband’s disputed assets relate to loans he claims his father and aunt
had given him, and unrealised losses from a Philips Security stock portfolio.
The Husband has provided evidence of the cheques amounting to $30,000
corresponding to the renovation loans his father advanced to him. The Wife
acknowledges that the Husband had indeed made a payment of $15,000 towards the
renovation of BT. As such, I allow his claim. I disallow the Husband’s claim
to deduct the $100,000 loan from his aunt. There is evidence of a bank
transfer of $100,000 from his aunt (on 17 October 2022 which he says was used
“towards paying for [his] current expenses, expenses for [the Children] and
legal fees for the current proceedings”. But it contradicts his claim that
“since December 2022, [he had] also begun paying a monthly maintenance of
S$500 for the Children”. His lawyer’s letter to the Wife (dated 5 December
2022) suggests that before December 2022, he had not contributed to the
Children’s expenses. Legal fees of matrimonial proceedings should be borne by
parties out of their own share of the matrimonial assets after division and
not from the matrimonial assets. The alleged expenditure of $100,000 on
personal expenses is not proved. These factors strongly militate against the
Husband’s claim. The Husband’s claim of unrealised losses from a Philips
Security stock portfolio of $16,165.18 has no merit. Based on the transaction
history of the Philips Security stock portfolio disclosed in the Husband’s
first affidavit of assets and means (dated 12 December 2022), $27,204.42 was
only deposited into the account after IJ date (deposited on 27 October 2022).
Before that, the account had nominal value. Therefore, this is an asset
obtained by the Husband after IJ date. Any gains or losses associated with
this stock portfolio are his alone to bear.

11 In summary, the overall value of the matrimonial assets are as follows:

Subtotal for assets under Wife’s name| Subtotal for assets under Husband’s
name| Subtotal for joint assets  
---|---|---  
$808,093.54| $40,188.78| $3,658,807.31  
Total: $4,507,089.63  
  
12 The parties dispute their direct financial contributions to the joint
assets, the bulk of which comprise BT. The Wife says that she contributed
$1,358,376 and the Husband, $38,560, to BT. The Husband says that he has
contributed $103,560 compared to the Wife’s $1,298,441.78. The differences
arose from disagreement as to mortgage payments and renovation expenses, and
also the valuation date for direct financial contributions towards BT.

13 With respect to the former, I agree with the Wife that there is no evidence
of the Husband having contributed $35,000 towards the mortgage payments of BT.
The Husband only adduces as evidence a bank statement showing numerous fund
transfers, of which, he claims, one of the transfers on 10 November 2017 was a
payment to their joint account for the express purpose of mortgage repayment.
The bank statement and the fund transfer on 10 November 2017 are ambiguous,
and there is no corroborative evidence to support the Husband’s claim. I
reject his claim.

14 In relation to the payments towards renovation for BT, both the Wife and
the Husband claimed to have contributed similar amounts of money ($35,824 and
$30,000 respectively). However, unlike the Husband, who barely provided any
evidence to support his claims (only a cheque to a contractor for $15,000 and
an invoice of $3,430.42 for kitchen furniture), the Wife has a comprehensive
compilation of receipts, invoices and bank statements in support. Although the
Husband may be correct in saying that the Wife’s claim for renovation expenses
should be reduced to exclude payments for furniture, in my view, the Husband
too has not established that the sums he expended were not used for furnishing
BT — much less that he had spent $30,000 on renovations in total. In fact, the
sole invoice he submitted is for kitchen furniture. Given the circumstances, I
am of the view that it would not be fair to reduce the Wife’s contributions
towards the renovation expenses that were used to purchase furniture. I allow
the Wife’s claim for $35,824 and the Husband’s claim for $18,430.42 (based on
the available evidence) in relation to renovation expenses.

15 As for the valuation date of the direct financial contributions towards BT,
I agree with the Husband and assess this figure as at IJ date, or the date
closest to IJ date. I had (at [8] above) added back the sum of $110,483 for
payments by the Wife towards the outstanding mortgage for BT after IJ date.
Using a later date after IJ would effectively be double counting in favour of
the Wife. Altogether, I assess the Wife to have contributed $1,319,723.70 and
the Husband to have contributed $56,990.42 towards BT. Given that BT has
increased in value since purchase, I use the net value of BT of $3,633,484.83
(after subtracting the outstanding mortgage of $1,566,515.17 from the value of
BT at $5,200,000), and adjust the parties’ direct contributions to BT
proportionately, to arrive at the adjusted direct contributions of the Wife
($3,483,073.19) and Husband ($150,411.64) towards BT.

16 The direct contributions of parties towards the matrimonial assets are thus
as follows:

Asset| Wife’s direct contributions| Husband’s direct contributions  
---|---|---  
Net value of matrimonial home| $3,483,073.19| $150,411.64  
Rest of joint assets| $12,661.24| $12,661.24  
Rest of Wife’s assets| $808,093.54| $0  
Rest of Husband’s assets| $0| $40,188.78  
Total:| $4,303,827.97| $203,261.66  
Ratio:| 95| 5  
  
17 As for the indirect contributions ratio, parties provide different
descriptions about each other’s role in the marriage. The Wife says that the
ratio should be 90:10 in her favour. The Wife says that she bore the burden of
most of the family expenses (including the Husband’s expenses). She was the
primary caregiver for the Children, she had managed BT, and the household. The
Wife says that the Husband’s contributions were minimal. He would be out
“drinking and partying on the pretext of networking for business”. The Husband
disagrees and says that the ratio should be 70:30 in his favour. He claims to
have contributed significantly to the family expenses and made significant
non-financial efforts to acquire the matrimonial home. He was running the
household and supporting the Wife so that she could focus on her work. He says
that he was the primary caregiver of the Children since they were born. The
Wife relied entirely on him “to carry out the caregiving duties, manage the
household, oversee the helper, purchase the groceries, and send the children
to and from their respective enrichment classes, school and other
obligations”.

18 I do not accept the Husband’s account of his indirect contributions to the
marriage. There is insufficient evidence to support his claims. Moreover, his
claims are inconsistent with the facts and contradicted by the evidence.
First, he has always been running his own businesses throughout the marriage.
Shortly after the youngest child was born on 5 October 2017, he incorporated
three new ventures in the same month, two of which has since closed. One
venture related to investments, another related to a joint venture with a Hong
Kong stock brokerage owner, and the last related to a technology startup for
queue management services for hospitals. The Wife’s version is a more credible
fit to the narrative.

19 Second, the Husband’s claim that he contributed significantly to the
financial aspects of indirect contributions to the marriage is not credible.
He started five ventures since the start of the marriage, four have failed,
and it does not appear that any of those ventures had ever generated any
material income for the Husband. He also concedes that the current remaining
venture is “not generating any profits” and that he is “not earning any fixed
income from my businesses”. And even if he had some income, which is unclear
on the evidence, he has not shown evidence that he expended money for family
expenses. On the other hand, the Wife has adduced bank statements supporting
her expenditure of routine expenses of marriage, and some of the Husband’s
expenses as well. In fact, after she had moved out of the matrimonial home
with the Children, the WhatsApp messages adduced by the Wife shows that the
Husband continued to ask her to pay for his expenses. It is undisputed that
the Wife had a stable job and income throughout the marriage, and that she was
responsible for paying for much of the family expenses. I therefore accept
that the Wife had borne the bulk of the family expenses.

20 Contributions the Husband made to the matrimonial home (such as renovation
expenses) stemming from money loaned to the Husband by others (e.g. his
father) do not count towards indirect contributions because they have been
accounted for in determining the matrimonial assets. The Husband’s claim as
the main person bearing the expenses of BT from August 2022 onwards, is
exaggerated. After the Wife and the Children had moved out of the matrimonial
home (in December 2021), the maintenance of BT, and the payment of the utility
bills and other household expenses were for himself, and not that of the
family, as he was the only one there.

21 Third, from the WhatsApp messages of both the Wife’s group chat with her
parents, and the group chat with her family and the Husband, it is clear that
the Husband was not the primary caregiver of the Children. The grandparents
(Wife’s parents) were more involved with the day-to-day care of the Children,
often at the last minute when the Husband is unavailable. I am of the view
that the WhatsApp messages in the various chats show that the grandparents
played a greater role than the Husband in taking care of the Children.

22 Fourth, the Husband was away on long overseas holidays during the period
between September 2021 and March 2022 by himself. His travels were funded
partly by the Wife. The Wife had confronted him on in contemporaneous WhatsApp
messages that he had stolen money from her for his travels.

23 Fifth, the Husband wrote to the ministry of education (“MOE”) to object to
the Wife’s enrolment of their younger daughter in a primary school that her
older sister is currently studying in, and is near to where the Wife currently
lives with the Children. The Husband insisted on sending the younger daughter
to another primary school for unmeritorious reasons, such as sending her to a
school near BT despite knowing that BT had to be sold. Even after the Wife
pleaded with him on many occasions to withdraw his objection, he refused. He
used the power of his veto to vent his past frustrations at the Wife, and to
pressure her into agreeing to certain terms such as “getting your lawyer to
write to [the court] to agree on alternate week access”. In my view, this
episode reveals who was the primary caregiver of the Children.

24 I reject the Husband’s account of having contributed significantly in
financial and non-financial ways as indirect contributions to the marriage, to
the extent that he would receive a majority of the indirect contributions of
the marriage. In my view, the Wife had contributed most if not all of the
family expenses during the marriage. She was, and still is, the primary
caregiver of the Children since birth. She had been highly involved with
running and managing the matrimonial home, until she moved out in December
2021. This was all done whilst she was holding down a full-time job and
earning a substantial income to support the family. Nonetheless, I am unable
to accept the Wife’s proposed indirect contributions ratio of 90:10. It cannot
be disputed that the Husband had spent time (little as it may be) with the
Children. He had helped out with some of the management of the household and
the matrimonial property. As such, I am of the view that an indirect
contributions ratio of 75:25 in favour of the Wife is more appropriate in the
present case. Given the direct contributions ratio of 95:5 in favour of the
Wife and the indirect contributions ratio of 75:25 in favour of the Wife, the
overall division ratio is 85:15 in favour of the Wife. The Wife is thus
entitled to $3,831,026.19 and the Husband to $676,063.44 as their share of the
matrimonial assets.

Maintenance for Children

25 I deal first with the quantum of expenses for the Children, which are as
follows:

S/No.| Expense| Amount  
---|---|---  
Expenses for older daughter  
1| School fees| $6.50  
2| Books and stationery/subscriptions| $100  
3| Vitamins| $50  
4| Food| $200  
5| Toiletries| $10  
6| Clothes/haircut/shoes/uniform| $83  
7| Transport/school bus/private car| $250  
8| Insurance/medical/therapy| $1310  
9| Holiday programs| $250  
10| School pocket money| $37.50  
11| Extra classes| $750  
12| Entertainment/parties/festivities| $100  
| Total| $3,147  
Expenses for younger daughter  
13| School fees| $545.70  
14| Books and stationery/subscriptions| $37.50  
15| Vitamins| $50  
16| Food| $200  
17| Toiletries| $10  
18| Clothes/haircut| $83  
19| Transport/school bus/private car| $200  
20| Insurance/Medical therapy| $1,310  
21| Holiday Programs| $83  
22| Extra classes| $1,012  
23| Entertainment/parties/festivities| $100  
| Total:| $3,631  
  
26 In relation to the Children’s expenses claimed by the Wife, I accept
generally the figures that the Wife has put forward but adjust them downwards
slightly as some of the figures seem excessive. The school fees of the younger
daughter, who is entering primary school in January 2024 cannot be $545.70. In
this connection, it must be remembered that the Wife has not made a separate
claim for household expenses, the cost of which would be divided equally
between her and her two children. I do not accept the Husband’s objections to
the Children’s expenses, which mainly concern the Children’s activities like
tuition, ballet and music classes. All the Wife has to show is that the
expenses for such extra activities are reasonable, and not that the Husband
has agreed to them. Although the Husband is not responsible for luxuries the
Wife wants for the Children, the activities she has listed are reasonable. I
am of the view that $6,000 per month in total is reasonable.

27 The next issue is the Children’s maintenance. The Wife wants the Husband to
pay $1,000 per month for each child, while the Husband says that the
Children’s maintenance should be $500 per month in total. The Wife was
retrenched earlier this year and is currently unemployed, and the Husband’s
entrepreneurial efforts have yet to succeed and bear fruit. Counsel for the
Husband submits that notwithstanding the Wife’s unemployment, the Wife’s
earning capacity should be considered in the determination of any
apportionment exercise. Since the Wife had a high earning capacity in the
past, as compared to the Husband’s current meagre earnings from his
entrepreneurial efforts, counsel submits that the Wife should be responsible
for the bulk of Children’s maintenance, with the Husband only being
responsible for $500 per month for both Children.

28 Counsel is partially correct. Both parties’ earning capacities need to be
taken in account, not just the Wife’s. In my view, it is inequitable for the
Husband to use his continued unsuccessful entrepreneurial efforts as a reason
to be responsible for a smaller share of the Children’s maintenance. The
Husband is not a homemaker who cannot find full-time employment if he tries
harder. Prior to his failed ventures, he was a private banking director, and
last earned $5,500 per month in 2009. The Husband’s ability to contribute to
the Children’s maintenance must be measured against his earning capacity if he
were to find full-time employment, just as counsel is asking for me to do with
the Wife. There cannot be double standards where the Wife is expected to leave
her state of unemployment now to find full-time employment, while the Husband
is allowed to continue his unsuccessful entrepreneurial efforts (of more than
a decade) and not find full-time employment — this is similar to unemployment.
I am thus of the view that the Wife’s claim of $1,000 a month in maintenance
for each child, for a total of $2,000 a month in Children’s maintenance is
reasonable. She still bears the significantly greater burden of $4,000 a
month, and any extra expenses that may come along in the Children’s daily
lives. The maintenance for the Children is backdated to IJ date, save that the
small sums of maintenance the Husband has occasionally paid to the Wife in
goodwill have to be subtracted from the backdated maintenance payments.

29 Finally, there is some disagreement over the conduct of the sale of BT.
Given the acrimonious relationship between parties, considering that the Wife
has been and continues to be responsible for paying the substantial monthly
mortgage payments towards BT since being unemployed in April 2023, and because
the Wife has the main share of the matrimonial assets, I am of the view that
the Wife should have sole conduct of the sale of BT. She is to complete the
sale of BT within nine months and the costs of the sale are to be borne by
parties equally.

30 Each party is to bear its own costs.
