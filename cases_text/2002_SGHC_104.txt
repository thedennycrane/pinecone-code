**Judgment** __ _** Cur Adv Vult ** _

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1 The Plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore. The Defendants are
the national association for cricket in Sri Lanka constituted pursuant to the
Sri Lankan Sports Law No. 25 of 1973. The legal personality of the Defendants
was initially the subject of some dispute. The Defendants had alleged that
they were not a body corporate and did not have the capacity to be sued.
However they eventually withdrew this preliminary objection on a without
prejudice basis and that question is no longer in issue before me.

2 On 29 October 2001, on the Plaintiffs _ex parte_ application under s 12(6)
of the International Arbitration Act ("the Act"), I made a number of interim
orders of which the first two were the substantial ones. These are,
respectively, a prohibitive injunction restraining the Defendants from dealing
with the subject matter of the dispute with any third party, and an anti-suit
injunction restraining the Defendants from proceeding with an action they had
commenced in the High Court of the Western Province of Holden in Colombo, Sri
Lanka ("the Colombo High Court"), until further order. The terms of these
orders are as follows:

> 1\. The Defendant, whether by its officers, servants, agents or any of them
> or otherwise howsoever, be restrained forthwith from entering into any
> contract, arrangement or commitment with any third party to deal with any of
> the commercial rights which form the subject matter of the Master Rights
> Agreement dated 3 December 2000 made between the Plaintiff and the Defendant
> as amended by the Terms of Settlement dated 5 February 2001 made between the
> Plaintiff and the Defendant, pending further order by this Court;
>
> 2\. The Defendant, whether by its officers, servants, agents or any of them
> or otherwise howsoever, be restrained forthwith from proceeding with the
> action brought by it against the Plaintiff in Sri Lanka in the High Court of
> the Western Province of Holden in Colombo under High Court (Civil) Case No.
> 246 / 2001, pending further order by this Court;

3 On 22 January 2002 the Defendants took out this summons, _iner alia_ , to
discharge those injunctions. Before embarking on the grounds for the
application, I should set out the background facts.

**

Background

**

4 On 3 December 2000 the parties entered into an agreement, called the "Master
Rights Agreement" ("MRA"), under which the Plaintiffs obtained the commercial
rights (including broadcasting and transmission rights outside Sri Lanka) to
cricket matches between the Sri Lankan national cricket team and visiting test
playing sides for 14 tours in the period January 2001 to December 2003. Clause
19 of the MRA provides for English law to be the governing law and makes a
reference to arbitration in Singapore in accord with the Arbitration Rules of
the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC"). Whether this clause
is an arbitration agreement within the meaning of the Act is a matter of
considerable dispute between the parties and I shall return to this issue
later.

5 Differences soon arose between the parties in respect of payments to be made
by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants. On 29 January 2001, the Defendants
commenced proceedings against the Plaintiffs in the Colombo High Court by way
of Plaint No. HC (Civil) 20/2001(1) ("the First Action"). The following day,
30 January 2001, the Defendants applied _ex parte_ for and obtained an interim
injunction restraining the Plaintiffs _"from interfering with and/or
obstructing the right of the Defendants to enter into contractual and/or other
arrangements of whatsoever nature . . . to secure and promote the Defendants
right in respect of the International Cricket Matches to be played in Sri
Lanka during the period January 2001 to December 2003 until the application
for Interim Injunction is heard and determined"_ , such injunction to be
operative until 13 February 2001.

6 On 2 February 2001 the Plaintiffs filed a motion to have the First Action
dismissed pursuant to s 5 of the Arbitration Act No 11 of 1995 ("the Sri
Lankan Arbitration Act"). Simultaneously, they filed a motion to have the
interlocutory orders dated 30 January 2001 set aside on grounds of various
alleged suppressions and misrepresentations of material facts by the
Defendants.

7 On 5 February 2001 the parties arrived at a settlement of the First Action
and executed a document entitled "Terms of Settlement". On 6 February 2001 the
Plaintiffs consented to judgment and decree being entered in terms of the
Terms of Settlement. Clause 8 of thereof stipulates that _"the parties agree
that upon the terms of settlement now entered herein the [MRA] will continue
to operate and subsists as amended by these terms of settlement and these
terms will be treated as part and parcel of the said agreement."_ The parties
agree that there is nothing in the Terms of Settlement that alters Clause 19
of the MRA.

8 Differences continued to plague the relationship between the parties mainly
over payments under the terms of the MRA. Matters came to a head on 15 October
2001 when the Defendants gave notice to the Plaintiffs that the MRA had ceased
to operate by reason of the Plaintiffs breaches of paragraphs 1(a), 1(b) and
1(d) of the Terms of Settlement which relate to payment of certain sums and
the provision of a guarantee. The Plaintiffs claimed that they received this
notice only on 16 October 2001 and that they had in fact effected payment on
15 October, which was the extended deadline given by the Defendants.

9 On 16 October 2001 the Defendants took out a second action against the
Plaintiffs in the Colombo High Court by way of Plaint No. HC (Civil)
246/2001(1) ("the Second Action") for _inter alia_ damages for breach of the
terms of the MRA and the Terms of Settlement. On the same day they applied _ex
parte_ for and obtained an interim injunction enjoining the Plaintiffs from
_"preventing [the Defendants] and/or interfering with [the Defendants]
negotiating with any party and/or entering into contracts with any party
and/or taking any steps in connection with entering into any contracts with
any party in respect of matters covered by the [MRA]."_

10 On 17 October 2001 the Defendants called for expressions of interest for
the sale of the commercial rights which form the subject-matter of the MRA and
issued tender packages. The deadline for submission was fixed for 25 October
but this was later extended to 29 October. On 18 October the Defendants placed
a press advertisement giving notice that the Plaintiffs had failed to perform
their obligations under the Terms of Settlement.

11 On 19 October the Plaintiffs took out a motion in the Colombo High Court to
raise the Plaintiffs objection to it exercising jurisdiction in the Second
Action. This came up for hearing on 24 October but it was adjourned to 26
October. On that date it was further adjourned to 29 and 30 October.

12 On 26 October the Plaintiffs notified the Defendants of their intention to
commence proceedings in Singapore, which they did on 29 October in the form of
the present action.

13 The hearing of the Plaintiffs motion in the Colombo High Court was
conducted on 29 and 30 October and the parties filed written submissions on 2
November. On 7 November the Colombo High Court dismissed the motion. The
Colombo High Court held that Clause 19 of the MRA gave the parties a choice to
elect between arbitration and litigation and was therefore not an "arbitration
agreement" within the meaning of s 5 of the Sri Lankan Arbitration Act, which
applied only to compulsory arbitration clauses. The Colombo High Court ruled
that it therefore had jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs and the subject-matter
of the Second Action. The Plaintiffs then withdrew from further participation
in the Second Action. The action was fixed for _ex parte_ trial. On 23
November 2001 the Plaintiffs lodged a petition in the Supreme Court of Sri
Lanka for leave to appeal against the Order of Court dated 7 November. This
was heard and dismissed by the appeal court on 11 January 2002.

14**** Meanwhile on 19 October 2001 the Plaintiffs, by their solicitors in
Singapore, issued a Notice of Arbitration to the Defendants pursuant to Clause
19 of the MRA. The notice advised that the Plaintiffs would be appointing Mr
Christopher Bathurst, QC as their arbitrator and that they would be seeking
the following relief:

(i) an interim injunction against the Defendants acting contrary to the MRA
and the Terms of Settlement;

(ii) a declaration that the MRA and Terms of Settlement continue to be in full
force and effect;

(iii) an order of specific performance of the MRA and Terms of Settlement; and

(iv) damages, interest and costs.

On the same day the Plaintiffs duly notified the SIAC of the reference to
arbitration. On a without prejudice basis, the Defendants appointed their
arbitrator, Mr Stanley Goonawardane on 9 November 2001. Mr Joseph Grimberg, SC
was appointed the presiding arbitrator. Under Article 16 of the Model Law, the
tribunal is competent to rule on its own jurisdiction, including any question
of the existence of the arbitration agreement. The Defendants have raised this
as a preliminary question and the tribunal has fixed this for hearing on 23 to
25 May 2002. That is the status of the dispute between the parties.

**

Grounds for discharge

**

15 The Defendants application to discharge the injunctions initially proceeded
on a number of grounds. However at the start of their submissions in reply on
6 May 2002, the Defendants withdrew their grounds that (a) the incorrect
originating process was used; (b) the Defendants were not a legal entity; and
(c) the Plaintiffs had failed to make full and frank disclosure. Towards the
end of their submissions in reply the Defendants confirmed that they would
proceed only essentially on a single ground, namely that the Colombo High
Court having made a determination that Clause 19 of the MRA is not an
arbitration agreement, in which action the Plaintiffs have participated, the
Plaintiffs are estopped from submitting otherwise in the present action
("issue estoppel"). Accordingly in the present action, the Court would not
have any jurisdiction to make any order under s 12(6) as it is predicated on
the existence of an arbitration agreement which the Plaintiffs are estopped
from asserting. In the event that the Court should rule against them on issue
estoppel, the Defendants are prepared, for the purpose of this application and
without prejudice to their entitlement to raise any further points on the
question of jurisdiction or on the construction of Clause 19, to accept that
this Court has jurisdiction under s 12(6) of the Act to grant the anti-suit
and prohibitive injunction. The Defendants would then limit their submissions
to the question of discretion to grant the injunctions.

16 On their part, the Plaintiffs reserved the right to argue before an
arbitral tribunal or anywhere else that the decision of the Court in respect
of the construction of Clause 19, if in their favour, raises an issue estoppel
against the Defendants.

**

Whether Court has jurisdiction under s 12(6) of the Act

**

17 Notwithstanding the Defendants concession on the question of jurisdiction
should I find against them on the question of issue estoppel, in my view it is
necessary first to consider whether this Court has jurisdiction to make the
orders under s 12(6) of the Act. This would depend on whether the arbitration
in question is one to which Part II of the Act applies. That question turns on
whether Clause 19 of the MRA is an arbitration agreement falling within the
definition of that term in the Act. That definition is found in s 2 and it
provides as follows:

"arbitration agreement" means an agreement in writing referred to in Article 7
of the Model Law

The relevant paragraph of Article 7 of the Model Law is paragraph (1), which
provides as follows:

_

Article 7. Definition and form of arbitration agreement

> _

(1) "Arbitration agreement" is an agreement by the parties to submit to
arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise
between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual
or not. An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause
in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.

18 The question is whether Clause 19 of the MRA falls within Article 7(1).
Section 4 of the Act provides that, for the purposes of interpreting the Model
Law, reference may be made to _travaux prparatoires_ of the UNCITRAL and its
working group relating to the Model Law. UNCITRAL has published a commentary
on the draft Model Law on 25 March 1985 (Document A/CN.9/264 entitled
"Analytical Commentary on Draft Text of a Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration"). Paragraph 2 of the commentary on the draft of
Article 7(1) (which is substantially the same as the final text) states as
follows:

> 2\. The model law recognizes not only an agreement concerning an existing
> dispute ("_compromis_ ") but also an agreement concerning any future dispute
> ("_clause compromissoire_ "). Inclusion of this latter type of agreement
> seems imperative in view of its frequent use in international arbitration
> practice and will, it is hoped, contribute to global unification in view of
> the fact that at present some national laws do not give full effect to this
> type.

This statement affirms the intention of the Model Law to apply to _ad hoc_
agreements to refer an existing dispute to arbitration as well as an agreement
to refer future disputes to arbitration.

19 Clause 19 of the MRA is entitled "LAW/ARBITRATION" and provides as follows:

> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
> laws of England and Wales. In the event that the parties have a dispute over
> any term or otherwise relating to this Agreement they shall use their best
> endeavours to resolve it through good faith negotiations. In the event that
> they fail to do so after 14 days then either party may elect to submit such
> matter to arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules
> of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC Rules") for the
> time being in force which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference
> with this Clause to the exclusive jurisdiction of which the parties shall be
> deemed to have consented. Any arbitration shall be referred to three
> arbitrators, one arbitrator being appointed by each party and the other
> being appointed by the Chairman of the SIAC and shall be conducted in the
> English language.

20 The Defendants had submitted to the Colombo High Court that the words "may
elect" in Clause 19 confers on the parties a wide discretion in that either of
them may elect for arbitration or to go to the Courts and there was no reason
to give the word "may" a mandatory meaning. Since s 5 of the Sri Lankan
Arbitration Act applies only when there is a compulsory arbitration clause,
Clause 19 was not an arbitration agreement within the meaning of that Act. The
Defendants had made an election to litigate when they commenced the action in
the Colombo Court.

21 In my view, this submission hinges on taking the word "may" out of the
context of Clause 19 and, after associating that word with notions of
discretion and a lack of any mandatory meaning, these notions are then linked
with the word "arbitration" to arrive at the conclusion that there is no
compulsory arbitration clause. But in order to arrive at the proper
construction of Clause 19 it is necessary to consider the provision in its
entirety and see how the words relate to one another to convey the intention
of the parties. Taking this approach, the first sentence deals with the
governing law which is to be English law. The remainder of the clause relates
directly to arbitration and on a plain reading, this is what it provides. In
the event of a dispute, the parties are required first of all to use their
best endeavours to resolve it through good faith negotiations. It is only if
this is unsuccessful after 14 days that the right is given to either party to
elect to submit the dispute to arbitration. Upon such an election, both
parties are bound to submit to arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the
Arbitration Rules of the SIAC for the time being in force. Arbitration shall
be conducted by three arbitrators with each party to appoint one and the SIAC
Chairman to appoint the third. While it is true that under Clause 19, there is
no compulsion to arbitrate until an election is made, once a party makes such
election, arbitration is mandatory in respect of that dispute.

22 Another problem with the Defendants submission is that there is no express
mention in Clause 19 of any election to resolve the dispute by court action
nor that once any party takes out an action in court, the other party is
precluded from electing to submit the dispute to arbitration. It is the right
of a party to a contractual dispute to commence an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction for the determination of his claims. But this is
subject to any agreement that the parties shall resolve such disputes by way
of arbitration. If there is such an agreement then the court may, on the
defendants application, stay the action on that ground. This is certainly the
position in Singapore and it is not disputed that it is so in Sri Lanka. When
Clause 19 is construed within this legal matrix, it is clear that it is not a
question of making an election for arbitration or litigation, but whether any
party has opted for arbitration. This construction is consistent with the
approach taken by the English High Court in _Wesfal Larsen & Co A/S v Ikerigi
Compania Naviera SA (The Messiniaki Bergen) _[1983] 1 All ER 382 and _Lobb
Partnership Ltd v Aintree Racecourse Company Ltd_ [2000] BLR 65.

23 The question whether a clause which confers the parties an option to
arbitrate is an arbitration agreement was considered in _Wesfal Larsen & Co
A/S v Ikerigi Compania Naviera SA (The Messiniaki Bergen)_. The contract there
contained the following arbitration clause:

> Any dispute arising under this charter shall be decided by the English
> courts to whose jurisdiction the parties agree whatever their domicile may
> be: Provided that either party may elect to have the dispute referred to the
> arbitration of a single arbitrator in London in accordance with the
> provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1950, or any statutory modification or
> re-enactment thereof for the time being in force. Such election shall be
> made by written notice by one party to the other not later than 21 days
> after receipt of a notice given by one party to the other of a dispute
> having arisen under this charter.

Bingham J held that by itself this did not constitute an agreement to
arbitrate. It merely confers an option which may but need not be exercised.
But once a party duly elects to refer the dispute to arbitration, a binding
arbitration agreement comes into existence. He held that the arbitration
clause was an "arbitration agreement" within the meaning of s 32 of the U.K.
Arbitration Act 1950.

24 In _Lobb Partnership Ltd v Aintree Racecourse Company Ltd_ the English
Court had to deal with an unusual arbitration clause. This provided that:

> Disputes may be dealt with as provided in paragraph 1.8 of the RIBA
> Conditions but shall otherwise be referred to the English Courts. The
> construction, validity and performance of this Agreement shall be governed
> by English law.

Paragraph 1.8.1 of the RIBA Conditions states as follows:

> any difference or dispute arising out of the Appointment shall be referred
> by either parties to arbitration by a person to be agreed between the
> parties or, failing agreement within fourteen days after either party has
> given the other a written request to concur in the appointment of an
> arbitrator, a person to be nominated at the request of either party by the
> President of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators

25 Colman J did not agree with the defendants argument that the arbitration
clause gave the party claiming relief in respect of a dispute the right to
elect to bring this claim before an arbitrator or the courts. He was of the
view that the parties had intended by this clause to give the right to either
party, in the event of a dispute between them, to insist on its being dealt
with in accordance with paragraph 1.8 of the RIBA Conditions. He referred to
the _Wesfal-Larsen case_ and said (at p 68):

> The English courts have consistently taken the view that, provided that the
> contract gives a reasonably clear indication that arbitration is envisaged
> by both parties as a means of dispute resolution, they will treat both
> parties as bound to refer disputes to arbitration even though the clause is
> not expressed in mandatory terms.

Colman J said that while it was possible to have a situation in which parties
are given the right to opt for litigation, which would be useful if third
parties are required to be joined, he felt that this was not the construction
of the clause before him. He said as follows at p 69:

> It is true that there might be an underlying procedural purpose in a
> unilateral right to elect to arbitrate or litigate, in as much as the
> claimant might wish to have the facility of starting an action in court not
> only against the opposite party to the contract, but also against other
> parties not subject to an agreement to arbitrate. He might therefore wish to
> have only a non-mandatory arbitration clause so as to avoid the operation of
> the stay jurisdiction under section 9 of the Arbitration Act 1996. However,
> I do not consider this consideration a pointer strong enough to outweigh the
> general effect of the words in their ordinary and natural meaning being to
> make the arbitration facility under paragraph 1.8 available to either party,
> whichever of them initiated the claim arising out of the dispute.

26 The Defendants refer to _Hammond v Wolt_ [1975] VR 108, a decision of the
High Court of Victoria, in which Menhennitt J had to consider the following
clause:

> 23(a) In the event of any dispute arising . . . either party may give to the
> other notice in writing of such dispute and he shall simultaneously
> therewith notify the President . . . of the Housing Industry Association . .
> . of such dispute and shall lodge with the said President . . . the sum of
> $200 . . . with a request to the said President . . . to appoint a person
> (hereinafter called the arbitrator). Any Award or Assessment made by the
> said Arbitrator shall be final and binding . . . and neither [party] shall
> be entitled to commence or maintain any action upon any such dispute which
> has been so referred to Arbitration until such dispute has been determined
> by the Arbitrator and then only in accordance with any Award Assessment or
> direction given by such Arbitrator.

27 The defendant there alleged that court proceedings had been brought by the
plaintiff in breach of an arbitration agreement and ought to be stayed under s
5 of the Victorian Arbitration Act 1958. The judge had to determine whether
this clause was "a submission", defined in that Act as _"a written agreement
to submit present or future differences to arbitration whether or not an
arbitrator is named therein or not"_. Menhennitt J held as follows (at p 116):

> In my opinion, it is also the position that, under disputes cl. 23, all the
> parties have is an option to have differences referred and there is no
> agreement to submit until the option has been exercised. The prime reason
> for this conclusion is, I think, the presence of the word "may" in the
> provision for giving notice of the dispute to the opposite party and to the
> president . . . . It is entirely in the option of the parties as to whether
> or not they give notice and until they do, nothing is submitted to anyone.
> The conclusion is reinforced by the absence of any language directly
> referring the dispute to anyone. As I have said, the conclusion that a
> dispute or disputes are referred is a matter of implication, and, in my
> view, the true construction of the clause is that there is to be implied a
> provision that if one party gives to the other party and to the president .
> . . notice of a dispute and pays the required sum and a person is nominated
> by the president . . . , the dispute is then referred to the person
> nominated and, until that happens, there is no agreement to submit any
> differences to anyone. . . .
>
> The question remains whether an agreement which gives either party an option
> to have differences submitted to arbitration is an agreement to submit
> differences to arbitration within the meaning of the definition in s.3 of
> the Act and, by incorporation, s.5. In my opinion, it is not. The expression
> used is agreement to submit and the word to requires, I think, that the
> parties have agreed that the differences are to be submitted, not that, at
> the option of one or other of them, they may be.

28 Menhennit J held, in effect, that a clause in which the parties are given
an option to elect for arbitration is not an agreement to submit differences
to arbitration within the meaning of the Arbitration Act 1958. However this
view was soundly rejected by the Victorian Court of Appeal in _Manningham City
Council v Dura Constructions (Australia) Pty Ltd_ [1999] VSCA 158, in which
Phillips JA said at 8:

> 8\. In _Hammond v. Wolt_ [1975] V.R. 108, Menhennitt, J. took the view that
> the clause in the contract under which the parties there had an option to
> have differences referred to arbitration did not until the option had been
> exercised constitute an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration. That
> view has since been authoritatively rejected. The contract may contain an
> arbitration agreement notwithstanding that the reference of a particular
> dispute to arbitration will depend upon the exercise of an option. In
> reaching his conclusion, Menhennitt, J. drew upon the decisions of the High
> Court in _John Grant & Sons Ltd. v. Trocadero Building and Investment Co.
> Ltd._ (1938) 60 C.L.R. 1 and _Plucis v. Fryer_ (1967) 126 C.L.R. 17. Both
> were relied upon to sustain the conclusion that there was no arbitration
> agreement in the case of _Hammond_ , but, with great respect, both were
> concerned with a somewhat different aspect.

29 The arbitration clause in the _Manningham City Council case_ had provided
for dispute resolution by either litigation or arbitration but with an
overriding right on the part of any party to opt for arbitration. The
Victorian Court of Appeal held that such a clause was an "arbitration
agreement" within the meaning of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 in which
the term was defined as _"an agreement in writing to refer present or future
disputes to arbitration"_. Buchanan JA said that it is such an agreement if
the parties are bound to resort to arbitration in the event that certain
conditions are fulfilled. He reasoned as follows (at 27):

> 27\. The agreement in the present case requires resolution of a dispute by
> arbitration once a notice of referral to arbitration has been given under
> clause 13.03 and provision has been made for the security required by clause
> 13.04. Thereupon, according to clause 13.04, the dispute "shall be and is
> hereby referred to arbitration." The agreement in terms contemplates that a
> dispute may be resolved by litigation, thereby making express that which was
> implicit in the agreement considered by the High Court in the _PMT Case_.
> However, it remains an agreement by which the parties are bound to have
> their disputes arbitrated if certain conditions are fulfilled. If a notice
> is properly given under clause 13.03 referring the dispute to arbitration
> and security for costs is provided, the dispute is referred to arbitration
> because the parties have already agreed that the dispute will be resolved by
> arbitration upon the occurrence of those events.

30 In the light of these authorities, it is clear that an agreement in which
the parties have the option to elect for arbitration which, if made, binds the
other parties to submit to arbitration is an arbitration agreement within the
meaning of the Act. This is plainly in accord with the policy behind the Act
which is to promote the resolution of disputes by arbitration where the
parties have agreed to achieve it by this method. I would therefore hold that
Clause 19 is an arbitration agreement for the purpose of this application and
accordingly this Court has jurisdiction to make orders under s 12(6) in
respect of this arbitration.

**

Issue estoppel

**

31 The Defendants submit that the Colombo High Court had, in the Second
Action, conclusively determined a number of issues which the Plaintiffs cannot
now re-litigate before me. The Colombo High Court had made the following
findings:

> (a) Clause 19 of the MRA gives the parties a choice to elect between
> arbitration and litigation;
>
> (b) Clause 19 is therefore not an "arbitration agreement" within the meaning
> of section 5 of the Sri Lankan Arbitration Act, which applies only to
> compulsory arbitration clauses; and
>
> (c) Accordingly, the Colombo High Court has jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs
> and the subject-matter of the Second Action.

32 In relation to these findings, the Defendants submit that the conditions
are met to raise an estoppel _per rem judicatam_ against the Plaintiffs. Those
conditions, as summarised by the House of Lords in _The Sennar (No.
2)_****[1985] 1 Lloyds Rep 521, are as follows:

> (i) The earlier judgment (a) was made by a court of competent jurisdiction;
> (b) is final and conclusive; and (c) was made on the merits;

(ii) The parties in the earlier action must be the same as those in the later
action in which that estoppel is raised as a bar;

(iii) The issue in the later action must be the same as that decided by the
judgment in the earlier action.

33 The Court of Appeal had cited _The Sennar (No. 2)_**** with approval and
followed it in _Official Assignee of the estate of Tang Hsiu Lan, a bankrupt v
Pua Ai Seok & Ors_ [2001] 2 SLR 436. The Plaintiffs have no dispute on the
law. But they submit that:

> (a) the Colombo High Court was not a court of competent jurisdiction because

_

(a) No submission to jurisdiction

_

34 The Plaintiffs contend that they are not amenable to the jurisdiction of
the Colombo High Court. They are a Singapore company without any presence in
Sri Lanka. Clause 19 of the MRA specified English law as the governing law
with arbitration to be conducted in Singapore under the SIAC Rules. They had
not taken any action that may be construed as having voluntarily submitted to
the jurisdiction of the Colombo High Court. The Plaintiffs point out that the
following were the steps that they had taken in the Second Action:

> (i) Filed a notice of motion to object to the Colombo High Court exercising
> jurisdiction under s 5 of the Sri Lankan Arbitration Act No 11 of 1995;

(ii) Attended before the Colombo High Court to argue that it had no
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute;

> (iii) Filed written submissions without prejudice to their position that the
> Defendants were precluded under the anti-suit injunction from proceeding in
> the Second Action; and

(iv) Applied for leave to appeal against the order of the Colombo High Court
on the question of jurisdiction.

The Plaintiffs emphasise that their participation in the Second Action was
limited to their objection to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Colombo High
Court. They point out that they had taken no steps to defend the merits of the
Second Action and even allowed default judgement to be entered against them.

35 The Defendants submit that by participating in the Second Action the
Plaintiffs had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Colombo High Court. They
pointed out that the Plaintiffs challenge was based on s 5**** of the Sri
Lankan Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995, which reads as follows:

> Where a party to an arbitration agreement institutes legal proceedings in a
> court against another party to such agreement in respect of a matter agreed
> to be submitted for arbitration under such agreement, the Court shall have
> no jurisdiction to hear and determine such matter if the other party objects
> to the Court exercising jurisdiction in respect of such matter.

The Defendants argue that this provision does not operate automatically to
deprive the Colombo High Court of jurisdiction. It is only when an objection
is raised to the Courts taking jurisdiction that the issue of the
applicability of s 5 comes into play. Therefore the Plaintiffs must, at the
outset, have accepted that the Colombo High Court had jurisdiction under its
own law to hear and determine the Second Action. Accordingly the Plaintiffs
are bound by the determination made by the Colombo High Court on this
question, i.e. that Clause 19 is not an arbitration agreement for the purpose
of s 5 of the Sri Lankan Arbitration Act and therefore it had jurisdiction to
hear the action commenced by the Defendants. The Defendants rely on _Williams
& Glyns Bank plc v Astro Dinamica Compania Naviera S.A._ [1984] 1 WLR 438 in
which the House of Lords held that there were two different and distinct
jurisdictions: (a) jurisdiction over the merits of the claim; and (b)
jurisdiction to determine whether the court has jurisdiction over the merits.
The Defendants contend that the Colombo High Court had exercised the latter
jurisdiction in deciding that Clause 19 was not an arbitration agreement. The
Plaintiffs, by participating in the hearing on that issue, had voluntarily
submitted to that jurisdiction of the Colombo High Court.

36 In the _Williams & Glyns Bank case_, the plaintiffs lent money to a Greek
company under a loan agreement. This loan was secured by _inter alia_ two
guarantees, one from each of the defendant companies. Each guarantee was
backed by a mortgage of a ship belonging to the company and provided for
English law to be the governing law and the English courts to have exclusive
jurisdiction. When the Greek company defaulted on the loan repayment, the
plaintiffs sued the defendants in England on the guarantees. The defendants
claimed that these guarantees were procured fraudulently and the signatories
had no authority from the companies to execute them. Therefore the guarantees
were null and void and there was no agreement on the part of the defendants to
submit to the jurisdiction of the English courts. The defendants commenced
proceedings in the Greek court for declarations that the guarantees were void
and of no effect. The defendants also took out an application in England under
O 12 r 8(1) of the English Rules of Supreme Court for _inter alia_ an order to
set aside the writ or service of the writ and a stay of the action on the
ground of _forum non conveniens_ and _lis alibi pendens_. There were therefore
two questions before the court: (i) whether it had jurisdiction over the
defendants who assert that the guarantees were null and void; and (ii) whether
to grant a stay. Logically, the court should first decide whether it has
jurisdiction over the matter before it can go on to consider any other
application in the matter and Bingham J ordered that the issues as to
jurisdiction be heard and determined as a preliminary issue. But that would
involve a determination of whether the guarantees were valid or not, which was
at the heart of the dispute and would take a considerable time. Lord Fraser,
with whom the other judges agreed, held that the court had power to stay the
proceedings, even before it had decided on the question of its jurisdiction,
because under s 43(9) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 it had a wide power to
stay any proceedings before it.

37 The holding by the House of Lords that there are two different and distinct
jurisdictions involved was made in a different context from the present case.
The plaintiffs in the _Williams & Glyns Bank case_ had contended that in
applying for a stay, the defendants had waived any objection to the
jurisdiction of the English courts. The House held that there was no waiver
because in entertaining the stay application the court was acting under its
power to decide whether it had jurisdiction over the merits without assuming
that it had such jurisdiction. Lord Fraser reasoned as follows (at p 442):

> It was further contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondents
> either had waived any objection to the jurisdiction because they had taken a
> step in the action by applying for a stay, or that they would waive any
> objection if they persisted with their application in priority to disputing
> the jurisdiction. My Lords, it would surely be quite unrealistic to say that
> the respondents had waived their objection to the jurisdiction by applying
> for a stay as an alternative in the very summons in which they applied for
> an order giving effect to their objection to the jurisdiction. That summons
> makes it abundantly clear that they are objecting, and the fact that they
> ask for a decision upon their objection to be postponed until the outcome of
> the Greek proceedings is known is not in any way inconsistent with
> maintaining their objection. I can see no reason in principle or common
> sense why the respondents should not be entitled to say: "We object to the
> jurisdiction of the English courts, but we ask for the proceedings necessary
> to decide that and the other issues to be stayed pending the decision of the
> proceedings in Greece."
>
> The argument to the contrary which was accepted by Bingham J. was that, if
> the court were to entertain the application for a stay, it would be assuming
> that it had jurisdiction to entertain the action. With the greatest respect
> to the learned judge, I agree with Robert Goff L.J. in the Court of Appeal
> that that view is mistaken. The fallacy is in confusing two different kinds
> of jurisdiction; the first is jurisdiction to decide the action on its
> merits, and the second is jurisdiction to decide whether the court has
> jurisdiction of the former kind. The distinction was explained in _Wilkinson
> v. Barking Corporation_ [1948] 1 K.B. 721, 725 by Asquith L.J. who said:
>

>> "The argument we are here rejecting seems to be based on a confusion
between two distinct kinds of jurisdiction: the Supreme Court may, by statute,
lack jurisdiction to deal with a particular matter - in this case matters
including superannuation claims under section 8 - but it has jurisdiction to
decide whether or not it has jurisdiction to deal with such matters. By
entering an unconditional appearance, a litigant submits to the second of
these jurisdictions (which exists), but not to the first (which does not)."

>
> By entertaining the application for a stay in this case, the court would be
> assuming (rightly) that it has jurisdiction to decide whether or not it has
> jurisdiction to deal with the merits, but would not be making any assumption
> about its jurisdiction to deal with the merits.

38 In the present action, the Plaintiffs had filed an application in the
Colombo High Court objecting to the exercise of jurisdiction by that court on
the ground that it had no jurisdiction by virtue of the arbitration agreement.
There was no other application by the Plaintiffs and in particular there was
no application for a stay. The Defendants contention that in filing the
objection application the Plaintiffs had submitted to the Colombo High Courts
jurisdiction to decide its own jurisdiction, while certainly attractive, is
therefore not directly supported by the _Williams & Glyns Bank case_ which
involves an application for a stay. Furthermore, in my respectful view Lord
Fraser had applied this dual jurisdiction concept in order to avoid a
situation where the defendants, in applying in the English courts for a stay,
would be taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction. It would be ironical if
the _ratio_ in the _William & Glyns Bank case_ is to be held to apply in the
circumstances of the present case.

39 The Defendants also rely on _Harris v Taylor_[1915] 2 KB 580 and _Henry v
Geoprosco International Ltd_ [1976] 1 QB 726. In _Harris v Taylor,_ the
English Court of Appeal held that a defendant who had entered a conditional
appearance in the Isle of Man court in order to set aside the proceedings on
jurisdictional grounds had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Manx Court,
even though he took no further part in the proceedings after his application
to set aside was unsuccessful. The defendant was an Englishman who was not
resident nor owned any property in the Isle of Man. The plaintiff obtained
leave from the Manx court to serve the writ out of jurisdiction and it was
duly served on the defendant in England. The defendant unsuccessfully applied
to set aside enforcement proceedings in the England based on the Manx
judgment. The matter turned on whether the defendant had submitted to the
jurisdiction of the Manx court. The defendants counsel had entered a
conditional appearance to set aside the writ and leave was granted to file a
motion for this purpose. In his motion, the defendant applied to set aside the
writ and the order for service out of jurisdiction on three grounds: (i) that
the Manx rules of court do not contemplate or authorise service out of the
jurisdiction; (ii) that no cause of action arose within the jurisdiction; and
(iii) that the defendant was domiciled in England. The Manx procedure is
explained by Pickford LJ at p 590:

> The procedure in an action in the Isle of Man is this. A document called a
> statement of claim is filed, and the case is called on in Court. The
> defendant may or may not be present. If he is, no difficulty arises; he has
> to put in a defence. If he is not present, certain process follows, and if
> the defendant is not resident in the Isle of Man it is necessary for the
> plaintiff to obtain an order for service of a writ out of the jurisdiction.
> That is what was done in this case, and the defendant's advocate
> subsequently applied to the Court to have the service of the writ out of the
> jurisdiction set aside on various grounds. That application was heard by the
> Court and was dismissed. Then the plaintiff signed an interlocutory
> judgment, and obtained a writ of inquiry for the assessment of the damages
> by a jury. I am inclined to think, though I am not sure, that the Court
> treated the defendant's appearance on his motion as in the nature of a
> conditional appearance, but the point is not in my view of any importance
> because the evidence shows that if the appearance was only intended as a
> conditional appearance the Court had power in its discretion to treat it as
> an appearance to the action; and if a defendant applies to a Court to set
> aside the service of a writ under which judgment could be obtained against
> him, and the Court is one which has power to treat that application as
> constituting an appearance to the action, that in my opinion amounts to such
> a submission on the part of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Court
> as renders him liable to obey the judgment of the Court. In my opinion the
> defendant did submit to the jurisdiction of the Isle of Man Court, and,
> therefore, the judgment of that Court is enforceable against him in the
> Courts of this country.

40 Buckley LJ reasoned that as the defendant was not subject to that
jurisdiction, if he had done nothing, any judgment given by the Manx court
could not have been enforced against him unless he had some property there. By
entering conditional appearance and contending to the Manx court that it had
no jurisdiction he had done something that he was not obliged to do. Buckley
LJ said as follows at p 587:

> The question which we have to decide on this appeal depends, as I have said,
> on whether the defendant submitted to the jurisdiction of the Isle of Man
> Court, and in order to decide that question it is necessary to consider what
> it was that the defendant did on March 17, when as the record states he
> appeared conditionally to set aside the writ. When the defendant was served
> with the process he had the alternative of doing nothing. He was not subject
> to the jurisdiction of the Court, and if he had done nothing, although the
> Court might have given judgment against him, the judgment could not have
> been enforced against him unless he had some property within the
> jurisdiction of the Court. But the defendant was not content to do nothing;
> he did something which he was not obliged to do, but which, I take it, he
> thought it was in his interest to do. He went to the Court and contended
> that the Court had no jurisdiction over him. The Court, however, decided
> against this contention and held that the defendant was amenable to its
> jurisdiction. In my opinion there was a voluntary appearance by the
> defendant in the Isle of Man Court and a submission by him to the
> jurisdiction of that Court. If the decision of the Court on that occasion
> had been in his favour he would have taken advantage of it; as the decision
> was against him, he was bound by it and it became his duty to appear in the

> appearance or an unqualified appearance. If it can be regarded as a
> qualified appearance, it was an appearance for the purpose of getting a
> decision of the Court on the question whether the defendant was bound by the

> Man, and, therefore, it was his duty to obey the judgment.

41 Bankes LJ was of the view that as the defendant had appealed to the Manx
court to relieve him from a liability which the plaintiff sought to place upon
him, this imposed an obligation on him to comply with the decision of that
court even if it should go against him. He said this at p 591:

the principle underlying the case of a person resident in the foreign country
or of a person who has agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of its Courts
applies equally to the case of a person who appeals at a preliminary stage to
the foreign Court to relieve him from an obligation which the plaintiff by
means of the action seeks to put upon him. In _Carrick v. Hancock_ (1895) 12
Times L.R. 59 it was held that the fact that the residence of the defendant in
the foreign country was merely temporary was not sufficient to oust the
jurisdiction of the Courts of that country over him. Mr. Arthur Cohen in
arguing that case said that "as a man would be protected from being robbed
while passing through a foreign country so also he was liable to the
jurisdiction of its Courts," and Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. in giving
judgment said that in his opinion the "duty of allegiance was correlative to
the protection given by a State to any person within its territory. This
relationship and its inherent rights depended upon the fact of the person
being within its territory. It seemed to him that the question of the time the
person was actually on the territory was wholly immaterial." It seems to me
that if the duty of allegiance exists in a case like that where a mere
temporary protection of the law of the foreign Court is enjoyed, the case is
far stronger when a defendant actually appeals to a foreign Court to relieve
him from a liability which the plaintiff by his action seeks to place upon
him. The fact that the defendant has sought the protection of the Court
imposes upon him an obligation to obey the judgment of the Court if it should
happen that it is given against him. It is in my opinion an entire
misconception of the principle applicable to these cases to say that there is
a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court only when the
defendant by appearing in the action in the technical sense has consented to
the jurisdiction.

42 Bankes LJ said that _"[t]he precise point in this case does not seem to
have arisen for decision previously"_ (at p 590). And Pickford LJ commented on
the difficulty of the issue before them, saying at p 589:

I do not think the case is an easy one to decide.

43 _Harris v Taylor_ was considered by a later Court of Appeal in _Henry v
Geoprosco_ , which involved a Canadian plaintiff resident in Alberta. The
defendant company was incorporated in Jersey and had its head office in
London, but had no branch or assets in Canada. The plaintiff entered into a
service agreement with the defendants in Canada that was governed by English
law and had an arbitration clause. When the defendant dismissed the plaintiff
summarily the latter commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Alberta for
wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff obtained leave to serve the statement of
claim on the defendants outside the jurisdiction and this was effected in
Jersey. The defendants applied by motion to the Alberta court to: (a) set
aside the service of the statement of claim; and (b) alternatively, stay the
action by reason of the existence of the arbitration clause. The defendants
forwarded three grounds for setting aside the statement of claim: (i) the
first ground was one that eventually became irrelevant; (ii) the second ground
was that the plaintiffs affidavit seeking leave of court to serve out of the
jurisdiction was defective; and (iii) the third was that the Alberta court was
not the _forum conveniens_. The defendants motion was refused and their
subsequent appeal dismissed. Thereafter the defendants took no further part in
the Alberta proceedings. Roskill LJ, who delivered the judgment of the Court,
noted the following features of the case (at p 732):

> It is to be observed that at no time was it argued for the defendants that
> the Supreme Court of Alberta had no jurisdiction to entertain the action. It
> seems plain that such an argument would have failed, having regard to the
> clear terms of rule 30 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Alberta to which
> we have referred. This was no doubt the reason why no such argument was
> advanced. Grounds 2 and 3 above referred to in effect invited the Supreme
> Court to exercise its discretion not to allow service to stand. The
> application for a stay because of the arbitration clause was expanded in the
> notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal of Alberta to allege that the clause
> was a _Scott v. Avery_ clause. As a matter of English law this last
> submission was plainly untenable upon the true construction of that clause.

44 Roskill LJ observed that the decision in _Harris v Taylor_ had been much
criticised, in particular by the editors of _Dicey & Morris, The Conflict of
Laws_, 9th ed. (1973) and embarked on a detailed consideration of that
judgment _"in order to ascertain precisely what that case decided"_ (at p
736). After setting out the facts of that action, including an examination of
the first instance decision of Bray J, and the judgments of the members of the
Court of Appeal, Roskill LJ pointed out five salient points of the case:

> It seems to us of crucial importance, when considering the _ratio decidendi_
> of _Harris v. Taylor_ to observe, first, that the Isle of Man High Court had
> by its own local law jurisdiction over the defendant; secondly, that that
> court had a discretion whether or not to exercise that jurisdiction over the
> defendant; thirdly, that that court having heard a plea by the defendant
> that it could not and should not do so decided both that it could and should
> exercise that jurisdiction; fourthly, that it was not argued in the English
> action that that decision was in any way wrong by the local law, and,
> fifthly, that the defendant, having voluntarily invited the Isle of Man High
> Court, by the appearance which he made, to adjudicate upon his submission
> that that jurisdiction of that court could not and should not be exercised
> over him and having lost, had voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of
> that court so that thereafter the defendant could not be heard to say that
> that court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the entirety of the
> dispute between him and the plaintiff.

45 Roskill LJ then examined the line of authorities leading up to _Harris v
Taylor_ and concluded that they justify three propositions (at p 746, emphasis
added):

> (1) The English courts will not enforce the judgment of a foreign court
> against a defendant who does not reside within the jurisdiction of that
> court, has no assets within that jurisdiction and does not appear before
> that court, even though that court by its own local law has jurisdiction
> over him. (2) English courts will not enforce the judgment of a foreign
> court against a defendant who, although he does not reside within the
> jurisdiction of that court, has assets within that jurisdiction and appears
> before that court solely to preserve those assets which have been seized by
> that court. (3) The English courts will enforce the judgment of a foreign
> court against a defendant over whom that court has jurisdiction by its own
> local law (even though it does not possess such jurisdiction according to
> the English rules of conflict of laws) if that defendant voluntarily appears
> before that foreign court _to invite that court in its discretion not to
> exercise the jurisdiction which it has under its own local law_.

46 Roskill LJ pointed out that there was no decision that specifically held
that an appearance in a foreign court solely to protest against its
jurisdiction was a voluntary submission. He pointed out that in _Harris v
Taylor_ , (at p 747):

> the defendant went much further than protesting against the jurisdiction. It
> is plain that he was also inviting the Isle of Man High Court not to
> exercise the discretionary jurisdiction which it undoubtedly possessed under
> its own local law to allow the order for service out of the jurisdiction to
> stand - a submission which by implication accepted that there was
> jurisdiction in that court which it was entitled to exercise if it thought
> fit to do so.

47 Roskill LJ concluded that _Harris v Taylor_ did not stand for the
proposition that an appearance solely to protest against the jurisdiction of a
foreign court is a voluntary submission to that court. He pointed out that
there was authority that an appearance before an arbitrator solely to protest
his jurisdiction was not a submission to it. The judge said that the cases in
fact go further than that and a party can participate in the entire
arbitration subject to the protest as to jurisdiction. However the distinction
could lie in the fact that arbitration was consensual compared to the
compulsory jurisdiction of a court. Roskill LJ said as follows (at p 748):

> _Harris v. Taylor_ must, we think, therefore be taken as deciding that,
> whatever the position may be in relation to submission to the jurisdiction
> in arbitrations, that position has no direct application to the question of
> voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of a foreign court. It is not open
> to this court now to hold otherwise. The distinction may lie in the fact
> that whereas an arbitrator's jurisdiction is always wholly consensual, in
> the foreign judgment cases such as _Harris v. Taylor_ the foreign court had
> "compulsory" jurisdiction by its own local law and it was within the
> discretion of that court whether or not to exercise that jurisdiction. If,
> therefore, a defendant enters a conditional appearance or takes some other
> comparable step, he is thereby conditionally agreeing to submit to that
> jurisdiction. If his application to set aside service then fails, that
> condition is fulfilled. But in the arbitration cases there is no such
> conditional submission.

48 As the case before the Court in _Henry v Geoprosco_ was not one where the
defendants had appeared in the Alberta courts solely to protest the
jurisdiction, Roskill LJ said that the Court of Appeal was _"not deciding that
an appearance _solely_ to protest against the jurisdiction is, without more, a
voluntary submission."_ But (at p 748):

> .. we do think that the authorities compel this court to say that if such a
> protest takes the form of or is coupled with what in England would be a
> conditional appearance and an application to set aside an order for service
> out of the jurisdiction and that application then fails, the entry of that
> conditional appearance (which then becomes unconditional) is a voluntary
> submission to the jurisdiction of the foreign court.

49 As alluded to by Roskill LJ, the decisions in _Harris v Taylor_ and _Henry
v Geoprosco_ have been severely criticised by academic writers. Denning LJ had
commented as follows in _Re Dulles Settlement (No 2)_ [1951] Ch 842 (at p
850):

> I cannot see how anyone can fairly say that a man has voluntarily submitted
> to the jurisdiction of a court, when he has all the time been vigorously
> protesting that it has no jurisdiction. If he does nothing and lets judgment
> go against him in default of appearance, he clearly does not submit to the
> jurisdiction. What difference in principle does it make, if he does not
> merely do nothing, but actually goes to the court and protests that it has
> no jurisdiction? I can see no distinction at all. I quite agree, of course,
> that if he fights the case, not only on the jurisdiction, but also on the
> merits, he must then be taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction, because
> he is then inviting the court to decide in his favour on the merits; and he
> cannot be allowed, at one and the same time, to say that he will accept the
> decision on the merits if it is favourable to him and will not submit to it
> if it is unfavourable. But when he only appears with the sole object of
> protesting against the jurisdiction, I do not think that he can be said to
> submit to the jurisdiction

50 Indeed the English position has since been changed by legislation. But
there is no similar legislation in Singapore and the parties agree that the
common law position applies. The Plaintiffs submit that the rule in _Henry v
Geoprosco_ has not been adopted in any decision of the Singapore Courts and
that I should not adopt it because it is based on an application of the rule
in _Harris v Taylor,_ a decision that the English Courts themselves have
refused to apply in two subsequent decisions, i.e _Re Dulles Settlement (No
2)_ and _Daarnhouwer & Co NV v Boulous _[1968] 2 Lloyds Rep 259. However, the
Plaintiffs submit that even if this rule is adopted, on the facts of the
present case the Plaintiffs had not asked the Colombo High Court to exercise
any jurisdiction but had only raised the issue of its lack of jurisdiction in
view of the existence of the arbitration clause. On the view that I take in
relation to this question, I find that it is not necessary for me to enter
into a consideration as to whether the rule in _Henry v Geoprosco_ should or
should not be adopted in Singapore. I will proceed on the basis that it is the
law.

51 In _Henry v Geoprosco_ , Roskill LJ said that in determining whether a
defendant had voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction (at p 748):

> it must depend in each case upon what it was that the defendant did or
> refrained from doing in relation to the jurisdiction of the foreign court.

On that note, I note that what the Plaintiffs did in the proceedings in the
Colombo High Court was to take out a motion to raise the Plaintiffs objection
to it exercising jurisdiction in the Second Action. The motion is on the
following terms:

> the Defendant wishes to bring to the notice of Your Honours Court that the
> Defendant objects to Your Honours Court exercising jurisdiction over this
> matter in terms of Section 5 of the Arbitration Act No.11 of 1995.

This is in accordance with the scheme under s 5 of the Sri Lankan Arbitration
Act which provides as follows:

> Where a party to an arbitration agreement institutes legal proceedings in a
> court against another party to such agreement in respect of a matter agreed
> to be submitted for arbitration under such agreement, the Court shall have
> no jurisdiction to hear and determine such matter if the other party objects
> to the Court exercising jurisdiction in respect of such matter.

52 This provision does not operate by giving the court a power to stay
proceedings in favour of arbitration. Instead it provides that the court
_shall have no jurisdiction_ over the proceedings _if the other party objects_
to the Court exercising jurisdiction. Hence once an objection is made, by
operation of s 5 the Colombo High Court would have no jurisdiction over the
matter. It is essential to note that if the Plaintiffs do not make this
objection then it would appear that the Colombo High Court would have
jurisdiction; at the very least the Plaintiffs could be taken to have waived
their right to object. Only by making an objection to the Court exercising
jurisdiction in respect of the proceedings can the Plaintiffs deprive it of
jurisdiction. Furthermore, although the Plaintiffs have no presence or assets
in Sri Lanka, they were faced with a purported termination by the Defendants
of the MRA, the subject matter of which were, _inter alia_ , broadcasting
rights to Test matches played by the Sri Lankan cricket team. In the
circumstances they had an interest to ensure that the Colombo High Court did
not assume jurisdiction, which is in the nature of having assets within the
jurisdiction.

53 These circumstances are therefore quite removed from those in _Harris v
Taylor_ , where by Manx law, if the defendant there had done nothing, the
plaintiff could not have enforced the judgment against him in the Isle of Man
because he had no assets there nor in England because the jurisdiction of the
Manx court would not have been recognised. The Plaintiffs had not participated
in the proceedings apart from making the objection and submitting that this
objection was valid. The Defendants argue that by such participation, the
Plaintiffs had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Colombo High Court to
determine its jurisdiction. The House of Lords had in the _Williams & Glyns
Bank case_ pronounced the existence of such jurisdiction. However as explained
above, that case involved an application for a stay in which the court would
have to exercise its discretion, whereas the present case involves the making
of an objection which would operate to deprive the Colombo High Court of its
jurisdiction if an arbitration agreement existed.

54 As I have said above, the Defendants argument based on the dual
jurisdiction concept is attractive, certainly from a conceptual point of view.
However it is possible to take an overly theoretical approach to this question
and as a consequence lose sight of the woods for the trees. In my view that is
the danger with the Defendants approach. This Court has to bear in mind that
cases of this nature involve real people making business decisions in their
endeavour to create wealth for themselves and their employers. For my part I
would prefer the common-sense approach of Denning LJ in _In Re Dulles
Settlement (No. 2)_ and hold that the true question is whether, in raising the
objection before the Colombo High Court that it had no jurisdiction over the
matter by virtue of s 5 of the Sri Lankan Arbitration Act, the Plaintiffs had
taken a step in the proceedings which necessarily involved waiving their
objection to the jurisdiction. When posed in that manner, the answer is
obviously in the negative and I so hold.

 _(b) Issues not the same_

55 The Plaintiffs submit that the questions decided by the Colombo High Court
are not similar to the issues that this Court has to decide. The Colombo High
Court had decided that Clause 19 of the MRA is not an arbitration agreement
within the meaning of s 5 of the Sri Lankan Arbitration Act. But before me,
they submit, the question is whether Clause 19 is an arbitration agreement
within the meaning of s 2 of the Act which adopts the definition in Article 7
of the Model Law.

56 However I note that the definition of that term in s 50(1) of the Sri Lanka
Arbitration Act is on similar terms as follows:

> "Arbitration Agreement" means an agreement by the parties to submit to
> arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise
> between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual
> or not;

This is not surprising as the Sri Lankan Act was enacted in 1995 _inter alia_
to give effect to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards ("the New York Convention") as its long title states.

57 The Plaintiffs submit that the Colombo High Court would apply Sri Lankan
law in deciding the issue whereas this Court would apply Singapore law. This
is certainly an interesting argument. However, this submission was made
virtually at the last minute of the last day of submissions, and there was not
only no opportunity for counsel for the Defendants to respond to this, the
Plaintiffs counsel did not have time to develop the argument. Ordinarily I
would have given the parties an opportunity to make full submissions. However
a decision is required rather urgently because the arbitrators have fixed the
matter for hearing in late May 2002. In the circumstances, and in view of the
position I have taken on the remaining issues, I need not make a finding on
this point.

_

(c) Public policy

_

58**** The Plaintiffs submit that, even if they are deemed to have submitted
to the jurisdiction, the order of the Colombo High Court should not be
recognised in Singapore on two grounds:

(i) the Defendants had proceeded with the action in the Colombo High Court
with notice and in breach of the anti-suit injunction; and

(ii) the order of the Colombo High Court was made without regard to the treaty
obligations of Sri Lanka under the New York Convention.

59 The Plaintiffs point out that following the grant of the anti-suit
injunction on 29 October 2001, at the adjourned hearing of the Plaintiffs
objection motion in the Colombo High Court, the Plaintiffs drew the courts
attention to those injunctions. The learned judge there had stated that it was
for the Defendants to decide if they would continue with the Second Action in
view of the injunction. Notwithstanding this, the Defendants elected to
proceed. The Plaintiffs submit that, the Defendants having proceeded with the
Second Action in breach of an injunction of this Court which they had notice
of, it would be contrary to public policy to recognise any order made under
the Second Action.

60 The Plaintiffs refer to these passages in the following texts:

(i) _Cheshire & North, Private International Law, _13th Edn, at p 446:

No action is sustainable on a foreign judgment which is contrary to the
English principles of public policy.

(ii) _Halsburys Laws of England, 4 th Edition Reissue_, Vol 8(1), 1009:

**

> 1009\. Judgment contrary to public policy.

** A foreign judgment will not be recognised or enforced in England if its
recognition or enforcement, would be contrary to public policy.

(iii) _Dicey & Morris, The Conflict of Laws, 13th Edition_, Vol 1,__ at 14-145
_:_

> It will be contrary to public policy to recognise or enforce a judgment
> which has been obtained in disobedience of an injunction not to proceed with
> the action in a foreign court.

61 The Plaintiffs also cite _Philip Alexander Securities & Futures Ltd v
Bamberger & Ors_ CA (Civil Division) Transcript, 12 July 1996. The respondents
there had commenced proceedings in German courts against the appellants
despite the existence of arbitration clauses in the contracts providing for
arbitration in London. In each case the appellants contested the proceedings
on the basis that there was a binding arbitration agreement. On the appellants
application, the English court granted interim anti-suit injunctions against
the respondents. The respondents continued to prosecute their claims despite
having notice of the injunctions and obtained judgments from the German
courts. The English Court of Appeal approved the following statement of the
judge at first instance:

> It would seem to me _prima facie_ that if someone proceeds in breach of, and
> with notice of, an injunction granted by the English Court to obtain
> judgments abroad, those judgments should not, as a matter of public policy,
> be recognised in the United Kingdom.

62 In the present case the Defendants submit that the Plaintiffs themselves
had commenced the present action in breach of the order of the Colombo High
Court obtained by the Defendants on 16 October 2001 enjoining the Plaintiffs
from preventing the Defendants from, or interfering with the Defendants,
negotiating with or entering into contracts with any party in respect of
matters covered by the MRA. Therefore the injunctions obtained in these
proceedings are similarly tainted. On the Plaintiffs own argument, the Sri
Lankan Court, when it heard the Plaintiffs own application seeking the Sri
Lankan Courts determination of its own jurisdiction, was bound not to
recognise the injunctions issued by this Court as the Plaintiffs had obtained
it in breach of an order of the Sri Lankan Court. The Defendants say that this
distinction is in itself sufficient to take the present case out of the
authority of _Philip Alexander Securities & Futures Ltd v Bamberger & Others_.
They point out that the anti-suit injunctions in _Philip Alexander Securities
& Futures Ltd v Bamberger & Ors_ were not obtained in breach of an injunction
of the foreign court.

63 The Defendants also point out that _Philip Alexander Securities & Futures
Ltd v Bamberger & Others_ is of limited authority because although the court
had stated this principle, it had refused to grant the declarations sought by
the plaintiff that certain German judgments obtained against it in breach of
English anti-suit injunctions were not to be recognised or enforced as a
matter of English law. The Court of Appeal held that it was open to the judge
at first instance to decline to make the matter _res judicata_ but leave it
open to the German plaintiffs to seek to enforce their judgment in England.

64 However the Plaintiffs point out that the present injunctions were obtained
on 29 October and the Defendants notified immediately but they had only taken
out this summons on 22 January 2002. They point out that the proper course of
action on the part of the Defendants would have been to apply to adjourn the
Second Action and take out this application to obtain a discharge before
resuming it. Instead they had chosen to ignore it, taken out judgment, and
then come to this court almost three months later.

65 In my view I cannot ignore the actions of the Defendants. They were aware
of the anti-suit injunction and chose to ignore it. By virtue of the MRA they
had agreed to submit disputes to arbitration in Singapore upon election by any
party and the Plaintiffs have so elected. In the circumstances it would be
manifestly against public policy to give recognition to the foreign judgment
at the behest of the Defendants who have procured it in breach of an order
emanating from this Court.

**

Urgency

**

66 The Plaintiffs application was made pursuant to s 12(6) of the Act. Such an
application is governed by O 69A r 3(1)(c) of the Rules of Court which
provides that it is to be made to a Judge in Chambers or the Registrar. The
Defendants initially challenge the procedure by which the Plaintiffs took out
this application but have since abandoned it. However the application was made
_ex parte_ under O 69A r 3(3) which provides as follows:

> (3) Where the case is one of urgency such application may be made ex parte
> on such terms as the Court thinks fit.

The Defendants submit that the Plaintiffs have not shown that the application
was urgent and therefore they were not entitled to make the application _ex
parte_.

67 The Defendants submission is as follows. The Second Action was commenced on
16 October 2001 and the Plaintiffs were aware from 17 October that fresh
tenders were invited which would close on 25 October. The Plaintiffs were also
aware of the Second Action at the very latest on 19 October 2001, when they
appointed solicitors and took objection to the exercise of jurisdiction by the
Colombo High Court. On that day, the Plaintiffs issued the Notice of
Arbitration. On and from 19 to 24 October, the Plaintiffs did nothing in
Singapore to restrain the Defendants:

> (a) from continuing with the Second Action. In fact the Plaintiffs had
> actively participated in the Second Action by asking the Colombo High Court
> to decide on its own jurisdiction and participating fully in the hearings on
> that issue;
>
> (b) from entering into a fresh contract covering the same subject-matter as
> the MRA.

68 On 24 October the deadline for the tenders was extended to 29 October.
Between 24 and 29 October the Plaintiffs again did nothing in Singapore to
restrain the Defendants from proceeding with Second Action or to prevent the
Defendants from entering into a fresh contract. It was only on 29 October that
the Plaintiffs finally took out this action. However, that resort was not had
on the basis that the Colombo High Court was proceeding against the will of
the Plaintiffs to determine the question of its own jurisdiction. The
Defendants submitted that from the first affidavit of David Mallinson filed in
support of the Plaintiffs action, the Plaintiffs had resorted to the Singapore
Court on 29 October 2001 for the purpose of maintaining the status quo until
the Colombo High Court had had an opportunity to rule on the issue of its own
jurisdiction. It was clear, say the Defendants, that the urgency on 29 October
2001 arose from the fact that the Plaintiffs realised that they would not be
able to get a decision from the Colombo High Court on the issue of the Courts
own jurisdiction before noon on 29 October 2001. But this was entirely of the
Plaintiffs own making because they had ample time since 19 October to take the
steps which they belatedly took "as a matter of urgency" before this Court on
29 October 2001. The Defendants argue that this urgency was entirely
manufactured and insufficient to bring the Plaintiffs application within O
69A, r 3(3).

69 Mallinson had stated the following as the reasons for the urgency (at 34-36
of his first affidavit):

> 34\. Given that no ruling on WSG Nimbus Application can be obtained by 12
> noon, 29 October 2001, and prior to the closing of BCCSLs tender exercise,
> WSG Nimbus wrote to BCCSL on 26 October 2001 on the following terms:
>

>> > _

>>>

>>> "It has been and remains our position that the Sri Lankan Court does not
have jurisdiction to hear any dispute between the parties relating to the
Master Rights Agreement and/or the Terms of Settlement and further, that you
have brought the proceedings in HC(Civil) Case No 246/2001 in Sri Lanka in
breach of Clause 19 of the Master Rights Agreement.

>>>

>>> Unless we receive confirmation from you by 12.00 noon, 27 October 2001
that you will not enter into any contract(s) or commitment(s) with any third
party/parties in any way dealing with the rights forming the subject matter of
the Master Rights Agreement, we will have no other option but to institute
such proceedings in Singapore as may be necessary so as to protect our rights
in aid of the pending arbitration proceedings. Please let us know within the
next twenty-four (24) hours hereof, whether you wish to be heard in any such
proceedings and if so, the name(s) and contact details of your
representative(s) in Singapore."

>>>

>>> _

35\. By a letter dated 27 October 2001 to WSG Nimbus, BCCSL responded thus:

> > > _
>>>

>>> "We re-iterate that the Master Rights Agreement has ceased to operate and
that the courts in Singapore and the proposed Arbitral Tribunal;( not yet
constituted) has no jurisdiction to issue any order against us and we will not
be bound by any such order. We still have time to reply to your letter of
reference to Arbitration dated 19th October 2001.

>>>

>>> As you are no doubt aware we have no representative whatsoever in
Singapore.

>>>

>>> We will refer this matter on Monday to our Lawyers for necessary action,
inclusive of whether you could be charged for Contempt of Court."

>>>

>>> _

>>

>> It bears mention that BCCSL failed and/or refused to confirm (as requested
by WSG Nimbus) that it would not enter into any contract(s) or commitment(s)
with any third party/parties in respect of the Commercial Rights.

>>

>> 36\. In light of the oppressive and vexatious manner with which BCCSL has
conducted itself in instituting both the First Action and the Second Action,
as well as in the procurement of both the First Enjoining Order and the Second
Enjoining Order, there is a real risk that if the application herein was made
inter partes or with notice to BCCSL, BCCSL would procure an injunction from
the Colombo High Court restraining WSG Nimbus from instituting any legal
proceeding to enforce the arbitration agreement and or in aid of the
Arbitration. This would frustrate the very purpose and intent behind the
arbitration agreement that BCCSL had consensually entered into.

70 It is clear from Mallinsons affidavit that the reason for the urgency was
because the Defendants had refused to confirm that they would not deal with
the rights the subject of the MRA. The extended deadline for submission of
tenders was 29 October, on which date there was the possibility of a new
contract being awarded. Further, in his fourth affidavit, Mallinson had
explained that up until 26 October the parties were engaged in negotiations to
resolve the dispute. He was constrained not to disclose this fact as they were
conducted without prejudice. However since the Defendants had made reference
to it in the affidavits filed on their behalf, he felt he had to set the
record straight.

71 From the matters disclosed in the affidavits I am satisfied that the
Plaintiffs application was sufficiently urgent and fell within the ambit of O
69A r 3(3).

**

The anti-suit injunction

**

72 As I have determined that Clause 19 is an arbitration agreement, the
Defendants become subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. The Defendants
submit that even so, the anti-suit injunction should not be granted on the
ground that it does not fall within s 12(6) of the Act read with s 12(1)(g).
These provisions state as follows:

> 12\. (1) Without prejudice to the powers set out in any other provision of
> this Act and in the Model Law, an arbitral tribunal shall have powers to
> make orders or give directions to any party for
>

>> (a) security for costs;

>>

>> (b) discovery of documents and interrogatories;

>
> (c) giving of evidence by affidavit;
>

>> (d) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any property which is or
forms part of the subject-matter of the dispute;

>>

>> (da) samples to be taken from, or any observation to be made of or
experiment conducted upon, any property which is or forms part of the subject-
matter of the dispute;

>>

>> (db) the preservation and interim custody of any evidence for the purposes
of the proceedings;

>
> (e) securing the amount in dispute;
>

>> (f) ensuring that any award which may be made in the arbitral proceedings
is not rendered ineffectual by the dissipation of assets by a party; and

>>

>> (g) an interim injunction or any other interim measure.

>
> (6) The High Court or a Judge thereof shall have, for the purpose of and in
> relation to an arbitration to which this Part applies, the same power of
> making orders in respect of any of the matters set out in subsection (1) as
> it has for the purpose of and in relation to an action or matter in the
> court.

73 In _Sokana v Freyre & Co_ [1994] 2 Lloyds Rep 57, Colman J considered a
similar provision in the English Arbitration Act 1950, which he summarised in
his judgment in this manner (at p 64):

> > By reason of s. 12(6) of the Arbitration Act 1950 the High Court has:
>>

>>> . . . for the purpose of and in relation to a reference, the same power of
making orders in respect of . . . (h) interim injunctions . . . as it has for
the purpose of and in relation to an action or matter in the High Court . .

The parties make their submissions on the basis that this is _in pari materia_
with s 12(6) read with s 12(1)(g) of the Act. Colman J held that the English
provision gives power to the court to make interlocutory orders but only in
respect of an existing or pending reference to arbitration. He said as follows
(at p 64):

> The purpose of s. 12(6) of the Arbitration Act 1950 is to provide a power to
> the Courts to make interlocutory orders in relation to and for the purpose
> of a reference, in the same way as they have power to make interlocutory
> orders in relation to an action or other proceeding. The powers are all
> related to the matters in issue in, or the conduct of, the reference -
> security for costs, evidence by affidavit, the taking of oral evidence in
> England and abroad, the detention, preservation or inspection of property or
> anything else which is the subject of or related to the reference. The words
> "for the purpose of and in relation to a reference" clearly comprehend a
> reference to arbitration that has already been made or which the applicant
> is about to make. Thus the words of s. 12(6)(f) and (h) were held by Mr.
> Justice Brandon in _The Rena K_ , [1978] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 545; [1979] 1 Q.B.
> 377 to be wide enough to give jurisdiction to grant _Mareva_ injunctions.
>
> Thus _Mareva_ injunctions can be granted in aid of execution of an award
> under the existing reference or under a reference to be commenced
> analogously with such an injunction ordered in aid of execution of a
> judgment that may be given in a pending action or in an action which the
> applicant undertakes to commence. The relief in the latter case would thus
> be parasitic, as was recognized in _The Siskina,_ [1978] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 1;
> [1979] A.C. 210, since it had nothing to sustain it except the claim in the
> pre-existing or anticipated proceedings. The same would be true of each one
> of the categories of relief listed in s. 12(6) of the Arbitration Act. They
> are essentially remedies whose function is to assist in the just and proper
> conduct of the reference or preservation of property the subject of the
> reference.

74 The plaintiffs application in _Sokana v Freyre & Co_ was made pursuant to s
12(6) of the English Act, but they had asked for a permanent injunction and
damages on account of the defendants alleged breach of an agreement to
arbitrate by commencing proceedings in the Florida courts for a declaration
that there had been a settlement between the parties and for its enforcement.
Colman J held that as it was not an interim measure in aid of an existing
arbitration but a substantive claim, jurisdiction could not be founded on s
12(6) of the English Act. Colman J also held that it would not have made a
difference were the plaintiffs to convert the originating summons into a claim
for an interim injunction. This was because there was no reference to
arbitration in respect of the plaintiffs claim that the defendants had
breached the arbitration agreement by commencing the proceedings in Florida.

75 In the present case the Defendants submit that there is no reference to
arbitration on the question of their entitlement to commence the Second
Action. In the Plaintiffs Notice of Arbitration, they refer to three matters
in dispute, i.e. (i) the purported termination by the Defendants of the MRA
and the Terms of Settlement on grounds that the Plaintiffs had breached
paragraph 1(a), (b), (d) of the Terms of Settlement; (ii) the commencement of
negotiations by the Defendants with third parties on the commercial rights the
subject matter of the MRA; and (iii) interference with the rights of the
Plaintiffs under its team sponsorship agreement with Ceylon Tea Services Ltd
by instructing the latter to withhold payment of certain sums owed to the
Plaintiffs. The Defendants contend the Plaintiffs did not refer to arbitration
the question of their breach of the arbitration agreement by taking out the
Second Action in the Colombo High Court. Therefore, as with the situation in
_Sokana v Freyre & Co_, the anti-suit injunction cannot be an interim measure
to maintain the status quo in relation to a dispute referred to the arbitral
tribunal until it has had an opportunity to adjudicate upon it.

76 In my view there is a crucial difference between the present action and the
circumstances in _Sokana v Freyre & Co._ In that case the parties had, after
the arbitrators were appointed, engaged in negotiations to settle the dispute.
The defendants had alleged that the parties had reached a binding agreement to
settle the matter. When the plaintiffs disputed this, the parties attempted to
place this issue before the arbitrators. But because of a dispute with the
arbitrators over payment of a deposit for fees, the arbitrators refused to
accept the reference on the question of whether a settlement agreement had
been reached. The defendants then commenced the Florida proceedings for the
declaration and to enforce the settlement. As Colman J explained it (at p 61):

> > So the position on Apr. 26 was that: (i) there was a stalled arbitration
> in London between the plaintiffs and the defendants in relation to which the
> arbitrators were declining to accept jurisdiction in respect of the
> settlement agreement disputes and (ii) there were proceedings in the State
> Court in Florida in which the defendants claimed to enforce the settlement
> agreement, failing which they claimed the same relief as that claimed in the
> main part of arbitration

77 In _Sokana v Freyre & Co_ the defendants cause of action in the Florida
courts was a separate settlement agreement which was not the subject of an
arbitration agreement. The plaintiffs therefore had no basis to make the
application under s 12(6) of the English Act. Colman J said at p 65:

> > The originating summons, in its original form, claims relief by way of a
> permanent injunction and damages. The underlying cause of action is breach
> of the arbitration agreement. The injunction was for the purpose of
> restraining that breach and the damages claimed were in respect of loss
> allegedly caused by that breach. The allegation that the defendants are in
> breach of the arbitration agreement finds no expression in the existing
> reference to arbitration. Nor is that issue one which is to be raised in any
> reference to arbitration contemplated or foreshadowed by the plaintiffs.
> Thus the claim in this originating summons for a final injunction, as
> distinct from an interim injunction, cannot be the subject of an order under
> s. 12(6), firstly because it is not seeking an interim injunction, and
> secondly because it is not a claim for relief for the purpose of or in
> relation to the existing reference, or of or to any contemplated reference
> within the meaning of the Act. The relief sought would not be for the
> purpose of facilitating the just and proper conduct of the arbitration, but
> for the purpose of restraining an alleged breach of contract which had not
> been referred to any arbitrator and was not anticipated to be so referred.
> The Court would be required to determine an issue which fell within the
> arbitration clause and which the parties had never agreed to submit to the
> determination of the English Courts. In these circumstances, no order could
> properly be made under O. 73, r. 7, giving leave to issue and serve that
> originating summons on the defendants.
>>

>> Would the result be any different if the relief sought by the originating
summons were converted into a claim for an interim injunction? In my judgment
it would not. Such an interim injunction would not be a parasitic injunction
sustained by the issue in the existing or anticipated reference. It would
instead be a claim for relief to preserve the status quo until an award had
been made in a reference which had nothing whatever to do with the alleged
breach of the arbitration agreement. If that matter were referred to
arbitration, there would have to be a fresh reference.

>>

>> If one substitutes for the arbitration an action in Court, in which those
defendants had advanced their claims and had subsequently sought to commence
foreign proceedings in breach of an exclusive English jurisdiction clause, had
the plaintiffs wished to restrain those proceedings, they would have had to
counterclaim an injunction based on breach and apply for an interim injunction
to preserve the status quo pending determination of their counterclaim. No
similar procedure was available here. There would have had to be a fresh
reference through the London Chamber of Commerce in respect of the alleged
breach of the arbitration agreement.

>>

>> It follows that the claim for relief advanced by the originating summons,
whether in its original or modified form, did not fall within s. 12(6) of the
1950 Act, and there was accordingly no jurisdiction to make an order under O.
73, r. 7 for leave to issue and serve it outside the jurisdiction of the
English Court.

78 In the present case the facts are at a simpler level. There is an
arbitration clause in the MRA in which the parties agree to submit to
arbitration in Singapore upon the election of any one of them. The Defendants
purport to terminate the contract and the Plaintiffs dispute that they are
entitled to do so. The Defendants then commence proceedings in the Colombo
High Court _inter alia_ for damages for breach of the MRA (the Second Action).
The Plaintiffs elect to refer these disputes to arbitration. There is
therefore a reference to arbitration in respect of the disputes between the
parties and the Plaintiffs have sought in this originating summons an anti-
suit injunction to prevent the Defendants from proceeding with the Second
Action in the Colombo High Court. The Second Action before the Colombo High
Court is not based on a settlement agreement where there is no reference to
arbitration but based on the underlying contract, i.e. the MRA and the Terms
of Settlement, where there is a reference to arbitration.

79 The Defendants next submit that, even if there is jurisdiction under s
12(6), the Court ought not to have exercised its discretion to grant the anti-
suit injunction. They rely on _Sokana v Freyre & Co_ in which Colman J said
that such discretion should be exercised sparingly (at p 66):

> There is no doubt that the English Courts can, in appropriate cases,
> restrain by injunction the conduct of proceedings in a foreign Court: see
> _The Tropaioforos (No 2)_ , [1962] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 410. Where a contract
> contained an arbitration clause referring all relevant disputes to
> arbitration in England, and the claimant had started an arbitration in
> England and then commences proceedings in a foreign Court making the same
> claim as had been advanced in the arbitration, the invocation of the foreign
> Court's jurisdiction would be a breach of the arbitration agreement in
> English law: see _Mantovani v. Carapelli S.p.A._ ; [1980] 1 Lloyd's Rep.
> 375. However, the fact that the pursuit of such proceedings would amount to
> a breach of contract would not automatically entitle the other party to an
> injunction in the English Courts. The Court has a discretion whether to
> grant such an order: see _Pena Copper Mines Ltd. v. Rio Tinto Co. Ltd._ ,
> [1912] 105 L.T. 846. Such a direction should be exercised in favour of an
> injunction only with caution: see _Apple Corps. Ltd. v. Apple Computer Inc._
> , [1992] R.P.C. 70 per Mr. Justice Hoffmann at p. 77. The English Courts
> will not lightly interfere with the conduct of proceedings in a foreign
> court, even if that conduct is in breach of a contract to arbitrate.
>
> In the present case, there are already on foot in the Florida proceedings
> steps taken by the plaintiffs to challenge the jurisdiction of those Courts.
> If those steps are successful, the action will not proceed and the
> defendants will have to pursue their claims in the arbitration. Having
> regard to the fact that this arbitration agreement falls within art. 1 of
> the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
> Arbitral Awards, to which both the United States and Britain are parties, it
> would be extremely surprising if the United States had not given effect to
> that convention by enabling both the Federal Court and State Courts
> mandatorily to stay actions in breach of agreements for foreign arbitration.
> Accordingly, on the face of it, the plaintiffs should be able to obtain a
> mandatory stay of the Florida action. In view of there already being before
> those Courts applications challenging their jurisdiction, I am firmly of the
> view that, at least at this stage, the English Courts should not interfere

> must in such circumstances be left in control over their own proceedings. In
> my view, the appropriate course is that adopted by Mr. Justice Lloyd in _The
> Golden Anne_ , [1984] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 489.

80 I should add that immediately after those passages, Colman J made the
following remarks:

> Apart from the New York Convention, there are strong arguments for declining
> to exercise the jurisdiction to grant an injunction in this case. They are
> that it is appropriate that the Florida Courts should be seized of disputes
> under a contract governed by the law of Florida and, further, that the
> joinder of Den Norske Bank as a co-defendant in the Florida proceedings
> means that, at least theoretically, the enjoining of the defendants from
> pursuing such proceedings against the plaintiffs will lead to multiplicity
> of litigation on the same issues with different parties involved: see
> _Aratra Potato Co. v. Egyptian Navigation Co_., [1981] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 119.
> Finally, the issues in the arbitration and the evidence in the case appear
> to be located in or near to Florida and not in England.

81 The Defendants next refer to _World Pride Shipping Ltd v Daiichi Chuo Kisen
Kaisha ("The Golden Anne")_ [1984] 2 Lloyds Rep 489 in which Lloyd J had to
decide whether to grant an injunction restraining the defendants from
continuing with an application for summary judgment on a cross-claim against
the plaintiff pending before a Florida Court in circumstances where the
plaintiff also had a pending motion for the Florida equivalent of a stay on
grounds of an English law arbitration clause. Lloyd J said that the English
Court of Appeal in _Tracomin SA v Sudan Oil Seeds Co Ltd_ [1983] 2 Lloyds Rep
384 had re-affirmed the jurisdiction of the Court to grant an anti-suit
injunction. But the judge concluded that he should not grant the injunction in
the case before him, and said as follows (at p 498):

> The crucial difference between the present case and _Tracomin_ is that in
> _Tracomin_ , the Swiss Court had already refused a stay pursuant to the
> arbitration clause. Accordingly, there was no way in which the English Court
> could seek to compel the buyers to honour the arbitration agreement except
> by granting an injunction. In the present case, by contrast, the American
> Court has not yet ruled on the joint motion for continuance. The matter is
> still open. It seems to me in those circumstances it would be much better
> that the District Court should itself rule on the motion for continuance
> and, if it thinks fit, stay all further proceedings on [the plaintiffs]
> cross-claim, in the light of the judgment I have given . . . . rather than I
> should seek to pre-empt, and perhaps even seem to dictate, the decision of a
> foreign court. It may be said that having answered the first four questions
> in favour of [the plaintiff], consistency and logic require me to go one
> step further and answer the fifth question also in their favour. But
> consistency must yield to caution and logic to the requirements of judicial
> comity, by which I mean only the mutual respect due between those who, as
> Sir John Donaldson MR has said, "labour in adjoining judicial vineyards". I
> recognise that the District Court may refuse a stay; in which case the
> unfortunate result will follow that if [the defendants] motion for summary
> judgment is rejected, there will be concurrent proceedings on both sides of

> except as a last resort.

82 The Plaintiffs submit that _The Golden Anne_ and _Sokana v Freyre & Co_ are
no longer the representative of the position in English jurisprudence. In
1994, some ten years after those decisions, the English Court of Appeal took a
very different tack in _Aggeliki Charis Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA
("The Angelic Grace")_ [1995] 1 Lloyds Rep 87. Leggatt LJ said that _The
Golden Anne_ was _"not to be regarded as authority for the proposition that it
is wrong in principle to grant an injunction before the foreign Court has
decided whether to assume jurisdiction or reject it in favour of
arbitration"_. Millet LJ said that the decision in that case should be
regarded as having been decided on its own special facts.

83 In the _The Angelic Grace_ , the owners of the vessel was in dispute with
her charterers in respect of the damage she suffered during discharging
operations in Italian waters. The charter-party contained a clause that called
for arbitration in London. Rix J granted an anti-suit injunction against the
charterers commencing court proceedings in Venice and the charterers appealed.
In response to the submission by the charterers counsel to "robustly restrain"
itself, Leggatt LJ said (at p 94):

> The present case is the paradigm case for the prompt issue of an injunction.
> The charter here is governed by English law. According to English law, the
> arbitration clause extends to claims in tort. Proceedings in a foreign Court
> are in breach of contract, so an injunction can issue to restrain them. If
> no injunction issues, a foreign Court will either decline or accept
> jurisdiction. If, as we are entitled to assume it would, the Italian Court
> were to decline jurisdiction, those proceedings would have constituted a
> waste of time and money. If, on the other hand, the Italian Court were to
> accept jurisdiction, any injunction then issued would directly conflict with
> the deliberate assumption of jurisdiction by the foreign Court. The owners
> would also be set at risk of being held to have submitted to the
> jurisdiction of the foreign Court. In the absence of submission, the
> undesirable process would then occur envisaged by this Court in _Tracomin
> S.A. v. Sudan Oil Seeds Co. Ltd._ , [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 624; [1983] 1
> W.L.R. 1026 and the arbitrator's award would have to be for any damage held
> by them to have been suffered by the owners, in excess of any sum found due
> from them by the Italian Court. But if there were held to have been a
> submission, there would follow two parallel sets of proceedings where the
> arbitration clause had been contractually designed to ensure that there was
> only one. If the charterers are not restrained from pursuing the Italian
> proceedings and the Italian Court exercised jurisdiction, then the question
> would arise, referred to by the Judge, whether a judgment by the Italian
> Court on the merits of the charterers' claim would be recognized or enforced
> in England.

84 In respect of the presumed sensitivities of the Italian court, Leggatt LJ
said (at p 95):

> For my part, I do not contemplate that an Italian Judge would regard it as
> an interference with comity if the English Courts, having ruled on the scope
> of the English arbitration clause, then seek to enforce it by restraining
> the charterers by injunction from trying their luck in duplicated
> proceedings in the Italian Court. I can think of nothing more patronising
> than for the English Court to adopt the attitude that if the Italian Court
> declines jurisdiction, that would meet with the approval of the English
> Court, whereas if the Italian Court assumed jurisdiction, the English Court
> would then consider whether at that stage to intervene by injunction. That
> would be not only invidious but the reverse of comity.

85 Millett LJ agreed with Leggatt LJ. In his judgment, Millett was less
restrained, saying at p 96 (emphasis added):

> In my judgment, the time has come to lay aside the ritual incantation that
> this is a jurisdiction which should only be exercised sparingly and with
> great caution. There have been many statements of great authority warning of
> the danger of giving an appearance of undue interference with the
> proceedings of a foreign Court. Such sensitivity to the feelings of a
> foreign Court has much to commend it where the injunction is sought on the
> ground of forum non conveniens or on the general ground that the foreign
> proceedings are vexatious or oppressive but where no breach of contract is
> involved. In the former case, great care may be needed to avoid casting

86 In the present case, with the greatest of respect, it would appear to me
that if Clause 19 is an arbitration agreement, continuation of the proceedings
in the Colombo High Court would constitute a breach by Sri Lanka of her
obligations under the New York Convention, of which Article II provides as
follows:

> 1\. Each Contracting State shall recognise an agreement in writing under
> which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences
> which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined
> legal relationship, whether contractual or not, concerning a subject-matter
> capable of settlement by arbitration.
>
> 2\.
>
> 3\. The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter
> in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of
> this Article, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to
> arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void,
> inoperative or incapable of being performed.

87 The submission in Clause 19 is to arbitration under the SIAC Rules. Rule
26.1 provides as follows:

> 26.1 The Tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction,
> including any objections with respect to the existence, termination or
> validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration
> agreement which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement
> independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the Tribunal
> that the contract is null and void shall not entail _ipso jure_ the
> invalidity of the arbitration agreement.

Therefore the parties would be deemed to have agreed that any dispute as to
the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal be determined by that tribunal.

88 As the Plaintiffs application was made under the Arbitration Act, it would
be instructive to consider the parliamentary materials to divine the
legislative intention. The International Arbitration Bill which was passed by
Parliament on 31 October 1994 and its long title states as follows:

> An Act to make provision for the conduct of international commercial
> arbitrations based on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration
> adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and
> conciliation proceedings and to give effect to the New York Convention on
> the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and for matters
> connected therewith.

89 The following are excerpts from the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary
to the Minister for Law when he moved the Bill a second time (emphasis added):

> the Ministry and the Attorney-General's Chambers would review our
> legislation _to ensure adequate legal support for Singapore's
> regionalisation drive_. In this regard, the adoption of international
> conventions and model laws which harmonise and facilitate international
> trade and dispute settlements would be considered. This Bill will provide a
> legal framework to resolve international commercial disputes by arbitration
> The Bill will mainly implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on International
> Commercial Arbitration on an "opt-out" basis. It is crafted in such a way as
> to be acceptable to lawyers from both of the world's major legal systems,
> ie, the common law and civil law systems. Sir, the Model Law accords _full
> liberty to parties_ in non-domestic arbitrations _to choose laws and
> arbitrators to resolve their disputes_ with minimal intervention from
> domestic courts. Since the Model Law's adoption by the UN General Assembly
> in 1985, it has gained widespread acceptance. The 1985 Economic Committee
> recommended that _to develop into a centre for legal services_ , we should
> speed up the settlement of commercial disputes and set up an international
> commercial arbitration centre. The SIAC commenced operations in 1991. This
> Bill will facilitate the settlement of commercial disputes in Singapore. As
> Singapore businessmen expand overseas, there will be greater contacts with
> foreign parties. Currently, foreign businessmen are uncomfortable with
> unfamiliar arbitration laws and excessive intervention from local courts if
> they select Singapore as the venue for arbitration. They will therefore
> _welcome the application of the Model Law in Singapore_. Sir, _international
> arbitration is a highly competitive business_. Businessmen are able to
> choose from _a variety of attractive international centres_ including Hong
> Kong, Hawaii, Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne and Vancouver. Currently, a glaring
> disadvantage of the SIAC is the non-applicability of the Model Law in
> Singapore. The Law Reform Commissions and Legislatures of Commonwealth
> countries which have adopted the Model Law have stated that the Law would
> assist the development of their respective international arbitration
> centres. The Hong Kong experience suggests that the adoption of the Model
> Law will sharpen the competitive edge of the SIAC. Since 1990, when the
> Model Law was introduced in Hong Kong, a significantly higher number of
> cases have been referred to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre.
> From the initial nine cases in 1985, this number increased incrementally
> from 20 in 1986 to 45 in 1989. Thereafter, the number of cases increased
> significantly from 54 in 1990, ie, when the Model Law was introduced, to 185
> in 1992. Part II also contains the modifications and clarifications we have
> made to clarify and improve the Model Law. This was done after studying the
> experiences of other countries and consulting the UNCITRAL Secretariat. The
> reason for this approach is to let foreign businessmen and lawyers know at
> the outset the changes that have been made to the Model Law. This will
> _facilitate their choice of Singapore as a venue for their cases_. Apart
> from implementing the Model Law, Part II will introduce additional
> provisions which will _facilitate arbitrations_. These provide for the
> confidentiality of court proceedings arising from arbitrations, conciliation
> proceedings prior to arbitration, immunity of arbitrators for negligence and
> mistakes, invoking the assistance of the courts in enforcing interim orders
> or directions, allowing the arbitrators to adopt "inquisitorial processes"
> in the Civil Law tradition, awarding of interest and taxation of arbitration
> costs by the Registrar of the SIAC. . the reasons why Singapore should adopt
> the Model Law are as follows: Firstly, the Model Law provides a sound and
> internationally accepted framework for international commercial
> arbitrations. Secondly, the general approach of the Model Law will _appeal
> to international businessmen and lawyers_ , especially those from
> Continental Europe, China, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam who may be
> unfamiliar with English concepts of arbitration. This will _work to
> Singapore's advantage as our businessmen expand overseas_. Thirdly, it will
> _promote Singapore's role as a growing centre for international legal
> services and international arbitrations_.

90 It can be seen that one major purpose of the Bill is to promote Singapore
as an international centre for arbitration by facilitating arbitrations that
are held here. That Bill was the result of a review of our legislation to
ensure adequate legal support for Singapores regionalisation drive. There are
many formidable competitors in this area and the Act was enacted to enhance
Singapores position as a centre for international legal services and
international arbitrations. The intention of the Bill is to promote the growth
of Singapore as a venue for international arbitrations and the Courts must do
their part by taking a robust approach when faced with applications under s
12(6).

91 This is also the attitude of the English courts as manifested by their
Court of Appeal in _The Angelic Grace_. I should add that this is entirely
consistent with the principle that parties be made to abide by their agreement
to arbitrate. Furthermore, the New York Convention obliges state parties to
uphold arbitration agreements and awards. Such an agreement is often
contravened by a party commencing an action in its home courts. Once this
Court is satisfied that there is an arbitration agreement, it has a duty to
uphold that agreement and prevent any breach of it. Accordingly, I am of the
opinion that the anti-suit injunction should be continued until further order.
Therefore the Defendants application to set aside the anti-suit injunction is
dismissed.

**

The prohibitive injunction

**

92 I turn to the prohibitive injunction, under which the Defendants are
restrained from dealing with the commercial rights which form the subject
matter of the MRA until further order. The Defendants submit that the
Plaintiffs have not made out a case for the Court to exercise its discretion
to grant the prohibitive injunction. In particular the Plaintiffs have not
established that:

(a) they have a good arguable case for their claim against the Defendants;

(b) damages will not be an adequate remedy for the Plaintiffs; and

(c) damages will be an adequate remedy for the Defendants.

_

Good arguable case

_

93 In respect of the first ground, this is the Defendants submission. Clause 1
of the Terms of Settlement provides that:

The parties hereby agree that upon the breach of any of the terms 1(a), (b),
(c) or (d) referred to above on the due dates, the agreement shall cease to
operate as and from the said date.

The Defendants point out that the Plaintiffs had admitted that the Clause 1(a)
payment was made after the scheduled payment date in the MRA although they
maintain that there was an agreement between the parties that, pending the
Defendants payment to the Plaintiffs of sums in respect of access feeds
provided by the Plaintiffs to local broadcasters and revenues from local
sponsorship sales, the Plaintiffs would not be required to effect the Clause
1(a) Payment. The Plaintiffs alternative submission is that the Defendants had
waived any breach by the Plaintiffs in respect of the Clause 1(a) payment and
had continued to affirm the MRA until the time that the Clause 1(a) payment
and the Clause 1(b) payment had been effected. The Defendants say that Clause
20 of the MRA provides that no variations of the MRA shall be effective unless
agreed in writing and signed by the duly authorised representatives of the
Defendants and the Plaintiffs. The Defendants submit that, accordingly, the
Plaintiffs do not have a good arguable case for the injunction sought.

94 The Plaintiffs response is as follows. By their conduct between 1 October
2001 to 16 October 2001, the Defendants had waived the requirement that the
Plaintiffs effect payment of the Clause 1(a) Payment by 30 September 2001. The
Defendants were notified by their bankers on 15 October 2001 that the Clause
1(a) payment had been received for the credit of the Defendants. But despite
having been notified of the receipt of the Clause 1(a) payment the day before,
the Defendants (on 16 October 2001) sent a letter to the Plaintiffs alleging
that the Clause 1(a) payment had not been made and furthermore, instituted the
Second Action alleging that the MRA ceased to operate by reason of an alleged
failure to make the Clause 1(a) payment and claimed US$50,000.00 in relation
to that payment. Prior to their receipt of the Defendants notification of 16
October 2001, the Plaintiffs had not only given instructions to their bankers
to meet the Plaintiffs obligations under the Clause 1(a) payment, the Clause
1(b) payment and the Clause 1(d) Guarantee but had also informed the
Defendants of their having done so. Having waived their right to require
payment of the Clause 1(a) payment by 30 September 2001, the Defendants are
precluded from enforcing the said right or relying on the automatic cessation
clause without first giving to the Plaintiffs reasonable notice of their
intention to do so.

95 In respect of the Defendants contention that Clause 20 of the MRA forbids
variations unless duly signed in writing, the Plaintiffs point out that
Clauses 8 and 10 of the Terms of Settlement provide as follows:

(a) Clause 8 stipulates that "the parties agree that upon the terms of
settlement now entered herein the aforesaid [MRA] will continue to operate and
subsists as amended by these terms of settlement and these terms will be
treated as part and parcel of the said agreement"; and

(b) Clause 10 stipulates that "[t]he parties will be free to amend and/or vary
these terms and the said agreement by mutual agreement without further
reference to the Court".

96 The Plaintiffs submit that there is therefore a good arguable case or at
least a serious question to be tried as to whether there is a dispute between
the Defendants and the Plaintiffs on whether:

(i) There was an agreement to defer the Clause 1(a) payment;

(ii) Clause 20 of the MRA (read with Clauses 8 and 10 of the Terms of
Settlement) require any agreement for variation to be agreed in writing and
signed by the duly authorised representatives of the Defendants and the
Plaintiffs; and

(iii) There had been a waiver by the Defendants, on the basis of the
Defendants conduct up to the time that the Plaintiffs obligations under the
Clause 1(a) payment, Clause 1(b) payment and the Clause 1(d) Guarantee had
been satisfied, for the making of the Clause 1(a) payment by 30 September
2001.

97 I agree with the Plaintiffs on this point and hold that there is a serious
question to be tried and so hold.

_

Whether damages adequate remedy for the Plaintiffs

_

98 On the question of whether damages would be an adequate remedy for the
Plaintiffs, they contend as follows:

(i) Irreparable damage will be caused to their credibility, commercial
reputation and standing (particularly _vis-a-vis_ other sports governing
bodies and other sub-licensees with whom they deal) if the Plaintiffs are not
able to preserve the status quo when a dispute arises with their licensor.

(ii) One of the remedies prayed for by the Plaintiffs in the arbitration is
specific performance by the Defendants of their obligations under the MRA. If
the prohibitive injunction, which has a countervailing effect to the Sri Lanka
default judgement, were discharged the Defendants would, pending adjudication
in the arbitration, be able to enforce the default judgement in jurisdictions
outside Sri Lanka. Irreparable damage would be caused to the Plaintiffs as the
Defendants ability to deal freely with the commercial rights pending
adjudication by the tribunal would tantamount prejudging against the
Plaintiffs of the merits of their claim for specific performance.

99 In response to the first point, the Defendants point out that under Clause
16.3 of the MRA the Plaintiffs cannot recover damages for injury to their
reputation or loss of credibility. Clause 16 is entitled "LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY/INDEMNITY" and it sets out five circumstances in which the liability
of the respective parties are either limited or not limited. Clause 16.3
states as follows:

> Under no circumstances shall either party be liable to the other under this
> Agreement for any actual or alleged indirect loss or consequential loss
> howsoever arising suffered by the other, including, but not limited to, loss
> of profits, anticipated profits, savings, business or opportunity or loss of
> publicity or _loss of reputation or opportunity to enhance reputation or any
> other sort of economic loss_.

The Defendants submit that in view of this provision, the Plaintiffs are not
entitled to any damages caused to their credibility, commercial reputation and
standing which would fall within the words underlined. Therefore the issue of
adequacy or otherwise of damages for such losses is irrelevant in considering
whether or not to grant an interim injunction.

100 The Plaintiffs disagreed with this and submitted that where damages are
nominal or insubstantial, it is all the more appropriate to grant specific
relief rather than damages since damages would clearly not be an adequate
remedy. They cite the decision of the House of Lords in _Beswick v
Beswick_[1967] 2 All ER 1197 and the High Court in _Chua Kwok Fun Kevin & Anor
v Etons Management Consultants Pte Ltd_ [2000] 3 SLR 337. I must confess I
fail to see the relevance of those authorities which concern matters in which
damages are clearly inadequate. In _Beswick v Beswick_ , the appellant had
contracted to pay an annuity to the respondent for the remainder of her life
and the court ordered specific performance of that term. In _Chua Kwok Funs
case_ the High Court ordered specific performance of a term in the settlement
agreement that stipulated that the defendant should provide a bank guarantee
to secure payment of a certain sum due at a later date. In my view, the
Plaintiffs had agreed in the MRA that they would not be entitled to damages
for loss of reputation. So there is nothing to preserve. Furthermore, the test
must be whether it would make a material difference if the injunction is
continued or is discharged. If the Plaintiffs succeed in the arbitration their
position is vindicated in the eyes of the world. I cannot see how such
vindication would be any less effective if there is no interim injunction.

101 As regards specific performance, the Defendants agree that it is true that
if they were to be allowed to enter into fresh contracts covering the subject-
matter of the rights of the MRA, that would result in an alteration of the
status quo which would be difficult if not impossible to reverse if the
Defendants were ultimately held to be entitled to specific performance.
However, in order to justify the grant of an interim injunction, it is not
enough for the applicant simply to show that not granting the injunction will
result in the alteration of the status quo. The applicant must show that
damages would not be an adequate remedy. The Defendants also point out that
the Plaintiffs are a business. Their purpose, as stated in Mallinsons
affidavit, is to produce and distribute live coverage of and market cricket
events world-wide and other sports events in South Asia. As a business, the
Plaintiffs purpose is to earn a profit and not to hold contracts for the sake
of holding contracts. The subject-matter of the MRA is not like real property
or a work of art which have utility or aesthetic value in and of itself that
warrants the intervention of the Court to preserve it pending the resolution
of a dispute. The subject-matter of the MRA is merely the means to an end,
that end being the making of profits. The Defendants submit that a contract
entered into to earn a profit is the quintessential contract for which damages
will be an adequate remedy, if breach be proved.

102 On this issue, I agree with the Defendants submissions and hold that
damages are an adequate remedy for the Plaintiffs.

 _Whether damages adequate remedy for the Defendants_

103 As to whether damages would be an adequate remedy for the Defendants, they
first of all point out that the Plaintiffs are a two-dollar company. They fear
that if an award of damages is made against the Plaintiffs, they would be
unable to pay it. In response to this point on their ability to pay, the
Plaintiffs point out that at the time of the purported termination of the MRA,
the Plaintiffs had been up to-date with all their payment of rights fees. The
Plaintiffs have so far paid an amount in excess of US$10 million in rights
fees to the Defendants under the MRA and**** there is presently a sum of
US$700,000 that the Defendants have retained to account.**** In my view this
is a matter of obtaining fortification from the Plaintiffs shareholders if an
injunction is otherwise warranted and I need not take this point any further.

104 The principal point of the Defendants is that, being the statutory body
charged with being the guardian of Sri Lankan Cricket, they have a duty to
ensure promotion of the sport in the country. Prompt payments by purchasers of
broadcast rights is their lifeblood. The broadcasting revenue stream is
principally what enables the Defendants to meet the outgoings associated with
organising and staging cricket matches. The effect of enjoining the Defendants
from making alternative arrangements to sell broadcast and other rights upon
the termination of the MRA is akin to depriving a person of the ability to
earn a living. With the sanction of the Sri Lankan Order of Court dated 16
October 2001 and 7 November 2001, which remain in full force, and in the
performance of their duties as a Sports Body, the Defendants have made
arrangements to televise Sri Lankan cricket matches and to exploit the
commercial rights associated therewith in the interests of the Sri Lanka.

105 The Plaintiffs have not made any response that deals squarely with this
point. I would also add that the subject matter of the MRA is a perishable
commodity in that the live broadcasts of the Test matches cannot await the
resolution of the dispute in the arbitration. The matches will be played and
if the Defendants are unable to deal with the commercial rights, then their
value will be irretrievably lost. I would agree with the Defendants that
damages would not be an adequate remedy for them.

_

Balance of convenience

_

106 I hold that because damages would be an adequate remedy for the Plaintiffs
but not for the Defendants, the balance tilts in the Defendants favour.
Therefore the prohibitive injunction ought to be discharged and I order
accordingly.
