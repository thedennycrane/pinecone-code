The punishment prescribed under s 6(a) of the Act is a fine not exceeding
$100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. The
district judge below convicted the appellant of both charges and sentenced him
to imprisonment for a term of nine months on each charge, with both sentences
to run concurrently. The appellant appealed against both conviction and
sentence. I dismissed the appeal for the reasons set out below.  
  
**_The prosecution`s case_**

****

The prosecution`s case was that the appellant received two corrupt payments
from Chua Tiong Tiong (also known as Ah Long San or Ah San) (`Chua`) on two
occasions between June and July 1998. The appellant received these payments by
way of money put into an envelope and delivered to his letterbox. The payments
were corrupt as they were allegedly given by Chua as an inducement to the
appellant to help enquire into police investigations in which Chua was
interested.  
  
Senior Staff Sergeant Ong Teng Chai (PW1) of Geylang Police Division testified
of a raid carried out on 15 June 1998 at a flat in Geylang East Avenue 3 (the
`premises`) for suspected money-lending activities. At the premises, 12
persons were detained, one of whom was Chua`s brother, Chua Tiong Chye. When
PW1 was going down from the premises to pick up vans to transport the 12
detainees back to Geylang Police Division, he received a page from the
appellant. When he returned the call, the appellant asked him where he was and
whether he was conducting a raid in Geylang. Later, PW1 was back in the
premises at Geylang, he was informed by a radio operator from Geylang Police
Division that there was someone called `Ah Long San` at the void deck of the
premises who wanted to come up to see them. However, PW1 told the operator
that he did not wish to see anyone.  
  
The next day, the appellant called PW1 again at least three or four times to
enquire about the status of the persons arrested in the raid. On one of those
occasions, the appellant mentioned to PW1 that `Ah Pui` was not happy.
Apparently, Chua was introduced as `Ah Pui` to the appellant when they first
met in 1996.  
  
Staff Sergeant Choo Kwang Meng (PW2), also from Geylang Police Division, was
PW1`s partner in the conduct of the raid at the premises. PW2 testified that,
as he and PW1 were going back to Geylang Police Division to bring some vans to
fetch the detainees of the raid, PW1 informed him of a page from a Chinese man
named William Fong, who was making an enquiry as to whether PW1 was conducting
a raid in the Geylang area.  
  
Lim Hock Ghee (PW3) was Chua`s former driver. He testified that, on two
occasions between June and July 1998, on Chua`s instructions, he had delivered
two envelopes to the mailbox of the appellant`s residential address. PW3`s
evidence was that Chua had told him that the envelopes contained `insurance
money`.  
  
Vincent Lem (PW6) was a police officer attached to Jurong Police Division and
was also involved in the raid at the premises on 15 June 1998. PW6 was
acquainted with Chua and he stated in cross-examination that Chua was involved
in money-lending activities during the period from October 1997 to June 1998.
PW6 had also seen the appellant with Chua once, either in late 1997 or in
early 1998 at Lido Palace Nite Club and had observed that Chua and the
appellant were friends. On that occasion, Chua had introduced the appellant to
PW6 as William from Ang Mo Kio Police Division. The appellant then introduced
himself to PW6 and said that `Ah San is a good man`.  
  
Hassan bin Ahmad (PW7) was a former Assistant Superintendent of Police and had
been the appellant`s coursemate during a course conducted at the Police
Academy from October 1997 to August 1998. The prosecution sought to adduce
evidence through PW7 that on one occasion when the appellant was at the Police
Academy attending a course, Chua had called up to ask the appellant to help
him screen someone leaving the State. However, PW7 turned hostile and the
prosecution then attempted to impeach his credit with his previous statement
to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (`CPIB`). Paragraphs 29 and 30
of PW7`s CPIB statement were as follows:

> _
>
> 29 I would like to state that William Fong told me during `C` course when we
> were sitting around the vicinity of the barracks when a call came in for him
> and after he hung up the phone, he told me that Ah San had asked for his
> help to screen someone who was leaving the State. I presumed that someone
> would be one of Ah San`s friends. Screening would mean finding out if the
> person was on the Immigration Stop List
>
> 30 William told me that he had a way of finding out if the person was on the
> stop list without having to submit a performa. I presumed that since William
> was confined to the Police Academy he must have called over the phone to
> instruct his ops room to give him any details on whether the person
> mentioned by Ah San was on the stop list.
>
> _

  
  
PW7 challenged the voluntariness of his CPIB statement. Following a voir dire,
the district judge found that his statement was made voluntarily and
accordingly admitted the contents of the statement in evidence. The district
judge found that PW7`s explanation for the inconsistency between his evidence
in court and his statement, namely, that the statement was inaccurate, was
unsatisfactory. Thus, the district judge found that PW7`s credit was impeached
and disbelieved his evidence in court in this regard.  
  
**_The defence_**

****

The appellant joined the Police Force in 1986 as a constable and he became an
Assistant Inspector in 1996. He had first met Chua in 1996. When he met Chua
again a year later, the appellant gathered from his sources that Chua was also
known as Ah Long San and that Chua had given up his illegal money-lending
business sometime back. By 1997, the appellant and Chua had become friends
and, by mid-1998, they had become close friends despite Chua`s past. The
appellant was also a very keen soccer fan and when he learnt that Chua was
betting on the 1998 World Cup soccer competition games, he placed `piggyback`
bets together with Chua`s bets for amounts between $100 to $250. Initially,
the appellant and Chua met to square up winnings and losses. However, when
such an arrangement became inconvenient, they agreed that the appellant`s
winnings should be delivered to his letterbox. The delivery of money on the
two occasions by PW3 to the appellant`s letterbox were the appellant`s
winnings.  
  
As for the enquiry that the appellant had made of PW1 on 15 June 1998
regarding the raid, the appellant claimed that he had made the enquiry on
behalf of one Ah Huat. The appellant admitted making three further calls to
PW1 the next day to enquire about the same matter. He asserted that all he had
wanted to know was whether the person in whom Ah Huat was interested had been
arrested and if he would be charged. Ah Huat was not called to give evidence.
The appellant maintained that his enquiry had nothing to do with Chua and he
also denied having done any screening for Chua.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

Having observed the witnesses and weighed the evidence, the district judge
found the prosecution witnesses, with the exception of PW7, to be reliable and
credible. He found that there was no reason for the court not to accept their
evidence.  
  
The district judge found, however, that the appellant was not a witness of
truth after having observed his demeanour and weighed his testimony with the
evidence presented before the court. In particular, the appellant had
initially denied to the CPIB that he had received money delivered to him by
PW3 and he had also denied making enquiries of PW1 about the raid on 15 June
1998. However, these matters were admitted by the appellant himself in his
further statements to the CPIB. The district judge found that the appellant`s
explanations for his initial denials were far from satisfactory. The district
judge also found that the appellant`s story of the money he received being
winnings from the World Cup bets was an afterthought that was invented between
the time when he was first asked about the payments and the time when he
finally admitted to having received them.  
  
The district judge also accepted and considered the evidence of PW7 contained
in paras 29 and 30 of his CPIB statement, namely, that the appellant had
informed PW7 of Chua`s request for a screening to be done.  
  
Having found that the prosecution had proven its case against the appellant
beyond reasonable doubt, the district judge convicted the appellant on both
charges and sentenced him to imprisonment of nine months on each charge, with
both sentences to run concurrently.  
  
**_The law_**

****

Section 6(a) of the Act states as follows:

> _
>
> 6 If -
>
> (a) any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts
> to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any
> gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or
> for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal`s
> affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or
> disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business;
>
> ...
>
> he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine
> not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years
> or to both.
>
> _

  
  
In order to establish the charges under s 6(a) of the Act against the
appellant, the burden was on the prosecution to prove the following four
elements beyond a reasonable doubt ( **Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP** [1998] 2
SLR 592  at 613):

(i) acceptance of gratification;

(ii) as an inducement or reward;

(iii) there was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction; and

(iv) the appellant accepted the gratification with a guilty knowledge.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

The appellant`s main grounds of appeal appeared to be as follows:

(a) the district judge erred in finding that the appellant had accepted the
money from Chua as an inducement for showing favour to Chua by making
enquiries into the status of police investigations in which Chua was
interested;

(b) the district judge erred in finding that there was an objectively corrupt
element in the transaction; and

(c) the district judge erred in finding that the appellant had accepted the
money from Chua with a guilty knowledge.  
  
Essentially, the appellant`s basis for the appeal was that, apart from the
first element of the offences under s 6(a) of the Act, ie acceptance of money,
which was admitted by the appellant, the other three elements (the acceptance
of the money as an inducement, the corrupt element in the transaction and the
appellant`s guilty knowledge) were not present in this case.  
  
**_The issues_**

****

  
  
**(a) Whether the appellant had accepted the money from Chua as an inducement
to show favour to Chua by making enquiries into the status of police
investigations in which Chua was interested**

Whether the appellant had accepted the money from Chua as an inducement to
show favour to the latter was a question of fact. After reviewing the evidence
adduced before the court, the district judge accepted the prosecution`s
evidence and rejected the appellant`s evidence with regard to the purpose for
which the money was paid to the appellant.  
  
The district judge found that on the evidence the appellant was enjoying a
mutually beneficial relationship with Chua, in that he was receiving payments
from Chua in exchange for exercising his powers and connections as a police
officer as and when called upon to do so by Chua. The judge also inferred from
the evidence that Chua was cultivating a close association with the appellant
to further and protect his own interests by having the appellant and his
position in the Police Force called upon as and when necessary. It was in this
context that Chua had told PW3 that the envelopes for the appellant contained
`insurance money`. The appellant had allowed himself to be beholden to Chua
and his intention was clearly to enrich himself by abusing his position in the
Police Force.  
  
The district judge`s findings on the appellant`s intention in accepting the
money from Chua were based on his assessment of the evidence before him,
taking into account the veracity and demeanour of the witnesses. In my view,
the judge was entitled to arrive at such findings of fact and there was no
evidence that he had erred in making such findings.  
  
On the face of the evidence, the appellant had shown favour to Chua when he
made at least four enquiries into the status of the raid carried out in
Geylang on 15 June 1998 in which Chua`s brother was detained. The
circumstances surrounding the appellant`s enquiries were suspect. In
particular, the evidence, that Chua`s brother was detained in the raid and
also the call from Geylang Police Division informing PW1 that someone called
`Ah Long San` was at the void deck of the premises in Geylang waiting to see
him, supported the inference that the money which the appellant had accepted
from Chua was in return for making the enquiries for Chua.  
  
Counsel for the appellant argued that enquiring into the status of
investigations could not constitute a favour for the purposes of the charges
faced by the appellant as such enquiries were common. This contention was
rightfully rejected by the district judge on the ground that such inquiries
are usually only conducted by persons having an official interest, such as
other police officers conducting concurrent investigations, or by persons
having a legitimate interest, such as lawyers or next-of-kin, and the
appellant did not fall within any of those categories.  
  
In this regard, it should be noted that it was not necessary for the
prosecution to prove that the appellant`s receipt of money from Chua was an
inducement for a specific corrupt act or favour. It was sufficient for the
prosecution to show that the gratification was given in anticipation of some
future corrupt act being performed. It was stated in the recent case of
**Hassan bin Ahmad v PP** [2000] 3 SLR 791  at [para ] 20:

> _... It was therefore not necessary for the prosecution to prove a nexus
> between each receipt and a particular act; it only sufficed to demonstrate
> that the payments were not made innocently, but to purchase the recipient`s
> servitude. This is the essence of being `bought over` - that the recipient
> of the gratification be at the beck and call of the payor, prodded into
> action by his recollection of the payor`s generosity even when no specific
> act was demanded at the time of payment._

  
  
This was exactly what happened in this case when the district judge found that
the appellant was receiving payments from Chua in exchange for exercising his
powers and connections as a police officer as and when called upon to do so by
Chua. The appellant had allowed himself to be `bought over` and to become
beholden to Chua.  
  
It should also be noted that in finding corruption under s 6(a) of the Act, it
is not even necessary to prove the actual act of showing favour. The principle
that one can be guilty of taking a bribe, even if it is not proved that he has
shown favour, was recognised in **R v Carr** [1957] 1 WLR 165, **Krishna
Jayaram v PP** [1989] SLR 696 , 702; [1989] 3 MLJ 272, 275 and **R v Mills**
[1978] 68 Cr App Rep 154, 158-159. It is the receipt of the gratification,
together with the intention of the giver and the recipient, that is material.
Indeed, s 9(1) of the Act states as follows:

> _Where in any proceedings against any agent for any offence under section
> 6(a), it is proved that he corruptly accepted, obtained or agreed to accept
> or attempted to obtain any gratification, having reason to believe or
> suspect that the gratification was offered as an inducement or reward for
> his doing or forbearing to do any act or for showing or forbearing to show
> any favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs
> or business, he shall be guilty of an offence under that section
> notwithstanding that he did not have the power, right or opportunity to do
> so, show or forbear or that he accepted the gratification without intending
> to do so, show or forbear or that he did not in fact do so, show or forbear
> or that the act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal`s
> affairs or business._

  
  
**(b) Whether there was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction**

Such an objectively corrupt element can be established by ascertaining the
appellant`s intention in the light of the factual matrix. Whether a
transaction had a corrupt element is an objective inquiry that is essentially
based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man and to be answered only
after the court has inferred what the appellant intended when he entered into
the transaction: **Chan Wing Seng v PP** [1997] 2 SLR 426  at 433.  
  
The district judge found that the appellant, by placing himself at Chua`s
disposal, had not only compromised the integrity of the Police Force but had
also contributed to hindering its core process of maintaining law and order.
He therefore found that the appellant`s intention in accepting the money from
Chua had tainted the receipt of the money with an objectively corrupt element.  
  
Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant`s act of enquiring into
the status of police investigations, and in particular, merely asking whether
the persons arrested were to be `charged or remanded` was not, by an objective
standard, a corrupt act. It is true that the mere act of enquiring into the
status of police investigations is not an objectively corrupt act. However,
the same act in the light of the factual matrix in this case, i.e. coupled
with the acceptance of gratification by a police officer as an inducement to
seek `inside information`, would clearly be a corrupt act by any objective
standard.  
  
I saw no reason to disturb the district judge`s finding that the appellant`s
intention in accepting the money from Chua was to place himself at Chua`s
disposal. I wholly agreed with him that what the appellant had done had the
effect of compromising the integrity of the Police Force and hindering its
core process of maintaining law and order. Such intention on the part of the
appellant, as a police officer, would no doubt cast a shadow on the integrity
of the Police Force in the ordinary mind of a reasonable man. The objectively
corrupt element was clearly established beyond a reasonable doubt in this
case.  
  
**(c) Whether the appellant accepted the money with a guilty knowledge**

The guilty knowledge that must be established for a conviction under s 6(a) of
the Act refers to whether the appellant knew or realised that what he did was
corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard. This is a subjective test:
**Chan Wing Seng v PP** [1997] 2 SLR 426  at 434.  
  
On his finding as to whether the appellant possessed the relevant guilty
knowledge, the district judge stated in his judgment:

> _
>
> 40 The test to be applied here is an objective standard. The accused knew
> that it was improper for him as a police officer to carry a close
> relationship with a person of ill-repute. This would be why he had
> consistently maintained that by the time he and CTT became close friends his
> sources had informed him that CTT was no longer in the money-lending
> business. I was unable to accept the accused`s evidence in this regard. His
> evidence is to be contrasted with that of two other police officers PW1 and
> PW6. Both of them had stated that CTT was a reputed money-lender. PW6 had
> added that CTT was involved in money-lending activities at the material
> time.
>
> 41 Having reviewed the evidence in its totality, I was satisfied that the
> accused knew that what he was doing was corrupt by the ordinary and
> objective standard.
>
> _

  
  
The question of whether the appellant possessed the relevant guilty knowledge
was a subjective one. However, there was still an objective element in that
the guilty knowledge was that of knowing or realising that what he did was
corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard. This objective element was
what the district judge was referring to in para 40 of his judgment when he
stated that, `The test to be applied here is an objective standard`. It was
clear, however, from the context that he was in fact applying a subjective
test in ascertaining whether the appellant had the guilty knowledge. This was
the correct approach.  
  
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the district judge erred in finding
that the appellant possessed the guilty knowledge that what he was doing was
corrupt for the sole reason that the appellant associated himself with a
person of an ill reputation. This argument was misconceived as the district
judge did not find that the appellant possessed the guilty knowledge for the
sole reason that the appellant had associated himself with Chua. It was clear
that the district judge arrived at his finding on the appellant`s guilty
knowledge after `having reviewed the evidence in its totality`. There was no
evidence that the judge had considered irrelevant evidence or had failed to
consider any relevant evidence. Whether the appellant possessed the guilty
knowledge was a question of fact and there was no evidence that the judge had
erred in finding that the appellant in this case possessed the relevant guilty
knowledge.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

It is clear that whether a payment is corruptly obtained and accepted is a
question of fact to be determined by the court in the light of the
circumstances of each case: **Mohamed Ali bin Mohamed Iqbal v PP** SLR 447
[1979] 2 MLJ 58  and **Krishna Jayaram v PP** [1989] SLR 696 , 705; [1989] 3
MLJ 272, 277. The circumstances under which an appellate court may disturb a
finding of fact is limited and, in this case, I could not find any reasonable
grounds on which the district judge`s findings of fact should be disturbed.  
  
I would add that counsel for the appellant, in attempting to cast doubt on the
prosecution`s case, appeared to rely extensively on the fact that Chua was not
called as a prosecution witness. In my mind, Chua would not have been a
helpful witness in view of the fact that, had he given evidence against the
appellant, he would have incriminated himself as well. The question of
intention, in the absence of a confession, is always decided as a matter of
inference from the available evidence and the surrounding circumstances. In my
opinion, the district judge drew the appropriate inferences from the evidence
adduced and I was satisfied that he was correct to find that the appellant`s
intention had been proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.  
  
As for the appellant`s appeal against sentence, I was of the view that his
sentence of nine months` imprisonment on each charge with both sentences to
run concurrently was not manifestly excessive, in consideration of the fact
that he was a law enforcement officer when the offences were committed.
Generally, where a law enforcement officer is convicted of an offence under s
6(a) of the Act, a custodial sentence is appropriate. What the appellant did
undermined the integrity of the Police Force and this was an aggravating
factor to be taken into account.  
  
For the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal and affirmed both the
appellant`s conviction and sentence.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
