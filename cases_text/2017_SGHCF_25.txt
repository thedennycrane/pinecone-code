Introduction

1 These grounds of decision deal with the ancillary matters under Part X of
the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). The Husband is the Plaintiff and
the Wife is the Defendant.

2 Parties married on 7 December 2002 in Singapore, 1

Statement of Particulars at [1(a)] and [1(b)].

(save for a three-month period of attempted reconciliation for the sake of the
children from July to September 2013), the Husband, with the Wife’s consent,
filed for divorce on 10 April 2015 on grounds of the three-year separation. 4

##### Foot Note 4

×

Statement of Claim at [6].

Both parties were legally represented. On 21 May 2015, interim judgment was
granted. The marriage lasted nine years up till the date of their separation
on 1 January 2012 and nearly 12.5 years up until the date of interim judgment.
They have two children, a boy (C1) and a girl (C2), who were of ages 12 and
nine respectively at the time of the ancillary matters hearing. 5

##### Foot Note 6

Wife’s Notice of Appeal in CA 99/2017.

(a) In relation to the division of the matrimonial assets, the Husband shall
pay to the Wife the sum of $1,655,867 within six months from the date of the
order. Each party shall keep the assets in his or her own name.

(b) There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

4 Parties had agreed on: (a) parties sharing joint custody of the children;
(b) care and control being granted to the Wife; (c) access arrangements for
the Husband; and (d) the Husband to pay the children’s monthly maintenance of
$3,800 (this amount being $200 less than what the Wife had asked).

5 I set out my reasons for the orders on the division of matrimonial assets
and on maintenance for the Wife.

The parties

6 The parties are both Singapore citizens and university graduates. The
Husband was 48 years old at the time of my order. He was the Chief Executive
Officer of a major transport service provider based in Singapore, having
assumed the position since 2 July 2012. At the time of the 4 May 2017 hearing,
he had remarried and had a child with his new wife. The Wife was 46 years old
at the time of the hearing. She was working part-time as a Principal
Counsellor at a charity that provided social and welfare services. Her
earnings varied depending on the number of hours worked every month.

Background and context

7 After their marriage in December 2002, parties lived with the Wife’s parents
for six months from December 2002 to June 2003, 7

before renting their own place. When C1 was born in October 2004, they engaged
domestic help. In March 2005, they bought a private apartment in joint names.
No information was provided on their respective direct financial contribution
towards this purchase.

8 It would appear that parties experienced problems in the early years of
their marriage. The Husband deposed in his affidavit that the difficulties
were due to the involvement of the Wife’s extended family in their lives. 8

##### Foot Note 8

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 15 June 2015 at BP-1, [10].

The Wife did not file a counter-affidavit to dispute this.

9 In 2007, the Husband bought another property which was used as their
matrimonial home. The property was held by them as tenants-in-common in
unequal shares (one-fifth in the Wife’s name and four-fifths in the Husband’s
name). 9

##### Foot Note 9

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 17 March 2016 at [5(c)].

It is not disputed that the Husband had, on his own, decided on the purchase
and had paid wholly for it. 10

##### Foot Note 10

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 17 March 2016 at [23].

The Wife said that she was not able to contribute as all her CPF monies were
tied up with the private apartment bought in 2005. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

Wife’s submissions at [40].

10 In January 2008, after the birth of C2 in November 2007, the Wife brought
the two children (then three years old and three months old respectively) to
Kuwait to join the Husband, where he had been working in a new job since
mid-2007. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 17 March 2016 at [32].

The family stayed in Kuwait from January 2008 to April 2010. The background to
the family’s decision to move was, however, contested by the parties.
According to the Wife, the move was to support the Husband’s career as there
were better job prospects for him in Kuwait. The Husband’s account was that
this was a collective decision for the benefit of the family, who could live
independently in Kuwait without the involvement of the Wife’s immediate
family. Another reason was that the Wife could spend time with the children
during their formative years as she would not have to work in Kuwait. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 17 March 2016 at [31].

The Wife had applied for no-pay leave for three years to accompany the Husband
and take care of the family.

11 The Wife would, no doubt, have played a major role in settling the family
into their new home in Kuwait whilst the Husband focused on his job. When the
family eventually returned from Kuwait in April 2010, the Wife also played a
significant part in re-settling the family back into their new home in
Singapore and cared for the children as they were adjusting to their new
schools. 14

##### Foot Note 14

×

Wife’s affidavit dated 1 August 2016 at [16].

12 On their return from Kuwait in 2010, parties sold their private apartment
and deposited the net sale proceeds of about $285,000 (ie, after the refund of
the parties’ CPF monies) into their joint account. The Husband’s case was that
the monies were used over time for household expenses. 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 29 September 2016 at [42].

The Wife’s position was that large sums of monies had been subsequently
withdrawn and kept by the Husband. 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

Wife’s affidavit dated 1 August 2016 at [23].

This latter point was, however, not pursued by the Wife at the ancillary
matters hearing. As stated in [7] above, parties did not provide information
on their direct contribution for purchase of this private apartment. As their
salaries were deposited into their joint account, some credit must be given to
the Wife for her contribution to the household expenses.

13 The Wife said that, when she returned from Kuwait in 2010, she was told
that the government department that previously employed her no longer had a
suitable and comparable position for her. Some months later in January 2011,
she resumed working full-time in a different position.

14 About 22 months after the family returned from Kuwait in April 2010, the
parties, in January 2012, formed the intention to live separate lives. They no
longer shared a bedroom, were not intimate, communicated only on matters
relating to the children and lived under one roof only for the sake of the
children and until such time an agreement could be made on the division of
assets. 17

##### Foot Note 17

Statement of Particulars at [1(c)] and [1(d)].

As the Husband had indicated an intention to leave the matrimonial home from
June 2012, 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

Wife’s affidavit dated 1 August 2016 at [18].

the Wife took no-pay leave from August 2012 to December 2012 to focus on the
household and the children. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

Wife’s affidavit dated 1 August 2016 at [18].

15 The Husband left the matrimonial home in September 2012 and later moved
back in July 2013, when parties attempted an unsuccessful three-month
reconciliation. Despite the unsuccessful reconciliation, the Husband continued
to stay for some time to help C1 with his studies and therapy. He subsequently
left again in November 2014 to live with his then partner, who is now his
wife. He filed for divorce on 10 April 2015, on the basis of the parties’
three-year separation. The Husband continued to provide financial support and
care for the family even though the marriage had broken down in January 2012,
though he pointed out that the Wife had been taking care of her own personal
expenses since February 2014.

Issues

16 The issues which are the subject of the Wife’s appeal relate to:

(a) the division of matrimonial assets; and

(b) maintenance for the Wife.

Division of matrimonial assets

Identifying and valuing the combined pool of assets

17 The parties submitted and filed a revised Joint Summary of relevant assets
on 27 April 2017 (“the Joint Summary”) for the 4 May 2017 ancillary matters
hearing. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

Amended Joint Summary dated 20 April 2017.

It was confirmed then that the matrimonial home had been sold for $2.65m, with
expected net sales proceeds of $1,276,191.83 for division. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

Amended Joint Summary dated 20 April 2017.

18 Based on the Joint Summary and from what transpired during the 24 February
and 4 May 2017 hearings, the Wife had decided not pursue an earlier point that
the Husband had dissipated $1.25m of their assets. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

Minute Sheets dated 24 Feb 2017 and 4 May 2017.

The Joint Summary also showed that although the Wife had argued in her written
submissions that the Husband’s POSB bank account (value of $86,076.41), which
he held jointly with his father, should be included in the matrimonial pool,
23

##### Foot Note 23

×

Wife’s submissions at [43].

this was agreed to be deducted as a liability and was not pursued at the
hearing. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

Minute Sheet dated 4 May 2017 at p2 LL15–17.

The POSB bank account was therefore not subject to division.

19 Parties confirmed at the 4 May 2017 hearing that all matters on the assets
to be included in the matrimonial pool had been agreed upon save for:

(a) the Husband’s claim that a sum of $150,000 be excluded, as the monies
belonged to his father; and

(b) the Husband’s claim that his pre-marital assets of about $557,000 should
be excluded from the matrimonial pool.

Whether the monies amounting to $150,000 were held by the Husband on his
father’s behalf

20 The Husband’s position, as stated in his first affidavit of assets and
means, was that he held a sum of $150,000 on behalf of his father, who had
deposited this sum on 21 March 2011 into his DBS Autosave Account No. XXX-
XXXX17-6 because the latter wanted his help to invest the money and to
“mitigate the risks on his loan from DBS (of which [the Husband was] the
guarantor)”. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 17 March 2016 at [3(b)].

No further information on the DBS loan was provided, but this was not
essential for determination of the issue. The Husband tendered an image of a
cheque dated 21 March 2011 for $150,000 signed by his father as well as a DBS
statement for March 2011 showing a cheque deposit for that sum into his
account. 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 28 September 2016 at [12] and BP-2.

21 The Wife did not dispute the authenticity of the evidence but submitted
that it demonstrated only the fact of the deposit but not the fact of intent.
27

##### Foot Note 27

×

Minute Sheet dated 4 May 2017 at p4.

These were mere assertions as the Husband’s father had not provided a
supporting affidavit.

22 I noted that the Husband’s position on the exclusion of the $150,000 had
been stated in his very first affidavit and maintained consistently throughout
the proceedings. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 27 July 2016 at [29].

After taking into account the case circumstances as a whole, I accepted his
account that these monies were held on behalf of his father and excluded them
from the matrimonial pool.

Whether the assets amounting to $557,000 were the Husband’s pre-marital assets

23 The Husband had, in his affidavit of assets and means, declared that he had
accumulated various pre-marital assets in the form of cash, shares, unit
trusts, a car and CPF monies, amounting to about $557,000. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

Husband’s submissions at [50]; Husband’s affidavit dated 17 March 2016 at
[3(a)].

These were amassed during his ten years of professional work before he married
in his mid-thirties. They had not been ordinarily used or enjoyed, nor
substantially improved upon, during the marriage and were thus not matrimonial
assets. It is notable that whilst the Wife had, in her reply affidavit,
disputed that the Husband held $150,000 on behalf of his father, she was
silent on his proposed exclusion of a much larger sum of $557,000. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

Minute Sheet dated 4 May 2017 at p2.

The Husband therefore argued that the Wife’s subsequent submission, that these
assets of $557,000 should be included in the pool for division, was a change
in position and an afterthought.

24 On the Wife’s part, it was conceded at the hearings on 24 February 2017 and
4 May 2017 that she had not disputed or commented on these alleged pre-marital
assets in any of her affidavits. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

Minute Sheet dated 4 May 2017 at p2.

25 I accepted the Husband’s evidence that the $557,000 assets were his pre-
marital assets and excluded them from the matrimonial pool. 32

Determining the appropriate division of the matrimonial pool

The “structured approach” in ANJ v ANK

27 The structured approach, first set out ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ANJ v
ANK”) (at [17]–[30]), was summarised in three broad steps set out in Twiss,
Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast [2015] SGCA 52 (at [17]),
as follows:

(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each
other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made
towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets (“Step 1”);

(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to
each other, having regard to both indirect financial and non-financial
contributions (“Step 2”); and

(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking
an average of the two ratios above, keeping in mind that, depending on the
circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be
accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more
significance than the other (“Step 3”).

Applying the “structured approach” to the present facts

Step 1: Parties’ direct contributions

28 The issue of direct contributions was not seriously disputed. Parties
accepted the following figures as representing their respective direct
financial contributions to the matrimonial pool: 36

##### Foot Note 36

×

Minute Sheet dated 4 May 2017 at p4.

| Direct Financial Contributions  
---|---  
Husband| Wife  
Value (SGD)| 6,477,500| 546,000  
Ratio| 92.3| 7.7  
  
Step 2: Indirect contributions

29 The issue of indirect contributions, however, was contested by parties.

30 The Husband submitted an indirect contribution ratio of 50:50. His indirect
contributions to the marriage and to family were significant, and these were
not disputed by the Wife. The Wife had, herself, given affidavit evidence that
he “played the role of a good father” and “share[d] a good bond with the
children”. 37

##### Foot Note 37

×

Wife’s affidavit dated 29 June 2015 at [29] and [33].

He gave a diverse range of examples of his contributions. These included
assisting in household chores, making arrangements for family outings and
overseas holidays, supervising the children’s education and enrichment,
sending them to school, and ensuring that the children received appropriate
medical attention whenever they fell ill or were injured. He had, in July
2013, actively supported C1 in his studies and therapy. When C1 fell behind in
Mathematics, he took time off his schedule to teach him and help him with his
homework. 38

##### Foot Note 38

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 27 July 2016 at [36].

With the Husband’s efforts, C1 eventually made it to the top of his class. 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 27 July 2016 at [36].

This latter point was not disputed. Furthermore, it is very likely that a
larger part of the indirect financial contributions would have come from the
Husband, who was working throughout the marriage and earning more than the
Wife. It also bears noting that this was a family that was not extravagant in
their expenditure.

31 The Wife, on the other hand, proposed an indirect contribution of 70:30 in
her favour. She argued that she had sacrificed her career by taking no-pay
leave for three years in January 2008 to accompany the Husband to Kuwait with
two young children as she wanted to support his career and keep the family
together. She claimed to have lost out on an annual income of about $75,000 to
$80,000 (ie, a monthly income of around $6250 to $6666) 40

for each of the three years and on career advancement opportunities. When she
returned from Kuwait in mid-2010, she had to accept a posting at the
government department which was not on par with her previous position, as her
earlier position was no longer available, 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

Wife’s submissions at [51]; Wife’s affidavit dated 1 August 2016 at [17].

and only resumed working full-time in January 2011, when C1 was six years old
and C2 was three years old. She took unpaid leave from August to December 2012
to focus on the household when the Husband left the matrimonial home between
September 2012 and July 2013, and when he left again for a final time in
November 2014. Finally, the Wife highlighted that in January 2014, both
parties had agreed that she would work part-time so that she could care for
her son, who was facing problems with his studies and behavioural problems
that required therapy. 42

##### Foot Note 42

×

Wife’s submissions at [30].

Without her commitment to the family, the Husband would not have been able to
focus on his career and move on with his life.

32 The Husband reiterated that it had been a collective decision to relocate
to Kuwait to be able to live as a family without involvement of the in-laws.
According to the Husband, the Wife had been in Kuwait for 16 out of the 34
months that he was working there, 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

Husband’s affidavit dated 29 September 2016 at [28]–[29].

as she could spend time in Singapore or elsewhere with the children and her
extended family. Moreover, the Wife had had domestic help in both Kuwait and
Singapore.

33 It is clear that the Wife was the main caregiver of the children as the
Husband’s job required him to spend time away for work and travel, and more so
particularly after the Husband left the matrimonial home from September 2012
to July 2013 and again from November 2014 onwards. The Husband, whilst he was
living in the matrimonial home and even after he left, continued to involve
himself actively in the in the children’s well-being, care and studies.

34 In the circumstances, and after considering all the facts laid out by the
parties in their submissions, I found it just and equitable to attribute the
indirect contributions to the marriage in the ratio of 55:45 in favour of the
Wife.

Step 3: Final ratio for division

35 A simple average of the two ratios above yielded an overall ratio of
68.65:31.35 in favour of the Husband. In ANJ v ANK, the Court of Appeal set
out three relevant and non-exhaustive factors in determining if the relative
weightage of the ratios should be adjusted further: (a) the size of the
matrimonial pool, (b) the duration of the marriage, and (c) the nature and
extent of the parties’ indirect contributions (at [27]).

36 The Wife’s position was that equal weightage be given to both direct and
indirect contributions whilst the Husband proposed that direct contributions
should weigh at 70% and indirect contributions at 30% in determining the
overall division. The Husband submitted that the size of the matrimonial pool,
which was accumulated largely by his individual efforts, must be taken into
account.

37 I was not convinced that there was a need to adjust the overall ratio.

38 In arriving at my decision, I was mindful of the Court of Appeal case of
TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“TNL v
TNK”), which considered that single-income families and dual-income families
attracted different approaches to the division of matrimonial assets. The
instant case was one where the Wife had worked full-time, part-time and had
also taken no-pay leave during the marriage for the benefit of the family and
the children, and therefore did not fall squarely within the principles in TNL
v TNK or the principles in ANJ v ANK.

39 I thus turned to the case of Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon [2012] SGHC 92
(“Chan Yuen Boey”), which I found to be helpful. In Chan Yuen Boey, Steven
Chong J (as he then was) observed from a review of the cases, that the
proportion awarded to homemaker wives, who had made modest financial
contributions to marriages with children lasting 17 to 35 years, ranged
between 35% to 50% of the total matrimonial assets (at [34]). He also observed
(at [35]) that the exceptions, where the apportionment in favour of the wife
was less than 35%, typically concerned cases where the total pool of
matrimonial assets had been very substantial and in excess of $100m. In those
situations, the apportionment to the wife had been substantial in its absolute
terms.

40 Measured against this broad observation, I was satisfied that in the
circumstances of this case, my decision to divide the matrimonial assets for
the Wife to receive 31.35% of the assets (amounting to $2,201,867) was just
and equitable. I note that this was not too far from what the Wife herself had
asked for at the 4 May 2017 hearing, when it was submitted that she was
entitled to receive an overall lump sum of $2.21m, which was to include her
share of the assets as well as any lump sum maintenance to be awarded to her.

Implementing the division order

41 On the distribution of the matrimonial assets, I ordered that each party
retain the assets in their own names. As the Wife’s 31.35% share of the total
matrimonial assets amounted to $2,201,867 and she held $546,000 of the
matrimonial assets in her own name, the Husband was to pay the Wife the
balance of $1,655,867. 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

Minute Sheet dated 4 May2017 at p8.

42 At the hearing, counsel requested that the date of payment be deferred
until after the completion of the sale of the matrimonial home, which was
scheduled in July 2017. I therefore ordered that the Husband pay the Wife the
balance of $1,655,867 within six months from the date of my order on 4 May
2017.

Maintenance for the Wife

43 The Husband submitted that the Wife should not be entitled to any
maintenance as she had the earning capacity and the ability to regain self-
sufficiency now that the marriage had ended and the children were older. She
was well-qualified and experienced with a Master’s degree in Psychology.
Before working part-time, she was earning a take-home income of about $7,238 a
month. 45

##### Foot Note 45

Husband’s affidavit dated 27 July 2016 at [11].

Although she had been working part-time to care for the children, she was now
able to take on full-time employment or increase the number of working hours
at her part-time job, as C1 had recently completed his Primary School Leaving
Examinations. She was earning a gross income of $36 per hour and her
employment arrangement as Principal Counsellor with a charity, providing
social and counselling services, did not place a limit on the number of hours
that she could work. The Husband also highlighted that the Wife had been
taking care of her personal expenses since February 2014, 46

care of the children.

44 Based on the available Notices of Assessment, the Wife’s average monthly

Wife’s affidavit dated 31 March 2016 at [21].

At the time of the hearing, she was still working part-time as a Principal
Counsellor at the charity. Her earnings varied depending on the number of
hours worked every month. Her payslip for February 2016, for example, showed
that she had received $3,888 that month for 108 hours of work at $36 per hour.

45 The Wife submitted that she should be entitled to an overall lump sum of
$2.21m, which would include the assets that she was to receive on division
(see above at [40]). 51

Minute Sheet dated 4 May 2017 at p7.

She urged the court to consider that the Husband had a higher earning capacity
and was earning a much higher income. Furthermore, she had had to take a pay
cut to care for the children and was not able to make an easy transition into
the work force in her present situation. In this regard, she reiterated that,
due to her commitment to the family and to the marriage over the years, she
had missed out on job opportunities that could have allowed her to attain a
higher income than what she was presently earning. I also noted that her
monthly expenditure was about $4,000, 52

although certain household, healthcare and leisure expenses were shared with
the children and would have been taken into account in the children’s monthly
maintenance, which the parties had agreed that the Husband was to pay (see [4]
above).

46 After considering both parties’ submissions, I ordered that there be no
maintenance for the Wife. She was a qualified professional, who could earn up
to about $7,300 per month, albeit presently employed part-time. In my view,
the Wife, at 44 years old, was well-placed to regain self-sufficiency as she
progressively moves towards a full-time job, especially as the Husband was to
bear the children’s maintenance costs. She works in an area where her skills
are in demand. Given the share of the matrimonial assets awarded to her, which
would provide an adequate buffer for her to make the transition, there was no
need for a maintenance order for the Wife. That the Husband earned an average
monthly income of about $50,000 (inclusive of a car allowance at $4,833) was
one but not a determining consideration. 53

Conclusion

47 For the reasons above, I made the following orders:

(a) In relation to the division of matrimonial assets, the Husband shall pay
the Wife the sum of $1,655,867 within six months from the date of my order.
Each party shall keep the assets in his or her own name.

(b) There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

48 I ordered that each party bear his or her own costs of the proceedings.
