V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the court):

**Introduction**

1 Should a modest cluster housing project in Yio Chu Kang be allowed to share
the same name as an ultra-exclusive luxury resort in Bali where that name is
not a registered trade mark in Singapore? In the present appeal against the
decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in _Amanresorts Limited v
Novelty Pte Ltd_ [2008] 2 SLR 32 (“the Judgment”), we were asked to consider
this question from two angles: first, at common law under the tort of passing
off, and, second, under s 55 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed)
(“the current TMA”), which provides for the protection of well-known trade
marks. To facilitate the reading of this judgment, we set out below the

**The facts**

**_The respondents_**

2 The first respondent, Amanresorts Ltd (“the First Respondent”), was
incorporated in Hong Kong in 1981 while the second respondent, Amanresorts
International Pte Ltd (“the Second Respondent”), was incorporated in Singapore
in 1999. The First Respondent and the Second Respondent (referred to
collectively as “the Respondents”) operate under the umbrella of the
Amanresorts group of companies (“the Amanresorts Group”), which comprises over
80 companies, all of which are either wholly or partially-owned subsidiaries
of Silverlink Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands. The Amanresorts Group was founded in the mid-1980s by Adrian Zecha, a
Javanese-born Dutch national and businessman.

_The Respondents’ resort business_

3 According to the Respondents’ main witness, Mr Gregory Sirois (“Mr Sirois”),
a director of the Respondents:[note: 1]

The Amanresorts Group’s vision was the creation of a string of exclusive,
ultra-luxury [_sic_] boutique resorts situated at beautiful locations around
the world, with the emphasis on providing impeccable service and privacy.

4 The first of the Respondents’ resorts was Amanpuri, which opened in Phuket,
Thailand, in 1988. Since then, the Respondents have developed a string of 15
other resorts across the world, all with the prefix “Aman” in their names,
namely: Amandari, Amankila, Amanusa, Amanwana, Amanpulo, Amanjiwo, Amangani,
Amanjena, Amansara, Aman-i-Khás, Amankora, Amanbagh, Amangalla, Amanwella and
Amanyara. The Respondents’ resorts (which we shall also refer to as “Aman
resorts”) can be found in many different countries such as India, the US,
Morocco, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. There are even resorts in
more exotic locations such as the misty Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan and the
Turks and Caicos Islands in the sunny Caribbean. Indonesia plays host to five
Aman resorts (one on Moyo Island, one at Borobudur and three in Bali). The
Respondents also own two hotels in France and French Polynesia named Le
Mélézin and Hotel Bora Bora respectively.

5 It is undisputed that quality and exclusivity are the signatures of the Aman
resorts. This is evinced by the numerous international awards showered upon
the resorts as well as the high rankings which they have consistently garnered
in prestigious guides such as _The Gallivanter’s Guide_ (published in the UK)
and _Zagat_ (published in the US). One magazine gushed that the Aman resorts
were “the most exclusive group of intimate resorts and hotels in the
world”[note: 2] while an Australian newspaper proclaimed the resorts to be
“the cocoon of luxury”.[note: 3] Despite the growing number of Aman resorts,
the Respondents have chosen to keep the supply of rooms at these resorts very
small. There are only 626 rooms worldwide between the 18 establishments run by
the Respondents, not many more than the number of rooms usually found in a
single large five-star hotel.

6 As befitting their high standards, the Aman resorts lay claim to be the
playgrounds of the rich and famous – albeit with quiet understatement and
elegant restraint. The following extracts from various reviews raving about
the resorts illustrate this point:[note: 4]

a. “It costs a bomb to stay there, but the rich and powerful seeking peace and
privacy and people who want to treat themselves to a few days of romantic
heaven are jetting in from all parts of the globe …” (The Sydney Morning
Herald, Australia, 1992).

…

c. “… Targeting the top-end consumer who has more money than time, [the Aman
resorts] reign supreme in their particular niche market. Most Aman aficionados
wouldn’t even consider another brand.” (Asian Style Hotels, Singapore, 2005).

d. “Aman Resorts, those purveyors of super-exclusive, superb-luxury hotels,
have opened two resorts in Sri Lanka … The understated, very perfect luxuries
of an Aman resort are usually the preserve of a very wealthy few …” … (Outlook
Traveller, India, 2005).

e. “… [The Aman resorts] are aimed at a more discerning class of [travellers]
(never a ‘tourist’) who are cash-rich, style-conscious and wouldn’t be caught
dead on a standard two-week package holiday to Thailand or Egypt”
(Serendipity, UK, 2005).

[emphasis in original omitted]

People from this “rarefied world of the luxury retreat”,[note: 5] as one UK
newspaper enthused, often become repeat visitors, earning the affectionate
soubriquet, “Amanjunkies”.[note: 6] According to another magazine, the
Respondents can boast of “more than 130,000 self-proclaimed
‘Amanjunkies’”.[note: 7] Such devotees are not deterred by the stratospheric
room rates charged at the Respondents’ resorts (a night’s stay at Amanyara in
the Turks and Caicos Islands, for instance, can cost as much as US$10,900,
excluding a 10% service charge and 10% government tax).

7 One particular Aman resort is of especial interest to us. This is Amanusa,
which opened in Bali in 1992 (“the Amanusa Bali”). It is the latest of the
Respondents’ three resorts on that island. Room rates at the Amanusa Bali
range between US$700 and US$1,500 per night, excluding taxes. The word “aman”
means “peace” or “peaceful” in Bahasa Indonesia, and the word “nusa” means
“island” or “isle”. The phrase “peaceful island” in Bahasa Indonesia is “nusa
aman”, but the Respondents deliberately created an ungrammatical portmanteau
word, “Amanusa”, by inverting the order of the two component words (_viz_ , by
placing “aman” before “nusa”), combining the two words and dropping one of the
‘n’s.

_The Respondents’ residential accommodation business_

8 Apart from the resort business, the Respondents are also engaged in the
residential accommodation business. They claim that they have received many
requests from real estate developers for licences to use the word “Aman” as
well as other words bearing the prefix “Aman” for real estate projects in
return for a “branding fee”. Where the Respondents agree to grant such a
licence, they typically charge a fee of 10% of the selling price of a unit in
the project concerned. As part of the agreement, the Respondents also assume
responsibility for the design of the development as well as for its management
upon completion of construction. Such “branding agreements” have been entered
into with respect to various residential projects in the Turks and Caicos
Islands, Arizona, New York, Mexico and Greece. The development in Arizona
comprises 31 residential units, while the one in New York consists of a hotel-
cum-condominium complex. It is also claimed that the Respondents will be
developing residential projects, to be owned exclusively by them, in New
Delhi, Croatia and Turkey, all bearing the prefix “Aman”.

9 In addition, the Respondents develop and market long-term residential
accommodation known as “Aman Villas”. The Respondents’ first real estate
development of this nature consisted of 31 Aman Villas at Amanpuri sometime
around 1990. Since then, the Respondents have, together with various partners,
developed and marketed Aman Villas at Amanjena, Amangani, Amanpulo, Amanyara
and Amandari as well. According to Mr Sirois:[note: 8]

These “AMAN Villas” are managed by the respective AMAN resort[s] and the villa
owners have the option of placing the villas in a rental pool so that they can
be rented to hotel guests on an overflow basis or as complete villas. …

The “AMAN Villas” … are referred to by appending the word “Villas” or “Homes”
to the name of the respective adjacent AMAN resort, such as AMANPURI Villas,
AMANJENA Villas, AMANGANI Homes, AMANPULO Villas and AMANDARI Villas, and the
association with the [Respondents] and their … resorts and [accommodation] is
strongly promoted.

The Respondents claim that they may in future proceed to develop Aman Villas
adjacent to the Amanusa Bali as their joint venture partner for the resort has
acquired the adjacent land specifically for the development of such villas.

_Other products and services offered by the Respondents_

10 The Respondents have associated luxury goods and services with the name
“Aman”. Mr Sirois stated that:[note: 9]

… AMANPURI … has an accompanying “AMAN Spa”, while certain of the … AMAN
resorts have “AMAN Villas” as accommodation options. Further, the
[Respondents] also offer a collection of high-value experiences for their
guests called “AMAN Experiences” that include, among others, “AMAN Cruises”,
“AMAN Spa Season Retreat”, “AMANGANI in Winter”, “AMAN Weddings”, “AMAN Bali
Experience”, “AMAN Bali Break”, “AMANWANA Komodo Expedition”, “AMANJIWO
Cultural Trails” … and “AMANPULO Underwater Experience”. From or about 2004 or
thereabouts, the [Respondents] have also been selling various beauty spa/
wellness products under the AMAN name.

11 Mr Sirois also pointed out that:[note: 10]

[T]he world-renowned car manufacturer, Toyota, has approached the
[Respondents] for a licence to use an “AMAN”-prefixed name for one of the
models of [its] world-renowned Lexus luxury vehicles.

_The Respondents’ marketing-cum-publicity efforts and the exposure received_

12 The Respondents’ business is a successful one. Worldwide sales from the
goods and services offered by the Aman resorts as well as from other
accommodation related to the Respondents have risen from US$39,480,377 in 1995
to US$86,179,826 in 2006.

13 There are no Aman resorts or residential accommodation bearing the name
“Aman” in Singapore. However, the Amanresorts Group shifted its corporate
headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore in 1999 with the setting up of the
Second Respondent. Since 2001, the Respondents’ international corporate office
and international reservations office have been located in Singapore. The
latter handles approximately 30% to 40% of global reservations and inquiries
which are not directed specifically to individual Aman resorts. In 2006,
revenue from the Respondents’ international reservations office amounted to
US$31,000,000 derived from room reservations, food and beverage services as
well as spa services.

14 Between 1995 and 2005, more than 300,000 Singaporeans visited Bali, where
the Amanusa Bali and two other Aman resorts are located. Of these
Singaporeans, some 1,382 visited the Amanusa Bali between 1995 and 2005.
During the same period, some travel agents in Singapore (as opposed to the
Respondents themselves) also processed reservations for the various Aman
resorts.

15 In 2006, the Respondents spent US$3,399,679 on promoting and marketing
their goods and services globally. Over the years, they have also promoted
their resorts regularly to travel agents and media personnel worldwide,
participated in trade shows, sponsored prizes in charitable events as well as
collaborated with airlines and credit card companies to advertise the resorts
to individuals with high net worth.

16 The Respondents have been distributing newsletters at their resorts,
including the Amanusa Bali, since 1994. These newsletters are distributed to
actual customers and potential customers of the resorts who have signed up to
be on the Respondents’ mailing list. One such newsletter, _Amanews_ , is sent
to over 122,000 recipients worldwide (including over 2,700 in Singapore) every
quarter. The same group of recipients also receive via e-mail a newsletter,
_Aman Express_ , every two to three weeks. In addition, the Respondents send a
newsletter, _Aman Advisory_ , to travel agents, including some in Singapore,
at the same interval (_ie_ , every two to three weeks).

17 Brochures for the Respondents’ resorts are available in Singapore at the
Respondents’ international corporate office and international reservations
office. These brochures are also distributed to travel agents at trade shows
and to guests at business or charitable functions.

18 One particular marketing strategy which the Respondents have employed is
the targeted advertisement of their goods and services to two groups of
American Express card holders – namely, holders of American Express’s
“Platinum” card (“American Express Platinum members”) and holders of American
Express’s “Centurion” card (“American Express Centurion members”) – via the
“Fine Hotels and Resorts Programme” since 1988. A media pack from American
Express describes such card holders in the following terms:[note: 11]

Platinum Cardmembers and Centurion members in Asia are super-affluent and
high-net-worth individuals and are American Express’s highest spenders. They
spend significantly more than other Cardmembers and they have real spending
power, as their card must be paid in full every month. Centurion members spend
20–25 times more than Gold Cardmembers; Platinum Cardmembers spend 8–10 times
more.

There are approximately 900 American Express Centurion members and 4,200
American Express Platinum members in Singapore. The Respondents have similar
marketing arrangements with The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for
holders of its “Platinum” card.

19 As mentioned earlier (at [5]–[6] above), the Respondents’ resorts have been
featured in various newspapers and periodicals around the world. These include
international newspapers and periodicals such as _The New York Times_ , _Far
Eastern Economic Review_ , _Financial Times_ , _Condé Nast Traveller_ , _The
Sydney Morning Herald_ , _etc_. Some local publications also contain
references to the resorts: _The Straits Times_ , _Her World_ and _Female_ ,
for instance.

20 Finally, the Respondents maintain a stable of websites under the name
“Aman” which are hosted in Singapore (“the Respondents’ ‘Aman’ websites”). The
website, <http://www.amanresorts.com>, has been registered since 1996. Other
websites are based on the names of the respective Aman resorts such as the
website, <http://www.amanusa.com/amanusa/home.aspx>, for the Amanusa Bali.
According to the Respondents, in respect of searches for the word “Amanusa”
done via the search engines, Google and Yahoo!, 28 out of the top 30 search
results and all of the top 30 search results respectively contain references
to this particular resort.

_The Respondents’ trade marks_

21 The Respondents own “Aman”-prefixed trade marks in various countries around
the world for the names “Aman” and “Amanresorts” as well as for the individual
names of all the resorts and hotels which they operate (see [4] above for the
full list of these resorts and hotels). However, they have not registered as
trade marks, in each of these countries, the full panoply of these
“Aman”-based names. (The expression “the ‘Aman’ names” will hereafter be used
to delineate, specifically, the name “Aman” as well as the names of the
various resorts and hotels which the Respondents operate, while the term
“‘Aman’-prefixed names” will be used to denote all other names which contain
the prefix “Aman” but _which fall outside the ambit of the “Aman” names_.) In
Singapore, only the names “Amanresorts”, “Amangani”, “Amanjena” and “Amanjiwo”
are registered as trade marks. Notably, the word “Aman” is not, and has never
been, registered as a trade mark in this country. The name “Amanusa” was
registered as a trade mark in Singapore in 1998 under Class 3 (“cosmetics”),
Class 16 (which includes “paper”, “goods made from [paper]” and “printed
matter”), Class 25 (“clothing”) and Class 43 (“hotels”) of the International
Classification of Goods and Services, but the registration was allowed to
expire on 12 November 2001. According to the Respondents, this decision was
made because of a shift in their commercial strategy and for reasons of cost-
effectiveness.

**_The appellant_**

22 The appellant, Novelty Pte Ltd (“the Appellant”), was incorporated on 3 May
2005. It is a subsidiary of Novelty Dept Store Pte Ltd, which was incorporated
on 27 September 1995. The two are part of the larger Novelty group of
companies. The group is involved in the development of residential properties
in Singapore, in particular, condominiums targeted at Singapore citizens and
residents wishing to own private housing or to upgrade from public housing.
According to the Appellant, its developments are successful because of their
reasonable prices, their convenient locations as well as the quality finishes
and furnishings which the Appellant claims it is well known for. The names of
the Appellant’s developments often have a common thematic flavour: _eg_ , the
“Taipan” theme was used for the condominiums, The Taipan, Taipan Jade and
Taipan Regency; and a “metal” theme was used for the developments, Platinum
Edge, Iridium and Vanadium.

23 In July 2005, the Appellant completed the purchase of a 56,355 sq ft
freehold site off Old Yio Chu Kang Road (“the Site”). The Site, a vacant plot
of land surrounded by lush greenery, is situated in a quiet residential
neighbourhood where established private housing estates such as Teachers’
Estate and Sembawang Hills Estate are located. After the purchase, the
Appellant decided with its architect, JGP Architecture (S) Pte Ltd (“JGP”), to
build a cluster housing project (“the Project”) comprising 36 three-storey
terraced houses, each with a basement car park and a roof garden, at the Site.
Various water-based features such as a lap pool and landscaped ponds were to
be added to create a peaceful and soothing atmosphere. The Project would also
feature modern and high-quality amenities and fittings. The Appellant decided
to name the project “Amanusa”.

24 In the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Mr Manoj Dharmadas Kalwani (a
director of the Appellant) affirmed on 5 March 2007, it was claimed (at para
8) that “JGP suggested the name ‘Amanusa’ (meaning ‘peaceful island’ in Malay)
for the [P]roject sometime in August 2005”.[note: 12] At that time, the
Appellant did not know of the Respondents’ resorts or the Amanusa Bali. During
cross-examination, Mr Chan Sze Chin (“Mr Chan”), the concept architect from
JGP, testified that when he and his team were brainstorming for a name for the
Project, they sought a name which would be evocative of the peaceful
surroundings of the Site. They considered the words “aman” and “sentosa”,
which mean “peaceful” in Malay and Bahasa Indonesia respectively, but rejected
the latter because of its association with Sentosa Island. The word
“nusantara”, meaning “archipelago”, was also considered, but it was perceived
as being too long and was thus shortened to “nusa” (meaning “island”) to
convey the image of “an oasis and sanctuary” (see the Judgment at [37]). The
phrase “aman nusa” was chosen instead of “nusa aman” because the former
“rolled off the tongue more easily” (_id_ at [38]). It was also decided that
the two words should be combined and one of the ‘n’s dropped for ease of
pronunciation. While the brainstorming team had not heard of the Amanusa Bali,
Mr Chan admitted that he himself had heard of Amanpuri (the Respondents’
resort in Phuket); he had not, however, foreseen any difficulty with using the
name “Amanusa” for the Project as Amanpuri was, in his view, “completely
different in many aspects from the [Project]” (_ibid_). Mr Chan also claimed
that he had not checked the name “Amanusa” on the Internet.

25 On 8 September 2005, the Street and Building Names Board (“the Board”)
approved the Appellant’s application for the name “Amanusa” to be used for the
Project. This purportedly reinforced the Appellant’s view that the name was
appropriate and acceptable because the Board would not have approved a
proposed name that was identical or substantially similar to the name of an
existing development, whether in Singapore or overseas. For instance, for
another project, the Appellant had proposed the name “Twin Waters”, but that
name had been rejected because there was an existing resort in Australia known
as “Twin Waters”.

26 The marketing efforts for the Project began in January 2006 via newspapers
(_eg_ , _The_ _Straits Times_), Internet advertisements as well as mailers
distributed in Housing Development Board estates at, _inter alia_ , Ang Mo
Kio, Hougang and Yishun. A showflat (“the Showflat”) was also constructed to
promote the Project. The Project was advertised as a “Balinese-inspired”[note:
13] retreat that included a “water-themed backdrop”.[note: 14] The Appellant’s
brochures and advertisements also described the Project as an exclusive
“private hideaway”[note: 15] with luxury fittings.

**_The dispute between the parties_**

27 The Respondents first became aware of the Project on 11 February 2006 after
coming across advertisements placed in _The Straits Times_. A letter of demand
was sent by the First Respondent’s then solicitors to the Appellant on 14
February 2006 demanding that the latter change the name used for the Project.
The Appellant’s then solicitors replied by way of a letter dated 22 February
2006. In that letter, it was stated that the name “Amanusa”, a combination of
Malay words meaning “peaceful motherland”, was appropriate for the Project
given the quiet surroundings at the Site. The letter also stated that the
Appellant had not had any knowledge of the Respondents or their resorts until
the receipt of the letter of demand of 14 February 2006. This explanation
(_viz_ , that the word “Amanusa” meant “peaceful motherland” in Malay) was
repeated in a letter dated 6 March 2006 from the Appellant’s then solicitors
to the First Respondent’s then solicitors.

28 Legal proceedings against the Appellant were commenced on 3 May 2006. The
Respondents asserted that they were the owners of the reputation and goodwill
attached, both in Singapore and worldwide, to the name “Amanusa” as well as to
the rest of the “Aman” names, which were used for (_inter alia_) hotels,
resorts and residential accommodation that were “high-end, top quality,
exclusive” (see the Judgment at [17]). It was alleged that the Appellant, by
using the name “Amanusa” for the Project, had passed off accommodation which
was not the Respondents’, or not associated or connected with the Respondents,
as the Respondents’ accommodation. Furthermore, the Respondents claimed, the
Appellant had made such use of the name “Amanusa” with the intention of
confusing or deceiving members of the public into thinking that the Project
was provided by the Respondents or, alternatively, associated or connected
with them.

29 The Respondents later added a claim under s 55 of the current TMA. They
asserted that the “Aman” names were well known in Singapore to one or more of
the relevant sectors of the public, namely, actual consumers and potential
consumers of goods and services provided under the “Aman” names as well as
members of the hospitality, travel and/or property development industries. It
was argued, relying on s 55(2), s 55(3)(_a_) and/or s 55(4)(_a_) of the
current TMA, that the Appellant’s use of the name “Amanusa” for the Project
was “likely to cause confusion” (see s 55(2)) or, in the alternative, would
indicate a connection between the Project and the Respondents and would be
likely to damage the Respondents’ interests (see s 55(3)(_a_)). (Eventually,
the Respondents came to rely on only s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA.)

30 As a result of the First Respondent’s letter of demand, the Appellant
issued questionnaires to actual and potential purchasers of units in the
Project who visited the Showflat from July 2006 onwards. Some of the questions
included:[note: 16]

…

Q5: What were your reasons/factors for choosing the Amanusa development?

…

Q7: Would you have chosen the Amanusa development if it were called by some
other name? …

…

Q8: Does the name/word “Amanusa” mean anything to you? …

31 Fifty-one responses were collected by the Appellant. It appeared from these
responses that the location and the design of the Project as well as the
amenities which it featured were the main reasons why those who responded to
the Appellant’s survey (“the survey participants”) were attracted by the
Project; none of them cared if the Project had been called anything else. The
name “Amanusa” generally did not mean anything to the survey participants,
although some associated it with “peaceful”[note: 17] or “serenity”.[note: 18]
Two responses in particular are of note, _viz_ , that the name “sound [_sic_]
like a Thai-spa kind of place”,[note: 19] and that the name was “very
Balinese”,[note: 20] evocative of a “top of [the end] – Bali high end
resort”.[note: 21]

32 Subsequently, the Appellant, probably out of caution, apparently told its
sales agents not to link the Project with the Amanusa Bali. Further, all
purchasers of units in the Project had to sign a declaration form
acknowledging and agreeing that their request for an option to purchase and
their subsequent exercise of such option did not confer any right in respect
of the name “Amanusa”, and that that name did not constitute a consideration
influencing their decision to exercise the option to purchase. Sales of units
in the Project were initially not very brisk. By 5 March 2007, more than a
year after marketing began, only 11 of the 36 units had been sold, unlike some
of the Appellant’s other projects which had been sold out within six to eight
months of their launch. However, by the time of the trial, only one unit in
the Project remained unsold.

33 In the meantime, the Respondents engaged the services of two private
investigators, who visited the Showflat in late March 2007. One of the
investigators testified that a sales agent (“Jerry”) said that the name
“Amanusa” was “like [the name of] a resort, there is a resort called Amanusa.
It is a very famous resort …” (see the Judgment at [21]). Another sales agent
(“Jason”) reportedly said that the Project had been named after a very well-
known holiday resort, but was unable to say where that famous resort was
located (_id_ at [22]). Both Jerry and Jason gave evidence at the trial. Jerry
denied making any reference to the Amanusa Bali and claimed that he had only
referred to “resort living” (_id_ at [42]), which was the Project’s selling
point, while Jason said that he had only remarked that the Project was named
after a resort, which he had thought was in some Western country (_id_ at
[43]).

34 By 30 March 2007, the Appellant had substantially changed the contents of
its brochures advertising the Project. Some pictures of a thatched roof and a
waterspout in the shape of a mythical creature were removed. The word
“Balinese” was also omitted. This was the state of affairs when the matter
went to trial in April 2007.

**The decision in the court below**

35 The Judge held that the Respondents’ passing off claim was made out.
However, he declined to find that the Appellant had any fraudulent intention
in using the name “Amanusa” (see the Judgment at [4] and [75]). He also held
that the claim under s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA had been made out (_id_
at [75]). In the circumstances, the Judge granted a declaration that the
“Aman” names were well-known trade marks in Singapore and an injunction
restraining the Appellant or anyone acting on its behalf from using those
names (in particular, “Amanusa”) in relation to any form of accommodation
(_ibid_). He expressly stated that the injunction was “confined to the [‘Aman’
names] and [did] not extend … to all words which include[d] the prefix ‘Aman’”
(_ibid_). The Appellant was also ordered to stop distributing any material
which described the Project as “Amanusa” (see the Judgment at [76]). Finally,
concluding that there was only a likelihood of prospective damage rather than
immediate damage to the Respondents, the Judge held that there was no need to
order an inquiry as to damages or an account of profits (_id_ at [4] and
[77]).

**The passing off claim**

36 Two pronouncements of the House of Lords are generally considered to be the
definitive statements on the requirements of an action for passing off. The
first is from Lord Diplock’s speech in _Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v
Townend & Sons (Hull) Ltd_ [1979] AC 731 (“the _Advocaat_ case”) at 742, as
follows:

… _A.G._  _Spalding & Bros._ v. _A.W. Gamage Ltd._ [(1915) 32 RPC 373] … and
the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must
be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off: (1) a
misrepresentation (2) made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to
prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services
supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of
another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable
consequence) and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of
the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will
probably do so.

The second is a reformulation by Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in _Reckitt & Colman
Products Ltd v Borden Inc_ [1990] 1 WLR 491 (“the _Jif Lemon_ case”) at 499,
as follows (this particular passage was also cited by the Judge at [48] of the
Judgment as well as by this court in _CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac
Marina Pte Ltd_ [1998] 2 SLR 550 (“the _Millenia_ case”) at [86]):

The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition – no
man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be
expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has
to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must
establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he
supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the
identifying “get-up” (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade
description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which
his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-
up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff’s
goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the
defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead
the public to believe that goods or services offered by [the defendant] are
the goods or services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the
plaintiff’s identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services
is immaterial, as long as [the goods or services] are identified with a
particular source which is in fact the plaintiff. For example, if the public
is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a
particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no
public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly,
he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quia timet action, that he is
likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the
defendant’s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant’s goods or
services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.

37 The above _dicta_ unequivocally articulate three clearly identifiable core
concepts which are fundamental to a passing off action, namely, goodwill,
misrepresentation and damage. Since the decision of the English Court of
Appeal in _Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v Marks & Spencer Plc_ [1991] RPC
351, these three elements have been known as the “classical trinity” (at 368,
_per_ Nourse LJ) of an action for passing off. We now proceed to examine
whether each of these elements has been satisfied by the Respondents in the
present case.

**_Goodwill_**

38 Passing off is a tort which protects goodwill and nothing else. Lord
Diplock made this clear in _Star Industrial Company Limited v Yap Kwee Kor_
[1976] FSR 256, where he stated (at 269):

A passing-off action is a remedy for the invasion of a right of property not
in the mark, name or get-up improperly used, but in the business or goodwill
likely to be injured by the misrepresentation made by passing-off one person’s
goods as the goods of another.

As goodwill is the bedrock of this tort, it is unsurprising that one must
properly define in each case what the plaintiff’s goodwill consists of in
order to determine the boundaries of the protection which the plaintiff can
claim. To do this, one must first have a proper understanding of what goodwill
is.

_The nature of goodwill_

39 Like that other great force of attraction which we call “love”, “goodwill”
is ephemeral and hard to define. To date, Lord Macnaghten’s speech in _The
Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Muller & Co’s Margarine, Limited_ [1901] AC
217 (“ _IRC v Muller & Co_”) at 223–224 remains, in our view, the clearest
exposition of what goodwill is:

What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to
define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and
connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom.
It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new
business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a
particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence
may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has a power of attraction
sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.

The above passage highlights two essential features of goodwill. First, it is
the association of a good, service or business on which the plaintiff’s mark,
name, labelling, _etc_ (referred to generically as the plaintiff’s “get-up”)
has been applied with a particular source. Second, this association is an
“attractive force which brings in custom” (_id_ at 224).

_Whether goodwill exists in the “Aman” names_

40 As a preliminary point, we note that it is not contested that the “Aman”
names can be considered as distinctive indicia capable of being the vessels of
goodwill. The evidence in respect of the name “Amanusa” shows that it is a
distinctive and completely made-up name, even though its component parts,
“aman” and “nusa”, have descriptive elements. We thus agree with the Judge’s
finding that the “Aman” names are “fancy mark[s] when used in relation to
hotels and resorts” (see the Judgment at [49]), as well as when used for
projects that are associated with such developments. Needless to say, our
views on this do not extend to the use of the “Aman” names in any other
context.

41 The Judge found that the “Aman” names had “goodwill in Singapore” (_id_ at
[50]) before 2006, when the allegedly tortious conduct by the Appellant began.
With respect, this is a somewhat ambiguous finding because it does not specify
whether the goodwill existed in the minds of the general public in Singapore,
or whether it was operative on only a small section of that public. In other
words, the Judge did not identify _who_ would make the requisite association
of the “Aman” names with the ultra-luxurious hotels and resorts and other
high-end residential accommodation offered by the Respondents. In our view, it
is important to identify the specific section of the public which has goodwill
towards the “Aman” names.

(1) The specific sector of the public to be considered

42 According to the Appellant, the “relevant sector of the public in
Singapore”[note: 22] in this case ought to be “the actual [customers] and
potential customers in the hotel, resort and travel [industries]”[note: 23] –
a very wide group which covers more or less the entire public in Singapore. It
was argued that the Judge ought to have considered whether this widely-defined
group of consumers would have associated the “Aman” names with a specific
source. The Appellant submitted that this group would not have made that
association and, thus, the Respondents _did not_ have any goodwill in
Singapore _at all_ _vis-à-vis_ the “Aman” names.

43 In their submissions in the court below, the Respondents claimed that they
had substantial reputation and goodwill, both in Singapore and worldwide, in
the “Aman” names and “Aman”-prefixed names when those names were used in
relation to hotels, resorts and residential accommodation. However, in their
submissions in this appeal, the Respondents appear to have clarified that they
are claiming goodwill only in respect of “the _high-end_ hotel and resort
market”[note: 24] [emphasis added]. It is argued that “the relevant purchasing
public”[note: 25] consists of actual purchasers and prospective purchasers of
the _Respondents’_ goods and services specifically, and not the wider group of
consumers in the hotel, resort and travel industries.

44 In our view, goodwill is not an all-or-nothing attribute in that it is not
the case that the plaintiff either has goodwill in Singapore or, otherwise,
has no goodwill at all. Clearly, goodwill can be limited to particular
sections of the public. These sections of the public can be small so long as
they are not negligible. However, if goodwill is shown to exist only among a
small section of the public in Singapore, it would mean that, while goodwill
exists in this country, it exists only in relation to that small group and not
to the entire public here at large.

45 In this case, we are of the view that goodwill exists in the “Aman” names
among actual customers and potential customers in Singapore of the Aman
resorts. As we shall explain more fully, this group is quite small, but,
nonetheless, goodwill exists among it. We should also point out that the
goodwill enjoyed by the Respondents covers the “Aman” names only and does not
extend to “Aman”-prefixed names (as defined at [21] above).

46 In the instant case, the Judge noted that “the number of people patronising
Aman resorts or who [were] familiar with [the Respondents’] goods and services
[was] … relatively small” (see the Judgment at [57]). However, he also said
that “a significant body of persons in Singapore” (_id_ at [59]) had heard of
the Aman resorts generally and the Amanusa Bali in particular.

47 The association of the plaintiff’s goods, services or business with a
particular source may operate on only a small section of the public because of
limited exposure of the plaintiff’s get-up in relation to those goods,
services or business. Obviously, such an association can only form in the
minds of those consumers who have been exposed to the plaintiff’s get-up. For
instance, a small local business which is known only to the residents in its
immediate vicinity will enjoy only geographically limited goodwill. In _The
Clock, Ld v The Clock House Hotel, Ld_ (1936) 53 RPC 269, for example, the
plaintiff, which operated a small road-house (known locally as “The Clock”)
offering its guests meals and facilities for bathing, tennis and golf,
succeeded in obtaining a permanent injunction to restrain the defendant, which
operated a hotel five miles away, from carrying on business under the name
“Hotel Clock House”; this restriction, however, applied to the defendant’s
premises only. Obviously, the goodwill which the plaintiff enjoyed in the name
“The Clock” did not extend very far.

48 One of the more striking features about the present appeal is that the main
part of the Respondents’ business is not based in Singapore. The Respondents’
resorts, including the Amanusa Bali, are located overseas. The Respondents’
physical presence in Singapore is limited to that established by their
international corporate office and their international reservations office.
This would suggest a much more limited exposure in Singapore of the “Aman”
names than if there were an Aman resort located right in this country.

49 Furthermore, the Respondents’ resorts, apart from all being overseas, are
located in exotic or relatively inaccessible locations not often frequented by
mainstream tourists from Singapore. Indeed, the Respondents have taken great
pains to keep their resorts low-key; understatement is a hallmark of their
branding (see also [5]–[6] above). This can be seen from an article on
Amanpuri entitled “Millionaires’ retreat”, published in _South China Morning
Post_ on 5 December 1994, which stated:[note: 26]

Perhaps one of the most unusual aspects of all about Amanpuri is that the
resort does not even need to advertise.

…

Guests arriving at Amanpuri will vouch for its low profile stance. There is
not even a sign at the reception declaring the name of the resort. And anyone
venturing away from the retreat by hired jeep, for example, might find
themselves at a loss on the return journey – for there is not even a sign post
from the main road circling Phuket indicating the Amanpuri turn off.

Even the three Aman resorts located in Bali have been deliberately sited in
out-of-the-way places in order to create a sense of exclusivity, seclusion and
privacy. Indeed, in Tom Rao, “Honeymoon Home away from Home” _Wedding &
Travel_ (July 2001), an article on the Amanusa Bali adduced by the
Respondents, the writer stated (_id_ at 177):[note: 27]

If I were to drive, I never would have found the narrow road which turned into
[the] Amanusa [Bali]. That’s how secretly-tucked away this luxury resort is,
situated on a hilltop close to Bali’s southernmost point – Nusa Dua. [emphasis
in original omitted]

50 Even though Bali welcomes many visitors from Singapore every year (see [14]
above), the location of the three Aman resorts on that island means that most
of these visitors are unlikely to come across those resorts in their
peregrinations around the island. At the trial, there was no evidence of the
Respondents’ advertising presence in Bali and the other countries where Aman
resorts are located, but one might reasonably assume that any such advertising
presence would be similarly limited.

51 Absent a prominent physical presence by the Respondents in Singapore and
given the locations of the Respondents’ resorts, the only other means for the
“Aman” names to gain exposure is through marketing and the media. Again, the
evidence in this regard suggests that there has only been very limited, rather
than extensive, exposure of these names thus far. The Respondents apparently
have a policy of not advertising their resorts in the mainstream media.
Instead, advertising is targeted at a select few: for instance, the small
clutch of American Express Centurion members and American Express Platinum
members in Singapore. There have been articles in various magazines on the
Respondents’ resorts, but most of these periodicals are again targeted at rich
individuals, both local and foreign, or other specialist consumers like those
in the high-end travel industry. The Respondents highlighted three examples of
mass media exposure in the form of articles in _Female_ , _Time_ and _Her
World_ , but this sort of publicity was sporadic at best and would have
generated only trivial goodwill in the “Aman” names. This point is significant
for, as Laddie J incisively noted in _Sutherland v V2 Music Ltd_ [2002] EMLR
28 at [22]:

The law of passing off protects the goodwill of a small business as much as
[the goodwill of] the large, but it will not intervene to protect the goodwill
which any reasonable person would consider trivial.

52 With regard to the 20 domain names which have been registered for the
Respondents’ “Aman” websites, no weight should be placed at all on the fact
that those domain names were registered here – that is a purely technical
matter which does not influence the extent of exposure of the “Aman” names.
More importantly, it must be noted that although the Internet has the
potential to be used for giving goods, services and businesses instant
exposure across the entire world, it does not follow that any small, dinky
business can set up a website and then claim that it has gained worldwide
recognition. The Internet’s power of exposure is only a _potential_ power.
This issue was given some consideration in _800-FLOWERS Trade Mark_ [2000] FSR
697 (“the first instance decision in _800-FLOWERS_ ”), which concerned a
dispute over the registration of a service mark. In that case, an application
to register a name as a service mark was objected to on, _inter alia_ , the
ground that the name had not been used in the UK. The applicant sought to
counter this argument by relying on its use of that name for its website.
Jacob J observed very sensibly (at 705):

Mr Hobbs [counsel for the applicant] submitted that any use of a trade mark on
any website, wherever the owner of the site was, was potentially a trade mark
infringement anywhere in the world because website use is in an omnipresent
cyberspace: that placing a trade mark on a website was “putting a tentacle”
into the computer user’s premises. I questioned this with an example: a
fishmonger in Bootle who puts his wares and prices on his own website, for
instance, for local delivery can hardly be said to [be] trying to sell the
fish to the whole world or even the whole country. And if any web surfer
insome other country happens upon that website he will simply say “this is not
for me” and move on. For trade mark laws to intrude where a website owner is
not intending to address the world but only a local clientele and where anyone
seeing the site would so understand him would be absurd. So I think that the
mere fact that websites can be accessed anywhere in the world does not mean,
for trade mark purposes, that the law should regard them as being used
everywhere in the world.

53 The requirement of “use” of a trade mark in a jurisdiction (in the context
of trade mark law) is, of course, pegged at a higher standard than the
standard which applies when determining whether goodwill exists in a name (in
the latter context, exposure, as opposed to use, of the name in question is
the relevant criterion). But, the principle that putting a name up on the
Internet does not translate into instant global presence of that name is
applicable _vis-à-vis_ the analysis of goodwill in passing off actions.

54 It follows that evidence of the existence _per se_ of domain names and
websites featuring the name in which goodwill is said to exist will ordinarily
be insufficient as proof of exposure of that name; something in addition to
proof of the mere existence of such domain names and websites must be shown in
order to establish that there has been sufficient exposure of the name in
question. This approach is not dissimilar to that adopted by Buxton LJ in
_800-FLOWERS Trade Mark_ [2002] FSR 12 (“the appellate court’s decision _in
800-FLOWERS_ ”), which was the English Court of Appeal’s decision on the
appeal and the cross-appeal arising from the first instance decision in
_800-FLOWERS_. In the appellate court’s decision in _800-FLOWERS_ , Buxton LJ
commented, in the context of use of a trade mark, that (at [138]):

[T]he very idea of “use” within a certain area would seem to require some
active step in that area on the part of the [trade mark owner] that goes
beyond providing facilities that enable others to bring the mark into the
area.

Such “active step[s]” (_ibid_), the learned judge suggested, could take the
form of “direct encouragement or advertisement by the [trade mark] owner”
(_ibid_) which led consumers to the website featuring the trade mark in
question. In the present case, the Respondents must adduce evidence showing,
among other matters, the following:

(a) How many “hits” have the Respondents’ “Aman” websites received?

(b) How many of these “hits” came from Internet users in Singapore?

(c) If someone does a search for relevant topics (“resorts in Bali”, for
instance) using any of the major search engines, are the Respondents’ “Aman”
websites included among the top few search results?

(d) How many other major websites (particularly those frequented by consumers
in Singapore) are linked to the Respondents’ “Aman” websites?

In this regard, the only evidence of exposure is that the Respondents’
website, <http://www.amanresorts.com>, has received “millions of ‘hits’” (see
the Judgment at [11]) – but we do not know from where or from whom. Without
such information, we would place little weight on the existence of the
Respondents’ “Aman” websites in assessing the degree of exposure of the “Aman”
names locally.

55 It is also unlikely that the fame of the Respondents’ resorts spread by
word of mouth. As previously indicated (see [14] and [50] above), the number
of visitors from Singapore who have patronised the Amanusa Bali is relatively
small. Even if the total number of visitors from Singapore for all the Aman
resorts were taken into account, this would not yield a very large figure
because of the very limited number of rooms available at the various resorts;
for instance, the Amanusa Bali itself has only 35 rooms. We acknowledge the
Respondents’ point that many luxury brands are widely known among the general
public even though the goods marketed under those brands are purchased by only
a very limited number of consumers. However, such brands would usually have
other means of exposure – whether through marketing or through the ubiquity of
their names in popular culture, _etc_. In the present case, the “Aman” names
did not have such exposure.

56 We are also aware of the impressive sales revenue derived by the
Respondents from their resorts, more than 30% of which is attributable to the
Respondents’ international reservations office in Singapore. However, there is
no evidence as to what proportion of these sales was generated by customers
based in Singapore. Sales generated by customers based overseas are entirely
irrelevant for the purposes of establishing whether there has been exposure of
the “Aman” names in this country and, if so, the extent of such exposure.

57 Finally, while a long-established business is, in general, likely to be
more widely known than a recently-established one, this may not always hold
true. The Respondents’ business has existed since 1988 when the first Aman
resort, Amanpuri, was opened, but, apart from the two offices which the
Respondents maintain in Singapore, the main part of their business is based
overseas. The length of time for which the Respondents’ business has been
operational is thus not of very great weight.

58 In our view, the exposure which the Respondents have succeeded in
establishing is plainly limited to the well heeled. It is these people who
visit the Respondents’ resorts; it is also this group which has been and
continues to be the target of the Respondents’ selective marketing campaign.
In contrast, exposure of the “Aman” names has not been established for other
income groups in Singapore. Some indication of this can be found in the survey
carried out by the Appellant among the visitors to the Showflat, the
overwhelming majority of whom had not heard of the Amanusa Bali or any other
Aman resort. However, we acknowledge that the survey was rather unscientific
and do not place much weight on the results obtained. Further, the drafting of
the questionnaires for the survey left a great deal to be desired. The use of
surveys in trade mark disputes and passing off actions is a very technical
matter and, if evidence based on surveys is to be relied on, it should be
adduced in the form of expert evidence.

59 The uneven pattern of recognition of the “Aman” names among different
income groups in the present case is no accident. It is the result of the
deliberate policy of the Respondents to concentrate their marketing and
advertising efforts on the wealthy. The image which the Respondents seek to
project is one of understated class. A glimpse of this approach can be found
in the following extract from an article in _Time_ , which describes how the
Aman resorts are designed and furnished:[note: 28]

Much of what makes [the Aman resorts] distinctive is how studiously they avoid
most of the signifiers [that] the rest of the hospitality industry employs to
trumpet their properties as “high class”. … The gift shops carry no logo-
branded T shirts or beach towels. There are virtually no logos anywhere,
except on matchbook covers and stationary [_sic_]. And there are certainly no
single-serving plastic bottles of soap, shampoo and hair conditioner in the
shower. [Adrian] Zecha literally shudders at the thought. “So tacky,” he
declares.

There is nothing objectionable about such an approach to marketing and
business, but the Respondents must also be prepared for the consequence that
whatever goodwill they may have in the “Aman” names may be limited in scope.
The English High Court case of _HFC Bank Plc v Midland Bank Plc_ [2000] FSR
176 (“the _HFC Bank_ case”) is instructive in this regard. The plaintiff in
that case (“HFC”) was a bank which adopted the practice of dealing with its
customers in indirect ways: for instance, through introductions from credit
brokers, through retail finance agreements and through its credit card
business conducted under other brand names. As a result, only a small
proportion of its customers were familiar with the name “HFC”. When HFC tried
to stop the defendant (“Midland Bank”) from using a similar name, HFC relied
on the evidence of some of its customers, who claimed to have mistaken Midland
Bank for HFC. Lloyd J held (at 198–199):

What this comes down to, in my judgment, is that in respect of none of these
witnesses had HFC achieved brand recognition. This is not very surprising
given the type of contact between each of [the witnesses] on the one hand and
HFC on the other, the stage that it had got to, and also given HFC’s
deliberate policy of not cultivating general awareness of its brand name among
the public as a whole. …

…

I do not regard any of the six witnesses whom I treat as relevant for this
purpose [_ie_ , for the purpose of determining whether customers were confused
between HFC and Midland Bank] as being people within the scope of HFC’s
established goodwill at the time of [their] respective mistakes [in thinking
that HFC and Midland Bank were the same].

(2) Whether the “Aman” names have an attractive force for custom among the
relevant sector of the public

60 In the present case, even if the “Aman” names were generally known
throughout the whole of Singapore, it would not necessarily mean that the
Respondents have goodwill in those names to that extent. It must be recalled
that goodwill, apart from being an association of a good, service or business
with a particular source, must also be “ _[an] attractive force which brings
in custom_ ” [emphasis added] (see _IRC v Muller & Co_ ([39] _supra_) at 224).
In other words, whether or not there is goodwill attached to a name also
depends on whether or not there are any actual and/or potential customers of
the goods, services or business marketed under that name.

61 One example of a situation where an association with a source is not “[an]
attractive force which brings in custom” (_ibid_) would be where a well-known
good is unavailable for sale. This was the case in _Anheuser-Busch Inc v
Budejovicky Budvar NP_ [1984] FSR 413 (“the _Budweiser_ case”), where the
plaintiff manufactured the well-known “Budweiser” beer in the US. “Budweiser”
beer was not available to the general market in the UK, although it was sold
in American military bases and a limited number of other outlets in the UK on
a duty-free basis. However, the beer was widely known throughout the UK
because of the plaintiff’s publicity efforts as well as tourist and business
traffic between Europe and the US. In view of this, the English Court of
Appeal held (at 464, _per_ Oliver LJ) that the plaintiff could “legitimately
claim that … [it] had a reputation as the [brewer] of a beer, Budweiser, with
a substantial section of the public”. The question for the court, then, was
“whether this reputation associated with a beer which, for practical purposes,
nobody could buy [in the UK], constituted … goodwill in any relevant sense”
(_ibid_). Oliver LJ considered whether the plaintiff’s name could be said to
be an attractive force for custom in the UK, and came to a negative
conclusion. He reasoned (at 469 of the _Budweiser_ case):

[O]ne asks oneself “what custom in this country in 1973 was brought in by the
knowledge of members of the indigenous British public of the [plaintiff’s]
Budweiser beer?” And the answer must be that there was none, because however
attractive [the British public] may have found the idea of drinking the
[plaintiff’s] beer, they could not get it. In so far, therefore, as anyone was
misled by the defendants’ use of the name “Budweiser,” the [plaintiff] could
suffer no damage either by loss of sales, for there were none at that time and
none were contemplated, nor by loss of reputation, because if there was any
such loss (which seems highly improbable) the reputation was quite unconnected
with either an ability or a willingness to supply.

62 A _desire_ to become a customer of the plaintiff, without the _ability_ to
actually be one, cannot ordinarily form the basis of goodwill. A person in
such a position is not even a potential customer of the plaintiff because
there is no way for the latter’s good, service or business to attract his
custom. In such a case, the plaintiff can be described as having a good
_reputation_ among such persons (_ie_ , persons who desire to be, but are
unable to become, the plaintiff’s customers), but that is _not_ the same as
having _goodwill_. This court in the _Millenia_ case ([36] _supra_) cited the
_Budweiser_ case with approval, noting that “having a widespread reputation in
a particular place [did] not necessarily mean that the trader [had] … goodwill
in his business” (see the _Millenia_ case at [50]).

63 Another situation in which there may be a good reputation attached to a
get-up without corresponding goodwill in that get-up is when the good or
service marketed under the get-up is priced out of the reach of those who
desire it. People who cannot afford a good or service cannot be considered to
be part of the potential customer base of the plaintiff who provides that good
or service. In the present case, the Respondents’ resorts cater for the
wealthy and the room rates there reflect this. As noted at [65] of the
Judgment, visitors to the Respondents’ resorts “pay a premium” to stay there.
The Respondents’ high room charges were described by Mr Sirois as an “economic
barrier”.[note: 29] The remarkable prices contribute to the overall image of
exclusivity which the Respondents have chosen to imbue their business with.
The Respondents’ resorts cannot even be put in the same class as other five-
star hotels, which, although pricey, often still receive guests from middle-
income groups. Even if the “Aman” names are well known throughout Singapore
such that they have widespread reputation, the high room rates at the Aman
resorts mean that these names carry no attractive force for _custom_ among
those who are less well off; such individuals simply cannot afford to stay at
the Aman resorts. In the _Budweiser_ case, the plaintiff’s goodwill was
limited by the restricted availability of “Budweiser” beer in the UK. In the
instant case, the limitation stems not from the availability of the product in
question but from its price. However, both types of limitation (_ie_ ,
limitation due to availability and limitation due to price) effectively mean
that the sphere of actual customers and potential customers of the product in
question is limited.

64 We should, however, point out that we accept that there are many people
who, although unable to go to the Aman resorts on a regular basis, may
nonetheless save up for a once-in-a-lifetime visit, such as for a honeymoon or
a golden wedding anniversary, _etc_. Exposure of the Aman resorts in magazines
like _Wedding & Travel_ (see [49] above) illustrates that there may be
goodwill in relation to this group of persons even though they may not fall
into the high-income category. We also accept that goodwill may subsist in
_potential_ customers – a person may be unable to afford to stay at an Aman
resort today, but he may nonetheless have been exposed to the “Aman” names and
thus aspire to visit one of the Aman resorts some day should his financial
position improve. Thus, the goodwill attached to the “Aman” names, apart from
existing among the core group of wealthy persons who are presently able to
patronise the Aman resorts on a regular basis, also subsists among once-in-a-
lifetime guests as well as the penumbra of aspirants who may one day be able
to realise their dreams of staying at an Aman resort if their financial status
improves.

(3) The type of business in respect of which goodwill in the “Aman” names
exists

65 The Judge was not clear about whether the Respondents had goodwill in the
“Aman” names in relation to hotels and resorts only, or whether the goodwill
extended to residential accommodation. The Appellant argued – correctly, in
our view – that the goodwill proved did not extend so far. While there is
evidence that the Respondents are engaged in tie-ups and licensing agreements
for the use of the “Aman” names _vis-à-vis_ luxury residential developments
(which will be discussed in greater detail later), there is no evidence that
this aspect of the Respondents’ business is known to the general public in
Singapore or even the more limited wealthy market, which forms the target
clientele for the Respondents’ resorts. In any event, as mentioned earlier (at
[43] above), the Respondents’ case on appeal was that the alleged goodwill
existed only in respect of the high-end hotel and resort market.

(4) Our conclusion on the extent of the goodwill attached to the “Aman” names

66 Given the limitations outlined above, we are of the view that the
Respondents’ goodwill in the “Aman” names in Singapore is limited largely to
those of a high income level who would have been exposed to the Respondents’
advertising. To this section of the public, we would add the category of once-
in-a-lifetime guests and aspirants which we alluded to earlier (at [64]
above). Finally, we also note that there is ample evidence that the “Aman”
names have goodwill among those in the high-end travel and resort industry as
well.

_The “foreign business problem”_

67 There is considerable academic debate in both the UK and Singapore over
what is sometimes called the “foreign business problem” in the law of passing
off. In a nutshell, this issue concerns the circumstances under which foreign
businesses can bring a claim for passing off. The nub of the problem lies in
whether a foreign entity must actually do business in a particular
jurisdiction before it can bring an action for passing off in that
jurisdiction, or whether it can simply rely on its reputation in the
jurisdiction concerned without doing any business there. The former position
was dubbed “the hard line” in _Mechanical Handling Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v
Material Handling Engineering Pte Ltd_ [1993] 2 SLR 205 at 210, [22], and some
suggest that it is the position which prevails in the UK and Singapore. The
latter is the less traditional approach exemplified by cases like _Conagra Inc
v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd_ (1992) 33 FCR 302 (a decision of the Federal
Court of Australia) and _Orkin Exterminating Co Inc v Pestco Co of Canada_
_Ltd_ (1985) 19 DLR (4th) 90 (a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal).

68 We do not wish to wade into this controversy at present, but there are
nevertheless two points pertinent to this appeal which we wish to make. First,
although the Respondents do not have any resorts in Singapore, they do have
two offices here. Indeed, the Amanresorts Group’s headquarters are in
Singapore (see [13] above) and the Amanresorts Group has an actual customer
base here. As such, it is not strictly correct to think of the Respondents’
business as a foreign one. The second point is that whether or not Singapore
adopts the hard-line approach to the “foreign business problem” may not be of
much significance, considering that foreign entities which have no goodwill
and/or do not carry on any business in Singapore may still get protection for
the names which they use to market their goods, services or business if those
names are “well known trade marks” for the purposes of s 55 of the current
TMA.

**_Misrepresentation_**

69 In order to establish an actionable tort of passing off, the plaintiff,
apart from proving that it has goodwill in the goods, services or business in
question, must also show that:

(a) the defendant has made a misrepresentation to the relevant sector of the
public; and

(b) such misrepresentation has resulted in or is likely to result in damage to
the plaintiff’s goodwill.

The elements of misrepresentation and damage are very closely linked, and it
is crucial to appreciate that both the misrepresentation and the damage must
relate to the plaintiff’s goodwill. A misrepresentation is actionable as a
tort of passing off only if it causes (or is likely to cause) damage to the
plaintiff’s goodwill.

_The misrepresentation in the present case_

(1) The content of the misrepresentation

70 In the present case, the Respondents allege that the Appellant’s use of the
name “Amanusa” constituted a misrepresentation that the Project had the same
source as the Respondents’ resorts or that the two (_ie_ , the Project and the
Respondents’ resorts) were somehow connected.

(2) The target audience of the misrepresentation

71 The Judge described the relevant section of the public to whom the
misrepresentation was made in the following terms (see the Judgment at [57]):

The relevant section of the public in the present case would encompass
Singapore citizens or residents who have visited the Aman resorts one or more
times or [who] are prospective visitors to the resorts, foreign individuals
and corporations here intending to visit the resorts or seeking to invest in
high-end properties (and there [are] a substantial number of foreign entities
here) and developers and hoteliers interested in becoming licensees of the
“Aman” brand names. Conceivably, there would also be a portion of the more
than 300,000 Singapore visitors to Bali since 1995 who have read about or
heard of the three Aman resorts there.

The Appellant argued that the Judge erred in delineating the relevant sector
of the public in the above manner because, in effect, he was confining the
relevant sector to the _Respondents’_ customers when the question was whether
the _Appellant’s_ customers were confused by the misrepresentation.

72 The established cases take inconsistent positions on the issue of whether
the target audience of the misrepresentation in a passing off action consists
of the _plaintiff’s_ customers or the _defendant’s_ customers. In the
_Advocaat_ case ([36] _supra_), Lord Diplock stated that the misrepresentation
must be made to the _defendant’s_ customers (see the passage reproduced at
[36] above). However, according to Lord Oliver’s formulation in the _Jif
Lemon_ case ([36] _supra_), the misrepresentation must be made to “the public”
(_id_ at 499 (reproduced at [36] above)). And, in yet another case, _Harrods
Limited v Harrodian School Limited_ [1996] RPC 697, which concerned a passing
off action brought by the proprietor of the world-famous department store,
Harrods, to restrain the defendant from carrying on a private preparatory
school under the name “The Harrodian School”, the English High Court
considered whether confusion existed among those parents who had inquired
about sending their children to the defendant’s school. The English Court of
Appeal disagreed and held instead that the misrepresentation must be
considered from the perspective of “a common section of the public” (at 716)
which comprised both the plaintiff’s customers and the defendant’s customers.
Millett LJ stated (_ibid_):

[T]he relevant public is not confined to parents who take up places at the
[defendant’s] school. The [plaintiff] and the [defendant] appeal to a common
section of the public – affluent members of the middle class who live in
London, shop at Harrods and wish to send their children to fee-paying schools.

73 With the greatest respect to the judges in the above-mentioned cases, these
formulations of the relevant sector of the public do not link the element of
misrepresentation back to the foundation of a claim for passing off – _viz_ ,
goodwill. These formulations include people who may not have any goodwill
towards the plaintiff’s get-up at all. Logically, misrepresentations made to
such people cannot affect the plaintiff’s goodwill in any way. Christopher
Wadlow perceptively notes in _The Law of Passing-Off: Unfair Competition by
Misrepresentation_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2004) (“ _The Law of Passing-Off_
”) that (at para 5-92):

The relevant public is normally stated to consist of _the actual or potential
customers of the claimant_ , and this is consistent with the fact that only
misrepresentations directed to them are likely to damage the claimant’s
goodwill. The claimant is much less likely to suffer from a misrepresentation
made to a person who would never be likely to deal with him. [emphasis added]

To this comment, we would add that not all actual customers and potential
customers of the plaintiff necessarily have goodwill _vis-à-vis_ the
plaintiff’s get-up. For instance, if a customer buys the plaintiff’s goods
solely because of reasons unrelated to the source of those goods (for
instance, because of the price, the availability or the functionality, _etc_ ,
of the goods) and not because of positive association of the goods with the
source indicated by the plaintiff’s get-up, then such customers do not
ordinarily count for the purposes of assessing the impact of the defendant’s
misrepresentation.

74 We find support for this approach in the _HFC Bank_ case ([59] _supra_).
One might recall that, in that case, HFC was held not to have achieved brand
recognition among many of its customers, including a number who were called by
HFC as witnesses to testify on the issue of confusion. Lloyd J held that those
witnesses did not have goodwill towards HFC’s name, and concluded (at 199):

I accept that persons as respects whom HFC do not have goodwill, because they
have no established brand recognition, have been confused as between the two
entities [_ie_ , HFC and Midland Bank], but this is not enough to make out a
case of passing off; because even if in some sense it may be regarded as a
misrepresentation, it is not made to the relevant people.

75 We agree with the Respondents’ submission that the approach taken by Lloyd
J in the _HFC Bank_ case is the right approach to adopt. The alleged
misrepresentation must be analysed from the perspective of those who have
goodwill in the plaintiff’s get-up. We further note that the definition of the
“relevant section of the public” (see the Judgment at [57]) which the Judge
adopted in the context of the misrepresentation in the present case is largely
consonant with the group of people who, we have held, have goodwill towards
the “Aman” names (see [66] above).

76 The question of whether those in Singapore with goodwill towards the “Aman”
names have received the Appellant’s misrepresentation depends on how widely
the misrepresentation has been broadcast. This is a matter of fact. Most
misrepresentations are broadcast to the public at large in Singapore. In this
case, the name “Amanusa” was apparently prominently displayed outside the
Showflat itself; it also appeared in promotional brochures and advertisements
of the Project in the mass media, which many people in Singapore would have
been exposed to. The misrepresentation has thus been made to the public at
large, _which would include those in Singapore with goodwill towards the
“Aman” names_.

(3) Whether the misrepresentation resulted in confusion

77 A misrepresentation is actionable under the law of passing off only if it
gives rise to confusion. The two elements – misrepresentation and confusion –
together form the “deception” referred to by Lord Diplock in the _Advocaat_
case ([36] _supra_) at 740. The Respondents raised the remarkable suggestion
that confusion was _not_ an element of an action for passing off in view of
the following _dicta_ in the _Millenia_ case ([36] _supra_) at [71]:

It is not necessary that there should be any confusion occasioned by the
misrepresentation, although confusion is of great evidential value in
determining whether or not there has been any misrepresentation. If the names
of two entities are confusingly similar, there is a great likelihood that the
public will be misled into thinking that they or their businesses are
connected with each other.

In our view, the above passage clearly only means that evidence of _actual_
confusion is not required before a passing off action can succeed. It is open
to the court to infer a _likelihood_ of confusion from the surrounding facts.
Confusion is still an essential element of the tort of passing off and we hope
that we have given any misunderstanding of the court’s _dicta_ in the
_Millenia_ case (at [71]) its quietus.

78 The question to be asked at this stage is actually fairly simple: Did those
in Singapore with goodwill towards the “Aman” names believe that the Project
had the same source as the Respondents’ resorts or was somehow connected with
the source of those resorts?

79 Before we continue, we pause to note that there was scant evidence from the
Respondents that persons in Singapore with goodwill towards the “Aman” names
were confused, _in actual fact_ , by the Appellant’s use of the name “Amanusa”
for the Project. The only evidence of actual confusion came from the husband
of one of the Appellant’s witnesses (a purchaser of a unit in the Project),
who said that he had asked the marketing agent whether the Project had
anything to do with the Amanusa Bali (see the Judgment at [59]). There was,
however, no evidence that high-income individuals (who form the bulk of the
group of persons with goodwill towards the “Aman” names) were actually
confused.

80 Evidence of actual confusion between the business, goods or services of the
plaintiff and those of the defendant may be helpful, but the lack of such
evidence is not fatal to the plaintiff’s claim. Instead, the court is entitled
to consider whether the average reasonable person, with characteristics
reflective of the relevant section of the public as identified under the
examination of goodwill, is likely to be confused by the defendant’s
misrepresentation. In _Parker-Knoll Limited v Knoll International Limited_
[1962] RPC 265, Lord Devlin said (at 291–292):

Instances of actual deception may be useful as examples, and evidence of
persons experienced in the ways of purchasers of a particular class of goods
will assist the judge. But his decision does not depend solely or even
primarily upon the evaluation of such evidence. The court must in the end
trust to its own perception into the mind of the reasonable man.

81 With this in mind, we turn to consider whether the factual matrix of the
present case supports the conclusion that the reasonable member of the
relevant section of the public identified earlier (at [66] above) was likely
to have been confused by the Appellant’s misrepresentation.

82 The Judge quite rightly considered that the Appellant had used for the
Project a name which was identical to the name used by the Respondents for the
Amanusa Bali. It was also a relevant consideration that the Project was
originally heavily touted as having a Balinese atmosphere, just like the
Amanusa Bali. These are all factors which increase the likelihood of
confusion. On the Balinese theme point, we reject the Appellant’s suggestion
that the Judge was somehow granting the Respondents a monopoly over that
particular architectural style. The Balinese theme is only relevant in so far
as the name of the Project and that of the Amanusa Bali are identical – a
factor which increases the likelihood of confusion.

83 Notably, it would have been a relevant consideration increasing the
likelihood of confusion if the Appellant had been found to have had fraudulent
intentions in using the name “Amanusa” for the Project, _ie_ , if it had set
out to deceive those with goodwill towards the “Aman” names (see _Office
Cleaning Services, Ld v Westminster Window and General Cleaners, Ld_ (1946) 63
RPC 39 at 42, _per_ Lord Simonds). Although the account by the Appellant of
how it came up with the name “Amanusa” for the Project lacked an air of
reality and although there certainly was some patent plagiarism of certain
laudatory phrases from the Respondents’ promotional materials, the Judge was
satisfied that there was no fraudulent intention on the Appellant’s part (see
the Judgment at [4] and [75]). This finding has not been challenged by the
Respondents. It should be noted, however, that a finding of innocent copying
would not in itself exonerate the defendant in a passing off action.

84 Another factor to consider in assessing whether the misrepresentation in
question has led to confusion between the business, goods or services of the
plaintiff and those of the defendant is whether the parties are in the same
field or closely related fields of business – or, to be more precise, whether
the business, goods or services to which the plaintiff’s get-up is applied are
in the same or a closely related field as that to which the defendant’s
business, goods or services belong.

85 We note that the Respondents use the “Aman” names in the high-end hotel and
resort business while the Appellant seeks to use the name “Amanusa” for
middle-class residential accommodation (specifically, the Project).
Nevertheless, we accept the Judge’s finding that “the dividing line between
purely residential developments and luxury hotel or resort developments is no
longer pronounced” (see the Judgment at [59]). As we noted earlier, the
Respondents are involved in the high-end residential accommodation industry as
well (see [8]–[9] above). The Respondents have also put forward cogent
evidence that the luxury hotel and resort market as a whole is
“converg[ing]”[note: 30] with the residential accommodation market. The Judge
summarised the Respondents’ position in relation to the development of Aman
Villas thus (see the Judgment at [9]):

The development of such branded real estate projects [is] part of a worldwide
trend whereby luxury hotel groups [will] develop and manage branded long-term
residential projects. Conversely, developers of houses and condominiums have
also started building hotels and resorts. There [is] therefore an ongoing
convergence of the two erstwhile separate industries. In Singapore, for
example, the Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts manage the Shangri-La Residences, a
branded residential condominium development, and the Shangri-La Apartments, a
project involving branded serviced apartments. Similarly, Starwood Hotels &
Resorts Worldwide [will] be managing the six-star St Regis Hotel together with
the St Regis Residences.

86 We accept the above evidence. This convergence between the hotel and resort
industry on the one hand and the residential accommodation industry on the
other makes it more likely that confusion will occur in the present case.
Furthermore, it is well established that “the parties in a passing off action
need not be in mutual competition” (see the _Millenia_ case ([36] _supra_) at
[63]) and may even be engaged in “different fields of business activities”
(_ibid_) (see also generally the _Millenia_ case at [63]–[66], citing English
and Australian authorities on this point).

87 The Appellant argued that there were such great differences between the
Project and the Amanusa Bali that no one would think that they were from the
same source or were somehow connected. We are aware that the Respondents’
resorts are aimed at the high-end market while the Project is aimed at the
middle class in Singapore, and that the quality of the two kinds of
accommodation differs accordingly. In this regard, the Judge found (see the
Judgment at [65]):

Visitors to Aman resorts, like the guests at RCMS (The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia
Singapore), pay a premium to stay at the resorts. On the other hand, as
emphasised by the [Appellant] and its counsel, the [Project’s] target buyers
were people looking for reasonably-priced landed property (the listed prices
for most of the units [in the Project] ranged from $1.3m to $1.45m, with the
most expensive unit priced at $1.8m). Although the [Appellant] did assert that
its projects were well known for their high-quality finishes and imported
fixtures, I doubt the [Project] would be capable of replicating the ambience
and spaciousness of the [Respondents’] resorts. I quote the words of one of
the visitors to the [Appellant’s] sales office, who responded to the
[Appellant’s] questionnaire asking whether the word “Amanusa” meant anything
to him by answering, “means spa; alone; serene – but the development is
_totally opposite_ to its meaning. Very crowded[.]” [emphasis in original]

88 We do accept that in some cases, the differences between the business,
goods or services of the plaintiff and those of the defendant may be so great
and so obvious that no one would mistake the former for the latter and _vice
versa_. For instance, in _Miss World (Jersey) Ltd v James Street Productions
Ltd_ [1981] FSR 309 (“the _Miss World_ case”), the plaintiff’s “Miss World”
beauty contest was held to be too well known and respectable to be confused
with the defendant’s film entitled “Miss Alternative World”, which Lord
Denning MR described as “not a film showing beautiful girls – as in the Miss
World contest – but a film of the grotesque” (at 310).

89 The decision in the _Miss World_ case may be contrasted with that in the
_Millenia_ case ([36] _supra_). In the latter, the plaintiff alleged that the
defendant’s “Millennium” hotels were being passed off as the plaintiff’s
“Millenia” complex, which comprised a hotel (“The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia
Singapore”), a shopping mall and two office towers. This court noted at [84]:

In so far as the hotel industry is concerned, [The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia
Singapore] symbolises world class quality and prestige with top-of-the-range
services and amenities. The [defendant’s “Millennium”] hotels in Singapore are
of a lower class and quality and are more economically priced.

90 Despite these differences, this court held that the public would very
likely be deceived into thinking that the defendant’s “Millennium” hotels were
associated with or related to The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, or that
the former and the latter belonged to the same chain. The court was influenced
by (_inter alia_) the similarity of the words “Millenia” and “Millennium”.

91 We are of the view that the facts in the instant case are closer to those
in the _Millenia_ case than those in the _Miss World_ case ([88] _supra_). We
find that the Appellant presented the Project as high-quality accommodation
(see [23] above) which was being sold at affordable prices. This manner of
presentation would have increased the likelihood that someone who, for
example, came across an advertisement of the Project in the newspapers might
confuse the Project with the Amanusa Bali.

92 We have said that the bulk of those who have goodwill towards the “Aman”
names are high-income individuals (see [66] above). These individuals are not
likely to be actual or potential purchasers of units in the Project. Hence, if
an initial confusion as to the source of the Project or its connection with
the Aman resorts sets in (for example, from a cursory glance at one of the
Appellant’s advertisements featuring the Project in the newspapers), there is
not likely to be further investigation by the aforementioned individuals into
the nature of the Project out of an interest in purchasing units in that
project, which investigation (if carried out) would reveal the differences
between the Project and the Amanusa Bali so as to dispel such confusion.
Further, it is also difficult to dispel confusion where news of the Project
gets passed around by word of mouth. Thus, we agree with the Judge’s view that
(see the Judgment at [60]):

It is no answer to an allegation of misrepresentation in such a case to say
that one could easily check the facts with the [Appellant] or its agents or
through its sales brochures (which would indicate the name of the developers
for the [P]roject) or otherwise check with the [Respondents] or other
independent sources. The [Appellant] should also not be allowed to say that
the relevant section of the public in this case would tend to be more
intelligent and would verify matters which they are not certain about. The
fact that such checking or verification is required is itself evidence of
confusion.

93 In conclusion, we accept the Judge’s finding (_id_ at [59]) that there was
a likelihood of confusion arising from the misrepresentation in the present
case in that the use of the name “Amanusa” for the Project:

… would [create] … the impression that [the Project] is somehow related or
connected to the [Respondents], perhaps by way of licence to use the name or
that the [Project] has the [Respondents’] endorsement and will in future be
managed by [the Respondents]. It may even convey the wrong impression that the
[Respondents] are involved as developers.

**_Damage_**

94 The tort of passing off protects the plaintiff against damage caused to the
goodwill attached to its business, goods or services by the defendant’s
misrepresentation. Thus, even if the defendant’s misrepresentation is shown to
have caused or to be likely to cause confusion between the plaintiff’s
business, goods or services and those of the defendant, such misrepresentation
is not in itself actionable under the law of passing off unless it has caused
(or is likely to cause) damage to the plaintiff’s goodwill. As correctly
identified by the Judge, the test for damage in passing off cases is either
“actual or probable damage” (_id_ at [63]) to the plaintiff’s goodwill.

95 In the court below, the Respondents claimed the following heads of damage:

(a) “inferiority of the [Appellant’s] goods or services” (_ibid_);

(b) “loss of licensing opportunity or income” (_ibid_);

(c) “likelihood of damage should the [Appellant] get into financial, legal or
other trouble” (_ibid_);

(d) “misappropriation of the [Respondents’] goodwill and reputation” (_ibid_);

(e) “restriction on the [Respondents’] natural expansion into residential real
estate” (_ibid_);

(f) “loss of exclusivity and erosion of distinctiveness” (_ibid_) of the
“Aman” names; and

(g) “dilution of [the goodwill attached to] the [‘Aman’ names]” (_ibid_).

96 The law relating to which heads of damage are (or should be) judicially
recognised under the tort of passing off is notoriously difficult. Not only
are the pleaded heads of damage often overlapping, but there is also
substantial judicial and academic disagreement over which heads of damage
should be recognised and which should not. A number of the heads of damage
claimed by the Respondents are of an inchoate nature – they are still very
much in development at common law and their universal acceptance cannot be
taken for granted. As stated by Wadlow at para 4-24 of _The Law of Passing-
Off_ ([73] _supra_):

It is suggested that there may be a distinction to be drawn between heads of
damage which are sufficient to support a passing-off action in their own
right, and those which may be taken into account in some circumstances, but
only if the damage under one of the heads in the first category can be proven
or presumed. … One has, so to speak, a category of recoverable parasitic
damages.

_Analysis of the heads of damage claimed by the Respondents_

(1) Inferiority of the Appellant’s residential accommodation

97 There are two primary and very well-established means by which goodwill can
be damaged, namely, by “blurring” and by “tarnishment”. Blurring occurs when
the plaintiff’s get-up, instead of being indicative of only the plaintiff’s
goods, services or business, also becomes indicative of the defendant’s goods,
services or business. While customers may still be drawn by the attractive
force of the plaintiff’s get-up, they may be drawn to the business, goods or
services of the defendant instead of those of the plaintiff. In other words,
the goodwill attached to the plaintiff’s business, goods or services becomes
spread out over business, goods or services which are not the plaintiff’s.
This phenomenon occurs only when the business, goods or services of the
plaintiff and those of the defendant are in competition with or are at least
substitutes for each other. The damage manifests itself in sales being
diverted from the plaintiff to the defendant.

98 Tarnishment occurs when the business, goods or services of the defendant
are of a worse quality than those of the plaintiff or have some other
undesirable characteristic. Customers think that the plaintiff is now the
source of such poor quality or undesirable business, goods or services. The
goodwill previously attached to the plaintiff’s business, goods or services
loses its attractive quality and may even become a liability, driving away
custom rather than attracting it. Where it is alleged that goodwill has been
damaged by tarnishment, there is no need for the plaintiff’s business, goods
or services and those of the defendant to be in competition with each other
(_contra_ the position where damage to goodwill by blurring is concerned). The
plaintiff and the defendant can be engaged in entirely different fields of
business so long as it is shown that the poor quality or undesirability of the
defendant’s business, goods or services rebounds on the plaintiff.

99 In the instant case, the Respondents did not make any claim that the
goodwill attached to the “Aman” names had been damaged by blurring. This was a
sensible course of action, seeing that those with goodwill in the “Aman”
names, being in the main individuals with significantly higher income than the
targeted clientele for the Project, are not likely to be purchasers of units
in the Project. As for those persons in Singapore with goodwill towards the
“Aman” names who may not necessarily be in the high-income group (_ie_ , the
once-in-a-lifetime guests and the aspirants mentioned at [64] above), we agree
with the Judge’s finding (at [64] of the Judgment) that if such persons had at
first mistakenly thought that the Project was related to the Respondents’
resorts generally and/or the Amanusa Bali in particular and had in turn sought
to purchase units in the Project on that erroneous basis, the purchasing
process itself would have dispelled such misunderstanding. There has thus been
no damage by blurring in the present case.

100 Although the Respondents did not assert damage to their goodwill by
blurring, they did claim that the Appellant’s use of the name “Amanusa” for
the Project would tarnish the goodwill attached to the “Aman” names. In the
classic case of tarnishment, the defendant’s business, goods or services have
an unsavoury reputation (see, for instance, _Annabel’s (Berkeley Square)
Limited v G Schock_ [1972] RPC 838, where the defendant operated an escort
agency using the name of the plaintiff’s upscale night club, and _C A Sheimer
(M) Sdn Bhd’s Trade Mark Application_ [2000] RPC 484, where it was sought to
register the word “Visa” as a trade mark for use in relation to, _inter alia_
, condoms and contraceptive devices). Differences in quality may also be
sufficient to establish damage to goodwill by tarnishment (see, _eg_ , the
_Millenia_ case ([36] _supra_)).

101 Obviously, the Project has no immoral or unsavoury associations. The only
relevant factor for the purposes of assessing whether there has been damage to
goodwill by tarnishment lies in the quality of the Project. In this respect,
we find it hard to resist the Judge’s conclusion that if the name “Amanusa”
were allowed to be used for the Project (see the Judgment at [65]):

[T]he name which inspired hushed awe could in future evoke suppressed laughter
because of the association with [a project] that [does] not quite exude the
same luxury and class or quality of upkeep, especially when [the Project has]
begun to show [its] age.

(2) Likelihood of damage should the Appellant get into financial, legal or
other trouble

102 The Respondents argued that if the Appellant were to get into any sort of
financial, legal or other trouble, persons who had confused the Project with
the Respondents’ resorts might assume that it was the Respondents which were
having difficulties; in effect, the Respondents would have lost control over
the goodwill or reputation attached to the “Aman” names. It was submitted that
if, for instance, a newspaper article headed “Fire at Amanusa Due To Faulty
Wiring” were published, the public might assume that the article was referring
to the Amanusa Bali as opposed to the Project. People who made that assumption
might decide not to stay at the Amanusa Bali and might also assume that the
quality of the other Aman resorts had likewise deteriorated.

103 Some case authorities indicate that the threshold which the plaintiff has
to cross for the purposes of proving this particular head of damage (_ie_ , a
likelihood of damage to the plaintiff’s goodwill should the defendant
encounter financial, legal or other trouble) is relatively low. _British
Legion v British Legion Club (Street) Ld_ (1931) 48 RPC 555 (“the _British
Legion_ case”) is one such example. The plaintiff there, a charitable
association known as the “British Legion”, was formed at the close of World
War I with the aim of “[inaugurating] and [obtaining] united democratic
comradeship between those who had served in [World War I] and [of making]
provision for their welfare and that of their dependants” (at 560). The
defendant was a small social club in a quiet corner of Somerset county which
styled itself the “British Legion Club (Street) Ld”. A considerable number of
its members were ex-soldiers and/or members of the British Legion, but there
were also a significant number of its members who were not ex-soldiers or
members of the British Legion. The plaintiff brought an action to restrain the
defendant from using the words “British Legion” in its name. Farwell J ruled
in favour of the plaintiff, holding (at 564):

If the use of the [defendant’s] name, as it is now used, is to suggest to any
ordinary person that the [plaintiff] is in some way connected with the
[defendant] or is in some way, as it were, its sponsor, then if evil befalls
the [defendant] and it finds itself (I am not suggesting [that] it will) in
trouble either under the [l]icensing laws or in financial trouble or in some
other way of discredit, the result will be, in my judgment, that many of the
persons who knew of the existence of the [defendant might] think that the
[plaintiff] had been very ill-advised and very unfortunate in having any
connection with such a [c]ompany, and that might well tend to prevent persons
who otherwise would have supported the [plaintiff] by subscriptions or
otherwise from continuing to do so.

We note that there was no evidence in that case that the evils envisaged by
Farwell J were about to befall the defendant club.

104 A similarly lenient approach _vis-à-vis_ proof of the likelihood of damage
was adopted by the English Court of Appeal in _Dawnay Day & Co Limited v
Cantor Fitzgerald International_ [2000] RPC 674 (“the _Dawnay Day_ case”).
There, Sir Richard Scott VC held that if the defendant (a securities trading
company) were allowed to use the name “Dawnay Day” for its business, one form
of damage likely to be suffered by the plaintiffs (securities trading
companies belonging to the Dawnay Day group of companies) was the damage to
their reputation should the defendant engage in activities “in any respect
reprehensible” (at 705–706), which activities the plaintiffs would be unable
to prevent. As in the _British Legion_ case, there was no suggestion that the
defendant was at the time of the trial engaged in or might in future engage in
such activities.

105 With respect, we do not think that it is sufficient for the plaintiff, for
the purposes of establishing a likelihood of damage to its goodwill, to merely
allege that evil days may befall the defendant. If such allegations were
accepted as sufficient proof, the requirement of damage would be rendered
otiose. Wadlow in _The Law of Passing-Off_ ([73] _supra_) argues at para 4-40
that there must be “a real tangible risk of substantial damage”; we agree. In
this regard, we would also draw attention to _Habib Bank Ltd v Habib Bank AG
Zurich_ [1981] 1 WLR 1265, where the English Court of Appeal dismissed the
argument of the plaintiff, Habib Bank Ltd, that there was a danger of some
malpractice by the defendant, a bank whose name contained the words “Habib
Bank”, rubbing off on the plaintiff. It was held that the plaintiff’s
contention was “two-way traffic” (at 1282) and “pure speculation” (_ibid_).

106 In the instant case, while there is an obvious difference in quality
between the Aman resorts and the Project (which, we have found, gives rise to
damage in the form of tarnishment (see [101] above)), it is too much of a
stretch to allege, without more, that there is a real tangible risk that the
Appellant may go into liquidation or that some disaster like a fire will
befall the Project.

(3) Loss of licensing opportunity or licensing income, and misappropriation of
goodwill and reputation

107 The Respondents stated that they were in the business of granting licences
for the use of the “Aman” names to residential property developers in other
countries who wanted to adorn their developments with a certain classy
flavour. They pointed out that the Appellant had a history of building
condominiums and giving them thematic names, and was thus was likely to
develop its own “Aman” series of condominiums if it were not prevented from
doing so. The Respondents further argued that if the Appellant’s use of the
name “Amanusa” for the Project were allowed to pass unhindered, other real
estate developers in Singapore could also begin using the “Aman” names without
seeking licences from the Respondents.

108 In the UK, loss of licensing opportunity or licensing income has been held
to be a distinct head of damage in itself in passing off actions. For
instance, in _Irvine v Talksport Ltd_ [2002] 1 WLR 2355, Laddie J thought that
the law of passing off should afford a remedy to the plaintiff (“Irvine”), a
well-known Formula One racing driver, against the defendant company, which had
used his photograph in a brochure promoting its radio station. Irvine was
already in the business of endorsement, and it was common knowledge that many
sportsmen earned a lot of money through endorsements. Laddie J said at [39]:

Not only has the law of passing off expanded over the years, but the
commercial environment in which it operates is in a constant state of flux.
Even without the evidence given at the trial in this action, the court can
take judicial notice of the fact that it is common for famous people to
exploit their names and images by way of endorsement. They do it not only in
their own field of expertise but, depending on the extent of their fame or
notoriety, wider afield also. It is common knowledge that for many sportsmen,
for example, income received from endorsing a variety of products and services
represents a very substantial part of their total income. The reason large
sums are paid for endorsement is because, no matter how irrational it may seem
to a lawyer, those in business have reason to believe that the lustre of a
famous personality, if attached to their goods or services, will enhance the
attractiveness of those goods or services to their target market. In this
respect, the endorsee is taking the benefit of the attractive force which is
the reputation or goodwill of the famous person.

109 Another striking example where loss of licensing opportunity was
recognised as a recoverable head of damage is the English High Court case of
_Lego System Aktieselskab v Lego M Lemelstrich Ltd_ [1983] FSR 155 (“the
_LEGO_ case”). There, the famous toy-maker, Lego, and its UK distributor
(referred to collectively as “the plaintiffs” in our discussion of this
particular case) successfully argued that the use of the name “Lego” by the
defendant on its garden sprinklers and other irrigation equipment amounted to
passing off, even though there was no evidence that the plaintiffs were going
to expand into the defendant’s unrelated field of business (_viz_ , the
manufacture of irrigation equipment). Falconer J held (at 194):

… I am satisfied … that the reputation of the plaintiffs’ mark LEGO and their
goodwill is wide enough to extend to goods such as garden sprinklers made of
coloured plastics [_sic_] material, [and that] for the [defendant] to market
[its] garden sprinklers and other irrigation equipment products would cause
damage to the plaintiffs._The plaintiffs now have the potentiality of using
the mark and the attractive force of its reputation themselves to market their
own goods in the garden equipment field or to license or franchise another
trader to use it in that field._ As to using it themselves, the evidence … was
to the effect that the plaintiffs would be prevented from entering that field
if the [defendant were] allowed to continue to use the trade mark LEGO in this
country on [its] products. Another course open to the plaintiffs would be to
license or franchise another trader to use the mark LEGO in that field. The
evidence of the plaintiffs’ expert witness, Mr. Weisz, was important in this
respect.He is a marketing expert with very wide and successful experience in
advertising and marketing, particularly in the launching of new products and
new enterprises in this country, and in franchising operations; he is now
Managing Director of A.T.V. Licensing Limited which is concerned with the
commercial exploitation by franchising of characters associated with
television programmes. The effect of his evidence was that, because of the
reputation of Lego (meaning the plaintiffs’ toy construction products), there
would be an opportunity for licensing or franchising the mark LEGO in other
fields, that, because of the nature of the Lego products, primarily plastic
bricks, the plastics area would be a likely one to exploit and that garden
implements would be an ideal market for franchising LEGO, because the
purchasers of Lego toys are parents and grandparents; as he put it, the very
same people who are likely to be purchasers of garden equipment._Obviously,
the possibility of licensing or franchising another trader to use LEGO in the
gardening equipment area would be lost if the [defendant is] allowed to
continue using LEGO in this country in relation to [its] products_.The effect,
therefore, of the [defendant] continuing to use LEGO in this country in
relation to [its] products would be to destroy that part of the plaintiffs’
reputation in their mark LEGO and [the] goodwill attached to it which extends
to such goods. [emphasis added]

110 On the other hand, it has been argued that accepting the loss of licensing
opportunity or licensing revenue as a recoverable head of damage in passing
off actions will lead to a circularity in reasoning. In the New Zealand case
of _Tot Toys Ltd v Mitchell_ [1993] 1 NZLR 325, Fisher J said (at 362):

It is axiomatic that damage must be proved or presumed as one of the
ingredients of passing off. It has never been sufficient for plaintiffs to
fill this gap by arguing that their loss is loss of the right to charge the
defendant a fee for continuing conduct the lawfulness of which is the subject
currently under inquiry. To accept that proposition would be to deny that
damage is an essential and independent ingredient of the tort. And if the
defendant’s conduct is otherwise lawful, it cannot be rendered unlawful upon
the ground that it might induce others to act in the same way without the
plaintiff’s permission.

111 In our view, there is much force in Fisher J’s analysis. Even if the
plaintiff does have an existing business of licensing its get-up for use by
others, this might only mean that its licensees _mistakenly_ think that a
licence is necessary before they can use the plaintiff’s get-up. In fact, it
is only if passing off is first proved that the plaintiff then has the right
to demand that those who wish to use its distinctive get-up must first obtain
a licence from it. We agree with Wadlow’s argument in _The Law of Passing-Off_
([73] _supra_) that (at para 4-38):

It might be said that the misrepresentation in passing-off could always have
been sanctioned by the claimant for payment; and, therefore, that the claimant
has automatically been damaged by the unauthorised making of the
misrepresentation. This does not represent English law. If right, it would
mean that there would never be any independent need to prove likelihood of
actual damage in passing-off.

112 It has also been noted that developments in this area of law (_ie_ ,
recognising loss of licensing opportunity or licensing income as a recoverable
head of damage) appear to be extensions of the classical trinity of passing
off delineated at [37] above, such that what appears to be protected is really
the plaintiff’s fame rather than the goodwill attached to the plaintiff’s
business, goods or services (see, for instance, Hazel Carty, “Advertising,
Publicity Rights and English Law” [2004] IPQ 209).

113 In our view, the recognition of loss of licensing opportunity or licensing
income as a distinct head of damage should be approached conservatively. In
the present case, even if we accept that this head of damage is recoverable in
passing off actions under our law, it is not clear that the evidence adduced
by the Respondents of their licensing agreements with real estate developers
_overseas_ really proves damage arising from misrepresentation and confusion
_in Singapore_ – the Respondents may be entitled to license the “Aman” names
overseas because they have been registered as trade marks overseas or for
other reasons, but this does not mean that the “Aman” names have a natural
capacity for generating licensing opportunity or licensing revenue in
Singapore for the Respondents.

114 That said, the loss of licensing opportunity or licensing revenue is not
entirely irrelevant to the equation. If passing off is proved (based on some
other head of damage which is well established as being recoverable), the
plaintiff, in addition to claiming for any loss of sales occasioned by such
damage, can also claim for loss of licensing revenue. Thus, the loss of
licensing opportunity or licensing revenue goes towards _quantifying_ rather
than _proving_ damage.

115 The Respondents’ claim for “misappropriation of … goodwill and reputation”
(see the Judgment at [63]) is closely linked to the claim for loss of
licensing opportunity or licensing income. The Respondents argued that the
Appellant’s use of the name “Amanusa” amounted to “an unlicensed appropriation
of the Respondents’ goodwill and reputation.”[note: 31] Our views stated
earlier (at [110]–[114] above) also apply to this argument.

(4) Restriction on the Respondents’ expansion into the residential real estate
business

116 The Respondents claimed that if the Appellant were permitted to use the
name “Amanusa” for the Project, they would be prejudiced in any future
commercial plans to expand into residential development in Singapore. It was
submitted that damage should be inferred in this case because the Respondents
not only had every intention of expanding into the field of residential
accommodation, but were in fact already involved in that field.

117 We accept the principle that a plaintiff who has established goodwill in
one form of commercial activity (“the established activity”) may be entitled
to protection from passing off _vis-à-vis_ another form of commercial activity
which is a natural expansion of the first (“the extended activity”). Thus, in
_Alfred Dunhill Limited v Sunoptic SA_ [1979] FSR 337, it was understandable
why the English Court of Appeal prevented the defendant from marketing
sunglasses under the name “Dunhill” given that the plaintiff, a well-known
producer of tobacco goods under the same name, had expanded its business to
include the sale of luxury goods for men, likewise under the name “Dunhill”.
The plaintiff had also showed that although it had not sold sunglasses in
England, it was planning to produce sunglasses itself.

118 It is, however, important to stress the close connection which must exist
between the established activity and the extended activity for that connection
forms the foundation for this head of damage. Wadlow in _The Law of Passing-
Off_ ([73] _supra_) cites (at para 4-42) the following extract from the
American case of _S C_  _Johnson & Son, Inc v Johnson_ 116 F 2d 427 (2nd Cir,
1940) at 429 (_per_ Hand J) as being representative of the English position in
this regard:

It is true that a merchant who has sold one kind of goods … sometimes finds
himself driven to add other ‘lines’ in order to hold or develop his existing
market; in such cases he has a legitimate present interest in preserving his
identity in the ancillary market, which he cannot do … if others make his name
equivocal there. But if the new goods have no such relation to the old, and if
the first user’s interest in maintaining the significance of his name when
applied to the new goods is nothing more than the desire to post the new
market as a possible preserve which he may later choose to exploit, it is hard
to see any basis for its protection [_ie_ , for the protection of the
merchant’s name in the new market]. The public may be deceived, but [the
merchant] has no claim to be its vicarious champion; his remedy must be
limited to his injury and by hypothesis he has none.

In our view, this passage is representative of the position in Singapore as
well.

119 Some of the English cases in which claims for passing off have succeeded
despite the apparent gulf between the established activity and the extended
activity of the plaintiff can be understood on their particular facts. One
such case is the English High Court’s decision in _The Eastman Photographic
Materials Company, Ld v The John Griffiths Cycle Corporation, Ld and The Kodak
Cycle Company, Ld_ (1898) 15 RPC 105 (“the _KODAK_ case”). In that case, the
plaintiff carried on a business involving cameras and other related goods
under the trade mark “Kodak”. It also made cameras, called “Cycle Kodaks” or
“Bicycle Kodaks”, which were suitable for use on bicycles. The plaintiff
sought an injunction to restrain the defendant from carrying on a bicycle
business under the name “The Kodak Cycle Company, Ld”. This application was
successful. Romer J noted (at 110):

[S]o great is the connection between the two classes of business [_ie_ , the
plaintiff’s camera business and the defendant’s bicycle business], that in all
probability, I may say, the [p]laintiff … may wish hereafter to manufacture
and sell cycles specially adapted to carry [its] “Kodaks.”

It is important to note that not only were the plaintiff’s “Kodak” cameras
“very well known indeed throughout the length and breadth of [the UK]”
(_ibid_), but the defendant’s fraudulent intention, so Romer J found, “was
really to try and get a monopoly of the word ‘Kodak’ as connected with cycles
… in the hope and intention of, in some shape or other, identifying [the
defendant company] with the [p]laintiff” (_ibid_). It also appears from the
judgment that at the time the case was decided (_viz_ , in the late 19th
century), the camera industry and the bicycle industry were not quite as
distinct as they are today. Apparently, many shops sold both cameras and
bicycles.

120 In the _LEGO_ case ([109] _supra_), it was held that the toy brick
industry was close enough to the garden sprinkler industry to warrant the
protection of the “Lego” mark against passing off in the latter industry. It
should be noted that Falconer J was assisted in this conclusion by the fact
that the plaintiffs in that case had established “a high reputation in the
mark, which [had] become very widely known in [the UK] in relation to [toy
construction sets made of moulded coloured plastic materials] as denoting the
goods of the plaintiffs” (at 157–158), and by the fact that the word “Lego”
was “[a] household word” (at 160). Also, there were similarities in the
plaintiffs’ products and the defendant’s garden sprinklers as both consisted
of brightly-coloured plastic goods.

121 In our view, in the instant case, the Respondents’ field of business
(which, in the context of this appeal, is the high-end hotel and resort
business (see [65] above)) and the Appellant’s field of business (_viz_ , the
residential accommodation business) are closely connected. Both fields concern
accommodation. The fact that the Respondents have already expanded into the
residential accommodation business overseas (see [8]–[9] above) buttresses
this conclusion. The Respondents’ and the Appellant’s respective fields of
business are certainly much closer than the camera and the bicycle industries
(see the _KODAK_ case) or the toy brick and the garden sprinkler industries
(see the _LEGO_ case). The use by the Appellant of the name “Amanusa” or of
other names similar to the “Aman” names in the field of residential
accommodation in Singapore would prevent the Respondents from expanding into
the residential accommodation business in this country. For this reason, we
hold that this head of damage (_viz_ , restriction on the Respondents’
expansion into the residential accommodation business) has been proved.

(5) Loss of exclusivity and erosion of the distinctiveness of the “Aman” names
as well as dilution of the goodwill attached to these names

122 The Respondents argued that that the use of the name “Amanusa” by the
Appellant for the Project would lead to the gradual whittling away and erosion
of the uniqueness and exclusivity associated with the “Aman” names, and would
lessen the capacity of these names to identify and distinguish the
Respondents’ goods and services from the goods and services of others. The
Respondents contended that:[note: 32]

[T]he distinctiveness of the “AMAN” brand would be eroded by the haphazard and
random use of the brand, for example, where geographical exclusivity is
compromised, or where there is indiscriminate and widespread use and the use
is not protected by the involvement of the [Respondents] ...

The Judge agreed with the Respondents, holding that “the most potent form of
likely damage is the intangible loss that may be occasioned by the insidious
process of dilution such that the famous name [in question] loses its
uniqueness” (see the Judgment at [65]).

123 The Respondents cited _Taylor Bros Ltd v Taylors Group Ltd_ [1988] 2 NZLR
1 (“the _Taylor Bros_ case”) in support of the proposition that these heads of
damage – _viz_ , loss of exclusivity and erosion of the distinctiveness of the
plaintiff’s get-up, as well as dilution of the goodwill attached to that get-
up – ought to be recognised. The plaintiff in that case operated, _inter alia_
, a dry-cleaning business under the style “Taylors”, “Taylors Drycleaners” and
“Taylors Drycleaning”. It sought an injunction to restrain the defendant,
which likewise ran (_inter alia_) a dry-cleaning business, from trading in the
Wellington region under the name “Taylors”. The question before the court was
whether damage had been caused in the form of the loss of the distinctiveness
of the name “Taylors” or a risk of inundation or dilution of the plaintiff’s
goodwill through the incorrect association of the plaintiff with the
defendant. The Wellington Court of Appeal upheld the High Court of
Wellington’s decision to grant the plaintiff the injunction sought, stating
(at 37–38):

[I]n some cases it is legitimate to infer damage from a tendency to impair
distinctiveness. … Here there is ample evidence that Taylors is at present
distinctive of the [plaintiff] in Wellington in the particular field of
businesses associated with textile cleaning. If the [defendant is] permitted
to use the name in Wellington, albeit in a special branch of cleaning business
in which [the plaintiff] do [_sic_] not engage, there will be not only the
natural tendency to treat the parties as associated but also a loss by [the
plaintiff] of control and licensing capacity (and therefore revenue) of the
same kind as [that] illustrated by the _[LEGO]_ case.

124 We find it difficult to determine if the _Taylor Bros_ case really
established a separate head of damage. It is clear that the Wellington Court
of Appeal thought that damage had been caused to the plaintiff in two ways,
namely, due to: (a) a “natural tendency to treat the parties as associated”
(_id_ at 38); and (b) “a loss by [the plaintiff] of control and licensing
capacity (and therefore revenue)” (_ibid_). With regard to the first type of
damage, it is hard to see how this constitutes damage as opposed to mere proof
that there has been a misrepresentation by the defendant which has led to
confusion between the business, goods or services of the plaintiff and those
of the defendant. As for the second form of damage, we have already dealt with
it earlier (at [107]–[114] above).

125 The Respondents also cited the _Dawnay Day_ case ([104] _supra_), in which
it was held by Sir Scott VC (at 706) that “the use of Dawnay Day as a trading
style by a company that [was] not a member of the Dawnay Day group [would]
dilute and, potentially, [might] destroy the distinctiveness of the name”. No
further elaboration on what this meant was given by Sir Scott VC, although he
referred to _Taittinger SA v Allbev Ltd_ [1993] FSR 641 (“the _Elderflower
Champagne_ case”). In that case, the issue was whether it was permissible for
the defendants to sell a non-alcoholic, fruit-flavoured soft drink called
“Elderflower Champagne” in a bottle and a get-up that looked much like the
bottle and the get-up used for “champagne”, which term was used only in
respect of sparkling wines from the Champagne region in France. Peter Gibson
LJ said (at 670) that the “erosion of the distinctiveness of the name
champagne in [the UK was] a form of damage to the goodwill of the business of
the champagne houses”.

126 Sir Thomas Bingham MR came to the same conclusion. He said (at 678 of the
_Elderflower Champagne_ case):

The first [plaintiff’s] reputation and goodwill in the description Champagne
derive not only from the quality of [its] wine and its glamorous associations,
but also from the very singularity and exclusiveness of the description, the
absence of qualifying epithets and imitative descriptions.Any product which is
not Champagne but is allowed to describe itself as such must inevitably, in my
view, erode the singularity and exclusiveness of the description Champagne and
so cause the first [plaintiff] damage of an insidious but serious kind. … I
cannot see, despite the defendants’ argument to the contrary, any rational
basis upon which, if the defendants’ product were allowed to be marketed under
its present description, any other fruit cordial diluted with carbonated water
could not be similarly marketed so as to incorporate the description
champagne. The damage to the first [plaintiff] would then be incalculable but
severe.

127 The concept of loss of exclusivity or erosion of the distinctiveness of
the plaintiff’s get-up as a separate head of damage in passing off actions is
not an immediately obvious one. The danger of recognising such a head of
damages lies in truism: In almost all cases where the defendant is alleged to
have applied the plaintiff’s distinctive get-up not on the same or similar
goods or services as those of the plaintiff but, rather, on different goods or
services, there will likely be a loss of exclusivity by definition. On this
matter, Wadlow in _The Law of Passing-Off_ ([73] _supra_) warns that (at para
4-44):

Considered as a head of damage in its own right, loss of exclusivity in a
name, mark or get-up needs to be treated with caution. It lends itself to
circular arguments, thereby undermining the importance of damage as an
essential element of passing-off, and it leads easily to the fallacy that the
property which is being protected is the name or mark or get-up itself, rather
than the goodwill in the claimant’s business. In the normal course of events
there is little to be gained by enumerating loss of exclusivity as a separate
head of damage, since it overlaps with, or is an intermediate cause of,
several other heads of damage which are better established.

128 This is certainly the case on the facts of the present appeal. We have
found that the application of the name “Amanusa” to the Project is likely to
tarnish the goodwill attached to the “Aman” names because of the difference
between the quality of the accommodation provided by the Appellant and that of
the accommodation provided by the Respondents. One can also recast this by
saying that the “Aman” names, which have hitherto been used exclusively in
respect of high-end hotels, resorts and residential accommodation, would be in
danger of losing their distinctiveness if the Appellant were allowed to
continue using the name “Amanusa” for the Project as consumers might
mistakenly think that the goodwill in the “Aman” names extends to middle-class
residential accommodation in suburban Singapore. Thus, the inclusion of a
claim for loss of exclusivity or erosion of distinctiveness does not, in our
view, add anything to the Respondents’ claim.

129 The same is to be said of the Respondents’ claim for dilution of the
goodwill attached to the “Aman” names. The Respondents cited the _Millenia_
case ([36] _supra_) in support of the proposition that this head of damage is
recognised in Singapore. In the _Millenia_ case, this court stated (at [84]):

It would be commercially damaging for [the] business of a super deluxe ‘five-
star’ hotel, as [The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore] is, to be associated
with that of a ‘four-star’ hotel, which the [defendant’s “Millennium”] hotels
admittedly are. The reason for this is simple and is best illustrated in the
sale or provision of goods or services. _If there is a misrepresentation
induced by the defendant, such that the public is led to believe erroneously
that the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s goods or services are the same or
that their businesses are connected, the plaintiff’s goodwill in his business
would be likely to be diluted … if the defendant’s goods or services are of a
quality or class lower than that of the plaintiff’s._ Deceived into thinking
that the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s goods or services are the same or
that their businesses are connected, the public would mistakenly perceive the
plaintiff as having a range of lower quality goods or services which in
reality belong not to him but to the defendant. The public would not perceive
the plaintiff as supplying solely top-of-the-range goods or services but
[goods or services] of varying qualities. The prestigious image of the
plaintiff would in these circumstances be likely to be undermined. [emphasis
added]

130 We do not see this passage as holding anything more than that the
association of The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore (the plaintiff’s five-star
establishment) with the defendant’s four-star “Millennium” hotels would cause
tarnishment of the goodwill attached to the name “Millenia”. This, as we have
seen (at [97]–[98] above), is a conventional head of damage.

131 We shall have occasion to consider the technical and statutory definitions
of “dilution” in due course in the context of the Respondents’ claim under s
55 of the current TMA. It suffices for the moment to say that, to avoid
unnecessary confusion, it is better to avoid using the word “dilution” in a
passing off action when what is meant is simply tarnishment or blurring of the
goodwill in the plaintiff’s get-up.

**_Our conclusion on the passing off claim_**

132 We agree with the Judge’s finding that the Respondents’ claim for passing
off has been made out. Goodwill exists in the “Aman” names (but not in
“Aman”-prefixed names). Although the goodwill in the “Aman” names in Singapore
may not have reached across the entire spectrum of the public here, it
certainly does exist in respect of high-income individuals (who form the
Respondents’ core clientele), as well as once-in-a-lifetime visitors to the
Respondents’ resorts and aspiring visitors who have somewhat less means but
who are nonetheless attracted by the exclusivity and luxury embodied in the
“Aman” names in the field of hotel and resort accommodation. This section of
the public would have been exposed to the Appellant’s use of the name
“Amanusa” for the Project – _ie_ , to the Appellant’s misrepresentation that
the Project had the same source as or was in some way connected with the
Respondents’ resorts. They would have been likely to have been confused by
this misrepresentation into assuming that the Project was either developed by
the Respondents or somehow connected with the latter’s resorts. The
Respondents have not succeeded in convincing us on all their pleaded heads of
damage, but this is not significant as the Respondents have successfully
demonstrated a likelihood of damage in the form of: (a) tarnishment of the
goodwill attached to the “Aman” names due to the difference in quality between
the Aman resorts and the Project (see [101] above), and (b) restriction on the
Respondents’ expansion into the residential accommodation business in
Singapore (see [121] above).

**The claim under section 55 of the current TMA: Infringement of a well-known
trade mark**

133 Apart from pursuing a claim for passing off, the Respondents also claimed
that the “Aman” names were “well known trade mark[s]” within the meaning of s
2(1) of the current TMA and were entitled to the protection set out in s 55 of
that Act. Specifically, the Respondents alleged that the use of the name
“Amanusa” by the Appellant in the course of trade, without the Respondents’
consent, on goods or services related to residential accommodation would
indicate a connection between the Appellant’s residential accommodation-
related goods or services (specifically, the Project) and the Respondents, and
was likely to damage the Respondents’ interests (see s 55(3)(_a_) of the
current TMA).

**_What is a “well known trade mark”?_**

134 The first question to ask in considering a claim under s 55 of the current
TMA is what the term “well known trade mark” in this section means. According
to the definition set out in s 2(1) of the current TMA:

“well known trade mark” means —

(_a_) any registered trade mark that is well known in Singapore; or

(_b_) any unregistered trade mark that is well known in Singapore and that
belongs to a person who —

(i) is a national of a Convention country [_ie_ , a country which is a party
to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 20 March
1883 or a member of the World Trade Organization]; or

(ii) is domiciled in, or has a real and effective industrial or commercial
establishment in, a Convention country,

whether or not that person carries on business, or has any goodwill, in
Singapore …

135 This definition was adopted in order for Singapore to comply with its
obligations under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial
Property of 20 March 1883 (“the Paris Convention”) and the Agreement on Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“the TRIPS Agreement”), which
is set out in Annex 1C of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade
Organization signed in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994 (we shall have occasion to
refer to both the Paris Convention and the TRIPS Agreement in greater detail
at a later stage). The important development which underlies the current TMA
is the recognition that some _unregistered_ trade marks should be entitled to
protection, and that such protection does not depend on whether the proprietor
of the trade mark in question carries on business or has any goodwill in
Singapore. (For ease of discussion, we shall, in the context of the
Respondents’ claim under the current TMA, refer to the proprietor of a trade
mark as “the plaintiff” and the party whose trade mark allegedly infringes or
is in conflict with the plaintiff’s trade mark as “the defendant”; we shall
also use the terms “the plaintiff’s goods or services” and “the defendant’s
goods or services” to denote the goods or services to which the plaintiff’s
trade mark and the defendant’s trade mark, respectively, are applied.) This
constitutes a workaround the hard-line stance taken towards the “foreign
business problem” discussed earlier (at [67]–[68] above) in the context of the
tort of passing off. This development also to some extent represents the
erosion of the principle of the territoriality of trade marks (_viz_ , that
trade marks are entitled to protection only within the national borders of the
countries in which they are registered), but, at the same time, it must be
stressed that s 55 of the current TMA does not dispense with the
territoriality element entirely. A trade mark must still be “well known _in
Singapore_ ” [emphasis added] (see s 2(1) of the current TMA) before it is
entitled to enjoy the protection conferred by s 55.

136 In assessing whether a trade mark is “well known in Singapore” within the
meaning of s 2(1) of the current TMA, regard must be had to s 2(7), which
states:

Subject to [s 2(8)], in deciding, for the purposes of this Act [_ie_ , the
current TMA], whether a trade mark is well known in Singapore, it shall be
relevant to take into account any matter from which it may be inferred that
the trade mark is well known, including such of the following matters as may
be relevant:

(_a_) the degree to which the trade mark is known to or recognised by any
relevant sector of the public in Singapore;

(_b_) the duration, extent and geographical area of —

(i) any use of the trade mark; or

(ii) any promotion of the trade mark, including any advertising of, any
publicity given to, or any presentation at any fair or exhibition of, the
goods or services to which the trade mark is applied;

(_c_) any registration or application for the registration of the trade mark
in any country or territory in which the trade mark is used or recognised, and
the duration of such registration or application;

(_d_) any successful enforcement of any right in the trade mark in any country
or territory, and the extent to which the trade mark was recognised as well
known by the competent authorities of that country or territory;

(_e_) any value associated with the trade mark.

137 This definition is based on Art 2(1) of another document which we shall
examine in greater detail in due course, _viz_ , the Joint Recommendation
Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks (“the Joint
Recommendation”), which was adopted at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of
the Assemblies of the Member States of the World Intellectual Property
Organization (“WIPO”) held from 20 to 29 September 1999 (“the 34th WIPO
Meeting”). The factors laid out in ss 2(7)(_a_)–2(7)(_e_) of the current TMA
(which collectively correspond to Art 2(1)(b) of the Joint Recommendation) are
not an exhaustive list in that the court is obliged to take into account “
_any_ matter from which it may be inferred that the trade mark is well known”
[emphasis added] (_per_ s 2(7) of the current TMA). It appears that the court
is ordinarily free to disregard any or all of the factors listed in s 2(7) as
the case requires (subject to one particular factor which we shall discuss at
[139]–[140] below), and to take additional factors into consideration. The
list of factors in s 2(7) can thus be more accurately described as a set of
guidelines. This conclusion is supported by Art 2(1)(c) of the Joint
Recommendation, which refers to the factors listed in Art 2(1)(b) (_ie_ , the
equivalent of our ss 2(7)(_a_)–2(7)(_e_)) in the following manner:

The above factors, which are _guidelines_ to assist the competent authority to
determine whether the mark is a well-known mark, are _not pre-conditions_ for
reaching that determination. Rather, the determination in each case will
depend upon the particular circumstances of that case. In some cases all of
the factors may be relevant. In other cases some of the factors may be
relevant. In still other cases none of the factors may be relevant, and the
decision may be based on additional factors that are not listed in
subparagraph (b), above [_ie_ , Art 2(1)(b)]. Such additional factors may be
relevant, alone, or in combination with one or more of the factors listed in
subparagraph (b), above. [emphasis added]

138 This somewhat ambivalent passage gives an inkling of how difficult it is
to determine whether a trade mark is well known in Singapore. There is no
single universally-applicable test, but the guidelines in s 2(7) of the
current TMA strive toward some semblance of objectivity.

139 There has been some significant and interesting debate among legal
commentators on the actual scope of ss 2(7)(_c_)–2(7)(_e_) of the current TMA.
However, as the instant case does not turn on the consideration of these
factors, we shall limit our discussion to s 2(7)(_a_) (primarily) and s
2(7)(_b_) of the current TMA. Despite what has been said earlier, it can be
persuasively said that s 2(7)(_a_) is arguably the most crucial factor when
determining whether a trade mark is well known in Singapore. This is because,
by virtue of s 2(8) of the current TMA:

Where it is determined that a trade mark is well known to any relevant sector
of the public in Singapore, the trade mark shall be deemed to be well known in
Singapore.

140 This deeming provision suggests that the court cannot disregard s
2(7)(_a_) (which looks at “the degree to which the trade mark is _known to or
recognised by any relevant sector of the public in Singapore_ ” [emphasis
added]) in its deliberations. Indeed, it appears that all the other factors
listed in s 2(7) are irrelevant once it is determined that the trade mark in
question is well known to “any relevant sector of the public in Singapore”
(_per_ s 2(7)(_a_)).

141 Section 2(9) of the current TMA elaborates on who constitutes the
“relevant sector of the public in Singapore” as follows:

In [ss 2(7) and 2(8)], “relevant sector of the public in Singapore” includes
any of the following:

(_a_) all actual consumers and potential consumers in Singapore of the goods
or services to which the trade mark is applied;

(_b_) all persons in Singapore involved in the distribution of the goods or
services to which the trade mark is applied;

(_c_) all businesses and companies in Singapore dealing in the goods or
services to which the trade mark is applied.

142 The ambit of these categories, in particular s 2(9)(_a_), is in dispute in
this case. The Appellant argues that s 2(9)(_a_) should be read as covering
all actual consumers and potential consumers in Singapore of _the type of
goods or services_ to which the plaintiff’s trade mark is applied, while the
Respondents contend that the provision should be taken to mean what it says –
_ie_ , one considers actual consumers and potential consumers of,
specifically, _the plaintiff’s goods or services_ only. The former
interpretation, which encompasses a wider group of persons within the
“relevant sector of the public in Singapore”, makes it harder for the
plaintiff to show that its trade mark is well known in Singapore and this is,
presumably, the Appellant’s aim in advancing this particular interpretation in
the present appeal.

143 There is an overarching policy question, applicable to the general
construction of all provisions on the protection of well-known trade marks,
which reflects a tension between two key positions. On the one hand, well-
known trade marks are usually the result of careful planning, hard work, large
investments in branding and marketing as well as an established presence in a
market. From this perspective, well-known trade marks deserve to be protected
because of the time, effort and money which have been expended on their
development and promotion. Alternatively, one could justify protection of
well-known trade marks from a consumer welfare perspective, in that such trade
marks perform crucial signalling, symbolic and even myth-making roles in
society. These views may lead one to conclude that well-known trade marks
should be given greater protection than what may loosely be called “ordinary”
trade marks (_ie_ , trade marks which do not satisfy the definition of “well
known trade mark[s]” in s 2(1) of the current TMA).

144 On the other hand, one may legitimately ask whether well-known trade marks
deserve any better protection than ordinary trade marks. There are strong
economic and social reasons why the answer to this question may well be “no”.
Monopolies and barriers to entry created by strong trade mark protection are
disincentives to competition and distort the proper functioning of the free
market economy. Socially, the commercial monopolisation of words and symbols
is detrimental to free enterprise, whether of a commercial or a private
nature, in so far as well-known trade marks are likely to be important
subjects of everyday commentary, comparison and critique. Even if strong
protection of well-known trade marks is justified, some argue that the extra-
special rights which accompany such protection should be strictly limited to
an extremely small group of particularly well-known trade marks.

145 On the present point of how s 2(9)(_a_) of the current TMA should be
construed (see [142] above), we are of the view that the Respondents have a
stronger case. The point made by the Appellant is that the Respondents’
interpretation of s 2(9)(_a_) (_ie_ , that the consumers referred to in that
provision are limited to actual consumers and potential consumers of,
specifically, the plaintiff’s goods or services only) would make it too easy
for a trade mark to be deemed to be well known in Singapore. It is argued that
the nature of the test itself – which is based on the viewpoint of “ _any_
relevant sector of the public” [emphasis added] (see s 2(7)(_a_) and s 2(8) of
the current TMA) – already means that any trade mark which is known to even
the smallest and most exclusive of niche markets can become well known in
Singapore. Furthermore, according to the Appellant, the miniscule size of the
overall market in Singapore makes it very easy for even a small marketing
campaign to establish awareness of a trade mark among “any relevant sector of
the public”.

146 Notwithstanding the Appellant’s arguments, there are, in our view, sound
reasons why it is inappropriate to demand that a trade mark must be well known
across an entire country before it is regarded as a well-known trade mark. The
explanatory notes which accompany the Joint Recommendation (“the Explanatory
Notes”) explain this well at para 2.15 _vis-à-vis_ Art 2(2)(b) of the Joint
Recommendation (which is the equivalent of s 2(8) of the current TMA):

It is not permitted to apply a more stringent test such as, for example, that
the mark be well known by the public at large. The reason for this is that
marks are often used in relation to goods or services which are directed to
certain sectors of the public such as, for example, customers belonging to a
certain group of income, age or sex. _An extensive definition of the sector of
the public which should have knowledge of the mark would not further the
purpose of international protection of well-known marks_ , namely to prohibit
use or registration of such marks by unauthorized parties with the intention
of either passing off their goods or services as those of the real owner of
the mark, or selling the right to the owner of the well-known mark. [emphasis
added]

147 The power of the deeming provision in s 2(8) of the current TMA (see [139]
above) should also not be overstated. It must be noted that before a well-
known trade mark qualifies to be protected under s 55, it must still be found
to be (broadly speaking) in conflict with the defendant’s trade mark. This
area will be more fully explored in subsequent sections of this judgment; it
suffices for present purposes to note three points. First, the additional
protection granted to a trade mark that is well known in Singapore (as
compared to the protection granted to ordinary trade marks) is not very
extensive. By comparison, far greater protection is granted to trade marks
which are “well known to _the public at large_ in Singapore” [emphasis added]
(see, _inter alia_ , s 55(3)(_b_) and s 55(4)(_b_)).

148 Second, the deeming provision in s 2(8) does not (and should not) mean
that every person in Singapore is deemed to _actually_ know of the plaintiff’s
(well-known) trade mark. The likelihood of confusion between the plaintiff on
the one hand and the defendant’s goods or services on the other must still be
proved (at least where the plaintiff seeks to avail itself of certain
subsections of s 55), and, for this purpose, the fact that a well-known trade
mark is known only to a niche market may make it harder to show a likelihood
of confusion.

149 Third, the deeming provision in s 2(8) still requires the trade mark in
question to be “ _well_ known” [emphasis added] to the relevant sector of the
public in Singapore. In this regard, it is interesting that Singapore did not
implement Art 2(2)(c) of the Joint Recommendation, which provides that a mark
which is merely “known” to the relevant sector of the public “may” be
considered to be _well_ known. All this suggests that there are different
degrees of public knowledge of a trade mark, and the requisite level of
knowledge required under Singapore’s legislation tends towards the higher end
of the scale: _ie_ , to qualify for protection under s 55 of the current TMA,
the trade mark concerned must be more than merely “known” to the relevant
sector of the public in Singapore. This understanding is borne out by our
legislature’s intention in enacting s 55 of the current TMA (and the related
provisions therein pertaining to well-known trade marks). At the second
reading of the Trade Marks (Amendment) Bill 2004 (Bill 18 of 2004), _ie_ , the
Bill which led to the enactment of the current s 55 and the other relevant
accompanying provisions, Prof S Jayakumar, the Minister for Law, stated (see
_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (15 June 2004) vol 78 at
col 111):

[T]he Bill will give better protection [to] well-known marks. These are marks
which are famous and known to many people. Their owners would have invested
substantial amounts of time and money … to generate the high levels of
recognition and goodwill associated with these marks.

150 The current TMA, when read in conjunction with the Joint Recommendation,
also does not lend support to the Appellant’s contention (_viz_ , that s
2(9)(_a_) of the current TMA should be interpreted as referring to actual
consumers and potential consumers of the type of goods or services to which
the plaintiff’s trade mark is applied, regardless of whether or not such
consumers are _the plaintiff’s_ actual or potential customers). Article
2(2)(a)(i) of the Joint Recommendation (which formed the basis for s 2(9)(_a_)
of the current TMA), in referring to “actual and/or potential consumers of
_the type of goods and/or services_ to which the mark [is applied]” [emphasis
added], differs crucially from s 2(9)(_a_). This departure (in s 2(9)(_a_) of
the current TMA) from the wording used in Art 2(2)(a)(i) of the Joint
Recommendation may in itself signal our legislature’s intentions. Besides,
even the commentary on Art 2(2)(a)(i) of the Joint Recommendation appears to
focus on consumers of _the plaintiff’s_ goods or services specifically rather
than the more general category of consumers of a particular type of good or
service (see the Explanatory Notes at para 2.12):

The expression “consumers” is to be understood in the wide sense of the term,
and should not be restricted to those persons who actually and physically
consume the product. In that respect, reference can be made to the term
“consumer protection” which covers all parts of the consuming public. Because
the nature of the goods or services to which a mark is applied can vary
considerably, _actual and/or potential consumers can be different in each
case. Groups of actual and/or potential consumers may be identified with the
help of parameters such as the target group for the goods and services in
relation to which the mark is used or the group of actual purchasers._
[emphasis added]

151 Similarly, in respect of Art 2(2)(a)(iii) of the Joint Recommendation
(which corresponds to our s 2(9)(_c_)), the Explanatory Notes state (at para
2.14):

The business circles which deal with the goods and/or services to which a mark
[is applied] are in general constituted by importers, wholesalers, licensees
or franchisees interested and prepared to deal in _the goods or services to
which the mark [is applied]_. [emphasis added]

This position (_viz_ , that s 2(9)(_a_) of the current TMA refers to only
actual consumers and potential consumers of the plaintiff’s goods or services)
is also supported by authority. The second sentence of Art 16(2) of the TRIPS
Agreement, which (broadly speaking) corresponds to s 2(7)(_a_) of the current
TMA in so far as the assessment of whether a trade mark is well known is
concerned, states that “[i]n determining whether a trademark is well-known …
account [shall be taken] of the knowledge of the trademark in the relevant
sector of the public”. Frederick W Mostert notes in _Famous and Well-known
Marks: An International Analysis_ (International Trademark Association, 2nd
Ed, 2004) at p 1-36 that:

The probable interpretation [of Art 16(2) of the TRIPS Agreement] is that it
must be shown that the target audience – the relevant trade circle or the
relevant class of consumers for which the _particular_ goods or services are
destined – has knowledge of the mark. In other words, the specific sector of
the public within which the _particular_ goods or services are purchased or
used, or where the mark is exposed through advertising, should become the
focus of the factual enquiry. The focus will very much depend on the type of
goods or the nature of the services involved. [emphasis added]

152 We also agree with the Respondents that expanding the realm of the
“relevant sector of the public in Singapore” mentioned in s 2(7)(_a_) and s
2(8) of the current TMA to include actual consumers and potential consumers of
the _type_ of goods or services to which the plaintiff’s trade mark is applied
does not really assist the Appellant. The concept of a “type” of goods or
services is not useful. The problem is one of definition – for instance, in
the present case, would the relevant type of goods or services encompass the
entire hotel and resort market as a whole, or only the high-end hotel and
resort market? Or, could the relevant type of goods or services be even more
limited (_eg_ , the market for high-end hotels and resorts in Bali
specifically)? In contrast, the inquiry is much more focused and manageable if
one looks only at the specific goods or services to which the plaintiff’s
trade mark has been applied (_ie_ , if one considers only _the plaintiff’s_
goods or services).

153 The Appellant argues that such an approach is tautological in that the
plaintiff’s actual customers and potential customers would naturally know of
the plaintiff’s trade mark. This is not, however, always the case. The
plaintiff could be but one of many producers or suppliers of similar goods or
services, and its customers may equally happily purchase those goods or
services from other sources without paying attention to what trade mark is
attached to the goods or services which they buy. The plaintiff’s advertising
could also have been unsuccessful, thus leaving no imprint of the plaintiff’s
trade mark on the target market.

154 Applying the law to the facts, we find that the Judge correctly identified
the relevant sector of the public in Singapore as the actual and/or potential
consumers of the Respondents’ good and services. We also find that there has
been a great deal of promotion of the “Aman” names targeted at this group of
consumers, and that the “Aman” names enjoy an established reputation among
this group (see in this regard, respectively, s 2(7)(_b_)(ii) and s 2(7)(_a_)
of the current TMA). As we indicated earlier (at [139] above), there is some
ambiguity as to the application of some of the other factors listed in s 2(7)
of the current TMA. Since it is clear to us that the “Aman” names are well
known in Singapore when considered from the viewpoint of the factors listed in
s 2(7)(_a_) and s 2(7)(_b_), we decline to express any opinion as to whether
and to what extent the factors set out in ss 2(7)(_c_)–2(7)(_e_) are
applicable to the facts of the instant case. Further, since the “Aman” names
are “known to or recognised by any relevant sector of the public in Singapore”
(see s 2(7)(_a_)), it follows that, by virtue of s 2(8), they are to be deemed
to be well known in Singapore.

**_The protection afforded by section 55(3)(_ a _) of the current TMA_**

155 The Respondents argued that the “Aman” names, being trade marks which were
well known in Singapore, were entitled to protection under s 55(3) of the
current TMA from the Appellant’s use. Section 55(3) states:

Subject to [ss 55(6) and 55(7)], the proprietor of a well known trade mark
shall be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Singapore, in the
course of trade and without the proprietor’s consent, of any trade mark which,
or an essential part of which, is identical with or similar to the
proprietor’s trade mark, in relation to any goods or services, where the use
of the trade mark —

(_a_) would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the
proprietor, and is likely to damage the interests of the proprietor; or

(_b_) if the proprietor’s trade mark is well known to the public at large in
Singapore —

(i) would cause dilution in an unfair manner of the distinctive character of
the proprietor’s trade mark; or

(ii) would take unfair advantage of the distinctive character of the
proprietor’s trade mark.

156 As mentioned earlier (see [29] above), the Respondents eventually relied
on only s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA in the court below, and the parties’
submissions were largely confined to that subsection. It will be seen,
however, that s 55(3)(_a_) must be construed and applied as one part of the
entire scheme relating to the protection of well-known trade marks.

_The meaning of “use … in the course of trade … of any trade mark” in section
55(3)_

157 There was a preliminary issue as to whether the Appellant’s use of the
name “Amanusa” at the Showflat and in various promotional materials relating
to the Project was “use … in the course of trade … of any trade mark” (see s
55(3) of the current TMA). Section 2(1) of the current TMA defines a “trade
mark” as:

… any sign capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of
distinguishing goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade
by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other
person …

158 The Appellant argued that its use of the name “Amanusa” was not use of
that name as a trade mark because the name was not used as “a badge of trade
origin” (_per_ Andrew Phang Boon Leong J in _Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd v
Oystertec Plc_ [2006] 1 SLR 712 (“the _Nation Fittings_ case”) at [136]).

159 We do not think this submission could have been put forward with much
conviction. The _Nation Fittings_ case dealt with trade marks consisting of
two-dimensional diagrammatic representations of pipe-fittings, which trade
marks were allegedly infringed by real-life three-dimensional pipe-fittings
made to those specifications. It was held that the trade marks had not in fact
been used as trade marks as there was no evidence that they had been perceived
as a badge of trade origin (_id_ at [136]).

160 The situation in the present case is obviously quite different. For one,
the trade marks concerned are straightforward names. The Appellant has applied
the name “Amanusa” to what one may reasonably call its “goods”– _ie_ , the
Project. We appreciate that not all names of residential developments are
source-indicators. Many of them are more akin to personal names of people in
that they are “identifiers” (_ie_ , each name identifies the particular
residential development to which it has been applied) rather than indicators
of source. But, it is also _possible_ for the name of a residential
development to be seen as an indicator of source, particularly where it is the
same as or similar to another name which has been used as an indicator of
source. The “Aman” names have clearly been used in the latter sense (_ie_ , as
indicators of source) primarily because of the “Aman” prefix which is common
to all of these names.

_The meaning of “would indicate a connection between those goods or services
and the proprietor” in section 55(3)(_ a _)_

161 One area of serious dispute between the parties was whether the
requirement in s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA of “a connection between [the
defendant’s] goods or services and the [plaintiff]” entailed that there had to
be a likelihood of confusion that the plaintiff: (a) was the source of the
defendant’s goods or services; or (b) had licensed the use of its (_ie_ , the
plaintiff’s) well-known trade mark on the defendant’s goods or services; or
(c) had endorsed the defendant’s goods or services (the word “confusion” as
used in the rest of this judgment should be read as denoting these particular
forms of confusion, which, in essence, involve confusion between the plaintiff
on the one hand and the defendant’s goods or services on the other). Given our
finding in the context of the Respondents’ passing off claim that a likelihood
of confusion (in the sense just described) exists (see [93] above), the
question is actually academic for the purposes of this appeal. However, as
this question – _viz_ , whether s 55(3)(_a_) incorporates a requirement that
there must be a likelihood of confusion (“the confusion requirement”) –
touches on a crucial and difficult area of law which requires clarification,
we shall nevertheless set out our views on it.

162 The scope of the problem can be appreciated from a brief overview of the
somewhat byzantine history of trade mark legislation in Singapore. Section 55
of the current TMA and the other sections therein dealing with well-known
trade marks are the product of two stages of legislative development. The
first stage consisted of the enactment of the Trade Marks Act 1998 (Act 46 of
1998) (“the 1998 TMA”), which came into effect on 15 January 1999. This was
necessary in order for Singapore to comply with Art 16 of the TRIPS Agreement,
which was in the main an elaboration of the rights given to well-known trade
marks by Art 6 _bis_ of the Paris Convention. The provisions of the 1998 TMA
were largely Singapore’s own work based on the wording of Art 16 of the TRIPS
Agreement, but Singapore also took the opportunity to incorporate s 56(2) of
the Trade Marks Act 1994 (c 26) (UK) (“the English Trade Marks Act”), which
our parliament enacted as s 55(2) of the 1998 TMA.

163 Amendments were made to the 1998 TMA in 2004 via the Trade Marks
(Amendment) Act 2004 (Act 20 of 2004). These amendments, which we shall refer
to as “the 2004 TMA amendments”, constituted the second stage of the
legislative development which culminated in the enactment of s 55 (and the
relevant accompanying provisions) of the current TMA. The impetus for the 2004
TMA amendments came from the signing of the United States-Singapore Free Trade
Agreement (“the FTA”). The FTA obliged Singapore to adopt the standards for
the protection of well-known trade marks set out in the Joint Recommendation,
which standards are even higher than those contained in the TRIPS Agreement
(the standards set by the Joint Recommendation are the so-called “TRIPS-plus”
standards). The Joint Recommendation is itself what some might call a legal
platypus. It is an amalgam of Art 16 of the TRIPS Agreement, the law of
dilution in American jurisprudence, as well as the law relating to trade marks
with a reputation in the European Union (“the EU”) as set out in the First
Directive 89/104/EEC of the Council, of 21 December 1988, to Approximate the
Laws of the Member States Relating to Trade Marks (“the EU Directive”) – all
of these condensed into a single section, namely, Art 4(1)(b) of the Joint
Recommendation.

164 The 2004 TMA amendments are largely based on the wording of the Joint
Recommendation, and Singapore remains the only country in the world to have
adopted Art 4(1)(b) of the Joint Recommendation in its entirety. Even so,
small but important changes were made by our legislature, so the grafting
exercise was not perfect. At the same time, Singapore directly imported the
definition of “dilution” set out in the US Trademark Act of 1946 (or, as it is
commonly known, “the Lanham Act”) – specifically, the definition in s 45 of
the Lanham Act (15 USC (US) § 1127), as amended by s 4 of the Federal
Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, Pub L No 104-98, 109 Stat 985 (“the FTDA”) –
into our local trade mark legislation, even though this definition was not
contained in the Joint Recommendation.

165 Trying to decipher the law on well-known trade marks in Singapore can be
akin to engaging in a game of Chinese whispers. We propose to adopt a more
reliable route by following history’s trail. The story of the protection of
well-known trade marks actually has a number of themes, the chief of which is
probably the erosion of the territoriality principle of trade mark law.
However, that issue is not our concern in the present appeal; instead, our
focus will be on the issue of confusion and its cousin, dilution. These issues
are related because the removal of the confusion requirement (as defined at
[161] above) from s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA would in effect mean that
this provision protects a well-known trade mark against dilution. In analysing
whether or not s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA should be interpreted thus
(_ie_ , as not incorporating the confusion requirement), we shall first
examine the international movement towards granting greater protection to
well-known trade marks, which culminated in the TRIPS Agreement. An overview
of the law of dilution in the US follows. We will then look at developments in
Europe arising from the EU Directive. These three legal systems will form the
basis for analysing whether the confusion requirement is part and parcel of
the regime under the Joint Recommendation. We shall also touch briefly on the
position in Australia. Finally, the conclusions reached will be linked back to
the current TMA.

(1) International developments

166 Article 6 _bis_ of the Paris Convention is the grandfather of provisions
on the international protection of well-known trade marks. Well-known trade
marks were first mentioned at the Diplomatic Conference for the Revision of
the Paris Convention (referred to hereafter as the “Diplomatic Conference” for
short) held at The Hague in 1925, but there were already references to the
protection of a trade mark in countries other than the mark’s country of
origin at the earlier Diplomatic Conference held in Washington in 1911. The
essential elements of the scope of protection for well-known trade marks were
outlined at The Hague in 1925. Article 6 _bis_ , as it stood then, related to
trade marks which were identical or similar to a well-known trade mark or, to
use the language of the provision, “which constitute[d] a reproduction, an
imitation, or a translation” of that mark. The scope of protection was limited
to situations in which the trade mark which reproduced, imitated or translated
the plaintiff’s well-known trade mark was applied to identical or similar
goods (but not services). Importantly, the provision also required that the
defendant’s trade mark had to be “liable to create confusion” – _ie_ , Art 6
_bis_ expressly incorporated the confusion requirement.

167 Subsequent changes were made to the 1925 version of Art 6 _bis_ of the
Paris Convention at the Diplomatic Conference held in London in 1934 and the
Diplomatic Conference held in Lisbon in 1958, but those changes did not affect
the portions of Art 6 _bis_ that are material to us in the present appeal. The
Diplomatic Conference held in Stockholm in 1967 adopted the version of Art 6
_bis_ propounded at Lisbon without any changes.

168 The next major development _vis-à-vis_ the protection of well-known trade
marks came in the form of the TRIPS Agreement, which was concluded under the
aegis of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”). Under Art 2(1) of the TRIPS
Agreement, WTO member states must comply with various provisions of the Paris
Convention, including Art 6 _bis._ The TRIPS Agreement, which came into force
on 1 January 1996, expanded the scope of the protection provided by Art 6
_bis_ of the Paris Convention in a number of ways. First, under Art 16(2) of
the TRIPS Agreement, the protection set out in Art 6 _bis_ was extended to
services.

169 Second, under Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement, Art 6 _bis_ of the Paris
Convention was to apply _mutatis mutandis_ to situations where the defendant’s
goods or services were _dissimilar_ to the plaintiff’s goods or services
_provided that_ the defendant’s use of the plaintiff’s trade mark in relation
to the defendant’s goods or services would indicate “a connection” (_per_ Art
16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement) between those goods or services and the
plaintiff and provided that the interests of the plaintiff would be “likely to
be damaged by such use” (_ibid_). Notably, Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement
did not mention the “liable to create confusion” requirement (_ie_ , the
confusion requirement) contained in Art 6 _bis_ of the Paris Convention.

170 There is thus some debate as to whether Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement
did away with the confusion requirement or whether the “connection” and the
“likely to be damaged” conditions in that provision were _in addition to_
(rather than in lieu of) the confusion requirement. David Vaver, in
“Unconventional and Well-Known Trade Marks” [2005] Sing JLS 1, argues (at 14,
n 49) that if confusion were a requirement under Art 16(3) of the TRIPS
Agreement, it would have been explicitly stated and the drafters of Art 16(3)
would not merely have used the words “indicate a connection”, particularly
because the requirement of “a likelihood of confusion” is expressly stated in
Art 16(1) of the TRIPS Agreement. In contrast, Ng-Loy Wee Loon, in “The IP
Chapter in the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement” (2004) 16 SAcLJ 42 at 52,
takes the alternative view (_viz_ , that the confusion requirement remains
part and parcel of Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement), which we agree with.
Article 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement explicitly uses the words “ _mutatis
mutandis_ ”, which suggest that only obvious and necessary changes should be
effected to Art 6 _bis_ of the Paris Convention. As such, in our view, the
“liable to create confusion” requirement in Art 6 _bis_ likewise applies _vis-
à-vis_ Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement.

171 Indeed, nothing in Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement necessitates the
removal of the confusion requirement. If the confusion requirement were not
preserved, it is hard to see what is left of Art 6 _bis_. Furthermore,
comparisons between Art 16(1) and Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement are inapt.
The former is an independent provision which does not seek to refer to Art
_6bis_ in any way.

172 In support of their contention that the confusion requirement was not part
and parcel of Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement, the Respondents cited two
authorities (apart from Art 16(1) and Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement), but
we think neither is clearly supportive of their position. The first is Daniel
Gervais, _The TRIPS Agreement: Drafting History and Analysis_ (Sweet &
Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2003), where the learned author comments (at p 174):

Art. 16(3) [of the TRIPS Agreement] protects against “dilution” of a mark,
including use detrimental to a mark’s reputation (not necessarily a well-known
mark), its quality indication, usually leading to depreciation of the goodwill
attached to it, even in cases where there is no likelihood of confusion.
[emphasis in original omitted]

But, oddly, Gervais’s definition of “dilution” seems to include an element of
confusion for Gervais goes on to say (_ibid_):

Through the reference to Art. 6 _bis_ , Art. 16(3) also protects the public
against the _confusing_ effects of such use. [emphasis added]

In so far as Gervais is advocating the view that there are two different tests
– one involving confusion and the other, dilution – to be satisfied before the
protection under Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement can be invoked, this
conflicts with the aim of Art 16(3), which was intended to prescribe a single
minimum standard for WTO member states to comply with.

173 The same ambivalence is to be found in a joint publication by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Centre for
Trade and Sustainable Development, _Resource Book on TRIPS and Development_
(Cambridge University Press, 2005) (“the _TRIPS Resource Book_ ”), which the
Respondents also referred to. Paragraph 3.2.3 of the _TRIPS Resource Book_
states:

[I]f there is no likelihood of confusion in the _ordinary_ trademark sense,
Article 16.3 indicates that the finder of fact should proceed to ask whether a
consumer would consider there to be a connection between the goods, even if
not part of a natural product line expansion … [emphasis in original]

In our view, the above extract still appears to be referring to a scenario
involving confusion, albeit not of the straightforward kind where the consumer
mistakenly assumes that the plaintiff itself made, provided or endorsed the
defendant’s goods or services (described in the _TRIPS Resource Book_ (at para
3.2.3) as “confusion in the _ordinary_ trademark sense” [emphasis in
original]). The _TRIPS Resource Book_ describes the ambit of Art 16(3) of the
TRIPS Agreement as covering the situation where (_ibid_):

… the goods or services for which the confusingly similar trademark is used
are different from those goods or services that are covered by the well-known
mark.

174 The passage cited by the Respondents also goes on to describe what
constitutes a situation with “no likelihood of confusion in the ordinary
trademark sense” [emphasis in original omitted] (_ibid_) as follows (_ibid_):

Would a consumer seeing the term “AUDI” on a television set think that there
was a connection with the automobile company? In recent years there has been
an increasing tendency for producers well known in one area of commerce to
market [_sic_] into un-related lines of commerce. Would it have been
anticipated, for example, that the “Marlboro” and “Camel” cigarette marks
would be used on clothing and shoes?

With respect, all of these examples are nothing more than examples of
confusion, albeit arising from the consumer’s mistaken impression that the
plaintiff has extended the use of its trade mark to products unrelated to the
goods or services in respect of which its trade mark has hitherto been
applied, or has licensed such use of its trade mark. There is nothing to
suggest that the learned authors of the _TRIPS Resource Book_ were considering
examples where there was truly no likelihood of confusion at all but Art 16(3)
of the TRIPS Agreement still applied.

175 Indeed, it is arguable that the reference in Art 16(3) of the TRIPS
Agreement to “a connection between [the defendant’s] goods or services and the
_owner_ of the registered trade mark [_ie_ , the plaintiff]” [emphasis added]
means that there must be confusion. How else would the owner of the well-known
trade mark (_ie_ , the plaintiff) be connected with the defendant’s goods or
services except through the owner being assumed to have either: (a) produced,
provided or endorsed the defendant’s goods or services, or (b) licensed the
use of its (_ie_ , the owner’s) trade mark on the defendant’s goods or
services? It would have been different if Art 16(3) had spoken of a connection
between the defendant’s and the plaintiff’s respective trade marks, or between
the defendant’s goods or services and the plaintiff’s trade mark. The
provision might then have covered dilution in the sense that the plaintiff’s
trade mark now represents not just its own goods or services, but the
defendant’s goods or services too. A similar point was made in Michael
Handler, “Trade Mark Dilution in Australia?” [2007] EIPR 307 (“Handler’s
article”) at 309:

The focus of anti-dilution law is on conduct that causes harm to the mark
itself: the aim is to protect the mark’s inherent “selling power” as distinct
from its ability to guarantee the trade origin of particular goods or
services. Thus, not only does anti-dilution law not depend on the existence of
consumer confusion, but it does not even look to consumers’ responses as to
the existence or otherwise of any connection between the defendant’s goods or
services and the owner of the mark in order to determine liability. Yet Art.
16.3 [of the TRIPS Agreement] requires that, as a minimum standard, [WTO]
members base liability for [the] defendant’s use of a well-known mark on
dissimilar goods or services on a finding of such a connection.

176 Handler also points out that WTO member states do not seem to have
interpreted Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement as prescribing a minimum standard
– which is _not_ based on confusion – for the protection of well-known trade
marks. For instance, Singapore made the confusion requirement explicit, at
least in the 1998 TMA (see s 55(2) thereof). Likewise, the Trademark Law of
the People’s Republic of China, as adopted on 23 August 1982 and subsequently
amended (for the second time) on 27 October 2001 (available at
<http://www.china.org.  
cn/government/laws/2007-04/21/content_1207502.htm> (accessed 14 February
2009)), states at Art 13:

Where a trademark in respect of which the application for registration is
filed for use for identical or similar goods is a reproduction, [an] imitation
or [a] translation of another person’s trademark not registered in China and
likely to cause confusion, it shall be rejected for registration and
prohibited from use.

Where a trademark in respect of which the application for registration is
filed [for] use for non-identical or dissimilar goods is a reproduction, [an]
imitation or [a] translation of the well-known mark of another person that has
been registered in China, _misleads the [public]_ and is likely to create
prejudice to the interests of the well-known [mark’s] registrant, it shall be
rejected for registration and prohibited from use.

[emphasis added]

177 Similarly, the EU Directive makes protection against dilution (as set out
in Art 5(2) of that directive) merely an _optional_ measure. In contrast, if
Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement indeed did not incorporate the confusion
requirement – _ie_ , if Art 16(3) were indeed an anti-dilution provision –
then protection against dilution would have been _mandatory_ under the EU
Directive. That said, the US has taken the opposite view and considers Art
16(3) to be an anti-dilution provision. We shall discuss the corresponding
provisions in the EU Directive and the Joint Recommendation in due course; for
now, we shall turn our attention to the position under US law.

(2) The US law of dilution

178 Dilution, as it presently exists in American law, is described in
_Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition_ (1995) (“the _Restatement_ ”) at §
25, as follows:

(1) One may be subject to liability under the law of trademarks for the use of
a designation that resembles the trademark, trade name, collective mark, or
certification mark of another _without proof of a likelihood of confusion_
only under an applicable antidilution statute. An actor is subject to
liability under an antidilution statute if the actor uses such a designation
in a manner that is likely to associate the other’s mark with the goods,
services, or business of the actor and:

(a) the other’s mark is highly distinctive and the association of the mark
with the actor’s goods, services, or business is likely to cause a reduction
in that distinctiveness; or

(b) the association of the other’s mark with the actor’s goods, services, or
business, or the nature of the actor’s use, is likely to disparage the other’s
goods, services, or business or tarnish the images associated with the other’s
mark.

[emphasis added]

179 The concept of dilution was first articulated by the American academic,
Frank I Schechter, in his landmark article, “The Rational Basis of Trademark
Protection” (1926–1927) 40 Harv L Rev 813, which was in turn based on the
German concept of _Verwässerung_. Schechter’s innovation was to suggest that
the protection of the distinctiveness of a trade mark was “the only rational
basis” (at 831) for trade mark protection, and that a trade mark should be
protected from “the gradual whittling away or dispersion of [its] identity and
hold upon the public mind … by its use upon non-competing goods” (at 825).
This concept became known as the “blurring” aspect of dilution (see § 25(1)(a)
of the _Restatement_ (reproduced at [178] above)). Crucially, it is _not_
necessary to show confusion for the purposes of establishing dilution by
blurring – as distinct from blurring in the context of damage to goodwill
under the tort of passing off (as we have seen (at [97] above), damage to
goodwill by blurring is made out only if there is a likelihood of confusion).
Schechter, in _Hearings Before the House Committee on Patents_ , 72d Cong 15
(1932), gave the following example of dilution by blurring (see Miles J
Alexander & Michael K Heilbronner, “Dilution under section 43(c) of the Lanham
Act” (1996) 59 Law & Contemp Probs 93 at 98, n 27):

If you allow Rolls Royce restaurants and Rolls Royce cafeterias, and Rolls
Royce candy, in ten years you will not have the Rolls Royce marks any more.

In Schechter’s example, although consumers may not think that the other “Rolls
Royce”-labelled goods or services really originate from the same source as
“Rolls Royce” cars, it may become more difficult for consumers to associate
the “Rolls Royce” name with hyper-luxurious cars specifically as the use of
that name for non-automobile related goods or services becomes established.

180 Although Schechter only referred to dilution by blurring, it has become
established that there is another form of dilution, _viz_ , by tarnishment.
There is no need to show confusion either for the purposes of proving dilution
by tarnishment. Dilution by tarnishment occurs when a trade mark is used in a
negative way which affects the positive associations that consumers had
previously made with the mark. The _Restatement_ gives the following rather
vivid example in Illustration 3 to § 25(1)(b):

A, a bank, uses the designation “Cookie Jar” to identify its automatic teller
machines. B opens a topless bar across the street from A under the trade name
“Cookie Jar.” Although prospective customers of A are unlikely to believe that
A operates or sponsors the bar, B is subject to liability to A for tarnishment
under an applicable antidilution statute if the customers are likely to
associate A’s mark or A’s business with the images evoked by B’s use.

In this example, although consumers are not confused into thinking that A (the
bank) operates B’s topless bar, whenever they hear the name “Cookie Jar”, they
cannot help but think of topless bars because of B’s diluting usage of that
name.

181 It was not always the case that both forms of dilution were recognised,
and the history of this area of the law of dilution is important in the
present case. The first state anti-dilution statute was passed by
Massachusetts in 1947. That statute became the basis of the Model State
Trademark Bill of 1964, which in turn became the basis of anti-dilution
legislation in several more states. However, it was only much later that
dilution became recognised at the federal level with the implementation of the
FTDA in 1996. The FTDA was introduced to effect amendments to the Lanham Act
in an effort to harmonise state dilution laws, which had initially faced
substantial suspicion from the courts.

182 It is important to note that the FTDA was intended to cover both blurring
and tarnishment as forms of protectable dilution. This can be seen from the
House of Representatives’ statement in H R Rep No 104-374 (1995) (“the 1995
House Report”) that the objective of the FTDA was “to protect famous
trademarks from subsequent uses that [blurred] the distinctiveness of the mark
or tarnish[ed] or disparage[d] it, even in the absence of a likelihood of
confusion” (at 2).

183  Section 3 of the FTDA added a new s 43(c) to the Lanham Act (15 USC (US)
§ 1125) (“the 1996 version of s 43(c) of the Lanham Act”), which provided a
cause of action for dilution of famous trade marks. Subsection (1) of the 1996
version of s 43(c) of the Lanham Act read as follows:

The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of
equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable, to an injunction
against another person’s _commercial use in commerce_ of a mark or trade name,
if such use begins after the mark has become famous and _causes dilution of
the distinctive quality of the mark_ , and to obtain such other relief as is
provided in this subsection. [emphasis added]

The 1996 version of s 43(c) of the Lanham Act also set out certain criteria
for determining whether a trade mark was distinctive or famous. (The 1996
version of s 43(c) of the Lanham Act was subsequently amended in 2006 (see
[186] below).)

184  Important for present purposes is the amendment of s 45 of the Lanham Act
(15 USC (US) § 1127), via s 4 of the FTDA, to include a definition of
“dilution”, as follows:

The term ‘dilution’ means the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to
identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or
absence of —

(1) competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties, or

(2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception.

(We shall hereafter refer to the amended s 45 as “the 1996 version of s 45 of
the Lanham Act”.) The above is, of course, the definition of “dilution” that
has been incorporated into the current TMA (see s 2(1) thereof).

185 It should be noted that the 1995 House Report ([182] _supra_) specifically
stated in relation to the new definition of “dilution” that (at 8):

The definition is designed to encompass all forms of dilution recognized by
the courts, including dilution by blurring, by tarnishment and disparagement,
and by diminishment.

Despite its noble aims, the FTDA engendered even more disputes than it solved.
These disputes need not detain us, except for one, _viz_ , that arising from
the important US Supreme Court decision of _Victor_ _Moseley v V Secret
Catalogue, Inc_ 537 US 418 (2003) (“the _Victoria’s Secret_ case”). The
plaintiff in that case, which owned the famous “Victoria’s Secret” trade mark
and operated a chain of lingerie stores under that name, alleged that the
defendants’ use of the name “Victor’s Little Secret” for the defendants’ sex
shop was likely to both “blur and erode the distinctiveness” (at 424) as well
as “tarnish the reputation” (_ibid_) of the plaintiff’s name. This case is
tremendously important for all sorts of reasons, but the only point of concern
for us for present purposes is the following passage (see the _Victoria’s
Secret_ case at 432):

[The defendants] have not disputed the relevance of tarnishment … presumably
because that concept was prominent in litigation brought under state
antidilution statutes and because it was mentioned in the legislative history.
Whether it is actually embraced by the statutory text, however, is another
matter. Indeed, the contrast between the state statutes, which expressly refer
to both “injury to business reputation” and to “dilution of the distinctive
quality of a trade name or trademark,” and the federal statute [_ie_ , the
FTDA] which refers only to the latter, arguably supports a narrower reading of
the FTDA.

Essentially, the US Supreme Court confined dilution under the FTDA to dilution
by blurring _only_ , and declined to interpret the Act as encompassing
dilution by tarnishment as well.

186 The legislative reaction to the decision in the _Victoria’s Secret_ case
came in the form of the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006, Pub L No
109-312, 120 Stat 1730 (“the TDRA”), which was enacted on 6 October 2006 in
order to further amend the Lanham Act. The TDRA cleared up many of the issues
raised by the _Victoria’s Secret_ case. In particular, the issue of whether
the FTDA had made dilution by tarnishment actionable was resolved. Section
3(e) of the TDRA removed the definition of “dilution” set out in the 1996
version of s 45 of the Lanham Act. At the same time, s 2 of the TDRA amended
the 1996 version of s 43(c) of the Lanham Act so as to make it clear that
injunctive relief was available in cases of “dilution by blurring _or_
dilution by tarnishment” [emphasis added] (see the new s 43(c)(1) of the
Lanham Act, as enacted by s 2 of the TDRA). Further, the term “dilution by
tarnishment” was defined in the new s 43(c)(2)(C) of the Lanham Act (as
enacted by s 2 of the TDRA) as “association arising from the similarity
between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harm[ed] the reputation of
the famous mark”.

187  The importance of the preceding discussion on the US law of dilution lies
in the fact that Singapore has imported elements of this area of US law both
indirectly through the adoption of (_inter alia_) Art 4(1)(b) of the Joint
Recommendation (which has been translated into s 55(3) of the current TMA) and
directly through the incorporation in s 2(1) of the current TMA of the
definition of “dilution” set out in the 1996 version of s 45 of the Lanham
Act. However, our importation of the US law of dilution took place in 2004,
before the TDRA was enacted and under the shadow of the US Supreme Court’s
view in the _Victoria’s Secret_ case that dilution under the FTDA included
dilution by blurring only and not dilution by tarnishment. As the amendments
effected by the TDRA show, Congress had in fact intended for dilution to
include both forms, just as the 1995 House Report ([182] _supra_) had stated.
We shall return to this point in due course.

(3) The EU Directive

188 European trade mark law is marked by two major developments – the adoption
of the EU Directive and the introduction of the Community Trade Mark (“CTM”)
regime. The CTM regime was conceived as a parallel, supranational system of
trade mark registration that would exist alongside national trade mark
systems, which were to be preserved. However, it was recognised that there was
also a need for some degree of compatibility and uniformity among the various
trade mark regimes of EU member states. Harmonisation efforts were focused on
substantive issues such as the rights of a trade mark holder and the
conditions for obtaining and holding a trade mark. To this end, the EU
Directive was adopted on 21 December 1988.

189 The EU Directive protects a trade mark with a reputation in an EU member
state (_ie_ , the plaintiff’s trade mark) against the use of a mark or sign
(_ie_ , the defendant’s trade mark) on dissimilar goods or services where “use
of [the defendant’s trade mark] without due cause takes unfair advantage of,
or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the
[plaintiff’s] trade mark” (see Art 5(2) of the EU Directive). The scope of
protection extends to the refusal of registration or the invalidation of the
defendant’s trade mark (see Art 4(4)(a) of the EU Directive), and to the grant
of an injunction against the use of the defendant’s trade mark (see Art 5(2)
of the EU Directive). The EU Directive also gives the plaintiff’s well-known
trade mark protection similar to that provided by Art 6 _bis_ of the Paris
Convention in that, under Art 4(1)(b) of the EU Directive, the defendant’s
trade mark is not to be registered or, if registered, is liable to be declared
invalid if:

… because of its identity with, or similarity to, the [plaintiff’s] trade mark
and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the
[plaintiff’s and the defendant’s respective] trade marks, there exists a
likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the
likelihood of association with the [plaintiff’s] trade mark.

Except where the defendant’s trade mark is identical to the plaintiff’s trade
mark and also covers goods or services identical to the plaintiff’s goods or
services (see Art 4(1)(a) of the EU Directive), “a likelihood of confusion on
the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of association with the
[plaintiff’s] trade mark” (see Art 4(1)(b) of the EU Directive) must be shown.
In the UK, Art 4(4)(a) and Art 5(2) of the EU Directive have been translated
into s 5(3) and s 10(3) respectively of the English Trade Marks Act.

190 The unusual structure and syntax of the EU Directive raises a number of
interesting issues. Of concern to us in the present appeal is the meaning of
the phrase “without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to,
the distinctive character or the repute of the [plaintiff’s] trade mark” in
Art 5(2) (a similar phrase, albeit worded in a slightly different manner, also
appears in Art 4(4)(a)). The phrase “without due cause” in s 10(3) of the
English Trade Marks Act (_ie_ , the English equivalent of Art 5(2) of the EU
Directive) was interpreted by the English High Court in _Premier Brands UK Ltd
v Typhoon Europe Ltd_ [2000] FSR 767 (“ _Premier Brands_ ”). There, Neuberger
J rejected the defendant’s submission that the phrase meant “[not] in good
faith” (at 789) or “[not] for good and honest commercial reasons” (at 789–790)
because such a conclusion could have unfair and capricious results, depending
on the subjective intention or even unconscious desires of the defendant.
Instead, he preferred an interpretation which required the defendant to show
that its use of its trade mark was “with due cause” (at 791). Neuberger J also
adopted the Benelux Court of Justice’s interpretation in _Lucas Bols v
Colgate-Palmolive_ (1976) 7 IIC 420 (“ _Lucas Bols_ ”) of the phrase “without
justifiable reason”, which appears in the Benelux equivalent of s 10(3) of the
English Trade Marks Act. In _Lucas Bols_ , it was held that there would be
“justifiable reason” for the defendant to use its trade mark if (see _Premier
Brands_ at 791):

… the [defendant] is under such a compulsion to use this very mark that [it]
cannot honestly be asked to refrain from doing so regardless of the damage the
owner of the mark would suffer from such use, or … the [defendant] is entitled
to the use of the mark in [its] own right and does not have to yield this
right to that of the owner of the mark …

191 Notably for present purposes, Neuberger J observed in _Premier Brands_
that the phrase “without due cause” might seem superfluous in the context of
the stipulation in s 10(3) of the English Trade Marks Act that the use of the
defendant’s trade mark must also “[take] unfair advantage” of the plaintiff’s
reputable trade mark. He concluded, however (at 791–792 of _Premier Brands_):

[I]t is fair to say that it is not easy to see how the use of a sign could
take “ _unfair_ advantage” of a registered mark and yet be _not_ “without due
cause”. In my judgment, however, there are two answers to that point. First,
it is conceivable that, in certain circumstances, the court might conclude
that, notwithstanding the fact that the alleged infringer’s use of a sign took
“unfair advantage” of a mark, this was outweighed by the use being with “due
cause”, within the limited meaning of that expression as explained in _Lucas
Bols_ [1976] 7 I.I.C. 420. Secondly, the words “being without due cause” apply
not only to a case of alleged unfair advantage, but also to a case where the
use of the sign is allegedly “detrimental” to the mark: there is no difficulty
in envisaging circumstances where a “detrimental” use could not be “without
due cause” within the sense I have suggested. [emphasis in original]

192 The trickier limb of Art 5(2) of the EU Directive consists of the phrase
“takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or
the repute of the [plaintiff’s] trade mark”. In _Adidas-Salomon, Adidas
Benelux v Fitnessworld Trading Ltd_ [2003] ETMR 91 (“ _Adidas-Salomon (AG)_
”), Advocate General Jacobs (“Jacobs AG”) noted in his opinion (at [36]):

Article 5(2) protects the proprietor of a mark with a reputation against use
of an identical or [a] similar sign where use of that sign without due cause
takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or
the repute of the trade mark. There are thus in principle four types of use
which may be caught: use which takes unfair advantage of the mark’s
distinctive character, use which takes unfair advantage of [the mark’s]
repute, use which is detrimental to the mark’s distinctive character and use
which is detrimental to [the mark’s] repute.

193 Jacobs AG opined that the concept of detriment to the distinctive
character of a trade mark reflected dilution in the form of blurring (_id_ at
[37]), while the concept of detriment to the repute of a trade mark
corresponded to dilution in the form of tarnishment (_id_ at [38]). In
contrast, the concept of taking unfair advantage of the distinctive character
of a trade mark and that of taking unfair advantage of the repute of a trade
mark encompassed “instances where there [was] clear exploitation and free-
riding on the coat-tails of a famous mark or an attempt to trade upon its
reputation” (_id_ at [39]). Jacobs AG also made a specific reference (_ibid_)
to the explanation given in the Explanatory Notes of Art 4(1)(b)(iii) of the
Joint Recommendation, which we shall refer to later (see [210] below).

194  On reference of the case to the European Court of Justice (“the ECJ”),
the court held, in _Adidas-Salomon AG, Adidas Benelux BV v Fitnessworld
Trading Ltd_ [2004] ETMR 10 (“ _Adidas-Salomon (ECJ)_ ”), that proof that the
public was likely to confuse the plaintiff’s well-known trade mark with the
defendant’s trade mark was _not_ necessary for actions under Art 5(2) of the
EU Directive. The ECJ characterised the scope of that provision as follows (at
[29]):

The infringements referred to in Art. 5(2) of the [EU] Directive, where they
occur, are the consequence of a certain degree of similarity between the
[plaintiff’s] mark and the [defendant’s] sign, by virtue of which the relevant
section of the public makes a connection between the [defendant’s] sign and
the [plaintiff’s] mark, that is to say, establishes a link between them even
though it does not confuse them …

195 The fact that there is no requirement of a likelihood of the public
confusing the plaintiff’s trade mark with the defendant’s trade mark _vis-à-
vis_ Art 5(2) of the EU Directive is balanced against the relatively strict
standards which apply to the other components of this provision. The concept
of a link between the plaintiff’s trade mark and the defendant’s trade mark as
enunciated in _Adidas-Salomon (ECJ)_ at [29] (“the ‘link’ requirement in
_Adidas-Salomon (ECJ)_ ”) was recently interpreted by Jacob LJ in the English
Court of Appeal case of _Intel Corp Inc v CPM United Kingdom Ltd_ [2007] ETMR
59 (“the English _Intel Corp_ case”) in relation to Art 4(4)(a) of the EU
Directive, which contains a phrase similar to that in Art 5(2) (namely,
“without due cause would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the
distinctive character or the repute of the [plaintiff’s] trade mark”). Jacob
LJ commented at [30] that “a mere calling to mind” of the plaintiff’s
reputable trade mark was insufficient to establish the requisite connection.
Instead, such connection was established only in the following situations
(_ibid_):

[T]he facts … go beyond a mere calling to mind. They may cause the consumer to
think [that] there is a trade connection between the owner of the [reputable]
mark [_ie_ , the plaintiff] and the user of the later [allegedly conflicting]
mark [_ie_ , the defendant] or at least wonder whether there is such a
connection. Clearly the former case ought to be protected, and perhaps the
latter too if the wonder is substantial as opposed to fleeting.

Jacob LJ also posited that speculation by the public about “some sort of
licensing arrangement” (see the English _Intel Corp_ case at [31]) between the
plaintiff and the defendant might suffice for the purposes of establishing the
requisite trade connection.

196 The sort of strictness advocated by Jacob LJ has not been seen in other
jurisdictions. For instance, the Benelux courts have been quite happy to
accept “mere association” (see Seiko Hidaka _et al_ , “A Sign of the Times? A
Review of Key Trade Mark Decisions of the European Court of Justice and Their
Impact Upon National Trade Mark Jurisprudence in the EU” (2004) 94 Trademark
Rep 1105 at 1142) as sufficient. Even more pertinent in this regard is the
decision of the ECJ on the question which the English Court of Appeal in the
English _Intel Corp_ case referred to it, _viz_ , the question of what would
suffice to satisfy the “link” requirement in _Adidas-Salomon (ECJ)_. In _Intel
Corporation Inc v CPM United Kingdom Ltd_ Case C-252/07, 27 November 2008
(unreported) (“the European _Intel Corp_ case”), the ECJ held (_contra_ Jacob
LJ’s view in the English _Intel Corp_ case) that this “link” requirement would
be satisfied by the mere calling to mind of the plaintiff’s trade mark on the
part of “the average consumer, who [was] reasonably well informed and
reasonably observant and circumspect” (see the European _Intel Corp_ case at
[60] and [63]). It should be noted, however, that the ECJ’s more lenient
approach to the “link” requirement in _Adidas-Salomon (ECJ)_ was
counterbalanced by the ECJ’s holding that the plaintiff, apart from showing
that that requirement had been satisfied, also had to prove “actual and
present injury to its mark … or a serious likelihood that such an injury
[would] occur in the future” (see the European _Intel Corp_ case at [71]).
With regard to damage in the form of, specifically, “[detriment] to … the
distinctive character … of the [plaintiff’s] trade mark” (_per_ Art 4(4)(a) of
the EU Directive), the ECJ stated that such detriment had to be proved by
“evidence of a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer of the
[plaintiff’s] goods or services … or a serious likelihood that such a change
[would] occur in the future” (see the European _Intel Corp_ case at [77]).

197 Jacob LJ also interpreted the term “unfair” (in the context of the term
“unfair advantage” in Art 5(2) of the EU Directive) in _L’Oreal SA v Bellure
NV_ [2008] ETMR 1 (“the English _L’Oreal_ case”). He opined (_id_ at [91])
that evidence of “free-riding” by the defendant _per se_ – _viz_ , of the
defendant capitalising on the distinctive character or repute of the
plaintiff’s trade mark to market and promote its (_ie_ , the defendant’s) own
goods or services (_id_ at [88]) – was not sufficient to prove that unfair
advantage had been taken of the plaintiff’s well-known trade mark. Instead,
there had to be evidence of “harm, present or prospective, caused to the
[plaintiff’s trade] mark … [or] its distinctive character or to the
[plaintiff] or [its] business, present or reasonably prospective” (_id_ at
[94]). Blackburne J, on the other hand, appeared to take the view that “free-
riding” could in certain cases constitute an “unfair advantage” for the
purposes of Art 5(2) of the EU Directive even if there was no “harm, present
or prospective” (see the English _L’Oreal_ case at [94]) as mentioned by Jacob
LJ. Blackburne J commented (_id_ at [166]):

[W]here [the defendant] is able to derive a commercial advantage through the
“wink” which [its] product makes at the [plaintiff’s] registered mark but no
harm, present or prospective, can be shown to that mark … [or] its distinctive
character, or to the [plaintiff] or [its] business … such conduct, assuming
that it gives to the [defendant] a commercial advantage, should be treated as
“unfair”.

The English _L’Oreal_ case was likewise referred by the English Court of
Appeal to the ECJ for a ruling on the meaning of “unfair advantage” in Art
5(2) of the EU Directive. In Advocate General Mengozzi’s non-binding opinion
on this matter (see _L’Oréal SA, Lancôme parfums et beauté & Cie and
Laboratoire Garnier & Cie v Bellure NV, Malaika Investments Ltd and Starion
International Ltd_ Case C-487/07, 10 February 2009 (unreported)), it was
stated that whether or not the advantage taken of the plaintiff’s well-known
trade mark was “unfair” was “for the national court to verify … taking … all
the relevant circumstances of the case into account” (at [110]). The ECJ’s
decision is expected later this year.

(4) The Joint Recommendation

198 The Joint Recommendation was the result of further developments following
the TRIPS Agreement. Work was initially done by WIPO’s Committee of Experts on
Well-known Marks (“the Committee of Experts”), and later continued by the
Standing Committee on the Law of Trademarks, Industrial Designs and
Geographical Indications (“the SCT”). Various draft proposals were presented
over the course of six meetings of the Committee of Experts and the SCT. The
proposals by the SCT were eventually adopted at a joint session of the
Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the
General Assembly of WIPO held at the 34th WIPO Meeting (see [137] above). The
Joint Recommendation does not have any binding force and its provisions are
merely guidelines for WIPO member states to consider.

199 Article 2 of the Joint Recommendation delineates the type of trade marks
which are deemed to be sufficiently well known to enjoy the protection set out
in the Joint Recommendation. We have considered this provision earlier in our
discussion (at [134]–[153] above) of what constitutes a well-known trade mark
in the context of the current TMA.

200 Article 3(1) of the Joint Recommendation requires each WIPO member state
to “protect a well-known mark against conflicting marks, business identifiers
and domain names, at least with effect from the time when the mark has become
well known in the [m]ember [s]tate”. In this regard, the defendant’s trade
mark is deemed to be a “conflicting” mark in the various scenarios set out in
Art 4(1) of the Joint Recommendation. Under Art 4(1)(a), the defendant’s trade
mark :

… shall be deemed to be in conflict with a well-known mark [_ie_ , the
plaintiff’s mark] where [the defendant’s] mark, or an essential part thereof,
constitutes a reproduction, an imitation, a translation, or a transliteration,
liable to create confusion, of the well-known mark … if the [defendant’s]
mark, or an essential part thereof, is used, is the subject of an application
for registration, or is registered … in respect of goods and/or services which
are identical or similar to the goods and/or services to which the well-known
mark applies.

201 The more difficult provision as to when the defendant’s trade mark
constitutes a “conflicting” mark is Art 4(1)(b) of the Joint Recommendation.
This provision applies _regardless of_ the nature of the goods or services on
which the defendant’s trade mark is used; _ie_ , it is _immaterial_ whether or
not those goods or services are identical or similar to the plaintiff’s goods
or services. Article 4(1)(b) sets out three different situations in which the
defendant’s trade mark is deemed to be in conflict with the plaintiff’s trade
mark. The first, which is to be found in Art 4(1)(b)(i), is based on Art 16(3)
of the TRIPS Agreement. It states that the defendant’s trade mark will be
deemed to be a “conflicting” mark where the use of that mark would indicate a
“connection” (see Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint Recommendation) between the
defendant’s goods or services and the plaintiff, and would also be “likely to
damage” (_ibid_) the plaintiff’s interest.

202 The second situation in which the defendant’s trade mark is deemed to be a
“conflicting” mark under Art 4(1)(b) of the Joint Recommendation is that
delineated in Art 4(1)(b)(ii), which appears to be drawn from both the
American law of dilution as well as Art 4(4)(a) and Art 5(2) of the EU
Directive. Article 4(1)(b)(ii) of the Joint Recommendation states that the
defendant’s trade mark will be deemed to be in conflict with the plaintiff’s
trade mark if the use of the defendant’s mark “is likely to impair or dilute
in an unfair manner the distinctive character of the [plaintiff’s] well-known
mark” (_cf_ the phrase “detrimental to … the distinctive character … of the
[plaintiff’s] trade mark” in Art 4(4)(a) and Art 5(2) of the EU Directive).

203 Finally, Art 4(1)(b)(iii) of the Joint Recommendation covers the situation
where “the use of [the defendant’s] mark would take unfair advantage of the
distinctive character of the [plaintiff’s] well-known mark”. The use of the
phrase “distinctive character” in both this provision and Art 4(1)(b)(ii) of
the Joint Recommendation seems to have been inspired by the wording used in
Art 4(4)(a) and Art 5(2) of the EU Directive. The correlation is particularly
strong in the case of Art 4(1)(b)(iii) of the Joint Recommendation because
this provision also imports the concept of “unfair advantage” from Art 4(4)(a)
and Art 5(2) of the EU Directive.

204 Article 4(1)(c) of the Joint Recommendation is important as well. It
states that a WIPO member state may require the plaintiff’s well-known trade
mark to be “well known by the public at large” before Art 4(1)(b)(ii) and Art
4(1)(b)(iii) are applicable.

205 The first thing to note is that Art 4(1)(b) of the Joint Recommendation
does not mention that there must be a likelihood of confusion before the
defendant’s trade mark will be deemed to be in conflict with the plaintiff’s
trade mark, unlike Art 4(1)(a), which expressly incorporates the confusion
requirement (see the words “liable to create confusion” in Art 4(1)(a)). It
may thus be thought that the confusion requirement is absent from Art 4(1)(b)
generally and Art 4(1)(b)(i) in particular. We disagree, however, with this
interpretation for four reasons.

206 First, as we have seen (at [201] above), Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint
Recommendation is derived directly from Art 16(3) of the TRIPS Agreement. It
has been shown earlier (at [170]–[177] above) that Art 16(3) of the TRIPS
Agreement did not dispense with the confusion requirement contained in its
originating provision, Art 6 _bis_ of the Paris Convention.

207 Second, the commentary in the Explanatory Notes on Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the
Joint Recommendation indicates that the drafters of the Joint Recommendation
considered the likelihood of confusion to be a requirement. The Explanatory
Notes state (at para 4.3):

Under [Art 4(1)(b)(i)], a connection between a well-known mark and a third
party’s goods or services may be indicated, for example, if _the impression is
created that the owner of the well-known mark is involved in the production of
those goods, or the offering of those services, or that such production or
offering was licensed or sponsored by him_. The interests of the owner of the
well-known mark could be damaged if the goods and/or services with which the
connection is established have a down-market image, thereby reflecting
negatively on the goodwill of the well-known mark. [emphasis added]

208 Burton Ong, in “Protecting Well-known Trade Marks: Perspectives from
Singapore” (2005) 95 TMR 1221 (“Ong’s article”), disagrees with this view.
Instead, he suggests (at 1248) that Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint Recommendation
is meant to “extend protection for well-known trade marks to _all_ situations
where damage to the [plaintiff] arises from **_any_** connection made by the
public between the [plaintiff] and the goods or services of the unauthorised
user of the mark” [emphasis added in bold italics]. He further suggests that
the two sentences in para 4.3 of the Explanatory Notes actually delineate two
different instances in which the plaintiff’s well-known trade mark is
protected, namely (see Ong’s article at 1249):

The first sentence makes it clear that the [plaintiff’s] well-known mark is
protected from origin-related confusion … However, this is merely one example
of the type of misconduct that [Art 4(1)(b)(i)] is seeking to address. The
second sentence expands the scope of [Art 4(1)(b)(i)] to include situations
where the unauthorised application of the [plaintiff’s] mark on down-market
goods might have an adverse impact on the attractive force of the well-known
mark itself, indeed suggesting that instances of tarnishment [which, as stated
at [180] above, does not require proof of confusion] fall within this category
of misconduct as well.

With respect, this is, in our view, an incorrect reading of Art 4(1)(b)(i) of
the Joint Recommendation. One recalls that Art 4(1)(b)(i), besides requiring a
“connection” between the plaintiff and the defendant’s goods or services (in
essence, confusion) to be shown, also requires the connection to be “likely to
damage [the plaintiff’s] interests”. The second sentence of para 4.3 of the
Explanatory Notes merely makes the point that confusion _could result in_
tarnishment as a form of damage; that sentence does not suggest that confusion
and tarnishment delineate two different scenarios in which the defendant’s
trade mark is deemed to be a “conflicting” mark for the purposes of Art
4(1)(b)(i).

209 Third, it is crucial to note that the “connection” required in Art
4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint Recommendation is that between the defendant’s good or
services and _the plaintiff itself_. This is distinguishable from the
connection or link required under Art 5(2) of the EU Directive, which was
interpreted in _Adidas-Salomon (ECJ)_ ([194] _supra_) at [29] as “a connection
between _the [defendant’s] sign_ and _the [plaintiff’s] mark_ ” [emphasis
added] – _ie_ , the connection required under Art 5(2) of the EU Directive is
that _between two trade marks_ (_viz_ , the plaintiff’s trade mark and the
defendant’s trade mark), although such connection need not amount to
confusion. In respect of the connection between the defendant’s goods or
services and the plaintiff (_ie_ , the connection required under Art
4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint Recommendation), Handler’s article ([175] _supra_)
notes (at 314):

_This condition cannot be satisfied simply by looking to whether consumers
might make a conceptual link between the two marks. A quite different type of
assessment is needed._ To use an example from US dilution law, consumers who
see “The Greatest Snow on Earth” on licence plates in the context of an
organisation’s promotion of winter sports tourism might well call to mind
Ringling Bros circus’ well-known mark THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, and thus
form a mental association or connection between the two marks. However, this
does not address the question … [of] whether such consumers would make a
connection between the tourism promotion services and Ringling Bros. Whether
this sort of connection exists will depend on factors going beyond the
similarity of the two marks and the degree of fame of the registered mark.
[emphasis added]

210 Finally, our view that the likelihood of confusion is an essential element
of Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint Recommendation is supported by an examination
of this particular provision in the wider context of all three situations in
which the defendant’s trade mark is deemed to be a “conflicting” mark under
Art 4(1)(b). It appears from the reference in Art 4(1)(b)(ii) to “the
distinctive character of the well-known mark” that this provision is grafted
from Art 4(4)(a) and Art 5(2) of the EU Directive, which (as we have seen at
[194] above) do not require a likelihood of confusion between the plaintiff’s
trade mark and the defendant’s trade mark to be shown. More importantly, as
noted earlier (at [193] above), Jacobs AG regarded the words “detrimental to …
the distinctive character … of the trade mark” in Art 5(2) of the EU Directive
(and, presumably, the corresponding words in Art 4(4)(a) thereof as well) as
encompassing the concept of dilution by blurring (see _Adidas-Salomon (AG)_
([192] _supra_) at [37]). This indicates that Art 4(1)(b)(ii) of the Joint
Recommendation is an explicit anti-dilution provision, and anti-dilution
legislation, as we have seen from our earlier analysis of US law, does not
require confusion to be proved before the trade mark in question can be
protected (see [179] above). It appears from the wording of Art 4(1)(b)(ii) of
the Joint Recommendation, read together with Art 4(1)(b)(iii), that the
“[detriment] to … the distinctive character … of the trade mark” limbs of Art
4(4)(a) and Art 5(2) of the EU Directive (which, as just mentioned, were
regarded by Jacobs AG in _Adidas-Salomon (AG)_ as providing protection against
dilution by blurring) were removed and transplanted specifically onto Art
4(1)(b)(ii) of the Joint Recommendation. What essentially remains in Art
4(1)(b)(iii) is “free-riding”. The commentary on Art 4(1)(b)(iii) in the
Explanatory Notes (at para 4.5) confirms that proof of confusion is _not_
required for the purposes of this provision:

The case referred to in [Art 4(1)(b)(iii) differs from the cases covered by
[Art 4(1)(b)(i)] and [Art 4(1)(b)(ii)] in that _no wrong connection concerning
the real source of the goods and/or services is indicated_ (as in [Art
4(1)(b)(i)]), and the value of the well-known mark has not diminished in the
eyes of the public (as in [Art 4(1)(b)(ii)]), but rather the use in question
would, for example, amount to a free ride on the goodwill of the well-known
mark for the person who uses a conflicting mark. [emphasis added]

211 In short, both Art 4(1)(b)(ii) and Art 4(1)(b)(iii) of the Joint
Recommendation do not require proof of confusion before the defendant’s trade
mark is deemed to be in conflict with the plaintiff’s trade mark. If Art
4(1)(b)(i) similarly does not require confusion to be shown in this regard, it
is very likely to swallow up Art 4(1)(b)(ii) and Art 4(1)(b)(iii). Article
4(1)(b)(i), if interpreted in this manner, would essentially incorporate the
“link” requirement in _Adidas-Salomon (ECJ)_ , which applies to _both_
dilution by blurring and “free-riding”. However, the presence of Art
4(1)(b)(ii) and Art 4(1)(b)(iii) in Art 4(1) of the Joint Recommendation
suggests that Art 4(1)(b)(i) must serve an entirely different purpose from
that of providing protection against dilution by blurring (which is covered by
Art 4(1)(b)(ii)) and protection against “free-riding” (which is covered by Art
4(1)(b)(iii)). This interpretation is reinforced by Art 4(1)(c) of the Joint
Recommendation, which demonstrates the recognition that Art 4(1)(b)(ii) and
Art 4(1)(b)(iii) confer a _higher_ level of protection than that provided by
Art 4(1)(b)(i) and may thus apply only to commensurately more well-known trade
marks.

212 We conclude from the foregoing that Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint
Recommendation requires the likelihood of confusion to be shown before the
defendant’s trade mark will be deemed to be in conflict with the plaintiff’s
trade mark, unlike Art 4(1)(b)(ii) and Art 4(1)(b)(iii).

(5) The current TMA

213 As mentioned earlier (at [162] above), our law on well-known trade marks
has undergone two distinct stages of development. Protection for well-known
trade marks was first introduced into our law with the advent of the 1998 TMA.
Under the 1998 TMA, all registered trade marks were protected from the
registration and the use of _identical_ trade marks which covered _identical_
goods or services (see, respectively, s 8(1) and s 27(1) of the 1998 TMA). The
protection afforded by s 8(1) and s 27(1) of the 1998 TMA was _not_ dependent
on proof of confusion, in accordance with Art 16(1) of the TRIPS Agreement
(under Art 16(1) of the TRIPS Agreement, “[i]n [the] case of the use of an
identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion
shall be _presumed_ ” [emphasis added]). In contrast, “a likelihood of
confusion on the part of the public” (_per_ s 8(2) and s 27(2) of the 1998
TMA) had to be shown where the defendant’s trade mark:

(a) was identical to the plaintiff’s trade mark and covered goods or services
which were similar to the plaintiff’s goods or services (see s 8(2)(_a_) and s
27(2)(_a_) of the 1998 TMA); or

(b) was similar to the plaintiff’s trade mark and covered goods or services
which were identical or similar to the plaintiff’s goods or services (see s
8(2)(_b_) and s 27(2)(_b_) of the 1998 TMA).

For trade marks which were well known in Singapore, additional protection was
granted under s 8(3) and s 27(3) of the 1998 TMA even where the defendant’s
goods or services were _dissimilar_ , provided that the following conditions
were fulfilled:

(a) the use of the defendant’s trade mark in relation to the defendant’s goods
or services would indicate a connection between those goods  
or services and the plaintiff (see s 8(3)(ii) and s 27(3)(_b_) of the 1998
TMA);

(b) there was _a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public_ because of
such use (see s 8(3)(iii) and s 27(3)(_c_) of the 1998 TMA); and

(c) the plaintiff’s interests in its well-known trade mark were likely to be
damaged by such use (see s 8(3)(iv) and s 27(3)(_d_) of the 1998 TMA).

214 In addition, under s 55(2) read with s 55(1) of the 1998 TMA, where the
plaintiff owned a trade mark which was entitled to protection under either the
Paris Convention or the TRIPS Agreement as a well-known trade mark, the
plaintiff could obtain an injunction to restrain the defendant from using an
identical or a similar trade mark on identical or similar goods or services if
such use was “likely to cause confusion” (see s 55(2)), regardless of whether
or not the plaintiff carried on business or had any goodwill in Singapore.

215 The 2004 TMA amendments were brought about by the FTA, which obliged both
the US and Singapore to implement the Joint Recommendation (see [163] above).
Section 8(3) of the 1998 TMA _vis-à-vis_ protection from the registration of
identical or similar trade marks for goods or services dissimilar to those of
the plaintiff was altered, and now, under s 8(4) of the current TMA, where the
defendant applies on or after 1 July 2004 (_viz_ , the date on which the 2004
TMA amendments came into effect) to register a trade mark which is identical
or similar to the plaintiff’s well-known trade mark, the defendant’s trade
mark – regardless of whether the goods or services which it covers are similar
or dissimilar to the plaintiff’s goods or services – will be refused
registration only if:

(a) use of the defendant’s trade mark would indicate a connection between the
goods or services covered by that trade mark and the plaintiff, and is likely
to damage the interests of the plaintiff (see s 8(4)(_b_)(i) of the current
TMA); or

(b) the plaintiff’s trade mark is well known to the public at large in
Singapore (and not merely “well known in Singapore” (_per_ s 8(4)(_a_)), and
use of the defendant’s trade mark would either “cause dilution in an unfair
manner of the distinctive character of the [plaintiff’s] trade mark” (see s
8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A) of the current TMA) or “take unfair advantage of the
distinctive character of the [plaintiff’s] trade mark” (see s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(B)
of the current TMA).

For ease of discussion, we shall hereafter refer to the conditions set out in
s 8(4)(_b_)(i), s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A) and s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(B) as, respectively,
“the ‘damaging connection’ condition”, “the ‘unfair dilution’ condition” and
“the ‘unfair advantage’ condition”.

216 With regard to the international protection of well-known trade marks, the
2004 TMA amendments did not make any changes to the substance of the
protection provided by s 55(2) of the 1998 TMA (see s 55(2) of the current
TMA). However, a new subsection, _viz_ , s 55(3) of the current TMA, was
added. Section 55(3) of the current TMA allows the owner of a well-known trade
mark (_ie_ , the plaintiff) to obtain an injunction restraining the defendant
from using an identical or a similar trade mark on (_inter alia_) _dissimilar_
goods or services if the same conditions as those which we have just outlined
_vis-à-vis_ s 8(4) of the current TMA (see [215] above) – _ie_ , the “damaging
connection” condition (see s 55(3)(_a_), which corresponds to s 8(4)(_b_)(i)),
the “unfair dilution” condition (see s 55(3)(_b_)(i), which corresponds to s
8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A)) and the “unfair advantage” condition (see s 55(3)(_b_)(ii),
which corresponds to s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(B)) – are satisfied. These amendments
were intended, of course, to bring our trade mark legislation in line with Art
4(1)(b) of the Joint Recommendation.

217 In addition to the above amendments, a definition of “dilution” was added.
Section 2(1) of the current TMA now states that:

“dilution”, in relation to a trade mark, means the lessening of the capacity
of the trade mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of
whether there is —

(_a_) any competition between the proprietor of the trade mark and any other
party; or

(_b_) any likelihood of confusion on the part of the public …

This definition, as noted earlier (see [184] above), is identical to that
which used to be contained in the 1996 version of s 45 of the Lanham Act.

218 The similarity between the provisions in the current TMA and those in the
Joint Recommendation means, naturally, that the arguments as to why the
confusion requirement is part and parcel of Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint
Recommendation (see [205]–[211] above) also support the same conclusion in
relation to the “damaging connection” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(i) and s
55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA – _ie_ , confusion must likewise be proved
before these two provisions can be invoked. We shall now go on to address
other arguments peculiar to the current TMA.

219 In Ong’s article ([208] _supra_), it is argued that the confusion
requirement is absent from s 8(4) and s 55(3) of the current TMA (which
protect the plaintiff’s trade mark from, respectively, the registration and
the use of an identical or a similar trade mark for (_inter alia_) dissimilar
goods or services). The author further suggests that the ambit of the
protection provided by s 8(4) and s 55(3) can be delineated in the following
manner:

(a) the “damaging connection” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(i) and s 55(3)(_a_) is
directed at protection against tarnishment, including tarnishment caused by
confusion and dilution by tarnishment (see Ong’s article at 1242–1244 and
1247–1249);

(b) the “unfair dilution” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A) and s 55(3)(_b_)(i)
is directed at protection against dilution by blurring only (_id_ at 1244–1245
and 1251–1252); and

(c) the scope of the protection provided by the “unfair advantage” condition
in s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(B) and s 55(3)(_b_)(ii) is to be derived from UK cases on s
5(3) and s 10(3) of the English Trade Marks Act (_id_ at 1255–1256).

220 Ong argues that the protection covered by the “damaging connection”
condition includes dilution by tarnishment because the “connection” referred
to in s 8(4)(_b_)(i) and s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA does not incorporate
the likelihood of confusion. We have dealt with this argument earlier (at
[205]–[211] above) in the context of Art 4(1)(b)(i) of the Joint
Recommendation, and the views which we expressed there likewise apply here.

221 With regard to the protection covered by the “unfair dilution” condition,
Ong argues that it is limited to protection from dilution by blurring for two
reasons. First, the definition of “dilution” in s 2(1) of the current TMA,
_ie_ , “the lessening of the capacity of the trade mark to identify and
distinguish goods or services”, refers only to dilution by blurring and not
dilution by tarnishment. From a literal reading of s 2(1), this is true. But,
as we have seen (at [185]–[186] above) from the history of protection against
dilution under the Lanham Act, Congress did not intend the term “dilution” to
be so narrowly understood. Ong’s view mirrors that of the US Supreme Court in
the _Victoria’s Secret_ case ([185] _supra_), in which the US Supreme Court
doubted that the FTDA had made dilution by tarnishment actionable. The TDRA
put paid to that view and clearly indicated the true intention of Congress –
_ie_ , that dilution under the FTDA covered _both_ dilution by blurring and
dilution by tarnishment. It is ironic that Singapore, in its enthusiastic
attempts to synchronise its trade mark law with American trade mark law
pursuant to its obligations under the FTA, obligingly adopted the 1996 version
of s 45 of the Lanham Act wholesale (by incorporating the definition of
“dilution” therein into s 2(1) of the current TMA) only to find out that the
US itself jettisoned that provision merely two short years later. We think
that s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) requires us to take a
purposive rather than literal interpretation of the definition of “dilution”
in s 2(1) of the current TMA until such time when Parliament may see fit to
effect the necessary amendments.

222 The second reason put forth by Ong as to why the “unfair dilution”
condition provides protection from dilution by blurring only and not
protection from dilution by tarnishment is that s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A) and s
55(3)(_b_)(i) of the current TMA mention only “dilution”, whereas their
counterpart, Art 4(1)(b)(ii) of the Joint Recommendation, speaks of both
dilution and impairment of the distinctive character of a well-known trade
mark. Ong argues that the word “impair” in Art 4(1)(b)(ii) must refer to
dilution by tarnishment and the omission of this word (_ie_ , “impair”) from
our definition of “dilution” in s 2(1) of the current TMA must have
significance. Again, this is literally true. However, this interpretation of
Art 4(1)(b)(ii) of the Joint Recommendation does not accord with the stated
intentions of the drafters of that provision. The Explanatory Notes (at para
4.4) comment on Art 4(1)(b)(ii) thus:

This item would apply, for example, if the use of a conflicting mark is likely
to impair or dilute in an unfair manner the unique position of a well-known
mark in the market. A further example of dilution is where the conflicting
mark is used on goods or services which are of an inferior quality or of an
immoral or obscene nature.

223 The first sentence of para 4.4 of the Explanatory Notes treats the terms
“dilute” and “impair” as synonymous; both are taken to indicate dilution by
blurring. The second sentence of that paragraph uses “dilution” to indicate
dilution by tarnishment. Apparently, in the drafters’ minds, there was no
material difference between dilution and impairment.

224 Perhaps, it was this lack of any substantial difference between the two
concepts (_viz_ , dilution and impairment) which led to the omission of the
words “impair” and “impairment” from our trade mark legislation. This view is
certainly supported by the Minister for Law’s statement during the second
reading of the Trade Marks (Amendment) Bill 2004, where he said (see
_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (15 June 2004) vol 78 at
col 111):

[T]here can be situations where the reputation and value of the well-known
mark is _diluted by blurring or tarnishment_ , even though there may not be
consumer confusion, for example, if someone uses a well-known mark on inferior
quality goods or on goods, say, of an obscene nature. [emphasis added]

225 Both the passage quoted at [222] above and that quoted at [224] above
weigh against the proposition that any significance should be placed on the
omission of the words “impair” and “impairment” from the current TMA.
“Dilution” in the context of the current TMA clearly refers to both dilution
by blurring and dilution by tarnishment.

226 From this perspective, it is difficult for Ong’s three-point
categorisation of the protection afforded under the current TMA (as set out at
[219] above) to stand. The “damaging connection” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(i)
and s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA will be satisfied only where there is a
confusing connection between the plaintiff and the defendant’s goods or
services (_ie_ , only where there is confusion) because non-confusing
connection is covered by the “unfair dilution” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A)
and s 55(3)(_b_)(i). The “unfair advantage” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(B)
and s 55(3)(_b_)(ii) sets out an entirely separate category of protection
against “free-riding” uses. This conclusion is supported by three other
considerations.

227 First, it is intuitively strange for dilution in its two forms (_viz_ ,
blurring and tarnishment) to be split between two different limbs of the
current TMA (namely, on the one hand, s 8(4)(_b_)(i) and s 55(3)(_a_) _vis-à-
vis_ dilution by tarnishment and, on the other hand, s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A) and s
55(3)(_b_)(i) _vis-à-vis_ dilution by blurring), each of which applies to
_different kinds of trade marks_. If Ong is right, in respect of a trade mark
which is merely a “well known trade mark” as defined in s 2(1) of the current
TMA, an action for dilution by tarnishment can be brought (in view of s
8(4)(_b_)(i) and s 55(3)(_a_)), but _not_ an action for dilution by blurring
because the latter is limited to a trade mark which is “well known to the
public at large in Singapore” (see s 8(4)(_b_)(ii) and s 55(3)(_b_)). This
very unconventional bifurcation of actions for dilution has no precedent
elsewhere.

228 Second, s 27(3) of the 1998 TMA, which described the circumstances in
which the use by the defendant of its trade mark (being a trade mark that was
identical or similar to the plaintiff’s well-known trade mark) on goods or
services dissimilar from those of the plaintiff would constitute infringement
of the plaintiff’s trade mark, was not amended in 2004. The conditions under
which infringement is made out, as stated in s 27(3) of the current TMA,
remain substantially the same as the conditions which previously applied under
s 27(3) of the 1998 TMA, _ie_ , there has to be a “connection” (see s
27(3)(_b_) of the current TMA) between the plaintiff and the defendant’s goods
or services arising from the use of the defendant’s trade mark, “ _a
likelihood of confusion_ ” (see s 27(3)(_c_) of the current TMA) on the part
of the public because of such use and damage to the plaintiff’s interests as a
result of such use (see s 27(3)(_d_) of the current TMA). It might be argued
that the express mention of the confusion requirement in s 27(3)(_c_) of the
current TMA makes the lack of such mention in s 8(4)(_b_)(i) and s 55(3)(_a_)
thereof all the more significant, but, for practical reasons, we think the
converse is true. Specifically, if the confusion requirement were not read
into s 8(4)(_b_)(i) and s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA, the following
situation would pertain: The plaintiff which relies on s 27(3) of the current
TMA to sue for infringement of its well-known trade mark must show a
likelihood of confusion on the part of the public due to the use of the
defendant’s trade mark on dissimilar goods or services, but, if the plaintiff
seeks to stop the registration of the defendant’s trade mark based on s
8(4)(_b_)(i) or to restrain (by way of injunction) the use of the defendant’s
trade mark under s 55(3)(_a_), it need not show a likelihood of confusion.
This situation is anomalous. There is no reason why the confusion requirement
should not apply across the board to all these sections.

229 Finally, it will be recalled that it is not too difficult for a trade mark
to be regarded as “well known in Singapore” – essentially, the trade mark in
question need only be recognised or known by “ _any_ relevant sector of the
public in Singapore” [emphasis added] (see s 2(7)(_a_) of the current TMA),
which sector could in certain cases be miniscule. In recognition of the fact
that many trade marks are potentially “well known in Singapore”, Parliament
has granted such trade marks only one advantage over ordinary trade marks,
namely, the former are protected from the registration and/or the use of
identical or similar trade marks on dissimilar goods or services – such
protection takes the form of the protection covered by the “damaging
connection” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(i) and s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA.
The protection covered by the “unfair dilution” condition in s
8(4)(_b_)(ii)(A) and s 55(3)(_b_)(i) and that covered by the “unfair
advantage” condition in s 8(4)(_b_)(ii)(B) and s 55(3)(_b_)(ii) are reserved
for trade marks which are “well known to the public at large in Singapore”
(_per_ s 8(4)(_b_)(ii) and s 55(3)(_b_)). The policy question in issue is the
extent of the protection which we wish to give to trade marks which are merely
“well known in Singapore” as opposed to “well known to the public at large in
Singapore”. In the absence of a clear legislative intent, we do not think that
trade marks which are merely “well known in Singapore” should be given
protection against the use of a similar or an identical mark on dissimilar
goods or services where such use does not give rise to confusion. Such
protection (_ie_ , protection despite the absence of confusion) should, for
now, properly be the preserve of a rare and privileged few. In this regard, it
is interesting to note that s 2 of the TDRA also amended the 1996 version of s
43(c) of the Lanham Act by adding a definition of a “famous” trade mark. Under
s 43(c)(2)(A) of the Lanham Act (as amended by s 2 of the TDRA), a “famous”
trade mark is one which is “widely recognized by the general consuming public
of the United States”. This amendment was made specifically to eliminate the
concept of “niche fame”, which was recognised in some earlier cases (see, for
instance, _Wedgwood Homes, Inc and Wedgwood Homes of Portland v Victor L Lund_
294 Or 493; 659 P 2d 377 (1983)). Thus, in the US, both dilution by blurring
and dilution by tarnishment are now actionable only _vis-à-vis_ trade marks
which are well-known on a national level. This development reflects Prof J
Thomas McCarthy’s earlier observation in _McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
Competition_ (West Pub Co, 4th Ed, 1996) at §  24:108:

To save the dilution doctrine from abuse by plaintiffs whose marks are not
famous, a large neon sign should be placed adjacent wherever the doctrine
resides, reading: “The Dilution Rule: **Only Strong Marks Need Apply**.”
[emphasis in bold in original]

(6) The position in Australia

230 We wish also, for completeness, to make a passing reference to
developments in Australia. Section 120(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth)
(“the 1995 Australian TMA”) states:

A person infringes a registered trade mark if:

(a) the trade mark is well known in Australia; and

(b) the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical
with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to:

(i) goods (**_unrelated goods_**) that are not of the same description as that
of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered (**_registered
goods_**) or are not closely related to services in respect of which the trade
mark is registered (**_registered services_**); or

(ii) services (**_unrelated services_**) that are not of the same description
as that of the registered services or are not closely related to registered
goods; and

(c) because the trade mark is well known, the sign would be likely to be taken
as indicating a connection between the unrelated goods or services and the
registered owner of the trade mark; and

(d) for that reason, the interests of the registered owner are likely to be
adversely affected.

[emphasis in bold italics in original]

231 Section 120(3) of the 1995 Australian TMA is based on Art 16(3) of the
TRIPS Agreement. Like s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA, s 120(3) of the 1995
Australian TMA does not expressly incorporate the confusion requirement. The
similarities between these two provisions do not end there. Reminiscent of the
different approaches taken by our legislature to the protection of well-known
trade marks prior to and after the 2004 TMA amendments, the Australian
parliament had earlier passed the Trade Marks Act 1994 (No 156 of 1994) (Cth)
(“the 1994 Australian TMA”). (That Act, although passed by the Australian
legislature, never eventually came into effect, and was instead repealed by
and replaced with the 1995 Australian TMA.) Section 129(3) of the 1994
Australian TMA (the then equivalent of what is now s 120(3) of the 1995
Australian TMA) required a likelihood that the defendant’s dissimilar goods or
services might be “mistaken as goods or services dealt with or provided by the
[plaintiff]” (see s 129(3)(c)(i) of the 1994 Australian TMA) before the
defendant’s “identical … or deceptively similar” (_per_ s 129(3)(b) of the
1994 Australian TMA) trade mark would be treated as having infringed the
plaintiff’s registered well-known trade mark, but the 1995 Australian TMA
omitted this requirement. This has led to some debate as to whether the
confusion requirement is implicit in s 120(3) of the 1995 Australian TMA.

232 There has been support, on many of the grounds relied on by the
Respondents in the present case, for the proposition that s 120(3) of the 1995
Australian TMA means exactly what it says, _ie_ , that this provision does not
incorporate the confusion requirement (see Maurice Gonsalves & Patrick Flynn,
“Dilution Down Under: The Protection of Well-Known Trade Marks in Australia”
[2006] EIPR 174). There is also some _dicta_ in the Australian High Court case
of _Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited_ (2000) 202 CLR
45 which suggest that s 120(3) of the 1995 Australian TMA should be considered
as an anti-dilution provision (_ie_ , as not requiring proof of confusion).
However, it has been argued powerfully in Handler’s article ([175] _supra_)
that the opposite must be true. Apart from highlighting the historical reasons
rooted in Art 6 _bis_ of the Paris Convention and Art 16(3) of the TRIPS
Agreement (along the lines which we discussed earlier), Handler’s article also
observes that the wording of s 120(3) of the 1995 Australian TMA and the
structure of trade mark protection under Australian law as a whole suggest
that confusion is a requirement under s 120(3). These factors are largely
idiosyncratic to the 1995 Australian TMA and do not assist us in interpreting
s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA. Further, and crucially, unlike Singapore,
Australia has not incorporated into its legislation Art 4(1)(b)(ii) and Art
4(1)(b)(iii) of the Joint Recommendation, which address, respectively, the
unfair dilution and the taking of unfair advantage of the distinctive
character of the plaintiff’s well-known trade mark. Nevertheless, despite
these differences between Australia’s s 120(3) and Singapore’s s 55(3)(_a_),
it would be of interest to see how the Australian courts definitively resolve
the issue of whether confusion is required under the former.

(7) Our view on whether confusion is required under section 55(3)(a) of the
current TMA

233 Parliament has given proprietors of “well known trade mark[s]” (as defined
in s 2(1) of the current TMA) the right to have their trade marks protected in
Singapore even if those trade marks are not registered here. Furthermore, it
is relatively easy for trade marks (whether or not registered in Singapore) to
be considered “well known in Singapore” so as to be entitled to the protection
set out in the current TMA. In our view, the widespread availability of
protection to trade marks which are “well known in Singapore” should be
balanced by interpreting s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA as requiring a
likelihood of confusion to be shown before an injunction to restrain the use
of the defendant’s trade mark on (_inter alia_) goods or services dissimilar
to those of the plaintiff can be obtained. A second, much more extensive level
of protection is granted to trade marks which have attained the coveted status
of being “well known to the public at large in Singapore”. These trade marks,
which form a rare and exclusive class, are entitled to protection from use of
the defendant’s trade mark on dissimilar goods or services even in the absence
of a likelihood of confusion; that is, such trade marks are entitled to
protection against the unfair dilution and the taking of unfair advantage of
their distinctive character.

**_Our decision on the Respondents’ claim for trade mark infringement_**

234 In the instant case, we agree with the Judge’s finding (at [74] of the
Judgment) that the tests to be adopted for the purposes of the “connection”
requirement and the “likely to damage the [plaintiff’s] interests” requirement
in s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA would yield the same results as those
obtained from applying the corresponding tests _vis-à-vis_ the Respondents’
claim for passing off (which tests are, respectively, whether the Appellant
has made a misrepresentation to the relevant sector of the public (_ie_ , the
persons delineated at [66] above) which causes that section of the public to
mistakenly think that the Project has the same source as or is connected with
the Respondents’ resorts, and whether such misrepresentation has resulted in
or is likely to result in damage to the goodwill attached to the “Aman”
names). We thus uphold the Judge’s decision that the claim under s 55(3)(_a_)
of the current TMA has been made out. However, we pause to clarify that while
the tests relating to misrepresentation and damage under the law of passing
off are substantively the same as the tests relating to, respectively, the
“connection” requirement and the “likely to damage the [plaintiff’s]
interests” requirement in s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA, the two sets of
tests are not identical in one aspect. An important distinction is that the
tests relating to misrepresentation and damage in passing off actions concern
the plaintiff’s goodwill (see [69] above), whereas the corresponding tests
under s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA concern the _interests_ of the plaintiff
and _not_ its goodwill (indeed, as the definition of “well known trade mark”
in s 2(1) of the current TMA makes clear, the plaintiff’s trade mark may be a
“well known trade mark” for the purposes of s 55(3)(_a_) even if the plaintiff
has no goodwill in Singapore).

**Conclusion**

235 The Respondents succeeded in both their passing off claim and their claim
under s 55(3)(_a_) of the current TMA in the court below, and we see no reason
to vary the Judge’s orders, which were properly limited to a more modest scope
than what was initially prayed for (see [4] and [75] of the Judgment). This
appeal is therefore dismissed with costs and the usual consequential orders.
