** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. These three actions are closely related in their facts and should have
been consolidated but were not. As the second and the third actions are
essentially the sequels to the first action, I decided to try all three as one
consolidated action so as to obviate repetition of evidence. **

Suit No. 1519 of 2001

**

2\. This was commenced on 30 November 2001. The Plaintiff is and was at all
material times a member of the First Defendant ("the TRC"), an unincorporated
association registered under the Societies Act. The TRC is an umbrella body to
which some Indian organizations are affiliated. The Second Defendant was at
all material times the General Secretary of the TRC.

3\. The TRC’s Constitution sets out the aims and objects of the organization
which are all directed towards the safeguarding and the promotion of the
interests of the Tamil speaking community and their language. Rule 12 of the
Constitution places the administration of the TRC in the hands of a Management
Council ("the MC") which is elected biennially. Under Rule 13, the MC is
directed to meet at least once every month and notice of MC meetings is to be
given not less than seven days before the meetings. Rule 14 provides that the
General Secretary is to prepare the agenda and maintain the minutes of the MC
and of the Annual General Meeting ("AGM") and the Extraordinary General
Meeting ("EOGM").

4\. The Plaintiff was elected as one of two Deputy General Secretaries of the
TRC at the AGM held on 23 July 2000. He would therefore have held such office
in the MC until the next AGM in 2002\. However, at a MC meeting held on 15
February 2001, the Deputy President (S Moganaruban, the Second Defendant in
Suit No. 801 of 2002) attempted to remove him from his office despite the fact
that such intention to remove him was not listed as an item in the agenda for
that MC meeting. The Plaintiff was "charged" with not showing proper respect
to the President of the TRC and to the Chairman of the MC meetings. He was
also accused of being disruptive at MC meetings. This action took the
Plaintiff completely by surprise. He was not given a reasonable opportunity to
defend himself. The motion to remove him from office was put to a vote but was
not carried as the requisite two-thirds majority vote was not achieved.

5\. The Plaintiff averred that the above attempt to remove him from office was
invalid and ineffective as it was ultra vires the Constitution. He alleged
that the motion to remove him was not in the agenda for that meeting and he
did not have seven days’ notice of it in any event. There was also no formal
charge produced so that he could be informed precisely of the case he had to
meet. He was not told of the provision of the Constitution under which he was
charged or was being dealt with and was not accorded a reasonable opportunity
to defend himself. He averred further that the said attempt at removing him
from office was made mala fides.

6\. Since the MC considered a two-thirds majority vote was necessary to remove
the Plaintiff from office, he averred that the motion must have proceeded
under Rule 18.1 of the Constitution which provides:

> > "18. EXPULSION OF MEMBERS

> > 18.1 Any member whose conduct is in the considered opinion of the MC
> prejudicial or contrary to the interest of the Council, shall be requested
> to resign or be asked to exculpate himself in writing. If the exculpatory
> statement, considered in the sole discretion of the MC exercised in good
> faith, is unsatisfactory, the member shall be expelled by resolution carried
> by a majority of the two third of the MC voting at the meeting at which the
> resolution is moved. Any member so expelled shall have the right to appeal
> to the next AGM."

7\. On 16 February 2001, the TRC wrote to the Plaintiff and sought to expel
him from his office under the said Rule 18.1. The letter stated five charges
against him and asked him to show cause by 22 February 2001 why he should not
be expelled from the MC. The Plaintiff responded in writing on 20 February
2001.

8\. On 1 March 2001, a MC meeting was held. He attended the MC meeting but
left before the vote was taken. He was informed by a letter dated 7 March 2001
that he had been expelled from his office of Deputy General Secretary under
the above-mentioned Rule 18.1. He averred that the removal was invalid and
ineffective as it was ultra vires the TRC Constitution and was also made mala
fides.

9\. On 25 October 2001, a notice of AGM to be held on 2 December 2001 was sent
to all members of the TRC. The Annual Report for 2000 was one of the documents
attached to this notice of AGM. The said Annual Report stated that the
Plaintiff had "ceased" to hold the office of Deputy General Secretary on 1
March 2001 and his office was "vacant". The Plaintiff received the notice and
the documents attached thereto as a member of the TRC.

10\. On 19 November 2001, the Plaintiff wrote to the TRC stating he considered
himself a duly elected Deputy General Secretary and asked the TRC to confirm
that he still held that office and remained a member of the MC and that such
confirmation be made by circular to all members of the TRC prior to the AGM
scheduled for 2 December 2001. The TRC refused to do so and the Plaintiff
therefore had "to commence these proceedings to protect his name and
reputation and rectify the wrongs that have been done to him, in particular,
the wrongful expulsion from his duly elected office" (paragraph 25 of the
Amended Statement of Claim).

11\. The Plaintiff further averred that the Annual Report for 2000 was
published by the TRC and/or the Second Defendant (the General Secretary) and
that it contained defamatory statements about him. At page 9 of the Annual
Report, it was stated:

> "TITLE OF OFFICE NAME
>
> Deputy General Secretary Mathi Alegan (ceased wef 1.3.2001)".

At page 69 of the same, under the heading "Management Council for the Period
2000-2002", the following appeared:

> "S/NO NAME
>
> Dy Gen Sec (vacant)".

12\. The Plaintiff averred that the words quoted above meant that he had
accepted the office in question for a two-year term but had been removed
before that for serious misconduct or that he had irresponsibly resigned or
otherwise relinquished his office before the expiration of his term to the
detriment of the interest and well-being of the TRC. The words were also
alleged to mean that he was a person who could not be relied on or trusted to
act in the best interest of the TRC in particular or the Tamil community in
general and that he was incompetent, irresponsible, had the propensity to
challenge the authority of the MC without basis and was therefore unfit to be
a member of the MC. He also pleaded that the words complained of bore the said
meanings by way of innuendo. The President, the Deputy President, the General
Secretary and other officials of the TRC had disseminated false information to
the members of the TRC that he was a disruptive influence and had been acting
contrary to the best interests of the TRC. The members of the TRC would
therefore have concluded that the allegations of misconduct had been proved to
be true and that he had been removed for such misconduct in proper proceedings
taken out against him.

13\. By letters dated 30 November 2001 sent by courier, by AR registered post
and by hand, the Plaintiff, through his solicitors, demanded that the TRC and
the Second Defendant retract the offending words immediately, apologize,
undertake not to repeat the same and compensate the Plaintiff by way of
damages. The Defendants did not comply with the Plaintiff’s demands.

14\. The Plaintiff therefore claimed:

> > a. an order quashing the decision of the MC of 1 March 2001 removing him
> from office under Rule 18.1 of the Constitution or otherwise;
>>

>> b. a declaration that he was not removed from office by the MC on 1 March
2001 and continues to hold the office;

>>

>> c. damages for libel against the TRC and/or the Second Defendant;

>>

>> d. aggravated damages against the TRC and/or the Second Defendant;

>>

>> e. exemplary damages against the TRC and/or the Second Defendant;

>>

>> f. an injunction to restrain the TRC and/or the Second Defendant, their
servants or agents or howsoever otherwise, from further publishing or causing
to be published the same or similar defamatory words;

>>

>> g. costs.

**

Suit No. 800 of 2002

**15\. This action was commenced on 8 July 2002. Here, the Plaintiff sued the
TRC, the General Secretary and Stamford Press (Pte) Ltd in respect of an
article appearing in the January 2002 issue of the Peravai, the official
publication of the TRC. The General Secretary was the editor of that issue and
Stamford Press (Pte) Ltd was the printer. At page 14 of that issue, there was
an article in English entitled "TRC Legal Action". The Tamil version appeared
at page 7. The article read:

> "TRC LEGAL ACTION
>
> The former Deputy General Secretary, MR MATHI ALEGEN s/o Gothendaraman has
> taken legal action against the Tamils’ Representative Council – a letter of
> demand was served two days before the AGM.
>
> One day before the AGM, the law firm Messrs Niru & Co. issued a Writ for
> wrongful expulsion of the member.
>
> The General membership decided to request the lawyers to convince their
> client to withdraw the legal action in the interests of the Tamil community
> – In the alternative, it was agreed that the Council would defend the
> action. Mr Imran of Tan Rajah & Cheah have been appointed to act in this
> matter.

> A high level Committee has been formed to handle the issue."

16\. The Plaintiff averred that the article defamed him as it meant that he
was expelled from membership of the TRC (as opposed to the MC), that he had
acted and continued to act in a manner inconsistent with the interests of the
TRC and the Tamil community in Singapore, that he was a person with a
dishonest or otherwise defective character unfit for serving the TRC and/or
the Tamil community here and that he acted in bad faith by making a demand an
unreasonable two days before the AGM and by commencing legal proceedings an
unreasonable one day before the AGM with a view to putting unfair pressure on
the TRC and the MC with the knowledge that nothing could be done in so short a
time. It also meant that his expulsion was warranted on the facts and that the
TRC had therefore decided to defend the action. He also pleaded innuendo in
that many members of the TRC and of the Tamil community knew that the TRC had
purported to remove him from office on 1 March 2001 for alleged misconduct and
would therefore conclude, on reading the article, that his misconduct must
have been so bad and severe that it warranted his expulsion from membership of
the TRC as well.

17\. The Plaintiff, in seeking aggravated damages from the Defendants for
their reckless and unreasonable conduct both before and after the publication
of the article, relied (among other things) on the Defendants’ denials that
the article was defamatory of him and their attempts at justifying the
article. He also pleaded that the January 2002 issue of the Peravai was
published without licence from the Ministry of Information and the Arts
("MITA") and that it was published recklessly and in great haste to maximize
the damage to him.

18\. He claimed aggravated damages for libel, an injunction and costs against
all three Defendants.

**

Suit No. 801 of 2002

**

19\. This action, like the one above, was commenced on 8 July 2002. Here, the
Defendants are the TRC and its Deputy President. This concerned the minutes of
the AGM held on 2 December 2001, circulated to all members of the TRC and
which the Second Defendant as Deputy President published and/or caused to be
published and/or facilitated the publication of. The minutes contained the
following passages which the Plaintiff said were defamatory of him:

(Paragraph 8.5)

> > "Dy President explained as to why Mr Mathi was expelled. He said that Mr
> Mathi did not respect the chair and had caused disruptions during meetings.
> He had been given an opportunity to defend his actions and the Management
> Committee had voted to expel him in accordance with the constitution. He
> said that legal suits should not be used as means to threaten an
> organisation for trivial matters. TRC was not a single organisation. It was
> a representative body. The decision to expel him was not made by any one
> person but rather a collective decision by TRC and its 26 affiliate
> organisations."

(Paragraph 8.18)

> > "Dy President said that too much had been discussed on this issue and he
> does (not) want to waste money and time for Mr Mathi’s matter."

20\. Much the same sort of particulars was given by the Plaintiff as to why
the words defamed him. He claimed aggravated damages for libel, an injunction
and costs against both Defendants.

**

The Interlocutory Applications

**

21\. Before the trial proper commenced, I dealt with an application by the
Defendants for security for costs to be furnished by the Plaintiff. The
application for security for costs was on the basis that the Plaintiff was
impecunious. Nothing was stated in the Defendants’ affidavit that would bring
the application within one of the four grounds provided in Order 23 rule 1 (1)
of the Rules of Court. For that reason, I dismissed the application with costs
fixed at $700 to be paid by the Defendants to the Plaintiff.

22\. In the midst of the Plaintiff’s testimony, I dealt with another
interlocutory application. This application made by the Plaintiff during the
trial was for an order that he be permitted to call S Chandra Das to testify
orally at the trial. S Chandra Das was a senior advisor of the TRC. The
Plaintiff wanted his objective evidence relating to the events in the TRC in
1999 and 2000 and whether he had given certain advice to the present President
of the TRC regarding the role of Nirumalan Pillay ("Niru"), an advocate and
solicitor, in the MC of the TRC. As S Chandra Das’ objective evidence was
sought, the Plaintiff thought it inappropriate to ask him for an affidavit of
his evidence in chief. His solicitors had informed S Chandra Das of their
intention to call him as a witness and he indicated that if called to give
evidence, he would do so. His solicitors had also informed the Defendants’
solicitors of such intention. The application could not have been taken out
earlier as there were attempts made to reach a mediated settlement of the
dispute and the intended witness was one of the persons approached to act as
mediator.

23\. The Defendants objected to the Plaintiff’s application as he should have
known what his case was months earlier. In any event, the Plaintiff and a few
others had written to S Chandra Das about the involvement of Niru in the TRC
and S Chandra Das’ response was in the bundles of documents prepared for the
trial.

24\. I saw no good reason why there should not be an affidavit of evidence in
chief by a non-partisan witness who had not indicated his reluctance to make
such an affidavit. The rules pertaining to affidavits of evidence in chief
were introduced to reduce trial time and to prevent "ambushes" or surprises by
parties at trial. Oral testimony should therefore be permitted only where good
reason is shown. There was also no good reason why the application to call the
intended witness could not have been made much earlier. After all, the
suggestion to invite the intended witness to be a mediator or one of the
mediators came about only when the parties were already before the court.
Accordingly, I dismissed this application and ordered the Plaintiff to pay
costs of $700 to the Defendants.

**

The Plaintiff’s Case

**25\. The Plaintiff traced the history on how he came to be in the same team
as the present President of the TRC, R Theyvendran. The 1998/1999 MC was led
by one Kesavan who was said to have managed the TRC poorly. In November 1998,
a motion of no confidence was proposed against the Kesavan MC. At the same
time, a team comprising the Plaintiff, Theyvendran, Moganaruban, some of the
present MC members and Niru was formed to try and prevent mismanagement of the
TRC. Niru suggested that Kesavan be allowed to complete his term of office on
condition that he agree not to stand for re-election at the next AGM. A
compromise was achieved and the motion of no confidence became unnecessary. A
committee known as the TRC 21 was formed under the chairmanship of Niru to
chart the future course of the TRC.

26\. However, Kesavan decided to stand for re-election and phantom members
were created. This ploy was thwarted by an order of court obtained on 11
September 1999 by the Plaintiff, Theyvendran, Moganaruban and two others. At
the 1999 AGM, the Kesavan team walked out and there was an impasse. Niru then
proposed that an interim committee be set up to look after the interests of
the TRC. The committee would comprise leaders from the various Indian
organizations. This proposal was accepted and Theyvendran and Moganaruban
became members of this interim committee. Niru declined appointment to the
committee.

27\. Disputes continued from the Kesavan faction leading the advisors of the
TRC to establish a new and independent interim committee. The advisors urged
Theyvendran, Niru and Kesavan not to stand for election at the 2000 AGM but to
serve in other capacities so as to allow the hostility that had developed to
dissipate.

28\. However, only Niru heeded the advice not to stand for election.
Theyvendran and Moganaruban insisted on standing for election. During the
discussions leading to the two of them standing for election, Theyvendran
undertook that after he was elected to office in the MC, he would focus on
managing the TRC’s Co-operative as he and Moganaruban had experience in that
field. Niru would lead the TRC in the long run and this would be achieved by
the MC co-opting him at a later date in accordance with the Constitution of
the TRC. The team led by Theyvendran (which included the Plaintiff) agreed
with his proposed plan of action. That team went on to win the elections at
the AGM held on 23 July 2000 and to form the MC, with Theyvendran assuming the
office of President of the TRC and Moganaruban taking on the position of
Deputy President.

29\. Immediately after the 2000 AGM, Theyvendran convened a MC meeting by
gathering all the elected members. No prior notice was given. There was also
no discussion on the proposed agenda. He began to make various decisions and
to give directions. He directed the appointment of leaders of several sub-
committees within the TRC when this ought to have been a collective decision
after proper discussions among the senior MC members. He further directed the
setting up of a committee to handle the celebrations for the approaching
National Day which the Plaintiff did not think was proper as this should have
come within the purview of the Cultural Committee. From that very first MC
meeting on 23 July 2000, the Plaintiff felt that Theyvendran was not
conducting himself properly as the President of the TRC as he had the tendency
to make decisions which suited himself and without obtaining the views of
others. However, in order not to cause any embarrassment, the Plaintiff
decided not to voice his feelings at that meeting. Instead, he confided in
another MC member, Amallathasan.

30\. It soon dawned on the Plaintiff that Theyvendran was going to run the TRC
as though it belonged to him. The President wanted only "yes-men" and
constantly used his influence and financial backing to obtain their support.
He was fully supported in this by his Deputy President. The Plaintiff, a taxi
driver, alleged that Theyvendran had made the wrong assumption about him –
that he, coming from a humble background, would do as he was told in the MC.
However, he was not prepared under any circumstances to compromise his
principles by doing Theyvendran’s bidding.

31\. The second MC meeting in August 2000 was conducted in much the same
domineering manner. The third MC meeting held on 5 September 2000 was a
special MC meeting conducted in the premises of Stamford Press Centre, a
printing company controlled by Theyvendran. As usual, the President would
raise issues not listed in the agenda. He talked about the problems he was
having with the Board of Directors of the Co-operative and, when pressed by
the Plaintiff to explain in detail the problems, declined to elaborate and
simply said that the MC should leave him to deal with the problems. He
appeared agitated and was displeased with the Plaintiff’s tenacious
questioning. Further, no minutes were disclosed for that meeting.

32\. The Plaintiff felt that the President had reneged on his pre-election
undertaking concerning Niru. Although he had no personal interest in getting
Niru to join the MC, he felt it was necessary to address this issue as he
believed that Niru could contribute significantly to the cause of the TRC. He
therefore spoke to Amallathasan who managed to arrange an informal meeting
with Theyvendran together with the Presidents of the affiliated organizations
before the second MC meeting. The Plaintiff, who attended that informal
meeting, said that Theyvendran claimed he did not do anything to facilitate
Niru’s entry into the MC because certain "top people" were not in favour of
it. Theyvendran also told those present to give him six months to do something
about it.

33\. Subsequent MC meetings were conducted by the President in the same
dictatorial style. He was also getting increasingly agitated by the
Plaintiff’s questions about the Co-operative. At the meeting of 14 September
2000, Theyvendran announced that he had decided to close down the Co-operative
because the Board of Directors refused to do his bidding and he had no time to
run it in any event. When the Plaintiff questioned him again, he challenged
the Plaintiff to take over the Co-operative. The Plaintiff accepted the
challenge.

34\. At that meeting, the Plaintiff raised again the issue concerning Niru.
That agitated the President to the extent that he shouted at the Plaintiff and
accused him of being a culprit and a troublemaker. He stated that the
Plaintiff should not raise the same issue again as he had already decided to
wait for six months before dealing with it. He repeated that "top people" did
not like Niru. When asked by the Plaintiff to identify the "top people" so
that he could speak to them about the issue, Theyvendran said he was referring
to Chandra Das. The Plaintiff suggested that arrangements be made for the MC
to meet the senior advisor but Theyvendran refused and said that if the
Plaintiff wished, he could go and meet Chandra Das himself.

35\. The President kept on raging during those exchanges. He even banged the
table violently and demanded the Plaintiff’s resignation. He then stormed out
of that meeting.

36\. The Plaintiff apologized to those remaining at the meeting for the heated
outburst. Moganaruban asked him to apologize to Theyvendran as well but he
insisted he owed the President no apology.

37\. At the next MC meeting on 5 October 2000, Theyvendran did not turn up.
Moganaruban chaired the meeting. The Niru issue was discussed once again and
Moganaruban announced that Theyvendran had written to Chandra Das about it. He
added that they would revisit the issue after Chandra Das responded. The
Plaintiff asked for a copy of the letter written by Theyvendran but his
request was turned down.

38\. Sometime after that meeting, the Plaintiff met with five other MC members
to discuss the Niru issue. They decided to present a joint written
representation to Chandra Das setting out the factual background in order to
seek his guidance. They approached Niru for advice. Niru suggested that the
matter be set out accurately, truthfully and fairly. On 6 November 2000, the
six MC members signed the letter and sent it to Chandra Das.

39\. At the next MC meeting held on 14 November 2000, Moganaruban announced
that Chandra Das had replied to Theyvendran and claimed that the reply
confirmed Theyvendran’s position that "the top" did not want Niru in the TRC.
The Plaintiff did not accept that statement and asked that the reply be read
out. He also repeated his request that Theyvendran’s letter be produced. Both
his requests were not acceded to and a lot of heated arguments followed.
Moganaruban then led some MC members to approve the following motion:

> "The elected personnel of the current MC shall continue to manage the TRC
> till the election of a new MC in accordance with the constitution. No
> further discussion on the issue of bringing Mr Nirumalan into the MC would
> be allowed. The TRC MC shall continue with its activities and projects for
> the benefit of the community and all members of MC were requested to work
> towards bringing TRC as an united and apex organization for Tamils."

The Plaintiff and Amallathasan objected to the motion.

40\. It became absolutely clear to the Plaintiff that Theyvendran, this time
through Moganaruban, harboured very deep-seated resentment against him for the
queries that he had repeatedly raised. He saw the letter dated 14 November
2000 from Chandra Das subsequently and realized that nothing in it suggested
Niru’s intended role in the TRC was not favourably received by Chandra Das or
any "top people’. That letter, addressed to Theyvendran and copied to "Mr
Amallathasan & Others" at Amallathasan’s residential address, stated:

> "Dear Theyvendran,
>
> Six members of your Committee have asked me to state my views regarding Mr
> Niru Pillai and his role in TRC.
>
> When you asked me about a role for him after the TRC elections (at the time
> of the TRC Multi-Purpose Co-operative dispute) I suggested the position of
> legal adviser, since he did not contest the election. You also wrote to me
> recently on Mr Niru Pillai and I replied to you accordingly.

> I cannot tell you who should be in or not of the committee. For the record,
> I must state that it is for you and your Committee to decide who should be
> in the TRC Council.
>
> Grateful, if you can bring this to the attention of your Council Members."

41\. Theyvendran also made a big issue concerning the Plaintiff’s signing of
some blank receipts for donations collected during the National Day dinner.
Although the Plaintiff had explained to the Chairperson of the National Day
Dinner Committee that he had signed some blank receipts which were eventually
not used, Theyvendran unjustly accused the Plaintiff of dishonesty without
allowing him to explain to the MC. He directed that an investigation be
carried out by the said Chairperson and a report issued and did not even allow
the Chairperson to explain.

42\. At the MC meeting of 30 January 2001, the Plaintiff raised the issue of
the minutes of previous meetings not being recorded and passed and this riled
Theyvendran who continued his attack on the Plaintiff regarding the blank
receipts although the report confirmed that he had not acted improperly in the
matter. This again showed Theyvendran’s ill will against the Plaintiff. When
the Plaintiff asked him for an apology for having insinuated that he had
manipulated the accounts, Theyvendran refused. The President was so agitated
at that meeting he could scarcely control himself. He screamed and shouted at
Amallathasan and challenged him to take over the presidency which Moganaruban
promptly seconded. Theyvendran then stormed out of the meeting followed by
Moganaruban.

43\. Pursuant to a notice issued on 7 February 2001, a MC meeting was held on
15 February 2001. Theyvendran did not attend this meeting and it was therefore
chaired by the Deputy President, Moganaruban. From the start of the meeting,
it was clear that the Deputy President had no intention of keeping to the
stated agenda. As usual, no minutes of the previous MC meeting were presented
for discussion although this was a strict requirement for MC meetings.
Moganaruban glossed over this by saying that they intended to discuss other
matters. He launched into a speech on how the Plaintiff was unable to see eye
to eye with the President and this was the prelude to the manipulative act to
expel the Plaintiff from the MC. Moganaruban then demanded that the Plaintiff
resign from the MC since the latter was not able to work with the President.
The Plaintiff was surprised and outraged by this and he made it clear to all
present that he had done no wrong and had no intention of resigning. Besides,
the question of his resignation was not included in the agenda in the first
place.

44\. Upon his refusal, Moganaruban then purported to prefer charges of
misconduct against the Plaintiff. As this was also not in the agenda, it again
took the Plaintiff completely by surprise. No formal notice of any charges had
been given and he was not told the relevant provision of the constitution
under which he was being dealt with. To him, "it was an ambush, all planned
and calculated to achieve maximum effect". He realized that Moganaruban and
those allied to Theyvendran had planned to use that meeting to stage a scene
leading to his expulsion. He felt it was a shameful and dishonest attempt
engineered by the President to expel him.

45\. Despite the Plaintiff’s objections, Moganaruban put the motion to a vote
but could not secure a two-thirds majority anyway. The motion therefore
failed.

46\. The next day, 16 February 2001, the TRC issued a letter to the Plaintiff
setting out the following:

> > "Dear Sir,
>>

>> **

>>

>> MISCONDUCT AT MANAGEMENT COUNCIL MEETING

>>

>> **

>>

>> It is noted that at the Management Council Meeting held on 15 Feb 2001, the
Chairperson, Mr Mohana Ruben preferred charges against you and proposed that
you be expelled from the Council.

>>

>> The charges preferred against you are as follows:

> > 1 that you have not shown proper respect for the Chairman at MC meetings.
>>

>> 2 That you kept deliberately speaking on a subject despite repeated
reminders by Council members to proceed with the matter on the agenda.

>>

>> 3 That you have refused to accept the decision of the President, which was
based on the majority views of the members present

>>

>> 4 That you have stated that the President was lying.

>>

>> 5 And your conduct has resulted in disruptive meetings and the abrupt
ending of more then one MC meetings.

> > In accordance with TRC Constitution (18.1), you are hereby given notice to
> show cause by 22 Feb 2001 as to why you should not be expelled from the TRC
> Management Council for your behavior. It is the considered opinion of the
> Council members that your action was prejudicial and contrary to the
> interest of the Council.
>>

>> (signed)

>>

>> Pandiyan Vellasami

>>

>> General Secretary

>>

>> (On behalf of the TRC MC)

>>

>> cc Mr R Theyvendran President, TRC

>>

>> Mr Mohana Ruben Dy President, TRC".

47\. The Plaintiff was overcome by profound sadness when he read the above
letter as it showed that there was a vendetta against him and that compliance
with the TRC constitution did not matter. It seemed to him that it did not
matter to those seeking his removal that they had failed to do so on the same
complaints at the 15 February 2001 MC meeting. The last sentence of the above
letter also indicated that the MC had pre-judged the matter.

48\. On 20 February 2001, the Plaintiff personally delivered his two-page
response to the General Secretary of the TRC. In his letter, he set out what
had happened at the 15 February 2001 MC meeting. He asked the Deputy President
then what wrong he had done that warranted the demand for his resignation and
the reply was that at some previous meeting, the Plaintiff had banged the
table. When the Plaintiff asked if there was anything else, he was told he
should know for himself. The Plaintiff replied then that it was the President
who had first banged the table at the meeting in question and then walked out
of the meeting stating that the Plaintiff must resign or he (the President)
would. However, the President went on to chair the next MC meeting and there
was no longer any issue about the banging of the table or of anyone resigning.
The allegation about table-banging was thus "never a live issue on 15.2.2001".
In his letter, the Plaintiff reiterated that the matter had been put to a vote
and the motion was defeated. He also stated that no decision was taken by the
MC that any action on his part was prejudicial and contrary to the interest of
the MC and ended by saying, "As such, your notice dated 16.2.2001 to me to
show cause is invalid and without any basis. I refute all the allegations made
against me. I also reserve all my rights as an elected officer of the
Management Council". There was no reply to the Plaintiff’s letter.

49\. However, in the meantime, a letter dated 19 February 2001 giving notice
of a special MC meeting scheduled to be held on 1 March 2001 was sent out. It
was stated in that letter that "this meeting is called to discuss the issues
brought against the council member, Mr G Mathialagan by the Dy President, Mr
Moganaruban at the meeting held on 15 Feb 2001." It also emphasized to all MC
members that "your attendance is utmost important". The Plaintiff was shocked
by this "unholy haste" to remove him as the MC had not even received his
response yet.

50\. The failure to disclose minutes of MC meetings continued to cause the
Plaintiff concern and on 20 February 2001, he and seven other MC members wrote
to the General Secretary to enquire why the minutes for 30 January 2001 were
not distributed in spite of a specific request for such at the 15 February
2001 meeting. They requested that all minutes that had not been distributed,
including those for 30 January 2001 and for 15 February 2001, be sent to all
MC members immediately. The General Secretary replied to the eight of them on
23 February 2001 stating that the President, the Deputy President and he
decided not to distribute the minutes for 30 January 2001 as the meeting on 15
February 2001 was intended to address only the first item on the agenda, that
is, "To discuss the abrupt ending of the last MC meeting held on 30 January
2001 (to be chaired by Mr Moganaruban)". He reminded them that the Deputy
President had explained all this at the commencement of the 15 February 2001
meeting and that his proposal to discuss only the said item was accepted by
everyone present. He also stated that minutes of all previous meetings had
been distributed and accepted at subsequent meetings and that copies could be
obtained at the TRC office (in Peace Centre, Sophia Road).

51\. On 1 March 2001, for the first time, all the representatives of the TRC
affiliates attended the special MC meeting. The Plaintiff had no doubt that
this was arranged by Moganaruban to secure the necessary votes. One Jalaludin,
an unauthorized person, was even introduced as an observer by Moganaruban.

52\. Just before the meeting began, the Plaintiff was handed a copy of the
letter containing the charges preferred against him. Although it appeared to
be a copy of the show cause letter of 16 February 2001, it was dated 1 March
2001. The Plaintiff pointed this out to the General Secretary who, after
exchanging glances with the Deputy President seated next to him, muttered that
it was a mistake and used a pen to change the date to 16 February 2001 and
then returned the amended copy to the Plaintiff. The 1 March 2001 letter also
had only four charges instead of five, omitting the charge "That you have
stated that the President was lying" listed as the fourth charge in the 16
February 2001 show cause letter.

53\. Standing Orders were issued for the 1 March 2001 MC meeting giving the
President extensive power as to the conduct of MC meetings. Members were
allowed only three minutes to speak on any subject. Moganaruban proposed the
adoption of these Standing Orders but added that they did not apply to the
President or the Deputy President.

54\. The minutes for the 15 February 2001 MC meeting were again not produced
at this meeting. The Plaintiff and some MC members raised this issue but
Moganaruban refused to circulate the minutes. Instead, he instructed the
General Secretary to read out the minutes.

55\. The Deputy President then began to speak at great length for Theyvendran,
saying he was a good President who was unable to conduct meetings because of
the Plaintiff’s rude and disruptive behaviour. He then referred to the show
cause letter (of 1 March 2002), stating that it had been sent to the Plaintiff
and asking the Plaintiff what he had to say in response to the charges.

56\. The Plaintiff began by asking what wrong he had done and whether he had
acted against the TRC constitution. He pointed out that he had banged the
table only after the President had done so and that the meeting was an illegal
one as minutes of previous meetings had not been produced, particularly when
the charges against him related to what he had done during those previous
meetings. He also contended that the three-minute rule in the Standing Orders
was unfair as it was clearly insufficient for him to respond to all the
charges and that it should also apply to the President in any event. He
pointed out that his letter of 20 February 2001 in response to the show cause
letter of 16 February 2001 was not produced at that meeting for the benefit of
all members, particularly those who were not present at the previous meetings.

57\. While he was making his defence, Moganaruban interrupted rudely and
demanded that he stop, claiming that he had already spoken for more than three
minutes. The Plaintiff protested as that was untrue. Moganaruban responded by
threatening to dismiss him from the meeting. At that juncture, other members
such as Amallathasan spoke and protested at the unfair manner in which the MC
meeting was being conducted. However, Moganaruban said he was not interested
in hearing them and the Chairman could do whatever he wanted and could speak
for as long as he wished. He then demanded that those who were standing or
speaking sit down or be expelled from the meeting, repeating the Standing
Orders. The Plaintiff and several other members then said that the way the
meeting was being conducted was illegal and unjust and he left the meeting,
followed by several others.

58\. The Plaintiff subsequently received a letter dated 7 March 2001 from the
TRC informing him he had been expelled for misconduct under the said rule 18.1
of the constitution. He felt very aggrieved but was convinced that he could
get no justice for so long as Theyvendran and his "lackeys" were running the
MC. There was therefore no point in going back to the TRC to settle the
dispute although his removal was wrongful and illegal. He sought advice from
Niru and was told by the lawyer it was not for him (Niru) to interfere and
that the Plaintiff should let matters rest as the continuing disputes would
not project a good image of the TRC. The Plaintiff accepted the "good advice".

59\. However, months later, when the Plaintiff received the notice of AGM to
be held on 2 December 2001, he noticed that his office was described as
"vacant" and that he had "ceased" to hold that office. It was to him a
malicious misrepresentation. That led to his letter of 19 November 2001 to the
General Secretary where he repeated essentially the events in February and
March 2001 set out above. He protested that he had been "denied the very basic
rights of natural justice in at least two respects" in that he was subjected
to the same charges more than once and by the same accusers and that he was
not accorded a fair opportunity to be heard. He pointed out for the first time
that rule 18.1 of the constitution was for the purpose of expelling a person
from membership of the TRC and not for expelling a MC member from office. He
alleged that he had been a victim of a vendetta launched against him, in
particular by the President and the Deputy President. He concluded his letter
by demanding:

> "That you confirm to me in writing that I am still the Hon. Deputy General
> Secretary and that I remain a Management Council member.
>
> That this confirmation is made by way of an official circular and sent to
> all members prior to the forthcoming AGM on 2.12.01.
>
> Please respond to my requests in writing by 27.11.01."

60\. The Plaintiff alleged that the failure of the President and the Deputy
President to produce minutes at MC meetings assumed a more sinister
significance when, after discovery of documents had taken place in these
proceedings, he found that the minutes for the meetings held on 5 October 2000
and on 30 January 2001 had been amended and "the discrepancies are manifest".
He was shocked to learn that the MC could have descended to fabrication of
minutes of meetings. Even the letter purportedly setting out the charges
against him was fabricated as the show cause letter of 16 February 2001 had
different contents from the one originally dated 1 March 2001.

61\. The Plaintiff then set out his case in defamation in respect of the
Annual Report for 2000 along the same lines as his pleadings (summarized
earlier in this judgment). Where his case in defamation in relation to the
Peravai publication was concerned, he said that his solicitors made a search
for the MITA number of Peravai in order to ascertain the details as to its
publishers, editor, licensee and other particulars. The inquiries revealed
that the TRC was not on record as being the publisher of any publication. His
solicitors then wrote to MITA to confirm the position and were told that the
publishing permit granted to the TRC expired on 23 October 2001. The Plaintiff
then wrote to the Minister in charge of MITA to complain that no action was
being taken against the unlicensed publication which could continue to defame
him in subsequent issues. Sometime in May 2002, his solicitors received the
papers relating to the TRC’s application for a renewal of the licence. MITA
also replied to say that a warning was issued to the TRC. The Defendants’
solicitors’ subsequent response to the Plaintiff’s solicitors on this issue
was that it was an administrative oversight that the permit for the Peravai
was not renewed and that there was nothing sinister in it. In his evidence,
the Plaintiff maintained that the fact the January 2002 issue of Peravai was
an illegal publication constituted malice by the Defendants against him.
Further, instead of setting out the full version, including his contentions in
respect of his removal, the Peravai stated categorically that he was removed
as a member.

62\. In reply to the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of demand in June 2002 in
respect of the alleged defamation in the January 2002 issue of the Peravai,
the Defendants’ solicitors stated that they did not agree that the article
defamed the Plaintiff. They went on to say:

> > "The article is clear as to the fact that the former Deputy General
> Secretary had issued a writ for his wrongful expulsion as Deputy General
> Secretary. This is a fact. It is also a fact that Mr Mathi Alegen had been
> removed from his position as Deputy General Secretary and this was within
> the knowledge of the members. Your client’s pleadings in Suit No.
> 1519/2001/Q confirm this as do the discussions at preceding Annual General
> Meeting.
>>

>> If your client has any reservation in this respect, our clients will
clarify the matter at the upcoming AGM as well as the next issue of
"Peravai.".

63\. The Plaintiff’s solicitors responded by saying that the Defendants’
attempt to justify the article would be relied on in a claim for aggravated
damages and that the Plaintiff "for his part needs no clarification".

64\. Where the Plaintiff’s third action was concerned, he alleged that the
minutes of the AGM held on 2 December 2001 were published by the TRC and that
Moganaruban, the Second Defendant in this action, uttered the words in issue
and to that extent, published the words or facilitated their publication. As a
result of the statement made by Moganaruban and put in writing in the formal
minutes of meeting, the Plaintiff said he suffered severe anguish and was the
subject of constant ridicule in the Tamil community. He further alleged that
the statement was calculated to disparage him and was actuated by malice as
shown in the events after the AGM in July 2000 to the special MC meeting of 1
March 2001.

65\. R Kumaran, a life member of the TRC testified that he was not an active
member but attended AGMs regularly. At the request of the Plaintiff, he
attended and tape recorded the proceedings at the AGM on 2 December 2001 held
at the Ceylon Sports Club. The proceedings were conducted in both English and
Tamil. On 15 December 2001, he went to the office of Niru & Co. to make a
tape-to-tape recording of the original tape. On 17 January 2002, he
transcribed the recording wherever English was used. The Plaintiff did the
transcript of those portions where Tamil was used.

66\. Kumaran added that the issue of the Plaintiff’s removal from office was
discussed at the AGM 2001. The MC announced that the Plaintiff had instituted
legal proceedings. A member, Kalaiselvan, said that the reason people resorted
to court action was because they were not satisfied.

67\. Kumaran also attended the AGM for 2002 held on 9 June 2002. He also tape
recorded the proceedings at the request of the Plaintiff. On 10 June 2002, he
went to the office of Niru & Co. to make a tape-to-tape recording of the
original tape and on 12 June 2002, he transcribed the relevant English portion
of the proceedings.

68\. Kumaran accepted that he had done the taping with a portable recorder
without the knowledge and consent of the MC. There were portions of the
proceedings omitted when he had to leave the meeting room to change to a new
tape. There were also inaudible segments in the recording.

69\. Amallathasan, a retiree, is the President of the Association of Singapore
Tamil Writers, an affiliated organization of the TRC. He was elected as one of
the Vice Presidents of the TRC at the AGM 2000. He testified that he got to
know the Plaintiff in 1995 and learnt that the Plaintiff, like himself, was a
person with great passion for the Tamil language. He also stated that the
Plaintiff was "a straightforward and forthright character with a big heart and
passion for Tamil culture and language".

70\. Amallathasan then related the history leading to the ouster of Kesavan
and his team from the MC. Niru was the leader of the team of five members who
approached Kesavan to strike the deal regarding the motion of no confidence in
Kesavan’s team. Niru also led the TRC 21 Committee which comprised various
leaders of Tamil organizations. Amallathasan was appointed a member of this
committee. The TRC 21 Committee prepared the report called The New Directions.
During this time, Niru introduced Theyvendran and Moganaruban to the team.

71\. When Kesavan reneged on the compromise, the leaders of the Tamil
organizations together with Niru and Theyvendran worked hard on their plans to
take over control of the MC. It was agreed after discussions that Theyvendran,
Niru and some other leaders would contest the elections. During these
discussions, Theyvendran expressed very clearly his interest in managing the
TRC Co-operative and said that he wanted to focus his attention on the Co-
operative together with Moganaruban. However, Niru suggested that Theyvendran
lead the team as President by virtue of his seniority while he (Niru) could
take on the office of General Secretary. Amallathasan did not find this
suggestion acceptable as Theyvendran and Moganaruban were not well known and
lacked the necessary influence to lead the TRC. Theyvendran gave them the
assurance that he was not interested in leading the MC and gave them the
undertaking that if he was elected President, he would concentrate solely on
the Co-operative, leaving the leadership of the MC to Niru. As a result,
everyone in the team agreed on the line-up for the elections.

72\. Amallathasan, together with Theyvendran, Moganaruban, the Plaintiff and
another, had to commence legal action against Kesavan’s team concerning the
issue of the list of eligible voters. They relied on Niru’s and Niru’s
partner’s (Liew Teck Huat) advice. At the AGM held in September 1999, they
received a lot of support from the members of the TRC and Kesavan’s team,
facing imminent defeat, walked out of the AGM. Niru then proposed the setting
up of an interim committee to complete the unfinished business. Amallathasan,
Theyvendran and Moganaruban were among the 17 persons appointed to this
interim committee which took advice from Niru on various matters because of
his experience and ability to deal properly with all members concerned. Niru
also liaised with Chandra Das on behalf of the interim committee. The post-
elections arrangements concerning Theyvendran and Niru were re-affirmed.

73\. Due to the deadlock created by Kesavan’s team, the advisors led by
Chandra Das decided to set up a fresh interim committee in January 2000
comprising neutral members.

74\. They continued with their preparations for the AGM 2000 with the
following modifications to their plan – Niru and Aandeappan, another veteran
member, decided not to contest the elections. There was otherwise no change to
the original plan. At the AGM 2000, they were voted into the MC.

75\. Very soon after the July 2000 elections, Amallathasan realized that
Theyvendran was high-handed, arrogant and dictatorial as shown by his
convening of the MC meeting immediately after the AGM and his unilateral
appointment of the National Day Committee. Amallathasan then decided to have a
word with Theyvendran. He gave him a call to fix an appointment to talk things
over but Theyvendran was rather curt, asking whether he wanted to discuss the
Niru issue and how many members were attending the discussions. Amallathasan
then got in touch with all the Vice Presidents and the representatives of the
affiliates to arrange a meeting with Theyvendran with the object of discussing
the proper running of TRC and the issue concerning Niru joining the MC. The
Plaintiff was among the group.

76\. Theyvendran’s response on the Niru issue was that "top people" did not
like Niru. He told them that they should leave the matter to him as he was
confident of resolving the issue in 6 months. Amallathasan was not satisfied
with this answer and asked who the "top people" were. Theyvendran was very
unhappy with this and was not inclined to discuss the matter further. He left
the meeting midway, leaving Moganaruban to continue with the meeting.
Moganaruban reiterated that the issue should be resolved in six months’ time
and that if it was not, he was willing to resign to make way for Niru to be
made Deputy President.

77\. At the MC meetings that followed, Amallathasan and the Plaintiff had
repeated and heated arguments with Theyvendran over the Co-operative and the
Niru issues with the Plaintiff being very vocal. They felt that Niru could
exercise influence and had the necessary contacts and should therefore be
brought into the MC to provide leadership according to the understanding they
all had before the elections. Theyvendran was very agitated over the questions
and was particularly agitated by the Plaintiff who was very vocal on those two
issues. There were also heated exchanges between Amallathasan and the
President over the latter’s alleged dictatorial style of leadership. At one
meeting, Amallathasan mentioned that the President was always a difficult
person to discuss things with and the latter responded by standing up,
proposing that he take over the job and then leaving the meeting in a huff
with Moganaruban.

78\. The rest of his evidence related to the correspondence with Chandra Das,
the issue about the minutes of meetings and the events leading to the fateful
day of 1 March 2001. He alleged that the Plaintiff spoke for about two minutes
only before he was told he had exceeded the time limit in the Standing Orders.
When he asked for the minutes of the previous meeting, Moganaruban would only
allow the minutes to be read out even though he was holding a copy thereof.
When Amallathasan and several other MC members asked that the minutes be
circulated, Moganaruban proposed that the question whether they should be
circulated be put to a vote. Feeling this was "an ultimate disgrace",
Amallathasan walked out of the meeting, followed by the Plaintiff and a few
others. In spite of the verbal clashes he had with the President, Amallathasan
did not face disciplinary action by the MC.

79\. Niru, an advocate and solicitor since 1978, testified that he was
actively involved in Indian organizations for more than two decades. He was
and remains very passionate about promoting Tamil interests in Singapore,
particularly in language, culture and education. He is a life member of the
TRC and was consulted regularly by the leaders of the affiliated
organizations. He also worked very closely with Chandra Das in his
parliamentary constituency for more than ten years while the latter was a
Member of Parliament. He became acquainted with the Plaintiff while organizing
the 1995 Tamil Language Week. From the first time Niru met him, he found the
Plaintiff "a forthright, down to earth and honest to goodness character"
although the Plaintiff came from a humble background.

80\. Niru also testified about the tumultuous recent history of the TRC,
stating that the present General Secretary, Pandiyan, had been secretary to
Kesavan as well and that by 1998, there were several complaints against
Pandiyan who "had worked in concert with Kesavan". The interim committee in
1999 relied on Niru to seek guidance and advice from Chandra Das, a senior
advisor of the TRC. Theyvendran was also particularly keen to participate in
the discussions with the senior advisor. He even relied on Niru to vet all his
letters to Chandra Das. Niru met Chandra Das on many occasions to try to
resolve the problems in the TRC. On 31 January 2000, Chandra Das wrote to Niru
and Theyvendran to state that the advisors had decided to set up a fresh
interim committee for the TRC comprising respectable persons who had not been
involved in the ongoing dispute and that it would take over the management of
the TRC with effect from 1 February 2000.

81\. Chandra Das suggested that Kesavan, Theyvendran and Niru should not stand
for election in order to avoid a factional dispute. Niru agreed and accepted
his advice. Niru assisted the new interim committee to find a solution to the
problems but did not participate actively in the TRC while Theyvendran
continued to take an aggressive position against Kesavan.

82\. The interim committee reported later that fresh elections should be held.
It reconvened the AGM. During this time, Niru was in London for a long period
of time. Theyvendran contacted him and asked if they were going to stick to
their plan to re-contest the elections. Niru replied that he would abide by
the advice of Chandra Das and advised Theyvendran to do the same. However,
Theyvendran said he had been given the go-ahead.

83\. When Niru returned to Singapore on 8 July 2000, he found out from Chandra
Das that neither Theyvendran nor Kesavan had been advised by him that they
could re-contest the elections. In his letter to Chandra Das dated 21 July
2000, Niru mentioned that "It appears that I am the only one (of the three
persons) who is abiding by your advice that we should not stand for office at
the forthcoming TRC elections".

84\. At the 23 July 2000 AGM, Theyvendran was elected President. Moganaruban,
a relatively unknown candidate, was nominated and supported for the post of
Deputy President because of Theyvendran’s request. Consistent with the
agreement reached earlier, Niru thought Theyvendran would ask him to serve in
the MC and play a leadership role as previously envisaged. He was keen that
the goals and aspirations spelt out in the "New Directions" report of the TRC
21 Committee be implemented. That report was in fact the manifesto of
Theyvendran’s team at the 1999 elections. Until he was co-opted, Niru did not
see it appropriate to exercise any further influence in the MC. He felt that
the MC should be given time to settle down.

85\. It soon dawned on Niru from feedback received from some of the members of
the MC that Theyvendran was in fact intent upon preventing him from joining
the MC or being given any leadership role. Further, instead of concentrating
on the Co-operative, he began to run the MC in an autocratic way and was
supported staunchly in this by Moganaruban. When consulted by some of the
leaders, Niru advised them to deal with matters amicably so as not to disrupt
the TRC. Those MC members were however unable to get Theyvendran committed to
what he had promised. There were repeated disputes and this caused Niru a lot
of concern, especially when one of the issues was about him joining the MC.
When some of the MC members sought his advice about approaching Chandra Das to
resolve the issue about him joining the MC, he felt that it would be
inappropriate for him to do so as he was not part of the MC. He suggested
instead that they ascertain from Chandra Das his position since "Theyvendran
had used his name in vain". He felt that the MC members should be guided by
Chandra Das’ advice.

86\. Niru concluded by saying that Theyvendran had not observed the spirit of
the "New Directions", had reneged on his pre-election agreement made in 1999
and had begun to run the TRC with a heavy hand. He felt exceedingly
disappointed by the turn of events as both he and Theyvendran could have
worked together and made substantial contribution to the TRC.

87\. Niru acknowledged that he helped the Plaintiff fund the costs of the
present proceedings by giving him a loan of $50,000 for the court fees. He
said he had helped others in the same way before. Where the conduct of the
case was concerned, he left everything in the hands of his partner in the law
firm, Mr Liew Teck Huat.

88\. Naa Aandeappan, a life member of the TRC and the Deputy Head of Tamil
News in Mediacorp News Pte Ltd, said he had been involved in Tamil community
work for several years. He too gave the recent history of the TRC, how the
present team got together and the pre-election understanding concerning the
roles of Theyvendran and Niru in the MC should the team be elected to office.
He also testified about the tumultuous events in 1999 when the interim
committee had to be formed after the Kesavan faction walked out of the AGM.
He, together with Amallathasan, Theyvendran and Moganaruban, was appointed to
be a member in the 17-member interim committee. Niru declined to be a member
of the interim committee as he was not holding any office in the Indian
organizations at that time. However, they consulted Niru regularly on various
matters. On behalf of the interim committee, Niru held discussions with
Chandra Das to find a way forward for the TRC.

89\. The interim committee held meetings to deal with the various issues and
Niru was invited as a guest at some of these meetings to give his views and
guidance. At these meetings, the previous arrangement that Theyvendran was
only interested in managing the Co-operative was affirmed.

90\. After the new interim committee was set up by the advisors of the TRC,
the team continued to prepare for the 2000 AGM but Niru and Aandeappan decided
not to contest the elections. Other than that, there was no change in the
original plan.

91\. After Theyvendran was elected President, he reneged on the agreement and
completely sidestepped the issue of Niru joining the MC. He also refused to
endorse the plans painstakingly conceived and put in place in the report "New
Directions" which was printed by Theyvendran’s printing company and
distributed to the members of the TRC by the Plaintiff and others. Even when
they were in the interim committee, Theyvendran, the Chairman of the interim
committee, would ask Aandeappan, who prepared the minutes of the meetings, to
send the minutes to him first before they were sent to Jayakodi, who chaired
the meetings, claiming that he wanted to ensure accuracy in the minutes. As an
illustration, Aandeappan referred to the meeting held on 31 October 1999.
There, the discussions were somewhat controversial because they involved
rather sharp personal exchanges between two members. Aandeappan omitted those
exchanges in the minutes as they had no relevance to the TRC. However,
Theyvendran made substantial amendments to the minutes and wanted the
exchanges recorded. After making the amendments, he would ask Aandeappan to
send the minutes to Moganaruban as well and the latter would then revert with
his comments. Aandeappan was left in a dilemma. He knew it was improper for
any committee member to dictate to him on how to prepare the minutes. However,
because of Theyvendran’s insistence, he did not refuse him.

92\. When Niru declined to stand for elections at the 2000 AGM, Aandeappan was
invited to stand for the office of General Secretary. However, he declined as
he could not accept the way Theyvendran and Moganaruban treated him while they
were members of the interim committee, in particular, their insistence on
vetting the minutes and dictating the contents. Further, he saw from the
autocratic way in which they conducted meetings of the interim committee what
was looming ahead and he wanted no part of it.

**

The Defendants’ Case

**93\. Theyvendran, a businessman, explained that as the months leading to the
23 July 2000 elections had been very turbulent ones, he was anxious that the
TRC move forward. There was much to be done and he held the first MC meeting
the same day after the elections.

94\. However, during the subsequent MC meetings, the Plaintiff "behaved in an
extremely rude, boisterous, disrespectful and disruptive manner". He would be
"arrogant and disrespectful" to the chairperson and would insist on his views
being adopted. Meetings which could have concluded within an hour would go
past ten o’clock while the Plaintiff made "long meandering speeches". He would
repeatedly raised the issue of bringing Niru into the MC as a key office
bearer, particularly as Deputy President in place of Moganaruban, the duly
elected holder of that office. The Plaintiff ignored the decisions of the MC
that this issue should not be discussed further. He cast aspersions and
challenged the credibility of the chairperson, hampering the progress of MC
meetings, some of which ended abruptly, and affecting the morale of many MC
members.

95\. At the MC meeting on 14 September 2000, which was a special meeting held
essentially to discuss the National Day Dinner that had been organized, the
Plaintiff and several others insisted that Niru be brought into the MC inspite
of the President and others telling them that was not possible and the
President telling the Plaintiff that, given the past problems of the TRC,
Chandra Das had advised that Niru be considered for the position of legal
advisor. In order to permit the meeting to carry on, it was agreed that the
issue of the appointment of Niru be deferred for six months. The Plaintiff
eventually agreed to a deferment of four months. The meeting then considered
other matters. Towards the end of the meeting, the Plaintiff again raised the
same issue and insisted that a decision be made. He did not accept what the
President had said was the advice of the TRC’s advisor and basically held the
President out to be a dishonest person. In a rude and loud manner, he insisted
that Chandra Das be contacted to find out his views. Almost the entire MC was
against this course of action. The Plaintiff was shouting most of the time. He
banged the table aggressively and pointed his finger at the President in a
menacing manner. As a result of his behaviour, the President told him he
should resign. The President then left the meeting and the Deputy President
took over the chair.

96\. A notice of the next MC meeting scheduled for 28 September 2000 was sent
out on 22 September 2000. However, most of the MC members were fed up and did
not wish to attend the meeting and it became obvious that the requisite quorum
would not be achieved. That meeting was cancelled. The members were persuaded
to turn up for the next meeting to be held on 5 October 2000. The President
was overseas on that date but felt that the meeting should go on.

97\. On 3 October 2000, the President wrote to Chandra Das to inform him that
some MC members wanted Niru to be involved in the MC inspite of his advice
that Niru be appointed legal advisor. He recalled meeting Chandra Das at
Chennai before the 2000 AGM and the advisor informing him that the new
thinking was that anyone was free to contest the elections. He also recalled
how he and others then tried in vain to contact Niru on the people who should
be the officials and that neither he nor Niru wanted to become the President
of the TRC. Eventually, as Niru could not be reached and no one else was
interested in assuming the presidency, everyone unanimously decided that
Theyvendran should stand for election to that office. Theyvendran went to say
in his letter that there was never any intention to let down Niru and that he
could still have the presidency. He recalled that after Niru’s name was raised
at one MC meeting, Chandra Das advised that Niru should be the legal advisor.
Theyvendran also stated that he offered his resignation as President "to
graciously hand over so that the interest of the Indian community is
preserved" and that he had requested the MC to decide whether Niru or any
other person could take over from him immediately or at the next AGM. He then
asked Chandra Das to confirm his earlier advice that Niru was best suited to
be legal advisor so that the matter could be resolved.

98\. At the 5 October 2000 meeting, the Niru issue was discussed again. After
discussions, the following resolution, accepted by everyone present including
the Plaintiff, was passed:

> > "The officially elected Management Committee shall continue to remain in
> power for the entire term of office. Any change in the MC shall take place
> in accordance with the Constitution of the TRC".

99\. On 9 October 2000, Chandra Das replied to Theyvendran, saying:

> > "You have been elected at the AGM as President and as such you have a
> responsibility to carry out your duties until the next AGM. However, if you
> wish to resign for whatever reason, it is your decision.
>>

>> As for Niru he is not an elected member of the committee. My earlier advice
of using him as legal adviser still stands."

100\. On 14 November 2000, Theyvendran received another letter from Chandra
Das, the text of which has already been set out at paragraph 40 above.
Theyvendran was not aware that six MC members had written to the advisor of
the TRC. At the MC meeting held that same day, the letters from Chandra Das
were distributed to the members. As Theyvendran’s integrity had been made an
issue in this matter, he left the meeting when this matter was to be
discussed. He was told that the Plaintiff held the view nevertheless that the
letter established that the MC had the power to bring Niru into the MC and was
again extremely disruptive. Eventually the resolution spelt out at paragraph
39 above was passed by the MC with only the Plaintiff and Amallathasan
registering their objections.

101\. At the MC meeting held on 30 January 2001, the Plaintiff again raised
the Niru issue and wanted the resolution of 14 November 2000 removed from the
minutes. Towards the end of the meeting, he challenged the President and asked
him to apologize to him over the incident concerning the signing of blank
receipts. The meeting descended into chaos and came to an abrupt end with the
majority of the members walking out.

102\. Theyvendran did not attend the 15 February 2001 meeting which was
chaired by Moganaruban. As the chairperson had proceeded wrongly in applying
rule 18.1 of the constitution, it was decided that the issue of the
Plaintiff’s removal from office be dealt with by a full MC meeting convened
specially to consider that matter and that the Plaintiff be asked to show
cause in writing. Theyvendran then referred to rule 13.3 of the constitution
which reads:

> > "The MC shall be empowered after due inquiry to remove from office or to
> expel a member who in its opinion has been guilty of injuring or attempting
> to injure, the Council or of acting contrary to its interest".

103\. At the special meeting held on 1 March 2001 chaired by Moganaruban, it
was unanimously resolved that the Standing Orders attached to the Notice of
Meeting dated 19 February 2001 be adopted. The General Secretary clarified
that all present were either elected MC members or representatives of the
affiliate organizations, except for Jalaludin who was an observer. It was also
agreed by a majority of 34 against six that as the minutes of the 15 February
2001 meeting were not ready, the minutes would be read out only. The
Plaintiff’s letter of 20 February 2001 was read out and interpreted in Tamil.
The Plaintiff was allowed to address the meeting but spoke well beyond the
time limit specified in the Standing Orders. Upon completing his speech, he
walked out of the meeting together with four others, including Amallathasan
and Aandeappan. A secret ballot was then conducted by the two appointed
scrutineers and the result was 32 in favour of the motion to remove the
Plaintiff from office and 2 opposing the motion.

104\. It was originally the Defendants’ case that the following letter dated 5
March 2001 was then sent by the General Secretary to the Plaintiff :

> > "**EXPULSION FROM TRC MANAGEMENT COUNCIL**
>>

>> The TRC Management Council at its special meeting on 1.3.2001 conveyed for
the purposes of your misconduct has by a two-third majority voted to expel you
from the Management Council.

>>

>> In accordance with TRC Constitution (18.1), you are hereby given notice
that with effect from 1.3.2001 you are hereby expelled from the TRC Management
Council. However you have the right to appeal to the next Annual General
Meeting.

>>

>> We thank you for your past contributions and support.

>>

>> (signed)

>>

>> Pandiyan Vellasami

>>

>> General Secretary

>>

>> (on behalf of the TRC MC)

>>

>> cc Mr K Shanmugam Advisor, TRC

>>

>> Mr R Sinnakaruppan Advisor, TRC

>>

>> Mr R Ravindran Advisor, TRC

>>

>> Mr S Chandra Das Advisor, TRC

>>

>> Mr R Theyvendran President, TRC

>>

>> Mr Moganaruben Deputy President".

105\. However, the Defendants conceded during the cross-examination of the
Plaintiff that he was correct in stating that what he received was a letter
dated 7 March 2001 in the following terms:

> > "**EXPULSION FROM TRC MANAGEMENT COUNCIL**
>>

>> The TRC Management Council at its special meeting held on 1st March 2001
conveyed for the purposes of your misconduct and after hearing your
explanation and your subsequent walkout, decided by a two-third majority to
expel you from the Management Council.

>>

>> In accordance with TRC Constitution (18.1), you are hereby given notice
that with effect from 1st March 2001 you are hereby expelled from the TRC
Management Council.

>>

>> (signed)

>>

>> Pandiyan Vellasami

>>

>> General Secretary".

106\. After his expulsion in March 2001, the Plaintiff made no objection or
complaint about the MC’s decision until his letter of 19 November 2001 to
which the TRC responded, through the General Secretary, by its letter dated 27
November 2001 setting out the following:

> > "1. The report sent out to all members is for the year ended 31.12.2000.
> As such the report reflects the activities for the year 2000. As the matter
> you are referring to occurred in March 2001 it will be reflected in the next
> annual report.
>>

>> 2\. At the Management Council meeting held on 15.2.2001 the Chairperson
brought charges against you and a vote was taken. It has to be noted that
majority of the members present voted in support of the motion. As this was a
monthly meeting a decision was taken to hold a special meeting and that you
should also be given an opportunity to refute the charges against you. This
decision was agreed upon by all members present at the meeting.

>>

>> 3\. At the special meeting called on 1.3.2001 your reply was read out and
even interpreted in Tamil for the benefit of all members and representatives
present. You were given ample time to air your views and refute the charges
brought by the Management Council against you.

>>

>> 4\. At the end of the proceedings a secret vote was taken and the motion to
expell you from the post of Deputy General Secretary was passed. It has to be
noted that 5 members including you had walked out of the meeting without the
expressed permission of the Chairperson. This again showed your disrespect for
the Management Council and the Chairperson.

>>

>> 5\. The decision of the Management Council was conveyed to you by
registered post on 7.3.2001. It is also to be noted that after receiving
notice of you being expelled you had not challenged that decision. The
decision by the Management Council to expell you on 1.3.2001 stands.

>>

>> Thank You."

107\. On 30 November 2001, two days before the AGM scheduled to be held on 2
December 2001, the Plaintiff’s solicitors sent a letter of demand in respect
of the alleged libel and set the deadline for a response at 12 noon, 1
December 2001. The Defendants were naturally unable to respond within that
time frame and on 1 December 2001, the TRC was served a writ of summons for
alleged wrongful expulsion from office. No claim for libel was made and the
General Secretary was not made a Defendant at that time although he had also
received a letter of demand. It was only on 15 May 2002, almost six months
later, that the writ of summons was amended to include him as a Defendant and
to add a claim for libel. The Plaintiff knew that the General Secretary sent
correspondence in his capacity as such and with the approval of the MC.
Although the preparation and the issuance of the Annual Report was the act of
the MC and was approved unanimously by the MC, the Plaintiff sued only the
General Secretary. He alleged that the Plaintiff was not sincere and that his
legal action was not to seek redress but to embarrass the Defendants.

108\. Theyvendran went on to assert that the MC acted in good faith and with
propriety. He alleged that the Plaintiff’s action was motivated by spite and
that the timing of the writ of summons was calculated to threaten and
intimidate the TRC. He said that rules 18 and 23 of the constitution allowed
the Plaintiff to seek redress by convening a General Meeting but he had chosen
instead to commence legal proceedings. At the last AGM and elections held on 9
June 2002, the Plaintiff did not stand for elections and neither was he
nominated by anyone as a candidate. Despite the personal attacks directed
against Theyvendran, the President carried only one vote in the MC meeting of
1 March 2001 which removed the Plaintiff from office by an overwhelming
majority. He denied that he and the MC had been autocratic. He also claimed
that he never undertook that on being elected, he would ensure that Niru be
given a leadership role. Niru could have stood for elections for the office of
President or any other position that he sought and there was no need for
Theyvendran to give any such undertakings.

109\. The Deputy President informed him that the reliance on rule 18.1 of the
constitution at the 15 February 2001 meeting was misplaced and that the MC
never proceeded to remove the Plaintiff from office. Instead, the MC then
instituted a fair procedure to deal with the removal. Rule 13.3 conferred
express powers on the MC to remove one of its members.

110\. He claimed that he thumped the table at the meeting to emphasize a point
and was not banging the table in anger. He had his own successful business and
did not need to take up the presidency for personal glory.

111\. Where the Peravai was concerned, that was the official newsletter of the
TRC and was distributed to its members. The last publication permit was for
the period 24 October 2000 to 23 October 2001. There was great enthusiasm to
publish the 2002 issue and due to an administrative oversight, the permit was
not renewed. The outgoing editor resigned sometime in October 2001 and no one
attended to the renewal of the permit. Since the expiry of the permit on 23
October 2001, only one issue was published and that was the January 2002 issue
complained of. Various MC members, including Theyvendran, helped in the
preparation of that issue. It was printed by Stamford Press (Pte) Ltd. A new
permit for the period 20 June 2002 to 19 June 2003 has been taken out and the
General Secretary is the editor with effect from 20 June 2002.

112\. At the AGM on 2 December 2001, the matter of the Plaintiff’s removal
from office was discussed and the minutes of that meeting showed that the
members were informed and knew that he had been removed from his position as
Deputy General Secretary and not as a member of the TRC and that the legal
action was in respect of his expulsion from that office. The January 2002
article was also clear as to its meaning that the Plaintiff was removed from
that office. The 1 March 2001 MC meeting was attended by 40 MC members, many
of whom represented the affiliated organizations and they all knew the facts.
The rest of the article complained of was true and correct. The Defendants’
solicitors, in their letter of 7 June 2002, offered in any event to clarify
this matter at the 2002 AGM but the Plaintiff’s solicitors remarked that the
Plaintiff needed no clarification. At the AGM on 9 June 2002, Theyvendran made
the clarification anyway.

113\. Pandiyan Vellasami, the General Secretary and an administrator working
in the Subordinate Courts, testified that he was present at all the MC
meetings in question and confirmed that the Plaintiff’s conduct was
disrespectful and disruptive. He said the charges in the show cause letter of
16 February 2001 were justified. At the MC meeting of 14 September 2000 the
Plaintiff acknowledged to the MC that his conduct was unbecoming by
apologizing. At the subsequent meeting of 5 October 2000, he again
acknowledged that he should not have spoken in the manner he did on 14
September 2000 but he became disruptive again nonetheless that day, warning
the MC that an "earthquake is on the way". At the 14 November 2000 meeting,
notwithstanding the earlier resolution on the Niru issue and the views of many
MC members that Chandra Das’ reply was clear on the issue, the Plaintiff again
argued that the said letter established that the MC had the power to bring
Niru into the MC.

114\. Pandiyan prepared or vetted the minutes of MC meetings. He confirmed
that the minutes were a correct reflection of the events that transpired
although they did not record every detail. Drafts were prepared and then
amended before they were finalized and approved. He could not explain how the
Plaintiff came to have a different version of the minutes for the 5 October
2000 meeting. The TRC office in Peace Centre was open to members and the
Plaintiff was an office holder at the material time anyway. Pandiyan conceded
that the correct version of the 30 January 2001 minutes was the one set out in
the Plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence in chief. A copy of an earlier draft had
been given by mistake during discovery. As for the letter containing the
charges, he first drafted a letter containing only four charges. The draft was
amended by the President to include what appeared as the fourth charge in the
16 February 2001 show cause letter to the Plaintiff. On the day of the special
MC meeting, thinking that some members might forget to bring the show cause
letter, he decided to print copies of the 16 February 2001 letter from the
computer file but unfortunately retrieved the original draft containing only
four charges. The auto-date feature in his computer automatically dated the
letter as 1 March 2001. In respect of the letter informing the Plaintiff about
his expulsion from the MC, again there were different drafts done. When
discovery of documents took place, the TRC provided an earlier draft to its
solicitors.

115\. Moganaruban, a businessman and the Deputy President of the TRC,
testified that he was present at the relevant MC meetings and confirmed that
the Plaintiff was indeed disrespectful and disruptive at those meetings. He
also felt that the charges preferred against the Plaintiff in the show cause
letter of 16 February 2001 were justified.

116\. On 14 September 2000, after Theyvendran left the meeting, Moganaruban
chaired the rest of the session. The Plaintiff apologized for his behaviour
that evening. The meeting ended with everyone (including the Plaintiff)
agreeing that the MC’s earlier decision on the Niru issue should stand.

117\. The 5 October 2000 meeting was chaired by Moganaruban. He confirmed that
the resolution stated in paragraph 98 above was passed by the MC. The
Plaintiff’s behaviour at that meeting was again objectionable. In spite of the
earlier decision made by the MC, he again made long speeches to try to
persuade the members to appoint Niru to the MC, addressing the members for as
long as half an hour at times. The majority of the MC wanted an end to this
and hence the said resolution was passed by all present, including the
Plaintiff. Moganaruban concluded the session with the words, "no further
discussion will be entertained from now on this issue and the proposed
appointment of Mr Nirumalan Pillay as Legal Adviser shall be discussed
sometime in February 2001". The Plaintiff nevertheless ended by making the
threat, "it looks like an earthquake is on the way".

118\. For the 14 November 2000 meeting, Moganaruban was the chairperson of the
second half of the meeting. The letter from Chandra Das was distributed to
everyone present and almost everybody took the view that the letter clearly
showed his advice was that Niru be the legal advisor. The Plaintiff, however,
was of the opinion that the letter gave the MC the power to appoint Niru as an
office bearer in the MC. He was insistent and repetitious in his views and
would interrupt others and refuse to sit down. That led to the passing of the
resolution that no further discussion on the Niru issue would be permitted
(see paragraph 39 above), with only the Plaintiff and Amallathasan opposing.

119\. After the 30 January 2001 MC meeting, many MC members told Moganaruban
that they did not wish to attend any more meetings because of the way the
Plaintiff was behaving. Someone suggested that Standing Orders be introduced
for better control of the proceedings at meetings. When the agenda for the 15
February 2001 meeting was sent out, that meeting was supposed to be one of the
regular monthly sessions. However, Moganaruban decided that the 15 February
2001 meeting should be used to resolve the problems plaguing the MC. He
therefore decided that the MC should discuss only item 1 listed in the agenda
and not be distracted by other matters.

120\. It was agreed that Moganaruban would chair the meeting, that the minutes
of the previous meeting would not be distributed as only item 1 was to be
discussed and that Standing Orders be adopted. He sought the views of the
members on how to find a solution for the discord at MC meetings. Most of the
members were of the view that the Plaintiff was the problem. After lengthy
discussions, Moganaruban asked the Plaintiff to resign for the good of the
TRC. The Plaintiff refused to do so. He was extremely arrogant and spoke at
length about how he had done no wrong. He asked the Deputy President what
wrong he had done and was told it was set out in the minutes of the previous
meetings.

121\. Feeling that the meeting was carrying on without any purpose and to
bring finality to the issue. Moganaruban decided to proceed under rule 18.1 of
the Constitution. A majority of the members voted in favour of charging the
Plaintiff with:

> "(Plaintiff) had not had cordial relations with the President.
>
> Had misbehaved at MC meetings (banged table, raised his voice, repeatedly
> brought the meeting to disrepute).
>
> Had shown disrespect to the Chair".

122\. A majority also voted in favour of removing the Plaintiff from office.
At this juncture, the General Secretary informed Moganaruban that rule 18.1 of
the Constitution provided that the Plaintiff be given an opportunity to
respond in writing and that at least two-thirds of the MC must vote in favour
of removal. Moganaruban realized it would be wrong to proceed any further. As
he had proceeded wrongly under rule 18.1, it was decided that the issue
concerning the Plaintiff’s removal from office should be dealt with by a full
MC meeting convened specially for that purpose and that the Plaintiff show
cause in writing. The Plaintiff did not object to this course of action.

123\. On 1 March 2001, Moganaruban was again the Chairperson. The Standing
Orders were adopted and the Plaintiff’s letter dated 20 February 2001 was read
out and interpreted in Tamil. The Plaintiff addressed the MC but spoke well
beyond the time limit stipulated in the Standing Orders. He also interrupted
other speakers repeatedly. After completing his submissions, he walked out of
the meeting with four other MC members. The secret ballot was then conducted
by the two scrutineers. The result of the ballot showed 32 in favour of the
motion to remove the Plaintiff from office and 2 against.

124\. Where the Plaintiff’s claims in defamation were concerned, Moganaruban
said the minutes of the AGM held on 2 December 2001 were prepared and sent to
the members of the TRC for the purpose of the AGM 2002 to be held on 9 June
2002. A 67-page booklet entitled "2002 Tamil Representative Council Annual
Report, Accounts, Annual General Meeting, Sunday 9 June 2002" was sent to all
TRC members. Ten pages of this booklet set out the minutes of the AGM 2001
which were not circulated separately to the members. The minutes of the AGM
2001 were recorded by a Deputy General Secretary, vetted by the General
Secretary and then approved by the President. The preparation of the Annual
Report was approved by the MC. Moganaruban did not draft the minutes nor
arrange the printing of the Annual Report. He participated and spoke at the
AGM 2001 as the Deputy President and a member of the MC when the issue of the
Plaintiff’s removal from office came up for discussion and after other members
of the MC had already spoken on it. By then, the members of the TRC were aware
that the Plaintiff had commenced legal action against the TRC in respect of
his removal from the office of Deputy General Secretary. They were also aware
that the Plaintiff could have appealed to the AGM against his removal but did
not do so and that the TRC received a letter of demand on 30 November 2001 and
was served with the writ of summons the next day.

125\. Moganaruban claimed that the remarks in issue were made by him as an
officer of the MC and he was informing the members and responding to the
members’ questions. He could not recall his exact words but accepted that the
substance of the ordinary meaning of the words recorded in the minutes was
correct. He did tell the members that the objective of the Plaintiff’s legal
action was to threaten the TRC. He remained silent for about nine months about
his removal from office and timed the commencement of his legal action to fall
on the eve of the AGM.

126\. Moganaruban reiterated that the TRC was a representative body and that
the decision leading to the Plaintiff’s removal from office was a collective
one made by the TRC MC and the 26 affiliated organizations. Where his remarks
at paragraph 8.18 of the minutes for the AGM 2001 were concerned, he made them
in response to the preceding speaker who asked that an EOGM be convened to
resolve the issue. He did not think the TRC should incur cost and spend time
on an EOGM about a matter that had been decided by the MC. After all, the
Plaintiff could have called for an EOGM but chose not to do so. Moganaruban
asserted that what he said at the AGM 2001 was true and correct and was borne
out by the facts. The Plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of 12 June 2002 asking
him to state if he was responsible for the preparation, writing and/or
publication of the words in issue set a two-day deadline for his response. It
was sent not to his residential address but to the TRC’s registered address.
By the time the letter was sent to him, he was overseas. When he managed to
speak with his solicitors about the matter, the Plaintiff had already
instituted the legal proceedings. His failure to respond could not therefore
be construed as an admission of responsibility on his part.

**

THE DECISION OF THE COURT

**

127\. The function of the court in relation to the proceedings of clubs and
societies like the TRC is a supervisory one and is confined to the examination
of the decision making process, that is whether the rules of natural justice
have been observed and whether the decision has been honestly reached. Its
function is not to review the evidence and the correctness of the decision
itself (_Singapore Amateur Athletic Association v Haron bin Mundir_ [1994] 1
SLR 47).

128\. As the Defendants have acknowledged that the Plaintiff’s removal from
office should not have come under rule 18.1 of the TRC Constitution (which
deals with expulsion from the TRC and not the MC), there was no question of
the Plaintiff not having exercised his right of appeal to the next AGM
pursuant to that rule. It was agreed that the applicable rule should have been
rule 13.3 which provides:

> "The Management Council shall be empowered after due inquiry to remove from
> office any officer or to expel a member who in its opinion has been guilty
> of injuring or attempting to injure the Council or of acting contrary to its
> interests".

Rule 13.3 would in fact have given the MC a much simpler and swifter expulsion
procedure. The subject would not have a right to exculpate himself in writing.
Further, the MC would not need a two-thirds majority vote in order to expel
the subject. A majority verdict would suffice. The words "prejudicial or
contrary to the interest of the Council" (that is, the TRC) in rule 18.1 and
the words "injuring or attempting to injure the Council or of acting contrary
to its interests" in rule 13.3 are really not different in meaning in
substance. The Plaintiff therefore had the benefit of a procedure which was
more onerous for the MC and more advantageous for him. The only claim he could
make was one of error as to form, not substance. It resulted in absolutely no
prejudice to him and it appeared that he was not misled in any way, for
example by appealing to the wrong body in respect of his expulsion. It was
also clear that the MC had the power to expel him from office and that it was
removing him from office and was not purporting to expel him as a member of
the TRC altogether.

129\. The Plaintiff was not subject to a double jeopardy in that he was tried
twice on the same allegations. The Deputy President was advised, wrongly as it
turned out, at the 15 February 2001 proceedings that the MC ought to have
given the Plaintiff a chance to exculpate himself in writing. Proper charges
were formulated. He was given a chance to show cause in writing. A full MC was
convened on 1 March 2001 and he was given a chance to show cause orally. The
concluding words in the 16 February 2001 show cause letter to him merely
repeated the opening words of rule 18.1 and were not evidence of pre-judgment.
The charges still had to be established and considered sufficient by the MC to
attract expulsion. The 15 February 2001 proceedings were considered then to be
wrong and the MC therefore effectively took the view that they were null and
void and commenced fresh proceedings according to the understanding prevailing
at that time. If the 15 February 2001 proceedings were valid, as the Plaintiff
appeared to be contending, then he was properly expelled at the earlier
meeting anyway.

130\. There is a further provision in the TRC Constitution that is of
relevance here. Rule 23.1 provides:

> "**DISPUTES**
>
> In the event of any dispute arising amongst members, they shall attempt to
> resolve the matter at an Extraordinary General Meeting in accordance with
> the rules in the Constitution. Should the members fail to resolve the
> matter, they may bring the matter to a court of law for settlement".

Undoubtedly, the Plaintiff had a "dispute" with at least some members. The
Plaintiff was entitled to call for an EOGM within the terms of rule 10 of the
TRC Constitution. He made no attempt at all to do so. The internal remedy
provided by rule 23.1 does not oust the jurisdiction of the courts. It is in
fact a salutary rule as it discourages resort to litigation as the first
option. In _Chiam See Tong v Singapore Democratic Party_ [1994] 1 SLR 278, it
was held that the plaintiff there did not have to exhaust all domestic
remedies as any appeal would have to be made to the next party conference
which was two years away. In the meantime, the plaintiff’s seat in Parliament
would have been affected by the long wait. The domestic remedy clause in that
case, unlike the one here, was merely a permissive one in any event. In the
present case, the Plaintiff’s office was essentially a voluntary service to
the Tamil community. His livelihood was not affected in any way by the
expulsion from office. He took no action and appeared to have accepted his
expulsion between 1 March 2001 and his 19 November 2001 letter of demand. If
he was serious about his office, there was ample time and opportunity for him
to move for an EOGM. He ought to have done so before commencing his court
actions.

131\. The Plaintiff questioned the eligibility of certain persons to attend or
vote at the 1 March 2001 special MC meeting. The minutes of that meeting
indicated that care was taken to ensure that only persons eligible to attend
the meeting were present. Jalaludin was excluded by the MC from voting
although he represented an affiliated organization because he had not been
registered. He was appointed a scrutineer without objection. Krishnasamy had
resigned as an Internal Auditor at an earlier MC meeting but was entitled to
be present and to vote as he remained a representative of an affiliated
organization. The Plaintiff alleged his purported resignation as Internal
Auditor was a manipulative step designed to allow him to vote as the TRC
Constitution did not allow a member of the MC to be an Internal Auditor. His
letter of resignation was not in the records of the TRC and a copy was said to
have been retrieved from Krishnasamy’s computer only during the course of the
trial. However, it was signed. Even if he was not entitled to vote and his
vote, assuming he did vote to expel the Plaintiff, was excluded, there would
still have been more than a two-thirds majority. He also attended the 15
February 2001 meeting as such a representative without objection from the
Plaintiff or any other person. Two ladies were present by virtue of their
positions in the Women’s League. The Plaintiff also suggested that the meeting
had been "loaded" with people who were either related to or were employed by
the President and the Deputy President. I see no merit in this submission if
they were eligible to attend and to vote. Would the Plaintiff likewise
disqualify his friends and allies from voting in his favour?

132\. The 1 March 2001 meeting was called as a special disciplinary meeting to
deal with the case against the Plaintiff. The members accepted the decision
not to circulate the minutes of the 15 February 2001 meeting which were read
out in any event. In any case, the absence of the said minutes did not place
the Plaintiff at a disadvantage in his defence at the 1 March 2001 meeting. I
do not see the failure to produce written minutes as evidencing bad faith. The
Plaintiff also said the minutes of the previous meetings did not show that he
was constantly rehashing the Niru issue but that he was merely responding to
the chairperson who had raised the issue. Minutes vary in their details
according to the recorder and the person who approves them. I am satisfied
from the evidence of the Defendants and from the motions passed at the
meetings that it was the Plaintiff who constantly sought to re-open the Niru
issue with increasing vehemence and rudeness as time passed.

133\. The apparent speed at which the special meeting was convened so soon
after the 15 February 2001 one was again no evidence of bad faith. The MC
needed to find a quick solution to the internal problems plaguing and
paralyzing it in its functions. The Plaintiff did not say he did not have
sufficient time to prepare his written defence. Indeed, he managed to submit
it two days before the stipulated deadline. There was also no requirement that
the notice convening the special meeting should be sent out only after receipt
of the Plaintiff’s response.

134\. Standing Orders were within the province of the MC to make for the
orderly conduct of meetings. Indeed, they would not have been necessary at all
if members could exercise restraint and show courtesy to one another and in
particular to the person chairing meetings. As things turned out, they became
necessary because of the behaviour of some members of the MC. Nevertheless,
the Standing Orders pertaining to the time limit for speaking were not invoked
ruthlessly or at all on the Plaintiff or anyone else at the 1 March 2001
meeting. As the evidence showed, whether there were Standing Orders or not,
the Plaintiff was not one who was concerned about such niceties. He went on to
speak as he wished and when he was done, walked out with his allies. He had
enough time to make his oral defence in addition to his written one which was
read out in English and interpreted in Tamil. The MC proceeded on a lesser
number of charges instead of the original five in the 16 February 2001 show
cause letter but that surely could not have caused the Plaintiff to suffer any
disadvantage.

135\. Where the discrepancies in documentation were concerned, the Defendants
should have been more careful in the keeping of their records. I accept that
the discrepancies were a result of carelessness rather than dishonest intent
as the Defendants would gain no real advantage from the wrong versions. Their
carelessness resulted in some unnecessary debate during the trial and would be
taken into consideration in my order concerning the costs of these
proceedings.

136\. Where Theyvendran’s alleged pre-elections undertaking was concerned, I
would only observe that it was in the context of both he and Niru running for
office. Since Niru had decided not to run for office, the undertaking became
quite irrelevant. It was not the case that Theyvendran had undertaken that he
would bring Niru into the MC notwithstanding his decision to decline to
contest the elections. To do so would require the President asking an elected
member to resign to give way to Niru and that would surely be a breach of
faith with the members who had voted that member into office. In any case,
even if there was breach of an undertaking by the President, the way to
sanction him was not by way of discourtesy and disruptive repetition of the
Niru issue at MC meetings. The Plaintiff was no stranger to motions of no
confidence against incumbent office holders.

137\. The Plaintiff asserted that he was upset in November 2001 because the
documents despatched to the members of the TRC in advance of the AGM 2001
indicated that he was no longer a member of the TRC as opposed to not being a
member of the MC. However, his letter of demand of 19 November 2001 concerned
his office. In addition, he did not attend any more MC meetings after his
expulsion on 1 March 2001. Even if he was not informed about future MC
meetings because the General Secretary no longer sent him notice of such, he
knew that there must be a meeting every month under the TRC Constitution and
would have asked about this. His sudden resurrected interest in his office
made the Defendants’ allegations, that he was lying in wait and had timed his
actions to coincide with the upcoming AGM to intimidate, harass and embarrass
them, completely believable. The Plaintiff also chose not to attend the AGM
2001 and the AGM 2002 except by "proxy" and by the surreptitious recording of
the speeches made. If indeed he was of the view that he remained a member of
the MC, why did he not attend such important annual events like the AGM? I
disbelieved his assertions that he knew he could get no justice from attending
a meeting controlled by Theyvendran. Perhaps the chain of events from November
2001 was the "earthquake" he foretold.

138\. There was therefore no breach of any tenets of natural justice. The
Defendants dealt fairly with the Plaintiff even though there were mistakes as
to form committed along the way. The Plaintiff was properly and validly
expelled from the office of Deputy General Secretary on 1 March 2001. The
President, the Deputy President and the General Secretary were upset or
perhaps even exasperated by his conduct at meetings, as would any other
reasonable person, but they bore no malice against him. As the key appointment
holders and being part of the MC, they had no choice but to present the facts
of the case and their allegations against the Plaintiff at the special
meeting.

139\. In the light of the above, I do not see how the words complained of in
the Annual Report could be said to be defamatory of the Plaintiff. They were
true and were expressed in unemotional terms which were totally devoid of
judgment. As for the allegations concerning the Peravai and the minutes of the
AGM 2001, the Plaintiff chose to read the words as meaning that he had been
expelled from the TRC altogether. That would be putting a strained and
unreasonable meaning to the words in the context in which they appeared. At
any rate, the MC had informed the AGM 2001 about the Plaintiff’s letter of
demand and his writ of summons and there could not have been any
misunderstanding that the Plaintiff was expelled from the TRC and not merely
the MC. If Moganaruban’s words that the Plaintiff was using legal action to
threaten the organization were defamatory, they were perfectly justified and
were fair comment in the circumstances I have indicated above. It should also
be noted that the President made the clarification, although not obliged to
and despite the Plaintiff’s curt reply in his solicitors’ letter, about the
Plaintiff’s status at the AGM 2002 anyway.

140\. The Plaintiff’s actions against all the Defendants were accordingly
dismissed. In view of the TRC’s carelessness in maintaining the records and
the errors committed during the disciplinary proceedings, I felt it was fair
that the Defendants should not be awarded the entire costs of the proceedings.
I therefore ordered the Plaintiff to pay 70% of the costs of the actions and
directed that there should be only one bill of costs. The Defendants asked me
to make an order for costs against Niru primarily on the grounds he was the
driving force behind the Plaintiff’s actions which were for his benefit and he
was the Plaintiff’s financier. I declined to do so as the cross-examination of
Niru did not adduce sufficient material to justify such an order against a
non-party to the proceedings.
