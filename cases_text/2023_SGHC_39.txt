General Division of the High Court — Suit No 126 of 2021  
Andrew Ang SJ  
7–10 June 2022

17 February 2023

Andrew Ang SJ:

Introduction

1 At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for essential goods went
through the roof. Amongst such essential goods were medical grade face masks.
There was, therefore, business to be done among the manufacturers, suppliers
and middlemen. The present dispute arises out of one such transaction for the
supply of face masks. The Plaintiffs had entered into this transaction with
the Defendants for the supply of KN95 face masks. Instead of making a profit
from this, the Plaintiffs were saddled with a nightmare when the masks were
detained by the US customs for failure to meet the “KN95 standard”. The
Plaintiffs eventually had to cut their losses by destroying the masks so as to
avoid having to incur additional storage fees on goods which, by that point,
they could not sell.

The background

Facts

2 Both Plaintiffs are part of the Dialectic Distribution Group of companies.
The 1st Plaintiff, Dialectic PR LLC, is incorporated in Puerto Rico and
manages the operations of the Dialectic Distribution Group, including the sale
and purchase of goods and related banking transactions. The 2nd Plaintiff,
Dialectic Distribution LLC, is incorporated in New Jersey, USA. It handles
commercial day-to-day transactions for the Dialectic Distribution Group,
including warehousing and logistics. 1

One Mr Zachary Marlen Zeltzer (“Mr Zeltzer”) was the Chief Executive Officer
of the Plaintiffs. As he had negotiated the contract at the core of this
dispute, he gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs at trial.

3 The 1st Defendant, Brilliante Resources International Pte Ltd (“Brilliante
Singapore”), is an entity in the Brilliante Group of companies (the
“Brilliante Group”) which is wholly owned and operated by the 2nd Defendant,
Mr Woon Joon Foong, Jerrel (“Mr Woon”). The Brilliante Group comprises the
following three separate entities, of each of which Mr Woon was the sole
shareholder and director: 2

4 Prior to the transaction which is at the heart of the dispute in the present
suit (referred to as the “Disputed Transaction”), there were three
transactions which had taken place between the 1st Defendant and the
Plaintiffs for the supply of face masks. The first transaction was concluded
sometime around 6 April 2020. The Plaintiffs purchased 250,000 KN95 face masks
and 100,000 three-ply surgical face masks from Brilliante Singapore for the
sum of US$338,500.00.

5 The second transaction was concluded sometime around 7 April 2020. The
Plaintiffs purchased 250,000 KN95 face masks from Brilliante Singapore for the
sum of US$312,500.00. The third transaction was concluded sometime around 9
April 2020. The Plaintiffs purchased 500,000 KN95 face masks from Brilliante
Singapore for the sum of US$625,000.00. 4

6 Thereafter, on or about 23 April 2020, the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant
entered into the contract which formed the core of this dispute (the
“Contract”). The terms of the Contract are found in a quotation sent by the
1st Defendant to the 2nd Plaintiff, and are not disputed by the Defendants. It
provided as follows:

(a) Brilliante Singapore was to supply “KN95 face masks”.

(b) The face masks would be “CE & FDA approved”.

(c) The purchase price of US$1,265,000.00 was to be paid in full to Brilliante
Singapore’s bank account before any shipment of the face masks.

(d) The face masks would be sent to the Plaintiffs’ nominated logistics
provider in Hong Kong by the week of 27 April 2020 to 3 May 2020.

(e) Brilliante Singapore was responsible for the cost, insurance and freight
up to the point that the face masks were delivered in Hong Kong. 5

7 It was also undisputed that prior to the Contract being entered into, Mr
Zeltzer had forwarded to Mr Woon, the details of the requirements which the
Plaintiffs required the face masks to meet. These details had been provided to
Mr Zeltzer by the Plaintiffs’ end customers (to whom the Plaintiffs had
intended to supply the face masks). 6

Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 18(a)(i).

8 Mr Woon followed up on the request and sent to Mr Zeltzer various
certificates which suggested that the face masks were manufactured by CTT, and
that they met all the necessary requirements of being “CE & FDA approved”.
Those documents were sent to the Plaintiff on 20 April 2020 by way of WhatsApp
and email. 7

9 On 24 April 2020, the Plaintiffs paid US$1,265,000.00 to the 1st Defendant
by way of telegraphic transfer. Brilliante Singapore arranged for the face
masks to be delivered to Hong Kong. On or about 29 April 2020, the face masks
were received by the Plaintiffs’ nominated logistics provider, Kintetsu World
Express (“KWE”). The Plaintiffs had also used KWE as their logistics provider
in their three previous transactions with the Defendants. KWE arranged for the
face masks to be transported from Hong Kong to the Dialectic Group in Oakland,
New Jersey. 8

10 Upon arrival in the United States of America (“US”), however, the face
masks were detained by the US Customs and Border Protection. As part of the
customs requirements in force for imported face masks, on 21 May 2020, the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (“NIOSH”) National
Personal Protective Technology Laboratory tested a sample group of the face
masks. All masks in this sample group failed to meet the “KN95 standard” –
they measured significantly less than 95% filter efficiency. Specifically, the
test results showed that the masks in the sample group were found to have a
minimum filter efficiency of 24.5% and a maximum filter efficiency of 85.8%. 9

Because of this, the face masks were temporarily confiscated by US authorities
and barred from entry into the US on grounds that they were unlawful and unfit
for distribution in the US market. 10

11 The face masks were subsequently shipped back to Hong Kong at the
suggestion of Mr Woon, who had asked for the Plaintiffs’ assistance in having
the face masks returned and in obtaining a refund from the manufacturers of
the masks. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 28.

This was done so that the masks could be sent back to the manufacturer in
China. The Plaintiffs shipped the goods back to Hong Kong at their own
expense. Unfortunately, the masks could not be sent to China from Hong Kong;
left with little choice, the Plaintiffs stored the masks with Captains Freight
Services (HK Limited) (“Captains Freight”) and incurred storage costs. On 22
June 2021, the masks were discarded so as to prevent any further loss or
damage to the Plaintiffs. 12

the Contract. 13

As against the 2nd Defendant, the Plaintiffs seek to hold him personally

veil should be lifted to make the 2nd Defendant personally liable for the loss
and damage suffered by them in respect of the Contract. 14

Preliminary issue: whether the 1st Defendant was acting as agent for the
Plaintiffs

13 I turn now to deal with one preliminary issue. While the Plaintiffs say
that the alleged Contract was for the sale of face masks by the Defendants to
the Plaintiffs, the Defendants have a very different characterisation of the
Contract. They plead, in their defence, that the agreement between the 1st
Defendant and the 2nd Plaintiff in respect of the Contract was one where the
2nd Plaintiff had agreed to employ the 1st Defendant, and the 1st Defendant
had agreed to sell the KN95 face masks and receive payment for the same as the
2nd Plaintiff’s agent. 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

Defence (Amendment No. 3) at para 5A.

14 However, as the Plaintiffs point out, Mr Woon had informed the court during
the course of his cross-examination that the Defendants were no longer taking
the position that they were acting as the Plaintiffs’ agents, 17

##### Foot Note 17

nor were they claiming that the Plaintiffs had contracted directly with
Androidlink (a company which the 2nd Defendant had allegedly sourced the masks
from). 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 52(b).

Notwithstanding the abandonment of their pleaded position, the Defendants have
once again, sought to resurrect this argument in their closing submissions. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at paras 35 – 54.

They say that the 1st Defendant had the actual authority, either express or
implied, to act on the 2nd Plaintiff’s behalf. The Defendants point to the
terms of the Contract as evidence that there was express actual authority; 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para 41.

and in so far as implied actual authority was concerned, evidence for that can
be found in the 2nd Plaintiff’s conduct and the fact that the acts of the 1st
Defendant in relation to the Contract were incidental to the fulfilment of the
tasks which they were expressly authorised to do. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para 42.

15 In my view, there is no factual basis on which it could be said that there
was actual authority, whether express or implied. As neatly summarised by
Professor Tan Cheng Han, express actual authority arises where the principal
has expressly conferred authority on an agent such as where the board of
directors of a company passes a resolution expressly giving consent for
another to act on the company’s behalf in negotiating and entering into a
contract; as for implied actual authority, that is to be inferred from the
conduct of parties and the circumstances of the case: The Law of Agency
(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“The Law of Agency”) at [03.014] and
[03.027]. While the Defendants claim that there was express actual authority,
this is but a bare assertion considering that they have not shown any concrete
evidence of the same. In so far as the Defendants rely on the quotation
provided by the 1st Defendant to the 2nd Plaintiff as proof of such express
actual authority, 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para 41.

such reliance is misplaced. Nowhere in the quotation does it state that the
2nd Plaintiff was employing the 1st Defendant as its agent to source and
supply face masks.

16 I would further add that even if the Defendants sought to rely on the
WhatsApp exchanges between Mr Woon and Mr Zeltzer, this would not take their
argument on express actual authority very far. While the WhatsApp messages
would lend themselves to the impression that the 2nd Defendant was acting qua
agent given his role in sourcing the masks from the various vendors, those
messages must be read in their proper context, viz, that Mr Zeltzer was simply
liaising with Mr Woon who was offering to sell him masks sourced from various
places. The following message which Mr Zeltzer sent to Mr Woon sometime after
the masks were detained in the US is telling of the true relationship between
the parties: 23

##### Foot Note 23

Zeltzer AEIC at pp 206 – 207.

“First and foremost I want to tell you I think your (sic) a great person. I do
need you to understand my side. I trust you as being me on the ground over
there in china/hkg. We barley (sic) have ever done any business besides
inspections and some cosplay stuff. I sent you well over $2 million dollars. I
trusted as an inspector you knew these people which I did ask you numerous
times if you did. Today I had to inform my bank and everyone I'm in jepoardy
of collopasing because of this. I don't want to go in circles with you. As I
mentioned above it doesn't meet US standards when they put KN95 on the box.
The goods are detained. The goods are detained because of a check. If the
goods passed inspection it would of been released no problem 4 weeks ago. But
instead, the government is doing an investigation if I was in on this. Now I
am out $1,265,000.00 + roughly $125,000.00 in shipping. This is serious money,
and I am a small company. I need you give me a resolution in a couple days
because I paid you not them. I don't have a contract with them. But I can't
walk away without. I am willing to take a loss of some type to get this over
with but I can not be out this type of month. I do not want more masks at a
cheaper price.

[emphasis added]

Clearly, while the Defendants played the role of a middleman, it was clear
that the Plaintiffs only had a contractual relationship with the Defendants,
and not the vendor of the face masks.

17 As for the Defendants’ argument that there was implied actual authority,
that too is fatally misconceived. They have argued that the acts of the 1st
Defendant were incidental to the fulfilment of the tasks that they were
expressly authorised to do. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para 42(a).

This argument, however, is premised on the fact that there was express actual
authority granted in the first place. For example, if a principal grants his
agent express actual authority to carry out [X], the law recognises that the
agent must have the implied authority to carry out all such other acts which
are necessary and incidental to performing [X]: The Law of Agency at [03.029].
However, as I have already found, there was no express actual authority to
speak of in this case. Finally, I note that while the Defendants assert that
the “1st Defendant was implicitly allowed to do what they did by the 2nd
Plaintiff”, 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para 42(b).

this is merely another bare assertion; the Defendants have not pointed me to
any concrete evidence in support of their assertion.

18 I therefore find that the 1st Defendant was not acting as the 2nd
Plaintiff’s agent.

Issues to be determined

19 Having determined that the 1st Defendant was not acting as the 2nd
Plaintiff’s agent, it follows that the Contract was for the sale of face masks
as opposed to one which created a principal-agent relationship between the
parties. Accordingly, these were the issues which arose for my determination:

(a) Whether the 1st Defendant had breached the terms of the Contract.

(b) Whether the 1st Defendant’s corporate veil should be lifted so as to hold
the 2nd Defendant liable.

(c) Whether the 2nd Defendant was liable for inducing the 1st Defendant to
breach the Contract.

20 I turn now to consider these issues seriatim.

Issue 1: Whether the 1st Defendant had breached the terms of the Contract

21 The Plaintiffs have framed their claim as one based on breach of contract.
At the outset, it is important to note that parties have not reduced their
entire agreement to written form. It therefore comes as no surprise that the
Plaintiffs and the Defendants dispute the terms of the Contract arising out of
the Disputed Transaction. On the one hand, the Plaintiffs have pleaded that
the Contract contained an express condition that the KN95 face masks would be
“of the KN95 standard type and comply with each and all requirements of the
KN95 standard in the United States and in Europe, and would be manufactured by
an FDA approved and CE approved manufacturer”. 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) at para 8.

In addition, the Plaintiffs have also pleaded that the Sale of Goods Act (Cap
393) applies such that there is an implied term that: (a) the KN95 face masks
would correspond with the description; and (b) the KN95 face masks would be of
satisfactory quality. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) at para 9.

22 On the other hand, the Defendants’ case was that the face masks sourced
would be of the KN95 standard type and comply with the GB 2626-2006 standard
(which was the China National Mandatory Standard applicable at the material
time), with a filtration efficiency of 0.3 μm. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

Defence (Amendment No. 3) at para 5(e).

The Defendants’ alternative case was that they were asked to source for face
masks which appeared to be of the KN95 standard type – these would be masks
which were manufactured by a company registered with the US Food and Drug
Administration, or masks which bore the CE mark.

23 From the parties’ pleaded cases, it is clear that they agree that the masks
to be sourced would be of the KN95 standard type – what they dispute is the
quality these masks had to meet. The Plaintiffs’ main case is that the
Contract provided that the masks had to meet US and European standards for the
KN95 standard type; the Defendants’ case is that the Contract merely provided
that the masks meet the GB 2626-2006 standard. It is therefore necessary,
bearing in mind the parties’ pleaded cases, to objectively ascertain from the
relevant evidence what the terms of that Contract were before determining
whether the 1st Defendant had indeed breached those terms: Forefront Medical
Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 at [7] and [86];
OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon [2012] 4 SLR 1206 at [41];

Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) at [06.001] – [06.002].

24 I start with the Defendants’ argument that it was “disingenuous” of the
Plaintiffs to allege that parties had agreed that the face masks would be “CE”
or “FDA” approved. They say that the Plaintiffs were fully aware that the
certifications relating to CE and FDA from the Chinese companies which
manufactured the masks were fake. The Plaintiffs only cared about making a
quick buck, and did not care about the authenticity of the masks so long as
they could be sold. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para 15.

According to the Defendants, the Plaintiffs believed that the masks could be
sold in Europe so long as they bore the CE stamp, and in the United States,
provided that there was documentation showing that they were manufactured by a
company on the FDA list. In support of this, the Defendants rely on the
following exchange in cross-examination of Mr Zeltzer where certain questions
had been put to Mr Zeltzer about the WhatsApp texts he had exchanged with the
2nd Defendant on 20 April 2020:

Q: It just means that there were discussions for CE marks, FDA marks and
packaging for all four transactions. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: This was despite the fact that, from as early as 3 April, Jerrel had warned
you about the dangers of getting masks from China. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: This was despite the fact that Jerrel had talked about the fact that CE
marks were fake from as early as 14 April. Correct?

A: Yes, that’s what it says.

Q: I’ll just correct myself, it’s 12 April instead. And this is despite the
fact that Jerrel had cautioned you against getting goods with FDA markings
from China. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: So despite these warnings, you still went ahead; you placed orders for the
four transactions for face masks from China. Correct?

A: Yes…

…

Q: This is a discussion between you and Jerrel on 20 April… before you made
the transaction for the disputed order on 23 April. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: …Then you go on to say: “Between me and u and this is on our friendship, I
personally believe everything is fake but its just China right? … I just want
to sell mask I don’t give a shit.” … “U think those rr real… I [honestly
don’t] care… I’m just asking”

Q: …You say:

“Listen at this point if we can’t get goods to kwe China or [Hong Kong] with
ce mark, and print at least on package drop. It’s not worth for both of us.”

[emphasis added]

25 Notwithstanding what Mr Zeltzer had testified during cross-examination, it
is perhaps useful to take a closer look at the WhatsApp messages between Mr
Zeltzer and the 2nd Defendant in order to appreciate the context in which
those messages were exchanged. I would also add that, in reading these
messages, it is important to not parse them with the sort of linguistic
precision that lawyers are accustomed to. Both Mr Zeltzer and the 2nd
Defendant were men of commerce who were keen on doing business; what was
foremost on their minds was getting the deal through. Bearing this in mind, I
turn now to examine the relevant extracts from their WhatsApp conversation on
20 April 2020 which are reproduced below: 30

[emphasis added]

26 In the set of texts reproduced above, Mr Zeltzer and the 2nd Defendant were
discussing one of their previous transactions where a shipment of masks which
Mr Zeltzer was attempting to sell to a customer in Germany ran into problems.
Reading the above extract of the WhatsApp messages between Mr Zeltzer and the
2nd Defendant, one might draw two possible interpretations. The first is that
Mr Zeltzer’s hunger for profits was tempered by hard reality, and while he may
have had personal doubts about the efficacy of the KN95 face mask, he was
still concerned about whether the masks which he was purchasing could meet the
standard imposed by the countries to which he was exporting the face masks to.
The second is that Mr Zeltzer’s hunger for profits overrode all other
considerations, and that he did not care whether the masks were legitimate so
long as he was able to sell them at a profit. To that end, he was willing to
pass off what he knew were clearly fake masks which would not clear any and
all safety standards imposed by the country of import with the appropriate
labels from either the FDA or CE to give the masks a stamp of legitimacy.

27 I find that the first interpretation is the more likely version. It is
apparent that while Mr Zeltzer had indeed said that he personally knew that
the masks made in China were fake, and that he did not care because all he
wanted to do was to sell masks, he was also alive to the fact that the
countries he was exporting to had certain standards when it came to the import
of face masks. That much is clear when Mr Zeltzer goes on to say “but germans
r germans”. To my mind, it was clear that Mr Zeltzer was a hard-nosed
pragmatist when it came to making money. While he may have had doubts about
the efficacy of the masks, he was alive to the fact that the masks had to pass
inspection otherwise they would not be accepted by the end-buyer, thus ending
any and all hopes of making a quick buck.

28 Evidence to support this conclusion can be found in several WhatsApp texts
dated 23 April 2020 between Mr Zeltzer and the 2nd Defendant. These texts were
exchanged shortly before the 2nd Defendant sent Mr Zeltzer the quotation for
the Disputed Transaction. I reproduce the relevant extracts of the said
WhatsApp conversation below: 31

Z: For sure

Z: Everyone else did it for

Jerryl Asia: We deal with vendor 2

Z: Ok

Jerryl Asia: And I have 3rd vendor as well

[emphasis added]

29 It is therefore clear from these series of messages that Mr Zeltzer had
recalled his previous experience where his German customer raised issues
concerning the quality of the masks he was supplying. He was therefore keen to
avoid any problems with the current batch of masks which he was sourcing from
the Defendants, and had, to that end, reminded the 2nd Defendant that the
masks had to pass quality control. It is also clear that the 2nd Defendant
understood that Mr Zeltzer wanted the masks to be of a certain quality as he
told Mr Zeltzer to “not worry”. The inference which I draw from this is that
parties had agreed that the masks supplied in the Disputed Transaction had to
be of a certain quality. The more important question which I had to decide was
what was the standard which parties had agreed had to be met. The only common
ground in the Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ pleadings is that the masks would be
of the KN95 standard type. The Plaintiffs say that this means that the masks
had to satisfy each and all requirements of the KN95 standard in the US and in
Europe, and would be manufactured by an FDA approved and CE approved
manufacturer. The Defendants, on the other hand, disagree. They say that the
masks only had to comply with the GB 2626-2006 standard (which was the China
National Mandatory Standard applicable at the material time).

30 It is clear from the evidence that neither party’s position is supportable.
In particular, the WhatsApp conversation between Mr Zeltzer and Mr Woon showed
that neither side had explicitly stipulated the precise standard that the KN95
masks were to meet, be it the prevailing standards in either the US or Europe
or the GB 2626-2006 standard. There was, therefore, no express condition as to
the precise standard which the KN95 masks had to meet. The Plaintiff, however,
had one other string to their legal bow – that of terms implied in law. They
pleaded that pursuant to s 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393) (“SOGA”),
the Agreement contained an “implied condition that the KN95 [f]acemasks would
correspond with the description”. 32

The Plaintiff also pleaded that pursuant to ss 14(2), 14(2A) and 14(2B) of the
SOGA, the Agreement contained an implied condition that the KN95 face masks
would be of satisfactory quality. 33

Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) at para 9.

31 For ease of analysis, the relevant provisions of ss 13 and 14 of the SOGA
state:

Sale by description

13.—(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there
is an implied condition that the goods will correspond with the description.

(2) If the sale is by sample as well as by description, it is not sufficient
that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not
also correspond with the description.

(3) A sale of goods is not prevented from being a sale by description by
reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the
buyer.

(4) Paragraph 4 of the Schedule applies in relation to a contract made before
18 May 1973.

Implied terms about quality or fitness

14.—(1) Except as provided by this section and section 15 and subject to any
other enactment, there is no implied condition or warranty about the quality
or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of
sale.

(2) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an
implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of
satisfactory quality.

(2A) For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they
meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory,
taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and
all the other relevant circumstances.

(2B) For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state
and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate cases
aspects of the quality of goods:

(a) fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are
commonly supplied;

(b) appearance and finish;

(c) freedom from minor defects;

(d) safety;

(e) durability.

32 In relation to ss 13 and 14 of the SOGA, it bears remembering that these
are implied conditions as to the description and the quality of the goods, and
so being classified as a “condition”, it must be strictly complied with and a
breach will entitle the innocent party to treat the contract concerned as
discharged: Chai Cher Watt (trading as Chuang Aik Engineering Works) v SDL
Technologies Pte Ltd and another appeal [2012] 1 SLR 152 (“Chai Cher Watt”) at
[19]. This is, of course, subject to s 15A of the SOGA which limits the right
to reject goods for breach of condition where the breach is slight and/or
technical: Chai Cher Watt at [22].

33 I begin the analysis with the Plaintiffs’ assertion that there had been a
breach of the implied condition under s 13. In Chai Cher Watt, the appellant
and respondent had entered into a contract for the sale and purchase of a
drilling and boring machine (the “Drilling Machine”) as well as a contract for
the sale and purchase of a lathe machine. A dispute arose when the appellant
conducted checks on the Drilling Machine and discovered a discrepancy in its
length, and that it was refurbished. The appellant sued, claiming that it was
either an express or implied term that the Drilling Machine was to be newly
manufactured and that the respondent was in breach for having delivered a
refurbished machine. In the alternative, the appellant claimed that the
respondent was in breach for failing to deliver a Drilling Machine which
conformed to the specifications set out in the contract. When the case reached
the Court of Appeal, the court found that the contract referred to the length
of the Drilling Machine as 11 metres, and that the stipulation as to length
was an “integral and important ingredient of the identity of the Drilling
Machine” under the contract: Chai Cher Watt at [24]. The fact that the
Drilling Machine which was supplied was 13.5 metres in length meant that there
was prima facie a breach of the condition under s 13. The discrepancy of some
2.5m could not be said to be de minimis.

34 In the present case, the KN95 face masks were described as being “CE & FDA
approved”. 34

##### Foot Note 34

Zeltzer AEIC at p 251.

The question therefore was whether the KN95 face masks fit the description of
being CE and FDA approved. Here, the Plaintiffs had adduced the evidence of
one Mr Dale Pfriem (“Mr Pfriem”), an expert in the field of respiratory
protective equipment. The Defendants did not dispute that Mr Pfriem had the
technical expertise to give expert evidence as to the quality of the KN95 face
masks. In any case, it was clear to me that Mr Pfriem had such technical
expertise judging from his resume which demonstrated that he had experience
relating to the performance testing of respiratory protective equipment. 35

Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Dale Pfriem dated 26 March 2022 (“Dale
Pfriem AEIC”) at pp 311 – 312.

35 Mr Pfriem began his report by sketching out the regulatory requirements in
the US. There were three US organisations which were relevant: the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (“NIOSH”). Mr Pfriem highlighted that OSHA mandated that any and all
respiratory equipment used in the workplace had to be formally approved by
NIOSH. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA promulgated certain Emergency
Use Authorisations (“EUAs”) to allow for the use of non-NIOSH approved
Respiratory Protective Devices for US healthcare workers. While CTT Co Ltd
(the company which had allegedly produced the masks in question) was included
in the FDA’s EUA of 3 April which authorised the use of certain non-NIOSH
approved disposable filtering facepiece respirators manufactured in China, Mr
Pfriem explained that this did not amount to being FDA “registered,
established, listed or approved”. 36

##### Foot Note 36

×

Dale Pfriem AEIC at p 107.

36 As to whether the KN95 masks were FDA approved, Mr Pfriem took the view
that they were not. 37

##### Foot Note 37

×

Dale Pfriem AEIC at p 116.

He explained that in order for the KN95 face masks to be recognised by the
FDA, it had to first obtain approval from NIOSH. In so far as the Defendants
attempted to rely on the grant of the Certificate of Registration to CTT Co
Ltd, Mr Pfriem took the view that this did not mean that the KN95 masks were
FDA approved. This certificate was granted after completion of the FDA
Establishment Registration which was different from the FDA 510K Device
Approval Process. The former did not have any independent performance testing
and quality assurance system monitoring.

37 Mr Pfriem also sketched out the European regulatory landscape in explaining
the process behind obtaining the Community Europe (“CE”) mark. The key piece
of legislation was the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – Regulation (EU)
2016/425 (“Reg 2016/425) which set out the requirements for marking PPE with
the CE mark. For a piece of PPE to bear the CE mark, it had to be certified by
an approved and authorised EU Notified Body. In his report, Mr Pfriem took the
view that the KN95 masks were not CE approved. 38

##### Foot Note 38

×

Dale Pfriem AEIC at p 115.

He arrived at this conclusion on the basis that the two pieces of evidence the
Defendants relied on in showing that the KN95 masks were CE approved were
“baseless and meaningless”. The first piece of evidence was a Certificate of
Compliance which was issued to the mask manufacturer, CTT Co Ltd (“CTT”). That
certificate had been issued by an Italian entity, Ente Certificazione Macchine
SRL (“Ente”). Mr Pfriem looked into Ente’s background and discovered that they
were not an “EU authorised Notified Body” under Reg 2016/425 and was therefore
not authorised or empowered to grant the CE certification, or to authorise a
manufacturer to place the CE mark on any product or packaging. The second
piece of evidence was the Declaration of Conformity from Global Testing
Services (“GTS”). Mr Pfriem also found that GTS was not an “EU authorised
Notified Body” under Reg 2016/425.

38 Mr Pfriem’s findings on this point were not seriously challenged by counsel
for the 1st Defendant. Instead, the main issue the Defendants had with Mr
Pfriem’s report was the finding he had made that the Defendants had defrauded
the Plaintiff and that the masks were counterfeit and had not been
manufactured by CTT. 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at paras 137 – 147.

Leaving aside the issue which the Defendants took with that aspect of Mr
Pfriem’s report, I saw no reason why Mr Pfriem’s opinion that the KN95 masks
were not CE or FDA approved should be disregarded. For one, the Defendants had
not adduced any evidence to challenge Mr Pfriem’s findings on this point.
Further, I found that there was indeed a basis for Mr Pfriem’s findings in
relation to the CE mark. A perusal of the list of EU authorised Notified
Bodies under Reg 2016/425 shows that neither Ente nor GTS were on that list.
This suggested to me that the KN95 masks were not CE approved. I therefore
found that there had been a breach of the implied condition under s 13 of the
SOGA.

39 I turn now to examine whether there was a breach of the implied term as to
quality under s 14 of the SOGA. In assessing whether the goods are of
“satisfactory quality”, the inquiry is an objective one, to be undertaken from
the viewpoint of a reasonable person. Such a reasonable person is one who is
placed in the position of the buyer and armed with his knowledge of the
transaction and its background rather than one who is not so acquainted. The
question is whether this reasonable person, in the position of the buyer,
would regard the quality of the goods in question as satisfactory. The
Plaintiff, being the one who asserts that the goods are not of satisfactory
quality, bears the burden of proof: National Foods Ltd v Pars Ram Brothers
(Pte) Ltd [2007] 2 SLR(R) 1048 (“National Foods Ltd”) at [58] citing Compact
Metal Industries Ltd v PPG Industries (Singapore) Ltd [2006] SGHC 242 at
[102]. Also of relevance is s 14(2B) which provides a list of non-exhaustive
factors for the court to consider in determining the quality of goods.

40 In National Foods Ltd, the respondent, a locally-incorporated company, had
entered into four identical contracts to sell dried ginger slices of Chinese
origin to the appellant, a company incorporated in Pakistan. When the ginger
slices were delivered, the appellant discovered that they were heavily
contaminated with mould, had high moisture levels, and were full of dust.
Efforts to clean the ginger to make it fit for use failed. The appellant sued.
It argued that there had been a breach of the implied conditions of quality
and fitness under ss 14(2) and 14(3) of the SOGA. It also argued that there
was a breach of an implied term of the contract that the ash content of the
ginger slices should not exceed 7%. The trial judge dismissed the appellant’s
claim.

41 On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the appellant had discharged its
burden of proving that the ginger slices were of unsatisfactory quality and
that there had been a breach of s 14(2) of the SOGA. Central to the Court of
Appeal’s reasoning were sub-ss (a) and (d) of s 14(2B) which dealt with
fitness for purpose and safety respectively. In finding that the ginger slices
were not fit for purpose of being used as a food product and that they were
unsafe for consumption, the court held that the key criterion was Reg 227 of
the Food Regulations (Cap 283, Rg 1, 2005 Rev Ed) which stipulated that ginger
could contain sulphur dioxide as a preservative and must not contain more than
7% total ash. Reg 227 operated as a “benchmark or standard by which to assess
quality” and did not operate, in and of itself, as an implied term of the
contracts. This was because where the contract was silent as to the standard
to be expected of the goods, a good gauge of quality would be the standards
prescribed by the relevant statutes.

42 In the present case, parties took differing views as to the standard the
KN95 masks had to meet. The Defendants, for instance, claimed that the masks
only had to comply with the GB 2626-2006 standard. It was, however, clear from
Mr Pfriem’s evidence that there was no substantial difference between the GB
2626-2006 standard or the modified NIOSH test. 40

##### Foot Note 40

×

Dale Pfriem AEIC at p 103.

Having analysed both the GB 2626-2006 standard and the modified NIOSH test, Mr
Pfriem noted that both tests specified the exact same aerosol particle
specification of 0.075 ± 0.020 μm and a Standard Deviation not exceeding 1.86.
He therefore concluded that if the masks were unable to pass the NIOSH test,
they would similarly fail under GB 2626-2006 standard.

43 Again, the Defendants did not challenge Mr Pfriem’s evidence on this point
in cross-examination, nor did they call their own expert witness to dispute Mr
Pfriem’s findings. I accept Mr Pfriem’s opinion that the GB 2626-2006 standard
was substantially the same as the modified NIOSH test, and that the masks,
having failed the modified NIOSH test, would not have passed the GB 2626-2006
standard either. Therefore, taking the Defendants’ case at its highest, and
assuming that the KN95 masks were only required to comply with the GB
2626-2006 standard, it is clear that the masks were not of the stipulated
quality. I therefore find that there had been a breach of the implied term of
quality under s 14 of the SOGA.

44 In summary, I find that the 1st Defendant is liable for breach of the
Contract. As to the quantum of damages for which the 1st Defendant is liable,
the only point which the Defendants have disputed is that the Plaintiffs had
failed to reasonably mitigate their losses given that they could have sold the
defective masks as three-ply masks elsewhere but did not do so. 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para 67.

45 I reject this argument. The burden of proving that the aggrieved party had
failed to mitigate its loss falls on the defaulting party (Tractors Singapore
Ltd v Pacific Ocean Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd [2021] 4 SLR 44 at [144]).
It bears remembering that the reasonableness inquiry in assessing whether
damages had been mitigated “amounts to nothing more than the common law’s
attempt to reflect commercial and fact-sensitive fairness at the remedial
stage”: Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another v Seraya Energy Pte Ltd and
another and other appeals [2021] 1 SLR 631 at [315], citing The Asia Star
[2010] 2 SLR 1154 at [31]–[32]. The Defendants have not discharged their
burden of showing that the Plaintiffs could have sold the masks as three-ply
masks which, according to them, the Plaintiffs could have done as a means of
mitigating their loss. In any event, given that the masks had already been
rejected by the US authorities, it was unlikely that the Plaintiffs would have
been able to sell them elsewhere, even assuming that those masks could be sold
as three-ply masks. As a matter of prudence, the Plaintiffs would have had to
come clean and disclose to any potential buyer, the issues with the masks
(such as the deceptive labelling and that the masks had failed the NIOSH
testing).

46 Leaving aside the Defendants’ arguments, I find that the Plaintiffs had
taken reasonable steps to mitigate their damage by working with the 2nd
Defendant to arrange for the masks to be sent back so as to secure a partial
refund. 42

##### Foot Note 42

×

Zeltzer AEIC at p 215.

In the circumstances, this was the most reasonable cause of action for them to
take given that the 2nd Defendant had communicated to Mr Zeltzer that the
vendor was willing to issue a partial refund provided the masks were returned.
In so far as the Plaintiffs had suffered loss in arranging to have the masks
transported back to Hong Kong, and securely stored whilst attempting to obtain
the refund – they are entitled to claim for these sums too: The Asia Star at
[24] (see also Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd v Burgundy
Global Exploration Corp [2013] 3 SLR 1017 at [56]).

47 I therefore find that the 1st Defendant was liable to the Plaintiffs for
the sum of US$3,254,673.28 which comprised the following:

(a) US$1,265,000 being the purchase price of the KN95 masks;

(b) US$604,673.28, being the storage, air freight, testing and insurance costs
which the Plaintiffs had incurred; and

(c) US$1,385,000, being loss of profits the Plaintiffs had suffered.

Issue 2: Whether the 1st Defendant’s corporate veil should be lifted so as to
hold the 2nd Defendant liable

48 Having found the 1st Defendant liable for breach of the Contract, I turn
now to consider the Plaintiffs’ argument that the corporate veil should be
lifted so as to hold the 2nd Defendant liable. It should be remembered that
the corporate veil, being an exception to the general rule that a company is a
separate legal entity, will only be lifted in very narrow circumstances (see
Commodities Intelligence Centre Pte Ltd v Mako International Trd Pte Ltd and
others [2022] SGHC 131 at [142]). The Plaintiff argues that the corporate veil
should be pierced on the ground that the 1st Defendant was the alter ego of
the 2nd Defendant, or on that of fraud. I will deal with each argument in
turn, beginning with the Plaintiffs’ argument that the 1st Defendant was the
2nd Defendant’s alter ego.

49 As noted by the Court of Appeal in Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and
another and another appeal [2013] 4 SLR 308 (“Alwie”) at [96], citing NEC Asia
Pte Ltd v Picket & Rail Asia Pacific Pte Ltd [2011] 2 SLR 565 at [31] and Zim
Integrated Shipping Services Ltd v Dafni Igal [2010] 2 SLR 426 at [86]–[88],
the “ground of alter ego is distinct from that based on a façade or sham”, and
the key question that must be asked whenever an argument of alter ego is
raised is whether the company is carrying on the business of its controller.
In Alwie, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge’s decision to pierce
the corporate veil on the ground of alter ego. The court found that the first
appellant, Alwie, had admitted under cross-examination that he had
incorporated the company, OAFL, for the purposes of receiving payment under
the first Sale and Purchase (“SPA”) agreement. But that was not all. Alwie had
also appointed himself as the sole director and shareholder of OAFL, and
admitted that OAFL was controlled by him and that he was the directing mind
and will of OAFL. Apart from Alwie’s admissions, the manner in which Alwie
procured the payments suggested that Alwie made no distinction between himself
and OAFL.

50 Apart from Alwie, the Plaintiffs have also relied on the High Court
decision in Singapore Tourism Board v Children’s Media Ltd and others [2008] 3
SLR(R) 981 (“Singapore Tourism Board”) (which was affirmed on appeal – see
Children’s Media Ltd and others v Singapore Tourism Board [2009] 1 SLR(R)
524). While the true ratio of that case is somewhat debatable, it did not
appear to me that the court, in that case, had lifted the corporate veil on
the grounds of alter ego. In that case, the plaintiff was the Singapore
Tourism Board (“STB”). STB had entered into a series of agreements with the
first defendant, a UK company, to stage a musical event in Singapore. The
second defendant was another UK company that was the shareholder of the first
defendant. The third defendant was, at all material times, the director and
chief executive officer of the first and second defendants, as well as the
sole shareholder of the second defendant. STB entered into an agreement with
the first defendant, which the third defendant said was a special purpose
vehicle which had been specially created to hold the rights to the artistes,
to ensure that such rights could not be exploited for other events.

51 The first defendant failed to carry out its obligations pursuant to this
first agreement. In an attempt to get the event off the ground, STB signed
another two agreements with the first defendant. The situation, however, did
not improve and the defendants purported to terminate the third and final
agreement as between STB and the first defendant after claiming that the first
defendant was unable to meet its contractual obligations. STB brought a suit
against the defendants, seeking inter alia, to recover sponsorship sums which
had been paid to the first defendant under the agreements. STB argued that the
corporate veil should be pierced so as to hold either the second or third
defendants liable. The court held (at [110]) that it was clear on the facts
that the first defendant was merely the conduit to receive the sponsorship
sums. The third defendant then proceeded to milk the first defendant dry by
withdrawing the money to pay himself, the second defendant, his friends, and
third parties before transferring the remaining sums to the second defendant’s
account. The first defendant was then made to bear all the expenses and
liabilities of the second defendant as well as that of third parties. Having
perused the judgment, it did not appear to me that the court in that case had
lifted the corporate veil on the ground of alter ego. Indeed, in a local
textbook on corporate law, the learned authors take the view that this case
was best rationalised as one “where the controller was personally liable
because he had used the companies for fraudulent or dishonest ends…despite the
trial judge’s explicit references to the sham and evasion principles”: Hans
Tjio, Pearlie Koh and Lee Pey Woan, Corporate Law (Academy Publishing, 2016)
(“Corporate Law”) at [06.046].

52 In the present case, the Plaintiffs raised the following points in support
of their argument that the 1st Defendant was the alter ego of the 2nd
Defendant. First, they pointed to the fact that the 2nd Defendant was the sole
shareholder and director of all the entities in the Brilliante Group. This
meant that he had free rein to manipulate the actions of the 1st Defendant in
the way he did. Second, the 2nd Defendant’s account of how he used the
companies in the Brilliante Group interchangeably demonstrated that he did not
distinguish between the rights and obligations of the entities in the
Brilliante Group and himself. The Plaintiffs further say that this was
supported by the clear lack of corporate governance of the entities in the
Brilliante Group.

53 I cannot accept the Plaintiffs’ arguments. As was noted by Judith Prakash J
(as she then was) in Sitt Tatt Bhd v Goh Tai Hock [2009] 2 SLR(R) 44 at [79],
it is a general proposition of law that parties are entitled to protect
themselves by creating companies even if these are effectively one-man
companies. To this proposition, I would add that parties are also entitled to
manage a group of companies, even if they are all one-man companies, as they
see fit (see also Cavenagh Investment Pte Ltd v Kaushik Rajiv [2013] 2 SLR 543
at [41]–[42]).

54 This may, at times, give rise to the impression that the company in
question was merely an alter ego because of the manner in which the companies
in the group are managed. For example, in the present case, the 2nd Defendant
gave an account of how he had used the 1st Defendant to pay for sums owed by
Brilliante HK. 43

The Plaintiffs pointed to this as evidence that the 2nd Defendant had made the
“entities in the Brilliante Group to assume each other’s obligations” and that
payment was made via the 1st Defendant simply because it was more convenient
to do so. 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 64(b)(i)(A).

It was, however, apparent to me from the evidence that the 2nd Defendant had
not done so out of mere convenience, but because the money had to be urgently
transferred. Given the circumstances, one could see why the 2nd Defendant had
arranged for the transfer to be made via the 1st Defendant instead of
Brilliante HK. I would add that the story might have been different had the
Plaintiffs been able to demonstrate a consistent pattern in which the 2nd
Defendant made the companies in the Brilliante Group assume each others’
obligations. But there was no such evidence on the facts before me.

55 I would also add that the Plaintiffs’ argument that the 2nd Defendant would
choose which “entity in the Brilliante Group would enter into contractual
obligations with third parties, when these third parties were dealing directly
with him personally” did not take their case very far. As I have mentioned
above (at [53]), parties are entitled to shield themselves from commercial
risk through the corporate form, be it a single company or a group of
companies owned and controlled by a single person. However, care would have to
be taken to specify who exactly is the proper party to the contract: see B
High House International Pte Ltd v MCDP Phoenix Services Pte Ltd [2023] SGHC
12 at [108]–[109], citing Diane Lumley v Foster & Co Group Ltd and ors [2022]
EWHC 54 (TCC) at [6] and [22].

56 As for the fact that the 2nd Defendant had sought to amend details in the
documents to allow him to prosecute an action against the supplier of the
KN-95 masks using Brilliante HK or Brilliante China, 45

##### Foot Note 45

Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 64(b)(ii).

I did not think that this pointed to the conclusion that the 1st Defendant was
the alter ego of the 2nd Defendant either. Rather, it showed the 2nd
Defendant’s willingness to appropriate the corporate forms of Brilliante HK
and Brilliante China to his own ends. But this did not necessarily mean that
the 2nd Defendant had done the same in relation to the 1st Defendant. It could
not be inferred, from this, that the 1st Defendant was indeed carrying on the
2nd Defendant’s business.

57 In conclusion, the fact that the 2nd Defendant was the sole shareholder and
director of all entities in the Brilliante Group, coupled with this incident
of using the 1st Defendant to pay for sums owed by Brilliante HK, as well as
the 2nd Defendant having considered using Brilliante HK or Brilliante China to
sue the mask manufacturer, did not necessarily mean, without more, that the
1st Defendant was the 2nd Defendant’s alter ego. It bears repeating that the
threshold for veil piercing is a high one which was, in my view, not met.

58 As for the other prong of the Plaintiffs’ argument, that there was a lack
of corporate governance which pointed to the fact that the 1st Defendant was
the alter ego of the 2nd Defendant, I did not find that this was established
on the evidence before me. To support their argument, the Plaintiffs pointed
to the fact that the 2nd Defendant “simply could not or chose not to say
whether Brilliante Singapore had paid a sum of S$463,634.00 (recorded in its
financial statements as related party transactions) to himself, a family
member, or another entity in the Brilliante Group”. 46

It also appeared to me that the 2nd Defendant was evasive in his answers. Even
though counsel for the Plaintiffs had explored the various possibilities as to
where the money had gone, he did not reach a conclusion as the 2nd Defendant’s
reply in each case was that he did not know. Given the state of the evidence,
I did not think it was open to me to infer that the 2nd Defendant must have
taken the money. 48

Unlike Alwie where the court had found that Alwie had treated the company’s
bank accounts as though they were his own, there was no evidence in the
present case to establish that the 2nd Defendant had done the same.

59 I therefore find that the Plaintiffs have not made out a case for the
corporate veil to be lifted on the grounds that the 1st Defendant was the 2nd
Defendant’s alter ego. I turn now to consider the Plaintiffs’ arguments for
lifting the corporate veil on the ground of fraud.

60 While our courts appear to have accepted that fraud is a ground for lifting
the corporate veil (see Lim Chee Twang v Chan Shuk Kuen Helina and others
[2010] 2 SLR 209 at [86]; Sri Jaya (Sendirian) Bhd v RHB Bank Bhd [2000] 3
SLR(R) 365 at [63], citing In re Darby [1911] 1 KB 95; Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra
and others v Salgaocar Anil Vassudeva and others [2018] 5 SLR 689 at [79];
Epoch Minerals Pte Ltd v Raffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd and others
[2021] SGHC 288 at [20]), one problem is that this ground may be too broad,
and if liberally applied, would have the effect of overreaching other
liability rules (eg, in tort, contract and equity): Corporate Law at [06.044].
This observation is usefully illustrated by the Plaintiffs’ argument that the
court will lift the corporate veil on grounds of fraud where the controller of
the company has made “fraudulent misrepresentations to induce a party into
entering a contract with the company he controls”. 49

If it was the Plaintiffs’ complaint that the 2nd Defendant had made fraudulent
representations which had caused them loss, they could very well have brought
an action against him for the same (see Stephen Bull, “Piercing the Corporate
Veil – In England And Singapore” (2014) Singapore Journal of Legal Studies 24
at p 31).

61 Leaving aside the points of law, I find that there is no evidence to
support the Plaintiffs’ allegation that they were the unwitting victims of the
2nd Defendant’s fraudulent scheme. The fraud which the Plaintiffs alleged to
have been victims to in the present case was that the 2nd Defendant had
represented to them that the masks would be procured directly from CTT, when
in actual fact, they were procured from other sources. 50

This showed that the 2nd Defendant never intended for the 1st Defendant to
comply with its contractual obligations, and as a result, the Plaintiffs ended
up with masks which were either fake, or simply defective. To that end, the
Plaintiffs say that the 2nd Defendant had intentionally concealed from the
Plaintiffs the true source of the KN95 masks in that he had told Mr Zeltzer
that the masks were procured directly from the factory when in actual fact,
they were procured from one “Ringo” who was another middleman.

62 While the 2nd Defendant had conceded in cross-examination that he did not
give the Plaintiffs the complete picture and the true source of the masks as
he wanted to get the Plaintiffs to buy the masks from the 1st Defendant, this
did not, in my view, amount to evidence of fraud which the Plaintiffs allege.
I did not think there was anything which suggested that the 2nd Defendant had
cooked up a scheme to defraud the Plaintiffs. The 2nd Defendant’s explanation
that he did this to close the deal between the parties and that there was
nothing more to it was, in my view, part of but not the entire reason as to
why he was not totally forthcoming about the source of the masks. While the
2nd Defendant did expressly admit to this, I was of the view that he concealed
the true source of the masks to prevent Mr Zeltzer from bypassing him and
directly dealing with the source. After all, it was clear from their dealings
that the 2nd Defendant’s role in the transaction was that of a middleman. The
2nd Defendant would risk losing Mr Zelter’s business if he disclosed the true
source of the masks. Any omission on the 2nd Defendant’s part, therefore, was
likely done with a view to protecting his own legitimate business interest.

63 In so far as the Plaintiffs had attempted to discredit the 2nd Defendant’s
testimony, this did not take their case very far. The onus was on them to put
forth evidence demonstrating fraud, and having examined the evidence before
me, I found that there was none. While the Plaintiffs’ expert witness, Mr
Pfriem, had opined that the masks did not come from CTT, I would not place any
reliance on his opinion. I accept the Defendants’ argument that there was no
real basis for him to arrive at this conclusion. 51

64 For the above reasons, I did not find that the 1st Defendant’s corporate
veil should be lifted so as to hold the 2nd Defendant personally liable.

Issue 3: Whether the 2nd Defendant was liable for inducing the 1st Defendant
to breach the Contract

65 Apart from their arguments on lifting the corporate veil, the Plaintiffs
have also argued that the 2nd Defendant should be held personally liable for
the tort of inducing breach of contract. For the Plaintiffs to establish their
case, the following elements of the tort must be shown: that the tortfeasor
knew of the existence of the contract, that the tortfeasor had intended to
interfere with the plaintiff’s contractual rights and had directly procured or
induced a third party to breach the contract, that the contract was breached
and the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the breach: Turf Club Auto
Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal
[2018] 2 SLR 655 at [311], citing Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan
Trading Co Ltd [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [17]–[18]; BGC Partners (Singapore) Ltd
v Yap Yuk Hee and others [2021] SGHC 279 at [61]; Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting
Chong Chai and others [2015] 1 SLR 163 at [285]; Gary Chan, The Law of Torts
in Singapore (2nd Ed, Academy Publishing, 2016) at [15.005] – [15.026].

66 Also of relevance is the rule in Said v Butt [1920] 2 KB 497 (the “Said v
Butt principle”) which the Defendants have relied on in support of their
argument that the 2nd Defendant should not be held personally liable for the
tort of inducing breach of contract. As the Court of Appeal in PT Sandipala
Arthaputra and others v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others
[2018] 1 SLR 818 (“PT Sandipala”) at [62] noted, the Said v Butt principle
should “be interpreted to exempt directors from personal liability for the
contractual breaches of their company (whether through the tort of inducement
of breach of contract or unlawful means conspiracy) if their acts, in their
capacity as directors, are not in themselves in breach of any fiduciary or
other personal legal duties owed to the company”. That being said, it bears
noting that the Said v Butt principle, as interpreted in PT Sandipala,
operates as a requirement of liability and not a defence: PT Sandipala at
[65]; see also Jarret Huang “Reformulating the Rules on Director Liability
Exclusions in Said v Butt” (2018) 30 SAcLJ 1110 at [14]. As the court in PT
Sandipala noted (at [65]), the onus is therefore on the plaintiff to “prove
that the defendant-directors’ acts were in breach of their personal legal
duties to the company – [s]uch breach may be a breach of a fiduciary duty to
act in the best interests of the company, or it may be a breach of his
contractual duty towards the company to act within the scope of his authority
as granted by the company”.

67 In this connection, the Defendants have argued that the Plaintiffs have
failed to plead that the “2nd Defendant [had] breached any of his duties owed
to the 1st Defendant”. 52

Defendants’ Joint Closing Submissions at para [171(b)].

Given what the Court of Appeal had said in PT Sandipala, there is merit to the
Defendants’ submissions on this point. Care should be taken to plead with
specificity as to which personal legal duty to the company the director is
said to be in breach of.

68 Beyond the technical issue of pleadings, however, I did not find that the
2nd Defendant should be personally liable for the tort of inducing breach of
contract. Key to establishing this tort is that the 2nd Defendant must have
intended the breach of contract. As was noted in Zim Integrated Shipping
Services Ltd and others v Dafni Igal and others [2010] 2 SLR 426 at [19],
citing OBG v Allan [2008] 1 AC 1 at [39]:

Useful clarification as to what the second element of intention relates to can
be found in the following observations of Lord Hoffman in OBG v Allan [2008] 1
AC 1 (“OBG”) at [39]:

To be liable for inducing breach of contract, you must know that you are
inducing a breach of contract. It is not enough that you know that you are
procuring an act which, as a matter of law or construction of the contract, is
a breach. You must actually realize that it will have this effect. Nor does it
matter that you ought reasonably to have done so. This proposition is most
strikingly illustrated by the decision of this House in British Industrial
Plastics Ltd v Ferguson [1940] 1 All ER 479, in which the plaintiff’s former
employee offered the defendant information about one of the plaintiff’s secret
processes which he, as an employee, had invented. The defendant knew that the
employee had a contractual obligation not to reveal trade secrets but held the
eccentric opinion that if the process was patentable, it would be the
exclusive property of the employee. He took the information in the honest
belief that the employee would not be in breach of contract. In the Court of
Appeal [1938] 4 All ER 504, 513, MacKinnon LJ observed tartly that in
accepting this evidence the judge had ‘vindicated his honesty … at the expense
of his intelligence’ but he and the House of Lords agreed that he could not be
held liable for inducing a breach of contract. [emphasis added]

It is therefore clear that the plaintiffs must show that the defendant(s) in
question knew that it was procuring a breach of Captain Dafni’s Employment
Agreement. It would not be sufficient merely to show that the acts committed
by the defendant had the effect of doing so.

[emphasis added]

69 I find that, on the evidence, the Plaintiffs had not proven that the 2nd
Defendant had intended to procure the 1st Defendant’s breach of contract. The
Plaintiffs have tried to argue that the 2nd Defendant knew that it was a term
of the Contract that the masks were to be procured directly from CTT, and that
the 2nd Defendant had intended to procure the 1st Defendant’s breach of
contract by not directly purchasing the masks from CTT, but from a middleman
called “Ringo” instead. The problem with the Plaintiffs’ argument is that they
did not appear to have pleaded that it was a term of the Contract that the
masks were to be procured directly from CTT. All that was alleged in their
statement of claim, in so far as the source of the KN95 masks was concerned,
was that the masks were to be “manufactured by a manufacturer registered” with
the US FDA. 53

Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) at para 5(b).

Even with such a pleading, I did not find on the evidence that it was a term
of the Contract that the masks were to be directly procured from CTT. As I had
explained above (at [27]), while Mr Zeltzer was only interested in making a
quick buck, he was at the very least, concerned enough to stipulate that they
had to be of a certain quality to clear the import checks, although he
certainly did not go so far as to specifically state that the masks were to be
purchased from CTT. Indeed, the inference which I drew from the evidence was
that the 2nd Defendant was keen on continuing to do business with Mr Zeltzer.
The WhatsApp messages between both men showed that the 2nd Defendant was not
only responsive to Mr Zeltzer’s requests, but was also eager to sell other
products to Mr Zeltzer. It was difficult to imagine that the 2nd Defendant
would have wished deliberately to jeopardise what, at the time, appeared to be
a rather lucrative business relationship by deliberately inducing the 1st
Defendant to breach the Contract with the Plaintiffs.

70 In summary, I find that the Plaintiffs’ claim against the 2nd Defendant for
inducing the 1st Defendant’s breach of contract, must fail.

Conclusion

71 In the circumstances, I allowed the Plaintiffs’ claim against the 1st
Defendant for breach of contract, and dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim against
the 2nd Defendant. The 1st Defendant is to pay the Plaintiffs the sum of
US$3,254,673.28. The 1st Defendant shall also pay interest at 5.33% on this
sum of US$3,254,673.28, and interest shall run from 22 June 2021 (being the
date the masks were discarded) 54
