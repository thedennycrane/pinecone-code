_**Delivered by Chao Hick Tin JA**_

1 This was the appellant Yeoh Aik Wei’s (Yeoh) appeal against his conviction
on a capital charge of the unauthorized import of a controlled drug, namely,
327.59 grams of diamorphine, for which offence he was sentenced to death. We
heard the appeal on 20 January 2003 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.

**The facts**

2 The facts of the case were largely not in dispute. At all material times,
Yeoh resided in Johore but worked in Singapore. Thus, he commuted almost daily
between the two countries. On 7 March 2002, at the early hour of 00.45 am, the
appellant drove a Malaysian-registered Honda car from Johore into Singapore
and stopped at the Woodlands Checkpoint. The duty officer, Cpl Yeo Kia Huat,
inspected the boot of the car and found four newspaper-covered bundles in the
well for the spare tyre. When questioned, Yeoh told Cpl Yeo that he did not
know what they contained. As instructed, Yeoh then opened up the four bundles
and they were found to contain some granular substance. Thereafter, he was
placed under arrest.

3 Narcotics sniffer dogs were soon brought to the scene and they sniffed out
four more bundles, two each on the left and the right sides of the boot of the
car. Yeoh remained calm throughout the period from the time when Cpl Yeo
checked the boot until the last four bundles were sniffed out.

4 At 2.50am, ASP Omar Ali Saifudeen of the Central Narcotics Bureau, who had
arrived earlier at the scene, asked Yeoh some questions. He recorded the
questions and answers in his pocket book and Yeoh signed against that
recording. The gist of his answers was that he was asked by one "Tua Pui" to
drive the car to Singapore for which he was to be paid $200/-. He said the
things in the bundles were drugs. However, he later explained that he gave
such an answer because he merely repeated what one of the policemen, who
uncovered the bundles, said that they were.

5 In his s 122(6) statement recorded later that morning, Yeoh stated that he
had nothing to say. In his s 121 statement taken from him in the afternoon, at
about 3.05pm, Yeoh opened up and gave the following account. He owed a debt of
RM$2,000 to a loan shark by the name of Tua Pui who, on the morning of 6 March
2002, gave him an ultimatum to either drive a car containing a package to
Singapore or pay up the entire loan forthwith. That day, he came to work in
Singapore as usual. In the course of the day, having given thought to the
demand made by Tua Pui, he decided that he would do the latter’s bidding. At
about 11.30pm, having returned to Johore after work, he met Tua Pui at the
Mavesta Apartments. Tua Pui passed on to him a car key, a mobile phone with a
phone number already keyed-in and two SIM cards. He was instructed to call
that keyed-in number on his arrival in Singapore. As he knew that Tua Pui was
a drug dealer involved in the sale of Ecstasy tablets, he thought that what he
was asked to transport to Singapore were also Ecstasy tablets.

6 At the time of his arrest, a handwritten note in Chinese was found on Yeoh.
He admitted writing the note but denied that it was a "farewell" note. We
shall return to this note in a moment as it was germane to the defence raised
by Yeoh.

7 No finger prints of Yeoh were found on any of the wrappings of the eight
bundles. The substance in the eight bundles was later established to contain
327.59 grams of diamorphine.

**Decision below**

8 In his defence at the trial, Yeoh repeated the assertion made in his s 121
statement that he did not know it was diamorphine that he was bringing into
Singapore. He thought it was Ecstasy tablets.

9 In view of the presumptions raised in ss 21 and 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs
Act (MDA), the burden fell on Yeoh to show, on the balance of probabilities,
that he lacked such knowledge. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge found
that the presumption had not been rebutted because:-

> (i) There were material discrepancies between his testimony in court and
> what he said in his statements;
>
> (ii) The handwritten note was a farewell note;
>
> (iii) In the light of the suspicious circumstances, there was deliberate
> turning of a blind eye on the part of Yeoh as to what was in the car that he
> was driving into Singapore.

**Appeal**

10 Before us, counsel for Yeoh submitted that the trial judge erred in fact
and in law by holding that Yeoh knew it was diamorphine he was importing. He
argued that the trial judge failed to give sufficient consideration to the
following points:-

> (i) That at the Mavesta Apartments compound, Tua Pui in answer to Yeoh’s
> query said that there was _one_ package containing Ecstasy tablets in the
> car and that it was not diamorphine.
>
> (ii) The fact that Yeoh omitted certain facts in his statements could not
> mean that his claim, that he did not know he was importing diamorphine,
> could not be true.
>
> (iii) That Yeoh was not guilty of "Nelsonian" knowledge because he was
> assured by Tua Pui that the package only contained Ecstasy tablets and was
> told by Tua Pui not to know where the package was kept and neither should he
> look for it in the car.
>
> (iv) That the handwritten note was not a "farewell" note as Yeoh did not
> have death in mind. He was concerned that if he were caught transporting the
> Ecstasy tablets into Singapore, he would land himself in jail and would not
> know what to expect.
>
> (v) That it was wrong of the trial judge to attribute guilt just because
> Yeoh had remained calm throughout the period when the eight packages were
> uncovered in the car.

**Our consideration**

11 We propose to deal with these grounds in turn, but in relation to grounds
(i) and (ii) we shall consider them together as they are inextricably linked.
We would, at this juncture, set out the facts which Yeoh omitted to mention in
his statements and which he only alleged at the trial:-

> (i) He was afraid that Tua Pui would kill him if he could not repay his debt
> as Tua Pui had previously said that he had arranged for loan defaulters to
> be knocked down by vehicles.
>
> (ii) He once had a conversation with Tua Pui in which the latter told him
> that trafficking in Ecstasy would not attract the death penalty.
>
> (iii) While Tua Pui was handing the car key over to him at the compound of
> Mavesta Apartments, Yeoh had asked and was told by Tua Pui that there was
> only one packet of Ecstasy tablets in the car and that trafficking in
> Ecstasy would not attract the death penalty in Singapore. He said he knew
> what the penalty in Singapore for trafficking in diamorphine was and would
> not have agreed to indulge in that.

12 Yeoh sought to explain to the court why these facts were omitted in his
statements. Basically, what he said was that he was so shocked and confused
when he realized what he had carried in the car that he forgot everything. He
also did not mention being coerced into trafficking the drugs as he was not
questioned by the officers about that. As for him saying nothing in his s
122(6) statement, again he said he was so shocked to be charged for
trafficking in diamorphine instead of Ecstasy tablets that he did not know
what to say.

13 The trial judge did not accept these explanations. Neither did we. If it
were true that Yeoh was being deceived by Tua Pui, and we accept that he could
thereby be shocked, that should not have prevented him from stating the true
position. The truth would have come out naturally. There should be no
necessity for anyone to prompt Yeoh to tell the truth. There was a gap of some
7-8 hours before he was asked to give his s 122(6) statement, and there was an
even longer lapse of time before he gave his s 121 statement. The fact that it
was not mentioned then, and only some months later at the trial, clearly
smacked of an afterthought. If, in fact, he was fooled by Tua Pui, then,
following the shock, there should have been anger and he would have disclosed
all that in his s 122(6) statement instead of having nothing to say. His
silence was certainly hard to fathom. In our view, it was a case of being
caught red-handed and he had really nothing to say.

14 Turning to ground (iii), we do not think it is possible to set out all the
factors that would be sufficient to warrant an inference that an accused
person has turned a blind eye. An issue such as this is not amenable to
precise elucidation. Much would depend on the circumstances of each case. The
most obvious considerations would include the background of the person who
handed over the goods to the accused and their previous dealings, and, whether
there was an opportunity for the accused to inspect the package. One really
cannot generalise and even with regard to each pertinent factor, the weight
which the court should give to it may well vary in the light of other
circumstances: compare _PP v Hla Win_ [1995] 2 SLR 424 with _Yeo Choon Huat v
PP_ [1998] 1 SLR 217. Even in a case where the accused had no opportunity to
inspect, if the circumstances were obviously suspicious, and he could have
rejected the request to carry the package, then the latter would be a relevant
consideration.

15 The circumstances of the present case were so suspicious that any
reasonable person, knowing that trafficking in diamorphine would attract the
capital punishment, would naturally have probed more into what he was being
asked to carry. All the more so when, according to Yeoh, Tua Pui had
threatened him. In any event, the written note of Yeoh confirmed that in
Yeoh’s own mind, he realized that in undertaking the task for Tua Pui, it
could very well be his last journey.

16 This brings us to ground (iv). In order to appreciate whether the note was
or was not a farewell note, it is necessary that we set it out in full. We
should add that it was written in Chinese and the following is the translation
–

> "When you all read this letter, I may have left you all forever. Don’t feel
> sorry for me. I have no regret over this. I am tired of walking the journey
> of life. I have lost my joy, satisfaction or happiness.

> A most joyful event in life is to have a partner truly in love with you. As
> for me, I am always a failure. I have let my past love slip and lost it
> forever. I truly regret, upset and feel sorry. Superficially, I appear as if
> nothing has happened but I do care about this love. Please call 04-6437924
> and send my regards to Hui Min. I was in the wrong in the past. I indulged
> in gambling and neglected her. I lost all my money and no surprise that she
> left me. I heard that she would be getting married, is it true?

> Whenever I see lovers going in pairs, I am envious of them because they are
> blessed with love of bliss and they know how to treasure each other.

> In life, I do not know how to treasure kinship and friendship. I have lost
> your zeal in doing anything nor bother to show any concern. Sorry to say
> that kinship and friendship are very hypocritical. When you are rich, people
> will befriend you and when you are poor, people will despise you. May be I
> was a bit stupid without realising that all of you care for me.

> I feel excited on the very thought of leaving this painful world. It is like
> freeing myself from such agony. I can give up fame and gain, the gay and
> material world and finally leave in peace.
>
> Please tell my 3 bosom friends that I am leaving.
>
> 1\. Lok Lok (Johor)
>
> 2\. Boon Lee (Johor)
>
> 3\. Chee Ping (Sp)"

17 Much as Yeoh tried to explain why he wrote the note, we were unable, like
the judge below, to accept the meaning he sought to place on it at the trial.
He said, having made up his mind to undertake the task for Tua Pui, he
realized that if he were caught he would be put in jail. He did not know what
to expect in jail, not having previously served any prison term. He explained
that the words "leaving this painful world" in the note meant "going to
prison". This explanation was extremely tenuous if not incredible. It
contradicted the plain words of the note – "when you all read this letter I
may have left you all forever"; "I feel excited on the thought of leaving this
painful world"; "leave in peace". It is true that he moaned about his failure
in his love life. But it seemed to us clear that the entire tenor of the note
was that he was prepared to die, writing it after having made up his mind to
help Tua Pui drive the car into Singapore. This could only be because he
appreciated that, if he were caught by the authorities in Singapore, he would
most likely face a capital charge and the death penalty.

18 Turning to ground (v), while the fact that a potential accused remains calm
in the face of incriminating evidence being uncovered need not necessarily
suggest he is guilty, in the context of the defence raised by Yeoh, that it
was only Ecstasy tablets that he was being asked to transport, his conduct of
remaining calm was certainly inexplicable. Ordinarily such a person would
have, either by words or action, expressed shock and disgust at being so
betrayed or made use of. We accept that how a person would react to such a
situation may vary from individual to individual. If this were the only or
main ground upon which the trial judge had relied upon to conclude that Yeoh
was guilty of the charge, we would have hesitated in affirming it. But when
this consideration was viewed together with the other considerations dealt
with above, the finding of guilt which the court below had made was really
inevitable.

19 Section 21 of the Act provides that if any controlled drug is found in any
vehicle "it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the
possession … of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time being". Under
s 18(2), any person who is proved or presumed to have a controlled drug in his
possession shall, "until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the
nature of the drug". So the burden clearly fell on Yeoh to rebut the
presumption of knowledge, on the balance of probabilities.

20 In the circumstances of this case, not only was there nothing to suggest
that the judge was wrong to hold that the presumption of knowledge was not
rebutted, it was our opinion that he was correct in coming to that conclusion.
The considerations alluded to above overwhelmingly showed that Yeoh knew what
he was carrying for Tua Pui into Singapore. He was mentally prepared, as
evidenced by his handwritten note, for the ultimate sanction in law should he
be caught in the act. There was simply no doubt in the matter.

21 In the result, the appeal had to be dismissed.
