** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The plaintiffs and the first defendant were friends and shareholders in
the second defendant ("Genisys") a company incorporated to provide coordinated
mechanical and electrical contracts for main contractors of building
contracts. The company became a success, and like many success stories its
rise also marked the falling out of its members. The plaintiffs commenced an
action against the first defendant who was the majority shareholder, in
Originating Summons No. 1902 of 1999, for relief against oppression of the
minority shareholders. The parties, however, reached a settlement after two
days’ trial before Rajendran J, and consent judgment was entered on 7 July
2000. By that judgement, the first defendant agreed to purchase the
plaintiffs’ shares in Genisys. The price was based on an agreed formula, and
fixed at 47% of the value of Genisys as at 11 August 1999. The value of the
company's shares had therefore to be ascertained. The formula and way in which
the shares were to be valued were also agreed under the terms of the consent
judgment. By a further order of court dated 24 May 2001, Don Ho Mun Tuke was
appointed as the valuer. The resulting conclusion of the valuer was that the
first defendant was to pay the plaintiffs the sum of $1,694,199.60 being 47%
of the value ($3,604,883.00) of Genisys as at 11 August 1999\. The plaintiffs
believed that the valuation was not properly carried out because the first
defendant had deliberately withheld material information from the valuer and
misled him with inaccurate ones.

2\. Consequently, the plaintiffs commenced a fresh claim by way of a writ
action against the same defendants. This time, the action was based on fraud
in that they allege, broadly speaking, that the first defendant who controlled
Genisys caused fraudulent information to be created and given to the valuer,
or otherwise withheld material information from him, with the purpose and
intention of misleading him and thereby caused him to undervalue the assets of
Genisys. The plaintiffs made various interlocutory applications for discovery
but were thwarted by the first defendants refusal to cooperate or obey the
discovery orders in letter and spirit. At the end of their tether, the
plaintiffs applied to the assistant registrar to strike out the defence on the
ground that they had contumaciously and continuously failed to comply with the
discovery orders of the assistant registrar made on 9 July 2001, which also
aggregated previous discovery orders. The assistant registrar declined to
strike out the defence and the plaintiffs appealed before me against that
refusal.

3\. At the heart of the dispute over discovery are documents described as
Balance Budget Summaries ("BBS"). These are hard copies of documents
containing budget summaries in respect of any given project of Genisys. Each
BBS is a mine of information about the nature, costs, and profitability of the
company in respect of the project stated in the summary. The BBS, however, are
not a stack of documents kept in the cabinets or drawers of the company. The
information that each BBS carries is stored in the database of the company’s
computers. They are fed in, stored, edited, and retrieved as the case may be
at any moment by means of a sophisticated programme known as "IMIX", the
acronym for _Integrated Management Information System_. It is therefore vital
to any party who wishes to ascertain the true worth of the company that the
IMIX disgorges all the information from the data pool into the printed BBS. By
the same token, it is naturally important to anyone who wishes to prevent that
kind of information from surfacing, to manipulate IMIX so that it regurgitates
only choice bits for print.

4\. It will first be helpful to consider what the orders of 9 July 2001 were.
For convenience I shall set out the material terms here:

> "1. The 1st Defendant shall file and serve a _comprehensive_ list of

5\. It can be inferred from the tone and form (from the repeated use of the
word "comprehensive" in the same phrase in order 1) as well as the specificity
of the rest of the above orders that the assistant registrar must have agreed
with plaintiffs' vehement complaint that a previous order for discovery made
on 9 April 2001 was not fully complied with. The first order of 9 April
required that –

> "the first defendant provides the _complete_ Balance Budget Summaries for
> all the three PWD projects under items B and C of paragraph 27 of the first
> plaintiff's 15th affidavit filed on 2 November 2000 in OS 1902 of 1999
> showing the total alleged loss of S$5.7 million, _as well as the latest
> available updated complete BBS as at 13 February 2001_ " (my emphasis).

It is also noted that the discovery orders made by the assistant registrar
were in addition to orders made by Rajendran J on 13 February 2001 which were
not complied with. Mr. Chong submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
closest BBS to that on 13 February 2001 was 5 January 2001 for the simple
reason that the data in the data pool changes all the time. The previous data
merges with the new each time it is edited. Hence, if no one printed a hard
copy on 13 February, as was the case alleged by the defendants, they had no
hard copy of that date. In the event, the nearest hard copy was the one
printed on 5 January 2001. The BBS is thus aptly described as a 'snapshot' of
the current status of the project's budget at the time it was generated.

6\. The first defendant asserts in his affidavits that he had provided all the
documents that were required of him. In this regard, I shall be brief because
I do not for the moment think it necessary to set out the numerous disputes as
to what exactly it was that the first defendant actually affirmed and what he
did not. The arguments concerning that aspect have been noted but should not
detain us here. The plaintiffs’ complaint in the appeal before me is that the
first defendant had either deliberately masked, or edited out, or simply
refused to produce the full and true information in the data pool from which
the BBS’s were produced. Secondly, they allege that it was obvious from the
BBS themselves that the defendants must be or have been in possession of
supporting or source documents from which the information fed into the data
pool must originally have been set out. These documents (which may be referred
to as either supporting or source documents) were not produced.

7\. Mr. Randolf Khoo, counsel for the plaintiffs, meticulously and very
patiently took me through a labyrinthine trail of documents to establish why
he says that the first defendant had not complied with the orders for
discovery. The first and basic point counsel made was that it is
inconceivable, taking into account the type and size of the company that
Genisys is, and the nature of its work and projects that no record is kept of
the supporting or source documents. I agree with this submission entirely, and
in my view, there is more than a reasonable suspicion that such documents must
have existed and continue to exist. In this regard, Mr. Khoo emphasized that
the defendants have not deposed anywhere in their affidavits that the
documents no longer exist because they have either been shredded or otherwise
disposed. I am also inclined to infer on a balance of probabilities that such
documents cannot be destroyed without making it impossible for the company's
auditors to conduct their audit. Furthermore, it will be seen that the three
major projects, which included that with the Traffic Police Department are
major and complex projects that involved many different contractors and sub-
contractors that it is indeed remarkable that not a single source document was
produced.

8\. Next, Mr. Khoo went beyond pure theory to the specifics of non-disclosure
based on what is apparent from the face of the BBS that had been produced.
First, he pointed out that in the BBS of 3 August 2000 at page 386 of the
first plaintiff's seventh affidavit the sub-headings of variation works are
captured and printed but on the 5 January 2001 copy (ordered to be produced)
the variation works had obviously been edited out; but only from the heading
for it did not escape the scrutiny of the plaintiffs and their counsel that a
sum of $710,131 appeared in the details. Counsel also referred to the first
defendant's disclosure, in purported compliance, by setting out 12
"Provisional Budgets" said to be the latest budgets; but Mr. Khoo quickly
pointed out that the documents available and disclosed showed that there were
at least 156 variations that were not evident from the latest budgets. I am
inclined to agree that with such massive and major changes that it is
impossible to have no record of the source or supporting documents. I will not
retrace the steps Mr. Khoo took me through in demonstrating that such changes
must and do eventually show in the BBS unless they are edited out - save to
mention briefly, that one of the many examples counsel had in hand was an item
entitled E4001 involving $40,072 at page 282 of the BBS exhibited in the first
plaintiff's seventh affidavit. This item appears to have been overlooked by
the defendants. It is a budget revision request corresponding to the item in
the BBS at page 382 of the same affidavit. Its existence calls in question all
other such documents which were noticeably missing. Next, Mr. Khoo drew my
attention to the non-disclosure concerning the contracts of the second
defendant's subsidiary in Malaysia ("UEG"). Again, Mr. Khoo laboriously
demonstrated that there were material non-disclosure of source documents by
the defendants in respect of the UEG records.

9\. With the facts overwhelmingly against him, Mr. Chong did what a good
counsel would have done in the circumstances - he mounted a formidable
argument on the law. His basic position, relying on the Supreme Court Practice
(1999 White Book 24/7/2 at page 471), is that at the interlocutory stage the
court ought to accept a party's affidavit as final and conclusive; and if the
deponent says that whatever he did not produce he did not, or no longer have,
his word must not be contravened - at least until trial. One major plank of
Mr. Chong's argument was that if an "unless order" for disclosure based on
reasonable suspicion is made, the fundamental principle of the burden of proof
based on a balance of probabilities will be plainly ignored. Counsel argued
that if a defence is struck out because the defendant did not comply with the
"unless order" then it would have been struck out based on just a reasonable
suspicion. The reference to "reasonable suspicion" is an allusion to Cotton
LJ's opinion in _Lyell v Kennedy_ [1884] 27 Ch d 1, 20, that a court may order
further discovery if it had a reasonable suspicion that there are further
documents to be discovered. This lighter test is clearly intended for a
different purpose, that is to allow further discovery. Different
considerations apply when a court is minded to make an "unless order". It must
be assumed that the court is fully aware that a claim or defence may be struck
out if the order is not carried out - hence the title "unless order". It has
nothing to do with the burden of proof in respect of the merits of the case.
It is the compelling force behind a coercive order. Why and when such orders
are necessary depend on the individual situation. I now revert to the issue
that Mr. Chong's argument addresses, that is, whether the deponent's affidavit
verifying his list of documents shall be regarded as conclusive. I must agree
with counsel that generally, such affidavits cannot be contravened by other
contentious affidavits and shall not be subject to cross-examination. The
reasons for this, as Stuart-Smith LJ pointed out in _Fayed & Ors v Lonrho Plc_
(The Times 24 June 1993), are plain. Affidavits raised in such circumstances
do not address the issues for trial and whether the deponent is truthful or
not in respect of the discovery of documents he might still persuade the trial
judge of the merits of his case through other evidence. Stuart-Smith LJ put
his view thus:

> "If I am wrong in holding that the statement in an affidavit of documents is
> conclusive, so that the court has no power to order cross-examination, the
> exercise of that power should in my judgment be reserved for those cases
> where the existence or non-existence of the document raises a discreet issue
> which does not impinge to any serious extent on the issues in the action."

It should be noted Mr. Khoo had accepted from the outset that he was not
seeking a cross-examination of the first defendant.

10\. Mr. Khoo relied on two authorities for the proposition that the court may
strike out a defence if it is satisfied that the defendant had failed to
comply with a discovery order. The first was _British Association Of Glass
Manufacturers Ltd v Nettlefold_ [1912] 1 K B 369, 377. In that case, Farwell
LJ answered the pertinent question as follows:

> "Is there any grounds from the contents of that document, which has thus
> become part of the affidavit of documents, for saying that something further
> is obviously omitted? In my opinion there clearly is; it was decided by this
> court in _Kent Coal Concessions Ltd v Duguid_ [1910] 1 K B 904, which was
> affirmed in the House Of Lords, that it is allowable for the Court to draw
> inferences and say, as in that case, 'Here is a balance-sheet; a balance-
> sheet necessarily implies the existence of books of account from which that
> balance sheet was made up; those books so far as they were used to make up
> the balance-sheet, are relevant because the balance-sheet is admitted to be
> relevant, and therefore they must be produced'".

Counsel quickly pointed out that this is exactly the situation we have here.
He submitted that the BBS were clearly regarded as relevant. I am in full
agreement. The BBS are detailed summaries of the financial position of the
company and summaries cannot exist without source documents. To bolster his
argument, Mr. Khoo referred to _Manilal & Sons Pte Ltd v Bhupendra KJ Shan_
[1989] SLR 1182. Before proceeding further, it should be noted that that case
is unusual in that the parties there agreed to a cross-examination of the
deponent, and it was the oral evidence of the deponent that exposed his
concealment of relevant documents. Notwithstanding that, the principle
emanating from that case is that where the court is satisfied from the
documents produced that other documents must exist, the party concerned must
either produce them or explain on oath what has become of them so that the
contest at trial will be open and fair.

11\. The two lines of cases relied upon by Mr. Khoo and Mr. Chong respectively
are not difficult to reconcile._Fayed v Lonrho_ represent the general
principle whereas _Nettlefold_ represent the exception. It is the application
to facts of individual cases, however, that tend to give rise to difficulties.
For example, in the _Fayed_ case the documents sought were also source
documents, and in some ways similar to the applications in the present appeal.
The actual issue in _Fayed_ however, concerned the decision of the judge to
grant an order for cross-examination of the deponents in respect their
affidavits. Nonetheless, Stuart-Smith LJ further held that a claim or defence
ought not to be struck out under O 24 r 16 "except on clear and uncontested
evidence, either as a result of an admitted breach, or because the breach can
be ascertained from the party's own documents, affidavits or pleadings". On
this score, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have amply demonstrated,
through their counsel, the numerous obvious omissions of documents that must
surely exist, or to be more precise, have existed. If they are no longer in
the defendants' possession a reasonable explanation ought to have been given
but no explanation was given by them. In my view, therefore, the plaintiffs
have made out a sufficient case to strike out the defence.

12\. In the circumstances, I will allow the appeal. The question is, ought I
to strike out the defence? Reiterating what I had just stated above, having
regard to the long record of non-compliance, the plaintiffs, are in my
opinion, are entitled to strike out the defence by reason of this last round
of non-compliance. The record shows that the defendants only produced a
flourish of inchoate and incomplete documents each time a court order is made
against them. The record also shows that the orders were made after spirited
and long arguments that seem to indicate the tenacity of the defendants in
preventing relevant documents from being disclosed. However, since a striking
out, particularly of a defence, is a draconian measure, I shall grant the
defendants a final act of kindness. I therefore hereby make an unless order in
terms of prayer 2 of the plaintiffs' appeal in RA 37 of 2002 with a variation
only in terms of the time for performance from seven days to 14 days. The
costs here and below are to be taxed if not agreed, and paid by the defendants
to the plaintiffs.
