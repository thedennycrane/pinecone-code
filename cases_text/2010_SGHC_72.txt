Choo Han Teck J:

1 Muhammad Rismail Bin Zali (“respondent”) pleaded guilty to one charge of
abetting by intentionally aiding one “Ah Tan” to facilitate an unlicensed
moneylending business by opening a DBS bank account under his name and
allowing the said account to be used by the said “Ah Tan”, punishable under s
8(1)(b)(i) of the now repealed Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed) read
with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The respondent consented
to having another similar charge being taken into consideration.

2 On 26 November 2009, the court below sentenced the respondent to seven
months imprisonment. The public prosecutor (“appellant”) appealed against the
sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate, and requested for a
sentence of reformative training instead. The learned deputy public prosecutor
submitted on behalf of the appellant that a seven month imprisonment term was
too short given that the respondent was engaged in syndicated moneylending, a
serious offence which was harmful to society in general.

3 The statement of facts was very brief and gave no indication that the
respondent was indeed part of a larger moneylending syndicate. There was
simply nothing in the statement of facts to show that the respondent had
participated or intended to participate in the activities of any unlicensed
moneylending syndicate. Thus, the fact that the abetted moneylending
activities were syndicated in nature did not amount to an aggravating factor
which would justify a longer sentence. It was not necessary for me to discuss
what constituted a ‘syndicate’ in this case.

4 The appellant further submitted that a sentence of reformative training,
which was of a minimum duration of 18 months, would be the more appropriate
sentence because it would achieve the twin effects of rehabilitation and
deterrence. While the respondent had been certified to be suitable for
reformative training, I am of the view that reformative training would not be
appropriate in this case. In the exercise of its discretion to sentence the
respondent, the court below seemed to have taken the respondent’s youth as
well as the absence of antecedents into account. The respondent would be
commencing his national service after his imprisonment. That would enable him
to develop more discipline and character. I am thus satisfied that the court
below had taken into consideration all relevant factors in passing the
sentence of imprisonment.

5 I therefore dismiss the appeal.
