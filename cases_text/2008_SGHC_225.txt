Lee Seiu Kin J:

1 On 11 September 2008, after hearing counsel for the plaintiff and the
defendant (“the parties”) on the issues of division of matrimonial properties
and maintenance, I made the following order (“the Order”):

(a) I award the plaintiff 35% of the matrimonial assets on a global basis,
with distribution as follows:

(i) Matrimonial home to be sold in open market and proceeds net of bank loan
and costs of sale to be divided in the ratio 35:65 to plaintiff and defendant,
each party to be liable for his/her refund to the Central Provident Fund Board
(“CPF”).

(ii) Apartment at X to be sold in open market and proceeds net of costs of
sale to be divided in the ratio 35:65 to plaintiff and defendant.

(iii) Defendant to pay $923,000 to plaintiff.

(iv) Plaintiff to transfer her share, interest and title in the Housing
Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Y to the defendant.

(v) Defendant to procure the assignment to the plaintiff of 35% of the debt
owed to him by company A (amount: $1,164,414.53).

(vi) Parties to keep for themselves the remaining matrimonial assets that are
in their own names as follows: defendant’s shareholdings in companies,
defendant’s bank account, defendant’s CPF, defendant’s Central Depository Pte
Ltd (“CDP”) shares, plaintiff’s bank account, plaintiff’s unit trusts,
plaintiff’s CPF.

(b) I award maintenance of $1,500 per month on the basis of plaintiff’s $5,000
expenses but disallowing the $1,200 for endowment insurance and deducting her
income of $2,300.

(c) Costs to the plaintiff to be paid by the defendant to be agreed or taxed.

2 On 8 October 2008, the plaintiff, who is the wife, appealed against the part
of the Order providing that “the matrimonial home be sold in open market and
proceeds net of bank loan and costs of sale to be divided in the ratio of
35:65 to the plaintiff and defendant respectively, and each party to be liable
for his or her refund to CPF”. As this part of the decision has to be seen in
the context of the Order as a whole pertaining to the division of matrimonial
assets, I shall give the grounds of decision for the entirety of that part of
the Order.

3 The plaintiff is 44 years of age and the defendant 53 years. They were
married in 1989. They have three children, who were born in 1991, 1993 and
1996. The plaintiff obtained interim judgment on an uncontested basis to
dissolve the marriage on in 2006, after nearly 17 years of marriage. Through
mediation, the parties were able to agree as to custody, care and control of
the children and to their maintenance. The parties have shared custody of the
children with the plaintiff having care and control and the defendant entitled
to liberal access. The defendant agreed to an order to pay $5,000 monthly
towards the children’s maintenance. The defendant would also continue to pay
the premiums on various insurance policies that had been taken out in respect
of each of the three children prior to the divorce. These premiums total
$19,445 annually.

4 The defendant is a director of company A, company B and company C. He
receives income from all three companies which total about $16,000 per month.

5 After she married, the plaintiff was employed in one of the defendant’s
companies, company A, doing up its accounts. In addition, the plaintiff was
looking after the accounts of company B. The plaintiff was paid a monthly
salary of $2,319 by company A. She made use of her salary to pay for household
expenses like groceries and tuition fees for the children. However the
plaintiff’s expenses charged to her credit cards are paid by the defendant.
These average about $3,400 per month.

6 In addition to working at company A and company B, the plaintiff had taken
care of the home and the needs of the children. All three children are on
medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and the plaintiff was
the primary parent to them as the defendant was often absent. The plaintiff
continues to work in company A, although on a part time basis from 2005 in
order to better care for the children. The plaintiff stated that the main
reason for breakdown of the marriage was the defendant’s association with
another woman with whom he had a child.

7 The first matrimonial home was an HDB flat at Y where the parties lived from
1990 to 2004. It is still owned by the parties and it is presently occupied by
the defendant’s parents. It was paid for by the defendant in full. The second
matrimonial home was at Z which was purchased in 2000 and into which they
moved in 2004. The plaintiff contributed about $80,000 in cash and drew down
from her CPF account the sum of $108,000 to contribute towards the purchase.
The defendant contributed cash of $22,500, drew down the sum of $555,000 from
his CPF account and took out a housing loan for the remainder. To service the
housing loan, each month the defendant drew down $2,000 from his CPF account
and paid another $5,000 in cash.

8 The parties agree on the following valuations for the matrimonial assets
sought to be divided:

**Asset** |  **Market Value** |  **Remarks**  
---|---|---  
Matrimonial home at Z |  $1.4m to $1.8m |  Outstanding loan $1m  
HDB flat at Y |  $200,000 |   
Apartment at X |  $700,000 to $760,000 |   
Defendant’s shares in various  
private companies |  $1,300,000 |   
Defendant’s bank accounts |  $1,010,000 |   
Defendant’s CPF |  $254,000 |   
Defendant’s CDP shares |  $159,000 |   
Debt owed to defendant by company A |  $1,164,000 |  Defendant contends  
that this debt is locked up  
Plaintiff’s bank accounts |  $54,000 |   
Plaintiff’s unit trusts |  $15,000 |   
Plaintiff’s CPF |  $86,000 |   
**Total** |  **Approx $5.6m net** |   
  
The parties agree that the plaintiff’s direct contribution to the pool of
matrimonial assets is about 6%.

9 In my view, given the varied nature of the assets, the most expedient manner
of division would be to make a single division of all the assets, and based on
this, to divide each individual asset in the most convenient fashion. Under s
112(2) of the Women’s Charter Act (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed)(“the Act”), I must
have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following
matters:

(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or
work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

(b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for
their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

(c) the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the
family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged
or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

(e) any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and
division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

(f) any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party
in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

(g) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party
(whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or
support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation
or business; and

(h) the matters referred to in s 114 (1) of the Act so far as they are
relevant.

10 In _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ [2007] 3 SLR 520 (“ _Lock Yeng Fun_ ”),
the Court of Appeal awarded a 50:50 distribution of the matrimonial assets.
The parties were married for almost 30 years and had two children who were
independent adults at the time of the divorce. The wife had been a homemaker
from the outset of the marriage (with a short stint of employment when the
husband was retrenched in 1992) while the husband enjoyed a successful career
in banking until he was retrenched in 2000. During his employment, he was
required to be based overseas for substantial periods of time and the wife had
to look after the children on her own. One unusual feature noted by the court
was that the wife never had the assistance of a domestic maid. By squirreling
away her household allowance and investing it, the wife managed to amass a sum
of about $528,000. The husband had investments worth about $230,000. The
matrimonial assets comprised these two sums as well as the matrimonial home, a
house sold for $2.45m. The Court of Appeal ordered the matrimonial assets to
be divided in equal shares. It should be noted that of the total matrimonial
assets of $3,208,000, the wife’s direct contribution was some 16.5%. Another
point to be noted was that the Court of Appeal set aside a lump sum
maintenance award of $60,000 given by the court below in view of the division.

11 The factors in _Lock Yeng Fun_ were stronger in favour of the wife than in
the present case. The marriage there lasted 30 years, and the wife’s direct
contribution was 16.5%, compared to 17 years and 6% respectively in the
present case. Also there is an award of maintenance in the present case
whereas the Court of Appeal had factored the maintenance provision in the
division of the matrimonial assets in _Lock Yeng Fun_. I was therefore of the
view that, in the circumstances of the present case and in view of the scale
of the awards in other comparable situations, the division of 35:65 to
plaintiff and defendant would be just and equitable.
