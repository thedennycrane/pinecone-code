Choo Han Teck J:

1 This was an application by the plaintiffs against their former solicitors
(the defendant) to have two of the latter’s bills of costs taxed. The two
bills were rendered on 24 October 2008 and 31 March 2009 respectively and had
been paid. The third bill rendered on 13 October 2009 was partially paid, and
the fourth bill rendered on 20 November 2009 has not been paid. The plaintiffs
complain that the total costs of the four bills combined were excessive and
amounted to gross over-charging by the defendant.

2 Counsel for the defendant pointed out that the plaintiffs’ application must
be dismissed as against the first two bills because they were rendered more
than 12 months prior to this application. Section 122 of the Legal
Professional Act (Cap 161) provides that

After the expiration of 12 months from the delivery of a bill of costs, or
after payment of the bill, no order shall be made for taxation of a
solicitor’s bill of costs, except upon notice to the solicitor and under
special circumstances to be proved to the satisfaction of the court.

3 Neither Mr Nedumaran, counsel for the plaintiffs, nor the plaintiffs could
show any special circumstances why the first two bills should now be taxed
other than their assertion that the defendant had an agreement with the
plaintiffs that the total bill would be $300,000 and thus the four bills must
be considered as a series of a single bill. That being the case, counsel
submitted, the 12 months limitation did not run until the last bill had been
rendered. Unfortunately, the documents including the exchange of email do not
show that there was such an agreement. I am inclined to agree with Mr Rai that
the defendant had only given an estimate of the costs of what transpired to be
a lengthy and complicated litigation involving the plaintiffs in Suit 743 of
2007. Mr Nedumaran submitted that although there was no agreement in writing,
the defendant had not denied that there was such an agreement. However, from
the affidavit of Mr Rai and his submissions before me, I accept that the
defendant did not accept that there was any agreement on costs. Hence, in the
absence of sufficient proof, I am of the view that no special circumstances
justifying an order for the taxation of the first two bills had been made out.
The plaintiffs are, however, entitled to have the third and fourth bills
taxed.

4 The plaintiffs’ application is therefore dismissed with costs to be taxed if
not agreed.
