production of the bill of lading. The respondent applied for summary judgment
to claim for the balance of the purchase price. The appellants in turn applied
under O 14 r 12 to determine whether, in relation to a straight bill of
lading, the shipowner may deliver the goods to the named consignee without
production of the bill of lading. The judge below held that the appellants
were not entitled to deliver the cargo to the named consignee without
production of the bill of lading and held the appellants liable in conversion
and damages. The appellants appealed against this decision.

**

Held,

**dismissing the appeal:

(1) While a bill of lading, devoid of the characteristic of negotiability, is
substantially similar to a sea waybill, that is not to say that they are the
same. Whilst one cannot indorse a straight bill to transfer constructive
possession of the cargo, it does not necessarily follow that the straight bill
does not impose a contractual term obligating the carrier to require its
production to obtain delivery (see 48).

(2) The issue must be resolved on the basis of contract law and the intention
of the parties. Clear words must be present to imply that the parties intended
the instrument to be treated, in all respects, as if it were a sea waybill and
that its presentation is not necessary for delivery. The fact that the parties
issued the instrument as a bill of lading must mean that they wished to retain
all the other features of the bill of lading, other than the characteristic of
transferability (see 48-50).

(3) From the perspective of the market place, there is much to commend the
rule that presentation of a straight bill of lading is a pre-requisite to
obtaining delivery under it. Such a rule is simple to apply and promotes
certainty (see 51-53).

(4) In respect of a straight bill of lading, the shipowners should only
deliver the cargo against its presentation (see 55).

**Judgment _Cur Adv Vult_**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1 This appeal raises a straightforward, but not an easy question relating to
the carriage of goods by sea. The question is whether, in relation to a
straight bill of lading (BL), making the goods deliverable to a specific
person as consignee, without words importing transferability, such as "to XYZ
or order", the shipowner may deliver the same to XYZ without production of the
BL. There is no decided case on the point and textbook writers are not
unanimous as to what the correct answer is.

2 The court below held that the appellant carrier was not entitled to deliver
the cargo to the named consignee without production of the BL. Accordingly,
Judith Prakash J held the appellant-carrier liable in conversion and damages.
The appellants, APL Co Pte Lte (APL), have appealed against the decision.

**

The facts

**

3 The facts of the case are largely undisputed. The respondent shipper, Mr
Peer Voss, who carried on an automobile business in Germany, offered to sell a
convertible Mercedes Benz motocar (model CLK 320) to a Korean company in
Seoul, Seohwan Trading Co Ltd (Seohwan), at a price of DM108,600. A down-
payment of DM48,500 was made by Seohwan. Following that payment, Mr Voss made
an arrangement with APL to ship the motorcar on board the vessel "Hyundai
General" from Hamburg to Busan, South Korea. The motorcar was loaded onto the
vessel on 28 August 2000.

4 The BL issued for the shipment bore the name of the buyer, Seohwan Trading
Co Ltd, in the box entitled "consignee" but without the words "to order". The
bill also provided that:-

> "A set of three originals of this bill of lading is hereby issued by the
> carrier. Upon surrender to the carrier of any one negotiable bill of lading,
> properly endorsed, all others shall stand void."

5 The three sets of the original BL issued in respect of the shipment were at
all times held by Mr Voss, because the buyer had yet to pay Mr Voss for the
remainder of the purchase price. The only disputed point of fact was whether
Mr Voss had already been paid by the buyer. APL asserted that the payment had
been made.

6 Soon after the vessel arrived at its destination, APL’s office at Busan
released the motorcar to Seohwan without the production of any of the three
sets of the BL. In making the delivery, APL relied upon two documents
furnished by Seohwan. The first was a copy of Mr Voss’ invoice for the balance
sum. The second was a copy of an outgoing cable from the Korean Exchange Bank
to a bank in Frankfurt showing a remittance of DM207,500, purportedly as
payment for the motorcar and another transaction between the parties.

7 In November 2000 Mr Voss wrote to Seohwan demanding payment of the balance
sum. No reply was received. As the balance of the purchase price of the
motorcar was still not paid by mid December 2000, Mr Voss demanded payment of
the same from APL. APL rejected the claim on the ground that they were not
wrong to have delivered the motorcar to Seohwan without the production of the
BL.

8 The present action instituted by Mr Voss against APL was to claim for the
loss of the balance of the purchase price. Mr Voss applied for summary
judgment and APL, in turn, applied under O.14 r 12 for the determination of
the question of law set out in the opening paragraph of this judgment.

**

Classification of bills of lading

**

9 A bill making goods deliverable "to XYZ or order" is an order bill. A bill
making goods deliverable "to XYZ" and nothing more, means that the goods can
only be delivered to XYZ and no one else. XYZ will not have the option of
transferring it to another person. This second kind of bill is known as a
"straight" bill or a "non-order" bill. There is, in fact, a third type of bill
known as the "bearer" bill, which will allow delivery to be made to whomsoever
holds the bill. A "bearer" bill can arise in the following circumstances:-

> (i) if the bill explicitly so declares itself to be one;
>
> (ii) if the name of the consignee is stated as "bearer";
>
> (iii) if it is an order bill but does not mention to whose order it is; or
>
> (iv) if it is an order bill endorsed in blank by the person named in the
> order bill.
>
> (see _Tetley on Marine Cargo Claims, 3 rd Edn_ at 182-3).

10 An order bill is often loosely described as "negotiable". But this word
does not have the same meaning as it bears in relation to a bill of exchange.
The description "negotiable" simply means the bill is transferable; it does
not give to the transferee a better title than what the transferor possesses.
It is not in dispute that the present BL is a straight bill or a non-order
bill.

11 It is trite law that under a BL, which is usually an order bill and is
negotiable, the carrier is under the obligation to deliver the cargo at the
port of destination to the holder of the bill, upon presentation of and under
the terms found in the bill itself. If the cargo is delivered to someone who
does not present the original bill of lading, even if the person is the named
consignee, the carrier will be held answerable for the tort of conversion. In
_Skibsaktieselskapet Thor v Tyrer_ (1929) 35 L. IL. R163 at 170, Wright J
said,

> "It is perfectly clear law that a shipowner who delivers without production
> of the bill of lading does so at his peril."

12 In _Sze Hai Tong Bank v Rambler Cycle Co_ [1959] AC 576 at 586, the Privy
Council held such a delivery to be in breach of contract. Lord Denning said
(at p.586):-

> It is perfectly clear that a shipowner who delivers without production of
> the bill of lading does so at his peril. The contract is to deliver, on
> production of the bill of lading, to the person entitled under the bill of
> lading. … The shipping company did not deliver the goods to any such person.
> They are therefore liable for breach of contract unless there is some term
> in the bill of lading protecting them. And they delivered the goods, without
> production of the bill of lading, to a person who was not entitled to
> receive them. They are, therefore, liable in conversion unless likewise
> protected."

But we hasten to add that in _Sze Hai Tong Bank_ the court was clearly dealing
with a negotiable bill, as it was stated to be "unto order or his or their
assigns".

13 In _Glyn Mills, Currie & Co v East & West India Dock_ (1882) 7 App Cas 591
at 610, Lord Blackburn said that a carrier delivering the goods without the
bill of lading being produced would be in breach of the contract. Although
there did not appear to be any evidence that the bill in issue contained a
clause requiring it to be produced, his Lordship seemed to have implied such a
term.

**

Appellants’ arguments

**

14 The argument raised by the appellants is that as a straight BL is non-
negotiable, and being unendorseable to a third party, it is to be equated to a
sea waybill whose essential characteristic is also that of non-negotiability.

15 As far as a sea waybill is concerned, it is settled law that the obligation
of the carrier is to deliver the cargo to the named consignee provided that
the latter can prove his identity; there is no requirement that the consignee
must present the waybill before he can obtain delivery of the goods: see
_Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading (20 th Edn 1996)_ at 39.

16 The advantage of resorting to a sea waybill is that it avoids the problems
arising from the late arrival of the documentation; its contents can be
telexed to the destination. Sea waybills are often used in trades involving
short sea voyages, where the carrying ship may arrive at its destination
before the shipping documents do.

**

Appellants’ authorities

**

17 In support of the proposition which the appellants have advanced, they
cited a number of recent authorities. But we must add that in none of them was
the _ratio decidendi_ on point. Furthermore, reliance is also placed on the
views expressed in two works, _Benjamin’s Sale of Goods (5 th Edn)_ and
_Carver on Bill of Lading (1 st Edn)._ But it must be noted that the relevant
chapters in these two works were authored by the same writer, Prof Guenter
Treitel.

18 It may be expedient if we should at this juncture set out the views
expressed in those two works. In _Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_ _(5 th Edn)_ at
18-014 it is stated that –

> Two things follow from the fact that a document of this kind is not
> transferable by indorsement and delivery. First, the consignee (if in
> possession of the document) cannot, by purporting to transfer it in this
> way, impose on the carrier a legal obligation to deliver the goods to
> another person. Secondly, the shipper cannot oblige the carrier to deliver
> the goods to a different consignee from the one named merely by indorsing
> and delivering the bill to that other person; _for under a straight bill the
> carrier is entitled and bound to deliver the goods to the originally named
> consignee without production of the bill,_ so that, when he delivers the
> goods, he may have no means of knowing of the purported transfer of the
> bill. This difficulty cannot arise in the case of an order bill, under which
> the goods are deliverable only on production of the bill." (Emphasis added).

19 In _Carver on Bills of Lading_ , a similar view is propounded at 6-007 –

> A "straight" bill is not a document of title in the common law sense, so
> that its transfer does not operate as a transfer of the constructive
> possession of the goods. _It is not a symbol of the goods because the
> carrier is entitled and bound to deliver the goods to the named consignee
> without production of the bill_. It follows that a carriage document will
> not be a document of title in the common law sense if it is expressed on its
> face to be "non negotiable". Sea waybills have the legal nature of
> "straight" or "non-negotiable" bills: they are similarly not documents of
> title in the common law sense, since under such waybills delivery is to be
> made to the named consignee, irrespective of production of the waybill, and
> not to the holder of the waybill as such. (Emphasis added).

20 Furthermore, while _Carver on Bills of Lading_ in paragraphs 1-007 and
1-008, also states that there is no difference between sea waybill and a
‘straight’ or ‘non-negotiable’ BL, the authors seem to imply that that is so
only in the context of the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Acts (COGSA) of 1971
and 1992 and this appears from the following passage:-

> "One possible view is that the definitions in this Act assume that it is
> _only_ an order (or a bearer) bill which is a "bill of lading," so that a
> document making goods deliverable to an identified person (and not to his
> order) is not a bill of lading at all. This may, indeed, be the position for
> the purposes of the 1992 Act, and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971,
> while not using the expression "sea waybill" also contrasts bills of lading
> with "non-negotiable" receipts containing or evidencing contracts for the
> carriage of goods by sea. But it does not follow that sea waybills or
> similar non-transferable documents cannot be bills of lading for any legal
> purposes whatsoever. _The definitions and distinctions just quoted apply
> only for the purposes of the Acts in which they occur and not for the
> purposes of other legislation or of rules of common law or where a question
> arises as to the meaning of the phrase "bill of lading" in a contract._ For
> example, the fact that a document which has the characteristics of a sea
> waybill (and is therefore not a bill of lading) for the purposes of the
> Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 does not preclude the possibility of such
> a document’s being regarded as a "bill of lading" for the purposes of
> section 1(4) of the Factors Act 1889 and hence of the Sales of Goods Act
> 1979." (Emphasis added).

21 In _The Bill of Lading_ _by Michael Bools,_ the author shares the views of
_Benjamin_ and _Carver_ when he states (at 169):-

> "With respect to a non-negotiable bill, the position is the same in England
> and America; the carrier need not require that it be produced or surrendered
> and need not even see the bill. All that is necessary is that the receiver
> produces identification to show that he is the person named in the bill as
> the consignee."

No authority is cited by the author in support of this proposition except for
the US case _Interstate Window Glass Co v New York N.H & H.R Co_. 133A.102,
104 (1926).

22 Turning now to the cases relied upon by the appellants, the first is _The
Chitral_ [2000] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 529 where the question before the court was, who
had the title to sue in relation to the cargo carried on board _"The Chitral"_
from Bremen to Dubai and which cargo was damaged during carriage. The judge,
David Steel J, could not accept the argument that the bill in question, where
the printed box for naming of the consignee (headed "if order state notify
party") was left blank was an "order" bill. The case had nothing to do with
the question under consideration in this judgment. It did not deal with the
delivery obligation of the carrier.

23 Next is _The River Ngada_ [2001] LMLN 570 where again the issue was whether
the claimant had the title to sue in respect of the damage caused to the
cargo. There, the Deputy Judge opined that in a straight BL, the production of
the BL by the named consignee was not a necessary pre-condition for delivery.
In coming to this view, the Deputy Judge relied upon the passage in
_Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_ at 18-014, which we have quoted above.

24 The more recent case, _The Rafaela S_ [2002] EWHC 593 was also not
concerned with the question whether in a straight BL the shipowner/charterer
could deliver the cargo to the specified consignee without the production of
the BL. The issue there was whether the shipowner/charterer could rely on the
limitation prescribed under the _United States Carriage of Goods by Sea Act
1936_ or the more generous regime of _Hague_ or _Hague-Visby Rules_ which had
been enacted in the UK _Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971._ To determine this
question, it was necessary to decide whether the straight BL issued by the
shipowner/charterer was a BL within the meaning of s.1(4) of the 1971 Act,
which provided that –

> "nothing in this section shall be taken as applying anything in the Rules to
> any contract for the carriage of goods by sea unless the contract expressly
> or by implication provides for the issue of a bill of lading or any similar
> document of title."

25 The 1971 Act did not define a "bill of lading". There, Mr Justice Langley
held that a straight BL which was not negotiable was not a "document of
title". He was of the view that the definition of a BL included "the
characteristics of transferability of title to the goods" and relied for this
proposition on _Scrutton on Charterparties, 20 th Edn, Article 2_ pages 1-2,
_Benjamin’s Sale of Goods, 5 th Edn, __18-007_ and _Carver on Bills of Lading
1 st Edn _6-007 and 6-014. He accordingly held that a straight BL did not fall
within the 1971 Act. However, Langley J went further to express the view
(obiter) that, _while the point was of some nicety,_ it was not necessary in
respect of a straight BL that delivery must be against the BL.

26 In _The Brij_ [2001] 1 Lloyd Rep 431, the Hong Kong High Court, relying
solely on _Benjamin on Sale of Goods_ , held that in the case of a straight
BL, the carrier could deliver directly to the specified consignee without the
production of the BL. The substantive issue in the case would appear to relate
to the question of privity of contract.

**

Respondent’s contention

**

27 On the other hand, the respondent contends that a straight BL, while it
shares the characteristic of non-transferability with a sea waybill, is
nevertheless not a sea waybill. The respondent relies upon a number of leading
cases on the subject to substantiate his argument that production of the BL is
vital to obtaining delivery, irrespective of whether it is a straight or an
order bill. However, like the cases relied on by the appellants, those cited
by the respondent also do not contain a ratio to that effect. This was because
they did not address, nor was it necessary to address, the specific issue,
that in respect of a straight BL, the carrier could deliver to the named
consignee without its production.

28 In the celebrated case, _The Stettin_ (1889) 14PD 142, Butt J held that a
shipowner was not entitled to deliver the goods to the consignee named in the
BL without the production of the bill and that the shipowner who so delivered
must bear the consequences. But the fact remains that the case itself was
concerned with a negotiable bill which specified that the goods were "to be
delivered to the consignee named in the BL or to his assigns". While it is
true that the distinction between a straight and negotiable bill was raised in
argument, Butt J did not specifically refer to it in his judgment. Arguably,
it could be inferred that Butt J did not think that the distinction was
relevant as far as the delivery obligation of the carrier was concerned.

29 In an earlier case, _Henderson & Co v The Comptoir d’Escompte de Paris_
(1873-4) LR 5 PC 253, the Privy Council (PC) assumed that where a BL did not
include the words "or order or assigns", it was not a negotiable document. The
PC held that, while the absence of those words in a BL was unusual, that would
not suffice to put a man of business, or a bank, on inquiry into the nature of
the special arrangement. It did not constitute constructive knowledge. It
seems to us that apart from the fact that it decided that a straight BL was
not transferable, nothing more should be read into it.

30 In _Thrige v United Shipping Co Ltd_[1924] Lloyd’s Rep 6 where it was
unnecessary to decide the question whether, where a BL was made out to a
consignee and the property passes on shipment, the shipowner who delivered to
the named consignee without production of the BL was or was not liable for
breach of contract, Scrutton LJ stated that if _Stettin_ had decided that
there was such a duty, he thought _Stettin_ might require further
consideration. He also declined to express a view whether such a BL was or was
not a negotiable instrument.

_

_ 31 _Barclays Bank Ltd v Commissioners of Customs & Excise_ [1963] 1 Lloyd
Rep 81 involved a negotiable BL as goods were shipped under the BL to "order
of the shipper". To that extent, the point may be made that the following
general statement of Diplock LJ should be viewed with some circumspection –

> "So long as the contract is not discharged the bill of lading, in my view,
> remains a document of title by indorsement and delivery of which the rights
> of property in the goods can be transferred. It is clear law that where a
> bill of lading or order is issued in respect of the contract of carriage by
> sea, the shipowner is not bound to surrender possession of the goods to any
> person whether named as consignee or not, except on production of the bill
> of lading …"

It is difficult to say whether in that pronouncement, Diplock LJ also had in
mind a straight BL, where words such as "to order" were absent.

32 In _The Houda_ [1994] 2 Lloyds 541, there was a shipment in August 1990 of
a cargo of crude oil by a time-charterer from Kuwait shortly before the
invasion of that country by Iraq. The BLs were left by the master in Kuwait
and were never seen. After the invasion, the management of the charterers
moved to London where the charterers gave orders relating to the voyage of the
vessel. Eventually, a settlement was reached and the cargo was discharged. The
charterer sued for the loss of services of the _Houda_ for a period of some 36
days. One of the questions which the court was asked to address was whether
the owner was obliged to deliver without the production of the BLs and it held
that the owner was not so obliged. But again we recognised that the BLs which
the charterers instructed the shipowners to issue were negotiable.

33 In _Evans & Reid v "Cornouaille"_ [1921] Lloyd’s Rep 76, which also
concerned an "order" BL, and where the shipowner parted with the cargo without
the production of the BL, Hill J said (at p.77):-

> "The fact that the coal was intended to be delivered to the Societe Union
> did not entitle the Master to deliver to anybody without production of the
> Bill of Lading. It would not have entitled him to deliver even if the
> Societe Union had been the consignee named in the Bill of Lading. It is said
> that the plaintiffs ought to have informed the defendants that the buyers of
> the coal had not taken up the documents. There is no such duty upon the
> plaintiffs. The transaction between the buyers and the plaintiffs had
> nothing to do with the shipowners. The latter were only concerned with the
> fulfillment of their Bill of Lading contract, and the plaintiffs were
> entitled to rely upon this, that the ship would not give delivery of the
> goods until the Bill of Lading, with the plaintiffs’ endorsement upon it,
> was presented to the Master.

34 We now turn to the views of textbook writers. As indicated before, not all
writers hold the same view on the question as _Benjamin_ or _Carver_.
Moreover, the relevant chapters in both _Benjamin_ and _Carver_ were written
by the same author.

35 In contrast, in _Schmitthoff’s The Law and Practice of International Trade
(10 th Edn, 2000),_ the authors opine that (at pp 276 and 292):-

> A shipper who wishes to obtain a bill of lading which is not negotiable does
> not insert the word "order" in the appropriate box of the bill but inserts
> the name of the consignee in the following box. The effect of this procedure
> is that, although the shipper can transfer title in the goods to the
> consignee by delivering the bill of lading to him, the consignee cannot
> further pass on title in them to a third party by transfer of the BL.

> **.**
>
> **.**
>
> _
>
> Logically, the function of the bill of lading on a document of title is
> distinct from its negotiable quality. Even a bill of lading which is not
> made negotiable operates as a document of title, because the consignee named
> therein can only claim delivery of the goods from the shipowner if able to
> produce the bill of lading.
>
> _ However, a great practical value of the bill of lading as a means of
> making goods in transit rapidly transferable is due to the customary
> combination of the two features of the bill, namely, its quasi-negotiability
> and its function as a document of title. (Emphasis added).

36 In _Paul Todd’s Bill of Lading and Bankers’Documentary Credits (3 rd
Edition)_ the author states (at p.13-14):-

> "If a bill of lading is issued, the carrier must deliver only upon tender of
> an original bill of lading at the port of discharge. _A bill of lading may
> be made out to a named consignee, in which case he alone may validly present
> it to obtain goods from the vessel._ Alternatively, it may be made
> negotiable … Because delivery of the goods can be made only against
> presentation of an original bill of lading, it follows that transfer of the
> document can also transfer the right to take possession of the goods on
> discharge. Hence, the bill of lading is said to be a ‘document of title’,
> representing the goods while they are goods on sea."

37 It is also of significance to note that _Tetley on Marine Cargo Claims (3
rd Edn)_, classified the documentation relating to carriage of goods by sea,
on the basis of negotiability or transferability, into the following three
categories (at p.995):-

> > (i) Fully transferable and a document of title as well:
>>

>>> a bill of lading to bearers,

>>>

>>> a bill of lading to a name left blank or to order or to assigns,

>>>

>>> a bill of lading to a named person or to order or to assigns.

>>

>> (ii) Not transferable but still a document of title:

>>

>>> a bill of lading to a named person,

>>>

>>> a U.S. straight bill of lading (a hybrid governed by the _Pomerene Act_ ,
it is marked nonnegotiable, has certain of the qualities of a document of
title, and yet it need not be presented to take delivery).

>>

>> (iii) Not transferable and not a document of title:

>>

>>> a waybill or non-negotiable receipt.

38 It would be seen that a straight BL is classified by _Tetley_ as distinct
from that of a sea waybill and is regarded nevertheless as a document of
title, requiring its production to obtain delivery.

_

_ 39 _Cooke on Voyage Charters_ cited _Sze Hai Tong_ for the proposition that
–

> "… the bill of lading, by implication if not expressly, makes the goods
> deliverable upon,_and only upon, the surrender of the bill of lading_."
> (Emphasis added).

_

_ 40 _Gaskell on Bills of Lading: Law and Contracts_ , which was cited by the
appellants, notes that a straight BL "is probably little more than a waybill
by another name" (at para 1.49). It goes on to observe that "there are doubts
if a carrier would get a good discharge for delivery without production of a
(straight) bill of lading in English law." Then at para 14.24 the author
states "it is unclear whether a carrier is obliged to deliver to the consignee
named in a … straight bill, even without production of that bill" and against
this statement there is a footnote which states "… the US legal position is
that a straight bill does not have to be presented, but that general practice
elsewhere is to require a straight bill to be surrendered, rather like an
order bill." This is in line with the comment of _Tetley_ at p.232 where it is
stated that sea waybill are called "straight bills of lading in the US."

41 Finally, at para 14.25, having reviewed the different opinions on the
matter, the author came to the conclusion that "the view of _Benjamin_ is to
be preferred, on the basis that there is no real distinction between a waybill
and a straight bill, and that neither are needed to obtain delivery of the
goods (unless the contract so requires)." But rather interestingly, the author
goes on to explain that (also at para 14.25):-

> In practice, most of the standard form bills (which are mainly designed to
> be negotiable) do contain express terms which singly or together provide
> that a bill is to be surrendered before goods will be delivered. There is no

> (Emphasis added).

42 What is clear from _Gaskell_ is that the views offered by the author are
rather equivocal.

43 We must observe that while the BL issued in the present case does not have
a clause with the identical words "an original bill of lading, duly endorsed,
must be surrendered", it contained somewhat similar words "upon surrender to
the Carrier of any one negotiable bill of lading, properly endorsed, all
others shall stand void." The reasoning of _Gaskell_ on the expression "duly
endorsed" can similarly be applied to the expression "properly endorsed" which
is found in the present BL.

44 We now turn to _Charles Debattista’s The Sale of Goods Carried by Sea (2 nd
Ed)_ at para 2-32 where he refrains from stating the law definitively and
instead opines that "given the guidance given by the Law Commissions in their
Report accompanying COGSA 1992, it is extremely likely that the courts will
regard non-order bills as sea waybills." Debattista’s observations are
revealing in its heavy reliance on COGSA but overlooked the fact that while
the English and Scottish Commissions in their report on _Rights of Suit in
respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea_ , had observed that the straight BLs and
the sea waybills are much the same type of document, they added the
qualification, _"save that the sea waybill is not required to obtain
delivery."_ In short, while the two Commissions accepted that a straight BL
and a sea waybill are very similar documents, they are not identical and that
the production of a straight BL is necessary to obtain delivery.

45 It is of interest to note that in _The Happy Ranger_ [2002] EWCA Civ 694,
while the Court of Appeal held that the bill in question was not a "straight"
BL, nevertheless two Lord Justices, Tuckey and Rix, expressly made the
observation that the views of textbook writers that the production of a
straight BL was not necessary for delivery, referring no doubt to _Benjamin_
and _Carver_ , were not necessarily correct. Even the third member of the
quorum, Aldous LJ, would appear to agree with that reservation because he
adopted the judgment of Tuckey LJ.

46 The only Singapore case which had the occasion to consider the issue was
_Olivine Electronics Pte Ltd v Seabridge Transport Pte_ [1995] 3 SLR 143.
There the seller of 320 coloured television sets shipped them on board a
vessel. The BL stated the buyer as the consignee and notifying party. The
shipowner delivered the goods to the buyer without presentation of the BL. As
the seller did not receive payment for the same, he instituted an action for
conversion to recover the loss from the defendant shipowner for releasing the
goods without the production of the BL. The defendant argued that as this was
a straight bill, and not a document of title, and as it was similar to a sea
waybill, its production was not needed to obtain delivery. Goh Joon Seng J,
applying the _contra proferentum r_ ule, held that it was a term of the
contract that delivery must be against the presentation of the BL. Thus it was
unnecessary for the court to answer the more general question. However, the
judge did remark that the law on the duty on the part of the carrier to
deliver only against production of the original BL in a straight consigned BL
was still "somewhat open".

Our Opinion

**

47 It seems to us that some of the confusion in this area of the law could
perhaps have been caused by a misunderstanding of the Carriage of Goods by Sea
Act 1992 (COGSA 1992), which requires a bill to be transferable before it is a
bill of lading for the purposes of the Act. Indeed, that was also the position
under COGSA 1971. The Act is only concerned with rights of suit in respect of
carriage of goods by sea. It does not, in any way, deal with the question
whether presentation of a straight bill is necessary to obtain delivery.

48 At the end of the day, it seems to us that the issue must be resolved on
the basis of contract law and the intention of the parties. The entire
argument of the appellants is that a straight BL is the same as a sea waybill.
While it is true that a BL, devoid of the characteristic of negotiability, is
substantially similar in effect to that of a sea waybill, that is not to say
that they are the same. If the parties had intended to create a sea waybill
they would have done so. Ordinarily, the main characteristics of a BL are
twofold. First, it is negotiable (i.e., transferable). Second, it is a
document of title, requiring its presentation to obtain delivery of the cargo.
In the case of a straight bill, while the characteristic of transferability is
absent, there is no reason why one should thereby infer that the parties had
intended to do away with the other main characteristic, i.e., delivery upon
presentation. As the Judge below noted, while one cannot indorse a straight
bill to transfer constructive possession of the cargo, it does not necessarily
follow that the straight bill does not impose a contractual term obligating
the carrier to require its production to obtain delivery.

49 It seems to us that clear words must be present to imply that the parties
intended the instrument to be treated, in all respects, as if it were a sea
waybill and that its presentation by the named consignee is not necessary.
Indeed, if the parties had wanted to have a sea waybill they could have quite
easily adopted that format. They would not have issued a BL with three
originals. By issuing the instrument as a BL, it must mean that they wished to
retain all the other features of a BL, other than the characteristic of
transferability.

_

50 Davies & Dickey on Shipping Law (2nd Edn)

_ states at 163: "if a negotiable document of title is not needed, the parties
_may_ choose to use a sea waybill as the contract of carriage, instead of a
bill of lading." Clearly, the option is with the parties. And if they
nevertheless choose to adopt the format of a BL, the court should not be
astute to convert their arrangement into something they do not want to have in
the first place. That is the first point we make.

51 Secondly, even looking at the matter from the perspective of the market
place, there is much to commend the rule that even in respect of a straight
bill presentation of it is a pre-requisite to obtaining delivery. If nothing
else, the advantage of this rule is that it is simple to apply. It is certain.
It would prevent confusion and avoid the shipowners and/or their agents having
to decide whether a bill is a straight bill or an order bill [e.g., _Happy
Ranger_ (supra)], and run the risk attendant thereto if the determination they
make on that point should turn out to be erroneous. The rule would obviate
such wholly unnecessary litigation. In this connection, we think the following
words of Clarke J in _The Sormovskiy 3068_[1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 266 (which
concerned an order bill) have much to commend themselves (at p.274):-

> "It makes commercial sense to have a simple rule that in the absence of an
> express term of the contract the master must only deliver the cargo to the
> holder of the bill of lading who presents it to him. In that way both the
> shipowners and the persons in truth entitled to possession of the cargo are
> protected by the term of the contract."

52 Thirdly, to accept the arguments put forward by APL is to envisage two
broad categories of documents which could be used by shippers. The first
option is the negotiable BL; in such a situation, delivery of the goods can
only be made upon presentation of the BL. The second option for shippers is to
use a non-negotiable straight BL or sea waybill; here, the straight BL or
waybill need not be produced for delivery of the goods. In essence, APL’s
scheme envisages that as long as the shipping document is non-negotiable on
its face, presentation of the original BL or sea waybill is unnecessary for
delivery. We think that this approach is overly restrictive for an unpaid
seller who wishes to use a non-negotiable BL while retaining his security for
payment.

53 Indeed, to hold that a straight BL is not the same as a sea waybill has the
advantage of providing such a seller, or in the case of documentary credit,
the bank, with some security against default by the buyer, and the buyer of
some assurance that the seller has shipped the cargo before he is required to
make payment. In short, it gives both the buyer and the seller, where they,
for their own reasons, want only a straight BL be issued, a fair measure of
protection. That was what Mr Voss wanted: payment before delivery by carrier.
In contrast, the sea waybill is only a contract of carriage whereby the
carrier undertakes to deliver the cargo to the person identified by the
shipper as entitled to take delivery of the cargo. The sea waybill is retained
by the shipper and all the consignee need show to take delivery is proof of
his identity. It is a receipt, not a document of title. It, unlike a BL,
cannot be used as a security to obtain financing.

54 Fourthly, adopting the rule that presentation of a straight BL is a pre-
requisite to obtaining delivery also avoids the undesirable consequences of
the shipper’s rights of suit under the original contract of carriage surviving
any transfer of the document to the consignee.

**

Judgment

**

55 In the light of the foregoing, we hold that in respect of a straight BL,
the shipowners should only deliver the cargo against its presentation. In the
circumstances, there is no defence to the respondent’s claim. Some faint
attempts were made to raise triable issues so that the action could go for
trial but they are, as found by the judge below, wholly without merits. The
appellants’ defence rests essentially on the legal point on which they have
failed. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the High Court and dismissed
the appeal with costs. The security for costs, together with any accrued
interest, shall be paid out to the respondent’s solicitors to account of the
respondent’s costs.
