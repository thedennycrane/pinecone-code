Decision Date | : | 16 April 2001  
Tribunal/Court | : | High Court  
Coram | : |  Tay Yong Kwang JC   
Counsel Name(s) | : |  Sim Lin Piah (Toh Tan & Partners) for the plaintiff; Lee Mun Hooi and Liew Chen Chen (Lee Mun Hooi & Co) for the defendants

Land – Caveats – effect of caveat-Adverse possession – Whether adverse
possession acquired by 1st March 1994 – Failure to lodge caveat against
disputed plot of land before lapsing of caution – Whether such interest can be
defeated by bona fide purchaser's interest under Land Titles Act (Cap 157,
1994 Ed)  
  

: These are four related originating summonses heard together and they concern
a plot of land, one part of which has been assimilated by 1 Bedok Rise and the
other by 3 Bedok Rise. The plaintiff in OS 1628 and 1629 of 2000 is a company
(`the company`) which owns 7A Bedok Rise which adjoins both 1 and 3 Bedok
Rise. The company claims against the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise possession
of the respective portion of the plot in issue together with an injunction to
restrain them from remaining on the said plot, mesne profits and/or damages
from the date of trespass until the delivery up of possession, interest and
costs on an indemnity basis.  
  
Originating Summons 1925 of 2000 and OS 600154 of 2001 are the actions by the
owners of 3 and 1 Bedok Rise respectively against the company for a
declaration that they are the owners of the relevant portion of the plot of
land in question by virtue of adverse possession. They also seek an order that
the Singapore Land Registry be directed to rectify the entries in the registry
to exclude the plot in question from the title of 7A Bedok Rise.  
  
The portion of the plot occupied by 3 Bedok Rise is about 48.10sq m with an
estimated market value of $210,000 while the portion occupied by 1 Bedok Rise
is about 80.16sq m with an estimated market value of $345,000.  
  
**_The company`s case_**

****

The company is the registered owner of the piece of land described as Lot
8187W Mukim 27 Bedok (`the property`) of which 7A Bedok Rise is a part. The
property`s parent lot used to be known as Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 Bedok/Lot 98170L
Mukim 27 Bedok.  
  
The company purchased the property from another company known as Double L & T
Pte Ltd which had in turn acquired it from one Thulasi Velayutham. Pursuant to
an Indenture of Conveyance dated 17 December 1993, Thulasi conveyed the land
known as Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 Bedok to Double L & T Pte Ltd. Thereafter, Double
L & T Pte Ltd applied for the parent lot (comprising the property) to be
registered under the Land Titles Act.  
  
On 20 June 1994, Double L & T Pte Ltd obtained a qualified certificate of
title of the parent lot which was subdivided into Lot 8187W (the property),
Lot 8188V and Lot 8189P.  
  
On 15 June 1996, the property was transferred from Double L & T Pte Ltd and
registered in the name of the company. The company, which is a housing
developer, then built houses on the property. The company intends to sell the
house now known as 7A Bedok Rise together with its compound. The plot in
dispute falls within the compound of 7A Bedok Rise but the respective portions
thereof have been fenced up and assimilated by 1 and 3 Bedok Rise.  
  
On 9 April 1996, the company`s solicitors wrote to the owner of 1 Bedok Rise
in the following terms:

> _Dear Sirs,_

> _re: Lots 235-25 and 4236 Mukim 27 Bedok Close Singapore_

> _We act for M/s Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd who are the purchasers of No. 16
> Bedok Close, Singapore i.e. Lots No. 235-25 and 4236, Mukim 27, Singapore._

> _We are instructed that you have encroached onto the portion of our clients`
> aforesaid land, more particularly marked `D` in the enclosed plan._

> _TAKE NOTICE that as our clients need the said land for their development
> they will require you to set back your fencing to its proper boundary within
> the next fourteen (14) days._

> _In any event, please let us have your written response within the next
> seven (7) days._

  
  
A similar letter was written to the owners of 3 Bedok Rise on the same day.  
  
On 21 June 1996, the company`s solicitors followed up with another letter to
the respective owners which reads:

> _Dear Sir,_

> _re: Lots 8187 (previously 235-25) Mukim 27 Bedok Close Singapore_

> _We act for M/s Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd who are now the owners of the above
> property._

> _Despite our letter of 9th April 1996, you have not set back your fencing to
> its proper boundary._

> _TAKE NOTICE that if you refuse, neglect or otherwise fail to do so within
> the next SEVEN (7) days, we have instructions to commence proceedings
> against you without further reference in which event you shall be liable for
> costs and damages incurred._

  
  
On 15 July 1996, the company`s solicitors wrote again to the owner of 1 Bedok
Rise the following letter:

> _Dear Sir,_

> _re: Lot 8187 (previously 235-25) Mukim 27 Bedok Close Singapore_

> _We act for M/s Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd who are the owners of the above
> property._

> _We are instructed that you have encroached onto the portion of our clients`
> land, more particularly marked "D" in the enclosed plan._

> _TAKE NOTICE that our clients require you to set back your fencing to its
> proper boundary within the next fourteen (14) days._

> _In any event, please let us have your written response within the next
> seven (7) days._

  
  
A similar letter did not appear to have been sent to 3 Bedok Rise.  
  
Some four years later, on 9 October 2000, the company`s solicitors wrote:

> _Ngo Ong Chung_

> _(NRIC No. S2503404/Z)_

> _and all other persons occupying_

> _the plot of land belonging to_

> _No. 7A Bedok Rise and adjoining_

> _No. 1 Bedok Rise_

> _Singapore 469574_

> _Dear Sir/Madam_

> _NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST TRESPASS OF THE PLOT OF LAND BELONGING TO NO. 7A
> BEDOK RISE (LOT 8187W) AND ADJOINING NO. 1 BEDOK RISE (LOT 3877A)_

> _We act for Liwen Holdings Pte Ltd, the owners of No. 7A Bedok Rise,
> Singapore i.e. Lot No. 8187W Mukim 27, Singapore._

> _We are instructed that you have encroached onto our clients` land and
> thereby committed trespass. Accordingly, we hereby demand that you cease and
> desist from trespassing onto our clients` land within 7 days hereof._

> _In this regard, we enclose a plan of the land which sets out the relevant

> _TAKE NOTICE that our clients are property developers and shall require the

> _In the event that you persist with the trespass after the stipulated
> deadline, we have our clients` instructions to institute legal proceedings
> without further reference._

  
  
A letter in similar terms was sent to 3 Bedok Rise. However, there was no
response from either 1 or 3 Bedok Rise.  
  
The company claims that its title has become absolute on 17 December 1998,
five years after the Indenture of Conveyance by Thulasi to Double L & T Pte
Ltd. No one has filed a caveat against the property alleging an interest in
it.  
  
**_The defendants` case_**

****

The case of the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise is contained in their affidavits
filed in OS 1925/2000 and OS 600154/2001.  
  
1 Bedok Rise was transferred to the present owner on 25 April 1988. The
previous owner bought this property in 1975.  
  
1 Bedok Rise was part of a housing project developed by Lucky Realty Co Ltd.
An application was made sometime in 1973 by the developer to subdivide the
parent lot (Lot 235-24 Mukim 27 Bedok) into individual lots which included 1
Bedok Rise.  
  
When the present owner purchased 1 Bedok Rise, it was separated along its
entire boundary with 3 Bedok Rise by a brick wall with metal grilles at the
top. In 1978, this brick wall was built in place of the chain fencing put up
by the developer and it has been in continuous existence since then. The first
owner of 1 Bedok Rise was in continuous possession of the relevant portion of
the plot of land in dispute since the date of purchase of 1 Bedok Rise from
the developer and there was undisturbed possession for more than 12 years
before this property was transferred to the present owner in 1988.  
  
The company reiterates its position set out in its originating summons in
respect of 1 Bedok Rise. None of the directors of the company has any
knowledge of the owner`s allegations spelt out above and the company does not
admit them as the truth. The company points out that the assertion that the
chain fencing put up by the developer had annexed the disputed plot is a bare
one. In fact, the site plan of the developer attached to its application for
subdivision in 1973 clearly indicated that the plot in issue was excluded from
1 Bedok Rise. The company also points out that the present owner has no
personal knowledge about the developer`s chain fencing nor any documents as to
the date of construction of the brick wall. In the ordinary course of events,
there ought to have been various queries regarding the unauthorised use of the
plot in issue in the purchases of 1 Bedok Rise in 1971, 1975 and 1988 but no
documentary evidence of such has been adduced. There was also no response when
the company and its predecessor demanded the cessation of encroachment.  
  
The present owners of 3 Bedok Rise are a married couple who bought it in 1986.
The husband was told by the previous owner that he bought this property from
Lucky Realty Co Ltd in 1971 and was given possession in August 1973. The
previous owner also told him a chain fencing had been constructed between 1
and 3 Bedok Rise at the time he took possession of his property and that it
enclosed the disputed plot as well.  
  
He was further told that sometime in 1978, the chain fencing was replaced by a
brick wall with metal grilles on top. Beyond the boundary walls of 1 and 3
Bedok Rise (ie the company`s property) was a strip of land reserved as a
backlane or access which was covered with wild vegetation and which had never
been used. In fact, the access to this strip was sealed up with a wooden
fence.  
  
The previous owner of 3 Bedok Rise is now residing in Canada. An affidavit was
filed by him confirming what has been stated by the present owner. The
previous owner also confirms that he was in continuous possession of the
relevant part of the disputed plot since the time he took possession of 3
Bedok Rise from the developer in 1973. He had also maintained, repaired and
carried out improvements to the disputed plot.  
  
The company filed an affidavit raising the same points as it did in the case
of 1 Bedok Rise.  
  
**_The issues_**

****

On 1 March 1994, acquisition of title by adverse possession was effectively
abolished. The present owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise who took possession in
1988 and 1986 respectively would therefore not have satisfied the requirement
of 12 years of continuous adverse possession in their own right. The issues
for determination are therefore the following:

(1) whether by 1 March 1994, the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise have acquired
the disputed plot through adverse possession;

(2) if they have so acquired, whether such interest can be defeated by the
company`s interest as bona fide purchaser under the Land Titles Act and
whether the company`s title to the disputed plot has become an unqualified
title on 17 December 1998.  
  
**_The decision of the court_**

****

The first issue is one of fact. In the light of the documentary evidence which
shows that the disputed plot was not included as part of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise,
the assertions of the present owners and those of the previous owner of 3
Bedok Rise must be tested by cross-examination in court. I therefore ordered a
trial of this factual issue and directed that all affidavits on record stand
as the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of the respective witnesses. I also
directed the parties to proceed for a pre-trial conference before the
Registrar on the question of the need for further witnesses and to take dates
for the trial of the issue. This part of my decision is not under appeal by
the company.  
  
The second issue is a question of law. The company`s case is that its title
has become an absolute one with effect from 17 December 1998, five years after
the conveyance from Thulasi to Double L & T Pte Ltd, as no caveat was lodged
before 17 December 1998 to assert any claim against the property. On 20 June
1994, when the property was brought within the regime of the Land Titles Act,
the conveyance which was cancelled upon the issuance of the qualified
certificate of title to Double L & T Pte Ltd was Thulasi`s 17 December 1993
conveyance. The company`s certificate of title dated 15 June 1996 was also a
qualified title.  
  
Sections 19 and 20 of the Land Titles Act set out the process of bringing land
within the said Act. The relevant parts of these sections provide:  
  

19 | (1) | Land not subject to the provisions of this Act may be brought under the provisions of this Act.  
---|---|---  
| (2) | Subject to this section, a primary application may be made by -  
|  | (a) a person entitled whether at law or in equity to an estate in fee simple or in perpetuity in the land to which the application relates; or  
|  | (b) a person entitled either at law or in equity to a leasehold estate having an unexpired term of not less than 10 years on the date of the lodgment of the application in the land to which the application relates.  
| ... |   
20 |  | When land has been brought under the provisions of this Act pursuant to a primary application, the Registrar shall -  
|  | (a) upon the creation of a folio unqualified as to title, cancel all assurances lodged to support the primary application in so far as they relate to the registered land, and retain in his possession or under his control such assurances as have been wholly cancelled; and  
|  | (b) upon the creation of a folio qualified as to title, cancel the last conveyance passing title to the person who is recorded in the folio as the registered proprietor of the land comprised in the folio.  
  
  
  
Section 3(1) provides:

> _Except as hereinafter provided, all Acts, regulations, rules, and other
> laws, and all practices, relating to estates and interests in land and
> operative at 1st March 1994, so far as they are inconsistent with the
> provisions of this Act in their application to registered land, are
> repealed._

  
  
Section 25 (on which the company relies for its assertion that its qualified
title has become absolute on 17 December 1998) reads:

> _
>
> (1) Upon the creation of a qualified folio, the Registrar shall enter
> thereon a caution warning persons dealing with the registered proprietor
> therein named that the land comprised therein is held subject to any
> interest which affected it at the date of the creation of that folio, and so
> long as the caution remains on that folio that land shall be so held.
>
> (2) In favour of any purchaser of an entire estate or interest in any land
> comprised in a qualified folio who is registered as the proprietor in the
> qualified folio, a caution entered on the qualified folio whether before or
> after 1st March 1994 lapses, in respect of that estate or interest, on the
> expiration of 5 years from the date of the last conveyance which was
> cancelled by the Registrar upon the creation of the qualified folio.
>
> (3) A mortgagee or chargee shall not be regarded as a purchaser for the
> purposes of subsection (2).
>
> (4) When a caution lapses pursuant to subsection (2), the lapsed caution
> shall constitute a defunct entry and the Registrar shall, after the lodgment
> of an application in the approved form made by the proprietor of the land
> cause an entry to be made in respect of the lapsing of the caution.
>
> (5) Upon the lapsing of a caution pursuant to subsection (2), the folio
> shall cease to be qualified and the land comprised therein shall thenceforth
> be held subject only to such interests as are registered or notified on the
> folio and to such interests as are otherwise excepted by section 46.
>
> (6) Any person deprived of land by the operation of this section shall not
> by reason of that deprivation have any claim against the assurance fund.
>
> (7) For the purposes of subsection (2),
>
> "conveyance" has the same meaning as in section 21 (6).
>
> _

  
  
Section 45 of the Land Titles Act states that instruments are ineffectual to
pass any estate or interest in land under the Land Titles Act until they are
registered. The estate of the proprietor of registered land is paramount as
provided in:  
  

46(1) | Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or interest, whether derived by grant from the State or otherwise, which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority, and notwithstanding any failure to observe the procedural requirements of this Act, any person who becomes the proprietor of registered land, whether or not he dealt with a proprietor, and notwithstanding any lack of good faith on the part of the person through whom he claims, shall hold that land free from all encumbrances, liens, estates and interests whatsoever except such as may be registered or notified in the land-register, ...  
---|---  
  
  
  
This subsection is subject to seven exceptions. The registered title of a
proprietor may also be defeated on the ground of fraud or forgery. Section
46(3) further provides:

> _Nothing in this section shall confer on a proprietor claiming otherwise
> than as a purchaser any better title than was held by his immediate
> predecessor._

  
  
Knowledge of the existence of any unregistered interest shall not of itself be
imputed as fraud (ss 47(1) and 49(2) of the Land Titles Act). No fraud has
been alleged against the company in these proceedings. Finally, s 157(1)
provides:

> _Notwithstanding anything in this Act, no purchaser who has become a
> proprietor shall be subject to action for the recovery of land or of money
> on the plea that his vendor, or any predecessor in title, may have acted in
> bad faith._

  
  
In **Sum Keong Realty v Syed Jafaralsadeg Alhadad** [1996] 3 SLR 55  at 61,
Chao Hick Tin J held that in the light of s 25(2) of the Land Titles Act, it
was clear that a caution stated on a qualified title lapsed on the expiry of
five years from the date of the last conveyance which was cancelled by the
Registrar upon the creation of the qualified folio and the fact that no entry
had yet been made in respect of the lapsing of the caution was immaterial.
This was because under s 25(4), the caution constituted a defunct entry and
the making of an entry regarding its lapsing was a purely administrative act
in which the Registrar had no discretion. It is therefore of no consequence
that no such entry has been made in the present case before me.  
  
**Balwant Singh v Double L & T** [1996] 2 SLR 726  was a case involving the
same property as the one in the present case. In that case, Balwant Singh had
been in adverse possession of a triangular plot of some 70.4sq m which formed
part of Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 belonging to one VK Samy. This plot of land was in
the adverse possession of Thulasi since 1941. On 17 December 1993, Thulasi
obtained consent judgment against VK Samy and was declared owner in fee simple
by virtue of adverse possession. On the same day, Thulasi conveyed Lot 235-25
including the said triangular plot to Double L & T Pte Ltd. This conveyance
was duly registered in the Registry of Deeds. On 1 March 1994, the new Land
Titles Act came into force. On 20 June 1994, the property was brought within
the new Land Titles Act with Double L & T Pte Ltd as the registered proprietor
under a qualified certificate of title. On 17 February 1995, Balwant Singh
lodged a caveat against the property claiming an interest in the triangular
plot as an adverse possessor.  
  
Goh Joon Seng J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, set out the
issues before the court and the law on adverse possession of both common law
land and registered land as follows (at pp 729-731):

> _The issues on appeal were essentially the same as those raised in the court
> below, namely:_

> _
>
> (a) did s 50 of the new LTA abolish Balwant`s claim by way of adverse
> possession of the disputed plot which became registered land on 20 June
> 1994;
>
> (b) did s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA apply to preserve Balwant`s claim.
>
> _

> _Before we proceed, it would be convenient to trace briefly the development
> of the law relating to acquisition of title to land by adverse possession
> with regard to registered and unregistered land. Prior to 1 March 1994, for
> land which was held under the common law system, title acquired by adverse
> possession need not be registered since all that was required to acquire the
> same was the necessary intention and physical possession to extinguish the
> documentary owner`s title. The Limitation Act also provided that if the
> documentary owner did not assert title to the land within 12 years, his
> claim would be barred and his title extinguished and the person in adverse
> possession would then acquire a possessory title. See ss 9(1) and 18 of the
> Limitation Act._

> _On the other hand, claims to adverse possession of registered land were
> governed by s 42 of the repealed LTA which read:_

> _
>
> `(1) Any person in adverse possession of registered land who, if that land
> had not been brought under the provisions of this Act would have become
> entitled thereto by virtue of that adverse possession, may apply to the
> Registrar for a certificate of title to that land, provided that not less
> than 12 years have elapsed since the land was brought under the provisions
> of this Act, or since the entry in the land-register of the most recent
> memorial of registration or notification of an instrument (other than an
> instrument of statutory obligation) affecting that land.
>
> (2) Except as in this Division provided, no title to land adverse to or in
> derogation of the title of a proprietor shall be acquired by any length of
> possession by virtue of the Limitation Act or otherwise, nor shall the title
> of any proprietor be extinguished by the operation of that Act.
>
> (3) Nothing in this Act affects the operation of the Limitation Act with
> respect to the right of a person in adverse possession of land comprised in
> a qualified certificate of title where the possession commenced before the
> land was brought under the provisions of this Act and that right has been
> protected by caveat.`
>
> _

> _Section 42(2) is the precursor of s 50 of the new LTA. In**Wong Kok Chin v
> Mah Ten Kui Joseph** [1992] 2 SLR 161 , Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in
> delivering the judgment of this court dealt comprehensively with the
> provisions of the repealed LTA. There the adverse possessor`s occupation of
> the encroached land began in 1969. On 23 August 1974, the land, of which the
> encroached land was a part, was brought under the provisions of the repealed
> LTA then applicable and a qualified certificate of title issued. On 23 June
> 1988, the registered proprietor of the land lodged a notice of reassertion
> of ownership. On 27 June 1988, the adverse possessor lodged a caveat
> claiming an interest as an adverse possessor of the encroached land. It was
> held that the adverse possessor`s claim fell within s 42(3) in that he had
> five years` adverse possession before the land became registered land. This
> was an inchoate interest which crystallised into an indefeasible title by
> December 1981 and the registered proprietor`s title was thereby extinguished
> long before he lodged his reassertion of ownership. At p 172 Chan Sek Keong
> J stated:_

> _`... Having regard to the policy of the LTA in continuing to apply the
> Limitation Act to registered land, subject only to the provisions of Div 2
> of the Act, the short answer must be that unless Div 2 expressly provides to
> the contrary, the appellant`s title was extinguished long before he lodged
> his reassertion of ownership. In our view, the lodgment of the reassertion
> of ownership could not have the effect of reviving a title which had been
> extinguished by limitation as there is no provision in Div 2 which so
> provides. A reassertion of ownership is not intended by the LTA to revive an
> extinct title but to stop the accruing right of an adverse possessor before
> limitation sets in.`_

> _As Baalman in**The Singapore Torrens Systems** [1961] at p 96 described,
> these permitted exceptions under the repealed LTA effectively steered a
> middle course between exposing the land-register entirely to claims based on
> adverse possession, and excluding entirely the principle of limitation of
> action._

> _However, as of 1 March 1994, the repealed LTA was repealed by the 1993 LTA.
> Section 50 of the 1993 LTA is now s 50 of the new LTA. It reads:_

> _`Except as provided in section 172(7) and (8) no title to land adverse to
> or in derogation of the title of a proprietor of registered land shall be
> acquired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation Act or
> otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor of registered land be
> extinguished by the operation of that Act.`_

> _Section 50 of the new LTA is thus similarly worded as s 42(2) of the
> repealed LTA except for the transitional provisions. Effectively under s 50
> of the new LTA, except in limited instances falling within the transitional
> provisions, no title to registered land could be acquired by adverse
> possession. These transitional provisions are found in s 172(7) and (8) of
> the new LTA. Section 172(7) states:_

> _`Where at any time before 1st March 1994, a person -_

> _
>
> (a) was in adverse possession of any registered land; and
>
> (b) has lodged an application for a possessory title to the land under the
> provisions of the repealed Act and the application has not been withdrawn
> but is on such date pending in the Land Titles Registry,
>
> _

> _the application shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of
> the repealed Act in force immediately before such date.`_

> _Section 172(8) states:_

> _`Where at any time before 1st March 1994 a person -_

> _
>
> (a) was in adverse possession of any registered land; and
>
> (b) was entitled to lodge an application for a possessory title to the land
> under the provisions of the repealed Act which were in force immediately
> before such date,
>
> _

> _he may, within 6 months of such date make an application to court for an
> order to vest the title in him or lodge an application for a possessory
> title to the land and the application shall be dealt with in accordance with
> the provisions of the repealed Act in force immediately before such date.`_

> _Section 50 of the new LTA therefore provides for the preservation of an
> adverse possessor`s claim to title in two situations. Firstly, under s
> 172(7), where the land was registered under the repealed LTA and an
> application for possessory title had been lodged prior to 1 March 1994.
> Secondly, under s 172(8) where there was a subsisting entitlement to lodge
> such an application in respect of such registered land as of 1 March 1994
> and the adverse possessor, within six months, makes an application to the
> court for an order to vest the title in him or lodges an application for
> possessory title._

  
  
After referring briefly to an Australian case, the Court of Appeal went on to
say (at pp 732-733):

> _It is therefore clear that, under the new LTA, adverse possession for
> registered land was to be abolished once and for all, save for the
> transitional provisions as provided in s 172(7) and (8). But adverse

> _

> `(1) Section 9 of the Limitation Act is amended by inserting, immediately

The Court of Appeal then considered the views of the Select Committee on the
Land Titles Bill as well as the Parliamentary debates on that Bill (at pp
733-734):

> _In the Report on the Land Titles Bill, the Select Committee had this to
> say:_

> _`..._

> _The amendment will not be retrospective. They will not affect squatters or
> mortgagees in possession who have already perfected their title by effluxion
> of time prior to the amendments._

> _An adverse possessor who has perfected his claim to a possessory title to
> unregistered land will not be required to apply to court for a vesting order
> within a specified time-frame. However, should the land be brought under the
> Land Titles Act through the issue of a qualified certificate of title, the

> _
>
> (a) a caution as to title remains on the certificate of title; or
>
> (b) the adverse possessor lodges a caveat before such caution has lapsed or

>
> _

> _This view was reiterated by the Minister for Law, Professor S Jayakumar,
> when he moved that the Land Titles Bill be read for the third time:_

> _`..._

> _I also wish to stress that the amendment is not retrospective. It will not
> affect those in possession who have already acquired their title by adverse
> possession prior to the amendment coming into force. Nor will such persons
> in possession be required to apply within a time-frame to the court for an
> order as to their title to the land._

> _I should point out that should any land become registered land through the
> issue of a qualified certificate of title, an adverse possessor`s claim to
> the land will remain protected only as long as, first, a caution as to title
> remains on the certificate of title; and second, the adverse possessor
> lodges a caveat before such caution has lapsed or been cancelled._

> _Secondly, cl 172(9) [now s 172(8) of the new LTA] enables persons who have

> flexibility.`_

  
  
At the end of the analysis, the Court of Appeal concluded (at p 735):

> _Thus we agreed with the learned judge when he said that as of 1 March 1994
> there were only two categories of adverse possession claims in respect of
> registered land under the new LTA which were found in s 172(7) and (8) of
> the same Act. However, it is quite clear that these two categories apply to
> land which was already registered land as of 1 March 1994 as can be seen
> from the wording of s 172(7) and (8). For unregistered land or land which
> becomes registered land after that date, the applicable provisions are s
> 177(3) of the 1993 LTA._

> _Consistent with this view is**Wong Kok Chin** `s case and also **Tan Eng
> Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd** [1991] 3 MLJ 234  which dealt with a similar
> claim as that of Balwant`s under the repealed LTA. It was held there that
> where the adverse possessor had completed the requisite period of 12 years`
> possession before the land was brought under the repealed Act and a
> qualified certificate of title issued, the adverse possessor`s interest
> would still subsist. This is because where there had been 12 years of
> adverse possession before the land became registered land, the rights of the
> documentary owner would already have been extinguished before the conversion
> to registered land. Accordingly s 50 of the new LTA would not apply to
> defeat the adverse possessor`s accrued claim. The adverse possessor`s claim
> in those circumstances were preserved by s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA._

  
  
In **Shell Eastern Petroleum v Goh Chor Cheok** [2000] 1 SLR 45 , in or about
1961, when developers built a block of flats on land adjoining the plaintiffs`
land, they built a retaining wall which, it was since discovered, encroached
on the plaintiffs` land. By 1973, the plaintiffs` right of action over the
encroached portion would have been extinguished. Three events occurred since
1973. Firstly, in November 1992, the plaintiffs` then common law land was
brought under the Land Titles Act and a qualified title issued. Secondly, the
1993 amendments to the Land Titles Act limited or abolished the acquisition of
title by adverse possession in respect of both common law land and registered
land. Thirdly, the caution on the qualified title was cancelled on 2 May 1996
upon the plaintiffs` application and their title became unqualified
thereafter. The question before the court was whether any of these three
events had any effect on the position, which had been reached by 1973, that
action to recover the strip of land in question had become statute-barred. The
adverse possessors did not lodge any caveat in respect of the disputed plot.  
  
Warren Khoo J dismissed the plaintiffs` claim. On the question of the failure
to lodge a caveat, the judge referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal
delivered by Chan Sek Keong J in **Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph** [1992]
2 SLR 161 :

> _
>
> 11 The relevant provisions of s 20 read as follows:
>
> `(2) any person claiming an interest in land which was subsisting at the
> date of issue of a qualified certificate of title for that land may, so long
> as a caution remains on the folio of the land-register, protect that
> interest by a caveat pursuant to section 104, and the Registrar shall enter
> a notification of such a caveat in the land-register.`
>
> His honour held that the failure to lodge a caveat did not have the effect
> of reviving the title of the true owner which had been extinguished by
> limitation. He said:
>
> `It is clear from s 20 of the Act that until the registered proprietor of
> land held under qualified title obtains the cancellation of the caution, his
> title will always be subject to subsisting interests affecting his title.
>
> The only person who is able to obtain title free from any prior interests
> affecting such land is a purchaser when that caution expires against him
> after five years from the date of conversion and when the caution is
> cancelled on his application.`
>
> His honour went on to say:
>
> `The caveat referred to in s 42(3) is intended to protect the rights of an
> adverse possessor against a purchaser, and not against the registered
> proprietor. The right of a person in adverse possession of registered land
> falling within the terms of s 42(3) can only be defeated by a purchaser
> where such right is not protected by caveat, or by the registered proprietor
> lodging a reassertion of ownership before his title has been extinguished by
> limitation.`
>

> _

> _..._

> _
>
> 27 As for caveats, there is no relevant difference between the provisions of
> the current Act and those in the repealed Act. Section 27(2) of the current
> edition of the Act provides as follows:
>
> `Any person claiming an interest in land which is subsisting at the date of

Similarly, in **Chuan Hong Auto v Shell Eastern Petroleum** [1996] 1 SLR 415 ,
the Court of Appeal held that the automatic lapsing of the caution did not
affect the interest of equitable lessees of the land who had already lodged a
caveat before the lapsing.  
  
The question of law in the present case therefore turns entirely on the effect
of the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise not having lodged any caveat against the
disputed plot before the expiration of the five-year period provided under s
25(2) of the Land Titles Act. Clearly, the company here is a purchaser of the
entire estate or interest within the meaning of that subsection and no fraud
has been alleged against it.  
  
Section 42 of the repealed Land Titles Act could not have applied to the land
here as it was brought within the registered land regime only in June 1994.
For the same reason, s 172(7) and (8) of the present Act can have no
application to the land here. This is clear from the Court of Appeal`s
reasoning in **_Balwant Singh_** (supra). Accordingly, s 177(3) of the 1993
Land Titles Act would protect the existing rights of the owners of 1 and 3
Bedok Rise if adverse possession of the disputed plot has crystallized before
1 March 1994.  
  
However, there is great force in the company`s arguments that those owners
ought to have been vigilant and lodged caveats, particularly as notice of the
purchase of the land was given to them back in 1996, although no notice of the
conversion to registered title appears to have been similarly given. It would
appear from the Select Committee`s Report and the Parliamentary debates that a
caveat is an essential step to protecting an adverse possessor`s claim should
the land become registered land through the issue of a qualified certificate
of title. This was also the view of Warren Khoo J in **_Shell Eastern
Petroleum v Goh Chor Cheok_**(supra), at least where protection is sought
against a purchaser of the registered land. Lodgment of a caveat is
permissible under s 27(2) of the Land Titles Act. This is not an entirely new
provision. It has a broad equivalent in s 20(2) of the repealed Act (see
Warren Khoo J`s judgment in the abovementioned case). However, apart from this
general provision which includes interests beyond adverse possession, there is
no specific provision along the lines of s 42(3) of the repealed Land Titles
Act which spelt out clearly that the right of an adverse possessor was
protected only if `that right has been protected by caveat`. I therefore hold
that s 177(3) of the 1993 Land Titles Act applies here notwithstanding the
failure of the owners to lodge caveats before the lapsing of the caution. The
adverse possessors` rights are thereby preserved and Double L & T Pte Ltd`s
and the company`s rights have been extinguished.  
  
Accordingly, on the question of law in issue, I held that, if adverse
possession has crystallized before 1 March 1994, the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok
Rise have become the owners of the disputed plot and their rights and
interests over the said plot cannot be overreached by the events thereafter. I
also ordered costs to be paid by the company to the said owners in respect of
the arguments pertaining to this issue of law.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
