** Judgment **

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. This is an appeal by the plaintiff against my order granting the
defendant’s application for orders under section 175 of the Evidence Act to be
issued to Bangkok Bank Ltd, ABN Amro Bank, Citibank N.A. and Development Bank
of Singapore Ltd. The second and third banks were represented by counsel at
the hearing, but did not take part in the arguments. The other two banks were
not represented although they were also served with the application.

2\. The defendant is a bank, and the plaintiff was a customer of the bank. The
plaintiff engaged in foreign exchange transactions through the bank and
incurred substantial losses. He commenced this action against the defendant
for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, breach of contractual duty of
care, breach of duty in tort, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract,
mandate or instructions.

3\. He alleged that he was not properly advised by the defendant’s officers on
the transactions that he made and in particular, that they did not advise him
on "swap points" that may be imposed. The defendant however, asserted in its
defence that

> > (T)he plaintiff has shown himself to be an experienced and/or
> sophisticated investor in the foreign exchange market who understood that
> the concept of "swap points" as reflecting the interest rates differential
> between US$ and the MYR for a given period and would have been aware that
> the trading of the 12-month forward hedge was affected by "swap points".1

4\. The plaintiff on the other hand maintained that his experience was in
investments in equities.2

5\. Consequently, the defendant applied that the plaintiff gives discovery
under Order 24 of the Rules of Court of "(a)ll documents, including without
limitation, any and all statements, correspondence, confirmation notes,
confirmation advice, facility letters and documents of any other description
whatsoever, showing the date, nature and value of all Transactions effected by
or on behalf of the Plaintiff through the following entities for the period
January 1987 to December 1997" with the first three of the aforenamed banks
and with "(a)ny other bank and/or financial institution and/or financial
intermediary and/or brokerage and/or any similar entity, whether situate in
Singapore or elsewhere in the world." The transactions were defined as "(a)ll
investments in and/or purchase and/or sale of listed and unlisted securities,
bonds, mutual funds, unit trusts, options, futures contracts, currencies,
commodities, derivatives and/or investments and financial instruments of any
other description whatsoever."

6\. The application was heard in the first instance by an Assistant Registrar
on 15 Feb 2002. The application was opposed by the plaintiff. After hearing
counsel for both parties the Assistant Registrar granted the application.

7\. The plaintiff appealed against this order. When the appeal came for
hearing before me the matters and issues including the relevance of the
documents were comprehensively addressed in the course of arguments on 26 and
27 Feb. After hearing and considering the merits of the submissions, I
dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff did not appeal against my decision.

8\. However, he did not give discovery of the documents. He deposed in an
affidavit on 5 March that the documents were not in his possession, custody or
power and he was unable to locate them despite extensive efforts because they
had been moved to different premises on four occasions.

9\. The defendant then sought to get the same records from the banks. It
applied for and served writs of subpoenas on the Bangkok Bank Ltd, ABN Amro
Bank, Citibank N.A. and Development Bank of Singapore Ltd for them to produce
the documents.

10\. The ABN Amro Bank was concerned that compliance with the subpoena may
breach the obligation of confidentiality under section 47 of the Banking Act.
It applied by summons-in-chambers No. 920 of 2002P for a determination whether
it was precluded by s 47 from complying with the subpoena.

11\. When the application came on for hearing before me on 29 April, counsel
for the defendant submitted that s 175 of the Evidence Act operated as an
exception to s 47. I directed that the defendant apply under s 175 for the
bank to make the disclosures.

12\. In compliance with the direction, the defendant filed summons-in-chambers
No. 1595/2002/F that the four banks allow the defendant’s solicitors to
inspect and take copies of the documents pursuant to s 175 from the same
documents covered by the order of court of 15 Feb.

13\. While writing these grounds of decision, it occurred to me that the
plaintiff may not have done enough to get those documents. Even if he did not
have those documents with him, the banks would have them, and he could get
them from the banks.

14\. I refer to _Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd_ [1980] 1 WLR 627, a
decision of the House of Lords. In this case, the plaintiff Lonrho wanted
discovery of documents in the possession of the defendant Shell Petroleum’s
subsidiary companies in Rhodesia and South Africa. The subsidiary companies
refused to disclose the documents on the grounds that they cannot do that
without ministerial licence.

15\. The question was raised whether the documents were in Shell Petroleum’s
power for the purposes of O.24 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, which is
similar to O.24 of our Rules of Court.

16\. Lord Diplock who delivered the judgment of the court stated at p 635

> > (I)n the context of the phrase "possession, custody or power" the
> expression "power" must, in my view, mean a presently enforceable legal
> right to obtain from whoever actually holds the document inspection of it
> without the need to obtain the consent of anyone else. Provided that the
> right is presently enforceable, the fact that for physical reasons it may
> not be possible for the person entitled to it to obtain immediate inspection
> would not prevent the document from being within his power; but in the
> absence of a presently enforceable right there is, in my view, nothing in
> Order 24 to compel a party.

and held that the documents were not in Shell Petroleum’s power because Shell
Petroleum could not have access without the ministerial licence.

17\. In the present case, the plaintiff, as a customer or former customer of
the banks, would have a right to the documents, subject to the payment of
copying and other related charges.

18\. In the event the plaintiff who did not take steps to get the documents
from the banks opposed the defendant’s efforts to get them from the same
source.

_

The provisions in question

_

19\. Section 47(1) and (2) of the Banking Act provide that

> > (1) Customer information shall not, in any way, be disclosed by a bank in
> Singapore or any of its officers to any other person except as expressly
> provided in this Act.
>>

>> (2) A bank in Singapore or any of its officers may, for such purpose as may
be specified in the first column of the Sixth Schedule, disclose customer
information to such persons or class of persons as may be specified in the
second column of that Schedule, and in compliance with such conditions as may
be specified in the third column of that Schedule.

20\. The Schedule provided that disclosure can be made when "[It] is necessary
for compliance with an order of the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof pursuant
to the powers conferred under Part IV of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97)."3

21\. Section 175(1) of the Evidence Act (which is in Part IV) provides that

> > On the application of any party to a legal proceeding, the court or a
> Judge may order that such party be at liberty to inspect and take copies of
> any entries in a banker’s book for any of the purposes of such proceedings.

and "bankers’ book" is defined in s 170 –

> > "Bankers’ books" includes ledgers, day books, cash books, account books
> and all other books used in the ordinary business of the bank.

_

The plaintiff’s objections

_

22\. The plaintiff opposed the defendant’s application. The grounds of
opposition were

> > (1) The application is not in compliance with Part IV of the Evidence Act.
>>

>> (2) The application is made in bad faith and is a fishing expedition for
evidence to bolster the defence.

>>

>> (3) The application is made for the collateral and improper purpose of
seeking the court’s sanction to violate s 47.

>>

>> (4) The documents are not necessary under O.24 r 7 of the Rules of Court.

>>

>> (5) The documents are not bankers’ books.

_

The defendant’s submissions

_

23\. Mr Hri Kumar counsel for the defendant stated that the documents sought
under this application were the same documents in the Assistant Registrar’s
order of 15 Feb which I affirmed on 27 Feb.

24\. He submitted that the issue of the relevance of the documents had been
dealt with then, and the only issue left to be dealt with is whether the court
has the power to order the banks to give discovery of the documents. He argued
that the court has the power because s 47 allows banks to comply with orders
issued under s 175. He contended further that the documents referred to were
bankers’ books under s 175.

_

The application is not in compliance with Part IV of the Evidence Act

_

25\. The plaintiff submitted that

> > It is plain as night follows day that the Writs of Subpoena referred to in
> the Schedule in SIC 1595 are not "court orders" made pursuant to said s.174.
> In short, the Writs of Subpoena are of no legal effect whatsoever as they do
> not come within purview of the legal requirements as aforesaid and therefore
> the present SIC 1595 must fail _in limine. 4_

26\. The schedule in summons-in-chambers No. 1595 of 2002 does not refer to
any writs of subpoena.

27\. The defendant had caused the subpoenas to be issued before making the
present application. It then filed the application when it realised that an
order under s 175 may be necessary before a bank can comply with the
subpoenas.

28\. The plaintiff has misunderstood the application. The defendant was not
proceeding on the basis that a subpoena is a court order. It was seeking a
court order to ensure that a bank will not contravene with s 47 if it complied
with the subpoena.

_

The application is made in bad faith and is a fishing expedition

_

29\. The defendant had at the outset stated that it wanted to have access to
the documents. It applied for and obtained an order for discovery and
inspection despite the plaintiff’s objections.

30\. The issue of the relevance of the documents to the proceedings was
determined in that application. The defendant then sought from the banks the
same documents that the plaintiff should have supplied. There is no basis for
impugning bad faith on the application.

_

The application is made for the collateral and improper purpose of seeking the
court’s sanction to violate s 475

_

31\. The plaintiff submitted that

> > (T)he Plaintiff has categorically stated in his Affidavit that his "bank
> accounts are not relevant to the issue of ‘swap points’ in a forward foreign
> exchange contract".
>>

>> In the circumstances, it is evident that the present application is also a
reckless attempt by the Defendants to "get behind the affidavit" of the
Plaintiff and so eschew one of the essential safeguards provided under Part IV
section 175 of the Evidence Act.6

32\. The defendant does not have to accept the plaintiff’s averment on the
bank accounts. It is entitled to apply to court to have discovery of them.

33\. The plaintiff’s complaint that the defendant was seeking the court’s
sanction to violate s 47 has no substance shorn of the emotional hyperbole. A
court will not sanction any violation of the law. Section 47 is not violated
when an order of court under s 175 is obtained. A court will not make an order
without careful consideration, but there is no violation of s 47 when an order
is made. The plaintiff, on the other hand asserts that he has lost possession
of the documents for which he was ordered to give discovery, but he would not
obtain them from the banks himself, and seeks to prevent the defendant from
getting them from the banks directly.

_

The documents are not necessary within Order 24 r 7 of the Rules of Court

_

34\. This was an issue in the application for discovery and inspection. It was
argued before the Assistant Registrar and on appeal, before me. There being no
further appeal, it has been determined conclusively that those documents are
relevant to the action.

_

The documents in the application are not bankers’ books

_

35\. The plaintiff submitted that

> > The facts as presented … by the bank’s senior legal officer, casts the
> drag net far and wide to include letters from the Plaintiff to the Bank and
> vice versa including contracts of all shapes and form so to speak. The
> expression ‘bankers’ books’ has to be interpreted "ejusdem generis" with the
> other documents listed. It is, therefore, submitted that, correspondence,
> confirmation notes, confirmation advice and facility letters cannot be
> considered as being of the same genre as _ledgers, day books, cash books and
> account books_. The documents required by the Defendant are not book entries
> in the ordinary meaning intended by the Act and, consequently, they are as
> different as a mouthful of chalk and cheese.7

36\. The plaintiff referred to _Williams v Williams_[1988] 1 QB 161 which
dealt with an application to inspect unsorted cheques and paying-in slips in
the possession of a bank. He quoted Sir John Donaldson M.R.’s judgment where
he stated at page 168

> > I am quite unable to accept that adding an individual cheque or paying-in
> slip can be regarded as making an "entry" in those records. Putting the
> matter in another way, "other records" in the new definition has, I think,
> to be construed ejusdem generis with "ledgers, day books, cash books and
> account books" and unsorted bundles of cheques and paying-in slips are not
> "other records" within the meaning of the Act.

Relying on this, he submitted that "if cheques and paying-in slips do not come
within the meaning of ‘bankers’ books’, then _a fortiori_ , neither do
correspondence, confirmation notes, confirmation advice and facility
letters."8

37\. The plaintiff would have understood the judge better by reading the
paragraph in its entirety -

> > In this situation Mr Ryder, appearing for the applicant, has to submit,
> and does submit, that the bundles of cheques and paying-in slips constitute
> bankers’ books within the modern definition and that addition each cheque or
> paying-in slip to the bundle constitutes making an entry in those books.
> Whilst I would be prepared to accept that the cheques constitute part of the
> bank’s records used in the ordinary business of the bank (_Reg. v. Jones
> (Benjamin_) [1978] 1 W.L.R. 195, a case concerned with a bill of lading put
> in evidence under the Criminal Evidence Act 1965), I am quite unable to
> accept that adding an individual cheque or paying-in slip can be regarded as
> making an "entry" in those records. Putting the matter in another way,
> "other records" in the new definition has, I think, to be construed ejusdem
> generis with "ledgers, day books, cash books and account books" and unsorted
> bundles of cheques and paying-in slips are not "other records" within the
> meaning of the Act.

38\. The judge made a distinction between unsorted cheques and paying-in
slips, which he did not regard as entries in bankers’ books, and sorted
cheques which he was prepared to accept as part of a bank’s records.

39\. In the same light the documents referred to in the application are not
unsorted documents. Correspondence, confirmation notes, confirmation advice
and facility letters are documents a bank would file and keep in the course of
its ordinary business. It is necessary for a bank to maintain such records,
and to refer to from time to time, for example, to ensure that facilities are
not exceeded or that instructions are carried out. Such records are bankers’
books even if they are not in use every day, so long as they are referred to
when necessary – see _The Asylum for Idiots v Handysides_ (1906) 22 TLR 573.
None of the banks served with the application have stated that they do not
keep such records. In any event it is open to the banks to object or seek
clarification on any document if any dispute or uncertainty should arise
whether it forms part of a banker’s book.

40\. Having examined the plaintiff’s objections and finding no merits in them,
I granted the defendant’s application.
