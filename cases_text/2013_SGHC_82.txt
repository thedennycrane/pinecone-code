Introduction

1 This was a hearing to determine ancillary matters between Teo Siew Ngoh
(“the Wife”) and Ng Hock Huat (“the Husband”) subsequent to an interim
judgment of divorce granted on 17 October 2011 to the Wife. After hearing
counsel for both parties, I made the following orders:

(a) The property at 19 Chuan Walk, Singapore 558425 (“the matrimonial
property”) was to be sold within 180 days of 19 February 2013 at or above
valuation to be determined by the average of two valuations carried out by
reputable valuers such as Knight Frank, CBRE or Jones Lang La Salle and, less
commission, sale, legal and incidental expenses, the net sale proceeds were to
be apportioned 35% and 65% respectively in favour of the Wife and the Husband.
Each party would refund from its own share of the sale proceeds all its CPF
withdrawals or contributions (inclusive of interest) utilised in the purchase;

(b) The Husband was to pay to the Wife in lieu of periodic maintenance a lump
sum of $180,000 which was to be deducted from the Husband’s share of the sale
proceeds of the matrimonial property;

(c) In addition, the Husband was to pay to the Wife $58,500 from his other
assets, which sum was also to be deducted from the Husband’s share of the sale
proceeds of the matrimonial property; and

(d) Costs for the entire proceedings were awarded to the Wife fixed at $4,000
excluding disbursements on a reimbursement basis.

2 The Wife is dissatisfied with my decision and has appealed (in Civil Appeal
No 30 of 2013) against all the orders that I made save for the order on costs.
I now set out the reasons for my decision.

Background

3 The parties were married on 16 July 1981. They have one son and one daughter
who are presently 28 and 26 years of age respectively and working. On 17
October 2011, interim judgment dissolving the marriage was granted to the Wife
on the basis of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour.

4 The Wife works as a part-time tutor at a child care centre while the Husband
works as a construction project manager earning a substantial salary. Before
the Husband moved out of the matrimonial home in August 2010 (apparently to
live with another woman), he gave the Wife a monthly allowance of $2,300 (out
of which $400 was paid to the Husband’s parents). After the Husband moved out,
the Wife received $1,500 per month until December 2011, after which the
Husband stopped paying her any allowance altogether.

8 The Husband’s total assets (excluding the matrimonial property) amounted to
S$550,785.47 and NZ$3,476.82. I accepted the Husband’s submission that the
total assets amounted to S$554,297.00

Division of matrimonial assets

The law

9 The court is empowered by s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev
Ed) (“the Charter”) to make a division of matrimonial assets in such
proportions as it deems just and equitable. In making such a division, the
court is duty bound to consider all the circumstances of the case and the
following factors listed in s 112(2) of the Charter:

(a)the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or
work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

(b)any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for
their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

(c)the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

(d)the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the
family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged
or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

(e)any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and
division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

(f)any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in
the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

(g)the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party
(whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or
support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation
or business; and

(f)the matters referred to in s 114(1) so far as they are relevant.

10 It is trite law that a broad brush approach should be adopted to achieve a
just and equitable division of matrimonial assets (_Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang
Choo Nancy and another appeal_ [2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [78] (“ _Yeo Chong Lin_
”); _NK v NL_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“ _NK v NL_ ”) at [26]). This approach
takes into account both the financial and non-financial contributions of the
parties but does not meticulously investigate every minute sum and/or expense
each party has paid or incurred (_Yeo Chong Lin_ at [78]; _NK v NL_ at [26]).

Application of the law to the facts

11 The Wife submitted that the matrimonial property should be sold on the open
market and that 65% of the sale proceeds should be awarded to her. At the
hearing, counsel for the Wife (Helen Chia) clarified when queried by this
court that the 65% share was derived by taking the sum of:

(a) 4.3% for her direct financial contribution of $40,000 towards the purchase
price of the matrimonial property;

(b) 30% for her indirect financial and non-financial contributions during the
marriage; and

(c) 30.7% in lieu of maintenance.

12 Leaving aside for the moment the Wife’s lump sum maintenance claim of
30.7%, the Wife was essentially claiming a 34.3% share of the matrimonial
property.

13 As for the other assets, the Wife contended that she was entitled to 35% of
the Husband’s assets apart from the matrimonial property _i.e._ 35% of
$554,297 (see [8] above) on the basis of their 30 year marriage.

14 The Husband argued that he was entitled to 70% of all the matrimonial
assets while the Wife was entitled to 30% thereof because she had made very
little financial contributions during the marriage.

The matrimonial home

15 It was undisputed between the parties that the Wife had contributed
approximately 4% of the purchase price (_viz_ $40,000) while the Husband had
contributed the rest. Both parties asserted that they had made extensive
contributions towards the maintenance and upkeep of the matrimonial property.
In my judgment, the Husband had made substantially all of the financial
contributions towards the matrimonial property because the Wife had stopped
working to look after the children in 1984.

16 In terms of non-financial contributions, it was undisputed that the Wife
had performed household chores and looked after the two children during the
long marriage. The Husband played a subsidiary role by ferrying the children
to and from school and other activities, attending to minor household chores
at home and helping the children in their homework.

17 Adopting a broad brush approach, I was of the view that it was just and
equitable that the Wife be awarded 35% share in the matrimonial property,
thereby giving her an extra 31% share over and above her direct financial
contribution of 4%.

The other assets

18 Apart from the matrimonial property, the Wife and Husband had other assets
amounting to $94,155.54 and $554,297 respectively. However, the Wife’s figure
of $94,155.54 was an understatement because it did not include the values of
her various insurance policies. I therefore accepted the Husband’s submission
that the Wife’s other assets amounted to $387,154 which meant that his other
assets exceeded hers by $167,143 ($554,297–$387,154). The Wife’s higher asset
sum was not challenged by the Wife at the hearing.

19 Having regard to the length of the marriage and the Wife’s contributions in
looking after the house and the children which allowed the Husband to
concentrate on and advance his career, I was of the view that like the
matrimonial property, it was just and equitable to award the Wife 35% of the
Husband’s surplus assets of $167,143 _viz._ $58,500.

Maintenance

The applicable law

20 Section 113 of the Charter empowers the court to make an order for
maintenance. In granting such an order, the court has to consider all the
circumstances of the case, including the factors set out in s 114(1) of the
Charter:

(a)the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which
each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the
foreseeable future;

(b)the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the
parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

(c)the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the
marriage;

(d)the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

(e)any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;
and

(f)the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the
welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the
home or caring for the family.

21 The power to order maintenance is exercised in a manner supplementary to
the power to divide matrimonial assets, such that the court takes account of
each party’s share of the assets; the order for maintenance plays a
complementary role to the order for assets (_BG v BF_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at
[75]). The aim is to even out any financial inequalities between the spouses,
taking into account any economic prejudice suffered by the wife during
marriage (_Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok Dennis_ [2004] 3 SLR(R) 376 at
[27]). The court should also endeavour to place the parties in the financial
position in which they would have been had the marriage not broken down
insofar as it is practicable and just to do so (s 114(2) of the Charter).

Decision on maintenance

22 The Wife submitted that she should be awarded a lump sum of $300,000
($2,000 monthly for 12.5 years) in lieu of periodic maintenance. Her claim was
based on the $2,300 monthly allowance given to her before the Husband moved
out. The Wife further contended that a lump sum would allow her to have a
clean break with the Husband.

23 The Husband submitted that he should only pay her a monthly maintenance of
$500 because the Wife works part-time and can rely on the financial support of
their working children who are both graduates. In addition, the Husband
contended that he would be unable to pay a lump sum in lieu of monthly
maintenance because he had to repay a substantial housing loan of $664,000 on
his property at 224 Westwood Avenue (see [7] above).

24 In my view, a lump sum maintenance award of $180,000 ($1,000 per month for
15 years) would be a fair and equitable amount in the circumstances. Since
both children are working and living with the Wife, a substantial part of her
financial needs could reasonably be met by the children. Further, the Wife
would no longer need to give a monthly sum of $400 to the Husband’s parents.
In arriving at my decision, I also took into account the Wife’s age (54 years)
and the low likelihood of her remarrying, the Husband’s age (55 years) and his
desire to retire, the current life expectancy of women (84.1 years as observed
in _Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon_ [2012] 3 SLR 402 at [75]) and the fact that
the Husband has a woman in his life with whom he may start another family.

Costs

25 I awarded fixed costs of the entire proceedings to the Wife in line with
the principle that costs follow the event.
