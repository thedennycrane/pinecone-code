**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

_THE CHARGES_

1 The Accused, a 43 year old male, pleaded guilty to three Charges of having
carnal intercourse against the order of nature, an offence punishable under
Section 377 of the Penal Code. Two of these Charges alleged that he engaged in
anal intercourse with a now 13-year-old boy (whom I shall refer to as "MF") in
September 1999 and February 2000. The third Charge accused him of having
performed an act of fellatio on a 14-year-old boy (whom I shall call "S")
between 1st and 20th February 2000.

2 Six other Charges were admitted by the Accused and taken into consideration
for the purpose of sentencing with his consent. Three of these Charges alleged
that the Accused engaged in anal intercourse with MF in May or June 1999 and
performed fellatio on MF in September 1999 and in February 2000, while one
Charge alleged that he performed fellatio on S between 20 February and 15
March 2000. The remaining two Charges taken into consideration concerned the
possession of obscene and uncensored and uncertificated video compact discs,
offences under the Films Act.

__

THE STATEMENT OF FACTS

3 The Accused, MF and S all reside in the Yishun public housing estate. At the
material times, MF and S were students. All nine offences in question were
committed in the Accused’s flat.

4 The Accused introduced himself to and befriended the two boys in a games
arcade at North Point Shopping Centre sometime in early 1999. He subsequently
invited them to his flat. Since that time, the two boys would meet the accused
at either of these two places.

5 In September 1999, MF went to the Accused’s flat. The Accused, who was
alone, invited MF to watch an obscene film together. While watching it in the
living room of the flat, the Accused removed MF’s shorts and asked him to bend
forward with his hands placed on the sofa. He then inserted his penis into
MF’s anus and ejaculated later on MF’s buttocks. He gave MF some money before
the boy left the flat.

6 In February 2000, MF went again to the Accused’s flat where the exact same
story as above was repeated.

7 That same month, S also visited the Accused at his flat. The Accused was
alone. He asked S to watch an obscene film with him. During the show, he
pulled down S’s shorts and underwear to knee level. He then performed fellatio
on S until S ejaculated. He then gave S some money before the boy left the
flat.

8 On 29 February 2000, at about 10.15 pm, MF lodged a police report in which
he stated that earlier that evening, the Accused brought him to his flat,
showed him obscene films and then molested him. On 3 May 2000, the Accused was
arrested by the police in his flat.

THE MITIGATION PLEA

10 The Accused, speaking in Hokkien, informed me that he was not married and
was living with his 69 year old mother. His father had passed away. He urged
me to be lenient so that he could be released earlier to take care of his
mother. He also requested that his sentence be backdated to the date he was
first remanded.

11 The Accused said he was remorseful and that he did not use force or
violence on the boys in committing the offences. He asserted that he was "not
that sort of person". When I asked him to explain what he meant by this, he
merely expanded the statement to "I am not the sort of person who likes to do
these acts".

THE DECISION OF THE COURT

12 Section 377 of the Penal Code provides:

> "Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with
> any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or
> with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be
> liable to fine.
>
> Explanation – Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse
> necessary to the offence described in this section."

13 The Prosecution relied on the guiding principles in sentencing paedophiles
involved in unnatural carnal intercourse enunciated by the Court of Appeal in
_Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v P.P._ [1998] 1 SLR 801. In that case, Kelvin Lim
pleaded guilty before the High Court to 10 Charges – four under Section 377 of
the Penal Code for having carnal intercourse against the order of nature, one
for attempted carnal intercourse against the order of nature and five under
Section 377A for committing acts of gross indecency with another male person.
He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on each of the four Charges under
Section 377 of the Penal Code, five years imprisonment for the attempted
offence and one year imprisonment for each of the five Charges under Section
377A of the Penal Code. The terms of imprisonment for the four Charges under
Section 377 of the Penal Code were ordered to run consecutively while the
remaining sentences were ordered to run concurrently with these four. The
result was that the Accused in that case was sentenced to a total of 40 years
in prison. 10 Charges under Section 377 and 20 Charges under Section 377A of
the Penal Code were also taken into consideration.

14 Five victims were involved in that case and they were all young boys aged
between 8 and 12 at the time of the offences. Kelvin Lim met and befriended
the first two victims (who were brothers) at an amusement centre. He became
their informal guardian and built up trust and confidence by bringing them on
fun-filled outings and giving them free tuition in their HDB flat. He engaged
in both anal and oral intercourse with the boys and promised them that he
would purchase computer games as gifts for them as a reward.

15 Kelvin Lim got to know the other three victims through the two brothers.
Through free tuition and outings, he also enticed those three boys to engage
in unnatural carnal intercourse with him.

16 Upon his arrest, Kelvin Lim confessed readily to the offences. After his
arrest, he was diagnosed as having paedophilia of the exclusive type and was
recommended hormonal therapy. He refused this treatment and opted for
psychological treatment with a psychologist but discontinued this after four
sessions. He had previous convictions for similar offences. In 1988, he was
convicted of two counts under Section 377 of the Penal Code and one count of
gross indecency under Section 377A of the Penal Code, with three other counts
under each of the said sections taken into consideration. The four victims
there were aged between 9 and 12 years. In 1993, he was convicted on two
Charges of gross indecency under Section 377A with two other Charges taken
into consideration. The victim was a 9 year old boy.

17 The Court of Appeal said:

> "14 This is a case of a paedophile who abused the trust and confidence
> placed by the young victims in him and who had callously manipulated their
> innocence to satisfy his perverse sexual instincts. …
>
> 15 In addressing the question of whether the individual sentence imposed on
> the appellant on each charge under s 377 Penal Code was manifestly
> excessive, we would lay down some guidelines governing the sentencing for
> the offence of unnatural carnal intercourse involving children as victims,
> as well as set out the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors for such
> offences. These guidelines should not be taken as all-embracing or
> exhaustive. We emphasise that these guidelines would not apply in cases of
> offences of unnatural carnal intercourse committed between two consenting
> adults, which would carry wholly different considerations."

18 After pointing out that the Penal Code does not have separate provisions
for the offence of unnatural carnal intercourse involving children and that
involving adults, the Court of Appeal went on to state:

> "20 …. However, the starting position must be that where the victims are
> vulnerable children, the offence becomes much more serious and the
> punishment meted on such offenders has to reflect the gravity of the
> offence. …
>
> 21 In considering the appropriate tariffs for sentences, the gravity of the
> offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed had to be
> taken into account.
>
> _
>
> Gravity of the offence:
>

>> _(1) _Harm to the victims._ The harm to the victims include both the
physical and the emotional harm. The physical injury may be caused as the
direct result of penetration of the victim'’ anus (as in this case), which may
be exceedingly painful. Where the victims are very young, it may leave them
for life with embarrassing disabilities, as noted in the Wolfenden Report. In
addition, the victims are exposed to the risk of sexually transmitted
diseases. What is of greater concern is that violence or threats of violence
may be used to compel the victims to submit to the offender. Where violence or
threats of injury are used, the punishment should be more severe to deter
offenders from re-offending. The long-term emotional harm and psychological
scars to the victims cannot be underestimated, though there has been caution
in _R v Willis_(1974) 60 Cr App R 146 that the courts should not readily
assume that the victims will later develop homosexuality in life because they
have been sexually abused when young. Much will also depend on the support the
victims receive from their families._

>
> _(2) _Social danger._ Paedophilic offences are by their nature unpleasant
> and most distressing and the society has to express its marked disapproval
> for such harm to the young and vulnerable victims. The presumption is that
> the safety of the child must be paramount and chronic paedophiles who have a
> propensity to re-offend, because they are either totally unable or unwilling
> to control themselves, have to be put away for long periods._
>
> …
>
> _

24 Bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, we started from the position
that a paedophile who commits unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of
anal intercourse) against young children below the age of 14 years, without
any aggravating or mitigating factors, should be sentenced to ten years’
imprisonment. There should not be any difference whether the victim is a young
girl or a young boy. The court would then have to consider the aggravating and
mitigating factors in increasing or reducing the sentence. Second or repeat
offenders who are demonstrated to be a menace to society should be sentenced
to a far longer period. We again emphasise that these sentencing guidelines do
not necessarily apply to unnatural carnal intercourse between two consenting
adults.

25 We considered the relevant circumstances of the offence in placing a
particular offence according to its relative gravity.

_

Circumstances in which the offences are committed:

> _(1) _Abuse of trust and authority._ Where an offender is placed in a
> position of trust by the parents or by the victims, the breach of trust
> justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence. All
> those who have charge of children cannot abuse their positions for the sake
> of gratifying their sexual urges._

_(2) _Moral corruption._ Where the offender has enticed or cajoled the victims
to indulge in unnatural carnal intercourse by the promise of gifts (for
example, money) this has a very corrupting effect on the young victims,
especially adolescents: _R v Willis_. This should be reflected by a more
severe sentence."__

19 Where chronic paedophiles are involved, the Court of Appeal expressed the
following prospective guideline:

> "35 … The public protection justifies a long-term incarceration. In future,
> chronic paedophiles (such as the appellant) who are shown to be unable or
> unwilling to control themselves and who target children as victims should be
> sentenced to life imprisonment and if the offences have taken place after 20
> August 1997, it would mean imprisonment for the remainder of the prisoner’s
> natural life."

20 There was no evidence that the Accused in the present case was an
"irrepressible" or "chronic" paedophile but a paedophile he clearly was. As
noted by the Court of Appeal (at paragraph 31 of the judgment), paedophilia is
a condition where there is recurrent and intense sexually arousing fantasies,
sexual urges or sexual activities involving prepubertal children. Unlike
Kelvin Lim, he did not have previous similar convictions. Life imprisonment in
the circumstances would be too harsh for him. However, he did commit the
unnatural offences from about May 1999 to about March 2000, a period of some
11 months or so.

21 It was clear that the Accused knew where to fish and what would make the
fishes bite. He visited the games arcade where young boys were likely to
gather without the presence of supervising adults. He titillated the boys’
emergent erogenous zones with erotic films so that there was no need for
coercion. He rewarded them with money with the obvious objective of enticing
them into more such liaisons. All this required a predator’s ability to target
potential victims and to execute his perverse plan. While violence or threats
would aggravate the offences, the seeming consent of the young, vulnerable
victims did not make the offences any less repugnant. The law comes down hard
on adults who take advantage of the youth and innocence of those who do not
know better and who are easily led astray by enticing gifts or money. In fact,
the victim MF has Moderate Mental Retardation.

22 Like the Court of Appeal in _Kelvin Lim’s case_ , I found no significant
mitigating factors in the present case save for the plea of guilt which had
spared the two victims here the embarrassment of recounting in Court the
sordid acts which they had allowed the Accused to do to their bodies. However,
as was made clear in _Fu Foo Tong v PP_ [1995] 1 SLR 448 at page 455, it is
not axiomatic that every such plea confers an automatic entitlement to a
discount in the severity of sentence. Public interest has to be considered and
where protection of the young and innocent is concerned, public interest
practically reigns supreme.

23 The Court of Appeal’s sentencing guidelines (at paragraph 24 of the
judgment) apply to paedophiles performing anal intercourse on young children
below 14 years of age. The guidelines apply squarely to the first victim, MF,
who was 11 and 12 years old at the material times. Where the second victim S
was concerned, he was almost 15 years old at the time of the offences but did
not appear to have been materially more mature or intelligent than MF was.
Moreover, the unnatural carnal intercourse involved in the two Charges
concerning S was fellatio and not anal intercourse. In _Kelvin Lim_ , the acts
of fellatio were made the subject of Charges under Section 377A and not
Section 377 of the Penal Code. Section 377A carries a maximum imprisonment
term of only two years and Kelvin Lim received one year imprisonment for each
of the five Charges under Section 377A. Whether fellatio is made the subject
of a Charge under Section 377 or 377A of the Penal Code is a matter of
prosecutorial discretion. As the Court of Appeal there noted (at paragraph 16
of the judgment), since _PP v Kwan Kwong Weng_ [1997] 1 SLR 697, it is clear
that fellatio is regarded as unnatural carnal intercourse within the meaning
of Section 377 save for an exception that has no application here. In my view,
fellatio and anal intercourse involving two males are not really
distinguishable when they are the subject of Charges preferred under Section
377. Everything said about anal intercourse applies to oral intercourse except
for the potential physical injury caused by penetration of the victim’s anus.
Further, I do not think any distinction ought to be made on the basis of who
is penetrating whom. I am therefore of the opinion that the guidelines set by
the Court of Appeal should apply to the case of S in the same way as they
patently do in the case of MF.

24 Since there were no significant mitigating factors in the Accused’s favour,
I sentenced the Accused to 10 years imprisonment in respect of each of the
three Charges on which he was convicted.

25 In deciding how many of the sentences should run consecutively, I was not
faced with the manifold permutations that presented themselves in _Kelvin
Lim_. The application of Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code to the
facts of this case dictates that either two or all three imprisonment
sentences run consecutively. The "one transaction rule" was not applicable to
the Accused’s offences here as the three Charges were distinct in time and two
involved different victims. I also had regard to the other aspect of
consecutive sentences, the "totality principle". The nature and the
circumstances of the offences were abhorrent. The Accused’s antecedents were
not carnal in nature but they showed that he was a man given to crime for the
past 14 years. Society, especially the young and nave, must be protected from
his predatory instincts and tendencies. He thrust the two boys into the deep,
murky waters of sexual deviance before they were even ready to swim. The
report dated 2 June 2000 by Dr Bernadine Woo of the Child Guidance Clinic
showed that MF was exhibiting signs of emotional trauma. He was said to be
depressed, fearful and irritable. He has also suffered loss of appetite and
experienced interrupted sleep. He has been staying out late at night and has
become withdrawn, refusing to talk to his parents. Although his school grades
showed no deterioration, he has been irritable and inattentive since the
beginning of the year and has been frequently fighting with schoolmates. Over
the past two months before the report, he has been touching the genitalia of
three schoolmates and has hit a younger schoolmate who refused to caress him.

26 Bearing all the circumstances in mind, I was of the view that the Accused
should be kept out of society for 30 years. Accordingly, I ordered all three
sentences of 10 years imprisonment each to run consecutively with effect from
3 May 2000, the date he was apprehended.
