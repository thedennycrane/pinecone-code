: The appellant, Ong Phee Hoon James, was charged with five counts of having
harboured illegal immigration offenders under s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration
Act. He was tried and convicted in the district court on all five charges. The
district judge Zainol Abeedin Hussin (`the judge`) sentenced the appellant to
eight months` imprisonment on each charge. Two of the five sentences were
ordered to run consecutively while the remaining three terms were ordered to
run concurrently. Consequently, a term of 16 months` imprisonment was imposed
on the appellant.

On 1 October 1998, the appellant leased the premises at No 200 Jalan Sultan
[num ]15-06, Textile Centre, Singapore (`the premises`) to a Bangladeshi
national by the name of Ansar. The appellant and one Chua Guan Chye (`Chua`)
had jointly purchased the premises as an investment.  
  
At various times between July and October 1998, the five persons named in the
five charges, namely Mostaffa (PW6), Baskar Khan (PW2), Miras (PW5), Md Kalum
(PW3) and Zakirul Islam (PW4), were brought to the premises to stay. Each of
them was told that the appellant was the owner of the premises and that they
had to obtain his permission to stay at the premises. They were also informed
that the rental of $150 per month was payable on the fifth day of every month.  
  
At the trial, these five persons informed the court that they had been
introduced to the appellant who had, in turn, granted them permission to stay
at the premises. Thereafter, they stayed at the premises and paid the monthly
rental to the appellant through various intermediaries.  
  
On 13 October 1998, the police raided the premises and arrested 21 Bangladeshi
nationals including the five illegal immigrants named in the charges. All five
persons were illegal immigrants in that they had contravened s 6(1) of the
Immigration Act. Section 6(1) provides:

> _No person, other than a citizen of Singapore, shall enter or attempt to
> enter Singapore unless -_

> _
>
> (a) he is in possession of a valid entry permit or re-entry permit lawfully
> issued to him under section 10 or 11;
>
> (b) his name is endorsed upon a valid entry permit or re-entry permit in
> accordance with section 12, and he is in the company of the holder of that
> permit;
>
> (c) he is in possession of a valid pass lawfully issued to him to enter
> Singapore; or
>
> (d) he is exempted from this section by an order made under section 56.
>
> _

  
  
All of them had been charged and convicted for their illegal presence in
Singapore. They were each sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and four
strokes of the cane.  
  
**_The defence_**

****

In his defence, the appellant stated that he had never seen any of the five
illegal immigrants before. He claimed that in early 1998, he and Chua had
rented the premises out to one Faruk. Faruk had agreed to pay a monthly rental
of $1,850. A tenancy agreement dated 1 March 1998 was signed. In the course of
Faruk`s occupation of the premises, Chua collected rent from him on about five
occasions. Payment for the rest of the period was given to the appellant.
Faruk stayed at the premises from March until September or October 1998
although he had agreed to stay for a year. The appellant stated that he was
unaware of anyone other than Faruk and one Sony (a witness to the tenancy
agreement) staying at the premises during Faruk`s tenancy.  
  
In any event, the appellant contended that he had exercised due diligence in
ascertaining that Faruk was not an illegal immigrant. He stated that he had
checked Faruk`s passport and had noted that it bore a stamp indicating Faruk`s
entry into Singapore sometime in late February 1998. The appellant had also
asked for Faruk`s work permit but was told by the latter that he did not have
one as he was a businessman. The appellant also asked for and was shown Sony`s
passport. The details of Sony`s work permit were recorded next to Sony`s
signature in the tenancy agreement. As a precaution, the appellant inserted a
clause into the tenancy agreement requiring the tenant to ensure that no
illegal immigrant visited or stayed at the premises. There was also a clause
forbidding the tenant to assign, sublet or part with possession of the
premises.  
  
When Faruk gave up the tenancy, he introduced one Ansar to take over the
premises on the same terms. Another agreement (exh P-6) was entered into with
Ansar. Ansar moved into the premises on 1 October 1998. Subsequently, the
appellant heard that police raided the premises on 13 October 1998.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

The judge found the appellant guilty as charged.  
  
**_Identification of the appellant_**

****

The judge rejected the appellant`s defence that he had not seen any of the
five illegal immigrants before. This was because the five illegal immigrants
had no difficulty identifying the appellant as the owner of the premises. They
claimed that they had each been introduced to the appellant when they were
brought to the premises to stay.  
  
**_Due diligence_**

****

The judge also did not accept the appellant`s claim that he had exercised due
diligence in a manner that would afford him a defence to the offence under s
57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act with which he was charged. Section 57(1)(d) of
the Immigration Act provides:

> _
>
> (1) Any person who -
>
> ...
>
> (d) harbours any person who has acted in contravention of the provisions of
> this Act or the regulations;
>
> ...
>
> _

> _shall be guilty of an offence ..._

  
  
Section 57(9) of the same Act provides:

> _In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1)(d) or (e), it shall
> not be a defence for the defendant to prove that the person harboured or
> employed by him was in possession of a pass or permit issued to the person
> under the Act or the Regulations unless the defendant further proves that he
> had exercised due diligence to ascertain that the pass or permit was at the
> material time valid under this Act or the regulations._

  
  
Section 57(10) (as it was before the amendment that came into effect on 5
October 1998) provides:

> _For the purposes of subsection (9) a defendant shall not be deemed to have
> exercised due diligence unless he had personally checked the passport or
> other travel documents of the person whom he had harboured or employed and
> had reasonable ground to believe that -_

> _
>
> (a) the person harboured or employed by him had, at the material time, in
> force a pass or permit issued under this Act or the regulations; and
>
> (b) where such person is the holder of a valid pass, that person had, at the
> material time, in force a work permit under the Employment of Foreign
> Workers Act (Cap 91A) or had obtained the written consent of the Controller
> to work in Singapore.
>
> _

  
  
Although the appellant did take precautions to ensure that Faruk, Sony, Ansar
and two of Ansar`s uncles were not illegal immigrants, these steps were not
relevant as the appellant was charged with harbouring other persons, those
other persons being the five illegal immigrants named in the charges. There
was no evidence that the appellant had personally checked the passport of
Mostaffa, Baskar Khan, Miras, Md Kalum or Zakirul Islam. Further, the
appellant did not claim that he had reasonable grounds to believe that these
five individuals each had a valid pass or permit that was issued under the
Immigration Act or regulations. Accordingly, the judge did not think that the
appellant had a valid defence in this regard.  
  
In any event, the judge did not think that the precautionary steps taken by
the appellant in relation to Faruk and Ansar were sufficient to constitute due
diligence under s 57(9) of the Immigration Act. According to Chua, Faruk only
had a 14-day pass. This would have been apparent to the appellant if he had
checked Faruk`s travel document. In any case, there was no evidence that the
appellant had re-checked Faruk`s passport after the expiry of the 14-day pass.  
  
Although the appellant claimed to have checked Ansar`s passport and work
permit and obtained photocopies of the same, the judge was not persuaded that
the steps taken in relation to Ansar constituted due diligence on the
appellant`s part. First, there was no indication in the passport that Ansar
had entered Singapore legally. Secondly, the signature at page 3 of it did not
tally with Ansar`s signature in his tenancy agreement. Further, the evidence
did not indicate that the appellant had ascertained that Ansar had entered and
remained in Singapore legally.  
  
The judge went further and held that the appellant knew or had reasonable
grounds to believe that Faruk and Ansar were illegal immigrants. Even if Faruk
and Ansar had sub-let the premises to the five illegal immigrants without the
knowledge of the appellant, the appellant should not be absolved from liablity
for harbouring the sub-tenants of the premises. The judge derived support for
his conclusion in this regard from the decision of the Chief Justice in **Lim
Dee Chew v PP** [1997] 3 SLR 956  (`**_Lim Dee Chew_** `). It was stated in
that case that:

> _[W]here the owner rented his premises to an illegal immigrant who in turn
> rented out rooms in the premises without informing the owner ... it must
> surely follow that the owner should be held to be the harbourer of all of
> them. The owner would not be allowed to hide behind his initial illegal act
> to avoid liability for all the other illegal immigrants, regardless of his
> lack of knowledge or consent. Only if he had initially rented the premises
> to a person who was in Singapore legally, would he not be liable under the
> Act if the lawful tenant in turn rented the premises to illegal immigrants
> without his knowledge or consent._

  
  
On the basis of the above passage, the judge held that the appellant was
vicariously liable for harbouring the five illegal immigrants.  
  
**_Impeachment of the appellant`s credit_**

****

In the course of the trial, the judge allowed the prosecution`s application to
impeach the appellant`s credit on the basis of four inconsistencies which the
judge regarded as material. In substance, the inconsistencies were as follows:

(a) In his statement to the police (exh P-10), the appellant admitted that he
had never checked Faruk`s documents as Faruk had been introduced to him by a
housing agent. In court, the appellant maintained that he had inspected
Faruk`s passport.

(b) In P-10, the appellant stated that he had only checked a photocopy of
Ansar`s passport. However, the appellant stated in court that he had checked
the originals of both Ansar`s work permit and passport.

(c) In court, the appellant revealed in cross-examination that he did not know
that Faruk was sharing the premises with other persons. He also said that when
Faruk was the tenant, only Faruk and Sony would be staying at the premises.
The appellant also stated that only Ansar and his two uncles would be staying
at the premises when Ansar took over Faruk`s tenancy. This contradicted the
following extract of the appellant`s statement in P-10 wherein he said:

> _
>
> Sometime [in] late January 98, [Faruk] spoke to me to enquire whether I have
> a flat to let. [Faruk] used to rent my wife`s flat at Tiong Poh road
> together with some other Bangladeshi nationals and the neighbours complained
> to the URA that they were dirty and cooking was smelly ... I asked Faruk how
> many people will be staying at No 200 Jalan Sultan [num ]15-06 and he said
> that only seven to eight Bangladeshi nationals will be staying together with
> him there.
>
> _

(d) In P-10, the appellant stated that he had met Ansar when the latter
accompanied Faruk on the first day of Faruk`s tenancy. In court, the appellant
alleged that he only met Ansar for the first time in mid-September 1998.  
  
The judge did not accept the appellant`s explanations for the above
inconsistencies. Accordingly, he ruled that the appellant`s credit had been
impeached.  
  
**_Alibi witnesses_**

****

A number of the appellant`s relatives gave evidence in support of the
appellant`s alibi that he was at a birthday party on 5 September 1998.
According to the prosecution witnesses, the appellant was at the premises on
the same day to collect the monthly rental from them.  
  
The judge was not persuaded by this defence. First, all the alibi witnesses
were related to the appellant. Secondly, the judge doubted their ability to
recall some ten months after the event the fact that the appellant had left
the party after 11pm. In any case, he did not think that the appellant`s
presence at the premises on 5 September 1998 was a crucial fact as the
prosecution witnesses had recognised him as the person to whom they paid the
rent. Further, it was possible that the prosecution witnesses had genuinely
made a mistake about the appellant having visited the premises on 5 September
1998. In addition, he did not rule out the possibility that the appellant
might have visited the premises after the party on 5 September 1998.  
  
**_Adverse inference_**

****

The judge also refused to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution
for not calling Ansar as a witness. Ansar had been repatriated to Bangladesh
on 14 October 1998 by the Immigration Department. There was no evidence of a
sinister motive on the part of the prosecution.  
  
For the above reasons, the judge convicted the appellant on all five charges.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

The appellant has appealed against the decision of the judge on the following
grounds:

(a) the judge erred in law when he misinterpreted the word `harbour` in the
context of the Immigration Act;

(b) he erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the acts
of Faruk or Ansar;

(c) he erred in finding that the defence of due diligence was not established;

(d) he erred in concluding that the appellant`s credit had been impeached on
the basis of inconsistencies that were minor;

(e) he erred in finding that the appellant had been properly identified when
the circumstances indicated that he was wrongly and unfairly identified;

(f) he erred in rejecting the alibi defence;

(g) he erred in failing to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution
for not calling Ansar as a witness.  
  
**_The meaning of `harbour`_**

****

The appellant argued that `harbour` in the context of the Immigration Act
meant the giving of secret refuge to an immigration offender and did not
encompass the wider meaning of giving accommodation or providing a roof to
immigration offenders, as contended by the respondent. Accordingly, the
appellant stated that the leasing of premises to immigration offenders did not
constitute `harbouring` under the said Act.  
  
Section 2 of the Immigration Act defines `harbour` as `to give food or
shelter, and includes the act of assisting a person in any way to evade
apprehension`. The meaning of `shelter` in the context of the Immigration Act
has been defined as `providing some form of habitation` (see **Lee Boon Leong
Joseph v PP** [1997] 1 SLR 445 ).  
  
In my opinion, the leasing of premises to immigration offenders constitutes
the provision of shelter or habitation to such persons. The act of leasing is
beyond doubt a positive act of providing shelter on the part of the landlord.
Furthermore, the appellant had sufficient control over the rent (see **_Lim
Dee Chew_** at [para ] 34). The evidence showed that he dictated the amount of
rent payable and collected rent from the five illegal immigrants named in the
charges. Accordingly, there was no doubt that the appellant was the
`harbourer` of the five illegal immigrants.  
  
In any case, there is no support for the restricted definition of `harbour`
advanced by the appellant. The appellant argued that the definition of
`harbour` is confined to the giving of secret refuge to an immigration
offender. Support for this position was derived from some English decisions
which examined the type of conduct that would constitute the harbouring of
prison escapees. In this specific context, Goff LJ in **Darch v Weight**
[1984] 2 All ER 245 stated that there has to be a provision of shelter in the
sense of `**_providing a refuge for an escapee_** ` before there can be a
conviction for the offence of knowingly harbouring a prison escapee under s
22(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1961 [UK]. In my view, the appellant`s
reliance on this case was unfounded. First, Goff LJ was referring to a
specific provision of British legislation which dealt with the problem of
prison escapees being sheltered and protected from the authorities by members
of the public. That offence is rather different from, and in my view more
severe than, harbouring illegal immigrants in the context of s 57(1)(d) of the
Immigration Act. Secondly, the restricted definition of `harbour` advanced by
Goff LJ was justified in the circumstances because s 22(2) of the Criminal
Justice Act specifically targets any person who `**_knowingly harbours_** ` a
prison escapee. The presence of the term `**_knowingly_** ` in s 22(2) (and
its absence in s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act) called for a definition of
`harbour` that included an intent to protect or afford clandestine refuge to
prison escapees.  
  
Accordingly, it was my opinion that the meaning of `harbour` that was advanced
by the respondent and applied by the judge was correct.  
  
**_Vicarious liability under Lim Dee Chew v PP_**

****

The appellants submitted that the judge erred when he concluded that, where an
accused person knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that his tenants were
illegal immigrants, he could not be relieved of liability for harbouring the
sub-tenants who were also illegal immigrants The appellants stated that the
judge did not pay sufficient attention to an earlier passage in **_Lim Dee
Chew_** where it was stated that:

> _The person who provides the shelter or food (`the harbourer`) may not
> necessarily be the owner of the premises. In many cases the owner of the
> premises may rent out the premises to a tenant who in turn may rent it to a
> sub-tenant. If the sub-tenant turns out to be an illegal immigrant, it
> cannot be that in all cases the owner of the premises will be held as the
> person who harboured the illegal immigrant. In my opinion this would depend
> on the facts of each particular case and the agreement which the owner of
> the premises had with the tenant._

  
  
The appellant submitted that the judge did not adequately consider the facts
of the present case. Further, the appellant cast doubt on the passage referred
to by the judge in **_Lim Dee Chew_** where it was suggested that criminal
liability for harbouring sub-tenants could be pinned on a landlord or owner of
property where the tenants were illegal immigrants even if the landlord or
owner was not aware of the presence of the sub-tenants. For ease of reference,
I will set out the passage again:

> _[W]here the owner rented his premises to an illegal immigrant who in turn
> rented out rooms in the premises without informing the owner ... it must
> surely follow that the owner should be held to be the harbourer of all of
> them. The owner would not be allowed to hide behind his initial illegal act
> to avoid liability for all the other illegal immigrants, regardless of his
> lack of knowledge or consent. Only if he had initially rented the premises
> to a person who was in Singapore legally, would he not be liable under the
> Act if the lawful tenant in turn rented the premises to illegal immigrants
> without his knowledge or consent._

  
  
The appellants stated that such an approach was unfair as the offences with
which the appellant was charged were offences with a clear mens rea element.
Mens rea is presumed to be a necessary ingredient of an offence in the absence
of clear words to the contrary (see **PP v Bridges Christopher** [1998] 1 SLR
162 ). Accordingly, the imposition of criminal liability in the vicarious
manner contemplated by **_Lim Dee Chew_** was inconsistent with this maxim of
criminal law.  
  
It was my view that the judge did consider the facts of this particular case.
He concluded that the appellant was guilty of harbouring the five illegal
immigrants named in the charges. He rejected the appellant`s defence that he
had never seen those five persons before. This defence was rightly rejected as
the five illegal immigrants had no difficulty identifying the appellant in an
identification parade and in court. Further, they gave a consistent
description of the appellant in their evidence. There was also no reason for
the five illegal immigrants to give evidence that would be detrimental to the
appellant since they had been convicted by the time the appellant`s trial
began. As stated earlier, there was no doubt that the actus reus of harbouring
had been committed by the appellant.  
  
It was regrettable that the judge did not clearly address the issue of the
mens rea of the appellant. He seemed to have assumed that it was sufficient
that the appellant did not take any steps to check if the five persons named
in the charge were legal entrants. It must be noted that the appellant is
presumed to have **_knowingly_** harboured the five illegal immigrants named
in the charges pursuant to s 57(7) of the Immigration Act which provides:

> _Where, in any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1)(d), it is
> proved that the defendant has given shelter to any person who has remained
> in Singapore unlawfully for a period exceeding 90 days after expiration of
> any pass issued to him or**who has entered Singapore in contravention of
> s5(1) or 6(1), it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the
> defendant has harboured him knowing him to be a person who has acted in
> contravention of the provisions of this Act or the regulations**. [Emphasis
> mine.]_

  
  
Accordingly, the judge should have asked himself if the evidence adduced by
the appellant was sufficient to rebut the presumption of mens rea in s 57(7).  
  
The case of **PP v Koo Pui Fong** [1996] 2 SLR 266  (`**_Koo Pui Fong_** `)
provides some guidance as to what constitutes the requisite mens rea in the
context of s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act which deals with the offence of
employing illegal immigrants. I am of the view that the observations in **_Koo
Pui Fong_** are equally relevant to the offence of harbouring illegal
immigrants under s 57(1)(d). It was stated in **_Koo Pui Fong_** that:

> _it is wholly in keeping with common sense and the law to say that an
> accused knew of certain facts if he deliberately closed his eyes to the
> circumstances, his wilful blindness being evidence from which knowledge may
> be inferred._

  
  
In my opinion, the presumption of mens rea in s 57(7) cannot be rebutted in
this case. The evidence points to the conclusion that the appellant
deliberately closed his eyes to circumstances which suggested that the five
persons named in the charge were illegal immigrants. First, the appellant knew
that the five persons were Bangladeshi nationals. He had seen them on more
than one occasion and collected rent from them regularly. Secondly, Baskar
Khan, Md Kalum and Miras gave evidence that the premises were occupied by 30
to 35 Bangladeshi nationals during their stay there and that there were about
25 mattresses scattered around the premises. In such circumstances, the
appellant must have been suspicious as to the immigration status of these
Bangladeshi nationals. Although he had more than one opportunity to check if
they had valid passes or permits, the evidence did not indicate that the
appellant took any steps to verify if the persons occupying his premises were
legal entrants. Accordingly, it was my view that the appellant
`**_deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry
because he suspected the truth but did not want to have his suspicion
confirmed_** ` (see **Westminster City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd** [1986] 83
Cr App R 155 at 164). Accordingly, I was of the view that the appellant had
the necessary mens rea for the offence under s 57(1)(d) read with s 57(7) of
the Immigration Act.  
  
Nevertheless, the judge went on to find that even **_if the appellant was
ignorant of the presence of the five illegal immigrants at his premises_** he
would not be allowed to hide behind his initial illegal act (in harbouring the
illegal tenants, Faruk and Ansar) to avoid liability for all the other illegal
immigrant sub-tenants on the basis of **_Lim Dee Chew_**. It was clear that
the judge considered the appellant`s vicarious criminal liability in this
regard to be an alternative basis to found a conviction.  
  
I would clarify the theory of vicarious criminal liability that was briefly
touched upon in **_Lim Dee Chew_**. At first glance, the approach does appear
to accord with the policy of ensuring that immigrants who enter Singapore
illegally do not procure accommodation easily. It also deters property owners
and landlords from adopting a lackadaisical attitude towards activities on
their premises.  
  
Having reconsidered the matter and with the benefit of detailed written
submissions from both parties in this case, I do not think that it is
acceptable to find an owner guilty of the crime of harbouring illegal
immigrant **_sub-tenants_** when that owner was **_completely unaware_** of
their presence. The fact that the owner may have been guilty of harbouring
illegal immigrant **_tenants_** is a fact that relates to a separate and
independent crime altogether. The imposition of criminal liability vicariously
in the manner contemplated by the dictum in **_Lim Dee Chew_** would unfairly
circumvent the mens rea requirement with respect to the illegal sub-tenants.
As stated earlier, it is a fundamental tenet of criminal law that the mens rea
is presumed to be a necessary ingredient of an offence in the absence of clear
words to the contrary. I do recognise that an increasing number of statutory
offences of strict liability have been created for the purposes of promoting
greater vigilance where an important social issue is involved. This trend is
not confined to Singapore but can be discerned throughout the common law
world. Nevertheless, the statutory offences set out in the Immigration Act are
not expressly stated to be offences of strict liability. The presumptions in s
57 of the Immigration Act that allow the guilt of the accused to be presumed
from certain facts simply facilitate the prosecution in establishing the guilt
of accused persons. It is open to the accused to rebut these presumptions by
adducing evidence of his ignorance or innocence. Accordingly, the mens rea
requirement has not been dispensed with in the context of statutory offences
under the Immigration Act. As I stated in **_Koo Pui Fong_** :

> _[the] mens rea remains an essential component of every offence under s
> 57(1), but need not be proved in the specific instances set out in ss 57(6)
> to (8) in which the offender is presumed to have the necessary mens rea._

  
  
If the passage in **_Lim Dee Chew_** on vicarious criminal liability were to
be treated as if it were a legislative provision prescribing a statutory
offence, a landlord or owner may be found guilty of harbouring illegal
immigrants even though he was totally ignorant of their existence. Such an
approach effectively does away with the mens rea requirement. If such a
drastic move is thought to be the best way to deal with the situation where an
illegal immigrant tenant sub-lets the premises to other illegal immigrants
without the knowledge of the landlord or owner, it is my view that
Parliamentary intervention is necessary. In the absence of unambiguous
legislation to that effect, I do not think that the dictum in **_Lim Dee
Chew_** should be regarded as providing for the establishment of a criminal
offence in a manner not contemplated by the Immigration Act.  
  
**_Identification of the appellant_**

****

The appellant submitted that he had been wrongly identified by the five
illegal immigrants. He stated that the identification parade that was formed
operated unfairly against him. According to the appellant, Investigating
Officer Sharon Teo (PW1) did not conduct a proper identification parade. All
she did was to ask the five illegal immigrants to identify the owner of the
premises by presenting Chua and the appellant before them. The appellant
submitted that this casual `face-to-face` approach was not a proper
identification parade. Further, there was no evidence to indicate that the
appellant and Chua were of the same height, age or general appearance.  
  
On the other hand, the respondent stated that there were no material
discrepancies between the identification evidence of the five illegal
immigrants and their descriptions of the appellant when they were asked to
describe him during cross-examination. Baskar Khan said that `Mr Ong` wore a
shirt and pants and a pair of glasses on 5 September 1998 when he came to the
premises. Mohd Kalum said that `Mr Ong` was about 58 years old, wore glasses,
was taller than himself and was of medium build. He also said that `Mr Ong`
wore a white shirt and long pants on 5 September 1998. Zakirul Islam said that
`Mr Ong` was an `aged person` of medium build who wore glasses. He also said
that `Mr Ong` wore a long sleeved shirt and long pants on 5 September 1998.
Miras said that `Mr Ong` wore glasses, a pair of long pants, a shirt and a
sweater on 5 September 1998. Finally, Mostaffa said that on the occasions that
he saw `Mr Ong`, he wore a long sleeved shirt, a tie, pants and glasses. It is
noted that Mostaffa could not recognise the appellant as `Mr Ong` on 6 March
1999 at the police station. The respondent argued that this factor was not
significant as he stated in court that he was sure that the person in the dock
(the appellant) was `Mr Ong`.  
  
According to the respondent, the fact that a formal identification parade was
not carried out to identify the appellant did not vitiate the identification
evidence of these prosecution witnesses because there was no reason to doubt
or impugn their identification evidence. Their evidence in relation to other
issues were consistent. These issues included the number of occupants at the
premises, the number of mattresses in the premises and the place where the key
to the grille of the flat was kept. Further, all of the five illegal
immigrants had been convicted and sentenced for contravening the Immigration
Act by the time of the appellant`s trial. They had no reason to concoct a
story to the detriment of the appellant. Thus, there was no reason to
disbelieve their identification evidence.  
  
Where the reliability of identification evidence is involved, the
**_Turnbull_** guidelines laid down by Lord Widgery in **R v Turnbull** [1977]
QB 224 and adopted by the Court of Appeal in **Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP**
[1998] 3 SLR 465  are instructive. The guidelines are as follows:

(a) the first question that a judge should ask is whether the case against the
accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the
identification evidence;

(b) if so, the second question should be whether the identification evidence
is of good quality, having regard to the circumstances in which the
identification by the witness was made;

(c) where the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should
ask if there is any other evidence that supports the correctness of the
identification. If there is no other supporting evidence of the
identification, the judge should be mindful that a conviction which relies on
such poor identification evidence would be unsafe.  
  
I should add that I was uncomfortable with the fact that a proper
identification parade was not carried out in this case. In particular, I was
disturbed by the fact that the appellant was not lined-up with several other
persons of his age-group and race (see **Chan Sin v PP** [1949] MLJ 106 ). I
understand that the practice in relation to identification parades is to
include at least eight persons, other than the suspect, in the line-up. This
was clearly not done in the present case. Having expressed my concerns, I must
also add that a breach of the procedural requirements in the conduct of an
identification parade does not automatically render the identification
evidence inadmissible. Such deficiencies may affect the weight to be attached
to the identification evidence. However, if there is evidence of bad faith or
a deliberate flouting of procedural requirements, the identification parade
will probably not be upheld (see **Thirumalai Kumar v PP** [1997] 3 SLR 434 ).  
  
In my opinion, the casual `face-to-face` manner in which the identification of
the appellant was carried out was improper. Accordingly, the weight that
should be attached to the identification evidence of the five illegal
immigrants should be minimal. However, this did not render the conviction of
the appellant by the judge unsafe. In my view, the case against the appellant
did not rest entirely on the identification evidence. The evidence of the five
illegal immigrants in court was that a `Mr Ong` who wore glasses, a shirt and
long pants had visited the premises before to collect the rent. They knew him
as the landlord of the premises. Their evidence about the premises was
consistent in other respects. There were other factors that suggested that `Mr
Ong` was the appellant. First, the only other candidate for `Mr Ong` was Chua,
who had purchased the premises jointly with the appellant. There was no
evidence to suggest that any of the five illegal immigrants had seen Chua or
were confused as to the appearances of the two men. Secondly, the name `Mr
Ong` had a clear connection with the appellant. The inference seemed to be
that the `Mr Ong` described by the five illegal immigrants was the appellant.  
  
For the above reasons, I was of the view that the poor quality of the
identification evidence did not render the conviction of the appellant unsafe.  
  
**_Due diligence_**

****

The judge took pains to examine the precautionary steps taken by the appellant
with respect to Faruk and Ansar. He found that the appellant did not exercise
due diligence in this regard, and consequently held that the appellant knew or
had reasonable ground to believe that Faruk and Ansar were illegal immigrants.
On the basis of the dictum in **_Lim Dee Chew_** , the appellant could
therefore not escape criminal liability for harbouring the five illegal
immigrants to whom Faruk and Ansar had sub-let the premises. I have concluded
that the dictum in **_Lim Dee Chew_** should not be followed. Accordingly, I
do not think it is necessary to examine whether the judge was right in his
finding that the appellant did not exercise due diligence in relation to Faruk
and Ansar.  
  
**_Impeachment of the appellant`s credit_**

****

I agreed with the judge that the inconsistencies between the appellant`s
testimony in court and the contents of his statement to the police were such
that they cast considerable doubt on his reliability as a witness.  
  
Although the inconsistencies might appear insignificant when considered
individually, as a whole they suggested that the appellant was trying to paint
a different picture of his attitude towards Faruk and Ansar in court. He tried
to convey the impression that he was unaware of Faruk`s intention to rent out
the premises to other Bangladeshi nationals in court, when his statement to
the police indicated that he knew about Faruk`s sub-letting plans. I also
shared the judge`s doubts as regards the steps taken by the appellant in
checking the particulars of Faruk and Ansar. I was not satisfied that the
appellant was being truthful when he claimed to have checked the relevant
documents of these two persons.  
  
There was no suggestion that the appellant`s statement to the police was
involuntary. Further, the explanations offered by the appellant were highly
unsatisfactory. He simply asserted that he was mistaken when he gave the
statement to the police. In view of the above, I saw no reason to disturb the
judge`s finding that the appellant`s credit had been impeached.  
  
**_Alibi witnesses_**

****

In my opinion, the judge was correct in rejecting the appellant`s alibi
defence. It must be stated that appellate intervention is warranted in limited
circumstances, given the numerous findings of fact made by the judge in
relation to the alibi witnesses. In any case, I saw no reason to depart from
the judge`s conclusion. I agreed with his decision that the appellant`s
presence on 5 September 1998 was not a crucial fact since the five illegal
immigrants all claimed to have seen him on other occasions (ie when they were
first brought to the flat). In any event, it was not impossible that the
appellant may have visited the premises after the alleged birthday party.
Accordingly, the judge`s finding should be upheld.  
  
**_Adverse inference_**

****

I do not propose to deal with this ground in detail. Suffice it to say that I
agreed with the judge that it was not proper to draw an adverse inference
against the prosecution for not calling Ansar. Ansar was unavailable as a
witness as he had been repatriated to Bangladesh. There was nothing to suggest
that the prosecution had an ulterior motive for witholding the evidence of
Ansar.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

In view of the reasons given above, it was my view that the appeal against the
conviction should be dismissed.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
