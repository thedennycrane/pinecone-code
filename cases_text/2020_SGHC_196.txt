[2020] SGHC 196

High Court — Suit No 904 of 2017  
Andrew Ang SJ  
25–29 November, 2 December 2019, 28 July 2020

15 September 2020 Judgment reserved.

Andrew Ang SJ:

Introduction

1 Following the release of my judgment in Tan Wei Leong v Tan Lee Chin and
others [2020] SGHC 124 (the “Judgment”), the plaintiff wrote to the Court to
seek clarification on whether its fourth prayer for declaratory relief had
been granted. The prayer in question was in the following terms:

(4) A declaration that the signatures purporting to be those of the Plaintiff
and the 2nd Defendant upon the document titled “Power of Attorney” dated 1
March 2017 (exhibited at ANNEX A hereto) are forgeries;

2 This was one of four declarations prayed for by the plaintiff, the other
three being for the purpose of and in connection with upholding a Deed of
Family Arrangement between the plaintiff and the defendants.

Discussion

3 In the Judgment, the Court ordered that the Deed of Family Arrangement was
to be set aside and accordingly, at [103], held that the plaintiff’s claim was
dismissed with costs.

4 However, as regards the fourth prayer, the Court had earlier in the Judgment
at [100(c)] concluded that the first defendant had made or procured forgeries
of the signatures of the plaintiff and the second defendant on the Power of
Attorney referred to in the fourth prayer. Inadvertently, [103] of the
Judgment dismissing the plaintiff’s claim omitted to exclude the fourth
prayer.

Orders

5 The first sentence of [103] of the Judgment is therefore corrected to read
as follows:

Save for the plaintiff’s fourth prayer, as to which I grant an order in terms,
the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs.

6 No change is required to be made to my order as to costs as the dishonest
nature of the first defendant's conduct had already been taken into account.
