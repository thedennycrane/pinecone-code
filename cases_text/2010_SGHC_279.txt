Choo Han Teck J:

1 The appellant was a 39-year old single parent of three children, a son aged
15, a daughter aged 14, and another son aged 9. She did not have a regular job
and lived on the charity of friends and some income from freelance work on
which she did not elaborate. She signed a tenancy agreement with the plaintiff
to rent a terrace house at Highland Road on 1 October 2008. Thereafter, she
stayed over paying the monthly rent until February 2009. She was evicted on 13
September 2010 after a notice to quit was served on her on 13 May 2009. The
plaintiff filed a writ of summons against her on 2 September 2009 and obtained
final judgment on 25 February 2010. She applied for an extension of time to
appeal and that application was dismissed on 18 May 2010. She appealed against
that and was granted leave to appeal. The appeal was heard by District Judge
Chew Kwee Hoe Leslie (“DJ Chew”) and dismissed on 28 June 2010.

2 The appellant appealed against the decision of DJ Chew before me. She
repeated her case that she stopped payment only when she was told to pay
directly into the plaintiff’s bank account. She had hitherto paid to the agent
but was eventually told that the agent would charge a $50 administration fee
if the appellant were to pay the rent through it. The appellant refused to pay
in the manner requested by the plaintiff on the ground that she had never met
the plaintiff and could not be sure that the form of payment requested was
proper. She was used to paying to the agent and thus asked rhetorically
whether she “should pay the price of a “ _murtabak_ ” that she ordered if she
was served “ _roti prata_ ” instead?” It was her allusion to the fact that the
practice of paying to the agent cannot be changed. She did not appear to
understand that the agreement was with the plaintiff and payment must be made
to the plaintiff.

3 The courts below were of the view that the appellant had failed to pay rent
and there was nothing on record or in her arguments before me to indicate why
the judgment against her was wrong. The tenancy was terminated by the
plaintiff’s solicitor’s notice to quit dated 13 May 2009 and she must
surrender the premises and pay all arrears of rent. The appeal was therefore
dismissed.
