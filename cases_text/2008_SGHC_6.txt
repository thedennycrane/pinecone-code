Choo Han Teck J:

1 The appellant, Balakrishnan A/L Sannasy, and a co-accused, one Muthurumaran
Ramasamy, pleaded guilty before me on a charge of trafficking in not less than
14.99g of diamorphine. The charge was brought under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2)
of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), 2001 Rev Ed and s 34 of the Penal Code
(Cap 224), 1985 Rev Ed. The offence was committed on 5 December 2006 at or
about 8.45pm in the vicinity of a McDonald’s restaurant located at the East
Coast Park. Both accused pleaded guilty to the charge.

2 From the statement of facts that both accused persons admitted without
qualification, the appellant was caught in an entrapment exercise by the
Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”). He was the one who established contact with
an undercover agent of the CNB to whom he sold and delivered the drugs in
question. At the meeting he handed the drugs to the said undercover agent. The
second accused admitted to be the person who obtained the drugs for the
appellant to sell. It was also noted in the statement of facts that the
appellant owed the second accused money which he had hoped to repay by selling
the drugs. On the evening when the arrests were made, the second accused was
merely “loitering” in the vicinity.

3 In mitigation, counsel for the appellant pleaded that the appellant had an
unhappy domestic life as he had a 14-year-old son who was born with a mental
retardation, and also that he and his wife did not earn enough to provide
money for his family’s medical expenses. He expressed remorse and had no
previous antecedents. I sentenced both accused persons to 24 years’
imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. There was no appeal by the second
accused.

4 The offence was punishable with mandatory caning of not less than 15 strokes
and a term of imprisonment of not less than 20 years and not more than 30
years. The facts of this case were straightforward with nothing exceptionally
harsh nor aggravating. The mitigating factors were similarly not sufficient in
my view to merit the minimum sentence of 20 years. It is true that I might
have ordered a term of slightly less than 24 years, say 22, but I could also
have imposed a slightly longer sentence of say 25 or 26 years. It is difficult
to say which length of time would be the correct one in such a case. I thought
a term of 24 years with effect from 5 December 2006 to be a fair one.
