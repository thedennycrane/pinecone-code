Criminal Procedure

** Application for time before serving sentence of imprisonment Conditions and
circumstances that necessitate or justify an order of further extension of
time before serving sentence **

Facts

**

The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to a total of four charges of traffic
offences. He was sentenced to a total of eight months imprisonment, and a
total of 18 years disqualification for all classes of vehicles. Upon the
dismissal of his appeal against the sentences on 2 August 2001, he applied for
and was granted an order that he commence serving his sentence of imprisonment
on 16 August 2001, so that he could have a period of two weeks to settle his
personal and work affairs.

The applicant now filed this criminal motion for a further order that his
sentence of imprisonment which was to commence on 16 August 2001, be postponed
instead to commence on 30 August 2001, to settle his personal and work
affairs.

**Judgment:**

_

Introduction

_

The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to a total of four charges. They were
for driving whilst under disqualification, an offence under s 43(4) of the
Road Traffic Act (Cap 276), driving whilst not being covered by insurance, an
offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks & Compensation)
Act (Cap 189), failure to wear a seat belt whilst driving, an offence under
Rule 4(1) of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Wearing of Seat Belts) Rules,
and for speeding, an offence under s 63(4) of the Road Traffic Act.

2 He was sentenced on 30 April 2001, to a total of eight months imprisonment,
and a total of 18 years disqualification for all classes of vehicles, a total
fine of $1,000, in default, ten days imprisonment. The appeal against the
sentences of imprisonment and disqualification before this Court was dismissed
on 2 August 2001. Counsel for the applicant, immediately after the dismissal,
sought for an order that the applicant commence serving his sentence of
imprisonment on 16 August 2001, so that the appellant could have a period of
two weeks to settle his personal and work affairs. I granted it and also
ordered that the applicants bail be extended.

3 This Motion, filed on 16 August 2001, and heard on 17 August 2001, was for a
further order that the applicants sentence of imprisonment which was to
commence on 16 August 2001, be postponed instead to commence on 30 August
2001. The applicant cited in his affidavit, that he needed a further two weeks
to settle his personal and work affairs, before serving his sentence.

4 The applicant was seeking, in essence, an alteration of my order of 2 August
2001 that the applicant surrender himself and commence serving his sentence on
16 August 2001. I dismissed the application.

_

Functus Officio

_

5 I shall first deal with the issue of whether I could lawfully substitute my
own order, some two weeks after it had been made. Section 217 of the Criminal
Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides as follows:

> 217\. Judgment not to be altered

> > (1) No court other than the High Court, when it has recorded its judgment,
> shall alter or review the judgment.
>>

>> (2) A clerical error may be rectified at any time and any other mistake may
be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day.

I ruled in _Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor_[1997] 3 SLR 445 at 460, that s
217 did not attempt any substantive enactment with regard to the High Court.
The phrase other than the High Court could be interpreted to suggest that s
217 allowed the High Court to alter or review its judgment. However, to regard
so would mean that the High Court would never be functus officio since, in
theory, there would be nothing to prevent a third judgment or a fourth
judgment to supplement an earlier judgment. This would go against the
universal principle of law that, when a matter has been finally disposed of by
a court, the court is, in the absence of a direct statutory provision, functus
officio and cannot entertain a fresh prayer for the same relief unless and
until the previous order of final disposal has been set aside.

6 This provision, and its equivalent, has spawn different interpretations. The
previous s 369 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India provided as follows:

> No court, other than a High Court, when it has signed its judgment, shall
> alter or review the same, except as provided in ss 395 and 484 or to correct
> a clerical error.

Despite the express exclusion of the High Court from the operation of this
provision, many Indian High Courts held that they had no implied power to
alter or review their own judgment. In _Re Gibbons_ 14 ILR (Cal) 42 at 47,
Petheram CJ stated:

> In my opinion the effect of the words other than a High Court is precisely
> the same as if in place of them the Legislature had at the end of the
> section added these words this section does not apply to the High Court.
> There is no substantive enactment in that section with reference to the High
> Court, and all it does is to reserve the powers which existed in the High
> Court before, so that they are in no degree taken away. What the powers of
> the High Court were before it is unnecessary to consider, but whatever they
> were, they were reserved and they were in the same position after this
> section was passed as they had been in before; and inasmuch as it is not
> shown to us that, before the passing of this section, any power of revision
> existed in the High Court, that section did not, in my opinion, create any
> such power, and therefore, it appears that this section does not help the
> applicant.

7 This was cited with approval by Spenser-Wilkinson J in _Public Prosecutor v
Heng You Nang_[1949] MLJ 285, a criminal appeal from Sessions Court. In this
case, the Public Prosecutor had applied against the acquittal of the
respondent on charges connected with the alleged importation of certain goods
by the respondent. The appeal was dismissed. Subsequently, the Deputy Public
Prosecutor applied by motion that the court should hear further arguments and
review its judgment. Spenser-Wilkinson J referred to s 278 of the Criminal
Procedure Code of Malaysia, that provides as follows:

> No Court, other than a Court of a Judge, having once recorded its judgment,
> shall alter or review the same: provided that a clerical error may be
> rectified at any time, and that any other mistake may be rectified at any
> time before the Court rises for the day.

and stated that

> [the case of _Re Gibbons_] lays down the correct principle that once a
> judgment in a criminal matter has been pronounced and signed it cannot be
> altered.

This was significant, as Spenser-Wilkinson J, I think quite rightly, decided
not to follow the judgment of McElwaine CJ in _Goh Ah San & 2 Ors v The King
_[1938] MLJ 95. Spenser-Wilkinson J said:

> [In] _Goh Ah San & 2 Ors v The King _[1938] MLJ 95, McElwaine CJ having in
> open court dismissed the appeal of one appellant and allowed those of the
> other two subsequently, when he came to give his reasons therefor, allowed
> the appeal of the 1st appellant. The relevant portion of his judgment is as
> follows:
>

>> This No 1 accused was not represented on the appeal before me, and when I
dismissed his appeal, and though I had read the record, I did not appreciate
the weakness of the case against him. I have had some doubts whether I am now
**functus officio** , but no certificate of the result of the appeal has yet
been prepared. I stated I would give my reasons for my decision, and now,
having come to a conclusion favourable to the accused person I think I am
justified in applying the principle in **Jones v Williams** 41 JP 614
(referred to in **Rex v Manchester Justices- Ex parte Leaver** 53 TLR 687) and
in regarding myself as not **functus officio**. I therefore allow the appeal
of No 1 accused.

>
> It is to be observed that part of the learned Chief Justices decision was
> reached without hearing any argument upon the point and there is a
> possibility that this decision might not have been the same had his power to
> act as he did been seriously contested.

8 _Re Gibbons_ and _Public Prosecutor v Heng You Nang_ were cited with
approval, by the Supreme Court of Malaysia in _Ooi Sim Yim v Public
Prosecutor_[1990] 1 MLJ 88. Here, the appellant had pleaded guilty to two
charges, for possession of a firearm and ammunition. The trial judge sentenced
the appellant to ten years imprisonment and six strokes of whipping on the
first charge and another three years on the second charge and ordered that
both terms of imprisonment are to run consecutively from and be backdated to
the date of his arrest. About two and a half months after the disposal of the
case, the trial judge issued a corrigenda to substitute the original order
with a new one which had the effect of making both sentences run
consecutively, i.e. the appellant was to serve a total of 13 years
imprisonment to take effect from the date of his arrest. The appellant
appealed against the order, contending that the two sentences should run
concurrently. Mohamed Azmi SCJ ruled that s 278 of the Criminal Procedure Code
of Malaysia did not empower the trial judge to substitute his judgment two and
a half months after it was recorded and delivered. As the judgment he gave was
equivocal and capable of two interpretations, the basic principle of criminal
justice should apply in that the construction more favourable to the appellant
should be adopted rather than the substituted order subsequently made by the
trial judge.

9 However in _Wong Hong Toy_ & _Anor v Public Prosecutor_[1994] 2 SLR 396 at
408E, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the learned Wee Chong Jin CJ
disagreed with these authorities and instead, said:

> A plain reading of [s 217] shows that the High Court can alter or review its
> judgment. There is no reason to compel a restrictive interpretation,
> especially since we are concerned with a superior court of record, which is
> also the highest court of trial in criminal cases. We must give effect to
> the plain meaning of the words in the section. To ignore the words other
> than the High Court would be to render them otiose. In our opinion, [s 217]
> gives sanction to Lai Kew Chai J to alter the fine. It was necessary for him
> to do so to correct a mistake as to the maximum fine that could be imposed.

10 In _Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor_[1997] 3 SLR 445 at 460, I agreed
with the approach taken by Petheram CJ in _Re Gibbons_ and Spenser-Wilkinson J
in _Public Prosecutor v Heng You Nang_ and Mohamed Azmi SCJ in _Ooi Sim Yim v
Public Prosecutor_. With respect and great deference, I departed from Wee
Chong Jin CJs reasoning in _Wong Hong Toy._

11 I took the opportunity in _Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor_ to say at 68:

> ..upon a true construction of s 217, I did not think that it attempted any
> substantive enactment with regard to the High Court.

and at 69:

> .. In my view, the entire [s 217] might be read as if it did not apply to
> the High Court.

However, as I also said at 76 and 77:

> .. the powers conferred on the lower courts by s 217 must, by implication,
> also be available to the High Court in its appellate capacity Consequently,
> [the High Court has] the requisite power in altering the sentence of the
> appellant in the instance case, even though it was a substantive mistake,
> because it had not arisen for the day when the rectification was made. On
> this approach, it was also apparent that Lai Kew Chai J had the necessary
> powers to reduce the fine in the case of _Wong Hong Toy_ since the mistake
> there was rectified before the court rose for the day.

12 I made the order of 2 August 2001, allowing the applicant a period of two
weeks to settle his personal and work affairs, and commence serving his
sentence on 16 August 2001. To accede to this application would, in essence,
entail altering my own order of 2 August 2001. With my approach to s 217, as
can be seen from the reasoning in _Chiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor_ , once
the order is regarded as a judgment, I could not lawfully substitute my own
order, some two weeks after it had been made. It is thus necessary that I go
on to consider if my order of 2 August 2001, allowing the applicant a period
of two weeks to settle his personal and work affairs, comes within the
definition of judgment.

_

Judgment

_

13 The word judgment is not defined in the Criminal Procedure Code. The
Halsburys Laws of England, Hailsham Ed, Vol IX, paras 260-265 explains it as a
final order in a trial terminating in the conviction or acquittal of the
accused. In _Chhotey Lal v Tinkey Lal_(1935) AIR 815, the court regarded that
an order in the nature of a judgment is one which is passed on full enquiry
and after hearing both parties.

14 In _Re Balasundara Pavalar_(1951) AIR Mad 7, an order on a bail application
was regarded as nothing more than an interlocutory and tentative expression of
the conclusion as to whether a person should be set at large pending trial, or
disposal of his appeal and cannot be termed a judgment so as to attract the
application of s 369 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India. Menon J
stated that [(1951) AIR Mad 7 at 12]:

> A judgment is one which finally acquits or convicts an accused person and
> any other order passed by an appellate court disposing of the appeal would
> include an order of remand or retrial. But it cannot be said that an order
> passed by an appellate court would include an interlocutory rejection of an
> application for bail.

15 Thus, by using the proper approach of analogy from decided cases from other
appropriate jurisdiction, an application to ask the court to exercise its
discretion, that the applicant defer serving his sentence, ought not to be
treated as a judgment. Such an order cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be
regarded as a final order in a trial terminating in the conviction or
acquittal of an accused. The High Court, as an appellate court, has the power
to review its own such previous order.

16 However, this still leaves the issue of when and in what circumstances the
High Court would consider a further extension of time before serving the
sentence. It would be impossible to lay down a clear-cut guideline. It is
possible that during the period of extension, the applicant may suffer from
illness which necessitates treatment in hospitals or other places where better
facilities are available. It might be that a further extension would be
justifiable as the applicants close relative or a member of immediate family
happened to suffer from serious illness. Different conditions and
circumstances could arise that would necessitate or justify an order of
further extension of time before serving the sentence. Ultimately, the court
would be guided by whether the interests of justice require that discretion be
exercised to allow the applicant a further period of time before he serves his
sentence. At the same time, the court must take a robust approach and ensure
that the discretion not be abused by frivolous requests from the applicant.
The burden is always on the applicant to show and explain that the
circumstances and conditions are of such a dire and serious nature or of such
urgency that they merit the exercise of discretion by the court to grant a
further period of time before he serves his sentence.

17 Thus, I concluded that the application for a further period of time before
serving the sentence of imprisonment is not a judgment. Therefore, there is
nothing in law to prevent the court which passed it from re-considering it or
from entertaining a fresh application for the same relief. However, in the
circumstances, there was nothing in the applicants affidavit that showed a
valid reason for the court to exercise its discretion the second time to allow
him a further period of time, before serving his sentence. I thus dismissed
the motion.

_

Conclusion

_

18 Section 217(1) lays down a general prohibition against alteration of
judgments by the Subordinate Courts. Section 217(2) is an exception to this
general prohibition, by prescribing the limited circumstances, in which the
Subordinate Courts could alter or review their judgments. Rectifications by
Subordinate Courts under s 217, could go beyond mere accidental slips and
omissions, the only restriction being that it must be corrected before the
court rises for the day, i.e. before the working day of the court ends. And as
the powers conferred on the lower courts by s 217 must by implication also be
available to the High Court in its appellate capacity, the High Court has such
power to rectify the judgment, again, provided that it has not arisen for the
day.

19 I had decided on 2 August 2001 to grant an order that the commencement of
the applicants sentence begin on 16 August 2001. And faced with the present
application on 17 August 2001, although I was not functus officio, and not
deprived of the power to accede to the application and alter my own decision
of 2 August 2001, the applicant failed to come up with any valid excuse for
the court to exercise its discretion the second time to allow him a further
period of time, before serving his sentence.

_

Criminal Motion dismissed.
