**Judgment:**

_Cur Adv Vult_

**The facts**

1\. The relevant facts giving rise to the appeal now before us are as follows.
The appellant, Mr Harris Hakim ('Mr Hakim') entered into a sale and purchase
agreement dated 14 May 1996 ('the Agreement') with the respondents, Allgreen
Properties Ltd ('Allgreen'), whereby Mr Hakim agreed to purchase from Allgreen
an apartment in a private housing development called 'Springdale Condominium'
which was then being developed by Allgreen. The Agreement was in the form
prescribed as Form E by the Housing Developers Rules (1990 ed) and
incorporated within it the Singapore Law Society's Conditions of Sale 1994, in
so far as those conditions were applicable to the sale and were not varied by
or were not inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement.

2\. The purchase price for the apartment was $1,165,000, which was to be paid
by instalments at different stages of the construction as provided in cl 3 of
the Agreement. It was provided by cl 5(1) of the Agreement that, in the event
that Mr Hakim defaulted in payment of any instalment for more than 14 days,
Allgreen would be entitled to charge interest at the specified rate as
provided in cl 5(2). By cl 5(3), the Agreement further provided that if Mr
Hakim should default in payment of any instalment for more than 14 days,
Allgreen would be entitled, at their option on giving not less than 21 days'
notice to Mr Hakim, to treat the Agreement as having been repudiated and,
unless in the meanwhile the unpaid instalments and interest were paid up, upon
the expiration of the 21 days, the Agreement would be annulled, and in such
event, without prejudice to any other rights available to Allgreen at law or
in equity, Allgreen would be entitled to certain rights as provided in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). We shall refer to the terms of this
clause in detail in a moment.

3\. About two years later, Mr Hakim ran into financial difficulties, and found
it difficult to keep up with the instalment payments. By that time, the total
amount of instalments Mr Hakim had paid to Allgreen under the Agreement
amounted to $669,000. By a letter dated 28 July 1998, written by his
solicitors to Allgreen, he requested the latter to serve him a notice under
clause 5 of the Agreement and thereafter to exercise their rights under cl
5(3): forfeit the sum of $233,000, which is 20% of the purchase price of
$1,165,000, deduct it from the sum of $699,000, being the total of the
instalments previously paid, and refund the balance thereof to him. Allgreen,
however, refused to accede to this request.

4\. Mr Hakim continued to default in the payment of further instalments.
Finally, on 19 August 1999, Allgreen decided to invoke cl 5(3) of the
Agreement. Allgreen's solicitors sent a notice to Mr Hakim pursuant to cl 5(3)
which, so far as relevant, read as follows:

> We refer to the above matter and note that the progress payments under
> clauses 3(1)(h) and 3(3)(a) of the Sale and Purchase Agreement were due on 5
> November 1998 and 30 April 1999 respectively.
>
> In view of the above, we are instructed by our clients to and do hereby give
> to your client(s) notice pursuant to clause 5(3) of the Sale and Purchase
> Agreement that unless your client(s) pay the unpaid instalment(s) and
> interest _within twenty-one (21) days from the date hereof_ , the said Sale
> and Purchase Agreement shall at the expiration of the said twenty-one (21)
> days be annulled and our clients shall, without prejudice to any other
> rights available to them at law or in equity proceed in accordance with
> clause 5(3) of the said Sale and Purchase Agreement.

5\. As might have been expected, Mr Hakim was unable to comply with the
notice. On 6 December 1999, Allgreen's solicitors sent Mr Hakim a further
letter referring to the previous notice and stating, among other things, the
following:

> 3 In accordance with Condition 29 of the Singapore Law Society's Conditions
> of Sale 1994, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to
> our clients at law or equity, the deposit paid by your client has been
> forfeited and retained for our client's own benefit.

It is common ground that the reference in the letter to 'Condition 29 of the
Singapore Law Society's Conditions of Sale 1994' was an error and that the
correct reference intended was 'clause 5(3)(c) of the Agreement'. Nothing
however turns on this error.

6\. Mr Hakim's apartment was subsequently resold by Allgreen. By a letter
dated 23 March 2000, Allgreen's solicitors informed Mr Hakim that out of the
total amount of the instalments paid up by him, Allgreen would be refunding
him the sum of $399,259.87, and provided the following computation showing how
the sum of $399,259.87 was arrived at:

> 1. | Original Sale Price | $1,165,000.00 |   
> ---|---|---|---  
> 2. | New Sale Price | $ 900,000.00 |   
> 3. | Shortfall | $ 265,000.00 |   
> _Add_ | Outstanding Interest | $ 20,896.30 |   
> | Legal Fees | $ 350.20 |   
> | Outstanding Maintenance Charges | $ 2,532.54 |   
> | Agent's Commission | $ 9,000.00 |   
> | Outstanding Property Tax | $ 1,652.09 |   
> | Auction/Valuation Charges | $ 309.00  | $299,740.13  
> 4. | Off-set amount paid by original purchaser to date (60%) |  | _$699,000.00_  
> | Refund Amount |  | $399,259.87  
  
7\. Mr Hakim disputed this computation. While he accepted that Allgreen were
entitled to claim for the outstanding interest, maintenance charges and
property tax, these being accrued debts due to Allgreen, and to claim the sum
of $223,000 being the 20% of the purchase price that was forfeited under cl
5(3) of the Agreement, he disputed that Allgreen were entitled to claim for
legal fees, the agent's commission incurred during the sale, the
auction/valuation charges, as well as the shortfall arising from the resale.
His computation of the refundable amount was as follows:

> Total payment by Mr Hakim | $699,000.00  
> ---|---  
> Less 20% pursuant to clause 5(3)(c) | $233,000.00  
> Outstanding interest | $20,896.30  
> Outstanding maintenance charges | $2,532.54  
> Outstanding property tax | $1,652.09  
> Amount to be refunded: | _$440,919.07_  
  
8\. Allgreen were unwilling to refund $440,919.07 as requested by Mr Hakim.
They refunded only $399,259.87, which was accepted Mr Hakim without prejudice
to his right to claim the balance. Mr Hakim therefore commenced proceedings in
Originating Summons No 896 of 2000 ('the present action'), seeking a
determination by the Court as to the amount to be refunded by Allgreen to him,
and claimed the balance sum of $41,659.20.

**Decision below**

9\. At the hearing below, Mr Pereira, counsel for Mr Hakim submitted that by
virtue of the words: 'without prejudice to any other rights available to
[Allgreen] at law or in equity', upon the termination of the contract under cl
5(3), Allgreen were entitled to elect either of the two courses:

(i) to re-sell the property and pursue a claim against Mr Hakim for
unliquidated damages at common law, or

> (ii) to proceed under cl 5(3) by, _inter alia_ , forfeiting 20% of the
> purchase price.

In support of this construction of cl 5(3), counsel relied on three cases
decided in England: _Tally and Anor v Wolsey-Neech_(1979) 38 P&CR 164;
_Wallace-Turner v Cole_ (1983) 46 P&CR 164 and _Sakkas and Anor v Donford Ltd_
(1983) 46 P&CR 290. We shall turn to these cases shortly. Reverting to the
instant case, Mr Pereira submitted that, as Allgreen had elected to exercise
their rights under cl 5(3), they would be entitled only to such compensation
as cl 5(3)(b) and (c) allowed, and were not entitled to recover, in addition,
any damages at common law. Any loss arising from the re-sale above and beyond
the forfeited sum and the interest under cl 5(3)(b) and (c) was irrecoverable.

10\. On the other hand, Mr Peter, counsel for Allgreen submitted that the
right to invoke cl 5(3) and forfeit 20% of the purchase price was exercisable,
in the words of cl 5(3), 'without prejudice to any other rights available to
[Allgreen] at law or in equity'. It was thus submitted that in the instant
case the 20% forfeited was insufficient to cover Allgreen's losses arising
from the resale, and therefore on the basis of those words in cl 5(3) they
were entitled to recover from Mr Hakim the amount of loss they had sustained
over and above the 20%.

11\. Allgreen's contention was accepted by the judge. He held at 9 as follows:

> 9 On the face of it, cl 5(3) gave Allgreen Properties the right to forfeit
> the 20% as well as pursue other rights they may have against HH [Mr Hakim]
> for the breach of contract. And, in the absence of any restrictive words in
> cl 5(3), these other rights must include Allgreen Properties' right to
> damages (by way of expenses in the re-sale and any drop in the sale price)
> should those damages exceed the 20% forfeited by Allgreen Properties under
> cl 5(3).

The judge rejected the three cases relied upon by Mr Pereira on the ground
that 'the context and content of the conditions' in those cases were
materially different from the provisions of cl 5(3), and the courts in those
cases held that those conditions provided for liquidated damages, and that the
parties, having pre-agreed on the quantum of damages, were precluded from
claiming additional amounts as damages. Turning to cl 5(3) the judge said:

> 11 Clause 5(3) in our present Agreement does not appear to be a clause
> setting out the liquidated damages payable on breach. Whilst cl 5(3)
> entitled Allgreen Properties to forfeit 20% of the purchase price, it does
> not say, nor can it readily be inferred from the context, that this 20% is
> to be treated as liquidated damages. Indeed, cl 5(3) leaves the question of
> damages for breach open because the right to forfeit the 20% is prefaced by
> the words "without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or
> in equity". These words appear to have the effect of preserving the right of
> Allgreen Properties to recover damages or seek other remedies at common law
> or in equity should Allgreen Properties suffer damages in excess of the 20%.
> The effect of the words "without prejudice to any other rights available to
> him at law or in equity" in cl 5(3) appears to me to be that should the
> damages suffered by Allgreen Properties be less than 20%, Allgreen
> Properties are entitled to all of that 20% but should the damages exceed
> 20%, Allgreen Properties are entitled to the additional damages.

12\. In the result, the judge found that Allgreen were entitled to make the
deductions as they did and he dismissed Mr Hakim's claim. Mr Hakim now appeals
against this decision.

**The appeal**

13\. The issue before us is one of construction of cl 5(3) of the Agreement
and in particular the words 'without prejudice to the other rights available
to [the vendor] at law or in equity'. It is convenient at this stage to set
out in full cl 5(3) and also cl 5(4) of the Agreement, which are as follows:

> (3) If any such unpaid instalments and interest remain unpaid for any period
> in excess of fourteen (14) days after its due date, the Vendor shall be
> entitled at its option on giving to the Purchaser or his solicitors not less
> than twenty-one (21) days' notice in writing to treat this Agreement as
> having been repudiated by the Purchaser and (unless in the meanwhile the
> unpaid instalments and interest shall have been paid) this Agreement shall
> at the expiration of such notice (and in this respect time shall be of the
> essence) be annulled and in such an event, without prejudice to any other
> rights available to him at law or in equity, the Vendor shall be entitled:-
>

>> (a) to resell or otherwise dispose of the building unit as the Vendor shall
see fit as if this Agreement had not been entered into;

>>

>> (b) to recover from the instalments (excluding payments for interest)
previously paid by the Purchaser all interest calculated in accordance with
paragraph (1) of this clause owing and unpaid; and

>>

>> (c) to forfeit and retain for his own benefit a sum equal to twenty (20)
per cent of the purchase price from the instalments (excluding payment for
interest) previously paid by the Purchaser.

>
> (4) The balance of the instalments prepaid by the Purchaser after making
> deductions in accordance with paragraph (3)(b) and (c) shall be refunded to
> the Purchaser.

**Historical perspective**

14\. The Agreement was in a statutory form, namely Form E prescribed by the
Housing Developers Rules (1990 ed) for the sale by a developer of a flat or
any housing accommodation in a condominium project. All the relevant forms of
sale and purchase agreements for sale of housing units by developers have been
prescribed by law since the amendments made in 1967 to the Housing Developers
Rules 1965. Such forms have been amended from time to time by the legislature,
and it would be helpful for our purpose to examine the relevant amendments
made to the statutory forms which led to the evolution of the cl 5(3) now
under consideration.

15\. The Housing Developers (Licensing and Control) Act (Cap 130, 1985 ed) was
enacted in 1965 and became law on 1 October 1965. Under s 22 of the Act, the
Minister is empowered to make rules for the purpose of carrying out the
provisions of the Act and in particular for regulating, inter alia, (a) the
payments to be made by a purchaser to a housing developer before and during
the construction of the premises in question, (b) the form of contract to be
made between a housing developer and a purchaser, and (c) the terms and
conditions of such a contract. The first set of rules was the Housing
Developers Rules 1965. At that time, the 1965 Rules did not prescribe any
specific form of agreement between a housing developer and a purchaser, but
Rule 9 contained specific provisions - (a) prescribing the sum of $500 as the
maximum sum as the booking fee to be paid by a purchaser for an option or
right to purchase the property; (b) prescribing a sum equal to 10% of the
purchase price as the maximum to be paid by the purchaser either as a deposit
or the first instalment of the purchaser price; (c) requiring the developer to
submit to the Controller of Housing for approval a proposal regarding the
amounts of instalments payable by the purchaser at various stages of the
construction of the building, and upon such approval, requiring the developer
to adhere to the proposal; and (d) prescribing 90% of the purchase price as
the maximum to be paid by the purchaser, until the issue and delivery of the
certificate of fitness for occupation for the premises.

16\. The statutory forms of agreement between a developer and a purchaser were
introduced for the first time by the Housing Developers (Amendments) Rules
1967. For the sale of flats the form prescribed was then Form B. The agreement
in that form provided, inter alia, payment of the purchase price by
instalments according to the stages of the construction of the premises in
question and payment of interest on any instalment which the purchaser failed
to pay. The forerunner of the present cl 5(3) under consideration was cl 5 of
Form B, which so far as material was as follows:

> 5 . . . . . .If any of such unpaid instalments and interest shall remain
> unpaid for any period in excess of forty days after its due date the Vendor
> shall be entitled at its option on giving to the Purchaser or his solicitors
> not less than thirty days' notice in writing to treat this Agreement as
> having been repudiated by the Purchaser and (unless in the meanwhile such
> unpaid instalment and interest shall have been paid) this Agreement shall at
> the expiration of the said notice (and in this respect time shall be of the
> essence) be annulled and in such an event -
>

>> (a) The Vendor shall be entitled to deal with or otherwise dispose of the
said Flat in such manner as the Vendor shall see fit as if this Agreement has
not been entered into.

>>

>> (b) The instalments previously paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor
excluding any interest paid shall be dealt with and disposed of as follows: -

>>

>>> (i) firstly all interest calculated up to the date of the expiration of
the said notice owing and unpaid shall be paid to the Vendor;

>>>

>>> (ii) secondly a sum equivalent to 25 per cent of the balance thereof shall
be paid and forfeited to the Vendor; and

>>>

>>> (iii) lastly the residue thereof shall be refunded to the Purchaser.

>>

>> (c) Neither party hereto shall have any further claims against the other
for costs, damages, compensation or otherwise hereunder.

>>

>> (d) Each party hereto shall pay its own costs in the matter.

Thus, in the event that this clause was validly invoked, the developer's
rights for any loss he suffered were limited to recovering from the
instalments previously paid (i) all the interest owing and unpaid up to a
certain date, and (ii) thereafter a sum equal to 25% of the balance of the
instalments (previously paid). After the recovery of these sums, the developer
was obliged to refund the residue to the purchaser. The developer was not
entitled to claim damages for any other loss occasioned by the breach of
contract on the part of the purchaser.

17\. The 1965 Rules were repealed by the Housing Developers Rules 1976. The
1976 Rules introduced new forms of sale and purchase agreements. Form B as
prescribed there was the form of sale agreement for the sale of a flat or any
housing accommodation in a condominium project. Clause 1 of the new Form B
incorporated for the first time the conditions of sale by public auction known
as 'The (Revised) Singapore Conditions of Sale' so far as they were applicable
to a sale by private treaty and were not varied by or inconsistent with the
special conditions contained in Form B. In so far as relevant for our purpose,
cl 5(3) of the then Form B was substantially the same as the material parts of
cl 5 of the previous Form B under the 1965 Rules (as amended in 1967), and was
as follows:

> (3) If any of such unpaid instalments and interest remains unpaid for any
> period in excess of forty (40) days after its due date the Vendor shall be
> entitled at its option on giving to the Purchaser or his Solicitors not less
> than thirty (30) days' notice in writing to treat this Agreement as having
> been repudiated by the Purchaser and (unless in the meanwhile such unpaid
> instalment and interest shall have been paid) this Agreement shall at the
> expiration of the said notice (and in this respect time shall be of the
> essence) be annulled and in such an event -
>

>> (a) the Vendor shall be entitled to deal with or otherwise dispose of the
housing unit in such manner as the Vendor shall see fit as if this Agreement
had not been entered into;

>>

>> (b) the instalments previously paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor
excluding any interest paid shall be dealt with and disposed of as follows:-

>>

>>> (i) firstly, all interests calculated in accordance with paragraph (1)
hereof owing and unpaid shall be paid to the Vendor;

>>>

>>> (ii) secondly, a sum equal to twenty-five (25) per cent of the balance
thereof shall be paid and forfeited to the Vendor; and

>>>

>>> (iii) lastly the residue thereof shall be refunded to the Purchaser;

>>

>> (c) neither party hereto shall have any further claims against the other
for costs, damages, compensation or otherwise hereunder; and

>>

>> (d) each party hereto shall pay its own costs in the matter.

18\. The next significant amendments made to the statutory forms of agreement
were introduced by the Housing Developers (Amendment) Rules, 1981. For our
purpose we need to mention only two material amendments to the relevant form,
namely, Form B. First, Rule 9 of the 1981 Rules deleted the reference to 'The
(Revised) Singapore Conditions of Sale' in Clause 1 of the sale and purchase
agreement and replaced it with the 'Singapore Law Society Conditions of Sale,
1981'. Secondly, Rule 12 amended cl 5(3) of the sale and purchase agreement by
deleting paragraphs (2) and (3) thereof and substituting new paragraphs (2),
(3) and (4). Paragraph (2) prescribed the interest rate payable for overdue
instalments; paragraph (3) was the cl 5(3) which is now under consideration,
and paragraph (4) was cl 5(4) of the Agreement. For the first time, the words
'without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in equity'
were inserted in cl 5(3). It was suggested by Mr Pereira that these words were
derived from condition 29 of the 'Singapore Law Society Conditions of Sale,
1981' which were incorporated into the statutory form of agreement. His reason
for saying this was that condition 29, which deals with the situation where
the purchaser fails to complete on the completion date, provides that if the
purchaser does not comply with the notice to complete served by the vendor
pursuant to condition 29, then -

> (a) ...
>
> (b) _without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to him at
> law or in equity_ , the Vendor may:
>

>> (i) forfeit and retain for his own benefit the deposit paid by the
Purchaser, and

>>

>> (ii) resell the property whether by auction or by private treaty without
previously tendering a conveyance to the Purchaser.

>
> [Emphasis is ours]

This is not seriously disputed by Mr Peter. We think that Mr Pereira is
probably right. We would say in passing that condition 29 was itself modelled
on condition 19 of the English Law Society's General Conditions of Sale: see
_The Singapore Law Society's Conditions of Sale 1981_ by Mr C C Tan (1982) MLJ
xxxix. The same words 'without prejudice to any other rights or remedies
available to him at law or equity' are also contained in condition 22 of the
English National Conditions of Sale. These words in the context of condition
19 of The Law Society's General Conditions of Sale and condition 22 of the
National Conditions of Sale have been construed by the courts in England in
the three cases relied upon by Mr Pereira, to which we shall refer in a
moment.

**Construction of Clause 5(3)**

19\. Having traced the historical evolution of cl 5(3) to the form now under
consideration, we turn to consider how the words 'without prejudice to any
other rights available to him at law or in equity' in the context of cl 5(3)
should be construed.

20\. Mr Pereira's submission is that when cl 5(3) is validly invoked these
words merely give to the developer an option to elect either to claim damages
at common law or to claim the amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3).
Thus, in this case Allgreen had that right of election, and since they had
exercised their rights under cl 5(3), they were entitled only to the sums
stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3) and were not entitled, in
addition, to damages at common law. In support, he relies on the three English
cases.

21\. Mr Peter, on the other hand, submits that when cl 5(3) is validly invoked
and the contract is annulled, as was the case here, the vendor is entitled to
forfeit the 20% of the purchase price under clause 5(3)(c) and this right is
exercisable, in the words of cl 5(3), 'without prejudice to any other rights
available to [the vendor] at law or in equity'. It follows that, if the amount
forfeited exceeds the actual loss or damage suffered by the vendor, the latter
may retain the surplus. But, if the amount forfeited is insufficient to cover
the loss, the vendor is entitled to recover from the purchaser the amount of
loss over and above the amount forfeited. Therefore, in the instant case, as
the loss sustained by Allgreen exceeded the sum forfeited, they were entitled
to claim the excess amount as well.

22\. We turn first to consider the cases relied upon by Mr Pereira. In _Talley
and Anor v Wolsey-Neech_ (1979) 38 P&CR 45, the plaintiffs agreed to sell a
house to the defendant for 55,000 and the defendant paid a deposit of 5,500.
The sale and purchase agreement incorporated The Law Society's General
Conditions of Sale (1973 rev.), of which condition 19, so far as material,
reads:

> 19(2) If the sale shall not be completed on the date fixed for completion
> either party may on that date or at any time thereafter give to the other
> party notice in writing to complete the transaction in accordance with this
> condition
>
> 19(3)
>
> 19(4) If the purchaser does not comply with the terms of an effective notice
> served by the vendor under this condition, then -
>

>> (b) _without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to him at
law or in equity_ , the vendor may -

>>

>>> (i) forfeit and retain for his own benefit the deposit paid by the
purchaser, and

>>>

>>> (ii) resell the property whether by auction or by private treaty without
previously tendering a conveyance to the purchaser,

>>

>> (c) if on any such re-sale contracted within one year from the date fixed
for completion the vendor incurs a loss, the purchaser shall pay to the vendor
as _liquidated damages_ the amount of such loss, which shall include all costs
and expenses reasonably incurred in any such re-sale or any attempted re-sale,
subject to the vendor giving credit for any deposit and any money paid on
account of the purchase price, but any surplus money shall be retained by the
vendor. [Emphases is ours]

The defendant failed to complete on the date fixed for completion. The
plaintiffs served on him the requisite notice to complete under condition
19(4) but the purchaser still failed to complete, and in consequence the
vendor resold the house. The house fetched a price, which was 4,000 below the
price at which the defendant contracted to pay. The plaintiffs brought an
action against the defendant claiming:

> (i) 4,000, being the reduction of price on resale.
>
> (ii) costs and expenses in effecting the resale, and
>
> (iii) interest on the amount of the purchase price which should have been
> paid by the defendant, for the period stretching from the date when the
> defendant should have completed to the date of completion of the resale.

The Court of Appeal held that the third head of damage, i.e. the interest, was
not recoverable, since it did not fall within the scope of condition 19(4).
Browne LJ held at pp 51-53:

> When a buyer defaults by failing to complete on the due date after time has
> been made of the essence of the contract, the seller can choose between
> various rights and remedies .
>
> If he decides to sue for damages, he can choose whether to sell or not, and
> the measure of damages will be different according to his choice.
>
> In my view, the object and effect of the opening words of condition 19(4)(b)
> [i.e. "without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to him at
> law or in equity"] are to make it clear that these rights of choice are
> preserved to the seller, but, if he chooses to exercise his rights and
> remedies under condition 19(4)(c), he can, in my view, only do so in
> accordance with and within the limits of the provisions of this condition.
>
> If, as [counsel for the vendor] suggests, the effect of condition 19(4)(c)
> were merely to provide machinery for the simple quantification of one
> element in the damages at common law, it could and would have been very
> differently worded. It seems to me that the words "liquidated damages" are
> conclusive.
>
> In my judgment, the plaintiffs, having chosen to exercise their rights and
> remedies under condition 19(4)(c), are only entitled to recover the
> "liquidated damages" defined by that condition

23\. The next case is _Wallace-Turner v Cole_ (1983) 46 P&CR 164. There, the
plaintiff agreed to sell a flat to the purchaser and the agreement
incorporated the National Conditions of Sale, 19th ed (1976). Condition 22(3)
provided that if, on the purchaser failing to complete, the vendor resold the
property within the 12 months stated therein, the vendor would be entitled, on
crediting the deposit, to recover from the purchaser 'the amount of loss
occasioned to the vendor by expenses of or incidental to such resale, or by
diminution of the price'. The purchaser failed to complete, in spite of the
notice to complete under condition 22. The plaintiff contracted to resell the
flat and issued a writ claiming the diminution of the price as the measure of
his loss. That contract, however, was not completed. Subsequently the
plaintiff resold the flat and claimed 9,600 being the diminution in the price
of the flat. It was held, inter alia, that under the terms of condition 22(3)
the vendor was put to his election between liquidated damages under the
condition and unliquidated damages at large for loss of bargain and breach of
contract and that when the plaintiff took judgment for the unliquidated
damages, he opted for unliquidated damages. Mr John Mowbray QC, sitting as a
deputy High Court judge, said at p 167:

> In my judgment _Talley v Wolsey-Neech_ shows that a vendor cannot recover
> both a contractual sum under such a condition as condition 22 and damages
> for the delay. The conditions there were the Law Society's General
> Conditions of Sale (1975 rev.), and they referred to the sum expressly as
> "liquidated damages," and the Court of appeal relied on those words; but in
> my judgment the sum payable under condition 22 of the National Conditions of
> Sale was also liquidated damages and that does not distinguish _Talley v
> Wolsey-Neech_.

The learned judge further said at p 168:

> ... The basis of the decision in _Talley v Wolsey-Neech_ , as I understand
> it, is that a vendor is put to his election between his different remedies.
> It is common ground between counsel that he is put to an election between
> damages and specific performance. _Talley v Wolsey-Neech_ is, in my view, a
> decision that he is likewise put to his election between liquidated damages
> under this kind of condition and unliquidated damages at large for loss of
> bargain and breach of contract.

24\. The third case relied on by Mr Pereira is _Sakkas and Anor v Donford Ltd_
(1983) 46 P&CR 290, which was decided Mr Grantchester QC, sitting as a Deputy
High Court judge. In that case, the defendant purchased the property at a
public auction and the contract incorporated the National Conditions of Sale
(19th ed). Subsequently the purchaser refused to complete the contract on
discovering certain material information relating to the property which was
not disclosed in the particulars of the property at the auction. The learned
judge held that the purchaser was entitled to rescind the contract on the
ground that the vendor had failed to disclose the material information
concerning the property and that the particulars of the property furnished by
the vendor contained information which was untrue to the knowledge of the
vendor. However, he went further to consider the question of damages, should
the claim of the vendor be upheld. In that connection, he considered condition
22(3) of the National Conditions of Sale and following _Talley v Woolsley-
Neech_ held at p 309:

> ...In my view that case is authority for the proposition that where a vendor
> elects to proceed under a condition similar to the condition in that case,
> what he then obtains thereunder is only the difference between the initial
> sale price and the re-sale price and the costs of the re-sale. Condition 22
> of the National Conditions of Sale (19th ed.) in the present case, although
> the words "as liquidated damages" do not appear therein, says that after a
> notice to complete such as was given in this case, then the purchaser's
> deposit may be forfeited and the vendor can re-sell. Thereupon the condition
> provides that the vendor shall be entitled upon crediting the deposit to
> recover from the purchaser thereunder the amount of any loss occasioned by
> the vendor by expenses of or incidental to such re-sale or by diminution in
> the price. Such condition, as I read it, in the circumstances that happened
> in this case, indicates that the rights of the plaintiffs on the re-sale at
> 12,000 are only to claim for the 2,300 shortfall, plus the costs of the re-
> sale of 258.75.

25\. For completeness, we should mention that about a month before the
decision in _Sakkas_ , a different conclusion was arrived at in the case of
_Bruce v Waziri_(1983) 46 P&CR 81. There, the plaintiff entered into a
contract to sell her house to the defendant and the contract incorporated the
National Conditions of Sale, 19th ed (1976). The purchaser failed to complete
on the date fixed for completion and the vendor gave him a notice to complete
under condition 22 but the purchaser still failed to complete. The vendor
treated the contract as discharged and resold the property at a lesser price
resulting in a loss of 42,500. The vendor claimed against the purchaser
special damages for the loss occasioned. In allowing the claim, Mr Julian
Jeffs QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court judge, distinguished the case before
him from _Talley v Woolsley-Neech_ on the ground that the two conditions,
namely condition 22 of the National Conditions of Sale and condition 19 of The
Law Society's General Conditions of Sale, are different. He held at pp 86-87:

> If, on a proper construction of condition 22 of the National Conditions of
> Sale, which govern the contract in this case, the same provision occurs as
> was contained in The Law Society's Conditions of Sale which were under
> consideration in _Talley v Wolsey-Neech_ , that is decisive of the matter.
> The plaintiff has her remedy according to that condition and none other.
>
> However, in my judgment, the two conditions cannot be equated and condition
> 22 of the National Conditions of Sale does not provide a remedy limited to
> liquidated damages. I can emphasise this by going back to the specific
> wording of the conditions in question. Looking at condition 19(4) of The Law
> Society's General Conditions of Sale as set out in _Talley v Wolsey-Neech_ ,
> which I have already read, it is to be noted that there are three sub-
> paragraphs to condition 19(4).... Paragraph (c) reads: "if on any resale
> contracted within one year from the date fixed for completion the vendor
> incurs a loss, the purchaser shall" - (it is mandatory) \- "pay to the
> vendor as liquidated damages," certain sums which are there set out. I
> emphasise the words "shall" and " as liquidated damages."
>
> On my construction of paragraph (3), _the words_ "without prejudice to any
> other right or remedy available to the vendor" govern the whole of it, and
> the last section is put in to clarify the vendor's entitlement in respect of
> certain heads if the property is resold. I accordingly hold in this case
> that the two conditions are distinguishable and that the plaintiff is
> entitled to recover the special damages which she claims.

26\. We do not find these English cases of any assistance in our construction
of cl 5(3) of the Agreement. There is a material difference between, on the
one hand, the context in which the words 'without prejudice to any other
rights or remedies available to him [the vendor] at law or in equity' are set
out in condition 19(4) of The Law Society's General Conditions of Sale and
condition 22(3) of the National Conditions of Sale and, on the other hand, the
context in which a similar wording is set out in cl 5(3) of the Agreement. For
this purpose, we need to revisit the material wording of condition 19(4) which
is as follows:

> 19(4) If the purchaser does not comply with the terms of an effective notice
> served by the vendor under this condition, then -
>

>> (a) ..

>>

>> (b) _without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to him at
law or in equity_ , the vendor may -

>>

>>> (i) forfeit and retain for his own benefit the deposit paid by the
purchaser, and

>>>

>>> (ii) resell the property whether by auction or by private treaty without
previously tendering a conveyance to the purchaser,

>>

>> (c) if on any such re-sale contracted within one year ..the vendor incurs a
loss, the purchaser shall pay to the vendor as _liquidated damages_ the amount
of such loss, which shall include .., subject to the vendor giving credit for
any deposit and any money paid on account of the purchase price, but any
surplus money shall be retained by the vendor.

With the condition so structured, it is plain that, if and when condition
19(4) applies, the words 'without prejudice to any other rights or remedies
available to [the vendor] at law or in equity' operate to give the vendor the
options available to him at law or in equity. Accordingly, the vendor has the
option of (a) treating the contract as still subsisting and pursuing a claim
for specific performance and damages in addition or in lieu thereof, or (b)
treating the contract as having been repudiated and (i) claiming unliquidated
damages at large for loss of bargain and breach of contractor, or (ii)
claiming the amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c) of condition 19(4). The same
position applies to condition 22(3) of the National Conditions of Sale:
_Wallace-Turner v Cole_ and _Sakkas v Dunford_(supra).

27\. Turning to cl 5(3), we find that the entire clause is differently
structured and the context in which the words 'without prejudice to any other
rights available to him at law or in equity' are set out is different. At the
risk of repetition, the material part of cl 5(3) is as follows:

> (3) If ., the Vendor shall be entitled at its option on giving to the
> Purchaser or his solicitors not less than twenty-one (21) days' notice in
> writing to treat this Agreement as having been repudiated by the Purchaser
> and (unless in the meanwhile the unpaid instalments and interest shall have
> been paid) this Agreement shall at the expiration of such notice (and in
> this respect time shall be of the essence) be annulled and in such an event,
> without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in equity,
> the Vendor shall be entitled:-
>

>> (a) to resell.

>>

>> (b) to recover all interest calculated ..

>>

>> (c) to forfeit and retain ..twenty (20%) per cent of the purchase price
from the instalments ..

Thus, as and when such clause is validly invoked, the agreement is 'is
annulled' and is at an end. In that event, the consequences set out in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) apply and the words 'without prejudice to any
other rights available to [the vendor] at law or in equity' has a narrower
scope. In our opinion, these words in the context in which they are set out do
not operate to give to the vendor an option or a right to elect either to
claim for unliquidated damages at large or to claim the sums stated in
paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). In the context in which they are set out
they cannot be construed in the manner in which similar words in condition
19(4) of The Law Society's General Conditions of Sale or condition 22(3) of
the National Conditions of Sale have been construed in those cases which we
have discussed.

28\. It is eminently clear that the purpose of the Housing Developers Rules
and the forms and contents of the sale agreements prescribed thereunder are
intended for the protection of purchasers of housing units developed and sold
by developers. The Housing Developers Rules, since they were first enacted,
contain restrictions on the rights of the developers with regard both to the
form and the terms of the contract which they are at liberty to make with
their purchasers. The statutory forms of contract prescribed by the Rules
dictate, among other things, the number and the amount of instalments of the
purchase price which a developer is allowed to receive from a purchaser at
different stages of the construction, the period of the notice required to be
given for calling such payments, the rates of interest the developer is
entitled to charge for any default in the payment of any instalment, the
period required to be given to a purchaser before the developer is entitled to
treat the agreement as having been repudiated and to annul it, and the measure
of damages the developer is entitled to recover from the purchaser.

29\. For these reasons, it could not have been the intention of the
legislature to provide to the developer by cl 5(3) a right to claim damages at
common law, in addition to their rights to recover the amounts under
paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3) as contended by Mr Peter. Nor, in our
opinion, could it have been intended to provide the developer an option to
elect either to claim damages at common law or to proceed to recover the
amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3) as contended by Mr Pereira. In
our opinion, as and when cl 5(3) is validly invoked and the agreement is
annulled, the rights of the developer to the amount of damages which he is
entitled to recover from the purchaser is confined to paragraphs (b) and (c)
of cl 5(3). That is the measure of damages the developer is entitled to. He is
not entitled to claim damages for breach of contract at common law and recover
more than what he would be entitled under cl 5(3). We are reinforced in our
conclusion by the presence of cl 5(4), which unequivocally provides:

> The balance of the instalments prepaid by the Purchasers after making
> deductions in accordance with paragraph (3)(b) and (c) shall be refunded to
> the Purchaser.

By reason of this sub-clause, the vendor is under an express obligation to
refund the purchase moneys after making the deductions specified in paragraphs
(b) and (c) of cl 5(3). This means that the vendor can only keep what has been
deducted under clause 5(3).

30\. Turning to the words 'without prejudice to any other rights available to
the vendor at law or in equity', we are of the opinion that they are intended
to preserve to the developer 'other rights' he may have, such as his right to
payment of other sums which has accrued under the agreement: see _Lim Lay Bee
and Anor v Allgreen Properties Ltd_ [1999] 1 SLR 471. The words 'other rights'
mean rights other than the rights to damages which the developer is entitled
to recover under paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3) of the Agreement.

31\. It is also instructive to refer briefly to _Lim Lay Bee_. The case
concerned another apartment of the same development 'Springdale Condominium'
and involved the same developers, namely, Allgreen. There, the purchaser had
paid only the booking fee which was 5% of the purchase price. Under the
agreement, the first instalment payable was 20% of the purchase price, which
included the 5% already paid. The purchaser defaulted in payment of the
balance of the first instlament ('the balance sum') and also a subsequent
instalment. Allgreen therefore served on the purchaser an annulment notice
under cl 5(3) of the agreement, and thereafter commenced proceedings against
him claiming the balance sum due and two other sums representing interests
due. It was held by the Court of Appeal that Allgreen's right to payment of
the balance sum under cl 3(1) accrued prior to the termination of the
agreement; that reading cl 3(1)(a) and cl 5(3)(c) together this right survived
the termination of the agreement; and that Allgreen were entitled to recover
this amount and forfeit it. In the course of the judgment the Court said
obiter at 11:

> Loh's defaults in payment of the instalments, the respondents in exercise of
> their rights under cl 5(3) annulled and terminated the agreement, and their
> rights and remedies in such an event are governed by cl 5(3) which is quite
> explicit and specific: it provides that 'without prejudice to any other
> rights available to' them, they are entitled to the rights as set out in
> paras a) to c) of that clause. In so far as the monetary compensation is
> concerned, the respondents are entitled, first, under para (b) to 'recover
> from the instalments (excluding payments of interest) previously paid by the
> Purchaser' the interest on the overdue instalments, and secondly, under para
> (c) to forfeit and retain, also from the instalments (excluding payments of
> interest) previously paid by the Purchaser' a sum equal to 20% of the
> purchase price. The respondents are thus empowered to have recourse to the
> sums previously paid under cl 3(1) for the purpose of satisfying the two
> amounts under paras (b) and (c) of cl 5(3)

**Conclusion**

32\. In our judgment, as the Agreement had been annulled under cl 5(3),
Allgreen were entitled to payment of the amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c)
of cl 5(3). They were also entitled to be paid by Mr Hakim the outstanding
maintenance charges and property tax, as their rights to these sums had
accrued prior to the termination of the Agreement. Subject to payment of these
sums, Allgreen are obliged to refund to Mr Hakim the balance of the
instalments paid under the Agreement.

33\. We therefore allow the appeal with costs here and below, and set aside
the judgment below. Allgreen were obliged to refund to Mr Hakim the sum of
$440,919.07. It appears that Allgreen had refunded to Mr Hakim the sum of
$399,259.87. That being the case, there will be judgment for Mr Hakim for the
refund of the balance. The deposit in court, with interest, if any, is to be
refunded to Mr Hakim or his solicitors.
