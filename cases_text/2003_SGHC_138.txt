1 The plaintiff UCO Bank (“UCO”) claimed damages in this action, as a holder
of bills of lading, against the defendant Golden Orient Maritime Pte Ltd
(“Golden Orient”) who was the owner of the vessel “ASEAN SUCCESS”.

2 Golden Orient then applied for a stay of this action on two grounds:

(a) clause 17 in the bills being an exclusive jurisdiction provision which
provided for claims to be dealt with under the jurisdiction of the courts at
the intended port of delivery i.e Kandla, India,

(b) that, in any event, India is clearly the more appropriate forum to hear
the dispute.

The application was heard by an Assistant Registrar who granted a stay o the
basis that clause 17 was an exclusive jurisdiction provision but made no
decision on the second ground.

3 UCO then appealed to a judge-in-chambers. Its arguments were that clause 17
was not an exclusive jurisdiction provision and, even if it was, there was
strong cause why UCO should not be held to such a provision on the particular
facts of the case. In turn, Golden Orient filed an appeal to a judge-in-
chambers on the basis that the Assistant Registrar should also have ruled on
the second ground in its favour but, in my view, such an appeal was
unnecessary since Golden Orient was the successful party below and it could
still rely on the second ground in its argument against UCO’s appeal.

4 After hearing submissions, I allowed UCO’s appeal. I was of the view that
clause 17 was an exclusive jurisdiction clause but nevertheless, the stay
should be refused. I made no order on Golden Orient’s appeal. Golden Orient
has since appealed to the Court of Appeal.

5 I should add that there is similar claim in Suit 1582/2001 by UCO against
Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd as the owner of another vessel “ASEAN
PIONEER” on similar facts. The outcome of the appeal before me in the present
action followed the outcome of the appeal in Suit 1582/2001.

6 My reasons for allowing UCO’s appeal in the present action were the same as
those stated in my Grounds of Decision for Suit 1582/2001.

_Plaintiff’s appeal allowed._
