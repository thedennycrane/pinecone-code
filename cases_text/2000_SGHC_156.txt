**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1 The plaintiffs are the Management Corporation of Strata Title No. 607, a
strata title development known as Alexandra Centre and located along Alexandra
Road. This development comprises 2 land lots, namely (a) Mukim 1 Lot 2059L
("Lot 2059L") and (b) Mukim 1 Lot 2094X ("the Land"). Both land lots are
registered land under the Land Titles Act. The shops and apartment units in
Alexandra Centre are built on Lot 2059L. No building is erected on the Land,
which is an open area with most of it paved over and used for access and
parking of vehicles. The Land constitutes part of the common property of
Alexandra Centre.

2 Adjacent to Alexandra Centre is a row of 2-storey terrace houses. This is
divided into 14 units in all, comprising 7 first-storey and 7 second-storey
units. The first-storey units are shop units whereas the second-storey units
are residential apartments. The defendants are the registered proprietors of
these 14 units. Some of the defendants own more than one of the units and some
units have more than one registered proprietor. In all there are 12
proprietors and all of them are joined as defendants in this action.

3 The deed of indenture in respect of each of the defendants' units contains a
grant of an easement to the proprietor thereof in relation to the Land. I
shall set out its terms later. The question is the scope of that easement. The
defendants and the other occupants of their units have been using the Land for
the following purposes:

> (i) access to their units from the public road by foot or by vehicle;
>
> (ii) parking of vehicles of the defendants, occupants and their customers,
> including overnight parking; and
>
> (iii) conducting part of their businesses, such as repairs to and
> installation of accessories on vehicles, seating for customers of a
> restaurant and storage of goods.

4 The plaintiffs take the position that the defendants' use of the Land is
beyond the scope of the easement. In this summons they seek the determination
of the court on the following questions:

> (i) Whether the defendants, by themselves and/or their servant, agent or
> otherwise or any of them, are entitled to occupy the Land for their usage to
> the exclusion of the plaintiffs.
>
> (ii) Whether the defendants, by themselves and/or their servant, agent or
> otherwise or any of them, are entitled to place/store/park or cause to be
> placed/stored/parked goods, vehicles and/or other chattel on the Land.
>
> (iii) Whether the defendants, by themselves and/or their servant, agent or
> otherwise or any of them, are entitled to enter/cross over the Land
> otherwise than by foot i.e. by way of motor vehicle.
>
> (iv) Whether the plaintiffs by themselves and/or their servant, agent or
> otherwise are entitled to quiet enjoyment for any purpose they deem fit of
> the Land without obstruction or interference from the defendants or their
> servant, agent or otherwise or any of them.

5 After the first day of hearing the parties decided to refer the matter to
the Singapore Mediation Centre for mediation. However this turned out to be
unsuccessful and they reverted to me with further submissions. After hearing
them again on 22 May 2000, I made the following declarations and orders:

> _
>
> (i) The Defendants, by themselves and/or their servant, agent or otherwise
> or any of them, are not entitled to occupy, for their usage to the exclusion
> of the Plaintiff, the land known as Lot 2094X Mukim 1 Alexandra Road or part
> thereof ("Lot 2094X") belonging to the Plaintiff.
>
> _

> _
>
> (ii) The Defendants, by themselves and/or their servant, agent or otherwise
> or any of them, are not entitled to place and or store goods and other
> chattel on Lot 2094X.
>
> (iii) The Defendants, by themselves and/or their servant, agent or otherwise
> or any of them, are entitled to park vehicles on Lot 2094X subject to the
> following conditions:
>
> (a) the vehicles are not to obstruct the free flow of vehicles along the
> service road;
>
> (b) parking means the leaving of the vehicle on Lot 2094X in a reasonable
> manner for the purpose of enabling the driver to carry on his affairs at the
> Defendants' premises namely:
>

>> (1) residence;

>>

>> (2) business (i.e. for employment there);

>>

>> (3) as lawful visitors; and

>>

>> (4) as customers,

>>

>> and for this purpose, parking does not include leaving vehicles on Lot
2094X for the purpose of storage or conducting business in respect of the
vehicles e.g. repairs etc.

>
> (iv) The Defendants, by themselves and/or their servant, agent or otherwise
> or any of them, are entitled to enter/cross over Lot 2094X otherwise than by
> foot i.e. by way of motor vehicle.
>
> _

> (v) The Plaintiff by itself and/or its servant, agent or otherwise is
> entitled to quiet enjoyment for any purpose it deems fit of Lot 2094X
> without obstruction or interference from the Defendants or their servant,
> agent or otherwise or any of them subject to the Defendants' rights in the
> easement as abovestated.

> (vi) The Defendants to pay to the Plaintiff the total sum of S$ 2,400.00 as
> costs of this application, with each Defendant to contribute S$ 200.00.

> (vii) The Plaintiff to have liberty to apply for further orders for
> enforcement.

6 The Plaintiffs have appealed against my decision in respect of declaration
(iii) above and I now give the grounds of my decision in respect of it. For
completeness, I include brief reasons for the other declarations, i.e., (i),
(ii), (iv) and (v).

**

Adverse possession

**

7 The defendants were not represented by counsel. But counsel for the
plaintiffs, Miss Hong, in the best tradition of the Bar, presented her
clients' case fairly and provided me with invaluable support in relation to
the authorities that might favour the defendants.

8 The first consideration is whether the defendants might have acquired any
title to the Land by adverse possession. There is some evidence that the
defendants, or their predecessors-in-title, had been using the Land since 1961
for access, parking and for their business much in the same manner as they are
using it today. Although such evidence was not given by way of formal
affidavit, Miss Hong did not dispute it. The plaintiffs came into the picture
after the vendors developed Alexandra Centre and the management corporation
was constituted in 1982. Up to that time no action was taken by the vendors
against the defendants or their predecessors-in-title in respect of their use
of the Land. Even after 1982, the plaintiffs did not take any action until
shortly before this summons was filed in December 1999. In the affidavit filed
by Tan Kok Peng ("Tan") on behalf of the plaintiffs, Tan deposed that the Land
was being used by the defendants to the exclusion of the plaintiffs. Hence the
defendants had been using the Land continuously in this manner to the
exclusion of the plaintiffs for almost 40 years.

9 There may have been other impediments to a claim in adverse possession, but
an inquiry as to that is rendered unnecessary by virtue of the Land Titles
Act. This is because the defendants had not taken out any application under
section 172(8) of that Act. Any title they might have been able to claim had
been removed by operation of section 50, which provides as follows:

> 50\. Except as provided in section 172(8) and (9), no title to land adverse
> to or in derogation of the title of a proprietor of registered land shall be
> acquired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation Act or
> otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor of registered land be
> extinguished by the operation of that Act.

Section 172(8) obliges a person to make his claim in adverse possession by 1
September 1984. The defendants had not made any claim at all and section 50 of
the Act would now exclude such a claim.

**

Prescription

**

10 The second consideration is whether any easement had been acquired by
prescription on the basis of the doctrine of lost modern grant. This doctrine
applies in Singapore in respect of unregistered land - see _Xpress Print v
Monocrafts Pte Ltd & Anor_ (Unreported) Civil Appeal No. 202/1999 (24 July
2000) at paragraph 36. In the present case there is some evidence that the
defendants had been using the Land to park their vehicles since their units
were completed in 1960 or 1961, i.e. almost 40 years before the plaintiffs
took out this action. If the defendants had been doing this for a period of 20
years before the Land was brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Act,
they could have acquired an easement over it. Such an easement would not be
affected by the subsequent conversion to registered land because section 46
provides that such land is held subject to any subsisting easement.

11 However, from the Certificate of Title it can be seen that a qualified
Certificate of Title was issued on 6 November 1978. Therefore the requisite 20
years would not have elapsed since the defendants' units were only completed
around 1960. Once the Land has become registered land, no easement can be
acquired by prescription by virtue of section 97 of the Land Titles Act.
Accordingly, there could not have been an easement acquired by prescription.

**

Indenture

**

12 The remaining question is the scope of the easement granted in the
indenture. The plaintiffs exhibited the deeds of indenture in respect of all
the defendants' units. They are similar in nature and I reproduce below a
typical indenture, which relates to one of the first-storey units:

13 It can be seen from this indenture that an undivided half share of the land
in fee simple was conveyed to the purchaser of the unit who had also taken a
lease on the first-storey of the building for 9,999 years. The other undivided
half share of the land was conveyed to the purchaser who had taken a similar
lease on the second-storey of that building. The First Schedule to the
indenture describes the land in question and the interest conveyed. This
comprises the land upon which the building is built and includes the rights
described in the words underlined above.

14 Miss Hong agreed that those words relate to the grant of an easement, the
dominant tenement being the land the subject of the indenture, i.e. the land
on which the particular unit is built. The servient tenement is described in
the indenture as _"the Service Road"_ and the _"open space"_ coloured brown in
the plan annexed to the indenture. It is not clear from the copies of the
indenture exhibited exactly what were coloured brown. But the plaintiffs were
prepared to concede that this refers to the Land. The plaintiffs agree that
the sole question for determination is the scope of this easement.

15 Before making this determination, it is necessary to set out the following
facts by way of background. The conveyances of the defendants' units were made
in 1961 and 1962. The government had since acquired a part of the original
land, apparently for widening of Alexandra Road. Indeed, it was because this
or a later widening exercise caused the loss of parking space along Alexandra
Road previously enjoyed by the plaintiffs' subsidiary proprietors that
prompted them to take out this action. Therefore for almost 40 years, from
1960 to 1999, the defendants had enjoyed continuous, uninterrupted use of the
Land.

16 From the survey plan exhibited by the plaintiffs, it can be seen that the
front of the defendants' buildings were constructed right up to the boundary
line of the Land. This means that the defendants' units are landlocked and the
only means of access to the public thoroughfare, Alexandra Road, was through
the Land. The plan annexed to the indenture shows a private service road built
on the Land. In front of the defendants' units this service road makes a full
loop around an unpaved oval area. There appears to be no provision for parking
of vehicles apart from parallel parking along the service road. In the course
of the submissions, one of the defendants said that at that time their cars
were parked along the service road. However this evidence was not made on
affidavit although Miss Hong did not object to nor dispute it. Nevertheless,
it is an inference that can be readily drawn from the circumstances and I so
infer.

17 The defendants produced some evidence that in 1977 they had been asked by
the vendors, who at the time were the proprietors of the Land, to contribute a
sum of money towards the repair and upkeep of the service road. The defendants
also claimed that they had, since the conveyance of their units, been paying
for the maintenance and upkeep of the Land. Again this was not by way of
affidavit, but this was not denied by the plaintiffs. In any event, there is
covenant in clause II(i) of the indenture binding each defendant to contribute
a fair sum for the maintenance of the service road which would be consistent
with the defendants' assertions.

18 There is a further point in respect of clause II(i) of the indenture. For
convenience, I set it out again. It covenants the proprietor:

> To contribute from time to time a fair and rateable proportion of the cost
> of maintaining and keeping in repair the Service Road marked Private Lot 396
> and coloured brown in the said plan annexed and also all culverts pipes
> cables or water drains now or hereafter on or under the Estate the
> proportion in case of difference to be ascertained at the option of the
> Vendor by an arbitrator or arbitrators appointed for that purpose in terms
> of the Arbitration Ordinance _but only until the same are taken over and
> maintained by the Singapore City Council or other competent authority_.

The service road and Private Lot 396 mentioned in this covenant relates to the
Land. The words underlined suggest an intention on the part of the vendors to
eventually surrender, among other things, the service road to the local
authority for the latter to take over and maintain it. As it has turned out,
this was not done and shortly before 1982, the vendors developed Alexandra
Centre of which the Land forms a part.

19 In any event it appears that part of the original land was compulsorily
acquired by the government for the widening of Alexandra Road. What remained
after acquisition comprises the Land, which became reduced in area by about
45%. As a consequence of this the looped service road no longer exists. In its
place, the unpaved oval area appears to have been paved over and is being used
for both access to the defendants' units and the parking of their vehicles.

20 It is in this context that I have to decide the scope of the easement
granted in the indenture. Miss Hong agreed that the determination in respect
of one indenture would apply in respect of the 13 other indentures.

21 Firstly it is clear that the easement cannot operate to exclude the
plaintiffs, the proprietor of the servient tenement, from the use of their
land. Accordingly, I made declarations (i) and (v). Secondly, it is also clear
that the expression _"to pass and repass with or without â€¦ motor cars and
other vehicles"_ grants a right of way whether on foot or by vehicles. Hence
declaration (iv) was made.

22 The remaining questions are whether the defendants are entitled (a) to
store their goods on the Land, which is the subject of declaration (ii), and
(b) to park their vehicles on the Land, the subject of declaration (iii). I
first deal with the issue of parking.

23 Miss Hong does not dispute that the right to park vehicles can be the
subject of an easement. Her point is that this is not stated in the indenture
and was therefore not part of the rights granted therein. Although it is true
that it is not specifically stated in the indenture that the grantee had the
right to park vehicles on the Land, I was of the view that the words in the
indenture _"to enjoy the open space"_ , in the context of the rest of the
indenture as well as the circumstances at the time of the grant, are
sufficient to include the right to park vehicles. My reasons are as follows.
It is not clear whether the defendants' units were sold before construction
was underway or only after completion. But even if there were no structures at
the time of sale, the purchasers would have seen a model of the development
or, at the very least, a drawing of the site. They would have noticed the
provision of the service road, and the fact that apart from this access road
there would be no other means of access to the units and no other place to
park their vehicles. The first storey units were sold as shophouses and the
second storey units as apartments for dwelling as provided in clause II(ii) of
the indenture. As is common today, it is likely that the question of vehicular
parking would have been on the minds of the purchasers. In fact clause II(i)
of the indenture obliges the proprietor to contribute towards maintenance of
the service road and appears to state that this service road would eventually
be handed to the local authority for maintenance. As it turned out, this was
not only not done, but the Land was subsequently conveyed to the plaintiffs as
part of the land comprised in Alexandra Centre. Although there is no evidence
of the state of the adjoining Alexandra Road at the time, it would not be
difficult to imagine that parking would be envisaged along the service road if
it were wide enough. Such evidence as is available before me seems to indicate
that it was and that vehicles were in fact parked on it. Finally, in
developing Alexandra Centre with both Lot 2059L and the Land, the vendors had
obtained the benefit of the Land even though it is stated in clause II(i) of
the indenture that the local authority would take over and maintain it.

24 The question then is, in the factual matrix before me, whether the words in
the indenture, i.e.:

> to pass and repass with or without horses cattle and other animals carts
> carriages motor cars and other vehicles of every description along the
> Service Road and to enjoy the open space coloured brown in the said plan
> annexed.

are sufficiently wide to include the right to park vehicles. I am of the view
that they are, for it is inconceivable that in the circumstances, vehicular
parking would not have been provided for. Furthermore, parking of vehicles is
incidental to access by vehicles. If there were no right to park, it would
mean that the defendants were only entitled to be conveyed to their units by
vehicle, such as in a taxi. If they owned cars, they would have had to park
them elsewhere and walk back. Although the expression _"pass and repass"_ by
itself would not include the right to park, I would hold that the words _"to
enjoy the open space"_ in the context of the indenture and the circumstances
of the case, cover parking of vehicles consistent with the defendants' right
of way over the Land. Accordingly the defendants are entitled to the rights in
declaration (iii).

25 As for declaration (ii), in my view the easement granted does not cover the
use by the defendants of the Land for the purpose of storing goods or other
chattel. Such use is not incidental to the right of way over the Land.
Therefore the plaintiffs are entitled to declaration (ii).
