**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT**

1\. The accused, Chia Jin Hock, a 35 year old male Chinese, was tried before
me on the following charge:

> that you, Chia Jin Hock on or about the 25th day of September 1999, at or
> about 11.30 a.m., at the void deck of Block 3 Hougang Avenue 3, Singapore,
> committed a scheduled offence, to wit, criminal intimidation, and at the
> time of the commission of the offence, you had on your
>
> person an arm, to wit, one Smith & Wesson .38 calibre revolver, and you have
> thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3(3) of the Arms
> Offences Act, Chapter 14.

2\. The prosecution led evidence that on 25 September 1999, Cpl Brian Chong
and his partner W/Cpl Florence Ngu were on patrol when they spotted the
accused standing along the road near Block 1, Hougang Avenue 3. They conducted
a spot check on the accused. When the accused was asked for his particulars,
he took out his identity card and handed it to Cpl Brian. Cpl Brian screened
the accused’s particulars. After the Division Operations Room informed Cpl
Brian that the accused was not wanted by the police, Cpl Brian returned the
identity card to him. W/Cpl Florence then told the accused to hand over his
black "Bodypac" sling bag for checking. The accused refused. Instead he asked
them why they wanted to check his bag. The accused opened the sling bag and
pretended to check the items inside. When the accused opened his bag, both
police constables saw a plastic bag containing straws of powdery substance.
Suddenly the Accused turned around and ran off.

3\. Both constables chased the accused. The accused ran to the void deck of
Block 3, Hougang Avenue 3. There the accused threw away the plastic bag
containing several straws of yellow powdery substance. The accused ran up the
stairs of Block 3 but he slipped and fell. Cpl Brian tried to restrain him but
the accused used his legs to kick Cpl Brian. Cpl Brian then hit the accused’s
leg with his baton. W/Cpl Florence tried to assist Cpl Brian to restrain the
accused. The accused used his legs to kick W/Cpl Florence as well. When the
accused got up from the ground, both police constables pulled the accused’s
arms behind his back so that they could handcuff him. However, the accused
managed to break free.

4\. Suddenly, the accused grabbed the butt of W/Cpl Florence’s revolver. W/Cpl
Florence immediately held on to her holster with both hands to prevent the
accused from taking her revolver. She pushed the accused away using her body
and also kicked his legs. In the meantime, Cpl Brian was trying to pull the
accused away from W/Cpl Florence. The accused tried a few times to remove
W/Cpl Florence’s revolver from the holster but failed. In the course of this,
W/Cpl Florence lost her balance and fell to the ground which resulted in the
accused losing his grip on her revolver.

5\. The accused then turned his attention to Cpl Brian and grabbed hold of the
butt of Cpl Brian’s revolver. Cpl Brian placed his right hand on the holster
and tried to push the accused away. The accused tried to pull out Cpl Brian’s
revolver. Suddenly, the accused pushed Cpl Brian causing him to fall
backwards. As he fell, the accused managed to pull Cpl Brian’s revolver out of
the holster and the lanyard attached to the revolver snapped. By this time,
Cpl Florence had got up from the ground. She was standing about 2 metres
behind Cpl Brian.

6\. Cpl Brian looked up and saw the accused holding the revolver in both hands
and with outstretched arms. The accused pointed the revolver directly at him.
The accused, who was then about 6 feet away, told Cpl Brian in a very serious
and threatening tone "Lu mai ko lai leow", which meant "Don’t you come any
nearer or any further". Cpl Brian however retracted his evidence that the
accused had told him not to move. In any event, Cpl Brian understood that if
he were to go forward any further, then his life and his partner’s life would
be in danger. Cpl Brian was very frightened.

7\. The accused then pointed the revolver at W/Cpl Florence, looked at her and
told her in a serious tone "Mai tong", which meant "Don’t move." She was very
frightened that he might shoot her. After that, the accused retreated a few
steps. He continued to point the revolver in the general direction of the
police constables to make sure that they were not going after him. Both police
constables remained where they were and did not dare to pursue the accused
anymore as he retreated. After the accused left the scene, W/Cpl Florence
informed the Division Operations Room that Cpl Brian’s revolver had been
snatched away. The accused’s identity card lying on the ground was retrieved
including the plastic bag containing several straws of powdery substance. The
accused’s black "Bodypac" sling bag was also recovered. The straws were found
to contain 10.47 gms of a granular powdery substance which was subsequently
analysed to contain 0.01 gm of diamorphine.

**

Statements of the Accused

**

8\. The accused did not dispute the voluntariness of the 2 statements he had
given to the police. Both his statements were accordingly admitted into
evidence. In the first cautioned statement, he said:

> I have no intention of taking the revolver. At that moment I just grab it.
> On the same day I placed the revolver in a dustbin somewhere near Block 335
> or Blk 355 Clementi Ave 2 after which I call the police at about 5 to 6 p.m.
> I call the police twice for this matter. When I was arrested I did not put
> up any struggle.

9\. At paragraphs 8 to 11 of his long statement recorded on 12 October 1999,
he related the following details:

> 8\. When I got up of the ground, the male police officer grabbed my shirt
> and pinned me sideway to the wall. Both the police officers then took out
> their handcuffs and wanted to handcuff me. Both of them were trying to hold
> on to my hands wanting to handcuff me. I refused to let them handcuff me and
> swing both my hands wildly at them and trying to push them away. I turned
> around and wanted to grab hold of the female police officer’s gun.
>
> 9\. I placed both of my hands at the butt of the gun and tried to pull it
> out of the holster. The woman police officer shouted at me and also used
> both her hands to hold on to her gun. I tried to pull out the gun by jerking
> the gun forcefully upwards but it was unsuccessful. I then gave up and
> released my grip on her gun. I pushed her down on the ground.
>
> 10\. I turned around faced the male police officer. I then went to grab the
> male police officer’s gun. When I was grabbing the male police officer’s
> gun, he used his handcuff to hit on my hand. He was also retreating
> backwards and I step forward each time he retreated. He retreated about 7
> steps and I pulled forcefully his gun upwards from his holster and the gun
> came out of the holster. At the same time, I pushed the male police officer
> down to the ground. As the police officer was falling to the ground, I
> continued to pull the gun backwards and the string that was attached to the
> gun snapped.
>
> 11\. I then pointed the gun at both the police officer and asked them not to
> force me. I also asked them let me free. I saw the woman police officer
> talking into the walkie-talkie. I then walked away from both of them. They
> did not give chase and just stood there. After a distance I put the gun at
> my waist inside my T-shirt. I was still wearing my T-shirt. I walked towards
> Blk 25 Hougang Ave 3……..

10\. The accused further stated in his long statement that he was eventually
persuaded by Ah Siong and his wife to surrender the gun. Ah Siong suggested
that he put the gun at the rubbish bin near Clementi Police Station and he
agreed. At about 6 p.m. on that day, the accused and his wife left for
Clementi. They alighted near the Clementi Police Station. They walked to Block
335 Clementi Ave 2. The accused found a plastic bag and some newspapers. He
unloaded the 5 rounds of ammunition from the gun. He wrapped the gun and the
bullets with newspapers and placed them into a plastic bag. He tied up the
plastic bag and threw it into a rubbish bin near a lift landing. The accused
unloaded the gun as he was afraid the gun might misfire if he threw it into
the rubbish bin. After that, he and his wife walked towards Blk 350 Clementi
Ave 2\. The accused then called the police from one of the public phones at
the void deck and informed the police that he had left the revolver inside the
rubbish bin at Blk 335 Clementi Ave 2. The revolver and 5 rounds of ammunition
were later recovered by the police.

11\. Insp Yong Chow Yniap of the Force Armament Branch of the Singapore Police
examined the revolver and found it to be in fully serviceable condition.

12\. Dr Francis Ngui, an associate consultant at Woodbridge Hospital, had
examined the accused on various occasions. In his opinion, the accused
suffered from heroin dependence and atypical psychosis. In his view, these
psychotic symptoms were most likely related to the accused’s past heroin and
sedative abuse. Dr Francis Ngui was of the opinion that the accused was
mentally fit to stand trial and to plead, and that he was not of unsound mind
at the time of the alleged offence as he knew the nature and quality of his
acts.

**

Close of Prosecution’s Case

**

13\. At the close of the prosecution’s case, I found that a prima facie case
was made out against the accused. Accordingly, I called the accused to give
evidence in his own defence. The accused elected to give evidence.

****

Evidence of the Accused

14\. The accused related how he came into possession of the drugs. He
confirmed that he was stopped by the 2 police constables who wanted to check
his identity card. The male police officer asked him why he was there and he
told them that he was buying 4-D tickets. After screening his identity card
and finding that he was not on the wanted list, the female officer told him
that she wanted to check his sling bag. Since their screening had confirmed
that he was not on the wanted list, he asked her why she still wanted to check
his sling bag. He knew that he had drugs with him. If he was arrested again
for the drugs, it would be his third time that he would be charged with drug
possession. He wanted to run away. So he ran off to Block 3 where he threw the
drugs away. He then ran up the stairs but he fell. The male officer approached
him from behind and tried to pull him down the staircase. After pulling him
down to the ground, the male officer used his baton to hit his legs and hands.

15\. When he was lying on the ground, the female officer kicked him with her
legs. The male officer pulled him up and pushed him to the wall in order to
handcuff him. The accused said that he managed to struggle free but he found
himself blocked by the female officer and was not able to run away. Suddenly
he came upon an idea to frighten the female officer by pulling out her
revolver.

16\. Whilst he was tugging at the female officer’s revolver, the male officer
used his handcuffs to hit him. He gave up trying to pull out the female
officer’s revolver and turned to the male officer instead. When he turned
towards the male officer, his hand happened to come into contact with the male
officer’s revolver. Instinctively, he grabbed hold of the male officer’s
revolver and began tugging at it. When the male officer retreated a few steps
and was about to fall, the accused managed to pull out the revolver.

17\. The accused said that he was very frightened at that time. He did not
expect himself to go to the extent of grabbing hold of the police officer’s
revolver. But the revolver was already in his hand. He then placed his hand
down and pointed the gun at the ground. He admitted that he had told the male
officer "not to force him anymore" or "not to come any more". When he looked
up, he saw the female officer but did not say anything to her. He then turned
to look at the male officer and thereafter, retreated a few steps. Before he
left, he was pointing the gun in a downward direction. Basically, he never
pointed the gun directly at either of the police constables. He proceeded to
walk to Block 1. Subsequently, he concealed the revolver underneath his
T-shirt. He also related the evidence that led him to place the revolver and
the ammunition in the dustbin. He said that he telephoned the police to tell
them where he had placed the revolver. The accused testified that he did not
surrender immediately because he wanted to consume heroin, which he did when
he spent the night at Blk 315, Hougang. On the next morning, the accused
realised that there were many plain clothes police officers tailing him. He
decided to surrender himself to them. He was then arrested.

18\. In his cross-examination, the accused admitted that his intention of
snatching the revolver was to prevent Cpl Brian from chasing him. However, it
did not occur to him how he was going to use the gun to stop Cpl Brian from
chasing him. He said that Cpl Brian was on the ground and he knew that Cpl
Brian would not be able to prevent him from running away. The accused
explained that there was therefore no necessity for him to hold the revolver
with both his hands and point it at Cpl Brian. He maintained that he never
pointed the revolver directly at Cpl Brian although he conceded that the
revolver was in Cpl Brian’s line of vision when Cpl Brian turned his head
around to look at him.

19\. With regard to the question whether he had pointed the revolver at W/Cpl
Florence, the accused said that he was not sure if the revolver was pointed in
her direction. The accused demonstrated by lifting his right arm almost
parallel to the ground. The gun was then in his right hand. The accused said
that he was swinging his right arm in that manner and in that angle. However,
during his second demonstration, he lifted his arm upwards, not to the front
of himself, but to his side and his head was facing away from the gun.

20\. It would appear from his evidence that he simply had no intention to
point the gun in the direction of W/Cpl Florence. The gun might have been
pointed at her inadvertently as he was swinging his body and his arm whilst he
was turning his body around. When he was asked by the learned DPP why he had
stated in his police statement that he had pointed the gun at both police
officers, the accused explained that he had told the investigating officer
that he was not sure of the direction in which he had pointed his revolver. As
he was uncertain, the investigating officer informed him that the 2 police
officers were there. As such, it was as if he were pointing the revolver at
them because he had pointed the gun in the direction where the police officers
were. The accused said that he was very frightened at that time and his
intention was to leave the scene as soon as possible. Thus, he was not sure
where he was aiming the revolver. When asked what he meant when he told Cpl
Brian not to force him any further, the accused said that there was a
possibility of Cpl Brian retrieving his revolver from him and in the ensuing
struggle, accidental harm could be caused to them or to any passer-by.

21\. The accused denied telling W/Cpl Florence not to move. When he again
denied having pointed the revolver at Cpl Brian, I then asked him whether he
had lowered the gun in his hand all the way down, to point it directly at the
ground. The accused disclosed that he was not pointing the gun directly at the
ground but was pointing the gun somewhere towards his right and that was where
Cpl Brian was lying.

22\. From this evidence, I inferred that his act of pointing the gun in the
direction of Cpl Brian was deliberate and intentional. The accused said that
he did not know how long he was doing that. But in the course of doing so, he
did tell Cpl Brian not to force him any further. The accused further admitted
that as he was leaving, he turned his body and swung his arm holding the gun
somewhere to his chest level. At first, the accused testified that he did
swing the gun to his chest level past the location where W/Cpl Florence was,
and that the gun would not be pointing above her head as he swung the gun pass
her position. When asked whether the gun would then be pointed at the level of
her chest, the accused retracted his earlier testimony and said that he was
not sure now. He said he could not be positive whether in the course of his
turning around, the revolver had pointed above the female police officer’s
head or at her chest region. In any event, the accused admitted that both
police constables did not move. He could even see that Cpl Brian was shivering
and his lips were quivering. These to my mind were obvious manifestations of
Cpl Brian’s extreme fear at the time when the accused was pointing the gun at
him. It lent credence to Cpl Brian’s and W/Cpl Florence’s evidence that the
accused had indeed pointed the gun directly at Cpl Brian whilst he was lying
on the ground.

**

Findings

**

23\. I found that the charge against the accused had been proved beyond a
reasonable doubt. I believed the evidence of the two police constables that
the accused had pointed the gun directly at Cpl Brian in a menacing fashion
and had threatened him not to come any closer. Just before he retreated, he
had also pointed the gun in the direction of W/Cpl Florence and told her not
to move. The seriousness with which he had uttered those words in Hokkien was
not lost on these two police constables who therefore stopped pursuing the
accused lest he should use the gun against them. I disbelieved the accused’s
evidence that he never pointed the gun at either of the police constables or
that any pointing of the gun at W/Cpl Florence was merely accidental because
he happened to swing his body and his arm around past her direction as he was
moving away. I accepted the learned DPP’s submission that it was most
unbelievable that the accused, who was desperately trying to escape, would
choose not to use the revolver, which he had tried so hard to take in the
first place, to deter these determined officers from further pursuing and
arresting him in the course of their duty. I was fully satisfied that the
accused was completely aware of the nature and quality of his actions at the
material time. He was in full control of his faculties. His ability to relate
with surprising clarity his version of the incident during his testimony in
court confirmed the conclusions reached by Dr Francis Ngui, which I accepted.

24\. As such, I found that the accused had threatened the police constables
with injury to their persons, and this was intended to stop them from chasing
and apprehending him, which these two police constables were entitled to do.
Clearly the accused had committed criminal intimidation under s 506 of the
Penal Code, which is a scheduled offence under the Arms Offences Act, Chapter
14. Since he had with him a Smith & Wesson revolver at the time of the
commission of that scheduled offence, I found the accused guilty of the
offence as charged. Accordingly, I convicted him.

**

Sentence

**

25\. The sentence prescribed for the offence is life imprisonment and a
minimum of 6 strokes of the cane. Having considered the accused’s mitigation
(which was in his closing submissions) and his antecedents which were mainly
drug-related, and having regard to the rest of the charges which the accused
admitted and consented to be taken into consideration for the purpose of
sentencing, it was appropriate in my view that he be given 12 strokes of the
cane. I noted that one of the charges taken into consideration was under
section 394 of the Penal Code, where he had committed robbery of the revolver
in the possession of Cpl Brian and in the course of committing that robbery,
he had voluntarily caused hurt to Cpl Brian. This offence carries with it a
punishment of caning with no less than 12 strokes. Accordingly, I sentenced
him to imprisonment for life and 12 strokes of the cane.

Dated this 20th day of April, 2000.
