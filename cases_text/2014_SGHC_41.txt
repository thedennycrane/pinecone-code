Introduction

1 The present action, which concerns the estate of the late Lim Tian Siong
(“the father”) and the estate of his wife, the late Goh Choon Eng (“the
mother”), is a dispute amongst siblings. The first defendant, Lim Boh Chuan
(“D1”), was the eldest child of the family and one of the administrators of
the father’s estate. The second defendant, Lim Puay Koon (“D2”), was the
second child of the family and one of the administrators of the mother’s
estate. The plaintiff, Mdm Lim Siew Bee, the youngest sibling, claims to have
been deprived of her actual entitlement in both estates by the defendants.

2 The plaintiff alleges, amongst other things, that the defendants had
dishonestly and in breach of trust dealt with assets belonging to their
parents’ estates in a manner that diminished the values of both estates
thereby benefitting themselves at her expense.[note: 1] As her pleadings
stand, the plaintiff primarily seeks the remedy of an account of both parents’
estates based on the wrongdoings of the defendants. It is thus necessary for
her to make good her plea of dishonesty and breach of trust in order to be
entitled to an account grounded on misconduct of the defendants. Likewise, as
her pleadings stand, the plaintiff also seeks to surcharge or falsify a set of
accounts prepared in relation to the father’s estate that D1 had furnished to
her on 11 January 2011 (see [64] below). She says, amongst other things, that
she is entitled to do so because D1 had breached his fiduciary duty in
administering the father’s estate.

3 The defendants deny the allegations. In fact, most of the defendants’
efforts at the trial were directed at refuting the plaintiff’s specific
allegations against them. In the alternative, the defendants seek relief under
s 63 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 TA”) on the grounds
that they acted honestly and reasonably throughout the administration of their
parents’ estates, and that they ought fairly to be excused for any breach of
trust as may be proved against them. Furthermore, as this case concerns events
that happened 20 years ago, the defendants’ contention in the alternative is
that the plaintiff’s claims, if any, are either statute barred or barred by
laches and estoppel.

4 In determining whether the plaintiff’s allegations against the defendants
are made out, I have to decide not just what was specifically involved in the
alleged culpable acts or omissions, but whether they were made out on the
evidence. In addition, one of the issues I have to decide is whether D1 was in
breach of duty as administrator in not recouping estate duty on a pro-rata
basis from donees of _inter vivos_ gifts made within five years of the
father’s death. This question is to be determined based on an analysis of the
provisions of the Estate Duty Act (Cap 96, 1970 Rev Ed) (“the 1970 EDA”),
which was in force at the time of the father’s death.

Factual background

The family’s circumstances

5 The plaintiff and her brothers were brought up in a traditional Chinese
household where the father was head of the family and, as sole breadwinner,
provided for the financial well-being of the family and education of the
children. The mother’s role was to take care of the family and home and, as a
housewife, she did not involve herself in the father’s business affairs.

6 The father worked in the steel and hardware partnership business founded in
1941 by Lim Hong Choon (the parties’ paternal grandfather), Lim Boon Wan and
Lim Boon Kee (the parties’ paternal granduncles).[note: 2] In that partnership
business, the father worked alongside his uncles and other male members of the
extended Lim family. He eventually took over his own father’s role and
position in that business as well as other family businesses (together
referred to as “the extended family business”). By the time the partnership
was converted into a private limited company called Hup Seng Huat Co (Pte) Ltd
(“Hup Seng Huat”) in 1973, Lim Boon Wan was the only surviving founding
partner. Prior to the father’s demise on 23 August 1983, the father was the
Managing Director and a significant shareholder of Hup Seng Huat.

7 The extended Lim family owned, amongst other businesses, several companies.
I will only mention those companies that featured in this action. They are (i)
Hup Seng Huat, (ii) Eastern Win Metals & Machinery Pte Ltd (“Eastern Win”),
and (iii) Thong Seng Metal Pte Ltd (“TSM”). The extended Lim family together
with an unrelated family also had interests in a steel hardware company known
as Hoe Hup Seng Hardware Company (Private) Ltd (“HHS”).

8 Following the father’s death, Lim Boon Wan’s son was appointed the Managing
Director of Hup Seng Huat. Almost 10 years after the father’s death, Hup Seng
Huat was converted into a public limited company and changed its name to “Hup
Seng Huat Co Ltd” in January 1994. The latter company was listed on the
Singapore Stock Exchange Main Board on 4 February 1994. At the time of
listing, D1 was the Deputy Managing Director of Hup Seng Huat.

9 Not everyone in the extended Lim family had an equal share in the extended
family business. It is clear that only the male members were shareholders and
hold directorships in the group of companies that made up the extended family
business. This situation was a well-known fact within the extended Lim
family.[note: 3] Hence, the pervasive understanding in the family was that the
father would pass his interests in the extended family business to the sons
(_ie_ , the defendants).[note: 4]

10 As head of the household, the father made all the important decisions for
the family.[note: 5] The father knew of the importance of education and wanted
his sons and daughter to be educated.[note: 6] At the time the father passed
away, D1 was 24 years old and an undergraduate student at the National
University of Singapore. He subsequently graduated with a degree in Estate
Management. D2 was 23 years old when the father passed away. He left home for
his studies overseas in September 1981 at the age of 22. He completed his
undergraduate and graduate studies, before obtaining a doctorate in New York.
He returned home in late 1989.

11 The plaintiff acknowledged that the family’s expectation of her as the
daughter was to have a “good education, find a good man, get married and have
children”.[note: 7] During the period 1981 to 1986, the plaintiff studied in
Hawaii where she obtained her first and graduate degrees before returning to
Singapore. The plaintiff was 22 years old when the father passed away.

12 Following the father’s death, D1 took up the role of his father in the
family and in the extended family business. He provided for the upkeep of the
family home, his mother and siblings. He saw to it that his siblings’ studies
in tertiary institutions overseas were not disrupted by their father’s demise.
D1’s evidence is that he did his best to maintain the family in which he had
become the head after the father’s death. The plaintiff accepted that it was
the father’s intention that D1 would take over the father’s role at home and
in the extended family business.[note: 8] According to her, she had every
reason to trust D1 seeing that D1 would take up the responsibility of
providing for the family.

The defendants’ involvement in the extended family business

13 During his lifetime, initially the father did not get his sons fully
involved in the extended family business. However, in 1981 or 1982, he started
to introduce D1 to the business by having D1 accompany him to work, attend
functions and meetings, including overseas travels to meet business
associates.[note: 9]

14 In 1981, the father transferred 2,000 shares in HHS to D1 who was also made
a director of HHS. As a director, D1 gave personal guarantees to banks to
secure the borrowings of HHS.

15 Further, on 8 June 1981, D1 was appointed a director of Lim Tian Siong
Enterprise Pte Ltd (“LTSE”). LTSE was incorporated by the father on 12 May
1978 and, as can be seen below, it functioned as an investment holding
company. Two LTSE shares were issued at the time of incorporation: one
subscription share was issued to the father (“the Father’s LTSE Share”) and
the other was issued to the mother (“the Mother’s LTSE Share”). The two
subscribers were the only directors of LTSE. Subsequently, the defendants were
allotted shares of $1 each for cash at par: on 9 July 1982 (allotment of one
share each) and then on 16 July 1983 (allotment of two shares each).
Therefore, on 16 July 1983, the brothers held three shares each and the
parents held one share each in LTSE. I should mention that LTSE was eventually
struck off as a registered entity in April 2006.

16 As mentioned in [12] above, following the father’s death, D1 took up the
role of his father in the family and in the extended family business. Even
till today, the defendants continue to remain involved in the extended family
business.

Father’s estate

Events prior to the father’s demise

17 The father was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in the late 1970’s. He died
intestate on 23 August 1983.

18 Between 1981 and 1983, the father did the following things:

(i) As mentioned in [14], the father transferred his 2,000 shares in HHS to D1
in 1981.

(ii) In January 1983, the father sold two blocks of shares in Eastern Win,
namely, 45,000 shares to a third party and 35,000 shares to Hup Seng Huat at
$1 per share.

(iii) By July 1983, the father sold to LTSE (i) most of the father’s remaining
shares in Eastern Win, TSM and Hup Seng Huat, and (ii) all the shares he held
in other private and publicly quoted companies. It was in this sense that LTSE
was used as an investment holding company for the father’s substantial
shareholdings. As a result of the sales enumerated above, LTSE owed the
father’s estate $1,521,424.57.

19 At this juncture, I should mention again that the defendants were each
allotted three LTSE shares at $1 per share and the allotments in 1982 and 1983
respectively were less than five years before the father passed away (see [15]
above).

20 The father also owned two immoveable properties which he held as joint
tenants with the mother: one at Puay Hee Avenue (“the Puay Hee Property”), and
one at Tyrwhitt Road (“the Tyrwhitt Property”).

21 At the time of his death, the father’s estate held, _inter alia_ , the
following shares:

(i) one Hup Seng Huat share (although following a subsequent bonus share
issue, his estate eventually held 200 Hup Seng Huat shares);

(ii) one Eastern Win share;

(iii) one TSM share; and

(iv) the Father’s LTSE Share.

22 With the father’s death, the mother, as the surviving joint tenant, became
the sole owner of both the Puay Hee Property and the Tyrwhitt Property.

Administration of the father’s estate

23 D1 and his mother were the administrator and administratrix respectively of
the father’s estate.

24 Shortly after the father passed away, D1 and his mother engaged M/s Wee Tin
Teck & Co (“WTT”), a firm of solicitors, to act in connection with the
administration of the father’s estate. Sometime after 8 July 1987, Ng Lee &
Associates, a firm of accountants, was appointed to assist in the valuation of
Hup Seng Huat and LTSE for estate duty purposes. Later on Ng Lee & Associates
later changed its name to Ng, Lee & Associates DFK.

25 Although the petition for the Letters of Administration was granted in
August 1984, the grant of the Letters of Administration was only extracted in
September 1991 after estate duty was assessed and paid. All in all, it took
approximately seven years to administer the father’s estate.

26 On 25 March 1991, the Commissioner for Estate Duties (“the Commissioner”)
provided his assessment of the estate duty payable on the father’s dutiable
estate as returned for estate duty purposes. The schedule of assets for the
father’s estate (“the Father’s Schedule of Assets”) used by the Commissioner
for estate duty purposes is produced below:

27 The prolonged and meandering correspondences between the Commissioner and
WTT revealed that for estate duty the Commissioner considered the father to
have sold 599 TSM shares and 4,799 Hup Seng Huat shares to LTSE (see [18(iii)]
above) at undervalue. This was because the father sold those shares to LTSE at
$100 per share whereas the Commissioner assessed the true value of one TSM
share to be $118.71 and one Hup Seng Huat share to be $380.29 (after
Commissioner’s discount).[note: 10] As a result, the “inadequate
consideration” for estate duty purposes was as follows:

(i) $11,207.29 (599 x $[118.71-100]) for the TSM shares; and

(ii) $1,345,111.71 (4,799 X $[380.29-100]) for the Hup Seng Huat shares.[note:
11]

I pause here to mention that for estate duty purposes, the “inadequate
consideration” was deemed to be an _inter vivos_ gift from the father to LTSE
(see item (I)(2)(aa) and (I)(2)(bb) in the Father’s Schedule of Assets at [26]
above) on which estate duty was payable. I shall return to this matter later
in my judgment when I discuss the law on the estate duty issues.

28 The estate duty came up to a total sum of $2,461,893.01 ($1,904,603.62 and
interest of $557,289.39). D1 explained that the estate duty was discharged in
the following manner:

(i) $138,434.30 was paid by D1;

(ii) $110,464.30 was paid by D2;

(iii) $1,902,550.59 was paid by LTSE; and

(iv) $310,443.82 was paid out of funds from the father’s estate.

29 D1 said that both administrators treated LTSE’s payment of $1,902,550.59
towards estate duty as:

(i) settlement of the debt of $1,521,424.57 owed by LTSE to the father’s
estate[note: 12] (see [18(iii)] above); and

(ii) additional payment of $381,126.02 by LTSE (see [28] above).

However, it was more accurate to say that the father’s estate effectively paid
a total sum of $1,831,868.39 ($310,443.82 directly plus $1,521,424.57
indirectly _via_ LTSE) and that LTSE effectively paid $381,126.02 towards the
discharge of estate duty. The sum of $310,443.82 paid directly by the father’s
estate came from the cash available in the father’s estate and cash proceeds
from the sale of the distributable assets (other than the shares) listed in
the Father’s Schedule of Assets at [26] above.

30 After estate duty was paid and the grant of Letters of Administration was
extracted, the shares in Eastern Win, Hup Seng Huat and TSM (see [21] above)
were transferred to LTSE. According to D1, this was done to partially
reimburse LTSE for its payments towards the discharge of estate duty over and
above the sum of $1,521,424.57 it owed to the father’s estate (_ie_
$381,126.02). The correctness of D1’s explanation is an issue for
determination in this case. I shall return to this point later in my judgment
(see [115] below).

31 Following the share transfers mentioned in [30] above, the only remaining
asset in the father’s estate was the Father’s LTSE Share. Under the law of
intestacy, the mother was entitled to a half share in the Father’s LTSE share
and the other half share was to be shared equally amongst the three children.
In other words, the plaintiff, D1 and D2 were entitled to a one-sixth share
each in the Father’s LTSE Share.

Plaintiff’s allegations in relation to the father’s estate

32 At this point, it is useful to briefly mention in broad outline what the
plaintiff takes issue with in relation to the administration of the father’s
estate:

(i) First, she says the Father’s Schedule of Assets did not reflect the “true
value” of the estate which ought to be $7,500,929.04 and not the stated sum of
$4,218,037.03. According to her, part of this discrepancy was due to the non-
disclosure of assets including the under valuation of disclosed assets to the
Commissioner.[note: 13]

(ii) Second, she says that estate duty that was paid in respect of the _inter
vivos_ gifts should have been borne by the donees instead of the estate and
that this diminished the value of the father’s residual estate.

(iii) Third, she says that interest charge was unnecessarily incurred on the
estate duty payable.

(iv) Fourth, she says the transfer of her one-sixth interest in the Father’s
LTSE share to D2 was obtained fraudulently when she was misled and induced
into signing a letter of consent dated 18 March 1992 (“the Letter of
Consent”)(see [53] below).

33 The plaintiff claims that D1 administered the father’s estate negligently
and dishonestly, in breach of trust and in breach of fiduciary duty owed to
the plaintiff.[note: 14] The charges against D1 were mainly in the nature of
omissions. I also mention here, for the sake of completeness, that it is not
the plaintiff’s pleaded case that D2 should be jointly liable with the D1 as
an executor _de son tort_ because he had meddled or been involved in the
administration of the father’s estate.

Mother’s estate

The mother’s Will

34 The mother was diagnosed with cancer in January 1989.

35 On 16 March 1990, prior to the grant of the Letters of Administration of
the father’s estate, the mother made her Will. She named the plaintiff and D2
as her executrix and executor respectively. By her Will, the mother made the
following bequeaths:[note: 15]

(i) the Puay Hee Property was bequeathed to the plaintiff with all estate duty
payable out of the residuary estate;

(ii) the Tyrwhitt Property was bequeathed to the defendants in equal shares
with all estate duty payable out of the residuary estate;

(iii) the Mother’s LTSE Share and her half share in the Father’s LTSE Share
were to be given in equal shares to the defendants;

(iv) the mother’s jewellery, gold coins and other ornaments were to be given
to the plaintiff; and

(v) the mother’s entire credit balance in two joint POSB accounts and one
joint Tat Lee Bank account with one of her children, CPF monies and all other
residual assets were to be given in equal shares to the parties.

36 Even though the mother’s Will dealt with the Mother’s LTSE Share and her
half share in the Father’s LTSE Share, the mother subsequently went on to deal
with these shares before her demise. I shall describe these events in greater
detail under the heading “The transfers of two LTSE shares to the defendants
in 1992” (see [52] below).

Administration of the mother’s estate

37 The mother died on 26 July 1992.

38 Following her death, D1 believing that the mother died intestate instructed
Messrs Yap & Leong (“Y&L”), a firm of solicitors, to obtain Letters of
Administration in respect of the mother’s estate. At the time Y&L were
instructed, D1 did not know that the mother had made a Will.

39 Subsequently, the Will came to light at a meeting at the offices of Y&L to
discuss the mother’s estate matters. At this meeting, the plaintiff produced
the mother’s Will. However, the parties agreed amongst themselves to
administer the mother’s estate as if she had died intestate. They also agreed
that they would not distribute the mother’s assets in accordance with the
Will.

40 On 9 January 1993, the plaintiff and D2 filed a petition for the grant of
Letters of Administration in the mother’s estate.[note: 16] In the process,
the plaintiff and D2 declared to the court that the mother had died intestate
(when she did not). This petition was accompanied by an affidavit from the
plaintiff and D2 affirming that the contents of the petition were to the best
of their knowledge and belief in all respects true (when they were not).[note:
17] In short, the plaintiff and D2 lied to the court. I shall return to this
falsehood later on in my judgment (see [145] below).

41 Over the course of the administration of the mother’s estate, Y&L
corresponded with the Commissioner on behalf of the plaintiff and D2 as the
administratrix and administrator respectively. During this time, the plaintiff
and D2 both resided at the Puay Hee Property.

42 By a letter dated 16 November 1992, the Commissioner wrote to Y&L with a
number of questions relating to the administration of the father’s estate. By
a letter dated 22 March 1993 to the Commissioner, Y&L provided a copy of the
Father’s Schedule of Assets which showed that the Commissioner had valued each
LTSE share at $337,674.99 for the purposes of calculating the estate duty
payable on the father’s estate. A copy of this letter was sent to the
plaintiff and D2 at the Puay Hee Property.

43 By a letter dated 6 September 1993, the Commissioner set out his
computation of the estate duty payable on the mother’s estate. The computation
showed that the Commissioner had valued each LTSE share at a lower figure of
$224,185.25 for this purpose. A copy of this letter was sent to the plaintiff
and D2 at the Puay Hee Property.

44 On 22 September 1993, Y&L sent the Commissioner an amended estate duty
affidavit duly signed by the plaintiff and D2 that adopted this lower value of
one LTSE share. On 7 October 1993, the Commissioner provided his assessment of
the estate duty payable on the mother’s estate based on the following the
schedule of assets (“the Mother’s Schedule of Assets”):

Estate of Goh Choon Eng Deceased  
---  
1 United Overseas Bank Ltd, MacPherson Branch Fixed Deposit Account No. XXX |  $5,600.49  
2 Cash in hand (withdrawals from Tat Lee Bank Limited Savings Account No. XXX on 24.6.92 and Standard Chartered Bank Fixed Deposit Account XXX on 25.6.92) |  265,686.56  
3 Credit balance with [LTSE] |  14,603.86  
4 [The Tyrwhitt Property] |  600,000.00

7 Central Provident Fund Balance |  99,039.78  
8 Gift of 1 share in [LTSE] to Mr Lim Boh Chuan |  224,185.25  
9 Gift of 1 share in [LTSE] belonging to the Estate of Lim TianSiong deceased to Mr Lim Puay Koon Deceased’s half share in the Estate ($224,185.25 x ½) |  112,092.63  
|  $1,351,208.57  
Deduct Exemption under Section 14(3)(b) |  500,000.00  
|  **$851,208.57**  
  
  

45 The grant of the Letters of Administration in relation to the mother’s
estate was extracted on 16 March 1994 following the payment of the estate duty
to the Commissioner.[note: 18]

Deed of Family Arrangement

46 The parties entered into the Deed of Family Arrangement dated 11 April 1994
(“the DFA”) to distribute the assets disclosed in the Mother’s Schedule of
Assets. It is not disputed that the DFA neither followed closely the terms of
the Will nor intestate succession law. Under the DFA:

(i) the Puay Hee Property was transferred to the plaintiff;

(ii) the Tyrwhitt Property was transferred to the defendants in equal shares;
and

(iii) the movable assets (item nos 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of the Mother’s Schedule
of Assets (see [44] above)) were transferred to the defendants in equal shares
“by way of parity of exchange”.

47 It was not disputed that about the time the DFA was entered into the Puay
Hee Property was worth much more than the Tyrwhitt Property. For this reason,
the rest of the movable assets in the Mother’s Schedule of Assets were
transferred to the defendants to “top up” each defendant’s share of the
mother’s estate to achieve and give effect to a “parity of exchange”.

48 In the course of administration of the mother’s estate as an intestate
estate, certain assets that was itemized in the Will - the mother’s jewellery
and the two POSB Joint Accounts (which had a total balance of $191,418.20)
(see [35(v)] above) \- were not disclosed to the Commissioner. Consequently,
they were not taken into account for the purposes of assessing estate duty.

49 I should point out that before the mother died, her POSB joint account with
the plaintiff, POSB joint account with D1 and Tat Lee Bank joint account with
D1 were all closed after withdrawals of the account balances. The amounts
withdrawn total $435,966.78. The siblings thereafter distributed the
withdrawals amongst themselves. Each sibling took $100,000 and the balance sum
of $135,965.73 was deposited in a joint account of the defendants for expenses
such as the mother’s medical bills and household expenses.[note: 19]

Plaintiff’s allegations in relation to the mother's estate

50 This is an appropriate juncture to mention what the plaintiff takes issue
with in relation to the administration of the mother’s estate. To be clear, it
is not her case that she was persuaded to execute the DFA under the undue
influence of the defendants and that it should be set aside. Rather, the logic
of the plaintiff’s case appears to be as follows:

(i) She had executed the DFA in the belief that there would be “parity of
exchange” in the way the assets of the mother’s estate were divided amongst
the siblings.

(ii) While there was “parity of exchange” amongst the parties on the face of
the DFA, there was in reality no “parity of exchange”. This was because the
total amount of assets available for distribution under the mother’s estate
was reduced by reason of the following matters:

(a) D1's breaches of his duties as an administrator of the father’s estate;
and

(b) the defendants’ fraudulent misrepresentations _viz_ the value of the
Father’s LTSE Share and the Mother’s LTSE Share (see the heading “The
transfers of two LTSE shares to the defendants in 1992” below).[note: 20]

(iii) The plaintiff would have received substantially more assets under the
DFA by way of “parity of exchange” but for the wrongdoings of the
defendants.[note: 21]

(iv) The plaintiff is not seeking to set aside the DFA. Rather, she is seeking
to enforce the DFA by “taking into account the spirit in which the document
was entered into, to ensure that the true value of the mother’s estate is
[being] divided equally among the Plaintiff and the Defendants”.[note: 22]

(v) Both defendants should therefore “account” for the mother’s estate on the
basis that each party would obtain an equal share of the mother’s estate. In
other words, the plaintiff wants the defendants to account for the mother’s
estate as if the mother had died intestate _and_ her estate included:

(a) assets which would have flowed into the mother’s estate from the father’s
estate but for D1’s breaches of his duties as administrator of the father’s
estate; and

(b) the Mother’s LTSE Share and the mother’s half share in the Father’s LTSE
Share.

51 The plaintiff stated in her Closing Submissions that “the DFA must be read
with the Letter of Consent and the manner in which the father’s estate was
administered.”[note: 23] Furthermore, D1 had taken on the role of
administering the mother’s estate and should be jointly liable with D2 as an
executor _de son tort_. The plaintiff proclaimed the DFA as the defendants’
“last step … to secure the bulk of the residue of their parents’ estate for
themselves to the [plaintiff’s] detriment.”[note: 24]

The transfers of two LTSE shares to the defendants in 1992

52 Two events of significance to this action were the transfers of the
Father’s LTSE Share and the Mother’s LTSE Share to D2 and D1 respectively.
With the completion of these transfers, the defendants became the only two
shareholders of LTSE and held four LTSE shares each. The significance of the
LTSE shares is that LTSE owned shares in Hup Seng Huat.[note: 25]

First Transfer of the Father's LTSE Share

53 As stated in [31] above, the mother was entitled to half-share in the
Father’s LTSE share and the plaintiff, D1 and D2 were entitled to one-sixth
share each. By the Letter of Consent, the mother, the plaintiff and D1 agreed
to transfer their respective interests in the Father’s LTSE Share to D2 free
of consideration. The Letter of Consent which was drafted by the company
secretarial services of Ng, Lee & Associates read as follows:[note: 26]

We, the undersigned, all being the lawful beneficiaries of the Estate of [the
father], deceased who died intestate on the 23rd day of August 1983, hereby
consent to transfer our share of entitlements in the one (1) ordinary share of
S$1.00 fully paid in Lim Tian Siong Enterprise Pte Ltd registered under the
name of the Estate of [the father], deceased to [D2] and free of any
consideration with effect from the 18th day of March 1992.

54 On the same day, the mother, the plaintiff and D1 signed a letter addressed
to the directors of LTSE requesting the registration of the Father’s LTSE
Share in D2's name (“the Request Form”).[note: 27] The Request Form read as
follows:

The Directors of [LTSE]

We, the undersigned, being all the lawful beneficiaries of the estate of [the
father], deceased who died intestate on the 23rd day of August 1983, hereby
apply for [D2] ... to be registered as a shareholder of [LTSE] in respect of
one (1) ordinary share of $1.00 fully paid in the said company now registered
in the name of the said deceased. ...

55 Accordingly, the Father’s LTSE Share was duly transferred to D2. I shall
refer to the Letter of Consent and the Request Form collectively as the “First
Transfer Documents”.

Second Transfer of Mother’s LTSE Share

56 The second transfer concerned the Mother’s LTSE Share. On 23 June 1992, the
mother signed a transfer form (“the Second Transfer Form”) to transfer her one
LTSE share registered in her name to D1 for $1.[note: 28] Accordingly, the
Mother’s LTSE Share was duly transferred to D1’s.

Plaintiff's allegations in relation to the transfers

57 It is now a convenient juncture to mention what the plaintiff takes issue
with in relation to the two transfers described above. The plaintiff's
allegations in relation to the transfers are based on fraudulent
misrepresentation as to the value of the Father’s LTSE Share and Mother’s LTSE
Share. Her pleaded averments are as follows:[note: 29]

By their conduct, [D1] and [D2]:

(a) fraudulently misrepresented the true value of the said one share of the
estate of [the father] and the one share that belonged to [the mother] in
LTSE;

(b) fraudulently drew up the Letter of Consent on 18th March 1992 and
misrepresented to [the mother] and the Plaintiff the true value of the one
share of the estate of [the father];

(c) [D1] (Administrator) deliberately did not disclose the accounts of the
[father’s] estate and [D1] and [D2] fraudulently misrepresented the true value
of the one share owned by [the mother] in LTSE and effected the transfer on
23rd June 1992 to [D1] deliberately to perpetuate such fraud;

(d) fraudulently did not disclose the true value of the one share and
transferred the 2 said shares (one share in LTSE owned by [the mother] and one
share in LTSE owned by the estate of [the father] in which both [the mother]
and the Plaintiff had an interest) at the value of $1.00 each to themselves,
thereby benefiting themselves.

58 Apart from the above pleadings, the plaintiff did not plead that D1 was
liable for equitable compensation because he had caused her loss by breaching
his fiduciary duty as an administrator of the father’s estate. I will be
discussing this aspect of the pleaded case in due course (see [138] below).

59 There is no dispute that the mother, D1 and the plaintiff signed the First
Transfer Documents to transfer their respective entitlements in the Father’s
LTSE Share to D2. The plaintiff’s case at the trial is that she and her mother
signed the First Transfer Documents having been misled by D2 who told her and
the mother that the Father’s LTSE Share was worth $1. The mother was also
misled into signing the Second Transfer Form.

60 According to the plaintiff, she and her mother were misled by the
defendants. Had they not been misled, the mother’s estate would also have one
and a half LTSE shares available for distribution (_ie_ , the Mother’s LTSE
Share and the mother’s half share of the Father’s LTSE Share). Accordingly,
the plaintiff would have been entitled to a one-third share of the one and a
half LTSE shares under the law of intestacy. I note that despite basing her
claim on fraudulent misrepresentation, the plaintiff is not seeking damages
against the defendants nor is she seeking to disavow and set aside the First
Transfer Documents or the Second Transfer Form. Instead, she seeks to enforce
the DFA to acquire the “parity of exchange” agreed upon in the DFA for which
she did not receive.

Circumstances leading to this action

The China Party Action

61 In 2008, two nationals from the People’s Republic of China commenced
proceedings _vide_ Suit No 455 of 2008 against the siblings, alleging to be
relatives with a claim to their inheritance under the father's estate (“the
China Party Action”). The plaintiff says that the first time she saw documents
relating to the father’s estate was in the China Party Action.[note: 30] Prior
to that, neither the mother (as co-administratrix of the father’s estate) nor
D1 had provided her with a complete set of accounts concerning the
administration of the father’s estate. She maintains that it was also during
the China Party Action that she discovered that Hup Seng Huat had grown from
strength to strength between 1983 and 1993, and that her one-sixth entitlement
in her father's estate turned out to be worth a substantial amount of money.
This led to a general lack of trust of her siblings. As she had not received
any distribution from the father’s estate, the plaintiff began to wonder
whether the defendants had accounted for all the assets in both estates.

62 In light of this, she began asking for an account of the father’s estate.
On 12 June 2009, she wrote to D1 seeking a return of all that was due to her
under the parents’ estates. D2 was copied in this letter. However, she decided
not to take any action against them while the China Party Action was still on-
going.

63 The China Party Action was eventually dismissed in March 2010.

Accounts of the father’s estate

64 On 18 October 2010, the plaintiff wrote to D1 as a follow up to her 12 June
2009 letter. D2 was again copied in this letter. In order to appease the
plaintiff, DFK Singapore Corporate Services Pte Ltd was instructed to prepare
a Statement of Account of Administration (“the DFK Accounts”). The plaintiff
was sent the DFK Accounts on 11 January 2011. The DFK Accounts showed that
there was a deficiency in the father’s estate of $581,085.24 such that there
was nothing left in the estate to distribute to the plaintiff.

The current proceedings

65 The DFK Accounts did not satisfy the plaintiff. She had some serious
concerns that the DFK Accounts were incomplete and incorrect. Following
unsuccessful settlement negotiations, the plaintiff commenced the present
action on 3 January 2012.

66 The plaintiff was certain that had the father’s estate been administered
honestly and correctly, there would have been surplus assets remaining in the
father’s residual estate for distribution to the plaintiff and her mother. In
her pleadings, the plaintiff stated that she was deceived and hence deprived
of her actual entitlement in both estates, and that her losses could only be
ascertained after the defendants have furnished proper accounts for both
estates.[note: 31] As such, the plaintiff sought, _inter alia_ , the following
remedies:[note: 32]

(i) an account of the two estates (the father’s and mother’s) showing the
“true values” of the assets of the two estates including the assets that were
given or transferred by the father within five years of his death and the
names of the donees of such gifts;

(ii) liberty to falsify or surcharge the accounts; and

(iii) upon taking such accounts, if the defendants are found to be liable,
payment to the plaintiff of her due share less what she had already received
from the two estates.

67 As can be seen from the entire narrative above, the allegations of breach
of fiduciary duty, breach of trust and fraudulent misrepresentation fall into
three separate claims:

(i) claims against D1 in relation to his administration of the father’s
estate;

(ii) claims against the defendants in relation to the Father’s LTSE Share and
the Mother’s LTSE Share; and

(iii) claims against the defendants in relation to the mother’s estate.

Expert witnesses

68 Before proceeding further, I turn briefly to consider the state of the
expert evidence since the plaintiff relied almost entirely on her expert’s
evidence to prove the “true value” of the assets forming part of the father’s
estate and to falsify and surcharge the DFK Accounts.

69 The plaintiff's expert witness, Mr Kaka Singh, is a partner in RSM Chio Lim
LLP. He is not an estate duty or tax planning expert. Instead, he is an
auditor with 40 years of experience. Mr Kaka Singh was instructed to carry out
a fact finding exercise in relation to the parents’ estates based on documents
given by the defendants in the course of discovery. Mr Kaka Singh’s report,
amongst other things, sought to:

(i) assess the accuracy of the Father’s Schedule of Assets (on which the DFK
Accounts were based);

(ii) ascribe fair values to assets comprised in the father’s estate; and

(iii) establish the true residual value of the father’s estate after the
payment of expenses such as estate duty.

70 In his report, Mr Kaka Singh opined that:

(i) The “true value” of the father’s estate was $7,500,929.04 (as opposed to
$4,218,037.03 as stated in the Father’s Schedule of Assets). In arriving at
this higher value, Mr Kaka Singh concluded that several of the transfers made
by the father prior to his demise were done by way of a sale rather than a
gift.

(ii) The “true” residual value of the father’s estate was $4,411,092.64.

(iii) The plaintiff’s entitlement to the father’s estate was $735,182.10.

(iv) The mother’s entitlement to the father’s estate was $2,127,393.28 (after
deducting her share of estate duty and interest).[note: 33]

Mr Kaka Singh confirmed in cross-examination that his calculations and the
numbers in his report were also premised on the donees of _inter vivos_ gifts
bearing his or her share of the estate duty on a pro-rata basis.[note: 34]

71 Not surprisingly, the defendants strenuously challenged Mr Kaka Singh’s
report. The defendants called Mr Timothy Reid (“Mr Reid”), a director from
Ferrier Hodgson Pte Ltd, as their expert witness. Mr Reid's report was being
relied upon to critique and comment on the calculations, numbers and
conclusions in Mr Kaka Singh’s report. The defendants’ point is that the
figures mentioned in [70] above are a fallacy. For instance, the allegation
that the plaintiff was entitled to $735,182.10 was based on the father’s
estate having a value of $7,500,929.04 when the declared value of the estate
in the Father’s Schedule of Assets was actually $4,218,037.03. Furthermore,
although the plaintiff relied on the father’s estate having a value of
$7,500,929.04, in calculating the requisite estate duty payable, she did not
take the figure of $7,500,929.04, but instead used the lower figure of
$4,218.037.03 (which was also the actual figure used by the
Commissioner).[note: 35] This “obvious mismatch” was pointed out in Mr Reid’s
report.[note: 36]

72 The defendants accused Mr Kaka Singh of making sweeping assumptions in his
report. Counsel for the defendants, Mr Davinder Singh SC (“Mr Singh SC”),
grilled the witness on his report, in particular the basis of his computations
and the numbers he had used including his conclusions. He was also cross-
examined on his arbitrary basis for treating the disposal of assets by the
father as either a gift or sale. One example of this can be seen in the cross-
examination of Mr Kaka Singh in respect of his treatment of the 2,000 HHS
shares to D1 (referred to in [14] and [18(i)] above):[note: 37]

Q:Have you seen any documents to show that it was a gift?

A:No.

Q:So in the absence of documents showing either a purchase or a gift why have
you, in your report, chosen to assume one against the other?

A:We had instructions that the documents are to be made available by the
defendants.

Q:Yes, but at this time they were not available?

A:Yes.

Q:And you had not seen them. So you’ve told us that at this time, you had not
seen whether it was a gift and you had not seen whether it was a purchase. My
question again is, why did you pick a purchase over a gift when you couldn’t
have known whether it was one or the other?

A:We asked for the documents and there were no documents available.

Q:Yes?

A:Yes.

Q:Either way, right?

A:Yes.

Q:So why did you pick one over the other?

A:Well, unless the documents are made available to us to show to the contrary,
we took this position.

Q:Yes. Let me understand the implications of taking that position.

A:Yes.

Q:You have said that it was … you have assumed that it was a purchase and you
have assumed a price of $1.8 million; correct?

A:Yes.

Q:By making that assumption that it was a purchase for 1.8 million, the effect
of that was to increase the value of the estate by 1.8 million; correct?

A:Yes.

Q:The effect of that also was to increase the distributable assets by 1.8
million less the requisite estate duty; correct?

A:Correct.

Q:And the implication of that would be to increase the residual value for the
beneficiaries, including your client; correct?

A:Unless it’s a gift.

Q:The answer is “yes’, right?

A:Yes.

Q:So in the absence of any documents either way, you have, on the basis of an
assumption, labelled this as a sale and purchase at $1.8 million, with the
effect that your client will get more, yes?

A:That’s the table I prepared based … on that basis, yes.

73 Where Mr Kaka Singh had in his report classified a particular transaction
as a sale, he would attribute the full market value of the asset to the
father’s estate. If the transaction had been classified as an _inter vivos_
gift within five years of the father’s death, he would attribute the amount of
estate duty payable to the donee and not to the estate. That is not the end of
the matter. The defendants pointed out that Mr Kaka Singh in his report had
conflated (i) assets that ought to be included in the father’s asset base for
the purposes of assessing estate duty with (ii) assets from the father’s
estate that were available for the purposes of distribution. By doing so, Mr
Kaka Singh inflated the value of the father’s estate in order to shore up the
plaintiff’s case.

74 Mr Kaka Singh’s report and the defendants’ criticisms will be discussed in
detail under the heading “Analysis and Decision” below.

Analysis and Decision

(1) Claims in relation to the father’s estate

75 As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff had some serious concerns about the DFK
Accounts[note: 38], and relying on Mr Kaka Singh’s report, she argued that the
DFK Accounts were incomplete and incorrect for several reasons:

(i) First, the consideration for the transfer of 2,000 HHS shares to D1 was
not accounted for.

(ii) Second, the consideration for the allotment of the six shares in LTSE to
the defendants was not accounted for.

(iii) Third, not all the consideration for the transfer of Hup Seng Huat
shares to LTSE was accounted for.

(iv) Fourth, the father’s investments in a company called International Trust
& Finance Co Ltd (“International Finance”) and a Taiwanese company called
Brilliant Development Pte Ltd (“Brilliant Development”) were not accounted
for.

(v) Fifth, D1 had acted negligently in allowing a large amount of interest to
accrue on the estate duty payable and that the pro-rata amount of estate duty
that D1 should have recouped from donees of _inter vivos_ gifts was not
accounted for.

(vi) Sixth, the transfer of one share in (i) Hup Seng Huat (ii) Eastern Win
and (iii) TSM to LTSE were not with the consent of the beneficiaries and the
consideration was not accounted for.

76 I shall deal with each of these in turn. These omissions, so the argument
developed, resulted in a misleading picture of the residual value of the
father’s estate in the DFK Accounts.

(a) 2,000 HHS shares

77 Based on Mr Kaka Singh’s report, the plaintiff claims that the 2,000 HHS
shares were a transfer from the father to D1, and that the latter owed the
father’s estate $1,848,040 for those shares.[note: 39] As a result of the
failure to account for this $1,848,040, the plaintiff claims that the father’s
residual estate was reduced to her detriment. Interestingly, the plaintiff in
her Closing Submissions treated the transfer of 2,000 HHS shares as a “gift”
and her complaint was that it was not disclosed to the Commissioner.[note: 40]
This contention of a “gift” is not supported by her expert who had not seen
documentary evidence of a sale at $1,848,040 (see [72] above). Equally, Mr
Kaka Singh accepted in cross-examination that there would not be a sale of
shares at $1,848,040 if the purchaser had not agreed to buy at that
price.[note: 41]

78 Whilst D1 acknowledged that the HHS shares were not gifts, D1’s evidence is
that there was no agreement to buy the HHS shares at $1,848,040 as alleged. It
was never the intention of the father to sell his HHS shares for $1,848,040 or
for D1 to buy them at that price. At the material time, D1 was only 22 years
old. Instead, the transfer of the HHS shares to D1 was part of a “packaged
deal” whereby he gave valuable consideration for the shares by taking up his
father’s place as a director in HHS and, D1 became a personal guarantor of HHS
in lieu of his father (see [14] above). To support his contention, D1 produced
some documentary evidence of the personal guarantees given by him after he
became a shareholder in HHS. D1 explained that, given the passage of time, he
could only find some but not all documentary evidence of personal guarantees
furnished by him.

79 In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I accept D1’s testimony
that he had given valuable consideration for the HHS shares through the
provision of personal guarantees. I therefore find and hold that the transfer
of the 2,000 HHS shares did not lead to any distributable value in the
father’s estate in which D1 had to account to the beneficiaries of the
father’s estate.

(b) The six LTSE shares allotted to the defendants within five years of the
father’s death

80 The plaintiff claims, relying on Mr Kaka Singh’s report, that the six LTSE
shares allotted to the defendants for $1 each within five years of the
father’s death was not a gift from the father. On that basis, she argues that
D1 failed to account for the difference between the fair value of these shares
and the actual purchase price of the shares (_ie_ , $1 per share). Therefore,
the defendants would have owed the father’s estate $1,311,102.51 (from the
sale of six shares)[note: 42] and that this amount would have been available
for distribution.

81 Under cross-examination, Mr Kaka Singh deviated from the position taken in
his report. He acknowledged that the six LTSE shares were gifts from the
father.[note: 43] But when pressed as to why he did not take out the value of
the shares from the list of distributable assets, he claimed that he had made
a mistake when he told the court that the six shares were gifts.[note: 44] Not
satisfied with the explanation of a mistake, Mr Singh SC pressed Mr Kaka Singh
on the matter:

Q:[B]ut the whole premise of your case, on your evidence on the stand, is that
the father effectively made a gift within five years of his death. So if it
was a gift, then how is it that you have not taken it out of the distributable
assets?

A:I have taken the view that it was not a gift,

Q:But on the stand, you have told us that it is a gift?

A:I might have got it wrongly. For estate duty purposes, it’s back-to-back but
it’s not a gift for estate duty purposes.

Q:But [Mr Kaka] Singh, that’s where we are having some difficulty. Your whole
thesis was that by issuing shares in the way in which he did so, the father
was transferring value to the children.

A:Yes.

Q:And so if that was a transfer of value, how is it that it’s not taken out of
the distributable assets; a transfer of value done within five years?

A:I took the view that there was a reply to the Commissioner that they paid
for these shares.

Q:They paid $1, … you see, [Mr Kaka Singh], the difficulty is this: your
evidence is only relevant because you are saying that when they paid $1, they
effectively got 1.6m and the difference, therefore, was a gift by the father.

…

Q:So if your evidence is that he gave away value of 1.6m, why is it not taken
out of the distributable assets? Let me put it another way to make it easier.
If, according to your evidence, it was given away, it should be removed from
the distributable assets as well as the residual value; correct?

A:No, that’s not what I said or meant, okay. For estate duty purposes, he gave
away this amount and then for distribution purposes, this was not a gift.

Q:Mr [Kaka] Singh, could you answer my question. If, to use your own words, it
was given away by the father, then it should be removed from the distributable
assets and from the residual value; correct?

A:Unless it’s a gift.

Q:If it is a gift, yes?

A:Yes, only if it’s a gift, yes.

Q:Thank you very much. But on what basis are you suggesting that it was
otherwise than a gift? Was there a transaction that you are familiar with that
you have evidence of that these young boys entered into an agreement to
purchase shares? Do you have evidence of that?

A:I do not have evidence that it was a gift or it was not a gift, and I took
the view that it was not a gift.

Q:Yes, I want to understand the basis of your view that it was not a gift.

A:Because there was no documentation.

Q:So, you just assumed, therefore, it was not a gift?

A:That’s right.

Q:Was there any documentation to show that this was a sale, or was meant to be
a sale between two parties at arms’ length?

A:Apart from the letter from … the Commissioner to say it was a sale, I have
no other evidence, yes.

Q:But it was at $1, an issue of $1. So my question [Mr [Kaka Singh], is this.
Are you suggesting that this was a transaction between the father and the two
young sons at arms’ length for the full value of the shares?

A:That’s the position I have taken.

Q:Do you have basis for that in the evidence or in any of the documents?

A:No.

82 It is clear from this lengthy cross-examination that Mr Kaka Singh
conflated two issues: (i) whether the allotment of LTSE shares should have
been considered _inter vivos_ gifts for the purposes of estate duty; and (ii)
whether the LTSE shares were allotted for value such that the value would then
be available for the purposes of distribution to beneficiaries. The evidence
supported D1’s version that the six LTSE shares were allotted to the
defendants at par value of $1 per share as part of the father’s plan to
involve his sons in the extended family business. The defendants’ expert, Mr
Reid, confirmed that from his review of the accounting records of LTSE, in
1982, the company issued two new shares at a par value of $1 per share and the
two new shares were subscribed for, and that was a transaction between the
company and the two brothers.[note: 45] In his opinion, the subscriber
shareholders, being the patriarch and matriarch, arranged and agreed that the
company would allow two new shares to be issued at par value. In addition, Mr
Kaka Singh accepted that the price at which shares were allotted was a matter
for the shareholders.[note: 46] In contrast, there is no evidence to support
the plaintiff’s contention that the father intended the defendants to pay him
(or LTSE) the sum of $1,311,102.51 for all the six LTSE shares. I agree with
Mr Singh SC that there is no basis for the plaintiff’s contention that there
should be an “increase in value” of $1,311,102.51 that ought to have been
taken into account by the Commissioner in calculating the estate duty payable
by the father’s estate.[note: 47] I find no evidential basis for the argument
that the share allotments were improper.

83 I now turn to the plaintiff’s contention that D1 had failed to disclose the
six LTSE shares to the Commissioner. This contention is baseless. The six LTSE
shares were disclosed to the Commissioner and he was told by WTT that the six
LTSE shares were purchased by the defendants. The audited accounts of LTSE
were provided to the Commissioner who accepted that LTSE (and not the father)
had allotted six shares to the defendants at par value of $1 per share. In
other words, the six shares were not the father’s to dispose of. The
Commissioner therefore did not treat the six shares as _inter vivos_ gifts
within five years of the father’s death.

84 It is not disputed that the Commissioner did not levy estate duty for the
six LTSE shares. Mr Kaka Singh suggested that the Commissioner had made a
mistake by excluding the six LTSE shares as assets of the father that were
disposed of within five years of his death. There is no evidential basis for
Mr Kaka Singh’s contention. The presumption as to the correctness of the
statements in the Commissioner’s certificates stands in the absence of
evidence to the contrary (see s 54 of 1970 EDA). In any case, whether the
Commissioner was wrong and should have levied additional estate duty on the
allotment of these six LTSE shares is completely irrelevant to the issues
before me.

(c) Inadequate consideration for the sale of Hup Seng Huat shares to LTSE

85 Mr Kaka Singh pointed out that the Commissioner had computed the
“inadequate consideration” for the sale of Hup Seng Huat shares to LTSE (_ie_
, $1,345,111.71 (see item (I)(2)(bb) in the Father’s Schedule of Assets at
[26] above) on the basis of 4,799 shares when, in actual fact, a total of
4,949 (_ie_ 150 more) shares were sold to LTSE. The plaintiff relies on an
LTSE director’s resolution dated 16 July 1983 to show that D1 (who was a
director of LTSE at the relevant time) knew that 4,949 and not 4,799 Hup Seng
Huat shares were purchased by LTSE.[note: 48] The plaintiff initially
suggested that D1 deliberately under-disclosed to the Commissioner the total
number of Hup Seng Huat shares purchased by LTSE to reduce the estate duty
payable on “inadequate consideration”. This later morphed into an argument
that the under-disclosure would have meant that D1 had failed to recover the
full consideration for these extra 150 shares from LTSE.[note: 49]

86 As for the plaintiff’s initial point, the amount of “inadequate
consideration” that should be included in Father’s Schedule of Assets for
estate duty purposes is entirely irrelevant for the purposes of ascertaining
the amount of distributable assets in the father’s estate. Turning to the
latter point, it was clear to me that the under-disclosure of 150 shares was
an inadvertent mistake of no consequence for the reason explained in the
passage quoted below. The credit balance of $1,521,424.57 with LTSE at the
time of the father’s death would have already included the consideration paid
for these 150 shares. As the plaintiff’s expert report states:[note: 50]

We note that a total of 4,949 shares (4,500 + 449) owned by [the father] in
[the Company] were sold to [LTSE] at a consideration of $100 per share at par.
The total consideration of $494,900 was credited to [the father’s] current
account with [LTSE] on 1 March 1983 … and 16 July 1983.

87 I therefore find that the under-disclosure of the number of Hup Seng Huat
shares sold to LTSE did not lead to any distributable value in the father’s
estate for which D1 had to account to the plaintiff.

(d) The 1,000 shares in International Finance and $100,000 investment in
Brilliant Development

88 The plaintiff claims that the father had (i) purchased 1,000 shares at
$1.70 per share in International Finance, and (ii) made a $100,000 investment
in Brilliant Development in 1981. She argued that the shares in International
Finance should have been included in the Father’s Schedule of Assets and
included as part of the father’s distributable estate.[note: 51] She also
asserted that the $100,000 investment in Brilliant Development was
mischaracterised as “gifts to persons unknown” and that it should not have
formed part of the $145,437.27 of unaccounted withdrawals at line item (F) in
the Father’s Schedule of Assets (see [26] above).[note: 52] As a result, the
plaintiff claimed that the size of the father’s estate was reduced to her
detriment since these two investments should have been available for
distribution.

89 D1 disagreed that those investments were available for distribution.
According to D1, neither WTT, the mother nor him were able to find out what
became of the investments or whether the investments were still held by the
father at the time of his death.[note: 53] I accept D1’s version of events.
The documentary evidence clearly shows that the purchase of the 1,000 shares
in International Finance was disclosed to the Commissioner. The fact that they
did not appear in the Father’s Schedule of Assets meant that the Commissioner
accepted D1’s explanation and was thus satisfied that those shares did not
form part of the father’s estate at the time of his death for estate duty
purposes. I agree with Mr Singh SC’s submissions that the plaintiff had not
shown that the shares in question were available to the defendants or the
father held them at the time of his death.

90 In relation to the $100,000 investment in Brilliant Development, a
Taiwanese company, the documentary evidence shows that WTT, D1 and his mother
had attempted to obtain more information about this investment, but were not
successful and have notified the Commissioner of the efforts made and
outcome.[note: 54] In the absence of any contrary evidence from the plaintiff,
I am satisfied that there was nothing improper about accounting for the
$100,000 investment as gifts to persons unknown. It therefore did not lead to
any distributable value in the father’s estate for which D1 had to account to
the plaintiff.

(e) Estate duty issues

(i) Interest of $557,289.39

91 The plaintiff initially alleged that D1 was negligent in giving untimely
responses to the Commissioner in relation to the administration of the
father’s estate and that this had caused a large amount of interest (_ie_ ,
$557,289.39) to accrue unnecessarily. However, during the course of the
hearing, the plaintiff conceded that D1 had done everything he could in this
respect and withdrew her allegations of negligence:[note: 55]

Q:It’s a very simple question. I’ve shown you what steps Boh Chuan took to
find money to put as deposits with the Commissioner. Are you saying that he
could have found other money, additional money to put in as deposits?

A:No.

Q:Thank you very much. Are you saying that any of these deposits could have
been put in earlier than when they were put in?

A:No.

Q:Thank you. Therefore, you would accept that Boh Chuan as co-administrator,
did all he could in the circumstances, and acted reasonably in realizing the
cash that he did on the days which he did to make the deposits on the dates on
which they were made?

A:Yes.

Q:Thank you very much. So you would withdraw, therefore, the allegation
against Boh Chuan that he acted negligently or failed to discharge his duty by
allowing interest of half a million to accrue, correct? Please don’t look at
the back of the court, Ms Lim.

A:Yes.

92 Even though she withdrew her complaint at the trial, the plaintiff’s
Closing Submissions raised it again by alleging undue delay in the filing of
the estate duty forms and further delay in not ensuring that estate duty and
interest were paid promptly.[note: 56] In my view, the complaint is without
merit. I accepted D1’s evidence that he and his mother were completely
dependent on WTT and had followed WTT’s advice in their dealings with the
Commissioner.

93 At the outset, WTT estimated the estate duty to be in the region of
$600,000 on 30 May 1984.[note: 57] In fact, on 23 August 1984, the
Commissioner’s estimate of the estate duty payable on the father’s estate was
in the region of $652,000.[note: 58] WTT’s advice to D1 and the mother on 30
May 1984 was that pending final assessment they should take steps to pay a
substantial amount as deposit of estate duty to reduce the interest that was
accruing. This was what D1 and the mother did in the months and years that
followed. The first payment of $100,000 to account of estate duty was on 15
September 1984.[note: 59] There were further periodic payments to account such
that by 30 October 1989, D1 had paid to account of estate duty a total sum of
$1,022,342.42 to the Commissioner.[note: 60] Notably, the Commissioner’s
computation of the net estate duty payable (excluding interest) sent under
cover of the Commissioner’s letter of 16 October 1989 was $1,917,753.86.

94 I pause here to mention that from WTT’s communications, the legal advice
given to D1 and his mother on estate duty was for the estate to continue to
make periodic advance payments towards estate duty in order to reduce the
charge on interest. As D1 maintained, WTT did not advise D1 and his mother
that donees of _inter vivos_ gifts were accountable for estate duty purpose.

95 From the correspondence, whilst WTT engaged the Commissioner in its
valuation of shares in Hup Seng Huat, D1 continued to make periodic payments
to account of estate duty right up to 8 October 1990, and by that date, a
total amount of $1,749,816.17 had been paid.[note: 61] The Commissioner’s
revised and amended computation of the net estate duty payable in the sum of
$1,904,603.62 (excluding interest) was finalised on 25 March 1991. By 1 April
1991, the Commissioner sent the Notice of Amended Assessment and Amended
Computation of Interest to WTT. By that Notice of Amended Assessment, the net
estate duty payable (after taking in all payments to account of estate duty
plus interest) was $707,471.45 and interest from 11 October 1990 to 25 March
1991 on $154,767.45 at the rate of 6% per annum was $4,223.79.[note: 62] D1
paid the final outstanding amount of estate duty in the sum of $771,695.24
($707,471.45 plus $4,223.79) and interest of $381.60 on 9 April 1991.[note:
63]

96 Unfortunately, the periodic payments to account of estate duty (which
started in September 1984 and ended in 8 October 1990) were insufficient as
the actual estate duty assessed by the Commissioner some six years later
turned out to be almost three times the original estimate of $652,000. The
plaintiff did not deal with this initial under-estimation of estate duty and
many periodic advance payments. It would be wrong not to take these matters
into consideration. I should mention, at this juncture, a related point made
in the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions that effectively contradicts her
overall complaints against D1 in the administration of father’s estate – that
interest at the rate 12% would not normally be charged unless the Commissioner
detected evidence of omission of assets that should have been declared or
undue delay in filing the estate duty forms.[note: 64] I note that the rate of
interest charged by the Commissioner was 6% and not 12% (see [95] above). For
all the reasons stated, I find the plaintiff’s assertion that D1 had caused a
large amount of interest (_ie_ , $557,289.39) to accrue unnecessarily to be
misplaced and baseless.

(ii) Accountable persons: Donees of _inter vivos_ gifts

97 I now turn to the plaintiff’s main allegation in relation to estate duty:
that D1, as an administrator of the father’s estate, was in breach of his duty
because he failed to recoup estate duty paid on behalf of donees of _inter
vivos_ gifts made by the father within five years of his death. According to
the plaintiff, if D1 had discharged his duty, the father’s estate would have
surplus assets available for distribution.

98 In their submissions on this point, the parties referred to the now-
repealed Estate Duty Act (Cap 96, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the 2005 EDA”) instead of the
1970 EDA. This is immaterial in so far as the relevant provisions of the 1970
EDA are the same as the corresponding provisions of the 2005 EDA, save that
the section numbers differ. The following provisions of the 1970 EDA applied
to the administration of the father’s estate:

**Interpretation**

2\. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —

…

“executor” means the executor or administrator of a deceased person…

**Estate duty imposed**

6.—(1) Save as hereinafter expressly provided, there shall be levied and paid
upon the principal value, ascertained as hereinafter provided, of all property
settled or not settled which passes on the death of any person a duty, called
estate duty. …

**What property is deemed to pass**

7\. Property passing on the death of the deceased shall be deemed to include
the property following, that is to say:—

(a) property of which the deceased was at the time of his death competent to
dispose;

…

(c) property taken as a donatio mortis causa made by the deceased or taken
under a disposition made by him, purporting to operate as an immediate gift
inter vivos, whether by way of transfer, delivery, declaration of trust, or
otherwise, which shall not have been bona fide made five years before his
death…

**Liability of executor**

26.—(1) The executor of the deceased shall pay the estate duty in respect of
all property of which the deceased was competent to dispose at his death, on
delivering an estate duty affidavit to the Commissioner, and may pay in like
manner the estate duty in respect of any other property passing on such death,
… in the case of property not under his control, if the persons accountable
for the duty in respect thereof request him to make such payment …

_…_

**Liability of person other than executor**

(3) Where property passes on the death of the deceased, and his executor is
not accountable for the estate duty in respect of such property, every person
to whom any property so passes for any beneficial interest in possession …
shall be accountable for the estate duty on the property…

**Recovery of estate duty**

**34.** —(1) Any sum of money owing by way of estate duty or interest thereon
to the Government … shall be a debt due to the Government…

99 In my view, the following propositions can be gleaned from the relevant
provisions of the 1970 EDA:

(i) The 1970 EDA levied estate duty on property which passed on the father’s
death: s 6 of the 1970 EDA.

(ii) A gift that is not _bona fide_ made within five years of the father’s
death was property which was deemed to pass on his death: s 7(c) of the 1970
EDA.

(iii) The persons accountable to the Commissioner for estate duty on property
which passed on the death of the father were: (i) the executor (_ie_ , the
mother and D1) and (ii) “persons other than the executor”: s 26 of the 1970
EDA.

(iv) Section 26(3) read with s 26(1) of the 1970 EDA envisages that “persons
other than the executor” included persons who obtained a beneficial interest
in property which the father was not competent to dispose of at his death but
which was deemed to have passed on his death. Such a definition would
encompass donees of _inter vivos_ gifts made by the father less than five
years before his death.

(v) The estate duty owed by an “accountable person” such as a donee
constitutes a debt due to the Government: s 34 of the 1970 EDA.

100 It is clear from the 1970 EDA that estate duty should be borne by the
donee of _inter vivos_ gifts made within five years of the donor’s death (see
E J Mann, _Green’s Death Duties_ (Butterworths, 6th Ed, 1967) at 581; R K
Johns and Roy Greenfield, _Dymond’s Death Duties_ (Oyes Publishing Limited,
15th Ed, 1973) at 912-913) (_ie_ , the “donee rule”). Although the donee is an
accountable person, the donee may at any time request the executor to pay on
his behalf and the executor may do so if he wishes in exercise of his
discretion under s 26(1) of 1970 EDA.

101 Section 26(1), as Mr Singh SC contends, is permissive and not mandatory in
that the executor “may pay” estate duty “in the case of property not under his
control” if the accountable person requests him to make such payment. In other
words, the provision gives the executor discretion to decide whether he wants
to pay the estate duty on behalf of the donee. The provision does not go on to
spell out whether the estate duty paid by the executor becomes a debt
recoverable against the donee. Ordinarily, the executor if he chooses to
exercise his discretion to pay the estate duty on the donee’s behalf, he may
agree to pay on the basis of whatever arrangement he deems appropriate and
wishes to impose on the donee. This reading of the provision makes sense since
the Commissioner is only concerned with the proper recovery of the estate duty
payable; the persons accountable for estate duty may make his own private
arrangements with the executor to discharge his obligation to pay such duty.

102 In the present case, the executor paid the whole of the estate duty
without recovering pro rata estate duty from the donees. A tacit understanding
not to seek recovery from donees of _inter vivos_ gifts is not far-fetched
seeing that it was, as Mr Singh SC submits, never the father’s intention that
the estate duty be paid by his wife and the children to whom he had given
_inter vivos_ gifts within five years of his death. At the time of the
father’s death, the mother was a housewife, and the children, who had then not
completed their tertiary education, were not financially independent. Even the
plaintiff herself conceded in cross-examination that the father never intended
her, her siblings and her mother to pay estate duty on _inter vivos_ gifts
from the father, and that instead, the estate was to pay the estate
duty.[note: 65] In these circumstances, the executor’s payment of the whole of
the estate duty must have been on a without recourse basis in the absence of
evidence pointing to the contrary. It follows that D1 was properly exercising
his discretion under s 26(1) of the 1970 EDA in accordance with the
concomitant family setting of the present case.

103 For the executor to exercise his discretion under s 26(1), the donee has
to “request him to make such payment”. In the present case, was the “request”
requirement satisfied even though there was no express request made by the
donee? Mr Singh SC argues that the requirement becomes nugatory where the
executor and the donee are the same person. I agree with counsel for the
plaintiff, Mr Chelva Rajah SC (“Mr Rajah SC”) who pointed out that the case of
_In Re Hole Davies v Witts_ [1905] 2 Ch 384 cited by Mr Singh SC does not
stand for the proposition that where the executor was the same person
accountable for the property, he will be assumed to have made the payment on
an implied request by himself as the accountable person to himself as
executor. Nonetheless, I find support for such a principle in _Meyrick v
Hargreaves_ [1897] 1 Ch 99. In that case, there was an implied request because
the administrator and the beneficiary were the same person. Chitty J held that
a “request” may have been impliedly made if the executor and the person
accountable for the duty are the same person:

It was under his control as trustee of the settlement; for, being settlement.
The sub-section provides that in the case of property not under his control,
which plainly means under his control as executor of the deceased person, he
may pay the estate duty, "If the persons accountable for the duty in respect
thereof request him to make such payment." As trustee he was one of those
persons, and he did pay the duty. I need hardly say that he paid the duty on
the whole rightly; and _as for the request, it was the request which he
impliedly made to himself in the character of trustee to himself as executor
of the deceased_.

[emphasis added]

104 The principle is clear - there is no need for an express request if the
executor or administrator is already apprised of the donee’s intention or
situation. Therefore, I find that D1 cannot be faulted for causing the estate
to pay the whole estate duty even though no actual request was made; it was
plausible to view the payment of the estate duty in exercise of his discretion
derived from s 26(1) in light of the family situation described in [102] above
and the periodic payments to account of estate duty made on advice of WTT (see
[94] above). It would be superfluous to expect D1 and his mother to make a
request to D1 and his mother when they together with the plaintiff and D2 were
already apprised of the situation that the father never intended the
plaintiff, the defendants and his wife to pay estate duty. Equally, the
reasoning in [102] above applies to LTSE and the cash gift of $15,000 to Lim
Kim Luan, who was the father’s sister.

105 In contrast to Mr Singh SC’s contention that intention may be implied from
the testator’s conduct based on the facts of each case which is relevant to
whether the executor’s discretion is properly exercised, Mr Rajah SC submits
that the testator’s intention may only be taken into account if it is in
writing. In support of his argument, Mr Rajah SC relies on s 29(1) of the 1970
EDA (corresponding provision is 33(1) of the 2005 EDA) which reads as follows:

**Liability of executor**

29\. —(1) In the case of property which does not pass to the executor as such,
an amount equal to the proper rateable part of the estate duty may be
recovered by the person, who being authorised or required to pay the estate
duty in respect of any property has paid such duty, from the person entitled
to any sum charged on such property (whether as capital or as an annuity or
otherwise) under a disposition _not containing any express provision to the
contrary_. [emphasis added]

106 Mr Rajah SC argues that short of an “express provision to the contrary,
the donee cannot “recover” the estate duty from the executor. This line of
argument is unsustainable on the present facts. First, s 29(1) does not affect
the executor’s discretion to pay the estate duty per se under s 26(1). Second,
s 29(1) does not apply to the present facts. The provision relates to the
apportionment of estate duty amongst beneficiaries by giving a beneficiary who
has made a prior payment of estate duty the right to recover a rateable
proportion from other beneficiaries of a particular property. The provision in
s 26(1) gives the executor discretion to pay, while the provision in s 29(1)
gives the beneficiary a right to recover. The two provisions are legally
distinct from each other. In other words, the beneficiary’s right to recover
under s 29(1) has little bearing on the executor’s discretion to pay under s
26(1). Indeed, as E J Mann observed, “[e]state duty, where it is a charge on
the property, is intended to fall on the beneficiaries according to their
respective interests. Under s 14(1) of the Finance Act 1894 a rateable part of
such duty, paid by a person authorised to do so, may be recovered by him…”
(see E J Mann, _Green’s Death Duties_ (Butterworths, 6th Ed, 1967) at 576).
Section 14(1) of the UK Finance Act 1894 which is _in pari materia_ with s
29(1) of the 1970 EDA allows a beneficiary who has paid the estate duty
(either in full or in part) to recover a rateable part of it from another
person holds or has held a beneficial interest to the property under the
disposition. For instance, the English Court of Appeal held in _Re Keele
Estates (No. 2)_ [1952] 2 All ER 164 that a rateable proportion of the estate
duty was recoverable from persons entitled to portions charged on the settled
land under the will of the deceased remainder man. The intended effect of the
provision plainly makes sense as it is a mere extension of the principle that
the person who has received a benefit must also bear the burden. Be that as it
may, I will say no more because this issue did not arise on the present facts.
Suffice to say for now, neither the executor nor the estate received any part
of the _inter vivos_ gift and therefore s 29(1) is not applicable to the
present case.

107 In light of the analysis above, I find that D1 did not breach his duty in
paying the estate duty for the donees. For the sake of argument, however, even
if the administrator’s payment of estate duty of the _inter vivos_ gift was at
the donee’s request and the EDA obliges the former to recoup the payment from
the donee, I find that D1’s omission to recoup estate duty was excusable under
s 63 of the 1985 TA (see [3] above) on the grounds that he had acted honestly
and reasonably throughout the administration of the parents’ estates. I should
mention that the defendants referred to s 60 of the Trustee Act (Cap 337, 2005
Rev Ed) (“the 2005 TA”) instead of the 1985 TA which was the version in force
at the material time. Section 63 of the 1985 TA is the same as s 60 which is
the corresponding provision of the 2005 TA, save that the section number
differs.

108 Even though Mr Charles Leong of Y&L testified that he would ordinarily
advise a client about the “donee rule”, it does not follow that WTT had given
the same advice to D1 and his mother. D1 said that WTT’s advice to him and his
mother was to find money to make periodic advance payments to the Commissioner
to reduce the charge on interest and that he was not told by WTT that the
donees of _inter vivos_ gifts were accountable for estate duty.

109 I accept D1’s evidence which is borne out by WTT’s contemporaneous
communications with D1 and his mother in which the main thrust on estate duty
was for the estate to continue to make periodic advance payments towards
estate duty in order to reduce the charge on interest. D1 followed WTT’s
advice of 30 May 1984 and the first advance payment of $100,000 was on 15
September 1984. The documentary evidence showed that D1 and his mother
consistently made periodic payments to account of estate duty such that a
total amount of $1,749,816.17 was paid by 8 October 1990. There was nothing in
the contemporaneous communications to suggest that WTT advised D1 that donees
of _inter vivos_ gifts were accountable for estate duty purpose. It is
important to remember that throughout this period of time, the Commissioner
had not yet finalised his assessment of estate duty payable, and the focus of
WTT and the administrators during this interim period was to heed WTT’s advice
by sustaining the periodic payments to account of estate duty.

110 The case of _Ng Eng Ghee & Others v Mamata Kapildev Dave_ and Others
[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 does not assist the plaintiff. In that case, the Court of
Appeal held that a trustee who has sought legal advice on matters that are not
within his competence may take the legal advice into account but he is still
required to act in good faith, responsibly and reasonably in coming to his own
decision. In the present case, the matter of legal advice is contextually
relevant to the issue of D1’s bona fides. Certainly, the position is different
where WTT did not tell D1 and his mother that donees of _inter vivos_ were
persons accountable for estate duty in respect of the _inter vivos_ gifts and
that they had a duty to recover estate duty paid on behalf of donees. As such,
I do not see how the element of dishonesty is made out in these circumstances
where there was no recoupment of payment per se. I find that D1 had, in good
faith, relied on the legal advice (or lack thereof) of WTT in carrying out his
duty as an administrator, and contrary to the plaintiff’s contention, the non-
recovery of estate duty from donees of _inter vivos_ gifts would not be
considered dishonest by the standards of ordinary and honest people to render
the omission fraudulent. Furthermore, in this regard, D1 ought to be excused
for not recouping estate duty on a pro-rata basis from LTSE and other donees
under s 63 of 1985 TA.

111 In any event, even if, for the sake of argument, s 63 of 1985 TA does not
apply, D1’s start-date of his obligation to recoup pro rata estate duty under
the donee rule would 19 September 1991. In the absence of fraud, any claim
against D1 would have been time barred six years later as was the case here
seeing that the present action was commenced in January 2012.

112 “Fraud” in the context of s 22(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996
Rev Ed) (“the LA”), does not mean the common law fraud or deceit but it
denotes conduct by the defendant that would be against conscience for him to
avail himself of the lapse of time (per Brightman J in _Bartlett and Others v
Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd_ [1980] 1 Ch 515 at 537). Brightman J in his
decision appropriately cited Lord Denning MR’s observations in _Applegate v
Moss_ [1971] 1 QB 406 at 413:

The section applies whenever the conduct of the defendant or his agent has
been such as to hide from the plaintiff the existence of his right of action,
in such circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow the defendant to
rely on the lapse of time as a bar to the claim.

113 In this case, D1 was not advised of the “donee rule” and as such there was
no cover-up by D1 that the estate paid the pro-rata duty for the donees. As
Lord Denning MR puts it in _King v Victor Parsons & Co_ [1973] 1 WLR 29 at 34:

If the defendant was, however, quite unaware that he was committing a wrong or
a breach of contract, it would be different.

(f) Transfer of shares by way of partial reimbursement

114 I now turn to the related issue of the transfer of one share each in
Eastern Win, Hup Seng Huat and TSM from the father’s estate to LTSE as a form
of partial “reimbursement” (see [30] above). Those shares were valued by the
Commissioner as follows:

(i) one share in Eastern Win at $0.86;

(ii) one share in Hup Seng Huat at $380.29; and

(iii) one share in TSM at $118.71 (see [26] above).

The combined value of those shares was $496.86.

115 As for the transfers, D1 has to justify the partial “reimbursement” _in
specie_. It cannot be disputed that after paying funeral expenses and
collecting assets, the duty of executors or administrators is to pay the just
debts and to satisfy just claims against the estate. In the light of my ruling
that the whole of estate duty was to be paid by the estate, the father’s
estate did owe LTSE money. D1’s transfer of one share each in Eastern Win, Hup
Seng Huat and TSM from the father’s estate to LTSE as a form of partial
“reimbursement” was in the circumstances not unwarranted, and I find that D1
was not in breach of duty in the light of my ruling on the “donee rule”.

116 For the sake of argument, even if D1 was mistaken on this point, again on
the basis of the advice (or the lack thereof) which D1 and his mother received
from WTT in relation to the issue of estate duty, I am satisfied that D1 had
acted honestly and reasonably and ought to be excused under s 63 of 1985 TA
for transferring one share each in Eastern Win, Hup Seng Huat and TSM from the
father’s estate to LTSE as a form of partial “reimbursement”.

(2) Claims in relation to the LTSE Shares

117 I turn now to the plaintiff’s pleaded case that the defendants made
fraudulent misrepresentations to her and the mother which induced both of them
to part with their entitlements to the LTSE shares.

118 I shall first deal with the plaintiff’s claim that the mother was misled
into transferring her interests in LTSE to the defendants. Significantly, the
mother’s Will was made in 1990 and by her Will she bequeathed her interests in
her LTSE shares to the defendants. That was well before the First Transfer
Documents and the Second Transfer Form were signed in 1992. The terms of her
Will provided objective and compelling evidence of her independent intention
at the material time.

119 I accept D2’s evidence that his mother signed the Will on 16 March 1990.
He remembered that a Hokkien interpreter translated the Will to his mother
before she signed it. At that time, his mother was fully aware of what was
happening and she remained clear minded until her death. As it was the
plaintiff who brought the mother to the lawyer’s office to execute the Will,
the plaintiff is not challenging the Will and it is not her case that the Will
did not reflect the mother’s wishes. It is not disputed that D1 learned about
the Will sometime after the mother passed away.

120 The plaintiff case is that there was a misrepresentation of fact by D2 at
the time of signing the First Transfer Documents that one LTSE share was worth
only $1 (when in fact the Commissioner had assessed the value of one LTSE
share to be $337,674.99).[note: 66] Significantly, the plaintiff conceded that
there was no such similar allegation made against D1.

121 According to the plaintiff, the fraudulent misrepresentation of fact by D2
was made both orally and in writing. The written misrepresentation took the
form of D2 passing her the Letter of Consent which contained the phrase
“transfer our share of entitlements in the one (1) ordinary share of S$1.00
fully paid in Lim Tian Siong Enterprise Pte Ltd”. The oral misrepresentation
took the form of D2 repeating words of a similar effect to the plaintiff. She
asserted that (i) the representations were false; (ii) she had relied on the
representations; and (iii) had it not been for D2’s fraud, she would not have
transferred her one-sixth entitlement in the Father’s LTSE Share to D2.

122 The applicable principles in relation to fraudulent misrepresentation were
enunciated by the Court of Appeal in _Panatron Pte Ltd and Another v Lee Cheow
Lee and another_ [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435. The Court held that there are five
elements to proving fraudulent misrepresentation at [13]–[14]:

13 The law as regards fraudulent representation is clear. Since the case of
_Pasley v Freeman_ (1789) 3 Term Rep 51, it has been settled that a person can
be held liable in tort to another, if he knowingly or recklessly makes a false
statement to that other with the intent that it would be acted upon, and that
other does act upon it and suffers damage. This came to be known as the tort
of deceit. In _Derry v Peek_ (1889) 14 App Cas 337 the tort was further
developed. It was held that in an action of deceit the plaintiff must prove
actual fraud. This fraud is proved only when it is shown that a false
representation has been made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or
recklessly, without caring whether it be true or false.

14 The essentials of this tort have been set out by Lord Maugham in _Bradford
Building Society v Borders_ [1941] 2 All ER 205. Basically there are the
following essential elements. First, there must be a representation of fact
made by words or conduct. Second, the representation must be made with the
intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of
persons which includes the plaintiff. Third, it must be proved that the
plaintiff had acted upon the false statement. Fourth, it must be proved that
the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing. Fifth, the representation must be
made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least
made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.

123 The plaintiff sought to argue that having regard to the circumstances in
which the Letter of Consent was signed and her lack of understanding of the
technical meaning of the phrase “$1.00 fully paid”, she had reasonably
understood D2’s representation to mean that the share was only worth $1.

124 The phrase “$1.00 fully paid” which was written in the Letter of Consent
and allegedly communicated to her orally was literally true – the par value of
each LTSE share was $1. It was true that $1 par value did not reflect and was
not the true value of the LTSE Share but nothing in the Letter of Consent
suggested that it was only worth $1.

125 D2’s testimony was more credible than the plaintiff’s version. D2 said
that he never told the plaintiff that the Father’s LTSE Share was worth $1. He
had made no reference to $1, and that he acted honestly at all material times.
He further testified that D1, the plaintiff and his mother were aware of what
was stated in the Letter of Consent, _ie_ the par value of the Father’s LTSE
Share and that the Letter of Consent expressly stated that the transfer was
free of any consideration. Furthermore, D1’s payment of $1 for the Mother’s
LTSE share was a nominal sum.

126 D2 also testified that the transfer of the Mother’s LTSE Share to D1 and
the Father’s LTSE Share to D2 by the mother was in keeping with the father’s
wishes to pass the business on to his sons. It was for this reason that that
the First Transfer Documents and the Second Transfer Form was prepared and
signed.

127 He rejected the plaintiff’s claim that she was misled into believing that
the value of the Father’s LTSE Share was worth $1. He doubted that the
plaintiff who was inquisitive by nature was unaware that the Father’s LTSE
Share was worth more than its par value. Besides, it was implausible that the
plaintiff who was a graduate in business studies did not understand what par
value of a share meant.

128 While the context in which the words were spoken or written are valid
considerations (see _The Law of Contract in Singapore_ (Andrew Phang Boon
Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at 11.018), I was not convinced that
this particular context rendered the representation false, nor was there an
intention by D2 to mislead her as to the value of the father’s LTSE Share.
This was not a case of a misrepresentation against the plaintiff – this was
_at best_ a case of a misunderstanding by the plaintiff.

129 For these reasons, the plaintiff has not made out the five ingredients of
the tort (see [122] above). Accordingly, her claim against D2 fails.

130 However, even if D2’s words and conduct amounted to fraudulent
misrepresentation, which was not the case, the plaintiff’s case would fail
because it is time-barred. As D2 was not an administrator of the father’s
estate, any claim against D2 for fraudulent misrepresentation would have been
susceptible to the statutory time bar in s 6(1)(a) read with s 29 of the LA:

**Limitation of actions of contract and tort and certain other actions**

6(1) Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after the
expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued:

(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort;

…

**Postponement of limitation period in case of fraud or mistake**

29(1) Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is
prescribed by this Act —

(_a_) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent or of
any person through whom he claims or his agent;

(_b_) the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person as
aforesaid; or

(_c_) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,

the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has
discovered the fraud or the mistake, as the case may be, or could with
reasonable diligence have discovered it.

131 In relation to the phrase “could with reasonable diligence have discovered
it” in s 29 of the LA, reference can be made to English case law on s 32 of
the Limitation Act 1980 (UK) (the English equivalent to s 29 the LA). In
_Paragon Finance plc v D B Thakerar & Co (a firm)_ [1999] 1 All ER 400 (“
_Paragon Finance_ ”), Millett LJ held that the question is not whether the
plaintiff should have discovered the fraud sooner; but whether she could with
reasonable diligence have done so (_Paragon Finance_ at 418). The burden of
proof is on her to establish that she could not have discovered the fraud
without exceptional measures which she could not reasonably have been expected
to take.

132 What measures the plaintiff is reasonably expected to take is very much
dependent on the context of the case (see for example _Peco Arts Inc v Hazlitt
Gallery Ltd_ [1983] 3 All ER 193; _Paragon Finance_). In light of the fact
that the plaintiff was a co-administratrix of the mother’s estate, and amongst
other things she had signed the estate duty affidavit where the Mother’s LTSE
Share was valued as $224,185.25 by the Commissioner, in my view, the plaintiff
would be expected to take the same measures that an ordinary prudent person
would take in the management of his own affairs. This is consistent with the
common law standard of care expected of an administrator in the management of
the affairs of an estate (see _Re Lucking's Will Trusts_ [1967] 3 All ER 726
at 733), which to some extent, has been codified in the statutory duty of care
under the 1985 TA.

133 D2 testified that the plaintiff as co-administratrix of the mother’s
estate was fully aware of matters relating to the administration of the
mother’s estate as he would discuss from time to time such matters with the
plaintiff before giving instructions to Y&L.[note: 67] The plaintiff, at that
time, did not voiced any objections. D2 rejected the plaintiff’s assertion
that she was co-administratrix in name only and that it was not true that she
played no active role in the matter.[note: 68]

134 In the course of ascertaining the value of the mother’s estate for estate
duty purposes, copies of the estate duty affidavit and the Father’s Schedule
of Assets were made available to D2 and the plaintiff. Y&L wrote to the
Commissioner of Estate Duty on 4 June 1993 stating that the mother did not
hold any shares in LTSE at the date of death and that she had sold her share
on 23 June 1992 for $1. On 23 June 1993, the Commissioner enquired who bought
the Mother’s LTSE Share and what had happened to the Father’s LTSE Share. Y&L
replied on 4 August 1993 stating that the former was purchased by D1 for $1
and the latter was transferred to D2.

135 D2 maintained that the plaintiff would have known of the Commissioner’s
valuation of the one share in LTSE at the time of the mother’s death from the
Commissioner letter dated 6 September 1993 that was copied to him and the
plaintiff under L&Y’s cover letter dated 9 September 1993. The Commissioner
valued the mother’s one share in LTSE at $224,185.25 and her half share
derived from the father’s estate was fixed at $112,092.63.

136 For these reasons, the defendants rejected the plaintiff’s contention that
she was not aware of the value of the Father’s LTSE Share until the China
Party Action. In addition, the plaintiff confirmed at the trial that she
received the listing prospectus of Hup Seng Huat although her pleaded case was
that she never received the prospectus. The relevance of the prospectus is
that it contained, amongst other things, financial information relating to Hup
Seng Huat, Eastern Win, TSM, LTSE’s shareholding in Hup Seng Huat and the
defendants’ shareholding in HHS as at 22 January 1994. It is clear from the
prospectus that LTSE was worth a substantial amount. The defendants submitted
that the plaintiff could have ascertained the value of the LTSE shares if she
had read the prospectus. Mr Singh SC submitted that the fact remains that she
chose not to read the prospectus; it was irrelevant that she found prospectus
too boring to read.

137 If the plaintiff had taken the same measures as a prudent person would
have in the management of his or her own affairs, she would have discovered
the purported misrepresentation since there was no active concealment of the
value of an LTSE share by the defendants. In fact, as mentioned, there were
several documents which she came across or ought to have come across (had she
exercised diligence) in the administration of the mother’s estate which showed
that the value of the LTSE shares in question were well above $1.

138 As mentioned above at [58], it was not the plaintiff’s pleaded case that,
apart from any fraudulent misrepresentation, D1 fraudulently breached his
duties as an administrator by failing to make disclosure of the value of the
plaintiff’s entitlement to her before she signed the First Transfer Documents.
However, Mr Rajah SC introduced this in at a late stage in the plaintiff’s
Closing Submissions:[note: 69]

[the defendants] contend that the Letter of Consent was not misleading because
that document was never intended to set out the true value of 1 LTSE share.
However, that submission misunderstands the Plaintiff’s case, which is that
_at no time_ did the Defendants ever inform her of the true value of the 1
LTSE share. They could have stated that value in the Letter of Consent, or
they could have informed her before or at the time she signed the Letter of
Consent. The Defendants did not do so because it was clearly in their interest
to keep the Plaintiff in the dark.

Furthermore, as trustees of her father’s estate, they had a duty to ensure
that if any beneficiary was transferring any interest under the estate to
either of them, the beneficiaries should be made aware of the true value of
the interest and be compensated in such amount. This the Defendants failed to
do, although the Defendants both knew that the 1 LSTE share had been valued
for estate duty purposes alone at more than $200,000.

[emphasis in original]

139 This argument is not the case pleaded, and is tantamount to a last attempt
to augment a gap in the pleadings in Closing Submissions. As stated by Rubin J
in _Abdul Latif bin Mohammed Tahiar (trading as Canary Agencies) v Saeed
Husain s/o Hakim Gulam Mohiudin (trading as United Limousine)_ [2003] 2 SLR(R)
61 at [7]:

… It is a settled principle of law that parties stand by their pleaded case
and any defect in the pleadings cannot be cured by any averments in
affidavits, let alone an oblique reference in counsel's closing speech (see
_The Gold Ores Reduction Company v Parr_ [1892] 2 QB 14; _Novotel Societe D'
Investissements Et D' Exploitation Hoteliers v Pernas Hotel Chain (Selangor)
Bhd_ [1987] 1 MLJ 210 at 214 and _Spedding v Fitzpatrick_ (1888) 38 Ch D 410).

140 In any event, the plaintiff’s submissions appear to run into two
difficulties:

(i) First, the First Transfer Documents were drafted and premised upon the
plaintiff, the mother and D1 having already received their respective
entitlements in the Father’s LTSE Share. It is thus questionable whether any
fiduciary duty would arise in such a situation.

(ii) Second, even if D1 did owe a fiduciary duty of disclosure to the
plaintiff and this fiduciary duty was breached, it is hard to see how D1’s
silence was conduct that was dishonest by the standards of ordinary and
reasonable people so that the plaintiff could rely on s 22(1)(a) of the LA to
circumvent the statutory time bar. Crucially, D1 had transferred his own one-
sixth entitlement in the Father’s LTSE Share to D2 for no consideration. This
is consistent with D1’s testimony that he was, in good faith, carrying out his
mother’s instructions to arrange for the Father’s LTSE Share to be transferred
to D2. The plaintiff’s claim that D1 deliberately kept silent because he was
out to deceive the plaintiff into giving up her one-sixth share is without
merit and thus fails.

(3) Claims in relation to the mother’s estate

141 I now deal with the claims by the plaintiff in relation to the mother’s
estate.

142 The plaintiff reminded this court in her Closing Submissions that “the DFA
must be read with the Letter of Consent and the manner in which the father’s
estate was administered.”[note: 70] She developed her arguments on how the
defendants cheated her of her inheritance from both estates in the following
manner:

(i) Firstly, D1 “ensured that the father’s estate bore the bulk of the estate
duty so that there was no residue left for the Plaintiff.”[note: 71]

(ii) Secondly, the defendants “arranged for the Letter of Consent to be
prepared and procured the Plaintiff’s execution of it. They were aware that
the Plaintiff though she was signing away her interest in an almost valueless
share… [t]hey knew that in reality she was giving up an interest in very
valuable shares.”[note: 72]

(iii) Thirdly, the DFA was the final piece of documentation to dispose of the
remaining assets in the mother’s estate. The [DFA] was “the last step… to
secure the bulk of the residue of their parents’ estate for themselves to the
Plaintiff’s detriment.” [note: 73]

As mentioned in [50(v)] above, the plaintiff now wants the defendants to
account for the mother’s estate as if the mother had died intestate.

143 Given the findings that the plaintiff has not made out her case against
the defendants in relation to the father’s estate and the transfers of the
Father’s LTSE Share and the Mother’s LTSE Share, there is no unaccounted
assets due to the mother from the father’s estate.

144 In any event, it is trite that a party seeking equitable relief must come
to the Court with “clean hands”. In _Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United
Overseas Bank Ltd_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 292, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was)
held at [225] and [226]:

225 It is true that a plaintiff in equity must approach the court with clean
hands but this does not mean he must be blameless in all ways. Firstly, the
undesirable behaviour in question must involve more than general depravity.
"[I]t must have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for; it
must be a depravity in a legal as well as in a moral sense": see  _Dering v
Earl of Winchelsea_ [1775-1802] All ER Rep 140. This principle was similarly
followed in  _Moody v Cox_ [1917] 2 Ch 71 where it was held by Warrington LJ
at 85:

[I]n order to prevent a man coming for relief in connection with a transaction
so tainted it must be shown that the taint has a necessary and essential
relation to the contract which is sued upon, and it is not enough to say in
general that the man is not coming with clean hands when the relief he seeks
is not based on the contract which was obtained by fraud, but is to have the
contract annulled on a ground which exists quite independently of the fact
that a bribe has been given and received.

226 Moreover, the principle has lost some of its vitality over time. The
position is set out thus in Halsbury's Laws of Singapore vol 9(2) (LexisNexis,
2003) at para 110.016:

The maxim has been relaxed over time and is no longer strictly enforced. The
question is whether in all the circumstances it would be a travesty of justice
to assist the plaintiff given his blameworthy participation or role in the
transaction. The whole circumstances must be taken into account having regard
to the relief sought, for the relative blameworthiness only emerges after a
complete and exhaustive scrutiny and relief which is less drastic need not be
defeated by conduct that is less opprobrious. It has been said that the "the
conduct complained of must have an immediate and necessary relation to the
equity sued for" and "it must be a depravity in the legal as well as moral
sense".

145 I find that the plaintiff has not come to this court with clean hands. As
stated above at [40], the plaintiff lied to the court when she declared that
the mother had died intestate when she knew that this was patently untrue.
This untruth had an immediate and necessary relation to the equitable remedy
she now seeks. Her dishonest deed was an essential ingredient in her argument
that the defendants should account for the mother’s estate as if she had died
intestate, rather than in accordance with the Will. Such an argument was
premised on a situation which had been created as a direct result of her lying
to the court to obtain the grant of Letters of Administration. The plaintiff’s
quest for an order that the defendants account for the mother’s estate as if
the mother had died intestate serves to perpetuate her lie and this court
should not lend its aid to assist the plaintiff. For this reason alone, the
plaintiff’s claim in relation to the mother’s estate fails.

146 In any event, I am not satisfied that there is any basis for the remedy
sought by the plaintiff. Not unlike D1, D2 maintained that:[note: 74]

The Deed was intended to deal fully with all the assets in my mother’s estate
which had not already been dealt with previously, and to distribute the assets
among the [plaintiff], [D1] and me. The Deed was also intended to resolve all
outstanding matters (if any) and compromise any entitlement or claims relating
to or arising from both my father’s and my mother’s estates, so as to keep the
peace in the family and to avoid a family dispute.

147 The starting point of the analysis must be the legal significance of the
DFA on any claim by the plaintiff against the defendants. The concept of a
“family arrangement” was discussed at length in _Sheares Betty Hang Kiu v Chow
Kwok Chi and others_ [2006] 2 SLR(R) 285. V K Rajah J (as he then was) held at
[16]:

16 … The term "family arrangement" is in itself a term of art that has a
peculiar and particular legal significance. In Halsbury's Laws of England vol
18 (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 1997) at paras 301, 303, 304 and 312, it is stated:

301\. ... A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same
family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family
either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family
property or the peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by
saving its honour.

The agreement may be implied from a long course of dealing, but it is more
usual to embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which the term
"family arrangement" is applied.

303\. ... The following arrangements for division of property have been
supported as family arrangements:

(1) an agreement for the division of family property by way of compromise of a
family quarrel or litigation about a disputed or lost will, or even to prevent
family friction, where there is no question as to the devolution of the
property nor any disputed right, there being some consideration for the
arrangement other than love and affection. ...

304\. ... Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not
applicable to dealings between strangers. When deciding the rights of parties
under a family arrangement or a claim to upset such an arrangement, the court
considers what in the broadest view of the matter is most in the interest of
the family, and has regard to considerations which, in dealing with
transactions between persons not members of the same family, would not be
taken into account…

312\. ... Since the consideration for a family arrangement is partly value and
partly love and affection, the pecuniary worth of the consideration is not
regarded too closely. The court will not, as a general rule, inquire into the
adequacy of the consideration, but there is an equity to set aside a family
arrangement where the inadequacy of the consideration is so gross as to lead
to the conclusion that the party either did not understand what he was about,
or was the victim of some imposition.

[emphasis in original omitted]

148 A deed of family arrangement compromises any potential claims in relation
to the estate of the deceased. This compromise is effective unless the family
arrangement is set aside, whether because of undue influence or the dishonest
non-disclosure of material facts (see for example, _Pek Nam Kee v Peh Lam
Kong_ [1994] 2 SLR(R) 750). If the plaintiff wanted to make any claim against
D2 as co-administrator (or against D1 as an executor _de son tort_), she would
first have to set aside the DFA. Nowhere in her pleaded case does she seek to
do this. In fact, the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions confirms that this is
not her intention:[note: 75]

… the Defendants claim that the reason the Plaintiff has not asked for the
Deed to be set aside is because she does not wish to lose the Puay Hee Avenue
Property.

This is a gross misreading of the plaintiff’s case. …

_The true reason the Plaintiff has not sought to rewrite the Deed is that she
seeks the enforcement of the Deed_ , taking into account the spirit in which
that document was entered into; that is, to ensure that the true value of the
mother’s estate is divided equally among the Plaintiff and the Defendants.
That could only be the case if the estate duty on gifts from the father had
been paid by the beneficiaries of those gifts in accordance with law, if the
Plaintiff had been informed of the true value of LTSE (and had not therefore
entered into the Letter of Consent) and if the Deed took into account the
residue in the mother’s estate on that basis.

[emphasis added]

149 Accordingly, even if I were to find that she had come to the court with
“clean hands”, her claims in relation to the mother’s estate must necessarily
fail since she is bound by the Clause 5 of the DFA which includes a release of
the administrators from and against all actions proceedings claims and demands
in respect of the matters agreed in the DFA. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s
contention that the DFA was the last piece of documentation in the brothers’
plan to deprive her of her inheritance in the mother’s estate is not made out
in light of my rejection of the plaintiff’s claims in relation to the father’s
estate and her additional claim that the mother was defrauded of the Mother’s
LTSE Share and her half share in the Father’s LTSE Share.

Alternative defences

150 I have already commented on s 63 of the 1985 TA in relation to D1 in
[107]–[110] above. I have also already commented on time bar in relation to D1
and D2 in [111]–[113], and [130]–[137] above. As for the defence of laches and
estoppel, it is not necessary for me to deal with them in the light of the
various findings I have made in the defendants’ favour.

Result

151 For the reasons stated, the plaintiff’s claims against the defendants are
dismissed in their entirety with costs of the action to be taxed if not
agreed.
