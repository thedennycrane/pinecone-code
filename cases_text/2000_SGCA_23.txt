(delivering the judgment of the court): These are four appeals against the
interlocutory orders made by the High Court in the libel action, Suit 1323/98,
taken out by SM Summit Holdings Ltd and its subsidiary, Summit CD Manufacture
Pte Ltd, the plaintiffs, against seven defendants, Microsoft Corporation,
Adobe Systems Incorporated, Autodesk Inc, Business Software Alliance, Stuart
Ong, Lee Cross and Ronald T Eckstrom, the defendants. We shall continue to
refer to the parties here as the plaintiffs and the defendants. The appeals
arise out of the same facts, and it is convenient to deal with them together
in this judgment.  
  
The matters under appeal had their origin in a raid carried out by the
defendants at the plaintiffs` premises on 12 August 1997 pursuant to two
search warrants obtained by the defendants before a magistrate. These search
warrants authorised representatives of the defendants to carry out a search at
the plaintiffs` premises for alleged copyright and trade mark offences. In the
course of carrying out the raid, the parties representing the defendants found
that the two warrants did not authorise them to seize various documents and
papers at the premises. For that reason, the fourth defendant, Business
Software Alliance (`BSA`), on the same evening applied to a judge of the High
Court and obtained a third search warrant, and acting on these warrants they
seized and took away a large number of documents (and copies thereof) and
other items. Immediately after the raid (`the Summit raid`), the defendants,
on 13 August 1997, called a press conference and at the conference they
published or caused to be published a press release which now forms the
subject of the present libel action.  
  
Soon after the Summit raid, the plaintiffs applied by way of criminal revision
to the High Court to quash the search warrants. Almost simultaneously BSA
applied by way of criminal motion for an order permitting their solicitors to
take copies of the documents and requiring the plaintiffs to deliver further
documents. Both the applications were heard before the learned Chief Justice,
and at the conclusion of the hearing on 29 September 1997 the learned Chief
Justice decided as follows: (i) he upheld the two search warrants issued by
the magistrate but quashed the third search warrant granted by the judge of
the High Court; (ii) he ordered all the documents (and copies) seized pursuant
to the first two search warrants and all items seized pursuant to the third
search warrant be returned to the plaintiffs, and (iii) he dismissed the
application taken out by BSA: see **SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v PP**
[1997] 3 SLR 922 .  
  
Reverting to the present action, Suit 1323/98, the plaintiffs claimed damages
against the defendants for libel contained in the press release published or
caused to be published by the latter at the press conference held on 13 August
1997. After the commencement of the action, the plaintiffs applied for a
determination of the meaning of the words complained of and also for summary
judgment. The application was of course opposed by the defendants. Prior to
the hearing of the application, the defendants filed their joint defence to
the claim and pleaded, inter alia, justification and the meaning they sought
to justified. They also filed affidavits in opposing the plaintiffs`
application. At the hearing of the application, counsel for the plaintiffs
raised a preliminary objection to the reference by the defendants, in the
defence and affidavits, to certain documents and information, which were
obtained by the defendants as a result of the Summit raid, on the grounds
first, that there was an implied undertaking on the part of the defendants not
to use those documents and information in unrelated civil proceedings, such as
Suit 1323/98, and secondly, that by reason of the order made by the learned
Chief Justice on 29 September 1997 (`the Chief Justice`s order`) the use of
such documents and copies thereof and information derived therefrom was
impermissible. The assistant registrar who heard the application overruled the
objection, and determined that the words complained of bore the meaning as
pleaded by the plaintiffs and gave leave to the defendants to amend the
pleadings. Subsequently, the pleadings were amended. Against the assistant
registrar`s decision both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed to a
judge-in-chambers, each appealing against that part of the decision that was
against them. Three appeals were filed: one by the plaintiffs and two by the
defendants, the defendants being in two groups, namely, the first, second,
third and seventh defendants being one group, and the fourth, fifth and sixth
defendants being the other group, each group being represented by separate
firms of solicitors. The learned judge, after hearing the arguments, on 3
March 1999 affirmed the decision below and dismissed all the three appeals.
Again, both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed against the decision of
the learned judge, and three appeals were filed, namely: CA 39/99 filed by the
plaintiffs and CA 37 and 38/99 filed by the defendants (`the three appeals`).  
  
While the three appeals were pending, the defendants on 5 July 1999 filed two
applications for, inter alia, a further and better list of documents and
specific discovery of certain documents from the plaintiffs, namely, Summons
for Further Directions Entered 4236 and 4237/99. The two applications were
filed by the parties as follows: one application by the first, second, third
and seventh defendants, and the other by the fourth, fifth and sixth
defendants; and both the applications were identical in all material respects.
Among the documents sought were the following five categories of documents:

(1) all the invoices, sales orders, delivery orders and/or correspondence of
the second respondents, Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd (`Summit CD`), relating
to the following persons or companies:

(a) Hardware House Computer and Electronic Shop; and/or

(b) Hardware House Computer Pte Ltd, and/or

(c) Power Multivision; and/or

(d) Ivan Yee Multi-vision; and/or

(e) PLL Computer Trading; and/or

(f) PT Tomato; and/or

(g) PT Dynamitra

(2) all documents generated during Summit CD`s CD ROM manufacturing process,
namely:

(a) sales orders (including those that had been cancelled on the grounds of
copyright infringement and/or related problems);

(b) work orders;

(c) printouts;

(d) records of incoming orders; and

(e) other records maintained during the said manufacturing process, but not
limited to:

(i) order processing;

(ii) pre-mastering;

(iii) glass mastering;

(iv) nickel plating;

(v) polishing;

(vi) re-cycling; and

(vii) quality control checking

(3) any and all reference documents used during the alleged root directory
checks which are purportedly conducted by Summit CD`s personnel;

(4) all documents relating to debts owed by the following parties, including
but not limited to, sales orders and/or work orders and/or invoices and/or all
correspondence from the respondents to the following customers requesting that
payment of their debts be made and/or records of any payments received from
the said customers:

(a) Hardware House Computer and Electronic Shop; and/or

(b) Hardware House Computer Pte Ltd, and/or

(c) Power Multivision; and/or

(d) Ivan Yee Multi-vision; and/or

(e) PLL Computer Trading; and/or

(f) PT Tomato; and/or

(g) PT Dynamitra

(5) all documents which support Summit CD`s annual turnover figures for the
period 1995 to 1998.  
  
Initially, there were other categories of documents sought to be discovered;
however, these categories were later withdrawn pursuant to a court order to
expunge all references to those documents from the cause papers in this suit.  
  
Not to be outdone, the plaintiffs a few days later, on 9 July 1999, filed two
applications, namely, SIC 4302 and 4303/99, seeking to strike out the
defendants` two applications for discovery.  
  
These are the four applications which ultimately give rise to the present
appeals. All the four applications came on for hearing before the assistant
registrar on 12 July 1999 and he allowed the defendants` applications for
discovery and dismissed the plaintiffs` applications for striking out. In his
view, the present defamation action was a `distinct and independent` action
from the earlier civil suit brought by the BSA to enforce their intellectual
property rights (Suit 1596 of 1997). Therefore, whilst the defendants may have
been barred from using the improperly seized documents in that earlier suit,
they were entitled under the rules governing civil procedure to apply for the
necessary documents to defend this action. The applications for discovery were
`not a collateral attack on a final decision nor [were they] an abuse of
process of the court.` Further, the documents sought to be discovered were
relevant, necessary and expedient to ensure a fair disposal of the matter and
to save costs.  
  
The plaintiffs appealed from the decision of the assistant registrar on the
four applications. When the appeals came on for hearing before a judge in
chambers, the three appeals were still pending before the Court of Appeal, and
in view of that, the learned judge adjourned the hearing until the disposal of
the three appeals. However, he expressed a tentative view that he was in broad
agreement with the assistant registrar`s decision.  
  
The three appeals were heard by the Court of Appeal on 18 August 1999, and its
judgment was handed down on 21 September 1999. The court held as follows:
first, the Chief Justice`s order prohibited the use of all documents and
copies thereof obtained in those criminal proceedings, as well as the use of
all information extracted from such documents, for any collateral purpose;
secondly, aside from the Chief Justice`s order, there was an implied
undertaking by the defendants that they would not use the documents or copies
thereof obtained by them in those criminal proceedings in unrelated civil
proceedings (`the implied undertaking`): see **Microsoft Corp & Ors v SM
Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor and other appeals** [1999] 4 SLR 529 .  
  
This court`s decision sparked off a flurry of activity on the part of the
defendants. On 1 October 1999, they filed a number of new applications. First,
there were applications to expunge various portions of the cause papers,
affidavits, documents and submissions which had been filed in court. These
applications were allowed on 13 October 1999 and the expunging exercise was
completed on 4 November 1999. Secondly, they filed two applications in CM 6
and 7/99 for a variation of the Chief Justice`s order to the extent that the
defendants be allowed to refer to and rely on the documents and information
therein solely for the purposes of defending the present defamation action and
also for a release from or a variation of the implied undertaking for the same
purpose. While these applications were pending before the learned Chief
Justice, the applications for discovery and striking out were restored for
hearing before the learned judge on 5 October 1999. He allowed all the appeals
of the plaintiffs with costs. In other words, he refused discovery and struck
out the applications for discovery. In his grounds of decision, he said at
[para ] 3:

> _Learned counsel for the defendants did not submit that the Court of Appeal
> decision [in CA 37, 38 and 39/99] did not have the effect of binding me in
> the present matter to a decision in favour of the plaintiffs. For my part, I
> am satisfied that the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal is
> clear, ie that the defendants are bound by an implied undertaking not to use
> the documents and information seized in the raid for any other purpose
> including their defence in this action. As the defendants are not permitted
> to use those documents for the purposes of their defence in the present
> action, they are not entitled to the order for discovery that they seek ..._

  
  
Against this decision, the defendants now appeal to this court. Four appeals
have been filed, namely, CA 176-179/99. In CA 176 and 178/99, the defendants
appeal against the High Court`s decision disallowing the discovery of the
documents sought on the ground of the implied undertaking, and in CA 177 and
179, they appeal against the court`s decision striking out their applications
for discovery of documents.  
  
In the meanwhile, on 27 October 1999, the defendants` applications in CM 6 and
7/99 for a variation of the Chief Justice`s order and for a release or
variation of the implied undertaking were heard before the Chief Justice and
were dismissed: **Microsoft Corp & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor**
[2000] 1 SLR 343 . The defendants appealed and their appeals were dismissed by
this court on 9 March 2000, on the ground that there was no appeal against
such an order of the High Court and this court had no jurisdiction to hear the
appeals: **Microsoft Corp & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor** [2000] 2 SLR
137 .  
  
**_The appeals_**

****

We turn first to the appeals against the decision below refusing the
application for discovery, namely, CA 176 and 178/99. These appeals raise two
questions: first, whether as a matter of principle the defendants have a right
to discovery of any of the documents falling with the ambit of the Chief
Justice`s order and/or the implied undertaking; and second, if the answer is
in the affirmative, whether the defendants are entitled to the discovery of
all or any of the documents sought. As for CA 177 and 179/99 which relate to
the striking out applications, the question raised is whether it can be said
that the applications for discovery were an abuse of process of the court,
scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and that they might prejudice, embarrass
or delay the fair trial of the action. To some extent, the answer to this
question depends on the outcome of CA 176 and 178/99.  
  
**_The defendants` case_**

****

The defendants` case is that they first acquired information about the
documents which they are now seeking discovery before the raid was carried out
on the plaintiffs` premises on 12 August 1997. This information came from
three sources. First, there was information from Pan Wen Hui (`Pan`), a former
employee of the plaintiffs. Pan was employed by Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd
(`Summit CD`) between 28 July 1995 and 12 September 1996. During this period,
he worked at their premises at 45 Ubi Road 1, being engaged at various times
in different stages in the manufacture of CD stampers. In his affidavit of 18
September 1998, he deposed to, inter alia, the following at [para ] 24:

> _I also noticed that some of [Summit CD`s] Order sheets had customers such
> as `Ivan Yee`, `PLL`, `Power Multivision`, and `Hardware House` listed on
> them. These were some of the regular customers._

  
  
The second source of information came from another former employee of Summit
CD, Shi Jian Chuan (`Shi`). Shi was employed by Summit CD from 25 April 1996
to 30 April 1997. He too worked at their premises at 45 Ubi Road 1, however,
unlike Pan, Shi was employed in the CD replication division. Through Pan, Shi
provided BSA with a list of some of the plaintiffs` customers, together with
information about CD masters produced for those customers. According to a
statutory declaration sworn by him on 24 July 1997, he had copied a list from
a computer in the plaintiffs` premises in or about March 1997, which appeared
to be a document comprising approximately 500 printed pages of information
about orders made by various customers of the plaintiffs, including references
to the following entities or persons: `Hardware House`, `Ivan Yee, `PLL`,
`Power Multivision`. The list also provides the titles of various CD-ROMS
which the plaintiffs allegedly replicated for these customers.  
  
Finally, there was the information provided by a private investigator, Jimmy
Chew Chong Poh. Chew was engaged by the BSA to verify their suspicions about
the allegedly illicit activities of the plaintiffs. In a statutory declaration
sworn on 30 July 1997, he said he brought eight counterfeit masters of CD-ROMS
to the plaintiffs and invited them to replicate those masters, which they did.  
  
Mr Elias, counsel for the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants, points out that
the defendants have pleaded the information concerning the documents sought in
their re-amended defence filed jointly by the defendants: see [para ] 8(2),
8(3)(i), 8(3)(ix) and 8(7) of the defence (as amended). Given that the
defendants had information on the alleged software pirates before the Summit
raid, and that the information has been pleaded, Mr Elias argues that the
implied undertaking should not diminish or in any way affect the defendants`
rights to discovery in these proceedings.  
  
Mr Elias relies on **Sony Corp v Time Electronics** [1981] 3 All ER 376[1981]
1 WLR 1293. In that case, the plaintiffs were manufacturers of cassette tapes.
On evidence given in camera by the plaintiffs against the intended defendant
(no writ had been issued yet), the court ordered the defendant forthwith, on
service of the order, to disclose to the person serving the order the names
and addresses of the defendant`s suppliers and to produce certain documents
and to deliver up to him the apparently improper goods. The order was subject
to undertakings by the plaintiffs, including an undertaking not without leave
of the court to use any document or information obtained as a result of the
execution of the order, save for the purpose of civil proceedings against the
defendant in connection with the subject matter of the action. On visiting the
defendant`s premises, the solicitor serving the order found out that not only
goods of the type to which the order related, but also other goods of a type
manufactured by the plaintiffs, which he thought might be counterfeit. The
solicitor instructed an employee to make a test purchase of the goods, which
was carried out and the goods so purchased turned out to be in fact a
counterfeit. The plaintiffs therefore wanted to commence another action
against the defendants in respect of these goods, and they applied for a
second order similar to the first one. Goulding J held that the proposed new
action was founded not on something the court had ordered to be disclosed in
the earlier order but on evidence provided by the test purchase of the second
type of goods, in respect of which there was only a collateral connection with
the disclosure ordered by the court in the first order.  
  
Turning to the Chief Justice`s order, Mr Elias submits that the learned Chief
Justice in his judgment (in CM 6 and 7/99) in **_Microsoft Corp_** (supra)
made it clear that his order does not prohibit the defendants from alluding to
the existence of information and items which the raiding party saw or observed
in the course of the raid. The learned Chief Justice said at [para ] 44:

> _The Court of Appeal had held that, under the order of court, it was
> impermissible for the respondents to use the documents and copies and
> information derived therefrom in the summary judgment application. It was
> impermissible to**rely on those documents** falling within the order of
> court. However the Court of Appeal had also held that the order of court did
> not prohibit the **existence** of information and items which the raiding
> party saw or observed in the course of execution of the search warrants, or
> to what such party heard and said at the raid._

  
  
Counsel submits that in this application for discovery of the documents, the
defendants are merely **_alluding to the existence_** of those documents.  
  
In conclusion, Mr Elias argues that the defendants are, as a matter of
principle, not barred from seeking discovery of the documents sought whether
by reason of the Chief Justice`s order or the implied undertaking. Mr VK Rajah
for the first, second, third and seventh defendants associates himself fully
with the submissions of Mr Elias.  
  
**_The plaintiffs` case_**

****

The plaintiffs` case is relatively straightforward. Mrs Teh, counsel for the
plaintiffs, submits that this court (in CA 37, 38 and 39/99) in **_Microsoft
Corp v Summit Holdings_** (supra) has confirmed the scope and effect of the
Chief Justice`s order, and also held that the implied undertaking existed. In
view of the Chief Justice`s order and the implied undertaking, there is no
room for the defendants` applications for discovery. The applications are an
attempt to circumvent both the Chief Justice`s order and the implied
undertaking and therefore an abuse of process. For this reason, the
registrar`s appeals were rightly allowed by the High Court.  
  
Mrs Teh cites three cases in support: **Reichel v Magrath** [1889] 14 App Cas
665, **Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police** [1982] AC
529[1981] 3 All ER 727 and **Wright Norman & Anor v Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp Ltd & Anor** [1992] 2 SLR 710 . The first two cases are authority for the
proposition that where an issue has been fully litigated in a case, whether
civil or criminal, it is an abuse of process to attempt to reopen it in
subsequent litigation. This is simply the well known and accepted principle of
res judicata. However, this principle has no application here. In particular,
the question now before us was expressly left open in this court`s decision in
**_Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings_** (supra). We therefore do not find it
necessary to consider these cases further.  
  
The third case has but slight relevance. The facts were briefly these. In
November 1987, a local newspaper reported on efforts of the Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp Ltd (`OCBC`) in recruiting four top executives. Later that month,
one Norman Wright, in his capacity as managing director of an executive search
firm, wrote a letter to the newspaper concerning the recruitment efforts of
OCBC, which was subsequently published by the newspaper. OCBC complained that
the letter was libellous and the newspaper published an apology drafted by the
bank. Wright refused to apologise and the bank commenced an action against him
(`the 1987 action`). Subsequently, Wright took objection to the published
apology and commenced an action for libel against the newspaper and the bank
(`the 1988 action`).  
  
In the 1987 action, Wright applied for interrogatories to be served on OCBC,
and also a further and better list of documents to be furnished by OCBC. Chao
Hick Tin JC (as he then was) refused the applications on the basis that they
amounted to a fishing expedition. Subsequently, in the 1988 action, Wright
applied for further and better particulars and discovery of particular
documents. Karthigesu J (as he then was) held that the application for
discovery was likewise a fishing expedition. However, he went on further to
say that since the appeal in respect of the 1987 proceedings was pending and a
similar application had been refused in the 1987 proceedings, it was not
desirable to grant the application for discovery due to the close connection
between the 1987 and 1988 proceedings. Wright appealed against both the
decision of Chao Hick Tin JC and Karthigesu J and when the appeals on both
cases came before the Court of Appeal, the court held that since both cases
were `inextricably inter-twined`, to allow Wright discovery of the documents
sought in the 1988 action would circumvent the order of court made by Chao
Hick Tin JC in the 1987 action, and that was not permissible. The purpose of
the two applications was identical, and to have allowed the second application
would clearly have rendered nugatory the earlier court order refusing the
first application. That clearly is not the position here.  
  
The success of these appeals depends on the scope of the Chief Justice`s order
and the implied undertaking. We now consider each of these in turn.  
  
**_Chief Justice`s order_**

****

We turn first to the Chief Justice`s order. By this order the learned Chief
Justice ordered the return to the plaintiffs of (i) all documents (and copies)
seized under the third warrant; and (ii) all documents (and copies) seized
under the first two warrants, namely, `the two production log-books for the
incoming master recording, the log book on process for polishing, all sales
orders, invoices, glass master order sheets, seven empty stamper boxes, the
checking report book, and the list of Summit CD`s customers allegedly
downloaded from the petitioners` computer server`. In **Microsoft Corp v SM
Summit Holdings** [1999] 4 SLR 529  we said at [para ] 18:

> _The effect of such order is that all documents and matters falling within
> its ambit, including copies of such documents or matters, had to be returned
> to the plaintiffs. The defendants or any of them were prohibited from making
> copies of such documents or matters; any copies, if made, would come within
> the terms of the order and would have to be returned to the plaintiffs. It
> follows from this that, in effect, the defendants were not allowed under
> that order to use those documents and matters and copies thereof._

  
  
Later at [para ] 21 we said:

> _That order of court, however, has no application to the existence of the
> information and items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course
> of the raid at the premises of the plaintiffs: see [para ] 47 of [the
> learned Chief Justice`s judgment in CM 21/98 [[1999] 3 SLR 197]]. Nor does
> it apply to what such party heard and said at the raid. As to how the
> defendants propose to prove such information or the items and whether such
> information and items are relevant are different questions altogether. They
> relate to admissibility and relevance of the evidence, if any, in relation
> to the information and items. To this extent, we accept the submission of Mr
> VK Rajah, counsel for the first, second, third and seventh defendants, that
> the order does not prohibit the defendants from using information obtained
> during the enforcement action._

  
  
The learned Chief Justice in CM 6 and 7/99 [[2000] 1 SLR 343] also accepted
this position: see [para ] 43 and 44 of his grounds of judgment.  
  
It is important to appreciate that the primary purpose of the Chief Justice`s
order was to remedy an improper seizure of documents by restoring to the
rightful owner his title, possession and right of control over the documents.
The learned Chief Justice in **Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v Business Software
Alliance** [1999] 3 SLR 197  said at [para ] 48:

> _Once there was an order of court ordering the return of the documents (and
> copies), it must follow that it was not open to BSA or its solicitors to
> reproduce the documents in their entirety and use them in civil proceedings.
> The purposes of the order of court were threefold: (1) as a remedy for the
> improper seizure of documents, the seizure being improper because they were
> either not covered under the two search warrants or were pursuant to a
> search warrant that was quashed for want of jurisdiction; (2) to protect the
> owner`s copyright in the documents; and (3) to restore the true owner`s
> title, possession and right of control of the documents._

  
  
It is implicit here that the reason why the defendants were not allowed to
make use of these documents or take copies thereof was that none of them had
any right to these documents (and copies thereof), and that the documents (and
copies thereof) should not have been in the possession, custody or control of
the defendants or any of them in the first place, and therefore the documents
(copies thereof) should be restored to the true owner. That is the true
purpose and scope of the order, and once this is appreciated, it becomes clear
that it is not inconsistent with or in contravention of the Chief Justice`s
order to allow discovery of the documents that had been returned to the
plaintiffs, assuming of course, they are relevant to this suit. In the
circumstances, in our judgment, the Chief Justice`s order does not affect the
defendants` right to discovery of documents in this suit.  
  
**_Implied undertaking_**

****

The difficulty in the way of the defendants` right to discovery is the implied
undertaking which, as will be apparent in a moment, is wider in scope than the
Chief Justice`s order. In **Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings Ltd** [1999] 4
SLR 529 , we said at [para ] 34 and 35:

> _
>
> 34 In this case, however, the documents and information obtained by the
> defendants pursuant to the search warrants taken out under the Criminal
> Procedure Code and the Copyright Act are not sought to be used by them in
> either criminal or civil proceedings in the enforcement of the defendants`
> intellectual property rights, as in **_Ransome/Tempil_**. Such documents and
> information or some of them, at least, are now sought to be used by the
> defendants in civil proceedings, unrelated to the enforcement of their
> intellectual property rights. In these circumstances, it seems to us that
> the same considerations of public interests in the protection of privacy and
> confidentiality of documents and information and in ensuring full and frank
> disclosure of documents and information in the administration of justice,
> which are present in the application of the **_Riddick_** principle, should
> apply. The execution of the search warrants was a clear invasion of privacy
> and confidentiality and the justification for this was the requirement of
> full and frank disclosure for the purpose of administration of justice. But
> such disclosure is to be counterbalanced by the limitation on the use of
> such documents and information to the proceedings in the enforcement of the
> intellectual property rights, and this is achieved in the form of the
> implied undertaking imposed on the recipients. We can see no good reason, in
> principle, why such implied undertaking should not be imposed with full
> force on documents and information obtained pursuant to the search warrants
> issued under the Criminal Procedure Code and/or Copyright Act, as in the
> present case ...
>
> 35 If the defendants had instituted civil proceedings to enforce their
> intellectual property rights and obtained, by the process of discovery,
> documents and information from the premises of the plaintiffs, the
> defendants would undoubtedly be subject to an implied undertaking not to use

The implied undertaking clearly affects the defendants` right to use the
documents (and copies) and information, which they had obtained in or as a
result of the Summit raid for the purposes of the present proceedings. In this
connection, the prohibited information would include information gleaned or
gathered from the documents disclosed as a result of the raid and also
information which the defendants or their representatives gathered from what
they had observed and heard at or during the raid. Both categories of
information came about or were disclosed under the process of compulsion, ie
the Summit raid pursuant to the search warrants. The case of **Taylor & Anor v
Director of the Serious Fraud Office** [1998] 4 All ER 801[1998] 3 WLR 1040,
which we had discussed at great length in **Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings**
[1999] 4 SLR 529 , starkly illustrates this fact. In that case, the
plaintiffs` action was struck out on the basis of the implied undertaking not
to use documents disclosed under compulsion in subsequent proceedings without
the permission of the courts.  
  
Mr Elias submits that the implied undertaking did not apply to information and
items observed during the course of the Summit raid, presumably relying on
what we said in [para ] 21 of our judgment in **_Microsoft Corp v Summit
Holdings_** (supra), which we have quoted in [para ] 25 above. This submission
is misguided. That passage was said with reference to the Chief Justice`s
order and not with reference to or in the context of the implied undertaking.  
  
In our opinion, in so far as the defendants had obtained any information as to
the existence of any documents on the basis of the documents or information
which the defendants obtained pursuant to the search warrants, they are
clearly precluded from seeking discovery of those documents. We think that
there can be no possibility of an application for their discovery on that
basis. In our view, the protection provided by the implied undertaking would
be illusory, if the defendants were able on that basis to obtain discovery of
the documents. In **Sybron Corp & Anor v Barclays Bank plc** [1985] 1 Ch 299,
318, Scott J said:

> _If the [implied] undertaking against improper use were to be limited to the
> documents themselves it would represent a worthless protection. Plainly, in
> my judgment, the undertaking must apply to the**information derived from the
> discovered documents** whether it be information embodied in a copy or
> stored in the mind. Accordingly, references in this judgment to use of
> documents should be taken to include use of **information derived from the
> documents**. [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
Hence, the defendants are precluded from seeking discovery of documents or
categories of documents merely on the basis they had in the pleadings alluded
to the existence of such documents, particularly when such pleadings were
filed after the Summit raid. They must go further and show that they came upon
these documents or categories of documents through means other than the Summit
raid.  
  
It follows that where the documents are sought by the defendants on the basis
of information that was acquired independently of the Summit Raid, whether
before or after raid, the defendants would clearly be entitled to apply for
discovery of such documents. The reliance on such independent information does
not in any way infringe the plaintiffs` right to privacy and confidentiality
in the documents which the implied undertaking seeks to protect. The case of
**_Sony Corp_** (supra) illustrates the point. It was there held by Goulding J
that the second action against the defendant was not founded on what was
disclosed in the first action, but on the test purchase which was made as a
result of what the solicitor saw in the course of serving the documents on the
defendants pursuant to an order of court in the first action. The learned
judge said at p 1295:

> _In my view I ought not to refuse the plaintiffs the relief they seek. The
> new action is not founded on something that the court ordered to be
> disclosed in the earlier order. The real foundation of the present action is
> the evidence obtained on the test purchase. The observation by the solicitor
> of suspect goods, of the second class, was a merely collateral matter in the
> execution of the order of 12 March and did not depend on that order for its
> justification. In other words a solicitor saw something that was there but
> it was not something that the court had ordered to be disclosed. He then
> obtained the evidence, which is sufficient in itself, by a test purchase._

  
  
We are therefore of the view that so long as the information as to the
existence of any documents was obtained by the defendants independently of the
Summit raid, the defendants are entitled to apply for discovery of documents
based on such information.  
  
It is part of the case of the defendants that they acquired the information of
the documents they now seek discovery independently of the Summit raid. They
rely on the evidence of Pan, Shih and Chew and say that they obtained the
information from these persons: see [para ] 13-15 above. On the basis of these
three sources of information they now seek discovery of the documents. In
principle, we think that their case for discovery is well founded, and on that
basis, they are entitled to apply for discovery of documents.  
  
**_The relevancy_**

****

We now come to the documents the defendants seek from the plaintiffs. The
question is whether the documents sought satisfy the test of relevancy. Before
us, Mr Elias concedes that categories (2), (3) and (5) set out in [para ] 5
above are far too wide, and accordingly says that the defendants would be
content with categories (1) and (4). His case is that the entities listed in
these paragraphs were `known software pirates`, and obtaining documents
relating to Summit CD`s involvement with them is therefore essential to
sustaining their plea of justification. He relies principally on two
authorities. First, **Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v
Peruvian Guano Co** [1882-83] 11 QBD 55, where Brett LJ laid down the
following test:

> _What are the documents which are documents relating to any matter in
> question in the action? ... the documents to be produced are not confined to
> those, which would be evidence either to prove or to disprove any matter in
> question in the action ..._

> _It seems to me that every document relates to the matters in question in
> the action, which not only would be evidence upon any issue, but also which,
> it is reasonable to suppose, contains information which**may** \- not which
> **must** \- either directly or indirectly enable the party requiring the
> affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his
> adversary. I have put in the words `either directly or indirectly,` because,
> as it seems to me, a document can properly be said to contain information
> which may enable the party requiring the affidavit either to advance his own
> case or to damage the case of his adversary, if it is a document which may
> fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have either of these two
> consequences ..._

  
  
Mr Elias submits that the documents within categories (1) and (4) clearly
satisfy this test.  
  
The second authority is the recent case of **McDonald`s Corp & Anor v Steel &
Anor** [1995] 3 All ER 616. That case concerned a libel action brought by the
hamburger giant, McDonald`s, in respect of serious allegations by the
defendants about the operation of their fast food restaurants, which
allegations had been published in a leaflet and distributed in the United
Kingdom. The defendants pleaded justification and fair comment in their
statement of defence and in response to a number of interlocutory directions
served better and further particulars of their defence. They sought further
discovery from the plaintiffs, but their application was adjourned until both
parties had served full statements of all witnesses upon whose evidence they
intended to rely at trial. After service of the witness statements the
plaintiffs applied to strike out certain parts of the defence and particulars
of justification and fair comment. The judge ruled that he would decide the
striking out application before considering the defendants` application for
further discovery, on the basis that it would be an abuse of process to allow
the defendants to put forward a plea of justification when they had no clear
and sufficient evidence to support it in the hope that discovery would then
force the plaintiffs to produce the necessary evidence which the defendants
themselves lacked. The judge heard the application and made an order striking
out substantial parts of the defendants` pleadings. The defendants appealed.
The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held that a plea of justification
was not required to be supported by `clear and sufficient` evidence before
being properly placed on the record. Such a plea could be included in the
defence so long as the following criteria were satisfied: (a) the defendants
should believe the words complained of to be true, (b) the defendants should
intend to support the plea of justification at the trial, (c) the defendants
should have reasonable evidence to support the plea or reasonable grounds for
supposing that sufficient evidence to prove the allegation would be available
at the trial.  
  
Mr Elias submits that the requirements set out above are satisfied on the
facts. The particulars of justification state that Summit CD `habitually
accepted, processed and delivered orders for stampers and CD-Roms` from the
alleged software pirates. These particulars were pleaded on the basis of the
information provided by Pan and Shi and were therefore well grounded. The
defendants are therefore entitled to discovery of documents to substantiate
what they have pleaded.  
  
We are unable to accept this argument. Whilst the particulars of justification
do clearly refer to dealings with the alleged software pirates, this alone
does not give the defendants carte blanche to empty the plaintiffs` filing
cabinets. In defamation actions, the **_Peruvian Guano_** principle is subject
to the well established rule that a defendant is not permitted to mount a
fishing expedition through the discovery process in the hope of finding
something to justify his libellous words. The documents in category (1) are
described as `All the invoices, sales orders, delivery orders and/or
correspondence` of Summit CD relating to the alleged software pirates. That is
a remarkably wide class of documents which would encompass any letter or note
on any matter whatsoever between Summit CD and the alleged pirates. The lack
of specificity in this regard can only lead us to infer that, in fact, the
defendants have no knowledge of any particular transactions which would
substantiate their plea of justification. That being the case, they are
clearly trying to empty the cupboards in the hope of finding something to
substantiate their plea. This amounts to a fishing expedition. We do not read
**_McDonald`s_** case as saying that by merely pleading that a particular fact
is true, a defendant in a libel action is entitled to obtain by discovery all
the plaintiff`s documents to see whether there is anything in them to sustain
the plea. All that case says is that a plea of justification will not be
struck out before the trial on the basis that there is no `clear and
sufficient` evidence to sustain it, as some previous authorities seemed to
suggest. In any event, that case did not concern the issue of relevancy of the
documents sought in discovery and is therefore of limited assistance to the
defendants.  
  
The description of the documents sought in category (4) is again far too wide
and is susceptible to the same criticism In our judgment, this category of
documents too must be disallowed.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

The defendants have a right to seek discovery of documents on the basis of the
independent information which they have obtained. To that extent, the
defendants succeed in CA 176 and 178/99. But the documents or the categories
of documents sought by the defendants are much too wide and on that ground the
applications for discovery would fail.  
  
Now, the question is what order we should make. If we dismiss the
applications, the defendants are, of course, at liberty to take out fresh
applications for discovery and the applications will then traverse the usual
path all the way from the assistant registrar level to this court, a process
entailing considerable time and costs. We think that, in the circumstances, to
save some time and costs below, we make the following orders with reference to
the applications for discovery. First, we set aside the order of the assistant
registrar, except that part of the order relating to the costs he awarded. We
also set aside the order of learned judge below. Secondly, we remit the
applications to the learned judge with liberty to the defendants to file: (i)
a fresh list of documents or categories of documents (in substitution for the
present lists) which they seek from the plaintiffs, and (ii) further
affidavits, if they consider necessary, in support of the documents they wish
to have discovery, bearing in mind what we have decided in relation to their
right of discovery. Hopefully the defendants would in such event provide some
specificity in the documents which they seek. The defendants are hereby given
21 days from the date hereof (or such extended time as the learned judge may
permit) to file a fresh list, and further affidavits, if any, for
consideration by the learned judge, and upon such documents being filed, or in
default of such filing within the time sated, the applications for discovery
be restored for hearing before the learned judge.  
  
**_Civil Appeals 177 and 179/99_**

****

We now turn to CA 177 and 179/99 which are appeals against the order striking
out the defendants` applications for discovery. We do not understand why the
applications for striking out were made in the first place. First, as of the
date when the applications for discovery were filed by the defendants they
were clearly entitled as a matter of right to make the applications, as the
court below had held that defendants were not precluded from relying on the
documents they had obtained at the Summit raid. It may be that the classes or
categories of documents which the defendants sought might be too wide but that
per se would not warrant an application to be filed for striking out.
Secondly, even if the defendants were not entitled to discovery of any of the
documents sought, the appropriate stand for the plaintiffs to take was to ask
for the applications to be dismissed. In our opinion, the applications for
striking out filed by the plaintiffs are wholly unnecessary. A fortiori, since
in principle there is no objection to the discovery applications, the striking
out applications were clearly misconceived, and CA 177 and 179 are therefore
allowed. We set aside the order made below and dismiss the plaintiffs`
applications for striking out.  
  
**_Costs_**

****

We now come to the question of costs. With regard to CA 176 and 178/99, since
the defendants succeed in part, namely, on the issue as to their right to
discovery, they should be entitled to some costs here and before the learned
judge. We order that they should be awarded two-thirds of the costs before us
and before the learned judge, but only one set of costs is allowed to the
defendants. The order as to costs before the assistant registrar is to stand.
The deposits in court as security for costs are to be refunded to the
respective defendants or their solicitors.  
  
Turning to CA 177 and 179/99, we award to the defendants the costs of these
appeals and the costs before the learned judge, but only one set of costs is
allowed. The deposits in court as security for costs in these appeals are to
be refunded to the respective defendants or their solicitors.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
