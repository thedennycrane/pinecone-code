Court of Appeal — Civil Appeals Nos 7 and 8 of 2019

Tay Yong Kwang JA (delivering the judgment of the court ex tempore):

1 We agree with the Judge on all his findings set out in his judgment in
[2018] SGHC 273, except the formula for computing the share of profit for the
plaintiff (“GREIH”) in the Originating Summons, arising from the sale of Big
Hotel in September 2015. The said formula is set out at [99] of the judgment
and is reproduced below. In the formula, the $10m is the amount that the
defendant (“ERCU”), received knowingly from GREIH and which was loaned from
GREIH to ERCU in breach of fiduciary duties owed by Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon.
The $103m is the purchase price for Prime Centre (before it was re-developed
into Big Hotel), the UOB-ERCU Loan refers to the bank loan of $77.25m taken
out by ERCU for the said purchase and the “Expenses” were sums incurred by
ERCU in respect of the re-development of the property (explained further
below). The $203m refers to the sale price of Big Hotel.

2 The formula set out by the Judge was as follows:

$10m

\----------------------------------------------------- X ($203m minus $103m
minus [($103m minus UOB-ERCU Loan), Expenses)

add Expenses]

3 The Expenses incurred by ERCU (as set out at [64] of the judgment)
comprised:

(a) costs incurred in re-developing Prime Centre;

(b) interest expenses incurred in 2014 and 2015 on loans obtained to finance
the re-development of the said property; and

(c) management fees incurred in 2014 and 2015 for the management of Big Hotel.

4 GREIH’s appeal is that the Expenses should not feature in the first half of
the equation and should rightly feature only in the second half of the
equation in order to arrive at the net profit. We agree with GREIH that the
Judge’s formula results in double-counting of the Expenses in that the
Expenses were used as part of ERCU’s capital contribution to the acquisition
costs for Prime Centre and then deducted from the sale price for Big Hotel to
arrive at the net profit. However, we agree with the Judge that the Expenses
which were incurred to earn the returns from the investment in re-developing
Prime Centre into Big Hotel and eventually selling it at a profit must
logically be taken into account in arriving at the net profit from the sale.
If these expenses had not been incurred, there would have been no Big Hotel to
sell and no case was put forward that the property would have fetched a resale
price of $203m even without re-development into Big Hotel.

5 One of the points in ERCU’s appeal is that the UOB-ERCU Loan should not be
deducted in the first half of the formula. We agree with ERCU on this issue.
We do not share the Judge’s view that the UOB-ERCU Loan of $77.25m should not
be attributed as ERCU's contribution to the acquisition of the property or as
part of the total acquisition costs. While ERCU could not have made the entire
initial down payment (a necessary condition before it could draw down on the
UOB-ERCU Loan) without GREIH’s $10m, GREIH's $10m would have been equally
useless in the acquisition of the property without the said bank loan which
was many times more in amount. Both amounts were needed to complete the
purchase and the acquisition of Prime Centre for re-development.

6 This is not a case of ERCU, as a knowing recipient, using trust money as its
contribution to the acquisition of the property. GREIH's $10m was used only to
supplement the bank loan already obtained but which could not be drawn down
because the investors in Big Hotel had not paid up fully on their financial
commitments at that time. ERCU's contribution was the bank loan amount for
which it was liable to the bank although secured by the mortgage on the
purchased property. Although both amounts were used for the purchase, they
were still clearly separate and identifiable. The bank loan was therefore an
untainted contribution, unlike cases where trust money was misused and then
used as the wrongdoer's purported full or partial contribution towards some
asset, which obviously could not be correct in principle as the wrongdoer
would be using his own wrong to establish a legal right.

7 The result is that the formula should read as follows:

$10m

\----------- X ($203m minus $103m minus Expenses) $103m

8 We therefore allow GREIH's appeal in CA 7/2019 and hold that the Expenses
item should not feature in the first half of the equation and that it should
rightly be factored in only in the second half of the equation in the formula
for computing the net profit. We allow partially ERCU's appeal in CA 8/2019 by
not deducting the UOB-ERCU Loan in the first half of the equation. We think
the net result accords with equity and is a fair outcome in the overall
circumstances of this case.

9 On the issue of costs, the Judge's order of $20,000 and disbursements in
GREIH’s favour is to stand. For the hearing in the Court of Appeal, in the
light of our decision set out above, we think it would be fair to order the
parties to bear their own costs for the cross-appeals. The parties have no
objections. Each party is therefore to bear its own costs for the cross-
appeals. The usual consequential orders are to apply.
