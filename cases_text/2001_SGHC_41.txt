**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. This was a petition to wind up a company on the "just and equitable
ground" under s 254(i) of the Companies Act, Cap 50. The company called Sen
Art Pte Ltd was incorporated on 12 March 1988 and carried on the business of
renovation contractors. There were four shareholders divided into two
factions, one consisted of Tan Ban Gee and his wife Loh Kin Hoe and the other
Teoh Keng Lee and his wife Lim Sew Kee. Each camp held 250,000 of the 500,000
paid up shares. The chairman of any board meeting was to be elected by the
board from time to time and he has the casting vote.

2\. The company appeared to be profitable and although there were creditors,
both sides acknowledged that the claims would easily be met.

3\. The problems between the two factions arose mainly from the relationship
between Tan and a company called Dcor Construction Pte Ltd. Teoh made
allegations of improper enrichment of Tan by Dcor and so, with Lim, he
commenced an action by Originating Summons (No. 1923 of 2000) against Tan and
Loh. In that originating summons, Teoh and Lim prayed for various orders in
connection with the dealings between Tan and Dcor. These included a prayer
that Tan and Loh account for all benefits received by them from Dcor, and a
declaration that the transactions between Tan and Dcor were void. The main
relief sought by Teoh and Lim was to wind up the company. They had included an
alternative prayer that the court orders one faction to buy up the shares of
the other. However, at the hearing of the petition and the originating summons
(which was ordered to be heard together with the petition), counsel reported
that the two factions refused to discuss the purchase of the others
shareholding.

4\. It is apparent that this company was a quasi-partnership between two
husband-and-wife teams. The relationship had broken down, if I may adopt the
language from matrimonial law, irretrievably. The companys affairs
deteriorated to a standstill because the two factions would not meet or talk
and consequently no board meeting could be conducted because they could not
agree on the appointment of a chairman. It was not only a deadlock situation,
but from the affidavits filed, the company was clearly brain-dead since 10 May
2000. The two factions would only communicate with each other through their
solicitors.

5\. In such circumstances, the courts had consistently taken the pragmatic
solution of winding up the company. This approach was summed up in the
judgment of Yong J (as he then was) in _Chua Kien How v Goodwealth Trading Pte
Ltd[1991] 2 MLJ 314, 320 _as follows:

> "For a court to refuse to order a winding up and in effect for the warring
> parties to continue in partnership, when, as in the present case, it is
> clear that the parties can no longer work together would merely be to
> endorse an exercise in futility".

The appeal against that decision was dismissed. See _[1992] 2 SLR 296_.

6\. Mr. Ng submitted that if the matters alleged by Teoh in his originating
summons are investigated, and for which he asked for time to do so, it will be
seen that Tan came to court with soiled hands and that, Mr. Ng argued,
disentitles him to the equitable relief of winding up on a just and equitable
ground. In my view, the allegations of misconduct or unjust enrichment by Tan,
even if proved, do not detract from the question whether this company ought to
remain in existence. Indeed, Teohs own purpose in taking out the originating
summons was to wind up the company under s 216 of the Companies Act.
Unfortunately, he did not have sufficient proof to proceed and needed time. In
these circumstances, I see no reason why the company should be kept on life-
support by the court so that Teoh can revert weeks or months later just to
terminate it on his terms. I, therefore, ordered the company to be wound up
under s 254 of the Companies Act.

7\. The matters alleged in the originating summons by Teoh are matters which
involved a dispute of fact and law and ought properly be pursued by a writ
action. Since the claims were made against Tan and Loh personally, I take the
view that the originating summons should be dismissed without prejudice to the
rights of Teoh and Lim to proceed against Tan and Loh on the substantive
matters alleged therein.
