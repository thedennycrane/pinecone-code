**_The facts_ **

****

The facts set out in the prosecution`s statement of facts were admitted by
Chew. On 26 August 2000 at about 8pm, while investigating a complaint of
illegal horse-betting activities, Jayasaravanan S/O Jayapragasam
(`Jayasaravanan`), a police constable attached to Geylang Police Station, and
two Special Constables, Effendy bin Mohamed Rashid (`Effendy`) and Danker
Clive Harrison (`Danker`), arrived at the vicinity of Block 3, Eunos Crescent.
There were people gathering at the block.  
  
Jayasaravanan noticed Chew holding a black pager in his right hand and
constantly looking at it. Jayasaravanan then instructed Effendy and Danker to
detain him. Chew threw away the black pager and started to run but was
apprehended and handcuffed for loitering for the purpose of betting.  
  
Chew was brought to Geylang Police Station in the police car. Jayasaravanan,
Effendy and Danker were all in the police car with Chew. In the police car,
Chew pleaded for leniency and asked to be let off. He told the police officers
that he had over $3,000 with him and would give them $1,000 if they let him
go. Jayasaravanan told Chew to keep quiet. When Chew insisted, Danker informed
him that it was an offence to bribe police officers.  
  
When the party had reached Geylang Police Station, the police officers brought
Chew to their room. Chew asked Effendy to close the door and, when the door
was closed, he took out a $1,000 note and placed it in front of Jayasaravanan.
Jayasaravanan asked Chew to take the money back but he refused and pleaded to
be released unconditionally. It was then that Jayasaravanan arrested Chew for
trying to bribe him. The $1,000 note was seized and Chew was charged
accordingly.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

Chew pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to a fine of $6,000 and in
default six months` imprisonment by district judge Seng Kwang Boon (the
`judge`). The $1,000 `bribe money` was ordered to be forfeited. In sentencing
Chew, the judge considered these factors:

(i) Chew had pleaded guilty to the offence;

(ii) Chew had no similar convictions previously although he had previous
convictions for cheating and other offences;

(iii) the offence was not premeditated and Chew had committed the offence to
avoid being charged for illegal punting, a relatively minor offence (he was in
fact fined $2,000 for illegal punting);

(iv) the gratification offered was a small amount; and

(v) although Chew was trying to bribe a police officer, such acts would not
succeed as our police officers are of the highest calibre.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

The prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by the judge on Chew,
contending that the sentence was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of
the case and that a deterrent custodial sentence ought to have been imposed on
Chew.  
  
In seeking a custodial sentence to be imposed on Chew, the prosecution
contended, inter alia, that the judge had failed, in sentencing Chew, to
adequately consider that Chew`s conduct was potentially highly prejudicial to
the administration of criminal justice in Singapore as he had attempted to
subvert the proper course of police investigations with his offer of a bribe
to the police officer. I agreed with this submission. There is no doubt that
attempting to bribe a law enforcement officer and interfering in the proper
course of police investigations is a serious offence. Generally, corruption
offences involving law enforcement officers or other public servants attract
harsher penalties and custodial sentences as compared to similar offences
committed in commercial dealings and in the private sector.  
  
For corruption offences under the PCA which involve government servants, the
norm is a custodial sentence and it is departed from where the facts are
exceptional. For example, in **Meeran bin Mydin v PP** [1998] 2 SLR 522 , the
appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges of bribing an immigration officer
and was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each charge.  
  
There is no doubt that an element of public interest exists in corruption
offences involving the bribery of a public servant and that the courts have
taken a stern view of such offences. In view of this public interest in
stamping out bribery and corruption in the country, especially in the public
service, a deterrent sentence for such offences is justified. The severity of
the sentence imposed, however, would depend on the facts of each individual
case.  
  
In the present corruption offence, Chew had voluntarily offered the police
officer a bribe without any solicitation. In such circumstances involving an
attempt to bribe a law enforcement officer and undermine the administration of
justice, I had no doubt that a custodial sentence was warranted. The
aggravating and mitigating factors were then considered in determining the
length of the custodial sentence.  
  
**_Mitigating factors_**

****

In sentencing Chew, the judge had considered that his plea of guilt was a
mitigating factor. In my view, however, in the circumstances of the case,
Chew`s plea of guilt was of little mitigating value as the case against him
was clearly made out. In pleading guilty, he must have known that the
prosecution would have had no problem in securing a conviction in view of the
evidence. The three police officers, Jayasaravanan, Effendy and Danker, were
all in the police car with Chew when he first offered the gratification to
them and they would all have been able to testify against him.  
  
It is clear that not every plea of guilt by an offender should carry weight as
a mitigating factor. In **Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP** [1990] SLR 1011
(Unreported) Chan Sek Keong J commented at [1990] SLR 1011, 1014; [1991] 1 MLJ
321, 322-323:

> _... the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in
> court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation as they may
> be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his
> wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and weight to be placed on
> them must depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not see any
> mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is
> surrounded and has no means of escape, or much mitigation value in a
> professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that
> the game is up._

  
  
Further, in **Fu Foo Tong & Ors v PP** [1995] 1 SLR 448  at p 455, Karthigesu
JA said:

> _... It is not axiomatic that every plea of guilt `entitles`, as it was
> contended by counsel to a discount of between one-quarter to one-third of
> what might otherwise be considered an appropriate sentence after a trial. A
> plea of guilt can be of no mitigating value, for example, when the evidence
> overwhemingly supports a conviction._

  
  
In sentencing Chew, the judge also considered the fact that the offence was
not premeditated and that Chew had committed the offence to avoid being
charged for illegal punting, a relatively minor offence. However, in my view,
the judge had omitted to consider and address the fact that Chew had
repeatedly attempted, despite being warned against it, to bribe the police
officer into releasing him from custody.  
  
In corruption offences, givers who act in a moment of fear to avoid a minor
transgression of the law would not be treated with the same severity as
acceptors who in most situations would be motivated by greed. However, this
did not help Chew in this case. Although he might have been desperate at first
to avoid being charged for illegal punting, his fear and desperation were not
an excuse for him to stubbornly persist in trying to bribe the police officer
even after he had been warned several times. In my view, the judge should not
have considered Chew`s lack of premeditation and fear of being charged as a
mitigating factor in this case.  
  
Further, the judge considered that there was no adverse consequence of Chew`s
act by stating that, although Chew was trying to bribe a police officer, such
acts would not succeed as our police officers were of the highest calibre. The
judge appeared to have given Chew credit for the high moral calibre of the
police officers when none was due. Although Chew`s attempt to bribe the police
officer did not succeed, the fact remained that such an attempt was carried
out with a mind to subvert the course of justice. There was no reason why Chew
should be given credit for the refusal of the police officer to accept the
bribe. Therefore, the fact that there were no actual consequences of Chew`s
act should also not be a mitigating factor in this case.  
  
As for Chew`s record of previous offences, the prosecution submitted that the
judge had failed to attach due weight to Chew`s antecedents, especially his
previous conviction for an offence of cheating. To my mind, however, it was
clear that none of Chew`s antecedents (which included, inter alia, using a
forged document, cheating and possession of counterfeit currency) had any
bearing to the present offence of corruption for which he was being charged
and this fact was not an aggravating factor in sentencing Chew. This was in
line with the principle enunciated by the Court of Appeal in **Roslan bin
Abdul Rahman v PP** [1999] 2 SLR 211 . In that case, the appellant pleaded
guilty in the High Court to the charge of robbery causing death under s 394
read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and the trial judge took into
account the appellant`s previous drug-related antecedents during sentencing.
It was held by the Court of Appeal that the appellant`s drug-related
antecedents should have no bearing on the present trial as they were
completely unrelated to the offence with which the appellant was charged.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

In conclusion, I found no reason why a deterrent custodial sentence should not
be imposed on Chew. There were no exceptional circumstances in this case and,
on the facts, I allowed the appeal and sentenced Chew to two months`
imprisonment in addition to the fine of $6,000 imposed by the judge. The
forfeiture of the $1,000, offered to the police officer, as ordered by the
judge remained.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
