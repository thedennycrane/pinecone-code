**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. In this case, the Public Prosecutor appealed against the sentence imposed
on the respondent, Quek Loo Ming, who added methomyl to a bottle of water and
caused the death of Madam Fong Oi Lin and serious injury to two other persons,
namely Mr Richard Ho Sin Shong and Mr Wong Ah Kim. All three victims drank
some water from the contaminated bottle. With respect to the death of Madam
Fong, Quek pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to
murder under section 304A of the Penal Code, Cap 224. He also pleaded guilty
to another charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Mr Ho by dangerous
means under section 326 of the Penal Code. As for the last victim, Mr Wong,
Quek admitted that he had voluntarily caused grievous hurt to him by dangerous
means and consented to having this charge taken into consideration for the
purpose of sentencing.

2\. On 5 August 2002, Quek was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 9 years
with respect to the first charge and 3 years with respect to the second
charge. It was ordered that both sentences were to run concurrently with
effect from 10 January 2002. The deputy public prosecutor, who took the view
that Quek should be incarcerated for a much longer period, appealed against
the sentence imposed on him. We agreed with him and ordered that Quek be
imprisoned for 10 years with respect to the first charge and 5 years with
respect to the second charge. We also ordered that the sentences are to run
consecutively. We now set out the reasons for our decision.

Background

__

3\. Quek, who is 56 years old and holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the
University of Singapore, was formerly employed as a Laboratory Officer at the
Toxicology Laboratory of the Department of Scientific Services ("DSS") for 12
years until June 2000. After his retirement, he served as a volunteer member
of the Bukit Timah Zone 5 Residents Committee ("RC").

4\. Investigations revealed that on 31 December 2001, a New Year’s Eve party
was organised by the RC. The party was to be held at the RC centre on the void
deck of Block 319, Clementi Avenue. At around 4 pm on that day, Quek was asked
by Madam Doreen Lum, the chairperson of the RC, to purchase 20 packets of
chicken rice for a number of people who were helping out at the party. He
bought and delivered the chicken rice but felt aggrieved at having been given
the task without sufficient notice. In fact, he was already quite unhappy with
Madam Lum as he thought that she had taken advantage of him and not given him
sufficient credit for his work.

5\. Quek decided to teach Madam Lum a lesson. He had in his possession some
methomyl, a highly toxic insecticide. This is a controlled poison under the
Environmental Pollution Control Act and is unavailable to the public. He had
obtained the methomyl when he was employed by the DSS as he had been asked to
handle a police exhibit involving methomyl that had been mixed with coffee
drunk by a Filipino maid who committed suicide. He put one teaspoon or less of
the methomyl into a 1.5 litre "Ice Mountain" bottle before filling it up with
water. He then proceeded to the RC centre and placed the bottle of
contaminated water on top of a cabinet, which was directly opposite Madam
Lum’s office. Apparently, the RC centre’s regular supply of mineral water was
placed on top of the said cabinet.

6\. As it turned out, Madam Lum did not drink the contaminated water. Mr Ho
and Mr Wong drank from the contaminated water bottle. Some time later, Quek
saw the said bottle in the refrigerator in the RC centre. He did not remove
the bottle from the refrigerator even though he noticed that some 200 ml of
the contaminated water had been consumed. Subsequently, Madam Fong drank some
of the contaminated water. She found the water smelly and had the presence of
mind to pour it away to prevent others from drinking it. All three persons who
drank the contaminated water became very ill. They lost consciousness and
began to foam at the mouth. All three victims were rushed to the National
University Hospital for emergency treatment.

7\. Madam Fong’s medical report indicated that she had been quite well
although she had a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was a hepatitis B
carrier. When she was admitted to hospital after drinking the contaminated
water, she was drowsy and had bilaterally small pupils. Subsequently, she
became even more drowsy and hypoxemic. She was intubated and was admitted to
the intensive care unit. Investigations revealed a depressed level of
pseudocholinesterase that was compatible with organophosphorous poisoning. She
then suffered a lack of blood supply to her heart and required drugs to bring
up her blood pressure. Her condition continued to worsen and she developed
renal failure. She died on 3 January 2002 at around 1.13 pm. The autopsy
report certified the cause of death as "Bronchopneumonia" and "Acute Methomyl
Poisoning".

8\. The other two victims, Mr Ho and Mr Wong, who were also hospitalised, did
not die but they were dangerously ill and went through much suffering.

9\. In due course, police investigations linked the methomyl to Quek and he
was duly arrested. He contended that he had no intention to kill anybody and
that he had only wanted Madam Lum to have diarrhoea after drinking the
contaminated water.

The trial judge’s decision

__

10\. As Quek pleaded guilty, the only issue before the trial judge was the
imposition of an appropriate sentence. The trial judge noted that the
prosecution had asked him to impose a sentence of life imprisonment or
imprisonment for more than 10 years on Quek to reflect the community’s outrage
and to deter others from attempting to commit the same crimes. However, he
took the view that the facts of this case, including the mitigating
circumstances, marked "the lower end" of the crimes in respect of which Quek
was charged. He pointed out that Quek had an unblemished record and that "he
had hitherto been serving society long and well". He added that he believed
that the remorse felt by Quek was genuine. As for the question of deterrence,
he thought that it would be sufficient for him to "sound the warning to those
who may contemplate a similar mischief that they may be liable to be dealt
with more severely if they do not have similar mitigating factors". As such,
he sentenced Quek to a term of 9 years imprisonment in respect of the first
charge and 3 years imprisonment in respect of the second charge. He ordered
that the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently.

The appeal

__

11\. The deputy public prosecutor, who reiterated that the sentence imposed on
Quek was manifestly inadequate, pointed out that Quek’s act of poisoning the
mineral water cannot be viewed as being on the "lower end of culpability".
This was not a crime that resulted from impulsive behaviour. Quek had ensured
that the methomyl would not be detected easily and he had hoped to snare his
intended victim by placing the deadly bottle of contaminated water in a place
where she was likely to consume it. He ought to have known that there was a
real risk that others might end up drinking the contaminated water. He was not
an amateur who was handling unknown substances. He knew that methomyl had
killed a Filipino maid because he had a role in the investigations relating to
her death and he had taken the poisonous substance home for reasons best known
to himself. It was fortuitous that only three persons drank the contaminated
water because the deceased had the presence of mind to throw away the
contaminated water. Viewed in this light, what Quek did with complete
disregard for the lives and safety of others deserved condemnation in the
strongest possible terms.

12\. The prosecution asserted that a sentence of a longer term of imprisonment
was called for in order to deter others from following Quek’s footpath. He
pointed out that in _Xia Qin Lai v PP_[1999] 4 SLR 343, 356, Yong Pung How CJ
had said as follows:

> > [T]he principle of deterrence (especially general deterrence) dictated
> that the length of the custodial sentence awarded had to be a not
> insubstantial one, in order to drive home the message to other like-minded
> persons that such offences will not be tolerated, but not so much as to be
> unjust in the circumstances of the case.

13\. In the present case, when the effect of remission under the _Prisons
Regulations_ , Cap 247, Regulation 2, is taken into account, Quek may only be
in prison for around 6 years. The deputy public prosecutor rightly pointed out
that such a sentence will send the wrong message to the public regarding the
punishment imposed for causing death by poisoning. Admittedly, Quek has had an
unblemished record. However, it must be borne in mind that in _Sim Gek Yong v
PP_[1995] 1 SLR 537, 541, the question of an accused’s record was put in the
proper perspective when the court noted as follows:

> > Like any other personal factor put forward on an accused’s behalf in
> mitigation, the absence of similar antecedents is something to be taken into
> account by the sentencing court and weighed in the balance against other,
> possibly opposing, factors. The first and foremost consideration in this
> balancing process, however, must be the public interest. Any sentence
> imposed must be such that it enables our criminal law not merely to punish
> crime effectively but also to prevent it.

14\. Quek’s unblemished record must thus be weighed against the heinous act
committed by him. As for whether or not he was genuinely remorseful, the DPP
asserted that if he had really been remorseful, he would have helped his
victims by providing the doctors with information on the specific poison he
had administered to them so that they could have been treated more effectively
at an early stage. He pointed out that Quek did not surrender himself to the
police and was arrested only after investigations linked him to the poison in
question.

15\. In the final analysis, it must be borne in mind that the poisoning of the
water in this case was not done by a layman. It was carried out by a former
laboratory officer who knew that methomyl is a potent poison that had caused
the death of a Filipino maid. Its potency was such that a small amount from
the contaminated bottle was sufficient to lead to the death of Madam Fong and
put the lives of two other victims in grave danger. As Quek had acted with
complete disregard for the lives and safety of others, we agreed with the
prosecution that he should be incarcerated for a longer period than nine
years. We thus sentenced Quek to imprisonment for 10 years for the first
charge and 5 years for the second charge. As the maximum penalty for
committing either of the said offences is life imprisonment, we ordered that
the two terms of imprisonment are to run consecutively.
