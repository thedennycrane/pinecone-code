General Division of the High Court (Family Division) — Divorce Transferred No
2112 of 2021  
Choo Han Teck J  
23 February 2023

22 March 2023 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff (“the Wife”) and the defendant (“the Husband”) were married on
13 March 1999. Their marriage subsisted 22 years. The Husband is 53 years old
and is an ad hoc adjunct lecturer at various universities. Prior to his
retirement in 2018, he was a managing director in a multinational accounting
firm. The Wife is 52 years old and is a human resource practitioner in a
statutory board. They have two children, a son aged 22 and a daughter aged 19
(“the Children”). The interim judgement of divorce was granted on 20 September
2021. The parties agreed to have joint custody of the daughter. They also
agreed that the Husband have care and control over the Children, with
reasonable access be given to the Wife. The remaining ancillary issues are the
division of matrimonial assets and the maintenance for the Children.

2 On the issue of the division of matrimonial assets, the following assets are
in dispute as to their valuation or inclusion in the matrimonial asset pool:

S/N| Asset| Nature of Dispute  
---|---|---  
1\. | Matrimonial Home| Valuation  
2\. | Husband’s alleged investment in the IAP Network  
3\. | Watches and jewellery belonging to the Wife| Inclusion in the asset pool  
  
3 The Matrimonial Home was purchased in about 2008 for $1,280,000.00. The Wife
says that the current value should be $2,080,000.00, based on the valuation
report she obtained from Knight Frank Pte Ltd dated 18 May 2022. The Husband,
relying on a report from Allied Appraisal Consultants Pte Ltd dated 16 August
2021, says that its value should be $1,700,000.00 instead. I accept the Wife’s
valuation of $2,080,000.00 as it is closer to the date of the ancillary
hearing.

4 The second disputed asset is the withdrawal of $67,746.74 on 15 March 2019
from the Husband’s OCBC bank account, which Husband alleges was an investment
in the IAP Network that had failed. The Wife asks for this investment sum to
be added back into the matrimonial pool because the Husband’s explanation for
the withdrawal is not credible. However, the Husband says that he had
exhibited sufficient evidence to refute a prima facie case of dissipation,
and, in any case, there should be no adverse inference drawn because divorce
was not even contemplated when the monies were invested. I agree with the Wife
that the Husband’s explanation is not credible. The only documentary evidence
suggesting that the investment had failed was a letter from one William Vacher
dated 22 February 2022 stating that the investment had failed. Who is Mr
Vacher and what basis does he have to certify that the investment had failed?

5 The money was paid out without any formal documentation such as term sheets
which are common in private equity investments, such as this alleged
investment (based on what Mr Vacher says in his letter). No evidence of
negotiations and correspondence between the Husband and the IAP Network was
documented. How can it be that the first acknowledgement of receipt by the IAP
Network of that money should come 3 years after the money was paid out from
the Husband’s account, and that such acknowledgement comes in the form of a
bare letter exhibited by the Husband with a signature which was
unprofessionally pasted electronically? Furthermore, if the investment had
failed, it is surprising that the Husband did not take any step to recover the
money. Although divorce might not have been contemplated at the time of the
alleged investment, the Wife is entitled to an explanation of significant
drawdowns from the Husband’s bank account, which is a matrimonial asset, for
the purposes of tracing funds into other assets which the Husband may have
acquired. Where explanations are not credible, such as in this present case,
it is appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the Husband. The sum of
$67,746.74 must be added to the matrimonial pool.

6 The final category of disputed assets is the Wife’s watches and jewellery,
which the Husband says are valued at $153,500.00. The Wife says that these
watches should be excluded from the matrimonial pool as they are of low value,
but if the court is minded to ascribe a value to them, they should be valued
at $13,000.00. The Husband concedes that his valuation are mere estimates, and
not supported by independent valuation. Conversely, the Wife had produced
correspondence with pawn shops in support of her valuation. $13,000.00 is low
in comparison to the value of a matrimonial asset pool that is more than
$5,000,000.00 before accounting for disputed assets. Moreover, the parties
have agreed in their submissions to exclude the watches owned by the Husband
from the asset pool. Accordingly, I exclude the Wife’s watches and jewellery
as they are of de minimis value.

7 Accordingly, the pool of matrimonial assets for division is as follows:

S/N| Manner of Holding| Asset| Net Value / in SGD  
---|---|---|---  
1\. | Jointly Held| Matrimonial Home| $2,080,000.00  
2\. | UOB Joint Account| $15,654.27  
3\. | POSB Joint Account| $0  
Sub-total of assets jointly held| $2,095,654.27  
1\. | Husband’s Name| Audi A7 Car| $80,888.00  
2\. | Husband’s OCBC Savings Account| $182.74  
3\. | Husband’s OCBC Current Account | $2,360.72  
4\. | AIA Insurance Policy| $44,433.20  
5\. | Husband’s CDP Account| $861,219.47  
6\. | Husband’s SRS Account | $179,405.53  
7\. | Husband’s OCBC CPF-OA Investment Account| $95,991.24  
8\. | Husband’s CPF Account| $574,539.99  
9\. | Husband’s Loans| -$73,979.78  
Sub-total of assets in Husband’s name| $1,765,041.11  
1\. | Wife’s Name| Wife’s POSB Account| $93,231.36  
2\. | Wife’s POSB Current Account| $0  
3\. | Wife’s OCBC Savings Account| $148,988.40  
4\. | Wife’ Standard Chartered Bank Account| $37,343.98  
5\. | AIA Achiever Plan(Policy No U120437359)| $45,118.91  
6\. | AIA Achiever Plan (Policy No U120721942)| $31,065.78  
7\. | AIA Prime Life Special (Policy No L52456491287)| $87,353.09  
8\. | Great Eastern Dynamic Prolife (Policy No 0020948701)| $31,640.00  
9\. | Great Eastern MaxGrowth Plus (Policy No 1633079-5)| $16,629.66  
10\. | Wife’s CDP Account| $381,396.37  
11\. | Wife’s SRS Account| $25,105.10  
12\. | Wife’s CPF Account| $614,957.89  
Sub-total for assets in Wife’s name| $1,512,830.54  
Dissipated Asset (Husband’s alleged investment into the IAP Network)|
$67,746.74  
Grand Total| $5,441,272.66  
  
8 The parties agree that assets held in their own names are to be counted
toward their financial contribution. The only dispute lies in their
contribution to the matrimonial home and the joint bank account. The Wife says
that the overall ratio for direct financial contribution ought to be 42.39%
(Wife): 57.61% (Husband). The Husband says the ratio of 40.46% (Wife): 59.54%
(Husband) is more appropriate. Given that the ratios were not far apart,
differing by less than two percentage points, it might have been more
expedient and cost-effective to reach a consensus instead of fighting tooth
and nail down to the last percentage point. But the advice of counsel is not a
matter of inquiry before me. Counsel for the Husband, Ms Thian Wen Yi, says
that the contribution for the matrimonial home ought to be $1,145,120.64
(Husband): $491,532.61 (Wife). Counsel for the Wife, Ms Amelia Ang, says that
parties’ respective contribution were $952,092.64 (Husband): $622,760.651
(Wife).

9 The difficulty in counsel’s submissions on both sides lay in their attempt
to quantify the unquantifiable. The matrimonial home was purchased in 2012,
but the mortgage was only fully paid in 2018. With the interest payable
changing every year as the principal amount owing is progressively reduced,
neither party was able to calculate the actual purchase price of the
matrimonial home. The indeterminacy of parties’ contribution is further
complicated by their claim that they applied profits from two property
investments, which themselves were plagued with the same inaccuracy of
approximation, towards the repayment of the mortgage for the matrimonial home.
The Wife, in her written submissions, conceded that “[t]otal payments […] add
up to $1,574,853.25, a reasonable estimate based on the sale price, the loan
quantum […] and the number of years parties paid interest” (sic). The Husband
says that the total payments add up to $1,636,653.25, but also admitted this
was based on multiple approximations of the sale proceeds and contributions to
the previous properties. In my opinion, the lawyers were carrying out an
arithmetic exercise in futility. The more sensible way is to allow some slack
by either side — the give and take, commonly referred to as the broad-brush
approach for attaining a just and equitable division under s 112 of the
Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”): see NK v NL [2007] 3
SLR(R) 743 at [27]-[29].

10 The same difficulty in calculating financial contributions to the
matrimonial home applies to the joint bank account. Not only were the proceeds
of sale of parties’ joint investments deposited into that account, it is also
unclear how much the parties had deposited and withdrawn from that account
over the years. For the above-mentioned reasons, I am of the view that a ratio
of 41.5% (Wife): 58.5% (Husband) would be a reasonable middle ground.

11 As for indirect contributions, the Husband says that the ratio ought to be
80%: 20% in favour of the Husband. On the contrary, the Wife says that a ratio
of 60%: 40% in her favour is appropriate. This was a long marriage of 22
years, with two children who have now grown up. The Husband primarily relies
on the affidavits of the Children to justify his indirect financial
contributions. It is obvious that these affidavits were prepared by counsel.
The first four paragraphs of both children’s affidavit are almost identical.
These were not limited to standard allocution (which the Children would
obviously not be acquainted with), but also extended to personal views of the
children. For example, the son’s affidavit reads:

3 I understand that my parents are going through a divorce, and this has had
an impact on my sister and me. My mother moved out of our home sometime in
March 2021 without informing me. Since then, I have continued living at home
with our father.

4 I would like to continue living with my father after the divorce as he is
always there for me and makes time for me. I would also like to request that I
arrange to meet directly with my mother to meet her, without the need to
stipulate any fixed days and times which would simply not be practical given
that I have a busy schedule and do not wish to spend too much time with her as
I am not that close to her.

The daughter’s affidavit reads:

3 I am aware that my parents have decided to divorce, and this has had an
impact on my brother and me. My mother moved out of our home sometime in late
March 2021 without informing me beforehand, only alerting my brother and I
after she moved out via WhatsApp. Since then, I have continued living at home
with our father.

4 I would like to continue living with my father after the divorce as he is
always there for me and makes time for me. I would also like to request that I
arrange directly with my mother to meet her, without he need to stipulate any
fixed days and times which would simply not be practical given that I am
extremely busy with school, co-curricular and other activities.

12 The Children’s affidavits are one-sided. The Husband’s contributions are
discussed with positive words and an admiring tone, but the Wife (their
mother) is disparaged — even as to her character. I agree with the Wife’s
counsel that these affidavits were probably embellished. Many statements are
either overstated, contradicted by evidence, or concern matters that the
Children could not possibly have personal knowledge of. For example, the
assertion that the Husband was the primary caregiver of the children since
their birth is surely hearsay. It is also undisputed that the Husband had to
be out of the country for extended periods when the Children were growing up.
The Wife had adduced documentary proof of her involvement in the Children’s
life, including their education, getting meals for the family, and managing
the domestic helpers. On the contrary, none of the Children’s affidavits
mention the Wife’s contribution in this regard. More examples in the
Children’s affidavit showing assertions of facts that could not have been
within their personal knowledge, include: (the daughter stating) “I am much
closer to my father than my mother as he has been more involved in my care
since I was born”. The son also says that the pocket money which he received
came from the Husband — that could only have been told to him by the Husband
himself.

13 It may be a fact that the Children are not fond of their mother, or of her
parenting style, but I am of the view that the Wife had discharged her duties
as mother and homemaker. The evidence shows her involvement in the Children’s
lives — their education, well-being and day to day needs. Numerous
correspondence between the Wife and the Children’s school teachers and tuition
teachers were adduced. They show a pattern of dedication over the years to the
Children’s academic and emotional well-being. Just because the Wife’s care and
love went unappreciated, or even rebuffed by her children and husband does not
make them untrue or without value.

14 I accept that the indirect non-financial contributions were provided for
predominantly by the Husband. This is not surprising as the Husband
outstripped the Wife significantly in his earning capacity. Having regard to
the evidence, I am of the view that a fair ratio for non-financial
contribution would be 45% (Wife): 55% (Husband).

15 As this was a long marriage, I accord direct and indirect contributions
equal weight. Each party is thus entitled to the following:

| Wife| Husband  
---|---|---  
Direct Contribution| 41.5%| 58.5%  
Indirect Contribution| 45%| 55%  
Overall Ratio| 43.25%| 57.75%  
Share of the Matrimonial Asset Pool of $5,441,272.66| $2,353,350.43|
$3,087,922.23  
  
16 The next issue concerns the maintenance of the Children. The Husband asks
that the Wife contribute half of the Children’s monthly expenses, which
amounts to $3,711.66 for the daughter and, for the son, $2,240.40 from March
2021 to February 2023 and $2,646.43 from March 2023 onwards. Conversely, the
Wife’s counsel submits that a payment of $400.00 per Child is sufficient to
meet their reasonable expenses.

17 The Husband says that the household expenses of the matrimonial home where
the Children presently reside amounted to $7,126.10. The itemised expenditure
list and my decision is as follows:

S/N| Household Item| Husband’s Position| Wife’s Position| Court’s Decision  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| Wet Marketing| $300.00| $300.00| $2,300.00 for food-related expenses  
2| Groceries from the supermarket, provision store etc.| $1,200.00| $600.00  
3| Daily Meal purchases| $1,500.00| $600.00  
4| Eating Out| $2,000.00| $800.00  
5| Purchases from Pharmacy/ Chinese Medicine Shop e.g. vitamins| $50.00|
$20.00| $50.00  
6| Pet Food| $300.00| $150.00|  Disallowed.  
7| Veterinary cost for the pet| $83.33| $83.33  
8| Utilities | $240.60| $171.60| $240.00  
9| Maintenance of Air-Con & Parts| $100.00| $20.00| Disallowed.  
10| Wear and tear of curtains/covers | $200.00| $0  
11| Breaking down of electronic goods (e.g. tv, video recorder, air
conditioner, fans, CD player, etc.)| $300.00| $100.00  
12| Newspaper| $32.00| $32.00| Disallowed.  
13| Cable TV, Wi-Fi, home phone bill| $159.10| $99.10  
14| Management fund and sinking fund for matrimonial home| $482.44| $482.44  
15| Property Insurance and House Contents Insurance| $83.30| $83.30  
16| Property Tax| $95.33| $95.33  
Total| $2,590.00  
  
18 Maintenance for the child should not include items of expenditure that the
parent with care and control would in any case have to incur even if that
parent did not have care and control. For example, standard household
expenses, such as MCST Fees, property taxes, Wi-Fi, property insurance and
home phone bills, would be incurred regardless of whether the Children live
with that parent. The mere fact that the Children have access and enjoy these
household items does not mean that they are expenses of the Child. These items
would have been paid for by the Husband even if he did not have care and
control of the Children. The economic effect of including these as reasonable
expenses of the Children is to order the Wife to subsidise the Husband’s
living expenses. This is not the purpose of child maintenance, which focusses
on the reasonable expenses of the Children. Conversely, items such as
utilities and groceries can reasonably increase proportionately with the
number of household members. It is in respect of those household items that
the maintenance obligation is reasonably divided among the number of household
members.

19 As for the daughter’s reasonable expenses, the Husband says that it ought
to be $7,423.33 and the Wife says that it is $1,915.70. Maintenance is
ordered, not to indulge the child with luxuries, but to provide for her
reasonable financial needs. Furthermore, maintenance is also not a corporate
reimbursement scheme where every item of expenditure is proved and claimed by
the parent who has care and control of the children against the other parent.
The following items were listed by the parties:

S/N| Daughter’s Expenditure| Husband’s Position| Wife’s Position| Court’s
Decision  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| One-third share of household expenses| $2,375.36| $1,212.36| $863.33  
2| School Fees| $350.00| $0| $0  
3| School Bus| $80.00| $50.00| $80.00  
4| Allowance| $800.00| $0| $800.00  
5| Medical| $16.67| $16.67| $16.67  
6| Hair Cut| $30.00| $10.00| $20.00  
7| Dental| $25.00| $20.00| $25.00  
8| Birthday Cake and Gift| $17.50| $17.50| $17.50  
9| Clothes and Shoes| $62.50| $62.50| $62.50  
10| Holidays and Travel| $166.70| $0| Disallowed.  
11| Chinese New Year Clothes| $33.33| $15.00| $15.00  
12| Food, toiletries, and vitamins| $1,200.00| $120.00| Disallowed.  
13| Tuition| $1,666.67| $0| Disallowed.  
14| Crimson Logic Academic Guidance| $557.96| $0| $0  
15 | Books| $41.67| $41.67| $41.67  
Total| $1,941.67≈$2000.00  
  
20 I have disallowed expenses for holidays and travels as each party should
bear their own costs for the overseas travels that they wish to plan for the
Children. Expenses for food, toiletries and vitamins are disallowed as they
have already been included in the household expenditure. Tuition expenditure
is also disallowed as the daughter has graduated from pre-university
education.

21 Finally, the Crimson Logic Academic Guidance which I have disallowed was a
claim by the Husband that he would spend a total of $26,782.00 for the
daughter’s university admissions, which he has amortised over four years, thus
arriving at $557.96 per month. He says that as of 22 September 2022, two
payments amounting $10,618.80 and $7,079.00 have been made. The fact that an
item of expenditure has been paid for does not necessarily mean that it is a
reasonable expense for which maintenance must be ordered under the Charter:
see WBU v WBT [2023] SGHCF 3 at [9]. Moreover, these payments were made post-
divorce and the decision to incur this expenditure is, in my opinion, a
unilateral decision of the Husband based on his parenting style. The law does
not hold back the Husband from indulging the daughter, but it also cannot
compel the Wife to contribute to such indulgence. In the unfortunate breakdown
of a family, the question of maintenance is limited to a test of
reasonableness. Accordingly, the court will only order divorcing parties to
pay what is reasonable for the child, and no more. The reasonable expenses of
the daughter, as calculated, is $1,941.67 but I will round it to $2,000.00.

22 Having determined the quantum of maintenance, the next issue is how it
ought to be apportioned between the parties. The Wife asks for an order that
she only contribute $400.00 a month to the maintenance of each Child. Counsel
for the Husband relies on the case of TBC v TBD [2015] 4 SLR 59 at [27] for
the proposition that the starting point should be that parents bear the
financial burden of maintenance equally. In my view, the Wife’s position is
too low, but I do not accept the Husband’s position. As Debbie Ong JAD held in
WBU v WBT [2023] SGHCF 3 at [34]-[36]:

34 In my respectful view, TBC was decided on its own facts and should not
stand for the general proposition that equal apportionment is the starting
point. In TBC, the wife’s take-home income was $5,200 and the husband’s take-
home income was $14,075. The child’s reasonable expenses were determined to be
$1,440. Kan J was satisfied that since there was no evidence suggesting that
parties could not afford to bear the child’s expenses equally, to order equal
apportionment for maintenance would not place unequal burdens on the parties
despite the difference in financial means.

35 I am of the view that there should not be a starting point that parents
bear the financial burden of child maintenance equally. While both parents
have the equal parental responsibility to care and provide for their children
(see s 46(1) and s 68 of the Charter), it does not necessarily follow that
every component of this duty must be borne equally in numerical terms, nor is
it possible to divide the parenting duties in strictly mathematical ways.

In respect of maintenance, the Court of Appeal noted in AUA v ATZ [2016] 4 SLR
674 (at [41]):

Undergirding these provisions [ie ss 68 and 69(4) of the Charter] is the
principle which we would, to borrow an expression from another area of the
law, call the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: both
parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their
precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities (see
TIT v TIU [2016] 3 SLR 1137 at [61]). The Charter clearly contemplates that
parents may contribute in different ways and to different extents in the
discharge of their common duty to provide for their children.

36 It would thus be undesirable to assume, as a general rule or a starting
point, that the financial obligation of maintenance should be borne equally in
numerical terms between the parties. Marriage entails both financial and non-
financial obligations – each spouse contributes in different aspects towards
the marriage, and they fulfil different roles according to their individual
capabilities in ensuring the welfare of the child.

[emphasis in original]

23 The Wife’s income based on her 2020 IRAS Notice of Assessment (“NOA”) is
$104,042.00 (averaging $7,048.00 monthly). The Husband asserts that his
earning capacity as $4,222.38 a month, based on his 2021 Income Tax Notice of
Assessment where his assessable income was $75,477.00. On this basis, the
Husband says that parties are of relatively equal earning capacity and are
able to bear the maintenance burden equally.

24 However, what is relevant for the apportionment of the maintenance
obligation is not one’s last earned income, but one’s earning capacity.
Between the two, the Husband’s earning capacity outstrips the Wife
significantly. For Year of Assessment (“YA”) 2017, the Husband’s assessable
income was $472,380.00 (averaging $39,365.00 monthly). In YA 2018, the
Husband’s assessable income was $561,661.00 (averaging $46,805.00 monthly). In
YA 2019, the Husband’s assessable income was $508,960.00 (averaging $42,413.00
monthly). In YA 2020, the Husband’s assessable income was $285,287.00
(averaging $23,773.00 monthly). All this is before accounting for the
Husband’s expansive investment portfolio. Although this is not captured by the
income tax NOAs, investments are nevertheless an income stream that must be
considered when ascertaining the Husband’s earning capacity.

25 I order that the Wife contribute $900.00 for the daughter’s living
expenses. In the circumstances, this is fair and reasonable considering the
disparity in parties’ earning capacity, which is consonant with the Husband’s
own submission on the extent of his indirect non-financial contribution during
the marriage. Although the asset pool that each party is entitled to is
sizeable, a large portion of its value is locked into illiquid assets.

26 As the son is above the age of 21, no order of maintenance shall be made
unless the court is satisfied that the order is necessary: see s 69(5) of the
Charter. As for his daily expenses, the parties have agreed to provide
maintenance for the son, but they dispute the amount to be provided. I am of
the view that having come of age, it cannot be said that it is “necessary”
within the meaning of s 69(5) of the Charter to make an order of maintenance
for the son’s daily living expenses. He had been serving National Service for
the past two years where a reasonable allowance was provided. From the son’s
perspective, the parties’ offer to provide maintenance should be seen as a
privilege, not a right. Since there is no longer a legal obligation to
maintain a child after he becomes an adult, the contributions by the parents
are to be regarded as purely voluntary, at their own discretion. Beyond such
voluntary contributions, the son must learn to be financially independent and
provide for himself. I thus make no order as to maintenance for the son’s
daily living expenses and the parties are free to contribute as they deem
appropriate.

27 Apart from the son’s daily expenses, the second major issue concerns the
costs of tertiary education, which is an item of maintenance which also
concerns the daughter. The Husband says that the Wife should bear half the
expenses of the Children regardless of which university they attend. The Wife
says that what is reasonable in the circumstances is that she bears half the
expenses of local tertiary education. At the hearing before me on 23 February
2023, I directed parties to provide cost estimates of the difference between
local and overseas tertiary institutions. Counsel for the Husband submitted a
table reflecting eight universities which the son has applied to, and all
eight of them cost above S$300,000.00, without including living expenses. Both
parties agree that the fees for a local tertiary institution cost less than
S$50,000.00.

28 In UYU v UYT [2021] 3 SLR 539, I was faced with a similar application, only
that in that case, it was the child himself who took out the application for
maintenance against his own father. I held in that case that:

6 The father and son, who are respectively the appellant and respondent here,
have reached an impasse. The respondent wants to go to Canada for further
studies. The appellant thinks that he should pursue his studies here in
Singapore. In happy families, parents might indulge their children when it
comes to education and would often be the party to give in should their
children appear determined, and the expenses required have been counted.
Parents in broken families, on the other hand, may take a more parsimonious
attitude towards their children’s overseas education since money is often the
subject of disagreement. The availability of comparable local courses,
therefore, becomes a stronger factor, but again, it would still vary from
family to family. The age of the child and the nature of the education add
another dimension to the question. If the child is young, one might also say
that there are strong grounds to keep him here if the parents are not
comfortable sending him to a boarding school overseas.

7 But if the child is older and wishes to pursue an esoteric course like “The
Horticulture of Tropical Orchids”, the choice between a local course and an
overseas one may be more difficult to make – unlike, for instance, a course
leading to a degree in a popular course such as psychology. In this case,
father and son have filed affidavits that their counsel submit support their
respective positions. The appellant claims that there are at least six local
institutions that offer comparable courses in journalism. The respondent
disagrees. This leads to another unenviable position for the court – comparing
and assessing the different courses. In the absence of an expert educationist
or journalist, the court can only compare the different courses in a broad and
general way. Mr Magintharan, counsel for the respondent, and Mr Thirumurthy,
counsel for the appellant, referred to the respondent’s intended course as a
course on “journalism”. “Journalism” is fast becoming an archaic word, not so
much because mainstream journalism is losing space to bloggers and vloggers,
but because it has come to represent only a segment of a much wider course
that goes by different names, depending on the institution in question.

29 Counsel for the Husband told the court that the son wants to read “Sports
Management” in America. In her submissions regarding the cost estimates, she
said that the son is open to other courses such as Business and Economics.
Conversely, the Wife says that the Children should attend university locally.
It appears that once again, the court is asked to resolve a clash in parenting
approaches. The Husband has supported the son in his sporting endeavours since
young and believes that studying “Sports Management” in America is in his best
interests. The Husband’s parenting approach, however, is not shared by the
Wife. In a healthy family, it is likely that such differences can be resolved
— one parent might lead and the other might follow, but eventually, a joint
decision can be made. But the reality of a broken marriage, as in the present
case, is that parents no longer speak in one voice — if they do speak at all.
The court, in deciding the issue of child maintenance, is guided by the
principles of the welfare of the child and of reasonableness. The court is not
the correct forum to endorse one parenting view over another. Thus, careful
consideration must be given when declaring expenses as reasonable in the
circumstances, especially where such a declaration would essentially coerce
one parent into accepting the other’s parenting approach.

30 Here, both parents agree that it is in the Children’s interest to pursue
tertiary education. In my view, local tertiary fees is a reasonable expense.
Should the Husband wish to sponsor the son’s education in America in the name
of love and fulfilment of his sporting dreams, he is, of course, free to do
so. However, a divorce often leaves the parties in unequal financial
positions. In my view, it will not be fair to require the Wife to share in the
sum of S$300,000.00 for the son’s tertiary education. Thus, I order that the
Wife pay half of the costs of local tertiary education regardless of whether
the Children enrol in a local or overseas university.

31 No order is made as to costs.
