** JUDGMENT: **

_

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION** _

The background

_

1\. Indian Bank (the plaintiffs) is a branch of a foreign bank and carries on
banking business in Singapore. At all material times the first defendant
(referred to either as the first defendant or the farm) was a customer of the
plaintiffs and maintained an account with the plaintiffs.

2, The second, third, fourth and fifth defendants were/are directors of the
first defendant at all material times. In addition, the son of the second
defendant one Venkata Chellam (Venkata) is also a director; he is a lawyer
practising in Kuala Lumpur. The second defendant is the wife of the third
defendant while the fifth defendant is the wife of the fourth defendant; the
fourth defendant is the first defendant’s managing-director.

3\. The plaintiffs granted various credit facilities (the facilities) to the
first defendant under several letters of offer the first of which was dated 10
March 1993\. These facilities were (inter alia) secured by personal guarantees
(the guarantees) executed by the second to fifth defendants in favour of the
plaintiffs the last of which was dated 23 March 1997. Under the guarantees,
the defendants jointly and severally agreed to guarantee the due payment by
the first defendant of sums due and owing to the plaintiffs up to the limit of
S$3.6m, plus interest on the principal sums owed.

4\. By letters of demand dated 27 May 1999 addressed to all the defendants by
their solicitors, the plaintiffs demanded payment of the sums due and owing by
the first defendant, pursuant to the facilities granted; none of the
defendants paid on the demand. Consequently, the plaintiffs commenced these
proceedings against all five (5) defendants.

5\. As no Memorandum of Appearance was filed by the second, third and fifth
defendants to the writ after service, the plaintiffs applied for and obtained,
judgment in default of appearance against them on 20 August and 27 September
1999 respectively, on the following terms:-

> a. the sum of S$1,310,701.81 with interest thereon at the rate of 2% per
> annum above the plaintiffs’ prime lending rate from 31 July 1999;
>
> b. the sum of S$252,474.57 and interest thereon at the rate of 3.5% per
> annum above the plaintiffs’ prime lending rate from 31 July 1999;
>
> c. the sum of S$1,650,843.85 and interest thereon at the rate of 2% per
> annum above the plaintiffs’ prime lending rate from 31 July 1999;
>
> d. all solicitor and client costs as provided for in the guarantees against
> the [three] defendants.

6\. Appearance to the writ having been entered for the first and fourth
defendants, the plaintiffs applied for summary judgment against them in the
same terms as the default judgment they had obtained against the second, third
and fifth defendants. The plaintiffs were granted an order in terms of their
application against the first defendant on 21 October 1999.

7\. Meanwhile, on 10 September 1999, the fifth defendant applied (vide summons
in chambers No. 5516 of 1999) to set aside the default judgment the plaintiffs
had obtained against her. On 28 September 1999, the second and third
defendants filed a similar application (see summons in chambers no. 6093/99).

8\. On 1 October 1999, the application of the fifth defendant was heard and
dismissed with costs by the learned Deputy Registrar. Similarly, he heard and
dismissed the same application of the second and third defendants on 21
October 1999. On 21 October 1999, the learned Deputy Registrar also heard and
granted, summons in chambers no. 6473/99 (the plaintiffs’ application) wherein
the plaintiffs applied to strike out paragraph 6 of an affidavit filed by
Venkata on 14 October 1999 on the ground it was irrelevant, scandalous or
otherwise oppressive and ordered costs against the first to third defendants.

9\. Being dissatisfied with the decisions of the learned Deputy Registrar, the
second and third defendants filed Registrar’s Appeal Nos. 440 and 442 of 1999
while the first defendant filed Registrar’s Appeal No. 441 of 1999 and joined
in the appeal under Registrar’s Appeal No. 440 of 1999. I heard and dismissed
all three Appeals on 10 November 1999. The three (3) defendants have appealed
against my decisions (in Civil Appeal Nos. 193 and 194 of 1999). I should add
that the fifth defendant ultimately withdrew her appeal (in Registrar’s Appeal
No. 415 of 1999) against the dismissal of her application to set aside the
default judgment (obtained against her on 20 August 1999).

__

The appeals

10\. The three defendants/appellants were represented by one counsel. He
referred to an affidavit filed by Venkata (on 17 September 1999) to support
his contention that there was merit in his clients’ applications to set aside
the plaintiffs’ judgment as the plaintiffs were involved in a fraudulent
scheme. Counsel submitted that a triable issue was whether the plaintiffs had
knowingly assisted the fourth defendant to commit a breach of trust against
the first defendant which issue is the subject of Suit No. 1153 of 1999 (Suit
1153) in which the first defendant had sued (inter alia) the plaintiffs and
the fourth defendant; that suit is still pending.

11\. In his aforesaid affidavit filed to resist the plaintiffs’ O 14
application against the first defendant, Venkata had exhibited the pleadings
relating to Suit 1153; he contended that the plaintiffs’ facilities should be
set aside for fraud because the plaintiffs were involved in a scheme which
caused the first defendant to suffer losses.

12\. Briefly, in Suit No. 1153 (which was filed one day before this suit), the
first defendant alleged that in March 1997 it was unable to service its loan
facilities with plaintiffs. The plaintiffs requested the first defendant to
inject further funds into the company to regularise its account with the
plaintiffs. The first defendant managed to raise $500,000 which sum was
deposited into its account with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then granted
new facilities to the first defendant which included letters of credit.

13\. The first defendant alleged that between March and July 1997, the fourth
defendant caused numerous invoices totalling $451,000 to be issued in the name
of a business called Muhamed Sheriff Trade Agencies (MSTA) purportedly for
goods sold by the former to the plaintiffs. The fourth defendant caused the
plaintiffs to issue irrevocable letters of credit on the letter of credit
facilities for payment of the invoices of MSTA which sole-proprietor was
Muhamed. Payment of the invoices was to be and was, made against presentation
of delivery orders countersigned by an authorised signatory of the first
defendant. The first defendant alleged that the transactions whereby the
letters of credit were negotiated were fraudulent as the goods or a large part
thereof were never delivered to the first defendant.

14\. The first defendant further alleged that Muhamed had told Venkata that
the letters of credit transactions were effected for the purpose of procuring
money from the first defendant to settle personal loans made by Muhamed to the
fourth defendant. Th first defendant added that the plaintiffs (in particular
their Mr M Nachiappan) well-knew the letters of credit transactions were
fraudulent and carried out without the first defendant’s authority. In support
of this allegation, reference was made to a conversation between Venkata and M
Nachiappan on 31 March 1998 wherein the latter purportedly said that everyone
knew about the letters of credit transactions. The fourth defendant had also
allegedly told the first defendant’s auditors that the letters of credit
transactions were in fact accommodation transactions to raise short term funds
to meet the first defendant’s needs and, they were done with the plaintiffs’
full knowledge.

15\. The alternative contention by the first defendant in Suit 1153 was, that
the plaintiffs and the first defendant had entered into a contract on or about
22 March 1997 whereby it was agreed (for the banking/letter of credit
facilities) that:-

> a. the plaintiffs would not debit the first defendant for the facilities
> without the first defendant’s authority;

> b. the plaintiffs would act in good faith towards the first defendant.

The first defendant alleged that the plaintiffs breached the contract and
their duty by the fraudulent letters of credit transactions.

16\. In answer to the allegations raised in Venkata’s (first) affidavit, the
plaintiffs filed an affidavit affirmed by M Nachiappan, their Assistant
Manager (credit division) which deposed that:-

> a. the conversation on 31 March 1998 took place in the presence of two (2)
> other officers of the plaintiffs, when Venkata came to the plaintiffs’
> office with $725,000 cash to pay into the first defendant’s account to
> settle the company’s long overdue letters of credit transactions (which had
> been converted into trust receipts) totalling $451,000;
>
> b. Venkata has asked the plaintiffs whether they knew of any irregularities
> in the manner of operation of the company’s account which inquiry surprised
> Nachiappan;
>
> c. Nachiappan informed Venkata that by the terms of the plaintiffs’ letter
> of offer dated 16 June 1995, the plaintiffs were to disburse the loan
> directly to invoicing parties who supplied materials to the first defendant
> or machinery to upgrade its farm. However the plaintiffs had, at the first
> defendant’s request, credited certain payments to the first defendant
> instead, on the basis of several letters written by the first defendant to
> the plaintiffs stating the suppliers had already been paid by the first
> defendant. In that context Nachiappan said he might have told Venkata that
> ‘everyone knew’ about the payments being made to the first defendant and not
> the suppliers;
>
> d. however, Nachiappan did not mention letters of credit or any letter of
> credit arrangement in that conversation, neither was he referred to any
> specific letter of credit transaction let alone any scheme by which the
> first defendant had been defrauded. As he had never worked in the
> plaintiffs’ trade department (which receives applications for letters of
> credit), Nachiappan would not know how, when and for what purpose letters of
> credit are issued – his duties were to sanction credit and not monitor the
> day to day operations of any particular facility granted to a customer;
>
> e. neither the first nor the second and third defendants raised the alleged
> conversation with the plaintiffs or with Nachiappan until in writing 18
> months later;
>
> f. neither Nachiappan nor his predecessor (Sundaresan allegedly in March
> 1997) had agreed that the plaintiffs would not exercise their rights on any
> personal guarantee for the facilities granted to the first defendant,
> contrary to the claim made by the second and third defendants in their
> letter dated 3 April 1998 to the plaintiffs;
>
> g. in their reply dated 18 April 1998 to the aforesaid letter, the
> plaintiffs advised that the sum of $725,000 paid in by Venkata did not
> wholly extinguish the sums owed by the first defendant and the plaintiffs
> expected the position to be regularised within 3 months pending which, the
> plaintiffs would not sue on the guarantees although, they reserved their
> rights against the guarantors;
>
> h. the second and third defendants in their further letter dated 2 May 1998
> to the plaintiffs insisted that the plaintiffs had released them from their
> guarantees but they made no mention of any fraudulent scheme;
>
> i. the plaintiffs then replied on 20 May 1998 to reiterate that they had
> never given any assurance the plaintiffs would not exercise their rights on
> the guarantees and making it clear their withholding action for three months
> was not to be construed as a release of any of the guarantors; the
> defendants did not reply to this letter.

17\. The plaintiffs’ general manager V Srinivasan also filed an affidavit (on
11 October 1999) wherein he deposed that:-

> a. Venkata became an authorised signatory of the first defendant’s bank
> accounts on or about 16 April 1998 before his appointment as a director in
> August 1998;
>
> b. the first defendant’s account with the plaintiffs was first opened on 30
> November 1992. As at July 1999, the first defendant owed in excess of $3.2m
> for the banking facilities granted by the plaintiffs and another sum of
> $217,063.58 on the trust receipt facility;
>
> c. Venkata’s allegation that the plaintiffs had participated in a scheme to
> defraud the first defendant of $451,000 was preposterous as the plaintiffs
> are a fully licensed bank in Singapore and are guaranteed by the government
> of India;
>
> d. the directors of the first defendant were unable to operate the farm
> profitably; they were not the founders of the farm but had taken over from
> the original owners in or about December 1994. Had the second to fifth
> defendants conducted a due diligence search on the first defendant before
> they became shareholders, they would have realised the farm’s dire financial
> straits;
>
> e. in 1995 the first defendant’s loans with the plaintiffs were rescheduled.
> By the terms of the plaintiffs’ letter of offer dated 16 June 1995, the
> plaintiffs agreed to grant an initial 6 months moratorium during which the
> first defendant did not have to repay the loans (then amounting to $2.7m)
> but only service the interest;
>
> f. by October 1996, the first defendant was again in arrears on the
> facilities extended by the plaintiffs. Despite repeated notices and
> reminders from the plaintiffs, the second to fifth defendants did not
> regularise the position; the plaintiffs were saddled with the prospects of

>
> g. finally, on 29 November 1996, the fourth defendant replied requesting the
> plaintiffs to again restructure the credit lines of the first defendant; the
> letter stated that attempts made by the defendants to bring in new investors

>
> h. in December 1996 the plaintiffs again wrote to the first defendant asking

>
> i. finally, in March 1997, the first defendant took steps to regularise its

18\. It would be appropriate at this juncture to set out the text of the
letter dated 6 July 1998 of the auditors as it forms the gravamen of the
defendants’ appeal as well as the first defendant’s case against the
plaintiffs in Suit 1153; the letter addressed to the board of directors of the
first defendant states:-

> Dear Sir,
>
> **
>
> Audit of the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 1997
>
> **
>
> In the course of the audit of the accounts of the company for the year ended
> 31 December, 1997, we observed that the company established certain letters
> of credit for certain intended purchases totalling S$320,000. You have
> advised that these were accommodation transactions to raise short term funds
> to meet the needs of the company. You have also confirmed that these moneys
> were deposited into the company’s bank account and the liability to the bank
> has been fully liquidated in respect of these transactions. You further
> advised that these transactions were done with the full knowledge of the
> bank so that your overdue to the bank could be regularised in this till you
> were able to arrange additional funds.
>
> In our opinion, the documentation that we have sighted is not in conformity
> with the substance of what actually took place. As such the bankers may take
> the view that funds are being obtained by the company by producing documents
> that are not reflective of what has actually happened.
>
> As such, we strongly recommend that the company does not enter into similar
> transactions in the future to obtain funding from the bankers unless it
> receives written confirmation from the bankers that they are fully cognizant
> of the nature of the transactions and are willing to make advances knowing
> that the form and substance of the transactions are different.
>
> We are also copying this letter to all shareholders for their information.

19\. A number of observations on the auditors’ letter can be made: Firstly,
the plaintiffs’ disclaimer (in Srinivasan’s affidavit) of all knowledge of the
letter and its contents until they saw it as an exhibit in the defendants’
affidavit was not effectively challenged by the defendants. Neither could the
defendants challenge the plaintiffs’ contention that at no time did Venkata or
his parents or the Jayaram family (fourth and fifth defendants) mention the
letter to any of the plaintiffs’ officers; there was certainly nothing in
writing to prove they did. Secondly, it is significant that all information
contained in the auditors’ letter emanated from the first defendants’
directors although the actual informer was not identified. There was no
verification of the information furnished nor was it said that the plaintiffs
had been approached to ascertain that they indeed knew of the questionable
transactions referred to, as alleged by the auditors’ source of information.
At best therefore, the letter is self serving. Accordingly, the auditors’
letter cannot be said to raise any triable issue.

20\. My comment on the auditors’ letter would equally apply to the first
defendant’s submission that its statement of claim (in its proceedings against
the plaintiffs, the fourth defendant, Muhamed and M Nachiappan) in Suit 1153
raised triable issues. It is trite law that allegations of fraud touching on
letters of credit and knowledge of the bank involved must be clearly
established. The allegation of fraud raised in Suit 1153 not having yet been
determined by a court, _it remained a mere allegation, not an established
fact_(emphasis added). Counsel for the appellant defendants had relied
particularly on para 15 of the statement of claim in Suit 1153 which states:-

> In or about May 1999, in a telephone conversation the 2nd defendant
> [Muhamed] told Mr Venkata Chellam who was to be appointed as a director of
> the plaintiffs that he had extended a personal loan to the 1st defendant
> [fourth defendant here] and the letter of credit transactions were issued to
> procure money from the plaintiffs to pay off the personal loan.

However, the above allegation was specifically denied by Muhamed in para 11 of
the defence he filed to Suit 1153 where he said:-

> Save that there were telephone conversations between the 2nd defendant and V
> Chellam on or about May 1990 as pleaded in paragraph 15, the second
> defendant denied that he had told the said V Chellam that the letters of
> credit transactions were issued to procure money from the Plaintiffs to pay
> off personal loans
>
> .

Far more significant, the fourth defendant had, in his affidavit (filed on 1
October 1999) denied the allegations made in Venkata’s affidavit (filed on 17
September 1999) in the following paragraphs:-

> 7\. ….At the relevant time, I was the person in charge of the company’s [the
> first defendant’s] affairs and _I strenuously deny the allegations made
> therein that the plaintiffs was [sic] involved in a scheme to defraud the
> first defendant_(emphasis added). There is no basis for the said Venkata
> Chellam to make such an allegation especially when he was not involved in
> the first defendant’s affairs at that time.
>
> 9\. In respect of Suit No. 1153/99, I also wish to inform the court that I
> am also one of the defendants therein together with the plaintiffs in this
> Suit. In respect of that Suit, I have instructed my solicitors to file a
> Defence denying the allegations of fraud levelled against the Plaintiffs’
> bank, its officers and myself.

Although the fourth defendant was separately represented in these proceedings,
he nevertheless shared a common liability with the three appellants here as,
he was sued by the plaintiffs as a co-guarantor for the facilities extended to
the first defendant. It was therefore not in his but against his, interests to
say anything in favour of the plaintiffs but he did. Consequently, I gave
considerable weight to the denials in his affidavit. Once I did that, the
allegations of fraud made by Venkata needed to be bolstered by something far
more concrete than mere words, in order to render the allegation a triable
issue; Venkata had nothing to offer in that regard except to reiterate his
allegations and deny the statements made by Srinivasan and or Nachiappan (save
that where it suited his/his parents’ interests to do so, such as the
plaintiffs’ setting off the fixed deposit monies of the fourth defendant, he
agreed with what the plaintiffs did).

21\. I did not share counsel’s view that this suit and Suit 1153 are closely
related albeit they sprang from the same facilities granted by the plaintiffs
to the first defendant. The causes of action in both suits are entirely
different. If the first defendant eventually succeeds in its claim in Suit
1153 against the plaintiffs and the fourth defendant, it would not be
prejudiced by the plaintiffs’ having secured judgements in this suit.

22\. At this juncture, I should add that, contrary to the allegation of
Venkata that the auditors alerted the first defendant to irregularities in the
course of auditing the accounts of the company for 1997, it was the plaintiffs
who had taken up with the first defendant the unsatisfactory state of its
accounts. V Srinivasan had in his affidavit (referred to earlier) deposed that
the plaintiffs had written to the first defendant on 2 November 1997 to state
that the plaintiffs’ internal auditors took a serious view of the accounts of
the company and required a definite improvement before the next review on 31
March 1998. When the plaintiffs received the accounts of the first defendant
for 1997 in September 1998, Srinivasan wrote in early November to the first
defendant for clarification, in particular on the overstatement of stock at
$259,989 when the auditors were only able to verify stock worth $80,000. It is
significant that it was Venkata who replied on the first defendant’s behalf on
6 November 1998 to inform the plaintiffs that ‘ _no actual count was carried
out at year end to verify the exact amount of stocks. Proper stock records
have been implemented since’_. The matter did not rest there as the plaintiffs
wrote for further clarification on the company’s cash flow projections and
this was eventually furnished in December 1998. If indeed there were any
irregularities in the first defendant’s 1997 accounts touching on the letters
of credit transactions ($451,000), the same would or should have been detected
by the auditors and in turn by Venkata by the time he was appointed a director
in mid-1998. The total silence on the part of Venkata and his parents (apart
from the casual verbal inquiry he made to the plaintiffs’ officers on 31 March
1998) until they launched Suit 1153 on 11 August 1999 is a telling reflection
of the merits of their current complaint, especially as Venkata is himself a
practising lawyer.

23\. It is equally significant that the first defendant’s letter to the
plaintiffs dated 9 October 1997 (exhibited in Srinivasan’s affidavit) was
signed by _both_ the third and fourth defendants; that letter inter alia
stated:-

> We are writing to you regarding the current outstanding trust receipts,
> which are over due and for which the company is finding difficulty to meet
> from the existing revenues…..

We have discussed with outside parties to participate in our business but
before doing so they want the following commitment from the Bank.

Since current revenues are inadequate to repaying the loans they want the bank
to

(a) reduce interest rate to prime rate;

…….

(d) overdue TR’s to be rescheduled…..

It therefore does not lie in the mouth of Venkata or his father (the third
defendant) to complain about the overdue trust receipts. By then (according to
Srinivasan), 6 out of the 7 letters of credit complained of by the first
defendant in Suit 1153 had been converted into trust receipts and were already
overdue by between 43 and 70 days. By 31 March 1998, when Venkata came to make
payment of $725,000 to the plaintiffs, all 7 letter of credit had been
converted into trust receipts and all were overdue by between 216 and 243 days
(the first letter of credit was applied for on 24 March 1997 and the last on
25 July 1997).

24\. Venkata had also alleged that the plaintiffs constantly were in breach of
the terms of the letter of offer by exceeding the limit of the OD Trust
Receipt facility which was limited to $600,000. Srinivasan had rebutted this
allegation, pointing out that there was no such facility. What the plaintiffs
offered to the first defendant was a trust receipt facility of $600,000 upon
which the first defendant drew. Each trust receipt was for 120 days and if, as
did happen, the first defendant did not pay within 120 days, the trust receipt
became overdue and attracted interest causing the sum owed on the facility to
exceed $600,000, a fact which Venkata did not seem to appreciate.

25\. Venkata had also raised other allegations including inter alia, that the
plaintiffs had failed to give a breakdown of the facilities and interest
charged which he alleged was ‘exorbitant’. I had no hesitation in dismissing
these allegations as completely baseless, judging from the voluminous
correspondence the plaintiffs exhibited in their affidavits and the fact that
the plaintiffs sent monthly statements of accounts to the first defendant.
Equally, I rejected as far-fetched, the allegation that the plaintiffs had
actively promoted the farm to the second/third defendants as an investment
opportunity. It also defies belief that Venkata, a practising lawyer, would
have remained inactive for 18 months (March 1998 to August 1999) after
discovering that the plaintiffs had connived in or knowingly assisted in, a
fraud committed by the fourth defendant.

26\. The history of the first defendant’s account with the plaintiffs clearly
showed that the account was hardly satisfactory from its inception and it
eventually became a delinquent account. The primary cause was due to the farm
being undercapitalised which situation was not helped by the friction and
acrimony between the Chellam and Jayaram families (each holding 50% equity in
the farm), which, despite Venakta’s denial (in para 7 of his second affidavit
filed on 14 October 1999) I accept did exist, from the chronology of events
recounted in Srinivasan’s affidavit. According to Srinivasan (see his
affidavit filed 18 Ocotber 1999), when the farm was still unprofitable after
the two families took it over, the Chellams blamed the Jayarams. Both families
had acknowledged the need for additional capitalisation to make the farm
viable in their letter to the plaintiffs dated 9 October 1997 (supra).

27\. I note further that after the Jayaram and Chellam families bought over
the farm from the original owners in December 1994, the plaintiffs received a
director’s resolution from the first defendant requiring the accounts with the
plaintiffs to be operated by at least one signatory from each of the two (2)
groups, group A represented the Chellam family and group B the Jayaram family.
That being the case, it would be hard to imagine how the fourth defendant (as
alleged) could have misused the first defendant’s letters of credit facilities
to his own benefit or to the benefit of Muhamed without the knowledge of the
second/third defendants and their son (Venkata).

The plaintiffs’ application

28\. I revert now to the plaintiffs’ application which granting by the Deputy
Registrar formed the basis of the first, second and third defendants’ appeal
in Registrar’s Appeal No. 440 of 1999. The plaintiffs had applied to strike
out the following paragraph in Venkata’s reply affidavit filed on 14 October
1999 (in answer to Srinivasan’s affidavit set out in para 17(c) above):-

> 6\. Although the Plaintiffs are allegedly a full licensed bank and fully
> guaranteed by the Government of India, their officers have been embroiled in
> schemes concerning sums much larger than the amounts at hand. In particular,
> the Plaintiffs were recently the subject of the biggest scandal in Indian
> Banking history whereby they reportedly lost S$534m for the 1995-1996 fiscal
> year and wiped out their entire capital base. The Plaintiffs’ losses
> compelled the Indian government to intervene and re-capitalise the
> Plaintiffs and criminal investigations are currently pending against a
> number of the officers heading the plaintiffs at the material time.
> Incidentally, (a) the Plaintiffs’ Meyappan Nachiappan was involved in a
> claim brought by the Plaintiffs regarding losses suffered as a result of the
> scandal in Suit No. 2355 of 1996 and (b) N Sundaresan the Plaintiffs’ deputy
> general manager during the material time was named in the First
> Investigation Report filed in respect of the scandal.

In my view, the Deputy Registrar quite rightly struck out para 6. In his
affidavit (filed on 18 October 1999) Srinivasan had deposed that the offending
para 6 was totally irrelevant and, was an overt attempt to prejudice the Court
and scandalise the action to suit the needs of the first defendant and the
Chellams. Srinivasan was also not aware of any First Investigation Report
naming Mr N Sundaresan.

29\. I fully agreed with Srinivasan’s comment. Even if Venkata’s
(unsubstantiated) allegation in para 6 is true, it has no relevance to the
plaintiffs’ claim herein; his sole motive was to unfairly tarnish the
reputation of the plaintiffs in the eyes of the law.

_

The conclusion

_

30\. The onus was on the first defendant to show there were triable issues or,
that there ought for some other reason for the plaintiffs’ claim to proceed to
trial (O 14 r 3(1) of Rules of Court). As the first defendant had not raised
any reasonable doubts on the plaintiffs’ claim and, Venkata’s affidavits had
not satisfied me that the first defendant had a fair and reasonable
probability of showing a real or bona fide defence, I saw no reason to disturb
the order made by the court below.

31\. As for the second and third defendants, they had a higher burden to
discharge than that for an O 14 application. In this regard I refer to the
Court of Appeal decision in _Abdul Gaffer v Chua Kwang Yong_[1995] 1 SLR 484
cited by counsel for the plaintiffs. In order for the court to exercise its
discretion to set aside a judgement in default, the two (2) defendants had to
show that they had a defence with a real prospect of success which carried
some degree of conviction, not merely an arguable defence, this the second and
third defendants failed to do. Accordingly, I also dismissed their appeals.
