Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff here had sought leave in 2000 by Originating Summons No 96 of
2000 for a judicial review of her termination as a legal officer. The Court of
Appeal ruled (in Civil Appeal No 69 of 2000) that she was not entitled to make
a claim for administrative law remedies because she was not a public servant.
She was at the material time on probation and “was not a confirmed civil
servant”. She then brought a civil action in this suit (referred to in
subsequent proceedings as “the employment action”) claiming that her
termination was unconstitutional. There was another action in Originating
Summons (Bankruptcy) No 38 of 2005 in which this plaintiff applied to stay
bankruptcy proceedings commenced against her by the defendant. Her action in
Suit No 995 of 2004 was finally disposed of in Civil Appeal No 87 of 2005
ending with the judgment of the Court of Appeal in _Lai Swee Lin Linda v
Attorney General_ , reported in [2006] 2 SLR(R) 565.

2 The plaintiff now applies under the summons in this suit (Suit No 995 of
2004) for an order that the Court of Appeal “reopen[s] and rehear[s] its
earlier decisions” in Civil Appeal No 69 of 2000 and Civil Appeal No 87 of
2005, as well as the first instance decision of the trial judge in this suit.
The plaintiff submitted that this application was based on the Court of
Appeal’s decision in _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee
Tat Development Pte Ltd_ [2010] SGCA 39 (“ _Lee Tat_ ”) and ss 29A(4), 37 of
the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), as well as O 92 r
4 and O 57 r 13 of the Rules of Court.

3 The factual basis for all the proceedings concerning the plaintiff stems
from the termination of her employment in December 1998. Although the
plaintiff claimed that she was denied “a full, fair and impartial hearing” in
Civil Appeal No 69 of 2000, the merits of her case were eventually heard by
Lai J in 2010 in this very action (Suit No 995 of 2004). The trial judge
considered her claim and the reasons for her dismissal from the Land Office
division of the Ministry of Law. The plaintiff’s action in this suit was
dismissed and she appealed to the Court of Appeal. This was heard (in Civil
Appeal No 87 of 2005) and her appeal was dismissed on 7 December 2005.

4 Before me, the plaintiff claims that Lai J’s decision was tainted by bias.
She claimed that the decision should be “re-opened” because it was not heard
on the merits. She also claimed that the decisions in the Bankruptcy
proceedings as well as Civil Appeal No 87 of 2005 proceedings should be “re-
opened”, but no grounds or basis were given by her as to why these matters
should be re-heard. Citing the _Lee Tat_ case on the power of the Court of
Appeal to re-hear a case is neither a sufficient nor adequate basis to have a
concluded case “re-opened”.

5 Technically, Suit No 995 of 2004 is spent once the final decision has been
pronounced – as it has in this case. The correct procedure would have been to
commence a fresh originating action to set aside the last judgment or for
leave to appeal out of time, whichever is applicable. In any event, nothing
raised by the plaintiff before me is new. All her complaints related to her
inability to have a fair and open hearing as to whether her contract of
employment had been lawfully terminated. This central issue was raised, heard
and dismissed at many levels from the many directions the plaintiff had taken
in order to advance her cause.

6 I am not in a position here to judge if all or any of the previous judgments
were wrong. This is not an appellate court. The only issue before me was to
consider if there is any basis to hold that the plaintiff had not been given a
fair hearing in Civil Appeal No 87 of 2005. The Court of Appeal in that case
was not only the last court to have heard her case, it was also the final
court of appeal which determined the findings of the court below in respect of
that all-important question in the plaintiff’s life since December 1998. The
record shows that the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 87 of 2005 was seized
of all the matters regarding that issue and had rendered its decision. Lai J’s
judgment which the plaintiff now complains of had also been dealt with. There
is no evidence before me to indicate that either Lai J’s court or the Court of
Appeal was biased, unfair, or that the plaintiff was not given a full hearing.
In the circumstances, this summons must be dismissed. I will hear the question
of costs at a later date.
