**Judgment** __

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

By this originating motion, Mr Jules Sher QC ("Mr Sher") sought ad hoc
admission under s 21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) ("the Act") as an
advocate and solicitor of this court to appear on behalf of Singapore
Telecommunications Limited ("SingTel"), the defendant in Suit No. 934 of
2001/Y ("the suit") until its final disposal. In the suit, the plaintiff was
claiming in restitution the sum of $388 million from SingTel on the ground
that in making that payment to SingTel as part of the compensation it had made
a mistake of law. Counsel for the plaintiff in the suit did not object to the
application. The representative of the Attorney-General left the matter to the
court. Counsel for the Law Society of Singapore, however, opposed the
application. Initially, I was reluctant to order the ad hoc admission and I
pressed Mr Shanmugam SC on the matter, commenting that he was working very
hard out of a very interesting brief. In the end I was persuaded that the
three-fold test laid down in Singapore by a long line of case-law was
fulfilled. Bearing in mind the principles governing the exercise of my
discretion as laid down by s 21(1) of the Act and case-law, I allowed the
application. I now set out the background and the circumstances under which
the facts were applied in accordance with the principles governing the
admissions of QCs.

**

Section 21 of the Legal Profession Act

**

2 Section 21 of the Act states as follows:

"(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may, for
the purposes of any one case where the court is satisfied that it is of
sufficient difficulty and complexity and having regard to the circumstances of
the case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who -

> (a) holds Her Majesty’s Patent as Queen’s Counsel
>
> (b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has come or
> intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the case; and
>
> (c) has special qualification or experience for the purpose of the case."

3 Mr Sher obtained the degree of Bachelor of Commerce followed by an LL.B at
the University of Witwaterstrand, Johannesburg in 1964. He was awarded the
degree Cum Laude and was awarded the Society of Advocates’ prize for the best
law student over the three years of the LL.B course. He was called to the Bar
in South Africa. He took the post-graduate Bachelor of Civil Law at Oxford
University, New College, in 1967 and was called to the Bar of England and
Wales in 1968 by the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. He has practiced
at the Bar of England and Wales since then. In 1981 he was appointed one of
Her Majesty’s Counsel. He is a member of the Chancery Bar Association and the
Commercial Bar Association. In 1987 he was appointed a Recorder and a Deputy
High Court Judge in the Chancery Division in 1989 and more recently in the
Queen’s Bench Division, Commercial Court.

4 Mr Sher has appeared as counsel in several cases in Singapore. At the time
of his application he was instructed in a very large scale litigation in the
Cayman Islands and in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom
he has appeared regularly in the High Court, the Court of Appeal, the Privy
Council and the House of Lords, both as junior and in silk. He appeared in
_William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire County Council_ in the Court of Appeal
[1994] 1 WLR 1016 which was a case involving mistake in the realm of contract
and of relevance at the trial of the suit. He also appeared in _South Tyneside
Metropolitan Borough Council v Svenska International plc_ [1995] 1 All ER 545
which involved the law of contract and restitution and the defence of change
of position, and which would also be relevant to the issues in the suit.

5 In the light of the very impressive credentials of Mr Sher, it was obvious
that the requirements of special qualifications and experience under s 21(1)
of the Act were not in issue before me.

6 For more than 10 years our courts have been dilating on s 21(1) of the Act.
It was noted that the section was aimed at specifying some guidelines in the
ad hoc admission of Queen’s Counsel. The objective was to help develop a
strong core of good advocates at the local Bar, but it was also recognized
that in the appropriate cases litigants would be allowed to avail themselves
of the services of QCs. The guidelines were most usefully set out by Yong Pung
How CJ in _Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC_ _(No 2)_ [1998] 1 SLR 440 [para 11]:

> At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in which he
> seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient difficulty
> and complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queen’s Counsel.
> Such difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee of admission, for
> the decision to admit is still a matter of the court’s discretion. At the
> second stage, therefore, the applicant must persuade the court that the
> circumstances of the particular case warrant the court exercising its
> discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he has to satisfy the court
> of his suitability for admission.

7 _In Re Flint Charles John Raffles QC_ [2001] 2 SLR 276 I had occasion to
consider the import of s21(1) of the Act. Mr Flint applied for ad hoc
admission to appear for a Malaysian company to recover substantial damages of
about US$75 million against each of the then 30 defendants for, inter alia,
conspiracy to defraud, equitable compensation and/or damages for breaches of
contract of employment, fiduciary duties or inducement of breaches of contract
and for dishonest assistance or as recipients of trust moneys. Local counsel
in that case had played prominent roles in the pre-trial preparation of the
case and had convincingly demonstrated before me in many interlocutory matters
that he would ably assist the plaintiffs and the court. Much of the crucial
leg-work had been done and such trial advocacy as would be required was well
within the abilities of local counsel. I formed the view that the opportunity
must be offered to the local Bar to take up the challenge and appear at the
trial and conduct it. The nurturing of the local Bar was endorsed by Yong Pung
How CJ in _Re Howe Russell Thomas QC_ [2001] 3 SLR 575 para 7. Yong CJ in that
case stated clearly that that application "did not pass the first stage of the
test" which he laid down in _Re Caplan Michael QC_.

8 In the light of the pronouncements of our courts I went on to analyse the
nature of the suit to consider if it merited the ad hoc admission of a Queen’s
Counsel.

**

The Facts

**

9 The plaintiff ("IDA") in the suit is a body corporate established pursuant
to the Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore Act (Cap 137A).
Its predecessor in title and power was the Telecommunications Authority of
Singapore ("TAS"), which was established under the Telecommunications
Authority of Singapore Act (Cap 323) ("the TAS Act"), and which had made the
payment in question. SingTel is a public company incorporated in Singapore and
is engaged in, among other things, the business of providing telecommunication
services in Singapore.

10 On 1 April 1992 TAS granted SingTel a licence under the TAS Act to provide
telecommunication services to Singapore until 2017 with monopoly rights for
the provision of basis telecommunication services until 2007. In October 1993
SingTel’s licence was amended to provide that TAS would have the right to
licence additional operators to provide basic telecommunication services from
1 April 2002 "provided those services were ancillary and incidental to the
principal services" provided by those operators ("the 1993 amendment").

11 By a letter to SingTel dated 11 May 1996, TAS gave notice pursuant to s 28
of the TAS Act of its intention to modify a condition of SingTel’s licence.
TAS stated that the compensation payable for any damage caused by this
modification was assessed by TAS to be $1.5 billion and that SingTel was given
28 days from the date of service of that letter to make representations to the
proposed modification.

12 SingTel replied and stated that they confirmed their acceptance of the
proposed modification referred to in TAS’s letter and the compensation of $1.5
billion for the damage to SingTel, being SingTel’s "loss of profits in each of
the years from 2000 to 2007, caused by the proposed modification." The quoted
words reflected, evidently, a desire to spread the losses over those years and
reduced the quantum of income tax, if any.

13 On receipt of the letter, TAS by its Director-General called SingTel’s
officers and said that TAS was not agreeable to the form in which the letter
was couched and requested that the words "in each of the years from 2000 to
2007" be deleted. SingTel agreed to the deletion. On the same day, TAS wrote
to SingTel as follows:

> > " We refer to the letter …dated 30 May 1996 and Singapore Telecom’s
> decision to delete the words _‘in each of the years from 2000 to 2007,_ ’
> from paragraph 2 thereof.
>>

>> 2 We note Singapore Telecom’s acceptance of the proposed modification in
our letter of 11 May 1996 and acceptance of the compensation amount of $1.5
billion for damage caused by the modification.

>>

>> 3 This amount will be full and final payment."

14 On or about 31 March 1997 TAS paid the compensation sum of $1.5 billion to
SingTel.

15 On 4 October 2000, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore informed IDA
and SingTel that no tax would be payable on the compensation amount received
by SingTel.

16 By a letter dated 14 March 2001 IDA as the successor in title requested
SingTel to repay the amount allegedly overpaid by TAS of $388 million. SingTel
rejected the claim and refused to pay the same. IDA commenced the suit in July
2001. The pleadings were exhibited in the proceedings before me. The following
issues arose from the pleadings and they were summarised as follows:

> > "a. Did TAS make a mistake of including in the compensation sum of
> S$1,500,000,000.00 a tax provision of S$388,000,000 or did TAS assume the
> risk that tax may not be payable.

> > b. Did the Defendants likewise make the same mistake or did they assume
> the risk that tax would be payable and if so at what rate and in over what
> timescale.

> > c. What was the state of the law as at the time the compensation sum was
> proposed with regards to the taxability of the compensation sum.

> > d. If TAS did make a mistake, was it a mistake of fact or law, or mixed
> fact and law.
>

>> e. If it was a mistake of law (whether wholly or in part), does that
entitle the Plaintiffs to seek restitution of the S$388,000,000, i.e. is
restitution for mistake of law a valid cause of action in Singapore. TAS
followed the statutory procedure laid down in section 28 of the TAS Act in
sending its letter of 11 May 1996 which embodied the statutory notice referred
to in sub-section (2) of that section. That notice stated the proposed
modifications to the Defendants’ licence and that the compensation payable
would be S$1,500,000,000.00 to be paid on 31 March 1997. The Defendants had 28
days to object. Had they objected and had TAS either not changed its mind or
amended the proposed modifications or compensation, the Defendants would have
had 14 days to appeal to the Minister. As the Defendants did not object, TAS
became statutorily obliged to carry out the modifications and statutorily
obliged on 31 March 1997 to pay the Defendants the sum of S$1,500,000,000.00
being the sum specified in the statutory notice emobided in the letter of 11
May 1996. In the circumstances, even assuming there was a mistake in the
original calculation of the S$1,500,000,000.00 inserted in the letter of 11
May 1996, the issue is whether TAS were statutorily obliged to pay that sum on
the 31st March 1997.

> > f. In the events that happened, as pleaded by the Defendants, was TAS
> contractually obliged to pay the Defendants S$1,500,000,000.00 on 31 March
> 1997, on the basis that that sum would be a full and final settlement of the
> claim for compensation so that neither the Defendants nor TAS would be able
> to reopen the sum whether or not any one or more of the many assumptions of
> present and future fact and law that lay behind the determination of the
> compensation turned out to be erroneous.

> > g. If so, is a valid compromise a defence to a claim for restitution for
> mistake of law, such that the Plaintiffs cannot claim repayment of the
> compensation or any part thereof without obtaining from the Court rescission
> of the contract embodying the compromise. If so, can the contract in
> pursuance of which compensation was paid, be rescinded by the court.

> > h. On the basis of the facts as pleaded by the Defendants, in particular,
> that the Defendants reasonably proceeded on the basis that the offer of
> S$1,500,000,000.00 by TAS would on acceptance result in a full and final
> settlement of the Defendants’ entitlement to compensation arising from the
> modification of their licence, and accordingly refrained from making
> representations with regard to TAS’s letter of 11 May 1996 within the
> statutory 28 day period, are the Plaintiffs estopped from claiming
> restitution of the S$388,000,000.00.
>

>> i. On the basis of the facts as pleaded by the Defendants, in particular,
that following payment of the compensation on 31 March 1997, the Defendants
declared on 9 July 1999 a special interim dividend of 12 cents per share for
the financial year 1999/2000 (the nett dividend payout of which was in the sum
of S$1,374,040,751.02) is the defence of change of position available to the
Defendants."

17 These issues would span the law of restitution and contract and they raised
important, difficult and complex questions, amongst others, as to what would
be the operative mistakes of law which would kick in the restitutionary
reliefs and the defences available in the light of this newly recognized cause
of action in the laws of Singapore. Several questions would arise for the
first time, which would require treatment by our courts.

18 Counsel for the Law Society of Singapore submitted that the High Court had
recently ruled that unjust enrichment under a payment made under a mistake of
law was reversible: see _Management Corporation Strata Title No 473 v De Beers
Jewellery Pte Ltd_[2001] 4 SLR 90. He expressed the view that Mr Shanmugam SC
could with equal facility appear for SingTel and would appear on its behalf
and pursue with equal vigour the rights of SingTel as any QC would.

19 In response, Mr Shanmugam SC observed that the law bearing on a
restitutionary claim based on mistake of law and the defences was obviously
evolving. Many of the issues on what would amount to an operative mistake of
law and the defences would be new and had not been dealt with in any
jurisdiction in the world. The new cause of action would require delineation
and further amplification. Equally, the defences available to meet this
restitutionary claim, as foreshadowed by the issues outlined, would require
careful consideration and exposition. Elucidation and arguments by a Queen’s
Counsel well versed in this new branch of the law would be most desirable.
That would be of great assistance to our courts. Secondly, he pointed out that
the Government of Singapore was a substantial shareholder of SingTel. SingTel
was concerned to ensure that the international investing community, its
shareholders, amongst whom were fund-managers, must be demonstrably satisfied
that the prosecution of its defence was being pursued with vigour and
determination.

20 Having considered the matter carefully, I formed the view that SingTel’s
concern was understandable. Like it or not, we had to address the perceptions
(whether well-founded or not) of the international and local market place.
Whilst it was true that local counsel could appear for SingTel adequately,
that was one relevant factor to be considered in the entire balancing
exercise. I was also very mindful of the seminal issues which would probably
arise in this relatively new and evolving areas of the law of restitution
which I had personally followed with great interest over the last decade
generally and particularly since the decision handed down by the House of
Lords in _Kleinwort Benson v Lincoln City Council_[1998] 4 All ER 513, [1999]
2 AC 349. In my view, the three-fold test referred to earlier was fulfilled
and in the exercise of my discretion I allowed the application.
