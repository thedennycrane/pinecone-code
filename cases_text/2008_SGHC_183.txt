Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff sued the defendant for the return of $2,000,000 paid under a
contract entitled “Sale and Purchase Agreement” (“the agreement”) dated 18
November 2002. Under that agreement the plaintiff agreed to purchase what was
described in the contract as “the Electronic Recycling and Precious Metals
Recovery and Refinery facilities”(“the facilities”). The facilities were set
out in Schedule 1 in the agreement and comprised, among other things, an
incinerator. The total purchase price was stated to be $20,000,000 but with
the qualification that the prices of the individual items were “budgetary and
firm equipment prices will be submitted upon final confirmation of design and
specification by [the plaintiff]. The parties had contracted to the terms of
payment with a payment schedule that was set out in cl 3 of the agreement.
That clause is vital and it provided as follows:

3\. Payment Terms and Payment Schedule  
---  
By telegraphic remittance directly to [the defendant]:  
Upon acceptance of this proposal |  10% of the total contract sum  
Upon delivery of machinery |  30% of the respective contract sum  
Upon completion of installation |  30% of the respective contract sum  
Upon commissioning |  20% of the respective contract sum  
Upon completion of warranty period |  10% of the total contract sum  
  
The $2,000,000 claimed by the plaintiff in this action was the 10% payment
referred to above. It was not disputed that the rest of the contract was not
fulfilled by either side although the defendant’s case was that substantial
work had been done in respect of the machinery that was part of the subject
facilities.

2 The plaintiff claimed that it was entitled to a refund of the $2,000,000
because that sum was paid as a deposit which must be returned if the defendant
was in breach. Secondly, Mr Sadique, counsel for the plaintiff also submitted
that not having done anything after signing the agreement and taking the
plaintiff’s money, the contracted must be deemed frustrated. Counsel
emphasized that it was no defence to say that there was partial work if the
agreement was the delivery of a thing. The consideration being to deliver, the
failure to deliver was a total failure of consideration.

3 Mr Thio, counsel for the defendant submitted that the agreement was not a
sale and purchase of a single article. He submitted that it was an agreement
covering a massive complex of buildings and equipment for recycling waste
products. He emphasized that the agreement provided that the facilities were
“for use only at the designated site at No. 1, TTC 32, Taman Technology Cheng,
75250, Melaka, Malaysia”. The defendant had been working with professional
consultants appointed by the plaintiff as well as the state of Malacca’s
Department of Environment. The latter eventually notified the defendant that
the incinerator was not acceptable because of complaints by the public, and it
had to be replaced by a hammer mill instead. Mr Thio submitted that the
defendant had produced sufficient evidence to show that it had paid a
subcontractor $1,655,000 to work on the facilities. The plaintiff disputed
this and put the defendant to proof. The matter would have been put beyond
doubt had EPS testified, but the defendant was not obliged to prove all
available evidence. It had produced internal accounting records that were not
contradicted or shown to be unreliable, and much of the work done by the
subcontractor had been admitted by the plaintiff in any event. I am of the
view that work had proceeded as the defendant claimed.

4 The issues before me were straightforward. As regards the plaintiff’s first
ground, namely, whether the $2,000,000 was paid only as a deposit, I am of the
view that the contract clause was unequivocal in its description. There was no
mention of the word “deposit”. The payment terms show the payment as a staged
payment. $2,000,000 was required to be paid when the contract was signed. That
was done. That left the plaintiff with only the claim based on a total failure
of consideration. Although the agreement was named a “sale and purchase”
agreement, it was apparent from the agreement that it included production,
building, installation, and many ancillary services such as negotiating with
the state authorities for the requisite licenses. In such a case, it would not
be reasonable to hold that the purchaser was entitled to a refund of monies
paid if the milestones in the staged payment had accrued. In such contracts,
the parties would have anticipated various work to be done or consideration
given before setting a milestone for payment. The first stage would usually,
as in this case, have involved preparatory work and the staged payments were
meant to have all that taken into account. It would be the parties’ agreement
with each other that when each stage is reached, payment will be made as
scheduled. If the plaintiff had suffered damage or loss, it must prove its
entitlement to a remedy in law on grounds (if there were any) other than a
“total failure of consideration”.

5 Mr Sadique further submitted that the work claimed by the defendant was in
fact work done in connection with the “Malacca Project” which was separate and
distinct from the agreement. The defendant does not deny that the agreement
was a separate agreement from the primary project known as the “Malacca
Project”. However, the agreement was a separate agreement from the agreement
governing the main project. The parties referred to that as the “Overarching
Agreement”. The agreement and Overarching Agreement appear to me to be
connected, but the defendant’s case and the evidence indicated that work under
the agreement was distinct and pursuant only to the agreement even though it
would benefit and contribute to the eventual completion of the Malacca
Project. The plaintiff failed to persuade me otherwise.

6 I am of the view that there was no total failure of consideration in this
case. That being the case, the plaintiff had exhausted its grounds of claim as
pleaded and the action is therefore dismissed with costs.
