**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

1\. The parties were married in July 1980 and have two children, a son Mark
born in 1981 and a daughter Nicole born in 1984. The marriage broke down in
1992 and the husband left the matrimonial home at Block 48 Henley Court,
#06-04, Astrid Meadows, Coronation Road West (the "Astrid Meadows property").
The wife petitioned for a divorce in March 1994 and was granted a _decree
nisi_ in June 1997.

2\. The parties were unable to agree on the ancilliary matters. They were
heard by a district judge who made the following orders on 7 May 1999 –

> a) 45% of value of Astrid Meadows (45% of $4,380,000 = $1,971,000) (round up
> - $2 million).
>

>> If sale, Respondent to make his own refunds to CPF, to pay outstanding
mortgage fees and expenses relating to sale.

>
> b) Other assets
>

>> 25% of $1,807,113 = $451,778.25 (round up - $500,000).

>
> c) Lump sum maintenance to Petitioner -$960,000
>

>> > > > > Total - $3,442,111 ($3,460,000)

>
> d) Maintenance for Nicole - $3000 per month with effect from 15 May 1999.
>
> e) Costs to Petitioner fixed at $12,000.

3\. Both parties appealed against the orders. The husband sought to have the
maintenance for the wife reduced to $480,000 calculated at $4,000 a month for
10 years, to reduce her share of the matrimonial assets (other than the Astrid
Meadows property) to 25% of the net value rather than the gross value and
against the order for costs. In her appeal the wife wanted to have the orders
on the division of the matrimonial assets varied, and to have the costs taxed.

4\. After hearing counsel, I ordered that

5\. The husband was unhappy with the result and appealed against the orders in
italics. I shall explain those of my orders which are under appeal.

__

Order 1 - The Astrid Meadows property

6\. My order was an affirmation of the district judge’s order. The effect of
the order was that the wife was to receive $2 million as her share in this
property. I changed the wording to reflect its effect more succinctly.

7\. As the district judge did not specify the time for payment of this amount,
I ordered that it be paid in three months, lest it be argued that the order
was effective and enforceable from the day it was made. The three month period
was set to enable the husband to sell the property or to raise the $2 million
by other means.

8\. The husband had not appealed against the district judge’s order, and
appeared to have accepted that he has to pay the wife the $2 million as her
share in the property. His counsel in their written submissions confirmed

> It was also ordered by the Learned District Judge on 7 May 1999 that the
> Petitioner be entitled to 45% of the matrimonial home at Astrid Meadows,
> which share shall be ascribed the rounded-off value of $2 million, the said
> $2 million to be paid by the Respondent to the Petitioner forthwith, either
> from the net proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home or otherwise. _The
> Respondent has not appealed against this order_ …
>
> (Emphasis added)

__

Order 2 – The other matrimonial assets

9\. Both parties have identified the matrimonial assets available which they
considered were subject to division. The wife’s list was "Annex A" to the
Petitioner’s Skeletal Submissions filed on 16 March 1999, and the husband’s
list was exhibit "R4".

10\. The district judge proceeded on the assumption that both parties were
comfortable with the wife’s list. This was not borne out by the notes of
evidence which showed counsel for the husband to have said "Annex A. It’s a
fair list of assets in the neutral sense. I will submit which should not be
matrimonial assets."

11\. The district judge added up the values of the assets in Annex A (except
an inheritance from the husband’s grandfather’s estate) and arrived at the
figure of $12,559,320.00. He then deducted from that the market value of the
Astrid Meadows property, shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd ("LKTH") and Lee
Kim Tah Pte Investments ("LKTI"), and the husband’s liabilities, and arrived
at the figure of $1,807,113, which he took to be the value of the other
matrimonial assets.

12\. There were difficulties with his approach, _inter alia_ -

> (i) The husband had not accepted the wife’s list.
>
> (ii) In that list the recorded values of the Astrid Meadows property and the
> Sydney property were their open market values without deducting the
> outstanding loans secured on these properties. These loans must be deducted
> from the market values. The value of an asset for the purpose of division is
> the value available for division. It is inappropriate to use market value
> (or gross value as the district judge put it) when loans are secured on the
> properties because only the balance remaining after discharging the loans is
> available for division.
>
> (iii) The district judge mistook the numbers of LKTH and LKTI shares for
> their values.
>
> (iv) The district judge erred in deducting the husband’s liabilities from
> the value of matrimonial assets. His liabilities could be taken into
> consideration if they come under section 112 (2)(b) of the Women’s Charter
> in apportioning the matrimonial assets, but they should not be taken out
> from the value of the matrimonial assets unless the liabilities are secured
> by the assets.

13\. I employed a different approach to identify the matrimonial assets. I
used the wife’s list as a starting point and determined which asset should be
taken into account, and how their values should be determined.

__

The Sydney property

14\. The two loans were taken by the husband to purchase the property. The
loans taken in 1994 and 1995 were documented. I ordered that the outstanding
loans and annual interest be deducted from the market value of the property in
determining its value for the purpose of division.

_

The LKTH and LKTI shares

_

15\. The husband explained how he came to own these shares. Before his
marriage he received shares in three companies, namely Lee Realty Pte Ltd, Lee
Development Pte Ltd and Lee Kim Tah Pte Ltd as gifts from members of his
family.

16\. In 1982 the three companies were part of an amalgamation exercise to
consolidate the companies into a holding company, LKTH. He deposed that "I was
offered the shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd and Lee Kim Tah Investments Pte
Ltd in consideration of the shares which I held earlier." He was married by
this time.

17\. The husband argued that the LKTH and LKTI shares are not matrimonial
assets under s 112(10), but I disagreed with him. The gift shares in the
original companies were no longer in existence at the time of division. He had
accepted the offer to exchange them for new shares. The new shares did not
come from the donors and were not gifts received in the course of
amalgamation.

__

The SingTel shares

18\. The husband did not dispute that he held 720 SingTel (A) shares and 600
SingTel (B) shares. He wanted to exclude them from division because "… these
shares were not acquisitions and the Petitioner herself has the same number of
shares."

19\. He did not explain how he came by those shares, and cannot expect anyone
to act on his bare assertion. The fact that the wife also held SingTel shares
does not mean that his shares are not matrimonial assets. It may mean that her
SingTel shares should also be considered for division, but that is another
matter, and that is not a matter under appeal before me.

__

The Singapore Island Country Club ("SICC") and American Club memberships

20\. The husband claimed that they were given to him by his father. In respect
of the SICC membership, it was submitted that

> This was a gift from the Respondent’s parents. When the membership was made
> transferable, in January 1992, the Respondent made an upfront payment of
> $14,000.00 and paid the balance in instalments of $500.00 monthly from 1st
> July 1992 to 1st June 1998.

21\. The husband did not get his father to confirm the gifts, or obtain
confirmation from the clubs as he did in respect of the gift of a British Club
membership. I found that he had not proved them to my satisfaction. Even if
there was a gift of the SICC membership, it was a gift of a non-transferrable
membership with no realisable value. The present membership is a transferable
membership. Assuming that it originated from a gift, it is no longer that
membership after it was converted at a cost of $50,000.

__

The bank accounts

22\. Three accounts are in the husband’s sole name. One account with OCBC is
held with his father and another with POSB is held with his mother.

23\. The husband’s submissions dealt with these accounts in two sentences -
"There is no available cash for division. The Petitioner has more cash than
the Respondent." I cannot understand that. The accounts are in credit. Whether
or not the wife has more cash has no bearing on the issue. Her cash holdings
may be subject to division, but that is not a matter before me on the appeal.

24\. He also claimed that he was holding the account with his mother as her
trustee. This was a bare assertion with no documentary evidence, no
explanation to the purpose and terms of the trust, and no affidavit by the
mother to confirm her beneficial interest.

25\. In the circumstances, I ruled that the sums in the three accounts in the
husband’s name and half the funds in each of the accounts he held with his
parents are matrimonial assets.

__

The CPF funds

26\. The husband’s position before the district judge was that the wife should
not be entitled to more than 20% of his CPF funds. In his appeal from the
district judge’s decision, the husband accepted the 25% apportionment but
contended that it should be computed on the net value. I have dealt with this
net/gross issue in paragraph 12(ii).

__

Valuation of the assets

27\. I ordered that the values of the matrimonial assets on which there was no
agreed values to be assessed by the Registrar. I also ordered that the values
be taken as at 7 May 1999 – the day when the district judge ordered the
division. With regard to the shares in two Malaysian counters United Engineers
and Faber Merlin which cannot be transacted currently, I ordered that their
values be set at the time they can be disposed of.

__

The maintenance for the wife

28\. The district judge had ordered that she is to receive a lump sum of
$960,000 computed at $8000 per month for 10 years. Both parties agreed that
there should be a lump-sum amount pegged at 10 years. The wife had asked it to
be computed on $14,000 per month, and the husband offered $4000.

29\. In coming to his figure of $8000 the district judge took into account the
fact that it was common ground between the parties that the wife had enjoyed a
very high standard of living and a good quality of life during the marriage.

30\. Prior to the hearing before him, the parties had an arrangement whereby
the husband paid to the wife $5000 for the maintenance of her and the
daughter. He also paid $3000 per month for the rental of the house the wife
and daughter were staying in, and $3090 towards the payment of the wife’s car.
This arrangement is a reflection of the parties’ expectations and abilities
with regard to maintenance. The award based on $8000 a month is reasonable.

__

Maintenance for the daughter

31\. There was no appeal against this order in the husband’s notice of appeal.
Nevertheless his counsel submitted on it before me.

32\. Since it was brought up, I will comment on it, although I do not regard
it as a matter under appeal.

33\. In fixing the maintenance at $3000, the district judge found that to be
adequate maintenance. He was not obliged to set out the components to that
figure, and he did not. His finding that the wife and the family had enjoyed a
very good quality of life must have contributed to his decision, and he must
have considered the wife’s break-down of the $3400 that she claimed as well as
the husband’s basis for offering $2000.

34\. On the available material, I would not say that the district judge’s
award of $3000 was wrong. I may have come to a lower figure if the matter came
before me at the first instance, but the difference would not merit disturbing
the order even if there was an appeal.

__

The costs below

35\. The district judge awarded costs to the wife for the hearing of the
ancillary matters fixed at $12,000. No costs were awarded on the petition,
which was grounded on separation and was not contested There can be two bases
for the husband’s objection to the order – on principle and on quantum.

36\. His complaint is that costs should not be ordered because the divorce
proceeded on a no-fault basis, citing in support _Shi Fang v Koh Pee
Huat_[1996] 2 SLR 221 where the Court of Appeal said at pp 237-8

> The wife obtained a decree nisi on the ground that the marriage had
> irretrievably broken down owing to desertion on the part of the husband.
> Implicit in the grant of such decree to the wife was the finding of fault on
> the part of the husband as a cause for the divorce. In granting the decree
> nisi the court ordered, inter alia, that costs be adjourned for further
> hearing. We can find no reason why the wife should not be allowed the full
> costs of the hearing of the petition. As the hearing of the ancillary
> matters was a continuation or part of the hearing of the divorce petition,
> the wife should be entitled to the costs of such hearing also. The wife was
> awarded $240,000 as a lump sum maintenance and $10,000 as her share of the
> matrimonial assets. We cannot see any reason for depriving the wife of her
> costs of the hearing of the ancillaries. In our judgment, she should be
> entitled to full costs of the hearing of the petition and the ancillaries
> below, and we so order.

37\. This is not really relevant or helpful to the husband’s cause. The Court
held that the petitioner was entitled to the costs of the divorce hearing and
the hearing of the ancillary matters in a fault-based divorce. I do not read
that to imply that where a divorce proceeded on fault-free basis, costs should
not be awarded for the ancillary matters.

38\. In the usual case where marriage is dissolved on a fault-free ground no
costs are awarded. This is especially so when the petition is not contested.
If it is contested, costs may be awarded if the respondent acts unreasonably,
e.g. by unreasonably disputing the separation or the breakdown of the
marriage.

39\. However it does not follow that costs would not be awarded in ancillary
applications in fault-free uncontested proceedings in all cases. It really
depends on the conduct of the parties. If one party’s unreasonable conduct led
to a long hearing of ancillary matters, there is no reason why that party
could not be ordered to pay costs. In _Grenfell v Grenfell_ [1978] 1 All ER
560 Ormrod LJ said at 568

> (I)f the court dissolves a marriage on the ground of five years’ separation,
> it should not, in the ordinary way, grant costs to either side, the object
> being to prevent parties insisting on the court conducting an enquiry as to
> why they have been living apart for five years; in other words, having a
> contested suit simply for the purpose of deciding who should pay the costs.
>
> So far as ancillary relief is concerned, it seems to me that _the costs in
> any proceedings for ancillary relief must depend on the way in which those
> proceedings are conducted on both sides_ , and the judge must exercise his
> discretion in the ordinary way, bearing in mind perhaps that it is a five
> year separation case, but certainly not regarding himself as bound to make
> no order as to costs because the ground for decree was a five year
> separation. The matter must be dealt with, it seems to me, in a reasonable
> way in the light of the facts of any particular case.
>
> (Emphasis added)

40\. In a hearing on ancillary matters, it is for the judge hearing them to
decide whether costs should be awarded. The Court of Appeal ruled in _Tham
Khai Meng v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette_[1997] 2 SLR 27 at p 47 that

> (T)he hearing of the ancillaries is part of or a continuation of the hearing
> of the petition. It therefore follows that where a party, whether petitioner
> or respondent, is awarded costs at the hearing of the petition, the same
> order as to costs should follow at the hearing of the ancillaries, _unless
> the party to whom the costs were awarded at the hearing of the petition has
> acted unreasonably at the hearing of the ancillaries_ or for other good
> reasons.
>
> (Emphasis added)

41\. Thus a party awarded costs for the hearing of the petition may not get
the costs for the hearing of the ancillary matters if it acted unreasonably.
This can be taken further. In an appropriate case a court may even find a
party’s conduct in respect to the ancillary matters so unreasonable that costs
be awarded against that party although it was awarded costs on the divorce
proper. To illustrate the point, a petitioner proceeds on the ground of
adultery. The respondent does not contest the petition, and costs therein are
awarded to the petitioner. On the ancillary matters, the petitioner makes
unjustified and unacceptable claims and demands on the matrimonial assets,
maintenance and care and custody of the children of the marriage and rejects
reasonable proposals from the respondent on these matters. In such a
situation, costs for the hearing of the ancillary matters may well be ordered
against the petitioner.

42\. The district judge had exercised his discretion to award costs for the
ancillary applications to the wife, and had fixed costs at $12,000, taking
into account the fact that the hearings took 2 days and the complexity in
computation. I did not think that the order was wrong in principle or
excessive in amount, and I affirmed the order.

__

Costs of the appeal

43\. Neither party has succeeded in getting what it wanted from the appeals.
The wife did not obtain the revision of the share of the matrimonial assets
she wanted, and the husband did not get the reduction of the wife’s
maintenance and the rescission of the order for costs. Looking at the matters
as a whole, I ordered that each party bears its own costs in the appeal.
