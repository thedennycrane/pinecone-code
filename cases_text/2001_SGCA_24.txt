**JUDGMENT (on costs):**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. On 30 March 2001, we handed down our judgment in this appeal, in which we
dismissed the appeal and reserved the question of costs for consideration
after hearing arguments from the parties. We have since then had the benefit
of considering the written submissions of counsel on the question.

2\. Four main issues were raised by the parties in this appeal. In the court
below, AXA raised a further issue of illegality on which the judge decided
against them, and they had not appealed against that part of her judgment. In
respect of that issue, she awarded the costs to Everbright. That order as to
costs stands, and will not be affected by the order we now make.

3\. The four main issues raised before us were also raised below. Of these, a
very important issue was whether the Sirena 1 being a chartered vessel fell
within the held covered clause in the ICC. Substantial arguments were devoted
to and a considerable amount of time was taken up on this issue, both here and
below, and on this issue Everbright succeeded. In view of this, the general
rule that costs follow the event should not apply, and AXA should be deprived
of a part of the costs, to which they would otherwise be entitled.

4\. In the circumstances, AXA should have only 2/3 of the costs here and
below. We accordingly so order. We reiterate that the order below awarding to
Everbright the costs for the issue of illegality raised by AXA is to remain
undisturbed. We make the usual consequential order directing the payment to
AXA or their solicitors of the security deposit in court, with interest, if
any, to account of their costs.
