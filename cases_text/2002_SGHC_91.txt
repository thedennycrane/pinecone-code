**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1 This is an appeal by the Defendants against the assessment by the Assistant
Registrar of the damages suffered by the Plaintiff in respect of a work-site
accident. On 8 April 2002, after hearing counsel for the parties, I allowed
the appeal by reducing the assessment in respect of the loss of future
earnings from $136,800 to $41,040. The other assessments were not altered. The
Plaintiff has since appealed and I now give my grounds of decision.

2 The Plaintiff is a 31-year old Chinese national. He came to Singapore in May
1998 to take up employment with China Construction (South Pacific) Development
Pte Ltd as a reinforcement ironworker. On 6 December 1999, while working in an
uncompleted carpark at Bukit Panjang, a motor lorry collided into him at the
back. This caused him to fall onto some iron rods. According to the medical
report of Dr Kenneth Mak of the National University Hospital, the Plaintiff
sustained the following injuries as a result of the accident:

(i) Laceration of the right liver, involving the posterior sector;

(ii) Laceration of the spleen, involving splenic hilum;

(iii) Right perinephric haematoma;

(iv) 2 cm laceration of the right thumb;

(v) 2 cm laceration of the right little finger;

(vi) 1 cm laceration of the right ring finger; and

(vii) Bilateral haemothoraces with underlying right lung contusion.

3 The Plaintiff was hospitalised until 23 December 1999, of which eight days
were spent in the intensive care unit. He was treated as an outpatient
thereafter but about a year later, in November 2000, he was warded for two
days. The Grounds of Decision ("the GD") of the Assistant Registrar sets out
the various medical reports that had been prepared by the doctors who examined
him and who had given evidence at the assessment. The GD deals with the
evidence in respect of the extent of the Plaintiff’s injuries and whether
there was any permanent residual incapacity. As far as the expert evidence was
concerned (at 11 of the GD):

> " … [i]t was generally agreed by the medical experts called that although
> the plaintiff suffered potentially life-threatening injuries, the plaintiff
> had recovered with little likelihood of permanent residual incapacity."

4 However the Plaintiff had complained that he still had a chronic low back
pain. The Assistant Registrar’s conclusion from an evaluation of the evidence
before the court was that the low back pain, although caused by the accident,
was not sufficiently debilitating because it was not supported by any clinical
signs. The expert had estimated that the Plaintiff would take about one year
to completely recover from his low back pain and the Assistant Registrar
accepted this evidence. After considering the remaining evidence and the
authorities the Assistant Registrar made the following assessments:

General Damages: |  | $ 46,000.00  
---|---|---  
Special Damages: |  |   
Medical expenses | $ 366.96 |   
Pre-trial loss of earnings: |  |   
109 days with medical leave: | $ 2,943.00 |   
606 days without medical leave: | $ 10,624.00 |   
Loss of future earnings | $136,800.00 |   
Total Special Damages: |  | _$150,733.96_  
Total Damages:  |  | $196,733.96  
  
5 I could not find any reason to interfere with the assessments of the
Assistant Registrar except in respect of the loss of future earnings. In
arriving at this assessment, she had used a multiplier of 17 on the basis of
his age. She considered that within that period, he would have been able to
work for another 7 years in Singapore and 10 years in China. As for the
multiplicand, the Plaintiff's submission of a monthly salary of $1,350 per
month in Singapore was not disputed. From that, the Assistant Registrar
deducted $150 for personal expenses and adopted $1,200 as the multiplicand in
respect of Singapore. As for the multiplicand in China, she also accepted the
Plaintiff’s evidence that it was $350 per month and, deducting $50 for
expenses, she took the figure of $300. Using these figures, the total figure
was arrived at through the following computation:

> Working Years in Singapore | $1,200 x 12 x 7 = | $100,800  
> ---|---|---  
> Working Years in China | $300 x 12 x 10 = | _$ 36,000_  
> Total: |  | $136,800  
  
6 I do not find anything wrong in her findings in respect of the figures.
However she had in effect awarded the Plaintiff loss of future earnings on the
basis that he would not be able to work at all. If the Plaintiff had been
totally incapacitated as a result of the injury and rendered unable to work at
all, this would have been the quantum he would have been entitled to. However
this is contrary to her finding that he would fully recover in about a year’s
time. Indeed, even in respect of the pre-trial loss of earnings, the Assistant
Registrar had made an assessment based on a partial loss rather than a full
loss. The Plaintiff’s claim in this respect is divided into two periods: (i)
the first period of 109 days covered by medical leave; and (ii) the second
period of 606 days without medical leave. In respect of the first period, the
Plaintiff’s claim of $27 per day for 109 days, amounting to $2,943, was
conceded by the Defendants. For the second period, the Assistant Registrar
made a finding on the evidence that the Plaintiff was able to undertake light
work and reduced the number of days by about 58%, from 606 to 256 days. Using
the figure of $41.50 per day (this is higher than the $27 per day in the first
period presumably because the Plaintiff was receiving some other payment
during his medical leave thereby reducing his damages), the assessment for
this second period comes to $10,624.

7 Because of the finding that the Plaintiff was only partially disabled and
would fully recover in a year’s time with little likelihood of permanent
residual incapacity, he was awarded about 42% of pre-trial loss of earning as
he was able to do some work during that period. Yet he was awarded 100% of the
quantum assessed as post-trial loss of earning. If he is expected to improve
even further, the award for post-trial loss becomes inexplicable. In my view,
this was an oversight on the part of the Assistant Registrar and she had
intended to reduce the latter sum after computing the full quantum. In view of
the fact that this was the only error in her otherwise unimpeachable
assessment, instead of remitting it to her for re-consideration, I was of the
view that I was able to make the determination based on the findings that she
had already made and the documents before me. I found that a reasonable
assessment would be to reduce the quantum by 70% on the basis that the
Plaintiff would suffer some reduced earning capacity on average over the
17-year period and I ordered accordingly.
