**JUDGMENT:**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. In this case, the plaintiffs, China Women Industry Development Corporation
(CWI), claimed from the defendants, Singapower Development Pte Ltd (SD), a
commission of US$500,000.00 for services allegedly rendered to resolve
problems faced by SD in relation to their investments in China. SD
acknowledged that they requested CWI to perform specified services. However,
they asserted that CWI were not entitled to the sum claimed because the
required services were not performed.

**

A. BACKGROUND

**

2\. SD, a company incorporated in Singapore, was formed to invest in power and
gas infrastructure projects in the Asian region. It invested in three power
projects in partnership with Chinese parties in Jiangsu Province, at Wuxi,
Nanjing and Kunshan. Jiangsu was chosen because it was identified as the
growth area in China.

3\. In Wuxi, SD and a Chinese company, Yangtat Realty Co Ltd, formed a joint
venture company, Sing-Yang. SD, held 70% of the shares of Sing-Yang while
Yangtat owned the remaining 30%. Under the joint venture agreement for the
Wuxi project, SD was assured that they would receive an annual return of 29%
on their investment for four years with effect from a specified date.

4\. In Kunshan, SD partnered a Chinese company, Kunshan City Electric
Construction and Development Co, and an American company, Asia Pacific Energy
and Environmental Technology Inc, in a joint venture company, Sing-Kun. SD
held 70% of the shares of Sing-Kun while the Chinese company and the American
company held 10% and 20% of the shares respectively. Under the joint venture
agreement for the Kunshan project, SD was assured an annual return of 30% on
their investment for four years with effect from a specified date.

5\. In Nanjing, SD and a Chinese company, Nanjing Third Steel, set up a joint
venture company, Sing-Su. SD held 60% of the shares of Sing-Su while the
Chinese partner held the remaining 40% of the shares. Under the joint venture
agreement for the Nanjing project, SD was assured that as from 19 months after
the incorporation of Sing-Su, they would receive an annual return of 29% on
their investment for four years.

6\. Things did not run smoothly in the three power projects. Various problems
began to surface from 1996. SDs money was misappropriated and promises made by
their Chinese joint venture partners, especially with respect to the
guaranteed annual return on SDs investments, were not fulfilled. After it
became known that SD had some difficulties in China, a number of "China
consultants" approached them, offering to help and professing that they were
well connected to government officials in China. Eventually, CWIs general
manager, Mr Shu Ji Fa, met SDs officers in April 1997. He offered to start
work immediately and asked for a letter authorising him to deal with the
problems arising out of the implementation of the joint venture agreements for
the three power projects.

7\. Regrettably, the business arrangement between CWI and SD was not
documented with sufficient clarity. For the purpose of determining the
respective rights of the parties, reference must first be made to SDs letter
dated 9 June 1997 to CWI. The letter stated as follows:

> We had also reported to the Board about seeking your assistance recently
> regarding recouping the sum invested and the funds of our Thermal Power
> Stations in Jiangsu Province.
>
> Attached herewith are the various commission proposal schedules concerning
> recouping the sum invested in the various Thermal Power Stations (See
> annexure 1, this proposal schedule is still subject to approval by our
> Board). The initial payment for resolving the various issues (see annexure
> 2) concerning the 3 thermal power stations project is USD60,000.00. As for
> subsequent payments, they shall be paid after recouping every year from the
> various items. The total amount of commission is limited to USD500,000.00.
> (Separate discussions shall be made for the details of the payment such as
> currency unit, payment unit and so on).
>
> We have already arranged for an Extraordinary Meeting of the Executive
> Committee of the Board to be held on 20 June and it is hoped that Mr Shu
> would give your comments concerning the proposal schedules before 11 June.

8\. The tasks which CWI had to carry out and the problems which SD faced in
Jiangsu were listed in an annex to the letter of 9 June 1997. CWI were
required to provide SD with the following:

> (a) general management consultancy services;
>
> (b) assistance in resolving outstanding issues with SDs Chinese partners;
> and
>
> (c) assistance in negotiations on future potential projects.

9\. As SD had no intention at the relevant time to expand their portfolio of
investments in China, CWI were in fact only required to assist in resolving
SDs problems in Wuxi, Kunshan and Nanjing. These problems, which were
specifically listed by SD in their letter of 9 June 1997, will be referred to
in detail later on in this judgment. All that has to be borne in mind at the
moment is SD made it plain that a common problem which had to be resolved in
all the three power projects was their Chinese partners failure to honour
their contractual obligation to provide SD with the guaranteed annual return
on their investments.

10\. Note must also be taken of the schedule for the payment of the proposed
commission, which was enclosed with SDs letter of 9 June 1997. The schedule is
as follows:

| ** PROPOSED COMMISSION**  
---|---  
PROJECT |  INITIAL PAYMENT | ** INVESTMENT RETURN**  
1st YEAR |  2ND YEAR |  3RD YEAR |  4TH YEAR |  TOTAL  
Wuxi Sing-Yang |  15,000 |  24,000 |  24,000 |  24,000 |  24,000 |  111,000  
Kunshan Sing-Kun |  10,000 |  20,000 |  20,000 |  20,000 |  20,000 |  90,000  
Nanjing Sing-Su |  35,000 |  66,000 |  66,000 |  66,000 |  66,000 |  299,000  
Total (US$) | ** 60,000** | ** 110,000** | ** 110,000** | ** 110,000** | ** 110,000** | ** 500,000**  
  
11\. On 11 June 1997, CWI replied to SDs letter of 9 June 1997\. In the
letter, its general manager, Mr Shu, stated as follows:

> 1\. "Singapower" entrusts our company to provide three services. Our company
> is able to accede to the first item of "General operating management
> advisory services" and the third item of "Assistance in negotiations on
> future potential projects."
>
> As for the second item of "Assistance in resolving outstanding issues with
> Chinese partners", owing to the fact that parts of the contents of the
> feasibility study reports on the three existing projects in Jiangsu provided
> by the Chinese partners during the initial stage of co-operation were not
> true, and on top of that, some objective conditions have since changed, for
> example, state enterprises are facing recession with insufficient work,
> leading to a big gap between the originally conceived rate of return of
> investment and the reality. According to our view, it is very difficult to
> expect the Chinese parties to strictly honour the 28% rate of return of
> investment in the original contract. Therefore, our company is more
> confident with the other problems in the second item. With regard to the
> execution of the article on rate of return of investment, all we can do is
> to work hard to help.
>
> With regard to commissions, in principle, we agree to what you have
> proposed. However, as more expenses are required at the early stage of work,
> we suggest that the initial payment of commission be increased to
> US$100,000.00.

12\. SD did not respond to CWIs request for an increased initial payment. On
14 October 1997, Mr Shu was granted a Power of Attorney to act for SD in
handling and co-ordinating the "matters relating to the three electrical
plants in Jiangsu".

13\. In due course, SD found CWI to be ineffective in resolving their
problems. By early 1998, SD accepted that other courses of action had to be
taken to break the impasse in Jiangsu. On 20 March 1998, SD wrote a letter to
Mr Shu, which made it plain that SD contemplated other means of resolving
their problems. The letter was couched in the following terms:

> Based on the present situation of the power plants, we have decided not to
> invest any more funds and we will be working to stop the operation and
> construction of the plants and recover our investment.
>
> The decisions of the Board of Directors are summarised as follows:
>

>> (I) The Singapore party will not invest any more fund or have any more
undertaking unless there is an improvement of the situation.

>>

>> (II) We will recover our investment through various channels.

>
> We hope that you could put forward your views as soon as possible.

14\. On 26 March 1998, Mr Shu replied to SD. In his letter, he stated as
follows:

> Our views on the decisions of the Board of Directors of Singapower concerned
> are as follows:
>
> 1\. Basically, we agree with the views of your Board of Directors to settle
> the relevant problems of the three projects through legal means as soon as
> possible.
>
> 4\. Employ a professional lawyer in the area of electrical power investment
> to commence early preparatory work for court action.
>
> The above are our views for your consideration.

15\. According to SD, the above letter of 26 March 1998 was the last
communication between them and Mr Shu. After a deafening silence of almost two
years, CWIs counsel, Mr G Raman, wrote a letter to the Chairman of Singapore
Power, Mr Ho Kwon Ping, on 9 February 2000. In this letter, Mr Raman stated as
follows:

> We are instructed that our clients have discharged their duty as agreed upon
> and have obtained payments for [SD] from the relevant Chinese parties.
>
> As agreed therefore payment has to be made by [SD].

16\. As SD did not pay CWI the amount claimed, CWI instituted this action to
recover US$500,000.00, which they said was commission due to them for having
discharged their obligations to SD.

**

B. WHEN WAS THE COMMISSION PAYABLE?

**

17\. CWI contended that the payment of commission by SD was not dependent on
whether or not they succeeded in resolving SDs problems in Jiangsu. In his
written submissions, Mr Raman stated as follows:

> It will be obvious that the Plaintiffs services were of a general nature and
> not specific. If I may use a shorthand, it was to use the "political clout"
> that the Plaintiffs had with the authorities in China.

18\. In contrast, SD contended that they hired CWI on a "no cure no pay"
basis. In view of this, the first instalment of the agreed commission,
referred to in the agreement as the "initial payment", is not due to CWI until
and unless SDs problems in the Jiangsu projects have been resolved. SD added
that as CWI failed to achieve results, the question of payment of commission
did not arise. If this is right, there would be no necessity to consider
whether the parties finally agreed that the initial payment was to be
US$60,000.00, as SD proposed in their letter to CWI dated 9 June 1997, or
US$100,000.00, as CWI suggested in their reply dated 11 June 1997.

19\. In view of SDs stand, it would be useful at the outset to determine the
circumstances under which CWI is entitled to the initial payment referred to
in the schedule of payments and when SD is obliged to make the subsequent
payments.

____

20\. SD contended that their approach on the date of payment of commission was
reflected in their letter of 9 June 1997 to CWI, which provided as follows:

> The initial payment _for resolving_ the various issues (see annexure 2)
> concerning the 3 thermal power stations project is USD60,000.00. As for
> subsequent payments, they shall be paid _after recouping every year from the
> various items_.
>
> (emphasis added).

21\. SDs former chairman, Mr Lai Park On, explained SDs position as follows
during cross-examination:

> Q. You wanted Mr Shu to continue to help?
>
> A. It was quite clear from the start that Mr Shu had to resolve outstanding
> issues and the most important of the outstanding issues was SDs guaranteed
> annual return on investments. This was contained in the joint venture
> agreement. When we discussed how to proceed, Mr Shu made a number of
> suggestions but we maintained all along that payment was to be for achieving
> the guaranteed rate of return. Mr Shu said that it was best left to him to
> adopt the methods that would be effective in China in the Chinese way. I
> made it very clear that it was payment by results and left him to follow
> whatever methods he felt effective in China.

22\. The concept of a result-oriented plan for the payment of commission to
CWI was also reflected in the minutes of the meeting of SDs Board of Directors
on 13 June 1997. It is important to note that in para 10 of his affidavit of
evidence-in-chief, Mr Shu referred to and relied on the said minutes of SDs
Board of Directors to show that SD did offer him a commission plan. The
following extract of those minutes was reproduced by Mr Shu in his affidavit
of evidence-in-chief:

> Exco deliberated on the proposed commission plan for [CWI]. _In the result-
> oriented plan_ , an initial payment amounting to US$60,000 would be payable
> _upon settlement of all outstanding issues encountered with our Chinese
> partners_ and thereafter subsequent commission would be directly based on
> yearly investment return received by Singapower. Total commission to [CWI]
> would be kept at US$500,000.
>
> (emphasis added)

23\. In his eagerness to hold SD to the commission plan, Mr Shu did not, when
reproducing the above-mentioned extract from the minutes of SDs Board of
Directors in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, say that he disagreed with
any aspect of the said minutes. As such, he must be taken as not having
disagreed with the following points made in the said minutes:

> (a) CWI was offered a "result-oriented plan" for the payment of commission.
>
> (b) An initial payment would only be made upon settlement of the outstanding
> issues encountered with SDs Chinese partners.
>
> (c) Subsequent commissions would be directly based on yearly investment
> returns received by SD.

24\. In view of the aforesaid, it is surprising that CWIs counsel, Mr G Raman,
asserted that the initial payment promised by SD was due immediately upon
signing the contract and that the remaining four instalments were due on the
1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th year following the due date for the first payment.

25\. Mr Shus secretary, Mr Liu Feng, did not support Mr Ramans contention that
the initial payment promised by SD was due immediately after the consultancy
agreement was entered into. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> Q. How much did the defendants promise to pay the plaintiffs?
>
> A. US$500,000.00
>
> Q. Any particular date of payment?
>
> A. I do not remember they mentioned a specific date.

26\. Mr Raman attempted to support his contention that the initial payment was
immediately due after CWI was appointed SDs consultants by asserting that SD
had already paid CWI part of the initial payment when they remitted
RMB160,000.00 to Mr Shu in November 1997. This assertion is flawed for the
simple reason that in para 11 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Shu
complained that SD had failed to pay even the initial payment due to CWI.
Besides, if the RMB160,000.00 was part of the initial payment due from SD to
CWI, it is pertinent to note that after the said sum was remitted to Mr Shu in
November 1997, CWI did not write to SD to claim the balance of the sum
allegedly due as the initial payment for their services.

27\. In fact, the RMB160,000.00 forwarded to Mr Shu by SD in October 1997 was
intended to be an advance sum to cover expenses of third parties involved in
assisting SD in resolving the problems faced in Jiangsu. In his letter dated
20 October 1997 to SD, Mr Shu himself referred to the need for a fund for
expenses when he said as follows:

> Solving the problems of Sing-Kun is a kind of complex system engineering
> that involves a number of issues and requires a long time to work on.
> Moreover, the relevant work of the working group requires a certain amount
> of fund. Therefore, we suggest that [SD] come up with a starting fund that
> includes transport expenses.

28\. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Lai Park On, the then chairman
of SD, shed light on why Mr Shu was paid RMB160,000.00 in November 1997 when
he said as follows:

> 33\. . Mr Shu had proposed forming a task force to further investigate the
> approach to resolve the outstanding issues in Sing-Kun and requested for
> funds to defray the expenses and costs of this task-force.
>
> 34\. . since a significant sum would be incurred in the engagement of third
> parties (e.g. lawyers and other experts) and not CWIDC themselves, it was
> fair to reimburse Mr Shu the expenses paid out. [Our general manager]
> suggested an advance payment of US$40,000.
>
> 36\. In the end, the figure of US$20,000 (or about RMB160,000) was agreed

29\. I thus find that the RMB160,000.00 paid to Mr Shu was to cover expenses
and was not a part payment of the initial sum referred to in the schedule on
payment of commission in SDs letter of 9 June 1997. I also find that it was
agreed between SD and CWI that the initial and subsequent payments promised to
CWI were to be made only after CWI has succeeded in resolving the problems
referred to in SDs letter dated 9 June 1997.

**

C. DID CWI PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS?

**

30\. As it has been established that CWI is not entitled to the commission
claimed unless they performed the tasks undertaken by them, it would be
appropriate at this juncture to determine whether the said tasks were
performed.

31\. CWI claimed in para 7 of their statement of claim that they had rendered
services in resolving the disputes which SD had with their Chinese partners
but this claim was not supported by facts.

__

The guaranteed annual return on SDs investments

__

32\. As has been mentioned, the joint venture agreements between SD and their
Chinese partners guaranteed a hefty annual return on SDs investments. To SD,
the most important problem to be resolved by CWI was the Chinese parties
failure to honour the joint venture agreement provisions on the guaranteed
annual return on their investments. Mr Lai Park On, who was SDs chairman from
1994 to September 1998, explained that if Mr Shu had managed to obtain for SD
the guaranteed annual return on their investments, SD would have been quite
happy to pay CWI the commission claimed.

33\. I am mindful of the fact that as far as the question of the guaranteed
annual return on SDs investments is concerned, Mr Shu said in his letter to SD
dated 11 June 1997 that it was very difficult to get the Chinese parties to
strictly honour their promise in relation to the guaranteed rate of return on
SDs investments and all he could say was that CWI would work hard to get the
Chinese parties to honour this contractual obligation. However, SD contended
that they did not agree with CWI that the latter was only required to do their
best to ensure that the guaranteed annual return on investments was paid. This
assertion is not without foundation. After all, the basis for hiring CWI as
consultants was to ensure that SD received the guaranteed annual return on
their investments. It would have been of no comfort to SD if their other
problems in Jiangsu were resolved without them obtaining the guaranteed annual
return on their investments. I thus find that it was a term of the contract
that CWI was required to obtain for SD the guaranteed annual return on their
investments before they were entitled to any commission.

34\. To date, SD has not received the guaranteed annual return on their
investments in the three Jiangsu power projects. Although CWI claimed to have
obtained payments for SD from the relevant Chinese parties, Mr Shu was not
sure as to what this meant in the context of the guaranteed annual return on
SDs investments. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> Q. On the guaranteed returns in Wuxi, Kunshan and Nanjing, is it your case
> that you managed to get the defendants guaranteed returns in all four years?
>
> A. Part of the returns.
>
> Q. How did you know there are returns?
>
> A. SDs representative in Kunshan told me.
>
> Q. Do you really know whether SD made a profit or had returns for their
> investment?
>
> A. I dont know.

35\. Mr Shus answers to questions relating to the guaranteed annual return on
SDs investments in Jiangsu and his evidence on CWIs efforts to resolve SDs
other problems in Jiangsu, which will be discussed below, led me to conclude
that even if CWIs obligation was merely to do their best to ensure that SD
obtained the guaranteed annual return on their investments in Jiangsu, this
obligation has not been performed.

__

SDs other problems in Jiangsu

__

36\. Apart from failing to secure for SD the payment of the guaranteed annual
return on their investments, Mr Shu was woefully unaware of the magnitude of
the other problems which he had undertaken to resolve. What is more alarming
is that he did not think that it was his task to resolve the problems listed
in SDs letter of 9 June 1997 to CWI. During cross-examination, he said as
follows:

> Q. What did you do in Kunshan after May 1997 on behalf of the defendants?
>
> A. To co-ordinate relationship with local officials. I did not give an
> undertaking to resolve these problems. These were problems listed by the
> Singapore party. They raised these problems so that I could understand the
> situation. Based on the situation, I would put up a proposal to resolve the
> problem of the entire plant.

37\. Mr Shus assertion cannot be accepted. After all, in his reply to SDs
letter of 9 June 1997, he had stated that apart from the question of the
guaranteed returns, his company was "more confident with the other problems"
listed in the annex to the letter of 9 June 1997. In any case, if, as Mr Shu
claims, his task was merely to understand the problems so that he could put up
a proposal to resolve the problem of the entire plant, he did not reveal how
his proposals were to be implemented and how "the problem of the entire plant"
was resolved.

38\. A short discussion of the problems faced in SDs three power projects in
Jiangsu will show that despite the hiring of CWI, most of the problems
remained unresolved.

__

Problems in the Wuxi project

__

39\. SDs problems in Wuxi, as outlined in SDs letter of 9 June 1997, are as
follows:

> a. Land
>
> b. Final construction cost
>
> c. Unauthorised bank transaction
>
> d. Honoring contractual obligations eg. min power offtake, guaranteed
> return, paying loan interest and management fees
>
> e. Monitoring the operation and maintenance
>
> f. Liaise with authorities.

__

40\. The first problem mentioned above, namely land use, was not resolved by
CWI. When cross-examined, Mr Shu said as follows:

> Q. Regarding the Wuxi land problem, what was this problem about?
>
> A. The defendants asked us to assist in going through formalities on the
> land certificate.
>
> Q. Did they get the land certificate ultimately?
>
> A. No.

41\. As for the second problem in Wuxi, which concerned the finalisation of
the construction cost, Mr Shu again shed very little light on the issue. When
cross-examined, he said as follows:

____

> Q. What is the problem of the final construction cost about?
>
> A. To finalise the construction cost with the Chinese partners.
>
> Q. Has the issue of finalisation of the construction cost been resolved?
>
> A. I dont know.

42\. The third problem in Wuxi concerned unauthorised bank transactions. Mr
Shus answers were rather unhelpful. In reply to questions put to him during
cross-examination, he said as follows:

> Q. What is the problem concerning unauthorised bank transactions?
>
> A. The Chinese party took a loan without consulting the Singapore party.
>
> Q. How much was the loan?
>
> A. I dont know.
>
> Q. Did you solve the problem?
>
> A. Someone from the municipal authority said they would solve the problem.
>
> Q. Do you agree that the problem remains unresolved?
>
> A. It was resolved in 1999.
>
> Q. According to you, the municipal authorities resolved this problem in
> 1999?
>
> A. Yes.

43\. In the face of such unhelpful answers, I intervened and Mr Shus reply was
unequivocal. He said as follows:

> Ct. Do you really know whether the problem concerning unauthorised bank
> transactions has been resolved?
>
> A. I dont know.

44\. As for the next problem in Wuxi, namely the obligation to ensure that
there was a minimum power offtake, Mr Shu conceded that the problem has not
been resolved.

45\. As for the monitoring of the operation and maintenance of the Wuxi plant,
a problem which vexed SD, Mr Shu conceded that CWI did nothing. When cross-
examined, he said:

> Q. The next problem relates to the monitoring of operation and maintenance.
> What was this problem about?
>
> A. We did not monitor the operation and maintenance.

46\. In short, notwithstanding Mr Shus claim that he had talked to government
officials and SDs Chinese partners to further SDs interests, CWI failed to
carry out the task of solving the many problems faced by SD in the Wuxi
project, the most important of which was to ensure that SD obtained the
guaranteed annual return on their investments.

__

Kunshan Project

__

47\. A review of CWIs role in resolving disputes in the Kunshan project will
also show that CWI failed to accomplish the tasks they had undertaken on
behalf of SD. The problems in this project, which were made known to Mr Shu in
SDs letter of 9 June 1997, are as follows:

> a. Fund recovery/Project completion
>
> b. Honoring contractual terms eg. guaranteed completion, minimum power
> offtake, guaranteed return.
>
> c. Monitoring the operation and maintenance
>
> d. Liaise with authorities.

48\. The first task in Kunshan entrusted to Mr Shu, as listed above, was "fund
recovery". This concerned a misappropriation by SDs Chinese partner of more
than US$2m of SDs funds. Mr Shus evidence merits attention. When cross-
examined, he said as follows:

> Q. Did you succeed in getting the funds recovered?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Q. How much was recovered?
>
> A. RMB1.5m was the first sum. I did not deal with the management so I dont
> know what happened afterwards. No need for me to know all this.

49\. Mr Shus evidence on the recovery of the misappropriated funds was clearly
unreliable. To begin with, it appears that the sum of RMB1.5m referred to by
him had nothing to do with the recovery of the money which had been
misappropriated. Instead, it was a sum injected into the project. More
importantly, it is surprising that Mr Shu said that there was no need for him
to know "what happened afterwards". As he was entrusted with the task of
recovering more than US$2m in misappropriated funds, how can he be satisfied
merely because the sum of RMB1.5m was recovered? His answers to further
questions on the subject of misappropriation showed why his evidence could not
benefit CWIs case. He said as follows:

> Q. You dont know what else was recovered?
>
> A. Further sums were recovered but I dont know how much.
>
> Ct. Do you know whether the entire sum was recovered?
>
> A. I understood this from Mr Tai, the general manager of Shipai Town.
>
> Q. When did he tell you?
>
> A. I forgot. Middle of 2000.
>
> Ct. Do you really know whether the entire sum was recovered?
>
> A. I dont know.

50\. As for the second problem in Kunshan, namely the delayed completion of
the project, there was concern that the delay would make it more difficult for
SD to obtain an early return on their investments. Mr Shu, who knew little
about this problem, even suggested that it was not his responsibility to
resolve it. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> Q. Do you know when the project was supposed to start?
>
> A. I emphasize that I do not deal with specific work. I do not know when the
> project was to start.
>
> Q. Do you know when the project was supposed to end?
>
> A. It was in two phases. The second phase commenced with our assistance but
> I did not know when it commenced.
>
> Q. When was Phase Two supposed to be completed according to the contract?
>
> A. SD did not give me such a contract. I did not know the actual date.
>
> Q. Your agreement states that this is a problem to be resolved. Please
> answer the question.
>
> A. In early 1997.
>
> Q. I put it to you that as you do not even know the date of completion and
> installation, you did not have much to do with this.
>
> A. Disagree. I did not know the details.

51\. From the above answers, it is evident that Mr Shus claim that CWI
assisted in the commencement of the second phase of the project cannot be
accepted.

52\. As for the problem of minimum power offtake in Kunshan, Mr Shu knew that
the authorities had to be persuaded to purchase the electricity that was
generated by the plant. However, he denied that he was asked to resolve this
problem even though it was listed as a problem to be resolved in SDs letter of
9 June 1997 to CWI. When pressed to state whether he had solved the problem,
he claimed to have solved this problem "indirectly". However, he did not know
when this problem was resolved and he based his evidence on information
received from a third party. Notwithstanding this, he claimed credit for
resolving this problem.

53\. As for the question of monitoring the operation of the plant and its
maintenance, Mr Shu confirmed that he had nothing to do with these.

54\. In the face of the problems which the Kunshan project faced
notwithstanding the entry of CWI into the scene, SD concluded, with
justification, that Mr Shus meetings and liaising with the authorities had
borne no fruit.

__

Nanjing Project

__

55\. SDs relationship with CWI with respect to their Nanjing project was also
an unhappy one. SDs problems in Nanjing, as outlined in SDs letter of 9 June
1997 to CWI, are as follows:

> a. State energy loan/Project completion
>
> b. Land
>
> c. 35 KVA supply lines
>
> d. Comprehensive energy utilization plant application
>
> e. Power/steam offtake
>
> f. Honoring contractual terms eg. guaranteed completion, guaranteed return
>
> g. Liaise with authorities.

56\. With respect to the first of the abovementioned problems, namely the
securing of a state energy loan, SD wanted the joint venture company to have
the benefit of a state energy loan and CWI was required to ensure that the
loan was forthcoming. Apparently, Mr Shu knew very little about this issue.
When cross-examined, he was imprecise and inaccurate. He said as follows:

__

> Q. State energy loan. What was this issue about?
>
> A. Defendants requested a loan.
>
> Q. Did they get a loan?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Q. When did they get a loan?
>
> A. I did not know the details.
>
> Q. How much was the loan?
>
> A. I dont know.
>
> Q. You were given copies of the Nanjing project accounts. From these, can
> you tell us whether a loan was obtained?
>
> A. I never looked at the accounts.
>
> Q. Having looked at the accounts for the Nanjing project, have you found
> anything regarding the energy loan?
>
> A. Not in the accounts. As the Chinese partner of SD did not have funds to
> inject into the project, I assisted them to get a loan.
>
> Q. You are saying that the loan was to the Chinese party?
>
> A. Yes. Not the joint venture company but the Chinese partner in the joint
> venture company.

57\. At this juncture, I intervened and Mr Shus answer clearly showed that CWI
did not resolve the problem in relation to the energy loan. He said as
follows:

> Ct. A loan to the Chinese party is very different from the energy loan
> presently being discussed. Was an energy loan obtained?
>
> A. No, there was no energy loan.

58\. As for the problem of land in Nanjing, this concerned the question of
land use, which SDs Chinese partners failed to settle with the authorities.
Again, Mr Shu conceded during cross-examination that the problem was not
resolved. On the next day, Mr Raman pointed out that it appeared from SDs own
internal documents that a land use right certificate for 22 years had been
issued for the Nanjing project on 31 March 1998. This does not help Mr Shu
very much as it reveals that he did not take a sufficient interest in an
important matter such as land use.

59\. With regard to the problem of the 35 KVA supply lines, Mr Shu knew little
about it and conceded that it was not resolved.

60\. The next problem in Nanjing to be discussed concerns the comprehensive
energy utilisation plant application. Mr Shu admitted that he had the task of
ensuring that the application was successful. However, he did not even know
the outcome of the application. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> Q. Why were you asked to handle this?
>
> A. To get the government to use the energy produced by the plant.
>
> Q. Was the application for comprehensive energy utilisation plant
> successful?
>
> A. I am not sure.
>
> Q. You do not know whether the problem was solved?
>
> A. I am not sure.

61\. With respect to the honouring of contractual terms, apart from their
failure to receive the guaranteed annual return on their investment in
Nanjing, the problems faced by SD in getting their Chinese partners to abide
by the contractual terms were many. When cross-examined, Mr Shu said that he
was aware of SDs problems but his answers to questions during cross-
examination showed that he really did not know much about the problems. He
said as follows:

> Q. On the question of honouring the contractual terms, the Chinese party did
> not put in the amount required, there was a delay in completion and there
> were general problems such as that concerning power and steam off-take.
> These cover most of the problems?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Q. Do you know whether the problem of the unpaid contribution of the Chinese
> party was resolved?
>
> A. I dont know.
>
> Q. The guaranteed completion date of the plant was a major problem. It was
> raised with you on numerous occasions. Do you know whether this problem was
> finally resolved and whether the plant has been completed?
>
> A. I dont know.
>
> Q. Has the problem of the power and steam offtake been resolved?
>
> A. I dont know.

62\. To sum up, Mr Shu knew so little about the problems in the Nanjing
project that it may be said, with justification, that his services could not
have been of much use to SD and were certainly not of a level that required
any payment of commission under the terms of CWIs agreement with SD.

__

What CWI claimed to have achieved

__

63\. What CWI claimed to have achieved on behalf of SD was summarised by Mr
Shu in para 14 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, in which he made three
claims, one each with respect to the Kunshan, Wuxi and Nanjing projects.

64\. In relation to the Kunshan project, Mr Shu stated that his achievement
was evident from the following internal memorandum dated 3 February 1998 from
Mr Lucas Lee, SDs general manager:

> Singapower appointed a Shu Jifa ("Shu") based in Beijing to help expedite
> the fund and project recovery using contacts in Beijing, Provincial and
> local governments. Through his initial contact, the deputy mayor of Kunshan
> city arranged for RMB1.5m contribution for the fund recovery programme.

65\. The question of the fund recovery programme in Kunshan has already been
discussed. All that needs to be said here is that Mr Shu admitted during
cross-examination that the RMB1.5m did not have anything to do with the fund
recovery project. As such, his claim in para 14 of his affidavit of evidence-
in-chief is baseless.

66\. In relation to the Nanjing project, Mr Shu summarised his achievement by
pointing out that SD conceded in an internal memorandum from Mr Lucas Lee
dated 25 September 1998 that "there has been much improvement in the operating
environment since the senior teams visit" in April 1998. Again, this claim is
without foundation. The senior team comprised senior staff of SD, such as
their then chairman. Mr Shu was not a member of the team and he cannot claim
credit for the improvement in the operating environment which resulted from
the senior teams visit. His task was to ensure that the overall operating
environment for SD improved to the extent that SD could recover the guaranteed
annual return on their investment in the Kunshan project. There is no question
that his performance in this regard fell far short of what he had been
required to do.

67\. In relation to the Wuxi project, Mr Shu stated his success in the
following terms:

> The net income for the year ended 31.12.1999 has been shown as
> RMB22,684,808.33 which has put the operations in the black. This vital
> information is found in the Accounting Statements by Wuxi Gongzheng
> Certified Public Accountants Co Ltd for the said period.

68\. It was pointed out to Mr Shu that the figure of RMB22,684,808.33 in the
companys accounts was nothing more than an accounting entry which balanced the
receivables for the past few years. In short, the net income of the company
for the year in question was not RMB22,684,808.33. Mr Shu conceded his error
when he said as follows during cross-examination:

> Q. Do you agree that in 1999, there was no cash inflow of RMB22.6m?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Q. I put it to you that there was actually no money flowing in because the
> receivables were never received.
>
> A. I do not know. I am not sure because the accounts were kept from me.
>
> Ct. Do you really know whether the company had a net income of RMB 22.6m?
>
> A. I am not sure.

69\. Mr Shu also highlighted in paras 15 and 16 of his affidavit of evidence-
in-chief some other achievements of CWI. Again, these proved to be illusory.
In para 15 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated as follows:

> 15\. The Defendants have more than benefited from the service that the
> Plaintiffs have rendered. I would refer to the report by their own auditors
> to support this fact. In the report by [Price Waterhouse] for the year ended
> 31.12.1999 on the project in Kunshan they have referred to the re-
> structuring that had taken place in the company operating the Kunshan
> Project and have stated in very clear terms that "management had prepared a
> cash flow forecast for the next financial year and believe that the bank
> loan of RMB2,500,000 can be extended and the company will not have cash flow
> problems in the next 12 months so that the company can be operated as a
> going concern." These changes in the fortunes of the Defendants have been
> made possible by the involvement of the Plaintiffs.

70\. Mr Shu quoted the report in question out of context. It was one which was
based on the assumption that the Chinese parties would fulfil their part of
the bargain. The same forecast had been made in the previous years accounts
and had proven to be wrong. When cross-examined, Mr Shu conceded that he had
referred to a mere forecast and not a fact. He said as follows:

> Q. Do you agree that your statement in para 15 of your affidavit of
> evidence-in-chief regarding the absence of cash flow problems is meaningless
> because it was based on a forecast that was also made in the previous year
> and proved to be untrue.
>
> A. I agree that it was a forecast and that it was one that did not come true
> in the previous year.

71\. Mr Shus claim in para 16 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief must next
be considered. He stated as follows:

> 16\. In the report on the Wuxi Project, [Price Waterhouse] is more upbeat.
> In their report for the year ended 31.12.1998 they have stated that, "in
> 1998, the company has obtained the approval of State Foreign Exchange Bureau
> to remit an amount of US$220,000 (equivalent to RMB1,822,857) to the foreign
> investor as part of the annual return of investment." The Defendants have
> thereby benefited directly from what the Plaintiffs had done for them.

72\. When it was pointed out to Mr Shu that the relevant documents did not
reveal that there had been a return on SDs investments in Jiangsu, Mr Shu
conceded that he was wrong. During cross-examination, he said as follows:

> Q. Having seen the documents, do you still maintain that the US$220,000 is a
> return on the defendants investments?
>
> A. . The US$220,000 was not a return on the defendants investments in Wuxi.

**

D. SUMMARY OF MY FINDINGS

**

73\. As I have found that CWI is only entitled to claim a commission after
they have succeeded in resolving SDs problems in Jiangsu, the most urgent of
which was to obtain the guaranteed annual return on their investments, CWI
cannot be remunerated because SDs problems in relation to the joint venture
agreements were not resolved.

74\. Mr Shu claimed to have done much for SD. However, he was unable to
furnish evidence of what he claimed CWI had accomplished. All he could provide
as evidence of his work were vague references to meetings with local officials
and he sought to credit every advance made in the three power plants in
Jiangsu to his meetings with important persons. He made references to reports
which he prepared but failed to reveal how useful they were. In fact, he was
not even sure as to how many reports he prepared. When cross-examined, he
said:

> Q. You attended meetings and put up reports in 1999?
>
> A. 1997, 1998 and 1999.
>
> Q. Where is the 1999 report?
>
> A. My last report was on 26 March 1998 and my other report was to remind on
> 14 September 1999.

75\. The claim with the forwarding of reports on 26 March 1998 and 14
September 1999 is absolutely baseless. In fact, the alleged report of 14
September 1999 was nothing more than a letter requesting SD to pay money to
CWI. It stated as follows:

> Ever since we accepted the assignment to resolve investment problems in the
> three power plants, we have done a lot of work. At the moment, problems of
> the three plants, especially in the Kunshan plant, have been settled and
> have started to generate electricity. Unfortunately, your company has not
> honoured the promise by your chairman and general manager during the initial
> stage of operation. While co-operating with you, we have reported this
> matter to the company and obtained their support. After that, your company
> has not made any response to our achievement and we are not able to explain
> to the leadership. If your company is not able to deal with the matter, we
> will take legal action to resolve the matter. We hope that your company will
> take a decision so as not to affect the friendly ties between the two
> companies.

Why Mr Shu called his letter of 14 September 1999 a "report" is beyond
comprehension.

76\. CWIs case was also not helped when Mr Shu was not even clear as to when
CWI stopped providing services to SD. It is not in dispute that SD did not
formally terminate CWIs services. Although SD should have put on record that
the consultancy arrangement was over, they thought this to be unnecessary
since payment of the agreed commission was on the basis of results achieved by
CWI. Mr Shu accepted that by the second half of 1998, he had no contacts with
SD on any matter. When questioned by me, he answered as follows:

> Ct. Why did you go to the plant?
>
> A. In the second half of 1998, SD had little contact with me. I did not know
> what was going on. When I passed by, I would definitely take a look.
>
> Ct. Are you saying that SD had "little" contact with you or no contact at
> all?
>
> A. No contact at all. We did not know why.

77\. The above answers by Mr Shu show that by the second half of 1998, CWI
should have realised that SD no longer had any faith in them. In view of the
cessation of communications between SD and CWI by the second half of 1998, Mr
Shus inconsistent answers regarding the date when CWI ceased to work for SD
merit close scrutiny.

78\. On the first day of the trial, Mr Shu accepted that CWI stopped working
for SD in August 1998. When cross-examined, he said:

> Q. You stopped assisting the defendants in March 1998?
>
> A. No, I continued to work for that company.
>
> Q. When did you work for the defendants until?
>
> A. Until August 1998.

79\. On the second day of the trial, Mr Shu gave two cessation dates. During
cross-examination, he first offered June 1998 as the cessation date. He said
as follows:

> Q. When did you stop working for the defendants?
>
> A. Basically, I stopped working for them in June 1998.

80\. When further cross-examined, he changed the cessation date to September
1999. He said as follows:

> Q. After June 1998, all activities were carried out in your personal
> capacity and not as the defendants consultants?
>
> A. No. I was their consultant because no one informed me to discontinue my
> work. I ceased working after 14 September 1999, when we sent a fax message
> to Lucas Lee.

81\. When the inconsistency in the cessation dates was pointed out to Mr Shu,
he said that after June 1998, CWIs involvement with SD did not cease as he
continued to co-ordinate SDs legal suits. During cross-examination, he
explained as follows:

> After June 1998, all work in relation to business operations ceased after SD
> decided to take legal action. Legal work had to be done after that. We still
> had to work on the legal proceedings.

82\. Mr Shu claimed to have instructed a Shanghai law firm, Xiaoyun, to handle
SDs proposed law suit. However, SD has, to date, never dealt with this law
firm and Mr Shu admitted that he did not inform SD about his consultations
with Xiaoyun in relation to SDs legal matters. When cross-examined, he said as
follows:

> Q. After meeting the Shanghai lawyers, did you inform the defendants about
> this?
>
> A. I tried to contact the defendants by phone. Subsequently, we requested
> the defendants representative in Kunshan to contact the defendants chairman
> to let him know that we would like to meet him to discuss preparatory work
> for the law suit.
>
> Q. You never wrote to the defendants about the plans for the law suit.
>
> A. I did not write to them.

83\. Mr Shus evidence cannot be taken seriously. It is unbelievable that he
would spend time at a law firm no one asked him to instruct in order to co-
ordinate a law suit without receiving any instructions on the matter from SD
and without informing SD as to what he was doing.

84\. Whatever Mr Shu may have claimed to have done, his concession that SD
wanted to withdraw from the Jiangsu projects because their problems were not
resolved cannot but be unhelpful to CWIs claim. In reply to questions which I
posed, he said as follows:

> Ct. Why did the defendants sell their shares?
>
> A. They felt that the problems were hard to resolve.
>
> Ct. This means that the problems were not resolved?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Ct. Why then did you say earlier on that the problems were resolved?
>
> A. In my view, once they got back their investments, problem would be
> resolved.

85\. As it was evident that SD did not get back the expected returns on their
investments in Jiangsu and most of their other problems in Wuxi, Kunshan and
Nanjing were not resolved, CWI must be taken to have failed to accomplish the
mission in respect of which they were retained as consultants. In the
circumstances, CWI is not entitled to the commission referred to in SDs letter
of 9 June 1997.

**

E. CWIS ALTERNATIVE CLAIM

**

86\. Reference must now be made to CWIs alternative claim. In their statement
of claim, CWI pleaded that it was an express or implied term of the contract
that SD would pay CWI a reasonable sum for their services.

87\. CWI did not even attempt to prove that there was an express term to the
effect that SD would pay them a reasonable sum for their services. As for an
implied term, it is clear that a term will only be implied if it is necessary
to give business efficacy to the contract and that a term will not be implied
if it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. (See, for
instance, _Lee Siong Kee v Beng Tiong Trading, Import and Export (1988) Pte
Ltd_[2000] 4 SLR 559, 570, a decision of the Court of Appeal, and _Lynch v
Thorne_[1956] 1 WLR 303.) In the present case, the contract between SD and CWI
clearly provided for the payment of remuneration only after CWI has resolved
SDs problems in the Jiangsu projects. There is thus no room for CWI to claim
from SD a reasonable remuneration for their services on the basis of an
implied term.

**

F. SECTION 116 OF THE EVIDENCE ACT

**

88\. Finally, reference must be made to CWIs assertion that an adverse
inference should be drawn from the fact that SD did not call Mr Lucas Lee,
their former general manager, as a witness.

89\. Section 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) provides as follows:

> The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to
> have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events,
> human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the
> facts of the particular case.
>
> _
>
> Illustrations
>
> _
>
> The Court may presume -
>
> (g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be
> unfavourable to the person who withholds it.

90\. CWI contended that as Mr Lee played an important role in SDs dealings
with Mr Shu, he should have been called as a witness. SD pointed out that by
the time CWI instituted the present action, Mr Lee was no longer their
employee and that he was very reluctant to give evidence. SD explained that Mr
Lees assistance was not required to prove their case because they had other
witnesses who could prove that their problems in Jiangsu were not resolved by
CWI. It was also pointed out that CWI could have subpoenaed Mr Lee if they
thought this to be necessary.

91\. The circumstances under which an adverse inference may be drawn from a
failure to call a witness have been discussed in many cases. In _Chua Keem
Long v PP_[1996] 1 SLR 510, 523-524, Yong Pung How CJ explained:

> In determining whether or not that presumption ought to be drawn, the court
> will have regard to all the circumstances, but particularly and importantly
> the materiality of the witnesses not produced. The adoption of any other
> approach would be to encourage the adducing of unnecessary evidence,
> prolonging the trial and confusing the issues.

92\. In _Yeo Choon Huat v PP_[1998] 1 SLR 217, the Court of Appeal held, in
the context of a criminal case, that the prosecutions failure to call a
witness does not give rise to a presumption under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act
unless it constitutes a withholding of evidence from the court.

93\. In the present case, the available documents and witnesses provided ample
evidence which made it impossible for CWIs claim to succeed. It is pertinent
to note that it is not CWIs case that Mr Lee had altered or had the authority
to alter the terms of the agreement between SD and CWI. Taking all the
circumstances into account, I hold that the fact that Mr Lee was not called as
a witness did not have an adverse effect on SDs case.

**

G. CONCLUSION

**

94\. For the reasons stated above, CWIs claim against SD is dismissed with
costs.
