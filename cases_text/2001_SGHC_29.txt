**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. The plaintiffs and the first four defendants are shareholders in the fifth
defendant company, Guan Soon Development Pte Ltd (the company). The
application before me was for an order that the defendants be restrained at
the intended general meeting of the company scheduled for 31 January 2001 or
at any adjournment of this meeting and/or at any other general meeting from
passing any resolution to receive, consider and/or adopt the Directors Report
and the audited accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 1999 until
further order by the court.

2\. The application was made in an originating summons filed on 18 January
2001 to invoke the powers of the court under s 216 of the Companies Act, Cap
50 (the Act). The interlocutory injunction application was filed four days
later. In the originating summons itself, the plaintiffs seek two reliefs:

> (a) an injunction in similar terms to that asked for by the summons-in-
> chambers; and
>
> (b) an order that the company should be at liberty to declare the sum of
> $86,941,345 as an extraordinary gain in its audited accounts for the
> financial year ended 31 December 1999.

3\. Although the summons-in-chambers was filed on an ex-parte basis, it was
served on the fourth defendant on 26 January and, on 30 January, appearance
was entered on behalf of the first four defendants. The summons was argued
before me on a contested basis and both parties filed affidavits. I dismissed
the application with costs but granted the plaintiffs an _Erinford_ injunction
pending the filing of a notice of appeal and an application for an expedited
appeal.

4\. The question at issue was whether the minority shareholders of the company
would be oppressed, unfairly discriminated against, prejudiced or have their
interests disregarded if the company passed a set of audited accounts which
described the profit made on a sale of land by the company as a trading profit
rather than an extraordinary gain.

**

Background

**

5\. The company was incorporated in 1949 by Mr Teo Cheong Guan for the purpose
of running and operating a fleet of lorries. In 1953, the company purchased
land in Upper Changi Road for its long-term purposes. At that time the land
was zoned agricultural. In 1971, the company changed its business and its name
and became a developer.

6\. The plaintiffs and the first four defendants are all related to each
other. Apart from the second plaintiff, who is the wife of the first
plaintiff, they are all children of Mr Teo Cheong Guan, the first plaintiff
being his only son. They are also shareholders in the company. Collectively,
the plaintiffs own 3,097 shares or 38.7% of the issued share capital of the
company whilst the defendants collectively own 4,889 shares or 61.1% of the
share capital. The board of the company comprises the first plaintiff who is
the chairman and managing director, and the second and fourth defendants.

7\. The land in Upper Changi Road was sold in 1999 by the company for the sum
of $90 million. According to the fourth defendant, this was not the entire
land parcel purchased in 1953\. Thereafter, pieces of this land had been
utilised by Mr Teo for property development and sold off and other portions
had been developed and sold by the company in 1993 at a time when the first
plaintiff was the managing director of the company. Another portion had been
sold in 1995 for some $82 million. The sale in 1999 was of the remaining land
at Upper Changi Road belonging to the company.

**

The dispute

**

8\. The dispute related to the accounting treatment to be given to the profit
realised by the company from the 1999 land sale. That this was a bone of
contention became clear in about September or October 2000 when the fourth
defendant was given draft financial statements of the company for review. By
this time, the company was in default of the Acts requirements in relation to
the holding of the annual general meeting in that it had been advised by its
corporate secretary that the annual general meeting for the year 2000 should
have been held no later than 30 June 2000.

9\. The draft financial statements of the company had been prepared on the
basis that the gain from the land sale was an extraordinary item. The fourth
defendant disputed this view. Her opinion was that the gain should be treated
as a normal trading gain. The first plaintiff, however, took the view that it
should be reflected as an extraordinary gain. The dispute between the parties
delayed the completion of the companys accounts.

10\. On 5 December 2000, the fourth defendant as a director of the company was
given notice by the Registry of Companies and Businesses to file the companys
annual accounts for the year 2000 by 5 February 2001 or face possible
prosecution under the Act.

11\. On 29 December 2000, the company gave notice of an extraordinary general
meeting to be held on 16 January 2001. The agenda of the extraordinary general
meeting was stated as follows:

> To discuss and authorise the Directors of the Company to treat the gain of
> $86,941,345.00 on the sale of the land at Upper Changi Road as an
> extraordinary item.
>

>> Attached to the notice of the meeting was a letter from the first plaintiff
dated 28 December 2000 stating that it was he who had specifically requested
the auditors to treat the land sale gain as an extraordinary item in the
companys draft profit and loss statement. He further stated that the fourth
defendant had insisted that this gain be treated as a normal profit and be
taxed by the Inland Revenue Department which would mean that the company would
have to pay $22,604,749 as tax and each shareholder would stand to lose $2,825
per share. Attached to this letter was a report dated 11 October 2000 from
Messrs Deloitte & Touche. This firm of accountants had been commissioned by
the first plaintiff to give their views as to the proper accounting treatment
for the gain on the land sale.

12\. The extraordinary general meeting took place as scheduled. The result of
the voting on the proposed resolution to authorise the Directors of the
Company to treat the gain of $86,941,345.00 on the sale of the land at Upper
Changi Road as an extraordinary item was as follows:

> For the resolution 3,097 votes
>
> Against the resolution 4,889 vote

The resolution was, therefore, not carried.

13\. The draft financial statements were accordingly amended to reflect the
treatment of the land sale gain as normal profit.

14\. By a notice of annual general meeting dated 16 January 2001, notice was
given of an annual general meeting to be held on 19 January 2001 (with consent
to shorter notice) by the shareholders to approve and adopt the accounts. This
meeting was subsequently adjourned to 31 January 2001. Due to the filing of
the plaintiffs application, the meeting was further adjourned to await the
outcome of the application.

**

The Deloitte & Touche letter

**

15\. The plaintiffs relied heavily on the letter from Deloitte & Touche. The
material parts of this letter read as follows:

> If an item is held for long-term purposes and the disposal takes place in
> the financial year, then such disposal would normally be treated as an EOI
> [extraordinary income]. For tax purposes, such gains would be considered as
> capital gains and not subject to tax. On the other hand, if the item is
> considered as a usual item, i.e. incurred or carried on in the normal course
> of business, then the gains arising therefrom will be considered as normal
> trading gains and subject to the prevailing corporate tax (for Year of
> Assessment 2000) of 26%.
>
> In the case of your Company, the issue is rather complex in that the land
> was acquired more than 30 years _(sic)_ and was designated as agricultural
> land.
>
> The complication arises because of the fact that the Company also carried on
> developmental activities. In such a case, most of the time, the Singapore
> Tax Authorities (STA) will take the position that any unsold property left
> with the Company or any land still held by the Company would be considered
> as trading stock. Therefore on its disposal any gain arising therefrom will
> be considered normal trading gains and subject to corporate tax.
>
> If the Company has other pieces of land owned and these other pieces of land
> were subsequently developed and sold, an argument can still be put forward
> that the agricultural land was held for long- term investment purposes as
> nothing was done to this piece of land and no application was made for a
> change of use and if the contention that this piece of agricultural land was
> held for long-term purposes, then since this piece of land was held for more
> than 30 years, on its disposal, the gains should be considered as capital
> gains and therefore not subject to tax. In this regard, the gains should be
> regarded as EOI for accounting purposes.
>
> A position could be put forward that this piece of land was held for long-
> term purposes as agricultural land. The first step that should be taken is
> to reflect the gains as an EOI and this position be put forward (for tax
> purposes) to treat the gains as capital gains. However, if for accounting
> purposes, the treatment is that the gains arose from a normal trading
> transaction and the gains reflected as normal trading profits, then when
> negotiating with the STA, the Company would have an uphill task trying to
> argue that these gains are in fact capital gains and not normal trading
> gains.

The plaintiffs argument

**

16\. The plaintiffs accepted that by seeking relief under s 216 of the Act,
they had to prove one of the four grounds set out in the Act ie that there had
been oppression, disregard of interests, unfair discrimination or prejudice.
Their position was that the facts of this case established that their
interests as shareholders had been disregarded and/or prejudiced.

17\. The submission was that the defendants insistence on reflecting the lands
sale gain as a normal trading profit in the audited accounts and thereby
rendering the gain subject to corporate tax without giving a chance for the
company to submit to the income tax authorities that the gain should be
treated as extraordinary income was an act which was done without regard to
the plaintiffs interests and/or was prejudicial to them. This was because once
the gain had been reflected as a normal trading profit in the audited accounts
and those accounts had been adopted at the annual general meeting, the company
would have no ground whatsoever to make any submission that no tax should be
payable on the gain.

18\. Citing the dictum of LP Thean JA in _Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd. v Zenecon Pte
Ltd_[1995] 2 SLR 297 to the effect that the court is entitled to question the
soundness of commercial decisions when the same make absolutely no commercial
sense on any objective basis, the plaintiffs submitted that the defendants
decision to treat the land sale gain as a normal trading profit made no
commercial sense on an objective basis. They submitted that such a course of
action was devoid of logic and went against the legitimate expectation of a
right thinking shareholder. The plaintiffs said they had a legitimate
expectation that the majority shareholders would act prudently in the
treatment of the land sale gain and not in a manner that would lead the
company to pay substantial taxes without any recourse.

19\. The plaintiffs recognised that the first to the fourth defendants would
themselves suffer loss in the form of reduced dividends by reason of the
categorisation of the gain as a normal profit. They submitted that this
suffering did not detract from the fact that their conduct was unfair or
oppressive or in total disregard to the plaintiffs interests. In this respect
they relied on _Re Sam Weller & Sons Ltd _[1990] 1 Ch 682.

20\. Finally, the plaintiffs reiterated that they would be prejudiced by the
defendants action which would result in the company having to pay some $22
million in tax which would in turn affect the amount of dividend to be paid to
the plaintiffs. The prejudice was that once the land sale gain was officially
adopted as a normal trading profit, there would be no turning back as far as
tax was concerned and the company would face an uphill task in trying to
convince the tax authorities that the gain should be considered an
extraordinary gain.

**

The decision

**

21\. Although there are four alternative grounds for establishing a case under
s 216 of the Act, as counsel for the defendants submitted, the common thread
that runs through them is that there must be some element of unfairness in
relation to the treatment of the minority shareholder that must be established
in order to obtain relief from the court. The present case did not, in my
opinion, disclose any element of unfairness in the way that the plaintiffs
were being treated or in the loss that they would sustain if the course
adopted was that proposed by the defendants.

22\. The dispute was over the manner in which the company should be run. An
extraordinary general meeting was held to discuss this. The majority disagreed
with the course proposed by the first plaintiff and therefore voted against
the resolution that he had prepared. The first plaintiff not being satisfied
with this, wants to impose his wishes on the company and cause it to take the
course he thinks is best. It is established that the court does not interfere
with management decisions or second-guess them. That is a matter for the
company. It is only where those management decisions have no commercial basis
and/or would unfairly prejudice minority shareholders that the court may
become involved.

23\. In the present case, the evidence was that the course that the defendants
wished to adopt was a rational one that had been adopted previously by the
company. Although the land in question had been bought many years previously,
parts of it had been developed and/or sold for development over the years and
the profits gained from these transactions had been declared as normal trading
profits. Such declarations were in line with the companys main business since
1971 ie that of development. These earlier gains had not been insubstantial.
In 1993, the company had earned in excess of $16 million on the sale of land
and in 1995, it had earned a profit of almost $83 million from a similar
transaction. Both these profits had been classified as normal trading profits
and the first plaintiff had, as managing director, signed the audited accounts
containing this classification. The first plaintiffs response to that
disclosure was that previously the company had not had tax consultants and had
not realised that it could claim such income as extraordinary gains. I found
that to be an inadequate response in view of the amounts involved and the easy
availability of tax advice in modern Singapore. More likely, no issue was then
perceived to arise since the company was a fairly active developer.

24\. The fourth defendant had written various letters to the first plaintiff
explaining why she considered that the proper categorisation of the gain was
as a normal trading profit. She had pointed out that his actions in attempting
to treat the gain as an extraordinary item were delaying the filing of the
companys audited accounts. Further, if the gain was to be treated as
extraordinary income, it could not be distributed to the shareholders as
dividends. It would have to be kept in a separate account. The first
plaintiffs reply was that there was some other form of capital return whereby
the gain could be distributed to the shareholders. He did not, however, give
details of how such a scheme could be effected. There was no question of
effecting a return of capital by a reduction of paid-up capital since the
companys paid-up capital is only $800,000. If the profits cannot be returned
as dividend, then it would seem the only way to distribute them to the
shareholders would be by winding up the company.

25\. The defendants had rational grounds for their desire to treat the gains
as normal profits. They were following established precedent. They were also
considering the needs and interests of the shareholders by taking a course
that would definitely allow them to distribute such profits, after payment of
tax, to the shareholders as dividends. They were also not willing to put
forward to the tax authorities a stand on the profits that they considered
could not be justified in the light of the previous history of the company and
its activities. Their stand could not, in my view, be impugned as making no
commercial sense whatsoever.

26\. I also noted that Deloitte & Touche had not by any means advised the
first plaintiff that the company had a good chance of persuading the tax
authorities that the gain on the 1999 sale should be treated any differently
from the gains from the 1993 and 1995 sales. They had noted that the companys
case was a complicated one since it had also carried on developmental
activities and the Singapore tax authorities would therefore take the position
that any land still held by the company would be considered as trading stock.
Thus, gain arising from disposal of this stock would be considered normal
trading gains and subject to tax. Whilst Deloitte & Touche did suggest that
the position could be put forward that the piece of land was held for long-
term purposes as agricultural land, they did not give any estimate of the
chances of such a position being accepted by the tax authorities. They were
simply concerned to see that the company did not make its negotiations with
the tax authorities more difficult by categorising the gains as trading
profits. What they were doing was suggesting a course of negotiations with the
tax authorities not advising on a clear cut situation.

27\. The first plaintiff himself changed his position in relation to the
meaning of the Deloitte & Touche letter. In the first affidavit which he filed
in these proceedings, he asserted in para 7 that Deloitte & Touche had advised
him that the company _should treat_ the gain from the sale of the land as a
capital gain and _should reflect_ such gain extraordinary income so that it
would not be subject to corporate tax. In his second affidavit, he said at
para 8 that the advice was that it would be _prudent_ for the company to first
treat the gain as an extraordinary item and to reflect it as such in the
audited accounts. It is clear that the directors may differ from Deloitte &
Touche in their assessment of what would be a prudent course on the part of
the company and that their decision in this respect would have been assisted
by their knowledge of the companys activities. Deloitte & Touche would not
have such wide knowledge of what had been done previously. Their advice would
be based only on what they had been told. The defendants in adopting a
different course from that advocated by Deloitte & Touche were not per se
acting unreasonably or illogically especially as the advice had not been
categorical but was more in the nature of a suggestion.

28\. I also noted that there was no evidence of any bad faith or
vindictiveness on the part of the defendants. They did not have any collateral
purpose or murky motive in adopting the course that they proposed. The first
to fourth defendants will suffer the same detriment as the plaintiffs if the
gain is treated as normal profit. There was nothing in the affidavit that
suggested that they were prepared to suffer this detriment because they had an
ulterior motive or would be deriving some benefit that was not available to
the plaintiffs. Nor was there any evidence that they were acting in disregard
of any of the shareholders interests. The first plaintiff did not accuse the
defendants of mala fides. His stand was that they were not acting reasonably.
The evidence, however, did not support the allegation of irrationality.

29\. If the gain from the land sale is not subject to tax, the company will
save some $22 million and the first plaintiff himself will gain an extra $6
million if the gain is distributed as dividends. Whilst I could understand
that the plaintiffs were loath to give up the extra money they could gain if
there is no corporate tax, I could not find in this case any reason to hold
that they had been oppressed, unfairly discriminated against, unfairly
prejudiced or that their interests had been disregarded by reason of the
decision of the majority to treat the gain as normal profit. That was a
decision they were entitled to make based on the companys business and
previous dealings.
