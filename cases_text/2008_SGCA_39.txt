**V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the court):**

**Introduction**

1 Admiral Vasiliy Mikhaylovich Golovnin[note: 1] was an 19th century Russian
navigator and explorer. In 1819, while attempting to survey one of the Kuril
Islands, sandwiched between Russia and Japan, he was apprehended by the
Japanese. As the Kuril Islands were then the subject of rival sovereignty
claims by both countries, Admiral Golovnin was promptly accused by the
Japanese of having strayed too close to the island. He spent the next two
years languishing in a Japanese prison as there were then no established
international conventions on how to deal with such transgressions.

2 Almost 200 years later, a vessel named after him, the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ ,
owned by the respondent, has been caught in the middle of an international
legal melee, spanning several jurisdictions. As a result of an alleged
contractual default by its sister ship, it was arrested in Singapore.
Fortunately, in accordance with established Singapore shipping practice, it
was promptly released after security was provided. The issues in these
appeals, while having little apparent historical or political significance,
are nevertheless of considerable commercial importance to the parties
involved. Is the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ an innocent party in the middle caught up
in a legal muddle or do its owners have legal responsibility for failing to
comply with the instructions of the appellant (_qua_ consignee)? For ease of
reference and to facilitate understanding, we now set out the schematic
arrangement of this judgment:

**Overview**

3 Crédit Agricole (Suisse) SA (“Crédit Agricole”), the appellant in Civil
Appeal No 109 of 2007 (“CA 109/2007”), and Banque Cantonale de Genève SA
(“BCG”) (collectively “the Banks”) arrested a vessel, the _Chelyabinsk_ , in
Lomé, the capital of Togo, on 21 February 2006. Acceding to a setting-aside
application by Far Eastern Shipping Co Plc (“FESCO”), the Lomé Court of First
Instance ordered that the vessel be released on 24 February 2006. Dissatisfied
with this outcome, the Banks, not long after, moved to arrest her sister ship,
the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ , in Singapore on 18 March 2006, pursuant to the High
Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed) (“HCAJA”), on the
same basis as the arrest of the _Chelyabinsk_.

4 On 10 July 2006, FESCO, the respondent in CA 109/2007, the owners of the two
vessels, persuaded Assistant Registrar Ang Ching Pin (“AR Ang”), to set aside
the warrant of arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ and strike out the Banks’ writ
of summons. AR Ang, however, did not award FESCO any damages arising from the
wrongful arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_.

5 The Banks appealed against AR Ang’s decision (_The Vasiliy Golovnin_ [2006]
SGHC 247) (“AR Ang’s GD”) to set aside the arrest warrant in Registrar’s
Appeal No 214 of 2006 (“RA No 214”) to a High Court judge (“the Judge”). FESCO
also concurrently appealed against AR Ang’s decision not to award damages for
wrongful arrest in Registrar’s Appeal No 216 of 2006 (“RA No 216”). The Banks’
appeals were on the whole unsuccessful. On 31 July 2007, the Judge upheld the
decision of AR Ang in striking out the appellants’ claims against the
respondent, save for that part of the claim relating to damage to the cargo
which he ruled could still be pursued _in personam_. This was notwithstanding
his finding that the action _in rem_ was wrongly instituted. The Judge also
dismissed FESCO’s appeal for damages. FESCO was awarded 70% of the costs in RA
No 214 and the Banks were awarded costs in respect of FESCO’s unsuccessful
appeal in RA No 216 (see _The Vasiliy Golovnin_ [2007] 4 SLR 277).

**The appeals**

6 CA 109/2007 is an appeal by Crédit Agricole against the High Court’s
decision. The appeal concerns the decision to set aside the warrant of arrest
and strike out the writ _in rem_. However, it bears mention that BCG, the
other bank responsible for the arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ , has not
pursued the matter any further.

7 Civil Appeal No 110 of 2007 (“CA 110/2007”) is an appeal by FESCO against
the High Court’s decision declining to award it damages arising from the
wrongful arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_. The Banks are the respondents in
this appeal.

8 In this judgment, we shall address CA 109/2007 before dealing with CA
110/2007. We first briefly set out the undisputed facts and then condense the
Judge’s grounds of decision (“the Judge’s GD”).

**Background facts**

9 The Judge has ably summarised the salient facts and we gratefully adopt
substantial portions of the factual matrix set out in the Judge’s GD. The
unfortunate saga began somewhat uneventfully around September 2005. On 9
September 2005, FESCO chartered the _Chelyabinsk_ (“the chartered vessel”) on
amended New York Produce Exchange (“NYPE”) terms (“the head charterparty”) to
Sea Transport Contractors Ltd (“STC”). STC, in turn, sub-chartered the
chartered vessel, also on amended NYPE terms, to Rustal SA (“Rustal”). The
Banks provided financing to Rustal and received the relevant bills of lading
as security.

10 In accordance with the terms of the head charterparty, STC instructed the
chartered vessel to load a cargo of about 5,100mt of Chinese rice at Nanjing
for discharge at “any African port”. Three bills of lading were issued. All of
these bills referred exclusively to the head charterparty dated 9 September
2005 and stated the port of discharge as “any African port”.[note: 2] Of these
three bills of lading, only one of them (“the African port bill of lading”) is
in issue in these proceedings. The holder of the other two bills of lading
declined to institute proceedings against FESCO in Singapore, despite the fact
that the holder was also a party to the proceedings in Lomé, Togo.

11 Immediately after loading the Chinese rice, the chartered vessel then
proceeded to Kakinada, India, where it loaded about 15,000mt of Indian rice.
Five new bills of lading (KKD/LT/01, KKD/LT/02, KKD/LT/03, KKD/LT/04,
KKD/LT/05) all dated 10 September 2005 were issued in respect of the Indian
rice. The port of discharge was stipulated in each and every one of them to be
Lomé, Togo. Of these five bills, three bills (KKD/LT/01, KKD/LT/02, KKD/LT/03)
are held by Crédit Agricole, the appellant in CA 109/2007. The other two bills
(KKD/LT/04, KKD/LT/05) are held by BCG. The cargo covered by bills numbered
KKD/LT/03 and KKD/LT/05 was eventually discharged in Abidjan, a port in Côte
d’Ivoire, after letters of indemnity were provided. No claims arise in
relation to these bills for the purposes of this appeal. Also, as BCG is not a
party to this appeal, there is no issue in relation to KKD/LT/04. Only two of
the new bills of lading (KKD/LT/01, KKD/LT/02), hereinafter referred to as
“the Lomé bills of lading”, and the African port bill of lading (see [10]
above) are relevant for the purposes of the present appeal.

12 After a request by Rustal, STC instructed the chartered vessel to proceed
to Abidjan. In Abidjan, part of the Indian rice (under KKD/LT/03 and
KKD/LT/05, see [11] above) was discharged in exchange for letters of indemnity
issued by STC. Presumably, the letters of indemnity were given because the
bills of lading had named Lomé as the port of discharge. In early December
2005, Rustal also requested STC to effect a switch of the Lomé bills of lading
in order to, _inter alia_ , reflect a change of the port of discharge from
Lomé to Douala in Cameroon. STC initially agreed to this. On receiving a
request from STC, FESCO immediately agreed to do so provided that the original
bills of lading were simultaneously surrendered in exchange for the new bills
of lading. The agreed switch of documents was scheduled to take place on 12
December 2005 at the office of FESCO’s chartering brokers in Surrey, England.
However, neither Rustal’s staff nor its agents turned up at the appointed time
to effect the switch. While there is some disagreement between the parties as
to the reason for the breakdown of this arrangement, nothing really turns on
this. What is now significant is that the Lomé bills of lading have never been
switched.

13 Even though STC had initially instructed the chartered vessel to sail to
Douala on 13 December 2005, immediately after the breakdown in effecting the
switch occurred, it revoked its earlier directions to discharge the cargo at
that port. On 14 December 2005, STC informed FESCO in no uncertain terms not
to switch the Lomé bills of lading unless further instructions were given. On
15 December 2005, STC reiterated its earlier instructions and reminded FESCO
that the chartered vessel should not enter the port of Douala or berth there
without STC’s prior instructions. It has now emerged that STC was then
embroiled in an intractable dispute with Rustal about unpaid hire for the
chartered vessel.

14 On 19 December 2005, STC sent an e-mail to FESCO instructing the chartered
vessel to sail for Lomé and to discharge the cargo in accordance with the
express mandate contained in the subject bills of lading. However, soon after
this, on 21 December 2005, FESCO received a conflicting request from M/s
Waterson Hicks, the solicitors of BCG, insisting that the discharge of the
cargo of rice be effected at Douala in exchange for a letter of indemnity
covering the proposed change of the port of discharge. FESCO promptly
responded, asserting that in the light of STC’s express instructions and the
fact that BCG’s cargo (KKD/LT/04) named Lomé as the port of discharge, it
could not accede to BCG’s request. Despite FESCO’s refusal to accede to BCG’s
request, the latter’s solicitors persisted in seeking confirmation that the
cargo would be discharged in Douala in accordance with their clients’
instructions. FESCO then replied to BCG’s solicitors reiterating, first, that
while it had carefully considered BCG’s requests, it was unable to discharge
the cargo at Douala because it had already received firm instructions from STC
to sail to Lomé and, second, it could only change the port of discharge after
receipt of STC’s approval. There was also a similar request from Crédit
Agricole to discharge its cargo under the Lomé bills of lading and the African
port bill of lading (collectively, “the relevant bills of lading in the
present appeal”) at Douala instead of Lomé. It should be noted in passing that
there is also some disagreement as to when that request was received by FESCO.
Crédit Agricole claimed that its request was sent by fax on 16 December 2005,
but FESCO maintained that it only received the fax on 29 December 2005,
through its English solicitors, who in turn had received it from Crédit
Agricole’s English solicitors. Nothing of real moment, however, turns on this.
In any event, by 16 December 2005, FESCO had already irrevocably decided not
to discharge the cargo in Douala.

15 The parties had thus reached a stalemate. Who was to cut the Gordian knot
and take delivery of the cargo at Lomé? To resolve this stalemate, on 22
December 2005, STC obtained from the Lomé Court of First Instance an order for
the detention, after discharge, of 15,541mt of rice on board the chartered
vessel (“the STC Court Order”). Pursuant to this order, the cargo was to be
detained in Lomé as security for STC’s claim against Rustal for unpaid hire
under the sub-charterparty between STC and Rustal. As soon as the chartered
vessel arrived at Lomé on 23 December 2005, the STC Court Order was served on
her.

16 __ This unsurprisingly set in motion a legal chain reaction and resulted in
a flurry of further court orders. On 24 December 2005, Rustal obtained an
order from the Lomé court (“Ruling No 2081/2005”) preventing the discharge of
the cargo. On 27 December 2005, STC responded by obtaining a contrary court
order authorising the discharge of the cargo (“the Discharge Order”). Matters
did not rest here.

17 The Banks then decided to enter into the legal fray to protect their
security. They applied to have the Discharge Order set aside and for the
reinstatement of Ruling No 2081/2005 (“the Banks’ application against STC”).
On 16 January 2006, the Lomé court rejected the Banks’ application against
STC, set aside Ruling No 2081/2005, and ordered the cargo be discharged in
Lomé (“Ruling No 0023/2006”). The court also determined that STC was entitled
to retain the cargo as security. The Banks and Rustal then promptly applied
for and obtained separate rulings for a temporary stay of execution of this
ruling.

18 On 2 February 2006, the Lomé Court of Appeal directed that the stay of
execution made in relation to Ruling No 0023/2006 be lifted. This enabled the
cargo to be immediately discharged in Lomé. Soon after this, FESCO commenced
discharging operations. The discharge of the cargo was completed in mid-
February 2006. This unfortunately did not resolve the problems. Upon the
unloading of the cargo pursuant to the discharge order, STC alleged that part
of the cargo had been damaged. Security for this particular claim by STC was
provided by the chartered vessel’s protection and indemnity (“P&I”) club, the
UK P&I Club, by way of a letter of undertaking dated 16 February 2006.
Undeterred by what had transpired, soon after the unloading of the cargo on 18
February 2006, the Banks secured a court order in Lomé for the arrest of the
chartered vessel on 21 February 2006 in connection with their claims for the
damage to the cargo, as well as FESCO’s refusal to effect discharge at Douala.
This, however, was only a momentary respite for the Banks.

19 On 24 February 2006, FESCO decisively countered the arrest and succeeded,
on the same day, in obtaining an order setting aside the arrest of the
chartered vessel (“the Lomé Release Order”). It bears mention that these
proceedings were vigorously contested and heard _inter partes_. Comprehensive
oral and written submissions were made by counsel for the Banks and FESCO. In
arriving at its decision to make the Lomé Release Order, the court made the
following findings:[note: 3]

(a) The Banks must have known that STC, as charterers, had control over the
commercial management of the chartered vessel and that FESCO was bound to
follow the instructions of STC.

(b) FESCO was not at fault for routing the chartered vessel to the port of
Lomé on the instructions of STC, the charterers.

(c) The Banks’ claim that cargo was destined for Douala was rejected on the
basis that the port of Douala was not a port named in the relevant bills of
lading in the present appeal.

(d) The cargo was discharged at Lomé in fulfilment of orders issued by the
Lomé court.

(e) Sufficient security was already provided for the alleged damage claim.

(f) Accordingly, the Banks had no right to arrest the chartered vessel as
security for their alleged claims.

Further, it is also crucial to point out, at this juncture, that the Banks did
not appeal against the Lomé Release Order to the Lomé Court of Appeal. The
chartered vessel, after this, uneventfully left Lomé on 25 February 2006. The
time allowed for an appeal against the Lomé Release Order expired on 17 March
2006. The legal wrangling did not end here. The dispute between the Banks and
STC/FESCO then unexpectedly moved to a new forum, Singapore.

20 On 18 March 2006, the very next day after the expiry of the appeal period,
the Banks successfully applied _ex parte_ to the duty registrar, Assistant
Registrar David Lee (“AR Lee”) to arrest a sister vessel on the basis of the
very same claims earlier made unsuccessfully to the court in Lomé. The
_Vasiliy Golovnin_ , a sister vessel of the chartered vessel, was then
arrested in Singapore.

21 Meanwhile, the Banks were also busy concurrently pressing ahead with their
claim against STC in relation to the discharge of the cargo directly to them.
It bears mention that, on 28 March 2006, the Lomé Court of Appeal reversed
Ruling No 0023/2006 and allowed the Banks’ appeal against the original order
(_ie_ , the Discharge Order) that the cargo be discharged in Lomé. This,
however, has no direct nexus with the Lomé Release Order. When the cargo was
discharged in Lomé, FESCO was then legally obliged to do so. As stated
earlier, on 10 July 2006, following an application by FESCO, AR Ang set aside
the _ex parte_ order for the arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ and
simultaneously struck out the Banks’ writ against FESCO. She determined that:

(a) it was an abuse of process for the Banks to arrest one of FESCO’s vessels
again, as an issue estoppel had arisen by reason of the earlier decision of
the Togolese court (AR Ang’s GD at [20]);

(b) the Banks’ claims were unmeritorious as the Banks had no arguable claim
for breach of contract against FESCO apropos the relevant bills of lading in
the present appeal (AR Ang’s GD at [32]); and

(c) the Banks had failed to disclose material facts to AR Lee (AR Ang’s GD at
[38]).

Nevertheless, she did not award FESCO damages for the wrongful arrest of the
_Vasiliy Golovnin_ (see [4] above), as she felt that the Banks had honestly
believed they had valid claims against FESCO (at [45] and [46] of AR Ang’s
GD)_._

**The decision of the Judge**

22 The Judge noted at the outset that a warrant of arrest of a vessel was a
drastic remedy entailing full and frank disclosure of all material facts.
Since the Banks had clearly failed to disclose three material facts at the _ex
parte_ hearing, the warrant of arrest ought to be set aside (at [22] and [35]
of the Judge’s GD).

23 The Judge also observed that, merely because a vessel had been previously
released from arrest in a different jurisdiction, a fresh arrest did not
constitute an abuse of process unless the vessel was arrested on grounds
covered by an issue estoppel. For issue estoppel to arise: (a) the
jurisdiction of that other court had to be competent, its judgment final and
conclusive and on the merits of the case; (b) the parties to that action had
to be the same as those in the present action; and (c) the issue before the
present court had to be identical to the issue considered in that other court.
As all three requirements for issue estoppel had been satisfied in the
prevailing circumstances, the Banks had no right to arrest the _Vasiliy
Golovnin_ (at [36]–[38] and [51] of the Judge’s GD).

24 A court, the Judge added, would not exercise its discretion to strike out a
writ or pleading under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
Ed) or under its inherent jurisdiction unless the case was plainly unarguable.
All of the Banks’ claims, other than that relating to damage to the cargo,
ought to be struck out as they failed to satisfy the threshold of being
“arguable”. As FESCO had performed the terms of the contract of carriage as
evidenced by the relevant bills of lading in the present appeal, it “cannot be
faulted for carrying the cargo to Lome” (at [59] of the Judge’s GD). The claim
for damage to the cargo, while arguably sustainable, was not, however, in
itself a ground for arresting the ship, as sufficient security had earlier
been provided for that claim by the letter of undertaking provided by the UK
P&I Club (at [50], [70] and [72] of the Judge’s GD).

25 Nevertheless, as it appeared that the Banks had honestly believed that they
had valid claims against FESCO, they should not be required to pay damages for
wrongful arrest (at [73], [75] and [76] of the Judge’s GD).

**CA 109/2007**

26 In CA 109/2007, there are three main issues for our consideration:

(a) first, the _sustainability of the cause of action_ : whether Crédit
Agricole has an arguable case or whether its claims are wholly unmeritorious
and/or clearly unsustainable;

(b) second, _material non-disclosure_ : whether Crédit Agricole discharged its
obligation to make full and frank disclosure of material facts in its _ex
parte_ application for a warrant of arrest; and

(c) third, _issue estoppel_ : whether Crédit Agricole is estopped from
arresting another of FESCO’s vessels in respect of the same claims raised and
determined in the prior proceedings that took place in Lomé.

27 The first and third issues are crucial in the determination of whether the
writ _in rem_ ought to be struck out, whilst all three issues are relevant in
the assessment of whether the warrant of arrest alone should be set aside.

**_Sustainability of the cause of action_**

28 During the hearing of CA 109/2007, we queried counsel for Crédit Agricole,
Ms Vivian Ang (“Ms Ang”), about Crédit Agricole’s objective in pursuing the
appeal, given that the ship had already been released, and security had
already been provided through the UK P&I Club’s letter of undertaking. In
response, Ms Ang informed us that the appeal continued to be relevant as the
parties had initiated arbitration proceedings to resolve the claim in London
in accordance with an arbitration clause contained in one of the
charterparties. She contended that the High Court’s decision affirming the
striking out of the claim might preclude further claims by Crédit Agricole in
the arbitration proceedings. This contention does not pass muster upon closer
scrutiny, particularly because BCG has apparently not taken the same view
since it has not joined Crédit Agricole in this appeal. BCG’s reasons for not
appealing are unclear. However, this much can be quite readily inferred, BCG’s
failure to appeal certainly does not lend any support to Crédit Agricole’s
present stance because BCG is apparently also a party to the arbitration.

29 In its written submissions on the sustainability of the cause of action,
Crédit Agricole contended that the High Court, in striking out the claim _in
limine_ , had seriously erred by considering the strengths and weaknesses of
the conflicting claims when the parties had already agreed that the underlying
disputes between the parties be referred to a three-man arbitration tribunal.
Crédit Agricole further submitted that, pursuant to s 6 of the International
Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), which it argued would apply
to this case, the action in Singapore was subject to a mandatory stay and
court proceedings in support of arbitration should not attempt to determine
the merits of the matter. Crédit Agricole added, for good measure, that the
court should strictly limit itself to deciding whether the plaintiff “could
arrest or not arrest” and abstain from determining the merits, as such a
determination could preclude the Banks from pursuing their claims in the
arbitration proceedings either on the basis of issue estoppel or _res
judicata._[note: 4]

30 We note, however, that nowhere in the indorsement of the claim, and in its
written submissions before AR Lee, did Crédit Agricole even hint that these
proceedings were initiated to support the arbitral process or that the arrest
was actually being made pursuant to s 7 of the IAA, which permits the court to
order the provision or retention of security to satisfy an arbitration award
as a condition to the stay of an action _in rem_. In fact, nowhere in Crédit
Agricole’s written submissions to us is there any reference whatsoever to s 7
of the IAA. There was, however, some indication that arbitration _might_ be
pursued. Nevertheless, when the Banks took out the arrest application, it was
not clearly stated that the arrest was being taken out in support of intended
arbitration proceedings. Mr Kenny Yap, who appeared before AR Lee in the
arrest proceedings, rather cryptically indicated to AR Lee that the Banks were
“reserving their rights” under the IAA.[note: 5] Ironically, in the affidavit
supporting the arrest application, the Banks acknowledged that while they
might have a right to arbitration under the various charterparties, they _did
not know_ which charterparty conferred them this right. As we will see later,
the Banks, even now, remain far from clear about which charterparty confers
the right to arbitration. It must be said, however, that this omission to
state categorically that the arrest was initiated in support of arbitration
proceedings does create real doubt about the cogency of the stance adopted by
Crédit Agricole in this appeal. It appears to us that this particular
contention is very much an afterthought, not having been actively pursued
either before AR Ang or the Judge. For completeness, nevertheless, we now
examine the genesis of the alleged arbitration agreement since it appears to
be one of Crédit Agricole’s principal planks in this appeal.

_The so-called arbitration agreement_

31 In a letter from M/s Allen & Gledhill (Crédit Agricole’s solicitors in
Singapore) to M/s Rajah & Tann (FESCO’s solicitors in Singapore) dated 13
April 2006, Allen & Gledhill wrote:[note: 6]

_In the event_ your clients’ said application [for the warrant of arrest to be
set aside] _is dismissed_ , we would be grateful if you could let us know
whether your clients will consent to the action herein being stayed in favour
of London arbitration and that the London Arbitration Tribunal shall have
jurisdiction to make an award in respect of the cost [_sic_] of this action.
[emphasis added]

32 On 24 April 2006, Rajah & Tann wrote to Allen & Gledhill seeking
clarification on Crédit Agricole’s position on the reference to arbitration in
London. They also sought particulars of the arbitration clause being relied
on. On 4 May 2006, Allen & Gledhill replied, stating that the head
charterparty, which all the bills of lading referred to, contained an
arbitration clause “which provides for London arbitration”. In that letter,
they also said that FESCO had earlier furnished, in respect of the Singapore
arrest, security by way of a UK P&I Club letter of undertaking payable against
an award of a London arbitration tribunal. The letter of undertaking from the
UK P&I Club stated:[note: 7]

[W]e hereby undertake to pay you on behalf of the Shipowners on demand such
sums as may be adjudged, awarded and/or declared by a London Arbitration
Tribunal (or on appeal therefrom) to be or have been payable by, or as may be
agreed to be or have been recoverable …

33 On 24 May 2006, Rajah & Tann responded to Allen & Gledhill
emphasising:[note: 8]

Our instructions are that the substantive dispute shall be referred to
arbitration in London _in the event that our clients’ application to set aside
the arrest is fully and finally determined against our clients_ (including the
various levels of appeals therefrom).

…

Our clients _do not agree_ that the London Arbitration Tribunal shall have the
jurisdiction to make an award in respect of the cost [_sic_] of this action.
All costs issues arising out of the Singapore proceedings shall be determined
by the Singapore courts.

[emphasis added]

34 This letter was the last reference to arbitration we can find in the
documents placed before us. The dates of the correspondence confirm that this
exchange took place only after FESCO applied to set aside the warrant of
arrest. These letters also plainly evidence that the “agreed” arbitration
proceedings had a rather limited scope. In our opinion, the UK P&I letter’s
reference to “such sums _as may be_ adjudged, awarded and/or declared by a
London Arbitration Tribunal”[note: 9] [emphasis added] cannot in itself be
seen to signify FESCO’s consent to arbitration in London. The UK P&I Club and
FESCO are both different entities. In any event, the letter from Rajah & Tann
stated explicitly that FESCO would not agree to arbitration until its
application to set aside the _ex parte_ arrest was “fully and finally
determined”[note: 10] against their clients _._

35 At the hearing, counsel for both sides, in response to further queries from
the court, clarified that the arbitration proceedings were only at a
preliminary stage, and their clients were still in the process of attempting
to settle the appointment of arbitrators. This is pertinent.

36 In our estimation, Ms Ang’s contention that any decision in Singapore would
prevent or circumscribe the arbitration proceedings is plainly unmeritorious.
First of all, the purported arbitration agreement was relatively nascent and
contingent in nature and, in any event, narrowly limited in its intended
scope. These particular arbitration proceedings could not have been even
contemplated when the application for the warrant of arrest in Singapore was
initiated. It also follows inexorably that the arbitration proceedings were
not even contemplated when the Lomé court proceedings were initiated by the
Banks. Certainly, we cannot find any reference, in the documents made
available to us, to an intended arbitration in those proceedings save for a
reference in the “Request for Arrest of Ship” to the Lomé court dated 21
February 2006 affirming that the arrest of the ship was intended to secure a
claim “in anticipation of the _judicial or arbitration consequences_ of the
Banks’ claims against FESCO with the _competent English courts_ ”[note: 11]
[emphasis added]. This certainly does not evince any commitment to proceed to
arbitration in England or anywhere else. From the parties’ correspondence, it
is also plain to us that the arbitration was not clearly on the horizon even
when FESCO made the application to set aside the warrant of arrest.

37 Second, even if Crédit Agricole knew of and intended to rely on the
arbitration clause contained in one of the charterparties, it failed to
adequately disclose this fact to AR Lee when it made the application to arrest
the ship. Mr Kenny Yap, who appeared on behalf of the Banks before AR Lee,
failed to notify AR Lee (and subsequently AR Ang) that the arrest was being
made in support of arbitration proceedings. It seems to us whether or not the
application was being made to support prospective arbitration would have been
an important factor that AR Lee would certainly have considered and required
further clarification of. He would certainly have needed further information
in deciding whether to issue the warrant of arrest unconditionally or issue it
in conjunction with a stay under s 6 of the IAA.

38 We acknowledge that in admiralty disputes, an arbitration tribunal does not
have _in rem_ jurisdiction to arrest a vessel. A vessel can only be arrested
pursuant to an application in the High Court. The retention of security or
provision of alternative security to satisfy an arbitration award is expressly
provided for in s 7(1) of the IAA. Pursuant to this provision, where a court
stays admiralty proceedings under s 6 of the IAA, it “may, if in those
proceedings property has been arrested or bail or other security has been
given to prevent or obtain release from arrest, order — (_a_) that the
property arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of any award
made on the arbitration; or (_b_) that the stay be conditional on the
provision of equivalent security for the satisfaction of any such award”.

39 Toh Kian Sing SC, _Admiralty Law and Practice_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2007),
incisively observes at pp 559–560:

It is well settled that the presence of a binding arbitration agreement does
not preclude an action in rem from being brought, for parties may decide not
to invoke it or the arbitration agreement may in the circumstances be
inoperative. For the same reason, there is no necessity to disclose in the
affidavit accompanying the application for a warrant of arrest the existence
of such an agreement (although the Malaysian position may well be different).
_The result would be different if arbitration is being actively pursued in
reliance on an_ ad hoc _agreement_. [emphasis added]

He further goes on to emphasise (at fn 37 at p 560):

… Singapore law allows for the arrest of a vessel as security for a potential
arbitration award. If the purpose of an arrest is to obtain such security, it
is submitted that, as a matter of prudence, _such a purpose be disclosed in
the application for a warrant of arrest_. [emphasis added]

40 We agree. Indeed, we would go further. It is _necessary_ for a party who
intends to _rely_ on an arbitration agreement to disclose this to the court in
an _ex parte_ application (on the issue of full and frank disclosure, see
[79]–[110] below). If the arbitration is consensual, the court hearing the
application for warrant of arrest must be alerted to the fact that the
proceedings are being brought only to assist the arbitration proceedings. This
fact must be disclosed so that if the court grants the arrest, it can also
consider whether to stay the arrest or make other appropriate directions
pending the award by the arbitral tribunal pursuant to s 7 of the IAA. Care
has to be also taken by the court not to directly or even indirectly pronounce
on the merits of the matter or trespass onto the jurisdiction of the arbitral
tribunal in any other way. If the validity of the arbitration agreement is or
will likely be disputed, the court’s attention must also be drawn to this
fact. The court’s determination of the application can then be appropriately
calibrated to take these potential developments into consideration.

41 Can parties consent to arbitration after the application to arrest the
vessel has been taken out? There is no reason why they should not be able to
do so. However, once the decision to commence arbitration has been agreed
upon, the parties ought to apply to the court to stay the subject proceedings
without delay. Following this, the parties’ agreement should reflect the
consensus reached so that the authority of the arbitration tribunal to deal
with the claim is not fettered by decisions made in the _in rem_ proceedings.

42 Ms Ang’s contention on the effect that the High Court’s decision would have
on the arbitration proceedings can be best described as an imaginative
argument of convenience. It was not properly developed in her written
submissions and was only fleshed out in response to our queries.

43 We summarise. There was plainly no obvious reliance on the existence of the
arbitration agreement (assuming it then existed) when the arrest order was
made. Neither has any application for a stay pursuant to s 6 of the IAA been
made. We are therefore minded to treat the subject _ex parte_ application as
being no different from any other typical arrest warrant application.

44 We now turn to consider Ms Ang’s contentions on FESCO’s striking out
application – whether Crédit Agricole met the threshold of an “arguable case”
for the purposes of the HCAJA and/or whether its claims were not unmeritorious
nor clearly unsustainable.

_Requirements for determining whether a claim falls within section 3(1) of the
HCAJA_

45 The Banks’ arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ was chiefly predicated on ss
3(1)(_g_) and 3(1)(_h_) of the HCAJA which provide as follows:

**3**. —(1) The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court shall be as follows,
that is to say, jurisdiction to hear and determine any of the following
questions or claims:

…

(_g_) any claim for loss of or damage to goods carried in a ship;

(_h_) any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods
in a ship or to the use or hire of a ship;

46 Crédit Agricole pointed out that, unlike actions _in personam_ , where the
court’s jurisdiction was founded on the presence of the defendant within the
jurisdiction, admiralty jurisdiction _in rem_ was made out whenever one of the
requirements of s 3(1) of the HCAJA was satisfied. The only requirement under
the HCAJA, it said, was to assess whether the subject matter of the claim was
of the type stipulated for under s 3(1). Crédit Agricole further contended
that since the applications to set aside the arrest and to strike out the writ
and the action were all premised on the ground that there had been a failure
to comply with s 3(1) of the HCAJA, a fundamental jurisdictional requirement,
this was the sole threshold issue that the Judge should have considered and
made a definitive finding on. Instead, it argued, the Judge appeared to have
omitted this step and proceeded to address the court’s ability to strike out a
claim under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court or under the inherent jurisdiction
of the court. Ms Ang vigorously submitted that the Judge seriously erred in
this respect and should have first paused to address the issue of whether the
jurisdictional requirements were met, by deciding whether the claim fell
within one of the provisions of s 3(1) of HCAJA.

47 It is trite that the issue of whether or not the jurisdictional
requirements of s 3(1) of the HCAJA are satisfied is a procedural rather than
a substantive one dealing with the merits of the claim. In _The Jarguh Sawit_
[1995] 3 SLR 840, MPH Rubin J noted at 852, [33]:

The question of jurisdiction should not be compounded with the question
whether the plaintiffs will ultimately succeed.

On appeal, M Karthigesu J aptly observed in _The Jarguh Sawit_ [1998] 1 SLR
648 (“ _The_ _Jarguh Sawit (CA)_ ”) at [43]:

In a hearing an of application to _dispute jurisdiction_ , _the plaintiff need
only show that he has a good arguable case that his cause of action falls
within one of the categories of s 3(1)_ , in this case, ground (c). _His
objective is to persuade the court that there is sufficient evidence that a
claim of the type specified in s 3(1)(c) exists_. As the plaintiff in the
present case did so, the court was entitled to find that the plaintiff rightly
invoked its jurisdiction. [emphasis added]

48 Pursuant to O 70 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court, admiralty proceedings in
Singapore ought to be commenced by writ in the prescribed form. While O 70
prescribes certain special procedures for admiralty proceedings, it is now
incontrovertible that the usual procedural remedies for the summary resolution
of such matters continue to be available.

49 Toh Kian Sing SC in _Admiralty Law and Practice_ ([39] _supra_) succinctly
summarises the present position as follows (at pp 45–46):

When the claim is challenged at the jurisdictional stage, the court is not
usually concerned with its merits. The concern at this stage is whether the
nature of the plaintiff’s claim is within a particular head of jurisdiction,
rather than the strength of the claim. _So long as the claim is not frivolous
as to be dismissed in limine, the plaintiff does not have to establish at the
outset that he has a cause of action substantial at law_. Neither would the
existence of a good defence to a claim negate the court’s admiralty
jurisdiction. If the subject matter jurisdiction of the court is challenged,
_the plaintiff under the law of Singapore only has to show that he has a good
arguable case that his claim comes within one of the limbs of section 3(1) of
the [HCAJA], as opposed to the more onerous test of a balance of
probabilities_. The test in England, at least where the jurisdictional
challenge relates to the existence of particular facts, remains that of a
balance of probabilities although there has been strong affirmation for the
test of a ‘good arguable case’ in other jurisdictional contexts. … The
position in Australia is that any such jurisdictional fact must be proved on a
balance of probabilities. [emphasis added]

50 Satisfying the requirements of s 3(1) of the HCAJA cannot be said to be the
end all and be all when assessing the sustainability of an admiralty action.
Invoking the admiralty jurisdiction may be in one sense a procedural step but
it also plainly attracts substantive considerations. There are two
requirements that claimants in every admiralty action must satisfy: first, the
_in rem_ jurisdiction must be established, through, _inter alia_ , ss 3 and 4
of the HCAJA. Second, the claim must, if challenged, also meet the requirement
of being a good arguable case on the merits.

51 The arrest of a vessel is never a trifling matter. Arrest is a very
powerful invasive remedy. An arrest of a ship can lead to tremendous
inconvenience, financial distress and severe commercial embarrassment (see
also [120] below). Even the briefest of delays can sometimes cause significant
losses. It can also in certain instances prejudice the livelihood of the
ship’s crew and the commercial fortunes of the shipowner. Maritime arrests
can, when improperly executed, sometimes be as destructive as Anton Piller
orders and even as potentially ruinous as Mareva injunctions, the two nuclear
weapons of civil litigation. As such, a plaintiff must always remain cautious
and rigorously ascertain the material facts before applying for a warrant of
arrest. While there is no need to establish a conclusive case at the outset,
there is certainly a need to establish _a good arguable case_ , before an
arrest warrant can be issued. This determination plainly requires a
preliminary assessment of the merits of the claim.

52 The standard to be applied in Singapore at this early stage of the matter,
if there is a challenge on the merits, is indeed the “good arguable case”
yardstick (see also Karthigesu J’s observations in _The Jarguh Sawit (CA)_ ,
at [47] above). The plaintiff does not have to establish at this stage that he
has a cause of action that might probably prevail in the final analysis.
Karthigesu J had rightly pointed out in _The Jarguh Sawit (CA)_ that the
plaintiff need only show that he has a “good arguable case” that his cause of
action falls within one of the categories provided for in s 3(1) of the HCAJA.
The party invoking the arrest procedure must be prepared, when challenged, to
justify that it was entitled right from the outset to invoke this remedy.

_Crédit Agricole’s substantive claim_

53 We now examine the substantive claims against FESCO. Crédit Agricole’s
substantive claim is premised on two quite different planks:

(a) the non-delivery of the cargo that was carried on board the chartered
vessel to it, _qua_ lawful holder of the relevant bills of lading in the
present appeal, and as the named consignee; and

(b) the damage suffered by the cargo whilst it was in the care and custody of
FESCO.

As different considerations apply to the two different types of bills of
lading (see [10]–[11] above) we will identify these as well, when necessary.

54 At this juncture, it will be useful to set out the Banks’ indorsement of
claim (set out at [55] of the Judge’s GD):

The Plaintiffs’ claim is for damages for breach of written and/or oral
contracts _evidenced by and/or contained in various Bills of Lading_ dated in
or around September and/or October 2005 and/or a Charterparty and/or for
conversion and/or wrongful detention and/or wrongful interference and/or
breach of bailment and/or breach of duty and/or negligence in and about the
bailment, loading, handling, custody, care delivery and discharge of the
Plaintiffs’ cargo of rice and the carriage thereof on board the ship or vessel
“CHELYABINSK” from Nanjing, China and Kakinanda, India to Douala, Cameroon
during September-December 2005 and/or for a declaration for an indemnity
and/or for an indemnity for all loss and/or liability suffered and/or incurred
and/or injury to the Plaintiffs’ reversionary interests in the said cargo of
which the Plaintiffs are or were owners and/or lawful bills of lading holders
and/or insurers and/or persons in possession and/or entitled to immediate
possession of the said cargo and/or which was at their risk which resulted in
loss and/or damage and/or delay and/or expenses and/or liability being
suffered and/or incurred. [emphasis added by the Judge]

55 This is a fairly turgid indorsement, but one thing is clear. It is common
ground that Crédit Agricole was named as the consignee of the relevant bills
of lading in the present appeal and the bills were duly indorsed to it (see AR
Ang’s GD at [28] and [30]–[32]; and the Judge’s GD at [59]). It is hornbook
law that the terms of a bill of lading are the only terms that govern contract
of carriage between the carrier and the indorsee. This is true whether the
claimant is both the consignee and indorsee or a subsequent indorsee. This
legal position is also why any private antecedent arrangements between the
shipper and the carrier cannot be relied on against a consignee or a
subsequent indorsee of a bill of lading without the consent of all the
relevant parties (see _Leduc & Co v Ward_ (1888) 20 QBD 475 (“ _Leduc v Ward_
”), and also [64]–[66] below). Under the terms of the relevant bills of lading
in the present appeal, FESCO’s only delivery obligation was to deliver goods
at the port of discharge that had been stipulated in these bills of lading. As
the bills of lading in question had not, as had been originally proposed, been
switched, the fact remains that two of the three relevant bills of lading in
the present appeal named Lomé as the port of discharge while the remaining
bill of lading provided for the discharge of the cargo at “any African port”.
In so far as the Lomé bills of lading are concerned, it was FESCO’s contention
that it could not be faulted for delivering the cargo at Lomé as it was
strictly performing its obligations.

56 Crédit Agricole, however, maintained that the _de facto_ port of discharge
on a bill of lading would ultimately have to depend on the _circumstances_ of
each case. This, it contended, necessitated an individualised _interpretation_
of the terms of the bill of lading and the contract of carriage as a whole. In
support of this rather remarkable proposition, Crédit Agricole relied on
_Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd_ [2004] 1 AC 715 where Lord
Hoffmann had generally observed at [76]:

As it is common general knowledge that a bill of lading is addressed to
merchants and bankers as well as lawyers, the meaning which it would be given
by such persons will usually also determine the meaning it would be given by
any other reasonable person, including the court. The reasonable reader would
not think that the bill of lading could have been intended to mean one thing
to the merchant or banker and something different to the lawyer or judge.

57 Primarily on the basis of this rather broad _dictum_ , Crédit Agricole
quixotically argued that the court should bear in mind “circumstances
reasonably available to be known by a merchant or a bank” when interpreting a
bill of lading.[note: 12] While we have no quarrel with this general statement
of principle, it bears mention that it is no more than a general restatement
that a contract should be interpreted objectively (see _Zurich Insurance
(Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd_ [2008] 3
SLR 1029 where this court restated the principles applicable in Singapore for
interpreting contracts). In seeking to create an overlay of the circumstances
reasonably available to just the bank rather than to all the relevant parties,
Crédit Agricole is in fact seeking to import a subjective test unilaterally.
This is, of course, impermissible.

58 In the final analysis, the real issue before this court is whether the bill
of lading, without more, is binding and conclusive as to its terms (FESCO’s
position) or whether it is invariably flexible and open to interpretation
based on surrounding circumstances and business practices (Crédit Agricole’s
position). Crédit Agricole boldly submitted that this was a novel point and
the leading text books had only considered the delivery obligation at the
contractual port of discharge without properly addressing the issue as to
whether delivery can be refused by the shipowners when demanded by cargo
owners at an intermediate port. This issue, Crédit Agricole added, had,
however, been considered in a series of railway cases concerning the carriage
of cargo by rail. It relied on a line of 19th century cases, namely, _Scothorn
v The South Staffordshire Railway Company_ (1853) 8 Exch 341; 155 ER 1378 (“
_Scothorn_ ”) and _The London and North Western Railway Company v Bartlett_
(1861) 7 H & N 400; 158 ER 529 (“ _London & NW Railway_”) for the proposition
that the holder of a bill of lading is entitled _qua_ bailor to possession of
the cargo in transit. We now turn to examine these decisions.

59 In _Scothorn_ , the plaintiff agreed with the defendant for the goods to be
taken from Staffordshire and delivered “to the East India Docks” in London
(from where they were to be transported to Australia). The goods were packed
and labelled “Scothorn & Co, to the East India Docks, passenger-ship
‘Melbourne,’ Australia”. Payment was made for the carriage of the goods to the
East India Docks. The goods were duly despatched from the Great Bridge Station
of the defendant carrier. Before the goods reached the East India Docks, the
plaintiff, who was the consignor, directed the defendant carrier to deliver
the goods to a different place in London – the Bell Wharf, Ratcliffe. This was
not done. Instead, the defendant carrier placed, as originally agreed, the
goods on board the vessel _Melbourne_. The goods were then transported to
Australia and eventually lost in transit. The plaintiff sued for the loss of
the goods and succeeded before the Court of Exchequer.

60 Alderson B held that the issue of what the contract of carriage amounted to
was “no more than a question of fact” (at 344; 1379). In this case, the
contract was “to procure [the defendant’s] agent to deliver according to the
[plaintiff’s] directions”; that since the defendant had not done so and
occasioned a loss to the plaintiff, it was bound to make good that loss (at
345; 1380). Martin B observed (at 346; 1380):

A carrier is employed as bailee of a person’s goods for the purpose of obeying
his directions respecting them, and the owner is entitled to receive them back
at any period of the journey when they can be got at. To say that a carrier is
only bound to deliver goods according to the owner’s first directions, is a
proposition wholly unsupported either by law or common sense.

61 In _London & NW Railway_, the contract of carriage between Mr Bartlett, the
plaintiff, and the defendant railway company was for the delivery of wheat to
the mill of a Mr Badger in Birmingham. Mr Badger instructed the defendant to
retain the wheat in Birmingham Railway Station until he gave written orders
for the wheat to be sent to his mill. Acting on these instructions, the
defendant held on to the wheat for over three months. In the meantime, the
wheat deteriorated and was eventually returned to Mr Bartlett, who then
claimed damages against the defendant for the losses thereby incurred. On
appeal to the Court of Exchequer, the question was whether the consignee (Mr
Badger) was entitled to give the instructions he did. The court held that,
under the contract of carriage, the consignee had the power to order delivery
to him at any place _en route_ to the final destination. Bramwell B wryly
noted at 408; 532:

It would probably create a smile anywhere but in a Court of law, if it were
said that a carrier could not deliver to the consignee at any place except
that specified by the consignor. The goods are intended to reach the
consignee, and provided he receives them it is immaterial at what place they
are delivered. The contract is to deliver the goods to the consignee at the
place named by the consignor unless the consignee directs them to be delivered
at a different place.

As such, the plaintiff had no case against the defendant as the delivery of
the wheat to Birmingham Railway Station instead of to the mill was on the
consignee’s instructions.

62 Relying on these authorities, Crédit Agricole contended that the consignee
was legally entitled to demand delivery while the goods were in transit at a
place _en route_ to the final destination. It added that it was settled law
that courts would normally recognise the property rights of a consignee so
long as they did not conflict with the carrier’s rights.

63 We are of the view that Crédit Agricole’s reliance on these authorities is
entirely misplaced. It appears to us that the legal attributes of bills of
lading have historically evolved very differently, and for good reason, we may
add. The essential characteristics of a carriage of goods by sea and by rail
are quite different.

64 It is settled law that as between the carrier and indorsee of a bill of
lading, the terms of the bill of lading are conclusive evidence of the
contract of carriage; in fact the bill is the contract of carriage, as Lord
Esher MR held in _Leduc v Ward_ ([55] _supra_) at 480–481:

The object of the carriage of the goods from port to port is that they may be
sold or otherwise dealt with at the place of destination; and the person who
wants them at that place for sale or use there acts upon the assumption that
they will arrive there at or about a certain time in the ordinary course of a
voyage there from the port of shipment. If the argument for the defendants
were correct, he could not tell at what time he could calculate on having
them. The indorsee of a bill of lading could not tell when he was likely to
receive the goods. Business could not be carried on upon those terms. Again,
with regard to the insurance of the goods, similar difficulties would arise.
How could the goods be insured, if it was not known [for] what voyage they
were to be insured?

(See also generally Stephen Girvin, _Carriage of Goods by Sea_ (Oxford
University Press, 2007) at paras 7.11–7.12; and Sir Guenter Treitel QC & FMB
Reynolds QC, _Carver on Bills of Lading_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2005) at
paras 3-007–3-008).

65 _Leduc v Ward_ concerned a voyage from Fiume to Dunkirk. The ship deviated
to Glasgow and sank with her cargo. The carrier attempted to rely on an
excepted perils clause which exempted him from liability for perils of the
sea. However, he was not able to rely on this clause if the ship deviated from
the route, as defined by the carriage contract. The carrier claimed that the
shipper knew, before the carriage contract was concluded, that the ship was
intended to sail to Glasgow and, in effect, the deviation was permitted by the
contract. The court held that the pre-contract agreement could not bind the
indorsee, who took on the terms of the bill of lading. These terms did not
permit deviation and, by deviating, the carrier lost the benefit of the
excepted perils clause. Lord Esher MR said (at 480):

[W]here the contract has been reduced into a writing which is intended to
constitute the contract, parol evidence to alter or qualify the effect of such
writing is not admissible, and the writing is the only evidence of the
contract, except where there is some usage so well established and generally
known that it must be taken to be incorporated with the contract.

66 _Leduc v Ward_ remains good authority today. The bill of lading is
conclusive as to its terms between the carrier and indorsee, and general
principles of contract ought to apply in interpreting it. Antecedent
agreements and other surrounding circumstances will not suffice to vary the
terms of a bill of lading, in particular, the port of discharge, unless known
and agreed to by all affected parties.

67 In the present case, FESCO never ruled out the possibility of varying the
contract of carriage. Indeed, FESCO was willing to alter the port of discharge
provided the bills of lading were consensually switched. The switch, however,
was never effected. As a result, the bills of lading were never altered to
effect a change in the port of discharge, _ie_ , the contract was never
varied.

68 It does not appear to us that _Scothorn_ ([58] _supra_) has set out any
general principle of law _. Scothorn_ was a case decided on its peculiar
evidence. That particular contract was for delivery according to the specific
instructions received from the plaintiff. The court also found that the
defendant in _Scothorn_ had in fact agreed to a variation of the contract by
varying the destination of carriage. Crédit Agricole’s reliance on _Scothorn_
and _London & NW Railway_ ([58] _supra_) confuses two related though distinct
processes involved in the carriage of goods: discharge and delivery. Discharge
is the physical operation for the unloading of cargo. The discharge takes
place at the port of discharge, as stated in the bill of lading. FESCO
contends, again rightly, that a bill of lading typically stipulates the port
of discharge, and not the act or point of delivery. The holder of a bill of
lading presents the bill of lading at the warehouse or terminal at the port of
_discharge_ to take _delivery_ of the cargo. While the _discharge_ location is
explicitly mentioned in a bill of lading, railway consignment notes and
transport documents for the transport of cargo by land refer to _delivery_
locations. We also note with keen interest that _Scothorn_ is generally
regarded as an authority of limited application, having particular relevance
mainly to contracts of carriage by land. N E Palmer, _Bailment_ (The Law Book
Company Limited, 2nd Ed, 1991) at p 1011 observes:

Whereas, however, it is clear from _Scothorn_ that if the consignor-consignee
are the same person then he can demand a redelivery to himself _during
transit_ , it is less certain whether he can demand a delivery to himself at
some other destination not on the agreed route as of right (rather than by an
agreed variation of the contract, as was the case in _Scothorn_ itself). The
point seems never to have been directly decided in England, although it seems
to have been thought in _L. & N.W. Ry v. Bartlett_ that a consignee-owner has
such a right. _Perhaps it could be argued that a consignor who was also the
consignee could demand a redelivery to himself at any reasonable place to
which the carrier normally delivers, provided that the person giving the order
is prepared to pay any expense involved_. [emphasis added]

69 Notes of consignment for carriage by rail have a vastly different character
from bills of lading. For example, the _Convention Internationale concernant
le Transport des Marchandises par Chemin de Fer_ (“CIM”) sets conditions for
the international transportation of goods by rail. CIM notes are documents
which confirm that the rail carrier has received the goods and that a contract
of carriage exists between trader and carrier. Unlike a bill of lading, a CIM
note is not a document of title. It does not give its holder rights of
ownership or possession of the goods. One of the key characteristics of a bill
of lading is that it operates as a document of title apart from evidencing a
contract of carriage and confirming that the carrier has received the goods.
The bill of lading is a badge of constructive ownership. Such constructive
ownership can be transferred by endorsement and delivery. It is sometimes
described as a “key” to ownership. The effective transfer of the key will also
transfer property. As the bill of lading serves as a document of title, it
requires certainty, and cannot be freely interpreted on an _ad hoc_ basis
according to the circumstances as Crédit Agricole suggests.

70 We are not persuaded that the approach taken in these railway cases can be
crystallised into a broader principle in relation to bills of lading that
sanctions an _ad hoc_ approach to reinterpret the bills of lading to dovetail
with any change of circumstances. It is instructive that a leading textbook on
carriage by sea, _viz_ , Raoul Colinvaux, _Carver’s Carriage by Sea_ (Stevens
& Sons, 13th Ed, 1982), in footnoting both of these railway cases, has this to
say at vol 2, para 1594:

Where the contract of carriage has been made by the consignor on behalf of the
consignee, the carrier may take his instructions from the latter, and will be
discharged by a delivery in accordance with his directions. And even where the
goods are at the risk of the consignor, and the contract is really with him,
if he has directed that they are to be delivered to the named consignee at a
particular place, and an arrangement is made between the carrier and consignee
that they shall be delivered to him elsewhere, and that is done, the delivery
will discharge the carrier. “ _The obvious meaning of the contract is to
deliver to the consignee at the place mentioned, unless the consignee
chooses,**and** the carrier **is willing** that they shall be delivered
somewhere else_.” [emphasis in italics and bold italics added]

It is axiomatic that Crédit Agricole was itself aware of the need to expressly
provide for alterations in the port of discharge, and that is why it sought to
switch the bills of lading. Crédit Agricole’s submission, that the port of
discharge on a bill of lading should be considered and interpreted according
to circumstances such as the type of trade, the usual practices of the trade
and the carriage agreements for other cargo, is nothing short of a recipe for
uncertainty, shorn of both logic and principle. If we were to accept Crédit
Agricole’s bold, and one might add bald, argument, bills of lading could well
be reduced to the status of mere ambulatory consignment notes. This, to us, is
a wholly unacceptable proposition.

71 FESCO complied with its duty to deliver goods at the port of discharge
which was named in a bill of lading. In so far as the Lomé bills of lading
which named Lomé as the port of discharge are concerned, FESCO cannot be
faulted for carrying the cargo to Lomé as it was discharging its obligations
in accordance with the terms of the said bills of lading. In the event that
the consignee/indorsee instructs the carrier to vary the port of discharge,
general principles of contract will apply, _viz_ , the terms of the bills of
lading must be consensually varied to effect the change in the port of
discharge. We also agree with the observations of Colman J expressed in
relation to the fundamental obligations between the parties to a time charter,
whether on NYPE terms or most other forms, as stated in _The Goodpal_ [2000] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 638 at 643:

(vii) Once the owners have become bound by the contract of carriage entered
into on the terms of the bill of lading the charterers’ entitlement to give
instructions for the disposition of the cargo so loaded is limited by the
terms of the bill of lading. In particular, he cannot change the discharging
port without procuring the assent of all the relevant parties to the bills of
lading contract.

…

(ix) Just as the charterer is not entitled to require the master to proceed to
a discharge port different from that specified in or permitted under the bill
of lading contract, so the receiver under that contract can have no greater
entitlement to redirect the master than the terms of the bill of lading and
charter-party permit. In his capacity as receiver he merely enjoys precisely
that facility of discharge at the designated discharge port which the
charterer himself would enjoy.

72 In relation to the African port bill of lading, Crédit Agricole
additionally argued that FESCO was in breach of its instructions to discharge
at “any African port” cargo at Douala when it was berthed there from 17 to 21
December 2005. Instead, the chartered vessel returned to Lomé where FESCO knew
or ought to have known that the cargo would be seized by STC. FESCO responded,
arguing that it did not receive Crédit Agricole’s fax with those instructions
on 16 December 2005 (see [14] above). Second, FESCO maintained that it was
under no obligation to obey instructions from Crédit Agricole in any event.
FESCO concluded this argument by emphasising that its obligations were to
perform the terms of the contract of carriage as evidenced by the relevant
bills of lading in the present appeal and to obey the lawful instructions of
STC in so far as they were not inconsistent with the said bills of lading.

73 Crédit Agricole’s argument, that it was the context that was all important,
ought to be assessed in its proper perspective. FESCO declined to discharge
the cargo at Douala in the light of Crédit Agricole’s failure to switch the
bills of lading because of the specific instructions it had received from STC.
If FESCO maintained that it would not discharge the cargo at any other port
than the port of discharge contained in the bills of lading, why then did it
discharge some of the cargo at Abidjan? FESCO pointed out, however, that the
cargo was discharged on the basis of letters of indemnity provided against the
breach of the express terms of those bills of lading (see [11] and [12]
above). No such letters of indemnity were offered by the Banks for the
discharge of the cargo in Douala.

74 Crucially, we also note that it was not disputed that the cargo of the
African port bill of lading cargo was actually stowed below the cargo to be
discharged at Lomé. As such, it would be logical that the cargo due for Lomé
be discharged first. It was, additionally, not disputed that when the
chartered vessel reached Lomé, she was required to discharge _all_ her cargo
at that port by virtue of Ruling No 0023/2006, which was an order of court
(see [17] above). In view of this, the reality is that FESCO had no option but
to discharge _all_ her cargo at Lomé, including the cargo shipped under the
African port bill of lading. For this reason, we are of the view that the
discharge of the cargo covered by the African port bill of lading in Lomé did
not result in any breach of contract. Further, in discharging the African port
bill of lading cargo in Lomé, FESCO was in fact complying with a valid court
order to discharge _all_ its cargo.

75 AR Ang and the Judge noted that the Banks did not (and could not) contend
that FESCO could have legitimately refused to comply with Ruling No 0023/2006
requiring it to discharge all the cargo at Lomé. We accept that a refusal by
FESCO to unload all the said cargo at Lomé would have, additionally, amounted
to a contempt of court and Crédit Agricole’s suggestion that FESCO should not
comply because of existing contractual obligations was plainly absurd. All the
interested parties, including the Banks, have consistently accepted that the
Lomé court had the requisite jurisdiction to make Ruling No 0023/2006.

76 In response, Crédit Agricole attempted to assert that FESCO would not have
had to comply with this Lomé order of court if the chartered vessel had
avoided Lomé altogether. It claimed that FESCO well knew that if the chartered
vessel entered Lomé, as it had been expressly warned by the Banks’ solicitors,
the cargo would be seized by STC. Crédit Agricole further submitted that FESCO
knew or must have known that, under the terms of the “freight pre-paid” bills
of lading between FESCO and the Banks, STC had no right whatsoever to arrest
or exercise a lien over the cargo at Lomé and that exercise of such a lien
would be clearly wrongful. Ms Ang vigorously concluded this particular
contention by emphasising that FESCO had, in all the circumstances, a duty to
deviate from Lomé and proceed to another port to discharge the cargo.

77 We are not at all impressed by this argument. There was no duty on FESCO’s
part to deviate from Lomé. To deviate from Lomé would render FESCO liable for
breach of the head charterparty and breach of the contracts of carriage
evidenced by the bills of lading. It could also have compromised the existing
insurance arrangements. It also cannot be controverted that a time charterer
is entitled to give employment instructions to the shipowners. Such
instructions can usually encompass directions as to how the voyage is to be
performed by the vessel. Unless the charterparty provides otherwise, the
master is obliged to obey such instructions subject only to considerations of
seamanship and safety (see Michael Wilford, Terence Coghlin & John D Kimball,
_Time Charters_ (LLP, 5th Ed, 2003) at para 19.25 and _Whistler International
Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd_ [2001] 1 AC 638 at 647). In our view, FESCO
cannot be faulted at all for complying with its contractual obligations.

78 Turning to the issue of loss of and damage to the cargo, even though the
Banks’ claim was still conceptually maintainable, the Judge rightly did not
view this as being sufficient to justify the arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin._
We believe this to be a correct and principled approach. The arrest of a
vessel _in rem_ is purely to secure security for the underpinning claim. On 16
February 2006, the UK P&I Club issued a letter of undertaking to “the Cargo
underwriters” for the sum of €113,411.00, inclusive of interest and cost,
being security for alleged shortage or damage of the cargo during the
discharge in Lomé. As security had already been furnished for the damage and
loss of the cargo, an arrest was certainly not necessary. The Banks could have
quite easily applied to the Lomé court for the security under the letter of
undertaking to be enhanced. They chose not to take what, in our view, was the
most appropriate, and indeed, expedient remedy. Instead, they launched another
altogether unexpected and improbable salvo by initiating proceedings in
Singapore. This was wholly off the mark. Accordingly, for these reasons, we
dismissed Crédit Agricole’s appeal on this issue. In our view, Crédit Agricole
did not have a good arguable case, for the alleged breach of contract arising
from the discharge of the subject cargo in Lomé, and for this reason alone its
claim ought to be struck out. However, though fundamental, this is not the
only grave procedural defect apropos the Banks’ claims in these proceedings.

**_Material non-disclosure_**

79 When the application to set aside the arrest was heard, FESCO contended
that five material facts had not been disclosed by the Banks to AR Lee, who
heard the _ex parte_ application for the arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_.
They are as follows (see the Judge’s GD at [24]):

(a) the chartered vessel had been released from arrest by the Lomé court
following an _inter partes_ hearing (the Lomé Release Order);

(b) Lomé was the contractual port of discharge under three of the four bills
of lading;

(c) the primary purpose of switching the bills of lading in question was to
alter the port of discharge from Lomé to Douala;

(d) BCG had offered a letter of indemnity to FESCO on 21 December 2005 in
consideration of the cargo being discharged at Douala instead of Lomé; and

(e) after failing to persuade FESCO to discharge the cargo at Douala, BCG had
sought FESCO’s confirmation that the cargo would be discharged in Douala in
accordance with BCG’s instructions.

80 AR Ang upheld FESCO’s contentions in relation to the first and fourth
facts, _ie_ , facts (a) and (d). She ruled that there was sufficient
disclosure in relation to the remaining three facts. The Judge found that, in
addition to the first and fourth facts, the Banks had failed to disclose
another material fact, namely that the main purpose of switching the bills of
lading was to change the port of discharge from Lomé to Douala. This relates
to fact (c).

81 As Crédit Agricole is the only appellant in this appeal, it is only
appealing against the first and third material facts; BCG is not appealing
against any of these findings of material non-disclosure and, as such, a
discussion on material fact (d) is not necessary as it relates primarily to
BCG’s non-disclosure. At the hearing, Crédit Agricole made no submissions on
fact (d). This issue is worthy of mention at this juncture because FESCO
submitted that BCG’s decision not to appeal should be taken to mean that it
has accepted the Judge’s holding on material non-disclosure. It suggested that
this now amounted to an admission of non-disclosure on BCG’s part. Therefore,
FESCO argued that, even taking Crédit Agricole’s case at its highest, the
arrest ought to be set aside because of BCG’s non-disclosure at the _ex parte_
hearing. While there is some force in this point of view, we also think it
would only be right to examine the other grounds raised. This will also be
relevant in our ultimate assessment of FESCO’s claim for damages for wrongful
arrest against the Banks.

82 We will examine the issue of material non-disclosure from two aspects:
first, what ought to have been disclosed (_ie_ , content and scope) and
second, whether such facts have been sufficiently disclosed (_ie_ ,
threshold). Before delving into these two aspects of disclosure, it would be
apposite for us, first, to comment briefly on the duty to make full and frank
disclosure in _ex parte_ applications, in general, and for the arrest of ships
in particular.

_Duty to make full and frank disclosure_

83 It is settled law that on an _ex parte_ application, the applicant must
disclose to the court all matters within his knowledge which might be material
even if they are prejudicial to the applicant’s claim (_The King v The General
Commissioners for the Purposes of the Income Tax Acts for the District of
Kensington_ [1917] 1 KB 486 at 504, endorsed by this court in _Tay Long Kee
Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah_ [2000] 2 SLR 750 (“ _Tay Long Kee Impex_ ”) at
[21]; see also Steven Gee QC, _Commercial Injunctions_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 5th
Ed, 2004) at para 9.001). This applies to the arrest of ships in Singapore as
well, though the position is presently quite different in England. It has been
held by the English Court of Appeal that the effect of the 1986 amendments to
the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965 No 1776) (UK) which, _inter alia_ ,
amended O 75 r 5 governing the issuance of warrants of arrest, was that the
affidavit in support of the warrant of arrest need only comply with the
requirements of the English rules (the relevant requirements are presently
found in PD61 to the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK)) and
need not make full and frank disclosure of all material facts (which was the
position in England prior to the amendments (see _The Andria now renamed
Vasso_ [1984] QB 477 at 491–492)), given that a plaintiff is entitled _as of
right_ to issue a warrant of arrest if the requirements are complied with (see
_The Varna_ [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 253 at 257–258; and Nigel Meeson, _Admiralty
Jurisdiction and Practice_ (LLP, 3rd Ed, 2003) at para 4.42). In other words,
a warrant of arrest has ceased to be a discretionary remedy in England after
the 1986 amendments, and has become a remedy that is available as of right to
a plaintiff in the circumstances prescribed by the English rules (_The Varna_
at 257; see also the case note by M S Dockray, “Disclosure and Arrest of
Ships” (1994) 110 LQR 382 at 384).

84 In _The Rainbow Spring_ [2003] 3 SLR 362, Judith Prakash J, delivering the
judgment of this court, stressed that the position in Singapore differed from
that of England. This is because, apart from the differences between the
English Rules and our Rules of Court, the warrant of arrest here is issued by
the court at its discretion (at [32]). She further pointed out that as the
arrest of a vessel was a drastic remedy given on an _ex parte_ basis, the duty
to make full and frank disclosure to the court was an important _bulwark_
against the abuse of the arrest process (at [37]):

There must be the possibility of a sanction for the failure to observe that
duty [to make full and frank disclosure]. … The courts must retain the
discretion to set aside an arrest for non-disclosure if the facts warrant it
notwithstanding that otherwise they would have jurisdiction over the matter
and that the procedure in the Rules had been followed. [emphasis added]

Indeed, so important is this duty that the failure to make full and frank
disclosure can be an independent ground for setting aside an arrest (_id_ at
[35]; _The AA V_ [2001] 1 SLR 207 at [47]; _The Evmar_ [1989] SLR 474 at 479,
[11]). However, while material non-disclosure is a legitimate ground for
setting aside a warrant of arrest, the courts always retain an overriding
discretion whether or not to do so. In _The Fierbinti_ [1994] 3 SLR 864, L P
Thean JA noted at 879–880, [42]:

However, assuming that these matters are material and ought to have been
disclosed, the court would still have a discretion whether or not to set aside
the warrant of arrest on that ground. The court below did not consider this
issue and therefore had not really exercised its discretion. We, in exercise
of our discretion, would not have been disposed to set aside the warrant of
arrest purely on the basis that the respondents had failed to disclose these
matters in obtaining the warrant of arrest.

The courts will often apply the principle of proportionality in assessing the
sin of omission against the impact of such default. This invariably requires a
measured assessment of the material facts as well as the circumstances in
which the application has been made.

_The content/scope of disclosure_

85 The duty to make full and frank disclosure is to disclose all _material_
facts (_The Rainbow Spring_ at [33]). The test of materiality for an arrest
application is also the same as that required in other _ex parte_ civil
remedies (_ibid_). The underlying rationale is that these are all remedies
that may potentially cause enormous and sometimes irreparable damage to a
defendant or other connected parties. Further, the judge hearing the matter,
not having the benefit of countervailing arguments, may not be appropriately
sensitised to the real merits of the application and the potentially hazardous
ramifications of the remedy, particularly (as is usually the case) if the
relief is sought on an urgent basis. Fairly and logically, the onus of
ensuring that the judge is given a balanced view of the matter rests squarely
and uncompromisingly on every applicant in an _ex parte_ application. A decade
earlier, in _The Damavand_ [1993] 2 SLR 717 at 731, [30], this court
summarised the test of materiality for non-disclosure as follows:

[T]he test of materiality is whether the fact is _relevant_ to the making of
the decision whether or not to issue the warrant of arrest, that is, a fact
which should properly be taken into consideration when weighing all the
circumstances of the case, _though it need not have the effect of leading to a
different decision being made_. [emphasis added]

86 In _Tay Long Kee Impex_ ([83] _supra_), this court further attempted to
clarify the elements of “materiality” at [21]:

Any definition of ‘materiality’ has to be, by its very nature, general. In the
words of Ralph Gibson LJ in _Brinks-MAT_ _Ltd v Elcombe_ [1988] 3 All ER 188
‘material facts are those which it is material for the judge to know in
dealing with the application.’ _It need not be ‘decisive or conclusive’_ — per
Warren LH Khoo J in _Poon Kng Siang v Tan Ah Keng_ [1992] 1 SLR 562. We would
add that the duty to disclose applies not only to material facts known to the
applicant but also such additional facts which he would have known if he had
made proper inquiries. The extent of the inquiries which an applicant should
make would have to depend on the facts and circumstances prevailing in the
case. [emphasis added]

What is clear from the above two cases is that material facts are not strictly
limited to facts which will have a determinative impact on the court’s
decision. So long as the facts are matters that the court should take into
consideration in making its decision, they are material.

87 The test for materiality is always an objective one. In the words of
Prakash J in _The Rainbow Spring_ , the test is to simply ask “how _relevant_
the fact is” [emphasis added] (at [33]). However, the duty imposed on the
applicant requires him to ask what might be relevant to the court in its
assessment of whether or not the remedy should be granted, and not what the
applicant alone might think is relevant. This inevitably embraces matters,
both factual and legal, which may be prejudicial or disadvantageous to the
successful outcome of the applicant’s application. It extends to all material
facts that could be reasonably ascertained and defences that might be
reasonably raised by the defendant. It is important to stress, however, that
the duty extends only to plausible, and not all conceivable or theoretical,
defences. For example, if there have been unsuccessful prior proceedings, the
context as well as the reasons for the dismissal must be adequately disclosed.
In short, the material facts are those which are material to enable the judge
to make an informed decision (see _Brink’s Mat_ _Ltd v Elcombe_ [1988] 1 WLR
1350 _per_ Ralph Gibson LJ at 1356).

88 That said, we think it necessary to add, that parties should not
meticulously attempt to dissect the factual matrix in painstaking efforts to
“invent” missing material facts. We note that, unfortunately, all too often,
in setting aside applications, much unnecessary time is unhelpfully expended
in dubiously making out a case of the alleged failure of a claimant to place
all the material facts before the court. In many instances, these complaints
amount to no more than factual peccadilloes that have no material bearing on
the decision-making process or the outcome of the original application. This
should be discouraged. What is material is, in the final analysis, essentially
a matter of _common sense_. The duty to make full and frank disclosure does
not, we should add, require the plaintiff to disclose every relevant document,
as it must on discovery (Richard N Ough & William Flenley, _The Mareva
Injunction and Anton Piller Order_ (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1993) at para
6.1.5). Also, as mentioned by this court in _Tay Long Kee Impex_ (at [21]),
the duty to disclose extends to facts the applicant would have known if he had
made proper inquiries, but the “ _extent_ of the inquiries which an applicant
should make would have to _depend on the facts and circumstances prevailing in
the case_ ” [emphasis added] (see [86] above). Adequate disclosure must be
made directly to the court and it is the duty of the solicitor to ensure that
this obligation is properly discharged. It is always preferable to err on the
side of more disclosure rather than less. However, the wood should not be
missed for the trees. We would agree with the learned author of _Commercial
Injunctions_ ([83] _supra_ at para 9.005) that it is all about striking a
right balance at the end of the day, though, admittedly, this is not a
straightforward exercise:

It is often a difficult exercise to settle a suitable affidavit which achieves
the _right balance_ between full and fair disclosure and a far too detailed
description of the facts, with perhaps too much generosity towards the
defendant. The duty of disclosure does not require the applicant to describe
his case or the factual background in minute detail, nor does it require him
to search for possible but unlikely defences. [emphasis added]

89 The decision of the Federal Court of Australia in _Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven
GmbH v The Owners of the Ship “Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya”_ [1997] FCA 379 (“
_Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH_ ”) is instructive in this respect. In that
case, the plaintiff provided alteration, repair and equipping services to
ships owned by Black Sea Shipping Co (“BLASCO”). BLASCO, in turn, failed to
pay the plaintiff its charges. Consequently, the plaintiff arrested a ship
named _Zoya_ , which the plaintiff believed was a ship beneficially owned by
BLASCO. BLASCO did not enter an appearance, but appearance was instead filed
by Tor Shipping Ltd (“Tor”), the demise charterer of the _Zoya_. The
plaintiff’s affidavit in support of the arrest asserted, without
qualification, that BLASCO was the owner of the _Zoya_ , and this was
apparently based on entries on the Lloyd’s Register (which eventually were
proved to be outdated) that reflected BLASCO as the owner. It transpired that
at the time of the arrest, the updated entries on the Lloyd’s Register showed
that Ukraine Shipping Company was the owner of the _Zoya_. Accordingly, Tor
sought to set aside the arrest, _inter alia_ , on the ground that there was a
failure on the part of the plaintiff to make full and frank disclosure. At
first instance, Tamberlin J declined to set aside the arrest on the ground of
non-disclosure, and he explained his reasons as follows:

In the present case, the supporting affidavit specifically and without
qualification, stated that BLASCO was the owner at the relevant date. If it
had been shown that there was credible relevant evidence known to the deponent
but withheld from the Court, on the application, there may have been a ground
for release in the present case.

However, I have considered the testimony of the solicitor handling the matter
both in chief and under cross-examination together with the material placed
before me. _Whilst the Lloyd’s Register entry relied on for the_ _arrest_ _was
outdated, the evidence does not go so far as to satisfy me that either the
solicitor or other persons acting on behalf of the plaintiff, or the plaintiff
itself, was aware that the Lloyd’s Register relied on had been updated_. Nor
am I satisfied that the plaintiff or the solicitors withheld any relevant
information from the Court in initiating the arrest proceedings. Should it
subsequently become apparent that evidence placed before the Court on an
arrest was incorrect then it is incumbent on the solicitors to correct it
forthwith.

[emphasis added]

90 Tamberlin J’s decision on this point was upheld on appeal (see _Lloyd Werft
Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship “Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya”_ (1997) 79 FCR 71 at
94):

Tor sought to challenge his Honour’s rejection of its alternative argument,
which had been based on an alleged failure by [the plaintiff], when applying
ex parte for the arrest of the ship, to disclose information held, not by Ms
Rusiti [the plaintiff’s solicitor], but by Mr Haake [the plaintiff’s general
manager]. We see no ground for our intervention in this connection. His Honour
was not satisfied that either [the plaintiff] or its solicitor withheld
information. Ms Rusiti was cross-examined, and Mr Haake was in Germany. As has
been seen, the ultimate question whether BLASCO was the beneficial owner at
particular times was especially complex, both factually and in terms of the
identification and the application of foreign law. On this alternative
argument, questions of credit were central. We see no reason to interfere with
the primary Judge’s conclusions on this aspect.

_Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH_ demonstrates the point that it is not open to a
defendant to allege that the plaintiff has failed to disclose material facts
which, in the first place, the plaintiff could not have _reasonably_ be
expected to know or to have found out through proper inquiries at the time of
the arrest. It cannot be emphasised enough that the scope of disclosure should
be what is reasonable in the given circumstances at the time of the arrest,
and this is, at the very end of the day (as we have already noted above), a
matter of common sense.

_The threshold of disclosure_

91 It should also be pointed out that mere disclosure of material facts
without more or devoid of the proper context is in itself plainly insufficient
to constitute full and frank disclosure; the threshold of the disclosure to be
met is also crucial. In this regard, we are referring specifically to the
_manner_ of disclosure that is required of a plaintiff making the _ex parte_
application. In other words, we are concerned with how the material facts can
best be presented to the court so as to ensure that the court receives the
most complete and undistorted picture of the material facts, sufficient for
its purpose of making an informed and fair decision on the outcome of the
application, such that the threshold of full and frank disclosure can be
meaningfully said to be crossed. It would be instructive to have reference to
some cases that have commented on the proper manner of disclosure.

92 In _Intergraph Corporation v Solid Systems CAD Services Limited_ [1993] FSR
617, Baker J penetratingly observed at 625 as follows:

To present a judge with 600 pages of material on an _ex parte_ application is
coming a bit near abuse, unless he is firmly and carefully guided, through the
material. Of course I recognise at once that legal advisers are in a difficult
situation. If they do not put enough in, they get attacked because they have
not made full disclosure. On the other hand if they put too much in then
complaints arise that the judge cannot cope with it. That is something that
legal advisers have to live with, because clearly it is of no use putting it
in if the judge either cannot or does not read it. It is just as much not
disclosed as if it had not been put in at all. _Unless the document is
presented to the eyes and/or the ears of the judge, it is not disclosed._
[emphasis added]

93 In _National Bank of Sharjah v Dellborg_ [1993] 2 Bank LR 109, Lloyd LJ
(with Ralph Gibson LJ and Sir Michael Kerr concurring) additionally observed
(at 112):

_[T]he place to disclose the facts, both favourable and adverse, is in the
affidavit and not in the exhibits_. No doubt it will usually be convenient to
exhibit a few key documents where it is necessary to do so to explain the
case. But the recent tendency to overload the case at the ex parte stage and
to burden the judge with masses of documents in case something is left out,
ought to be firmly resisted. _If the facts are not fairly stated in the
affidavit, it will not assist the plaintiff to be able to point to some
exhibit from which that fact might be extracted_. [emphasis added]

94 Thus, it is for the applicant’s counsel, in his or her presentation of the
material facts, to draw the judge’s attention to the relevant papers, and it
is not sufficient to produce exhibits which contain the papers if no specific
reference is made to them; a failure to refer to material documents is a
failure to disclose (Mark S W Hoyle, _Freezing and Search Orders_ (Informa,
4th Ed, 2006) at para 5.18). Further, all material facts should be fairly
stated in the affidavit, and it is not open to a plaintiff to say that it has
fulfilled its duty to make full and frank disclosure because the relevant
facts can be distilled somewhat from somewhere in the voluminous exhibits
filed. In short, in the words of Bingham J in _Siporex Trade SA v Comdel
Commodities Ltd_ [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 428 at 437, the applicant must “identify
the crucial points for and against the application, _and not rely on general
statements and the mere exhibiting of numerous documents_ ” [emphasis added].

95 In this appeal, it is worth noting that the affidavit filed by the Banks in
support of the application for arrest constituted an impressive “tome” of some
400 pages. The narrative text, however, only amounted to a miserly 11 pages.
The exhibits constituted the remaining pages. We reviewed the narrative text
of the affidavit and found it to be conspicuous for its rather stark poverty
of the relevant factual matters and, more crucially, context; there was
plainly no mention of the first and third material facts condensed earlier at
[79] above. We now turn to deal with each of the “missing” facts in turn to
assess their materiality.

_Non-disclosure of the_ inter partes _hearing in Lomé_

96 With regards to the Banks’ failure to disclose to AR Lee that there had
been a contested hearing in Lomé before the chartered vessel was released, AR
Ang found (at [38] of AR Ang’s GD):

In my opinion, the fact that the _Chelyabinsk_ was released from arrest in
Lome pursuant to an order of court after an inter partes hearing _would have
been something that a duty registrar would have wanted to know in deciding
whether to issue a warrant of arrest_. I agree with FESCO’s submissions that
the duty registrar’s attention would then be drawn to the fact that another
court of competent jurisdiction had already determined that there was no right
of arrest for the same claims by the plaintiffs. _The duty registrar might
well have required further clarification as to whether a warrant of arrest
should still be issued in Singapore despite the prior arrest having been set
aside_. [emphasis added]

97 The Banks initially contended that while they had not specifically
mentioned the contested hearing in Lomé to AR Lee, the fact that there had
been a contested hearing at Lomé could quite easily have been gleaned from the
exhibits in the affidavit filed in support of the application for arrest. They
also pointed out AR Lee had intimated that he had read all the arrest papers,
though it appears that there is no satisfactory evidence of this on record.
The Judge, agreeing with AR Ang, noted that there was room for doubt as to
whether the AR Lee had read the entire affidavit, including all the exhibits
contained therein, which amounted to around 400 pages. We think, on the other
hand, given the materiality, and crucial importance, of the Lomé proceedings,
it was obviously necessary for the Banks’ counsel to directly draw the court’s
attention to, and stress, this particular fact. It is wholly unsatisfactory
for counsel, having left discovery of this issue purely to chance, to invite
us now to make suppositions as to whether AR Lee was actually aware of this
earlier development.

98 We also find it pertinent that in _The Kherson_ [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 261 at
268, it was held that the existence of foreign proceedings in respect of the
same claim was a material fact that had to be disclosed. In that matter, the
claimant had obtained arrest applications in Rotterdam and London. Even though
there was a brief reference in the affidavit to proceedings in Rotterdam
described as “protective proceedings” said to have been “commenced solely for
the purpose of protecting the time limit from prescription and no further
steps have been taken in connection with such proceedings other than those
necessary to preserve their validity”, the court had no hesitation in finding
that this buried reference was wholly insufficient to point out that the court
in Rotterdam was seized of the proceedings. This obscured “the inevitable
consequence that proceedings in [London] would be stayed or that jurisdiction
would be declined” (_ibid_). Likewise, in _The Varna_ ([83] _supra_), the
English Court of Appeal held that but for the 1986 amendments to the English
Rules of the Supreme Court (see [83] above), it would have been necessary for
the plaintiff to disclose the existence of Bulgarian proceedings in respect of
the same action in the affidavit (see also _Admiralty Law and Practice_ ([39]
_supra_) at p 173).

99 The fact that there had been an earlier _inter partes_ hearing on the
arrest of the chartered vessel on the same claims in Lomé was by any yardstick
a highly pertinent fact that should have been drawn to AR Lee’s attention.
There is, upon closer scrutiny, no real difference between the essential
features of the Togolese and Singapore claims mounted in rapid succession by
the Banks. The fact that the Lomé court had already considered and dismissed
the Banks’ arguments as to whether the chartered vessel could be arrested by
the Banks at Lomé was, certainly, a material fact to be taken into account by
AR Lee in considering whether or not a warrant of arrest of the _Vasiliy
Golovnin_ should be issued here in Singapore. He would have in all likelihood
have pursued this line of enquiry further. It is quite pointless for the Banks
to now belatedly invite us to speculate on whether AR Lee _might_ have
ascertained this fact after he had perused the affidavit and exhibits. As AR
Ang quite aptly put it, “the applicant must ensure that all which should be
seen by the court is in fact seen” (AR Ang’s GD at [40]). Likewise, as we have
already mentioned (see [94] above), it is plainly the duty of counsel to draw
the material facts to the judge’s attention and not rely on the mere
exhibiting of numerous documents in the affidavit.

100 The material fact that the Banks ought to have brought to AR Lee’s
attention is not merely that the chartered vessel was released from arrest in
Lomé, but that the arrest was set aside in respect of the very same claims
then being pursued again in Singapore. Furthermore, the release in Lomé was
ordered after an _inter partes_ hearing and grounds of decision had been
given. The failure by the Banks to draw these material facts to AR Lee’s
attention was difficult to fathom and, bluntly put, nothing short of
inexcusable. If the Banks had been frank in their disclosure to the court
about the existence of the prior _inter partes_ hearing (and its outcome), the
court may “well have required further clarification on the situation before
deciding to issue the warrant” (_per_ Judith Prakash J in _The AA V_ ([84]
_supra_) at [47]). This would certainly have allowed AR Lee to make a more
informed decision. We would be startled if he had made the same orders once
all these material facts had indeed been properly placed before him.

_Non-disclosure of the proposed “switch” of the bills of lading_

101 The Judge found that the Banks had failed to disclose another material
fact, namely, that the main purpose of switching the bills of lading was to
change the port of discharge from Lomé to Douala. In the affidavit filed in
support of their application, the Banks created the impression that the
agreement to switch the bills of lading was made primarily to facilitate
dividing the consignment into different proportions.

102 It is evident from the notes of evidence and AR Ang’s GD that AR Lee was
aware that there had been a request for the cargo to be discharged at Douala.
However, the fact that this had been preceded by a request to change the port
of discharge from Lomé to Douala was not explained to him at all. This is
material as it would have alerted AR Lee to the fact that, without the switch
of bills, FESCO had correctly performed the terms of the contract of carriage,
as recorded in the bills of lading, by transporting the cargo to Lomé. The
Judge felt that the reason for the proposed switch of the bills of lading was
material and ought to have been disclosed to AR Lee. This appears correct to
us.

103 Crédit Agricole reiterated that, as some of the bills of lading stated the
discharge port as “any African port”, any change of the port of discharge was
only “incidental” to the “re-cutting” of the bills and that “re-cutting” the
bills was the primary motive for the switch. To support this, Crédit Agricole
emphasised that some cargo originally destined for Lomé was discharged at
Abidjan “without the need for a switch”. Ms Ang insisted that, as the main
purpose in switching the bills was to “re-cut” them and not to change the port
of discharge from Lomé to Douala, there had been no material non-disclosure in
relation to this point.[note: 13]

104 We find this argument unconvincing. The cargo discharged at Abidjan was
not and has never been the subject of proceedings in either Lomé or Singapore
and is wholly immaterial to the present appeal. Further, the cargo was
discharged under a letter of indemnity in Abidjan, primarily because the bills
of lading stated the port of discharge as Lomé and not Abidjan. In our view,
the bills of lading were not as “flexible” in relation to the discharge port
as Crédit Agricole made it out to be and Crédit Agricole ought to have made it
clear to AR Lee that the main objective of switching the bills of lading was
to permit a change of the port of discharge.

105 In order to properly and timeously dispose of cases, the courts must be
able to repose complete confidence in counsel and unflinchingly believe that
counsel have placed all material facts before them. This is particularly true
in admiralty cases where time is usually of the essence and an arrest order is
often made after an _ex parte_ hearing. Every arrest order entails serious,
and sometimes irreparable, consequences. It is for this reason that the duty
to make full and frank disclosure of material facts to the court has been
called an important bulwark against the abuse of the arrest process. We are
not prepared to weaken this bulwark by overlooking what appears to us, in this
matter, to be a grave “oversight”.

_Synopsis_

106 Upon reviewing the supporting affidavit and examining AR Lee’s notes of
evidence, we are more than satisfied that Crédit Agricole failed to disclose
the two material facts above. First, in relation to the _ex parte_ hearing in
Lomé, even if this fact could be gleaned from the exhibits, Crédit Agricole
did not meet the required threshold for disclosure because it did not draw
this fact to AR Lee’s attention. As for the objective behind the proposed
switch of the bills of lading, Crédit Agricole failed to disclose this
material fact altogether. AR Lee’s notes of evidence are conspicuous for the
lack of any reference to the _ex parte_ hearing in Lomé. His notes of evidence
give an inkling of what he had been led to believe was important:[note: 14]

For the sea-web searches, exhibited at pages 27 and 29 of your affidavit, when
were these searches done? Because I notice that the information for the
vessels (at pages 27 and 29) were updated in May and July 2005 respectively,
but that the information for FESCO was updated in February 2006. And the
search results that are exhibited do not contain the usual web address and
date printout at the bottom ...

There was no attempt whatsoever to draw his attention to any of the material
facts. He seems quite clearly to have focused only on the issue of the actual
ownership of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ and the chartered vessel.

107 The failure to disclose the main objective for the proposed switch of the
bills of lading and the fact that there had already been an _inter partes_
hearing in Lomé on the same claims is, plainly put, indefensible. These are
facts which should have been disclosed to the court, for the court to
carefully scrutinise and scrupulously assess them, prior to any determination
to arrest the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ being made.

108 Nevertheless, as mentioned above (at [84]), despite the finding of
material non-disclosure, this court still retains the discretion in all such
cases whether or not to set aside the warrant of arrest. The nature and the
reasons for the disclosure are crucial. In _Tay Long Kee Impex_ ([83]
_supra_), Chao Hick Tin JA noted that where there was suppression, instead of
innocent omission, of the material facts, it would have to be a _special case_
before the court would exercise its discretion to grant the remedy sought,
notwithstanding such omission (_id_ at [35]).

109 Following this, in _Treasure Valley Group Ltd v Saputra Teddy_ [2006] 1
SLR 358, a case involving the setting aside of an arrest warrant on the issue
of non-disclosure, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J succinctly summarised the position
thus at [23]:

When a court condemns material non-disclosure by setting aside the _ex parte_
order, it does so in the public interest to discourage abuse of its procedure
in an _ex parte_ application. The condemnation is a reminder of the importance
of dealing in good faith with the court when _ex parte_ applications are made.
The court retains a discretion not to set aside the arrest even though the
non-disclosure is deliberate, but this discretion will only be exercised in a
special case.

110 It seems to us that the relevance of the material facts would have been
plainly obvious to any reasonable solicitor who had reviewed the matter
diligently. In this matter, there was more than ample time for the Banks’
counsel to properly obtain instructions and ascertain the correct position. We
are therefore constrained by the circumstances to conclude that this was not a
case of a mere oversight. This was by no means a complex case where a
pardonable mistake in assessing materiality had been made as a result of
haste. Further, we see absolutely no basis to exercise our discretion in
favour of excusing Crédit Agricole for its grave serial lapses. It also bears
reiteration that, given our earlier decision to affirm the striking out of
crucial portions of the claim that pertain directly to the arrest, this
decision is, at the end of the day, really a moot point. In the result, we
also dismiss Crédit Agricole’s appeal on the issue of material non-disclosure.

**_Issue estoppel_**

111 A further ground relied on by AR Ang and the Judge for setting aside the
warrant of arrest was issue estoppel. It is trite that a foreign judgment can
give rise to an issue estoppel so as to prevent a party to that foreign action
from vexing another party to that action by an attempt to re-open an issue
already resolved in the foreign court. In the light of our findings on the
sustainability of the claim and material non-disclosure, we do not think it is
necessary to deal with this ground in any detail. We do, nevertheless, agree
with the Judge’s determination on this point as well as his grounds for it (at
[36]–[51] of the Judge’s GD).

**CA 110/2007**

112 We now turn to FESCO’s cross-appeal. Both the Banks are the respondents in
this appeal. FESCO contends that the Banks’ conduct in arresting the _Vasiliy
Golovnin_ evinces _mala fides_ or, at the very least, _crassa negligentia_. In
these circumstances, FESCO maintains that it is entitled to damages for
wrongful arrest.

**_The test of wrongful arrest_**

_The_ Evangelismos _test_

113 In Singapore, the law on when damages may be recovered for wrongful arrest
of ships has been authoritatively and lucidly set out in _The Kiku Pacific_
[1999] 2 SLR 595. M Karthigesu JA, on behalf of this court, approved the test
for awarding damages for wrongful arrest that was first enunciated some 150
years ago in _The Evangelismos_ (1858) 12 Moo PC 352; 14 ER 945 (“ _The
Evangelismos_ ”) by the Privy Council (“the _Evangelismos_ test”). The
_Evangelismos_ test sets a high threshold for damages in wrongful arrest
cases. The Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh, delivering the judgment of the Privy
Council in that case, laid out the famous test in the following terms (at 359;
948):

Undoubtedly there may be cases in which there is either _mala fides_ , or that
_crassa negligentia_ , which implies malice, which would justify a Court of
Admiralty giving damages, as in an action brought at Common law damages may be
obtained. …

The **_real question_** in this case … comes to this: is there or is there
not, reason to say, that the action was _so unwarrantably brought,**or**
brought with so little colour, **or** so little foundation_, that it rather
implies malice on the part of the Plaintiff, or that gross negligence which is
equivalent to it?

[emphasis in italics and bold italics added]

Briefly, in _The Evangelismos_ , the court concluded that the factual matrix
“afforded ground for believing that [the arrested] ship was the one that had
been in collision with the barge” (_ibid_). While that belief was ultimately
shown to have been misplaced, there was also objective evidence to show that
the arrest was a genuine mistake supported by an honest belief. In those
circumstances, damages were not awarded.

114 Subsequent to the decision of the Privy Council in _The Evangelismos_ ,
the English Admiralty Court, in a series of decisions that followed in quick
succession, settled decisively on the principle that damages could be
recovered as a result of a wrongful detention only if there was evidence of
_mala fides_ or _crassa negligentia_ , and in a number of these decisions,
damages were actually awarded. It will be helpful, for present purposes, to
briefly refer to some of these decisions. They are:

(a) _The Victor_ (1860) Lush 72; 167 ER 38: The plaintiff’s vessel, the
_Vrede_ , collided with the defendant’s vessel, the _Victor_. The cargo in its
hold, owned by the owners of the _Victor_ , was insufficient to make good the
damage to the _Vrede_. The plaintiffs then obtained a warrant of arrest for
both the _Victor_ as well as the cargo it carried. In his subsequent decision
in _The Volant_ (1864) 22 Br & Lush 321 at 323; 167 ER 385 at 386, Dr
Lushington noted of his judgment in _The Victor_ :

The case of _The “Victor_ ” (Lush. 72), which has been referred to, was one in
which, in a cause of collision, the plaintiff endeavoured to make the cargo of
the opposing ship liable for his loss – a mere experiment, and an experiment
contrary to the long practice of the Court, and the elementary principles of
law.

The court directed that the cargo be released. Damages were awarded for the
cargo’s improper detention.

(b) _The Cheshire Witch_ (1864) Br & Lush 362; 167 ER 402: The _Cheshire
Witch_ had been “arrested in a cause of damage” (at 362; 402). The defendant
shipowner could not procure bail and the vessel remained under arrest until
the cause was heard. Judgment with costs was then entered for the defendant
shipowner. Although the plaintiff did not file a notice of appeal, he applied
to court and obtained an order for the vessel to be detained for a further
period of 12 days while he considered whether to appeal. At the end of that
period, the plaintiff decided not to appeal. The vessel was released on the
following day. The defendant shipowner then claimed damages for that period of
12 days. The court observed that the plaintiff had no cause of action and that
the additional period of 12 days of the arrest had “operated very severely” on
the shipowner (_ibid_). While not using the term _mala fides_ or _crassa
negligentia_ , Dr Lushington, who decided _The Evangelismos_ , at the first
instance, had no qualms in ordering damages to be paid. More recently, Colman
J in _The Kommunar (No 3)_ [1997] 1 Lloyds Rep 22 at 30 pertinently observed:

_The Cheshire Witch_ must be treated as a case where, following judgment
against the plaintiff, an appeal was manifestly so hopeless as to deprive the
plaintiff of all reasonable grounds for continuing the arrest.

(c) _The Cathcart_ (1867) LR 1 A & E 314: In this case, the parties were
involved in a financial scheme, including a mortgage, involving a vessel. The
defendant shipowner obtained a direction from a magistrate ordering the
plaintiffs to allow the vessel to remain in the defendant’s possession.
Notwithstanding this, the plaintiffs arrested the vessel, _inter alia_ , on
grounds of non-payment under the terms of the mortgage. It transpired that the
contractual arrangements clearly did not support such a claim. Distinguishing
_The Evangelismos_ on its facts but nevertheless applying its principle, Dr
Lushington held that it must have been obvious to the plaintiffs that they had
arrested the vessel when no moneys were due to them. Further, the plaintiffs
arrested the vessel just “on the eve of commencing a profitable voyage, and
after a decision of the magistrate adverse to their claim” (at 333). The court
held the plaintiffs liable for damages and costs. This case suggests that a
gross mistake can amount to _crassa negligentia_.

(d) _The Margaret Jane_ (1869) LR 2 A & E 345: In this case, a “receiver of
wreck” had valued a salved vessel at £746 and salvors thereafter commenced
proceedings in the admiralty court for £2,500. The salvors subsequently
applied for an appraisement of the vessel and eventually abandoned the claim.
The shipowners claimed damages for wrongful arrest on the ground that when the
salvors instituted the suit, they were aware that the admiralty court had no
jurisdiction as the value of the property salved was below £1,000. After
referring to the _Evangelismos_ test as stating the applicable law, Sir R
Phillimore held that there was no _mala fides_ in this case, but that the
salvors must have been aware, within a short time of taking out the
appraisement application, that the value fixed by the receiver was
substantially correct, and they were therefore liable in damages in respect of
the period of time from such point of time until they released the vessel (at
346). Sir Phillimore did not make an express finding on whether the salvors’
conduct amounted to _crassa negligentia_ ; in fact, he said he thought it
might be harsh to say that the salvors were guilty of _crassa negligentia_ in
the given circumstances (_ibid_). This case demonstrates that damages may be
awarded in some instances where it must have been so clear to the arrestor
that there was simply no basis for detaining a ship.

115 Most of the above cases were considered more recently by Colman J in _The
Kommunar (No 3)_ , where he gave the modern formulation of the _Evangelismos_
test. His decision in this case also best demonstrates the high threshold set
by the _Evangelismos_ test (see also Aleka Mandaraka-Sheppard, _Modern
Maritime Law and Risk Management_ (Routledge-Cavendish, 2nd Ed, 2007) (“
_Modern Maritime Law_ ”) at p 122). In an earlier judgment (see _The Kommunar
(No 2)_ [1997] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 8), Colman J had set aside the arrest of the
vessel, the _Kommunar_ , on the basis that there the court had no jurisdiction
to entertain proceedings _in rem_ against the vessel, given that “the
defendant owners at the time of the arrest (‘AOL’) were not the same legal
entity as the owners, charterers or party in possession of the vessel when the
cause of action arose against them in the period December, 1991 to August,
1992, (‘POL’)” (_The Kommunar (No 3)_ at 24). The change in legal entity was a
result of privatisation of POL under the Russian Federation privatisation
legislation. Despite this finding, the shipowners failed in their claim for
damages for wrongful arrest in _The Kommunar (No 3)_. Colman J reasoned that,
on the evidence, there was no proof of _mala fides_ or _crassa negligentia_ on
the part of the plaintiffs as he found it “quite impossible to say that it
should have been obvious to the plaintiffs or their advisers that the claim to
English jurisdiction was bound to fail” given the “relatively complicated
nature of [the Russian] privatization [process]” and that the “resolution of
the issue involved relatively complicated matters of analysis of the Russian
legislation” (_id_ at 31). In arriving at his conclusion, Colman J considered
the _Evangelismos_ test and held that it essentially envisaged two types of
cases that the courts would award damages for wrongful arrest of ships (at
30):

Two types of cases are thus envisaged. _Firstly, there are cases of mala
fides, which must be taken to mean those cases where on the primary evidence
the arresting party has no honest belief in his entitlement to arrest the
vessel. Secondly, there are those cases in which objectively there is so
little basis for the arrest that it may be inferred that the arresting party
did not believe in his entitlement to arrest the vessel or acted without any
serious regard to whether there were adequate grounds for the arrest of the
vessel._ It is, as I understand the judgment [in _The Evangelismos_], in the
latter sense that such phrases as “crassa negligentia” and “gross negligence”
are used and are described as implying malice or being equivalent to it. The
reference at the end of the passage from the judgment just cited to there
being circumstances which afforded grounds for believing that the arrested
ship was the one that had been in collision suggests that if on the evidence
there is a genuine but understandable mistake as to the identity of the
vessel, that will not amount to crassa negligentia. Taking the judgment as a
whole, it would not appear that mere absence of reasonable care to ascertain
entitlement to arrest the vessel would necessarily amount to [_crassa
negligentia_] in the sense there used. [emphasis added]

116 Colman J’s above formulation of the _Evangelismos_ test was referred to
approvingly by the English Court of Appeal in the subsequent case of _Gulf
Azov Shipping Co Ltd v Idisi_ [2001] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 727 (“ _Gulf Azov Shipping_
”) at 735 as “this exposition of the modern law” (see also Sarah C Derrington
& James M Turner, _The Law and Practice of Admiralty Matters_ (Oxford
University Press, 2007) at para 7.72). This appears to be the latest English
case that has touched on the topic of damages arising from wrongful arrest. In
_Gulf Azov Shipping_ , the claim for wrongful arrest succeeded as there was
clear evidence of _crassa negligentia_. The first plaintiff’s ship was
arrested on 6 August 1997 by the defendants in Nigeria for an alleged claim of
US$17m for lost cargo. In an application for the release of the vessel, the
High Court in Lagos decided that the defendants’ best arguable case was a
claim in the sum of US$1m, and ordered that the ship be released on the
strength of a security of US$1m that the first plaintiff’s P&I club was
willing to furnish by way of a letter of undertaking. Unfortunately, the ship
was not released until much later on 9 May 1999, following an impasse in
subsequent legal proceedings in Nigeria. After the release of the vessel, the
plaintiff commenced an action for damages for wrongful arrest in England. On a
summary judgment application, the English Court of Appeal held that as the
defendants were clearly aware that their claim for US$17m was not sustainable,
there was plainly no defence to the first plaintiff’s action and that the
first defendant could be said to have “acted without any serious regard to
whether there were adequate grounds for continuing the arrest” (at 738).
Accordingly, the court awarded damages.

117 Colman J’s modern formulation of the _Evangelismos_ test, together with
the famous passage from the Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh’s judgment in _The
Evangelismos_ , were both cited with approval by Karthigesu JA in _The Kiku
Pacific_ ([113] _supra_ at [14] and [17]). As mentioned, this court (at [30])
made it plain that in Singapore:

[T]he test is that laid down by the Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh in _the
Evangelismos_ of mala fides or gross negligence implying malice. In the
context of the appeal, the question would be this; in bringing the action
against the owners, did Fal [the arresting party] know or honestly [believe]
that they could not legitimately arrest the ship so as to imply malice, or in
arresting the vessel, did Fal fail to apply their mind as to whether they
could legitimately arrest the vessel, and nevertheless [proceeded] to arrest
the vessel because Fal [were] bent on putting pressure on the owners to accede
to their demand, so as to imply gross negligence; and in refusing the security
offered by the owners in March 1996, was Fal’s refusal malicious or grossly
negligent.

_Some perceived problems with the_ Evangelismos _test_

118 Despite being decided some 150 years ago, the _Evangelismos_ test
continues to also prevail in several other parts of the Commonwealth,
including Canada (see the decision of the Canadian Supreme Court in _Armada
Lines Ltd v Chaleur Fertilizers Ltd_ [1997] 2 SCR 617 (“ _Armada Lines Ltd_
”)), New Zealand (see the decision of the New Zealand High Court in _Mobil Oil
New Zealand Ltd v The ship “Rangiora”_ [2000] 1 NZLR 49 (“ _Mobil Oil New
Zealand Ltd_ ”); and Damien J Cremean, _Admiralty Jurisdiction: Law and
Practice in Australia and New Zealand_ (The Federation Press, 2nd Ed, 2003) (“
_Law and Practice in Australia and New Zealand_ ”) at p 151), Hong Kong (see
the decision of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in _The Maule_ [1995] 2 HKC 769)
and, of course, the United Kingdom (as referred to above). (See generally
Michael Woodford, “Damages for Wrongful Arrest: Section 34, Admiralty Act
1988” (2005) 19 MLAANZ Journal 115 (“Woodford’s article”), which provides a
helpful survey of the international jurisprudence concerning wrongful arrest.)
It appears to us that _mala fides_ or _crassa negligentia_ also continues to
be the basis for the award of damages for wrongful arrest in the United States
of America (see _Frontera Fruit Co, Inc v Dowling_ 91 F 2d 293 (5th Cir, 1937)
at 297; see also Woodford’s article at 132 and Thomas J Schoenbaum, _Admiralty
and Maritime Law_ (Thomson West, 4th Ed, 2004) at pp 1091–1092).

119 The high threshold set by the _Evangelismos_ test appears to have deterred
many shipowners, including possibly even deserving ones, from pursuing claims
for wrongful arrest. Indeed, this is reflected in the paucity of cases on
wrongful arrest in England in the 20th century; after _E L Poulson v_ _The
Remaining Owners of the Schooner_ _Village Belle_ (1896) 12 TLR 630, a late
19th century case, the issue of damages for wrongful arrest did not arise
again for consideration in the English courts until several decades later in
_Astro Vencedor Compania Naviera SA of Panama v Mabanaft GmbH_ (_The
Damianos_) [1971] 2 QB 588 (see Woodford’s article at 125). Given the dearth
of claims, it is unsurprising that Lord Denning MR lamented in the latter case
(at 595) that “[t]here have not been many claims for wrongful arrest
recently”.

120 Aside from deterring deserving shipowners from pursuing wrongful arrest
claims, the difficulties in making out such claims have also given rise to
some concerns that an arrest may be procured with impunity on insubstantial
grounds so long as there is no malice or gross negligence (see _Admiralty Law
and Practice_ ([39] _supra_) at p 185). This is because the _Evangelismos_
test is so plaintiff-oriented that the risk of having to pay damages, even if
the arrest turns out to be unjustified, is so minimal that the plaintiff
hardly ever needs to be concerned about it. Cases like _Gulf Azov Shipping_
([116] _supra_), where there is clear evidence showing either malice or
_crassa negligentia_ , are rare and “[t]he problem of discharging the burden
of proof of wrongful arrest lies with the run-of-the-mill cases” (_Modern
Maritime Law_ ([115] _supra_) at p 123). The one-sidedness of the
_Evangelismos_ test seems especially harsh when one takes into consideration
the fact that shipowners may suffer substantial financial losses through the
arrest of their ships, even if a brief delay of a few hours is caused to the
ship’s sailing schedule (see _Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice_ ([83]
_supra_) at para 4.29; Woodford’s article at 115). Although costs may be
awarded to an aggrieved shipowner against a frivolous litigant, such costs
awarded, more often than not, do not sufficiently compensate the sometimes
severe financial loss that flows from the disruption of the commercial
activities of the arrested ship (_Admiralty Law and Practice_ ([39] _supra_)
at pp 185–186). The potential enormity of the losses that may be caused by an
arrest may also assert significant commercial pressures on a shipowner to
settle any claim, regardless of its merits (Woodford’s article at 115). These
problems have, in fact, prompted the governments in some commonwealth
countries to take action.

121 In Australia, the government had in 1982 referred all aspects of admiralty
jurisdiction, including the traditional test for obtaining damages for
wrongful arrest, to the Australian Law Reform Commission (“ALRC”) for review
and recommendation (see ALRC, _Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction_ (Report No 33,
1986) (“ALRC’s report”)). The result of this is the present s 34 of the
Admiralty Act 1988 (Act No 34 of 1988) (Cth), a provision proposed by the ALRC
(after undertaking a comprehensive review of the problems raised above), which
specifically provides in sub-s (1)(a)(ii) for damages to be awarded to
shipowners when a plaintiff “unreasonably and without good cause” arrests a
ship:

**34 Damages for unjustified arrest etc.**

(1) Where, in relation to a proceeding commenced under this Act:

(a) a party _unreasonably and without good cause_ :

(i) demands excessive security in relation to the proceeding; or

(ii) _obtains the arrest of a ship or other property under this Act_ ; or

(b) a party or other person unreasonably and without good cause fails to give
a consent required under this Act for the release from arrest of a ship or
other property;

the party or person is _liable in damages_ to a party to the proceeding, or to
a person who has an interest in the ship or property, being a party or person
who has suffered loss or damage as a direct result.

(2) The jurisdiction of a court in which a proceeding was commenced under this
Act extends to determining a claim arising under subsection (1) in relation to
the proceeding.

[emphasis added]

By premising liability on unreasonableness and a lack of good cause, the
present Australian test for wrongful arrest makes it ostensibly less onerous
for shipowners to succeed in their claims, given that there is no longer a
need to establish an absence of _bona fides_ or _crassa negligentia_ anymore
(see _The Laws of Australia_ (Thomson Lawbook Co, Looseleaf Ed, 1993) in vol
34 (John Livermore ed) at para 104; D A Butler & W D Duncan, _Maritime Law in
Australia_ (Legal Books, 1992) at para 3.2.18; D J Cremean, “Mala Fides or
Crassa Negligentia?” [1998] LMCLQ 9 at 11).

122 Besides Australia, the test in Nigeria and South Africa for wrongful
arrest is also specifically enacted in legislation and is tied to the concept
of reasonableness and the existence of a good cause (see s 13 of the Admiralty
Jurisdiction Decree (No 59 of 1991) (Nigeria) and s 5(4) of the Admiralty
Jurisdiction Regulation Act (No 105 of 1983) (S Africa); see also generally
Woodford’s article at 138–140). In fact, s 34 of the Australian Admiralty Act
1988 was motivated by s 5(4) of the South African Admiralty Jurisdiction
Regulation Act 1983 (see ALRC’s report at para 302), though their spans are
slightly different (see _The Law and Practice of Admiralty Matters_ ([116]
_supra_) at para 7.75). The test for awarding damages for wrongful arrest
therefore now varies across the Commonwealth. It is perhaps pertinent to note
here (in passing) that an even more liberal approach has been adopted by many
civil law countries where the arrestor is simply held liable for damages once
it is shown, without more, that the arrest was unjustified (see generally
Woodford’s article at 126–127).

_The rationale behind the_ Evangelismos _test_

123 Given the real, as well as perceived, problems of the _Evangelismos_ test,
what then is the rationale behind this strict rule that has withstood the test
of time in many Commonwealth countries? We note that the judgments that have
applied the _Evangelismos_ test have no, or hardly any, discussion of the
origin or rationale of the rule and have simply accepted the Rt Hon T
Pemberton Leigh’s hallowed passage in _The Evangelismos_ (see [113] above) as
correctly stating the law for time eternal. To begin with, it is unclear from
the very brief judgment of the Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh on what basis he
arrived at the formulation of the test. He, in fact, made no reference to any
authorities in his judgment, not even to the cases raised by counsel. However,
some light as to what he might have had in mind may perhaps be gleaned from
his discussion of the arguments for and against the award of damages in the
preceding paragraphs just before his famous passage (at 358–359; 948):

It is urged by the Appellant that damages ought also to have been awarded, as
the rule of the Admiralty Court is, that the party who has sustained injury
has a right to be indemnified. _On the other hand it is said that the arrest
of the ship, in this case, was the foundation of the action, and it is only
for the purpose of founding the action that the ship was arrested, and
therefore, the arrestment of the ship cannot be said to be an illegal or
improper act, except to the extent of bringing the action_. [emphasis added]

124 Indeed, at the time when _The Evangelismos_ was decided, _in rem_
proceedings were begun by warrant of arrest and the jurisdiction of the
admiralty court was properly invoked only upon the arrest of the ship (see
_The Volant_ ([114] _supra_); _Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice_ ([83]
_supra_) at para 4.26; see also Shane Nossal, “Damages for the wrongful arrest
of a vessel” [1996] LMCLQ 368 (“Nossal’s article”) at 376). Since the arrest
of the ship constituted the commencement of an action then, a high threshold
was required for wrongful arrest so as to protect plaintiffs who were unable
to prove their claims on a balance of probabilities from liability for
damages, and such liability would logically only arise in situations analogous
to malicious prosecution, where the action was commenced with malice and
without reasonable or probable cause (_ibid_); malice and no reasonable or
probable cause are, _inter alia_ , two essential elements of the tort of
malicious prosecution (see the decision of this court in _Zainal bin Kuning v
Chan Sin Mian Michael_ [1996] 3 SLR 121 at 137, [61]; W V H Rogers, _Winfield
and Jolowicz on Tort_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2006) at paras 19-2,
19-7–19-10; and Simon Deakin, Angus Johnston & Basil Markesinis, _Markesinis
and Deakin’s Tort Law_ (Clarendon Press, 6th Ed, 2008) at pp 475, 478–479). It
has thus been said that the origin of the admiralty action for wrongful arrest
is that of the common law action for malicious prosecution or that wrongful
arrest is closely associated with malicious prosecution (see _The Walter D
Wallet_ [1893] P 202 at 205–207; _The Ohm Mariana_ [1992] 2 SLR 623 at 637,
[48]; and David Chong Gek Sian, “Wrongful Arrest in Actions in Rem” [1990] 1
MLJ lxxiii at lxxiii).

125 However, it has often passed unnoticed that the enactment of the Supreme
Court of Judicature Act 1873 (c 66) (UK) and the Supreme Court of Judicature
in England changed the practice of commencing admiralty proceedings with the
introduction of the writ of summons. Since then, admiralty proceedings have
been commenced by the issue of an admiralty writ _in rem_ (now known as “ _in
rem_ claim forms” in England) and the jurisdiction of the admiralty court is
invoked by the service of that writ (see _Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice_
at para 4.26; and also Nossal’s article at 376). Given this fundamental change
in circumstances, _ie_ , that the historical reason for having a high
threshold test for wrongful arrest is now no longer valid, it has been
searchingly queried if the _Evangelismos_ test should still prevail, as
pointed out by Shane Nossal (_id_ at 376–377):

Although the right to arrest the _res_ “goes hand in hand” with the action
_in_ _rem_ , the functions of the writ and the warrant for arrest are distinct
and the two procedures do not have to be taken together to prosecute an action
_in_ _rem_. _Proceedings_ in rem _can continue, and judgment in default in an
action_ in rem _may be taken, without the arrest of the_ res _proceeded
against_.

_As a consequence of this development, the law ought not to perpetuate the now
false analogy between malicious prosecution and damages for wrongful arrest_.
If an action _in rem_ is wrongfully commenced, then the rights and liabilities
of the parties ought to be determined in accordance with principles of
malicious prosecution. However, the arrest of a vessel, a step irrelevant to
the commencement of the action _in rem_ and taken to obtain pre-judgment
security, is an interference with the property rights of the vessel’s owner.
If that arrest is wrongfully made, then the rights and liabilities of the
parties ought to be determined in accordance with principles more compatible
with the protection of property interests.

[emphasis added]

126 With this historical background in mind and in the light of the
legislative reforms undertaken by some other Commonwealth countries, it may be
rightly asked if the _Evangelismos_ test, which appears conceptually
anachronistic, should continue to be the governing rule for wrongful arrest in
Singapore. Should not a lower threshold be adopted instead? The test of
“reasonable or probable cause”, which was endorsed by G P Selvam JC in _The
Ohm Mariana_ has, in fact, been categorically rejected by Karthigesu JA, on
behalf of this court, in _The Kiku Pacific_ ([113] _supra_ at [27]–[30]), on
the (apparent) basis of the historic pedigree of the _Evangelismos_ test and
the need for international uniformity.

127 In _The Ohm Mariana_ , Selvam JC, relying on the decisions in _Mitchell v
Jenkins_ (1833) 5 B & Ad 588; 110 ER 908 and _The Walter D Wallet_ , and
noting that the cause of action for wrongful arrest was akin to that of
malicious prosecution or abuse of legal process in general, declared (at 637,
[49]) that:

The true basis of the claim [for wrongful arrest] … is, to use the common law
phrase, ‘without reasonable or probable cause’, and to use the admiralty
language ‘ _crassa negligentia_ or _mala fides_ ’.

Karthigesu JA pointed out in _The Kiku Pacific_ (at [29]) that Selvam JC’s
reliance on these two cases were misplaced given the differences in context
and that the importation of the term “reasonable or probable cause” would
cause confusion and, more importantly, dilute the threshold required for an
action in wrongful arrest to succeed. Interestingly, we note that Selvam JC
had imported “without reasonable or probable cause”, one of the required
elements of malicious prosecution, into the action for wrongful arrest, but
not the other element of malice (see [124] above). He appeared to take the
view that the phrase “without reasonable or probable cause” would also
encompass _crassa negligentia_ or _mala fides_ in the admiralty context (see
his quoted sentence above). Nevertheless, Selvam JC had also referred to the
Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh’s famous passage in _The Evangelismos_ approvingly
(at 636, [44]) and nowhere in his judgment did he hint that the threshold set
by the _Evangelismos_ test was too high. The award of damages in _The Ohm
Mariana_ for wrongful arrest was also based on Selvam JC’s finding that there
was malice on the part of the plaintiffs (at 637, [53]). As such, in our
opinion, it is doubtful if Selvam JC had, in the first place, intended to lay
down a less stringent test in _The Ohm Mariana_ based on without reasonable or
probable cause, identical to that adopted in Australia or South Africa. That
aside, we note that counsel for FESCO, Mr Steven Chong SC, has not attempted
to argue before us that the present high threshold set by the _Evangelismos_
test has been problematic for the ship-owning community.

128 As pointed out earlier, the criterion in the _Evangelismos_ test (see
[113] and [115] above) is not an easy standard to satisfy, bearing in mind
that the historical basis for this test appears to be the common law doctrine
underpinning malicious prosecutions, which pre-dated the evolution of the tort
of negligence. The high threshold also means that sometimes, even weak claims
can be brazenly pursued by claimants arresting a vessel without fearing any
serious financial repercussions arising from a wrongful arrest. The claimant,
so long as it has an “honest” belief, faces no jeopardy even if it is plainly
negligent. While we agree that plausible claims should not be stifled, it is
clearly not desirable in the wider public interest that really implausible
claims be allowed to be indiscriminately mounted with impunity. Litigants and
their solicitors have an overriding responsibility to the courts not to pursue
draconian remedies like Anton Pillar orders, Mareva injunctions and ship
arrests, unless they honestly believe with good reason that they have
plausible claims.

129 In fact, the similarity between admiralty arrest and the relief provided
by Mareva injunctions was noted by Heald JA at the Federal Court of Appeal in
the Canadian case of _Armada Lines Ltd v Chaleur Fertilizers Ltd_ [1995] 1 FC
3 at 20, where he commented that “[i]n each instance, the onus is undoubtedly
cast upon the plaintiff to show that the arrest requested is necessary for the
protection of its rights”. Although there was no express requirement in the
relevant Canadian rules that an undertaking in damages be given for arrest of
vessels unlike for Mareva injunctions, Heald JA was of the view that damages
for wrongful arrest would be available on the same basis that damages would be
available in the case of an improper Mareva injunction being obtained and held
that it was a “necessary inference” that the plaintiff, who seeks the arrest,
must carry the risk and burden of an illegal arrest, and the consequences
flowing therefrom (at 19–20) (see also the case note by Robert Margolis,
“Damages for the Wrongful Arrest of a Vessel: The Venerable Rule Confirmed”
[1998] LMCLQ 11 (“Margolis’ case note”) at 12). The Supreme Court of Canada,
however, reversed the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision to award damages to
the shipowner in _Armada Lines Ltd_ ([118] _supra_), given that there was an
absence of bad faith or gross negligence below. The Supreme Court did not
accept (but not without sympathy) the respondent’s argument for an award of
damages based on the similarities between the maritime arrest procedure and
the seizure of assets pursuant to a Mareva injunction for the ultimate reason
that “the common law only imposes liability for damages flowing from the
arrest of property if the plaintiff acted with either _mala fides_ or _crassa
negligentia_ ” (_Armada Lines Ltd_ at [24]). However, Iacobucci J, delivering
the judgment of the Supreme Court, did not deny that the two were, in fact,
substantively similar (at [23]):

In asking this Court to depart from the _Evangelismos_ rule, the respondent
focused on the similarities between the maritime arrest procedure, on the one
hand, and the seizure of assets pursuant to a _Mareva_ injunction, on the
other. _And, indeed, in substance, the two orders are not dissimilar: both the
admiralty arrest and the_ Mareva _injunction restrain a defendant from dealing
with his or her property prior to judgment_. [emphasis added]

130 The ALRC, in its report, has also commented that a less onerous test based
on reasonability and existence of a good cause will “[strike] a fairer balance
between plaintiff and defendant” and “[conform] to the principles upon which
Mareva injunctions are granted”, given that “[a] central concern in the
development of such injunctions as a remedial device has been to strike an
equitable balance between the interests of the plaintiff and defendant”
(ALRC’s report ([121] _supra_) at para 302). Admittedly, Mareva injunctions
and ship arrests differ in some respects (see _Admiralty Jurisdiction and
Practice_ ([83] _supra_) at para 1.53; and the Supreme Court of Canada’s
judgment in _Armada Lines Ltd_ at [23]–[24]), but undeniably, they both serve
the same ultimate purpose (as pointed out by Iacobucci J) of restraining a
defendant from dealing with his or her property before judgment is given. It
seems to us only logical that the law should incline in future towards a
common test for damages arising from the wrongful solicitation of any _ex
parte_ peremptory remedy. For now, however, the ship arrest cases stand alone
as a separate category.

131 Despite the conceptual difficulties and criticism of the _Evangelismos_
test, it may, on the other hand, arguably be said to serve a wider economic or
policy purpose. It has been noted by a writer that cargo claimants face new
difficulties these days in “trying to bring their actions in a convenient,
that is local, forum, given the prevalence of exclusive jurisdiction clauses
expressly contained in bills of lading or incorporated by reference therein”
(Margolis’ case note at 14). A reasonably high threshold for wrongful arrest
is thus arguably justified on the basis that aggrieved claimants require
friendly forums to initiate actions. Additionally, shipping is inherently
international in nature, and international comity (in the area of admiralty
law) may be another factor why the _Evangelismos_ test should be maintained,
though this reason may be increasingly harder to defend given that some
Commonwealth countries have already departed from the test, and many of the
civil law countries, to begin with, always had a much lower threshold test for
wrongful arrest. Practically speaking, although the admiralty jurisdiction of
the court now can be invoked without an arrest being made, the arrest of the
ship provides security for the claim which cannot be defeated by insolvency
and makes it exclusively available only to maritime claims (_Admiralty
Jurisdiction and Practice_ at paras 1.53 and 4.28; _Admiralty Law and
Practice_ ([39] _supra_) at p 163). An unexpected arrest is undeniably the
most effective means of requiring a shipowner to furnish some other type of
security to ensure the swift release of its vessel. In today’s modern world,
with the advent of marine insurance and P&I clubs, there is usually no
difficulty furnishing some other form of security, such as a letter of
undertaking from a P&I club to secure the release of one’s vessel. In fact, it
seems more often than not in practice that the mere threat of an arrest will
be sufficient to invoke the owners of the ship threatened with arrest into
providing a voluntary security, and no actual arrest usually takes place after
that (_Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice_ at para 4.27).

132 At the end of the day, the formulation of an appropriate benchmark boils
down to trying to strike a fair balance between shipowners on the one hand,
and the potential maritime claimants on the other. We note that in the
Commonwealth countries that have departed from the _Evangelismos_ test (see
[121]–[122] above), the reforms have all been brought about by the legislature
and not the courts. In _Armada Lines Ltd_ , Iacobucci J, delivering the
judgment of the Canadian Supreme Court, acknowledged that the _Evangelismos_
test could be out of step with modern developments in the common law, but
declined to depart from it. He was of the view that any change to the law
should be brought by the legislature and not the courts (at [26]–[27]):

_[I]n my view, any such change in the law falls not to the courts, but rather
to the legislature to carry out_. As noted above, the rule in _The
“Evangelismos”_ is of long standing. _Whether it does or does not operate
harshly upon defendants is a question best resolved by the legislature_. As
this Court said in _Rhône (The) v. Peter A.B. Widener (The)_ , [1993] 1 S.C.R.
497, at p. 531:

... whether this regime is responsive to modern realities is a question of
policy to be determined by Parliament and not the courts whose task is to
interpret and give effect to the intention of Parliament.

In this regard, I note that, apparently alone among the common law
jurisdictions, Australia has departed from the rule in _The “Evangelismos”_.
Section 34(1)(a)(ii) of the Australian _Admiralty Act 1988_ , No. 34 of 1988,
provides that a party may recover damages arising out of the arrest of
property if the arrest was obtained “unreasonably and without good cause”. As
pointed out by counsel for the appellant, this change was effected not through
judicial means, but rather by specific legislative enactment. _In my opinion,
any analogous change in Canadian law must originate in the legislative branch
of government_. For these reasons, in my view, the rule in _The
“Evangelismos”_ remains good law in Canada.

[emphasis added]

133 Likewise, in New Zealand, Giles J in _Mobil Oil New Zealand Ltd_ ([118]
_supra_), expressed the view that it would be for the legislature to rebalance
the odds which disproportionately favour the plaintiffs (at 65):

In my view, the situation is rather unsatisfactory for ship-owning or
chartering interests. In this jurisdiction, unlike our Australian
counterparts, a plaintiff arresting a ship has little real vulnerability for
the economic consequences visited upon an owner. Damages for wrongful arrest
may only be recovered where the arrest has been procured with malice. … The
situation for an owner is not so bleak in Australia where, as noted, the
federal admiralty legislation imposes a liability for damages for unreasonable
arrest on parties procuring the arrest of a ship. The test of unreasonableness
is a much lesser burden than the test of malice. _In my view, a case can be
made out for a legislative rebalancing of odds which disproportionately favour
plaintiffs in this jurisdiction_.

In making these observations I acknowledge that our jurisdiction is modelled
on the English system which has an ancient heritage. Arrest has always been a
very powerful remedy recognised in most jurisdictions – malice is the
measurement of English law in wrongful arrest actions. The need for
international consistency is, as McGechan J observes in the _Samarkand_
[_Baltic Shipping Co Ltd v Pegasus Lines SA_ [1996] 3 NZLR 641], deserving of
consideration. But, in my view, we ought not to allow that factor to deter
reform where the interests of justice so require.

[emphasis added]

134 We would agree with the views of both Iacobucci J and Giles J to the
extent that the _Evangelismos_ test is long-standing, and should not be
departed from lightly, without good reasons and due consideration. However, it
is always open to this court to depart from this judicially-created test if
the day comes when it no longer serves any relevant purpose. Having examined
the genesis of the _Evangelismos_ test and its current application in
Singapore, we shall for now leave this issue to be addressed more fully at a
more appropriate juncture. We are prepared to reconsider the continuing
relevance and applicability of the _Evangelismos_ test when we have had the
benefit of full argument from counsel as well as the submissions of other
interested stakeholders in the maritime community in the form of Brandeis
briefs. For the present appeal, as will be demonstrated shortly, the outcome
reached by this court would nonetheless be the same whether the _Evangelismos_
test or a less onerous test is applied.

_The proper application of the_ Evangelismos _test_

135 Before we elaborate on what we think should be the right and proper
application of the _Evangelismos_ test, we note briefly that, notwithstanding
the high threshold set by the test, there have been quite a few instances in
Singapore in recent times where it has been demonstrated that, in appropriate
circumstances, the local courts would not be slow to find wrongful arrest and
to award damages on the _Evangelismos_ test (see _Admiralty Law and Practice_
([39] _supra_), at p 185, fn 240; see also _The Trade Resolve_ [1999] 4 SLR
424; _The Dilmun Fulmar_ [2004] 1 SLR 140; _The AA V_ ([84] _supra_); _The
Inai Selasih_ [2005] 4 SLR 1). Two examples will suffice to illustrate this
point:

(a) In _The Dilmun Fulmar_ , the court awarded damages for wrongful arrest on
the basis that the arrest was effected without an honest belief that the
arrest was legitimate. In that case, the plaintiffs arrested the vessel for
unpaid repairs. Subsequently, the plaintiffs reached a settlement with the
shipowner under which the shipowner agreed to pay for the repairs in
instalments. On the basis of the settlement agreement, the vessel was released
from arrest. The shipowner later defaulted on the instalment payments. The
plaintiffs then re-arrested the vessel on the basis of the original claim. The
court held that the writ and second warrant of arrest did not reflect the true
cause of action which was to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement (at
[14]). The arrest in such circumstances was _mala fide_ and an abuse of
process because the original cause of action had been superseded by the
settlement agreement.

(b) Damages for wrongful arrest can also be awarded if the plaintiff’s non-
disclosure of material facts is found to be deliberate or malicious. In _The
AA V_ , the plaintiffs supplied the defendants’ tug with marine gas oil. The
plaintiffs claimed for the balance of the price of the supply and arrested the
tug. The defendants applied to have the writ struck out and the arrest set
aside, and claimed damages for wrongful arrest. The assistant registrar who
heard the application struck the writ out and set aside the arrest. Damages,
however, were not awarded. On appeal, Prakash J held, _inter alia_ , that the
plaintiffs’ non-disclosure of material facts was intentional and malicious, or
at the very least, grossly negligent. They had recklessly arrested the tug
without ascertaining whether the defendants were in fact contractually liable
to pay for the marine gas oil. The plaintiffs had also left out relevant
material when they secured the arrest of the defendants’ tug. This information
had not been disclosed to the court “so that a proper assessment of the
correctness of their claim could be made. Instead, they deliberately chose to
leave out all information which would have caused doubt as to whether the
defendants were the persons who would be liable in an action in personam” (at
[50]). On that basis, the court awarded damages to the defendants for the
wrongful arrest of their tug.

136 Reverting to the proper application of the _Evangelismos_ test, we note
that in many of the cases that have applied the test, the courts have always
placed emphasis on the first part of the Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh’s famous
passage at 359 (_ie_ , “[u]ndoubtedly there _may_ be cases in which there is
either _mala fides_ , or that _crassa negligentia_ , which implies malice,
which would justify a Court of Admiralty giving damages, as in an action
brought at Common law damages may be obtained” [emphasis added]), focusing on
the words _mala fides_ and _crassa negligentia_ (see also Nossal’s article
([124] _supra_) at 369–370). A plain reading of that part merely suggests that
he was of the view that, in cases involving _mala fides_ or _crassa
negligentia_ , damages would naturally be awarded, especially given that he
had used the word “may” at the start of the statement. It appears that the
real focus of the test (if any) he had in mind is that found in the second
part of his passage which begins with the opening words “[t]he _real question_
in this case … comes to this” [emphasis added], _viz_ , whether “the action
was so unwarrantably brought, or brought with so little colour, or so little
foundation” that it implies malice or gross negligence on the plaintiff’s
part.

137 In most cases, the fact that the _in rem_ action (together with the
arrest) was “so unwarrantably brought, or brought with so little colour, or so
little foundation” would probably mean that there has been _mala fides_ or
_crassa negligentia_ on the part of the plaintiff. The two may perhaps be said
to be plainly apparent in most cases where the facts are clear, but we are of
the view that where the focus or emphasis lies during the inquiry may prove to
be determinative in other more difficult cases where it is hard to put a
finger as to whether there is or there is no _mala fides_ or _crassa
negligentia_ on the part of the plaintiff, but where it is clear that the
arrest was wholly unwarranted in the circumstances at the time when the arrest
was sought. Focusing on the first part of the passage (see [136] above) would
mean that the inquiry would be both an objective and a subjective one into the
plaintiff’s state of mind at the time of the arrest as there would be a need
to establish if the plaintiff had a genuine and honest belief that the arrest
was legitimate then. On the other hand, if the focus is on the second part of
the passage, this would mean a more objective inquiry into the circumstances
prevailing and the evidence available at the time of the arrest, so as to
determine if the action and the arrest were so unwarrantably brought, or
brought with so little colour, or so little foundation, as to imply that they
were brought with malice or gross negligence. The answer to this question may
also, depending on the facts of the case, lead to an objective finding of the
subjective intention of the plaintiff at the time of the arrest. In situations
involving the more difficult cases as mentioned above, this approach could
prove determinative as to whether damages should be awarded to the shipowner.
In our view, this is indeed the correct approach, and the inquiry of wrongful
arrest should be focused on the question of whether the action and the arrest
were so unwarrantably brought, or brought with so little colour, or so little
foundation, as to imply malice or gross negligence on the plaintiff’s part.

138 However, it should also always be borne in mind that the decision to award
damages for wrongful arrest should never be lightly made. In _The Inai
Selasih_ ([135] _supra_), Chao Hick Tin JA had quite rightly cautioned at [32]
that just because a plaintiff had been wrong in its interpretation or
perception of events, it did not follow as a matter of fact that there was a
lack of an honest belief and that the court should award damages. As
mentioned, in assessing the facts, the courts must consider first and foremost
whether the action and the arrest were brought “unwarrantably” or with “little
colour” or with “little foundation”. This may include situations where there
may be material non-disclosure in the affidavit in support of the warrant of
arrest (see _The AA V_ ([84] _supra_)), and where the writ of summons does not
disclose a reasonable cause of action (see _The Cathcart_ ([114] _supra_);
_The Dilmun Fulmar_ ([135] _supra_)). Further, the _Evangelismos_ test calls
for the objective assessment of the subjective intention of the arresting
party, and this is to be objectively determined by reference to all the
material facts (see [137] above).

**_Whether damages for wrongful arrest should be awarded to FESCO_**

139 Reverting to the case at hand, in assessing the viability of the grounds
underpinning the issuance of the warrant of arrest, both AR Ang and the Judge
concluded that the Banks had honestly believed that they had valid claims
against FESCO which had not been protected in the course of the proceedings in
Lomé. As such, they should not be required to pay damages for wrongful arrest.
The Judge observed at [75]–[76] of the Judge’s GD:

FESCO contended that an inquiry as to whether the banks ought to be ordered to
pay damages for wrongful arrest might begin with their pleaded cause of
action, which was premised on the assertion that FESCO was in breach of
contract in proceeding to Lome and discharging the cargo there despite
instructions from them to discharge the said cargo at Douala. _However, AR Ang
found that, as the banks had honestly believed that they had valid claims
against FESCO that had not been protected at Lome, they should not be required
to pay damages for wrongful arrest_. She pointed out that in _The Inai
Selasih_ , Chao Hick Tin JA had noted at [32] that where an applicant has been
wrong in its interpretation or perception of arrangements, it does not follow
that there is malice. As for non-disclosure of material facts, which can lead
to an award of damages for wrongful arrest if it was intentional or malicious,
a point reiterated in _The AA V_ [2001] 1 SLR 207, _AR Ang found that the
banks’ non-disclosure in the present case was neither deliberate nor
calculated at misleading or distorting the truth_.

I accept AR Ang’s reasoning and saw no reason why she should be overruled on
the issue of damages for wrongful arrest. As such, the appeal against her
refusal to order damages for wrongful arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ in RA
No 216/2006 is dismissed.

[emphasis added]

140 In our view, both the Judge and AR Ang erred in concluding that wrongful
damages could only be recovered if the non-disclosure was either deliberate or
calculated to mislead. This is not quite correct. In our view, if material
facts are not disclosed because of gross negligence or recklessness, damages
for wrongful arrest may also be recovered. Further, it appears that the lower
courts had entirely failed to factor in the considerations that the claim for
the alleged failure to comply with the Banks’ instructions was an abuse of
process because there was no cause of action and, in any event, issue estoppel
prevented this matter from being relitigated.

141 We have, after careful consideration, also taken a contrary view of the
proper inferences to be drawn from the prevailing circumstances. On the facts,
we are satisfied that the _Evangelismos_ test has been satisfied. After
examining the relevant documents and assessing Crédit Agricole’s conduct, we
conclude that there are at least three good reasons why the Banks’ _in rem_
claim and the arrest of the ship should be viewed as having been initiated “so
unwarrantably” or with “so little foundation”, that, in the present
circumstances, they amounted, at the very least, to _crassa negligentia_.
First, Crédit Agricole unreasonably persisted in arresting the sister ship of
the chartered vessel in Singapore after its claim had been disposed of in
Lomé, notwithstanding that the Lomé court had already ruled that sufficient
security had been provided for the loss and damage to its cargo claims.
Second, the breach of contract claim, as we have pointed our earlier, is
entirely without substance or, indeed, any foundation whatsoever. Third, the
Banks failed to disclose material facts in the _ex parte_ hearing before AR
Lee. It appears clear to us that the Banks’ conduct in initiating the arrest
could not, after taking account all the circumstances, be fairly said to be
the result of an honest belief that they had valid claims, but rather arose
from an ill-conceived and reckless attempt to steal a march on FESCO and to
force its hand in providing additional security for their claims. If the Banks
felt that the security provided was insufficient, the Banks ought, in the
prevailing circumstances, to have appealed this issue in Lomé rather than to
open up a second, costly and inherently vexatious, front in Singapore. It is
necessary to now assess in further detail the Banks’ conduct in respect of
each of these issues. We shall begin by dealing with the first and second
reasons above under the rubric, “absence of any reasonable basis”.

_Absence of any reasonable basis_

142 The Banks assert that they were entitled to arrest the _Vasiliy Golovnin_
as they required further security for their claim arising from the loss of and
damage to the cargo. However, the Lomé court had previously assessed that
sufficient security had already been given for the claims in relation to the
loss of and damage of the cargo by the UK P&I Club’s letter of undertaking
dated 16 February 2006. The Banks now complain that the undertaking to pay not
more than €113,411.00 was, however, only addressed to the cargo
underwriters.[note: 15] One might quite rightly ask: If this was indeed the
essence of their grievance, why was it not drawn to the attention of AR Lee?
FESCO also pointed out that, in any event, the Banks were not disadvantaged by
this, as any loss resulting from cargo damage would first be claimed by the
Banks against the cargo insurers in any event. What is, at the end of the day,
pertinent to us is that the sufficiency of the security for the damaged and
missing cargo had not been challenged in the original forum of this dispute,
the Togolese courts.

143 Why then did the Banks proceed to arrest the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ in
Singapore? We can only objectively surmise that they did this because they
were dissatisfied with the Lomé decision, and/or the security provided. We
note that in their “Request for Arrest of Ship” addressed to “The President of
the Court of First Instance in Lomé” dated 21 February 2006, the Banks
estimated their losses at US$5,050,000.[note: 16] This, conceivably, must have
included their alleged losses arising from FESCO’s purported failure to comply
with their directions.

144 In our view, these objectives were wholly misconceived and an unreasonable
basis on which to ground the arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ in Singapore.
First, their original claims for relief had already been dismissed by the Lomé
court, and further, the Lomé court appeared to have concluded that adequate
security had already been provided for the claims arising from the loss of and
damage to the cargo. Instead of appealing against the adverse decision of the
Lomé court, the Banks abandoned their case against FESCO in Togo while
pursuing their appeal against STC (see [21] above). The Banks then not only
proceeded to arrest a sister vessel, but did so in an altogether different
jurisdiction. The Banks now assert that they did not appeal against the Lomé
Release Order as the chartered vessel had departed from Lomé immediately after
the Lomé Release Order was made. Admittedly, the Banks may not have known
where the chartered vessel would call next or whether she would return to Lomé
and, in such an event, whether the order would be enforceable. This does not,
however, exonerate the Banks. If this was indeed correct, we are minded to
conclude that the Banks’ persistence and impetuousness in arresting the ship
here was precipitated by an ill-considered impulse to rectify their omission
in failing to take adequate steps to fortify and/or enhance the security
obtained in Lomé. There is no gainsaying, however, that the Banks had, it
appears from the established facts, ample time and opportunity to address any
shortcomings. The Banks could have, without any evident difficulty, applied
for a stay of the Lomé Release Order and/or even appealed against it.

145 We also take into account that the Judge was highly critical of the Banks’
conduct. He concluded that the arrest was an _abuse of process_. In arriving
at this view, he found that the parties’ arguments on the merits of the case
had already been considered by the Togolese court when the arrest of the
chartered vessel was set aside on 24 February 2006, _ie_ , when the court made
the Lomé Release Order. He also noted (at [48] of the Judge’s GD), correctly,
we may add, that it was highly pertinent:

… that the parties’ arguments on the merits of the case had been considered by
the Togolese court. In fact, when setting aside the arrest and ordering the
banks to pay costs, the Lome court made the following findings:

(a) The banks could not deal directly with FESCO without going through Rustal
and STC, and FESCO could only follow STC’s instructions since Lome was
stipulated as the port of discharge in a number of the bills of lading.

(b) FESCO had not been at fault in proceeding to Lome on STC’s instructions
since STC had control over the commercial management of the _Chelyabinsk_ as
charterers.

(c) Douala was not listed as a port of discharge on the bills of lading
although the banks claimed that the cargo was bound for Douala.

(d) Sufficient security had been given for the claims for loss and damage to
the cargo.

(See also AR Ang’s GD at [16]). It seems to us, like the salvors in _The
Margaret Jane_ ([114] _supra_), the Banks, following the ruling of the Lomé
court, must have been aware that they simply had no basis to arrest the
_Vasiliy Golovnin_ in Singapore. Sufficient security had already been provided
for the claim for loss of and damage to the cargo, and the claim for breach of
contract for failing to comply with their directions in relation to the
discharge of the cargo had been adjudged by the Lomé court to be
unmeritorious. We too have also found earlier that the breach of contract
claim is not sustainable in the circumstances (see [71]–[77] above). Quite
clearly, the _in rem_ claim here and the arrest were brought unwarrantably and
without foundation by the Banks. In the given circumstances, we are of the
further opinion that the Banks must be aware that their claim of US$5,050,000,
which allegedly included their losses arising from FESCO’s purported failure
to comply with their directions, was unsustainable, and by insisting on
procuring an arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ in Singapore, they have acted
without any proper regard as to whether there were adequate grounds for the
arrest. They can be said to be guilty of _crassa negligentia_ (see _Gulf Azov
Shipping_ ([116] _supra_)).

146 To sum up, as we pointed out earlier at [19] above, there was no appeal by
the Banks to the Togolese Court of Appeal. Like the Judge, we have also
concluded that the _in rem_ claim should be struck out as there is no
foundation whatsoever for it to be pursued (see [5] above). In short, we rule
that no reasonable litigant ought to or would have pursued the subject _in
rem_ claim in the prevailing circumstances. The present matter is quite unlike
a case like _The Inai Selasih_ ([135] _supra_) where the arresting party was
merely “wrong in its interpretation or perception of the entire arrangement”
(at [32]). Here, there was no foundation whatsoever. We also find it germane
that, in that matter, the court found that there had been full disclosure of
the material documentation, which, regrettably, is not the case here.

_Material non-disclosure_

147 We have noted earlier that Crédit Agricole had failed to disclose at least
two material facts to AR Lee. We also found Crédit Agricole’s proffered
reasons for non-disclosure dubious and formed the view that these two facts
were not disclosed, if not deliberately, then certainly because of a patent
(and inexcusable) lack of care in assessing what material facts ought to be
disclosed. The Banks did not use the words “switch” or “split” at all in their
affidavit in support of the arrest. Instead, they claimed that the bills of
lading were “re-cut” because the cargo had to be discharged at different
ports.[note: 17] While we are reluctant to ascribe improper motives to the
Banks and/or their solicitors, it seems to us that the materiality of the
events in Lomé and the aborted switch are so plainly relevant that no fair-
minded and diligent litigant would have even momentarily considered not fully
disclosing them. The Banks’ decision to be factually economical may fairly be
said to be _suppressio veri, suggestio falsi_. The non-disclosure of these
material facts cannot now be airily brushed aside as a mere slip between the
cup and the lip. In our view, these facts were clearly material for the _ex
parte_ hearing before AR Lee and, if disclosed, would have, in all likelihood,
led to an altogether different outcome of the arrest application. As such, we
feel, in all circumstances, it is correct to characterise the conduct of the
Banks as being more than regrettable and much less than diligent; in short,
_grossly negligent_ or even reckless.

_Synopsis_

148 We accept FESCO’s submissions that by the time the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ was
arrested in Singapore, the Banks had already fully participated in the
Togolese court’s assessment on the merits of their claim for security. The
Banks were also aware that the Togolese court had specifically declared that
adequate security had already been provided by the UK P&I Club for their claim
for damage to the cargo and the missing cargo. Despite this, the Banks not
only initiated arrest proceedings in Singapore, but also inexplicably omitted
to mention these crucial facts. We do not accept the Banks’ contention that
they had an honest belief in their alleged claim or right to arrest the
_Vasiliy Golovnin_ in Singapore. No reasonably diligent litigant could have
ever come to such a conclusion in these circumstances. The Banks’ claims
against FESCO for failing to comply with their instructions to discharge the
cargo at a port other than Lomé were, politely put, absurd. Even Ms Ang had to
acknowledge that some of her key legal planks were “novel”.[note: 18] We need
say no more.

149 The Judge has also pertinently pointed out at [70] of the Judge’s GD that:

The Lome court found, rightly or wrongly, that sufficient security had been
furnished for this claim. … [T]his finding _prevents_ the banks from arresting
the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ to obtain security for the claim with respect to damage
to cargo. [emphasis added]

This is plainly a case where the arrest was so plainly an abuse of process
that no reasonable litigant would have even begun contemplating, let alone
executing, such a process. It has not passed unnoticed by us that the holder
of the other two bills of lading with respect to the Chinese rice for
discharge at “any African port” declined to initiate proceedings against FESCO
in Singapore after initially participating in the Lomé proceedings (see [10]
above). In invoking such a drastic remedy such as the arrest of a vessel,
there is invariably a need for an honest belief in the legitimacy of the
arrest. The fact that legal advice has been sought, as is invariably the case,
will assuredly not immunise the decision from scrutiny as to whether it has
been made improperly.

150 The sagacious observations of Dr Lushington, one of the most astute
English admiralty judges, in _The Cathcart_ ([114] _supra_ at 333) remain
highly instructive even today and are of particularly pertinence to this
appeal:

_The plaintiffs had full knowledge of the facts, and must be held to the legal
effect of their own engagements. If they had regarded the terms of those
engagements, they would have known they had no right to arrest the vessel. Add
to this, the arrest of the vessel by the plaintiffs was made on the eve of
commencing a profitable voyage, and after a decision of the magistrate adverse
to their claim_ , and the plaintiffs have attempted to support the proceeding
by making charges of fraud against the defendant, which they have quite failed
to prove. I think this is a case for damages. I therefore order the release of
this vessel, and condemn the plaintiffs in costs and damages; the amount of
damages to be estimated in the usual way, by the registrar and merchants.
[emphasis added]

The Banks’ conduct in effecting the further arrest in Singapore of the
chartered vessel’s sister ship was patently misconceived and shabbily
executed. AR Lee was lulled into ordering the arrest because the Banks
appeared to have decided that it was more important to promptly secure an
arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_ than to be candid with the court. The truth
of the matter is that the chartered vessel and FESCO were no more than
innocent bystanders in the Togolese tug of war between the Banks, STC and
Rustal. Whether STC had the right to detain the cargo was, strictly speaking,
a matter entirely between the Banks and Rustal on the one hand and STC on the
other.

151 The Banks knew this and ought not to have involved FESCO’s vessels in
their intractable legal wrangling with the other parties. The Togolese court
had already ruled, and we respectfully concur, that “one cannot reproach FESCO
for committing any wrong” in routing the chartered vessel to Lomé on the
specific orders of the charterer.[note: 19] For the reasons above, we are, all
said and done, satisfied that the Banks acted altogether inappropriately in
arresting the _Vasiliy Golovnin_. This is not just a case of an applicant
failing to apply its mind to the legitimacy of its course of conduct. This is
a case of a claimant wilfully disregarding the plain stark adverse facts. A
groundless claim was pursued. Material facts were omitted. A draconian remedy
was recklessly sought. There can be no gainsaying, in the final analysis, that
the Banks’ _in rem_ claim and the arrest of the ship were brought
unwarrantably and without foundation. Unlike the lower courts, we are of the
firm view that the Banks cannot be said to have entertained an honest belief
that they had valid claims warranting the arrest of the subject vessel in
Singapore. The Banks now have to accept the painful consequences of having
abused the judicial process. For the reasons above, we allow FESCO’s appeal in
CA 110/2007 and order damages against the Banks to be assessed.

**Conclusion**

152 Crédit Agricole’s appeal is dismissed. We allow FESCO’s claim for damages
arising from the wrongful arrest of the _Vasiliy Golovnin_. FESCO is entitled
to the costs of both appeals as well as all the costs below in full. The usual
consequential directions are to be observed.
