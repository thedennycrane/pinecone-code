** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The plaintiff applied by this originating summons for an order that a
caveat lodged against the plaintiff’s property at 79 Farrer Drive #13-04
Sommerville Park by the defendant be removed. The defendant countered with a
summons-in-chambers for a stay of the originating summons pending trial of
Suit 798 of 2002, or alternatively, for the originating summons to be heard
with that suit. The trial of Suit 798 of 2002 has been scheduled to commence
in two months’ time.

2\. The background facts are as follows. The plaintiff had contracted to
supply logs from Indonesia to the defendant. The defendant subsequently
entered into a contract to sell the logs to a third party. The plaintiff then
informed the defendant that by reason of a ban imposed by the Indonesian
government the plaintiff was unable to fulfil his obligations to the
defendant.

3\. Undeterred, the defendant prevailed upon the plaintiff to make further
efforts to deliver the logs. It was then agreed that the defendant should
advance a sum of US$150,000 (approximately S$270,000) to the plaintiff. The
purpose of this advance is disputed and will be an issue in the trial of Suit
798 of 2002\. The plaintiff says that it was money intended to "pay off key
officials" so that the logs can be shipped out. The defendant denies this and
claims that the money was intended to be used to make legitimate payments.

4\. In any event, the plaintiff did eventually obtain an advance of US$270,000
from the defendant. There is an issue concerning the payment of interest and
whether the advance was illegal or otherwise in breach of the Moneylenders
Act. That issue would also be a matter for the trial of Suit 798 of 2002.

5\. The advance was partially made, that is, a sum of S$90,000, on 24 December
2001. The plaintiff asked for the balance of S$180,000 on 28 December 2001.
The defendant’s representatives then asked for security before the balance
would be released. Consequently, an option to purchase in respect of the said
property was prepared and signed. It appears that the option was prepared by
the defendant’s then solicitors but this does not seem to be a material fact
for present purposes although it may be in the trial of Suit 798 of 2002. The
S$180,000 was paid upon the plaintiff signing the option on 28 December 2001.
The plaintiff subsequently contended that the option was a sham, partly
because he says that the normal option fee is 1% of the purchase price but in
this case it was almost 23%. Furthermore, the purchase price was well below
market valuation. Various other factors were raised in support of this
contention.

6\. However, despite the payment of S$270,000, the plaintiff was unable to
secure the logs. The defendants was told that more funds were required but the
defendant did not provide any more money and the logs were eventually sold and
released to some other party who provided the money.

7\. The defendant then exercised the option on 10 May 2002. The plaintiff
instructed their solicitors to write to the defendant a long letter dated 5
June 2002 stating that he considers the option to be a sham and was null and
void by reason, _inter alia_ , of illegality under the Moneylenders’ Act. The
defendant was asked to remove the caveat against the property.

8\. The defendant instead commenced Suit 798 of 2002 on 5 July 2002. The
plaintiff applied to remove the caveat on the basis that it was an independent
issue from the matters raised in the suit. The application was made under s
127 of the Land Titles Act, Ch 157 which provides as follows:-

> > "127.—(1) At any time after the lodgment of a caveat, the caveatee may
> summon the caveator to attend before the court to show cause why the caveat
> should not be withdrawn or otherwise removed, and the court may make such
> order, either ex parte or otherwise, as seems just."

9\. Mr Appoo, counsel for the plaintiff, submitted before me that the
defendant had lost its caveatable interest because it had accepted the
plaintiff’s breach of contract and elected to seek payment of the sum of
S$270,000 instead of specific performance. Counsel drew my attention to 8 of
the defendant’s solicitors’ letter of 12 June 2002 in reply to the plaintiff’s
solicitors’ letter of 5 June 2002. The said 8 reads as follows:

> > "In respect of the advance and the security obtained by our clients over
> your clients’ property, our instructions are to demand for the payment of
> the sum of $270,000 within the next 7 days. _Upon the receipt of these
> monies, our clients will withdraw the caveat_ ". (my emphasis)

10\. I agree with Mr Wong for the defendant that this originating summons
should be heard together with Suit 798 of 2002\. That s 127(1) of the Land
Titles Act has been likened to a statutory injunction of an interlocutory
nature can be traced to the judgment of Lord Diplock in _Eng Mee Yong v
Letchumanan_[1979] 2 MLJ 212 and that had since been followed by the Court of
Appeal in _Sim Kwang Mui Ivy v Goh Peng Khim_ [1995] 1 SLR 186.

11\. I agree entirely with Mr Wong that the balance of convenience lay in
allowing the caveat to remain. First, there is no prejudice to the plaintiff
if it is to remain. If there were, none had been drawn to my attention.
Secondly, the trial of Suit 798 of 2002 is only two months away. There are two
other grounds why the application should not be allowed at this stage. First,
the election that Mr Appoo says the defendant had made through its solicitors
was a qualified one and whether it amounts to an election is a triable issue.
I have already emphasized the relevant portion of the alleged elections above.
The effect of that paragraph is best left to the trial judge who will have a
fuller and clearer view of the facts after evidence is led. Furthermore, if
the caveat is removed now, the defendant may be left with a paper judgment
should it succeed in Suit 798 of 2002. The balance of convenience is clearly
in favour of the defendant. Mr Appoo submitted that there is no issue of a
balancing of convenience because there is no serious issue to be tried. I do
not think that that is right. On the contrary, there is a very serious issue
to be tried. The defendant had exercised an option for sale. The plaintiff is
challenging that on the ground that the option was illegal and void. That is a
serious, primary issue. There is also a serious secondary issue, namely,
whether the defendant had accepted the plaintiff’s repudiation and elected to
forfeit its rights under the option. All these issues are intricately co-
related. It will be unfair to release the caveat before these issues are
addressed; and the proper place to address them is at trial.

12\. I note the strenuous contentions by Mr Appoo that the defendant has no
chance of success, but his assertions depend on important assumptions of fact
which can only be established at trial. For instance, whether there was an
illegal transaction or not is clearly a matter of fact that is hotly in
dispute. Reading the email sent by the plaintiff to the defendant’s Lewis Lim
on 7 December 2001, I am of the view that the facts must be flushed out at
trial and to allow the plaintiff’s application at this stage, in these
circumstances, would not be just.

13\. I therefore allowed the defendant’s application that this originating
summons be heard together with the trial of Suit 798 of 2002, or stood down
pending that trial as the trial judge may deem preferable.

14\. Costs of the proceedings to be reserved to the trial judge in Suit 798 of
2002.
