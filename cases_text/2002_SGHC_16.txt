[2002] SGHC 16

Case Number | : | OM 600002/2002  
---|---|---  
Decision Date | : | 31 January 2002  
Tribunal/Court | : | High Court  
Coram | : |  Lai Kew Chai J   
Counsel Name(s) | : |  The defendant in person; Jeffrey Chan (Senior State Counsel) for the Attorney General; Yang Lih Shyng (Khattar Wong & Partners) for the Law Society of Singapore; Davinder Singh SC, Hri Kumar and Siraj Omar (Drew & Napier LLC) for the plaintiffs   
Parties | : | —  
  
Legal Profession – Admission – Ad hoc – Three-stage test – Applicant to
possess certain qualities – Relevance of applicant's past conduct showing
contempt for Singapore judiciary – Whether applicant fit and suitable for
admission – Whether applicant's personal views and technical competence
mutually exclusive – s 21 Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Ed)  
  

: By this originating motion filed on 11 January 2002, Mr Stuart Littlemore QC
(`Mr Littlemore`) sought ad hoc admission under s 21 of the Legal Profession
Act (Cap 161, 2001 Ed) (`the Act`) as an advocate and solicitor of this court
to appear for Dr Chee Soon Juan (`Dr Chee`) in the trials of two defamation
suits in which Dr Chee was sued by Mr Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister, and
Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Senior Minister, until the final disposal of the two
suits.  
  
I heard the motion on 18 January 2002. Dr Chee appeared in person and made the
application in support of which he filed a very brief affidavit. Both counsel
for the Attorney General and the Law Society of Singapore opposed the
application on a number of grounds, but it is necessary only to deal with the
most fundamental objection. Both the Attorney General and the Law Society of
Singapore fundamentally questioned the suitability of Mr Littlemore for
admission, having regard to the incontrovertible evidence that he had
disparaged the Singapore judiciary by saying that it is `compliant` and `in
the pocket of the government`. Counsel for the plaintiffs in the two
defamation suits informed me that his clients had no objections to Dr Chee
being represented by a Queen`s Counsel. On the question whether Mr Littlemore
was a fit and proper person for admission counsel told me that his clients
would leave it to the court. At the conclusion of the hearing of the
application, I dismissed it.  
  
**_The law on Queen`s Counsel admission_**

****

Section 21 of the Act states as follows:

> _
>
> (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may, for
> the purpose of any one case where the court is satisfied that it is of
> sufficient difficulty and complexity and having regard to the circumstances
> of the case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who -
>
> (a) holds Her Majesty`s Patent as Queen`s Counsel;
>
> (b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has come or
> intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the case; and
>
> (c) has special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case.
>
> _

  
  
The requirements of s 21 were clearly set out by Yong Pung How CJ in **Re
Caplan Jonathan Michael QC (No 2)** [1998] 1 SLR 440  at [para ]11:

> _At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in which
> he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient
> difficulty and complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a
> Queen`s Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee
> of admission, for the decision to admit is still a matter for the court`s
> discretion. At the second stage, therefore, the applicant must persuade the
> court that the circumstances of the particular case warrant the court
> exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he has to
> satisfy the court of his suitability for admission._

  
  
By s 21 of the Act Parliament conferred on a QC the eligibility to apply for
ad hoc admission. The conferment of that privilege must obviously be
predicated upon at least two essential qualities which an applicant must
possess. First, and it is of fundamental importance, we must be satisfied that
by his reputation and conduct he will be responsible, honourable, courteous
and respectful of our judiciary. Though it is his duty to advance the cause of
those instructing him fearlessly and with courage in accordance with his
duties to his lay client, he should never under any circumstances allow his
personal feelings or those of his lay client to affect his duty as officer of
the court to be courteous and respectful to our judges and our judiciary.
Further, and it is beyond question, he should never scandalise, disparage or
insult our judges and our judiciary. If he has dishonoured the judiciary he
cannot reasonably expect to be honoured by being admitted as an honourable
advocate and solicitor in our courts.  
  
Secondly, he must prove that he is an experienced QC and is plainly at the
forefront of his area of specialisation so that he can adequately assist our
courts in our deliberations and the administration of justice.  
  
**_The facts_**

****

In support of the application, Dr Chee filed a brief affidavit. He stated that
Mr Littlemore is a Queen`s Counsel as from 9 December 1992. He confirmed that
Mr Littlemore did not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia. Paragraphs 5
to 7 of the affidavit were couched in the following terms:

> _
>
> 5\. The applicant has special experience for the purpose of the cases, in
> that he is an advocate specialising in defamation in all the States and
> Territories of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the United States of
> America.
>
> 6\. The cases are extremely complex defamation matters, involving factual
> and legal issues of publication and republication; qualified privilege,
> contextual truth, comment and justification; there are also counterclaims in
> defamation, and third party claims.
>
> 7\. The nature of the issues in the case and the identity and positions of
> the plaintiffs are further powerful reasons why it is proper and necessary
> for me to engage the services of leading counsel from outside Singapore. I
> believe that the applicant with his expertise and experience will be in the
> best position to assist the court in coming to a just and fair decision.
>
> _

  
  
Mr Jeffrey Chan, Senior State Counsel, filed an affidavit with the authority
of the Attorney General to set out the facts in opposing the application. It
was disclosed that Mr Littlemore was in Singapore from 8 to 12 August 1997 and
attended the defamation trial in the case of **_Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam
JB_** in his capacity as an observer for the International Commission of
Jurists (`ICJ`). As an observer from the ICJ, he was accorded all appropriate
courtesies by the court hearing the matter. Mr Littlemore subsequently
submitted a report on the trial and the judgment of the court. On 1 October
1997 the ICJ released a copy of the report which elicited from the Ministry of
Law, Singapore a point-to-point rebuttal. For present purposes, it is
unnecessary to consider those points in issue. My reference to the controversy
is merely to provide the backdrop.  
  
Following the release of the report by ICJ Mr Littlemore was interviewed by
the Australian Broadcasting Corp. This interview was broadcast on 14 October
1997. A transcript of the interview was produced before me as an exhibit. Its
accuracy was not challenged by Dr Chee. Among other things, Mr Littlemore
uttered the following:

> _The ICJ is dedicated to the rule of law. That is, a government of laws, not
> of men - the rule of laws, not men. Now that`s very uncomfortable for a
> regime that does impeccably in its judiciary on commercial matters - you
> couldn`t fault the courts - but when it comes to human rights, they really
> don`t matter ..._

> _I think it`s paying judges eight hundred thousand a year - or the chief
> judge, 1.2 million. I mean people in Singapore ... lawyers will say to you
> ... that guarantees the independence of the judiciary. I think anybody would
> say no, it puts the judiciary in the pocket of the government ... And you
> know, when judges are appointed in Singapore, they serve two and a half
> years probation. Now, the idea of that is anathema to people who believe in
> an independent judiciary._

  
  
Mr Littlemore repeated his attacks on the Singapore judiciary on 15 October
1997 in his article which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald. A copy
of the article was also exhibited in these proceedings. He wrote, among other
things, the following:

> _The Singapore High Court has a regrettable reputation as compliant with the
> interests of the Government. Its judges are paid S$800,000 (US$703,730) a
> year, and the Chief Justice S$1,200,000 (A$1,055,600) - a situation which,
> far from demonstrating the independence of the judiciary, provides a very
> persuasive basis for concluding that the judiciary would be highly motivated
> to comply with the Government priorities._

> _While the rest of the common-law world has formulated a "public figure"
> test for defamation or treated political life as requiring a higher degree
> of robust tolerance, and while such jurisdictions have also placed
> reasonable limits on damages awards, the Singapore judiciary is exposed as
> unable to accommodate the fundamental right of free speech alongside the
> right to protection of reputation._

  
  
**_Submissions_ **

****

Mr Jeffrey Chan for the Attorney General submitted that Mr Littlemore had
deliberately disparaged the Singapore judiciary and the Government of
Singapore. He said that Mr Littlemore not only had insulted the judiciary but
he had presented distorted facts of proceedings before our courts in order to
propagate a biased and loathsome image of the judiciary.  
  
Counsel for the Law Society of Singapore informed the court that the Law
Society of Singapore had studied the affidavit of Mr Jeffrey Chan and the
statements made by Mr Littlemore concerning the Singapore judiciary. Counsel
said: `(w)e are of the view that these statements are such as to bring into
question his suitability and fitness to be accorded the privilege of being
admitted to appear before a judiciary of which he thinks and speaks with such
derision`.  
  
Dr Chee initially declined to reply to those submissions but later, after I
had dismissed his application, he told me that he failed to see how Mr
Littlemore`s views could impact on Mr Littlemore being able to represent him.
He saw those `as very different matters`. They are not; honourable conduct
must go hand in hand with technical competence in the case of every officer of
our courts.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

As I had said in open court, I concluded that Mr Littlemore had shown us
contempt and had been utterly disrespectful. He came across to me as a person
who lacked `decency, measure and maturity`. I could not trust him to assist
our courts in our deliberations in relation to the suits against Dr Chee. I
also said that our judiciary could not possibly be expected to honour those
who dishonoured us, disparaged us, and who said such hurtful things about us.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application dismissed.
