**Judgment:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

1 The parties in this action lay claim in various proportions to a number of
bank accounts in United Overseas Bank Ltd ("the Bank") with assets in cash (in
local and foreign currencies) and securities totalling about $45 million.
These accounts are with the branches of the Bank in Singapore, Hong Kong and
London. The principal claimants are as follows:

> (i) the Plaintiffs, the Public Trustee of Malaysia, as the personal
> representatives of the estate of Tan Cheong Leong ("TCL");
>
> (ii) the 6 surviving sons of TCL (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th and 11th
> defendants);
>
> (iii) the personal representatives of the estates of the 4 deceased sons of
> TCL (the 1st, 6th, 12th and 18th defendants); and
>
> (iv) 3 companies (the 15th, 16th and 17 defendants) which are controlled by
> one of the sons of TCL, Tan Kim Leng (the 5th Defendant).

The minor claimants are:

(vi) the personal representative of the deceased wife of TCL (the 9th
Defendant);

(vii) two grandchildren of TCL (the 13th and 14th defendants).

The 7th Defendant is the same person as the 3rd Defendant while the 8th
Defendant makes no claim to the assets.

2 The bank accounts are in the joint names of various combinations of TCL and
the defendants. There are several camps among the claimants and they are as
follows:

> > (a) The Plaintiffs claim the assets on the basis that they were held by
> the account holders on trust for TCL;
>>

>> (b) The 1st, 2nd, 5th, 13th and 14th defendants claim the assets on the
basis that they are named in those accounts as joint account holders;

>>

>> (c) the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 10th, 11th, 12th & 18th defendants claim the assets
on the basis that these were held on trust for all 10 sons of TCL; and

>>

>> (d) The 3 companies claim the assets on the basis that the money in these
accounts came from them and were transferred out by TCL along with the 2nd
Defendant who is his 2nd son Tan Kim San ("TKS") and his deceased 3rd son Tan
Kim Hai ("TKH"), in breach of their duties as directors of those companies.
Accordingly, the 3 companies are entitled to the assets on the basis of a
resulting trust.

3 Such was the state of the pleadings when the trial began on 13 August 2001.
I should add that this action was commenced by the Bank almost 2 years ago, on
5 November 1999, by way of an interpleader summons in view of the claims of
the Plaintiffs and the 1st to 14th defendants. On 22 November 2000 the court
ordered that the personal representatives of the estate of TCL be made the
plaintiffs as a procedural formality and that all parties exchange affidavits
evidence-in-chief by 30 April 2000. The court also ordered the matter to be
fixed for a 3-week hearing commencing 15 May 2001. Subsequently orders were
made for specific discovery. On 4 April 2001, the court ordered the parties to
file and serve their respective statements of claim by 11 April and to file
the usual affidavits in respect of discovery by 18 April. However on 4 May
2001 the three companies obtained leave to be joined as additional Defendants.
The 18th Defendant was joined on 16 May 2001. As a result the trial date was
vacated and the matter was re-fixed for hearing on 13- 30 August 2001.

4 On the morning of the first day of the trial, 13 August 2001, some of the
parties made interlocutory applications. They do not concern me here except
for one. Mr Yeo, counsel for the 3 companies (the 15th, 16th and 17th
defendants), applied to amend their joint statement of claim. As it stood, the
3 companies had alleged in their statement of claim that TCL, TKS and TKH had
carried out an elaborate scheme to divert funds from the companies by way of
inflated invoices from sub-contractors which I shall term "the Diversion
Scheme". The funds received from the Diversion Scheme were eventually remitted
to Singapore and placed in the disputed accounts in the Bank. The 3 companies
alleged that the purpose of this scheme was to evade tax in Malaysia. Mr Yeo
applied to amend this statement of claim to include an allegation that part of
the money in the disputed accounts came from the 3 companies other than by way
of the Diversion Scheme, i.e. via transactions that were not illegal. However
at that stage he was not able to state the exact terms of his proposed
amendment, which was an unusual manner of going about such an application. Be
that as it may, the rest of the morning was spent dealing with the other
interlocutory applications and Mr Yeo had the benefit of the lunch adjournment
to consider the terms of his proposed amendment. He asked for an extended
lunch break to do this. I granted his request.

5 When the hearing resumed in the afternoon, Mr Yeo tendered his proposed
amendments. At this point he made a further application. This was to include
an additional party as defendant, namely Tan Chong Leong & Sons Realty Sdn Bhd
("TCLS") which is the parent company of the 3 companies. The substantive
paragraphs of the proposed amendments to the statement of claim are as
follows:

> "15A Further or alternatively, during the material period, the late Tan
> Cheong Leong, the late Tan Kim Hai and Tan Kim San, and in several
> instances, Tan Kim Seng, transferred, or procured the transfer of, monies
> belonging to the Hiap Lee Companies and/or the TCL Group into the Bank
> Accounts and/or the Disputed Assets held in the names of the Account-Holders
> for no consideration. The 15th to 17th and 19th Defendants will rely inter
> alia on the following admissions made in the affidavits and/or supplemental
> affidavits of evidence in chief filed in these proceedings by the 1st, 2nd
> and 5th Defendants ("affidavits"), and the presumption of resulting trust.
> The following are the best particulars that the 15th to 17th and 19th
> Defendants can furnish at this point in time.
>

>

>> (1) Paragraph 25 of the 1st Defendant's affidavit and paragraph 6 of the
1st Defendant's supplemental affidavit (please see Annex A);

>>

>> (2) Paragraphs 67 to 70, 82, 84, 85 and 86 of the 2nd Defendant's
affidavit; see also paragraphs 25-27, 29-31, 33, 36, 38, 41-48, 51-56 (please
see Annex B);

>>

>> (3) Paragraphs 14, 21, 27, 29, 33, 34, 45-46 and 56-58 of the 5th
Defendant's affidavit (please see Annex C).

> 20A Alternatively, by reason of the matters pleaded in paragraph 15A above,
> the Account-Holders have at all material times held the credit balances in
> the Bank Accounts and the Disputed Assets on resulting trust for the Hiap
> Lee Companies and/or the TCL Group.
>
> 20B Alternatively, the transfers of monies described at paragraph 15A above
> were a wrongful misapplication of the assets of the Hiap Lee Companies
> and/or the TCL Group and made in breach of fiduciary duty.

>> (1) The transfers were effected without proper company resolutions or
shareholder approval;

>>

>> (2) The transfers were effected by the late Tan Cheong Leong, the late Tan
Kim Hai and Tan Kim San, who were directors of TCLS at the material time, for
the benefit of, inter alia, themselves personally;

>>

>> (3) The transfers were effected without any corporate benefit to the Hiap
Lee Companies and/or the TCL Group.

>
> 20C In the premises, the Hiap Lee Companies and/or TCLS are entitled to

> trace such monies into the credit balances in the Bank Accounts and into the
> Disputed Assets. Alternatively, the Account-Holders each knew that the
> monies in the Bank Accounts belonged to the TCL Group and had been
> misapplied. Accordingly, the Account-Holders have at all material times held
> the credit balances in the Bank Accounts and the Disputed Assets on
> constructive trust."

6 After Mr Yeo had given his reasons for the application, in view of the hour,
the hearing was adjourned to enable counsel for the other parties an
opportunity to consider the application.

7 On 14 August, the hearing of the application to amend continued. I observed
that the proposed amendments did not allege that any of the money in the
disputed accounts came from TCLS which was a holding company. To my inquiry as
to the necessity for including TCLS as a new defendant, Mr Yeo was unable to
come up with any reason that I considered to be cogent. Finally, Mr Yeo
confirmed that should the amendments be allowed he would not require any
additional witnesses nor adduce additional evidence. He said that the proof in
respect of the amended pleadings would come from the affidavits evidence-in-
chief of the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants.

8 Mr Davinder Singh, counsel for the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 13th and 14th defendants,
objected to the application. He submitted that if the amendments were allowed
he would have to take instructions from his clients in respect of the
transactions alleged as such matters were never in consideration. Additionally
further discovery would be necessary. In view of this, he would have no choice
but to apply to vacate the present trial date, otherwise his clients would be
prejudiced.

9 In the event, I refused Mr Yeos application to include TCLS as a defendant
in the action, and to amend the statement of claim of the 3 companies. As his
clients have appealed on 13 September 2001 I now give my grounds of decision.

10 First of all, there are 18 parties in this action, ranging from the Public
Trustee of Malaysia to each of the 10 sons of TCL (or their estates), to the
estate of his deceased wife, to his 2 granddaughters and to the 3 companies.
Although 3 of the defendants are inactive, there are 15 claimants and 9 sets
of solicitors in this action. Although the number varied each day, I counted
12 counsel seated at the bar table and another 3 or 4 seated at the sides. I
say this to emphasise the point that this is a very expensive trial for all
concerned and one that is monstrously difficult to fix. There has already been
one vacation of the trial date. To vacate this trial again would not only
chalk up very high costs but would entail tremendous inconvenience to all
parties and counsel in the action.

11 Secondly, it would be necessary to vacate the trial if leave were given to
amend. As the other defendants deny the allegation of the 3 companies that
part of the disputed assets came from those companies or any other company,
they would have to be given the opportunity to look into the records of the 3
companies as well as other unspecified companies in the "TCL Group" to prove
their case. This was a matter that they were not hitherto concerned with. It
would likely entail another round of discovery requiring tracing of documents
going back a quarter century. Therefore not only would the trial have to be
vacated a second time, because of the nature of the discovery required this
time around, it might have to be adjourned for a substantial period.

12 Thirdly, Mr Yeo relies on evidence in the affidavits evidence-in-chief
already filed by the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants. This is set out in the
particulars to the new paragraph 15A of the proposed amended Statement of
Claim. However the relevant paragraphs of those affidavits do not, on the face
of it, support the pleaded facts.

13 Fourthly, the proposed amendments pertain to a matter which was well within
the power of the applicants to apply at an earlier stage. The affidavits
evidence-in-chief were ordered to be exchanged on 18 July 2001, more than 3
weeks before the start of the trial. There is a certificate stating that they
were exchanged by 25 July 2001, which is more than 2 weeks before the start of
the trial. Had the 3 companies applied to amend their statement of claim
shortly after that, it might not have entailed a vacation of the trial dates
or at the very least not cause the trial to be substantially delayed.

14 Lastly as the proposed amendments concern a new cause of action, the
applicants and the potential 19th Defendant would not have been precluded from
bringing a new action in respect of their claim if the application were
dismissed. Therefore shutting them out in the present proceedings would
achieve the dual objectives of not preventing them from proceeding with their
claim, albeit not in the present action but in a new one, and ensuring an
expeditious resolution of the matters already in focus and in respect of which
all 17 parties are poised to proceed. If there were any concern (although Mr
Yeo did not raise it) that a fresh action could be too late because the horse,
in the form of the disputed assets, might have bolted, it can easily be
resolved in this manner. The applicants right to the disputed assets, if
proven, is superior to those of the other claimants. As such, after filing the
writ they can apply for a stay of execution of any judgment in the present
action pending determination of their claim in the new action. I do not see
that they would have any difficulty in obtaining such a stay provided they can
present a more cogent cause of action than what was laid out before me by Mr
Yeo, subject of course to the usual undertaking as to damages.

15 For the reasons given above, I dismissed application of the 15th, 16th and
17th defendants to amend their Statement of Claim and ordered costs to be paid
by them to the other parties which are to be taxed if not agreed.
