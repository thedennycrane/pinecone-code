Facts

4 On 6 May 2011, at about 7.52pm, the second accused was arrested by Central
Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers at the grass patch behind Blk 44 Sims Drive.
During the arrest, a white and blue plastic bag belonging to the accused was
recovered. The said plastic bag was found to contain two packets of powdery
substance which were later found to contain not less than 690.3g of ketamine
(“the ketamine exhibits”), one packet containing four smaller packets of
crystalline substance, one black coloured plastic bag containing one big
packet of white powdery substance and five ecstasy tablets. Also found on him
were, _inter alia_ , two packets of granular substance, one straw of powdery
substance and one Marlboro box containing one straw of brown substance. The
second accused was then escorted to his registered address where a search
yielded various substances and drug paraphernalia which were unrelated to the
proceeded charges.

5 On 6 May 2011, at about 9.10pm, the first accused was arrested outside the
main gate of 21 Lorong Tahar. A search was conducted on the first accused and
four keys were recovered. One of the keys was used to enter Room 3 in #05-01
(“the Lorong Tahar room”). The first accused was then escorted into the Lorong
Tahar room where more substances and drug paraphernalia were recovered. Among
the items recovered, there were two packets of brown granular substances that
were later found to contain not less than 15.77 grams of diamorphine (“the
diamorphine exhibits”) and 18 packets of crystalline substances that were
later found to contain not less than 68.51g of methamphetamine (“the
methamphetamine exhibits”).

Facts relating to the first and second charges against both accused

6 The diamorphine exhibits and methamphetamine exhibits formed the subject of
the first charge and second charge against each accused person respectively.
At the time of their arrests, the accused persons had in their possession the
keys to access the Lorong Tahar room where the diamorphine exhibits and
methamphetamine exhibits were found. They were in a relationship since early
2011 and were staying together in the Lorong Tahar room since a few days
before their arrests on 6 May 2011.

7 The accused persons knew that the diamorphine exhibits and methamphetamine
exhibits were present in the Lorong Tahar room and they further admitted that
these substances belonged to them. They also admitted that the abovementioned
substances were in their possession for the purposes of sale to other persons.

Facts relating to the third charge against the first accused

8 The first accused’s urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine and
this formed the subject of the third charge against her. She admitted that she
had consumed methamphetamine prior to her arrest on 6 May 2011. She would
consume methamphetamine about three to four times a week. She would heat up
the methamphetamine, let the smoke pass through a glass container containing
some water and inhale the smoke thereafter. The first accused was previously
convicted of the same offence in 2003.

Facts relating to the seventh and fifteenth charges against the second accused

9 The ketamine exhibits formed the subject of the seventh charge against the
second accused. At the time of his arrest, the second accused knew that the
ketamine exhibits were inside the white and blue plastic bag and further
admitted to the possession of the said plastic bag as well as the ketamine
exhibits in it. He had received the ketamine exhibits from one “Ah Boy” and he
intended to sell them to other people.

10 The second accused’s urine samples were found to contain morphine and this
formed the subject of the fifteenth charge against him. He admitted that he
had consumed morphine a few hours prior to his arrest on 6 May 2011. The
second accused obtained his morphine from one “Ah Boy” and would consume
morphine on a daily basis. He would put the morphine on a foil, burn the
bottom of the foil and inhale the fumes using a rolled-up paper. The second
accused was previously convicted of the same offence in 1996 and was admitted
to DRC in 1999 for morphine consumption.

11 After ensuring that the accused persons understood the nature and
consequences of their plea of guilt and the sentences prescribed for the
offences, I found them guilty as charged and convicted them accordingly.

Mitigation

The first accused

13 In his written mitigation plea, defence counsel for the first accused urged
the Court to be lenient on the following grounds – that the first accused had
a troubled past which drove her to substance abuse; that she played a
relatively minor role in the trafficking offences; and that she pleaded guilty
and cooperated with the authorities.

The second accused

14 The defence counsel for the second accused similarly urged the Court to be
lenient on the basis that the second accused was remorseful and had fully
cooperated with the CNB officers. He further submitted that the second accused
was unlikely to reoffend given his age and the long imprisonment term he
faced.

Sentence

15 In sentencing the accused persons, I took into account their antecedents,
the charges taken into consideration as well as their respective mitigation
pleas.

The first accused

16 The first accused was a female offender and therefore was not liable to be
caned (see s 325(1)(_a_) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the
CPC”)). As such, the first accused faced imprisonment for a term of not less
than 20 years, five years and three years for the first to third charges
respectively. On top of these charges, the first accused consented for the
remaining two charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of
sentencing (“the TIC charges”). The TIC charges pertained to the following
offences:

(a) Fourth charge: Possession of utensils intended to be used for consuming a
controlled drug – s 9 of the MDA.

(b) Fifth charge: Possession of methamphetamine – s 8(a) of the MDA.

17 I noted that the first accused had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges
and that she had played a minor role in the trafficking offences. I was also
mindful of her difficult life circumstances that had led her to make bad
choices along the way. However, I also took into account the TIC charges and
the fact that this was not her first brush with the law, particularly in
relation to drug offences.

18 Having regard to all of the above, I sentenced her to 20 years’
imprisonment for the first charge of trafficking 14.99 grams of diamorphine, 6
years’ imprisonment for the second charge of trafficking 68.51 grams of
methamphetamine and 3 years’ imprisonment for the third charge of enhanced
consumption. I ordered the sentences for the third charge to run consecutively
with that for the first charge and the sentence for the second charge to run
concurrently with that for the first charge. The total sentence would
therefore be 23 years’ imprisonment. The sentences were also backdated to 6
May 2011, the date of her arrest.

The second accused

19 Pursuant to s 325(1)(b) of the CPC, the second accused was not liable to be
caned since he was above the age of 50. As such, the prescribed punishment of
the charges against the second accused were imprisonment of not less than 20
years for the first charge, and five years for each of the second charge,
seventh charge and fifteenth charge. The second accused consented for the
remaining 12 charges against him to be taken into consideration for the
purposes of sentencing. These 12 charges pertained to the following offences:

(a) Third charge: Possession of 5.77g of diamorphine for the purpose of
trafficking – s 5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) of the MDA.

(b) Fourth charge: Possession of Nimetazepam (enhanced) – s 8(a) of the MDA.

(c) Fifth charge: Possession of 0.35g of diamorphine (enhanced) – s 8(_a_)
punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

(d) Sixth charge: Possession of drug utensils – s 9 of the MDA.

(e) Eighth charge: Possession of 17.29g of methamphetamine for the purpose of
trafficking – s 5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) of the MDA.

(f) Ninth charge: Possession of 0.40g of
N,a-dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)-phenethylamine (enhanced) – s 8(_a_)
punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

(g) Tenth charge: Possession of 0.40g of ketamine (enhanced) – s 8(_a_)
punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

(h) Eleventh charge: Possession of 0.83g of diamorphine (enhanced) – s 8(_a_)
punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

(i) Twelfth charge: Possession of 0.29g of methamphetamine (enhanced) – s
8(_a_) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

(j) Thirteenth charge: Possession of methamphetamine (enhanced) – s 8(_a_)
punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

(k) Fourteenth charge: Possession of drug utensils – s 9 of the MDA.

(l) Sixteenth charge: Consumption of methamphetamine (enhanced) – s 8(_b_)(ii)
punishable under s 33A(1) of the MDA.

20 I noted the second accused’s remorse as reflected in his personal
mitigation plea and his low likelihood of reoffending given his age and long
term of imprisonment he faced. However, in view of his lengthy antecedents and
the large number of charges taken into consideration for the purposes of
sentencing, I sentenced him to 22 years’ imprisonment for trafficking in
14.99g of diamorphine, 7 years’ imprisonment for trafficking in 68.51g of
methamphetamine, 7 years’ imprisonment for trafficking in not less than 690.3g
of ketamine, and 6 years’ imprisonment for the enhanced consumption charge. I
ordered the sentence for the second charge to run consecutively with that for
the first charge, and sentence for the seventh charge and the fifteenth charge
to run concurrently with that for the first charge. This would make a total
imprisonment term of 29 years. The sentences were also backdated to 6 May
2011, the date of his arrest.
