Kwek Mean Luck J:

Introduction

1 The Plaintiff, DSL Integrated Solutions Pte Ltd (“DSL”), and the Defendant,
Triumph Electrical System Engineering Pte Ltd (“Triumph Electrical”), are
companies involved in building and construction activities. Qingjian
International (South Pacific) Group Development Co Pte Ltd (“CNQC”) is the
main contractor in the Forett Condominium Project (“the Project”). The
Plaintiff was CNQC’s subcontractor for the design, supply and installation of
electrical works (“Electrical Works”) at the Project (“Electrical Project”).
The Plaintiff’s contract with CNQC shall be referred to as the “Main
Contract”.

2 In this action, the Plaintiff claims against the Defendant for (a) damages
arising out of alleged breaches of a sub-contract between the Plaintiff and
the Defendant; (b) interest; and (c) costs.

3 The Plaintiff contends that it had sub-contracted the Electrical Works to
the Defendant on terms which had been agreed. As such, there is a binding
agreement between the parties. The Plaintiff says that the Defendant
wrongfully repudiated the agreement by unjustifiably stopping work in May
2021. The Plaintiff further argues that the Defendant also breached the
agreement by failing to perform several key obligations under the Main
Contract. The Plaintiff consequently terminated the agreement on 3 June 2021.
It claims for an indemnity against all claims from CNQC due to the termination
of the Main Contract and damages for the breach of the sub-contract.

4 The Defendant’s position is that there were no such breaches of contract
because no such sub-contract was formed. Alternatively, the Defendant argues
that even if there is a sub-contract, it was entitled to terminate the
contract because the Plaintiff repudiated the contract by its failure to (a)
allocate 20 man-year entitlement (“MYE”); (b) provide an on-site dormitory for
the Defendant’s workers; and (c) issue a 10% performance bond to CNQC. The
Defendant counterclaims for quantum meruit for works carried out at the
Plaintiff’s request, pending the parties’ negotiation and agreement on a
proposed sub-contract which was never agreed upon.

5 Mr Gary Lee Chee Seng (“Gary”), the Managing Director of the Plaintiff, Mr
Lawrence Li Detong (“Lawrence”), the Project Manager for the Plaintiff from
2018 to 2020, and Mr Edward Yeo Xi Yue (“Edward”), the Executive Director of
the Defendant, testified at the trial.

Agreed Issues

7 The proceedings have been bifurcated. Hence this tranche of the trial is
only on liability. The agreed issues are:

(a) whether there is an agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in
relation to the Electrical Works (“Issue 1”);

(b) if there is a binding agreement:

(i) what were the terms of the agreement (“Issue 2”);

(ii) whether there had been a breach of the terms of the agreement by the
Plaintiff and/or the Defendant, as the case may be, the particular terms which
were breached and how they were breached (“Issue 3”);

(iii) whether any such breach amounted to a repudiatory breach of the
agreement (“Issue 4”);

(iv) whether the agreement has been wrongfully terminated (“Issue 5”);

(v) the liability for breach and/or wrongful termination in respect of each of
the Plaintiff and/or the Defendant if any (“Issue 6”); and

(c) if there was no binding agreement between the parties, whether the
Defendant is entitled to a quantum meruit claim for the Electrical Works
carried out (“Issue 7”).

Whether there is an agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in
relation to the Electrical Works

8 Issue 1 is whether there is an agreement between the Plaintiff and the
Defendant in relation to the Electrical Works.

Parties’ position

9 The Plaintiff submits that there was a valid agreement between the parties
for the following reasons: 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

Plaintiff’s Opening Statement (“POS”) at [11].

(a) Both parties intended the Defendant to be the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor
for the Electrical Works since the tender stage for the Main Contract.

(b) The terms in the Confirmation Email and the Revised Quotation are
comprehensive. They have all the necessary ingredients for a construction
contract, namely the parties, scope of work, contract period and price.

(c) The Defendant did not raise any objections to the Confirmation Email or
the Revised Quotation. After receiving these documents, the Defendant
commenced work on 23 September 2020.

(d) On 24 September 2020, Edward replied to the Confirmation Email. He did not
object to the terms of the Confirmation Email or the Revised Quotation.

(e) From end of September 2020 to May 2021, the Defendant had completed the
Electrical Works for the site office at the Project, installed temporary
electrical works at the site, prepared and submitted design drawings to the
project consultant, represented to CNQC that it was the Plaintiff’s sub-
contractors, communicated with CNQC as the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor and
prepared and submitted payment claims for the Plaintiff.

(f) The Defendant did not reject the terms of the Main Contract which was
forwarded to them on 23 December 2020.

(g) Sometime in January 2021, the Defendant assisted the Plaintiff to prepare
its first progress claim to CNQC. This progress claim was based on the formula
set out in the Revised Quotation (ie, 8% from the Main Contract) and the price
breakdown set out in the Main Contract bills of quantities. The 2nd and 3rd
progress claims were made on 24 February 2021 and 25 March 2021. This was
repeated by the Defendant in a document dated 22 May 2021 which is labelled as
its fifth payment claim.

10 The Defendant makes a preliminary objection that the Plaintiff’s pleadings
are defective because the allegation that the Defendant accepted the agreement
by way of conduct has not been pleaded. 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

Defendant’s Skeletal Submissions (“DSS”) dated 22 July 2022 at [2].

11 The Defendant’s main submission on this issue is at two levels.

12 First, the Defendant submits that the Revised Quotation is a counter-offer
that is incapable of acceptance at law. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

Defendant’s Opening Statement (“DOS”) at [22] to [28].

(a) The contract price was indeterminate. The relevant provision of the
Revised Quotation read: “as per breakdown amount of $6,430,800 (8% from CNQC’s
contract sum)”. The Defendant submits that this could either mean that the
contract price is 8% of CNQC contract sum or that it is 8% less of CNQC
contract sum. The Defendant argues that both figures are wrong. The former
would mean that the CNQC contract sum is around $18.375m, which it is not. If
it is the latter, then the Revised Quotation should have stated $6,348,000,
not $6,430,800. The Defendant submits that the contract price indicated in the
Revised Quotation is indeterminate and any purported contract must be void for
uncertainty.

(b) DSL qualified the Revised Quotation with the words “approved in principle
and pending official main contractor’s contract”. This was followed by
reiterating that DSL “would like to confirmed [sic] [Triumph Electrical’s]
service in principal [sic]…”. DSL indicated that the Revised Quotation “shall
be an back to back contract with commerical [sic] having certain acceptation
[sic]”, without specifying what are the exceptions. At the time the Revised
Quotation was sent, the Main Contract had yet to be signed. The Defendant
argues that it would not be possible for a contract to come into existence in
the circumstances when it was not even aware of the terms of the Main Contract
— there can be no meeting of minds when the terms of the agreement are yet
unknown.

13 Second, the Defendant submits that on the evidence, there was no agreement
between the parties:

(a) The Plaintiff unilaterally revised several terms in the Revised Quotation
and omitted to include terms relating to (i) MYE support, (ii) provision of an
on-site dormitory, and (iii) payment, that were agreed on during a meeting on
21 September 2020. The Defendant did not approve the terms of the Revised
Quotation. Edward’s email dated 24 September 2020 in response to the Revised
Quotation represents a rejection of the Revised Quotation and the terms set
out therein. 36

DOS at [18] to [20].

(b) Edward told Lawrence during their telephone call sometime between 22
September to 24 September 2020 that he did not accept the Revised Quotation.
Lawrence requested the Defendant to start work first due to the urgency in
completing the works, while he would get the Plaintiff’s team to sort out the
disputed terms. 37

##### Foot Note 37

×

DOS at [30].

(c) The Defendant’s version of the facts is supported by: (i) the follow-up WA
message from Lawrence dated 24 September 2020 to Edward in which he said:
“Please help me to state 20 mye per year purely for this forett project”; and
(ii) Edward’s email of 24 September 2020 in response to the Revised Quotation
where he specifically reiterated that the Defendant would require 20 MYE. 38

(d) The Defendant relies on discussions during meetings on 3 September 2020

(e) There was no acceptance of the Revised Quotation by conduct.  
The reference to the Defendant as “DSL sub-con” in an email dated 23 December
2020 sent by the Defendant to CNQC, was for ease of reference in
communications with CNQC. The provision of workers’ names, organisation chart,
risk assessment, etc, were necessary for Triumph Electrical to commence works
first as requested by DSL, pending parties’ agreement on the proposed sub-
contract. 40

##### Foot Note 40

×

DOS at [42(c)].

(f) The Defendant relies on the following conduct to show that parties did not
enter into a sub-contract:

(i) On 23 December 2020, the Defendant received an email from the Plaintiff’s
Angelia attaching a signed copy of the Main Contract. In the same email, the
Plaintiff requested for a meeting to discuss the terms of the proposed sub-
contract between DSL and Triumph Electrical. 41

(ii) Edward sent further chasers to Gary on the proposed sub-contract and

DOS at [43(b)]; Edward’s AEIC at [87] to [88].

(g) Only to the extent of the Plaintiff’s request for the Defendant to
commence work on the Electrical Project while parties are negotiating the
proposed sub-contract, the Plaintiff had agreed to pay to the Defendant 92% of
the value of the amount which has been certified by CNQC, while the Plaintiff
would receive the remaining 8%. 44

My decision

14 I will deal first with the Defendant’s preliminary objection that the
conduct showing agreement was not pleaded by the Plaintiff. I agree with the
Plaintiff that there is no basis for this objection, as the Plaintiff has
pleaded that the Defendant had accepted the Revised Quotation by its conduct,
“when it commenced work in September 2020 and continued to do so in January
2021 and up to May 2021” 45

, and also pleaded the facts of such conduct. 46

##### Foot Note 46

RDCC at [9A] and [9B].

The Defendant complains that this was in the Reply and not in the Statement of
Claim. However, it is undisputed that the Defendant had sight of what was in
the Reply and responded to this point in Edward’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-
Chief (“AEIC”). The Defendant clearly knew what case it had to meet at trial.
It is trite law that the court may permit an unpleaded point to be raised,
provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably
prejudiced: OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd [2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18]; Lu
Bang Song v Teambuild Construction Pte Ltd [2009] SGHC 49 at [17]. In the
present case, there was clearly no irreparable prejudice to the Defendant.
Counsel for the Defendant acknowledged that the Defendant was not surprised by
the material facts being pleaded in the Reply.

15 I will deal next with the Defendant’s submission that the counter-offer in
the Revised Quotation was incapable in law of being accepted.

16 The Defendant first submitted that the price was indeterminate. This is
because the Revised Quotation either meant 8% of the CNQC contract sum or 8%
less than the CNQC contract sum, both of which were inaccurate.

17 I do not find that the first of the Defendant’s interpretations was a
possible intended meaning. The Revised Quotation stated “8% from CNQC’s
contract sum” and not 8% “of” the CNQC contract sum. A plain reading of this
phrase is that the parties intended for the contract price to have an 8%
difference from the CNQC contract sum. This is supported by the Confirmation
Email, which stated “we would like to confirmed [sic] your service in
principal [sic] with eight (8%) different [sic] from our awarded CNQC’s
Contract”. In other words, the parties intended for the Plaintiff to retain 8%
of the contract price in the Main Contract and the Defendant to retain the
remaining 92%.

18 The Defendant also argues that the final contract price in the Main
Contract is $6,900,000 and that 92% of this sum would be $6,348,000, not
$6,430,800 which was stated in the Revised Quotation. However, I do not find
that this slight difference results in any indeterminacy of contract term on
pricing. As mentioned, the Confirmation Email made clear that the contract
price between the parties is an 8% difference from the awarded CNQC contract.
The Defendant themselves in preparing their progress claims, took $6,348,000,
which is 8% from the contract sum in the Main Contract, as the basis for their
milestone claims.

19 Second, the Defendant submitted that the Revised Quotation was an inchoate
counter-offer since it was pending the Main Contract. 47

##### Foot Note 47

DOS at [28].

20 It is undisputed that the Main Contract was sent to the Defendant only on
23 December 2020. The Defendant would not have had sight of any of the terms
of the Main Contract prior to then. In these circumstances, I find that the
parties could not have intended for a “back-to-back” contract in the manner
argued by the Plaintiff — that all the terms in the Main Contract to be
incorporated in their agreement on 24 September 2020.

21 The term “back-to-back contract” is “not a term of art”: GIB Automation Pte
Ltd v Deluge Fire Protection (SEA) Pte Ltd [2007] 2 SLR(R) 918 (“GIB
Automation”) at [35]. It is essentially a pragmatic term of incorporation
which incorporates into a subcontract the terms of the head contract. What is
key is that “despite these words of incorporation appearing in a subcontract,
the subcontract and the head contract remain distinct contracts”: Comfort
Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd and another [2020] SGHC 165 at
[62].

22 In Hi-Amp Engineering Pte Ltd v Technicdelta Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd
[2003] SGHC 316 at [98], the court held that there was no “back-to-back”
contract because the defendants did not furnish the main contract documents to
the plaintiff when the parties signed the sub-contract, and the plaintiff was
unaware of the terms of the main contract. Here, not only was the Defendant
unaware of the terms of the main contract, it is undisputed that the Main
Contract had not even been signed as of the date of the Confirmation Email on
22 September 2020 or when the Defendant replied to it via email on 24
September 2020. It was only signed around 21 December 2020 48

##### Foot Note 48

and conveyed to the Defendant around 23 December 2020. Since both the
Plaintiff and the Defendant were unaware of the terms of the Main Contract, it
cannot be said that all the terms of the Main Contract were imported into the
parties’ agreement as of 24 September 2020.

23 In GIB Automation, it was held at [48] and [50]:

48 The weight to be attached to the fact that a party has not seen the main
contract must be considered in the light of the factual matrix as a whole. It
may not be decisive if the circumstances are such that the terms said to be
affected by the back-to-back provision are matters that would fall within the
general appreciation and knowledge of the parties to the subcontract. On the
other hand, if the terms are highly technical and particular, it may be more
important. Further, consideration should be given to the sub-contractor’s
ability to ask for a copy of the main contract. It may also be overcome with
sufficiently explicit language making it clear that the head contract was
being incorporated and that the sub-contractor was deemed to have acquainted
itself with its terms.

…

50 Just what is incorporated will depend in each case upon such things (among
others) as what was objectively known to the parties at the time they entered
into the contract, what specific references were made to the main contract
document, and whether the terms of the main contract relevant to the back-to-
back provision were of such a nature that they should have been and were
specifically brought home to the sub-contractor or whether they were
sufficiently general that they would fall within the general appreciation and
knowledge of the parties. By way of example, it may be generally known to a
sub-contractor that the main contractor would in due course make an
application for payment to the employer in respect of works done by the sub-
contractor. On the other hand, it may not be generally known to the sub-
contractor that requests have to be in a very particular format.

24 Applying the analysis in GIB Automation, it would only be the terms of the
Main Contract that were within the general appreciation and knowledge of the
parties, that could be incorporated by the back-to-back clause. On the facts,
I find that this includes the contract price, the work scope of the Main
Contract and that the Defendant would be paid 92% of the contract price as set
out in the Main Contract. I will deal with the other clauses in the Main
Contract that the Plaintiff relies on later.

25 The next issue I turn to consider is whether, notwithstanding the fact that
the terms of the Main Contract had not been incorporated as of 24 September
2020, there could nonetheless be a binding agreement between the parties on 24
September 2020 based on the Revised Quotation and the Confirmation Email. In
Toptip Holding Pte Ltd v Mercuria Energy Trading Pte Ltd and another appeal
[2018] 1 SLR 50 at [40], the Court of Appeal held that:

... It is established law that a contract may be formed despite the fact that
some terms have not yet been finalised. This occurs when an objective
appraisal of the conduct and language of the negotiating parties leads to the
conclusion that, having agreed on the essential terms, though not all the
terms, they nevertheless intended to be bound immediately…

26 The determination of the essential terms in a contract is a factual inquiry
that depends on the circumstances of the parties’ dealings with each other,
including the nature of the transaction envisaged by the parties: The Law of
Contract in Singapore (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing,
2012) at para 03.235; Norwest Holdings Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Newport
Mining Ltd [2010] 3 SLR 956 (“Norwest Holdings”) at [28]. Typically, the
essential terms of a contract would include the parties, the price, and the
subject matter: Tan Ngiap Tong v Tan Ngep Hong [2021] SGHC 220 at [5].

27 In Drake and Scull Engineering Limited v Higgs and Hill Northern Limited
(1995) 11 Const LJ 214, the defendants were main contractors for certain works
to a Liverpool hospital and the plaintiffs were the sub-contractor for the
supply and installation of mechanical and electrical installations.
Notwithstanding the fact that the parties did not agree on the plaintiffs’
daywork rates, the Official Referee found that there was a binding contract,
reasoning that:

I am satisfied that by 11 May all the terms save one necessary for a binding
sub-contract to come into being were ‘agreed’. That is to say, inter alia,
price, commencement date of the contract, duration of the contract and
obligations under the contract… [emphasis added].

28 In Hock Chuan Ann Construction Pte Ltd v Kimta Electric Pte Ltd [1999] 2
SLR (R) 237, the court held at [59] that “in some cases, the battle is won by
the man who fires the last shot, the other party being taken to have agreed to
his terms by conduct in proceeding to perform the agreement without
objection.”.

29 With these in mind, I will next examine the evidence on whether there was a
binding agreement between the parties as of 24 September 2020.

30 It is undisputed that prior to the Confirmation Email, information
pertaining to the Electrical Project, including its work scope, had been
conveyed to the Defendant at the tender interview and the documentation about
the Project had been sent to the Defendant.

31 On 22 September 2020, the Plaintiff emailed the Defendant the Confirmation
Email, enclosing the Revised Quotation, which contained their amendments to
the Defendant’s Quotation. The email stated: 49

33 Edward explains that what he meant by “[a]s per discussed with Lawrence and
agreed”, is the phone conversation he had with Lawrence around 22 to 24
September 2020, where he told Lawrence that he could not accept the terms in
the Revised Quotation. 51

Lawrence’s AEIC at [47].

His evidence is that he understood the phrase “[a]s per discussed with
Lawrence and agreed” in Edward’s 24 September 2020 email, to mean that Edward
agreed to most of the terms in the Revised Quotation, and the only thing was
that he needed DSL to support the MYE request. 53

Lawrence’s evidence on the stand was that he and Edward discussed the terms of
the Revised Quotation. He said he went through with Edward the terms that were
amended from the Defendant’s quotation and Edward agreed with them. 54

although there remained outstanding issues such as the exact number of MYE,
dormitory support, work materials and the performance bond. However,
Lawrence’s view was that these were minor issues to be worked out along the
way and did not affect the agreement. 56

The Defendant submits that Lawrence’s evidence that the Defendant agreed to
most things shows that there was no contract between the parties. However,
that misconstrues Lawrence’s testimony, which was clear in highlighting the
parties had already agreed on the remaining terms of the contract, save for
the MYE issue. Lawrence testified that “they already have a common
understanding, during that time when they write this, so we already agree most
of the thing, except for some MYE, and can proceed on”. 57

35 Lawrence acknowledged that Edward also raised the MYE issue. In this
regard, Lawrence explained that there is generally about 1 MYE for every
$500,000 of the contract sum, 58

which meant that the Defendant would definitely be receiving MYE. As such, the
issue was just about the quantum of MYE that the Defendant would receive. 59

##### Foot Note 59

×

19 July 2022 Transcript at p 63 line 24 to p 64 line 2.

This in turn would depend on the amount of MYE that CNQC could secure from the
Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). As CNQC had not been allocated its MYE from MOM,
Lawrence could not confirm how many MYE the Defendant would receive.
Nonetheless, Lawrence told Edward to write in and put his MYE request in
“black and white”. 60

##### Foot Note 60

19 July 2022 Transcript at p 52 lines 8 to 15.

36 The Defendant submits that Edward’s version of the event, that he told
Lawrence he could not accept the Revised Quotation in their telephone call, is
supported by Lawrence’s WA message on 24 September 2020, in which he stated
“[p]lease help me to state 20 mye per year purely for this forett project”. I
am unable to agree. Lawrence’s WA message of 24 September 2020 does not say in
any way that Edward informed Lawrence of his disagreement with the Revised
Quotation. Lawrence’s WA message only asks Edward to state his MYE request,
which is consistent with Lawrence’s evidence that he told Edward to state down
his MYE request in black and white.

37 The Defendant further submits that there was no agreement on the Revised
Quotation because it did not record material terms sought by the Defendant,
such as (a) the allocation of 20 MYE to the Defendant, (b) the provision of an
on-site dormitory for the Defendant’s workers, and (c) the issuance of the
performance bond to CNQC. However, there is no documentary evidence that these
terms were regarded as so material that they would prevent the parties’
agreement on the Revised Quotation.

38 Notably, Edward did not say in his 24 September 2020 email that he
disagreed with the Revised Quotation. Neither did Edward say that the
Defendant’s agreement to the Revised Quotation was conditional on the
Plaintiff’s provision of 20 MYE per year and an on-site dormitory for 20 men.

39 Given the above, Edward’s email could possibly be read as him saying that
he had no objections to the Revised Quotation, but that he also needed the
support of 20 MYE and an on-site dormitory. I find that this reading of
Edward’s 24 September 2020 email is reinforced by Edward’s subsequent conduct.

40 The Defendant started work on the Electrical Project in late September, at
around the time of Edward’s email reply of 24 September 2020. Edward evidence
is that the Defendant only commenced work because Lawrence requested that the
Defendant start work first due to the urgency in completing the works, and had
assured Edward that he would get the Plaintiff’s team to sort out the disputed
terms. 61

##### Foot Note 61

×

Edward’s AEIC at [51].

41 However, while it could be the case that a party may start work on the
basis of some agreed essential terms while some disputed terms are being
ironed out, this is not the Defendant’s position. Edward’s evidence is that
the Defendant agreed to start work without any agreement at all, except for
the term that DSL would pay to Triumph Electrical 92% of the works certified
by CNQC. 62

##### Foot Note 62

×

Edward’s AEIC at [52].

42 Taking the Defendant’s position to its logical conclusion, it would mean
that the Defendant agreed to start work without any agreement on the price or
the exact scope of work. In relation to the price, it would have meant that
the Defendant had agreed to start work even if the final contract price was
less than the $6.9m that it had tendered for. Seen in this light, the
Defendant’s position is less than credible. It is even less so when seen with
the other actions of the Defendant.

43 For not only did the Defendant start work around the time he replied to the
Confirmation email in late September 2020, the Defendant also represented to
CNQC that the Defendant was the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor.

44 In Edward’s email dated 23 December 2020 to CNQC, he informs CNQC that:
“[t]hese are all the documents compile[d] under Triumph Electrical System
Engineering Pte Ltd as DSL sub-con …” [emphasis added]. 63

##### Foot Note 63

×

Gary’s AEIC at [46].

On the face of this email, Edward recognised the Defendant as “DSL’s sub-
contractor” for the Electrical Project and is representing that to the main
contractor, CNQC. This must mean that he accepted that there is a valid
agreement between the parties. The only basis for the Defendant being the
Plaintiff’s sub-contractor is the correspondence between them that led to an
acceptance by the Defendant of the Revised Quotation.

45 There is certainly no documentation that states the Defendant was prepared
to carry out the Electrical Works on the basis of the Plaintiff paying it 92%
of the works certified by CNQC, without any other terms. There is certainly
also no documentation stating that the Plaintiff accepted such an offer.

46 Edward seeks to explain the Defendant’s representation to CNQC by saying
that CNQC was aware that the Defendant was carrying out works and submitting
documents to CNQC on behalf of the Plaintiff, which was why in correspondence
with CNQC, the Defendant was sometimes referred to as “DSL sub-con” for ease
of reference. 64

##### Foot Note 64

×

Edward’s AEIC at [57].

47 However, this was not a mere matter of ease of reference. The same email
from Edward enclosed the Defendant’s Risk Assessment, Safe Work Procedures,
Method Statements, details of the Defendant’s workers, and the Defendant’s
“Project Organisation Chart”. 65

##### Foot Note 65

×

Edward’s AEIC at p 196.

This supports the view that Edward was, in that email, representing to CNQC as
the main contractor, that the Defendant was the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor for
the Project.

48 Indeed, CNQC would have no reason to otherwise deal with the Defendant, if
it were not the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor. The Defendant would also be
eligible for the MYE allotment secured by CNQC for the Electrical Project from
MOM, only if it was a sub-contractor of the Plaintiff, ie, it was one of the
parties involved in the Electrical Project. By its representation to CNQC, the
Defendant was indicating that it accepted being the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor
and would be proceeding with the works in that capacity. The only manner in
which the Defendant could be the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor for the Project
was to accept the terms of the Revised Quotation, which was the Plaintiff’s
offer on the table.

49 The Defendant cited the case of L & M Equipment Pte Ltd (formerly known as
L & M Engineering Logistic Pte Ltd) v Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co
Ltd and Others [1999] SGHC 182 (“L&M”) in which the court found that there was
no contract between the sub-contractor and the sub-sub-contractor,
notwithstanding the fact that latter had already commenced work at the
former’s request.

50 However, the circumstance of that case is different from the present case.
In L&M, the court reasoned that (a) the sub-sub-contractor negotiated directly
with the main contractor without involving the sub-contractor; (b) the written
agreement between the sub-sub-contractor and the sub-contractor was never
signed; and (c) the parties had not agreed on the valuation of work for
interim payments (at [40]–[41]). In the present case, the evidence shows that
the Defendant liaised directly with the Plaintiff in relation to the
Electrical Works. The Revised Quotation bore the signatures and company stamps
of the parties. Tender Addendum No 4 to the Revised Quotation also provided
the breakdown prices of the Defendant’s work. 66

##### Foot Note 66

CBD at pp 30–37.

51 Moreover, the Defendant prepared and submitted payment claims to CNQC in
its capacity as the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor for the Electrical Project. The
progress claims from the 1st progress claim in January 2020 to the 5th
progress claim dated 22 May 2021, were prepared by the Defendant and sent to
CNQC. In the payment claims prepared by the Defendant, Edward included items
which were not in his original Quotation, but which were in the Main Contract.
67

##### Foot Note 67

×

CBD at pp 37 and 555.

Edward accepted that he was claiming for these items based on what was in the
Main Contract. This undermines his claim that there was no agreement between
the Plaintiff and the Defendant.

52 The Defendant refers to other incidents to support Edward’s version of
events, but I find that these do not support him.

53 First, Edward claims that when the Plaintiff’s Angelia sent an email to
Edward on 23 December 2020, saying “[p]lease find the contract for Forett and
we would like to arrange a meeting on next Tuesday at 2pm in our Toh Guan
Office”, Edward’s understanding was that the meeting was intended to discuss
the terms of the proposed sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant
now that the sub-contract with CNQC has been finalised. 68

##### Foot Note 68

×

Edward’s AEIC at [61], p 117.

However, there is nothing in Angelia’s email that indicates so. It simply
states that the Plaintiff would like to arrange a meeting with the Defendant.

54 Second, Edward relies on his WA correspondence with Gary on 13 January
2021, which is set out below: 69

##### Foot Note 69

×

Edward’s AEIC at [88]–[89], p 273.

Edward: Boss the following are the things I need to resolve to move forward 1.
our contract confirmation with breakdown 2. Get our first claim in. 3. Settle
MYE support 4. Site dormitory issue. 5. Site is chasing for temp supply work.
including licensing and incoming. We have not received any payment till date
to cater for the above high running cost ... Our claims easily reach $100k

Gary: Wait. I finish meeting will look into it

[emphasis in original]

55 The Defendant submits that it was clear from Gary’s response that there was
no binding agreement on any sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the
Defendant. 70

##### Foot Note 70

×

Edward’s AEIC at [89].

However, an examination of this WA correspondence indicates that what Gary was
looking into were operational issues arising from the Electric Project, rather
than issues regarding an agreement. A key concern raised by Edward in his 13
January 2021 WA message, was that the Defendant’s claims “easily reach $100k”
based on work done to date but they had not “received any payment till date to
cater for the above high running cost”. Gary’s response “will look into it”,
thus appears to be him looking into the payment issue, rather than the terms
of the agreement.

56 In summary on this issue, on an examination of the evidence, including the
Defendant’s subsequent conduct, I find that by Edward’s email dated 24
September 2020 to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had accepted the Plaintiff’s
counter-offer as set out in the Plaintiff’s email dated 22 September 2020 and
the Revised Quotation. These contained the essential terms such as the name of
the parties, scope of work, contract period and price.

57 For completeness, the Defendant also argued that there could not have been
a binding agreement as of 24 September 2020 because the Revised Quotation
contained the following words inserted by the Plaintiff: “This quotation
approved in principle and pending official main contractor’s contract”. 71

##### Foot Note 71

×

Edward’s AEIC at [47], pp 100 to 108; Lawrence’s AEIC at [43], pp 204 to 212.

58 Gary testified that what the Plaintiff intended by saying “pending main
contractor’s contract” was to state that the agreement between the Plaintiff
and the Defendant would be called off if CNQC subsequently did not appoint the
Plaintiff as a sub-contractor. This had to be so as there would then be no job
for the Plaintiff, and consequently for the Defendant to do. The plain text
supports such an interpretation. It also accords with the commercial realities
for the parties.

59 I am accordingly of the view that the reference to “pending main
contractor’s contract” did not negate the parties’ intention to be legally
bound by the essential terms set out in the Revised Quotation and Confirmation
Email on 24 September 2020. Rather, the legal effect of this clause is to
allow parties to terminate their agreement if the Main Contract is not awarded
to the Plaintiff.

60 In any event, the Main Contract was eventually concluded between CNQC and
the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff subsequently emailed the Defendant the Main
Contract by email on 23 December 2020 and arranged a meeting with the
Defendant. Gary, the Plaintiff’s Mr Dan Ling, and Edward met at the
Plaintiff’s office on 29 December 2020.

61 Notwithstanding the fact that there remained some unresolved issues between
the parties after the 29 December meeting, the Defendant did not raise any
objections to the existence or validity of its contract with the Plaintiff.
The Defendant continued to carry out works on the Electrical Project and did
so until end April 2021 when it stopped work. The Defendant even prepared and
sent to CNQC the first progress payment claim in January 2021, which was based
on the contract sum stated in the Main Contract and in reliance on the payment
milestones provided for different work items as set out in the Main Contract.
These circumstances suggest that there must have been a binding contract
between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.

62 Therefore, even if I accept the Defendant’s case that there was no binding
contract between the parties as of 24 September 2020 pending the conclusion of
the Main Contract, I am of the view that there must have been a binding
agreement between the parties as of 23 December 2020 when the Main Contract
was concluded and sent to the Defendant.

What were the terms of the agreement?

63 Following from the above analysis, the terms of the agreement would include
the terms set out in the Confirmation Email and the Revised Quotation.

64 There was, however, no clear indication that the Defendant accepted all the
terms contained in the Main Contract. As explained above, the “back-to-back”
clause in the Revised Quotation did not have the effect of incorporating the
Main Contract terms as of 24 September 2020, since the Defendants had not even
seen the Main Contract then. When Angelia emailed the Main Contract to Edward
on 23 December 2020, there is no written confirmation from Edward that he
accepted the terms of the Main Contract. The Plaintiffs had in the same email
forwarding the Main Contract to the Defendant, asked to meet with the
Defendant. This took place on 29 December 2020. There is no evidence that
Edward agreed to all the terms in the Main Contract at the 29 December 2020
meeting.

65 On 8 January 2021, Edwards asks Gary by WA: “Bond settle already a not”, to
which Gary replied “Processing”, which suggests the Plaintiff was sorting out
the issues with the performance bond with CNQC. Under clause 27.2 of the Main
Contract, the sub-contractor must furnish an unconditional performance bond to
the main contractor, CNQC. If this was truly a “back-to-back” contract in the
manner argued by the Plaintiff, the Defendant should be liable for all of the
Plaintiff’s obligations under the Main Contract and should be expected to
issue the performance bond to CNQC under clause 27.2. However, Gary’s reply
suggests that the Plaintiff was responsible for issuing the performance bond.
This undermines the Plaintiff’s case that every term in the Main Contract was
automatically incorporated into the sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the
Defendant pursuant to the “back-to-back” clause.

66 Furthermore, in Edward’s 13 January 2021 WA messages to Gary as set out at
[54] above, Edward informed Gary that he would need certain issues resolved
before he could move forward, which included the MYE and site dormitory
issues. This further indicates that the parties have not come to an agreement
on all the terms of the Main Contract. In addition, Gary sent a WA message to
Edward on 8 March 2021, saying: “U free either tmr or Wednesday. Can we meet
up and wrap up the forette contract.” 72

##### Foot Note 72

×

CBD at p 698.

This suggests that there were still issues on the Main Contract to wrap up.
When cross-examined on this by Defendant’s counsel, Gary explains: 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

18 July 2022 Transcript at p 128, lines 11 to 17.

What I mean by wrap up on Forett contracts, it might be other issues. It might
be pertaining to payment issue, it might be pertaining to bond issues,
okay?... So doesn't mean that wrap up the Forett contract, that means to
conclude that I will award the contract to you. No, this is not my intention.

Even if Gary’s evidence is taken as it is, his testimony reinforces that there
were issues under the Main Contract that were not resolved, such as the bond
issue.

67 As set out above, the contract price and the work scope of the Main
Contract were within the general appreciation and knowledge of the parties and
would be incorporated by the back-to-back clause. Moreover, the evidence is
that the Defendant relied on the overall contract price and the price
breakdown of items contained in the Main Contract, to make its progress
claims. I find that even if not incorporated by the back-to-back clause in the
Main Contract, by such conduct, the Defendant did accept these terms of the
Main Contract. I will deal with the other terms of the Main Contract below.

68 The Defendant submits that if there is a binding agreement between the
parties, the terms of agreement would also include the following terms
(“Negotiated Terms”): 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

DOS at [15]; Edward’s AEIC at [38].

(a) Upon CNQC certifying the Plaintiff’s works, whether by a payment
certificate or otherwise, the Defendant would be entitled to 92% of the value
of the sum certified by CNQC, while the Plaintiff was entitled to the
remaining 8%, regardless of whether CNQC had paid the Plaintiff (“Payment
Term”).

(b) The Defendant would be allocated with 20 MYE per year (instead of 50
during the entire duration of the Project) (“MYE Term”).

(c) The Plaintiff and/or CNQC shall provide an on-site dormitory to
accommodate the Defendant’s workers (“Dormitory Term”).

69 The Defendant claims that the Negotiated Terms were orally agreed at the 21
September 2020 meeting. The Plaintiff denies this and says that it could not
have done so because it was unable to provide 20 MYE or on-site dormitory
accommodation at that time, as these were subject to CNQC’s confirmation.

70 I do not find sufficient evidence that the MYE Term, Dormitory Term and
Payment Term were agreed on by the parties. Rather they were points of concern
that were highlighted by the Defendant, but which the Plaintiff had yet to
accept as part of their agreement, such that it would be bound to them.

71 First, in relation to the MYE Term, it is accepted by parties that MYE is
allocated by MOM to the main contractor of a project. Edward accepted that as
of 21 September 2020, neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendant knew if CNQC
would be giving them 20 MYE for the Electrical Project. 75

##### Foot Note 75

Gary and Lawrence testified that they would want to support the Defendant with
the MYE that CNQC would allocate for the project, but they could not have
promised 20 MYE at that time, since CNQC had not firmed up the allocation. 76

72 Lawrence and Gary’s evidence is supported by Edward’s WA discussion with
Allan Tan (representing Plaintiff) in January 2021, the material parts of
which are set out below: 77

##### Foot Note 77

×

CBD at pp 688-689.

Edward: We need the MYE very soon boss

Edward: Still haven’t come back?

...

Allan Tan: Already talk to [CNQC’s] CM & write in to request for it

Edward: Thank you very much!

...

Allan Tan: Confirmed 500k one mye

Edward: This one overkill sia

...

Edward: My lowest recently is $250k for 1 MYE

Edward: Your one shock my life

...

Allan Tan: CM also say need additional mye later talk & write in to PM to
request

73 The above conversation between Edward and Allan Tan reinforces my view that
the issue of the exact number of MYE has not been settled between the parties
as of January 2021. Notably, Edward did not object or say that 20 MYE was
promised by the Plaintiff in their meeting on 21 September 2020.

74 Second, in relation to the Dormitory Term, Edward accepted that the
Plaintiff was agreeable to provide the dormitory subject to confirmation from
CNQC that they would provide the same. 78

##### Foot Note 78

provision of the dormitory. 80

##### Foot Note 80

Transcript 19 July 2022, p 135, lines 16 to 23.

75 Third, in relation to the Payment Term, Edward’s evidence was that the
Defendant would be entitled when CNQC certifies the Plaintiff’s work, by
payment certificate or otherwise. The latter phrase “or otherwise” meant that
if the Project Manager signed-off on the works in the Payment Claim, the
Defendant would be entitled to the signed-off sum, even if CNQC subsequently
certified a lower sum in the Payment Certificate. 81

##### Foot Note 81

×

Transcript 20 July 2022, p 9, line 23 to p 14, line 14.

Edward agreed when it was put to him by counsel, that there was no agreement
on the Payment Term as he had set out at [38(a)] of his AEIC, since it was
clearly very unusual and would result in DSL having no control over the
payment process and in effect, give up their margins in some instances. 82

##### Foot Note 82

×

Transcript 20 July 2022, p 24 lines 2 to 8.

76 Consequently, I find that there was no agreement on the MYE, Dormitory or
Payment Terms and consequently no breach thereof.

Defendant’s cessation of work

77 I will next address whether the Defendant was justified in ceasing work.
The Defendant did so by way of a Notice on 22 May 2021 through its solicitors
whereby it informed the Plaintiff that it would “cease work forthwith”. 83

##### Foot Note 83

×

Edward’s AEIC at p 324.

As the Plaintiff has accepted that the Defendant had done work and that even
if there is no agreement, the Defendant is entitled to bring forth claims for
quantum meruit, the issue of the Defendant’s cessation of work does not affect
the Defendant’s claims for work done. Instead, it goes towards the Plaintiff’s
claim for a declaration that the Defendant indemnifies the Plaintiff for all
the losses and damages that CNQC as the main contractor claims against the
Plaintiff due to the termination of the Main Contract.

78 Both parties cite RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another
appeal [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“RDC Concrete”). There, it was held that where a
contract does not clearly and unambiguously provide for the event or events
pursuant to which an innocent party is entitled to terminate the contract, the
innocent party may be entitled to terminate under four possible situations (at
[91]–[101]). The two relevant situations in the present case are Situation
3(a) and Situation 3(b), as follows:

(a) “Situation 3(a)”: where the term breached was a condition, ie, that it is
one that is so important that any breach, regardless of the actual
consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent party to terminate
the contract (RDC Concrete at [97]).

(b) “Situation 3(b)”: where the breach in question will give rise to an event
which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit
which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract (RDC Concrete at
[99]).

79 The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff’s refusal to provide the 20 MYE
and the on-site dormitory would fall under Situation 3(a) or Situation 3(b) of
RDC Concrete, given the importance and necessity to the Defendant of having
the MYE and on-site dormitory as cost-saving measures. As I have found that
the MYE Term and Dormitory Term were not part of the agreement, there is no
foundation for this legal submission of the Defendant.

80 The Defendant also submits that it is entitled to terminate the contract
because the Plaintiff failed to furnish the performance bond to CNQC, which
effectively caused CNQC to withhold the equivalent amount in their
certification of progress claims, with the material consequence that the
Defendant would not be paid for the works carried out. As of 7 May 2021, about
eight months after the Defendant had commenced work on the Project, it had not
received a single progress payment for the work done on the Project despite
CNQC having certified the sum of $161,349 in the value of works carried out
(without taking into account the sums withheld for the performance bond). The
Defendant argues that the Plaintiff’s repeated and prolonged failure to pay
amounted to a repudiatory breach which entitled it to treat the Plaintiff as
having repudiated the sub-contract.

81 On the evidence, I am of the view that the issuance of the performance bond
was the Plaintiff’s responsibility. The parties’ subsequent conduct and
correspondence were consistent with Edward’s testimony that the parties agreed
for the Plaintiff to issue the performance bond to CNQC. Notably, under the
Defendant’s quotation, there was no mention of any issuance of performance
bond on the part of the Defendant. Even in the Revised Quotation, the
Plaintiff did not include any terms requiring the Defendant to issue a
performance bond, despite adding two new clauses at the bottom of the page.

82 The parties’ WA correspondence further supports the view that the Plaintiff
bears the responsibility to issue the performance bond:

(a) On 8 January 2021, Edward asked Gary: “Bond settle already [or] not boss
[?]”, to which Gary responded “[p]rocessing”. 84

##### Foot Note 84

Edward’s AEIC at p 272.

(b) On 1 April 2021, Edward sent Gary a screenshot of his correspondence with
CNQC in which CNQC informed Edward that “[for your information] contract &
performance bond is required before we can proceed payment ... [please] check
with [DSL] how long can revert to us for performance bond.” Gary replied “I am
now waiting for their revised contract clause for the PG. [O]nce the revised
copy out then I will proceed with the issuance of bond.” 85

##### Foot Note 85

Edward’s AEIC at pp 279–280.

(c) On 6 April 2021, Edward asked Gary about the progress payments and Gary
replied, “But nobody expect[ed] the unconditional bond so hard to punch
through, is never in my plan to pay so much for bond”. 86

##### Foot Note 86

×

Edward’s AEIC at p 282.

(d) More importantly, on 13 April 2021, Gary messaged Edward over WA and asked
Edward if Triumph Electrical could “take over fully” because it made no sense
to him to “pay so much on the bond and profit so little”. 87

##### Foot Note 87

×

Edward’s AEIC at p 283.

83 All these suggest that at all material times, the parties’ understanding
was that the Plaintiff was responsible for issuing the performance bond to
CNQC. If the Defendant was obliged to issue the performance bond to CNQC,
there would be no reason for Gary to request the Defendant to take over in his
WA of 13 April 2021. Gary sought to explain this by saying that it is a matter
of how he treated his sub-contractor and that he was prepared to take up the
bond to help his subcontractor if “the sum is not huge”. 88

##### Foot Note 88

Transcript 18 July 2022, p 89, lines 7 to 10.

However, that does not explain why he did not simply inform the Defendant that
the Defendant had to fulfil its contractual obligation to execute the
performance bond in favour of CNQC. Instead, he approached Edward with a
request for the Defendant to issue the performance bond, which Edward
rejected.

84 Failure to make payments can amount to a repudiatory breach if they are
prolonged and substantial. In such circumstances, it may be inferred that this
demonstrates an intention not to be bound by payment obligations. The Court of
Appeal in Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd v Zhong Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd
[2021] 2 SLR 510 summarised the position on this at [96]:

… There may be instances in which a persistent course of payment delays, or a
protracted delay in the payment of a very substantial sum amounts to a
repudiation of the contract: see for example AL Stainless Industries Pte Ltd v
Wei Sin Construction Pte Ltd [2001] SGHC 243 at [194], citing Chow Kok Fong,
Law and Practice of Construction Contract Claims (Longman, 2nd ed, 1993) at p
264. However, not every instance of non-payment by a contracting party will
suffice to constitute repudiation. This was made clear in Jia Min Building
Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd [2004] 3 SLR(R) 288 (“Jia Min”) at
[55], where the court stated, citing Lubenham Fidelities and Investments Co
Ltd v South Pembrokeshire District Council (1986) 33 BLR 46: ‘[i]t appears
settled law that a contractor/subcontractor has no general right at common law
to suspend work unless this is expressly agreed upon. This is so even if
payment is wrongly withheld’. The court also cited Halsbury’s Law of
Singapore, vol 2 (LexisNexis Singapore, 2003 Reissue) at para 30.321, Keating
on Building Contracts (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th ed, 2001) at para 6-96 and
Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts, vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 11th ed,
1995) at para 4-223 for the same principle. The rationale for this, the court
explained, was that ‘the existence of such a right [to suspend work upon the
other party’s failure to make payment] could create chaos within the building
industry if contractors were to muscle their way through disputes with threats
or actual threats or suspension instead of having their disputes adjudicated’
(at [57])…

85 In determining whether the failure to make payments amounted to a
repudiatory breach, the court will examine the circumstances surrounding the
non-payment in determining whether the non-paying party’s conduct demonstrates
an intention not to be bound by payment obligations.

86 In AL Stainless Industries Pte Ltd v Wei Sin Construction Pte Ltd [2001]
SGHC 243, the court found that the defendant’s non-payment of $90,000 for the
plaintiff’s progress claim amounted to a repudiatory breach because the
defendant withheld the entire sum of $90,000 for the third progress claim even
after it was recommended for payment by the Quantity Surveyor, due for payment
and after the defendant had agreed to pay the same. In addition, the entire
$90,000 was withheld without any attempts to assess the impact of the
plaintiff’s delay on the main contract or the cost of rectifying defects: at
[196]–[197]. In these circumstances, the court found that the defendant had
acted in an arbitrary and oppressive manner and was “quite content not to
abide by such obligations as and when they fell due if this suited its
purpose”: at [198].

87 In Brani Readymixed Pte Ltd v Yee Hong Pte Ltd and another appeal [1994] 3
SLR(R) 1004 (“Brani Readymixed”), the defendants were late by 22 days in the
payment of the bulk of the outstanding invoices. The court found that the
defendants were not merely stalling for time to make payment to the plaintiffs
and that they did not intend to pay the plaintiffs at all and held that these
amounted to a repudiation of the contract: at [18].

88 The court will also examine the extent of non-payment – whether there is a
complete failure to pay throughout the contract or whether the complaining
party has already been paid substantially for its progress claims. In Zhong
Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd v Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC
277, it was held that there was no persistent course of payments delays which
justified the defendant’s repudiation of the contract because prior progress
claims were not fully rejected but certified for lower sums, and the plaintiff
had substantially paid the amounts that were certified: at [70]–[77]. In
contrast, the present case is not one of underpayment. The Defendant did not
receive any progress payments for its eight months of work, because the
Plaintiff failed to issue the performance bond to CNQC, which resulted in CNQC
setting-off the progress payments from the outstanding performance bond sum.

89 The Plaintiff makes three submissions on this.

90 First, the Plaintiff submits that there were further certifications that
had to be carried out by the Plaintiff before payment was due to the
Defendant. 89

##### Foot Note 89

Plaintiff’s Further Closing Submissions dated 12 August 2022 (“PFCS”) at [25].

However, I note that the Plaintiff is not able to point to anywhere in the
documentation or correspondence that makes reference to such a requirement.
The Plaintiff mentions item 9 of the Revised Quotation which states “as per
progress claim”. However, this does not state that there has to be
certification by the Plaintiff before payment could be made. The Plaintiff
also refers to item 12 of the Revised Quotation which states “[t]o receive
payment certificate within 14 days” and submits that this must mean
certification by the Plaintiff and not CNQC. However, the clause itself does
not indicate that it must be the Plaintiff that certifies, rather than CNQC.
The context of their arrangement was such that even though the Plaintiff was
the sub-contractor of CNQC, the Defendant as the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor
would be executing the works for CNQC. Moreover, there is nothing in the
correspondence or documentation prior to the Notice to Stop Work on 22 May
2022, that indicates that the Plaintiff required the Defendant to be first
certified by the Plaintiff before it could be entitled to payment, even after
CNQC certifies payment. On the contrary, the correspondence between Gary and
Edward shows that the issue blocking payment was the performance bond and not
the lack of certification by the Plaintiff. This can be seen below from the
examination of the WA correspondence between them. I hence find no evidential
basis for this submission.

91 Second, the Plaintiff submits that the payments were not yet due to the
Defendant. The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant did not plead the date on
which payment was due from the Plaintiff, nor was it mentioned in Edward’s
AEIC. The Plaintiff cites s 8(2) of the Building and Construction Industry
Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) which provides that where parties
have not agreed on the due date for payment in a construction contract,
payment is due to a GST-registered claimant within 14 days after the
submission of a tax invoice. 90

##### Foot Note 90

Plaintiff’s Skeletal Closing Submissions (“PSCS”) dated 25 July 2022 at [90].

This is not directly relevant since clause 12 of Revised Quotation itself
states that the Defendant is to “receive payment within 21 days from tax
invoice”. The Plaintiff argues that no tax invoices have been submitted by the
Defendant to the Plaintiff. As such, no payment was due to the Defendant.

92 The Defendant submits that Edward did seek to issue a tax invoice, but it
was Gary who asked Edward not to issue the tax invoice until the Plaintiff had
resolved the bond issues with CNQC. At [57] of Gary’s AEIC, he extracts a WA
message that Edward sent him on 23 March 2021 saying “Please help me with the
2 payments. Let me know when I can collect and issue Tax Invoice.” 91

##### Foot Note 91

×

CBD at p 699.

However, Gary only tells Edward to issue the Tax Invoice for another project
that the parties are engaged in, namely “TC16”. In respect of the Electrical
Project, he informs Edward instead that “[he] will be meeting CNQC [tomorrow]
to discuss the payments also”. By this time, CNQC had already certified two
progress claims prepared by the Defendant and submitted by the Plaintiff.

93 The parties’ WA correspondence on 23 March 2021 suggests that the parties’
working relationship was one where Edward will seek Gary’s instructions before
issuing any tax invoices. Edward was clearly seeking the Plaintiff’s
instructions as to whether he should issue tax invoices for the two projects.
Gary permitted Edward to issue Tax Invoice for TC16 but not for the Electrical
Project, saying that he would meet with CNQC to discuss payments on the next
day.

94 Notably, when Edward chased Gary for payment again on 26 March 2021, Gary
informed Edward on the same day “Bro. Next week Tuesday can collect payment”.
92

##### Foot Note 92

×

CBD at p 700.

Gary did not mention that he needed Edward to issue the tax invoice before he
could receive the payment.

95 The payment did not happen on Tuesday. On 1 April 2021, Edward asked “Boss
Settled already??? My cash flow dry up [already]”. 93

##### Foot Note 93

×

CBD at p 700.

Gary responded that he was waiting for the revised contract clause for the
performance bond. Once again, Gary did not indicate that payment was not made
to Edward because Edward did not issue any tax invoices – his sole concern
appeared to be the performance bond.

96 More importantly, on 13 April 2021, after Gary asked Edward to take over
for fully, Gary said “No matter what will still settle your payment. But bcos
[sic] if CNQC don’t confirm the bond I can’t proceed also”. 94

##### Foot Note 94

×

CBD at p 701.

This clearly suggests that Gary was not prepared to make the payment to Edward
until the bond issue was resolved. There was no discussion, or even
contemplation, between the parties about Edward issuing a tax invoice for the
progress payments, because DSL was not prepared to make payment until the bond
issue was resolved.

97 Following from this evidence, and the finding above that parties agreed
that the Plaintiff will issue the performance bond to CNQC, I find that:

(a) the parties’ working relationship and common understanding was for the
Defendant to confirm with the Plaintiff that payment would be made first,
before issuing any tax invoices;

(b) the Defendant did not issue the tax invoice in the present case because
the Plaintiff was not prepared to proceed with payment until it could
renegotiate the bond issue with CNQC; and

(c) as the Plaintiff was the one that told the Defendant not to issue the tax
invoice until it resolved the bond issues, the Plaintiff cannot now rely on
that to deny the Defendant payment for work done.

98 Third, the Plaintiff submits that its alleged failure to make payment is
not prolonged or substantial. Based on the undisputed facts, CNQC’s first
payment certificate was issued only on 15 February 2021. The second and third
payment certificates were issued on 6 and 19 April 2021. When the Defendant
ceased work at the end of April 2021, the first payment was 53 days late and
the second payment was only 3 days late. The total amount payable, as of 30
April 2020 was $140,713.08, which is about 2.2% of the $6,348,000. The
Plaintiff argues that this is not a substantial delay given that the
Electrical Works were to be carried out over thirty-four months, and that the
unpaid sum was also not substantial compared to the contract sum. 95

##### Foot Note 95

×

PSCS at [97].

99 However, as mentioned above at [87], in Brani Readymixed, the court found
that the defendants’ 22-day delay in the payment of the bulk of the
outstanding invoices amounted to a repudiatory breach because the
circumstances suggested that they did not intend to pay the plaintiff at all.
Hence the duration of non-payment is not determinative in itself. It must be
viewed in light of whether there is an intention on the part of the non-paying
party to pay the other party in the first place. Neither is the percentage of
the total contract sum determinative. It has often been said that cash flow is
the life blood of those in the building and construction industry: W Y Steel
Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd [2013] 3 SLR 380 at [18]. It would hence
be a relevant consideration in construction contracts whether the non-payment
of progress payments would result in the sub-contractor’s cashflow running
dry.

100 On the evidence, the Defendant had carried out work since September 2020
and was not paid a single cent even as of May 2021. This is despite CNQC
having certified the sum of $161,349 in the value of works carried out over
three progress claims. The Plaintiff asserts that the amounts which CNQC has
certified were payable had been deducted as part of CNQC’s performance bond
requirement. It would appear that CNQC was entitled to do so, on the basis of
clause 27.2 of the Main Contract.

101 First, I note that it is not clear on the evidence that the Plaintiff had
not been paid at all by CNQC. CNQC’s 3rd Payment Response issued on 19 April
2021 states that there is an amount of $82,800 that had been “previous[ly]
paid”. 96

##### Foot Note 96

×

Edward’s AEIC at p 348.

From the calculations in CNQC’s payment certificate, this amount was not
deducted from the sums that CNQC held back in lieu of the performance bond. In
addition, there is a payment summary list that shows net payments over
tranches, of $145,214.10 made by CNQC to DSL as of March 2021. 97

##### Foot Note 97

×

CBD at p 550.

This is also supported by the 3rd Progress Claim submitted by DSL to CNQC
(prepared by Edward), which accepts that CNQC had previously made a payment of
$82,800. 98

##### Foot Note 98

×

CBD at p 547.

102 On the stand, Gary maintained that CNQC had not paid the Plaintiff and
that the Plaintiff had not received monies from CNQC. However, he was not able
to explain why CNQC would state that it had paid the Plaintiff in these
documents. Gary could only maintain that the CNQC document was wrong, but he
had no evidence to refute it and show that the Plaintiff had not been paid.

103 Even if Gary’s evidence that the Plaintiff has not received monies from
CNQC is true, the evidence shows that not all the $161,349 that CNQC had
certified, were applied to the deduction for the Performance Bond. That is
what DSL’s own 3rd Progress Claim to CNQC shows. Edward also testified that
the deductions made by CNQC towards the performance bond only started from the
2nd Progress Certification onwards. 99

##### Foot Note 99

His testimony is supported by the Payment Certificates. In other words, at
least $82,800 out of the $161,349 that CNQC certified, was not held back
because of the Performance Bond, contrary to what Gary testified. There is no
evidence as to why this was sum withheld from the Defendant. On the face of
the documents, the Plaintiff was entitled to $82,800 as part of certified
payments from CNQC, and the Defendant was entitled to 92% of that sum, for
which they were not paid.

104 Second, the prevailing context as of May 2021 was that it was not clear
that the Plaintiff had any resolution to the performance bond issue, which in
turn affected the payments from CNQC:

(a) Edward had indicated to Gary in his WA message on 1 April 2021 that his
cash flow had dried up and Triumph Electrical had been “running on no fuel for
4 months already”. 100

##### Foot Note 100

(b) As of 6 April 2021, Gary informed Edward that the bond issue is still
being worked out. Edward queries him saying “I thought we following Progress
claims certified?” Gary did not confirm that payment would follow on from the
progress claims that were certified but instead qualified it by saying “Yes.
But nobody expect the unconditional bond so hard to punch through. Is never in
my plan to pay so much for bond. Later I give u update.” 101

makes no sense to pay so much on bond and profit so little. Still need to
finance.” 103

to be ironed out and stated that if these issues were not completed, “the

also did not inform Edward of any resolution of the bond issue. 106

##### Foot Note 106

Transcript 20 July 2022 at p 76, lines 8 to 12.

106 I note that throughout their WA correspondence, there was no indication
from Gary to Edward on when payments could be made to the Defendant. As the
Plaintiff had not paid for the performance bond, CNQC had been making
deductions from the payments that were certified, as payments towards the
bond. As set out above, the resolution of the performance bond under the Main
Contract was a matter for the Plaintiff to resolve, not the Defendant. There
was no agreement that the Defendant would provide the performance bond
directly to CNQC. Thus, it was not the Defendant’s fault that CNQC was making
deductions from the certified payments towards the performance bond. Rather,
it was due to the Plaintiff’s failure to resolve the performance bond issue
with CNQC, that payments to Triumph Electrical were being held back.

107 Throughout this, there was no dispute that work had been done by the
Defendant from September 2020 to April 2021. In fact, CNQC itself had
certified payments on three occasions, for a total of $161,349. Moreover,
there was a payment that CNQC had agreed to, in the amount of $82,800, which
was not applied to the deduction for the performance bond, but which
inexplicably, was not paid out to the Defendant.

108 In the midst of this, the Defendant had consistently informed the
Plaintiff that it was running out of money. The Plaintiff in turn agreed that
the Defendant should be paid. But it never did so, nor did it give any
indication of when such payment would be forthcoming or for what amount.
Indeed, the Plaintiff would have added to the concerns and uncertainty of the
Defendant on 13 April 2021 by asking the Defendant to take over the bond
fully, stating that it makes no sense for the Plaintiff to pay so much on the
bond and profit so little. This would have reasonably suggested that DSL could
not resolve the performance bond issues. This would have meant a further
indeterminate period of complete non-payment to the Defendant, as CNQC would
continue offsetting the amounts certified to be payable towards the meeting of
the performance bond.

109 Gary did not give any indication to Edward that he would be paying the
Defendant, even after the bond was revised downwards by CNQC to 5%. As of
CNQC’s 3rd Payment Response, CNQC had deducted $62,414.10 as payments towards
the performance bond. Even with the bond reduced to 5%, that is from $960,000
to $480,000, there would still be approximately $414,585.90 of deductions to
be made by CNQC towards the performance bond. There was no clarity from the
Plaintiff of how long this would take to be resolved, before the Defendant
would finally get paid, or if the Defendant would eventually be able to
recover the sums that CNQC had deducted as payment towards the performance
bond. In these circumstances, it would be unfair to expect the Defendant to
continue working, after having received no payment at all for eight months
from DSL, and without any indication of when the next payment would be or for
how much if it carried on working. I thus find that the Defendant was
justified in terminating the agreement with the Plaintiff.

110 Consequently, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for a declaration that the
Defendant shall indemnify the Plaintiff for CNQC’s losses and damages, and
dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for the loss of profit of $552,000 arising from
the termination of the Main Contractor by CNQC.

Plaintiff’s claims of the Defendant’s breach of Main Contract

111 The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant has failed to adequately perform
various obligation under the parties’ agreement and the Main Contract: 110

##### Foot Note 110

PSCS at [85] to [89].

(a) the Defendant failed to produce shop drawings in Building Information
Modelling (“BIM”);

(b) the Defendant failed to provide full time supervision by an experienced
engineer/supervisor for the proper execution of works on site;

(c) the Defendant failed to provide a full time project manager based on-site;
and

(d) the Defendant failed to provide adequate manpower to ensure the progress
of the sub-contract work.

112 From the outset, it should be noted that the counsel for both parties did
not examine the witnesses on these alleged breaches by the Defendant at trial.

113 In relation to the Plaintiff’s claim that the defendant failed to produce
shop drawings, I note that clause 25 of Tender Addendum 4 of the Revised
Quotation provides that the Defendant undertook to “complete shopdrawings and
co-ordination drawings”. 111

##### Foot Note 111

##### Foot Note 112

Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) at [45A].

The Plaintiff did not cross-examine the Defendant on this point.

114 Most of the Plaintiff’s aforementioned claims, are based on clauses in the
Main Contract. As I have found above, the inclusion of the term “back-to-back”
in the Revised Quotation did not have the effect of importing all the terms of
the Main Contract into the parties’ agreement on 24 September 2020, because
the Main Contract had not concluded at that point in time. The question is
following the analysis in GIB Automation, whether such clauses would be
regarded as technical and particular clauses or within the general
appreciation and knowledge of parties, with only the latter incorporated.

115 The Plaintiff argued that Appendix 2 of the Main Contract should be
incorporated into the parties’ contract because the clauses are framed in a
general nature and set out the scope of the Electrical Works in broad terms.
The plaintiff cited clauses 6, 15 and 40 to show that these clauses seemed to
be within the “general appreciation and knowledge” of the defendant, since it
had done work pursuant to those clauses. 113

##### Foot Note 113

×

PFCS at [9].

116 However, the mere fact that some clauses in Appendix 2 are phrased in
broad terms does not obviate the need to analyze the individual clauses to
determine whether they fall within the “general appreciation and knowledge” of
the parties. I therefore proceed to determine whether the individual clauses
in Appendix 2 that the Plaintiff seeks to rely on are incorporated into the
parties’ agreement.

117 In relation to the requirement for submissions of drawings in BIM format,
which is set out in clause 59 of Appendix 2 of the Main Contract, the
Plaintiff argued that this was within the Defendant’s general knowledge, since
Edward testified on it. I note that the Plaintiff’s case did not proceed on
the basis that drawings in BIM format are the usual or default for such
construction contracts. There was no evidence to this effect. Rather, the
Plaintiff relied on Edward’s evidence that this was discussed during the 21
September Meeting. However, Edward’s testimony was that the parties agreed at
the 21 September Meeting that there was no need for Triumph Electrical to
provide BIM modelling. The BIM modelling would have been priced at
approximately $120,000 if it were included in the scope of works of the
proposed sub-contract between DSL and Triumph Electrical, and it was not
feasible to provide this at the price of $6.99m which was discussed. 114

118 Edward was not cross-examined on this. The Plaintiff submits that this
oral agreement was not pleaded and hence it did not cross-examine Edward on
it. However, what the Plaintiff is seeking to rely on, is the opposite of what
Edward testified in his AEIC, which is that there was no agreement to include
the requirement of BIM modelling. As it stands, the unchallenged evidence of
Edward is that the Defendant was told that there was no need to provide BIM
modelling. Given that the contract price was reduced significantly from the
initial $9m to $6.9m, such evidence is not incredible. I find that the
Plaintiff has not proven that there is a breach of the drawings in BIM format
obligation.

119 The Plaintiff submits that the obligation in clause 40 of Appendix 2 of
the Main Contract, should also be within the “general appreciation and
knowledge” of the parties and incorporated into their agreement. Clause 40
states that “The Sub-contractor shall provide full time supervision by
experienced engineer/supervisor for the proper execution of works on site”.

Gary’s AEIC at p 268.

The Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence that supervision by an “experienced
engineer/supervisor” would be within the “general appreciation and knowledge”
of contractors for a project of this nature. I consequently find that this has
not been incorporated into the agreement of 24 September 2020.

120 The Plaintiff also claims for the cost of a full-time project manager
(“PM”) for the period February to May 2021. 116

PFCS at [18].

Gary’s evidence is that Edward requested Gary sometime around December 2020 to
engage a full-time PM for one year and agreed that the Plaintiff could charge
this cost to the Defendant. Pursuant to this, the Plaintiff employed a full-
time PM and paid the PM $22,500 in salary for February to May 2021. Edward did
not deny this in his AEIC and Gary’s evidence on this at [113] of his AEIC was
not challenged at trial. The Defendant made no submission refuting this. I
hence allow this claim.

121 The Plaintiff also submits that the Defendant failed to provide sufficient
workers for the lightning protection and earthing works. Such a clause would
be within the general appreciation and knowledge of the Defendant. While the
invoices adduced by Gary states that the period of work is between March 2021
to June 2021, 117

the Plaintiff did not adduce any evidence as to why replacement workers were
required in March or April 2021. The Defendant’s worksheet of hours worked by
the Defendant’s workers, ends on 31 May 2021. 118

Agreed Bundle of Document (“ABD”) Vol VII at p 2210.

Edward accepted this document as final. He also accepted when asked, that his
company stopped work roughly around end April 2021. This would have been
before the Notice to Cease Work, which was issued on 22 May 2021. The
Plaintiff would hence be entitled to claim for damages for the inadequate
manpower on site from 1 May 2021 till 21 May 2021 when the agreement was
terminated.

122 In summary, I find that:

(a) the Plaintiff has failed to prove on a balance of probability, its claims
on the breaches of obligations in relation to the shop drawings, BIM format
drawings and provision of experienced engineer/supervisor; and

(b) the Plaintiff is entitled to its claim for the cost of engaging a full-
time PM from February to May 2021 and for damages for inadequate manpower for
the lightning and protection works from 1 May 2021 to 21 May 2021.

Conclusion

123 In conclusion, I find that the Plaintiff is entitled to its claim for the
cost of engaging a full-time PM from February to May 2021. The Plaintiff is
also entitled to damages for inadequate manpower for the lightning and
protection work from 1 May 2021 to 21 May 2021. The Defendant is entitled to
claim for 92% of the value of the work done prior to its termination of the
works on 22 May 2021. CNQC certified the works done at $197,264.56 in its
payment response dated 19 April 2021. In response to the court’s queries on
whether the amount certified by CNQC was $197,264.56 or the $214,418 claimed
by the Defendant, the Defendant took the position that the amount taken as
certified by CNQC should be $214,418 119

124 As this action is bifurcated and this tranche of the trial dealt only with
liability, evidence was not led or cross-examined in respect of issues
relating to the quantum of damages. Parties are to agree on the damages
arising from the above entitlements or have the quantum of damages assessed.

125 Both the Plaintiff and Defendant are only partially successful in respect
of the issues and their claims. Parties are to agree on costs, or in the event
that they are unable to agree, to submit their written submissions on costs,
within seven days of this judgment.
