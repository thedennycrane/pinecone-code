and the third respondent, Ng Phuay Khoon (“Phuay”), from the first appellant,
Huap Huat Rubber Company Sdn Bhd (“HHR”), on or after 1 January 1998, were to
be refunded by Siew and Phuay to HHR; and

(b) the “bonuses” or other moneys received by the first respondent, Kong Choot
Sian (“Kong”), from the second to fourth appellants – HHR Properties Sdn Bhd
(“HHR Properties”), HHR Trading Sdn Bhd (“HHR Trading”) and HHR Construction
and Supply Sdn Bhd (“HHR Construction”) – which were not provided for in his
contracts for services, were to be refunded to these companies.

2 Further to our judgment, we would clarify that:

(a) the payments received by Siew from HHR on or after 1 January 1998 total
S$86,000 and RM28,650;
