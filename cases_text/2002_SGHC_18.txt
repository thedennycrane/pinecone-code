**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

_

Introduction

_

1\. Steelcrete Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd (the plaintiffs) were
incorporated in Singapore in 1992 and are building contractors. James Low (the
defendant) is a businessman dealing in pet foods and is the regional wholesale
distributor for certain pet products (including dog/bird foods, accessories
and shampoo) while his wife is a professional pet groomer. The defendant had
also operated a pet shop for more than 15 years. In that regard, he owned/owns
a company Pets 'N' Pedigree Pte Ltd (previously known as Pet Resorts Pte Ltd).
The third party is a sole-proprietorship of one Chan Yew Fai (Chan) who is a
professional engineer by training and qualification.

_

  
The facts

_

2\. In 1996, the defendant decided to build/develop a farm for the purposes of
breeding, training and boarding dogs (the project). To that end and purpose,
he applied for and obtained, under an agreement dated 2 May 1996 (the lease) a
piece of leasehold land at Pasir Ris Drive 12 (the site) from the Primary
Production Department (PPD) which is now known as the Agri-Food & Veterinary
Authority of Singapore (AVA); the site was part of Loyang Agrotechnology Park.
Having secured the site, the defendant then called for tenders for the project
in November 1996. Nine (9) contractors (including the plaintiffs and the
defendant's own brother Low Teck Soon using his firm's name Plus Factor
Builder) tendered for construction of the project. However, none were awarded
the contract for the project when the tender closed on 27 November 1996 and,
the plaintiffs were refunded the deposit for their tender price of $1,613,289;
the project was held in abeyance.

3\. In January-February 1997, the plaintiffs' director Teo Hock Lee (Teo) was
contacted by the defendant and, following what Teo described as 'heavy
negotiations' between them which continued until May 1997, the plaintiffs were
awarded a contract for the project at the lump sum price of $1,270,000 (the
contract sum). Strangely enough, the plaintiffs and the defendant signed two
(2) contracts, prepared by Chan (on the defendant's instructions), based on
the Singapore Institute of Architects' (SIA) Building Contract (Lump Sum) both
dated 28 May 1997, one in the contract sum (the contract) and the other for
$1,613,289 (the second contract). Equally perplexing was the fact that before
the two (2) contracts were signed, Chan issued identical letters (2) of award
to the plaintiffs one dated 20 May and the other dated 26 May, 1997 (the
letters of award), the first in the sum of $1,270,000 and the other in the sum
of $1,613,289. The defendant appointed Chan as the 'Qualified Person' for the
project (for both 'structural' and 'architectural' works), as required under s
6(3) of the Building Control Act Cap 29, by a letter dated 2 July 1996 (the
letter of appointment) wherein he agreed to engage Chan as the principal
consultant, at a lump sum fee of $52,000.

4\. The plaintiffs' scope of works comprised the following:-

> a. | one indoor training ground building;  
> ---|---  
> b. | one office building;  
> c.  | one utility room building;  
> d.  | one residence;  
> e. | two catteries;  
> f.  | four kennels;  
> g. | internal driveway drain;  
> h.  | sanitary lines including chambers and sewerage treatment plant;  
> i.  | entrance culvert.  
  
which (according to the plaintiffs but not told to Chan until later) was
agreed to be constructed in three (3) phases with the third and final phase to
be completed by 31 December 1999, as required by PPD/AVA. According to Teo,
the following items were also discussed and agreed between the parties (but
denied by the defendant):-

> i. | there would be no retention sums;  
> ---|---  
> ii. | there would be no performance bond (amounting to 10% of the contract sum);  
> iii. | all progress claims would be submitted to the defendant for payment;  
> iv. | the third party would not issue interim certificates of payment;  
> v. | items in the second contract would be substituted/varied.  
  
I should add that the above items contradicted the terms of the two (2)
contracts signed by the parties as well as the letters of award as in the
latter, Chan had requested the plaintiffs to furnish a performance bond,
insurance and workmen's compensation policies to his office as soon as
possible. Teo prepared a hand-written work schedule (see AB280) which he said
the defendant agreed to as, subsequently he typed and faxed it to the
defendant who signed and faxed it back to him. Teo did procure insurance
policies for third-party liability (in the sum of $1,270,000) and workmen's
compensation (in the sum of $254,000) for the project.

5\. The plaintiffs commenced construction on the project on or about 1 October
1997, after receipt of the Building Plan Approval dated 29 September 1997.
Earlier, they had also received a Notice of Permit to Commence Works dated 7
June 1997. It was only when construction of the project was well underway,
namely on 16 July 1999, that Chan was requested by the defendant to administer
the contract. Prior thereto, up to 12 July 1999, the plaintiffs claimed (but
which the defendant denied) that the defendant himself administered the
contract. Chan’s office however did supervise the plaintiffs’ construction.
Whenever Teo or the defendant requested for inspection, Chan or his assistant
Chua Kay Soon Raymond (Chua) would visit the site. By July 1999, the
plaintiffs had submitted their 5th progress claim and had received part-
payments totalling $400,000 on their previous four (4) progress claims
(inclusive of GST amounting to $12,000). The balance of $411,224.91
outstanding on the earlier progress claims was not and never paid by the
defendant. The first three (3) progress claims of the plaintiffs were
addressed to Pet Resorts Pte Ltd while the 4th was addressed to Pets 'N'
Pedigree Pte Ltd; Teo testified this was at the defendant's request (which was
denied). The 5th progress payment was forwarded to Chan and was addressed to
the defendant. Because of the defendant's refusal/inability to pay the balance
on the plaintiffs' first four (4) progress payments, Teo alleged that it
caused the plaintiffs in turn to suffer cash flow problems.

6\. A meeting was held on 9 July 1999 (the first meeting) attended by Teo, the
defendant, the defendant's brother Low Teck Soon (Low), an architect Anthony
Lim Meng Siah (Anthony Lim) and Chua from Chan's office. At the meeting (as
minuted by Low), the defendant expressed concern over the works being behind
schedule; he requested a catch-up programme from the plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs did not agree with the minutes of the meeting because (according to
Teo) a number of items Teo brought up at the discussion were not recorded. He
denied that the plaintiffs were behind schedule or, that the defendant had
requested a work schedule from him in March 1998. Consequently, there was no
reason for him to provide a 'catch-up' programme as minuted. The first meeting
was followed by a second meeting on 12 July 1999 which Teo did not attend
because (he said) he was neither informed nor invited.

7\. By July 1999, the plaintiffs had completed the office block, utility room,
pet shop, kennels 3 and 4, main entrance fencing as well as the electrical
works. Teo claimed that as work progressed, the defendant made various changes
to the building plans (the indoor training ground was changed to a pet shop)
and postponed work on phases 2 and 3 due to lack of funds. Further, the
defendant revised the works to be done under the three (3) phases while
sometimes, changes were required by the relevant authorities, such as that
from sliding windows to adjustable louvre windows. The plaintiffs' solicitors
had written to Chan on 20 July 1999 (AB327) to record the substantial
variations to the original contract.

8\. Teo explained that the plaintiffs did not build the sewerage plant (under
the revised phase 1) because the (approved) building plans of Chan provided
for a 10- persons treatment plant; however, the PPD/AVA required the defendant
to provide a 30-persons treatment plant. The defendant was still considering
the cost of constructing the plant (for which Teo had given an estimate of
$100,000-$120,000) when the plaintiffs' services were terminated. I should
point out however, that the plaintiffs did not have any communication with the
PPD/AVA at any time. What they understood of PPD/AVA's requirements were
conveyed to them by the defendant and or Chan. Neither were they aware of the
terms of the lease awarded to the defendant (although Teo knew the deadline
from PPD for completion of the project was 31 December 1999). Consequently,
the plaintiffs were unaware whether their work schedule in 3 phases was
accepted by the PPD.

9\. The plaintiffs continued working (solely according to Teo) on the project
until 4 September 1999; they then received a certificate of termination dated
15 September 1999 from Anthony Lim, who had been appointed by the defendant to
take over from Chan as the 'Qualified Person' for the project. After some
delay (allegedly because the defendant denied them access), the plaintiffs
finally removed their equipment from the site on 3 November 1999.
Unfortunately by then (Teo said), the plaintiffs' charts and work programmes
could no longer be found. Chan's appointment was terminated by a letter from
the defendant's solicitors dated 4 September 1999.

10\. Notwithstanding that the project was uncompleted, the plaintiffs alleged
that the defendant used the completed structures without first obtaining a
temporary occupation permit (TOP), despite a written warning from Chan (in
1998) that it was illegal to do so. The defendant had stored his pet food
materials at the site since end 1997/early 1998 and, had leased out kennels
for dogs to third parties in 1998, including Alpha Dog Patrol Pte Ltd, even
before a proper sanitary and sewerage system was installed. Further, the
defendant visited the site at least 3-4 days every week. On those visits, Teo
would accompany the defendant as he went round the site to verify the work for
which the plaintiffs had submitted their progress claims.

_

  
The claim

_

11\. In February 2001, the plaintiffs commenced Suit 139 of 2001 claiming the
sum of $411,224.91 outstanding on progress claims nos. 1 to 4, the sum of
$42,660.54 on progress claim no. 5 and $5,000 (excluding GST of $1,429.81) for
additional works (relating to alteration of discharge canals). There was also
a claim for loss of profits amounting to $356,096.75 thereby bringing the
plaintiffs' total claim to $816,412.01. The plaintiffs had a third additional
claim for damages. The plaintiffs further averred that the termination
certificate issued by Anthony Lim was wrongful and invalid.

12\. In the (lengthy) defence and counterclaim the defendant:

> a. | denied the oral agreement set out in para 4(i) to (v) above;  
> ---|---  
> b. | contended there was no variation from the contract that the plaintiffs would build a 10-persons treatment plant at the sum of $20,470;  
> c. | denied there was a second contract in the amount of $1,613,289 or any other sum;  
> d. | denied there was a variation in the commencement date, that the project was to be completed in phases or that there was any change in the timeframe for completion namely, 18 months from the Permit/Notice of Commencement of Works, by 6 December 1998;   
> e. | contended that the plaintiffs failed to apply for an extension of time by 21 July 1999 as required by Chan;  
> f. | alleged that the plaintiffs failed in various material aspects to comply with all requirements relating to quality and workmanship (which he particularised);  
> g. | denied he visited the site on diverse dates to inspect the quality of materials and goods as alleged or at all;  
> h. | professed he had no knowledge of technical matters as a layman and relied on the integrity and expertise of the plaintiffs and Chan;   
> i. | alleged that the plaintiffs took advantage of his ignorance and misled him into making payment although interim certificates were never issued:  
> j. | averred he had no recollection of having requested for works outside the contract and denied he was liable for such works, for which no certificates were issued;  
> k. | denied he gave instructions to deviate from the approved plans;  
> l. | contended he was entitled to occupy some of the buildings with the consent of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs and Chan should have but failed to inform him that, a TOP had not been issued and they were to be blamed for any breach of the Building Control Act;  
> m. | denied Anthony Lim was not a Qualified Person. In any case, the plaintiffs had waived any objections to such an appointment by their solicitors' letter of consent dated 11 September 1999;  
> n. | alleged it was the plaintiffs not he, who had repudiated the contract as they were not willing and able to continue with the contract;  
> o. | contended that the works completed by the plaintiffs were worthless or worth no more than the sum of $400,000 he had paid.  
  
13\. Initially (April 2000), the plaintiffs commenced arbitration proceedings
against the defendant, pursuant to clause 37 of the conditions of the
contract. However, as Chan was not a party to either contract, he could not be
forced into arbitration with the parties. Arbitration proceedings were
therefore discontinued by order of court on 15 January 2001 (on the
defendant's application in Originating Summons No. 1876 of 2000 against the
plaintiffs and Chan under s 3 of the Arbitration Act [Cap 10] that it would
otherwise result in a multiplicity of proceedings) even though dates had
already been given after 9 months' of arbitration between the parties.
Clearly, the defendant was dragging his feet. The order of court went further
to direct that the plaintiffs commence fresh proceedings in the High Court and
set timeframes for the filing of pleadings; Suit 139 of 2001 was commenced as
a result. I should also mention that in another (earlier) set of proceedings,
(Originating Summons No. 1500 of 1999) the defendant applied for possession of
the site from the plaintiffs who then applied for a stay under s 7 of the
Arbitration Act, by reason of the arbitration clause in the contract. The
plaintiffs eventually withdrew their application while Originating Summons No.
1500 of 1999 was discontinued by the defendant.

14\. The defendant had separately sued Chan earlier in August 2000 in Suit No.
564 of 2000 alleging that the latter had failed to exercise all due
professional skill and care in the performance of his duties as the
defendant's principal consultant. I shall return to the defendant's
allegations against Chan in the course of my findings. On his part, Chan filed
not only a (lengthy) defence to the defendant's statement of claim but also a
counterclaim for the outstanding balance ($22,575) of his fees.

15\. On 15 March 2001, the court ordered Suits Nos. 564 of 2000 and 139 of
2001 to be consolidated, with the earlier suit being the primary action and,
that Chan be joined as the Third Party to the later action.

_  
The plaintiffs' case_

16\. The plaintiffs called two (2) witnesses. I have in fact outlined the
plaintiffs' case generally in paras 2-10 above. Consequently, I turn my
attention now to the further evidence adduced from Teo (PW1) under cross-
examination by counsel for the other two (2) parties. Questioned on why his
company signed two(2) contracts with the defendant, Teo revealed (N/E 49) that
he understood that the second contract was meant for financing reasons when
the parties went to Chan's office to sign both contracts; this was however
denied (N/E 75) by the defendant who claimed he was able to and financed the
project, personally.

17\. Although the defendant denied signing it, Teo said his letter dated 16
May 1997 (AB277) had been signed by the defendant when he delivered the
document personally to the defendant, and it confirmed the following terms:

> (i)  | the project would be in 3 phases with phase 1 to be completed in 6 months:  
> ---|---  
> (ii) | commencement date would be 2 weeks from receipt of permit to commence work;  
> (iii) | phases 2 and 3 would be discussed and fixed in due time;  
> (iv)  | liquidated damages would be $200/- per day.  
  
In turn, Teo faxed the document to Chan on 19 May 1997, according to the fax
transmission on the document; however when Chan testified (N/E 222), he said
he did not have the copy in his file. On 19 March 1998 the plaintiffs faxed to
the defendant a work schedule (see AB467 or 2AB533) for the three (3) phases
of the contract as follows:

Phase 1 | Expected commencement date | Expected completion date  
---|---|---  
Construction of utility | 1 Oct 1997 | 30 June 1998  
Construction of pet shop |  | (wrongly dated 31 June)   
Construction of Kennel 3 & 4 |  |   
Construction of external works  |  |   
|  |   
Phase 2 |  |   
Construction of kennel 1 & 2 | 2 Jan 1999 | 30 June 1999   
Construction of external works  |  |   
|  |   
Phase 3 |  |   
Construction of catteries 1 & 2 | 2 July 1999 | 31 Dec 1999  
Construction of office  |  |   
Construction of residence  |  |   
Construction of external works |  |   
  
Surprisingly, counsel for the defendant (N/E 23) took the position that the
defendant did not sign the above work schedule even though it was clear (from
the fax transmission details) that the defendant (after appending his
signature under the stamp of Pet Resorts Pte Ltd) faxed it to Chan and on the
following day, Chan's assistant Chua forwarded it in turn to the PPD (at
2AB534). This stand necessitated calling a representative from PPD/AVA to
testify. Under the above work schedule, the third and final phase was to be
completed by 31 December 1999, which deadline was confirmed by PPD in their
letter to Pet Resorts Pte Ltd dated 29 December 1998 (AB471). Teo testified
that since the defendant neither objected nor wrote to him as regards the work
schedule, he assumed that the commencement date for phase 1 would be 1 October
1997 and he proceeded on that basis. However, the commencement dates for
phases 2 and 3 were not adhered to as the defendant held him back. I also
should point out phase 1 of the work schedule agreed on 19 March 1998 differed
from the earlier one dated 19 May 1997 in that the latter included an office
and residence blocks, there was no pet shop whilst the kennels to be built
were 1 and 3 and not 3 and 4.

18\. It was Teo's evidence that when he received the letter of award with a
request to furnish a performance bond, he had telephoned Chan to say no bond
was required. Teo opined that Chan acted fairly and independently but the
defendant put pressure on Chan to terminate the plaintiffs' contract (N/E 35);
this testimony was corroborated by Chan (N/E 206) who said he was under
pressure by the defendant's brother Low, to impose liquidated damages on the
plaintiffs and to terminate their contract. Low had also insisted that the
plaintiffs furnish a bond for 10% of the full contract value (in July 1999),
against Chan’s suggestion that it should be based on the balance of the
contract. When Chan indicated there were no grounds to terminate the
plaintiffs’ contract, Chan’s own services were terminated. Although he was
aware that Chan was stated to be the quantity surveyor in the contract, Teo
said he knew Chan was not a quantity surveyor just as he knew (and so did the
defendant) that Chan was not an architect.

19\. Although he had agreed to commence work within 2 weeks of receipt of the
permit to commence work (dated 7 June 1997), Teo testified that the plaintiffs
could not do so as the building plans were approved much later (29 September
1997). In any case he contended that the permit to commence work did not form
part of the contract documents. Further, neither the defendant nor Chan wrote
to the plaintiffs to request that they commence work nor was a date for
commencement inserted into the contract. After signing the contract, the
defendant was still uncertain on the phases for the project. Even so, while
waiting for approval of the building plans, the plaintiffs mobilised their
equipment, workers and carried out site organisation work. I should point out
that according to the letter from the PPD dated 24 August 1998 (2AB542) to the
defendant, the latter was supposed to finish 5 of the 10 approved farm
structures by 29 September 1998; this the defendant failed to do as by
September 1998, only three (3) structures had been erected.

20\. Teo testified that amendments were made to approved drawings sometimes on
Chan's instructions and at other times at the personal (verbal) request of the
defendant including:-

> a. | dismantling the completed chain-link fence and constructing a brick wall instead with welded mesh on top;  
> ---|---  
> b. | dismantling the diseased animals ward and replacing with 2 rooms;   
> c. | constructing the kennels to the edge of the internal drain instead of to the edge of the kennel boundary so as to give the animals an opportunity to exercise;  
> d. | building a full brick wall without fence instead of a high fence with brick wall;  
> e. | constructing a concrete finish yard in place of a sand finish yard;  
> f. | repositioning and reducing the width of the drain running through the kennels;  
> g. | changing the glass windows in each block to adjustable glass louvres when approval was obtained to change the indoor training ground to a pet shop;  
> h. | changing the design of the main gate.  
  
Questioned by counsel for Chan, Teo testified he did not inform Chan of the
changes effected at the defendant's request; he felt it was the defendant's
duty to do so. As far as Teo was aware, neither did the defendant inform Chan.
As far as item 20(g) was concerned, he said the defendant complained of the
change in windows only _after_ the plaintiffs had commenced arbitration, well
after the louvre windows had been installed and seen at site by the defendant.

21\. Teo maintained that the 30-persons treatment plant was outside the
plaintiffs' scope of works in any event as, the plaintiffs' contractual
obligation was to build a 10- persons treatment plant. However, they were
informed by Chan that the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) would only approve
a 30-persons treatment plant. Teo then rendered a fresh quotation for such a
plant at the defendant's request which the latter rejected as too expensive.
Instead, the defendant obtained a quotation in the sum of $70,000 from another
contractor (Yong Yang Construction) in June 1999 to whom he counter-offered
$50,000 but, which was rejected (see AB528). Teo had then informed the
defendant that the work schedule needed to be adjusted as, the plaintiffs'
completion of phase 1 hinged on the 30-persons treatment plant which work the
plaintiffs had to co-ordinate with the defendant's contractor. However, the
defendant never raised the subject again after the first discussion on or
about 18 June 1999; neither did he appoint any contractor for the revised
treatment plant. Teo surmised it was because the defendant was in financial
difficulties.

22\. Teo disputed the defendant's claim of ignorance as a layman. On the
contrary, the defendant was a shrewd and experienced businessman who visited
the site regularly and was apprised on the works in progress by him and, the
defendant was able to vary the contract with regards to interim certificates.
Teo said the defendant was even able to provide a layout plan to Chan by a fax
dated 8 January 1997 (see 2AB79-80).

23\. As for the meeting on 9 July 1999, Teo said the concerns he raised were
not recorded, namely the urgency of the construction of the 30 persons
treatment plant and when the work under the remaining phases 2 and 3 should be
done. He disagreed with the minutes on these items:

> a. | the plaintiffs' work schedule was very much behind schedule;  
> ---|---  
> b. | the plaintiffs should submit a catch-up programme on 16 July 1999;  
> c. | that the plaintiffs had failed to furnish a banker's guarantee up to that date and were required to furnish one if they intended to continue with the contract;  
> d. | that the plaintiffs were in delay for about 12 months and liquidated damages were $200 per day;  
> e. | the plaintiffs were to apply to Chan for extensions of time.  
  
Consequently, he faxed (on 20 July 1999) the plaintiffs' undated letter to the
defendant to record his disagreement with the minutes.

24\. As stated in para 6 above, Teo was unaware of the second meeting held on
12 July 1999. However, it was attended by Chan (and Low) who wrote to the
plaintiffs on 16 July 1999 (AB291) referring to the same and requiring the
plaintiffs to submit that very day, progress claims for work done,
applications for extensions of time (substantiated), variations claims and a
programme for completion of outstanding works. When the plaintiffs (not
surprisingly) did not respond, Chan sent a reminder dated 20 July 1999 (see
AB293). However, Teo said he did forward to Chan evidence of the plaintiffs'
performance bond and insurance, after 19 July 1999. Teo reiterated that it was
orally agreed between himself and the defendant that no performance bond was
required as, if indeed it was called for, the plaintiffs would have had no
difficulty in coming up with a bond for $127,000 (10% of the contract sum).

25\. Questioned why the plaintiffs had contended (in their pleadings) that the
notice of termination issued by Anthony Lim was invalid, Teo explained it was
because the former had to be first registered with the Building Control
Authority as a 'qualified person' for the project before he could issue such a
notice.

26\. I had earlier mentioned the plaintiffs' claim for loss of (gross) profits
in passing. Cross-examined, Teo explained that his figure ($356,096.75) was
based on blocks he had not yet constructed but for which he had already
fabricated some trusses which he removed from the site and sold off as scrap
when the plaintiffs' contract was terminated.

27\. The plaintiffs' other witness was professional engineer Jonathan Portwood
(Portwood). The plaintiffs' quantity surveyor John Priestley was not called to
testify although he had filed his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. The reason
was because I had informed the parties at the outset that I was only
determining liability and quantum of the plaintiffs' claim, should I rule in
their favour, would be assessed by the Registrar at a later stage, with
further evidence on quantum to be adduced if necessary, from witnesses such as
John Priestley. For the same reason, the defendant's quantity surveyor Lim Ang
Beng Hock did not testify and neither did Chan's expert, professional engineer
Shek Kam Chew.

28\. Consequently, Portwood was the plaintiffs' only other witness. He was
appointed by the plaintiffs to check the welding works/trusses for the
buildings they had erected at the site. For the purpose, Portwood visited the
site on 28 May and 20 June 2001 and, he was provided with copies of:

> (i)  | the reports (3) of Setsco Services Pte Ltd (Setsco);  
> ---|---  
> (ii)  | the letter dated 19 May 2000 (with report attached) to the defendant from PP Project Consultants (Project Consultants);  
> (iii) | the (coring) test results of RAK Materials Consultants Pte Ltd (RAK)  
  
commissioned by the defendant. The several reports cast doubt on the concrete
strength and structural integrity of the buildings. In brief, Setsco had
reported that the weld sizes/thickness were below those specified in the
drawings, two (2) trusses were missing from the roof of the utility room while
some trusses were not fully/properly welded. Project Consultants' professional
engineer Looi Poh Yun (Looi) itemised eight (8) construction defects in his
aforesaid letter and made five (5) recommendations.

29\. In his written testimony, Portwood opined that while some welding
(kennels 3 and 4) were less than what had been specified in the drawings, they
were nonetheless of reasonable and consistent quality for that type of
building; the defects were certainly not life-threatening. Portwood said he
based his opinion on the PWD-approved structural drawings and the relevant
extract from the British Standards Code of Practice (see **P2**) applicable at
the time of construction. He testified he had climbed up the roof during his
inspection to check the welds of the trusses there. He disagreed with Setsco's
findings that the thickness was 3-5mm when the drawings called for 6mm; the
thickness appeared to be more like 4-5mm for what he believed were the
heaviest trusses for each building. However, he did observe that some bolts
and isolated welds were missing and recommended that they should be inserted
and welded respectively, save for truss number 3 in the utility room which was
not in the drawing and hence, could not be said to be missing.

30\. Portwood also criticised the coring tests carried out by Setsco; the
location plans for the tests were inaccurate and it was hard to tell where
they had carried out the coring for the tests conducted by RAK. Further,
although RAK’s report showed the office building contained low concrete
levels, his visual inspection indicated no signs of structural distress or
significant cracking in that area. The areas which indicated low concrete were
the external apron slabs of the pet shop, the utility room, kennels and the
office block. However, those were non-critical load bearing structures which
should be hacked up and the concrete recast. Portwood recommended that load
tests should first be carried out to determine whether the slabs needed to be
removed or merely strengthened. In that regard, Portwood testified that the
plaintiffs attempted to do a load test at the site on Saturday 30 June 2001
but could not gain entry. All other cores inside buildings showed acceptable
concrete strength, including the pet shop. The rusting of the kennels was
attributable to bird droppings and failure to remove the same; he produced a
summary (see **P3**) of his findings.

The defendant's case

_

31\. The plaintiffs' various allegations were all denied by the defendant as
reflected in his lengthy defence. This included denying having discussions
with the plaintiffs; he said his discussions were with Chan’s assistant. He
could not recall whether he had sent copies of the plaintiffs' first four
progress payments to Chan (N/E 100). He also denied he had agreed to the
change from sliding to louvre windows for the indoor training ground. He
maintained that construction of the sewage treatment plant had no bearing on
completion of the farm and denied (N/E 93) he was not interested to build the
treatment plant as at 6 December 1998 because he lacked the funds. I should
point out however, that the defendant's testimony was contradicted by that of
his own expert Looi (N/E 158) who confirmed that no TOP or partial TOP, can be
obtained for the project without a sewage treatment plant.

32\. In the initial stages of his oral testimony, the defendant repeatedly
prefaced his answer with the statement ‘ _I don’t know anything'_ to questions
from counsel for the other two (2) parties. Eventually, I interjected and
advised the defendant that such a stock answer did little to help his case.
Even then, I was prompted at a later stage (N/E 113) to remind the defendant
that his answer was highly unsatisfactory. When Chan testified (N/E218) and
was questioned by the court, he disagreed that the defendant _didn’t know
anything._

33\. I shall first set out the more significant aspects of the defendant’s
testimony. He alleged that his understanding that Chan was an architect as
well as a professional engineer came from Chan's assistant. He had told Chua
that any changes had to have written confirmation from him whereas the alleged
variation work of the plaintiffs was not. He denied he instructed Teo to do
additional works (which included installation of false ceilings in the pet
shop/utility room) notwithstanding numerous letters to him from the plaintiffs
confirming such additional works (see AB283 and 286) -- he only instructed
tiling for the office block (N/E 124). The defendant claimed he knew nothing
about building a pet farm let alone the training/breeding of dogs. He further
alleged that he paid the plaintiffs direct on their progress claims on the
advice of Chua (with whom he mainly dealt and who had told the defendant that
Chan/he were not involved in payments). He paid the plaintiffs without
checking that the works claimed for had been done; this was because he did not
understand interim certificates at the time and was not familiar with building
contracts. Yet in his fax to Chan on 9 July 1996 (see 2AB14), it was noted
that the defendant required Chan to include a title-deed land survey in Chan's
quotation of $52,000 to act as consultant. Questioned on this fax, the
defendant said he included the requirement on the advice of a neighbour
(Ericsson Pet Farm). The defendant was also able to pass drawings to Chan/Chua
to help them to design the pet farm; he said he obtained them from a very
famous company in the United States. He explained he was able to provide a
layout plan of the utility/storage room in his letter dated 8 January 1997
(2AB79-80) to Chan because both the letter and plan were drafted by Chua.

34\. The defendant said he was not told by Chan or Chua that Chan’s scope of
works did not include administration of the project; he denied he administered
the contract himself. If it was not Chan's responsibility to administer the
contract, the defendant wondered why he had to make eight (8) monthly progress
payments of $1,450 each to Chan, under the letter of appointment. When asked
why he had not corrected the minutes for the second meeting wherein it was
recorded (item 5.1) that Chan had stated he was not administering the
contract, the defendant said it was because he was more concerned with the
catch-up programme (N/E 102). He gave the same answer when questioned why he
did not rebut Chan's letter to him dated 16 July 1999 (2AB615) stating that
Chan would henceforth take over administration of the contract. When his
attention was drawn to his letter dated 6 August 1999 (AB480-481) to Chan
wherein he had itemised all the plaintiffs' works which were not in compliance
with drawings, the defendant said it was done on the advice of Low.

35\. Queried why he had signed the second contract, the defendant professed
ignorance (N/E 80-81) saying he signed many documents and did not know; the
question should be directed to Chan. Although he agreed that it was strange of
Chan to issue two (2) letters of award to the plaintiffs, the defendant said
(N/E 113) he merely filed up the second letter of award dated 26 May 1997
(AB279) for $1,613,289 – he may have thought Chan made a mistake, or he may
have overlooked it or he may have thought it related to the first letter of
award, notwithstanding the vast difference of $343,289 between the figures in
the two letters. Indeed, it was the defendant's evidence that most of the
time, he filed up the correspondence he received from the plaintiffs/Chan
without reading as _'he left the project to them'_ (N/E 129).

36\. Although the defendant initially claimed that he had handed a copy of the
lease to Chan such that the latter knew all the terms and conditions therein,
this was retracted under cross-examination. Similarly, under cross-examination
(N/E 111), the defendant agreed that construction was to be in three (3)
phases. Yet in the next breadth (N/E 112), he maintained it was still wrong of
Chan to allow construction in three (3) phases as alleged in his statement of
claim in Suit 564 of 2000. When he was shown Chan's letter to him dated 10
August 1999 advising him that occupation without a TOP was illegal, the
defendant also shifted his stand and said he was unaware of the requirement
when he first occupied the buildings in 1998. He further justified his
occupation by pointing to the fact that his neighbour Topbreed Trading had
occupied their premises for five (5) years before they obtained TOP. In any
case, Alpha Dog Patrol Pte Ltd helped him to look after the site. During
cross-examination (see N/E 117-118) the defendant withdrew his allegation that
he relied on the tender results in selecting the plaintiffs but he still
insisted that Chan failed to award the contract to a competent contractor.
Further, although counsel for Chan drew his attention to the fact that it was
the Central Building Plan Unit which required the construction of a 30-persons
treatment plant in June 1997 (see 2AB438), the defendant maintained his
pleaded case that it was Chan who had wrongfully allowed the 10-persons plant
to be varied.

37\. The defendant alleged that the plaintiffs' services were terminated
because they refused to provide a catch-up programme. Notwithstanding his
pleaded case that the plaintiffs' works were either worthless or only worth
what he had paid ($400,000) them, the defendant admitted that his only
complaint as regards kennels 3 and 4 was, they were rusty. Questioned by the
court, he agreed that if the rust could be rectified, he would accept the
kennels, subject to what his experts had to say. He claimed that although he
visited the site weekly, it was only for short periods to store his supplies.

38\. Although one of his main complaints against the plaintiffs was the delay
in completing the project (before he terminated their services), the defendant
only requested his new consultant Looi to obtain TOP in the last quarter of
2000 although he had appointed Looi (whom he first approached in the last
quarter of 1999) as early as 23 January 2000; the defendant could not explain
the delay.

39\. A senior officer from PPD/AVA, Lim Bock Seng (Lim), was called as a
witness on the plaintiffs' work schedule. Lim (DW2) confirmed that his
department did receive the work schedule on 23 March 1998 (see **D1**) from
Chan but its copy did not have the defendant' signature. Consequently, his
testimony did little to assist the court.

40\. Looi (DW3), a professional engineer (in civil engineering) was the
defendant's last witness. He was the author of the report by Project
Consultants relied on by the defendant to support the contention that the
buildings erected by the plaintiffs were structurally unsound. In his report
(**D2**) Looi said he studied the tender specifications and approved plans
when he was appointed by the defendant to take over from Chan. He then
inspected the site and discovered many discrepancies between what was
constructed and the specifications/plans as well as a number of defects.
Consequently, he had advised the defendant to defer applying for TOP until
details and other items were rectified.

41\. Looi's main complaint was the inadequate welding of the joints in the
steel structures and the inadequate thickness of the concrete slabs and
footings, which deficiencies were addressed by Portwood in his evidence (paras
28-30 _supra_). He had relied on the tests carried out by Setsco and RAK. Looi
was unyielding in his rejection of the plaintiffs' workmanship; he had
recommended to the Commissioner of Buildings (by his letter dated 18 June 2001
at 2DB3) that the office block should be demolished and rebuilt and, the other
structures rectified. When cross-examined, Looi agreed that rectification of
weak footings may not require such a drastic measure as demolition of the
entire building. He opined however, that load tests were unnecessary and
irrelevant for under-strength footings.

42\. Looi agreed with counsel for Chan there was nothing structurally wrong
with the concrete slabs as they sat on the ground, even though their thickness
was less than what was specified; admittedly, insufficient concrete in slabs
would not affect the buildings' safety although it meant that the plaintiffs
were short on quality. As for the concrete footings, Looi said he was prepared
to consider the plaintiffs' proposals to strengthen them by way of
rectification. However he refused to do the necessary calculations to
determine the actual strength of the footings, saying that was not his duty.
When shown the calculations (**TP5**) done by Chan, Looi did not disagree.
According to Setsco's tests, 2 out of 10 footings were unacceptable.

43\. Looi was prepared to accept Portwood's recommendation that missing bolts
and welds should be inserted where necessary. With regard to welds, Looi
agreed with Chan's counsel that SISIR's code of practice (2AB780C) provided an
acceptable standard. Looi's attention was drawn to the fact that SISIR's
standard for minimum thickness for welds in accordance with the approved
drawings was 3mm and, Portwood's summary (**P1**) of welds done by plaintiffs
based on Setsco's test results showed no welds were below 3mm; he then
admitted that the welds were not defective; he said he had relied on British
standards although Singapore standards were in no way inferior.

44\. Another criticism by Looi pertained to the inspection chambers, the
construction of which he alleged did not comply with MOE's Code of Practice
for Sanitary Plumbing and Drainage System (the Code) – they were incomplete,
had no proper concrete covers and there were holes in the ground. He
complained that the underground pipes (beneath the driveway) were made of PVC
instead of cast iron; the driveway was also not properly constructed, neither
was the drain (being constructed of bricks instead of concrete). Counsel for
the plaintiffs drew Looi's attention to the discrepancy between his finding
and that of the defendant's quantity surveyor Lim Ang Beng Hock, who said the
pipes were made of clay. That was again to be contrasted with the invoice of
the plaintiffs' plumbing sub-contractors OCS-Contractors Pte Ltd (dated 26
July 1999 at AB545) which stated that UPVC pipes were laid. Looi agreed with
counsel that unlike PVC, UPVC is an acceptable material for sanitary drainage
system, according to the Code. He volunteered the information that UPVC is
more heavy duty than PVC. When pressed by counsel for Chan (N/E 187), Looi was
unable to identify any provision/section in the Code that stipulated what
materials pipes must be made of.

45\. Photographs were attached to Looi's report which had been taken in
October 1999. Looi took new photographs in the first quarter of 2000 after his
appointment; these showed the inspection chambers in worse condition than that
reflected in his earlier photographs. It was revealed to Looi in cross-
examination by Chan's counsel, that the plaintiffs were not furnished with
plans for construction of the inspection chambers. Hence, the plaintiffs' only
recourse was to follow the specifications of MOE's Code for such construction.

46\. Although Looi's report had referred to trial holes he had made to check
the inspection chambers, he was unable to pin-point their locations; he said
he had made random checks. Neither was he on site when Setsco took concrete
core samples on 29 March 2001 for tests to be carried out, although done at
his request (when the defendant told him of this case). As such, Looi was
unable to confirm where the samples came from. Consequently, in the midst of
Looi's cross-examination and in the light of his disagreement with counsel on
the exact location of the pipes/inspection chambers, I directed all parties
(with their respective counsel) to visit the site.

47\. After the visit on 9 July 2001, it was reported back to me that all three
(3) parties agreed that the pipes between inspection chambers were made of
cast iron, the dispute was whether they were made of heavy cast iron (as the
plaintiffs contended) or only cast iron. Additional photographs were taken by
Looi which confirmed that the pipes were indeed made of UPVC (N/E 170). I was
also informed that the parties found only one (1) trial hole previously done
by Looi (between inspection chambers 2a and 2) and Looi had agreed there were
no others. I was moved to comment to Looi (N/E 171) that the
excavations/inspections which counsel for the defendant proposed then to carry
out should have been done by Looi 1 years earlier, to determine the material
used for the underground pipes. As the site inspection still did not resolve
the dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendant, I ordered parties to re-
visit the site after which Teo would be recalled to the witness stand. I
further ordered that the costs of recalling Teo and any prolonging of the
trial would be borne by the defendant in any event since no satisfactory
explanation was given why such inspection/excavation could not have been done
by or for Looi, 18 months earlier. In that regard, I rejected Looi's later
explanation (when questioned by counsel for Chan) that his duty was to apply
for TOP and he was concerned with structural parts not non-structural items
like galvanising of pipes (N/E181); he had chosen to comment on non-structural
items in his report, including plumbing and sewage.

48\. A second site inspection was made by the parties on 10 July 2001. Both
Teo and Chan confirmed the pipes were indeed made of UPVC. Teo added (when
recalled to the stand) that he was willing to reduce his claim to take into
account the inadequate footings; he said he had earlier offered to rectify the
defect but his offer was rejected. He was also prepared to omit his claim for
6-7m in length of the sewage pipes.

49\. When his attention was drawn to Chan's fee of $52,000, Looi expressed no
opinion on whether it included contract administration; he said it depended on
the oral agreement between the parties, as Chan's duties were clearly spelt
out in the letter of appointment. Although he was aware, Looi did not know
when the plaintiffs' services were actually terminated. More significant was
the revelation by Looi (N/E 195) that since his appointment, the defendant had
done nothing by way of rectification works, because the defendant was not
prepared to spend any more money.

_

  
The third party's case

_

50\. In his written testimony, Chan deposed it was the defendant who had
approached him, based on the recommendation of Topbreed Trading Company
(Topbreed) for whom Chan had also acted as the project consultant, when
Topbreed built a dog farm three (3) lots away from the site. Chan had set out
the terms and conditions for his services in the letter of appointment which
the defendant accepted on 9 July 1996 by a letter (2AB14) written on the
letterhead of Outram Marketing Services. Although the defendant's said letter
stated he would instruct his solicitor to follow-up with Chan on the terms and
conditions of the letter of appointment, the defendant never did. The letter
of appointment did not include administration of the contract; hence Chan was
not responsible for certification and control of payments to the plaintiffs
until he was specifically instructed to do so on 12 July 1999. Neither did the
letter of appointment cover design and installation of electrical works.
Earlier, when cross-examining the defendant, Chan's counsel had drawn the
defendant's attention to the letterhead used by Chan for the letter of
appointment; it clearly stated at the lower left corner:

> Consulting architect: Freddie Chia Ho Kheng  
>  Consulting engineer: Francis Chan Yaw Fai

Consequently, the defendant could not have engaged Chan as nor thought he was,
an architect; he well-knew Chan was an engineer. Further, Chan had applied to
the Director-General of Public Works for a waiver of the requirement for an
architect’s signature on the plans and it was granted on 26 September 1997.
Plans submitted by Chan were signed by him in the capacity of professional
engineer and endorsed with the defendant’s signature. Chan had also given his
business card to the defendant.

51\. Chan denied the defendant's allegation that he failed to award the
contract to a competent contractor, it was not he but the defendant who
appointed the plaintiffs which appointment was not based on the results of the
tender; even the lowest tender exceeded the defendant's budget and, the
plaintiffs' tender was not the lowest. Neither was Chan privy to the
negotiations between the parties which led to the plaintiffs' appointment by
the defendant. Contrary to the defendant's denial, Chan said it was the
defendant who telephoned him on or about 26 May 1997, and requested him to
prepare the second letter of award; the defendant volunteered the information
that he (the defendant) needed it to borrow money from a bank; Chan acceded to
the request. It was for the same reason that Chan subsequently prepared the
second contract for signature by the plaintiffs and the defendant. Despite the
express terms in the contract(s), Chan said the defendant well-knew that there
was never any intention to bind him to the duties of an architect and or
quantity surveyor. Chan had inserted his name as architect and quantity
surveyor in the contract(s) as a favour to the defendant.Chan was also never
involved with architectural drawings which task he delegated to Chua.

52\. Chan revealed that after his initial submission of plans to the PPD on 2
August 1996, plans were amended and re-submitted four (4) more times, between
2 August 1996 and 18 March 1997, due to the defendant's requests for changes,
before approval was granted on 20 March 1997. Sometimes, changes were agreed
between the plaintiffs and the defendant without Chan's knowledge, one example
being the variation of material from concrete to bricks for the drains,
another being the change in width of the drains and a third being the non-
galvanising of the steel partitions around the kennels. In addition to the
PPD, Chan made submissions to other government departments, between 20 March
1997 and 22 May 1999, for which he incurred fees of $14,430. As he had agreed
with the defendant to absorb his expenses, Chan said it meant his actual fees
were $37,570 ($52,000-$14,430).

53\. Chan deposed he was not provided with a schedule of works for the
plumbing done by the plaintiffs’ subcontractor as which result he did not know
and could not now determine, what type of pipes were and where they were,
installed. Had the defendant alerted him that PVC pipes were being used, Chan
would have instructed the plaintiffs to use the correct pipes. In any case,
construction of sewage pipes and inspection chambers are not critical
structural elements. As a result of the two (2) site visits I ordered and
based on the testimony of Chan and Teo, it has now been established that the
plaintiffs installed UPVC not PVC, pipes.

54\. Apparently, Chan had consulted quantity surveyors PEB Consultants (PEB)
when the defendant indicated on or about 12 July 1999 that he intended to
terminate the plaintiffs' services. As Chan was unable to give PEB the reasons
for such intended termination, Chan inquired of the defendant who did not
respond. Similarly, the defendant did not reply to Chan's letter asking for
instructions on the letter from the plaintiffs' solicitors dated 20 July 1999
(2AB618) concerning variations and changes to the contract, nor to Chan's
letter dated 17 August 1999 (2AB659-661) where he had set out the full history
of the project up to that date (including the reason for the second contract
and that the defendant himself administered the contract up to 12 August
1999), nor to Chan's letter dated 10 August 1999 (2AB638) seeking
clarification on phases 1 and 2 of the project. Chan surmised that the
defendant probably obtained the idea to administer the contract himself from
Topbreed for whose project Chan did not administer the contract; Topbreed
merely engaged a contractor to do the work, without even calling for a tender.

55\. Cross-examined on the defective footings, Chan echoed Portwood’s
testimony that the steel structures were perfectly safe as they showed no
signs of buckling, even on 9 July 2001. Chan was also of the opinion that it
was unnecessary to demolish the office block because the footings were under-
strength. At an estimated cost of $10,000 and two (2) weeks’ work, Chan
proposed a method of rectification which included adding concrete of the
desired strength to the footings; the slabs did not require rectification as
they did not sit on the footings but were self-supporting.

56\. Questioned by counsel for the defendant, Chan explained that the footings
were constructed in February 1998; he did supervise the concreting of the
office block prior to which he ordered a cube test to be done. However, he was
not shown the results although he had asked Teo, who said he would furnish the
same but never did. As the cube tests previously submitted to him for other
blocks were good, Chan had assumed albeit wrongly, that the office block
footings would also be acceptable. Chan pointed out that even if the cube
tests had been satisfactory, it did not mean the core tests would be good as
it still depended on how the actual concrete was poured into the footings and
such factors as curing and vibration as well as the way the cube was being
made. It emerged from Chan's testimony (N/E 240) that, a possible cause for
the footings in the office block being under-strength was due to the
plaintiffs' use of site-mix concrete instead of the ready-mix concrete used
for the other four (4) blocks. Chan was told by Teo that the change was
necessitated by cost-cutting as the plaintiffs had not been properly paid, at
the time when Teo asked for permission to use site-mix concrete.

57\. As for the driveway, Chan testified it was not completed. The plaintiffs
had only put in the base/sub-base comprising of used crusher-run; they had yet
to top-up the base with hard core and then asphalt or concrete to finish the
job. I should point out that according to Chan (and Looi in cross-
examination), the driveway appeared to have been well used by the defendant
after the plaintiffs’ services were terminated, notwithstanding that it was
not paved; there had been containers parked on or along it. I was informed
that the driveway is a private road, not a public road which needs to be
handed to the Public Works Department in due course. Consequently, there are
no stringent specifications on how it should be built.

58\. On the other complaints raised by Looi and or the defendant, Chan
acknowledged that the finish in kennel 3 was not 100% as he had said in his
written testimony but, no tiles were laid in kennel 4; hence there could be no
missing tiles there. This resulted from negotiations between the plaintiffs
and the defendant.

59\. Chan testified that the 8 monthly progress payments of $1,450 each in
item (k) in the letter of appointment were for supervision by himself (as the
part-time clerk-of- works) and by Chua; he had estimated that the project
would take 8 months to complete. In that regard Chan said he had visited the
site in October, November, December 1997, February 1998 and on 4 September
1999, when his services were terminated. When he visited on 9 July 2001, Chan
found the site overgrown with grass and lacking maintenance; the place was at
a standstill (N/E 238), unlike his visit on 4 September 1999 when the site was
in very good condition.

60\. I turn next to the testimony of the second and last witness for the Third
Party namely Chua (TPW2). Chua testified he took charge of the project on 2
July 1996 after the letter of appointment was signed. He worked closely with
the defendant in submission of drawings; the latter provided him with a lot of
information and documents to show how other countries designed dog farms,
including brochures. After the drawings were completed, Chua sent them to the
defendant for signature prior to submission to the authorities. Chua revealed
that simultaneous with this project, he was working on another project for the
defendant – a warehouse at Bukit Batok Industrial Park; hence they met very
often. Chua denied he was instructed by the defendant that any additional
works required a quotation and the defendant's prior approval before
commencement of work. He also denied the defendant's claim that he had
directed the defendant to pay the plaintiffs direct on progress claims. On the
contrary, it was the defendant who would inform him that the latter had valued
the works on site after they were completed; the defendant never told him
about progress claims 1 to 4.

61\. Chua recalled that in February 1999, he was told by Teo and the defendant
that the Diseased Animals Isolation Ward had been constructed not in
accordance with the approved plans. It necessitated Chua going to the site to
take measurements and submitting amended plans. At the same time, following
discussions between Teo and the defendant, he prepared a sketch of the fencing
facing Pasir Ris Drive 12, which he also submitted to the authorities and
which was approved.

62\. Chua testified that when The Third Party received PPD's letter dated 15
October 1997 (2AB507) inquiring as to the development on the farm, he had
telephoned the defendant who replied he was in Germany and would return to
Singapore on 29 October 1997, after which he would contact Chua but he did
not. When Chua received the first reminder from PPD dated 4 December 197
(2AB518) followed by the second dated 26 February 1989 (2AB532), he pressed
the defendant. The defendant then faxed to Chua the work schedule he had
earlier agreed with Teo (see 2AB533) but which Chan said he did not recall
seeing, until the arbitration proceedings between the plaintiffs and the
defendant. Chua then forwarded it to the PPD on 20 March 1998.

63\. Chua revealed that the change of sliding doors to louvre windows was
required by PPD and this was known to the defendant. Indeed, it was at the
defendant's request that Chua had visited the PPD on 20 September 1996, when
their Dr Lou explained the reason for the requirement. Chua followed up by
submitting amended proposal plans to the department on 9 October 1996, which
letter he copied to the defendant who did not object to the change, contrary
to his testimony. When counsel for the defendant cross-examined Chua, he
suggested (N/E 248) that the defendant wanted sliding instead of louvre,
windows because if the dogs were to jump out, they would not hurt themselves.
This was to be contrasted with the defendant’s earlier testimony (N/E 76) that
he wanted sliding windows so that when dogs were trained on rainy days, people
outside could see the dogs by sliding open the windows. As I told his counsel,
the defendant’s shift in position spoke a lot of his credibility. Chua’s
response was, that the defendant never explained his requirement for sliding
windows.

64\. Chua revealed that although it was not the job of the Third Party to
administer the contract and he so advised the defendant, the latter kept
calling him to chase the plaintiffs to finish the project. When Chua spoke to
Teo, he was told that the defendant had not paid the plaintiffs. However, when
he reverted to the defendant, Chua was told that the plaintiffs had been
overpaid and many things on the site were not what the defendant wanted. Chua
then advised the defendant that as the parties had agreed on liquidated
damages, if the defendant accepted the items outside the contract, then the
defendant would not have to pay the plaintiffs. He suggested that the parties
met to resolve the dispute but, he did not hear from either party thereafter.

_

  
The findings

_65\. It is quite clear to me on the evidence whose version of events is the
more probable. I accept the testimony of Teo, Chan and Chua as being more
credible and consistent with the documents and correspondence before the
court; I cannot say the same of the defendant. He was untruthful and less than
forthright, even when confronted with unassailable evidence, on which I
referred to certain instances earlier. __

66\. I have no doubt that the following represent the true facts of this
dispute:-

> (i) the defendant requested Chan to prepare two letters of award and two
> contracts in favour of the plaintiffs, with the second contract being used
> to obtain a higher loan from the bank which was financing the project for
> the defendant;
>
> (ii) the defendant could not have believed that Chan was an architect as he

>
> (iii) the defendant chose to administer the contract (up to 12 July 1999)
> himself again to save costs; I believe he relied on his contractor brother
> Low to help him verify the plaintiffs’ progress claims;
>
> (iv) whatever variation works carried out by the plaintiffs were done on the

67\. I turn my attention next to the testimony of the defendant's expert Looi.
At one stage (N/E 186) I had told Looi that he should not shut his mind to the
possibility of rectification of the plaintiffs' defective works. That remark
was prompted by Looi’s uncompromising refusal to consider any suggestions at
all to rectify the under-strength footings in lieu of demolition, from either
Portwood or Chan. As his own report was found to have shortcoming, as well as
Setsco’s reports upon which his findings were based, Looi did himself an
injustice by not appearing to be unbiased. Looi’s finding that the welds were
greatly reduced in thickness was proven wrong by Portwood. His quick dismissal
of the need for a load test is another example; a third example was his
complaint that the surface water channels were defective only because
brickwork was used instead of reinforced concrete. In terms of function, Looi
had agreed with Chan’s counsel that there was no difference between the two.
It was due to no fault of the plaintiffs that the inspection chambers and the
driveway were not completed. I am therefore of the view that Looi lacked
independent judgment; I am not prepared to accept his evidence. I much prefer
the testimony of Portwood and Chan. Both (and Teo) did not deny that the
footings were defective and needed rectification. Their recommendations are
worth considering, once the estimated costs have been verified by quotations,
subject to load tests being carried out. Teo readily made concessions where
the plaintiffs’ work fell short of required specifications or standards, an
example being his willingness to omit 6-7m length for his company’s claim for
the sewage pipes.

68\. Consequently, there will be judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of
$453,885.45 made up as follows:

(i)  | balance outstanding on progress claims nos. 1 to 4 | $411,224.91   
---|---|---  
(ii)  | progress claim no. 5 | $ 42,660.54  
  
together with interest at 6% per annum from the date of this writ, and costs.

69\. In the light of the plaintiffs' admission of defects to the footings
works, there shall be a stay of execution on $80,000/- of the judgment sum,
until such time as the quantum for the cost of
strengthening/reinforcing/replacing the footings has been ascertained,
together with the appropriate reduction for the 6-7m of pipes for the sewage
works which claim the plaintiffs have agreed to waive. Further, deductions
should be made for the works necessary to complete the inspection chambers,
the driveway, removal of rust from kennels 3 and 4, omission of the 10-persons
sewage treatment plant not built by the plaintiffs and any other works not
built or completed by the plaintiffs, in accordance with the contract. This
would include a reduction for the shortfall (from 6mm) in thickness of the
welds. Although I disallow the plaintiffs' claim for loss of profits of
$356,096.75 (not proven), they are not precluded from adducing evidence at the
assessment hearing, of the loss/damages they had suffered in disposing of the
trusses they had fabricated (in readiness for construction), after their
services were terminated.

70\. The omissions, deductions and damages referred to earlier shall be
assessed by the Registrar, with the costs of such assessment to be reserved to
the Registrar. The parties are at liberty to call their quantity surveyors to
testify at the assessment or, in the case of Chan, his professional engineer
Lim Ang Beng Hock (Eric). Evidence adduced at this trial shall form part of
the evidence for the assessment but, parties are _not allowed_ to adduce
further testimony on liability, to contradict/rebut the evidence already
presented before this court.

71\. Needless to say, the defendant's counterclaim against the plaintiffs is
dismissed with costs, together with his Third Party claim against Chan.
Neither claim has any merit in the light of my earlier findings. There shall
be judgment for the Third Party's counterclaim against the defendant in the
sum of $22,575/- for the outstanding balance of Chan's agreed fees of
$52,000/-, together with interest (at 6% per annum) from the date of the writ
in Suit No. 564 of 2000 and costs.
