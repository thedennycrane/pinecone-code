** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The accused is a 19-year old junior college student who pleaded guilty to
four charges, two of which were under s 377 of the Penal Code, Ch 224 and two
under s 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code, Ch 224. The first charge was for
fellatio against an 11-year old girl. The second charge was for using criminal
force to outrage the modesty of a 9-year old girl. The third charge was for
fellatio against the same 9-year old girl. The fourth charge was for using
criminal force to outrage the modesty of another 11-year old girl.

2\. The accused had previously been convicted on 28 January 1999 on a long
list of sexual offences as well as offences relating to theft and causing
hurt. He was sentenced to three years Reformative Training. He managed to
obtain his O-level certificate whilst serving this sentence. He enrolled in a
well-known and prestigious junior college upon his release. He was apparently
well liked and his teacher reported him as a bright and articulate student.

3\. In mitigation, his counsel Mr. Palakrishnan SC submitted that the cause of
this obviously deviant personality of the accused can be traced to his
childhood experience of finding his grandmother, with whom he was very
attached, stabbed to death by robbers. He was the only child of a business
executive father and a doctor mother. Mr. Palakrishnan submitted that the
accused was driven to put up a bold front in the face of his emotionally weak
parents. There is some support in the psychiatric report of Dr Gwee Kok Peng,
dated 31 March 2002, that the accused suffers from some behavioral problems
that require group and individual therapy.

4\. The offences which he had committed were serious because the victims were
very young and some violence was employed in the course of the crime. These
offences were also committed while he was still under supervision upon his
release from the Reformative Training Centre. The present offences as well as
his antecedents appear to have the mark of a serial offender’s stamp over
them. These circumstances warrant a long deterrent sentence against him.

5\. It is a pity when a bright young man spends the bloom of youth behind
bars; but it will be a greater tragedy if he does not correct himself -
because he may end up spending the rest of his useful life in jail.

6\. Given the circumstances of the case and having regard to the submissions
of Mr. Palakrishnan and DPP Lim Yew Jin, I sentenced the accused to seven
years imprisonment in respect of the first charge; four years imprisonment and
six strokes of the cane in respect of the second charge; seven years
imprisonment in respect of the third charge; and four years imprisonment and
six strokes of the cane in respect of the fourth charge.

7\. I ordered that the sentences of imprisonment in respect of the first,
third and fourth charges to run consecutively from 21 January 2002, and the
term of imprisonment in respect of the second charge to run concurrently with
them; making a total of 18 years imprisonment and a total of 12 strokes of the
cane.
