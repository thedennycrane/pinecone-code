See Kee Oon JC (delivering the judgment of the court _ex tempore_):

1 The appellant had furnished false information as to his residential address
at the time of his application to register his daughter for Primary 1
admission under Phase 2C at the Primary School of his choice. The appellant
never resided at the residential address provided at the relevant time.

2 The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge under s 182 of the Penal Code
(Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), with another charge also for an offence under s 182
(MCN 900581/2014) taken into consideration. The lower court accepted the
prosecution’s sentence submission seeking a custodial sentence and imposed a
term of 2 weeks’ imprisonment. The submission was premised on _PP v Tan Sok
Ling_ (DAC 27101/2007 and others, unreported), a 2007 decision of the District
Court, where an imprisonment term of 2 months for a similar offence was
imposed. The accused in _Tan Sok Ling’s_ case also faced another more serious
charge involving an unrelated offence of forgery for which he was sentenced to
9 months’ imprisonment. His total sentence was 11 months.

3 In the present appeal, the prosecution has reviewed its position having
regard to other sentencing precedents that have since come to its attention,
and stated that it will not oppose the appellant’s appeal for the imprisonment
sentence to be substituted with a fine.

4 I would agree with the District Judge’s observation (at [15] of his Grounds
of Decision, published as _Public Prosecutor v Wong Yi Hao Henry_ [2015] SGMC
7) that some parents may consider it worthwhile to risk a criminal conviction
in order to give their child a perceived headstart in life through securing a
place in a school of their choice. Some may even consciously factor this in as
a calculated cost and deem the price (of a conviction) to be ‘worth’ the
payment. Such cynical cost-benefit calculations, if they were indeed
undertaken, only serve to reflect on the sadly-misguided state of such
individuals’ value systems in seeking to gain an advantage in this way. No
child can possibly benefit from eventually coming to know that he or she had
gained admission into a Primary School only through his or her parent’s
devious and unlawful conduct.

5 The question is whether the nature of the offence warrants a custodial
sentence in order to mark the seriousness of the offence. The stigma of a
criminal conviction in itself is also a deterrent and ought not to be wholly
discounted.

6 The offence in question is not commonly the subject of prosecution. At the
same time I recognise that it is not easily detected. There have been no known
sentencing precedents since 2007 and it may well be that the custodial
sentence imposed in _Tan Sok Ling’s_ case may have played a part in driving
home the seriousness of the offence, and hence may have achieved its intended
deterrent effect. Nevertheless in the absence of any material indicating that
offences of this nature had been or are becoming more prevalent, and with no
additional aggravating features present, I would agree that there is
insufficient basis to impose a two-week custodial sentence.

7 The sentence of imprisonment will be set aside and substituted with the
maximum fine of $5,000, in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment. I am of the view
that this adequately addresses the appellant’s culpability in the present
case.
