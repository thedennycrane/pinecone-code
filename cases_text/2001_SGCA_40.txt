**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Judgment**

1\. On 24 November 2000, the appellant was convicted of the charge of murder
that on 2 May 1999, between 4.00am and 5.19am, outside Nikmath Restaurant,
located at 24 Sims Avenue, Singapore, he caused the death of one S Salim Bin
Ahmed. He was sentenced to suffer death. He appealed and the appeal was heard
on 23 April 2001, and it was dismissed. We now give our reasons.

**

The facts

**

2\. The facts leading to the killing on the fateful morning were these. On 1
May 1999, at about 9.00pm, some seven to eight hours before the incident,
three persons, the appellant, his girlfriend Bok Swee Hoon (Bok) and the
appellants friend Chan Kam Seong (Chan), were drinking beer at a hawker centre
at Lorong 2, Geylang. An argument ensued between the appellant and Bok and to
avoid further quarrelling, the appellant and Chan slipped away from the hawker
centre leaving Bok behind. He also switched off his handphone so that Bok
could not contact him.

3\. The appellant and Chan spent considerable time loitering in the area
between Lorong 2 and Lorong 12 Geylang until the early hours of the next
morning. When they were at Lorong 12, the appellant switched on his handphone.
Soon he received a call from Bok, who asked him where he was. He refused to
answer her and just told her to go home.

4\. Shortly after, at about 4.00am, and by then it was already 2 May 1999, the
appellant received a second call from Bok, who told him that a Malay man was
following her and had touched her. She complained that the man would not leave
her alone and continued to be a nuisance. She also informed him that she was
then at a coffee shop at the corner of Sims Ave and Lorong 5, Geylang.

5\. On hearing that, the appellant was very worked up and, together with Chan,
took a taxi to the coffee shop where Bok said she was. On arrival, the taxi
stopped on the other side of the road and the appellant and Chan alighted from
it. The appellant walked across Sims Road towards the coffee shop where Bok
was. The coffee shop bore the sign "Nikmath Restaurant". Chan remained where
he was and did not follow the appellant in crossing the road.

6\. At that moment, Bok was talking on a public telephone, which was located
at the front right corner of the coffee shop as one faces the shop. The
appellant approached Bok and asked who was the person disturbing her. She
pointed to a Malay man [later established to be S Salim Bin Ahmad (Salim)] who
was standing near another public telephone, a very short distance away. The
appellant and Salim then stared at each other. Following this, the appellant
went to the alley at the back of the coffee shop where he found a wooden pole,
which was quite heavy. Armed with that, he returned to where Salim was and
attacked him on his head and body. There was no retaliation by Salim. The
appellant then left the scene with Bok and went into hiding in Malaysia. About
a year later he was arrested in Malaysia and on 12 May 2000 he was brought
back to Singapore to face the charge.

7\. We ought to mention that the evidence of Chan was slightly at variance
with the above. According to him, upon alighting from the taxi, the appellant
told him that he was going to beat up the Malay man. He saw the appellant
going into the lane behind the Nikmath Restaurant. Shortly afterwards, the
appellant was seen carrying a wooden pole about two feet long. He then
approached Bok, presumably asking her to identify the man who was harassing
her. He next saw the appellant hitting Salim on the back of his head. Salim
then fell onto the ground and the appellant continued to hit him two to three
times on the head and four to five times on the legs. The appellant also used
his right leg to kick the waist of Salim, and said "pergi mati" ("go and die"
in Malay). As far as Chan saw it, there was no staring incident. Salim did not
retaliate when the appellant was attacking him. The appellant then left the
coffee shop with Bok. However, the trial judge did not accept the evidence of
Chan as he felt that Chan appeared hostile and was not reliable.

8\. The owner of Nikmath Restaurant, one Mr Assinar s/o Mamu (Assinar), was at
the relevant time behind the counter. He saw the appellant approach Salim and
use a wooden stick to hit Salim. He was not able to say where the blows
landed. He did not hear any quarrelling between the appellant and Salim. He
then came out of the counter and saw Salim sitting on the ground and leaning
against the orange coloured coin phone stand. He shouted "Jangan" (meaning
"dont" in Malay) three times and ran to make a call to the police. The
evidence of Bok was along similar lines to that of the appellant.

9\. Salim died several hours later in hospital. He was unconscious from the
time the Civil Defence team came to the scene. The pathologist, Dr Paul Chui,
who examined the body of Salim found, besides other injuries on the body,
three major injuries to the head as follows:-

> (i) a fracture of the skull over the right forehead with fragmentation of
> the nasal bones and fractures over the cheek area and injury to the brain
> with bleeding;
>
> (ii) a fracture of the skull beneath the occipital scalp with bleeding over
> the surface of the brain;
>
> (iii) a fracture of the base of the skull.

It was Dr Chuis opinion that these injuries were caused by the blunt force of
an object which could have been a stick with a square or rectangular cross-
section and the force used would have been moderately severe. It was also his
opinion that each of these injuries would, in the ordinary course of nature,
cause death.

10\. In passing, we should mention that there was, moreover, one other set of
significant injuries a fracture to Salims ribs, and a tear in his kidney which
was bleeding. In Dr Chuis opinion, these injuries were also sufficient in the
ordinary course of nature to cause death, although in the present case, the
actual cause of death were the head injuries.

11\. The appellant gave several statements to the Police in the course of
their investigation and three were sought to be admitted by the prosecution
and not objected to by the appellant:-

> (i) a statement recorded on 15 May 2000;
>
> (ii) another statement recorded on 15 May 2000;
>
> (iii) a statement recorded on 17 May 2000.

12\. The pertinent parts of the second statement recorded on 15 May 2000 were
the following:-

> As I was walking to the coffeeshop, I saw my girlfriend was on a silver
> colour public phone and she was facing the main road (Recorders note:-
> refers to Sims Ave). She did not see me as I came from the back of the
> coffeeshop. At the same time, I also saw a Malay man standing infront of my
> girlfriend. Both of them were about 2 feet away from each other. The Malay
> man (deceased) was alone.
>
> .  
>  .
>
> I hurried my girlfriend to put down the phone so that we could go back home.
> I was then rather unhappy with her behaviour and my tone also sounded
> unhappy. The Malay man (deceased) mistook me that I had passed remarks
> against him while I was talking to my girlfriend. As such, he uttered
> something at me in Malay which I could not understand. I wish to say that I
> do not either understand or speak Malay language. The Malay mans (deceased)
> tone sounded angry just like me. When the Malay man (deceased) stopped
> talking, we started staring at each other for a short while. He appeared to
> be very fierce and I became frightened . I then walked away to the back of
> the coffeeshop. At that time, my girlfriend was still talking on the phone.
> While at the back of the coffeeshop, I saw a square-shaped wooden plank
> lying on the cemented floor.
>
> .  
>  .
>
> I wish to say that I picked up the wooden plank for self defence in case
> there is a fight between the Malay man and me.
>
> .  
>  .
>
> On my return, the Malay man (deceased) remained standing infront of my
> girlfriend. He stared hard at me as if he was going to hit me. Before the
> Malay man (deceased) could make any move, I immediately hit him with the
> wooden plank. I first hit him on one of his arms about one to two times.
> After that, he fell sideways onto the ground. I continued to hit him a few
> times with the wooden plank on his legs, shoulder and head. I believed I had
> hit the Malay man (deceased) on the side of his head as he was then lying
> sideways on the ground. The Malay man (deceased) did not retaliate at all as
> he was lying on the ground

13\. The statement recorded on 17 May 2000 was in the form of questions and
answers and we need only quote the following:-

> Q2: When you were at Nikmath Restaurant located at 24 Sims Ave, why did you
> want to arm yourself with a wooden plank?
>
> A2: The Malay man kept staring at me as if he was going to start a fight. As
> such, I walked to the back of the restaurant and by chance, I saw a piece of
> wooden plank lying on the ground and I picked it up. I took the wooden plank
> for self-defence in case a fight erupted between the Malay man and me.
>
> Q3: Did the Malay man whom you referred to in your statement (Recorders
> note:- refers to the deceased) pose any threat or harm to you at Nikmath
> Restaurant located 24 Sims Avenue?
>
> A3: His behaviour towards my girlfriend and the way he stared hard at me
> made me felt frightened. As a result, I must get myself prepared and to
> protect myself.
>
> Q6: Do you know that the wooden plank as described by you in Q5 can cause
> serious injury to a person when it is used as a weapon?
>
> A6: I only know that it can cause serious injury. However, I have never
> thought that it could cause death. This is the first time that I have used a
> wooden plank in a fight. If I know it can cause death, I would not have used
> it.
>
> Q7: Did the Malay man whom you referred to in your statement (Recorders
> note:- refers to the deceased) retaliate while you were hitting him with the
> wooden plank?
>
> A7: The Malay man fell onto the floor after I had hit him once or twice on
> one of his arms with the wooden plank. He did not retaliate at all.
>
> Q8: Why did you continue to hit the Malay man whom you referred to in your
> statement (Recorders note:- refers to the deceased) after he had fallen onto
> the ground?
>
> A8: I was afraid that he would stand up and hit me back.
>
> Q14: Do you have anything else to say?
>
> A14: I wish to say that I do not have any intention to cause the deceaseds
> death. I do not know him and bear no grudge against him. I just wanted to
> teach him a lesson. I never expected that it would cause his death. I beg
> for leniency and hope the judge would give me a chance.

14\. In his defence, the appellant made basically two points. First, that when
he went to "rescue" his girlfriend, Bok at Nikmath Restaurant, he was "a bit
high on beer" But he knew where he was, what the time was and what he was
doing. Second, that he went to the back lane behind the restaurant to get
something to protect himself, and this was after he had chided Bok and asked
her to hang up the phone and leave with him. Salim had appeared thereby to be
angry and had said something. He had also stared at the appellant. Upon his
return from the back lane with the wooden pole, he again asked Bok to hang up
and leave and Salim did not like that. According to the appellant, at that
point Salim raised his right hand to the shoulder level and as he felt that
Salim was going to hit him, he struck Salim on the shoulder. As he was feeling
high and frightened, he did not know thereafter how many times he struck
Salim.

15\. The appellant denied saying to Chan that he was going to beat up Salim.
When he was referred to his answer to question 14 given on 17 May 2000, where
he stated "I just wanted to teach him a lesson", the appellant said that that
was suggested to him by the recording officer and he just signed. But when the
recording officer and the interpreter gave evidence this was not put to them.

**

Decision below

**

16\. In evaluating the evidence of the witnesses, the trial judge felt that
Assinar, though an earnest witness, had rather poor recollection of the
events. As for Bok, while some of her evidence was corroborated by others, the
trial judge was not able to rely on her evidence as she was under the
influence of Erimin or Upjohn tablets and her recollection was also unclear.
As for Chan, in view of contradictions in his evidence and his apparent
hostility towards the appellant, the trial judge did not think it safe to rely
on his evidence.

17\. Turning to the appellant, the trial judge accepted that what the
appellant stated in his statements was an honest account of the events. It was
not suggested to the recording officer or the interpreter that there was
anything incorrect in those recordings. Thus, to the extent that the
appellants evidence in court was at variance with what was set out in his
statements, the trial judge preferred the latter.

18\. The trial judge found that the defence had not shown that there was grave
and sudden provocation. It was not shown that when the appellant attacked
Salim, he was deprived of self-control. He also went on to say that, even if
there was provocation, the appellants actions were out of all proportion to
it, and thus did not come within Exception 1 to s.300. He further found that
there was nothing to show that the appellant was so intoxicated that he could
not have possessed the intention to commit an offence under s 300.

**

Issues on appeal

**

19\. Before us, as in the court below, the same two issues were raised :
first, that of grave and sudden provocation, and second, that because of his
intoxication, the appellant did not have the requisite intention to commit the
offence of murder. Counsel submitted that the trial judge erred when he found
that the appellant had not established that there was grave and sudden
provocation. He also fell into error for holding that the appellant was not so
intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing.

**

Provocation

**

20\. Provocation, as a defence to a charge of murder, is set out in Exception
1 to s 300 of the Penal Code and the provision reads:-

> Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power
> of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the
> person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by
> mistake or accident.

The Explanation to that Exception provides that "whether the provocation was
grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a
question of fact."

21\. In _PP v Kwan Cin Cheng_ [1998] 2 SLR 345 and _Lau Lee Peng v PP_ [2000]
2 SLR 628, this Court laid down that there are two distinct requirements which
must be satisfied before the defence of provocation can be successfully
raised. First, is the subjective requirement that the accused was deprived of
his self-control by provocation. Second, is the objective requirement that the
provocation must have been grave and sudden which involved the application of
the reasonable man test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary
person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing such of his
characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in
the same situation, would have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.

22\. Counsel for the appellant contended that on the evidence both the
requirements were satisfied to enable the appellant to raise the defence of
provocation. Counsel argued that what constituted provocation here was a
series of acts, starting with the molestation of Bok by Salim and the
appellant being informed by Bok about it, followed by Salim standing close to
Bok when she was talking on the phone, Salim uttering something in Malay
angrily when the appellant asked Bok to hang up and staring at the appellant,
and finally, when the appellant returned from the back lane holding the wooden
pole, Salim raising his right hand as if wanting to strike.

23\. It would be appropriate if we should at this juncture set out the manner
in which the trial judge viewed the situation ( 51 and 52 of the Grounds of
Decision):-

> The alleged molestation had ceased before the accused arrived at the coffee
> shop. The accused said that the deceased stared at him, and he stared back
> at the deceased. The act that precipitated the assault was the deceased
> raising his hand as though to hit him. This was not consistent with the
> accuseds statement that Before the Malay man (deceased) could make any move,
> I immediately hit him with the wooden plank and his answer when asked
> whether the deceased posed any harm or threat to him, that His behaviour
> towards my girlfriend and the way he stared hard made me felt frightened
> with no mention of any gesture, hand or arm movements.
>
> The evidence showed that he was angry with the deceased for accosting his
> girlfriend and annoyed at her for not leaving the coffee shop with him
> immediately. He did not say that he was so provoked that he had lost his
> self-control when he attacked the deceased.

24\. Counsel urged us to bear in mind that, while the appellant and Bok were
not married, their relationship was de facto that of a married couple. That
was not disputed. Nowhere did the trial judge indicate a different view. The
fact that the appellant was not married to Bok played no part in the
determination of the trial judge. Counsel reiterated that the provocation was
a continuous one. First the molestation, then Salim continued to stand close
to Bok disturbing her, followed by the utterance and the stare, and eventually
the raising of the arm. The appellant obviously lost his control and the
attack was carried out in a frenzy as the appellant did not even know where
and how many times he hit Salim. Counsel also pointed out that the appellant
only went to arm himself with a wooden stick and not a knife or a broken
bottle. That only went to show the defensive nature of that move.

**

Our decision

**

25\. Like the trial judge, we did not think that it had been established that
the appellant had, in fact, lost his self-control due to provocation. The
circumstances showed that he was very much in control of the situation. Upon
being informed by Bok that she was being disturbed by someone, he had the
presence of mind to do the only proper thing : to go there to rescue her. On
arrival at the scene, there was no altercation although Salim was standing
close by. After the appellant asked Bok to hang up the phone and leave the
place, there was some staring between the appellant and Salim. Whereupon the
appellant went to the back lane and came back armed with the wooden pole.
Thereafter, he attacked Salim. To justify his striking first, he alleged that
Salim lifted his right hand up to his shoulder. But in his statement of 15 May
2000, he merely stated that before the Malay man could make any move, I
immediately hit him with the wooden plank. More important to note was that
Salim was not carrying any weapon or instrument which could be used as such.
It seemed to us that every move of the appellant was very deliberate. He knew
what he wanted to do. He found his implement and took the offensive against
Salim, literally to teach the latter a lesson.

26\. Turning to the second requirement, the objective requirement laid down in
_Kwan Cin Cheng_ , again, we did not think whatever provocation there was in
the circumstances was "grave and sudden". A reasonable person, who was not out
to get even, would not, in the circumstances, have gone on to search for some
weapon and carry out an assault of this kind. The severity of the physical
assault which the appellant inflicted on Salim, which eventually led to his
death, showed, in the circumstances, that the appellant was bent on teaching
Salim a lesson. The appellant might well not have appreciated that striking
Salim with the wooden pole would lead to his death, but that did not matter as
it was clear that he intended to cause the three fractures to the skull of
Salim, as there was nothing accidental about the fractures, and any one of the
fractures was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death: see
_Virsa Singh v State of Punjab_ (1958) AIR SC 465 and _PP v Visuvanathan_
[1978] 1 MLJ 159. Accordingly, the appellant was rightly convicted of murder.

**

Drunkenness

**

27\. In the light of our views above, there was really nothing meritorious in
the defence of intoxication. It was not in dispute that the appellant had,
before the incident, consumed a fair amount of beer. While he was "high"
because of the effect of beer, he was not completely drunk. He was in fact
conscious of the surroundings and knew what he was doing. This came out from
his evidence:-

> Q: When your girlfriend called you for the first time when you were at
> Lorong 12 Geylang coffee shop, were you drunk?
>
> A: I was not completely drunk. I was a bit high. My gait was not steady.
>
> Q: But Mr Seah, you were aware of your surroundings; you knew what was going
> on, am I correct, at that time? You were aware of the surroundings that
> means you know what time it was, where were you, what were you doing?
>
> A: Yes.
>
> Q: In fact when your girlfriend called you the first time you had the
> presence of mind to ask her to go back by herself?
>
> A: Yes.

28\. By s 85 of the Penal Code, intoxication as a defence is rather
restricted. It applies only if by virtue of intoxication the accused did not
know

> that the act or omission, which constituted the offence was wrong, or did
> not know what he was doing and, (a) the state of intoxication was caused
> without his consent by the malicious or negligent act of another person; or
> (b) he was then, by reason of intoxication, insane, temporarily or
> otherwise.

29\. The circumstances of the present case did not satisfy the condition laid
down in s 85 for the defence of intoxication to be invoked. In our judgment,
it was clear that the appellant knew what he was doing. Even according to the
appellant, he appreciated the danger and had the presence of mind to get a
wooden pole for his own protection. He could not have been so intoxicated. The
truth of the matter was that the appellant wanted to teach Salim a lesson for
disturbing or trying "to get fresh" with Bok and getting the wooden pole was
the means by which he sought to achieve that objective. In the result, the
appeal was dismissed.

30\. Before we conclude, there is a matter we ought to refer to. The judge
below had expressed some concern on the following passage of this Court in
_Lau Lee Peng v PP_ [2000] 2 SLR 628:-

> In the light of the discussion in _Kwan Cin Cheng_ , the test of
> proportionality is probably not a distinct requirement for raising the
> defence of provocation. It is a factor to be taken into account in
> determining whether the objective test of gravity and suddenness is
> fulfilled. Therefore, _the fact that the retaliatory acts may have been out
> of proportion to the provocation offered does not necessarily mean that the
> defence must fail. This is because where the provocation defence in
> Exception 1 to s 300 is raised, the accuseds acts of retaliation would _ex
> hypothesi_ always have been of an extreme degree, resulting in the death of
> another person_. An inquiry into proportionality does little to answer the
> essential question of whether an ordinary person would, upon receiving the
> provocation in question, have reacted in the same way the accused did.
> (Emphasis added).

In particular, the two sentences underscored above.

31\. The judge seemed to think that it did not follow that an accuseds acts of
retaliation "would _ex hypothesi_ always have been of an extreme degree." He
pointed out that under s 300 there are four classes of acts which constitute
murder, and of those four classes, one of them (s 300[d]) relates to an act
which the accused knows is so imminently dangerous that it must in all
probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death,
with no requirement that there should be any intention on his part to cause
death or bodily injury. Accordingly, an act which falls within s 300(d), and
which was brought about as a result of provocation, may not necessarily have
been "of an extreme degree".

32\. His second point would appear to be that the test of proportionality is a
distinct and separate test and, if an accuseds act of retaliation was out of
proportion to the provocation, the defence under Exception 1 would not be
available to him.

33\. We agree with the trial judge that the resulting act of provocation may
not always be of an extreme degree just because death ensued, though it
invariably is. We accept his contention that an act which falls within a s
300(d) is essentially the doing of a dangerous act and that act need not
necessarily be of an extreme degree.

34\. As regards the question of proportionality, we would reiterate what is
stated in the passage in _Lau Lee Peng_ that the test of proportionality is a
factor to be taken into account in determining whether the objective condition
is satisfied. All we stated was that the fact that the act of retaliation may
be out of proportion to the provocation offered does not mean that the defence
must fail. In as much as there are degrees of provocation, the same applies to
the severity of the response. Besides, there are also degrees of
disproportionality. In an issue such as this, which is a question of fact, one
cannot be so clinical or emphatic as to say that the provocation and the
response must always be matched, otherwise the defence will fail. It is the
overall circumstances which the trial judge must weigh, and superimposed into
that consideration how a reasonable person in those circumstances would have
reacted, and then come to a conclusion.
