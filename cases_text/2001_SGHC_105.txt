This settlement agreement was reached after many days of negotiation between
the solicitors for the respective parties and was incorporated into and formed
part of a consent judgment between the parties dated 8 August 2000 in Suit Nos
1656/99 and 1074/99.  
  
Pursuant to the terms of the consent judgment, RT, through his solicitors (M/s
Tan Rajah & Cheah) paid the instalments for the first five months to the
solicitors for SHE (M/s Drew & Napier). The dispute in this case arose in
respect of the payment for the sixth instalment which, under cl 6(e) was
payable on the last day of January 2001. If the sixth instalment was paid more
than four days from 31 January 2001 then, by the terms of cl 11, the entire
outstanding balance would become immediately due and payable.  
  
RT wanted to pay that sixth instalment (of $56,250) by Monday, 5 February
2001, and Tan Rajah & Cheah so informed Drew & Napier. Drew & Napier, by their
letter to Tan Rajah & Cheah of 2 February 2001 refused this request and
stated:

> _As explained, our clients are not agreeable to the receipt of the 6th
> installment payment on**Monday, 5 February 2001** as this will be past the 4
> days grace period provided for in the Settlement Agreement dated 8 August
> 2000._

> _In keeping with our office hours, if your clients are unable to make
> payment of the 6th installment by 5:30pm today, you may must [**sic**]
> payment to us on **Saturday, 3 February 2001 between 9:00am and 1:00pm** by
> contacting our duty solicitor, Mr Ajay Advani at 97652935 to arrange for
> receipt of the same._

  
  
On Saturday, 3 February 2001, Tan Rajah & Cheah forwarded to Drew & Napier
their cheque for $45,662 as part payment of the sixth instalment. The letter
stated:

> _We refer to the telephone conversation between your Mr Suresh Divyanathan
> and our Mr Eusuff Ali yesterday afternoon._

> _Our clients are unable to make full payment today. However, we enclose
> herewith our OCBC cheque (Cheque No. 010782) for $45,662/- in your favour as
> part payment of the 6th instalment sum. As the last due date falls tomorrow
> which is a Sunday, we shall forward you the balance ($10,588) on Monday, 5th
> February 2001._

  
  
In their response on Monday, 5 February 2001, Drew & Napier invoked cl 11 of
the consent judgment and demanded payment of the entire balance outstanding.
Their letter read:

> _We refer to our fax dated 2 February 2001 and your letter dated 3 February
> 2001._

> _Clause 11 of the Settlement Agreement dated 8 August 2000 ("Agreement")
> provides that if your client, Mr Richard Teo, is late by more than four (4)
> days in the payment of any instalments, `**all outstanding statements become
> due and payable immediately and** [our clients] **shall be entitled to levy
> execution for such outstanding amount** `._

> _As of this morning, 5 February 2001, we have only received payment of
> $45,662 out of a total of $56,250 due for the 6th instalment on 1 February
> 2001. Our clients have elected to enforce their contractual rights under
> Clause 11 of the Agreement. Please let us have the balance of $1,023,088
> by**4:00pm, Monday 12 February 2001** failing which our clients will
> exercise their right to levy execution for any amount outstanding._

  
  
That same morning (5 February 2001), Tan Rajah & Cheah forwarded to Drew &
Napier the balance of $10,588 due on the sixth instalment.  
  
On 6 February 2001, Drew & Napier wrote to Tan Rajah & Cheah as follows:

> _We refer to your letter dated 5 February 2001._

> _As we explained in the teleconversation between your Mr Eusuff Ali and our
> Suresh Divyanathan on 2 February 2001, we are of the view that Clause 11 of
> the Settlement Agreement dated 8 August 2000 ("Agreement") applies if
> payment is made on Monday, 5 February 2001. This was reiterated in our
> letter of the same date subsequent to the teleconversation._

> _Clause 6(e) of the Agreement requires payment to be made on the last day of

> It is clear to us that such exquisite delay fully entitles our clients to

As RT did not meet the demand in Drew & Napier`s letter for the payment of
$1,023,088, SHE on 16 February 2001 served on RT a statutory demand under s 62
of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Ed) for the said sum. Under that section,
a debtor shall, until he proves to the contrary, be presumed to be unable to
pay his debt if, in a situation where the debt is immediately payable, the
debtor does not, within 21 days of the service of a statutory demand on him,
pay that debt.  
  
By this originating summons, RT applied under r 97 of the Bankruptcy Rules
(Cap 20, R 1, 1996 Ed) to have that statutory demand set aside. The
application was heard by the deputy registrar on 12 March 2001. The deputy
registrar dismissed the application and granted SHE liberty to commence
bankruptcy proceedings against RT after 19 March 2001. This is an appeal by RT
against that decision of the deputy registrar.  
  
Rule 98(2) of the Bankruptcy Rules provides the circumstances in which the
court may set aside a statutory demand. Rule 98(2)(e) gives a residual
discretion for the court to set aside a statutory demand if the court is
satisfied, `**_on other grounds_** `, that the demand ought to be set aside.
RT, in his application before the deputy registrar and in the appeal before
me, relied on r 98(2)(e).  
  
Rule 98(2) is in pari materia with r 6.5(4) of the Insolvency Rules 1986 in
England. The English Court of Appeal in **Re A Debtor (No 1 of 1987)** [1989]
2 All ER 46[1989] 1 WLR 271 in construing the English provision held:

> _Under the 1986 Act, a statutory demand which is not complied with founds
> the consequence that the debtor is regarded as being unable to pay the debt
> in question or, if the debt is not immediately payable, as having no
> reasonable prospect of being able to pay the debt when it becomes due. That
> consequence, in turn, founds the ability of the creditor to present a
> bankruptcy petition because, under s 268(1), in the absence of an
> unsatisfied return to execution or other process, a debtor`s inability to
> pay the debt in question is established if, but only if, the appropriate
> statutory demand has been served and not complied with._

> _When therefore the rules provide, as does r 6.5(4)(d), for the court to
> have a residual discretion to set aside a statutory demand, the
> circumstances which normally will be required before a court can be
> satisfied that the demand `ought` to be set aside,**are circumstances which
> would make it unjust for the statutory demand to give rise to those
> consequences in the particular case. The court`s intervention is called for
> to prevent that injustice**. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
It was submitted on behalf of RT that there would be injustice to RT if the
statutory demand was not set aside. In support of that submission, RT
highlighted the following factors:

(1) RT`s payment on the following working day when the last day for payment
fell on a Sunday is not a breach of the terms of the settlement agreement. RT
should not be deprived of his right especially so where SHE had not indicated
that they would accept payment on Sunday.

(2) Apart from the present incident where the instalment payment was allegedly
late by one day, which is denied, there is no evidence that RT is unable to
pay his debts as they fall due. The courts should not allow a creditor to
bankrupt a debtor by invoking the presumption under s 62 of the Bankruptcy Act
for an alleged technical breach. One of the key reforms to the Bankruptcy Act
is in fact to reduce bankruptcy proceedings from being instituted by trigger-
happy creditors.

(3) On equitable principles, SHE have suffered no prejudice from the alleged
late payment. Even if full payment was made on Saturday by cheque, as is the
usual practice between the parties, SHE would only be able to present the
cheque for clearance on Monday and receive their payment thereafter. In
contrast to SHE, RT has acted in good faith in making all instalment payments
to-date including the seventh instalment for February 2001.

(4) In law and in equity, SHE`s interpretation of the settlement agreement is
highly doubtful. In such circumstances, it would be unfair and prejudicial to
RT to allow the presumption under s 62 of the Bankruptcy Act to arise,  
  
and urged the court to exercise the discretion it had, under r 98(2), to set
aside the statutory demand.  
  
As held in **_Re A Debtor_** (supra), the court would normally exercise its
discretion under r 98(2)(e) to set aside a statutory demand, if it would be
unjust, in the circumstances of any particular case, for the court to conclude
from the failure to comply with the terms of a statutory demand, that the
debtor is unable to pay the debt. In the present case, if indeed the entire
balance of $1,023,088 had, by the terms of the consent judgment, become due
and payable to SHE when the statutory demand was issued, there can be little
or no merit in RT`s claim that an injustice would be done to him if that
statutory demand is not set aside. This is all the more so in a situation like
the present where the terms of the settlement agreement had been negotiated at
length between the parties. RT was fully aware at the time of the consent
judgment that, by reason of cl 11 thereof, should he default in paying any
instalment by more than four days after it became due, `all outstanding
balances become due and payable immediately and SHE shall be entitled to levy
execution for such outstanding amount". The principal issue that I have to
consider and on which submissions have been made before me is whether the
entire balance of $1,023,088 had become due and payable when, by 4 February
2001, RT failed to pay in full the instalment due on 31 January 2001.  
  
The time for the payment of each of the instalments was fixed by the consent
judgment. As that was an order of court the reckoning of time would be
governed by O 3 r 2 of the Rules of Court, which states:

> _
>
> 2(1) Any period of time fixed by these Rules **_or by any judgment_** ,
> order or direction for doing any act shall be reckoned in accordance with
> this Rule.
>
> _

> _..._

> _
>
> (5) Where, apart from this paragraph, the period in question, **_being a
> period of 7 days or less_** , would include a Saturday, Sunday or public
> holiday, that day shall be excluded. [Emphasis is added.]
>
> _

  
  
It was submitted by Mr Suresh Divyanathan, counsel for SHE, that since by the
terms of the consent judgment given on 8 August 2000, the sixth instalment had
to be paid by the fourth day after 31 January 2001, the time period was one
which was well in excess of the seven days referred to in O 3 r 2(5), and O 3
r 2(5) would not apply.  
  
In support of that submission, Mr Divyanathan cited the case of **Pembinaan
KSY Sdn Bhd v Lian Seng Properties Sdn Bhd** [1993] 1 MLJ 316 . The plaintiffs
in that case had granted several extensions of time to the defendants to file
their defence. In the final extension granted by letter dated 20 March 1987
the plaintiffs granted `**_an extension of seven (7) days from 23 March
1987_** ` to enable the defendants to file their defence.  
  
The Rules of Court of the High Court of Malaysia had a provision similar to
that in O 3 r 2(5) of our Rules. It was common ground that 23 March 1987 was a
Monday. Accordingly, there was a Saturday and a Sunday within the seven-day
period granted by the plaintiffs. Counsel for the defendants had argued that,
that being so, under O 3 r 2(5), that Saturday and Sunday must be excluded in
the calculation of the seven-day period. This would result in the seven-day
period ending on 2 April 1987. Counsel argued that since the defence was in
fact filed on 2 April 1987, it was futile to suggest that the defendants were
in default of defence and submitted that the judgment in default of defence
that had been entered was wrongly entered and should be set aside ex debito
justitiae. Lim Beng Choon J rejected this submission and said at pp 321-322 of
his judgment:

> _In considering the contention of counsel, it is my considered opinion that
> the letter of 20 March 1987 ... should not be read in isolation. It must be
> read, together with the letter of 2 March 1987 ... The last letter dated 20
> March 1987 merely allowed another extension of the 21-day period by a
> further seven-day period to file the defence. [The defendants] had at least
> a total of some 28 days to file their defence ... Construed in this manner,
> it is to my mind idle to contend that a**further** extension of seven days
> for the performance of an act which should have been performed some 21 days
> earlier must attract the provisions of O 3 r 2(5) for the construction of
> such a seven-day extension. I therefore hold that O 3 r 2(5) cannot apply in
> the reckoning of the seven-day extension._

  
  
Mr Divyanathan submitted that, similarly, the true construction of the
settlement agreement in the present case was that RT had a period well in
excess of seven days to pay the sixth instalment. He argued that whilst the
sixth instalment was due on 31 January 2001, the parties had by cl 11 agreed
to an extension of the due date by four days and that, in those circumstances,
the provisions of O 3 r 2(5) would not be attracted.  
  
Mr Chelva Rajah SC who appeared for RT argued that the consent judgment had
provided for two separate matters in cll 6(e) and 11 respectively. Clause
6(e), he submitted, required each instalment to be paid by the last day of
each calendar month. Each instalment would therefore be due by the end of the
month and if RT defaulted in paying any instalment, SHE would be entitled to
sue for that instalment. But cl 11, he submitted, provided for an entirely
different situation. Clause 11, he submitted, did not provide for an extension
of four days for the payment of each instalment. It dealt with a different
matter. It gave SHE the right to call upon RT to immediately pay up the entire
outstanding balance if any instalment was paid more than four days after the
due date. He submitted that as the period of time prescribed under cl 11 for
that right to arise was less than seven days, O 3 r 2(5) was applicable. He
submitted that if Saturday and Sunday were excluded from the reckoning of
time, the payment of the sixth instalment by Monday, 5 February 2001, would
not attract the provisions of cl 11.  
  
I accept that submission by Mr Rajah. The parties had specifically agreed in
cl 11 of the consent judgment that SHE would be entitled to call upon RT to
pay up the entire balance of the purchase price if payment of any instalment
is made more than four days after the due date. As the period of default
specified in the judgment for this right to arise is less than seven days, O 3
r 2(5) is attracted and any Saturday, Sunday or public holiday that fell
within that period has to be excluded. The case of **_Pembinaan KSY Sdn Bhd_**
(supra) relied on by SHE is distinguishable on the facts. In any event, it is
relevant to note that that decision runs counter to the decision of VC George
J in **Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York v Lian Seng Properties Sdn Bhd**
[1989] 3 MLJ 172 .  
  
For the above reasons, I allow the appeal with costs here and below and grant
the application by RT in this originating summons that the statutory demand be
set aside.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
