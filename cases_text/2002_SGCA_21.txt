On 30 Nov 2001, Lai Siu Chiu J delivered her judgment. Tan Chiang informed PPH
on 26 Dec 2001 of their intention to appeal, and on 31 Dec 2001 they filed
their notice of appeal against part of the judgment. However, the notice was
not served on PPH until 11 Jan 2002. Subsequently, on 25 Jan 2002, PPH
notified Tan Chiang that the notice of appeal was not validly filed and asked
them to rectify the same. As Tan Chiang disagreed, PPH filed Motion No. 3 of
2002/D on 2 Feb 2002 to set aside the notice of appeal on two broad grounds:
first, that leave to appeal should have been obtained as required under s
34(2)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322)(‘SCJA’); and
second, that the notice of appeal was not served on PPH within the period of
one month from the date of the judgment as prescribed under O 57 r 4 of the
Rules of Court.

Rajendran J, who heard Motion No. 3/2002/D on 15 Feb 2002 as a single judge of
the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 36(1) SCJA, was inclined to grant an
extension of time to serve the notice of appeal on PPH. Nevertheless, he
struck out the notice filed on 31 Dec 2001 on the ground that it was necessary
for Tan Chiang to have first obtained leave of court before any notice of
appeal could be filed. He ruled that such leave was required under s 34(2)(a)
SCJA because the value of the subject matter was less than $250,000. Although
it was not in dispute that the amount of Tan Chiang’s claim at the trial well
exceeded $250,000, the contention was that they had only appealed against,
firstly, a part of the claim in which they had not succeeded, and secondly,
PPH’s counterclaim awarded against Tan Chiang, and the total of these two
items did not exceed $250,000.

Tan Chiang filed the present Motion No. 8 of 2002/A to ask the Court of Appeal
to review and set aside the ruling made by Rajendran J on Motion No. 3/2002/D.
The substantive issue concerned the interpretation of s 34(2)(a) SCJA.****

**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. This motion (No 8/2002A), filed by the appellants, Tan Chiang Brother’s
Marble (S) Pte Ltd (Tan Chiang), was essentially to ask this Court to review
and set aside a ruling made by Rajendran J, in exercise of the power of a
single Judge of the Court of Appeal under s 36 of the Supreme Court of
Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA) on an earlier motion (No 3/2002D) filed by the
respondents. The substantive issue in question concerned the interpretation of
s 34(2)(a) of the SCJA. At the conclusion of the hearing we set aside the
ruling of the Judge and now give our reasons. **

  
The background

**

2\. By three separate contracts, Tan Chiang were engaged by the respondents,
Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd (PPH), as sub-contractors to carry out
works in relation to three projects namely, the Cuppage Centre project, the
Goldbell Tower Project and the China Square project. Tan Chiang instituted
Suit No 14/2001/D against PPH for the balance of the payments due under the
three projects.

3\. PPH did not dispute the claim of Tan Chiang in relation to the Goldbell
Tower and China Square projects. In essence, what was in dispute concerned 46
items of variation works undertaken by Tan Chiang in relation to the Cuppage
Centre project. Eventually, on account of amendments made to the pleadings,
the dispute was reduced to 36 items. On 33 of the items, PPH disputed only the
quantum thereof. But in respect of the remaining 3 items, PPH disputed both
liability and quantum.

4\. We should add that PPH had also counterclaimed against Tan Chiang in
respect of the work done on the Cuppage Centre and the Goldbell Tower
projects.

5\. After a 5-day trial, Lai Siu Chiu J delivered her judgment on 30 November
2001. On 31 December 2001 Tan Chiang filed their notice of appeal against part
of the judgment, having on 26 December 2001 informed PPH of their intention to
appeal. However, the notice was not served on PPH until 11 January 2002.
Subsequently, on 25 January 2002, PPH notified Tan Chiang that the notice of
appeal filed was not valid and asked Tan Chiang to rectify the same. As Tan
Chiang disagreed, PPH, on 2 February 2002, filed a Motion (No. 3 of 2002/D) to
set aside the notice of appeal on two broad grounds:

(i) leave to appeal should have been obtained as required under s 34(2)(a) of
SCJA; and,

(ii) that the notice of appeal was not served on PPH within the period of one
month from the date of the judgment as prescribed under O 57 r 4 of the Rules
of Court.

6\. Motion No 3/2002/D came before Rajendran J on 15 February 2002, sitting as
a single Judge of the Court of Appeal under s 36(1) of SCJA. Though he was
inclined to grant an extension of time to serve the notice of appeal on PPH,
he nevertheless struck out the notice filed on 31 December 2001 on the ground
that it was necessary for Tan Chiang to have first obtained the leave of court
before any notice of appeal could be filed. He ruled that such leave was
required because the value of the subject matter of the appeal was less than
$250,000.

**

  
Preliminary issues

**

7\. Before us counsel for Tan Chiang submitted that a single Judge has the
jurisdiction under s 36(1) of the SCJA to set aside a notice of appeal and
correspondingly strike out an appeal. Section 36(1) and (3) provides as
follows:-

"(1) In any proceedings pending before the Court of Appeal any direction
incidental thereto not involving the decision of the appeal, any interim order
to prevent prejudice to the claims of the parties pending the appeal, and any
order for security for costs and for the dismissal of an appeal for default in
furnishing security so ordered, may at any time be made by a Judge.

(3) Every order so made may be discharged or varied by the Court of Appeal."

8\. Counsel for PPH did not disagree that a single Judge has the jurisdiction
to make such an order. After all, it was PPH who asked the single Judge to
make the order. It would lie ill in the mouth of PPH to contend otherwise. If
a single Judge does have the power under s 36(1) to make such an order, this
Court would, under s 36(3), have the power to set it aside or vary it. Both
parties went before Rajendran J assuming that he had the jurisdiction to
consider and, if thought appropriate, grant the application. Thus, the Judge’s
attention was not drawn to the issue of the extent of his power.

9\. However, we had serious reservations whether such an order may be made by
a single Judge pursuant to s 36(1). There are three broad categories of orders
which a single Judge may make under that provision:

(i) any incidental direction;

(ii) any interim order to prevent prejudice; and

(iii) any order for security for costs and the consequential order for
dismissal of appeal for default.

Quite clearly, the present case does not come within the third category. The
question is whether the order made falls within the first two categories. As
we see it, the order made on 15 February 2002 could hardly be considered to
fall within those two categories. The orders to be made under both categories
are premised on the existence of an appeal and the need for certain interim
orders or directions to safeguard the interest of the parties pending the
disposal of the appeal. An application to strike out an appeal can, in no
circumstances, be considered to be an order of that interlocutory nature.
Indeed, it is an application with the object of putting an end to an appeal
and not to obtain any interlocutory or further reliefs. Accordingly, it was
and is our opinion that such an application cannot be heard by a single Judge
pursuant to s 36(1).

10\. Reverting to the matter in hand, we would add that whichever way one may
determine the jurisdictional issue of the single Judge under s 36(1), this
Court was properly seized of the matter. If, as we thought, a single Judge has
no jurisdiction to order the setting aside and striking out of an appeal then
the order of the single Judge made on 15 February 2002 in N/M No. 3/2002/D was
not valid and could have no effect. Thus, this Court could deal with the
issues raised in N/M No. 8/2002/A as if the order made in N/M No 3/2002/D had
never been made.

11\. On the other hand, if we assumed that the single Judge could make the
order as he actually did in N/M No. 3/2002/D, then by virtue of s 36(3), this
Court would have the power to review the order made by the Judge. Such an
application to the court for a review is not an appeal: see _Boyd v
Bischoffsheim_ [1895] 1 Ch 1.

**

  
Section 34(2)(a) of SCJA

**

12\. We now turn to consider section 34(2)(a) which provides that where "the
amount or value of the subject matter at the trial is $250,000 or less" no
appeal will be brought to the Court of Appeal except with the leave of the
Court of Appeal or a Judge. It will be seen that this operates as a
restriction on the right of appeal from a decision of the High Court.

13\. Decisions of the High Court can either be in relation to an action
commenced in the High Court or in relation to an action commenced in the
Subordinate Courts which comes on appeal before the High Court. The
jurisdictional limits of the District Court is $250,000 or less. A claim
exceeding that limit must be commenced in the High Court. Implicit in the
scheme of things is that there should, as a rule, be only one-tier of appeal.
In 1998, when the figure in s 34(2)(a) of SCJA was raised to make it fall in
line with the enhanced civil jurisdiction of the District Court, the Minister
of Law, Prof S Jayakumar, in his second reading speech in Parliament when
moving an amendment Bill to the SCJA, said:

"In view of the enhanced District Courts’ jurisdiction to $250,000 in civil
matters, the Chief Justice has proposed that the existing $30,000 limit in
section 34(2)(a) be raised to $250,000. In other words, bring its limit in
line with the enhancement. If the limit is not raised to $250,000, District
Court cases of less than $250,000 can first go on appeal to the High Court and
then Court of Appeal. This would strain the limited resources of the Court of
Appeal."

14\. In the present case, it was not in dispute that the amount of Tan
Chiang’s claim at the trial well exceeded $250,000. The contention of PPH was
that as Tan Chiang had only appealed against (i) a part of the claim which
they had not succeeded; and (ii) the counterclaim of PPH awarded against them,
and as the total of these two items did not exceed $250,000, Tan Chiang must,
as required under s 34(2)(a), first have obtained leave before they could
proceed to file their notice of appeal.

15\. PPH also relied upon the views expressed by the High Court in the
unreported decision of _Twin Enterprises Pte Ltd v Peter Lim Heng Wah_(S
1712/94 – delivered on 29 November 2000) where the judge said:–

"Although the said section (s 34(2)(a)) bespeaks the value of subject matter
at the trial, it is also intended to refer to the amount of the subject matter
on appeal."

16\. It seems to us that the arguments raised by counsel for PPH could be due
to a misunderstanding of the decision of this Court in _Spandeck Engineering
(S) Pte Ltd v Yong Qiang Construction_ [1999] 4 SLR 401. In 30 of PPH’s
written submission they stated –

"this Court has in _(Spendeck)_ construed the term ‘amount in dispute or the
value of the subject matter’ in s.21(1) of the SCJA to mean the amount in
dispute or the value of the subject or matter against which the appeal was
brought."

17\. We will deal with the _Spendeck Engineering_ case in some detail. There,
a sub-contractor instituted a writ in the District Court claiming a sum of
$62,275.51 from the main contractor. Judgment was entered against the main
contractor in default of defence. Later, the main contractor filed an
application to set aside the default judgment. The Deputy Registrar granted
the application. On appeal, the District Judge reinstated the default
judgment. On further appeal, the High Court affirmed the decision of the
District Judge. The main contractor appealed to the Court of Appeal. This
Court granted the sub-contractor’s application to strike out the appeal.

18\. Counsel for the main contractor argued that s 34(2)(a) only applied where
there was a trial below. As in that case there was no trial, the provision
could have no application. This Court ruled that a "trial" did not necessarily
involve the calling of witnesses and the taking of oral evidence. A trial
could be based on the evidence given in affidavits. This court ruled that if
the main contractor’s arguments were to be accepted it would lead to anomalous
results and gave this illustration (at p. 404):-

"For instance, an interlocutory or final judgment is given in the District
Court (in which there has not been a trial) in a suit in which the value of
the subject matter exceeds $50,000 but not $250,000, as in the present case.
From such judgment, whether it be interlocutory or final, an appeal may be
taken to the High Court as of right. Now, if the appellants’ contention is
accepted, the decision of the High Court on that appeal may be taken further
on appeal, as of right, to this Court (without leave) on the ground that s
34(2)(a) of the SCJA is not applicable as there has been no "trial" before
either the District Court or the High Court. On the other hand, if the suit is
finally disposed of by the District Court at a trial resulting in a final
judgment being given, that judgment may be taken on appeal to the High Court,
but from the decision of the High Court on that appeal, there would be no
further appeal to this court, unless leave under s 34(2)(a) is obtained."

19\. In order to ensure that the application of s 34(2)(a) does not lead to
anomalous results this Court felt that the word "trial" should be interpreted
purposively. It noted that as the limit of $250,000 in s.34(2)(a) was also the
upper limit of the District Court’s jurisdiction, the objective of s.34(2)(a)
was to ensure that where appeals from the decision of the District Court had
been heard and disposed of by the High Court, there should be no further
appeals therefrom to the Court of Appeal unless (on sufficient grounds shown)
leave of either the High Court or this Court was obtained. The provision
provide for a process to screen appeals to be brought to this Court, thus
preventing the clogging up of this Court by all kinds of appeals. What was
contemplated by the legislature in relation to an action commenced in the
District Court was that there should be only two tiers of hearing – the first
instance hearing and an appeal. A further appeal to the Court of Appeal was
only possible with leave.

20\. Nothing in _Spandeck Engineering_ suggests that the words "at the trial"
in s 34(2)(a) should be read to mean "at the appeal". All that _Spandeck
Engineering_ decided was that the word "trial" should not be read to mean only
a "hearing in open court with the calling of witnesses". There could be a
"trial" when the "hearing" was based purely on affidavits. In our judgment, to
read the word "trial" to mean "appeal" would do violence to the ordinary
meaning of that word and would be wholly unwarranted.

21\. In this regard two Malaysian cases are germane. In _Chan Kee Beng v
Ramasamy Naidu_ [1939] MLJ 92, the material provision was "if the amount or
value of the subject matter of any civil suit does not exceed $100, no appeal
shall lie." Mill J held that the determining factor was not the amount or the
value of the subject matter of the appeal, but the amount or value of the
subject matter of the civil suit.

22\. In a recent Malaysian Federal Court case, _Yai Yen Hon v Teng Ah Kok &
Sim Huat Sdn Bhd & Anor _[1997] 1 MLJ 136, a similar point arose. Under the
Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964, leave to appeal was required "when
the amount or value of the subject matter of the claim" was less than
M$100,000/-. There, the plaintiff’s claim was well in excess of M$100,000 but
the High Court only gave judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of M$62,400. The
Federal Court held that whether there was a right to appeal depended on the
value of the claim and not the award given by the trial judge.

23\. A much earlier English case, _Dreesman v Harris_ (1854) 9 Exch 485, had
also decided to a similar effect. That was an action in the county court for
breach of contract and the claim exceeded 20, though the judge gave judgment
only for 12\. The court held that no leave need be obtained to appeal. It was
argued there that such a construction would mean that a plaintiff could
reserve to himself the right of appeal in all cases by extending his claim to
a sum exceeding 20. This argument was rejected.

24\. We accept that it could be different if bad faith could be shown in the
formulation of the claim: see _Mason v Burningham_ [1949] 2 KB 545 and _Mayer
v Burgess_ (1855) 4 E&B 655. We would further add that a party who
unreasonably inflates his claim may be penalised when the question of costs
arises for consideration. This would undoubtedly act as a deterrence.

25\. In the instant case, the quantum of the claim at the trial was well in
excess of S$250,000. There was no suggestion that this was not a _bona fide_
claim. Accordingly, we held that no leave of court need be obtained by Tan
Chiang to file the present appeal (CA 600133/2001), which is now pending.

**

  
Extension of time for service

**

26\. Finally, we turn to consider briefly the question of an extension of time
to enable Tan Chiang to serve the notice of appeal on PPH out of time. As
mentioned before, the notice was served on PPH on 11 January 2002. It is clear
that under O 57, r 4 the notice should have been served on PPH on 31 December
2002, the day it was filed. This is because the filing and service must both
be done within a month of the judgment appealed against.

27\. The factors which a court should take into account in exercising its
discretion whether or not to extend time to enable a party to file a notice of
appeal out of time were considered and reiterated by this Court in _Pearson v
Chen Chien Wen Edwin_ [1991] SLR 212. The factors are: (i) the length of the
delay; (ii) the reason of the delay; (iii) the chances of the appeal
succeeding if time for appealing is extended; and (iv) the degree of prejudice
to the would-be respondent if the application is granted. The governing
principles were recently reviewed by this Court in _Nomura Regionalisation
Venture Fund Ltd v Ethical Investments Ltd_[2000] 4 SLR 46.

28\. There were circumstances in the case which deserved the court’s
consideration. First, the electronic filing system (EFS) of the Supreme Court
was only recently extended to include documents filed in Civil Appeals to the
Court of Appeal. Second, Tan Chiang initiated the process to file the notice
of appeal at 1.00pm on 28 December 2001. Due to certain technicalities, Tan
Chiang only managed to file the notice on 31 December at 11.51am. Third,
certain situations arose which had a bearing on the oversight and here we
would quote from an affidavit filed by the solicitor on behalf of Tan Chiang:-

"The Applicants waited for the Certificate for Security for Costs and Notice
of Appeal to be approved before service on the respondents. My staff who was
in charge of the EFS filing of the Notice of Appeal left our employment.
Another staff was assigned to monitor the same.

> The appellants were distracted the next few days by a dispute between the
> applicants and the respondents over the wording of the judgment of the court
> below.

The new staff retrieved the Notice of Appeal from the EFS system on 9 January
2002 and served the same on 11 January 2002."

Further amplification of these was set out in a later affidavit. Fourth, and
more importantly, PPH were notified on 26 December 2001 that Tan Chiang were
filing a notice of appeal.

29\. The delay in the service was only some nine days, as 1 January 2002 was a
public holiday. Tan Chiang had provided some reasons to explain the delay,
caused in part by the change in the system of filing following the expansion
of the EFS to civil appeals. It could not be seriously argued that the appeal
was without merits. In view of the fact that the delay was only some nine days
and PPH was notified that an appeal was being filed, there could be no
question of any prejudice.

30\. As we have stated, Rajendran J was favourably inclined towards granting
an extension of time for service if not for the fact that he held the view
that the notice of appeal was invalid because leave was required and not
obtained. For the foregoing reasons, we were similarly of the opinion that in
the circumstances of this case an extension of time for service ought to be
given, which we duly granted.
