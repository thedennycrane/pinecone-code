**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_**

BACKGROUND

**_1\. The Plaintiff is Ng Poh Guan (Mr Ng).

2\. In his Statement of Claim, he alleged that there was an oral agreement
between he and the First Defendant Chan Ai Leng (Ms Chan), who represented
herself, the Second Defendant Apirade Pramersa and the Third Defendant Ak
Tiong Hua, for him (Mr Ng) to buy the shares of the First to the Third
Defendants in the Fourth Defendant Honey Entertainment Pte Ltd (Honey). The
purchase price was $328,000.

3\. Honey had the benefit of a tenancy of No 33 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-01,
#01-02, #01-03, #01-04 and #01-05/06 Singapore 238977 (the Premises). It had
entered into an agreement dated 3 September 1999 with the landlord Hong Joo
Company Pte Ltd (the Landlord) to rent the Premises for a term of three years
commencing from the expiry of a two-month rent-free period, which rent-free
period was to commence upon issuance of the Temporary Occupation Permit.

4\. The terms of the oral agreement between Ms Chan and Mr Ng were set out in
a letter of intent dated 9 September 2000 and pursuant to such terms, certain
payments by him were made. Also, a formal agreement was to be drafted and
signed.

5\. Mr Ng alleged that there was a subsequent oral agreement on 14 October
2000 between Ms Chan and him under which, inter alia:

> (a) the Defendants would procure the drafting of and submission to him of
> the formal share agreement on or before 18 October 2000,  
>  (b) if there was any breach by the Defendants, he would be refunded
> everything he had paid, half of all rent payments from 1 October 2000 and
> liquidated damages of $125,000.

6\. He alleged that the Defendants were in breach of the oral agreements. The
allegations in respect of breach were:

> (a) they failed to deliver any draft of the formal share agreement by 18
> October 2000 or at all,  
>  (b) the Defendants failed to take any step towards the drafting of the
> formal sale agreement,  
>  (c) the First to Third Defendants had caused the Fourth Defendant to
> surrender the Premises back to the Landlord without just and reasonable
> cause.

7\. He alleged that the consideration for whatever payments he had made had
failed and the Defendants had received and had had the use of the same, and he
was entitled to and did rescind the oral agreements.

8\. He claimed the return of whatever monies he had paid and $125,000 as
liquidated damages.

9\. In their Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendants did not deny that there
was an oral agreement between Mr Ng and Ms Chan pertaining to the sale of the
shares in Honey to Mr Ng. They alleged that the letter of intent did not set
out all the terms agreed or accurately. However, it turned out that the
alleged difference in terms was not material.

10\. The Defendants also did not deny the subsequent oral agreement on 14
October 2000.

11\. However the Defendants denied any breach.

12\. The Defendants alleged that the keys to the Premises were handed to Mr Ng
on 12 October 2000 for the purpose of cleaning, and doing some fitting up, and
to enable him to re-position some air-conditioners but not to demolish
anything without the concurrence of the Landlord.

13\. However, on or around 14 October 2000, Mr Ng had caused the following to
be demolished:

> (a) Two of the 200mm thick party walls  
>  (b) Toilet walls, wall tiles and toilet accessories  
>  (c) Electrical installations  
>  (d) Kitchen exhaust  
>  (e) Built-in furniture and fittings  
>  (f) Three built-in DJ counters  
>  (g) Three built-in bar counters

14\. I will refer to these works as the Unauthorised Works.

15\. The Defendants alleged that as a result of the Unauthorised Works, the
Landlord was furious. The Landlord had threatened to re-enter the Premises and
to claim damages.

16\. As a consequence, the Defendants had to negotiate with the Landlord
resulting in the surrender of the Premises to the Landlord and a deduction of
$10,000 from a tenancy deposit so as to avoid having to pay further damages.

17\. The Defendants counter-claimed:

> (a) loss of the two year tenancy,  
>  (b) loss of the time spent on renovations of the Premises,  
>  (c) loss of profit if the Fourth Defendant had continued with the tenancy
> with the Landlord,  
>  (d) loss of a chance to sell the shares in the Fourth Defendant to any
> other party,  
>  (e) return of various licences which had been handed to Mr Ng pending
> completion of the sale,  
>  (f) refund of the sum of $10,000 paid to the landlord.

18\. In his Defence to Counterclaim, Mr Ng asserted that Ms Chan had
personally endorsed the Unauthorised Works even before the commencement
thereof but abandoned this assertion at trial.

19\. Mr Ng also alleged that if the prior concurrence of the Landlord was
required, it was the responsibility of the Defendants to obtain the same and
not him.

20\. He also repeated the allegation that the Fourth Defendants surrender of
the Premises to the Landlord was without just cause and unwarranted.

21\. The pleadings of Mr Ng and of the Defendants were atrocious. In many
material parts, they made no distinction between the First to Third Defendants
on the one hand and the Fourth Defendant on the other hand.

22\. The amendment of the Defence and Counterclaim, while addressing some of
the deficiencies, did not address all of them.

23\. The Amended Defence and Counterclaim also still failed to assert Honeys
cause of action as against the Plaintiff, given that Honey had no contract
with Mr Ng.

24\. At the conclusion of the trial, I declared that it was Mr Ng who was in
breach of his contract with Ms Chan and the Second and the Third Defendants.

25\. I dismissed Mr Ngs claims and ordered him to pay damages to Ms Chan and
the Second and the Third Defendants to be assessed. However their damages were
not to include any loss of profit if Honey had continued with the tenancy of
the Premises because the evidence showed that the First to Third Defendants
were not intending to continue with any operation of a pub and, if Mr Ng had
not breached his contract, he would have owned and controlled Honey in any
event.

26\. Honeys counter-claim for damages was dismissed and consequential orders
were made regarding the licences.

27\. Mr Ng has appealed against that part of my decision which is adverse to
him.

  
_**FURTHER ALLEGATIONS AND FACTS**_

28\. At the time of the trial, Mr Ng was operating a pub at 27 Mohamed Sultan
Road.

29\. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (AEIC), he explained that in August
2000, he was keen on operating a pub along Mohamed Sultan Road. He found the
Premises suitable and on 2 August 2000, his agent offered to rent the Premises
from the Landlord at $50,000 a month. Upon further investigation, he
discovered that Honey had a tenancy of the Premises for about $30,000 a month
(the actual rent was $32,000 a month). Accordingly, he decided to try to take
over Honeys tenancy by taking over Honey. He thought he could achieve this as
Honeys business was not doing very well then.

30\. With this in mind, he met Ms Chan on 6 September 2000. Ms Chan was
agreeable, on behalf of herself and the other shareholders of Honey, to sell
all the shares in Honey to Mr Ng for $328,000.

31\. To Mr Ng, this route would enable him (a) to save on some rent, (b) there
would be minimal renovations and (c) he had estimated that it would take him
less than a month to spruce up the place and open for business (para 7 of his
AEIC).

32\. During the discussions with Ms Chan, she had told him that Honey needed
money to pay the Landlord some monies owing. As he did not wish to jeopardize
Honeys tenancy, he agreed to and did issue a cheque for $32,960 in favour of
the Landlord (para 8 of his AEIC).

33\. Ms Chan and Mr Ng signed the letter of intent on 9 September 2000.
Although this document is stated to be subject to contract, both sides
proceeded at the trial on the basis that it constituted or evidenced a binding
agreement.

34\. Subsequently on 18 September 2000, he met Ms Chan who informed him that
more money was required to pay debts including monies owing to the Landlord.
It was common ground that he eventually paid $100,000 (including the $32,960)
as part payment of the purchase price (NE 12 line 15 and 16).

35\. In cross-examination, he said that he had received a copy of Honeys
tenancy agreement in September or the first week of October 2000. He said he
did read the agreement and Clauses 2(g), (h) and (j) and 4(e) thereof.

36\. Clause 2(g), (h) and (j) state:

> 2\. The Tenant hereby covenants with the Landlord as follows:-
>
> (a)
>
> (b)
>
> (c)
>
> (d)
>
> (e)
>
> (f)
>
> (g) to carry out at their own expenses all or any of the following works
> within the demises premises:-

> > (i) Partitioning within the demised premises and any variation to the
> standard corridor or inter-tenancy partitions for subdivided suites,
> supplied and erected by the Landlord;
>>

>> (ii) Installation of all necessary electrical wiring, conduits, etc, for
additional power points, light fittings, etc;

>>

>> (iii) Any alternation works relating to existing ceiling light fixtures,
air-conditioning supply and return grilles, fire protective devices, etc
supplied by the Landlord;

>>

>> (iv) Provision of carpets and other approved floor covering or finishes
within the demised premises.

> (h) To ensure the abovementioned works are undertaken whereby necessary by
> specialist sub-contractors _nominated or approved by the Landlord_ , in
> accordance with the approved plans and specifications _to be endorsed by the
> Landlord._ Where prior approval by the relevant building authority is
> necessary, no works shall commence until such approval is obtained in
> writing. All professional fees, charges and expenses incurred in this regard
> shall be borne by the Tenant;
>
> (i)
>
> (j) Not to make any alterations _structural or otherwise_ to the demised
> premises _without the prior written_ (sic) _of the relevant authorities
> during the tenancy_ and in the event there is any unauthorised structure
> required to be removed, the Landlord shall immediately engage a contractor
> to remove the same and the Tenant shall reimburse the Landlord the cost for
> the removal of the unauthorised structure;  
>  [Emphasis added.]

37\. Clause 4(e) states:

> 4(e) That if the rents hereinbefore reserved or any part thereof shall at
> any time be in arrears and unpaid for seven (7) days after the same shall
> have become due (whether legally demanded or not) _or if the Tenant shall at
> any time fail or neglect to perform or observe any of the covenants and
> agreements herein contained and on the Tenants part to be performed and
> observed_ or if the Tenant being a Company shall enter into liquidation
> whether compulsorily or voluntarily) or the Tenant making an assignment for
> the benefit of creditors or enter into agreement or make any arrangement for
> liquidation of the Tenants debts by compensation or otherwise or suffer any
> distress or process of execution to be levied on the Tenants goods or
> merchandise, _then in such case it shall be lawful for the Landlord_ or any
> person or persons duly authorised by the Landlord on his behalf _to re-
> enter_ into and upon the demised premises or any part thereof in the name of
> the whole and thereupon this tenancy shall absolutely determine but without
> prejudice to any right of action or remedy of the Landlord in respect of any
> antecedent breach by the Tenant of any of the covenants or agreements herein
> contained.
>
> [Emphasis added.]

38\. It was not disputed that on 10 or 11 October 2000, Ms Chan met with Mr Ng
at a hotel and, at his request, she signed on some renovation plans pertaining
to the Premises although she unwittingly signed where the Landlord should have
signed.

39\. On 11 October 2000, Mr Ngs solicitors Kenneth CP Tan & Liew (Kenneth Tan)
forwarded to the solicitors for all the Defendants M.N. Swami & Yap (M N
Swami) a draft of a loan agreement and of a shareholders agreement.

40\. On 12 October 2000, M N Swami replied to suggest a meeting on Saturday 14
October 2000.

41\. In the meantime, the keys to the Premises were given to Mr Ng for the
reason I have mentioned above (see para 12).

42\. In the meeting of 14 October 2000, various matters were discussed with a
view to signing a formal agreement.

43\. In the meantime and unknown to Ms Chan, the Unauthorised Works were being
carried out.

44\. Ms Chans evidence was that on 15 October 2000, she received a telephone
call from the Landlords agent who told her that the Landlord was furious about
the Unauthorised Works, although at that point in time, he might not have been
aware of all the Unauthorised Works.

45\. The next day, she went to the Premises to check and found that the
padlock or padlocks had been changed. However, she looked in to see the
Unauthorised Works.

46\. Ms Chan sought the help of M N Swami and Honeys architect Mr Yeo Chye
Teck (Mr Yeo).

47\. On 18 October 2000, M N Swami sent an urgent fax to Kenneth Tan. It said:

48\. On 19 October 2000, Kenneth Tan replied as follows:

49\. On 20 October 2000, M N Swami wrote to Kenneth Tan as follows:

> RE: HONEY ENTERTAINMENT PTE LTD  
>  AND SHARE AGREEMENT

50\. Ms Chan said she asked Mr Ng to attend the inspection. He did not. He did
however arrange for a messenger to bring one key on 20 October 2000.

51\. According to Mr Yeo, the inspection was attended by:

> (a) Ms Chan  
>  (b) The Landlords representative, Nicholas  
>  (c) Mr Yeo Chye Teck, the architect  
>  (d) A professional engineer Mr John Portwood (the PE).  
>  (NE 71 line 11)

52\. Ms Chan said that when the Landlords representative saw the extent of the
Unauthorised Works, he threatened to repossess the Premises immediately as the
works were carried out without the Landlords consent or approval from the
relevant authorities. He also threatened to take legal action and hold Ms Chan
and Honey liable for all damages, i.e to claim the reinstatement costs and
legal fees and forfeit the deposit (see para 13 of her AEIC and NE 49 line 18
and 19).

53\. According to Mr Yeo, he had received a telephone call from the Landlord
on 14 October 2000. In para 13 of his AEIC, he said:

> 13\. By the 14th of October 2000, I did not receive the said computer
> drawings or the interior design from Tony Teo to enable me to finalise the
> submission. However at about 4.30p.m on the same day, I received a phone
> call from the landlord that he had received (sic) from his upstairs tenants
> that there are heavy hacking from the premises. The landlord told me that
> when he went to the premises, he found that the party walls and toilet walls
> had been hacked off. He had also stated that the glass panel on the external
> wall outside the premises had been removed and that he feared that the
> bricks above the opening could fall. The landlord told me that he had taken
> photographs of the contractor who was seen hacking the walls. He told me
> that pursuant to what had happened to the premises without his approval, he
> wanted to re-possess the premises immediately and claim for damages. At his
> request I went to look at the opening from outside the premises to ascertain
> whether the bricks could fall from the top.

54\. In re-examination, Mr Yeo added that the Landlords representative had
said he wanted to take action against him (NE 72 line 14).

55\. On 21 October 2000, Kenneth Tan wrote to M N Swami to state:

> We refer to your fax to us dated 20 October 2000.
>

> We were instructed to reiterate that your clients authorised the renovation

>
> [Emphasis added.]

56\. Ms Chan said that it was she who tried to contact Mr Ng between 15 and 20
October 2000 (NE 33 line 10 to 16). She disagreed that it was Mr Ng who tried
to contact her about the sale of shares agreement.

57\. On 23 October 2000, the Landlords solicitors Dennis Singham & Teresa Chan
& Partners (Dennis Singham) sent an urgent fax to M N Swami. It stated:

> **No 33 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-01, #01-02, #01-03, #01-04 & #01-05/06
> Singapore 238977**
>
> **Tenancy Agreement dated 3 rd September 1999**

58\. In cross-examination, Ms Chan said that she had not informed Mr Ng about
Dennis Singhams fax but in re-examination she claimed that she did.

59\. Subsequently the Landlords solicitors met with M N Swami on 27 October
2000 as a result of which it was agreed that:

> (a) Honey would surrender the Premises on 30 October 2000 on receipt of the
> return of the deposit less $10,000 i.e $96,000 less $10,000.  
>  (b) The Landlord would undertake the responsibility of reinstating the
> Premises.  
>  (c) There would be no further claims by the Landlord or Honey against each
> other.

The Premises were accordingly surrendered on 30 October 2000 and $86,000 was
returned to Honey.

60\. In response to an inquiry by Kenneth Tan dated 30 October 2000 about the
draft agreement, M N Swami replied on 31 October 2000 to inform them that the
Premises had been returned to the Landlord.

61\. As far as reinstatement works were concerned, Ms Chan said she had
consulted Mr Yeo and he had estimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000. Mr
Yeo confirmed that it would cost not less than $300,000 (NE 66 line 15).

62\. On some of the items constituting the Unauthorised Works, Mr Yeos
evidence was that the cost of reinstating just the two party walls which were
demolished on Mr Ngs instructions was estimated to be $25,000 to $30,000. The
cost of reinstating the five toilets would be $10,000 each. On these items
alone, the cost would be about $80,000.

63\. Ms Chan said that Honey did not have the money to do reinstatement works
and this was not challenged.

64\. Mr Ngs evidence on doing reinstatement works vacillated.

65\. Initially when his attention was drawn to the fax dated 18 October 2000
from M N Swami to Kenneth Tan, he said that he did not take steps to reinstate
the Premises because he was of the view that this was not the solution (NE 16
line 16 to 21).

66\. He also did not believe that the Unauthorised Works would jeopardize the
tenancy agreement because they were not serious enough (NE 23 line 1 to 5). He
had taken the position that they did not affect the structural integrity of
the Premises.

67\. Then he said that as events unfolded he did not even have the chance to
reinstate or consider reinstating the Premises (NE 23 line 10 to 13).

68\. In his view, the matter could have been regularised with a bit of
communication with the Landlord. However his idea of regularisation was to
show the Landlord that Honey was not just taking steps to rectify what had
existed but to show his (Mr Ngs) plans to the Landlord so that the Landlord
could get the Certificate of Statutory Completion for the Premises (NE 24 line
10 to 17).

69\. He said he kept pursuing Ms Chan for the endorsement of the plans but he
was not successful (NE 24 line 19 to NE 25 line 12).

70\. On Ms Chans part, she said she took away the plan (or plans) from Mr Yeos
office as she did not want Mr Ng to carry on with renovation work without the
consent of the Landlord. She did not see any point in co-operating with Mr Ng
in view of the Unauthorised Works (para 43 of her AEIC).

71\. She disagreed that she was not willing to co-operate with Mr Ng to
rectify the situation with the Landlord (NE 40 line 9 to NE 41 line 8).

72\. As it turned out, the demolished party walls and toilets were not
reinstated and the Premises are currently used by someone else (NE 66 line 23
to NE 67 line 5).

_**  
ARGUMENTS AND MY CONCLUSION**_

73\. Mr Ng initially took the position that the Unauthorised Works did not
require the approval of any authority. He relied on a notice issued by the
Building Control Division, Public Works Department dated 1 April 1998.

74\. The notice states:

> _NOTICE TO OWNER OF NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS_
>
> EXEMPTION FROM APPROVAL FOR MINOR BUILDING WORKS  
>  AND ALTERATIONS TO NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
>
> 1\. Under the provisions of the Building Control Act (Cap. 29), certain

> the Building Authority. A list of these minor building works are given in
> Part A of the Schedule.
>
> 2\. Whilst these minor building works and alterations may be exempted under
> the Building Control Act, some of the works may be subject to the control of

77\. Appendix A states:

> Appendix A: BUILDING WORKS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE PLANNING PERMISSION FROM THE

> The above does not apply to gazetted conservation areas and monuments. (Back
> to Table of Content)

79\. As it turned out, the Premises were in a gazetted conservation area.

80\. Even if no permission of any relevant authority was required, Honey was
still required under Clause 2(h) of the tenancy agreement (set out in para 36
above) to ensure that any works mentioned in Clause 2(g) (which included the
Unauthorised Works) be carried out by specialist sub-contractors to be
approved by the Landlord and this was not done. Indeed, in para 8 of the
Supplement to Plaintiffs Opening Statement, it was conceded that the
Unauthorised Works were done without the concurrence of the Landlord.

81\. I would add that it was also conceded that they were done without the
concurrence of the Defendants although the faxes from Kenneth Tan dated 19 and
21 October 2000, which I have cited in paras 48 and 55 above, and Mr Ngs
pleadings had alleged that the Defendants/Ms Chan had authorised such works.

82\. Also, the insistence by Mr Ng that the Unauthorised Works were not
structural was besides the point. They were done in breach of the tenancy
agreement.

83\. Accordingly the fact that the demolished party walls and demolished
toilets have not been subsequently reinstated by the Landlord or a new tenant
and the Premises are being currently used by a new tenant did not assist Mr
Ng.

84\. Furthermore, while he categorised the Unauthorised Works as minor, Mr Yeo
described them as, Major and the landlord was very furious (NE 72 line 6).
Also, Mr Ng did not call any architect to give evidence on the nature of the
Unauthorised Works.

85\. The truth of the matter was that Mr Ng was in too much of a rush to do
the Unauthorised Works, because the faster I finish, the earlier I can open
the premises for business (NE 9 line 10).

86\. He had assumed that the Landlord would not mind the Unauthorised Works
and would allow him to get the paper work done concurrently with the physical
works as, in his view, that was the normal practice. In my view, even if this
was the normal practice, which would be against the law, a landlord should at
least be notified in advance of such works and his concurrence obtained.

87\. Mr Ng had said he did not want Honeys tenancy to be jeopardized when he
made some advance payments to or on behalf of Honey. Yet the Unauthorised
Works did precisely just that.

88\. Mr Edwin Kung, acting for Mr Ng, submitted that Ms Chan and the other
Defendants were repudiating the sale agreement and were evidencing an
intention not to be bound by it because they had put Honey in the position
where Honey would no longer have the tenancy. He also submitted that Mr Ng had
rescinded the sale agreement by a subsequent letter from Kenneth Tan dated 6
November 2000.

89\. In my view, there was no doubt that Ms Chan wanted to proceed with the
sale of the shares in Honey but the Unauthorised Works had put a spanner in
the works.

90\. The surrender of the tenancy was not to repudiate the sale agreement but
was to mitigate the damage caused by Mr Ngs irresponsible action as the
Landlord was threatening to terminate the tenancy, forfeit the deposit and
claim reinstatement and legal costs.

91\. Any suggestion that the draft agreement still had not been prepared by
her solicitors by 18 October 2000, must also be seen in the context of the
Unauthorised Works and the Landlords reaction thereto. Indeed, in para 7 of
the Supplement to Plaintiffs Opening Statement, it was conceded that the
Defendants had taken steps to get the agreement drafted.

92\. In addition, any suggestion that Ms Chan was subsequently withholding
plans must be seen in the context that she had trusted Mr Ng by handing over
the keys to the Premises only to discover that he had carried out the
Unauthorised Works. There was otherwise no reluctance on her part to assist
him. As I have mentioned, earlier she had on 10 or 11 October 2000, at his
request, when she met him at a hotel, signed some renovation plans.

93\. The main point raised for Mr Ng was that Honey should not have
surrendered the Premises to the Landlord.

94\. On this point, Mr Kung did not assert that there was no breach of the
tenancy agreement.

95\. Instead, he argued that the notice from the Landlords solicitors Dennis
Singham was invalid, relying on s 18(1) and (10) of the Conveyancing and Law
of Property Act (Cap 61) (CLPA).

96\. Section 18(1) CLPA states:

> Restrictions on and relief against forfeiture of leases.
>
> 18\. (1) A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any provision or
> stipulation in a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in a
> lease, shall not be enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless the lessor
> serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach complained of
> and, if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the
> breach, and, in any case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money
> for the breach, and the lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter,
> to remedy the breach, if it is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable
> compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the lessor, for the breach.

97\. Section 18(10) CLPA states:

> (10) This section shall apply to leases before, on or after 1st August 1886,
> and shall have effect notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary.

98\. Mr Kung argued that under s 18(1) CLPA the notice from Dennis Singham
must give sufficient details of the breach by Honey and this was not done.

99\. In _Lee Tat Realty Pte Ltd v Limco Products Manufacturing Pte Ltd & Ors_
[1999] 1 SLR 263, Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) said that a valid notice
under s 18(1) CLPA must contain sufficient particulars of the alleged breach.
With respect, I agree.

100\. In the present case before me, the notice from Dennis Singham, which is
set out in para 57 above, did set out some particulars of breach i.e the
removal of the party wall between the units and the removal of walls to the
toilets.

101\. However, it was not necessary for me to decide whether the notice
constituted sufficient particulars for the following reasons.

102\. First, the reference therein to Clause 2(j) of the tenancy agreement was
wrong. Clause 2(j) refers to the consent of the relevant authorities, and not
of the Landlord.

103\. Secondly, the breach was capable of remedy but the Landlord did not
require Honey to remedy the breach. This was contrary to s 18(1) CLPA.

104\. I accepted that the notice was invalid. However it did not follow that
Honey should not have surrendered the Premises.

105\. First, it would not serve much purpose to challenge the validity of the
notice unless Honey intended to carry out reinstatement works for which it
needed more time. After all, the Landlord could have sent a valid notice if
the validity of the first notice had been challenged.

106\. Secondly, it was not disputed that Honey did not have money to do
reinstatement works. Ms Chan also accepted that she was not aware of Honeys
right to do reinstatement works under s 18(1) CLPA.

107\. It was put to Ms Chan during her cross-examination that Mr Ng was not
aware that the Landlord was going to terminate the tenancy and Mr Ng did not
have an opportunity to carry out reinstatement works (NE 43 line 8 to NE 44
line 20).

108\. I accepted that the subsequent notice dated 23 October 2000 from Dennis
Singham was not brought to the attention of Kenneth Tan or Mr Ng until after
the Premises were surrendered, although Ms Chan had various telephone
discussions with Mr Ng.

109\. On this point, I did not accept Ms Chans belated evidence in re-
examination that she had mentioned the written notice from Dennis Singham to
Mr Ng in telephone discussions with Mr Ng between 24 to 27 October 2000. In
cross-examination, she had already said that she had not done so.

110\. I would add that there was no suggestion that the omission was
deliberate. Indeed, Ms Chan and Honey were under considerable pressure from
the Landlord to respond to the Landlords threat quickly.

111\. In any event, the omission did not mean that Mr Ng was completely
unaware of the danger that the Landlord might terminate the tenancy. The
danger had already been mentioned in the fax from M N Swami to Kenneth Tan
dated 18 October 2000 (see para 47 above).

112\. As for the allegation that Mr Ng did not have an opportunity to carry
out reinstatement works, the truth of the matter was that Mr Ng did not intend
to do reinstatement works.

113\. His intention was to carry on with what he had done. That is why he
asserted during cross-examination that he still expected the Landlord to
endorse his plans notwithstanding the Unauthorised Works (NE 17 line 15 to 17,
NE 23 line 22 to 24, NE 24 line 10 to 17).

114\. That is also why Mr Ng did nothing to redress the situation or placate
the Landlord. Even if Ms Chan did not orally tell him about the inspection on
20 October 2000, he knew about it from the fax dated 20 October 2000 from M N
Swami to Kenneth Tan, pursuant to which one key was sent via a messenger. He
did not turn up for the inspection. He also avoided approaching the Landlord
on the excuse that he had no contractual relationship with the Landlord. He
could and should have offered to see the Landlord with Ms Chan but he did not.
Yet he had the temerity to say that the matter could have been regularised
with a bit of communication with the Landlord.

115\. Furthermore, while Mr Kung criticised Honey for not relying on s 18(1)
CLPA, Kenneth Tan themselves did not raise this provision at the material
time. I find that they themselves had been unaware about it or had forgotten
about it then. That is why the question of reinstatement under s 18(1) CLPA
was never raised in their faxes/ correspondence to M N Swami before 30 October
2000. Even after 31 October 2000 when they were informed about the surrender
of the Premises, they did not assert in any fax or correspondence that
reinstatement works should have been done or that Mr Ng had been denied the
opportunity of doing such works. This was also not raised in Mr Ngs pleadings.

116\. I was of the view that s 18(1) CLPA was raised as an afterthought to
extricate Mr Ng from the mess he had created.

117\. Mr Kung also argued that the chain of causation had been broken by the
act of surrendering the Premises.

118\. I did not agree. The surrender of the Premises was an ordinary and
natural consequence of the Unauthorised Works.

119\. It may be that Honey could have mitigated by doing reinstatement works
but that is a different point which was not specifically pleaded by Mr Ng.

120\. Secondly, Honey had acted on the advice of its architect Mr Yeo who had
estimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000 and Honey did not have this sum
or even the $80,000 I have mentioned in para 62 above. It must be remembered
that Honey was in dire financial straits, and that is why it had to obtain
advance payment from Mr Ng.

121\. Thirdly, Honey had acted on the advice of its solicitors in agreeing to
surrender the Premises with a forfeiture of only $10,000 of its deposit. As I
have said, the intention behind the surrender was with a view to mitigating
its damages.

122\. Fourthly, at no time prior to 30 October 2000 did Kenneth Tan suggest
that reinstatement works be done.

123\. Fifthly, everything was happening very quickly, starting with the shock
of learning about the Unauthorised Works and the Landlords fury.

124\. It may well be that the Landlord was taking advantage of the situation
but it was a situation created by Mr Ng.

125\. In all the circumstances, I did not think that Honey had acted
unreasonably or had failed to mitigate (assuming this had been pleaded) by
surrendering the Premises.

126\. Accordingly, I was of the view that it was not Ms Chan and the Second
and Third Defendants who were in breach of contract but Mr Ng. His purported
rescission of the sale agreement was wrongful.

127\. By his deliberate act in carrying out the Unauthorised Works, he had
made it impossible for the First, Second and Third Defendants to carry out
their part of the sale agreement. In my view, this entitled them not only to
be excused from being unable to provide the tenancy and carry on with the sale
agreement but also to claim damages from him._****_
