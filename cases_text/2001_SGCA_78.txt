**Judgment**

_**(Costs)**_

1\. When we delivered our judgment on 21 November 2001, we had reservations
whether the general rule that costs follow the event should apply in the
circumstances of this case. We therefore invited counsel to submit written
arguments on the question of costs. Accordingly, written arguments from
counsel were submitted, which we have now considered.

2\. We think that there are good reasons why we should not apply the general
rule here with regard to costs here and below. In the proceedings below, BNP
raised numerous claims against the respondents, which took up a great deal of
the time and occasioned considerable costs. In our view, their claims against
the respondents for dishonestly assisting Gary to commit a breach of his
fiduciary duties to BNP, for procuring Gary to commit a breach of contract,
for conspiracy to injure BNP, and for breach of duty by the respondents to
BNP, had no merits and should not have been raised at all. These heads of
claim formed a very substantial part of what they had pleaded in the amended
statement of claim. From the judgment below, it appears that lengthy arguments
had been addressed to the judge on these claims. Instead, BNP should have
focussed their attention on the following issues: (i) whether the respondents
knew or were aware that Gary was carrying out the transactions in question in
their names and for their account, and (ii) whether Gary had actual and/or
apparent authority to carry out such transactions.

3\. In our judgment, BNP had raised claims and issues which unnecessarily
protracted proceedings below and added to the complexity of those proceedings.
In the circumstances, they should not be allowed the whole of the costs below.
We would award BNP only 25% of the costs below. We so order.

4\. Before us, counsel for BNP submits that a certificate of two counsel under
O 59, r 19 should be allowed on the ground that the appeal involved complex
issues of fact and law, and the documents and record of the trial were
voluminous. We do not agree. We did not find any complex issues of fact or law
raised in the appeal. The main issues were the two referred to in 2 on which
we said that BNP should have focussed their attention. It is true that the
documents and record of the trial were voluminous, but that was due
substantially to the manner in which BNP had presented their case below.
Further, a great deal of the documents before us consisted of forms of
acknowledgements and confirmations, which in substance were repetitive.

5\. Next, counsel for BNP seeks an unusual order. Shee Chin and Nancy were
separately represented by solicitors and counsel in the proceedings below and
before us, and on that ground counsel for BNP asked that their clients be
awarded a set each of costs against Shee Chin and Nancy. It is best we set out
their arguments verbatim:

> 7\. This is on the basis that the Respondents chose two separate sets of
> solicitors even though they were, essentially, running the same defence and
> the Appellant had to meet two separate submissions and cases.
>
> 8\. In fact, the Respondents were each awarded a separate set of costs of
> the trial and the same should be applied against them when the appeal has
> been allowed. The Appellant relies on the case of _**Lim Heng Hoo v Tan Hock
> Hai & Ors**_ [1976] 2 MLJ 159.

This argument has absolutely no merit, and we have no hesitation in rejecting
it. The respondents, though separately represented, raised the same defences
in law. Their interests in the proceedings coincided and no separate issues
were raised. The position would still be the same, if they were both
represented by the same solicitors and counsel. There was no reason to award
to BNP a separate set of costs payable by each of the respondents.

6\. We now come to the issue of whether BNP should be allowed the full costs
of the appeal. In the Appellants Case, and also in the arguments before us,
BNP still maintained their claim against the respondents for dishonestly
assisting Gary in committing a breach his fiduciary duties to BNP and devoted
a substantial part of the arguments on that issue. As we have said, this claim
had no merit. It unnecessarily incurred costs and added to the complexity of
the appeal.

7\. Lastly, although BNP in their Case dealt at great length with the facts
showing that the respondents knew or were aware that Gary was carrying out the
transactions in question in their names and for their account, on the issue of
law on the actual and apparent authority, we did not find that BNP provided
much assistance. No authorities were cited by them in support of their
arguments on the question of actual or apparent authority.

8\. In all the circumstances, we would allow BNP only 40% of the costs of the
appeal. We so order. There will be the usual consequential order for the
refund to BNP or their solicitors of the deposit in court, with interest, if
any.
