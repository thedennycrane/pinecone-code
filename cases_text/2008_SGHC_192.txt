Choo Han Teck J:

1 The action under this Originating Summons was principally for payment of the
plaintiff’s fees as arbitrator in an arbitration involving the defendants. The
subject of the arbitration is not material in the application before me, which
was an appeal by the second defendant against the decision of the Assistant
Registrar Mr Leong Kwang Ian (“AR Leong”) made on 20 August 2008 refusing to
set aside the directions made by Assistant Registrar Teo Guan Siew (“AR Teo”)
made on 30 May 2008. The second defendant claimed that AR Leong had no
jurisdiction to hear his application to set aside AR Teo’s directions. The
second defendant was not represented and was unclear in his submission as to
what he really wanted as well as his grounds for them.

2 It appeared that he was unhappy that AR Teo and AR Leong refused his
application to strike out the plaintiff’s affidavits of “24 July 2007 and 22
November 2007”. Those affidavits were in support of the substantive hearing of
this Originating Summons. I am of the view that there was no basis to find the
orders irregular or wrong. If AR Teo was giving directions at a pre-trial
conference, any party may apply formally to another assistant registrar for
ancillary orders or to have the directions made at the pre-trial conference
varied. The subsequent orders by the assistant registrar would be subject to
appeal in the normal course of events. I was of the view that the affidavits
in question should be allowed. The plaintiff’s affidavit of 24 July 2007 was
in response and answer to the second and third defendants’ affidavits. The
plaintiff’s affidavit of 22 November 2007 merely attached the Rules of the
Singapore Institute of Architects.

3 Since the second defendant was unrepresented, I explained to him that the
dismissal of his appeal would not prevent him from arguing that the matters
deposed in the said affidavits were not relevant to the plaintiff’s case at
the hearing of the Originating Summons. Further, I asked if he needed to file
any affidavit in response to those two affidavits and he said that he did not
wish to.

4 For the reason above, the appeal was dismissed.
