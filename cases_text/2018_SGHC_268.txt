High Court — Criminal Case No 61 of 2018  
Audrey Lim JC  
13–16 August, 5 November 2018

Audrey Lim JC:

Introduction

1 The accused (“Nabill”) claimed trial to two charges under the Misuse of
Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”), which read as follows:

(1st Charge)

That you, Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad,

on 27 January 2016, at about 8.02 p.m., at Blk 440B Fernvale Link, [unit xxx],
Singapore, did traffic in a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First
Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), to
wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, sixty-four
(64) packets containing 1,827.21 grams of granular/powdery substance, which
was analysed and found to contain not less than 63.41 grams of diamorphine,
without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder,
and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2)
punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA, and further upon your conviction under s
5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, you may alternatively be liable to be
punished under s 33B of the MDA.

(2nd Charge)

That you, Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad,

on 27 January 2016, at about 8.02 p.m., at Blk 440B Fernvale Link, [unit xxx],
Singapore, did traffic in a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First
Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), to
wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, nine (9)
blocks containing not less than 2,251.90 grams of vegetable matter, which was
analysed and found to be cannabis, without authorisation under the said Act or
the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence
under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA, and
further upon your conviction under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, you
may alternatively be liable to be punished under s 33B of the MDA.

2 At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved
beyond a reasonable doubt the two charges against Nabill, and I convicted him
on the charges. Under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the
MDA, the prescribed punishment is death. Pursuant to s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA,
the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty if the requirements
set out in s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA are satisfied. I found that the requirements
of s 33B(2)(a) were not satisfied and further, the Prosecution did not issue a
certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA.
Accordingly, I passed the mandatory death sentence on Nabill.

3 Nabill has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence.

The Prosecution’s case

Events leading up to and the arrest of Nabill

4 On 27 January 2016, Senior Staff Sergeant Ika Zahary bin Kasmari (“SSgt
Ika”) from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“the CNB”) briefed a party of CNB
officers about an operation relating to Nabill, who was suspected of being
involved in drug activities.

5 Around 7pm that day, CNB officers arrived at a multi-storey carpark beside
Block 440B Fernvale Link and began observing Nabill’s apartment (“the Flat”).
At about 8pm, Nabill and one Mohamed Khairul Bin Jabar (“Khairul”) were
arrested when they were both leaving the Flat. The CNB officers then entered
the Flat and arrested one Mashitta Binte Dawood (“Mashitta”), Nabill’s wife.
Khairul was arrested because he was found with two packets of methamphetamine
in his bag and Mashitta was arrested because she was a suspected drug addict.

6 The CNB officers proceeded to search the Flat in Nabill’s presence. The
following exhibits were seized from “Bedroom 1” (with the serial numbers of
the items forming the subject of the charges in bold and underline): 1

more drugs in the Flat, to which Nabill replied, “storeroom”. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

PB 340, para 8.

SSgt Richard did not hear the conversation between SSgt Ika and Nabill, but
was informed of it by SSgt Ika. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

13/8/18 NE 63.

SSgt Ika stated that after the search of Bedroom 1 had ended, he asked Nabill
“ada lagi” (meaning “still some more”), essentially to ask Nabill if there
were any more drugs in the Flat. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

PB 308, para 8; 15/8/18 NE 47, 52, 59.

SSgt Ika stated that Nabill answered “storeroom” and he then escorted Nabill
to the storeroom at about 9.45pm.

8 The storeroom was searched in Nabill’s presence and SSgt Richard seized the
following items from the storeroom (with serial numbers of items forming the
subject matter of the charges in bold and underline): 22

located on the top of the metal rack closer to another wall, meaning that the
trolley bag and the cartons of cigarettes were in “totally two different
directions” if one were to point at either of them from where Nabill was
standing outside the door of the storeroom. 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

13/8/18 NE 64–65, 69, 72, 76; see P18.

10 Around 10.10pm, SSgt Ika escorted Nabill to the master bedroom and the

Drugs which formed the subject of the charges

12 Among the items seized, the following drugs formed the subject of the two
charges against Nabill:

(a) 64 packets containing 1,827.21g of granular/powdery substance, which was
analysed and found to contain not less than 63.41g of diamorphine. Save for
one packet which was found on the bed in Bedroom 1 (G1A1; see S/N 2 at [6]
above), all these packets were found in the “Akira” box in Bedroom 1 (ie, S/N
14–16, 18–20 and 22–24 at [6] above); and

(b) nine blocks of vegetable matter found to contain not less than 2,251.9g of
cannabis, all of which were recovered from the trolley bag in the storeroom
(ie, S/N 35–39 and 41–43 at [8] above).

Nabill’s handphone records

13 The Prosecution tendered the records of calls and messages found on
Nabill’s Samsung handphone (exhibit “MN-HP1”) and iPhone (exhibit “MN-HP2”).
38

##### Foot Note 38

×

PB 65, PB 511 and PB 1530.

It is not disputed that the two handphones belonged to Nabill, even though MN-
HP1 was registered in Mashitta’s name and MN-HP2 was registered in the name of
Nabill’s friend, one Salinah Binte Alit. 39

##### Foot Note 39

Exhibit H; PB 65, PB 97; 14/8/18 NE 19; 16/8/18 NE 46.

Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) analysis and DNA evidence

14 The Defence did not dispute the items seized from the Flat or HSA’s reports
on and analysis of the nature and quantity of drugs seized from the Flat. 40

##### Foot Note 40

×

14/8/18 NE 90; 15/8/18 NE 69, 117–119; PB 116–170.

Additionally, blood samples were taken from Nabill, Mashitta, Khairul and
Nabill’s cousin, Sheikh Sufian (“Sufian”). The DNA profiles obtained from them
were not in dispute. 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

Exhibit E; PB 171–173; 14/8/18 NE 81.

15 Dr Pook Sim Hwee, an Analyst from the DNA Profiling Laboratory of the HSA,
submitted a report of her analysis of the DNA profiles obtained from swabs of
various exhibits that were seized from the Flat. 42

##### Foot Note 42

×

PB 174–246; 14/8/18 NE 62–82.

For purposes of referring to the HSA DNA report, it bears mentioning that
barcode number S142296 refers to Nabill’s DNA, and barcode number S142244
refers to Faizal’s DNA. 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

14/08/18 NE 30–31; 67.

Nabill’s DNA was found on various items, including:

(a) the exterior surface of F1E3 (a ziplock bag which was found to contain 10
mini packets containing diamorphine);

(b) the exterior surface of F1D3A (one of the mini packets containing
diamorphine found inside a ziplock bag F1D3); 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

PB 181; 13/8/18 109–110.

(c) the exterior surface of F1F4 (a pack containing methamphetamine tablets);

(d) the exterior surface of a roll of plastic wrapper (F1G3A);

(e) the exterior of the “Mintek” bag (G1); and

(f) the exterior and interior surfaces of G1A (a plastic bag which was found
to contain one packet of diamorphine).

16 Dr Pook explained that where there is an “uninterpretable component” in
addition to a matchable contributor of DNA, the uninterpretable component
refers to DNA that is present in such a low level that it is not possible to
match the DNA to any person’s DNA profile. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

14/8/18 NE 70.

Where the report states that “no interpretable DNA profile” could be obtained,
Dr Pook explained that this could be because there was no DNA found at all, or
because the DNA profile was contributed to by so many persons that it could
not be matched to an individual contributor. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

14/8/18 NE 76–78.

Dr Pook also explained that whether a person’s DNA is found on an object
depends on various factors, including his propensity to shed cells, whether
and how much of his DNA was transferred from another item to that object, and
the duration and intensity of contact between him and the object.

Forensic examination of plastic films and plastic bags seized from the Flat

17 Yew Sok Yee (“Yew”), a Forensic Scientist with the HSA, examined the
physical characteristics of the plastic bags seized from the Flat to determine
if they could be associated with one another. 47

##### Foot Note 47

×

PB 247–269; 13/8/18 NE 80–93; Exhibit C.

She examined the manufacturing marks and polarising marks on the bags.
Polarising patterns or manufacturing marks are incidental to the process of
manufacturing plastic bags and can be caused or created by various parts of
the manufacturing machine such as the dye, mandrel or rollers. 48

##### Foot Note 48

×

Exhibit C3.

They are not visible to the naked eye but can be seen under a polarising light
and by microscopic examination respectively. Yew examined the bags seized from
the Flat to see if they were “physically fitted to one another”, meaning
whether the manufacturing marks flowed through from one bag to the next and so
on. 49

##### Foot Note 49

×

13/8/18 NE 80; Exhibit C1.

If the manufacturing marks did not flow from one bag to the next, it could be
said that the bags were not manufactured in sequence (eg, there was a missing
bag manufactured in between the bags being examined). Nonetheless, if there
were similar clusters of manufacturing marks, some inferences could be drawn
about the likelihood of their being manufactured by the same machine. 50

##### Foot Note 50

×

Exhibit C2; 13/8/18 NE 80–81.

18 Yew concluded that J1A (40 bags found in Bedroom 1) and F1D1, F1D2 and F1D3
(the three plastic bags which contained a total of 30 mini-packets of
diamorphine) could have been manufactured by the same machine or machines that
manufacture bags with similar characteristics. This is because there were
similar clusters of manufacturing marks even though they did not flow from one
bag to the other. However, Yew could not tell how probable it was that all
these bags had been manufactured by the same machine. 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

13/8/18 NE 82.

19 Yew also concluded that the following bags were manufactured by the same
machine as one another: 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

PB 258-259.

(a) two bags in J1A and the two bags F1D1 and F1D3;

(b) 11 bags in J1A, one bag in F1D1A and one bag in F1D2A;

(c) three bags in J2A, one bag in F1D1A and one bag in F1D3A;

(d) two bags in J2A and one bag in F1D3A;

(e) 48 bags in J2A and one bag in F1D2A; and

(f) one bag in J1A and three bags in F1D1A.

Yew’s conclusion in these cases was based on the fact that the lines flowed
from one bag to the other. 53

##### Foot Note 53

×

As depicted in Exhibit C1.

Yew also explained that the bags F1D2, F1D3, one of the bags from J1A (which
Yew labelled “J1A-V41”) and another bag from J1A (which Yew labelled
“J1A-V40”) were actually manufactured in that sequence as the manufacturing
marks on those four bags flowed from one bag to the next in that order.

Urine tests and medical examination of Nabill

20 On 28 January 2016 at about 10.36pm, Nabill was subjected to an instant
urine test, in which he tested positive for amphetamine. Nabill’s urine sample
was also brought to the HSA on 29 January 2016 for testing and found to
contain methamphetamine.

21 Dr Yak Si Mian conducted a pre-statement medical examination of Nabill on 1
February 2016 at about 8.15pm. 54

##### Foot Note 54

×

PB 270–272.

Nabill informed Dr Yak that he had used methamphetamine and heroin the
previous Thursday and was suffering from mild withdrawal symptoms, including
nausea/retching and shivering/tremors. Dr Yak observed Nabill to be fully
alert and oriented to time, place and person during the examination.
Additionally, rhinorrhea and tremors were noted. Dr Yak also conducted a post-
statement medical examination of Nabill on the same day at about 10.15pm. 55

##### Foot Note 55

×

PB 273–274.

Dr Yak stated that Nabill had the same complaints as during the pre-statement
medical examination, namely that he had mild drug withdrawal symptoms.
However, Dr Yak observed during the examination that Nabill was fully alert
and oriented to time, place and person.

22 On 29 January 2016, Nabill was referred by the CNB to the Complex Medical
Centre for observation for drug withdrawal. Dr Henry Chua prepared a medical
report of the medical examinations conducted by Dr Xu Bang Yu, Dr Tan Chong
Hun and Dr Sahaya Nathan respectively on 30 and 31 January and 1 February
2016. 56

##### Foot Note 56

×

PB 275–278.

During the period of observation, Nabill complained of stomach cramps, nausea,
body aches and runny nose. Dr Chua opined that based on clinical assessment,
Nabill was “positive for non-opoid drug withdrawal”. In his oral evidence, Dr
Chua stated that it was not possible for a clinician to tell how severe the
withdrawal was and that drug withdrawal symptoms for non-opoid drugs (and
methamphetamine) would generally last between two to seven days, depending on
the person and the amount of drugs consumed. 57

##### Foot Note 57

×

15/8/18 NE 15.

23 Finally, Dr Kelvin Ng examined Nabill on 22 and 23 February and 4 March
2016 for the purposes of providing a psychiatric evaluation. 58

##### Foot Note 58

×

PB 279–283.

In Dr Ng’s report, Nabill described to Dr Ng what had happened the night
before and on the day of his arrest, referring to details such as his friend
“Dhanesh” purportedly leaving a box in a room in the Flat which Dhanesh
usually occupied, this being the box that the CNB officers subsequently seized
and was found to contain drugs.

Nabill’s statements

24 The Prosecution tendered various statements recorded from Nabill. Nabill
did not object to their admissibility. 59

##### Foot Note 59

×

15/8/18 NE 69.

I will refer to the statements briefly in chronological order, as they are
material to the findings I made. It is not disputed that by “heroin”, “ice”
and “erimin”, Nabill was referring to diamorphine, methamphetamine and
nimetazepam respectively. I will therefore use the respective pairs of terms
interchangeably.

25 First, Nabill gave a contemporaneous statement recorded by ASP Seak on 27
January 2016 at about 10.50pm at the Flat (about three hours after his arrest)
(“the 1st Statement”) in which he stated as follows: 60

##### Foot Note 60

×

PB 293–300; 13/8/18 NE 31–37.

(a) The erimin tablets (G1B1 and G1C1) belonged to Danish, who had brought
them for Nabill to sell.

(b) The heroin (G1A1) and the “ecstasy” pills (F1F1 to F1F4) belonged to
Danish.

(c) The three large packets and two plastic bags of mini packets of heroin
(F1A, F1B, F1C, F1D and F1E) must have been brought to the Flat by Danish that
morning while Nabill was asleep, and Nabill had never seen them before.

(d) The cannabis blocks (B1D, B1E, B1F1, B1F2, B1F3, B1A1, B1B1 and B1C1) did
not belong to him.

(e) The “ice” found in Nabill’s master bedroom (D1A) was for his personal
consumption.

(f) The weighing scales (H1B and H1C) belonged to Nabill and were used by
Danish and Sufian to pack drugs. Nabill claimed that he was not involved in
packing.

(g) Nabill would ask Khairul, his friend, to help him sell his drugs, but had
not passed Khairul any drugs on the night of their arrest.

26 Second, a contemporaneous statement was recorded by ASP Seak on 28 January
2016 at about 4.45am at the Flat (“the 2nd Statement”). The CNB officers and
Nabill had not left the Flat since Nabill’s arrest. 61

##### Foot Note 61

×

PB 301–304; 13/8/18 NE 42.

Nabill stated that Sufian, his cousin, would know about the drugs found in the
Flat because Sufian had let Danish into the Flat on the morning prior to
Nabill’s arrest at around 3am. Nabill claimed that before he went to bed, he
had informed Sufian to open the door and let Danish into the Flat. He stated
that during the night, he heard the door opening and heard Danish’s voice. He
also stated that Danish would usually come to the Flat at about 3am to “drop
drugs” and “rest awhile”.

27 Third, after a first charge relating to diamorphine was read to him, Nabill
gave a cautioned statement recorded by ASP Peh Zhen Hao (“ASP Peh”) on 1
February 2016 at 9.15pm (“the 3rd Statement”). 62

##### Foot Note 62

×

PB 397–399.

Nabill stated that he had no intention to traffic in drugs and that it was
Danish who owned the drugs. Danish had informed Nabill that “someone will pick
up the thing” and he would return to pick up the money, but had not informed
Nabill what “the thing” contained and “how much thing” was in there. Nabill
felt that he was “framed” by Danish and he would not have “[taken] the risk”
if he knew that Danish was “bringing this much in [his] house”.

28 Fourth, in a statement recorded by ASP Peh on 2 February 2016 at about
9.27am (“the 4th Statement”), 63

##### Foot Note 63

×

PB 400–434.

Nabill stated as follows:

(a) He gave a fairly detailed account of how he first met Danish in early 2015
and how they would go out for drinks together. Sometime in October 2015,
Danish asked Nabill if he could stay over at the Flat and leave for work the
next day from there. Nabill agreed and from then onwards, Danish would stay at
the Flat frequently, almost five days a week (on the weekdays), in Bedroom 1
together with Sufian.

(b) Around 3am on 27 January 2016, Danish came to the Flat to sleep. Nabill
was aware that Danish had planned to come to the Flat and had asked Sufian to
open the door for Danish. Nabill asked Danish to bring 25g of “ice” for his
(Nabill’s) consumption. The “ice” found in Bedroom 1 could have been brought
by Danish for Nabill, though Danish had brought more than Nabill had asked
for. As for the drugs found in the “Akira” box (F1) in Bedroom 1 and the
cannabis found in the trolley bag (B1) in the storeroom, Nabill was sure that
Danish had brought them to his Flat on 27 January 2016, because these items
were not there when Nabill was fixing the wardrobe in Bedroom 1 and the rack
in the storeroom on 26 January 2016. After Danish left the Flat at about 5am,
he messaged Nabill to say that someone will come and pick up the “things”
within half an hour, but no one came. Nabill woke up at 10am and saw Danish’s
message. He then tried to call Danish every hour and Danish kept telling him
that he would come to pick up the things, but he did not.

(c) Nabill stated that Danish had brought 25g of “ice” for him on three
occasions, once in December 2015 and twice in January 2016. However, each
time, Danish would bring more than 25g so that Nabill could sell the extra.
Nabill thought this was a “trap” because Danish would not take back the extra
“ice” and wanted Nabill to “clear” them for him. However, Nabill had not sold
any of the “ice” yet, which was why they were still in large packets. He said
he did not even know how to go about selling drugs.

29 Fifth, Nabill gave a statement recorded by ASP Peh on 2 February 2016 at
about 8.40pm (“the 5th Statement”). 64

##### Foot Note 64

×

PB 435–436.

He stated that Sufian was in the Flat on 26 January 2016. Nabill, Sufian and
Mashitta fixed the rack in the storeroom that day, and Sufian was in the Flat
until about 2pm or 3pm on 27 January 2016.

30 Sixth, in a statement recorded by ASP Peh on 3 February 2016 at about
2.23pm (“the 6th Statement”), 65

##### Foot Note 65

×

PB 437–446.

Nabill stated as follows:

(a) He started smoking “ice” around September 2015 due to Danish’s influence.
Danish also started to stay at the Flat regularly since November 2015, almost
every weekday, every week. Sufian knew Danish because Sufian would open the
door for him when he came to the Flat late at night when Nabill was already
sleeping.

(b) Sufian had let Danish into the Flat in the early morning of 27 January
2016, as Nabill went to bed earlier at around 11pm on 26 January 2016. Danish
left the Flat at about 5am on 27 January 2016.

(c) Nabill reiterated that on previous occasions when Danish brought “ice”, he
would bring larger quantities than what Nabill had requested for. After
quarrelling with Danish for bringing such large quantities, he would return
the extra amounts to Danish. However, Danish never took the extra amounts of
“ice” out of the Flat but would leave them in the black pouch (H1) on the
floor beside the bed in Bedroom 1 and would continue to ask Nabill to “clear”
the “ice” for him.

31 Seventh, after a second charge relating to cannabis was read to Nabill, he
gave a cautioned statement recorded by ASP Peh on 23 May 2016 between 10.40am
and 11.03am (“the 7th Statement”). 66

##### Foot Note 66

×

PB 447–449.

Nabill stated that the cannabis in the trolley bag was not his and was brought
to the Flat by Faizal.

32 Eighth, Nabill gave a statement recorded by ASP Peh on 24 May 2016 at about
2.08pm (“the 8th Statement”), in the course of which he was questioned about
persons appearing in snapshots of CCTV footage, and he stated as follows: 67

##### Foot Note 67

×

PB 450–466.

(a) When Danish brought “ice” for Nabill, it would be in a transparent ziplock
bag and the packet would be wrapped in black tape.

(b) Nabill also, for the first time, stated that Danish had never come to the
Flat. Nabill explained that he obtained his supply of “ice” from Danish and it
was through Faizal that he came to know Danish.

(c) Nabill claimed that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat as
Faizal was at the Flat on the evening of 26 January 2016. He did not see
Faizal bring the trolley bag into the Flat as he was asleep when Faizal
arrived, but the “heroin”, cannabis, “erimin” and “ecstasy” found in the Flat
must have been in the trolley bag.

33 Ninth, in a statement recorded by ASP Peh on 28 July 2016 at about 2.37pm
(“the 9th Statement”), 68

##### Foot Note 68

×

PB 467–471.

Nabill stated as follows:

(a) He obtained his “ice” supply from Faizal who in turned obtained it from
Danish. His order was for around 50g of “ice” a week. He had never seen Danish
before and Danish had never been to the Flat. Faizal went to the Flat
regularly, about three to five times a week, to smoke “ice”.

(b) Faizal had previously left “heroin”, cannabis, “erimin” and “ecstasy” in
the Flat. Nabill knew the nature of the drugs because Faizal had told him so
when asked. However, he did not know what quantity of drugs Faizal had left in
the Flat. Nabill would call Faizal to come and retrieve the drugs, and
sometimes Faizal would only retrieve them from the Flat the next day.

(c) Nabill stated that when Faizal came to the Flat on the night of 26 January
2016, he was aware that Faizal had gone there to place a trolley bag. He had
asked Faizal what the trolley bag contained and Faizal informed him that it
contained cigarettes. Nabill only realised that the trolley bag contained
drugs after his arrest. He maintained that he was asleep when Faizal came to
the Flat with the trolley bag.

34 Finally, in a statement recorded by ASP Peh on 7 October 2016 at about
9.36am (“the 10th Statement”), 69

##### Foot Note 69

×

PB 472–476.

Nabill reiterated that Danish had never been to the Flat, he had never seen
Danish before, and he obtained his “ice” supply from Faizal who in turn
obtained it from Danish. Nabill also stated that he only saw the trolley bag
in the storeroom at around 2pm on 27 January 2016. As for the drugs found in
Bedroom 1, Nabill did not know if they were brought by Faizal in the trolley
bag. He only saw those drugs when he woke up at about 2pm on 27 January 2016
to find the drugs laid out in Bedroom 1, and shortly after, quarrelled with
Mashitta. During the quarrel, Mashitta threw the drugs at him as she was angry
that people had come to the Flat “to do drugs and to make use of [Nabill]”. He
then picked up the drugs and put them at one side.

Close of the Prosecution’s case

35 At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was sufficient
evidence against Nabill for him to be called upon to give evidence in his
defence. Nabill chose to testify but did not call any other witnesses.

Nabill’s case

36 Nabill and Mashitta were the registered owners of the Flat and they
occupied the master bedroom. He consumed “ice” on a daily basis, at times with
his friends (including Faizal and Khairul) and his cousins (Sufian and
Hizamudin). Sufian lived in the Flat in Bedroom 1, whilst Hizamudin and his
friends would come to the Flat about three to five times a week.

37 Nabill claimed that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat and
placed it in the storeroom without his knowledge. On 26 January 2016, Nabill
went to sleep at about 7pm. At about 8.20pm, Faizal came to the Flat but
Nabill did not see Faizal then as he was asleep. He only found out that Faizal
was at the Flat when Mashitta woke him up at around 10pm. He claimed that
Faizal came to his house on 26 January 2016 to pass methamphetamine to him. 70

##### Foot Note 70

×

16/8/18 NE 27.

When he woke up, Faizal and he went to Bedroom 1 to chat, and there Faizal
passed him some methamphetamine. Faizal left the Flat at about 10.20pm, and
Nabill escorted him downstairs via the lift. Nabill only discovered the
trolley bag at about 4pm on 27 January 2016 (when he saw it in the storeroom)
and only realised that it contained drugs after he was arrested. 71

##### Foot Note 71

×

16/8/18 NE 30, 48–49; PB 473.

Nabill claimed that the trolley bag must have contained all the drugs seized
from the Flat including the drugs found in the “Akira” box in Bedroom 1 (save
for the methamphetamine in the master bedroom toilet which Nabill admitted he
knew about and explained was for his consumption). This was because he did not
see any drugs in the Flat when he woke up at 10pm on 26 January 2016 and even
in the morning and afternoon of 27 January 2016. 72

##### Foot Note 72

×

16/8/18 NE 22–23.

38 As for the drugs in Bedroom 1, Nabill first discovered them on the bed on
27 January 2016 at about 2pm when he quarrelled with Mashitta. He claimed that
Sufian had placed them there and suspected that they belonged to either Faizal
or Danish. 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

16/8/18 NE 33, 68, 74.

When he saw the items on the bed, he knew then that some of them (ie, F1A,
F1B, F1C, F1D and F1E) were diamorphine. 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

16/8/18 NE 64.

During the quarrel, Mashita threw the drugs at him and he then picked them all
up and “chucked” them into the empty “Akira” box (which had been in Bedroom 1
all along). 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

16/8/18 NE 34, 64, 74.

He then called Faizal and Sufian to ask them to clear the “stuff”. 76

##### Foot Note 76

×

16/8/18 NE 34.

It was during this call that Nabill asked Faizal what was in the trolley bag,
and Faizal told him that it was cigarettes. 77

##### Foot Note 77

×

16/8/18 NE 29.

39 Regarding the events of his arrest, Nabill stated that after the CNB
officers had searched Bedroom 1, SSgt Ika asked him “ada barang salah lagi?”
(meaning “any more illegal things/items”) or “ada barang lagi” (meaning any
more things”). 78

##### Foot Note 78

×

16/8/18 NE 7, 82.

Nabill replied, “ada in the storeroom” (meaning, “have/got in the storeroom”)
and they proceeded to the storeroom. 79

##### Foot Note 79

×

16/8/18 NE 7.

Nabill stated that he did not point to the trolley bag in the storeroom. He
claimed that the black trash bag containing the contraband cigarettes was on
the floor beside the ladder in the storeroom. Nabill explained that when he
said, “ada, in the storeroom,” he meant to inform the CNB officers that there
were cigarettes in the storeroom. 80

##### Foot Note 80

×

16/8/18 NE 38.

40 After his arrest and while still at the Flat, Nabill had informed the CNB
officers that all the drugs found there belonged to Danish. He then called
Danish to ask him when he was coming to the Flat to collect the items. 81

##### Foot Note 81

×

16/8/18 NE 11.

However, in his later statements to CNB, Nabill claimed that he had never met
Danish and that Danish had never gone to the Flat. Nabill explained that when
he gave the 1st to 6th Statements, all of which attributed the drugs to
Danish, he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms and he also genuinely
believed that Danish had brought the drugs to the Flat because Danish was the
drug supplier. 82

##### Foot Note 82

×

16/8/18 NE 17–18.

Nabill explained that he changed his evidence from the 7th Statement onwards
to state that Faizal had brought the drugs to the Flat because he discovered
from Mashitta (who had been informed by their domestic helper) that Faizal had
brought the trolley bag to the Flat. 83

##### Foot Note 83

×

16/8/18 NE 19–20.

This was why he stated in the 7th Statement that the CNB ought to check the
CCTV footage to see if it captured Faizal bringing the trolley bag to the
Flat. 84

##### Foot Note 84

×

16/8/18 NE 19.

Nabill maintained that the account given from the 7th Statement onwards was
the more accurate one. 85

The law

41 The elements to be proved for a charge of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read
with s 5(2) of the MDA are: (a) possession of a controlled drug (which may be
proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(1) of the MDA or deemed pursuant to s
18(4) of the MDA); (b) knowledge of the nature of the drug (which may be
proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA); and (c) proof that
possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not
authorised (see Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other
matters [2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59]).

42 Additionally, the relevant rebuttable presumptions in ss 17, 18(1) and
18(2) of the MDA provide as follows:

Presumption concerning trafficking

17. Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than —

…

(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine;

(d) 15 grammes of cannabis;

…

whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture,
shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of
trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for
that purpose.

Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs

18. – (1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control – 

(a) anything containing a controlled drug;

…

(c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a
controlled drug is found; or

…

shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his
possession.

(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his
possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the
nature of that drug.

43 As regards the element of possession, the Court of Appeal in Zainal bin
Hamad v PP [2018] SGCA 62 (“Zainal”) held that where the Prosecution seeks to
prove the fact of possession, it must prove not only that the accused was in
possession of the package or the container but also that he knew that it
contained something, which may later be established to be the drugs in
question (at [12]). The Prosecution need not prove that the accused
specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs or even of something that
turns out to be contraband; the question of whether he knows the package or
container contains drugs is an inquiry that arises when considering the
question of knowledge rather than of possession (at [12]–[13]). Once it is
proved that the accused had physical control over or possession of the package
or container that contains the thing in question, the court is entitled to
infer that he had knowledge of the existence of that thing. It is then
incumbent on the accused to discharge the evidential burden by raising a
reasonable doubt that this was not the case (at [16]). In an appropriate case,
the Prosecution may also rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1)
of the MDA.

44 In the present case, the Prosecution proceeded on the basis that it had
proved actual possession and knowledge and sought to rely on the presumption
of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA. In the alternative, it submitted that
the presumptions of possession and knowledge under s 18(1) and s 18(2) of the
MDA were engaged and that Nabill had failed to rebut the presumptions, and
that it had proved that Nabill had the drugs in his possession for the
purposes of trafficking.

45 As a preliminary point, the Prosecution is not precluded from relying on
both alternatives mentioned above. This was recognised by the Court of Appeal
in Hishamrudin bin Mohd v Public Prosecutor [2017] SGCA 41 at [20]–[21] when
it considered the case on the alternative premises of the accused’s actual and
presumed possession of drugs found in his car. This was also the case in
Zainal, where the Court recognised that the presumptions under ss 17 and 18 of
the MDA could apply, in that the Prosecution could prove the facts of
possession and knowledge and invoke the presumption of trafficking, or invoke
the presumption of possession and/or knowledge and prove that such possession
was for the purpose of trafficking (at [55]). The Court in Zainal concluded
that, based on an analysis of each of the scenarios, the corresponding
presumptions were not rebutted in that case. In other words, the Prosecution
can rely on the two alternatives, so long as the presumption under s 17 and
the presumptions under s 18(1) and (2) of the MDA are not invoked and applied
together (because they cannot be so applied), and the Prosecution makes clear
which presumptions it seeks to rely on (Zainal at [53]).

Decision on conviction

46 After assessing all the evidence, I was satisfied that on either
alternative (as set out at [44] above), the Prosecution had proved its case
against Nabill. I first explain my findings of fact before I conclude by
explaining why I found that all the elements of both charges had been proved.

47 Nabill’s case relating to the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 was as follows:

(a) In relation to possession, he did not deny that 63 packets of diamorphine
were found in the “Akira” box and one packet of diamorphine (G1A1) was found
in the “Mintek” bag on the bed. By his own evidence, he had placed the 63
packets of diamorphine in the “Akira” box. He also did not deny that he had
control and possession of the Flat and of Bedroom 1. However, he claimed that
the diamorphine did not belong to him and he did not know how it came to be
present in Bedroom 1. The first time he saw the diamorphine was around 2pm on
27 January 2016 when he found the packets laid out on the bed. He claimed that
Faizal must have brought the diamorphine to the Flat in the trolley bag and
that Sufian may have laid it out on the bed. Hence, the drugs belonged to
Faizal or Sufian, and he merely tidied up the room by placing them into the
“Akira” box.

(b) He essentially admitted that he knew that the packets contained
diamorphine because, by his own account, he had seen them laid out on the bed
at around 2pm on 27 January 2016 and was able to recognise that they contained
diamorphine.

(c) He also claimed that the diamorphine did not belong to him and by
implication he had no intention to sell it. He claimed that he was in
possession of it for the purpose of returning it to Faizal. Faizal was
supposed to have retrieved the diamorphine on 27 January 2016, but did not do
so although Nabill had called him multiple times.

48 Nabill’s case relating to the cannabis in the trolley bag was as follows:

(a) In relation to possession, he claimed that Faizal had brought the trolley
bag to the Flat while he was asleep and without his knowledge, and he only
discovered it in the storeroom at 4pm on 27 January 2016.

(b) He claimed that he did not know that the trolley bag contained cannabis
but had instead believed, based on what Faizal had told him, that it contained
cigarettes.

(c) He also claimed that the cannabis did not belong to him and by implication
he had no intention to sell it. He claimed that he was in possession of it for
the purpose of returning it to Faizal. Faizal was supposed to have retrieved
the trolley bag with its contents on 27 January 2016, but did not do so
although Nabill had called him multiple times.

49 To determine whether the disputed elements have been proved by the
Prosecution, it was necessary to assess the objective evidence and the
internal consistency and veracity of Nabill’s account of various matters such
as his knowledge of Faizal bringing the trolley bag to the Flat at the
material time, his knowledge of the contents of the trolley bag at the
material time, and his account of how the diamorphine came to be found in
Bedroom 1.

Whether Nabill knew that Faizal brought the trolley bag to the Flat

50 I begin with a preliminary point regarding the trolley bag (B1) found in
the storeroom. I found that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat on
26 January 2016. The Prosecution did not dispute that Faizal brought a trolley
bag similar in appearance to B1 to the Flat, although it could not say with
certainty that it was B1. 86

##### Foot Note 86

×

15/8/18 NE 78; 16/8/18 NE 125.

The CCTV footage of the lift leading to the Flat captured Faizal in the lift
with a similar-looking trolley bag at about 8.20pm on 26 January 2016. Around
10.20pm, the CCTV footage captured Faizal in the lift together with Nabill and
without that bag. 87

##### Foot Note 87

13/8/18 NE 56–58; PB 460–461.

Additionally, Faizal’s DNA was found on the interior surface of B1 and on the
exterior surface of the taped bundle and foil which contained one block of
cannabis (B1D). 88

##### Foot Note 88

×

PB 197–198.

I therefore found that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat around
8.20pm on 26 January 2016.

51 Nabill claimed that he was unaware that Faizal was planning to come to the
Flat on 26 January 2016 to deposit a trolley bag. He claimed that he was
asleep between 7pm and 10pm that night, so he was asleep when Faizal arrived
and only realised that Faizal was at the Flat when Mashitta woke him up around
10pm. Although he and Faizal subsequently had a chat, Nabill claimed that
Faizal did not tell him that he had brought a trolley bag to the Flat. 89

##### Foot Note 89

×

16/8/18 NE 19–21.

He discovered the trolley bag in the storeroom only around 4pm on 27 January
2016 and found out that it contained cannabis only after he was arrested. I
rejected Nabill’s testimony and found that he knew on 26 January 2016, when
Faizal came to the Flat, that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat
and had done so with Nabill’s permission and consent.

52 First, I did not believe Nabill’s claim that he was asleep from 7pm to 10pm
on 26 January 2016 such that he was unaware that Faizal had come to the Flat
at about 8.20pm with a trolley bag. He could not have been asleep as his
handphone records showed multiple calls were made to and from his handphone
during the same time period. These included calls made to and from his
handphone at 7.51pm and 8.20pm, around the time when Faizal arrived. 90

##### Foot Note 90

×

16/8/18 NE 56–58; PB 109.

A call lasting 43 seconds was even made from Nabill’s phone to Faizal’s phone
at 7.49pm, when Nabill was supposedly asleep. 91

##### Foot Note 91

×

16/8/18 NE 56; PB 108 (item 589); Exhibit H.

When confronted with these records, Nabill tried to explain that he had left
his handphone in Bedroom 1 while he was asleep, and so anyone (including
Sufian) could have used it to make or receive calls. Nabill claimed that it
was not uncommon for Sufian’s friends to call Sufian on his handphone. 92

##### Foot Note 92

×

16/8/18 NE 58–59.

I rejected Nabill’s explanation. Sufian was not called to testify to support
Nabill’s account. Moreover, Nabill conceded that Sufian had his own handphone,
hence there was no conceivable reason why Sufian would have had to use
Nabill’s handphone. In my view, Nabill’s explanation was but a feeble attempt
to shore up his claim that he was asleep when Faizal arrived at the Flat. His
claim that he was asleep when Faizal arrived was, in turn, an attempt to
distance himself from the drugs.

53 Second, in the 9th Statement recorded on 28 July 2016, Nabill stated that
he was aware that Faizal had gone to the Flat on 26 January 2016 to “put
things” and identified the “things he put” as the “trolley bag” (see [33]
above). 93

This clearly contradicted his testimony in court that he only discovered the
trolley bag the next day. When pressed during cross-examination, Nabill first
tried to explain that the “things” which he knew Faizal came to deliver was
only “ice” for his consumption. 94

16/6/18 NE 54, 60.

When confronted with the 9th Statement, Nabill admitted that he knew, on 26
January 2016 itself, that Faizal was going to the Flat with a trolley bag. 95

##### Foot Note 95

×

16/8/18 NE 61–62.

By Nabill’s own evidence, he was aware in advance that Faizal was going to the
Flat with the trolley bag and to deliver drugs. For completeness, the CCTV
footage captured Faizal, accompanied by Nabill, going down the lift at about
10.20pm without a trolley bag. Thus Nabill would have known that Faizal had
left the Flat without the trolley bag and had deposited it in the Flat.

54 Next, I found it unbelievable that Faizal would have brazenly hidden from
Nabill the fact that he had brought the trolley bag (containing drugs, and in
such large quantities) to the Flat and intended to keep it there without
Nabill’s permission or knowledge. Nabill claimed that Faizal had secretly
sought to leave all kinds of drugs (eg, heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and erimin)
in the Flat on about five prior occasions. 96

##### Foot Note 96

16/8/18 NE 50.

When Nabill discovered the drugs on each occasion, he would tell Faizal off
and ask him to immediately remove them. 97

##### Foot Note 97

×

16/8/18 NE 114–115, 122; PB 469.

Nabill added that he had developed a habit of checking the Flat every time
after Faizal left to ensure that he did not leave unwanted drugs behind. Going
by Nabill’s account, it was difficult to believe that Faizal would
disrespectfully continue to deposit drugs in the Flat without Nabill’s consent
and knowledge, running the risk of outraging Nabill and affecting their
friendship. On Nabill’s account, it was also unbelievable that he would
continue to allow Faizal to come to the Flat regularly when he knew full well
that there was a substantial risk that Faizal would again hide drugs in the
Flat and put him at risk of being caught with those drugs which he knew could
attract imprisonment or the death penalty. I disbelieved Nabill’s explanation
that he continued to allow Faizal to come to the Flat because he needed Faizal
to supply drugs to him for consumption. As Nabill admitted, he could easily
have met Faizal somewhere outside the Flat to obtain the drugs from Faizal. 98

##### Foot Note 98

×

16/8/18 NE 52–53, 115–116.

Therefore, Nabill’s account was not internally coherent and suggested,
instead, that he was expecting Faizal to come to the Flat with the trolley bag
containing the drugs and had knowingly allowed him to deposit the trolley bag
with the drugs in the Flat.

55 Indeed, if Nabill were truly so mistrusting of Faizal that he would check
the Flat for drugs whenever Faizal left, and given that he was aware of the
severe legal consequences of being found with a large quantity of illicit
drugs, then one would expect him to have done a thorough check of the Flat on
26 January 2016 (or the next day) after Faizal left. Instead, Nabill claimed
he had checked only Bedroom 1 and was satisfied upon this cursory check that
there were no drugs in the whole Flat (apart from the methamphetamine in the
master bedroom toilet which was for his consumption) and only discovered the
huge quantities of diamorphine when it was laid out on the bed the next day
and the cannabis when he was arrested. 99

##### Foot Note 99

×

16/8/18 NE 22–23, 62–63.

Nabill’s complacency suggested that he was not worried about Faizal bringing
drugs to the Flat and was aware that he would do so.

Whether Nabill knew the contents of the trolley bag

56 I was also satisfied that Nabill knew that the trolley bag contained drugs,
and that he knew the nature of the drugs in the trolley bag, at the material
time when Faizal brought the trolley bag to the Flat. Nabill’s evidence was
that all the drugs found in Bedroom 1 and the storeroom had been brought by
Faizal on 26 January 2016, because they were not present in the Flat before
that time. If so, then if it were found that Nabill knew what the trolley bag
contained when Faizal brought it to the Flat, this knowledge would extend not
only to the cannabis found in the trolley bag but also to all the other drugs
which had somehow found their way from the trolley bag into Bedroom 1 by the
time of Nabill’s arrest.

57 First, there was evidence of Nabill’s familiarity with drugs (and the type
of drugs found at his Flat), and his past experience with Faizal bringing
drugs, including diamorphine and cannabis, to the Flat. In the 1st Statement
recorded after his arrest, Nabill was able to identify the various types of
drugs that were seized from the Flat. He also testified that he consumed drugs
regularly with others. He claimed that Faizal came to the Flat a few times a
week to smoke “ice” and that he obtained his “ice” from Faizal, who in turn
obtained it from Danish. As mentioned at [54] above, Nabill also claimed that
on about five prior occasions, Faizal had brought various kinds of drugs
(including diamorphine and cannabis) to the Flat without his permission or
knowledge, and would retrieve them only upon Nabill’s prompting, which was why
he would check the Flat each time after Faizal left to make sure that he had
not left behind any drugs.

58 Second, even by Nabill’s account, his reaction upon discovering the trolley
bag in the storeroom strongly suggested that he in fact knew that the trolley
bag contained drugs and not cigarettes. I should state first that I rejected
Nabill’s evidence that he only discovered the trolley bag on 27 January 2016.
As I found at [53] above, Nabill was aware that Faizal had gone to the Flat on
26 January 2016 to deposit a trolley bag and to deliver drugs. 100

##### Foot Note 100

×

PB 470; 16/8/18 NE 61–62.

Nonetheless, I proceeded to assess the internal coherence of Nabill’s own
account of the facts, on the basis that he discovered the trolley bag on 27
January 2016 as he claimed, in order to determine whether he was to be
believed.

59 In this regard, Nabill claimed that when he discovered the trolley bag in
the storeroom around 4pm on 27 January 2016, he immediately or “straightaway”
phoned Faizal to remove it, because he knew or at least suspected that it
contained drugs. 101

##### Foot Note 101

×

16/8/18 NE 72–73.

His knowledge or suspicion was entirely to be expected given Faizal’s
purported history of bringing unwanted large quantities of various drugs to
the Flat. However, what was incongruent with Nabill’s innocence was his
reaction to Faizal’s reply that the trolley bag only contained cigarettes.
Nabill stated that he did not open the trolley bag to verify its contents and
that he trusted Faizal because of the “size of the trolley”. 102

##### Foot Note 102

×

16/8/18 NE 116.

It was not obvious how the size of the trolley bag would have given Nabill any
assurance. Faizal had never brought large quantities of cigarettes to the Flat
before, 103

##### Foot Note 103

×

16/8/18 NE 117.

whereas the many varieties of drugs that Faizal had previously brought to the
Flat could have easily been contained within a trolley bag. Indeed, in the 9th
Statement, Nabill said that it was “difficult to say” what quantity of drugs
Faizal left at the Flat on various occasions because the quantities differed
and were concealed in various bags, such as a “sling bag”, “bag”, “paper bag”
or “plastic bag”. 104

##### Foot Note 104

×

PB 469.

Nabill explained, however, that he could tell that Faizal had on occasion
brought small quantities because the drugs were contained in “just a small
plastic bag or small sling bag”. 105

##### Foot Note 105

×

16/8/18 NE 53.

If anything, the size of the trolley bag should have given Nabill cause for
worry.

60 Furthermore, Nabill’s conduct and his purported trust in Faizal on 27
January 2016 (in taking Faizal at his word that the trolley bag contained
cigarettes) was inconsistent with his apparent lack of trust in Faizal on
previous occasions, as seen in the way that he had allegedly searched the Flat
after each visit by Faizal to ensure Faizal had not left unwanted drugs in the
Flat. It was also inconsistent with his apparent lack of trust in Faizal the
night before he was arrested (ie, 26 January 2016) as he claimed he did a
check of Bedroom 1 after Faizal left the Flat that night. His complacency on
this occasion is particularly stark given that Nabill stated that he actually
suspected, when he called Faizal, that the trolley bag might have contained
drugs, and was aware of the serious penalties attached to drug offences.
Additionally, according to his version of events, when he called Faizal about
the trolley bag around 4pm on 27 January 2016, he had already discovered the
large quantities of drugs (which he knew at that time to be diamorphine) in
Bedroom 1, and suspected that either Sufian or Faizal was responsible for its
presence in the Flat. In this context, it is inexplicable that Nabill did not
act to verify that the trolley bag contained cigarettes as Faizal claimed, as
one would expect him to have been worried about the presence of more drugs.

61 It was also strange that Nabill was in no hurry to get Faizal to remove the
trolley bag from the Flat. He only called Faizal once, and did not try to
reach him again even though he did not turn up for some four hours between the
phone call and the time of Nabill’s arrest. 106

##### Foot Note 106

×

16/8/18 NE 76–77.

Moreover, after Nabill was arrested, he made phone calls (in the presence of
CNB officers) to Danish rather than Faizal to ask Danish to collect the items,
even though by this time he knew that the trolley bag belonged to Faizal. 107

##### Foot Note 107

×

16/8/18 NE 10–11.

62 Hence, I found that Nabill’s evidence and conduct as mentioned above were
all inconsistent with his claim to innocence. They suggested instead that he
already knew that the trolley bag contained drugs when Faizal brought it to
the Flat on 26 January 2016 and moreover, that he knew what the drugs were.

63 These findings were supported by Nabill’s conduct immediately after his
arrest. SSgt Ika testified that after Bedroom 1 had been searched and the
diamorphine discovered, he asked Nabill, “ada lagi?” (meaning “still some
more?” or “anymore?”) to which Nabill replied, “storeroom”. I did not believe
Nabill’s alternative account that SSgt Ika had asked, “ada barang salah lagi?”
(meaning “any more illegal things?”), and that Nabill had directed the CNB
officers to the storeroom because of the contraband cigarettes rather than the
trolley bag containing the drugs. First, Nabill’s version of SSgt Ika’s
question kept evolving. He offered three versions in all: “ada barang salah?”
(meaning “any illegal things?”); “ada barang salah lagi?” (meaning “any more
illegal things”); and “ada barang lagi?” (meaning “any more things?”). 108

##### Foot Note 108

×

15/8/18 NE 32, 52; 16/8/18 NE 7, 82.

In contrast, SSgt Ika was consistent in his testimony that he had merely asked
“ada lagi?” and that Nabill had replied “storeroom”. Second, the context
supports the inference that Nabill understood SSgt Ika to be asking whether
there were any more drugs and had directed the CNB officers to the storeroom
because he was aware that there were drugs in the trolley bag. SSgt Ika had
asked Nabill this question after Bedroom 1 had been searched and a large
amount of drugs had been uncovered. In this context, Nabill would have been
aware that SSgt Ika was asking whether there were any more drugs in the Flat.
Furthermore, Nabill was aware that the officers were from the CNB and that
they were not conducting a raid for contraband cigarettes. 109

##### Foot Note 109

×

16/8/18 NE 82.

This supported my finding that Nabill was aware that there were drugs in the
storeroom and that they were in the trolley bag.

Whether Nabill had possession and knowledge of the diamorphine found in
Bedroom 1

64 I turn now to the diamorphine found in Bedroom 1 (the subject of the 1st
Charge) namely, 63 packets (contained in F1A, F1B, F1C, F1D and F1E) that were
found in an “Akira” box and one packet (G1A1) that was found in a “Mintek” bag
on the bed. I was satisfied that Nabill was in possession of the diamorphine
and knew of its nature at the material time. I rejected his claim that he only
discovered the diamorphine (among other drugs which do not form the subject of
the charges) in Bedroom 1 around 2pm on 27 January 2016 and stowed them away
in the “Akira” box to return them to Faizal or Sufian. I found Nabill to be a
dishonest witness who contradicted himself on material particulars and
concocted facts as he went along, in an attempt to disassociate himself from
possession and knowledge of the diamorphine at the material time.

Nabill’s evolving account of the diamorphine

65 Nabill’s account of the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 was continually evolving
and therefore not credible. I set out the more material changes in his version
of events throughout the investigation process and until the trial.

66 First, Nabill altered his account of whether and when he saw the
diamorphine exhibits prior to his arrest. In the 1st Statement, he stated that
he had never touched or seen the diamorphine exhibits before his arrest. 110

##### Foot Note 110

×

PB 297–298.

However, in the 10th Statement, he said that he saw the drugs in Bedroom 1 for
the first time on the bed at about 2pm on 27 January 2016, that Mashitta
quarrelled with him and threw the packets of drugs at him, and that he then
“put them at one side”. 111

##### Foot Note 111

×

PB 474

During the trial, Nabill testified that he picked up the drugs Mashitta had
thrown at him and chucked them into the “Akira” box. 112

##### Foot Note 112

×

16/08/2018 NE 34.

67 Second, Nabill altered his account of when the “Akira” box and the trolley
bag appeared in the Flat. In the 4th Statement, he stated that he was certain
that Danish had brought the drugs to the Flat around 3am on 27 January 2016
because when Nabill was fixing the wardrobe and the storage rack (in Bedroom 1
and the storeroom respectively) on 26 January 2016, the “Akira” box and
trolley bag were not there (in Bedroom 1 and the storeroom respectively) at
that time. When this statement was recorded, Nabill had yet to put forward the
version of events in which he discovered the drugs on the bed and chucked them
into the “Akira” box after quarrelling with Mashitta. During the trial, after
his account of his quarrel with Mashitta had emerged, Nabill stated that the
“Akira” box had always been in Bedroom 1. 113

##### Foot Note 113

×

16/8/18 NE 35.

68 Third, Nabill completely altered his account of who the diamorphine
belonged to. In the 1st Statement, he stated that it belonged to Danish who
had brought it to the Flat and in particular for G1A1, that Danish had
intended to sell it. In the 2nd to 6th Statements, Nabill supplied details
that would make this story about Danish more realistic – details such as how
he came to know Danish, Danish’s regular stays at the Flat, Danish’s supply of
“ice” to him, Danish’s history of leaving extra “ice” behind to “frame” Nabill
into selling the excess “ice” for him, and how Nabill had heard Danish
entering the Flat in the early hours of 27 January 2016. However, in the 7th
Statement, Nabill claimed for the first time that Faizal had brought the
cannabis to the Flat. From that point on, Nabill did an about turn and claimed
that it was Faizal who had brought all the drugs to the Flat in the trolley
bag on 26 January 2016. Nabill then denied that he knew Danish and that Danish
had ever come to the Flat. By the time the 7th Statement was recorded, Nabill
must have realised that there was CCTV footage of the lift leading to the
Flat, which was why, in that statement, he stated for the first time that
Faizal was the person who had brought the trolley bag and drugs to the Flat,
and requested for the CCTV footage to be examined. In fact, during the trial,
Nabill admitted that he changed his account from “Danish” to “Faizal” after
ASP Peh showed him the CCTV footage of the lift leading to the Flat. 114

##### Foot Note 114

×

16/8/18 NE 100; PB 452–453.

The CCTV footage captured Faizal in the lift with the trolley bag going up the
lift and did not capture any images of Danish. I found that Nabill changed his
account to attribute the drugs to Faizal only when he realised that his
account about Danish could not stand in the face of the objective records.

69 Lastly, Nabill altered his account of how the diamorphine came to be found
in Bedroom 1. In the 4th Statement, he explained that Danish must have brought
them to the Flat at about 3am on 27 January 2016, because these items were not
there when Nabill was fixing the wardrobe in Bedroom 1 on 26 January 2016. In
the 8th to 10th Statements, Nabill merely said that all the drugs in Bedroom 1
and the storeroom must have been brought to the Flat in Faizal’s trolley bag.
In the 10th Statement, he claimed that he first saw the diamorphine laid out
on the bed in the afternoon on 27 January 2016 when he quarrelled with
Mashitta, but did not explain how they came to be laid out on the bed. When
questioned whether Sufian was connected to the drugs that Faizal brought to
the Flat, Nabill stated that he did not know, and added that he did not know
“if Sufian saw Faizal taking the drugs out of the trolley bag”. 115

##### Foot Note 115

×

PB 453.

However, during the trial, Nabill claimed that the diamorphine would have been
laid out on the bed by Sufian, and not Faizal, as Nabill did not see anything
on the bed when he checked Bedroom 1 after Faizal left the Flat on 26 January
2016 and Sufian was at home on 27 January 2016. 116

##### Foot Note 116

×

16/8/18 NE 68.

70 As can be seen, Nabill’s story was evolving throughout the proceedings.
This was incredibly damaging to his credibility and led me to question why he
felt compelled to concoct a story about Danish in the first place instead of
offering at the earliest opportunity the defence which he ultimately offered
at trial – namely that the diamorphine belonged to either Faizal or to Sufian
(who allegedly placed it in Bedroom 1, having possibly obtained it from the
trolley bag). I will return to the issue of Nabill’s evolving defence in light
of his statements later (see [77]–[82] below).

Nabill’s account that Sufian had placed the drugs on the bed in Bedroom 1

71 Next, I rejected Nabill’s explanation that Sufian had placed the
diamorphine on the bed in Bedroom 1. The way that Nabill conducted himself
upon discovering the drugs was not as one would expect if he had innocently
found such a large quantity of diamorphine in his Flat. He claimed that he
called Sufian to come back to the Flat and clear “all the thing inside
[Bedroom 1]”. 117

##### Foot Note 117

×

16/8/18 NE 76–77.

Strangely, however, he did not ask Sufian why there were drugs (and so much of
them) in the room and who had brought them to the Flat. He agreed that he did
not even mention the word “drugs” to Sufian. Nabill tried to explain that he
did not ask Sufian about the drugs because Sufian “sounded so innocent at that
point in time”. 118

##### Foot Note 118

×

16/8/18 NE 76.

I found this unconvincing especially given that Sufian was a known drug user.
119

##### Foot Note 119

×

PB 471.

Further, Nabill did not produce any independent evidence to support his
account that Sufian had laid the diamorphine out on the bed before Nabill
chucked it in the “Akira” box for Sufian to clear it. He did not call Mashitta
to support his account that he first found the diamorphine on the bed in
Bedroom 1 at about 2pm on 27 January 2016 and then packed the drugs into the
“Akira” box after quarrelling with her, or call Sufian to support his phone
conversation with Sufian after he discovered the diamorphine.

Other evidence

72 There was also objective evidence that Nabill had been in contact with some
packets of diamorphine, which supported a finding that he was in possession of
it and knew the nature of its contents as he was involved in packing it.

73 Nabill’s DNA was found on F1D3A, which comprised 10 mini packets of
diamorphine which were packed into a larger ziplock bag (F1D3), which was in
turn found in a white plastic bag (F1D) retrieved from the “Akira” box. 120

##### Foot Note 120

×

PB 203.

It must be emphasised that there were multiple layers of external packaging,
which made it very unlikely that Nabill’s DNA could have been found on F1D3A
by accidental touching. His DNA was also found on F1E3 (a ziplock bag which
contained 10 mini packets of diamorphine (F1E3A)), which was found in a white
plastic bag (F1E) retrieved from the “Akira” box. There was objective evidence
that the plastic bag used for F1D3A could have come from the same stock as J1A
or J2A because the bags were manufactured by the same machine (see [19]
above), and Nabill agreed that F1D3A came from the same stock as J2A. 121

##### Foot Note 121

×

16/8/18 NE 68.

74 When asked how his DNA might have ended up on F1D3A and F1E3, Nabill
explained that when he was quarrelling with Mashitta, the diamorphine was laid
out on the bed in the form of larger ziplock bags (eg, F1D1, F1D2, F1D3, F1E1,
F1E2 and F1E3) of 10 mini packets each. 122

##### Foot Note 122

×

16/8/18 NE 64.

After the quarrel, he picked up these larger ziplock bags and placed them into
the “Akira” box. He stated that did not come into contact with the mini
packets of diamorphine found within the larger ziplock bags, including F1D3A.
He suggested that his DNA was found on F1D3A as he used similar bags to pack
his “ice”, and speculated that Faizal or Sufian could have obtained plastic
bags from the same stock (ie, the empty plastic bags in J1A or J2A) to pack
the diamorphine. 123

##### Foot Note 123

×

16/8/18 NE 38–40, 64, 79.

75 I rejected Nabill’s claim that he only came into contact with the packets
of diamorphine when he was packing them away after the quarrel with Mashitta.
Even if it explained how he came into contact with the exterior surface of the
larger packets (eg,  F1E3, on which his DNA was found (see [15(a)] above)) it
does not explain why his DNA was found on F1D3A, which was one of the mini
packets enclosed within one such larger packet, F1D3. I also rejected his
assertion that Faizal or Sufian could have used plastic bags from J1A or J2A
to pack the drugs, and that since “some of” J1A or J2A belonged to Nabill, his
DNA could have been found on the empty bag they used to pack F1D3A. 124

##### Foot Note 124

×

16/8/18 NE 38–40.

This was pure speculation. There was also no explanation why, on Nabill’s
speculation, his DNA was transferred onto an empty bag in the stock of empty
plastic bags contained in J1A or J2A (which were all neatly bundled and
clearly new and unused) before Faizal or Sufian supposedly used that same bag
to pack the diamorphine. The better explanation is that Nabill’s DNA was found
on F1D3A because he was involved in packing it.

76 I was also satisfied that Nabill had been in contact with the packet of
diamorphine, G1A1, which was in a plastic bag (G1A) inside a “Mintek” bag (G1)
which was in turn found on the bed. Nabill’s DNA was found on the exterior and
interior surfaces of the plastic bag (G1A). 125

##### Foot Note 125

×

PB 185.

Since G1A was found inside G1 which was on the bed at the time of Nabill’s
arrest, Nabill would not have come into contact with the surface of G1A when
supposedly quarrelling with Mashitta or when putting the other packets of
diamorphine into the “Akira” box after the argument. Nabill had no explanation
of how G1A1 came to be in Bedroom 1. In the 1st Statement recorded at the time
of his arrest, he recognised G1A1 as heroin and said it belonged to Danish who
would sell it. However, since he later recanted all his accounts relating to
Danish, this explanation (that G1A1 belonged to Danish who would sell it) no
longer holds water. During the trial, he testified that he could not recall if
he had seen G1A. 126

##### Foot Note 126

×

16/8/18 NE 64–65.

In my view, the DNA evidence is persuasive that Nabill had handled G1A which
contained G1A1. While nothing turns on this, I also note that Nabill’s DNA was
found on the exterior, handle, front compartment and main compartment of the
“Mintek” bag.

Nabill’s statements to CNB

77 I turn now to Nabill’s investigation statements. As noted at [65]–[70]
above, Nabill’s account was continually evolving, as should be apparent from
my summary of his statements at [25]–[34] above. In my view, this was
detrimental to Nabill’s credibility. The question is whether he had any good
explanation for the changes in his account. Nabill explained that he had
initially implicated Danish in the first six statements because he was
suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms and was therefore confused, fearful
and not in the right state of mind. 127

##### Foot Note 127

×

16/8/18 NE 16.

He claimed that the drug withdrawal symptoms lasted for about one week –
presumably one week from the time of his arrest, in which period all the first
six statements were recorded.

78 In my judgment, Nabill failed to show that his state of mind was affected
by drug withdrawal symptoms at the time when he made the statements. On the
contrary, I found that Nabill had made each statement being aware of what he
was saying at the material time and had told deliberate untruths in the course
of investigation. He did not give consistent evidence at the trial about his
state of mind at the time of giving the statements. Overall, I found Nabill to
be an untruthful witness.

79 First, Nabill’s stated reasons for having falsely implicated one Danish
(which allegations he subsequently recanted in his later investigation
statements and at the trial) vacillated during the course of the trial. In my
view, none of his stated reasons – apart from his final admission that he had
deliberately fabricated the account about Danish – were convincing.

(a) Initially, he explained that he was suffering from drug withdrawal
symptoms and was therefore confused, fearful and not in the right frame of
mind when he gave the statements implicating Danish.

(b) Shortly after, he stated that he believed in the truth of the statements
when he made them, ie, he sincerely believed at the time when he made the
statements that it was Danish who had brought the drugs to the Flat. 128

##### Foot Note 128

×

16/8/18 NE 17–18.

Thus, he claimed that he had not deliberately made false statements. He stated
that from the 7th Statement dated 23 May 2016 onwards, he came to believe that
it was Faizal who had brought the drugs to the Flat, because Mashitta (who had
in turn been informed by the domestic helper) had told him that Faizal brought
the trolley bag. I found this explanation entirely unconvincing. According to
Nabill at trial, he had already discovered prior to his arrest at around 4pm
on 27 January 2016 that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat and
that it was in the storeroom. Thus, there was no reason why he would have
implicated Danish in the first six statements which were all recorded after
his arrest, and why he would change his position and implicate Faizal only
from the 7th Statement when he was supposedly prompted to change his original
account because of what Mashitta had allegedly told him. Nabill’s final
account did not admit room for him to have sincerely believed, at the time he
made the statements implicating Danish, that Danish had brought the trolley
bag and drugs to the Flat.

(c) In cross-examination, Nabill stated that he had given all his statements
voluntarily and that he knew what he was saying when he made those statements,
which included the statements implicating Danish. 129

##### Foot Note 129

×

16/8/18 NE 46.

He was then pressed about why he had to implicate an innocent person even if

He replied that he had deliberately implicated Danish because he knew from
Faizal that Danish was the supplier of the drugs that were found in Bedroom 1
and the trolley bag. 131

16/8/18 NE 87.

At the same time, he agreed that he was not confused or in fear, and was not
ignorant of what he was saying when he made the statements implicating Danish.
Nabill then adjusted his explanation – he stated that after the CNB allowed
him to call Danish, he found out from Danish that the drugs belonged to Danish
and Danish also told him that he had passed the drugs to Faizal. That was why
he deliberately implicated Danish in the 1st Statement. 132

##### Foot Note 132

16/8/18 NE 88.

I did not accept this explanation. It was undisputed that the phone call was
made to Danish only after Nabill had given the 1st Statement. 133

16/8/18 NE 88–89; PB 110 (at S/N 657).

His claim that he learnt that Danish was Faizal’s supplier during this call
was thus a patent lie.

(d) Later during cross-examination, Nabill attempted to revert to his earlier
claim that he had “mistakenly mentioned” Danish’s name because he was
suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms and was not in the right frame of
mind. 134

##### Foot Note 134

16/8/18 NE 92–94.

However, when questioned about specific parts of his statements, such as the
details he furnished about how he met Danish, he admitted that he had
deliberately made up stories regarding Danish. 135

##### Foot Note 135

16/8/18 NE 87, 92–95, 98–99.

When he was further questioned about specific parts of his statements, Nabill
changed his stance again and said that he had deliberately told untruths in
some parts of the statements and he was “talking nonsense” in other parts of
the statements. 136

##### Foot Note 136

16/8/18 NE 106–111.

But he then admitted that the details he furnished about Danish had been
deliberately concocted. 137

##### Foot Note 137

×

16/8/18 NE 113.

80 It was clear, in my view, that Nabill had knowingly and deliberately
concocted a story about Danish having brought the drugs to the Flat, and that
he had no good explanation for having done so. Nabill admitted that the
statements made shortly after his arrest were made voluntarily and he knew
what he was saying in those statements. 138

##### Foot Note 138

×

16/8/18 NE 46.

This included the 4th Statement (whereby he gave a lengthy account of his
relationship with Danish) in which he stated he had deliberately concocted a
story pertaining to Danish based on what Faizal had told him. Indeed, Nabill
must have been aware of what he was alleging because, in line with his
allegation in the 1st Statement that the drugs belonged to Danish, he made
phone calls (apparently) to Danish after his arrest in the presence of CNB
officers. 139

##### Foot Note 139

×

16/8/18 NE 10–11, 88–89.

Furthermore, the account of Danish which he later recanted was not bereft of
details but was fairly lengthy. Clearly, despite any drug withdrawal symptoms,
Nabill had applied his mind to developing an elaborate account about Danish,
yet all these details were by his own admission untrue because he had never
met Danish. 140

##### Foot Note 140

×

PB 467–471.

The inescapable conclusion was that Nabill had deliberately told lies to the
CNB.

81 Second, even if Nabill was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms when the
1st to 6th Statements were recorded, it was evident that these symptoms were
not the reason why he had put forward his initial story about the drugs
belonging to Danish. This was evident from the fact that Nabill tried to
maintain this story about Danish even after any purported drug withdrawal
symptoms would have worn off. Dr Chua testified that any such symptoms would
last between two to seven days, and Nabill also agreed that any such symptoms
that he suffered wore off after about seven days from his arrest. 141

##### Foot Note 141

15/8/18 NE 15; 16/8/18 NE 16, 102.

(a) Dr Kelvin Ng examined Nabill on 22 and 23 February and 4 March 2016 (see
[23] above). 142

##### Foot Note 142

PB 279–283.

Dr Ng stated that Nabill was able to give a consistent account of what had
occurred. At that time, Nabill continued to refer to “Dhanesh” which, he
confirmed at the trial, was a reference to Danish. 143

##### Foot Note 143

×

16/8/18 NE 117.

He told Dr Ng about his relationship with Dhanesh and how Dhanesh had left the
drugs in the Flat on the night of 26 January 2016. By the time Dr Ng examined
Nabill, any drug withdrawal symptoms would have worn off. When he was asked
why he nonetheless told Dr Ng that Danish was responsible for the drugs in the
Flat, Nabill could only say that he could not recall what he said to Dr Ng.
144

##### Foot Note 144

×

16/8/18 NE 117–118.

(b) In the 8th Statement recorded on 24 May 2016, Nabill was asked in what
packaging Danish supplied “ice” to him, and he gave an intelligible
description, implicitly continuing to maintain that Danish, rather than
Faizal, was his “ice” supplier. It was only after he was shown the CCTV
footage of Faizal in the lift leading up to the Flat on 26 January 2016, and
realising that the CCTV footage did not capture any images of Danish, that
Nabill then changed his evidence in the very same statement to say that Danish
had never been to his Flat. As I found at [68] earlier, Nabill changed his
account to “Faizal” only when he realised that his account about Danish could
not stand in the face of the objective CCTV evidence. Indeed, Nabill admitted
that he began to attribute the drugs to Faizal in the end because he had
viewed the CCTV footage, in that he had a “better view on the CCTV” footage.
145

##### Foot Note 145

×

16/8/18 NE 100, 102; PB 452–453.

I found this explanation, that the CCTV footage helped him to clarify what
happened, to be utterly illogical and untrue. Details such as whether Nabill
had ever met Danish, whether Danish had ever been to the Flat, whether Danish
had “framed” him with drugs and so on, were matters within Nabill’s own
experience and knowledge, and he would not have needed the CCTV footage to
realise that his account about Danish was false. Moreover, if he knew – as he
later testified – before his arrest that Faizal had brought a trolley bag to
the Flat, he did not need the CCTV footage to supply him with that knowledge.

82 Therefore, I found Nabill to be an untruthful and unreliable witness, who
kept changing his story along the way. He clearly knew, at the time he made
each statement, what he meant to say, and he had made up stories about Danish
in his initial statements to hide the fact that he knew that Faizal had come
to the Flat on 26 January 2016 with a trolley bag of drugs. I find he did so
to disassociate himself from the drugs that were subsequently seized from the
Flat.

Submissions by the Defence

83 Before I conclude, I deal with various arguments raised by the Defence
which have not been dealt with above.

84 First, the Defence submitted that the CNB failed to investigate other
persons who may have been involved in the drug transactions, such as Mashitta,
Sufian, Khairul and Faizal. 146

##### Foot Note 146

×

Defence Closing Submissions, para 38–39.

It was unclear how this affected the Prosecution’s case against Nabill. The
Defence did not dispute that multiple persons could be charged for the same
offence in relation to the same transaction or the same set of drugs. 147

##### Foot Note 147

×

16/8/18 NE 126.

It did not dispute that Faizal had in fact been investigated, although charges
against him were still pending. 148

##### Foot Note 148

×

16/8/18 NE 124.

Ultimately, the prerogative to charge any person lies with the Public
Prosecutor. In so far as the Defence is alleging that the drugs could have
“belonged” to and been intended for trafficking by any one of these other
individuals, 149

##### Foot Note 149

×

Defence Closing Submissions, para 40.

my analysis will takes account whether Nabill possessed the drugs for the
purpose of returning them to any of these other individuals, or for the
purpose of trafficking. I also add that there is no requirement to prove
ownership of the drugs for an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the
MDA to be made out.

85 Next, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution had refused to produce a
statement taken from the domestic helper to show that she had allowed Faizal
entry into the Flat on 26 January 2016 and that Faizal had brought the trolley
bag. 150

##### Foot Note 150

×

Defence Closing Submissions, para 46.

Again this was immaterial and did not affect my findings. I had found that
Faizal was the one who brought the trolley bag to the Flat, so the domestic
helper’s evidence in this regard would add nothing more. Even if she had
allowed Faizal into the Flat on 26 January 2016, this did not mean that Nabill
was unaware that Faizal had brought a trolley bag containing drugs that night.
I have explained my reasons for finding that Nabill knew that Faizal was
bringing a trolley bag to the Flat and that the trolley bag contained drugs,
and the evidence of the domestic helper would not impact any of those reasons.
In fact, the Defence chose not to call witnesses who could have supported
Nabill’s version of events, namely Mashitta, Faizal and Sufian (whom Nabill
claimed had laid out the drugs in Bedroom 1 and whom Nabill called
subsequently to ask him to clear the things).

86 Next, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution should have disclosed
statements recorded from Mashitta, Faizal and Sufian because these statements
could have been advantageous to the defence. I rejected this submission. Under
s 259 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), any statement made
by a person (other than the accused) in the course of any investigation is
inadmissible in evidence unless it falls within an exception listed in s
259(a) to (e). The Defence did not identify which exception applied, and why
it would apply, such that these statements if disclosed could be admitted at
the trial. The Prosecution’s disclosure obligations as set out in Muhammad bin
Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“Kadar No 1”) are not
affected by the operation of any ground for non-disclosure recognised by any
law (see Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter
[2011] 4 SLR 791 at [18]). In any event, the Defence also did not attempt to
show how these statements, even if inadmissible under s 259, could have fallen
within the Prosecution’s obligations to disclose “any unused material that is
likely to be inadmissible, but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of
pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be
admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to
the guilt or innocence of the accused” (Kadar No 1 at [113]). If the Defence
could have benefitted from the evidence of Mashitta, Sufian or Faizal, it
could also have called them as witnesses but chose not to.

87 Finally, the Defence suggested that Sufian could have been connected to the
drugs found in the Flat because the CCTV footage showed him carrying a red
packet that was similar in appearance to G1B and G1C when he was in the lift
heading down from the floor where the Flat was at around 6.33am on 26 January
2016. He was no longer carrying this packet when he was seen again in the
lift, going up to the floor where the Flat was at around 6.57am. 151

##### Foot Note 151

×

15/8/18 NE 105–106.

The Defence claimed that Sufian could have been carrying out transactions
involving the red packets. 152

##### Foot Note 152

×

Defence Closing Submissions, para 41.

The drugs in G1B and G1C did not form the subject of the charges against
Nabill (even if Sufian were in some way connected to those drugs), and the
drugs which Nabill was charged with trafficking were packaged in a different
manner. In any event, Sufian’s role, if any, would not affect my findings as
regards Nabill because Nabill’s involvement in the drugs found in Flat was not
precluded by Sufian’s (even if proved).

Conclusion

88 In conclusion, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case
beyond a reasonable doubt that Nabill had actual possession of the drugs (ie,
the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 and the cannabis in the trolley bag) and knew the
nature of these drugs. I was further satisfied that the Prosecution was able
to rely on the presumption in s 17 of the MDA that Nabill was in possession of
the drugs for the purposes of trafficking since the quantities of both types
of drugs exceeded the amounts specified in s 17, and found that Nabill failed
to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. I summarise below
my findings.

89 First, as regards the element of possession, since Nabill had physical
control of the Flat, the “Akira” box, the “Mintek” bag and the trolley bag,
the latter three of which contained the drugs in question, I was entitled to
infer that Nabill had knowledge of the existence of the drugs in each of these
receptacles (Zainal at [16]). It was incumbent on him to show why, despite his
physical control of them, he “reasonably ought not to be taken to be in
possession of [their] contents” (see Zainal at [17]).

(a) In relation to the diamorphine, I found that Nabill was in possession of
the diamorphine (G1A1) found in the “Mintek” bag because it was found in his
control and his DNA was found on exhibit G1A. As for the 63 packets of
diamorphine in the “Akira” box, Nabill by his own account knew that they were
in the “Akira” box because, according to him, he had placed them there after
the alleged quarrel with Mashitta. The fact that I have rejected his account
means that Nabill by his own admission knew, prior to his arrest, that there
was diamorphine in the “Akira” box, but had furnished no credible reason why
it was there. I rejected his explanation that Sufian or Faizal was responsible
for placing the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 because his account was discredited
on many fronts. Even if Faizal had placed the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 on the
night of 26 January 2016, I found that Nabill would have known of this and
would have had agreed to it. This is because I have found that Nabill knew
that Faizal was bringing a trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016 and knew
what it contained. Either way, Nabill had no credible explanation for why he
ought not to be taken to be in possession of them. I was thus satisfied he had
actual possession of them.

(b) As for the cannabis, even by Nabill’s account, he was aware of the
presence of the trolley bag and that it contained something which turned out
to be the cannabis. He claimed to have discovered the trolley bag at about 4pm
on 27 January 2016, and immediately called Faizal about it. In any event, I
rejected Nabill’s account that he did not know that Faizal had brought the
trolley bag containing drugs to the Flat, and I found that Nabill knew that
Faizal was bringing something to the Flat in the trolley bag and that he had
agreed to it. He therefore had physical control of the cannabis in the trolley
bag and the requisite knowledge that the trolley bag contained something which
was later discovered to be the cannabis.

90 Second, as regards the element of knowledge, I found that Nabill knew the
nature of the drugs in the Flat, specifically that the drugs in Bedroom 1
which formed the subject of the 1st Charge were diamorphine and that the drugs
found in the trolley bag which formed the subject of the 2nd Charge were
cannabis.

(a) In relation to the diamorphine, Nabill on his own account had seen the
diamorphine contained in F1A, F1B, F1C, F1D and F1E laid out on the bed before
his arrest and recognised them as diamorphine. In relation to G1A1, I found
that Nabill had been in contact with that packet and would have known it to
contain diamorphine (as evident in the 1st Statement where he was able to
identify the content of G1A1). Actual knowledge was therefore proved.

(b) As for the cannabis, I rejected Nabill’s evidence that he thought the
trolley bag contained cigarettes and his account of how the trolley bag was
brought to the Flat without his knowledge or consent. I found that he knew
that Faizal was bringing drugs in the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January
2016. Even by his own account, Nabill knew by around 4pm on 27 January 2016 of
the trolley bag in the storeroom and knew or suspected at that time that it
contained drugs. The evidence as a whole, including my findings that Nabill
was expecting and involved in the delivery of the drugs by Faizal and told
deliberate lies to the CNB and to this court to conceal his involvement with
the drugs in the trolley bag, lead to a strong inference that Nabill knew the
precise nature of the drugs that Faizal was bringing to the Flat in the
trolley bag.

91 Third, on the element that the possession of the drugs was for the purpose
of trafficking, I found that Nabill failed to rebut the presumption of
trafficking in s 17 such that he possessed the drugs for some other purpose.
Nabill’s case was that the drugs were in his possession for Faizal or Sufian
to retrieve them, and that he was wholly uninvolved in the procurement or
intended trafficking of these drugs. His evidence as to the intended purpose
of the drugs was therefore inextricably linked to his wider story about how
the drugs came to be found in the Flat without his knowledge or consent. For
the reasons above, I rejected his evidence about how the drugs came to be
found in the Flat, and accordingly rejected his evidence that he had no
purpose for the drugs apart from storing them for Faizal or Sufian’s
retrieval. Nabill also did not put forward a defence that the drugs were
intended for his personal consumption. Furthermore, a large quantity of
diamorphine and cannabis was in his possession – more than four times the
amount of diamorphine at which capital punishment would be imposed, and more
than twice the amount of cannabis at which capital punishment would be
imposed.

92 On the Prosecution’s alternative case, I was also satisfied that the
presumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA were engaged. It was
undisputed that Nabill and Mashitta owned the Flat and that Nabill was
residing at the Flat and had the keys to, and control of, the Flat, including
Bedroom 1 and the storeroom. As regards the “Akira” box specifically, it was
not disputed that it belonged to Nabill. It was thus clear that the “Akira”
box, the “Mintek” bag and trolley bag were also in his possession, custody or
control at the material time. To rebut the presumptions, Nabil had to show on
a balance of probabilities that he did not have the drugs in his possession
because he did not know that the various receptacles or places contained a
controlled drug and that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected
to have known the nature of the drug (see Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v
Public Prosecutor [2012] 2 SLR 903 at [16]–[17]; Obeng Comfort v Public
Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 633 at [34]–[35]). For the reasons given earlier (see
also [89]–[90] above), I found that Nabill failed on a balance of
probabilities to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge.

93 Turning to the element of trafficking, even without the presumption of
trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had
proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Nabill possessed the drugs in question
for the purposes of trafficking. The court is entitled to infer the drugs were
in the possession of an accused for the purpose of trafficking on the basis of
evidence such as the quantity of drugs, the presence of drug trafficking
paraphernalia, the absence of evidence that the drugs were for his personal
consumption and other circumstantial evidence substantiating a finding that he
was involved in drug trafficking (see, eg, Raman Selvam s/o Renganathan v
Public Prosecutor [2004] 1 SLR(R) 550 at [48]; Abdul Kahar bin Othman v Public
Prosecutor [2016] SGCA 11 at [92]). In the present case, the evidence pointed
towards Nabill being involved in trafficking the drugs found in his
possession.

94 As stated above, I rejected Nabill’s evidence that he intended to return
the drugs to Faizal or Sufian. The sheer quantity of the drugs (as stated at
[91] above) made an inference of trafficking irresistible. It was not Nabill’s
case that the drugs were intended for his personal consumption and, as I had
rejected his evidence that he had nothing to do with how the drugs came to be
found in the Flat, I thus found that they were stored there for the purposes
of trafficking. Nabill also did not deny that four weighing scales (H1B, H1C,
F1H and F1G4) were in his possession and were used by him (though he claimed
that his use was limited to ascertaining the weight of the “ice” he obtained
for his own consumption). 153

##### Foot Note 153

×

16/8/18 NE 85.

Moreover, the fact that Nabill’s DNA was found on one of the mini packets of
diamorphine (F1D3A) showed that he was involved in packing the mini packets.
Finally, his attempts to distance himself from the drugs through the
fabrication of elaborate accounts showed that he was concerned to conceal his
involvement.

95 In sum, I rejected Nabill’s defence in its entirety and found his evidence
unreliable, incredible and inconsistent with the objective evidence. I found
that on either of the Prosecution’s alternative cases the elements of the 1st
and 2nd Charges against Nabill had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
Accordingly, I convicted Nabill on the charges.

Decision on sentence

96 Given the amount of drugs, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the
MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, is death. However, s 33B of the
MDA confers on the court the discretion to impose the alternative sentence of
life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 15 strokes of the cane, provided
the offender satisfies the requirements in s 33(B)(2)(a) of the MDA and
receives a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor.
The accused bears the legal burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities,
that his involvement in a drug trafficking offence was restricted only to the
activities of a courier as listed in s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA (see Zainudin bin
Mohamed v Public Prosecutor [2018] 1 SLR 449 at [34]).

97 In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that Nabill failed to show
that his involvement was restricted only to the activities listed under s
33B(2)(a) of the MDA. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission because
Nabill, having run a defence that he was unconnected to the drugs found in the
Flat, had not adduced any evidence to show that his involvement was limited to
that of a courier, and the Defence had also not suggested that Nabill was a
courier. 154

##### Foot Note 154

5/11/18 NE 6.

In any event, the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive
assistance. Accordingly, I imposed the mandatory sentence of death on Nabill.
