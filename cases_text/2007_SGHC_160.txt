1 In July 2002 the HDB awarded to Wan Soon Construction Pte Ltd (“Wan Soon”) a
contract for the construction of 1384 units of flats at the Kallang Whampoa
area (“the Works”). Wan Soon awarded to the plaintiff, a company in the
business of providing scaffolding material for construction works, the sub-
contract for the rental, erection and dismantling of metal scaffolding for the
Works. This was a lump sum contract of about $980,000. Pursuant to this sub-
contract the plaintiff commenced the supply and erection of scaffolding as Wan
Soon progressed with the Works. However in April 2004, the HDB terminated the
contract with Wan Soon who in turn terminated the sub-contract with the
plaintiff. By this time, the plaintiff had erected scaffolding for about a
third of the height of the blocks of flats amounting to about 30% of the
entire scaffolding requirement. In May 2004, the HDB awarded the balance of
the Works to the defendant. The plaintiff and defendant attempted to come to
agreement on the terms under which the defendant could take over the rental of
the scaffolding already erected by the plaintiff on site, and for the
plaintiff to supply and erect the scaffolding for the remainder of the works.
The plaintiff initially quoted a sum of $1.1m that was eventually reduced to
$1.094m. However they failed to reach agreement because they could not agree
on the prices of other related materials. In the event the defendant engaged
another contractor, Lian Beng, to supply and erect the remainder of the
scaffolding for the sum of $1.15m. Lian Beng erected its scaffolding above
(but without being connected to) the plaintiff’s scaffolding. In the course of
completing the Works, the defendant made use of the plaintiff’s scaffolding
for the lower levels. Upon completion of the Works, Lian Beng dismantled its
scaffolding as well as those belonging to the plaintiff, returning the pieces
belonging to the plaintiff to its store. However the plaintiff claimed that a
large number of pieces were not returned. The parties agree that the
conversion terminated between June 2005, when the defendant requested the
plaintiff to remove the scaffolding for certain blocks, and March 2006 when
all scaffolding (except for the missing items) were returned.

2 The plaintiff took out the writ of summons in this action on 21 April 2005,
claiming the return of all its metal scaffolding and damages for conversion.
The plaintiff applied in Summons No 2881 of 2005 for judgment but the
Assistant Registrar granted unconditional leave to defend on 17 August 2005.
The plaintiff appealed against this order in Registrar’s Appeal No 234 of
2005. On 7 September 2005 the High Court allowed the appeal and granted the
plaintiff interlocutory judgment against the defendant with damages to be
assessed with costs of the hearing below and the appeal be reserved to the
Registrar.

3 On 19 January 2007, after a 9-day assessment hearing in Notice of Assessment
No 23 of 2006 held on 14-15 June, 28-30 August, 4-5 October, 11 December 2006
and 19 January 2007, the Assistant Registrar made the following orders:

(a) judgment be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $157,792.73 being
damages assessed and interest thereon at 6% per annum from 1 July 2004 till
date of judgment;

(b) costs fixed at $13,000.00 and reasonable disbursements be paid by the
defendant to the plaintiff for the summary judgment and the appeal hearing;
and

(c) costs fixed at $110,000.00 and reasonable disbursements be paid by the
defendant to the plaintiff for the hearing on assessment of damages.

4 In Registrar’s Appeal No 27 of 2007 the plaintiff appealed against the
decision of the Assistant Registrar ordering judgment in the sum of
$157,792.73. The plaintiff prayed for damages to be assessed at $1,499,415.09
for conversion and $362,497.91 in compensation for lost items, as well as
interest thereon.

5 In Registrar’s Appeal No 42 of 2007, the defendant appealed against the
decision of the Assistant Registrar ordering costs against the defendant fixed
at $13,000.00 and reasonable disbursements for the summary judgment and appeal
hearing, and fixed at $110,000 and reasonable disbursements for the assessment
of damages hearing, and interest on the judgment sum at 6% per annum from 1
July 2004 to date of judgment.

6 Counsel made their submissions to me on 21 March and 7 May 2007, at the end
of which I allowed the appeal in Registrar’s Appeal No 27 of 2007 and awarded
the plaintiff the following sums:

(a) $331,500 being damages in conversion with interest on that sum to run from
the date of the cause of action, _viz_. 1 July 2004; and

(b) $148,111 being damages for the lost items with interest to run from the
date of interlocutory judgment, _viz._ 19 January 2007.

Thereafter the defendant applied for leave to withdraw its appeal in
Registrar’s Appeal No 42 of 2007, which I granted.

7 On 5 June 2007 both parties filed appeals against the whole of my decision
of 7 May 2007. The plaintiff’s appeal is filed in Court of Appeal No 65 of
2007 and the defendant’s appeal in Court of Appeal No 68 of 2007. I now give
the grounds for my decision.

8 The first head of damages is in conversion. For the relevant period the
defendant had converted for its use the scaffolding that the plaintiff had
erected on the site. At issue was the quantum of damages. The plaintiff
contend that in law the measure of damages is for a “reasonable sum for hire
during the period of detention”, citing _Clerk & Linsell on Torts 17th_
_Edition_ [13-138] and _Strand Electrical Engineering Co Ltd v Brisford
Entertainments Ltd_ [1952] 2 QB 246 (“Strand’s case”). _Strand’s_ case was
followed by the Court of Appeal in _Siew Kong Engineering Works v Lian Yit
Engineering Sdn Bhd_ [1993] 2 SLR 505. The plaintiff produced expert evidence
on the market rates for various scaffolding components and based on those
rates his claim came up to about $1.5m.

9 The defendant did not dispute that the relevant criterion for assessment of
damages was a reasonable sum for hire during the period of detention. However
the defendant disputed the plaintiff’s contention that this is to be measured
by taking the rates for individual components as this did not take into
account that the large number of components involved which would, in the
ordinary course of commerce, be rented out on a bulk rate basis.

10 I agreed with the defendant’s contention that it would not be reasonable to
use market rates of individual components to assess damages in a bulk
situation as this one. The better approach would be to use the evidence that
is available in this case of the rate that the plaintiff could have fetched in
a situation where he is renting out a similar quantity of scaffolding in
similar circumstances. One piece of evidence for this is the $1.094m that the
plaintiff had quoted in negotiations to resolve the matter, although this is
for the period from June 2004 to November 2005. Another piece of evidence is
the $1.15m that the plaintiff had contracted with Lian Beng for the remainder
of the scaffolding required for the period between April and September 2005.
These figures would have to be adjusted for the fact that they pertain to a
larger quantity of scaffolding (100%) than that in question (30%). Further
evidence is found from the negotiations conducted by the parties in early
2005. On 6 January 2005 the plaintiff offered to rent the detained scaffolding
until June 2005 for $390,000. This was rejected by the defendant who counter-
offered $104,280 and later raised to $260,000.

11 $390,000 would certainly represent the upper limit of the market rate for
the scaffolding for the period up to June 2005. Considering all the evidence
available, I held that $390,000 was a fair rental rate for the detained
scaffolding for the entire period of conversion (sometime between June 2005
and March 2006). However his rate included removal and as the defendant had
undertaken that task, a deduction would have to be made to take into account
the fact that the plaintiff had not incurred that cost. The only evidence of
such cost was given by the defendant’s expert, who said that it would come up
to 15% of the total rental. This was compared with the figure of $147,000 that
the defendant had incurred in effecting the removal (which would constitute
38% of the $390,000). As the actual costs incurred by the defendant would have
been higher due to complication in having to identify and separate the
scaffolding belonging to the plaintiff and to Lian Heng, I took the lower
figure of 15%. Reducing the sum of $390,000 by 15% would result in the figure
of $331,500 which I awarded as damages for conversion.

12 The second head of damages pertains to items that were not returned by the
defendant and, in effect, lost. I was satisfied on the evidence that the
plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence to prove on a balance of probability
that the defendant had failed to return those items. The plaintiff’s expert
had given evidence of a range of rates for the various items concerned. The
defendant had not adduced any evidence of such rates. The rates provided by
the plaintiff’s expert for the various items and quantities concerned are
summarised in the table below:

**Item** |  **Quantity** |  **Plaintiff’s rates** |  **Rates of other contractors** |  **Sum awarded  
using lower rates**  
---|---|---|---|---  
ST 301A  
Cross Brace |  4947 |  $3.00 to $5.00 |  $5.10 to $8.50 |  $14, 841.00

4m C-channel |  68 |  Nil |  $37.00 |  $2,516  
3m C-channel |  41 |  Nil |  $28.00 |  $1,148  
2m C-channel |  44 |  Nil |  $19.00 |  $836  
5m Pipe |  86 |  $21 to $21.60 |  $20.00 to $39.00 |  $1,720  
4m Pipe |  222 |  $19.00 |  $13.33 to $26.00 |  $2,595.26  
3m Pipe |  349 |  $10.50 |  $20.00 |  $3.664.50  
2m Pipe |  2372 |  $7.00 |  $6.67 to $13.00 |  $15,821.24  
1m Pipe |  3536 |  $2.40 to $3.50 |  $3.33 to $7.00 |  $8,486.40  
**Total** |  |  |  |  **$148,111.38**  
  
13 I awarded damages on the basis of the lower rates. This is shown in the
last column of the table. This came to $148,111.

14 I also ordered the defendant to pay interest on the sum of $331,500 from
the cause of action on 1 July 2004 and on the sum of $148,111 from the
judgment on 19 January 2007.

15 As the defendant had withdrawn its appeal in Registrar’s Appeal No 42 of
2007, there was no necessity for me to deal with the question of costs awarded
by the Assistant Registrar below. I therefore did not consider it. However,
despite this, the notice of appeal filed by the defendant appears to include
the matters in Registrar’s Appeal No 42 of 2007. If that be so, I would state
that if I had considered the matter, I would have dismissed the defendant’s
appeal in Registrar’s Appeal No 42 of 2007 in view of my decision in
Registrar’s Appeal No 27 of 2007.
