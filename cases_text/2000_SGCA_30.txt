** JUDGMENT: **

_**Cur Adv Vult**_** __**

1\. These two appeals arose from the claim of Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd,
the plaintiffs, against Seah Chwee Lim, the defendant, for damages for
professional negligence. In the court below, the defendant admitted the
negligence complained of but maintained that his negligence did not cause any
loss to the plaintiffs or alternatively that the plaintiffs had contributed to
the loss. The trial judge found that the defendant’s negligence did cause the
plaintiffs to suffer some losses and that there was no contributory negligence
on the part of the plaintiffs. He awarded the plaintiffs only certain items of
the loss claimed by them. Against his decision both the plaintiffs and the
defendant appealed, and we propose to deal with both of their appeals together
in this judgment. For convenience, we shall continue to refer to the parties
as the plaintiffs and the defendant respectively.

_****_

The facts

2\. In April 1993, two of the directors of the plaintiffs, Azam Ali and Chow
Kwok Seng (‘Chow’), were interested in purchasing the property, No. 13 Jalan
Besar (‘the property’). They caused a search to be made at the Registry of
Deeds and found that there was executed a deed of appointment of trustees in
relation to the property. Azam Ali then got in touch with one of the trustees,
Syed Salim Alhadad bin Syed Ahmad Alhadad (‘Syed Salim’), who referred him to
his nephew Syed Jafaralsadeq bin Abdul Kadir (‘Jafar’). Azam Ali met Jafar and
negotiated with the latter for the purchase of the property. Eventually they
agreed on a purchase price of $550,000. Arising from the negotiations, the
plaintiffs on 29 May 1993 were granted an option to purchase the property by
Syed Ibrahim bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad, Syed Hashim bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad and
Syed Salim (collectively referred to as ‘the Vendors’), acting as the personal
representatives of the estate of Syed Abdulkadir bin Ahmad Alhadad (‘Syed
Abdulkadir’).

3\. On 31 May 1993, Azam Ali and Chow saw the defendant and showed him the
option they had obtained and instructed him to act for the plaintiffs in the
intended purchase of the property. The defendant did not appear to have taken
any step in relation to the option. The plaintiffs exercised the option on 22
June 1993, and only thenceforth the defendant carried out a search on the
property. He was not satisfied with the result of the search, as it did not
show that the title to the property was vested in the estate of Syed
Abdulkadir. On the following day, he wrote to G Balan Nair & Co (‘Balan
Nair’), who were the solicitors for the Vendors, stating his finding that
there was a break in the chain of title and requested Balan Nair to explain
how the Vendors as the personal representatives of the estate of Syed
Abdulkadir were able to sell the property. On 30 June 1993, Balan Nair replied
without however dealing specifically with this query. They informed the
defendant that the sale was subject to the Vendors obtaining an order of court
under s 35(2) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61). However,
the defendant was not satisfied with the reply, and he further wrote to Balan
Nair on 1 July 1993 stating, inter alia, that the court order would not cure
the ‘bad root’ of title and, even if granted, might not be good for the
purpose, and that the Vendors might not be the actual trustees of the
proprietor of the property. He requested Balan Nair to forward the draft
affidavits of the trustees in support of the application for the order so that
he could ascertain their rights in seeking the order of court for the sale of
the property to the plaintiffs.

4\. A copy of the defendant’s letter was sent to the plaintiffs. On receipt,
Azam Ali forwarded a copy to Jafar. Jafar replied directly to Azam Ali,
assuring him thus:

> We have done title search on the said property and you do not have to worry
> about anything, as the sale shall be sanction [sic] by the Court. Please be
> informed that we are selling the said property as the legal owner and you
> and your lawyer should not worry unnecessarily about who is the equitable
> owner, that is our family internal matter with the Basalamah families.

> After all the sale proceed [sic] shall be held in Trust Account with our
> lawyers after the sale.

5\. Azam Ali subsequently spoke to the defendant on 6 July 1993 and the latter
made an attendance note of the conversation as follows:

> 1\. Azam Ali said the trustees have said they have powers to sell. The rest
> are internal matter. All beneficiaries will sign.
>
> 2\. Ali said trustees offended. I told him I had no intention to do so. It
> is entirely up to trustees to satisfy themselves of the status. I owed
> Purchaser a duty.
>
> …

6\. The defendant, nevertheless, continued to seek clarification on the
Vendor’s title. He wrote to Balan Nair on 13 July 1993 asking for a copy of
the draft affidavit in support of the Vendor’s pending application under s
35(2) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act. Balan Nair declined this
request on 4 August 1993 stating that he would only provide the defendant with
a copy of the court order. The defendant then spoke to Azam Ali again on 6
August 1993 and thereafter made the following note:

> 1\. Ali said he has read the fax of 4.8.93 by G. Balan Nair & Co.
>
> 2\. I told him since the Vendor’s solicitors are adamant about it, we don’t
> have a choice but to hope for the best.
>
> 3\. There is no contractual term for us to peruse the affidavit first. Ali
> said ‘ok’ - let it be.

> Don’t offend the Vendors or their solicitors.

7\. In the meanwhile, the defendant received copies of the title deeds on 14
July 1993. On perusing the deeds, he realised that there was a break in the
title of the Vendors to the property and that the plaintiffs on completion
would not receive a proper title. Nonetheless, he did not bring this to the
attention of Azam Ali or the other directors of the plaintiffs.

8\. Eventually, Balan Nair forwarded a copy of the order of court dated 27
August 1993 and the affidavit in support of the application for the order. The
affidavit did not provide any answer as to how the Vendors became entitled to
sell the property. Nevertheless, the defendant took no further action on
receiving these documents, even though he had earlier taken the view that the
court order would not cure the ‘bad root’ of title. He did not advise the
plaintiffs’ directors not to complete the purchase on the ground that the
Vendors had no title to the property. In the result, the plaintiffs went ahead
and completed the purchase of the property on 15 October 1993.

9\. Approximately two to three months later, the plaintiffs applied to Tat Lee
Bank Ltd (‘the Bank’) for a loan on the security of a mortgage of the
property. Shook Lin & Bok (‘SLB’) were instructed to act for the Bank as well
as the plaintiffs in the proposed mortgage, and Mr Lim Choo Eng (‘Mr Lim’) of
SLB was the solicitor in charge of the matter. After making a search, Mr Lim
wrote to the defendant on 31 January 1994, stating that the Vendors did not
have the capacity to sell the property, as they had not obtained the grant of
the letters of administration de bonis non to the estate of Mohamed bin Ali
bin Faraj Basalamah (‘the Basalamah estate’) and that the deed of assignment
of the property was ineffectual to transfer the property to the plaintiffs.
However, no copy of this letter was sent to the plaintiffs and they were not
apprised of the problem. Only in or around February 1994, when Azam Ali called
Mr Lim enquiring about the progress of the loan application, were the
plaintiffs informed of the problem with regard to the title arising from the
absence of letters of administration de bonis non. Following from that
conversation, Chow approached the defendant who promised to resolve the matter
with Mr Lim. However, there was no solution to the problem, and the
application for the loan was eventually refused by the Bank on or about 27
December 1994.

10\. In the meanwhile, the plaintiffs had very much earlier instructed
Palakrishnan & Partners (‘P & P") to recover possession of the property from
the tenants. In fact soon after the completion of the purchase, on 29 October
1993, P & P made an application on behalf of the plaintiffs to the Tenants
Compensation Board under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act (Cap
60) to recover such possession. A date for the hearing of the application was
fixed for 22 April 1994. However, before the hearing, the plaintiffs reached a
settlement with the two tenants of the property and the application was
subsequently withdrawn. On the basis of the settlement, compensations
amounting to a total sum of $54,500 were paid on 28 and 30 June 1994.

11\. P & P were also instructed to look into the problem relating to the title
of the property. After having conducted a title search on the property and a
probate search, they wrote to Balan Nair on 30 June 1994:

> We note that your clients are not the individuals whom the Grant of Letters
> of Administration of the Estate of [Basalamah], the owner of the property,
> had been granted. Our searches show no trace, as well, of any Grant of
> Letters of Administration De Bonis Non having been granted to your clients,
> so as to permit them to sell the property to our clients.

> Please let us know whether your clients have taken any steps to obtain a
> Grant of Letters of Administration de Bonis Non so that our client’s title
> to the property may be rectified. If so, please let us know the Probate No.
> of the application, and if not, please advise your clients to rectify the
> problem forthwith.

12\. Balan Nair replied that they had since closed the file and were no longer
acting for the Vendors and suggested that the query should be made to them
direct. P & P instead wrote to the defendant on 28 July 1994, informing him
that, in their view, the title to the property had not passed to the
plaintiffs as the Vendors were not the administrators of the Basalamah estate,
the owner of the property. They requested for a satisfactory explanation from
the defendant. The defendant replied on 1 August and 19 October 1994
maintaining that so long as the court order stood it could not be said that
the Vendors had no power to sell the property to the plaintiffs and to pass a
good title effectively to the plaintiffs, and concluded thus:

> 3\. We conclude that the title as it stands in the records registry of the
> Registry of Titles and Deeds is a good title, in spite of the fact that the
> personal representatives of the Estate of Mohamed Bin Ali Bin Faraj
> Basalamah did not have a Grant of Letters of Administration De Bonis Non.
> Justice Lai Kew Chai must have taken judicial notice of that when he granted
> the Order on 27 Aug 93.

P & P were not persuaded, and they wrote to the Vendors on 27 October 1994
repeating their views on the deficiency in the Vendors’ title to the property.
They requested the latter to provide either a copy of any grant of letters of
administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate or other satisfactory
evidence of their power to sell the property.

13\. The Vendors then instructed Netto Tan & S Magin who wrote to P & P on 12
November 1994 stating that their clients had instructed them to apply for a
vesting order, and that they were in the process of preparing the application.
They further stated, in the alternative, that the Vendors offered to repay all
the monies paid by the plaintiffs, without interest, in exchange for the
plaintiffs taking all the necessary steps to divest themselves of whatever
interest they had acquired in the property. However, no application was filed
by Netto Tan & S Margin and the plaintiffs did not accept the alternative
offer.

14\. It appeared that on 21 December 1994, Peter Pang & Co initiated
proceedings in Originating Summons No. 787 of 1993 on behalf of the Vendors
for an order that, further to the order dated 27 August 1993, the property be
vested in the applicants as trustees. P & P became aware of the application
and wrote to Peter Pang & Co on 25 January 1995, stating that it was
imperative that the Vendors highlight all the objections to title made by SLB
and themselves at the hearing fixed for 27 January 1995, and reiterating that
the Vendors could not have given good title without a grant of letters of
administration de bonis non.

15\. In the meanwhile, on 16 September 1994, the letters of administration de
bonis non to the Basalamah estate were in fact granted to one Syed Ali Redha
Alsagoff (‘Syed Alsagoff’), who was the attorney of Shaik Ahmad bin Mohamed
bin Ali Basalamah and Shaik Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Basalamah, the sons and
beneficiaries of the estate. The letters of administration were issued on 22
November 1994 and registered against the property on 26 January 1995.

16\. On 2 March 1995, the plaintiffs instructed P & P to seek an opinion on
their title to the property from Mr H M Dyne (‘Mr Dyne’), a senior
conveyancing lawyer. Mr Dyne gave his opinion on 17 March 1995 which was to
the effect that (a) the order dated 27 August 1993 was clearly a nullity as
the Vendors had misrepresented their status in the ex-parte application, (b)
that a grant of letters of administration de bonis non was required to
continue with the administration of the Estate, and (c) that no title had
passed to the plaintiffs. Mr Dyne also advised in general terms some steps or
actions the plaintiffs should take with a view to seeking a proper title to
the property. However, no step or action appeared to have been taken by the
plaintiffs.

17\. About two months later, on 8 May 1995, Syed Alsagoff instituted
proceedings in Originating Summons No 437 of 1995 (‘O S No. 437 of 1995’)
against the Vendors and plaintiffs seeking to set aside the sale. The
application was heard before Warren Khoo J, and he held that the Vendors had
no capacity, merely as trustees of Syed Abdulkadir’s estate, to sell the
property in the absence of a grant of letters of administration de bonis non
over the Basalamah estate in their favour and accordingly he set aside the
sale. He also rejected the defences of acquiescence and laches raised by the
plaintiffs: see _Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff (administrator of the estate of
Mohamed bin Ali, deceased) v Syed Salim Alhadad_[1996] 3 SLR 410. Against that
decision, the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal and the appeal was
dismissed: _Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd v Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff and Ors_
[1997] 3 SLR 13.

18\. Following the dismissal of their appeal, the plaintiffs instituted the
present action against the defendant claiming damages for breach of contract
and/or negligence in failing to advise them that the Vendors had no capacity
to convey the property and that no title would pass to them on completion of
the sale. There was no claim for the refund of the purchase price paid for the
property, as that had been refunded to them by the time the action commenced.

The decision below

19\. Before the trial judge, the defendant admitted that he was negligent in
omitting to advise the plaintiffs that the Vendors had no capacity to sell the
property as they did not have the grant of letters of administration de bonis
non to the Basalamah estate. The learned judge found that there was no
contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs and allowed, inter alia,
the following:

> (a) damages arising from the loss of the property to be assessed by the
> registrar, the measure of such loss being the increase in value of the
> property without vacant possession as at 17 July 1996 over the contract
> price, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6 % from the date of
> the issue of the writ to the date of judgment;
>
> (b) two thirds of the costs of the action.

The learned judge rejected the following claims of the plaintiffs:

> (a) the sum of $54,500 paid to the tenants of the property as compensation
> for delivering of vacant possession of the property;
>
> (b) the sum of $5,416.39 being the costs paid to P & P in respect of the
> application to the Tenants Compensation Board;
>
> (c) the solicitor and client costs of the plaintiffs in defending the claim
> in O S No 437 of 1995 and the party and party costs incurred in the two
> applications in those proceedings and the costs for attending taxation of
> the party and party costs in O S No 437 of 1995.

The appeals

20\. The plaintiffs appeal against the dismissal of the above claims, and the
defendant appeals against the trial judge’s finding that there was no
contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs and against the basis of
assessment of general damages as awarded by the learned judge. The issues
before us are essentially the following, namely: (a) whether there was any
contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs; (b) the measure of
damages for assessment before the registrar; (c) whether the plaintiffs are
entitled to recover the amounts of compensation paid to the tenants of the
property for delivery of vacant possession; (d) whether the plaintiffs are
entitled to recover the costs paid to their solicitors in respect of the
application to the Tenants Compensation Board; and (e) whether the plaintiffs
are entitled to recover their costs in O S No. 437 of 1995.

_****_

Contributory negligence

21\. On the issue of contributory negligence, counsel for the defendant relies
essentially on what the plaintiffs’ director, Azam Ali, did with regard to the
defendant’s attempt or effort to conduct investigation on the property. It was
in evidence that, on 6 July and 4 August 1993, after the defendant had written
to the Vendors’ solicitors raising questions on the Vendors’ title to the
property, Azam Ali spoke to the defendant and, among other things, instructed
the defendant not to offend the Vendors. Counsel contends that this
instruction, considered in the proper context, was tantamount to an
interference in the defendant’s investigation of title, and thus impeded his
investigation. By this instruction Azam Ali had caused the defendant to cease
or ease up on the investigation. It is said that the defendant understood the
instruction to mean not to probe further into the Vendors’ title to the
property. It is also said that Azam Ali in fact admonished him for
investigating title, because Azam Ali himself was satisfied with the Vendors’
explanations.

22\. The learned judge found that there was no undue pressure exerted on
defendant by Azam Ali in the latter’s instruction not to offend the Vendors,
and even if there were, that did not relieve the defendant from his duty to
investigate and advise the plaintiffs accordingly. Neither were the
defendant’s investigations on title thereby impeded. The learned judge said at
66-68 of his judgement:

> 66\. … Azam Ali told him that trustees said they had powers to sell. Azam
> Ali did not tell him to accept the trustees’ assertion and to stop his own
> investigations. The tone of the note was that the defendant did not intend
> to offend the trustees, and even if they were offended, he still owed a duty
> to the plaintiffs to investigate. In fact he did not stop his investigations
> and continued his queries with Balan Nair on 13 July.

> 67\. The second attendance note (see paragraph 13) only mentioned the draft
> affidavit, with no reference to any instructions to cease investigations …
> Neither attendance note recorded that the vendors had threatened to call off
> the sale, nor that the purchase must be completed regardless of the state of
> the title.
>
> 68\. When a client instructs his lawyer not to offend a vendor, it does not
> mean that he is relieved of his duty to investigate. A purchaser has a
> legitimate interest that a transaction proceeds smoothly without any
> avoidable friction. The solicitor should then conduct his investigations
> with greater tact and sensitivity, but he should not stop carrying out his
> duties.

23\. The learned judge was plainly right, and we agree with him entirely.
First, the attendance notes made by the defendant in respect of the
conversations between him and Azam Ali on 6 July and 4 August 1993 did not
reveal any indication that Azam Ali did not require the defendant to carry out
the investigations which he had initiated. Based on the notes, it appeared to
us that, so far as relevant, substantially what Azam Ali did was to inform him
that the trustees were offended by his enquiry as to their title to the
property and to request him not to offend them. Such a request certainly was
not, and could not in any sense be construed by the defendant to be, an
instruction by Azam Ali that the defendant should not carry out his
investigation on the title to the property which he was obliged to do.
Secondly, the defendant’s record showed that Azam Ali had authorised him to
obtain copies of all the title deeds to the property. There was no note
recorded by the defendant which shows either expressly or by necessary
implication that Azam Ali had given him any instruction to the effect that he
was to desist from making any investigation on the title or other important
aspects of the property, which was central to his duty acting as the solicitor
for the purchaser of a property.

24\. It is significant that after the conversation with Azam Ali on 6 July
1993, the defendant continued with his enquiry of the proposed application for
the order under s 35(2) of the Conveyancing and the Law of Property Act and
the efficacy of the proposed order of court and hence the capacity and power
of the Vendors to sell. In particular, he sought a copy of the affidavit in
support of the application for the order. If indeed there were instructions
from Azam Ali to accept the Vendors’ assurance concerning the title to the
property, there would be no reason for repeating the same request to view the
affidavit in support. We are thus reinforced in our view that the defendant
never considered Azam Ali’s instruction to mean that he should cease or
suspend his investigations on the property.

25\. It is difficult to understand how the instructions given by Azam Ali
could amount to an interference, such that it impeded the duty of the
defendant to investigate the property and to advise his clients. What the
defendant appears to suggest is that he was impeded in discharging his duties
because Azam Ali was anxious to complete the purchase and thus was unconcerned
about the technicalities as to the title of the property. In response, we
hasten to say this. If that were true, it would make his duty to advise the
plaintiffs of the consequences all the more imperative. Where a solicitor
relies on his client’s express instructions as a defence to a claim for
negligence, he must show that he has provided adequate advice to his client
before acting on the client’s instructions: _Jackson & Powell on Professional
Negligence_ (1997) at para 4-93. In this case, of course, the plaintiffs were
anxious to acquire the property. However, they were entitled to expect that,
even in the face of such anxiety, the defendant would conduct the
investigations on the property adequately as a solicitor and advise them
accordingly. In our judgment, there was no contributory negligence on the part
of the plaintiffs.

26\. The defendant was not deprived of any relevant information because of the
conduct of the plaintiffs allegedly preventing him from rendering this advice.
He received copies of the affidavit and title deeds from Balan Nair. From the
letters he wrote to Balan Nair, it seems to us that at all material times he
formed the view that the plaintiffs on completion would not be getting any
title or interest in the property and the problem would not be resolved by the
court order which was being sought by the Vendors. Unfortunately,
notwithstanding this, he failed to advise the plaintiffs against the purchase
of the property.

Damages

**

27\. In the court below, the plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, damages as
follows:

> (i) loss of the property and the wasted expenses in purchasing the same
> including (but not limited to) the difference between the cost of the
> alternative premises and the cost of the property (after making necessary
> adjustments).
>
> (ii) alternatively, the loss of opportunity to purchase a property similar
> to the Property for the same or a similar price.

The trial judge dealt with this claim at 74 and 75 of his judgment as follows:

> 74\. … How is the damages for this loss to be measured? The plaintiffs
> submitted that it should be the difference between the original contract
> price and the market price when the purchase failed, and cited _Stinchcombe
> & Coope Ltd v Addison Cooper, Jesson & Co_ [1971] 115 SJ 368 as authority.
> The defendant contended that it should be the difference between the
> contract price and the market price at February 1994 when Azam Ali first
> heard of the title defect in the title from Mr Lim because the plaintiffs
> have mitigated their loss and should have taken steps to acquire alternative
> premises immediately.

> 75\. I accept the plaintiffs’ position. When Mr Lim informed Azam Ali of the
> problem with the title, that could have been rectified if the necessary
> grant de bonis non was obtained. The difference between the positions of the
> plaintiffs and the defendant is the factual issue when the purchase failed,
> and I find that it failed when it was set aside.

Later the learned judge concluded thus at 80:

> 80\. I find that the damages should be the increase in the value of the
> property without vacant possession as at 17 July 1996 over the contract
> price. As there was no evidence adduced on this, it shall be assessed by the
> registrar.

28\. The arguments before us, as were before the learned judge, are directed
at the correct date to be taken for the purpose of assessing the measure of
damages. Very briefly, counsel for the defendant argues that 17 July 1996, as
determined by the learned judge, is not correct as the adoption of that date
is inconsistent with the learned judge’s decision that it was unreasonable for
the plaintiffs to defend O S 437 of 1995, and hence they could not recover the
costs incurred in that action. The plaintiffs were not justified in deferring
seeking alternative premises until the judgment was delivered. The purchase
failed _ab initio_ , because the Vendors had no title to the property, and
damages ought to be assessed as at the date of completion. As the plaintiffs
eventually recovered the purchase price, there was no further assessable loss.
Alternatively, it is argued that the appropriate date for the assessment
should be either 31 January 1994 or 12 November 1994. With regard to the
former, that was the date when Mr Lim of SLB wrote to the defendant stating,
among other things, that the Vendors had no capacity to sell the property and
that the title to the property had not passed to the plaintiffs. There was no
evidence that the sale could have been rectified then by a grant of letters of
administration de bonis non in favour of the Vendors. As for the latter date,
the plaintiffs ought reasonably to have accepted the offer of refund of the
purchase price from the Vendors, since they had by then received separate
advice from both Mr Lim and P & P that the Vendors had no title to the
property. Finally, in either of these cases, it was not possible to rectify
the defect, as firstly, there was no evidence that the Vendors could have
obtained a grant of letters of administration de bonis non, and secondly,
after 16 September 1994, that became impossible as Syed Alsagoff had by then
obtained the grant.

29\. On the other hand, counsel for the plaintiffs contends that the date of
assessment was correctly identified by the learned judge as 17 July 1996.
First, the court order dated 27 August 1993, which sanctioned the sale of the
property by the Vendors, remained valid and binding and equally the conveyance
was valid until it was set aside. Secondly, even if the sale and purchase
failed _ab initio_ , the court can choose an alternative date of assessment,
where it is just to do so. The date of 31 January 1994 was not appropriate, as
Mr Lim never specifically advised the plaintiffs that they had received no
title. The alternative date of 12 November 1994 was also not appropriate for
two reasons. First, the offer of refund from the Vendors failed to compensate
the plaintiffs for all their losses. Secondly, it was reasonable for the
plaintiffs to have pursued the course of seeking to rectify the defect in
title. Mr Dyne’s opinion suggested this, and the alternative of accepting the
failure of the sale was in the circumstances unreasonably drastic at that
stage. Until the plaintiffs were served with the summons in O S 437 of 1995,
there was no evidence that they were aware that a grant of letters of
administration de bonis non had been obtained. Consequently, it was reasonable
for the plaintiffs to await the outcome of O S 437 of 1995.

30\. It seems to us that the learned judge in making the award of damages as
well as counsel for both parties in their submissions before us proceeded on
the basis that damages for the loss of the property are recoverable as a
result of the defendant’s negligence. With respect, we think that there is
fundamental error implicit in such award and submissions. The question which
should be addressed first is whether such loss was caused by the negligence of
the defendant. In our opinion, the defendant’s negligence was his failure to
advise the plaintiffs that the Vendors had no title to the property, as the
property was part of the Basalamah estate and the Vendors, not having obtained
the grant of letters of administration de bonis non, were not the
administrators of the estate. If the defendant had fully discharged his
professional duty to the plaintiffs, the latter would have been advised that
the Vendors had no title to the property which they purported to convey to the
plaintiffs with the consequence that the plaintiffs would have declined to
complete the purchase and would have rescinded the sale and purchase
agreement, which they were fully entitled to do. In the circumstances, it
cannot be said that the defendant’s negligence caused the plaintiffs to lose
the property which they would otherwise have purchased.

31\. We therefore drew counsel’s attention to this error and have since
received fresh written submissions from them. Counsel for the defendant seems
to suggest that this point has been dealt with in his arguments before us.
This we find is not so. In his arguments before us and in particular in his
written skeletal arguments, counsel referred to this point peripherally and in
a different context. In his fresh written submissions, counsel has not added
anything material to what we have said and it is not necessary to deal with
his written submissions further.

32\. We now turn to the written submissions advanced by counsel for the
plaintiffs. Counsel accepts that if the defendant had advised the plaintiffs
properly, the plaintiffs would have taken steps to rescind the contract.
However, counsel contends that it does not follow that the plaintiffs would
not have purchased the property. At that time, it was open to the plaintiffs
to request Jafar to cause or procure the Vendors to approach the beneficiaries
with a view to obtaining the necessary consents or authorisations for the
Vendors to apply for the grant of letters of administration de bonis non to
the Basalamah estate, and if the beneficiaries agreed, the Vendors would be in
a position to regularise their title to the property and enter into a fresh
contract with the plaintiffs. Alternatively, the plaintiffs could have asked
Jafar to procure and arrange for a direct negotiation between the plaintiffs
and the beneficiaries to take place with a view to enabling the plaintiffs to
purchase the property. There was no reason why the beneficiaries would not
agree to the sale of the property to the plaintiffs at the price at which the
Vendors had agreed, as that was the prevailing market price at that time.

33\. We find that these arguments have no evidential basis in support. There
was not a shred of evidence that the beneficiaries to the Basalamah estate
were accessible to Jafar or the Vendors or were amenable to the Vendors taking
out the letters of administration de bonis non. None of the Vendors were
entitled in their own right to apply for and take out letters of
administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate. There was no possibility
at all of the plaintiffs acquiring any title to the property from the Vendors.
Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiffs could have approached the
beneficiaries and entered into direct negotiations with them. In our opinion,
these arguments are purely speculative and are devoid of any merit whatsoever.

34\. There is a third argument advanced by counsel, and that is if the
beneficiaries refused to sell the property to the plaintiffs, the latter would
have immediately gone into the market to purchase an alternative property in
the Jalan Besar area. We propose to deal with this argument shortly when we
consider the alternative claim by the plaintiffs for the loss of opportunity
of buying an alternative property.

35\. This is not a case where the defendant was engaged by the plaintiffs to
rectify a defect in the title to the property, and owing to his negligence he
had failed to secure a good title for the plaintiffs. In our judgment, the
negligence of the defendant in relation to the sale and purchase of the
property did not cause the plaintiffs to lose the property and the plaintiffs
were not entitled to damages for the loss of the property. The dominant and
indeed the sole cause for this loss is the Vendors’ lack of title to the
property they contracted to sell to the plaintiffs.

36\. We find support for this view from the Canadian case of _Messineo v
Beale_ (1978) 86 DLR (3d) 713, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal.
There, a solicitor searched the title to a property which was being purchased
by his client but failed to discover that the vendor had no title to a
significant part of what the deed purported to convey. The plaintiff purchaser
argued that the proper measure of damages was the value of the portion of the
property they had failed to obtain. This was rejected by Arnup JA who affirmed
the trial judge’s award of nominal damages. He said at p 716:

> In my view it is obvious that the defendant’s breach of duty was not the
> cause of the plaintiff’s getting no title to Murch’s Point [the relevant
> portion of property]. The vendor had no title to Murch’s Point, and could
> give none. Nothing the defendant could have done would have changed the
> situation.

> It is to be observed that if the defendant had discovered, before closing,
> that the [vendor] had no title to Murch’s Point, it would have been his duty
> to communicate the fact at once to his clients. Their options then would
> have been to refuse to close, to close and take title to what [the vendor]
> could convey, or try and negotiate once more for a lower price…

Zuber JA, another member of the Court, said at p 718:

> The negligence of the defendant did not cause the plaintiffs to lose Murch’s
> Point. Since Finley, the vendor in the subject transaction never had title
> to Murch’s Point it was never within the grasp of the plaintiffs, and hence

> Therefore, it is the responsibility of the defendant to compensate the
> plaintiffs for the loss suffered as a result of entering this transaction;
> but as the reasons of Arnup, J.A., demonstrate, there was in fact no loss.

37\. Zuber JA, in a subsequent case, _Kienzle v Stringer_ (1981) 130 DLR (3d)
272 at 275, explained the decision in _Messineo v Beale_ in the following
terms:

> In my respectful opinion, _Messineo v. Beale_ decides only that the
> defendant did not cause the plaintiff any damage. Since the vendor did not
> own Murch's Point, the defendant's solicitor did not cause its loss. The
> solicitor caused the plaintiff to complete a transaction that he would

> and would have suffered no loss at all. It would have been far different if
> the vendor had owned Murch's Point and the solicitor had omitted the
> property from the deed or in some other way had caused the plaintiff to lose
> the property. In that case, the plaintiff's damage would have been the value
> of the missing property despite the fact that the value of what he had
> received was greater than the purchase price.

In that case, the defendant solicitor who acted for the plaintiff in the
purchase of a farm was negligent in failing to include all the owners of the
property in the conveyance. One year after the purchase, the plaintiff
attempted to sell the farm, and agreed to purchase another property
conditional on the sale of his farm. In anticipation of the sale, he gave up
the lease of the adjoining farm. Only then was it discovered that there was a
defect in his title to the farm. As a result, the sale fell through and the
plaintiff was unable to purchase the other property. He then had to buy out
the interest of the other owner of the farm who was not joined in the
conveyance, and lost the profit for operating the farm because he had given up
the lease of the adjoining farm. At first instance, he recovered only the
price he paid for purchasing the owner’s interest and the fees paid to the
defendant. He appealed and Court of Appeal allowed his claim for the loss of
the farming profit but limited it to one year. He was, however, not allowed
the profit which he would have made had he purchased the other property. The
court considered this loss as too remote.

38\. Both these cases were followed in another Canadian case, _Clarke v
Milford_ (1987) 38 DLR (4th) 139, which was a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Nova Scotia. There, the property under the will of a testator was devised
to his son. After the death of the testator, the mother on behalf of the son,
who was then still an infant, sold the property to the plaintiff. The
defendant solicitor acted for both the plaintiff and the mother in the
transaction, which was apparently completed and the entire purchase price was
paid. All the parties assumed that the necessary steps were taken in
completing the transaction. The client subsequently discovered that no deed
was executed by the mother and no order of court approving the sale was
obtained. No title therefore was conveyed to the client. The property was in
the meanwhile dealt with by the son who had attained the age of majority. The
client sued the solicitor for damages for negligence. Before the Court of
Appeal one of the questions raised was the damages to which the client was
entitled. The court following the decision in _Messineo v Beale_ (supra) held
that the solicitor could not have done anything more than to advise the client
of the inability of the mother to convey the property, and that the client was
entitled only to the actual loss he had suffered which included the purchase
price paid, the fees paid to the solicitor and the taxes paid for the
property, and that no damages were awarded for the loss of the property.

39\. Reverting to the case at hand, the plaintiffs rely on _Stinchcombe &
Cooper Ltd v Addison, Cooper, Jesson & Co_ (1971) 115 SJ 368. We do not find
this case of any assistance. There, the solicitors were negligent in failing
to inform their clients that the contract of sale had been executed by the
vendors. This caused the plaintiffs to be late in commencement of
construction, as they thought the contract had yet to be signed, and gave the
vendors ground to rescind the contract, which they did. By reason of the
negligence of the solicitor, the clients lost the contract. Damages for loss
of the property were therefore recoverable. What was decided in that case has
no application here.

40\. In this case, to allow a recovery of the loss as awarded below would
place the plaintiffs in a better position than would be the case if the
defendant had properly discharged his duty. The plaintiffs are not entitled to
damages for the loss of the property. The order of the trial judge awarding
such damages to be assessed before the registrar should be set aside.

_**

Loss of opportunity

**_

41\. We now turn to the plaintiffs’ alternative claim for the loss of
opportunity to acquire a similar property. The basis of this claim is that if
the defendant had discharged his duty, the plaintiffs would not only have
avoided the contract but would also have acquired a similar property along
Jalan Besar or a unit in Sim Lim Tower which is near to the premises where
they had been conducting their business, and this opportunity they had lost by
reason of the completion of the purchase of the property. The defendant, on
the other hand, contends that since this claim was also premised on the same
negligence or breach of duty on the part of the defendant, and all that he had
failed to do was to prevent the plaintiff from completing the purchase because
the Vendors had no title to the Property, the alternative claim must also
fail.

42\. We are unable to agree with the defendant’s contention. We think that
there is some merit in the argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs.
While it is true that this alternative claim of the plaintiffs is premised on
same negligence or breach of duty of the defendant as that on which the
plaintiffs’ claim of loss of the property is based, the same consequence does
not necessarily follow with respect to the plaintiffs’ loss under this head.
On the evidence adduced, there are sufficient grounds for saying that if the
plaintiffs had been properly advised they would have rescinded the contract
for the purchase of the property in October 1993 or earlier and very likely
would have immediately or soon thereafter looked for and purchased a similar
property along Jalan Besar facing Sim Lim Tower or in the alternative a unit
in Sim Lim Tower for the purpose of their business. The property (which they
had then purchased) was rent controlled and they had purchased it for their
own business and not for investment. They had adequate financial resources for
the purpose, as they completed the purchase without any borrowing from a bank
or other financial institution. At or about the time of their purchase, the
tenancy of the shop unit at Sim Lim Square at which they carried on business
was due to expire on 31 July 1994. Soon after the completion of the purchase,
they instituted proceedings for recovery of vacant possession of the property
and also at the same time commenced negotiations with the tenants of the
property with a view to obtaining vacant possession, which they eventually
succeeded.

43\. There was evidence given by Azam Ali to the effect that if the defendant
had advised the plaintiffs that the Vendors had no title to the property, the
plaintiffs would have sought to buy a similar property along Jalan Besar
facing Sim Lim Tower or alternatively a unit in Sim Lim Tower having an area
between 300 and 350 square feet. There was no evidence adduced showing that,
at or about that time, there was available in the market a similar property
along Jalan Besar. But there was evidence adduced showing the availability of
units in Sim Lim Tower fulfilling the requirements indicated by Azam Ali. In
particular, there was produced in evidence a list of sales of such units, and
on the basis of this list, Azam Ali said that if the defendant had advised the
plaintiffs in or before October 1993 that the Vendors had no title to the
property they would have bought, for example, unit #03-15 having an area of
312.2 sq ft or #B1-47 having an area of 322.9 sq ft (depending of course on
their availability).

44\. Given their need for premises for their business and the approaching
expiry of their existing tenancy of the shop unit in Sim Lim Square, we find
that it is very likely that the plaintiffs would in fact have gone into the
market to look for alternative premises for the purpose of their business, if
they had been advised by the defendant against the completion of the property.
On the basis of the evidence adduced, we find that they would have sought to
purchase a unit in Sim Lim Tower as an alternative. In our judgment, the
plaintiffs had indeed lost the opportunity of re-entering the market in or
before October 1993 and buying a unit in Sim Lim Tower, which would meet their
requirements, and this loss was occasioned by the defendant’s negligence or
breach of duty.

45\. The next question is whether this loss is too remote. In this case, as
there is a concurrent liability in contract and tort, it is necessary to bear
in mind the respective tests for remoteness in these causes of action. In the
case of contractual liability, the test for recoverable loss is that within
the reasonable contemplation of the parties, based on their imputed knowledge
(in the ordinary course of things) or actual knowledge: see _Hadley v
Baxendale_(1854) 9 Ex 341 _, The Heron II_ [1969] 1 AC 350. As for tortious
liability, the loss is recoverable if it is reasonably foreseeable in the
circumstances: _The Wagon Mound_ [1961] AC 388. However, there is authority
for the view that the difference between the two tests is semantic and not
substantial, especially in situations of concurrent liability: _Parsons v
Uttley Ingam & Co _[1978] QB 791 at 807; _Kienzle v Stringer_ (1981) 130 DLR
(3d) 272 __ at 276.

46\. The crucial question here is whether the loss falls within the
defendant’s reasonable contemplation or is reasonably foreseeable on the part
of the defendant. Speaking generally, in the ordinary course of things, a
nondescript purchaser may be interested in a property because of its potential
or unique characteristics, or because it suits his personal or commercial
requirements. If the purchase becomes abortive, he may, depending on the
circumstances, immediately return to the market to purchase a similar
alternative, or one that is significantly different, or he may not even
purchase a substitute at all. In such a case, a purchaser’s claim for loss of
opportunity consequent on the negligence of the kind in question would be a
claim for loss of investment opportunity. Depending on the circumstances, such
a claim may or may not be too remote.

47\. Turning to the case at hand, we should bear in mind the following. First,
the plaintiffs were a commercial concern carrying on the business of dealing
in electronic goods and articles. They had been carrying on business at the
rented shop unit at Sim Lim Square which is in the vicinity of the property in
question. This must have been known to the defendant. Second, the nature of
the property. This was rent-controlled premises and it must have occurred to
the defendant that the plaintiffs were purchasing it purely for their business
purposes and not for investment. Soon after the conclusion of the contract,
Azam Ali obtained the names of the tenants of the property and this was known
to the defendant. The defendant was clearly aware that the plaintiffs would,
after the completion of the purchase, proceed to apply to the Tenant’s
Compensation Board for recovery of vacant possession of the property: see the
plaintiffs’ letter to the defendant dated 14 October 1993. It is true that
there was no direct evidence that the defendant was subjectively aware of the
plaintiffs’ commercial plans and requirements in purchasing property in the
Jalan Besar area. Nevertheless, given these facts and the plaintiffs’
financial means to buy the property without any borrowings, it was within the
reasonable contemplation of the defendant or would have been reasonably
foreseen by the defendant that, if he had advised the plaintiffs not to
complete the purchase of the property on the ground that the Vendors had no
title to the Property, the plaintiffs would have rescinded the contract and
re-entered the market to purchase an alternative property which fulfilled
their requirements. In our judgment, on the facts of this case, the loss in
question was not too remote, either in contract or in tort, and is thus
recoverable.

48\. Finally, we move to the quantification of this loss. The characterisation
of this loss is similar to the previous head of loss which we have disallowed,
the only difference being the subject property in question. In respect of that
loss, we are concerned with the loss of the property which was purchased under
the contract of sale. The measure applicable is the difference between the
value of the property at the material date and the contract price:
_Stinchcombe v Addison_ (supra). In respect of this loss under consideration,
we are concerned with the hypothetical alternative shop unit in Sim Lim Tower
which the plaintiffs could have purchased had they been properly advised.
According to Azam Ali, the unit which would meet the plaintiffs’ requirements
would be one having an area between 300 and 350 sq ft. For our purpose, we
would take a unit with an area of 325 sq ft. Accordingly, the appropriate
measure of this loss would be the difference between (a) the market value of a
shop a unit in Sim Lim Tower having an area of 325 sq ft at or around the date
of completion, i.e. 15 October 1993, and (b) the market value of such unit as
at the date (‘the material date’) on which they ought reasonably to have
purchased this substitute. In the court below, the plaintiffs’ arguments on
this claim were run along this line.

49\. The question now is what is the material date for the purpose of this
exercise. First, we do not accept the date of the judgment in O S 437 of 1995
as the material date. Next, the defendant suggested the date of 31 January
1994 or in the alternative 12 November 1994. The first was the date on which
Mr Lim of SLB wrote to the defendant informing him that the Vendors had ‘no
power’ to deal with the property and that no interest in the property had
passed to the plaintiffs. We would reject this date, as Mr Lim was acting
primarily for the bank, and no copy of the letter was then given to the
plaintiffs; in effect the plaintiffs never received any definitive advice from
Mr Lim on that issue. The second date, being premised on the letter from the
Vendors’ solicitors dated 12 November 1994 offering to refund to the
plaintiffs ‘all monies paid without interest’, was manifestly unacceptable.
The offer would not really reimburse the plaintiffs for their loss of the
bargain and wasted expenditure. The plaintiffs could not be expected to act on
such an offer.

50\. It seems to us that the reasonable date should be 17 March 1995, being
the date on which the plaintiffs received Mr Dyne’s opinion on the property.
By that date the plaintiffs had received: (a) Mr Lim’s opinion that no title
to the property had passed to them and the bank’s rejection of the property as
security for the loan; (b) P & P’s advice on their lack of a good title to the
property; and (c) Mr Dyne’s opinion which confirmed the earlier legal opinions
that (i) no title to the property had passed to the plaintiffs and (ii) the
court order of 27 August 1993 was a nullity. It was patently clear by that
date that, in the absence of any settlement with the beneficiaries, the
plaintiffs ought to have sought alternative premises. Further, by 17 March
1995, they or their solicitors should have also searched the probate registry
and discovered that the grant de bonis non had already been issued in favour
of Alsagoff, precluding any remedy of the title defect. Accordingly, in our
judgment, the material date to assess the plaintiffs’ loss of opportunity
under this rubric was the 17 March 1995.

_****_

Recovery of the tenant compensation and costs

51\. The question here is whether it was reasonable in the circumstances for
the plaintiffs to have paid the tenants of the property the compensations in
June 1994, when prior to the dates of the payments they had notice of a very
serious defect in the title of the property. On this issue we need to examine
what precisely occurred between the time the plaintiffs completed the purchase
of the property and the time the payments were made.

52\. The plaintiffs completed the purchase on 15 October 1993, and immediately
thereafter initiated an application to the Tenants’ Compensation Board for the
recovery of possession. They instructed their solicitors, P & P, to obtain an
early date for the hearing, as the tenancy of the premises they were then
occupying was due to terminate on 31 July 1994. In consequence, the hearing
was fixed for 25 April 1994. In the meanwhile, Mr Lim of SLB, who had been
instructed to act for both the plaintiffs and the Bank in the proposed
mortgage of the property to secure a loan from the Bank, had made a search on
the property and found that there was a defect in the title. On 31 January
1994, he wrote to the defendant pointing out that the Vendors had ‘no power’
to sell the property and that a grant of letters of administration de bonis
non to the Basalamah estate was essential, and that the deed of assignment of
the property was ineffectual to transfer any interest in the property to the
plaintiffs. The defendant replied on 21 March 1994 setting out the
circumstances leading to the completion of the purchase of the property and
concluding that the sale had been sanctioned by the court order in O S 787 of
1993 and so long as the order remained in effect the title was good. In
response, Mr Lim wrote to the defendant reiterating that the plaintiffs did
not have a good title to the property. It does not appear from the evidence
that at or about that time Mr Lim sent copies of these letters to the
plaintiffs. Most probably, he did not. Before us counsel for the plaintiffs
asserted – and this was not challenged by counsel for the defendant – that
copies of these letters were not sent to the plaintiffs at that time. Sometime
thereafter, Azam Ali enquired with Mr Lim on the position with regard to the
mortgage and the latter informed him that there was a problem with regard to
the title to the property. However, there was no evidence to the effect that
Mr Lim advised the plaintiffs specifically what the problem was. Nor did he
advise the plaintiffs to take any steps in relation to rectifying the defect
in the title or take any steps against the defendant. The reason for this is
obvious. As counsel for the plaintiffs points out, at that time, Mr Lim’s
primary duty was to act for the Bank and, if the parties had gone ahead with
the mortgage, he would represent the plaintiffs as well. It is significant
that after the conversation with Mr Lim, Azam Ali or his co-director, Chow,
raised the matter with the defendant and was assured that the title was good.

53\. P & P also carried out searches on the property. On 30 June 1994, they
wrote to Balan Nair stating that the Vendors were not the administrators of
the Basalamah estate and enquiring whether they had taken any step to obtain
the letters of administration de bonis non so that the defect in the title
could be rectified. Balan Nair very promptly replied on 4 July 1994 stating
that they had closed the file and that they were no longer acting for the
Vendors. On 28 July 1994, P & P wrote to the defendant concerning the same
point. In this instance, they set out the plaintiffs’ position more
positively. They stated that the title to the property had not passed to the
plaintiffs and that the Vendors did not have the power to sell the property to
the plaintiffs, as they were not the administrators of the Basalamah estate,
and they demanded an explanation from the defendant. Here again, it is unclear
from the evidence precisely when P & P carried out the searches on the
property and advised the plaintiffs on the question of their lack of title to
the property. We could only infer that they probably did the searches and
advised the plaintiffs at or near the end of June 1994.

54\. Prior to that date, however, the plaintiffs through P & P had been
conducting negotiations with the tenants of the property as regards payment of
compensation. They reached agreement with one of the tenants on or about 20
April 1994 and with the other tenant on or about 10 May 1994 as regards the
amount to be paid to each of them. From the evidence adduced, it is clear to
us that these agreements were reached before they were fully advised by P & P
as to the defect in their title to the property. By these agreements the
plaintiffs were committed to make the payments and they could not renege from
the agreements with impunity.

55\. The learned judge below said at 85 of his judgment:

> 85\. The claim for the compensation paid to the tenants require greater
> examination. By the time the payments were made in June 1994 the plaintiffs

On the basis of the facts we have examined, this finding is plainly incorrect.
It is true that the plaintiffs made the payments in June 1994, but the
commitments to make the payments were made earlier, when they were not fully
advised that they had no title to the property. On our analysis of the facts,
the chain of causation for this loss sustained by the plaintiffs had not been
broken and the defendant is liable to pay to the plaintiffs the compensations
they had paid to the tenants of the property. For the same reason, he is
liable to pay the plaintiffs the costs they had paid to their solicitors, P &
P, in respect of the application to the Tenants Compensation Board.

_****_

Recovery of costs in O S 437 of 1995

56\. The next issue is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the
defendant their costs incurred in contesting the claim instituted by Syed
Alsagoff in O S 437 of 1995 as a consequential loss occasioned by the
defendant’s negligence. Central to this issue is the question of whether the
plaintiffs had acted reasonably in contesting the claim.

57\. For this purpose, the relevant starting point in time was the end of June
1994. By then, the plaintiffs’ solicitors, P & P, had carried out the
necessary searches on the property and must have advised them that they did
not have good title to the property. This is clearly borne out by the two
letters dated 30 June and 28 July 1994 written by P & P to Balan Nair and the
defendant respectively, and copies of these letters were sent to the
plaintiffs. For the next six months nothing of importance transpired. No
useful step or action appeared to have been taken by the plaintiffs to address
the vital issue of their lack of title to the property. In particular, they
and those advising them did not actively explore the possibility of the
Vendors obtaining the grant of letters of administration de bonis non to the
Basalamah estate. On 27 December 1994, Mr Lim wrote to the plaintiffs
informing them that the Bank would not accept the property as security, unless
the defect in their title to the property was rectified. On this occasion, Mr
Lim enclosed a copy of the letter dated 31 January 1994 which he wrote to the
defendant.

58\. After this, nothing appeared to have been done by the plaintiffs in
seeking to rectify the defect in the title. Another two months elapsed, and
only on 2 March 1995 or thereabouts, did they instruct P & P to consult Mr
Dyne and obtain an opinion on the question of their title to the property. On
17 March 1995, Mr Dyne gave a written opinion which, inter alia, confirmed
what P & P had said, namely: that the plaintiffs had acquired no title to the
property as the Vendors did not have the letters of administration de bonis
non to the Basalamah estate. He specifically dealt with the question of
whether a good title had passed to the plaintiffs. He said at p 14:

> A good legal title in the Property has not passed to the Purchaser
> [plaintiffs]. In fact no title has passed to the Purchaser.

Hence, by the end of March 1995, the plaintiffs definitely knew from three
sources: Mr Lim, P & P and Mr Dyne, that they had no title to the property,
and short of negotiating with the administrator, Syed Alsagoff who had
obtained the grant of letters of administration de bonis non on 16 September
1994, there was no real prospect at all of rectifying their lack of title to
the property.

59\. On 8 May 1995, Syed Alsagoff commenced proceedings in O S 437 of 1995
against the Vendors and the plaintiffs seeking an order to set aside the sale.
With the opinions given by Mr Lim, P & P and Mr Dyne, it must have been clear
to the plaintiffs that they had no real prospect of success in contesting the
claim of Syed Alsagoff. They must have realised that the Vendors, not being
the administrators of the Basalamah estate, had no capacity to convey to them
the property and consequently they had not obtained any title to the property.
It is true that in contesting the claim, the plaintiffs raised the defences of
acquiescence and laches, but, again, it must have been obvious to the
plaintiffs and their advisers that there was no factual basis for maintaining
these defences and that there was no real prospect of success in such
defences. In our judgment, the plaintiffs were highly unrealistic and did not
act reasonably in contesting the claim of Syed Alsagoff in O S 437 of 1995.

60\. It is submitted by counsel for the plaintiffs that they had to contest
the claim, because only with a judgment could they have persuaded the
defendant to accept that the title to the property was bad, given the
respondent’s previous insistence that the title was in order. The short answer
to this is that, in such event, the plaintiffs could have apprised the
defendant of their stand that there was no defence to the claim, and if the
defendant was still insistent that the plaintiffs had a good title to the
property, to offer to the defendant that he should take over the defence in
the name of the plaintiffs and indemnify the plaintiffs against all the costs
incurred.

_****_

Conclusion

61\. We now make the following orders in relation to these two appeals. We
allow the plaintiffs’ appeal, namely, Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1999, to the
extent as follows. We allow the claim of the plaintiffs for the amount of
$54,500 being the total amount of the compensations paid by them to the
tenants of the property and the amount of $5,416.39 being their costs incurred
for applying to the Tenants Compensation Board. We allow the defendant’s
appeal, Civil Appeal No. 195, to this extent. We set aside the order made by
learned judge for assessment of damages and order that damages be assessed by
the registrar on the basis of what we have decided in 48-50 above.

_****_

Costs

62\. We now turn the question of costs. The plaintiffs have succeeded
partially in Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1999, and we award them 50% of the costs
of this appeal. Turning to Civil Appeal No. 195 of 1999, we think that, though
the defendant has succeeded in part, he has not really succeeded on the point
raised in his Case but on the point we raised and brought to counsel’s
attention. We are not disposed to award him any costs. Nor, on the other hand,
should the plaintiffs be allowed the entire costs of this appeal. We award the
plaintiffs 50% of the costs of this appeal. We so order. There will be usual
orders for (a) refund to the plaintiffs or their solicitors of the deposit in
court as security costs in Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1999, with interest, if
any, and (b) payment to the plaintiffs or their solicitors of the deposit in
court as security for costs in Civil Appeal No. 195 of 1999, with interest, if
any, to account of costs.
