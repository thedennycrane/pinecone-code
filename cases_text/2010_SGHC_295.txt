Lee Seiu Kin J:

1 The defendant operated a jewellery shop on premises tenanted from the
plaintiff. The defendant had failed to pay rent and the plaintiff obtained a
writ of distress and seized movable property in the premises. In relation to
576 pieces of jewellery that were seized, the defendant claimed that a third
party, Forever Jewels Pte Ltd (“the Non-Party”) were the true owner. The
defendant had obtained the jewellery on consignment from the Non-Party for
sale in the premises. In Summons No 3916 of 2010 (“Sum 3916/2010”), the Non-
Party applied for the jewellery to be released to them. As there were disputes
of fact, I ordered cross-examination on the affidavits on a date to be fixed.

2 Curiously, the defendant applied in Summons No 3835 of 2010 (“Sum
3835/2010”) for the release of the jewellery to them, even though on their own
case, the defendant were not the owner of the jewellery. I had given the
necessary directions in Sum 3916/2010 for the hearing to determine the Non-
Party’s claim to the jewellery. However in Sum 3835/2010, the defendant
claimed to be entitled to an order for the jewellery be released to them based
on an argument which I would, out of respect, describe as beyond my
comprehension. I did not see how the defendant could be entitled to that
prayer in Sum 3835/2010 and accordingly dismissed it. The defendant, not being
satisfied with my dismissal of their application in Sum 3835/2010, have filed
an appeal.
