**JUDGMENT: (Costs)**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. The general principles upon which the court awards costs are too well
settled to need any repetition. They have been authoritatively laid down by
the Court of Appeal in England in _Re Elgindata Ltd (No. 2)_ [1993] 1 All ER
232 and approved and adopted by this Court in _Tullio v Maoro_ [1994] 2 SLR
489, and restated in _Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew and anor_(in Civil Appeal
Nos. 63-64, 111-112 and 135 of 1997, 3 December 1997, unreported). See also
_Rajabali Jumabhoy & Ors v Ameerali R Jumabhoy and Ors_ [1998] 2 SLR 489.

2\. We turn first to the costs below. The application before the court was ex
parte, but under O 53 r1(3) of the Rules of Court the cause papers were
required to be served, and were served, on the Attorney-Generals Chambers. As
a result of such service, Mr Jeffrey Chan, senior state counsel, appeared on
behalf of the appellant and argued against the orders sought. He was
unsuccessful; but before us he was. Following the general principles, costs
both here and below should follow the event. The question is whether there
were any circumstances which would deprive the appellant of such costs, in
whole or in part.

3\. In the court below, the appellant raised two issues: first, the matters
complained of (assuming they were true) were not susceptible to judicial
review; and secondly, the respondent was out time in her application before
the court. Substantial arguments and time were devoted to both the issues. In
the appeal, the appellant again advanced lengthy submissions in the appellants
case and written skeletal arguments on both the issues. The respondent replied
to the submissions on both the issues in the respondents case. However, at the
hearing before us the appellant abandoned the second issue and argued only on
the first issue. By then, substantial costs had been incurred in disputing
that issue. The appellant must bear part of these costs.

4\. In considering the question of costs, we cannot ignore what we have said
in 7, 8 and 12 of the judgment. Although there were various facts and matters
raised by the respondent which were not admitted, clearly there was no denying
that there were serious breaches of the Instructions Manual on the part of
those concerned which led to the present litigation. In our view, such conduct
is relevant in our consideration of the costs: _Bostock v Ramsey Urban
District Council_ [1900] 2 QB 616, 622; _Donald Campbell And Company Ltd v
Pollak_ [1927] AC 732, 815.

5\. Having regard to these matters which we have considered, we think that a
fair order should be that the appellant be awarded only 50% of the costs of
the appeal and below. We so order.
