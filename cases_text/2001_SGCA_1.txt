(delivering the judgment of the court): On 30 November 2000 this court allowed
the appeal of the appellants where it held that the appellants were entitled
to the protection of the limitation of liability laid down by the Warsaw
Convention, as amended by the Hague Protocol, (amended Convention) in relation
to the loss of a package (one of seven packages) carried by the first
appellant from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. [See [2001] 1 SLR 241.]
However, as requested by the appellants, the question of costs was reserved.
Parties were directed to make their submissions in relation thereto.  
  
**_Offer to settle_**

****

These are the additional material facts, relating to costs, which were brought
to our attention. The writ in this action was instituted on 16 April 1998 and
served on the appellants on 2 October 1998. On 20 January 1999, the appellants
offered to settle the action `for the sum of S$347 including interest, in full
and final settlement of the [respondents`] claim against [the appellants] with
costs, up to and including the service of the notice, to be assessed.` This
offer was not accepted by the respondents and it was never withdrawn by the
appellants.  
  
The appellants say that in view of the fact that as the judgment sum obtained
by the respondents for the loss of the package (based on the limitation of
liability) is not more favourable than the offer to settle, the appellants
should be entitled, pursuant to O 22A r 9(3), to costs for the action and the
appeal, on an indemnity basis from the date of the offer to settle.  
  
**_Relevant provisions_**

****

We will now set out the relevant rules of court:

> _Order 22A r 9(3)_

> _Where an offer to settle is made by a defendant -_

> _
>
> (a) ...
>
> (b) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not
> more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,
>
> _

> _the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the
> offer was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity
> basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise._

> _Order 22A r 12_

> _Without prejudice to Rules 9 and 10, the Court, in exercising its
> discretion with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle,
> the date the offer was made, the terms of the offer and the extent to which
> the plaintiff`s judgment is more favourable than the terms of the offer to
> settle._

  
  
In **The Endurance 1** [1999] 1 SLR 661  this court had the occasion to
consider the rationale and scope of O 22A rr 9 and 12, and having reviewed
some decisions of other jurisdictions (Ontario, Canada and New South Wales,
Australia) where similar procedures existed, said (at pp 679-680):

> _The rationale or the principle behind O 22A is perfectly clear ... it is to
> encourage the termination of litigation by agreement of the parties - more
> speedily and less expensively than by judgment of the court at the end of
> the trial._

> _In our considered view where there is no defence of any substance to a
> liquidated sum, then in line with the principle behind O 22A, compromise is
> not a necessary element in the offer to settle. However, the lack of
> compromise would be a material consideration in determining whether the
> plaintiff or the defendant should be penalised with higher costs in cases
> where there are genuine issues of liability raised. This applies to both
> liquidated and unliquidated claims. In each case an exercise of discretion
> is called for (see O 22A r 9(1) and (2) `... unless the Court orders
> otherwise` and also O 22A r 12)._

> _In our considered view, also, it is axiomatic to the proper application of
> O 22A that the offer to settle should be a serious and a genuine offer and
> not just to entail the payment of costs on an indemnity basis. This is
> particularly so where the claim is for an unliquidated sum to be
> ascertained. In our view an offer to settle for a percentage of an
> unliquidated sum to be ascertained, as the claims in this case for damages
> to be assessed, cannot by any means be said to be a serious and a genuine
> offer to settle. It runs counter to the principle behind O 22A as stated in
> [para ] 43 above. An assessment of damages, even where liability is a matter
> of course, can give rise to numerous complexities and result in protracted
> hearings and expense._

> _What, in our view, is required is for the plaintiff to make his own
> estimate of what the unliquidated sum ought to be or his own assessment of
> what the damages ought to be and to offer that sum as being a fair and
> reasonable sum which the defendant ought to pay in settlement of his claim._

> _We respectfully adopt the words of Morden ACJO in**Data General (Canada)
> Ltd v Molnar System Group** that `the impetus to settle is a mechanism which
> enables a plaintiff to make a serious offer respecting his or her**estimate
> of the value of the claim** which will require the defendant to give early
> ... and careful consideration to the merits of the case`. [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
In a recent Canadian case, **Burton v Global Benefit Plan Consultants Inc**
[1999] 93 ACWS (3d) 223, the court struck out the claim of the plaintiffs
against the fifth defendant and dismissed the action. Prior to the dismissal,
the fifth defendant offered to settle the plaintiffs` claim for $1 `in full
settlement of all costs, damages and interest,` which offer was not accepted.
The question that arose was whether the fifth defendant should be entitled to
only party-and-party costs or solicitors and client costs from the date of the
offer. The court held it was clear that the offer was a nominal offer,
agreeing only to forego any claim for costs up to the date of the offer; it
was an instance where the plaintiffs were asked to capitulate and receive
little, if anything, in return. Orsborn J agreed with the decision of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in **Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molnar System Group**
[1991] 85 DLR (4th) 392, that an element of compromise was not an essential
element to constitute an offer to settle within the rules but the absence of
such an element might be taken into account in deciding whether or not, in any
particular case, the interests of justice and fairness required a departure
from the presumptive solicitor-client costs consequences of the rule. Orsborn
J also, having reviewed some Canadian cases on how the discretion should be
exercised, lamented that they did not demonstrate any predictability. While
recognising that this was unfortunate, he said:

> _but if the interests and fairness and justice demand a different outcome
> than that required by predictability the interests of justice and fairness
> should prevail._

  
  
Thus in this instance, while there was an offer to settle, is it an offer on
which we should allow the prima facie consequences of O 22A r 9(3) to apply or
should we order otherwise. The present action was for the recovery of the loss
suffered by the respondents on account of the package which was not delivered,
the actual value of which was US$286,344.14. However, if the limitation of
liability under the amended Convention were to apply, the appellants`
liability would be limited to S$312. While it is true that at the trial the
appellants did dispute their liability for the loss, that was not the main
issue. It is ludicrous to suggest that any sensible litigant would go through
a trial of some twenty days only to defend a claim for S$312. We think that
the denial of liability was taken for strategic reasons, rightly or wrongly,
in order not to jeopardise in any way their real defence of limitation of
liability. This was obvious from the fact that the appellants offered to
settle in accordance with the limitation laid down in the amended Convention.
The respondents would have known as much.  
  
The present situation is not unlike that in **_Data General_** where the
plaintiffs offered to settle for 100% of the liquidated sum claimed and the
Ontario Court of Appeal of Canada held that due to the complexities of the
case which reasonably gave rise to uncertainties as to liability, it was not
appropriate to allow costs on an indemnity basis.  
  
Similarly in **Tickell v Trifleska Pty Ltd & Anor** [1991] 25 NSWLR 353the
plaintiff made an offer to compromise for 100% of the amount claimed. The
Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia, held that costs on an indemnity
basis should not be awarded to the plaintiffs. The following observations of
Roger CJ are germane:

> _It was never in the minds of the draftsmen of the rule, or members of the
> Rule Committee responsible for the passing of this rule, that Pt 22 should
> be utilized simply as a statutory demand which, other circumstances being
> equal, will automatically entail the payment of costs on an indemnity
> basis._

  
  
Even though the relevant NSW rules are not identical in wording with ours, we
would respectfully agree with those views. In our opinion, for an offer to
have the effect contemplated in O 22A r 9, it must contain in it an element
which would induce or facilitate settlement. When such an element is missing,
then, as held in **_Data General_** , that would be a ground for the court to
exercise its discretion to vary the norm relating to costs laid down in r 9.  
  
In the context of the present case, we had no hesitation in holding that the
offer to settle of 20 January 1999 was not really an offer to settle as it did
not in substance contain any incentive to settle. The crux of the dispute
related to the difference between the actual value of the lost package and the
sum laid down in the amended Convention as being payable to the respondents
for the loss. On that real issue, there was no genuine or serious effort to
seek a compromise.  
  
For these reasons, we would, in exercise of our discretion, order that costs
against the respondents for the action (from the date of the offer), as well
as the appeal, be on the standard basis.  
  
However, the respondents further contend that the appellants should only be
entitled to 60% of the standard costs for both the trial and the appeal, as
the appellants had failed in their defence of denial of liability. Here, we
note that in our main judgment we stated, mistakenly, that the question of
liability was not taken up by the appellants at the trial. Be that as it may,
at the appeal it was certainly not an issue. We could see some merits in this
contention, as far as the trial was concerned. The issue of liability was
taken by the appellants, though perhaps for strategic reasons. Nevertheless,
they should not be given costs on an issue on which they failed. Thus for the
trial we order that the appellants should only be entitled to 80% of the
costs. As for the appeal, no issue on liability was taken. The appellants`
case dealt entirely with the question of limitation of liability under the
amended Convention. Therefore, there will be no reduction of costs for the
appellants as far as the appeal is concerned.  
  
We should add that the appellants have conceded that the respondents should be
entitled to the costs of the action from the institution of the writ up to the
date of the offer on the Subordinate Courts scale (as the sum on which the
respondents succeeded fell well within the Subordinate Courts` jurisdiction),
and we do so order.  
  
**_Certificate for two counsel_**

****

The appellants have also argued for a certificate for two counsel in respect
of the appeal on the ground that `the issues of aviation law with which the
appeal was concerned were complex` and required `specialist knowledge`. The
appellants also contended that the appeal gave rise to questions of general
public importance.  
  
We do not think the nature and the circumstances of the case warrant the issue
of a certificate for two counsel for the appeal. The central issues in the
appeal related to the construction of the relevant provisions of the amended
Convention and the application of the appropriate construction of those
provisions to the facts. In this regard, we concur with the views of Barwick
CJ in **Stanley v Phillips** [1966] 115 CLR 470 where he said:

> _The question is whether the services of more than one counsel are
> reasonable necessary for the adequate presentation of the case._

  
  
We do not think the appeal presented issues of such complexity which required
the services of two counsel. There was nothing very technical. The facts were
all in the record of appeal. Accordingly, we would refuse the request.  
  
**_Refund of payment made with interest_**

****

Finally, an ancillary matter raised by the appellants relates to the repayment
of the payments made by the appellants to the respondents in satisfaction of
the judgment of the court below. The appellants seek the refund of those
payments with interest at 6%.  
  
We are informed by the respondents that they had placed the monies received
(judgment sum plus interest) in an interest bearing account with a reputable
financial institution in Singapore. The respondents are willing to release the
monies received, plus any interest earned and less bank charges incurred.  
  
There does not appear to be any statutory provision which lays down the rate
of interest payable in respect of the return of judgment sum paid pursuant to
a judgment which is reversed on appeal. Order 42 r 12 prescribes a rate of 6%
but that applies only to a judgment debt.  
  
There is, however, high authority which declared that such a return of money
should be with interest. In **Rodger v Comptoir** [1871] LR 3 PC 465 the Privy
Counsel stated:

> _It is contended, on the part of the respondents here, that the principal
> sum being restored to the present petitioners, they have no right to recover
> from them any interest. It is obvious that, if that is so, injury, and very
> grave injury, will be done to the petitioners. They will by reason of an act
> of the court have paid a sum which it is now ascertained was ordered to be
> paid by mistake and wrongfully. They will recover that sum after the lapse
> of a considerable time, but they will recover it without the ordinary fruits
> which are derived from the enjoyment of money. On the other hand, those
> fruits will have been enjoyed, by the person who by mistake and by wrong
> obtained possession of the money under a judgment which has been reversed.
> So far, therefore, as principle is concerned, their Lordships have no doubt
> or hesitation in saying that injustice will be done to the petitioners, and
> that the perfect judicial determination which it must be the object of all
> courts to arrive at will not have been arrived at unless the persons who
> have had their money improperly taken from them have the money restored to
> them, with interest, during the time that the money has been withheld._

> _..._

> _Their Lordships, therefore, so far as any precedents applicable to the case
> are concerned, believe that the precedents will be found to be in favour of
> a restitution of the money with interest. They are quite satisfied, that
> this practice is in accordance with the true principle to be applied to this
> case, and with what the justice of such a case demands ..._

  
  
It will be noted that the governing principle enunciated in **_Rodger_** was
restitution. The principle of restitution was adopted and reiterated by, inter
alia, the Court of Appeal of the State of Victoria, Australia, in **Meerkin v
Rossett Pty Ltd** (Unreported) , where Callaway JA also dealt with the
question of the rate of interest, as follows:

> _Counsel`s alternative submission was that we should prefer the `wider view`
> identified by Fitzgerald P in**Idemitsu Queensland Pty Ltd v Agipcoal
> Australia Pty Ltd** [1966] 1 Qd R 26 in preference to the `narrower view`
> adopted by Brooking J in the **Bond Brewing Holdings** case. The wider view
> is, in substance, that the court should focus on the loss that the appellant
> has sustained by satisfying the judgment. The narrower view is that the
> court should focus on the fruits of the judgment that the respondent has, or
> is presumed to have, enjoyed. Counsel submitted that the authorities to
> which Brooking J referred may be interpreted in a different sense, but I am
> not persuaded that his Honour`s analysis is wrong and I note that,
> notwithstanding the reservation expressed by Davies JA in the **Idemitsu**
> case at p 51 line 49 to 52 line 3, the rest of his Honour`s judgment refers
> exclusively to the position of the respondents. See also **State Bank of New
> South Wales v Commissioner of Taxation** [1995] 62 FCR 371 at p 380-381. An
> appellant court is concerned to do justice to the parties, not solely to the
> appellant. The error was made by the court below, not by the respondent.
> There is no right to compensation as against the respondent not only to
> restitution. If interest measured by the appellant`s loss is awarded, all
> that the court will do is to shift the injustice occasioned by the erroneous
> judgment from the appellant to the respondent._

> _..._

> _The position of the respondent to an appeal is sui generis. It has had the
> benefit of a judgment and the moneys that it has received are its own, but
> there is a risk that the judgment may be set aside. The presumption in
> favour of the judgment and the fact that the moneys belong to the respondent
> favour a higher rate, for the respondent will not be heard to say that it
> did not earn a reasonable rate of return on its own moneys. If it dissipated

> ultracautious, respondent might invest the judgment sum in a series of bank
> bills or term deposits while the appeal is waiting to be called on and
> thereafter at call. The court is concerned with the fruits, or presumed
> fruits, of the judgment rather than the costs of borrowing equivalent funds.
> In my opinion an appellate court should not apply the trustee rate or the
> mercantile rate as such or commercial rates struck for quite different
> purposes. It should apply a rate of interest which, taking all the relevant
> circumstances into account, does justice as between the appellant and the
> respondent to an appeal._

  
  
In our judgment, in order to do justice to both the parties, the court must
focus on restitution from the respondents rather than compensation to the
appellants. Here, the respondents had acted reasonably when they placed the
moneys received with a reputable financial institution earning interests. All
that justice requires is that they should return the sums received, plus
whatever interest earned thereon, to the appellants and we accordingly so
order.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
