Civil Procedure – Appeal – Appeal from the Subordinate Court to the High Court
on taxation of bill of costs – Application of s 21 of the Supreme Court of
Judicature Act (Cap 322)

**

Facts

**

There were two matters before the court. The first was Registrar’s Appeal No
600004 of 2002, which was an appeal by the plaintiffs against a decision made
by a District Judge in chambers that leave to appeal was required, together
with an alternative application for leave to appeal if leave was necessary.
The other was Originating Motion 600011 of 2002, which was the defendant’s
application to strike out the said appeal. Both concerned the scope of section
21 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (‘SCJA’) in appeals
relating to costs.

The background to the present matters was this: pursuant to the conclusion of
a trial in the Subordinate Courts, the trial judge in his capacity as a Deputy
Registrar taxed the bill of costs for the trial. Consequently, after a review
of the taxation, the plaintiffs applied to a District Judge in Chambers (‘DJ’)
for a further review of the decision, which appeal was dismissed on 2 January
2002. On 8 January 2002, the plaintiffs appealed to the High Court against the
latest decision dismissing their review. However, they were directed by the DJ
to seek leave to appeal first as the amount of costs in dispute was less than
the statutory minimum specified in s 21 of the SCJA. The plaintiffs complied
and applied on 9 January 2002 for such leave. On 28 January 2002, the DJ heard
the plaintiffs’ application for leave to appeal. He refused the plaintiffs’
leave. Arising from this, the plaintiffs filed their Registrar’s Appeal on 6
February 2002 and the defendants filed their Originating Motion on 11 February
2002.

The defendants’ arguments that the Registrar’s Appeal should be struck out was
this: Under O 55C r 2 of the Rules of Court, leave to appeal under s 21 of the
SCJA must be obtained by filing an application to the DJ within seven days of
the order, and in the event that leave was refused, by filing an application
with the High Court within seven days of the refusal. What the plaintiffs did
was not to file an application with the High Court within seven days of the
DJ’s refusal, but rather to appeal against his decision, which was filed
outside the seven-day requirement. The matter was therefore before the High
Court through the wrong procedure and was also filed out of time.

As for the plaintiffs’ arguments, they argued that they were appealing against
the DJ’s decision that leave to appeal was necessary, and hence O 55C r 2 did
not apply. Alternatively, the technical irregularity should be disregarded in
the interests of justice as permitted by O 2 r 1.

**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1 Two matters were ordered to be heard together before me. The first was the
Plaintiffs’ Registrar’s Appeal No. 600004 of 2002 ("the RA") which was an
appeal against a decision made by a District Judge in chambers that leave to
appeal was required, together with an alternative application for leave to
appeal if leave was necessary. The other application was the Defendants’
Originating Motion No. 600011 of 2002 ("the OM") to strike out the said
appeal. Both concerned the scope of section 21 of the Supreme Court of
Judicature Act ("SCJA") in appeals relating to costs. Section 21 reads:

> "21(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other written law, an
> appeal shall lie to the High Court from a decision of a District Court or
> Magistrate’s Court in any suit or action for the recovery of immovable
> property or in any civil cause or matter where the amount in dispute or the
> value of the subject-matter exceeds $50,000 or such other amount as may be
> specified by an order made under subsection (3) or with the leave of a
> District Court, a Magistrate’s Court or the High Court if under that
> amount."

2 The RA was an appeal against Ng Peng Hong DJ’s decision:

> "1. finding that leave was necessary to appeal against the award on costs
> made by the learned District Judge (sitting as Deputy Registrar) Zainol
> Abideen, and affirmed by the learned District Judge Ng Peng Hong on 28.1.02;
> and
>
> 2\. refusing to grant leave to appeal against the award on costs made by the
> District Judge (sitting as Deputy Registrar) Zainol Abideen, and affirmed by
> the learned District Judge Ng Peng Hong on 28.1.02;
>
> and accordingly that the appeal be allowed with costs here and below."

3 The OM, filed by the Defendants as Applicants, with the Plaintiffs as
Respondents, sought the following orders:

> "1. The Notice of Appeal to Judge of the High Court in Chambers No. 600004
> of 2002 filed by the Respondents on 6th February 2002 be struck out;
>
> 2\. The costs of and incidental to this application be fixed and paid by the
> Respondents to the Applicants forthwith; and
>
> 3\. Such further order or relief that this Honourable Court deems fit."

_

  
FACTUAL BACKGROUND

_

4 The District Court suit was tried before Zainol Abideen DJ and dismissed at
the conclusion of the four-day trial, with costs to be taxed if not agreed.
The claim was for US$74,773 (or almost S$140,000). The Plaintiffs appealed.

5 Subsequently, the Defendants drew up their bill of costs for the trial. This
was taxed by the trial judge in his capacity as a Deputy Registrar ("the DR")
of the Subordinate Courts. The Defendants claimed $45,000 in Section 1 of the
bill, $1,000 in Section 2 and $53,886.35 as disbursements in Section 3. At
taxation, the DR allowed $39,000, $700 and $53,586.35 respectively. At the
review, the DR reduced the $700 in Section 2 to $500 and ordered the rest of
the taxed amounts to stand.

6 The Plaintiffs applied to a District Judge in Chambers to review the DR’s
decision pursuant to the then Order 59 rule 36. On 2 January 2002, Ng Peng
Hong DJ ("the DJ") heard and dismissed the application with costs fixed at
$800.

7 On 8 January 2002, the Plaintiffs appealed to the High Court against the
DJ’s decision by filing a Notice of Appeal pursuant to Order 55C of the Rules
of Court. However, they were directed by the DJ to seek leave to appeal first
as the amount of costs in dispute was less than the statutory minimum
specified in section 21 SCJA. The Plaintiffs complied and applied on 9 January
2002 by way of summons in chambers for such leave.

8 On 28 January 2002, the DJ heard the Plaintiffs’ application for leave to
appeal. He refused the Plaintiffs such leave. From this, the Plaintiffs filed
the RA on 6 February 2002 and the Defendants filed the OM on 11 February 2002.

_

  
THE ARGUMENTS IN THE HIGH COURT

_

9 In the OM, the Defendants argued that the RA should be struck out. This was
because Order 55C rule 2 provides that leave to appeal under section 21 SCJA
must be obtained by filing an application to the DJ within seven days of the
order and, in the event leave is refused by the DJ, by filing an application
to the High Court within seven days of the refusal. The Plaintiffs sought only
leave to appeal in their application before the DJ, thereby acknowledging that
such leave was required in the circumstances. The DJ made no finding that
leave was required as that was not the subject matter before him. However, the
Defendants accepted that the issue whether leave to appeal was required was
argued before the DJ. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs ought not to have appealed
but should have applied to the High Court for leave to appeal. This should be
by way of Originating Summons within seven days from 28 January 2002 when the
DJ refused them leave, that is, by 4 February 2002. Instead, the application
was filed by way of the RA and only on 6 February 2002. The matter was
therefore before the High Court through the wrong procedure and was also filed
out of time. Reliance was placed on section 50 Interpretation Act and
_**Thomas & Betts (S E Asia) Pte Ltd v Ou Tin Joon & Anor [1998] 1 SLR 913**_.
It was therefore submitted that the High Court had no jurisdiction to hear the
RA.

10 The Plaintiffs contended that the DJ’s decision had two aspects, both of
which they disagreed with. They therefore appealed against both parts of the
decision by way of the RA. The Plaintiffs contended that leave was not
required as the "amount in dispute" relating to the substantive claim in the
District Court action was more than $50,000. This was canvassed before the DJ
who disagreed with them and they could therefore appeal against such a
finding.

11 The Plaintiffs also argued that their application to the High Court for
leave was filed within seven days of 28 January 2002 if time was reckoned in
accordance with Order 3 rule 2 (5), as it rightly should be. The RA was also
an application within the meaning of Order 55C rule 2 and if it was held not
to be, such technical irregularity should be disregarded in the interests of
justice as permitted by Order 2 rule 1. In the circumstances of the case,
leave ought to have been given anyway if such leave was necessary.

12 The Plaintiffs relied on _**Anthony s/o Savarimiuthu v Soh Chuan Tin [1989]
SLR 607, Augustine v Goh Siam Yong [1992] 1 SLR 767 and Abdul Rahman bin
Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed[1999] 4 SLR 716.**_

_

  
THE DECISION OF THE COURT

Should the mode be an OS or an RA ?

_

13 It was plain that in refusing leave to appeal, the DJ was proceeding on the
basis that such leave was necessary. The Plaintiffs could not be said to have
accepted the position that leave was necessary by making the application
before the DJ as they had been directed to do so. The issue was argued before
him at any rate. The ruling that leave was required was not made on 8 January
but on 28 January 2002. As they were appealing against the very foundation of
his ruling, that is, leave was required in the first place, they could do so
by way of the RA. The RA had to be issued within 14 days after the DJ’s
decision [Order 55C rule 1(4)]. That was complied with.

14 The alternative prayer before me that leave should be granted in any case
ought to have proceeded as a separate application pursuant to Order 55C rule
2, as the Defendants contended. However, since no injustice was done on the
facts and the Defendants were not misled as to the nature of the application,
I thought it appropriate that the procedural irregularity should be
overlooked.

_

  
Was the application out of time ?

_

15 The next issue was whether the RA, thus treated as the Plaintiffs’
application for leave if it was ruled that leave was necessary, was filed
within seven days of the refusal by the DJ. In the _**Thomas & Betts**_ case,
the Court of Appeal held that the seven-day period for applying for further
arguments under section 34(1)(c) SCJA must be computed according to section 50
(d) Interpretation Act which provides that "when any act or proceeding is
directed or allowed to be done or taken within any time not exceeding 6 days,
excluded days shall not be reckoned in the computation of the time". This was
notwithstanding the fact that the then Order 56 rule 2, which also prescribed
the period of seven days for making the application for further arguments
under section 34(1)(c) SCJA, if reckoned in accordance with Order 3 rule 2(5)
which provides that "where, apart from this paragraph, the period in question,
being a period of 7 days or less, would include a Saturday, Sunday or public
holiday, that day shall be excluded", would give a different result. The Court
of Appeal held that Order 56 rule 2 had to be read subject to the SCJA.

16 The Interpretation Act applies for the interpretation of the Rules of Court
by virtue of Order 1 rule 3. Section 50 of the Interpretation Act applies in
computing time for the purposes of any written law (which includes subsidiary
legislation such as the Rules of Court) "unless the contrary intention
appears". In the present case, section 21 SCJA makes no mention of the time
period for applying for leave to the DJ or to the High Court. It was accepted
by the Court of Appeal in _**Thomas & Betts **_that if the SCJA is silent as
to time, the period of time for making an application under the SCJA would be
computed in accordance with the Rules of Court. The period of seven days in
Order 55C rule 2 must therefore be reckoned in accordance with Order 3 rule
2(5) and not the Interpretation Act. 28 January 2002 was a Monday. If we
exclude Saturday, 2 February 2002 and Sunday, 3 February 2002 in the
computation, seven days from 28 January 2002 would end on Wednesday, 6
February 2002, which was when the RA was filed. The RA, serving as an
application to the High Court for leave, was thus filed within the stipulated
period of time.  

_

Was leave to appeal required ?

_

17 Was leave to appeal necessary on the facts of this case? The total amount
allowed in the bill of costs was some $93,000, excluding the court fees.
According to the Defendants’ solicitor who filed an affidavit here, the
amounts of costs in dispute were (the Plaintiffs are the Respondents mentioned
below):

> "(a) Section 1 of the bill of costs :-
>

>> The Respondents submitted the sum of $33,750 ($7,500 X 4.5 days). The
amount allowed was $39,000. Therefore, the amount is dispute is $5,250
($39,000 - $33,750).

>
> (b) Section 2 of the bill of costs :-
>

>> Item 270 (Expert’s fees): The Respondents submitted that the sum of
$4,433.41 (25% of $17,733.63) should be taxed off.

>>

>> Item 278 : Amount in dispute is $936.24.

>>

>> Therefore, the total amount in dispute is $10,619.65 ($5,250 + $4,433.41 +
$936.24)."

The reference to "Section 2 of the bill of costs" should actually be to
"Section 3".

18 The starting point is _**Augustine v Goh Siam Yong**_. There the Court of
Appeal held that where a party seeks to appeal to the High Court against a
reduction in the amount of damages assessed, the "amount in dispute" for the
purpose of section 21 SCJA is the difference between the original and the
reduced assessments. In that case, a Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate
Courts assessed damages at $4,780.89 but that was reduced by a District Judge
to $1,177.50. The difference of $3603.39 was held to be the "amount in
dispute" and since it was obviously more than the then prescribed amount of
$2,000 in section 21 SCJA, it was held that the Plaintiff there was entitled
to appeal without leave. It appears that "amount in dispute" was viewed as
synonymous with the "value of the subject matter" in section 21.

19 The above decision was applied by me in _**Abdul Rahman’s**_ case where I
held that the "amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter" in
section 21 did not encompass the non-contractual interest and costs elements
of a claim for a contractual amount or for damages.

20 In _**Pandian Marimuthu v Guan Leong Construction Pte Ltd[2001] 3 SLR
400**_, G P Selvam J held that the "amount in dispute" in section 21 referred
to the amount of the substantive claim (the "cause or matter") and not to the
amount of $5,000 ordered as security for costs. Since the substantive claim
there clearly exceeded $50,000, it was held that leave to appeal against the
order for security for costs was not required.

21 In the case of taxation of bills of costs, the "amount in dispute" is not
the substantive claim in the action, in this case, US$74,773. If it were so,
parties would be able to appeal to the High Court against an award of say $300
costs for a particular item in a bill in any action where the "amount in
dispute" in the substantive claim is above $50,000. This could not have been
the intention of section 21 which confers an unqualified right of appeal only
in cases where the subject matter is worth more than the minimum amount
stipulated. Taxation of costs is the "matter" contemplated in section 21 and
the "amount in dispute" pertains to costs and this must be computed in the way
directed by the Court of Appeal in _**Augustine’s**_ case. It is therefore not
the total amount allowed in the bill of costs that constitutes the "amount in
dispute" in taxation proceedings but the amount calculated in the way that the
Defendants’ solicitor has done above.

22 It was argued by the Plaintiffs here that the paying party at the taxation
proceedings was not obliged to state precisely how much the appropriate award
of costs ought to be ; it was sufficient, they contended, that the paying
party disputed the bill. It could not be said therefore that the "amount in
dispute" here was less than $50,000. I would respectfully disagree with that
contention. A paying party at taxation is required to state its objection to
any item of costs in principle or in quantum or both. The Registrar conducting
taxation proceedings would invariably, and should continue to, ask the parties
what they submit the amounts objected to ought to be. If a range rather than a
specific figure is suggested, the "amount in dispute" would be reckoned on the
basis of the smaller difference between what is submitted and what is awarded.
For instance, a receiving party indicates $80,000 as the amount of costs he
should receive in section 1 of the bill of costs and the paying party submits
the costs should be no more than $25,000 to $30,000. If the Registrar allows
the amount at $70,000, the "amount in dispute" where the paying party is
concerned is $40,000.

23 Following from the above, the "amount in dispute" here was $10,619.65. That
was clearly below the prescribed minimum in section 21 SCJA and leave to
appeal was therefore necessary in this case.

_

  
Should leave to appeal be granted ?

_

24 In _**Abdul Rahman’s**_ case, I summarized the principles on granting leave
to appeal in the following way:

> "31. In my opinion, leave of court to appeal may be granted where the
> applicant is able :
>

>> (1) to demonstrate a _prima facie_ case of error of law that has a bearing
on the decision of the trial court;

>>

>> (2) to show that there is a question of law decided for the first time or a
question of law of importance upon which a decision of a higher tribunal would
be to the public advantage;

>>

>> (3) to show a question of law on which there is a conflict of judicial
authority and a pronouncement from a higher court in the judicial hierarchy is
desirable.

>
> Leave of court should not be granted when there are mere questions of fact
> to be considered."

25 Kan Ting Chiu J in _**Goh Kim Heong and 4 others v AT & J Company Pte Ltd
[2001] 4 SLR 262**_, after referring to the above quoted passage, said:

> "31. I suggest that the value of the proposed appeal and the costs and time
> burdens the appeal would place on the parties and the appellate court should
> also be taken into account."

26 The Plaintiffs’ affidavit filed in the proceedings below stated that leave
should be granted for the following reasons:

> "(a) This case is in respect of a reinsurance dispute which, for the first
> time in Singapore, has proceeded all the way to trial. There are no cases in
> which the costs on such an action have been determined or dealt with by the
> Court before. This case will therefore provide a precedent and guideline to
> future cases on the issue of costs for such cases/disputes.
>
> (b) There is also an important issue in relation to how and to what extent
> expert witnesses’ remuneration and expenses ought to be paid. This is again
> a novel issue in Singapore."

Before me, counsel for the Plaintiffs indicated that if I should decide that
leave to appeal was required, he would not really pursue the argument that
leave ought to have been granted by the DJ.

27 In taxation of costs, the key is reasonableness in principle and in quantum
[see Order 59 rule 27]. The items of costs disputed related to the "getting
up" and fees payable to the expert witness. Even if the substantive claim was
novel, it was not demonstrated to me how the novelty carried over to the
taxation of costs incurred in defending the claim. There did not appear
anything in the bill of costs which warranted the High Court’s intervention in
any respect. Accordingly, I refused the Plaintiffs leave to appeal.

_

  
THE ORDERS

_

28 For the reasons above, I dismissed the OM as well as the RA. Since there
was a legal issue worthy of clarification by the High Court in this matter, I
made no order as to costs in respect of both applications. Any costs ordered
in one would have been set off against those ordered in the other in any
event.

29 I note that with effect from 15 April 2002, the procedure for a review of
taxation by the Registrar no longer exists [see the current Order 59 rules 34
and 35 introduced by S 150 of 2002]. A dissatisfied party after taxation now
proceeds to apply to a High Court Judge (for High Court matters) or a DJ (for
Subordinate Courts matters) to review the taxation.

30 If an amendment to section 21 SCJA should be contemplated in the future, it
might be useful to consider whether or not we should introduce the
qualifications in section 34 SCJA (regulating appeals from the High Court to
the Court of Appeal) to section 21 SCJA. Insofar as the facts here are
concerned, the provision of particular relevance is section 34(2)(b) which
stipulates that no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal where the
