Judith Prakash J:

Introduction

1 This claim arises out of work done in relation to a project awarded by the
Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”) for the reclamation of Jurong Island Phase 4
and Tuas View Extension Option 1-1 (“the project”). The main contractor
appointed for the project by JTC was Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd
(“Hyundai”).

2 In the course of the reclamation work, pre-fabricated vertical drains
(“PVDs”), made from polyester filament wrapped in polyester filters, had to be
installed vertically into the newly reclaimed land. Their function was to
speed up the drainage of underground water and thereby expedite the settlement
of the reclaimed land. The installation of PVDs involved the use of a special
long mast which was mounted on an excavator or crane and which would then push
the PVDs into the soil to the required depth.

3 The plaintiff, Econ Piling Pte Ltd (“Econ”) (formerly known as Econ
Corporation Limited) and the defendant, GTE Construction Pte Ltd (“GTE”)
(formerly known as Dae Yang Geotechnic Pte Ltd) were at all material times
contractors in the business of conducting piling, civil engineering and other
construction works. In 2000, when Hyundai called for tenders for a subcontract
relating to the installation of PVDs for the project, both companies bid for
the same. At the same time, they were in talks with each other about a
possible joint venture to carry out the subcontract works. GTE’s bid was
successful and by a subcontract agreement dated 30 October 2000 (“the
subcontract”), Hyundai appointed GTE as its subcontractor to supply, drive and
install PVDs. Thereafter, on 10 July 2001, Econ and GTE entered into a joint
venture agreement (“the JV Agreement”) whereby they agreed that each of them
would carry out 50% of the works to be done under the subcontract.

4 By October 2002, the parties had completed part of the works with Econ
having met its obligation to complete 50% of the work done to that date. Based
on the work done by Econ, GTE issued payment certificate no. TVE/ECON/2002-8
dated 23 October 2002 (“the payment certificate”) pursuant to which a net sum
of $154,894.92 was paid to Econ. The payment certificate showed that a sum of
$516,077.67 had been retained (“the retention sum”). Econ’s claim in this
action is for payment of the retention sum. GTE has put in a counterclaim for
damages arising out of the alleged failure by Econ, in breach of the JV
Agreement, to carry out any further work on the project after October 2002.

The claim

**The pleadings**

5 This action was started in April 2008. In its statement of claim, Econ
recited the details of the JV Agreement and the payment certificate and then
in para 5 noted that by GTE’s letter of 25 September 2003, GTE had said:

The retention amount shall be claimable to the main con after the main con
hand over the concerned area to the client. A2 area is still on going for
reclamation work not handed over to the client yet. Therefore we are not able
to claim for release of retention to the main con.  
---  
  
6 In para 6 of the statement of claim, Econ pleaded that it was an implied
term of the JV Agreement that GTE was to keep Econ informed and updated on the
status of the retention sum and its release and that it was also an implied
term that GTE would cooperate with Econ in respect of the retention sum. In
the next paragraph, it was pleaded that despite numerous requests and demands
made by Econ, GTE had failed to pay the retention sum to Econ and had failed
and refused to inform Econ whether the works completed by Econ had been handed
over to Hyundai or what the status of the same was.

7 Responding, in para 7 of its defence and counterclaim, GTE admitted that by
October 2002, Econ had performed its obligation of completing 50% of the work
that was done at that date and therefore the payment certificate was issued
pursuant to which a net sum of $154,894.92 was paid to Econ. Then, in para 8,
came GTE’s defence in relation to the retention sum. It read:

8\. Sometime before October 2002, there were rumours that the Plaintiffs were
facing financial difficulties. It was agreed between the parties that a sum of
$516,077.67 be retained by the Defendants as a performance bond to ensure that
the Plaintiffs would continue to honour their obligations under the JV
Agreement.  
---  
  
8 The rest of the defence and counterclaim dealt with GTE’s allegations that
after October 2002, Econ had never resumed any work and had completely
abandoned all of its obligations under the JV Agreement. It averred that as a
result, it had had to undertake the sole burden and cost of performing the
works which was still on-going. In para 11, GTE asserted that it had suffered
loss and damage and had incurred cost and expense in undertaking work that
should have been carried out by Econ. In para 13, GTE pleaded that if it was
liable to Econ, it would seek to set off against such liability the sums due
from Econ arising as damages payable for Econ’s breach of contract.

9 It can be seen from the pleadings that there were only two points raised by
GTE in response to Econ’s claim. The first of these was that the parties had
agreed that the retention sum was to be retained as a performance bond to
ensure performance of Econ’s obligations. The second was that the retention
sum could be set off against the damages that GTE had allegedly sustained by
reason of Econ’s breach of contract. The second point really has to be
considered in the context of the counterclaim rather than the claim so I will
deal with it later. On the defence in its strict sense, therefore, the only
issue that arose was whether Econ had agreed with GTE that the retention sum
was to be held as a performance bond for Econ’s performance of the JV
Agreement.

**The evidence and the arguments**

10 In its closing submissions, GTE contended that the issue was whether Econ
was entitled to the retention sum despite the fact that the work had not been
completed and handed over to Hyundai. It then contended that this issue had to
be resolved in favour of GTE because GTE’s witnesses had said in court that
the work area in relation to which Econ’s claim had been made had not been
handed over to Hyundai and therefore the retention sum was not due for
release. No submissions were made on the allegation that there had been an
agreement to make the retention sum a performance bond. In fact, it would not
have been possible for GTE to make such submissions since neither of its two
witnesses said anything in their affidavits of evidence-in-chief about the
alleged agreement. Further, the alleged agreement was not put to Econ’s
witnesses in cross-examination. It is therefore apparent that this ground of
defence has been abandoned.

11 As I see it therefore, the issue that I have to consider in relation to the
claim is whether it is open to GTE to argue that the claim for the retention
sum is premature. This is because there was no pleading in the defence that
raised this point in response to the claim. It is well established that cases
have to be decided on the basis of their pleadings and if material facts are
not pleaded, they may not be brought forward either in support of a claim or
in defence to it. In this case, the statement of claim set out the basis on
which GTE had in correspondence refused to make payment of the retention sum
in September 2003. The issue of whether the work area in question had been
handed over to Hyundai or not was therefore clearly presented to GTE when it
read the statement of claim. Yet, it did not assert that the position had not
changed from 2003. It did not plead that the retention sum was not due to be
released because the work area had not been handed over to Hyundai. I
therefore hold that GTE cannot put forward a defence to the claim for the
retention sum on this basis.

12 It may be argued that I should allow GTE to make this point since it was
contemplated by the statement of claim. I do not think the reference in the
statement of claim to the original ground for refusing to release the
retention sum is sufficient. Even if, however, I allowed this point to be used
by GTE as a defence, on the evidence, GTE has not been able to establish it.

13 The evidence showed that the first time that GTE informed Econ that the
retention sum was not due and payable because the works had not been handed
over the Hyundai was by its letter of 25 September 2003. GTE repeated this
position in an email dated 17 August 2005. Then, on 20 November 2007 when Econ
asked for payment again, GTE through its solicitors stated:

With regard to the retention sum, your clients are fully aware that the
release of the retention sum shall only be made after the main contractor has
handed over the above-captioned premises to their clients. To date, works on
the above-captioned premises are still in progress.  
---  
  
Econ made further enquiries about the status of the works in the A2 area which
it had been involved in on 3 March 2008, 14 March 2008 and 26 March 2008. GTE
did not respond to any of these queries.

14 GTE’s case was that throughout its communications with Econ, it had
informed the latter that the retention sum in respect of the A2 area had not
yet been released. That may have been the information conveyed, but the truth
of that statement as to the non release of the retention sum was not supported
by the evidence. By 26 April 2006, the total amount of retention money being
held by Hyundai only amounted to $351,654.54. This was a sum quoted in a
letter which GTE wrote to Hyundai on that date and, in that letter, GTE
actually proposed to Hyundai that it should further reduce the retention sum
to 2.5% of the total subcontract sum so that more money could be released to
GTE. It was apparent from this letter that GTE had already received quite a
lot of so called “retention” money. Then, Mr Her Tea Young, the managing
director of GTE who testified on its behalf, conceded in court that Hyundai
had paid out the retention sum to GTE and that GTE was not willing to release
the same to Econ for reasons that had nothing to do with the claim being
premature. The evidence in question reads as follows:

Court: |  What is your reason for not paying the retention money?  
---|---  
Witness: |  In 2004, when Econ went under judicial management, we did not have a contract and also there was no equipment. At that time we had to do the work on behalf of Econ and we had – we were having problem with increased costs and so on. So we did ask Hyundai to release some of the retention money, which they did. So in these circumstances, we were not thinking of releasing this money to Econ.  
Court: |  Yes, what is your justification for not releasing it to them?  
Witness: |  We were thinking that we had – we had our loss incurred because it was like suddenly our joint venture partner disappeared, so there was increased cost which by right we should be sharing together with the joint venture company, which we could not. So if we were working together, this would all come and discuss together with the joint venture company. Since it was like the company was disappeared, I was not thinking of our obligation of releasing this retention.  
Court: |  So are you saying you kept the retention money to offset against your loss?  
Witness: |  Yes, your Honour.  
  
15 In the light of the evidence, it appears that GTE knowingly breached its
obligation to release the retention sum to Econ and that the explanation that
Hyundai had yet to refund the same to GTE was only an afterthought. Indeed, if
the retention sum had not been released by Hyundai to GTE, the latter would
certainly have raised this fact as its first line of defence in its pleadings.
Mr Her the managing director admitted in court that he was aware that it had
not been pleaded in the defence that the retention sum had not been released
by Hyundai. In all the circumstances, therefore, this ground would not have
availed GTE even if it had been pleaded.

16 I therefore find that GTE has no defence to the claim for the release of
the retention sum.

The counterclaim

**Factual background**

17 The basis of the counterclaim was the allegation in para 9 of the defence
and counterclaim that subsequent to the work done as stated in the payment
certificate, Econ had never resumed work and had completely abandoned all its
obligations under the JV Agreement.

18 The factual background to the stoppage of work on the project was that at
about the same time that the payment certificate was issued, reclamation work
came to a complete halt due to a ban in Indonesia on the export of sand. As a
result, both Econ and GTE had to stop work. They, however, left their machines
on the site so as to be able to resume work when sand became available again.
Due to the sand ban, no work was available until October 2003.

19 In the meantime, Econ experienced financial difficulties. Some time in
2003, it was put into interim judicial management. It only emerged from this
position in 2005.

20 In October 2003, some work was available and this was carried out
exclusively by GTE. GTE did not inform Econ at that time of the availability
of work. Its reason, given by Mr Heo Jong Cheol, the former project manager of
GTE, was that the quantity of work available was too little and it would not
have been feasible for both Econ and GTE to carry out the work together.

21 On 27 January 2004, Econ received a letter from GTE requesting it to
mobilise one machine to resume the work at “A3b area” by 1 February 2004. In
that letter, GTE Yang informed Econ that work was available for the
installation of 2 million linear metres of PVD. The letter was forwarded to
Econ’s interim judicial manager, who replied on 13 February 2004 stating that
Econ was able to provide a team of men and a machine for the work.

22 On 16 February 2004, Econ received a reply from GTE dated 20 January 2004,
saying that:

As we mentioned on the above our letter, you were required to mobilize your
one stitcher till 1st Feb 2004. We, Dae Yang, mobilized two machines to meet
the Hyundai’s plan due to your no reply timely and we considered your no reply
as no intention for the work mentioned because of not enough pvd quantity to
operate. _As mentioned earlier, we don’t have a plan to demobilize one of our
machines for your machine operation_ and provisionally the available area for
pvd up to date is about 250,000 linear meters which is able to complete with 3
machines (Dae Yang 2, Econ 1) by 10th of Feb 2004 if you mobilize machine and
manpower to operate as soon as possible. _Please inform us your machine ID and
mobilization plan if you are still keen to operate your team though it is not
enough quantity as said above available to run 3 machines_. [emphasis added]  
---  
  
23 Econ promptly replied the following day, informing GTE once again, of its
willingness to commit a team of men and a machine to the works. In response,
GTE reiterated (by way of letter dated 18 February 2004) that:

We cannot guarantee the balanced pvd quantity for you for the temporary
available area; therefore your earlier mobilization would be helpful for us to
make plan for you.  
---  
  
Thereafter, Econ performed no further works under the subcontract.

**The evidence and the arguments**

24 Before I discuss the submissions, it would be helpful to note the following
salient provisions of cll 4 and 5 of the JV Agreement. These stated:

**4.** |  **The Leading Company [_ie_** **GTE]**  
---|---  
A. |  [GTE] shall act as Leading Company of the JV and will coordinate the performance of the Project.  
B. |  The JV agrees that 5% of the total interim monthly amount (inclusive release of retention) paid by the Main Contractor shall be paid to the Leading Company as fees for administration and management of the JV.  
**5.** |  **PVD Materials and Installation Works**  
A. |  PVD quantity for Econ will be 50% of the whole project quantity.  
B. |  …  
C. |  Econ is required to meet the weekly production target as stated in the schedule by the Main Contractor and agrees hereby to mobilize _ no. of pvd rig for the work. The Leading Company will install pvd on Econ’s share of quantity till Econ delay is caught up by each area planed target if Econ progress lags behind from schedule by more than 10 calendar days.  
D. |  …  
E. |  Econ shall purchase the PVD for their installation works from the Leading Company at the rate of S$0.285/linear meter ex stock. The rate of PVD would be variable due to supplier’s inevitable conditions with crude oil price.  
…. |   
G. |  Both Parties shall give their best effort for the smooth and timely completion of the sub-contract works.  
  
25 Although GTE had pleaded that Econ had completed 50% of the works up to
October 2002, in its final submissions it contended that Econ was not able to
carry out 50% of the works up to this date. It pointed out that GTE had
started work in February 2001 while Econ had only commenced operations on the
project in July 2001. According to its witnesses, at around October 2002,
between Econ and GTE, an aggregate total length of 12,727,695.24m of PVD had
been laid, with GTE accounting for 7,828,043.96m and Econ accounting for
4,899,651.28m, which was less than half. Thereafter, between October 2002 and
June 2007, a further additional length of 1,614,019.44m of PVD had been laid
by GTE in respect of the works.

26 GTE then contended that after October 2002, Econ’s insolvency and entry
into judicial management formed a stumbling block to Econ’s being able to
carry out further work. Whilst it was true that the judicial manager of Econ
had sent letters to GTE appearing to signal Econ’s readiness to start work,
Econ was not in a position to do any further work. The witnesses for Econ had
presented a false picture of hope and ability. Econ had had neither the men
nor the machine to do any further work in 2004. In cross-examination, Econ’s
witness Mr Ong Soon Tee had given the following evidence:

Ct: |  But when they requested you to provide a unit of PVD stitcher, why didn’t you provide it immediately?  
---|---  
Witness: |  During that period, it was on the verge of entering into the IJM, er, so we also have to get instruction from the IJM whether we can go ahead or not to go ahead.  
Ct: |  So you couldn’t accept this request because of your internal problems, is that it?  
Witness: |  Yes.  
  
In GTE’s submission, the above evidence was illuminating with regard to the
reason why Econ had done no further work on the project.

27 GTE submitted that since Econ was not able to complete 50% of the works, it
was in breach of contract and by failing to do the works, it had deprived GTE
of the profit it would have made on the sale of material to Econ and of the
five percent management fee that Econ would have had to pay GTE for Econ’s
portion of the work.

28 Econ refuted the contention that it had completely abandoned its
obligations under the JV Agreement. Its defence to the counterclaim was that
it had not carried out further work due firstly to circumstances beyond its
control and secondly, to GTE’s failure to allot further work to it. It pointed
out that it had had to stop work because the sand ban meant that no further
work could be carried out for at least a year from October 2002. Yet, Econ had
not completely demobilised after October 2002. It had left its machines on
site and also had personnel stationed there. It was charged for water
consumption on the site after October 2002 and also had regular site meetings
with GTE. Further, Mr Heo had admitted during cross-examination that his
statement in his affidavit that there were no Econ employees on site was
incorrect and that until September or October 2003, there had been Econ
workers on the site. He had further agreed that his assertion that after
October 2002 there was no communication from Econ was not correct. In Econ’s
submission, the reason why it had not done any further work when further work
became available was that GTE had not informed it of the same and had kept
this further work for itself. Econ considered that it was GTE rather than Econ
that had been in breach of the JV Agreement since it had failed to allot 50%
of the work to Econ.

29 Econ also submitted that GTE’s letter of 18 February 2004 (see [23] above)
showed that there was a lack of intention on GTE’s part to allocate any of the
works to Econ. Econ had therefore formed the view that it should no longer
incur costs in keeping its machine and manpower on standby. It considered that
it was perfectly entitled to sell off its equipment and remove its staff from
the site. Also, considering that there was a ban on sand exports to Singapore
from Indonesia, Econ assumed that both it and GTE considered themselves as
discharged from further performance of the JV Agreement.

30 Having considered the evidence and the submissions, I find that on a
balance of probabilities, GTE has failed to make out its claim. Econ has
established that its abandonment of the JV Agreement was caused by GTE’s
actions in taking the whole benefit of the subcontract, to the exclusion of
Econ. The conduct of GTE was such as to permit Econ to walk away from the JV
Agreement. This holding is based on the legal principle which was recognised
in _RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd_ [2007] 4 SLR 413 and that
is that where a party, by his words or conduct, simply renounces his contract
inasmuch as he clearly conveys to the other party to the contract that he will
not perform his contractual obligations at all, that the other party is
entitled to terminate the contract. Further recognition of the principle can
be found in the following passage of _Chitty_ on Contracts, vol 1 (Sweet &
Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (at 24-018):

… An absolute refusal by one party to perform his side of the contract will
entitle the other party to treat himself as discharged, as will also a clear
and unambiguous assertion by one party that he will be unable to perform when
the time for performance should arrive. Short of such an express refusal or
declaration, however, the test is to ascertain whether the action or actions
of the party in default are such as to lead a reasonable person to conclude
that he no longer intends to be bound by its provisions. The renunciation is
then evidenced by conduct. …  
---  
  
31 The evidence established that GTE had demonstrated its intention not to be
bound by the JV Agreement. First, when GTE had some new work in October 2003,
GTE did not inform Econ. As Mr Heo conceded during cross-examination:

Q: |  … And I am focusing on 2003 October, just a few days after DB94[sic], showing that the defendant had carried out work of some 188,000 linear meters.  
---|---  
A: |  That is correct.  
Q: |  Why wasn’t this shared with the plaintiff?  
A: |  As I remember, I have advised this to the plaintiff in the meeting.  
Court: |  Advised what to the plaintiff in the meeting?  
Witness: |  I advised that next month there is some work to be carried out.  
Court: |  When was this advice given?  
Witness: |  Some time in September, I remember, your Honour.  
… |   
Court: |  If you told them in September, why didn’t you mention it in your letter of the 25th of September?  
Witness: |  Though I remember, I discussed with the persons in – in site. This was a relatively small amount of work. That – that’s probably why I didn’t mention in this letter.  
Court: |  In this letter you say that: “We will inform you when you get the plan from the main con. We are keeping under observation for resumption of work.” So this letter is saying that there’s no work.  
Witness: |  I cannot remember exactly, but perhaps it was a very urgent requirement of work that we didn’t have time to discuss any further. One reason that it was not possible to keep it in secret is that there were Econ personnel always staying at the project site.  
  
32 That passage casts doubt on the reliability of Mr Heo’s evidence that he
had informed Econ that some new work would be forthcoming. It would be noted
that he changed his position when his testimony was probed. Furthermore, the
fact that GTE deliberately excluded Econ from the benefit of the subcontract
can also be inferred from his answer to a subsequent question:

Court: |  … In your letter, when you say there’s --- there’s no work, right, if they could have seen that there was, you were getting ready for work, they would have known you were telling a lie. Isn’t that correct?  
---|---  
Witness: |  The work I was referring to in this letter, your Honour, is something of significance, something that we could carry on for several months at least. The type of work that just do as a small project wouldn’t do any good for us or the plaintiff company anyway.  
  
33 Even if the quantity of work was so little that it would not have been
profitable for both parties to the JV Agreement to participate in, the
availability of such work should at least have been mentioned in the 25
September 2003 letter to Econ. This was because GTE, as Econ’s joint venture
partner, was bound to co-operate in the equal discharge of the subcontracted
work pursuant to cl 5E. Since under cl 5A, the PVD quantity for Econ was 50%
of the total quantity to be installed, GTE should at least have obtained
Econ’s consent to allow GTE to proceed with the allegedly small quantity of
works without Econ’s participation. Instead, in its 25 September 2003 letter,
GTE informed Econ that there was no compensation for idling machines and that
it would let Econ know later when it received the plan for resumption of work
from Hyundai.

34 Admittedly, GTE wrote to Econ on 20 January 2004 requesting that Econ
mobilise its machinery and manpower for work to be done on 1 February 2004.
This letter, however, was only received by Econ on 27 January 2004 and as it
needed one week to mobilise the necessary machinery, it was not able to start
work on 1 February 2004. At that stage, GTE appeared to be willing to give
more work to Econ but its subsequent conduct showed that this was not in fact
the case.

35 By the time Econ was ready to perform the work, GTE’s refusal to demobilize
one of their two machines on the work site to accommodate Econ showed that GTE
was not actually interested in allowing Econ to come on site to participate in
the work. GTE relied on the following evidence from Mdm Ong of Econ to show
that it was to blame for not participating in work from February onwards:

Ct: |  But when they requested you to provide a unit of PVD stitcher, why didn’t you provide it immediately?  
---|---  
Witness: |  During that period, it was on the verge of entering into the IJM, er so we also have to get instruction from the IJM whether we can go ahead or not to go ahead.  
Ct: |  So you couldn’t accept this request because of your internal problems, is that it?  
Witness: |  Yes.  
  
That evidence was not, however, as damaging for Econ as it might seem to be at
first sight. Econ was under judicial management in January 2004 and therefore
it could not act without the approval of the judicial manager. All that the
answer said was that no machine could be provided immediately because the
approval of the judicial manager was required. The answer did not say that no
machine could be provided at all.

36 As the later correspondence of February 2004 showed, after considering the
matter, the judicial manager approved the resumption of work and Econ informed
GTE that it was able to provide personnel and machinery and asked for the
schedule of work. That offer was rejected by a letter from GTE (mistakenly
dated 20 January 2004) which was received by Econ on 16 February 2004
informing Econ that it would not demobilise one of its machines to allow
Econ’s machine to operate and that the work available was not sufficient for
the use of three machines. Then, on 17 February 2004, Econ reconfirmed its
ability to provide men and machinery to do the work. GTE’s response to that
was that it could not guarantee the quantity of work available. Thereafter,
GTE did not give Econ any further work to do. In these circumstances, it was
not realistic to expect Econ to remain on standby, incurring costs, while GTE
was denying Econ the opportunity to perform its side of the bargain. In the
event, GTE went on to do work to the exclusion of Econ during the months from
February 2004 to June 2004. As Mr Heo stated in cross-examination, there was
not enough work to share with Econ in 2004. This, and not Econ’s abandonment
of the JV Agreement, must have been the true reason why only GTE was at work
in 2004.

37 GTE’s assertion that Econ’s staff simply became uncontactable after they
had decided to abandon the JV Agreement in October 2002 was not true. Econ
maintained a mechanic on the work site until its machines were sold in
September 2004. Further, it can hardly be said that Econ could not be
contacted. On 26 May 2003, Econ wrote to GTE to inform the latter that Econ’s
staff member in charge of the project was staying at the camp site. On 4 June
2003, Econ again wrote to GTE, this time agreeing to pay the fees due for
consumption of water and the anti-mosquito service provided. It also confirmed
that invoices issued after May 2003 would not “fall under Econ’s Scheme of
Arrangement”. In fact, during cross-examination, Mr Heo conceded that Econ’s
employees were contactable, and that his assertion that Econ’s staff were not
present on the work site was untrue.

38 In light of the above, GTE’s counterclaim was a mere afterthought. Even
after the original management of Econ took over again in 2005 when Econ
emerged from interim judicial management, GTE never saw it fit to raise the
matter of Econ’s alleged repudiatory breach. GTE simply acquiesced in Econ’s
moving its equipment out of the site. Also, whilst GTE had alleged that Econ’s
non-performance after October 2002 had caused it loss because it had to take
on the burdens of the subcontract alone, Mr Heo agreed in cross-examination
that in 2004, there was no point in asking Econ to do the work or suing Econ
to enforce specific performance because there was not enough work in 2004 to
share with Econ. Later, when Mr Heo was asked whether he had taken the view
that Econ had breached the JV Agreement because it was under judicial
management and its machines had been sold in September 2004, his reply was: “I
wasn’t thinking that way”.

39 I am satisfied on the evidence that GTE had renounced the JV Agreement by
deliberately excluding Econ from the benefit of the same and therefore that
its counterclaim against Econ must fail. There is no basis therefore on which
GTE can claim to exercise any right of set off against the retention sum. It
is also worth noting that in April 2006, GTE, without consulting Econ,
extended the subcontract with Hyundai. In this connection, I asked Mr Heo
whether if he chose to extend the subcontract after April 2006 (there was no
work at all done in 2005) he could really hold Econ liable for any extra
expense that GTE had incurred after that date. The witness did not answer the
question directly. All he said was that GTE had been supposed to advise Econ
of the extension since it was a joint venture party but GTE had not known who
to contact at that time. This was a weak response since by 2006, Econ was no
longer in interim judicial management and GTE could easily have tracked down
the management of the company. I am satisfied that if GTE did in fact incur
extra expense after February 2004 this was due to its own actions for which
Econ cannot be held responsible.

Conclusion

40 In the result, the plaintiff’s claim succeeds and there will be judgment
for Econ in the sum of $516,077.67 together with interest thereon at the court
rate from the date of the writ to the date of payment. The defendant’s
counterclaim is dismissed and GTE shall pay Econ the costs of the action and
of defending the counterclaim as taxed or agreed.
