1 February 2019 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 This is an application by the first and second defendants to strike out the
plaintiff’s action on the grounds that there is an abuse of the process of the
court by the plaintiff, denying the defendants a fair trial, and that the
conduct of the plaintiff was so contumelious that it is sufficient to strike
out its action. This application to strike out arose from a single event that
the applicant here, supported by the intervener, regard as a major catastrophe
in the litigation in Singapore.

2 The action in this suit is part of a wider legal action by the plaintiff
against the defendants and Group Lease Public Company Limited, a public listed
company in Thailand, in which the plaintiff had invested much money. Many
other actions are ongoing in various jurisdictions including Luxembourg, the
British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Cambodia.

3 There are seven defendants in the Singapore action. The second defendant is
alleged to be the individual behind the third to seventh defendant companies
connected to the first defendant, and all defendants are being sued for
conspiracy to defraud. This action is scheduled for trial this September, but
now, the first and second defendants allege that sometime from May to June
2018, the third defendant was acquired by the plaintiff and is now its puppet.
Prior to the takeover, the third defendant was represented by Mr Pradeep
Pillai (“Mr Pradeep”) from PRP Law LLC, who now appears as counsel for one
Yoichi Kuga (“Kuga”).

4 Kuga claims to be the beneficial owner of Pacific Opportunities Holdings
S.A.R.L (“POH”), a company incorporated in Luxembourg, as one Tep Rithivit
(“Tep”) agreed to hold Kuga’s shares in POH on trust for him. The third
defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of POH. Consequently, Kuga also claims
to be the beneficial owner of the third defendant. Kuga alleges that Tep, in
breach of trust wrongfully transferred the shares in POH to Saronic Holdings
Limited (“Saronic”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong. Kuga is suing Tep in
Luxembourg and the matter has not been resolved.

5 The direct consequences of the transfer in ownership of the third defendant
are that Mr Pradeep had been discharged as its counsel, and another firm,
WongPartnership LLP, had taken over as the solicitors for the third defendant.
Saronic removed the existing directors of the third defendant, appointed
itself as corporate director, and appointed three new directors, including one
Mr Hopkins. Mr Hopkins is the sole shareholder and director of Saronic. Both
the plaintiff and Kuga claims that Mr Hopkins is acting against the interests
of the third defendant because he has been feeding the plaintiff with
information and documents he had obtained in his capacity as director of the
third defendant. It is not known what role Mr Hopkins plays in the main
action.

6 With the third defendant now seemingly the fifth column in the defendant
bloc, not only has its unity been broken, but serious damage is being done
because the third defendant is now not only acting against its own interests,
it is also acting against the interests of its co-defendants.

7 Mr Chan Leng Sun, SC, counsel for the plaintiff, argues that Mr Hopkins is
an independent director and that if he believed that the third defendant had
not conducted its business properly, or has not complied with any order of the
court, he is entitled to correct the company’s errors. This includes the duty
to correct any misstatements or misleading affidavits previously filed by the
third defendant, and telling the plaintiff that it (the third defendant) had
given wrong information to the plaintiff in the past.

8 Mr Edric Pan, counsel for the second defendant, and Mr Pradeep argued that
the recent events had prejudiced the defence of the other defendants. Mr
Pradeep invites the court to make a finding of fact that the plaintiff
controls the third defendant, and that the plaintiff’s pretence of treating
the third defendant as an adversary when they are actually in cahoots justify
the striking out application. Mr Pradeep also relied on ANB v ANC [2015] 5 SLR
522 (“ANB v ANC”) in support of his argument that the plaintiff and the third
defendant had acted contumeliously by having the third defendant
surreptitiously turned over to the control of the plaintiff.

9 I need only say that ANB v ANC does not apply in this case. That case dealt
with a clear finding of fact of contumelious conduct, where the respondent
broke into the appellant’s house to obtain evidence found on the appellant’s
personal notebook computer. Nothing by way of the affidavits in this case
satisfied me, at this stage, that the plaintiff and the third defendant had
acted contumeliously. All the allegations made against them may turn out to be
true and it seems to me that there is a great deal more to learn about the
facts of this case. We are presently only skimming the surface.

10 The evidence has yet to be tested. If there were a fraud or conspiracy, it
is yet to be determined who the villain is. It may be the plaintiff, or the
individuals behind it, or Mr Kuga and Mr Mitsuji Konoshita, or some other.
More importantly, with so many actions around the world, it is not yet clear
where the mother lode is. It could be in Singapore, in relation to the
plaintiff’s claim under the tort of conspiracy, or in Luxembourg, where the
beneficial owner of the third defendant will be determined. The rest are
placer mining. Hence, the first and second defendants and Kuga may be right in
the end, but only a full trial will determine whether they or the plaintiff’s
position is true.

11 I am therefore of the opinion that the plaintiff’s action cannot be struck
out on the grounds that Mr Edric Pan and Mr Pradeep claim. This application is
therefore dismissed with costs reserved to the trial judge.
