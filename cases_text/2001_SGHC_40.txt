Banking – Performance bonds – Call on bond – Whether bondsman seeking to
resist call has recourse to underlying contract between employer and
contractor where contractor not party to suit  
  

: This is an unusual case in which the bondsman, an insurance company, sought
to resist a call on the performance bond issued by it. The plaintiff employed
TDS Construction Pte Ltd (`TDS`) (by a contract dated 9 September 1997) to
construct and build three houses at Robin Road. Pursuant to the contract
between them TDS procured a performance bond issued by the defendant in the
plaintiff`s favour. The relevant provisions of the (undated) bond provide as
follows:

> _
>
> 1 In consideration of [the plaintiff] not insisting on [TDS] paying
> Singapore Dollars Two Hundred and Five Thousand only (S$205,000) as a
> security deposit for the Contract, we hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
> undertake, covenant and firmly bind ourselves to pay you on demand any sum
> or sums which from time to time be demanded by you up to a maximum aggregate
> of Singapore Dollars Two Hundred and Five Thousand only (S$205,000) (`the
> said sum`).
>
> 2 Should you notify us in writing, at any time prior to the expiry of this
> Bond, by notice purporting to be signed for and on behalf that you require
> payment to be made for the whole or any part of the said sum, we irrevocably
> and unconditionally agree to pay the same to you immediately on demand
> without further reference to [TDS] and notwithstanding any dispute or
> difference which may have arisen under the Contract or any instruction which
> may be given to us by [TDS] not to pay the same.
>
> _

  
  
The said bond expired on 31 December 1999. The plaintiff called upon the bond
through her solicitor`s letter dated 25 October 1999. The defendant failed to
pay and the plaintiff commenced action against it on 19 November 1999. There
is no evidence that the contractor or the defendant had offered to extend the
period of the bond. The plaintiff obtained summary judgment on 29 February
2000. District Judge Tan Puay Boon dismissed the defendant`s appeal on 8 May
2000. The defendant appealed against that decision to the High Court and the
appeal came before me.  
  
Miss Koh argued on behalf of the defendant that there are triable issues for
the matter to proceed to trial. Essentially, the defendant`s case was that the
plaintiff`s call on the bond was not made in good faith, and that it was
therefore fraudulently or unconscionably made. Counsel argued that the
plaintiff owed TDS a sum of $420,976.53. This was the amount which TDS has
submitted to the Official Receiver as a debt owing to them by the plaintiff.
TDS had agreed to $102,500 as the retention sum in the construction contract.
The plaintiff, on the other hand is claiming liquidated damages for 155 days
at $2,500 a day, amounting to $387,500; $133,797 as damages for rectification
of defective work; and $22,000 being consultant fees payable in respect of the
calling of a fresh tender. There is no doubt that there was a dispute between
the plaintiff and TDS over these moneys. It is also obvious that that dispute
can only be resolved at trial. The problem here is that these present
proceedings do not involve TDS. This was an action taken by the plaintiff
against the bondsman.  
  
Miss Koh submitted that the bondsman is entitled to refer this court to the
underlying contract between the employer and the contractor in order to
uncover the fraud and unconscionable conduct that the defendant bondsman is
relying on. Counsel cited **GHL v Unitrack Building Construction** [1999] 4
SLR 604  (among several other cases) as the authority for laying down the
principles for judicial intervention when a performance bond is being called
upon, and in her submission, the present facts fall within those principles.  
  
The authorities cited, are clearly binding on this court if the facts and
issues in dispute here are similar to those in the cases cited. With respect,
however, the present case is significantly different. In this case, the
contractor is not a party to the suit. The foremost question therefore, is
whether the bondsman is entitled to refer to the underlying contract and the
alleged unconscionable conduct on the part of the plaintiff in these
circumstances. I agree entirely with the district judge, that the defendant as
bondsman has no recourse to the underlying contract between the employer and
the contractor. The judge held at p 6 of his judgment that:

> _... the bondsman is a stranger to the underlying contract, and the rights
> and liabilities inter se between him and the beneficiary under the
> performance bond are governed entirely by the terms of that instrument. So
> long as the conditions for calling on the bond are met, the bondsman has to
> pay. As between him and the beneficiary, there is no reason to postpone the
> realisation of the security, as there is nothing between them which requires
> investigation. His recourse after paying the beneficiary is to the party who
> procured the issue of the bond._

  
  
In the usual case, the contractor would be the party seeking an injunction
against the employer from calling on the bond. In that context, the reference
to the underlying contract would be the contract of employment, that is, the
contract underlying the issue of the bond. The reference to the underlying
contract in this instance is misleading. The only relevant contract is that
made between the plaintiff and the defendant bondsman wherein in consideration
of the plaintiff not seeking a security deposit from the contractor (TDS), the
defendant warrant that it will pay the plaintiff the bond amount upon demand
without question. I think that this is the only conclusion one can reach if
any meaning is to be given to the defendant`s contractual declaration that it
had `hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake, covenant and firmly
bind ourselves to pay you on demand any sum or sums which from time to time be
demanded by you ... without further reference to the contractor and
notwithstanding any dispute or difference which may have arisen under the
contract or any instruction by the contractor not to pay`. Miss Koh submitted
that the contractor had been wound up. But that does not prevent the Official
Receiver from pursuing the cause.  
  
The defendant was somewhat harshly described by the district judge as `a
lightning rod in attracting controversies in the bonds in which they have
issued, having featured in at least two cases, **GHL v Unitrack Building
Construction** [1999] 4 SLR 604  and **Raymond Construction v Low Yang Tong**
(Unreported) , where payments under the bonds they issued were restrained`.
The circumstances in this case are different, but nonetheless there is no
merit, in my view, in the defence they sought to raise. They had contracted to
pay upon demand irrespective of any dispute between the plaintiff and TDS, and
they must do so. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
