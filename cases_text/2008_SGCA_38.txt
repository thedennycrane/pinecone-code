V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):

Introduction

1 This appeal raised for consideration some important procedural issues
relating to the appropriate legal tests to be applied in assessing whether to
set aside a default judgment. It also posed squarely for determination the
relevance of a delay in making an application to set aside such a judgment
(referred to hereafter as a “setting-aside application”).

2 The respondent, Canberra Development Pte Ltd (“Canberra”), owns Sun Plaza, a
shopping mall at No 30 Sembawang Drive. The appellant, Mercurine Pte Ltd
(“Mercurine”), claims to be the tenant of units #04-01 and #05-01 at Sun Plaza
(“the Premises”), where it operates a six-screen cinema complex and
concessionaire stands. Canberra is Mercurine’s direct landlord in respect of
the Premises.

3 Canberra commenced Suit No 861 of 2005 (“Suit 861”) on 30 November 2005
claiming unpaid rent and vacant possession of the Premises. The writ was
served on Mercurine on 1 December 2005. When Mercurine failed to enter an
appearance by the deadline of 9 December 2005, Canberra entered default
judgment against it on 9 January 2006 (“the Default Judgment”). Some fifteen
months later, on 26 April 2007, Mercurine applied, via Summons No 1843 of 2007
(“SUM 1843”), to set aside the Default Judgment. This application was granted
by Assistant Registrar Lim Jian Yi (“AR Lim”) (see _Canberra Development Pte
Ltd v Mercurine Pte Ltd_ [2007] SGHC 107 (“the AR’s Judgment”)), but his
decision was subsequently reversed by a judge (“the Judge”) in _Canberra
Development Pte Ltd v Mercurine Pte Ltd_ [2008] 1 SLR 316 (“the Judge’s
Judgment”) following Canberra’s appeal. Mercurine then appealed to this court
against the Judge’s order reinstating the Default Judgment.

4 This court was asked to determine whether Mercurine was entitled to set
aside the Default Judgment, taking into consideration:

(a) the regularity or otherwise of the Default Judgment;

(b) the merits of Mercurine’s defence; and

(c) the reason for the long lapse of time between the entry of the Default
Judgment and the filing of SUM 1843.

We were initially minded to allow the appeal in full. However, as two separate
writ actions commenced by Mercurine against Canberra in connection with an
inter-related dispute had already been set down for trial (see [15]–[16]
below), the logical result – as we shall explain – was to make the setting
aside of the Default Judgment contingent upon the outcome of the writ actions
– _ie_ , if Mercurine succeeds in those proceedings, the Default Judgment will
be deemed to be set aside. We thus varied the Judge’s orders rather than
simply set aside the Default Judgment (see further [22] below). Before we give
our reasons for this, we will first summarise the salient facts. We also set
out below the outline of these grounds of decision so as to give an overview
of the approach which we adopted in considering this appeal.

**The facts**

**The parties**

5 Mercurine and Canberra are both joint venture entities. As a result of the
linkages between their joint venture partners, there are two common ultimate
shareholders in the corporate structures of both Mercurine and Canberra, _viz_
, Koh Brothers Group Limited (“Koh Brothers”) and Heeton Holdings Limited
(“HH”). Mercurine is the corporate vehicle for the joint venture between Eng
Wah Organization Ltd (“Eng Wah”), Koh Brothers and HH. EWO Entertainment
Concepts Pte Ltd (“EWO”) and Clareville Investments Pte Ltd (“Clareville”)
each have a 50% shareholding in Mercurine. EWO’s holding company is Eng Wah
Investments Pte Ltd, which is in turn wholly-owned by Eng Wah. Fifty per cent
of Clareville is held by Batam Vision Pte Ltd, whose ultimate shareholder is
Koh Brothers; the other 50% is held by Heeton Land Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of HH. As for Canberra, it is a joint venture between Koh Brothers
Development Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koh Brothers, and HH.
Broadly speaking, Mercurine can be identified with Eng Wah, and Canberra, with
Koh Brothers.

**The dispute**

6 Mercurine took possession of the Premises on or about 25 February 2000. To
date, no written agreement for the lease of the Premises (“the Lease”) has
been executed between the parties. Disagreements arose over the term of the
Lease, with Mercurine contending that the Lease was valid for 14 years as
stated in Canberra’s letter of offer dated 4 November 1999. Canberra, on the
other hand, asserted that, in subsequent discussions, the term of the Lease
was reduced to seven years, with an option to renew for a further seven years
upon Mercurine making a written request within a stipulated time. Since
Mercurine did not meet this requirement, Canberra claimed, the Lease had
expired. While the issue of the actual term of the Lease was not crucial to
the outcome of this appeal, it was nevertheless of some relevance because the
alleged expiry of the Lease was one of the grounds upon which Canberra staked
its right to vacant possession of the Premises.

7 Between April 2003 and November 2005, Mercurine did not pay the contractual
monthly rent for the Premises. This alleged breach of the Lease was the
foundation of Suit 861. Mercurine’s explanation for its non-payment of rent
was that Canberra was frequently late in carrying out its obligation to
reimburse Mercurine’s air-conditioning charges as earlier agreed. In her
affidavit filed on 26 April 2007 in respect of Suit 861 (“Ms Goh’s Suit 861
affidavit”), Ms Goh Min Yen (“Ms Goh”), a director of Mercurine, averred that,
as at June 2005, Canberra owed Mercurine $297,287.97 in air-conditioning
reimbursement. Ms Goh also claimed that Canberra had failed to purchase
annually the agreed number of movie gift vouchers (“MGVs”) from Mercurine.
This shortfall amounted to 18,390 MGVs for the years 2000–2004. Further,
Canberra had not purchased any MGVs since the beginning of 2005.

8 The parties met on or about 18 November 2003 in an attempt to resolve their
differences. Mercurine claimed that an agreement was reached whereby the air-
conditioning charges and the purchase cost of the MGVs that Canberra was
supposed to bear would be set off against Mercurine’s accrued rental arrears
(“the Set-Off Agreement”). Mercurine further alleged that during a subsequent
meeting on 2 March 2004, the parties affirmed the Set-Off Agreement, and it
was further agreed that Mercurine would make good the shortfall in rent
_after_ it received an additional injection of funds from its shareholders
(“the Pay Later Agreement”). Canberra, needless to say, denied the existence
of the Pay Later Agreement.

**Suit 861**

_Canberra's claim_

9 In Suit 861, Canberra claimed rental arrears in the amount of $1,005,916.81
for the period from April 2003 to November 2005. Canberra also sought
possession of the Premises on the grounds that Mercurine, by failing to
execute the engrossed lease agreement sent to it on 2 August 2000 within the
stipulated 21-day period and failing to pay rent for the Premises as it fell
due, had evinced an intention to repudiate the Lease, which repudiation
Canberra had accepted.

10 As stated earlier (at [3] above), Mercurine did not enter an appearance and
the Default Judgment was duly entered against it on 9 January 2006. Pursuant
to the Default Judgment, Mercurine was ordered to:

(a) deliver possession of the Premises to Canberra (“the Possession Order”);

(b) pay the outstanding rental balance of $864,388.31 to Canberra (“the Money
Judgment”); and

(c) pay damages to be assessed, interest and costs of $4,524 to Canberra.

It should be noted that although Canberra had initially pleaded rental arrears
of $1,005,916.81 in its statement of claim for Suit 861, the Money Judgment
was for the sum of $864,388.31 only in view of a payment made by Mercurine
towards rent on 11 November 2005.

_Communications between the parties after the entry of the Default Judgment_

11 According to Ms Goh’s Suit 861 affidavit, Mercurine learnt of the Default
Judgment only on 16 January 2006 when Eng Wah’s investment consultant, Mr Oh
Chee Eng (“Mr Oh”), attended a pre-trial conference in respect of Suit 861 on
Mercurine’s behalf. That same day, Mr Oh allegedly told Canberra’s director,
Mr Koh Keng Siang (“Mr Koh”), that, if Canberra did not withdraw the Default
Judgment, Mercurine would have to contest the judgment. If that happened, Koh
Brothers and HH would have to bear 50% of Mercurine’s legal costs. Ms Goh
deposed that Mr Koh had informed Mr Oh that he would instruct Canberra’s
lawyers to “hold”[note: 1] the Default Judgment pending the parties’ efforts
to resolve the matter. Mr Koh’s version of the events, on the other hand, was
that he had told Mr Oh that he would instruct Canberra’s lawyers to withhold
execution proceedings, but had not promised that this would be for an
indefinite period.

12 Mercurine asserted that the parties arrived at a compromise agreement (“the
Compromise Agreement”) sometime in or around January or February 2006 whereby
Canberra would withdraw the Default Judgment if Mercurine paid it the sum of
$519,155.62. Yet, Mercurine subsequently received a letter from Canberra dated
17 April 2006 conveying the latter’s offer to withhold execution of the
Default Judgment and to accept the aggregate sum of $535,124.93 (comprising
$518,998.12 plus interest of $11,602.81 and legal fees of $4,524) “in full
satisfaction of the Orders in the [Default] Judgment obliging [Mercurine] to
pay [Canberra] the balance sum of S$864,388.31”.[note: 2]

13 Ms Goh replied on 28 April 2006 stating that Mercurine would pay the sum of
$518,998.12 if the Default Judgment was duly withdrawn upon payment and the
tenancy agreement for the Premises completed and returned to Mercurine. In a
letter from Canberra’s solicitors to Mercurine dated 5 May 2006, however,
Canberra maintained that the Lease had been terminated by virtue of the
Possession Order and that Mercurine was obliged to deliver possession of the
Premises to Canberra. Ms Goh averred that she was “surprised”[note: 3] by that
letter because it contradicted the understanding which Mercurine had reached
with Mr Koh. She stated that Mr Oh called Mr Koh again after Mercurine
received the letter dated 5 May 2006 and once again obtained Mr Koh’s
confirmation that Canberra would withdraw the Default Judgment after it
received payment.

14 It was common ground that Mercurine paid the sum of $518,998.10 (“the
Compromise Sum”) (_cf_ the sum of $519,155.62 allegedly agreed on earlier
under the Compromise Agreement (see [12] above) as well as the sum of
$518,998.12 mentioned in Ms Goh’s letter of 28 April 2006 (see [13] above)) to
Canberra on 6 June 2006 after receiving cash injections from its shareholders,
Clareville and EWO, on 30 May 2006 and 2 June 2006 respectively. Mercurine
claimed that, prior to these cash injections, it had sought and received
another confirmation from Mr Koh on 24 May 2006 that once the conditions
precedent attached to the cash injections (one of which was that Mercurine was
to pay the Compromise Sum to Canberra within three business days of receipt of
the cash injections) had been met, Canberra would withdraw the Default
Judgment. However, Mercurine subsequently received a letter from Canberra’s
solicitors dated 10 July 2006 stating that Mercurine was required to deliver
possession of the Premises pursuant to the Possession Order. The letter also
stated that Canberra was prepared to give Mercurine an extension of time until
28 February 2007 to deliver possession provided certain terms were complied
with. This letter was followed by another letter from Canberra’s solicitors to
Mercurine, dated 5 September 2006, denying that Canberra had confirmed that it
would withdraw the Default Judgment upon Mercurine’s payment of the Compromise
Sum. In addition, this letter asserted that all payments made by Mercurine in
consideration for its occupation of the Premises from 1 January 2006 onwards
had been accepted by Canberra only as licence fees, and that Canberra had made
no representation or given any warranty that it would continue to accept
future payments and/or permit Mercurine to continue occupying the Premises.
Canberra also demanded a further $19,343.20 which it claimed was still owed by
Mercurine.

**Commencement of related proceedings by Mercurine**

15 On 21 December 2006, Mercurine filed Originating Summons No 2374 of 2006
(“OS 2374”) seeking, _inter alia_ :

(a) a declaration that the parties had entered into a full and final
settlement of the disputes which were the subject matter of Suit 861;

(b) a declaration that the Possession Order be set aside and that the Lease
subsisted and had not been terminated; and

(c) a declaration that the Money Judgment had been effectively compromised and
fully satisfied by Mercurine’s payment of the Compromise Sum.

On 2 February 2007, a senior assistant register granted the declarations set
out above. Canberra appealed against his decision via Registrar’s Appeal No 49
of 2007 (“RA 49 of 2007”). At the hearing of RA 49 of 2007 on 29 March 2007,
Belinda Ang Saw Ean J allowed Canberra’s appeal and ordered that OS 2374 be
converted into a writ action (this writ action is now proceeding as Suit No
244 of 2007 (“Suit 244”)). The trial of Suit 244, consolidated with Suit No
354 of 2007 (“Suit 354”) (see further [16] below), was set down for 7 April
2008 to 16 April 2008, and was subsequently adjourned until 30 October 2008 to
7 November 2008 (we shall refer to the consolidated suit hereafter as “the
Consolidated Suit”).

16 On 26 April 2007, following the hearing of RA 49 of 2007, Mercurine applied
via SUM 1843 for, _inter alia_ , an order that the Default Judgment be set
aside. Mercurine stated that the grounds for its application were as follows:

(a) the Default Judgment was irregular because:

(i) Canberra had not complied with the requirements under O 13 r 4(1) of the
Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed); and

(ii) Canberra had entered judgment for an excessive sum, in that it had
omitted to take into account (among other things) Mercurine’s right to set off
a sum of $139,271.50 for reimbursement of air-conditioning charges; and

(b) Mercurine had a defence on the merits which had a real prospect of success
and which carried some degree of conviction.

Mercurine also commenced Suit 354 on 11 June 2007 for, _inter alia_ , a
declaration that the Lease was for a fixed term of 14 years commencing on 2
June 2000.

The decisions below on SUM 1843

**AR Lim's decision**

17 In arriving at his decision to set aside the Default Judgment, AR Lim
analysed the following issues:

(a) whether Mercurine had a defence on the merits;

(b) what the applicable test for determining whether to set aside an irregular
default judgment was;

(c) whether the Default Judgment was irregular because, _inter alia_ :

(i) Canberra had not complied with the requirements under O 13 r 4(1) of the
Rules of Court for the purposes of its claim for possession of the Premises;
and

(ii) Canberra had claimed an excessive amount in rental arrears; and

(d) if Mercurine was entitled to set aside the Default Judgment, whether it
should nevertheless be allowed to enforce this right given its delay in filing
SUM 1843 and its conduct after the Default Judgment was entered.

18 In summary, AR Lim held that Canberra’s failure to obtain a certificate
stating that it was not claiming in Suit 861 any relief of the nature
specified in O 83 r 1 – which is required under O 13 r 4(1) – was a curable
irregularity (see the AR’s Judgment at [62]). On the other hand, the Money
Judgment was excessive. Since it was not the result of an accidental or a
clerical error on Canberra’s part, Canberra ought not to be permitted, in the
prevailing circumstances, to amend this part of the Default Judgment. The
Money Judgment, therefore, remained an irregular judgment (_id_ at [69]). The
entry of the Money Judgment – which was irregular and which, in AR Lim’s view,
should not be amended – was what prompted the assistant registrar to set aside
the Default Judgment (_ibid_ ; see also [93] of the AR’s Judgment).

**The Judge's decision**

19 On appeal against AR Lim’s decision, the Judge held that Canberra’s
argument that only the Money Judgment, but not the Possession Order, should be
set aside was untenable because Mercurine would be relying on the same defence
in respect of both the Money Judgment and the Possession Order (see the
Judge’s Judgment at [22]–[23]). However, the Judge ultimately allowed
Canberra’s appeal and reinstated the Default Judgment – albeit with the sum
stated therein reduced from $864,388.31 to $725,116.81 to take into account
Mercurine’s cross-claim against Canberra for air-conditioning charges (_id_ at
[45]) – because she considered that Mercurine had filed SUM 1843 far too late
in the day (_id_ at [37]–[44]).

20 The Judge held (_id_ at [42]) that once Mercurine received the letter from
Canberra’s solicitors dated 10 July 2006 requiring Mercurine to deliver
possession of the Premises by 28 February 2007 (see [14] above), it would have
been plain that Canberra intended to enforce its rights under the Default
Judgment. Mercurine should have promptly proceeded to apply to set aside that
judgment in July or August 2006 (see [44] of the Judge’s Judgment). Instead,
Mercurine filed OS 2374 (see [15] above), which, if granted, would have meant
that Canberra’s claims in Suit 861 had been settled pursuant to a compromise
agreement. This particular application, in the Judge’s opinion, supported the
view that Mercurine had abandoned any rights which it might have had to set
aside the Default Judgment (see [44] of the Judge’s Judgment).

The issues on appeal

21 Counsel for Mercurine raised the following issues before this court:

(a) whether Mercurine’s delay in filing SUM 1843 and its act of filing OS 2374
precluded it from being granted an order setting aside the Default Judgment;

(b) what the requisite standard _vis-à-vis_ the merits of the defence was for
the purposes of a setting-aside application;

(c) whether the Default Judgment was irregular; and

(d) depending on whether the Default Judgment was regular or irregular,
whether the merits of Mercurine’s defence met the requisite standard so as to
warrant the setting aside of that judgment.

Overview of our decision

22 At the end of the hearing, we varied the Judge’s orders and held that the
Default Judgment would be deemed to be set aside in the event that Mercurine
succeeds in the Consolidated Suit, inclusive of any appeal therefrom. The
costs of the hearing before AR Lim would be Mercurine’s costs in any event,
while the costs of the hearing before the Judge and of this appeal would be
costs in the cause of the Consolidated Suit. We also made the usual
consequential orders, with liberty for the parties to apply.

23 At this juncture, we should point out that the order which we made in this
appeal was based purely on practical considerations (in view of the pending
trial of the Consolidated Suit), and did not involve any definitive
determination of the merits of Mercurine’s defence. The facts of this case and
the procedural issues raised by counsel, however, highlighted the pressing
need for clarification of the applicable principles for setting aside a
default judgment, and we will now set out our views on this. Before we do
that, it is only appropriate that we first address the threshold issue of
delay as this constituted the crux of the Judge’s reasoning in reversing AR
Lim’s decision. If we thought that there had been undue delay on Mercurine’s
part in filing SUM 1843, this could well have been fatal to Mercurine’s
appeal.

The threshold issue: Whether Mercurine's delay in filing SUM 1843 was
reasonable

**Actions taken by Mercurine before filing SUM 1843**

24  The first fact which we had to consider was the filing and prosecution of
OS 2374, which later metamorphosed into Suit 244 (and, subsequently, the
Consolidated Suit). Canberra claimed that Mercurine’s act of filing OS 2374
constituted a fresh step taken by Mercurine after the latter became aware of
the irregularities in the Default Judgment. In the circumstances, Mercurine
could not thereafter elect to apply to set aside the Default Judgment via SUM
1843 because such conduct would be tantamount to blowing hot and cold,
contrary to the equitable doctrine prohibiting a party from approbating and
reprobating.

25 Canberra relied on the House of Lords case of _Evans v Bartlam_ [1937] AC
473 as purportedly supporting its assertion that Mercurine’s conduct was
redolent of approbation and reprobation. In that case, default judgment was
entered against the defendant, who then requested for time to see if he could
make any arrangement to pay the judgment sum. The plaintiff gave the defendant
seven days to do so. As no arrangement was made, the plaintiff then took steps
to enforce the default judgment. Subsequently, the defendant applied to have
the default judgment set aside. The application was dismissed by a master,
whose decision was reversed by a judge in chambers on appeal. The plaintiff
then appealed to the English Court of Appeal, which overturned (by a majority
of 2:1) the decision of the judge in chambers and held that the default
judgment ought not to have been set aside as “the [defendant] had by his
conduct shut himself out of any right to claim to have the judgment set aside”
(at 484). The case then went up on further appeal to the House of Lords, which
overturned the English Court of Appeal’s decision. In his judgment, Lord Atkin
advocated a cautious approach in ascertaining whether the defendant had made
an irrevocable election not to contest the default judgment (at 479):

_I find nothing in the facts analogous to cases where a party having obtained
and enjoyed material benefit from a judgment has been held [to be] precluded
from attacking it while he still is in enjoyment of the benefit._ I cannot
bring myself to think that a judgment debtor who asks for and receives a stay
of execution approbates the judgment, so as to preclude him thereafter from
seeking to set it aside whether by appeal or otherwise. Nor do I find it
possible to apply the doctrine of election. It is a simple answer to say that
to infer election it must be shown that the person concerned had full
knowledge of the various rights amongst which he elects. There is here no
evidence that the defendant at the time he asked for and received time [to
make arrangements to pay the judgment sum] had any knowledge of his right to
apply to set the judgment aside. I cannot think that there is any presumption
that he knew of this remedy either sufficiently for the purposes of the
doctrine as to election or at all. [emphasis added]

26 In our view, it was plain that _Evans v Bartlam_ did not inexorably support
the argument that Canberra advanced in relation to Mercurine’s alleged
approbation and reprobation. In the present case, Mercurine did not obtain any
benefit from deferring the filing of SUM 1843. The truth of the matter was
that it did not initially consider a setting-aside application to be necessary
because it thought – mistakenly or otherwise – that the parties were
negotiating a settlement and that Canberra would not enforce the Default
Judgment. Whether Mercurine’s belief was well-founded cannot be dealt with
separately from the question of how meritorious its defence is. The task of
deciding the merits of Mercurine’s defence is now within the purview of the
trial judge who is to hear the Consolidated Suit (in so far as Mercurine’s
defence in the present suit – _ie_ , Suit 861 – goes towards the basis of its
claim in the Consolidated Suit).

27 Turning now to Suit 244, we noted that, pursuant to Belinda Ang J’s
decision of 29 March 2007 (see [15] above), Mercurine filed its statement of
claim in respect of Suit 244 on 24 April 2007. Thereafter, Canberra filed its
defence on 30 May 2007. Mercurine seeks, _inter alia_ , the following reliefs
in Suit 244:

(a) a declaration that Mercurine, by its payment of the Compromise Sum to
Canberra on 6 June 2006, had entered into a full and final settlement with
Canberra of the disputes which were the subject matter of Suit 861;

(b) a declaration that the Default Judgment had been effectively compromised
and fully satisfied by Mercurine’s payment of the Compromise Sum on 6 June
2006;

(c) as an alternative to prayer (b) above, a declaration that Mercurine,
having paid the Compromise Sum on 6 June 2006, had fully satisfied the Money
Judgment;

(d) a declaration that the Lease subsisted and had not been terminated; and

(e)_a declaration that Mercurine was not obliged to deliver vacant possession
of the Premises pursuant to the Possession Order_.

It can be seen that, by the time Mercurine applied on 26 April 2007 to set
aside the Default Judgment, Suit 244 had already been set in motion.
Critically, a determination of whether Mercurine was obliged to deliver vacant
possession of the Premises to Canberra as at the date of the Default Judgment
(_ie_ , 9 January 2006), and no later than 28 February 2007 (see [14] above),
is fundamental to both Suit 861 (the underlying action giving rise to this
appeal) and Suit 244.

28 Mercurine submitted to this court that its right to apply to set aside the
Default Judgment was independent of any rights which it might be able to
assert if it succeeded in the Consolidated Suit. If Mercurine prevailed in
this appeal, it intended to apply to consolidate Suit 861 with the
Consolidated Suit. Canberra, on the other hand, contended that Mercurine’s
purpose in filing SUM 1843 was to avoid the risk that it (Mercurine) might
fail to persuade the trial judge in the Consolidated Suit of the merits of its
case. Canberra also alleged that Mercurine was concerned that if a stay of
Suit 861 was ordered pending the outcome of the Consolidated Suit, it would be
made on terms given Canberra’s doubts about the soundness of Mercurine’s
financial health.

29 Crucially, Mercurine’s delay in filing SUM 1843 was the basis upon which
the Judge reinstated the Default Judgment (with a variation to the quantum of
the Money Judgment). She was of the view that the time lag before Mercurine
made this application was unreasonably excessive (see [19]–[20] above). Before
we analyse the facts, it would be apposite to set out the relevant legal
principles on the effects of a delay in making a setting-aside application.

**The effects of delay on a setting-aside application**

30 The starting point is that unreasonable delay could severely prejudice a
setting-aside application. As Prof Jeffrey Pinsler SC rightly cautions in his
book, _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ (LexisNexis, 2006), at para 13/8/4:

Inordinate delay in making the application may lead the court to believe that
[the application] is not bona fide or that the defendant is not serious or
that he is irresponsible about the relief he seeks.

Canberra urged this court to adopt the English courts’ firm emphasis on the
necessity of making a setting-aside application promptly. A case in point that
was cited was _Regency Rolls Limited v Murat Anthony Carnall_ [2000] EWCA Civ
379 (“ _Regency Rolls_ ”). In that case, the defendant (“Mr Carnall”) was
absent from the trial on 22 March 1999 because of illness. On that date,
judgment was entered against him. Mr Carnall received a copy of the judgment
on or about 26 March 1999. He was housebound because of his illness until 30
March 1999. He sought legal advice from a firm of solicitors on either 29 or
30 March 1999, but, by 31 March 1999, it became clear that that firm of
solicitors would not be retained. After the Easter holidays (which were from 2
April 1999 to 5 April 1999 that year), Mr Carnall contacted new solicitors and
had several meetings with them. Following consultations between the new
solicitors and lead counsel on 16 April 1999 and 21 April 1999, Mr Carnall
made a setting-aside application on 21 April 1999. On the question of whether
Mr Carnall had filed that application with due promptness, the English Court
of Appeal ruled in the negative, holding that the former, despite knowing the
importance of prompt action, had not “acted with all reasonable celerity in
the circumstances” (at [45], _per_ Simon Brown LJ). In this regard, Rix LJ
pointed out (at [39]) that Mr Carnall could in the first instance have written
to the court to ask for a chance to prove his disability and to request for a
new trial. We should add that the learned judge also observed (at [40]) that
even if Mr Carnall had made his setting-aside application promptly, on the
facts of the case, the court was not inclined to set aside the default
judgment.

31 We would distinguish the present appeal from _Regency Rolls_ on several
grounds. As we shall explain at [38] below, the communications that transpired
between the parties from the date on which the Default Judgment was entered
(_viz_ , 9 January 2006) to July 2006 constituted active negotiations for a
settlement. Subsequently, Mercurine took further steps to make its position
clear to Canberra before filing OS 2374 in December 2006. We were satisfied
that Mercurine’s conduct in waiting till 26 April 2007 before filing SUM 1843
could not be deemed to amount to unreasonable delay. Whether Mercurine adopted
the correct procedure to contest the Default Judgment was, with respect, an
altogether different issue.

32 Needless to say, where a defendant delays in making a setting-aside
application, the court will in every case have to closely scrutinise the
reasons for the delay. Clearly, if Mercurine had deliberately withheld filing
SUM 1843 with the intent or desire to gain some litigation advantage, its late
application should _prima facie_ be viewed uncharitably. It would, however, be
a stretch of the imagination to conclude, on the facts of this case, that
Mercurine had deliberately or, indeed, intentionally delayed the filing of SUM
1843.

33 In contrast, delay was fatal to the defendant’s setting-aside application
in the High Court case of _Ang Kim Soon v Sunray Marine Pte Ltd_ [1997] 3 SLR
619 (“ _Ang Kim Soon_ ”). There, the plaintiff, who was injured in an accident
while working aboard a vessel, sued his employer for damages. The employer, in
the meantime, was pursuing an admiralty action against the vessel owner for an
indemnity in respect of the accident. Despite repeated requests by the
plaintiff, the employer did not enter a defence, and the plaintiff eventually
entered interlocutory judgment. The employer waited for nearly six months,
until after the admiralty action had been decided in its favour, before
applying to set aside the interlocutory judgment. After assessing the
competing considerations, Choo Han Teck JC dismissed the employer’s
application. Choo JC said (at [16]):

[Counsel for the employer] explained that the [employer] did not apply to set
aside the default judgment because he felt that if the shipowner succeeded in
its case, then it would be pointless to set aside the default judgment. If the
shipowner failed then, it appears, on the strength of the _Saudi Eagle_ case
[_ie_ , _Alpine Bulk Transport Co Inc v Saudi Eagle Shipping Co Inc_ [1986] 2
Lloyd’s Rep 221], there would be little difficulty in having the default
judgment set aside. On the surface this rationalisation appears somewhat
attractive and sensible. However, having considered the chronology of this
case and the conduct of the parties, I find that it is too late now for the
employer to set aside the default judgment. _Once liability [was] disputed,
the employer was bound to set aside the interlocutory judgment at the earliest
opportunity. It should not play a cat-and-mouse game with the shipowner using
the plaintiff as cheese._ [emphasis added]

34 Another case where the defendant’s delay in making its setting-aside
application was not looked upon kindly by the court was _Lee Theng Wee v Tay
Chor Teng_ [2003] SGHC 173. In that case, the defendant applied to set aside a
default judgment, which was based on a loan given to him by the plaintiff,
more than three years after it had been entered against him. Woo Bih Li J
considered that the defendant had “some prospect of success” (at [17]) in
establishing his allegation that the plaintiff had been engaging in illegal
money-lending in extending the loan, but held that the defendant’s “very long
delay” (_ibid_) before making his setting-aside application, coupled with the
absence of a valid reason for the delay, was fatal to the application.
Furthermore, Woo J found that the defendant had not been truthful in the
supporting affidavit which he filed for his setting-aside application
(_ibid_). For these reasons, the learned judge upheld the assistant
registrar’s dismissal of the defendant’s setting-aside application.

35 At the risk of stating the obvious, we would emphasise that procedural
rules must not occasion injustice by unfairly depriving a party of an
opportunity to argue its case. On the other hand, the indolent cannot as a
matter of course be awarded the same measure of justice as the diligent. As
Warren L H Khoo J aptly observed in _European Asian Bank v Chia Ngee Thuang_
[1995] 3 SLR 171 (at 176, [21]):

In exercising its discretion [to set aside default judgments], the two
important factors which the court considers are the merits of the defendant’s
case and, if there has been a delay in approaching the court, any explanation
which the defendant has proffered for the delay.

36 In the Malaysian case of _Tuan Haji Ahmed Abdul Rahman_ _v Arab-Malaysian
Finance Bhd_ [1996] 1 MLJ 30 (“ _Tuan Haji Ahmed_ ”), the defendant waited for
three years before applying to set aside a default judgment. The Federal Court
of Malaysia took cognisance of this “spectacular delay” (at 42) and also
dismissed as “improbable” (_ibid_) the defendant’s explanation that the reason
for his delay was that he could not afford to engage solicitors. Nevertheless,
the court exercised its inherent jurisdiction and set aside the default
judgment, which it considered to be irregular for want of certainty. The court
took the position (_ibid_) that, despite a long delay before the filing of a
setting-aside application, it retained a discretion to set aside an irregular
judgment provided it was satisfied that:

(a) no one had suffered prejudice by reason of the defendant’s delay; or

(b) if such prejudice had been sustained, it could be met by an appropriate
order as to costs; or

(c) it would constitute oppression to let the judgment stand.

The principles set out in _Tuan Haji Ahmed_ are essentially sound, albeit not
necessarily exhaustive. We would add that in respect of point (c) above, we
are of the view that the greater the delay on the defendant’s part in applying
to set aside the default judgment, the more cogent the explanation must be as
to why it would be oppressive to let the judgment stand. Perhaps, instead of
using the term “oppression” (see _Tuan Haji Ahmed_ at 42), it might be
preferable to state that where there has been undue delay, the defendant may
need to show that a miscarriage of justice would be occasioned if the default
judgment were allowed to stand.

**Whether there was undue delay on Mercuirne's part**

37 Applying the principles outlined above (at [30]–[36]) to the facts of the
present case, it appeared to us that, with respect, the Judge placed undue
weight on Mercurine’s delay in filing SUM 1843. The delay should have been
assessed in the context of other prior and ongoing occurrences as well as the
plausibility of Mercurine’s explanation for its delay. A long delay _per se_
may not always be procedurally incurable or fatal to a setting-aside
application.

38 Let us now examine the objective facts. It cannot be disputed that after
Mercurine was notified by Canberra’s solicitors via the letter dated 10 July
2006 (see [14] above) that Canberra intended to enforce the Possession Order,
Mercurine unambiguously disputed Canberra’s right to enforce that part of the
Default Judgment via two letters sent by Ms Goh to Canberra’s solicitors on 8
August 2006 and 29 November 2006 respectively. In those letters, Ms Goh firmly
underlined Mercurine’s position that the Default Judgment had been compromised
by the payment of the Compromise Sum on 6 June 2006 and denied that the Lease
had been terminated. The letter dated 8 August 2006 set out Mercurine’s
position that Mr Koh had agreed “sometime on or about May 2006”[note: 4] to
“withdraw”[note: 5] the Default Judgment upon full payment of the Compromise
Sum. In her letter of 29 November 2006, Ms Goh reiterated this point and added
that Mercurine was prepared to meet Canberra to resolve the dispute amicably.
Granted that the sending of these letters by Mercurine and its filing of OS
2374 were unilateral acts, they nevertheless provided an eminently reasonable
explanation for the delay on Mercurine’s part in filing SUM 1843. When the
parties failed to resolve their differences by November or December 2006,
Mercurine decided to file OS 2374 to protect its position. From then on until
the hearing of RA 49 of 2007 on 29 March 2007 (see [15] above), Mercurine did
not consider it necessary to apply to set aside the Default Judgment. However,
once Belinda Ang J allowed RA 49 of 2007 and ordered that OS 2374 be converted
into a writ action, a trial became “inevitable”.[note: 6] Mercurine then quite
promptly filed SUM 1843 within one month of 29 March 2007. Can it now be
fairly said that Mercurine had behaved unreasonably in delaying the filing of
this summons?

39 Canberra sought to impress on this court the force of the Judge’s finding
that Mercurine should have applied to set aside the Default Judgment in July
or August 2006 (see [20] above). Canberra argued that between July 2006 and
November 2006, the parties had not engaged in any negotiations. Rather,
communications between the parties had been restricted to terse exchanges of
letters between their respective solicitors. This was not quite accurate in
view of the contents of the two letters that Ms Goh wrote to Canberra (see
[38] above), the latter of which included an intimation of Mercurine’s
willingness to hold further negotiations with Canberra. The facts spoke for
themselves.

40 On the facts, we were satisfied that Mercurine’s conduct was explicable,
and that its (apparent) delay in filing SUM 1843 should not be the sole or
primary reason for dismissing that application because:

(a) Mercurine’s delay was not merely strategic, in that Mercurine did not
stand to gain from making a late setting-aside application, and, on this
basis, its conduct was readily distinguishable from that of the defendant in
_Ang Kim Soon_ ([33] _supra_);

(b) Mercurine was under the impression that it had negotiated a compromise
with Canberra and it intended to honour that agreement, as evidenced by its
payment of the Compromise Sum to Canberra on 6 June 2006 (see [13]–[14]
above); and

(c) Mercurine’s explanation that it was trying to find an out-of-court
settlement in view of the interests of the ultimate shareholders that the
parties had in common (namely, Koh Brothers and HH (see [5] above)) was, all
said and done, plausible and appeared to dovetail with the objective facts.

**Summary of our ruling on the threshold issue of delay**

41 To sum up, where Mercurine’s delay in filing SUM 1843 was concerned, the
Judge erred in holding that Mercurine’s failure to file that application by
July or August 2006, coupled with the filing of OS 2374 on 21 December 2006,
without more, justified the dismissal of SUM 1843. We therefore considered
that the just result would be to allow each party the full opportunity to
present the merits of its case at the trial of the Consolidated Suit. It is
our view that in the proceedings below, the appropriate order would have been
a stay of the enforcement of the Default Judgment pending the outcome of the
Consolidated Suit. If Canberra had anxieties about Mercurine’s allegedly
precarious financial position, it could have applied for an expedited hearing
of that suit.

42 Having disposed of the threshold issue of delay in Mercurine’s favour, we
now proceed to give our views on the other pertinent issues raised in this
appeal. We shall begin by setting out the legal principles which apply to
setting-aside applications. For reasons that will become apparent, it is
timely to review the current position in this critical area of civil
procedure.

The legal principles relating to setting-aside applications

43 A default judgment is usually entered because the defendant has breached
procedural rules. However, there may also be cases where, quite apart from the
defendant’s non-compliance with procedural rules, the plaintiff itself
breaches procedural rules and enters a default judgment when it is not in fact
entitled to do so. Case law, quite logically, draws a distinction between
_regular_ and _irregular_ default judgments. This approach reflects the
court’s concern with the reasons for the defendant’s setting-aside
application, and rightly so since a default judgment, _properly entered_ ,
confers property rights on the plaintiff. Before exercising its discretion to
set aside a default judgment, the court is entitled to inquire into the
parties’ conduct and assess where the balance of the equities lie. If the
default judgment is regular, there is a presumption that the plaintiff acted
correctly and should not be lightly deprived of the fruits of its judgment;
conversely, if the default judgment is irregular, there is a presumption that
the plaintiff breached the proper procedure and, thus, should not be allowed
to take advantage of its own default. (It should, however, be noted that a
judgment may be irregular not only because of the plaintiff’s intentional
failure to comply with procedural rules, but also because of clerical or
accidental mistakes made by the plaintiff.) Not surprisingly, the defendant
has a heavier burden to discharge when it seeks to set aside a regular default
judgment.

**Regular default judgments**

_The orthodox position_

44 The court may exercise its discretion pursuant to O 13 r 8 of the Rules of
Court to (_inter alia_) set aside a judgment in default of appearance (an “O
13 default judgment”) which is regular. This rule states that:

The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, set aside or vary any judgment
entered in pursuance of this Order.

(It should be noted that O 19 r 9 contains an identical provision _vis-à-vis_
a judgment in default of pleadings (an “O19 default judgment”).) In
determining whether it is justified to set aside the default judgment in
question, the court would consider, first and foremost, the merits of the
defence, although the causes of the defendant’s default and the timeliness of
the setting-aside application would be taken into account as well.

45 For nearly 50 years, until the decision of the English Court of Appeal in
_Alpine Bulk Transport Co Inc v Saudi Eagle Shipping Co Inc_ [1986] 2 Lloyd’s
Rep 221 (“ _The Saudi Eagle_ ”), _Evans v Bartlam_ ([25] _supra_) was
considered to be the leading authority on the test for setting aside a regular
default judgment. That test, according to Lord Atkin, was whether the
defendant had “a prima facie defence” (_id_ at 480). Lord Wright echoed this
approach in the following terms (_id_ at 489):

The primary consideration is whether [the defendant] has _merits to which the
Court should pay heed_ ; if merits are shown the Court will not prima facie
desire to let a judgment pass on which there has been no proper adjudication.
[emphasis added]

The opinion of Lord Russell of Killowen could arguably give rise to some
semantic debate because he used the expression “serious defence” (_id_ at
482). However, the point which Lord Russell was making was that while a judge
would inevitably consider the merits of the defence before exercising the
court’s discretion to set aside a regular default judgment, proof by the
defendant of some useful purpose in setting aside the judgment in question or
of the existence of a serious defence was _not_ a condition precedent to the
court’s exercise of its setting-aside discretion.

46 The test laid down in _Evans v Bartlam_ – which we will refer to
interchangeably as the “ _Evans v Bartlam_ test” and “the ‘arguable or triable
issue’ test” – was subsequently applied in a number of notable cases,
including _Burns v Kondel_ [1971] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 554, a decision of the English
Court of Appeal (see especially 555, _per_ Lord Denning MR), and, locally,
Chao Hick Tin J’s decision in _Singapore Gems Co v The Personal
Representatives for Akber Ali_ [1992] 2 SLR 254.

47 It can still be confidently said that the following _dictum_ of Lord Atkin
in _Evans v Bartlam_ (at 480) continues to be the definitive statement of the
rationale and basis for the court’s exercise of its discretion when it sets
aside a regular default judgment:

The principle obviously is that unless and until the Court has pronounced a
judgment upon the merits or by consent, it is to have the power to revoke the
expression of its coercive power where that has only been obtained by a
failure to follow any of the rules of procedure.

_The decision in_ The Saudi Eagle

48 In _The Saudi Eagle_ ([45] _supra_), however, Sir Roger Ormrod, who
delivered the judgment of the English Court of Appeal, rather perplexingly
opined that all the law lords in _Evans v Bartlam_ ([25] _supra_) had “clearly
contemplated that a defendant who [was] asking the Court to exercise its
discretion [to set aside a regular default judgment] in his favour should show
that he ha[d] a defence which ha[d] a _real prospect of success_ ” [emphasis
added] (see _The Saudi Eagle_ at 223). Sir Ormrod’s judgment continued thus
(_ibid_):

Indeed it would be surprising if the standard required for obtaining leave to
defend (... [whereby the defendant] has only to displace the plaintiff’s
assertion that there is no defence) were the same as that required to displace
a regular judgment of the court and with it the rights acquired by the
plaintiff. In our opinion, therefore, to arrive at a reasoned assessment of
the justice of the case _the Court must form a provisional view of the
probable outcome if the judgment were to be set aside and the defence
developed. The “arguable” defence must carry some degree of conviction._
[emphasis added]

Since then, _The Saudi Eagle_ (an _English Court of Appeal_ decision) has
apparently, and rather inexplicably, eclipsed _Evans v Bartlam_ (a _House of
Lords_ decision) as the leading authority on the applicable test for
determining whether a regular default judgment ought to be set aside. The
“real prospect of success” test enunciated by Sir Ormrod (the “ _Saudi Eagle_
test”) – which is generally accepted as laying down a higher and more rigorous
standard than that relating to an application for summary judgment under O 14
of the Rules of Court (an “O 14 application”), where the defendant merely
needs to show that there are triable issues in order to obtain leave to defend
– has become the preferred test for assessing the merits of the defence where
a defendant seeks to set aside a regular default judgment. In England, the
enactment of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (UK) (“CPR”) led to the
codification of the _Saudi Eagle_ test via r 13.3(1), which states:

[T]he court may set aside or vary a judgment entered [in default] if —

(a) _the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim_ ;
or

(b) it appears to the court that there is some other good reason why —

(i) the judgment should be set aside or varied; or

(ii) the defendant should be allowed to defend the claim.

[emphasis added]

Hong Kong has also apparently adopted Sir Ormrod’s interpretation of _Evans v
Bartlam_ (as set out above) and now follows the stricter _Saudi Eagle_ test.
This can be seen from the following passage in _Hong Kong Civil Procedure
2006_ (Martin Rogers gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2006) vol 1 at para
13/9/14:

It is not sufficient to show a merely “arguable” defence that would justify
leave to defend under O.14. The defendant must show that he has “a real
prospect of success”. To do so, he must satisfy the court that his case and
the evidence that he adduces in support of it is potentially credible and
carries some degree of conviction. Thus, the court must form a provisional
view of the probable outcome of the action (Evans v. Bartlam _[1937] A.C. 473,
HL as explained in ..._ The Saudi Eagle _[1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 221, CA …_)_._
[emphasis added]

49 One of the difficulties with _The Saudi Eagle_ is the apparent internal
inconsistency between various portions of Sir Ormrod’s judgment. As mentioned
earlier (at [48] above), Sir Ormrod purported to equate the “arguable or
triable issue” test with his “real prospect of success” test (see _The Saudi
Eagle_ at 223). The following passage in his judgment (_ibid_) provides a
stark illustration of his approach (see also the passage quoted earlier at
[48] above):

In our opinion ... to arrive at a reasoned assessment of the justice of the
case the Court must form a provisional view of the probable outcome if the
judgment were to be set aside and the defence developed. _The “arguable”
defence must carry some degree of conviction._ [emphasis added]

We agree with AR Lim that, on a plain reading, the phrase “some degree of
conviction” is not synonymous with “real prospect of success” (see the AR’s
Judgment at [47]). Moreover, requiring a court to “form a provisional view of
the probable outcome if the judgment were to be set aside and the defence
developed” (_per_ Sir Ormrod in _The Saudi Eagle_ at 223) appears to go beyond
the proper scope of a court’s exercise of discretion at such an early stage of
the proceedings, and does not accord with the overriding principle enunciated
by Lord Atkin in _Evans v Bartlam_ at 480 (see the passage reproduced at [47]
above).

50 To date, the Singapore courts appear to have uncritically adopted the
approach taken by Sir Ormrod in _The Saudi Eagle_ without assessing its
soundness either as a matter of principle or as a matter of policy. The _Saudi
Eagle_ test was first applied without any explanation or examination by Rubin
JC in _Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tay Keow Neo_ [1992] 1 SLR 205 (“ _Hong Leong
Finance Ltd_ ”). Shortly thereafter, it was approved without any analysis by
this court in _Abdul Gaffer v Chua Kwang Yong_ [1995] 1 SLR 484 (“ _Abdul
Gaffer_ ”). For the past decade or so since then, the lower courts in
Singapore have considered themselves to be bound by _Abdul Gaffer_. The Judge,
for one, interpreted _Abdul Gaffer_ as mandating that (see the Judge’s
Judgment at [24]):

In the case of a regular judgment, the position is not in doubt. … To persuade
a judge to set aside a regular judgment, it is insufficient for the defendant
to put forward an arguable defence that would justify leave to defend under O
14.

This court is, however, not so constrained by the decision in _Abdul Gaffer_.
We have pointed out that both the High Court in _Hong Leong Finance Ltd_ and
the Court of Appeal in _Abdul Gaffer_ did not elaborate on their respective
reasons for adopting the _Saudi Eagle_ test in preference to the long-standing
_Evans v Bartlam_ test. Indeed, in _Abdul Gaffer_ , this court simply stated
(at 488–489, [18]):

[T]he principles upon which the court should exercise its discretion under O
13 r 8 [of the Rules of the Subordinate Courts 1993] ... are:

(i) it is not sufficient to show merely an arguable defence that would justify
leave to defend under O 14; [the defence] must both have a real prospect of
success and carry some degree of conviction; and

(ii) if proceedings are deliberately ignored, this conduct, although not
amounting to an estoppel at law, must be considered ‘in justice’ before
exercising the court’s discretion to set aside the default judgment ... (see
_The Saudi Eagle_ _..._).

There was no attempt to explain why the older _Evans v Bartlam_ test needed
re-assessment in the Singapore context. Furthermore, _prima facie_ , the
decision in _Abdul Gaffer_ seems to suggest (incorrectly) that there is a
single test for all types of setting-aside applications, regardless of whether
the default judgment in question is regular or irregular. It is time to
revisit _Abdul Gaffer_ and _The Saudi Eagle_ , not least because the latter
has been heavily criticised and qualified in, _inter alia_ , England and
Malaysia (see _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ ([30] _supra_) at para 13/8/9).

_Criticisms of the_ Saudi Eagle _test_

51 Not long after _The Saudi Eagle_ ([45] _supra_) was decided, Hobhouse J
reverted to the _Evans v Bartlam_ test in _The “Ruben Martinez Villena”_
[1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 621 (“ _The_ _Ruben Martinez_ ”) (see Chia Jin Chong
Daniel, “Setting aside a regular default judgment: What is a good defence on
the merits – real prospect of success or arguable, triable issue?” (1996) 17
Sing LR 221 at 239–240; see also the judgment of Assistant Registrar Goh Yihan
(“AR Goh”) in _Lim Quee Choo v David Rasif_ [2008] SGHC 36 (“ _Lim Quee Choo_
”) at [74]). In his admirably lucid and comprehensive disquisition in _Lim
Quee Choo_ of the test currently applicable to the setting aside of regular
judgments, AR Goh pointed out (at [74]) that _The_ _Ruben Martinez_ has
apparently hitherto not been considered by the courts in Singapore. In our
view, Hobhouse J’s judgment in that case is both highly illuminating and
instructive, and merits close attention.

52 In _The_ _Ruben Martinez_ , Hobhouse J emphasised the peculiar facts of
_The Saudi Eagle_. In the latter case, the plaintiff charterer arrested the
defendant’s ship, _Saudi Eagle_ , in Rotterdam in October 1982 following the
defendant shipowner’s refusal to load certain cargo onto the ship. A year
later, the plaintiff issued a writ against the defendant claiming damages for
breach of contract. Initially, the defendant decided not to defend the action
because it had no assets and allowed judgment to be entered against it.
Subsequently, the defendant realised that the plaintiff had earlier obtained
security in Rotterdam and was holding on to the bond, such that the
plaintiff’s judgment was not as barren as originally supposed. Belatedly, the
defendant then applied to set aside the default judgment and sought leave to
defend. The three defences which the defendant put forward in support of its
setting-aside application were “the wrong defendant, the wrong plaintiff and
the wrong contract” (_id_ at 223). With regard to the first defence, Sir
Ormrod did not think that it had “any reasonable prospect of success” (_id_ at
225); likewise, he held, in respect of the latter two defences, that “neither
of these suggested defences ha[d] any prospect of success” (_id_ at 224).

53 Hobhouse J also alluded to the inconsistencies in Sir Ormrod’s judgment
that we highlighted earlier (at [49] above). He stressed (at 624 of _The Ruben
Martinez_) that in _The Saudi Eagle_ , Sir Ormrod had been presented with:

... a case in which the suggested defences involved just simple questions of
law; they were questions of construction; he considered that they were
unarguable and, therefore, there was no reason for setting aside the judgment.

On this basis, Hobhouse J doubted if Sir Ormrod had intended to lay down, at
223 of _The Saudi Eagle_ (see the passage quoted at [48] above), the principle
that the court should set aside a regular default judgment only if it was
satisfied that there was a better than 50% chance that the outcome of the
action if the default judgment were set aside would be favourable to the
defendant (see _The Ruben Martinez_ at 624). Hobhouse J added that if,
however, that was indeed the meaning which Sir Ormrod had in mind, he would
regard the latter’s statement in _The Saudi Eagle_ (at 223) as _obiter dictum_
which he was not bound to follow (see _The Ruben Martinez_ at 624).

54 In Hobhouse J’s view, the decision in _Evans v Bartlam_ ([25] _supr_ a) was
based on the logic that “there [was] no purpose in setting aside a [regular
default] judgment if there [was] not going to be something to be gained by
having a trial” (see _The Ruben Martinez_ at 623). As such, the defendant had
to show “ _a real prospect that, if the matter [went] to trial, there [would]
be some different decision_ ” [emphasis added] (_ibid_). To achieve this, “an
arguable defence” (_ibid_) or, more precisely, “a good arguable defence”
(_ibid_) would suffice. At the risk of complicating the analysis, we should
point out that Hobhouse J also considered “a defence which has a real prospect
of success” (_ibid_) to be another possible description of the standard set in
_Evans v Bartlam_ – and not _The Saudi Eagle_ – _vis-à-vis_ the merits of the
defence. To place Hobhouse J’s judgment in its proper context, we shall
reproduce in full the relevant passage (see _The Ruben Martinez_ at 623):

The logic of the decision [in _Evans v Bartlam_] is, as I have said, that
there is no purpose in setting aside a judgment if there is not going to be
something to be gained by having a trial, so that the defendant must show a
real prospect that, if the matter goes to trial, there will be some different
decision. One way that that can be expressed is if the defendant can show that
he has a “good arguable defence” or, if one prefers it, “an arguable defence”,
although I think “a good arguable defence” is nearer the right terminology.
Similarly, it can be said: “a defence which has a real prospect of success”.
Those phrases are the phrases which were relied upon before me by the
plaintiffs in resisting this [setting-aside] application and I think they are
legitimate phrases to use. In other cases the simple phrase “arguable defence”
has been used, and that may be more appropriate in certain situations because,
as is clear, _all these cases depend upon their own circumstances_ ; in
another situation it has been said, to quote Lord Denning in _Burns v. Kondel_
, [the defendant] need only show a defence which discloses an arguable or [a]
triable issue. _Those are very similar criteria and the emphasis may just
arise from the difference that is presented by the facts in each case._
[emphasis added]

Thus, in _The Ruben Martinez_ , Hobhouse J was quick to correctly recognise,
not long after _The Saudi Eagle_ was decided, that the _Saudi Eagle_ test
ought not to be read as supplanting the _Evans v Bartlam_ test, and that the
various formulations of the test which the defendant had to satisfy for the
purposes of establishing a defence on the merits were very much a commentary
on the facts of the individual cases concerned. However, his guidance went
largely unheeded as Sir Ormrod’s “real prospect of success” test became
fashionable. As a consequence, a standard (in relation to showing a defence on
the merits) that was more severe than that applied in O 14 applications
(where, as stated earlier at [48] above, the defendant merely has to show the
existence of triable issues in order to obtain leave to defend) became
entrenched where the setting aside of regular default judgments was concerned.

55 There have been a few noteworthy exceptions, however. In _Allen v Taylor_
[1992] PIQR 255, for instance, the English Court of Appeal declined to adopt
the _Saudi Eagle_ test. Dillon LJ expressed the view that “[i]t [was]
impossible to be dogmatic about the extent to which the court must be
satisfied of the validity of the suggested defence” (at 259), particularly
where each party’s case would carry some conviction if it stood alone, such
that the court could not say, without conducting a trial, which party would
succeed (_ibid_).

56 A similar departure from _The Saudi Eagle_ ([45] _supra_) was endorsed by
the English Court of Appeal in _Day v Royal Automobile Club Motoring Services
Ltd_ [1999] 1 WLR 2150 (“ _Day v RAC_ ”). In that case, the plaintiff claimed
damages for financial loss and personal injuries which she suffered when she
fell from a pickup truck sent by the defendant to deal with a motoring
emergency that she and her husband had encountered. The plaintiff made her
claim just one day before the expiry of the relevant limitation period. The
respective parties’ solicitors agreed to allow a general extension of time for
the filing of the defence, which agreement was to be terminable on 14 days’
notice. Due to a “muddle” (_id_ at 2152) in the office of the defendant’s
solicitors, the defence was not filed within the extended time frame and
default judgment was entered. In dismissing the defendant’s setting-aside
application, the judge at first instance stated (at 2154):

What has been demonstrated before me on the defendant’s affidavits is an
arguable defence. It is on one view a defence which can only be resolved by
the trial judge. It is a question of fact.

He went on to say (_ibid_):

[T]here must be a real likelihood that a defence will succeed. I do not see a
real likelihood of [the defendant’s] defence, even in its amended form,
succeeding.

57 In reversing the judge’s decision to dismiss the defendant’s setting-aside
application, Ward LJ expressed the following reservations about the _Saudi
Eagle_ test (see _Day v RAC_ at 2157):

[I]t is usually easy to identify the case which is hopeless and say “There is
_no_ real prospect of success.” I add the emphasis to make the point that one
is looking at the matter **_negatively_**. The approach is distorted if one
uses “real prospects of success” as a **_positive_** test. That wrongly
encourages a test of judging fact[s] on affidavit[s] and then coming to a
provisional view of the probable outcome. I agree ... that _**the arguable
case must carry some degree of conviction but judges should be very wary of
trying issues of fact on evidence where the facts are apparently credible and
are to be set ... against the facts being advanced by the other side. Choosing
between them is the function of the trial judge, not the judge on the
interlocutory [setting-aside] application** ,_ unless there is some inherent
improbability in what is being asserted or some extraneous evidence which
would contradict it. I would therefore be a little hesitant to elevate the
test into ... “a real likelihood that a defendant will succeed.” [emphasis
added in bold italics]

58 _Allen v Taylor_ ([55] _supra_) and _Day v RAC_ quite correctly shifted
some of the focus away from the strength of the defendant’s case and back to
the overriding objective of not unfairly or prematurely shutting a defendant
out of the proceedings. We are of the view that this shift was a move in the
right direction. As Prof Pinsler shrewdly observes in _Singapore Court
Practice 2006_ ([30] _supra_) at para 13/8/9:

The approach in _Saudi Eagle Shipping_ [_ie_ , _The Saudi Eagle_] is not free
from difficulty. In the first place, the higher standard requires the court to
enter into an evaluation of the evidence to determine the likely outcome of
the case. This task may be compromised by the inconclusiveness of the
affidavits, and allegations in the pleadings which have yet to be
substantiated by evidence tested on oath. ...

Secondly, it may be unjust to deprive a defendant who can raise a genuinely
triable issue (as opposed to a sham defence) of his opportunity to challenge
the plaintiff’s case at trial. In _Saudi Eagle Shipping_ , the [English] Court
of Appeal sought to justify the distinction between the standard required to
displace a regular judgment in default, and that applicable to resist an
application for summary judgment, on the basis that in the former situation an
actual judgment of the court has been obtained, and with it, the rights of
property acquired by the plaintiff ([1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 221, at 223). _This
distinction may be far less significant when one considers that in both
situations the defendant is seeking to avoid early judgment without trial
(whether summary or by default). Accordingly, if the defendant is able to
raise a triable issue which might prevent judgment at trial, the default
judgment should not be allowed to stand (in the same way, summary judgment
would not be granted in these circumstances). …_ No doubt, where the defendant
is responsible for the default judgment, and seeks to inconvenience the court
by applying to set it aside, the court’s displeasure may be expressed by
penalising him in costs and by imposing appropriate conditions as part of its
order.

[emphasis added]

We agree with these observations.

59 In Singapore, the lower courts, burdened (regrettably) by the weight of the
authority of this court, have engaged in creative attempts to mitigate the
impact and the breadth of the approach prescribed by _Abdul Gaffer_ ([50]
_supra_). In particular, _Abdul Gaffer_ has been distinguished locally on a
few occasions when the courts took the view that there were underlying factual
disputes that ought to be adjudicated in a full trial (see _Lim Quee Choo_
([51] _supra_) at [87]–[94]). One recent example that AR Goh cited in _Lim
Quee Choo_ at [87] was _Awyong Shi Peng v Lim Siu Lay_ [2007] 2 SLR 225 (“
_Awyong Shi Peng_ ”). In that case, the High Court noted that although
judgment had been entered against the defendant in default of defence, the
defendant had not deliberately ignored the proceedings. As such, “the merits
of the defence [might] not be scrutinised as strictly as propounded in _The
Saudi Eagle_ ” (see _Awyong Shi Peng_ at [8]). The court opined that “the
merits of the case appear[ed] to be evenly balanced” (_id_ at [9]) and
concluded that since the defendant “ _may_ have a defence” [emphasis added]
(_ibid_), he should be given an opportunity to present his case to the trial
judge. The default judgment was thus set aside. While this particular approach
can _prima facie_ be aligned with the less ritualistic approach taken in
_Allen v Taylor_ and _Day v RAC_ ([56] _supra_) towards the setting aside of
regular default judgments, it is no longer necessary to adopt this stance
since this court has now decided that the exercise of judicial discretion in
relation to an application to set aside a _regular_ default judgment must
ultimately be guided by the _Evans v Bartlam_ test.

The test presently applicable to the testing aside of regular default
judgments

60 It follows then that in deciding whether to set aside a regular default
judgment, the question for the court is whether the defendant can establish a
_prima facie_ defence in the sense of showing that there are triable or
arguable issues. It is, in our view, rather illogical to hold that the test
for setting aside a regular default judgment should be any stricter than that
for obtaining leave to defend in an O 14 application. In both instances, there
has been no hearing on the merits. This is not to say that the position in
both instances is completely identical or symmetrical. When a regular default
judgment has been entered, there would have been a prior default or lapse on
the part of the defendant. There are, however, other means of dealing with
such procedural default or lapses, including the imposition of adverse costs
orders or the making of a setting-aside order which is conditional on
appropriate terms being met (see, for example, the order made in _Su Sh-Hsyu v
Wee Yue Chew_ [2007] 3 SLR 673 (“ _Su Sh-Hsyu_ ”) _vis-à-vis_ the setting
aside of a judgment entered after a trial in the defendant’s absence).

61 Our revival of the _Evans v Bartlam_ test does not necessarily affect those
cases where the defendant’s conduct calls for the court to be less than ready
to exercise its setting-aside jurisdiction. _Ang Kim Soon_ ([33] _supra_)
would be a paradigm example of this genre of cases. In such cases, Sir
Ormrod’s observations in _The_ _Saudi Eagle_ ([45] _supra_) on the conduct of
the defendant in that case can still provide some useful guidance (at 225):

The conduct of the defendants in ... [_inter alia_] _deliberately deciding not
to give notice of intention to defend_ because it suited the interests of the
group to let the plaintiffs proceed against these defendants is a matter to be
taken into account in assessing the justice of the case. [emphasis added]

However, we would hasten to add that the overarching principle in _Evans v
Bartlam_ ([25] _supra_), as enunciated by Lord Atkin at 480 (see the passage
reproduced at [47] above), must always be accorded higher priority. This is
illustrated by the following two English cases.

62 In _Vann v Awford_ The Times (23 April 1986), the second defendant did
nothing while the plaintiffs entered judgment in default against him and
obtained, first, an order for damages to be assessed and, subsequently, an
order as to the amount of damages to be paid by the second defendant. The
second defendant applied to set aside the default judgment only after the
plaintiffs initiated garnishee proceedings and obtained charging orders on his
property. He then gave a dishonest reason to the court for his failure to give
notice of his intention to defend. The judge at first instance refused to set
aside either the default judgment for damages to be assessed or the order
eventually made upon an assessment of damages because he considered that the
second defendant’s setting-aside application had been made too late and no
reasonable explanation had been given for the delay. The English Court of
Appeal, however, held that the judge’s approach was contrary to the principle
laid down in _Evans v Bartlam_. Dillon LJ said:

Even for lying and attempting to deceive the court, a judgment for £53,000
plus [which was the sum that the second defendant was ordered to pay pursuant
to the assessment of damages] is an excessive penalty if there are arguable
defences on the merits.

Nicholls LJ adopted a similarly pragmatic stance in declining to affirm the
judge’s decision, pointing out that:

The court is concerned to do justice between the parties with regard to the
plaintiffs’ claim, [and] not to punish the defaulting defendant, inexcusable
though his conduct may have been.

63 In _J H Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd v Cafenorte SA Importadora E Exportadora
SA_ [1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 750, the plaintiff, in resisting the defendants’
setting-aside application, alleged that the decision by the defendants not to
challenge the default judgment was a deliberate and tactical choice and the
latter should thus live with the consequences of their decision. The English
Court of Appeal stressed that even if the plaintiff’s allegations were true
(and the court plainly had some doubts in this regard), the key consideration
was whether there was a defence on the merits. Waller LJ stated at 764:

The authorities to which we were referred demonstrated that if the Court
concluded that there was a defence on the merits which carried some degree of
conviction, _it is the very strong inclination of the Court to allow a default
judgment to be set aside even if strong criticism could be made of the
defendant’s conduct._ [emphasis added]

In such cases, the appropriate response might be to grant the defendant leave
to defend on appropriate terms.

64 It is rather unfortunate that the existing case law has caused problems in
practice because of the different expressions adopted by judges who were faced
with rather different factual matrices. The legal profession (as well as
judges) would do well to heed Ward LJ’s astute advice in _Day v RAC_ ([56]
_supra_) at 2157 that:

[I]t would be better if the differences in language in these cases could be
viewed as the emphasis [given] in a particular case to the particular facts of
that particular case.

It is apposite to conclude this discussion by reproducing in full the material
portion of the salutary principles laid down by Lord Atkin in _Evans v
Bartlam_ ([25] _supra_) at 480 that have long guided the assessment of
setting-aside applications. They continue to encapsulate, in our view, the
essence of when, how and why the discretion to set aside a regularly-obtained
default judgment ought to be exercised:

The Courts ... have laid down for themselves rules to guide them in the normal
exercise of their discretion. One is that where the judgment was obtained
regularly there must be an affidavit of merits, meaning that the applicant
must produce to the Court evidence that he has a prima facie defence. It was
suggested in argument that there is another rule that the applicant must
satisfy the Court that there is a reasonable explanation why judgment was
allowed to go by default, such as mistake, accident, fraud or the like. I do
not think that any such rule exists, though obviously the reason, if any, for
allowing judgment [to be entered] and thereafter applying to set it aside is
one of the matters to which the Court will have regard in exercising its
discretion. If there were a rigid rule that no one could have a default
judgment set aside who knew at the time and intended that there should be a
judgment signed, the [court’s setting aside jurisdiction] would be deprived of
most of [its] efficacy. The principle obviously is that unless and until the
Court has pronounced a judgment upon the merits or by consent, it is to have
the power to revoke the expression of its coercive power where that has only
been obtained by a failure to follow any of the rules of procedure.

65 For completeness, we reiterate that the merits of the defence do not
constitute the sole consideration that a court takes into account in deciding
whether to set aside a regular default judgment. While this factor is
certainly highly significant in its own right, it also has to be assessed
against other relevant considerations – at the end of the day, a balancing
exercise is involved. As this court recently reiterated in _Su Sh-Hsyu_ ([60]
_supra_) at [43]:

[T]he question of whether there is a defence on the merits is the dominant
feature to be weighed against the applicant’s explanation both for the default
and for any delay, as well as against prejudice to the other party …

66 We turn now to the legal principles which apply to the setting aside of
_irregular_ default judgments.

**Irregular default judgments**

_Whether irregular judgments must be set aside as of right_

(1) The historical position: _Anlaby v Praetorius_

67 In _Anlaby v Praetorius_ (1888) 20 QBD 764, the English Court of Appeal
held that a defendant was entitled to set aside an irregular default judgment
_ex debito justitiae_ , _ie_ , as of right (for convenience, we shall refer to
this principle as “the _ex debito justitiae_ rule”). This strict approach may
be attributed to two important features of that case. First, the law as it
stood then made a distinction between an order that was void (_ie,_ a nullity)
and an order that was voidable. The affected party could either ignore an
order that was a nullity or ask the court to set it aside; in the latter
scenario, he was entitled to have the order set aside _ex debito justitiae_
(_id_ at 769). As for an order that was voidable, the court had a discretion
as to whether to set it aside (_ibid_). Second, the judgment in _Anlaby v
Praetorius_ had been entered prematurely. Fry LJ stressed (at 768) that:

The Court acts upon an obligation; the order to set aside the judgment is made
ex debito justitiae, and there are good grounds why that should be so, because
the entry of judgment is a serious matter, leading to the issue of execution
...

In essence, the court in _Anlaby v Praetorius_ was preoccupied with the
prejudice that would be caused to the defendant if a “premature and irregular”
(_ibid_) judgment were allowed to stand.

(2) The modern approach: Order 2 rule 1 of the Rules of Court

68 In England, prior to October 1964, O 2 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme
Court (UK) read as follows:

**Non-compliance with Rules or rule of practice** (O. 2, r. 1).

1\. Subject to Rule 2 [the then English equivalent of O 2 r 1(3) of our Rules
of Court], non-compliance with any of these Rules, or with any rule of
practice for the time being in force, shall not render any proceedings void
_unless the Court so directs_ , but _the proceedings may be set aside either
wholly or in part as irregular_ , or amended, or otherwise dealt with, in such
manner and on such terms as the Court thinks fit.

[emphasis added]

69 The introduction of the new O 2 rr 1(1) and 1(2) of the Rules of the
Supreme Court (UK) (referred to collectively as “the new English O 2 r 1”) in
October 1964, which was aimed at “[getting] over the decision of _In re
Pritchard, decd_ [[1963] Ch 502]” (_per_ Lord Denning in _Harkness v Bell’s
Asbestos and Engineering Ltd_ [1966] 2 QB 729 (“ _Harkness v Bell_ ”) at 734),
eliminated the stark contrast between the legal effect of a void court order
and that of a voidable court order. The new English O 2 r 1, which is _in pari
materia_ with O 2 rr 1(1) and 1(2) of our Rules of Court, states:

**Non-compliance with Rules** (O. 2, r. 1).

1.—(1) Where, in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or at any
stage in the course of or in connection with any proceedings, there has, by
reason of any thing done or left undone, been a failure to comply with the
requirements of these rules, whether in respect of time, place, manner, form
or content or in any other respect, the failure shall be treated as an
irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings, any step taken in the
proceedings, or any document, judgment or order therein.

(2) Subject to paragraph (3) [which is similar, in substance, to O 2 r 1(3) of
our Rules of Court], the Court may, on the ground that there has been such
failure as is mentioned in paragraph (1), and on such terms as to costs or
otherwise as it thinks just, set aside either wholly or in part the
proceedings in which the failure occurred, any step taken in those proceedings
or any document, judgment or order therein or exercise its powers under these
rules to allow such amendments (if any) to be made and to make such order (if
any) dealing with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit.

Lord Denning explained the effect of the new English O 2 r 1 in _Harkness v
Bell_ as follows (at 735–736):

This new rule does away with the old distinction between nullities and
irregularities. _Every omission or mistake in practice or procedure is
henceforward to be regarded as an irregularity which the court can and should
rectify so long as it can do so without injustice._ It can at last be asserted
that “it is not possible for an honest litigant in Her Majesty’s Supreme Court
to be defeated by any mere technicality, any slip, any mistaken step in his
litigation.” [emphasis added]

70 The flexible approach permitted under the new English O 2 r 1 (and likewise
under O 2 r 1 of our Rules of Court) is well-illustrated by _Harkness v Bell_
itself. In that case, the plaintiff applied for leave to claim damages from
his employer for a work-related illness that he had contracted (leave of court
was required as the relevant limitation period had already expired). The
district registrar made the order granting leave. Subsequently, there were
lengthy settlement negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendant
employer. Some years later, the defendant learnt that there were two serious
flaws in the proceedings that had resulted in the district registrar’s order,
namely, the district registrar had no jurisdiction to give leave and no power
to make the order in the particular form in which it was made. The defendant
applied to set aside the deputy registrar’s order, but the judge in chambers
held that since that order was a nullity, there was nothing to set aside. This
created hardship for the plaintiff, for it meant that the district registrar’s
order had not been effective at all to grant him leave to commence his action
outside the limitation period. As it was too late by then for the plaintiff to
file a fresh application for leave to bring his claim, he applied instead to
have the deputy registrar’s order rectified. His application was dismissed at
first instance on the same ground as that given for the dismissal of the
defendant’s setting-aside application, _ie_ , the deputy registrar’s order was
a nullity and there was nothing that the court could do about it. The
plaintiff, however, succeeded on appeal to the English Court of Appeal.
Instead of setting aside the district registrar’s (irregular) order, the court
“put the matter right under the new provisions [_ie_ , the new English O 2 r
1] and … treated [the leave] as granted properly” (_id_ at 736, _per_ Lord
Denning).

71 Notwithstanding the flexibility allowed under the new English O 2 r 1, the
_ex debito justitiae_ rule remains relevant. This can be seen from two cases
decided by the English Court of Appeal after this provision was introduced,
_viz_ , _White v Weston_ [1968] 2 QB 647 and _Willowgreen Ltd v Smithers_
[1994] 1 WLR 832. In both of these cases, it was held that the default
judgment entered against the defendant was irregular, and therefore ought to
be set aside _ex debito justitiae_ , as proper service of the proceedings had
not been effected (see Camille Cameron, “Irregular Default Judgments: Should
Hong Kong Discard the ‘As of Right’ Rule?” (2000) 30 Hong Kong LJ 245
(“Cameron’s article”) at 248–249 for a helpful commentary on these two cases).
As the English Court of Appeal explained in _Ban Hin Lee Bank Berhad v Sonali
Bank_ (9 November 1998) (unreported):

[I]f the judgment is irregular ... [t]he older authorities seem to show that
it must then be set aside ex debito justitiae. And _in principle that must be
right, but it is always subject to the power of the court to amend in
appropriate cases._ In not all cases will it be appropriate to allow an
amendment; for example, if the judgment was entered before the time for
service of notice of intention to defend had expired, but in other cases it
may be appropriate. [emphasis added]

(3) The symmetry between Order 2 rule 1 and Order 13 rule 8 as well as Order
19 rule 9

72 Specifically in the context of irregular O 13 default judgments and
irregular O 19 default judgments, O 2 r 1 of our Rules of Court dovetails
neatly with the court’s wide jurisdiction under O 13 r 8 and O 19 r 9
respectively to set aside or vary such irregular judgments “on such terms as
it thinks just”. An example of the breadth of the court’s power under these
provisions can be seen from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal’s decision in _Po
Kwong Marble Factory Ltd v Wah Yee Decoration Co Ltd_ [1996] 4 HKC 157 (“ _Po
Kwong Marble Factory_ ”) (see Cameron’s article ([71] _supra_) for an
insightful analysis of the case).

73 In _Po Kwong Marble Factory_ , the process server left the writ at the unit
which adjoined the defendant’s registered office, thinking that the former was
the correct office. Judgment in default of defence was subsequently entered
against the defendant. The defendant’s setting-aside application was dismissed
at first instance, but was allowed on appeal subject to a term imposed by the
Hong Kong Court of Appeal (namely, the payment of money into court by the
defendant). Both Bokhary JA and Sears J considered that the court was
justified in attaching that term to the setting aside of the default judgment
(Nazareth VP had reservations about it, but ultimately concurred with the
majority’s order since the plaintiff had no objection). Bokhary JA, in
particular, opined that the layout of the defendant’s office – which was “of
the defendant company’s making” (_id_ at 161) and “a highly confusing one”
(_ibid_) – had contributed to the process server’s error in service. He
pointed out that (see _Po Kwong Marble Factory_ at 162):

‘Ex debito justitiae’ or as of right means without going into the actual
merits of the defence. It does not mean shutting one’s eyes [to] the
circumstances surrounding the question of service and why things went wrong in
that regard. _The court’s statutory jurisdiction is unfettered_. [emphasis
added]

In a similar vein, Sears J commented on how the court could exercise its wide
discretion under the Hong Kong equivalent of O 13 r 8 of our Rules of Court to
achieve a just overall outcome in individual cases, as follows (_id_ at 161):

The provisions of [the Hong Kong equivalent of O 13 r 8] as I have said, are
wide in their context. In my judgment, whilst it can be rightly said that a
judgment which has been obtained irregularly ought to be set aside as of
right, in other words that the merits of the particular defence to the claim
do not have to be entered into by the court, nevertheless, _there is always a
residual discretion in the court to have regard to the conduct of the
parties._ For example, if a judgment has been obtained irregularly and the
writ comes to the notice of the defendant, he may delay for a certain period
of time before taking any action on the writ. _In my judgment, the court still
has a discretion – having regard to what the defendant himself has done – to
deprive [the plaintiff], if necessary, of that judgment or alternatively, to
impose terms upon the setting aside of the judgment which accord with justice
having regard to the facts of the particular case._ [emphasis added]

_The test for determining whether or not the_ ex debito justitiae _rule should
be applied_

74 As we alluded to earlier (at [71] above), the _ex debito justitiae_ rule
remains relevant despite the wide discretion conferred on the courts to uphold
or vary irregular default judgments. In our view, this rule should continue to
be the starting point _vis-à-vis_ setting-aside applications involving
irregular default judgments as the expectation that litigants should observe
procedural rules cannot be lightly compromised.

75 How then should the court decide whether to apply or depart from the _ex
debito justitiae_ rule? The English statutory provisions serve as a helpful
guide in this regard. Under r 13.2 of the CPR, the English courts _must_ set
aside a default judgment which is irregular because of one or more of the
following reasons:

(a) the time limit for filing an acknowledgement of service or a defence (as
the case may be) had not expired at the time the default judgment was entered
(see r 13.2(a) read with r 12.3(1), as well as r 13.2(b) read with r 12.3(2));

(b) an application by the defendant for summary judgment against the claimant
or for the striking out of the claimant’s statement of case was pending when
the default judgment was entered (see rr 13.2(a) and 13.2(b) read with r
12.3(3)(a));

(c) the defendant had satisfied the whole claim before the default judgment
was entered (see r 13.2(c)); and

(d) where judgment on a claim for money is concerned, the defendant had filed
or served on the claimant an admission of liability to pay all of the money
claimed together with a request for time to pay (see rr 13.2(a) and 13.2(b)
read with r 12.3(3)(c)).

In our view, although our Rules of Court do not contain similar express
provisions, the factors set out in r 13.2 of the CPR, which underline the
importance of ensuring that the requirements of procedural justice are
observed where default judgment is entered against the defendant, can be
adopted by our courts _mutatis mutandis_.

76 Thus, the key question for the court, when it decides whether to adhere to
or depart from the _ex debito justitiae_ rule, is whether there has been such
an egregious breach of the rules of procedural justice as to warrant the
setting aside of the irregular default judgment as of right. In addressing
this issue, the court should consider, _inter alia_ :

(a) the nature of the irregularity, in particular, whether it consists of:

(i) entering a default judgment prematurely; or

(ii) failing to give the defendant proper notice of the proceedings;

(b) whether the defendant took a fresh step in the proceedings after becoming
aware of the irregular default judgment;

(c) whether there was any undue delay by the defendant in filing its setting-
aside application; and

(d) where a judgment is irregular because of the plaintiff’s breach of
procedural rules (which would be the case for the majority of irregular
default judgments), whether the breach was committed in bad faith.

The court will be particularly ready to set aside an irregular default
judgment where the judgment was entered prematurely or where the defendant had
no notice of the proceedings against him (see item (a) above), as these are
plain instances of injustice that offend the essence of due process. In
contrast, where the procedural injustice occasioned to the defendant is not
egregious, the court will generally be less inclined to adhere strictly to the
_ex debito justitiae_ rule, especially if the defendant has taken a fresh step
in the proceedings after becoming aware of the irregular default judgment (see
item (b) above), for instance, by admitting its liability under that judgment
(see, _eg_ , the decision of the English High Court in _BCCI v Habib Bank_
[1999] 1 WLR 42). With regard to the defendant’s undue delay (if any) in
filing its setting-aside application (see item (c) above), we would reiterate
that such delay, although potentially prejudicial to the defendant’s chances
of having the irregular default judgment set aside, is not invariably fatal
(see [30]–[36] above). We would also emphasise that the factors listed above
are by no means exhaustive – it is open to the court to consider, for the
purposes of deciding whether or not to adhere to the _ex debito justitiae_
rule, any other factor which may be relevant given the particular factual
matrix of the case at hand (see, _eg_ , the factors listed at [96] below).
Ultimately, in deciding whether there are proper grounds for departing from
the _ex debito justitiae_ rule, the overriding principle laid down in _Evans v
Bartlam_ ([25] _supra_) – _ie_ , the court must be guided by the (procedural)
justice of the case in hand – prevails.

_The legal position where the_ ex debito justitiae _rule_ _is not applied:
Whether the court may consider the merits of the defence_

77 In those cases where the court arrives at the view that the _ex debito
justitiae_ rule should not be followed, could there nonetheless be some other
sufficient reason which justifies the setting aside of the default judgment?
In particular, should the court, at this stage of the analysis, take into
account _the merits of the defence_ that the defendant may or intends to put
forward if its setting-aside application is allowed? In this regard, the
English Court of Appeal’s decision in _Faircharm Investments Ltd v Citibank
International Plc_ [1998] EWCA Civ 171 (“ _Faircharm_ ”), which has created
quite a stir in judicial circles, merits close consideration.

(1) The decision in _Faircharm_

78 The facts in _Faircharm_ were as follows. In June 1983, a Mr Frost
mortgaged a property (“the Property”) to Citibank International Plc
(“Citibank”) as security for repayment of a loan of £23,000. He also assigned
to Citibank, as further security, a life insurance policy which he had
obtained from an insurer (“Norwich Union”). (Although there was a suggestion
in _Faircharm_ that there might have been more than one insurance policy
involved, we shall, for ease of discussion, use the term “the Life Policy” to
denote the specific policy and/or all the policies which Mr Frost assigned to
Citibank.) About ten years later, in April 1993, Faircharm Investments Ltd
(“Faircharm”) obtained judgment against Mr Frost for the sum of £39,119.40.
Faircharm also obtained a charging order on the Property and an order for its
sale. Before Faircharm could sell the Property free of encumbrances, it had to
pay off the amount due to Citibank (which then came up to £30,858).
Faircharm’s solicitors wrote to Citibank suggesting that, since Faircharm
would be effecting payment of the outstanding sum due under the mortgage on
the Property, the mortgage over the Life Policy should be assigned to
Faircharm upon its redemption of the mortgage on the Property. According to
Faircharm’s solicitors, Citibank agreed to this proposal.

79 The sale of the Property on 20 October 1994 fetched a gross sum of £66,000,
which, after paying off the amount due to Citibank (_ie_ , £30,858), still
left Faircharm with a significant shortfall. The latter hoped to recoup part
of this shortfall from the surrender proceeds of the Life Policy, which
eventually amounted to £7,788.99. On the same day that the Property was sold
(_ie_ , 20 October 1994), Faircharm’s solicitors wrote to Citibank stating
that Faircharm was paying the redemption moneys due in respect of the Property
on the basis that Citibank would pay the surrender proceeds of the Life Policy
to it (Faircharm) and requesting that Citibank send those proceeds to it as
soon as possible. Faircharm did not get any response to the letter of 20
October 1994. Its solicitors wrote to Citibank again on 22 November 1994, 2
December 1994 and 21 December 1994 concerning the surrender proceeds of the
Life Policy, which were alleged to be “due to [Faircharm]” (_ibid_). Again, no
response was received from Citibank.

80 On 11 January 1995, a writ was issued on behalf of Faircharm against
Citibank. Faircharm pleaded that it had paid the sum of £30,858 to Citibank on
the basis that the latter would, _inter alia_ , remit to Faircharm the
surrender proceeds of the Life Policy; Citibank, however, had not done so.
Prior to the issue of the writ, Citibank had on 21 November 1994 written to
Norwich Union to inform the latter that the mortgage on the Life Policy had
been redeemed and that it (Citibank) had no further interest in that policy.
On 6 February 1995, Citibank informed Mr Frost’s solicitors that the Life
Policy had been sent to Norwich Union for surrender and that the original
policy documents were no longer in Citibank’s possession. (It appeared that
Citibank, in stating thus, had forgotten that the Life Policy had been sent to
Faircharm as long ago as 20 October 1994 or thereabouts, and that Faircharm
and/or its solicitors had likewise forgotten this; this point was not,
however, critical to the reasoning of the English Court of Appeal.) Citibank’s
letter of 6 February 1995 was forwarded by Mr Frost’s solicitors to Norwich
Union on 27 March 1995. Consequently, the surrender proceeds of the Life
Policy were paid to Mr Frost, instead of Faircharm, on 29 March 1995.

81 On 20 February 1995, before the payment of the surrender proceeds of the
Life Policy to Mr Frost and unaware that such payment to Mr Frost was
imminent, Faircharm applied by summons under O 14 and O 86 of the Rules of the
Supreme Court (UK) for, _inter alia_ , an order that Citibank hand over to
Faircharm the surrender proceeds of the Life Policy, the benefit of which had
been assigned to Citibank on 13 June 1993. The summons (“Faircharm’s summary
judgment application”) was heard sometime in April 1995 by Deputy Master Wall,
who made, _inter alia_ , an order that Citibank execute an assignment in
Faircharm’s favour of all of its (Citibank’s) beneficial interest in the Life
Policy. The specific performance ordered, therefore, was a variation of the
order that Faircharm had sought. At the time Faircharm’s summary judgment
application was heard, neither party seemed to be aware of the earlier payment
of the surrender proceeds to Mr Frost on 29 March 1995. As noted by the
English Court of Appeal in _Faircharm_ , there was no record of the deputy
master’s reasons for his decision, but he was reported to have said on a later
occasion (_ibid_):

My recollection is that I decided that [Faircharm] was entitled to its order
on the agreement [by Citibank to, _inter alia_ , remit the proceeds of the
Life Policy to Faircharm], but if that was wrong [Faircharm] would win anyway
on subrogation.

82 After it emerged that the surrender proceeds of the Life Policy had been
paid to Mr Frost, Faircharm claimed damages against Citibank, and entered a
default judgment on 18 January 1996 after Citibank failed to serve its
defence. This was a procedural irregularity because no leave to defend had
been given to Citibank (leave should have been granted because Faircharm’s
summary judgment application had succeeded only in part) and, thus, Citibank
could not be in default of defence. Citibank applied to set aside the default
judgment, but was unsuccessful both at first instance (before Deputy Master
Wall) as well as on appeal to a judge in chambers of the English High Court.
When the setting-aside application came before the English Court of Appeal,
Sir Christopher Staughton was keen to put an end to the “tortured
misunderstanding on both sides” (_ibid_) over the relatively small sum of
£7,788.99 (_ie_ , the quantum of the surrender proceeds of the Life Policy).
The learned judge reiterated that procedural rules were not meant to punish
litigants for their mistakes, but to do justice. He held that, although the
default judgment against Citibank was irregular (_ibid_):

_... Citibank would be bound to lose on an application for summary judgment
based on the true facts and properly argued, on two grounds._ First, _it has
now been held by [a deputy] master in a decision from which there is no longer
any attempt to appeal that Citibank contracted to remit the proceeds of the
[L]ife [P]olicy to Faircharm._ It must be an implied term of that agreement
that Citibank would not destroy [Faircharm’s] right to those proceeds by
writing as [it] did to Mr Frost’s solicitors, a letter which was passed to
Norwich Union. That was the [reason] why the proceeds of the policy were paid
to Mr Frost and not made available to Faircharm.

Secondly, even in the absence of such agreement _Faircharm would be subrogated
to the rights of Citibank in the [Life] [P]olicy if [Faircharm] chose to call
for [the policy], as [it] did._ It is a feature of the doctrine of subrogation
in insurance law that the subrogator is under a duty not to destroy or
prejudice any right or remedy to which the subrogatee becomes entitled; or at
any rate, he will be liable to compensate the subrogatee if he does so ... The
same principle must apply to [the] conduct of a prior encumbrancer [_viz_ ,
Citibank] who is paid off by a subsequent encumbrancer [_vi_ z, Faircharm].

[emphasis added]

As such, the lower courts’ decisions to dismiss Citibank’s setting-aside
application were affirmed and the default judgment was ordered to stand as a
judgment for damages in the amount of the proceeds of the Life Policy.
Significantly, Sir Staughton also endorsed the view (expressed by the lower
courts) that “if Citibank [were] bound to lose on a subsequent application [by
Faircharm] for summary judgment, it would be pointless to set aside the
existing judgment” (_ibid_).

(2) The Significance of _Faircharm_

83 _Faircharm_ ([77] _supra_) is noteworthy not so much because the English
Court of Appeal allowed an irregular default judgment to stand, but more
because the court identified a class of situations where such an outcome would
be appropriate – namely, cases where the defendant was “bound to lose” (_ibid_
, _per_ Sir Staughton) if the irregular default judgment were set aside and
the matter re-litigated. Indeed, the former aspect of the English Court of
Appeal’s decision is not as radical a departure from the _ex debito justitiae_
rule as it may _prima facie_ appear to be, given that the English courts
clearly have the power to uphold an irregular judgment (notwithstanding the
_ex debito justitiae_ rule) under the new English O 2 r 1. The latter aspect
of the decision in _Faircharm_ , however, marks a significant departure from
the principles hitherto applied to the setting aside of _irregular_ judgments.
As stated pragmatically in _The Supreme Court Practice 1999_ (Sir Richard
Scott chief ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 1998) vol 1 at para 13/9/9, the effect of
_Faircharm_ is that in an application to set aside an irregular judgment, “an
affidavit in support will now almost always be needed, as in the case of a
regular judgment”. From this perspective, _Faircharm_ has narrowed the
distinction between _regular_ and _irregular_ default judgments where setting-
aside applications are concerned.

84 To date, the approach taken in _Faircharm_ (which we will refer to
interchangeably as “the ‘bound to lose’ test” and “the _Faircharm_ approach”)
does not seem to have been widely embraced in jurisdictions outside England.
For instance, the Hong Kong judiciary has expressed reservations about and
refrained from adopting _Faircharm_ (see, for example, the Hong Kong Court of
Appeal’s decision in _Chu Kam Lun v Yap Lisa Susanto_ [1999] 3 HKC 378 at
384–385). The Hong Kong Chief Justice’s Working Party on Civil Justice Reform,
in its final report published on 3 March 2004
<http://www.civiljustice.gov.hk/fr/index.html> (accessed 22 July 2008), stated
in a footnote to para 287 (which falls under the section headed “Summary
Disposal of Proceedings”) that it considered the orthodox position (_ie_ , the
_ex debito justitiae_ rule) “preferable and correct in principle” compared to
the _Faircharm_ approach. In Australia, however, the Court of Appeal of the
Supreme Court of Queensland made some positive comments about _Faircharm_ in
the recent case of _Marjorie Joyce Cusack v Agostino De Angelis_ [2007] QCA
313 (at [33], _per_ Muir JA) as follows:

More recently, the English Court of Appeal has held [in _Faircharm_] that it
may be inappropriate to set aside an irregularly entered judgment if a
subsequent application for summary judgment is bound to succeed _._ _That
decision is consistent with the contemporary approach of applying rules of
practice and procedure, whether statutory or developed under the common law,
not rigidly and with undue technicality, but with regard to considerations of
cost, expedition, utility and justice._ [emphasis added]

That said, it does not appear that the other Australian jurisdictions have
unequivocally embraced the _Faircharm_ approach (see BC Cairns _, Australian
Civil Procedure_ (Lawbook Co, 7th Ed, 2007) at pp 371–372).

85 The main concern that has been expressed about _Faircharm_ is the possible
erosion of the defendant’s right to raise its defence. Of particular concern
is the risk that the plaintiff may get away with entering a default judgment
prematurely and thereby obtain judgment in its favour earlier than it could
have done if it had taken out an O 14 application against the defendant. Under
the Rules of Court, an O 13 default judgment can be properly entered only
“after the time limited for appearing” (see O 13 rr 1–6), while an O 19
default judgment can be properly entered only “after the expiration of the
period fixed under [the] Rules [of Court] for service of the defence” (see O
19 rr 2–7). In the event that (a) the plaintiff enters an O 13 default
judgment or an O 19 default judgment prematurely (_ie_ , before the relevant
timeline stipulated in O 13 or O 19, as the case may be, has expired) _and_
(b) the defendant’s application to set aside that irregular default judgment
is dismissed on the basis of the “bound to lose” test, judgment would
effectively be entered against the defendant without its having been given a
chance to exercise, to the full extent, its rights, as set out in the Rules of
Court, to present its defence. (In contrast, this scenario would not arise
where the plaintiff obtains summary judgment against the defendant as O 14 r 1
states that an O 14 application can only be made after the defendant has filed
its defence.) Although we do not think that it would be easy for the plaintiff
in this scenario – _viz_ , where the defendant applies to set aside a default
judgment which is irregular because it was entered prematurely – to satisfy
the requirement of showing that the defendant is “bound to lose” (_per_ Sir
Staughton in _Faircharm_) given that the defence has not even been filed yet,
the court should nevertheless be alert to this avenue for potential abuse of
the default judgment procedure. This is also why, as mentioned earlier (at
[76] above), the court will be particularly ready to set aside as of right a
prematurely-entered default judgment. In this regard, the timely caution
sounded in _The Supreme Court Practice 1999_ ([83] _supra_) vol 1 at para
13/9/8 merits careful consideration:

It is submitted that the freedom, now apparently given to the Court [following
the decision in _Faircharm_] to condone obtaining irregular judgments, should
be exercised with great caution[;] if not it could become the subject of
deliberate misuse. If a plaintiff enters judgment prematurely it will be
almost impossible to prove that this has been done deliberately rather than
through a mere miscalculation. Unless firm guidelines develop a plaintiff who
enters a premature judgment could be put in an advantageous position. _Thus
... a distinction should continue to be drawn between setting aside a regular
and an irregular judgment. If this is not done a defendant will be faced with
a more difficult test in applying to set aside a wrongly entered judgment than
if he was responding to an application for judgment under O.14 in a regularly
conducted action. If no distinction is made a defendant will be forced to
invoke the discretionary powers of the Court ... and satisfy the high test
imposed._ _... [It is suggested] that only if faced with a situation where
judgment would inevitably be given for the plaintiff should_ Faircharm _be
applied. To discourage abuse denying a successful [p]laintiff his costs might
be considered._ [emphasis added]

86 We should also point out that, in England, any uncertainty and potential
abuse created by the _Faircharm_ approach has been greatly ameliorated by the
enactment of r 13.2 of the CPR, which sets out specific circumstances in which
the English courts _must_ set aside an irregular default judgment (see [75]
above). Thus, England, where the _Faircharm_ approach originated, has
statutorily mitigated, if not eliminated, some of the potential difficulties
which that approach could give rise to.

(3) Should _Faircharm_ be adopted in Singapore?

87 In the proceedings below, both AR Lim and the Judge were favourably
disposed towards the rather unconventional approach taken in _Faircharm_ ([77]
_supra_) (see [14] of the AR’s Judgment and [26]–[29] of the Judge’s Judgment
respectively). We agree that, in a case where the _ex debito justitiae_ rule
is not applied, the merits of the defence is a highly important (but not
necessarily determinative) factor which the court should consider in deciding
whether the irregular default judgment should nonetheless be set aside on some
other ground (apart from the _ex debito justitiae_ rule). The _Faircharm_
approach provides a useful touchstone in this regard. Indeed, its practical
benefits cannot be ignored especially where:

(a) the plaintiff did not enter the default judgment prematurely or in bad
faith; and/or

(b) the defendant was not prejudiced by the irregularity.

In this narrower respect, we fully agree with the Judge that the _Faircharm_
approach is in line with the goal of efficient case and resource management
that our courts continuously strive towards (see the Judge’s Judgment at [26]
and [28]). As astutely observed in Cameron’s article ([71] _supra_) at 263:

If we accept, as we surely must, that the goals of justice on the merits,
fairness and ensuring compliance will occasionally conflict with the goal of
efficient, expedient and proportionate management of cases, the next question
is how that conflict can be resolved. _The answer is by the prudent exercise
of judicial discretion._ This might be criticized as less certain and
predictable than an absolute rule [_ie_ , the _ex debito justitiae_ rule] that
precludes any discretion if a judgment is irregular, but it has a better
chance of achieving the desired balance between these competing goals (and it
is consistent with the fact that such a discretion exists). [emphasis added]

88 The local decision of _Standard Chartered Bank v Chip Hong Machinery (S)
Pte Ltd_ [1990] SLR 1230 is a good example of the type of situation where the
_Faircharm_ approach would be apposite. In that case, the first defendants
mortgaged a property to the plaintiff bank to secure overdraft facilities. The
second defendants had occupied the upper floor of the property since 1947 and
had been paying rent to the first defendants as well as the latter’s
predecessors in title. The plaintiff knew of the existence of the second
defendants, but might not have been aware of their identity. When the first
defendants defaulted on payment, the plaintiff obtained a writ of possession
in respect of the property. Subsequently, the second defendants applied to be
joined as a party to the proceedings. They then sought to set aside the writ
of possession on two grounds: first, the writ of possession had been obtained
irregularly because a notice of the proceedings under O 83 of the Rules of the
Supreme Court 1970 had not been given to them; and, second, there was merit in
their defence to the plaintiff’s claim for possession.

89 Punch Coomaraswamy J accepted that the writ of possession had been
irregularly obtained. However, he dismissed the second defendants’ application
for the writ of possession to be set aside as he was of the view that there
was no merit in the second defendants’ defence. This was because the second
defendants, being an unincorporated society, could not hold a tenancy. As for
the contention that the second defendants were “licensees coupled with an
equity” (_id_ at 1232, [17]) since one of the first defendants’ predecessors
in title (“Tan”) had given them the express assurance that they could occupy
the premises for as long as they wished, the court dismissed this argument as
“wholly untenable” (_id_ at 1233, [18]) on the basis that, _inter alia_ , the
assurance allegedly given by Tan did not bind the first defendants. Since no
caveat had been lodged against the property, the plaintiff was entitled to
treat the property as unencumbered. For these reasons, the judge held that the
second defendants “had from the outset absolutely no defence to the
[plaintiff’s] claim” (_id_ at 1233, [22]). The judge also observed (_id_ at
1232, [12]):

I agree that, as a rule, writs of possession obtained irregularly ought to be
set aside almost, if not altogether, as of right. However, in _very
exceptional cases_ where it is clear that setting aside the writ of possession
would be an _exercise in futility_ , the court ought not to act in vain.
[emphasis added]

90 At this juncture, we should emphasise that there are three important
caveats to our (qualified) endorsement of _Faircharm_ ([77] _supra_). _First_
, the _Faircharm_ approach _does not_ hereafter represent the starting point
for all applications to set aside irregular default judgments; instead, the
_ex debito justitiae_ rule remains the starting point (see [74] above). The
_Faircharm_ approach is applied _only where_ the _ex debito justitiae_ rule is
not followed, such that the court has to consider whether the irregular
default judgment in question should nonetheless be set aside on some other
ground – specifically, on the basis of the merits of the defence. _Second_ ,
in most cases where an irregular default judgment is entered, the plaintiff
would have been in default of some procedural rule. _Prima facie_ , it should
not be allowed to take advantage of its own non-compliance with the rules;
correspondingly, the defendant should not be placed in the same position as,
or in a more disadvantageous position than, a defendant whose default resulted
in the plaintiff properly obtaining a regular default judgment. An undesirable
outcome (where the plaintiff is not penalised and, in fact, gains an advantage
from entering an irregular default judgment) could result if the _Faircharm_
approach is rigidly applied regardless of the nature of the irregularity and
the overall justice of the case. As such, it is essential that the courts
adopt a nuanced approach when applying the “bound to lose” test. _Third_ , the
decision in _Faircharm_ must be viewed against the particular factual matrix
of that case, especially Faircharm’s summary judgment application, which
resulted in the order that Citibank assign to Faircharm all of Citibank’s
beneficial interest in the Life Policy (see [81] above). In particular, the
court should be wary of interpreting Sir Staughton’s statement in _Faircharm_
that “Citibank would be bound to lose on an application for summary judgment”
as intimating that the “bound to lose” test is synonymous with the test for
determining whether summary judgment should be entered in an O 14 application
(as to which, see [48] above). The two tests are _not_ the same.

_How an application to set aside an irregular default judgment should
henceforth be assessed_

91 In view of our (qualified) endorsement of _Faircharm_ , an application to
set aside an irregular default judgment should now be assessed as follows. The
_ex debito justitiae_ rule remains, as stated earlier, the starting point (see
[74] and [90] above). In this regard, the court will be particularly ready to
set aside an irregular default judgment if egregious procedural injustice has
been occasioned to the defendant (_eg_ , where the judgment was entered
prematurely or where the defendant had no notice of the proceedings against it
(see [76] above)). In these instances, given that the essence of due process
has not been observed, the court is _not_ minded, on policy grounds, to depart
from the _ex debito justitiae_ rule.

92 Where an irregular default judgment is not set aside as of right, the court
will then have to consider whether there is sufficient reason to nonetheless
set aside the irregular judgment on some other basis (apart from the _ex
debito justitiae_ rule). At this juncture, one of the most crucial factors to
be considered is the merits of the defence (see [87] above). The burden lies
on the plaintiff to show that the defendant is “bound to lose” (_per_ Sir
Staughton in _Faircharm_ ([77] _supra_)) even if the irregular default
judgment is set aside and the matter re-litigated (see further [98] below). In
this regard, the _Faircharm_ approach, which is pegged at a _lower_ standard
than that embodied in the “arguable or triable issue” test _vis-à-vis_ the
setting aside of regular default judgments, is a fair and just one. In our
view, the “bound to lose” test properly reflects the different policy
considerations which feature where the defendant seeks to set aside an
_irregular_ default judgment as opposed to a _regular_ default judgment – in
the former, there would (in most cases) have been procedural injustice
occasioned by an act of the plaintiff, whereas this is absent in the latter
scenario (see also [43] above). As such, to avoid prejudice to the defendant,
the less exacting “bound to lose” standard ought to apply when the defendant
is seeking to set aside an irregular default judgment in this scenario (_ie_ ,
in a case where the _ex debito justitiae_ rule is not followed, such that the
court has to go on to assess whether to nonetheless set aside the irregular
default judgment in view of, _inter alia_ , the merits of the defence).

93 Should the court ultimately decide, after taking into account (_inter
alia_) the merits of the defence as assessed based on the _Faircharm_
approach, not to set aside the irregular default judgment, the judgment will
be upheld, subject to:

(a) any variation which the court may make pursuant to its discretion under O
2 r 1(2), O 13 r 8 (_vis-à-vis_ irregular O 13 default judgments), O 19 r 9
(_vis-à-vis_ irregular O 19 default judgments) or O 20 r 11 (_vis-à-vis_
“[c]lerical mistakes in judgments or orders, or errors arising therein from
any accidental slip or omission”) to cure the irregularity; and/or

(b) any terms which the court may impose pursuant to its discretion under O 2
r 1(2).

In this regard, we should point out that where the court decides to uphold an
irregular default judgment while, at the same time, amending the judgment so
as to rectify the irregularity therein, the court may invoke O 20 r 11 only if
the irregularity consists _specifically_ of a clerical mistake or an
accidental slip or omission in the judgment (_eg_ , misstatement of the
quantum of the judgment sum due to an inadvertent typographical error; see
also _Philip Securities (Pte) v Yong Tet Miaw_ [1988] SLR 594). Where the
irregularity is not occasioned by an accidental or a clerical error, O 20 r 11
is not applicable (see, _eg_ , _Malayan United Bank Bhd v Mohammed Salleh bin
Mohammed Yusoff_ [1988] 3 MLJ 165); the court would then have to invoke O 2 r
1(2) or, alternatively, depending on whether the irregular default judgment is
an O 13 default judgment or an O 19 default judgment, either O 13 r 8 or O 19
r 9 respectively.

94 In our view, _BCCI v Habib Bank_ ([76] _supra_) is a good illustration of
when it would be apt to uphold an irregular default judgment – which is not
set aside _ex debito justitiae_ – on the ground that the defendant would be
“bound to lose” as stated in _Faircharm_ ([77] _supra_) even if the irregular
default judgment were set aside. In that case, the plaintiff issued a writ
claiming, _inter alia_ , a sum of US$683,062.10 against the defendant, and
subsequently obtained an O 13 default judgment for that sum. By the time the
default judgment was entered, the plaintiff was aware that the correct figure
was US$613,756 instead, but it nonetheless proceeded to obtain judgment for
the higher (and incorrect) amount of US$683,062.10. Park J dismissed the
defendant’s setting-aside application, pointing out (see _BCCI v Habib Bank_
at 47) that the defendant, via the affidavits which it filed for its setting-
aside application, had tacitly conceded that it owed the plaintiff US$613,756.
He thus upheld the default judgment, albeit with the sum of US$683,062.10
varied to US$613,756. Although _Faircharm_ was apparently neither brought to
the attention of nor considered by Park J, his comments (see _BCCI v Habib
Bank_ at 46), which are set out below, echo the position taken by the English
Court of Appeal in _Faircharm_ :

_If_ , from the affidavits and exhibits, _the court concludes that, even
though there were irregularities in the writ or the judgment or both, the
substantive content of the judgment is right, the court will not set the
judgment aside. The only effect if it did would be to put the parties to
further expense and delay to reach a regular judgment for the same amount._
Further, it is the same in principle _if_ the court is satisfied from the
affidavits and exhibits that, _although the amount in the default judgment was
wrong, it (the court) knows what the correct amount was_. The court will not
set the incorrect judgment aside and make the plaintiff start again. It will
vary the judgment to the correct amount. [emphasis added]

_**Synopsis of the legal principles applicable to setting-aside

95 To summarise, where the default judgment sought to be set aside is a
_regular_ one, the _Evans v Bartlam_ test (_ie_ , whether the defendant can
show a _prima facie_ defence that raises triable or arguable issues) is
preferable to the _Saudi Eagle_ test both in principle and as a matter of
practical application.

96 Where the default judgment sought to be set aside is an _irregular_ one,
setting aside as of right (_viz_ , the _ex debito justitiae_ rule) remains the
starting point, especially in cases where the irregularity consists of the
premature entry of a default judgment or a failure to give proper notice of
the proceedings to the defendant – _ie_ , in cases where there has been
egregious procedural injustice to the defendant. This starting point may,
however, be departed from where there are proper grounds for doing so. The
court has an unfettered discretion to decide whether the _ex debito justitiae_
rule should be followed, and, in exercising this discretion, it may take into
account, among other factors (see also [76] above):

(a) the blameworthiness of the respective parties (_eg_ , whether there has
been undue delay on the defendant’s part in making its setting-aside
application);

(b) whether the defendant has admitted liability under the default judgment;
and

(c) whether the defendant would be unduly prejudiced if the irregular default
judgment is allowed to stand.

In those instances where the court is of the view that there has been no
procedural injustice of such an egregious nature as to warrant setting aside
the irregular default judgment as of right, the court has to go on to consider
whether to nonetheless set aside the irregular default judgment on some other
basis apart from the _ex debito justitiae_ rule. To this end, it is crucial
for the court to take into account the merits of the defence. Should the court
find that the defendant is “bound to lose” (_per_ Sir Staughton in _Faircharm_
([77] _supra_)) if the default judgment is set aside and the matter re-
litigated, the court should ordinarily uphold the default judgment, subject to
any variation which the court deems fit to make and/or any terms which it
deems fit to impose.

97 In both types of setting-aside applications – _ie_ , relating to regular
and irregular default judgments respectively – the defendant’s delay in making
the application is a relevant consideration and may be determinative where
there has been undue delay (see [30]–[36] above). As a rule of thumb, the
longer the delay, the more cogent the merits of the setting-aside application
have to be.

98 Although the issue of whether the defendant has a defence on the merits is
now a crucial factor with regard to both the setting aside of regular default
judgments and (where the _ex debito justitiae_ rule is not followed) the
setting aside of irregular default judgments, an important distinction remains
between these two types of setting-aside applications. Where the default
judgment has been _regularly_ obtained, the legal burden rests on the
defendant to show that its defence raises triable issues so that,
notwithstanding its default which resulted in judgment being properly entered
against it, the court should exercise its discretion to deprive the plaintiff
of its rights under the (regular) default judgment. In contrast, where it is
alleged that the default judgment was _irregularly_ obtained, the defendant
only needs to establish the irregularity, whether factual or legal (see, _eg_
, _Purwadi v Ung Hooi Leng_ [2003] 4 SLR 292). Once the defendant discharges
this burden and the court finds that the alleged irregular judgment is indeed
irregular, the legal burden falls on the plaintiff to show (based on the
factors outlined at [76] and [96] above) why the judgment should not be set
aside. Even if the plaintiff succeeds in persuading the court that the _ex
debito justitiae_ rule should not be followed, the court may nonetheless still
set aside the irregular default judgment in view of (_inter alia_) the
apparent merits of the defence. As such, where the plaintiff has established
that the irregular default judgment should not be set aside as of right, the
plaintiff will _also_ have to go on to show that the defendant is “bound to
lose” (_per_ Sir Staughton in _Faircharm_ ([77] _supra_)) in the event that
the judgment in question is set aside and the matter re-litigated. The
defendant’s setting-aside application will ordinarily be dismissed only if the
plaintiff manages to convince the court _both_ that, first, the _ex debito
justitiae_ rule should not be followed _and_ , second, the defence is bound to
fail. In other words, where the defendant seeks to set aside a _regular_
default judgment, it is for the _defendant_ to establish the merits of its
defence (based on _the_ Evans v Bartlam _test_). In contrast, where the
defendant seeks to set aside an _irregular_ default judgment, it is for the
_plaintiff_ to show (after it has successfully persuaded the court that the
_ex debito justitiae_ rule should not be applied) the lack of merit in the
defence – based on _the “bound to lose” test_ – for the purposes of countering
the defendant’s setting-aside application.

99 At the end of the day, given the court’s wide discretion as to whether to
set aside, uphold or vary a default judgment, the list of factors which the
court may take into account when ruling on a setting-aside application is
open-ended. We do not wish to lay down determinative guidelines as to which of
these factors ought to prevail so as not to impose any fetters on the court’s
discretion (for instance, a case could conceivably arise where the plaintiff’s
procedural default offends the essence of due process, but, at the same time,
the defendant’s defence is bound to fail). As this court stated in _Lee Chee
Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor_ [2007] 3 SLR 537 at [82] apropos the nexus between
procedural and substantive justice:

The rules of court practice and procedure exist to provide a convenient
framework to facilitate dispute resolution and to serve the ultimate and
overriding objective of justice. Such an objective must never be eclipsed by
blind or pretended fealty to rules of procedure. On the other hand, a
pragmatic approach governed by justice as its overarching aim should not be
viewed as a charter to ignore procedural requirements. _In the ultimate
analysis, each case involving procedural lapses or mishaps must be assessed in
its proper factual matrix and calibrated by reference to the paramount
rationale of dispensing even[-]handed justice_. [emphasis added]

Unnecessary fetters should not be judicially created when the Rules of Court
have themselves conferred on the court an extraordinarily wide discretion to
deal with procedural irregularities. In the ultimate analysis, it must be the
factual matrix itself that determines the appropriate outcome of each setting-
aside application.

Whether the Default Judgment should have been set aside

100 Having set out the relevant legal principles applicable to setting-aside
applications, we now consider how these principles should have been applied to
SUM 1843 had we not made the order which we eventually did (_viz_ , that the
Default Judgment be deemed to be set aside if Mercurine succeeds in the
Consolidated Suit, inclusive of any appeals therefrom).

101 As mentioned earlier (at [91] and [96] above), we would have first
considered whether the Default Judgment (which was irregular) ought to be set
aside as of right. The Default Judgment consisted of, _inter alia_ , two
discrete parts – the Possession Order and the Money Judgment. It was not
disputed that there were flaws in both parts of the Default Judgment: the
former, because the requisite certificate under O 13 r 4(1) of the Rules of
Court had not been obtained, and, the latter, because the quantum stated
therein was excessive. In our view, neither of these irregularities resulted
in such egregious procedural injustice to Mercurine as to warrant the setting
aside of the Possession Order and the Money Judgment as of right. As far as
the defect in the Possession Order was concerned, Mercurine admitted that it
had not been prejudiced by Canberra’s failure to produce the certificate
required under O 13 r 4(1). As for the Money Judgment, Mercurine did not
dispute that it was liable to Canberra for the sum of $725,116.81 at the time
that the Default Judgment was entered. As such, Mercurine would not be unduly
prejudiced if the Money Judgment were allowed to stand.

102 Having decided that the _ex debito justitiae_ rule should not be applied,
we would then have considered, _inter alia_ , the merits of Mercurine’s
defence (as evaluated based on the “bound to lose” test laid down in
_Faircharm_ ([77] _supra_)) so as to decide whether the Default Judgment
should be set aside on some other basis apart from the _ex debito justitiae_
rule (see [92] and [96] above). In view of the pending trial of the
Consolidated Suit, it is not appropriate for us to comment on the merits of
Mercurine’s defence in the present suit (_ie_ , Suit 861) as that could have
an impact on the outcome of the Consolidated Suit. Suffice it to say that, in
our view, if Mercurine’s defence to Canberra’s claim for possession of the
Premises is not bound to fail under the _Faircharm_ approach, the _Possession
Order_ would ordinarily have been set aside. The position is different,
however, where the _Money Judgment_ is concerned. In view of the position
taken by the parties to date _vis-à-vis_ Canberra’s claim for unpaid rent (see
[101] above), it was patently clear that Mercurine would be bound to lose in
respect of Canberra’s claim for the undisputed sum of $725,116.81. In this
regard, we also note that it was common ground that the Money Judgment had
been satisfied by Mercurine’s payment of the Compromise Sum; what was disputed
was whether the payment of this sum had satisfied the rest of the Default
Judgment as well. As such, no useful purpose would be served if the Money
Judgment were set aside. In the light of the approach taken in _BCCI v Habib
Bank_ ([76] _supra_), which we concur with, we would ordinarily have upheld
the Money Judgment (albeit as amended by the Judge so as to reflect the
correct quantum due to Canberra (see [19] above)). However, as the Judge
rightly pointed out (see [19] above), the Possession Order and the Money
Judgment were not severable from each other since Mercurine intended to rely
on the same defence against Canberra’s claims for both unpaid rent and
possession of the Premises. Therefore, we ordered that the Default Judgment
_as a whole_ would be deemed to be set aside if Mercurine succeeds in the
Consolidated Suit.

103 At this juncture, we must emphasise that the decision which we would have
made in respect of the Money Judgment (had we not made the order which we
ultimately did) should not be read as endorsing a pro-amendment approach
towards every default judgment entered for an excessive amount which the
plaintiff later attempts to amend by substituting the correct sum. In the
instant case, had the Money Judgment not already been satisfied by Mercurine’s
payment of the Compromise Sum _before_ SUM 1843 was heard by AR Lim (see [14]
above), a less accommodating stance towards Canberra’s conscious delay in
applying to amend the Default Judgment might have been justified.

An aside on the question of costs in setting-aside applications

104 Although the question of the appropriate costs order to make in a setting-
aside application was not a live issue before this court, we take this
opportunity to set out our views on it, especially since, in the light of the
more nuanced approach which we have laid down _vis-à-vis_ the setting aside of
irregular default judgments, additional questions could arise as to which
party is liable for costs (_eg_ , where the court allows an irregular default
judgment to stand because the defendant would be bound to lose if the matter
were re-litigated).

105 Typically, if a _regular_ default judgment is set aside because the
defence has sufficient merit, the _defendant_ bears the costs of the setting-
aside application. Conversely, the _plaintiff_ would usually be liable for
costs when an _irregular_ default judgment is set aside.

106 If an irregular default judgment is not set aside, however, it does not
follow that the defendant must therefore bear the costs of the failed setting-
aside application. Without wishing to set inflexible guidelines that could
stymie the discretion of the lower courts, we would suggest that, as a general
principle, the usual rule that costs follow the event should _not_ be the
starting point in an application to set aside an _irregular_ default judgment.
Depending on the nature of and the reasons for the irregularity, it may well
be appropriate to order the plaintiff to bear the costs of the setting-aside
application – or, perhaps, even to make no order as to costs where, _inter
alia_ , the court upholds the irregular judgment because the defendant has not
been prejudiced by the plaintiff’s procedural breach (if any) and is “bound to
lose” (_per_ Sir Staughton in _Faircharm_ ([77] _supra_)) if the matter is re-
litigated (a similar position obtains where an irregular default judgment is
upheld because the defendant has acknowledged liability notwithstanding the
plaintiff’s procedural breach).

Conclusion

107 To recapitulate, we allowed this appeal because we were of the view that
Mercurine’s delay in filing SUM 1843 was not fatal. However, instead of
setting aside the Default Judgment outright, we ordered that it be deemed to
be set aside if Mercurine succeeds in the Consolidated Suit, inclusive of any
appeals therefrom. We also endorsed the Judge’s decision to amend the Default
Judgment so as to reflect the correct quantum due to Canberra (see [19]
above). Thus, if the Default Judgment ultimately stands, it will be for the
reduced sum of $725,116.81 only. We would further underline that we have not
expressed any definitive views on the actual merits of Mercurine’s defence
(see item (d) at [21] above) as it was not necessary for us to consider this
particular issue given the analysis which we adopted. We note, however, that
it is plain and, indeed, undisputed that there are a good number of issues
meriting further and more acute scrutiny in the Consolidated Suit.
