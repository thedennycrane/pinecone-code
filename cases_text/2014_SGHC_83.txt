Woo Bih Li J:

1 I refer to my judgment dated 10 April 2014 (“the Judgment”). It has come to
my attention that I should make some formal orders in response to the prayers
for relief in the three actions mentioned in the Judgment, although the
outcomes are obvious from the Judgment.

2 For the avoidance of doubt, I state the following in addition to the
Judgment. The definitions therein will apply here as well.

Suit 964

3 There is no need for a formal order in respect of the first prayer of the
claim by Columbia for damages to be assessed for over-payment for the Sale
Shares and/or the diminution in value of PTNM and/or the Sale Shares and/or
receiving title to the Land that is encumbered as I have already granted
Columbia the costs of cure to be assessed for the Encumbrance Issue.

4 The second prayer of the claim by Columbia is addressed by the orders in the
Judgment.

5 I dismiss all the Hongs’ prayers for relief in their counterclaim in Suit
964.

Suit 861

6 I dismiss PTNM’s counterclaim for damages for allegedly defective servers.

7 I make no order on the first prayer of the claim against the Hongs in the
third party action which is a prayer for a declaration that the claims of
Thermal Industries are within the meaning of “Liabilities” as defined in s
2.1.24 of the SSA. The first prayer is unnecessary in the light of the orders
made in the Judgment.

8 The second prayer of the claim against the Hongs is already addressed
substantively by the orders made in the Judgment.

9 I dismiss the third prayer for a declaration that Thermal Industries is the
_alter ego_ of Edward Hong. As stated in the Judgment, Thermal Industries is
entitled to make its claim whether or not it is controlled by Edward Hong.

10 I dismiss the Hongs’ counterclaim for an order rectifying s 2.1.24 of the
SSA.

Suit 862

11 I make no order on the first prayer of the claim against the Hongs in the
third party action which is a prayer for a declaration that the claims of
Thermal International are within the meaning of “Liabilities” in s 2.1.24 of
the SSA. The first prayer is unnecessary in the light of the orders made in
the Judgment.

12 The second prayer of the claim against the Hongs is already addressed
substantively by the orders made in the Judgment.

13 I dismiss the third prayer for a declaration that Thermal International is
the _alter ego_ of Edward Hong.

14 I dismiss the Hongs’ counterclaim for an order rectifying s 2.1.24 of the
SSA.

General

15 I amend the beginning of [356(c)] of the Judgment to read as follows:

“In respect of the Tax _Exposure_ Issue _and the Inflated Revenue Issue_ , …”
(amendments underlined).

16 This supplementary judgment is to take effect from the date of the
Judgment.
