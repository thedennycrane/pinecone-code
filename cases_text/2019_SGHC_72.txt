15 March 2019 Judgment reserved.

Chan Seng Onn J:

Introduction

1 The accused, Ewe Pang Kooi (“Ewe”), claimed trial to a total of 50 charges
under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 22 charges under the 1985 Rev Ed; 28
charges under the 2008 Rev Ed) for criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) by an
agent. Given that there was no amendment made to s 409 in the 2008 amendments
to the Penal Code, I shall hereinafter refer to both the 1985 Rev Ed and 2008
Rev Ed of the Penal Code as “the Code”.

2 The charges faced by Ewe can be divided into three broad categories:

(a) Charges relating to Ewe’s role as liquidator for 21 companies (“the
liquidator charges”);

(b) One charge relating to Ewe’s role as receiver for the assets of one Prem
Ramchand Harjani (“Harjani”) (“the receiver charge”); and

(c) Charges relating to Ewe’s role as manager for the bank accounts of
Technology Partners International (“TPI”) Singapore Branch (“the TPI
charges”).

3 An example of one of the liquidator charges is set out as follows: 1

said funds into various bank accounts and withdrawing the funds for your own
purposes, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section
409 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, Revised Edition 2008).

5 An example of one of the TPI charges is set out as follows:

the way of your business as an agent, in that you, being at the material time
the certified public accountant and an agent of Technology Partners
International, Inc. Singapore Branch (“TPI”) and in such capacity was

dishonestly misappropriate a total sum of … , by transferring the said funds
into various bank accounts and withdrawing the funds for your own purposes,
and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 409 of the
Penal Code (Chapter 223, …).

6 At the end of the trial, I reserved judgment. Having considered the evidence
before me and the submissions made by both parties, I find that the
Prosecution has made out all 50 charges against Ewe beyond reasonable doubt.
Accordingly, I convict Ewe of all 50 charges. I now state my reasons.

Undisputed facts

7 The Defence and the Prosecution have agreed to a comprehensive statement of
agreed facts (“SOAF”), the material parts of which are set out below.

Facts relating to Ewe

8 Ewe is a 65 year-old male Malaysian citizen with Singapore permanent
resident status. At all material times, he held professional qualifications as
both a Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”) as well as an Approved Liquidator
registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. He was also
the managing partner of Ewe Loke & Partners (“ELP”), a Certified Public
Accounting firm, and a director of E & M Management Consultants Pte Ltd
(“EM”), a firm in the business of providing tax and financial consulting and
corporate restructuring services.

9 ELP was registered on 2 September 1998. From 2002 to July 2012, the partners
of ELP were Ewe, one Loke Poh Keun (“Loke”), and one Mitsuru Morii (“Morii”).
Another accountant, one Farooq Mann (“Farooq”), acted jointly with Ewe as
liquidator for some of the companies. EM was registered on 20 July 1990 by
Morii and Ewe. Subsequently, in early 1992, Loke was appointed as an
additional director. 2

Facts relating to the role of a liquidator and receiver as set out by the
parties

10 I reproduce the key portions of the parties’ SOAF on the role of a
liquidator and receiver below.

11 A liquidator is an officer appointed when a company goes into winding up or
liquidation. When a company is being wound up, the company’s business ceases
to operate and its assets and affairs are handed over to a liquidator, whose
powers, duties and functions are set out in s 272 of the Companies Act (Cap
50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the CA”). The liquidator’s roles include the following: 3

##### Foot Note 3

×

SOAF, para 7.

(a) Investigate into the affairs and assets of the company, the conduct of its
officers and the claims of creditors and third parties;

(b) Recover and realise the company’s assets in the most advantageous manner
to the company;

(c) Adjudicate the claims of creditors and ensure an equitable distribution of
the company’s assets in accordance with the provisions of the CA.

12 When a company goes into receivership, all assets of the company will be
transferred into the control of a receiver. A receiver may be appointed by the
court or a creditor, and he is entrusted with custody of the property of the
company, including its tangible and intangible assets and rights. His
responsibility is to liquidate all available assets and rights of the company,
and ensure as much debt as possible is repaid to the creditors. 4

##### Foot Note 4

×

SOAF, para 8.

13 When the accused was appointed as a liquidator or receiver by the
companies, he was authorised to have control over the bank accounts and assets
of the companies, in order for him to make payments to creditors and to
recover the companies’ assets. 5

Facts relating to the receiver charge

50th Charge: TRC 900029/2015

17 Ewe was appointed as the receiver to take control of the assets owned by
Harjani. Ewe deposited the following cheques amounting to S$680,990.82 into
ELP’s Maybank Clients’ account which represented the assets of Harjani that he
received on behalf of Merril Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
(“Merril Lynch”).

Date of cheque| Amount (S$)  
---|---  
11 November 2010| 378,981.90  
13 April 2011| 248,194.10  
13 April 2011| 53,814.82  
  
18 Between 13 November 2010 and 15 April 2011, Ewe issued the following
cheques from ELP’s Maybank Clients’ account. These cheques amounted to a total
of S$680,000, which were made payable to the stated payees:

Date of cheque| Amount (S$)| Payee  
---|---|---  
13 November 2010| 150,000.00| Cash  
15 November 2010| 150,000.00| Cash  
24 November 2010| 80,000.00| Cash  
14 April 2011| 150,000.00| Cash  
14 April 2011| 20,000.00| EM  
15 April 2011| 130,000.00| Cash  
  
19 The moneys which were deposited into ELP’s Maybank Clients’ account were
subsequently withdrawn by Ewe. Based on the withdrawals from the said clients’
account:

(a) The sum of S$378,981.90 deposited on 11 November 2010 had been wholly
withdrawn by the accused through the above cheques drawn from the clients’
account;

(b) From the sums of S$247,194.10 and S$53,814.82 deposited on 13 April 2011,
S$300,000 was withdrawn by the accused through the above cheques drawn from
the clients’ account.

20 The accused used these moneys which he had obtained to gamble, to repay
gambling debts, or to reinstate the amounts he had removed from other
companies’ accounts previously.

21 None of the above moneys were used to pay for any expenses relating to
Harjani. As a result, Ewe misused $678,981.90 belonging to Harjani. 8

SOAF, paras 150 – 153.

Facts relating to the TPI charges

22 In 2007, TPI engaged EM to manage its Singapore branch’s Standard Chartered
bank account. Pursuant to this purpose, Ewe was appointed as one of four
signatories of TPI Singapore Branch’s bank account.

23 The officers of TPI Singapore Branch were one Gerald Clark and one Arno
Franz. They, together with Ewe and Morii, were the four signatories of TPI
Singapore Branch’s bank account. Ewe was made one of the authorised
signatories of TPI Singapore Branch’s bank account as part of EM’s engagement
to provide bank account management services to TPI Singapore Branch. To make
any authorised withdrawal from TPI Singapore Branch’s bank account, approval
from Gerald Clark was required.

24 As two signatories were required for cheque withdrawals or fund transfers
from the bank account, Ewe asked Morii to pre-sign blank cheques and transfer
request forms. Morii did so as he trusted Ewe.

25 Using the pre-signed cheques, Ewe either issued cash cheques from TPI’s
bank accounts or cheques to a bank account of ELP or EM. 9

SOAF, paras 154 – 157.

26 In summary, between December 2007 and July 2012, Ewe used the moneys from
TPI Singapore Branch’s Standard Chartered Bank account to gamble, to repay
gambling debts, or to reinstate the amounts that he had removed from other
companies’ accounts previously. The specific facts pertaining to each of the
charges involving Ewe acting in his capacity as manager for the bank account
of TPI Singapore Branch are set out in the Annex (see [A.134] to [A.151]). 10

##### Foot Note 10

×

SOAF, paras 158 – 176.

The order in which the facts pertaining to each of the charges are set out in
the Annex follow the exact sequence as they appear in the SOAF.

27 In total, Ewe had misappropriated close to $41 million from various
entities over the course of approximately 10 years.

The elements of CBT by an agent under s 409 of the Code

28 Section 409 of the Code states:

Criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant, or agent

409. Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, in his capacity of a public servant, or in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine. [emphasis added]

29 To make out the charges under s 409 of the Code, the Prosecution has to
prove that the following elements are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt:

(a) Ewe was entrusted with dominion over the moneys;

(b) the entrustment was done by way of Ewe’s business as an agent;

(c) Ewe misappropriated the said moneys; and

(d) Ewe did so dishonestly.

The parties’ cases

30 Given that the elements of entrustment with dominion and dishonest
misappropriation are not disputed by the Defence, parties understandably focus
their submissions on the element of whether Ewe was entrusted with the moneys
in the way of his business as an agent.

Prosecution’s case

31 The Prosecution submits that in order to establish that Ewe was entrusted
with the moneys in the way of his business as an agent, it must be shown that:
11

##### Foot Note 11

×

Prosecution’s Closing Submissions (“PCS”), para 42.

(a) First, Ewe was a “professional agent”; and

(b) Second, the moneys were entrusted to him “in the way of his business” as
such agent.

32 In relation to the first requirement, the Prosecution argues that in his
capacity as liquidator for the 21 companies, receiver for Harjani on behalf of
Merril Lynch, and manager for the bank accounts of TPI Singapore Branch, Ewe
was acting as the agent of the 21 companies, Merril Lynch and TPI Singapore
Branch respectively. This is on the basis that he was authorised by these
entities to act on their behalf, and that his actions could bind these
entities vis-à-vis third parties. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

PCS, paras 45, 46, 49 and 51.

The Prosecution further submits that Ewe was a professional agent given that
he was offering his agency services to the community at large, and that he
made a living from providing these agency services. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

PCS, para 52.

33 In relation to the second requirement, the Prosecution argues that Ewe was
entrusted with dominion over the moneys in the course of the commercial
activities that he had to undertake as liquidator, receiver and manager for
the bank accounts of TPI Branch Singapore. The Prosecution further states that
the entrustment of dominion over the moneys was an integral and necessary
element of the jobs that Ewe had been appointed to perform. 14

##### Foot Note 14

×

PCS, paras 61 and 62.

Defence’s case

34 First, the Defence argues that the business of a professional agent is
similar to that of an insurance or property agent. 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

DCS, para 35.

Therefore, given that Ewe’s principal business was in his practice as a CPA,
16

##### Foot Note 16

×

DCS, para 30.

he was never in the business of a professional agent, nor did he hold himself
out as providing professional agency services.

35 Second, the Defence argues that it was ELP, and not Ewe personally, that
was engaged to be the liquidator for the 21 companies and receiver of
Harjani’s assets on behalf of Merrill Lynch. Similarly, it was EM, and not Ewe
personally, that was appointed as manager of the bank accounts for TPI
Singapore Branch. 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

DCS, paras 80, 82, 84 and 85.

Ewe had only acted in his capacity as agent for ELP and EM, and had only
performed work in the course of the business of ELP and EM. 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

DCS, para 75(b)(iv), (v) and 82(b).

Therefore, Ewe was not even an agent of the 21 companies, Merrill Lynch, or
TPI, let alone a professional agent.

My decision

36 Given the undisputed facts before me, and the manner in which Ewe was
entrusted with dominion over the moneys in the course of his various
appointments as liquidator, receiver, and manager of the bank accounts for TPI
Singapore branch, I am satisfied that all 50 charges against Ewe have been
made out beyond reasonable doubt.

37 At the outset, I note that Ewe does not deny that when he was appointed as
liquidator of the 21 companies and receiver for the assets of Harjani, he had
been entrusted with the moneys stated in all the charges save for the TPI
charges. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

Defence’s Closing Submissions (“DCS”), para 25.

With regard to the TPI charges, upon closer scrutiny of the Defence’s Closing
Submissions, it appears that the Defence does not actually dispute that Ewe
had been entrusted with the moneys belonging to TPI, only that he was
entrusted with the moneys in his capacity as the “certified public accountant”
and “agent” of TPI. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

DCS, para 27.

38 Further, Ewe does not deny that, having been entrusted with these moneys,
he had dishonestly misappropriated the said moneys. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

DCS, para 25.

39 Therefore, the Defence does not dispute that elements (a), (c) and (d) of
the offence under s 409 of the Code (as set out at [29] above) have been made
out. For completeness, I will briefly address these elements, before moving to
consider the primary issue of whether Ewe had been entrusted with the said
moneys in the way of his business as an agent.

Whether Ewe was entrusted with dominion over the moneys

40 It is clear from the SOAF that Ewe was entrusted with dominion over the
moneys in his various roles as liquidator for the 21 companies, receiver for
Harjani, and manager for the bank account of TPI Singapore Branch. A general
degree of control over the moneys is sufficient to establish dominion and
there is no need to prove sole or exclusive dominion: see Hon Chi Wan Colman v
Public Prosecutor [2002] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [50] and [54]. Having been appointed
liquidator for the 21 companies, Ewe was able to transfer the assets of these
21 companies upon the commencement of liquidation into bank accounts for which
he was an authorised signatory. Similarly, having been appointed receiver for
the assets of Harjani, Ewe was able to transfer Harjani’s assets into a bank
account for which he was an authorised signatory. Upon being engaged to manage
the bank account of TPI Singapore Branch, Ewe was made an authorised signatory
of the bank account. Even though two signatories were required to make any
transfers from the bank account, Ewe stated that he had asked Morii to pre-
sign cheques and transfer forms, which therefore allowed Ewe to unilaterally
make transfers. Ewe therefore had dominion over the moneys in TPI Singapore
Branch’s bank account.

Whether Ewe had dishonestly misappropriated the moneys which he was entrusted
with dominion over

41 It is also clear from the SOAF that Ewe had dishonestly misappropriated the
moneys which he was entrusted with. The SOAF repeatedly states that Ewe had
used the moneys that he had been entrusted with to gamble, to repay his own
gambling debts, or to reinstate the amounts that he had removed from other
companies’ accounts previously. It is also stated in the SOAF that none of the
amounts which were taken from each company were used to pay the expenses of
that particular company.

Whether Ewe was entrusted with the moneys in the way of his business as a
professional agent

42 The sole element of the offence that is in dispute is whether Ewe had been
entrusted with the moneys which he dishonestly misappropriated in the way of
his business as an agent within the meaning of s 409 of the Code. In my view,
the manner in which Ewe was entrusted with the moneys in his various roles as
liquidator, receiver and manager for the bank accounts of TPI Singapore
Branch, represents the quintessential case of an individual who has been
entrusted with moneys in the way of his business as a professional agent.

43 The scope and definition of the phrase “in the way of his business as … an
agent” in s 409 of the Code was recently considered by the Court of Appeal in
Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others [2018] 1 SLR 659 (“Lam Leng
Hung”). The Court of Appeal concluded at [286] that both the text and context
of s 409 indicate that “in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a
factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” only encompasses persons who are
entrusted with property or dominion over it in the course of the commercial
activities of their trusted trades or professions – including those who are in
the business of agency (ie, professional agents). The Court of Appeal further
defined a professional agent as “a person who offers, as his trade, profession
or business, agency services to interested clients in return for remuneration”
(at [126]) or “one who professes to offer his agency services to the community
at large and from which he makes his living” (at [285]). Therefore, in order
to make out this element of the offence under s 409 of the Code, the
Prosecution would have to prove (a) that Ewe’s various roles as liquidator,
receiver, and manager for the bank account of TPI Singapore Branch were those
of a “professional agent”, and (b) that he had been entrusted with the moneys
in the course of his business as a professional agent.

Whether Ewe’s various roles can be regarded as those of a professional agent

44 In my view, Ewe’s roles as liquidator for the 21 companies, receiver for
the assets of Harjani, and manager of the bank accounts of TPI Singapore
Branch all fall squarely within the meaning of a professional agent as defined
in Lam Leng Hung.

45 Based on the definition provided by the Court of Appeal, there appear to be
three requirements that have to be fulfilled for an individual to be regarded
as a professional agent:

(a) The individual offers agency services;

(b) The individual offers the said services to the community at large; and

(c) The individual receives remuneration for the said services.

46 In this regard, I note the Defence’s argument that an “agent” within the
meaning of s 409 of the Code only refers to agents that are similar to
insurance agents or property agents. Therefore, given that Ewe was at all
material times practicing as a CPA, he did not practice as a professional
agent nor did he make himself out to be one (see above at [34]). With respect,
this argument is untenable. The definition of a “professional agent” as stated
by the Court of Appeal in Lam Leng Hung is not restricted only to agents that
are similar to insurance agents or property agents. In my view, as long as the
three requirements set out at [45] above are met, an individual would be
regarded as a professional agent even if the other aspects of his duties are
dissimilar to that of an insurance agent or property agent. Further, while it
is true that Ewe had been practicing as a CPA at all material times, the
Defence neglects to mention that Ewe had also been practicing as a liquidator,
receiver, and manager for the bank accounts of TPI. Indeed, it is the
Prosecution’s case that Ewe was operating as a professional agent in his
various roles as liquidator, receiver, and manager for the bank account of
TPI, which I now turn to consider.

(1) Whether Ewe had provided agency services

47 In his roles as liquidator, receiver, and manager for the bank account, Ewe
had provided the 21 companies, Merrill Lynch, and TPI Singapore Branch
respectively with agency services. In Ong Han Ling and another v American
International Assurance Co Ltd and others [2018] 5 SLR 549, it was stated at
[214] that “[t]he classic definition of an agent is one authorised to create
contractual relations with third parties on behalf of the principal.”
Similarly, in Then Khek Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another
and other suits [2014] 1 SLR 245, the court stated at [113] that “the
irreducible core of any principal/agent relationship is a principal who
consensually confers actual, implied or ostensible authority upon the agent
and an agent who has the ability, by acting within the scope of his authority,
unilaterally to engage the principal’s civil liability.”

48 As liquidator of the 21 companies, Ewe was conferred with actual authority
to create contractual relations with third parties on behalf of these
companies, thereby making him an agent of these companies. It is settled law
that once a company is in liquidation, the board of directors is effectively
functus officio and the power to run the company vests with the liquidator:
see Walter Woon on Company Law (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell,
Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) at para 17.134. Indeed, as stated in the SOAF, Ewe’s
main responsibilities as a liquidator were to investigate into the affairs and
assets of the companies, recover and realise the companies’ assets in the most
advantageous manner, and ensure an equitable distribution of the companies’
assets to the creditors. In order to carry out his function as liquidator, Ewe
would, inter alia, have to make contracts with would-be purchasers of the
companies’ assets, commence suits on behalf of the companies to recover
payments or transfers which were wrongfully made, and make and receive
payments on behalf of the companies. Indeed, Ewe admitted during cross-
examination that upon the commencement of liquidation, control of the
company’s assets would rest solely in the hands of the liquidator. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 60, lines 17 – 19.

These actions would invariably bind the companies vis-à-vis third parties.

49 Similarly, as receiver for the assets of Harjani, Ewe was conferred with
actual authority by Merrill Lynch to realise Harjani’s assets for its benefit.
This therefore made him an agent of Merrill Lynch. Ewe explained that when a
creditor bank (such as Merrill Lynch) had a debenture over an entity which
allowed it to appoint a receiver and manager in the event of a default, and
when that entity subsequently defaulted, the creditor bank would then appoint
him as a receiver. 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 91, lines 11 – 18.

Ewe would then be tasked to take control of, consolidate, and liquidate the
assets of the entity and account for it to the creditor bank. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 92, lines 10 – 15.

In particular, as receiver for Harjani’s assets, Ewe had to liquidate shares
and property belonging to Harjani for and on behalf of Merrill Lynch. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 91, lines 23 – 28.

In order to liquidate these assets, it can reasonably be expected that Ewe
would have had to enter into sale and purchase contracts which would have
bound Merrill Lynch vis-à-vis third parties, thereby making Ewe an agent of
Merrill Lynch.

50 Finally, as the manager for TPI Singapore Branch’s bank account, Ewe was
also an agent for TPI. As part of the bank account management services that EM
provided to TPI, EM would have to monitor TPI’s bank account and inform Gerald
Clark when TPI received money from its customers, use the moneys in TPI’s bank
account to pay the salaries of TPI Singapore Branch’s employees, and remit the
moneys in the bank account to the United States once every three months. 26

It is stated in the SOAF that two signatories were required for cheque
withdrawals and/or fund transfers from the TPI’s bank account. However, Ewe
explained that he had asked Morii to pre-sign blank cheques and transfer
request forms, which Morii did as he trusted Ewe. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

SOAF, para 156.

Hence, Ewe effectively had control over TPI’s bank account and could make
cheque withdrawals and fund transfers unilaterally. Any payments or transfers
that Ewe made out of TPI’s bank account would therefore bind TPI vis-à-vis the
bank, making Ewe an agent of TPI.

51 At this juncture, I note that the Defence has argued that Ewe was merely an
agent for ELP and EM, and not an agent for the 21 companies, Harjani, or TPI
(see above at [35]). This was on the basis that it was ELP that was appointed
to provide the liquidation and receivership services, and EM that was
appointed to provide the bank account management services. With respect, I
disagree. First, in relation to the Defence’s contentions that it was ELP that
was appointed as liquidator/receiver, the documentary evidence shows that on
the contrary, it was Ewe who was personally appointed as liquidator/receiver.
The Defence itself cites the court order for the appointment of liquidators
for the winding up of Grandlink Group Pte Ltd, which states: 28

##### Foot Note 28

DCS, para 82.

Mr Ewe Pang Kooi … and Mr Loke Poh Kuen … both of M/s Ewe, Loke & Partners, be
appointed the liquidators of Grandlink Group Pte Ltd’s affairs …

Similarly, the court order for the appointment of the receiver over Harjani’s
assets states: 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

Exhibit P123.

… IT IS ORDERED that:-

1\. Ewe Pang Kooi … from M/s Ewe Loke & Partners … be appointed Receiver in
this action …

Indeed, it was Ewe himself, and not ELP, who had control over the assets of
the various entities and who could bind these entities vis-à-vis third
parties.

52 Second, in relation to the Defence’s contention that it was EM who was the
agent of TPI, it is also clear that it was Ewe himself who was appointed as
agent of TPI by virtue of him being made a signatory of TPI’s bank account.
The Standard Chartered bank nomination form states that Ewe was appointed as a
signatory by TPI. It was Ewe himself (using the cheques and transfer forms
which had been pre-signed by Morii), and not EM, who could make the payments
and transfers on behalf of TPI.

53 Ultimately, I agree with the Prosecution that to allow the Defence’s
argument to succeed would lead to an absurd conclusion, given that all natural
persons accused of CBT under s 409 of the Code would be able to escape
criminal liability simply by hiding behind the corporate shield. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

Prosecution’s Reply Submissions, para 13.

Such an argument also would not sit well with the other trades or professions
which are listed in s 409, ie, a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an
attorney. For example, a banker would ordinarily operate under the auspices of
a bank. Clients of the bank would ordinarily make contracts with the bank and
not with the banker personally. To find that the interposition of a corporate
entity, ie, the bank, would absolve the banker of liability would effectively
mean that no employee of the bank would ever be found guilty of an offence
under s 409.

54 To conclude on this point, I am of the view that Ewe had been providing
agency services through his various roles as liquidator, receiver, and manager
for TPI Singapore Branch’s bank account. I now turn to consider whether he had
offered these agency services to the community at large, and whether he
received remuneration for these services.

(2) Whether Ewe had offered his services to the community at large for
remuneration

55 It is apparent to me that Ewe had offered his services as a liquidator to
the community at large for three reasons:

(a) First, Ewe stated under cross-examination that ELP got its insolvency
clients through both referrals and walk-ins, which suggests that its
liquidation services were offered to the public. In this regard, I note that
Ewe had tried to draw a distinction between customers that ELP received via
referrals and walk-in customers. Ewe explained that because ELP was not a big-
name firm, it would rely mainly on referrals from Ewe’s social contacts for
clients. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 72 line 25 – p 73 line 32.

Taking Ewe’s case at its highest, this would mean that Ewe’s services were
essentially being offered to the community at large via Ewe’s social contacts.
Therefore, I found it immaterial whether Ewe received his clients from
referrals or walk-ins. In any event, Ewe conceded that ELP would also accept
walk-in clients, so long as they passed certain checks as to (a) their ability
to pay the liquidator’s fees; and (b) the absence of money-laundering or other
illegal activities. 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 78, lines 13 – 25.

(b) Second, Ewe stated that for court-ordered liquidations and creditors’
liquidations which require an approved liquidator, companies in need of such
services would approach ELP specifically because there were individuals in the
firm, such as Ewe, who were qualified as approved liquidators. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 55, lines 5 – 18.

(c) Third, Ewe admitted that he had offered his services as liquidator through
ELP, 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 53, lines 7 – 10.

and that he was able to act as liquidator in all three types of liquidations
ie, members’ voluntary liquidations, court ordered liquidations, and
creditors’ liquidations. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 51, lines 10 – 17.

Indeed, Ewe had acted as liquidator for 68 companies from 2007 to 2012. 36

##### Foot Note 36

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 61, lines 18 – 25.

ELP’s consolidated profit and loss accounts for the years 2007 to 2011 also
show that ELP had received income from providing “Insolvency” services for
each of the years. 37

##### Foot Note 37

Exhibit D1.

56 As regards remuneration, Ewe admitted under cross-examination to receiving
fees for the liquidation services that he provided. 38

##### Foot Note 38

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 81 line 4 – p 82 line 21.

57 Similarly, Ewe stated that his work as receiver was another one of the
services that were offered under ELP. 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 83, lines 17 – 20.

Specifically, in relation to the receivership of Harjani’s assets on behalf of
Merrill Lynch, Ewe stated that he was first approached by M/s Drew & Napier
LLC (“Drew & Napier”). When asked about how Drew & Napier had found out that
ELP provided receivership services, Ewe stated that it could be because ELP
was an approved liquidator and they would have the licence to do
receiverships. Ewe further stated that Drew & Napier had approached ELP for a
fee quotation, which ELP duly provided. 40

##### Foot Note 40

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 86 line 22 – p 87 line 1.

In my view, by holding itself out to be an approved liquidator which had the
license to perform insolvency related services such as liquidation and
receivership, ELP, and Ewe himself, were offering these services to the
community at large. The fact that a potential client like Drew & Napier could
ask ELP for a fee quotation serves to buttress this finding.

58 As regards remuneration, Ewe also admitted to receiving fees for the
receivership services that he provided. 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 93 line 32 – p 94 line 8.

59 Finally, in relation to the bank account management services which were
provided to TPI, I am also of the view that these services were provided to
the community at large, notwithstanding that TPI was the only entity that EM
had actually provided this service to. Ewe stated that the assignment to
manage the bank account of TPI’s Singapore Branch was referred to EM through
its membership in an international group of independent accountants known as
The International Accounting Group (“TIAG”). 42

##### Foot Note 42

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 31, lines 2 – 9; p 109, lines 20 – 26.

Ewe explained that the group of companies which included ELP and EM were the
only members of TIAG in Singapore, therefore any jobs to be done in Singapore
would be referred to them. Ewe further stated that although TPI was the only
company that EM provided this service to, he would also have been willing to
provide this service to other clients if the referring party was one that he
trusted. 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 110, lines 10 – 26; p 112, lines 3 – 15.

In my view, notwithstanding that Ewe imposed certain conditions which had to
be met before he would accept an assignment, the fact remained that he was
offering these bank account management services to the community at large via
his membership in TIAG. Ewe even admitted that if a referral for such services
came from a fellow member firm of TIAG, he would not be able to refuse the
referral because there was an understanding that the member firms would assist
each other. 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 112, lines 9 – 15.

60 As regards remuneration, the documentary evidence shows that EM had charged
TPI an annual fee of $3,600 for “professional services rendered in connection
with [EM’s] management of the bank account of [TPI] on [TPI’s] behalf”. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

Exhibit D3.

It is undisputed that Ewe would personally receive a cut of the fees that were
charged by EM. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

NE, 17 July 2018, p 12, lines 1 – 14.

61 To summarise my findings, I am of the view that Ewe’s services as
liquidator, receiver, and manager for bank accounts were offered to the
community at large, and that he was remunerated for performing these services.

62 Given that all three requirements as set out at [45] above have been made
out, it follows that Ewe had been acting as a professional agent. Further,
there can be no dispute that Ewe had been entrusted with the moneys in the
course of providing these professional agency services. Indeed, it was central
to Ewe’s roles as liquidator, receiver, and bank account manager for him to be
entrusted with dominion over the moneys. Therefore, the final element of the
offence under s 409 ie, that Ewe was entrusted with dominion over the moneys
in the way of his business as an agent, has been made out.

Conclusion

63 For the aforementioned reasons, I am satisfied that the 50 charges against
Ewe have been made out beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I would convict
Ewe of all 50 charges.

64 The provision for enhanced punishment in cases where CBT is committed by a
professional agent in the course of his business is necessary in safeguarding
the integrity of the commercial process. In Public Prosecutor v Tan Cheng Yew
[2013] 1 SLR 1095, Lee Seiu Kin J stated at [103] that

Where it is normal for the public to rely on a person’s trade as a mark of his
trustworthiness and integrity, and where such trust facilitates commercial
transactions, it is important that such transactions are above board. A
commission of CBT by a person in the performance of his trade would shake the
confidence of the public in those trades and impede the ability of persons in
such trades to serve the public. A breach of trust in such circumstances ‘may
have severe … public repercussions’.

The above passage was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Lam Leng
Hung at [463].

65 The reality of modern society is such that one cannot be expected to
undertake all tasks on his or her own. Therefore, there is a wide reliance by
the public on professional agents for various facets of commercial and
domestic activity. It is inherent in the duties of a professional agent to be
entrusted with the property of others. Therefore, it is only where the public
has utmost faith in the integrity of these professional agents that the system
can function and flourish. I am of the view that the financial services which
Ewe had provided all fall squarely within the exact type of mischief that s
409 was intended to curtail. If the public cannot trust its liquidators and
receivers to maintain high ethical and professional standards, the entire
insolvency process would undoubtedly fall apart.

66 I shall now hear parties’ submissions on sentence.
