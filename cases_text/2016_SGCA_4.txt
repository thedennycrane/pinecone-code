[2016] SGCA 04

Court of Appeal — Originating Summons No 21 of 2015 and Civil Appeals Nos 58,
59, 60 and 62 of 2015  
Sundaresh Menon CJ, Chao Hick Tin JA, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA, Judith

Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):

Introduction

1 The Chem Orchid (“the Vessel”) is a vessel built to carry oil and chemicals.
It was leased by Han Kook Capital Co, Ltd (“HKC”) to Sejin Maritime Co Ltd
(“Sejin”) on a demise charter. Due to certain unpaid debts owed by Sejin to
the four respondents in the present proceedings (collectively, “the
Creditors”), the Vessel was arrested in Singapore. The Creditors then filed
four separate in rem writs against the Vessel. By way of separate summonses,
HKC sought to set aside the Creditors’ in rem writs on the basis that the
court’s admiralty jurisdiction under the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction)
Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the HCAJA”) had not been properly invoked; in the
alternative, it sought to have the in rem writs struck out pursuant to O 18 r
19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) and/or under
the court’s inherent jurisdiction.

2 HKC contended that the court’s admiralty jurisdiction had not been properly
invoked because at the time the Creditors’ in rem writs were issued (“the
Relevant Time”), Sejin, the party who would be liable on the Creditors’ claims
in an action in personam, was no longer the demise charterer of the Vessel,
and thus, the condition specified in s 4(4)(i) of the HCAJA was not satisfied.
In support of this argument, HKC relied on a notice issued by its subsidiary,
HK AMC Co Ltd (“HKA”), to Sejin on 4 April 2011 (“the 4 April 2011 Notice”)
terminating Sejin’s demise charter of the Vessel. HKC submitted that in view
of that notice, there was no basis for the Creditors to invoke the court’s
admiralty jurisdiction under any of the grounds in s 3(1) of the HCAJA.

3 In the court below, the assistant registrar (“the AR”) set aside the
Creditors’ in rem writs (see The Chem Orchid [2014] SGHCR 1), but the High
Court judge (“the Judge”) allowed the Creditors’ appeals and reversed the AR’s
decision (see The Chem Orchid [2015] 2 SLR 1020 (“the HC Judgment”)). As four
different in rem writs were involved, four separate appeals were filed by HKC
against the Judge’s decision. Two of the Creditors – namely, Mercuria Energy
Trading SA (“Mercuria”), the respondent in Civil Appeal No 59 of 2015 (“CA
59/2015”), and Winplus Corporation Co, Ltd (“Winplus”), the respondent in
Civil Appeal No 62 of 2015 (“CA 62/2015”) – objected to HKC’s appeals on the
grounds that HKC needed leave from the Judge before it could appeal, but had
not obtained such leave. HKC then applied to this court via Originating
Summons No 21 of 2015 (“OS 21/2015”) for either: (a) a declaration that it did
not need leave of court to appeal against the Judge’s decision; or (b) in the
event that leave of court was needed, an extension of time to apply for leave
and the grant of such leave retrospectively.

4 We heard OS 21/2015 together with the four appeals by HKC against the
Judge’s decision. At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed OS 21/2015
and, as a corollary, also dismissed all four of HKC’s appeals. In our view,
given the way in which the case was presented, HKC’s appeals against the
Judge’s decision were in substance akin to appeals against the dismissal of an
application to strike out a writ action. Therefore, the appeals fell within s
34(1)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the
SCJA”) read with para (e) of the Fourth Schedule thereto. These two provisions
entail that no appeal can be brought to the Court of Appeal where (inter alia)
a judge makes an order refusing to strike out “an action or a matter commenced
by a writ of summons or by any other originating process”. In these grounds,
we explain our decision in greater detail.

The facts

5 HKC was the owner of the Vessel. On 1 February 2010, it entered into an
agreement to lease the Vessel to Sejin on a demise charter for a period of 108
months (“the Lease Agreement”). 1

The Lease Agreement was governed by South Korean law. Pursuant to the Lease
Agreement, Sejin was obliged to pay HKC monthly rental on the third day of
each month. 2

6 In December 2010, HKA was incorporated by HKC specifically to deal with the
recovery of bad debts owed to HKC. HKC issued a Notice of Credit Transfer
(“the NCT”) to Sejin, in which Sejin was informed of the following
arrangement: 5

…

2\. We hereby give a notice that we transfer following credit (hereinafter
referred to as the “Transfer Credit”, the amount as of November 30, 2010,
applicable exchange rate of 1,157.30 won/US$) in full to HK AMC Co., Ltd
(hereinafter referred to as the “Transferee”) as of December 29, 2010.

– Obligor: Sejin Maritime Co., Ltd,

– Principal sum of credit: W15,504,035,200

– Interest (Including delay interest): W68,671,492

– Occurrence date: February 3, 2010

– Expiry date: February 3, 2019

3\. In addition to the Transfer Credit, we transferred the right or status in
our possession or management out of personal or physical security, right to
profit or the other rights incidental to the Transfer Credit.

4\. In spite of the above transfer of Credit, the right, obligation or status
of yours based on the relating contract, agreement, security agreement or the
other contract shall remain unchanged and the right, obligation or the other
status of ours based on the above contracts shall be succeeded by the
Transferee to the extent of the transfer.

5\. We, as the creditor of the Transfer Credit, hereby give a notice to you on
the transfer of the Transfer Credit.

…

7 Subsequently, on 27 December 2010, HKC and HKA signed an Asset Transfer
Agreement (“the ATA”) under which HKC agreed to sell HKA, for a consideration
of W143,489,658,294 (per Art 5(1) of the ATA), certain credits which HKC had
obtained in the course of its business. 6

The credits owed by Sejin to HKC under the Lease Agreement were included in
the sale. 7

CA 59/2015 ACB vol 2 at p 143.

8 By early April 2011, Sejin had failed to make any rental payments under the
Lease Agreement for a period of six consecutive months. According to the
affidavit filed on 6 March 2012 by Mr Sejun Kim (“Mr SJ Kim”), HKC’s
representative, there was no sign that Sejin would be able to make further
payments as the value of the Vessel had depreciated significantly and the
prevailing market conditions were very poor. 8

CA 59/2015 ROA vol 3A at p 143, para 14.

Mr SJ Kim stated in his affidavit that HKC had grave concerns about Sejin’s
ability to perform its obligations under the Lease Agreement, and thought that
it was entitled to terminate that agreement by giving Sejin notice in
accordance with Art 24(2) of the agreement.

9 HKA thus sent the 4 April 2011 Notice to Sejin informing it that it had
“lost all the benefit of time” 9

for repaying its outstanding debts. The relevant parts of the notice read as

2\. This is about the facility rent (lease) contract … between your company
and [HKC], the credit of which was assigned to us on Dec. 29, 2010.

3\. According to paragraph 2 of article 24 of the above lease contract, your
company lost all the benefit of time of debt against our company. Therefore,
please pay immediately all outstanding principal, period interest, overdue
principal and interest, delayed compensation.

4\. If the above point 3 is not implemented, in order to secure the remaining
credit, our company will do the following:

(a) Demand an immediate repayment of the full amount of the credit

(b) Retrieve the leased object, consider an auction and register the
information about the overdue payment according to the regulation of credit
information management

(c) Take legal actions such as placing the collateral and other assets under
distraint attachment and request for auctioning them. And we also let you know
that you are responsible for enforcement cost when we do the above.

10 The overdue lease payments as at 4 April 2011 amounted to W289,460,562, and
the total sum that was to be paid for the remainder of the lease was
W16,934,476,554, or approximately US$15,019,200. 11

CA 59/2015 ACB vol 2 at p 52; CA 59/2015 ROA vol 3A at p 144, para 16.

The parties disagreed on whether or not the NCT conferred on HKA, who was not
a party to the Lease Agreement, the right to terminate that agreement.

11 Sejin did not give any formal reply to the 4 April 2011 Notice. 12

##### Foot Note 12

CA 59/2015 ROA vol 3A at p 146, para 25.

According to Mr SJ Kim’s affidavit of 6 March 2012, sometime around mid-April
2011, he (Mr SJ Kim) received a call from Mr Keunhyuk Park (“Mr Park”),
Sejin’s chief executive officer, asking for a meeting. During the meeting, Mr
Park asked whether the termination of the Lease Agreement could be revoked and
the Lease Agreement revived. Mr SJ Kim informed him that the Lease Agreement
had been terminated and its termination could not be revoked with just a mere
promise to pay the outstanding sums. 13

##### Foot Note 13

CA 59/2015 ROA vol 3A at p 146, para 23.

Instead, HKC would only consider revoking the termination of the Lease
Agreement with an actual payment of those sums. 14

CA 59/2015 ROA vol 3A at p 145, para 23.

payments which it owed HKC. 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

CA 59/2015 ROA vol 3A at p 145, para 24.

Following that request, a list of overdue payments as at 25 April 2011 was
emailed to Sejin. 16

13 On 9 May 2011, HKA issued a further formal notice to Sejin emphasising that
Sejin had “lost all the benefit of time” for paying the rental arrears. HKA
continued to demand the immediate payment of the full amount which was
outstanding, but indicated that it was prepared to desist from taking steps to
secure the amount owed if payment was made by 13 May 2011. 18

14 On 23 May 2011, Sejin responded to HKA’s 9 May 2011 notice. It explained
that it had been unable to fulfil its monthly payment obligations as the
Vessel had broken down frequently. 19

It also informed HKA that freight earnings from a charter dated 13 May 2011
with Frumentarius Ltd (“Frumentarius”), the respondent in Civil Appeal No 58
of 2015 (“CA 58/2015”), for a voyage from Belawan, Indonesia to Taman, Russia
would generate revenue of about US$1,700,000, and it would ensure that
Frumentarius deposited the charter payment due directly into HKA’s account. 20

##### Foot Note 20

However, Sejin stated, it needed time to make the necessary arrangements, and

15 No response was given by either HKC or HKA until 14 June 2011. In the
meantime, Sejin continued using the Vessel to trade. Mr SJ Kim stated that
during this period, HKA was very upset by Sejin’s refusal to return the
Vessel. On 25 May 2011, Sejin sent HKA an email stating that Mr Park would
notarise a promissory note in favour of HKA if the Lease Agreement was
revived, 23

2\. This is a reply to the official document that your company sent to our
company about “Chem Orchid – lease payment (sent day: May 23, 2011)” and “Chem
Orchid – COA contract (sent day: May 31, 2011).”

3\. Although our company gave notice of the lease termination and demanded
that you should return the leased ship and pay the liquidated amount of loss
through “Lease termination notice (document number: Hankook (Asset) No. 11-12,
sent day: April 4, 2011)” and “Demand for liquidated amount of loss and claims
for return of the leased ship (document number: Hankook (Asset) No. 11-29,
sent day: May 9, 2011)[”], your company did not respond to them, and this is
an embezzlement and subject to criminal penalty.

4\. After reviewing your request through the document that you sent on the
lease payment deadline (June 17, 2011) and COA contract conclusion deadline (6
months from the date of sending the document), we cannot fully accept your
company’s request and we urge you to implement a) among the followings by June
17, b) to e) among the followings by June 31, and f) when the lease contract
is normalized in the future.

Following

(a) Pay already occurred overdue lease amount, 190,000,000 won and 210,000 USD
to our company

(b) Pay all kinds of unpaid money including bunker C oil cost, repair cost,
sailors’ salary and maintenance fee

(c) Submit to our company your company’s detailed statement of cash flow

(d) Submit the long-term charter and documents to prove it

(e) Notarize a promissory note and submit it to our company

(f) Entrust your company’s future money management to our company

[5.] If all the items written above are implemented, our company will consider
normalization of the already terminated lease contract with your company. If
not, our company will take all the necessary measures (including civil and
criminal legal actions) to retrieve Chem Orchid, the leased ship, and the
amount of credit.

[underlining in original]

Sejin neither returned the Vessel to HKC nor paid the arrears due under the
Lease Agreement. Instead, the Vessel sailed from Dumai, Indonesia to
Singapore, where it arrived on 16 June 2011.

18 Upon learning of the Vessel’s presence in Singapore through Mr SJ Kim on 29
June 2011, HKA sent Sejin a final notice for the Vessel’s redelivery. On 30
June 2011, the Vessel took on more bunkers, which were supplied by Winplus,
the respondent in CA 62/2015 (see [3] above). Sejin replied to HKA’s final
notice on 4 July 2011 stating that it was not intentionally delaying the
return of the Vessel; instead, it wanted to return the Vessel safely through
its normal sailing route.

19 On 15 July 2011, Sejin sent a further letter to Mr SJ Kim informing him
that it would do its best to return the Vessel to South Korea as soon as
possible. This did not, however, come to pass because on 28 July 2011, Winplus
filed Admiralty in Rem No 184 of 2011 (“ADM 184/2011”) against the Vessel and
arrested it in Singapore. Subsequently, three further in rem writs – namely,
Admiralty in Rem No 197 of 2011 (“ADM 197/2011”), Admiralty in Rem No 198 of
2011 (“ADM 198/2011”) and Admiralty in Rem No 201 of 2011 (“ADM 201/2011”) –
were filed against the Vessel by, respectively: (a) Frumentarius, the
respondent in CA 58/2015; (b) KRC Efko-Kaskad LLC (“KRC”), the respondent in
Civil Appeal No 60 of 2015; and (c) Mercuria, the respondent in CA 59/2015.

20 In brief, the claims made in the in rem writs were as follows:

(a) In ADM 184/2011, Winplus claimed for unpaid bunkers which were supplied to
the Vessel in Dumai, Indonesia and Singapore.

(b) In ADM 197/2011, Frumentarius claimed for loss or damage arising from the
breach of the charterparty dated 13 May 2011 which it had entered into with
Sejin (see [14] above).

(c) In ADM 198/2011, KRC claimed for non-delivery of cargo which it had
shipped to Taman, Russia on board the Vessel.

(d) In ADM 201/2011, Mercuria claimed for non-delivery of cargo which it had
shipped to Huelva, Spain on board the Vessel.

21 HKC entered an appearance in all four in rem actions as the Vessel’s
registered owner. Sejin did not enter an appearance at all. With the court’s
approval, the Vessel was sold on 23 December 2011 below its appraised value.
As mentioned earlier, HKC subsequently filed applications in all four
admiralty actions seeking, in the main, to set aside the in rem writs and all
subsequent proceedings that had been instituted (referred to hereafter as “the
Setting-Aside Applications”) on the grounds that the court’s in rem
jurisdiction had not been properly invoked because at the Relevant Time, the
Vessel was no longer leased to Sejin on a demise charter.

The Judge’s decision

22 As mentioned at [3] above, the Setting-Aside Applications first came before
the AR, who allowed the applications. However, on appeal, the Judge reversed
the AR’s decision for four reasons.

23 First, the Judge held that the 4 April 2011 Notice was invalid since
neither the ATA nor the NCT had transferred to HKA the right to terminate the
Lease Agreement. Instead, the ATA had only transferred to HKA the credits
payable by Sejin to HKC under the Lease Agreement, while the NCT had merely
served as “a notice to Sejin of the intended credit transfer and could not
transfer more rights than [the rights] transferred under the ATA” [emphasis in
original] (see the HC Judgment at [44]). As such, the Judge held, only HKC
could have issued a notice to terminate the Lease Agreement. The Judge further
ruled that even if HKA were authorised to terminate the Lease Agreement on
HKC’s behalf, the 4 April 2011 Notice would still have been ineffective to
effect such termination. This was because according to Art 24(2) of the Lease
Agreement, a condition precedent to the right of termination was that HKC must
have formed an opinion that Sejin was “facing difficulties in continuing its
normal business activities”, and there was no evidence to this effect.
Furthermore, the “cause” for termination had to bear some relation to Sejin’s
inability to operate as a going concern. In this regard, the Judge considered
that Sejin’s mere inability to keep up with the monthly rental payments due
under the Lease Agreement could not, on its own, amount to such “cause”. In
any case, the Judge pointed out, the issue of a notice of termination had to
be preceded by a rectification notice, and there was no evidence that Sejin
had been issued with such a notice (see the HC Judgment at [46]–[48], [55] and
[58]).

24 Second, the Judge held that physical redelivery of the Vessel was necessary
to terminate the Lease Agreement since the defining feature of a demise
charter was the complete transfer of possession and control of the vessel
concerned from the shipowner to the charterer (see the HC Judgment at [72]).
Accordingly, the parties to a demise charter could not contract out of that
requirement – until physical redelivery was effected, the demise charterer
continued to enjoy full rights of control and possession over the vessel, and
third parties would be entitled to continue to deal with the demise charterer
based on the latter’s actual control and physical possession of the vessel. In
the Judge’s view, allowing a shipowner to contract out of the general
requirement of physical redelivery would be unfair to third parties because in
the absence of such redelivery, the change in the legal status of a vessel
upon the termination of a demise charter would not be known to third parties
(see the HC Judgment at [72]–[76] and [82]).

25 Third, the Judge held that even if it were in theory possible to contract
out of the general requirement of physical redelivery to terminate a demise
charter, there was in effect no such contracting out and no attempt to
contract out in this case. This was because Art 26(3) of the Lease Agreement
provided that hire continued to be payable by Sejin until the Vessel was
redelivered, and thus “reinforced the general requirement of physical
redelivery at common law” [emphasis in original] (see the HC Judgment at
[98]). Therefore, Sejin continued to be the demise charterer of the Vessel at
the Relevant Time (see, likewise, [98] of the HC Judgment).

26 Fourth, the Judge held that there was no need for the creation or
acceptance in Singapore law of the doctrine of constructive redelivery vis-à-
vis the termination of demise charters. More importantly, he stated, such a
doctrine would result in significant injustice to third parties, who would
have no way of knowing whether the demise charterer with whom they were
transacting had lost that status on account of a constructive redelivery. The
Judge added that even if the doctrine of constructive redelivery were
applicable in Singapore, such redelivery had not been made out on the facts of
this case as the 4 April 2011 Notice and Sejin’s letters of 4 July 2011 and 15
July 2011 were all insufficient to evince “a clear intention to redeliver the
Vessel” (see the HC Judgment at [104] and [111]–[112]).

OS 21/2015

27 As mentioned earlier, HKC appealed against the entirety of the Judge’s
decision. However, Mercuria and Winplus objected to HKC’s appeals, contending
that HKC needed leave from the Judge before it could appeal, but had not
obtained such leave. HKC then filed OS 21/2015 on 14 September 2015 seeking,
in the main:

(a) a declaration that it did not need leave of court to appeal against the
Judge’s decision; or

(b) alternatively, in the event that leave to appeal was needed: (i) an
extension of time to apply for such leave; (ii) the grant of such leave
retrospectively or otherwise; and (iii) an order that the documents already
filed in the respective appeals were to stand in the appeals.

The parties’ arguments on the issue of leave to appeal

28 Mercuria submitted that HKC required leave from the High Court before it
could appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Judge’s decision as the
Setting-Aside Applications were interlocutory in nature. It explained that
pursuant to s 34(2)(d) of the SCJA read with para (e) of the Fifth Schedule
thereto, leave of court was required to appeal against an order made on an
interlocutory application refusing to set aside an in rem writ, and the

29 HKC did not address the issue of leave to appeal in its Appellant’s Case in
any of its four appeals. It appeared from the documents disclosed by Mercuria
in its Supplemental Core Bundle for CA 59/2015 that HKC took the view that it
did not need leave of court to appeal against the Judge’s decision. HKC’s
position seemed to be that the Setting-Aside applications, being applications
to set aside the Creditors’ in rem writs due to the wrongful invocation of the
court’s admiralty jurisdiction under s 4(4) of the HCAJA, were not
interlocutory applications as they had the effect of making a final disposal
of the parties’ substantive rights; hence, no leave of court to appeal was
required. 33

In this regard, this court had held in The Nasco Gem [2014] 2 SLR 63 (at [16])
that an application for a warrant of arrest fell within para (e) of the Fifth
Schedule to the SCJA, such that leave of court was needed to appeal against an
order refusing to set aside a warrant of arrest. From the documents, it
appeared that HKC’s position was that The Nasco Gem could be distinguished as
it concerned an application to set aside a warrant of arrest, as opposed to an
in rem writ; furthermore, the setting-aside application in that case was based
on an alleged abuse of process (specifically, non-disclosure of material facts
on the part of the arresting party). 34

A ruling on this jurisdictional fact, HKC contended, would be determinative of

not the demise charterer of the Vessel at the Relevant Time, the admiralty
proceedings could not be sustained and the court would have to dismiss all
four in rem actions. 37

Our decision

The jurisdictional requirements in admiralty proceedings

30 In The Bunga Melati 5 [2012] 4 SLR 546 (“The Bunga Melati (CA)”), this
court, in the main judgment delivered by V K Rajah JA, held (at [106]; see
also [112]) that in order to invoke the court’s admiralty jurisdiction under s
4(4) of the HCAJA, the plaintiff had to satisfy the following five
requirements:

(a) first, prove on the balance of probabilities that the jurisdictional facts
under the particular limb of ss 3(1)(d) to 3(1)(q) which it was relying on
existed, as well as show an arguable case that its claim was of the type or
nature required by the relevant statutory provision;

(b) second, prove on the balance of probabilities that its claim arose in
connection with a ship;

(c) third, identify, without having to show in argument, the person who would
be liable on the claim in an in personam action (“the relevant person”);

(d) fourth, prove on the balance of probabilities that the relevant person
was, when the cause of action arose, the owner or charterer of, or in
possession or in control of the ship; and

(e) fifth, prove on the balance of probabilities that the relevant person was,
at the time when the action was brought, either: (i) the beneficial owner of
the ship in respect of all the shares in it or the charterer of that ship
under a demise charter; or (ii) the beneficial owner of a sister ship in
respect of all the shares in it.

31 The present appeals concerned the fifth of the requirements laid down in
The Bunga Melati (CA) (referred to hereafter as “Step 5”). The parties’
diametrically opposed positions bring into sharp focus the debate on how rules
of civil procedure should apply in relation to admiralty proceedings which
operate in rem. In the present case, the question of whether the Creditors’ in
rem writs, as well as the arrest of the Vessel, should be set aside was
dependent on the core factual issue of whether Sejin was the demise charterer
of the Vessel at the Relevant Time. How should this factual issue be
determined? What would be the standard of proof if the issue were to be
decided purely on the basis of affidavit evidence? Should the defendant in
such a situation be entitled to take up the issue on appeal if the issue were
decided against it wholly on the basis of conflicting affidavit evidence? If
the defendant is not so entitled, will it be permitted to revisit the same
factual issue at the trial of the substantive claim?

32 We begin by observing that in The Bunga Melati (CA), this court in effect
endorsed Belinda Ang Saw Ean J’s ruling in the court below that disputed
jurisdictional facts had to be proved on “a balance of probabilities” (see The
Bunga Melati 5 [2011] 4 SLR 1017 (“The Bunga Melati (HC)”) at [108]–[109]).
Notwithstanding this endorsement, we note that concerns were in fact raised by
Belinda Ang J as to whether it was appropriate to use the standard of “a
balance of probabilities” in the case of an interlocutory application to set
aside an in rem writ on the basis of affidavit evidence. At [86] and [98] of
The Bunga Melati (HC), Belinda Ang J observed:

Step (1) of section 4(4): jurisdictional facts to be proved on a balance of
probabilities, and jurisdictional questions of law to be shown on a good
arguable case

…

86 Step (1) of s 4(4) of the HCAJA [viz, showing that the plaintiff had a
claim under ss 3(1)(d) to 3(1)(q) of the HCAJA] contained no language similar
to that of O 11 r 2(2) [of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)],
and in the absence of such language, there seemed to me no good reason not to
hold a plaintiff to the normal civil standard of proof as far as proving
jurisdictional facts was concerned. Incidentally, in Empire Shipping Co Inc v
Owners of the Ship “Shin Kobe Maru” (1991) 104 ALR 489, Gummow J, like the
learned [assistant registrar] in this case, drew an analogy with the cases on
service out of jurisdiction … in deciding (at 493–494), on a defendant’s
challenge to the court’s jurisdiction in rem under s 4(2) of the Admiralty Act
1988 [(Cth)] (the Australian equivalent of s 3(1) of the HCAJA), that the
plaintiff was only required to show a “strong argument” that the court had
jurisdiction, but it was in my view significant that Gummow J’s approach was
ultimately not endorsed by the High Court of Australia in [The Owners of the
Ship “Shin Kobe Maru” v Empire Shipping Company Inc (1994) 181 CLR 404];
instead, the High Court [of Australia] affirmed that, for the purposes of s
4(2) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (corresponding to s 3(1) of the HCAJA and
therefore step (1) of s 4(4)), jurisdictional facts had to be proved on a
balance of probabilities. As a practical matter, it could of course be said
(as it was by the learned [assistant registrar] in his grounds of decision)
that at such a preliminary stage of the action, in the absence of discovery
and cross-examination of witnesses, it would be inappropriate to insist on a
standard of proof normally applicable to full trials. However, that was not a
principled way of dealing with the point that when the court’s entire
jurisdiction to adjudicate the action rested upon a disputed question of
(jurisdictional) fact, that question of fact had to be resolved once and for
all, using a standard of proof that was consistent with that used for proof of
facts in general (in the absence of statutory language stating otherwise).
Further, such pragmatic objections have not convinced courts in admiralty
cases to abandon the standard of a balance of probabilities where proving
jurisdictional facts was concerned …

…

98 If … the plaintiff disputed the defendant’s factual assertion (that the
bunkers had been supplied as a tradable commodity), then the court was obliged
to find, on a balance of probabilities, as a precondition to deciding whether
the plaintiff’s claim fell within s 3(1)(l) of the HCAJA, whether the bunkers
had in fact been supplied as a consumable or as a commodity. This fact was
simply a condition precedent to jurisdiction under s 3(1)(l), ie, it was a
jurisdictional fact which had to be found at the outset. That fact-finding
might be rendered difficult as a result of the preliminary nature or urgency
of the action, or the evidence being in affidavit form, did not detract from
the task of the court …

[original emphasis in bold italics; emphasis added in italics]

33 Similar concerns were expressed in The Bunga Melati (CA) by Chan Sek Keong
CJ, who delivered a separate judgment of his own even though he agreed with
the court’s main judgment (delivered by Rajah JA) in that appeal. Chan CJ
expressed his concerns at [127] of The Bunga Melati (CA) while commenting on
The Jarguh Sawit [1997] 3 SLR(R) 829. The facts of The Jarguh Sawit are as
follows. The respondent in that case, Navigation Maritime Bulgare (“NMB”),
agreed under a memorandum of agreement (“the MOA”) to sell a ship to Oxford
Jay International Pte Ltd (“OJ”) as a Lloyd’s Register Class vessel. OJ paid
NMB 10% of the purchase price as a deposit, and NMB advanced a loan for the
remaining 90% of the purchase price, which loan was repayable in six monthly
instalments commencing six months after the date of drawdown at an interest
rate of 6% per annum. The loan from NMB was secured by a mortgage over the
ship to be sold.

34 NMB subsequently failed to deliver the ship as a Lloyd’s Register Class
vessel because it had not been upgraded to comply with certain specified
requirements. As a result, OJ was unable to register the ship under the
Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179, 1985 Rev Ed) as a Singapore vessel, and the
mortgage in turn could not be registered as the law at that time only
permitted the registration of mortgages over Singapore-registered ships. OJ
and NMB then decided to modify the vessel to re-class it in accordance with
the classification specifications of Germanischer Lloyd’s as opposed to those
of Lloyd’s, with the cost of the modifications to be borne by OJ and NMB in
agreed proportions. Disputes, however, arose regarding payment for the
modifications. In the meantime, ownership of the ship was transferred by OJ to
the appellant, Jarguh Harimau Sdn Bhd (“JH”).

35 NMB commenced legal proceedings and arrested the ship on 6 October 1994. JH
applied to set aside the writ and the warrant of arrest on the basis that it
was a bona fide purchaser of the ship without notice of the mortgage, which
had never been registered. It failed before the assistant registrar. JH
appealed to the High Court based on a different ground, namely, that the
court’s admiralty jurisdiction had been wrongly invoked as JH was not the
party who would be liable in personam on NMB’s claim. JH failed before both
the High Court and the Court of Appeal.

36 Thereafter, NMB applied for summary judgment; it also sought to strike out
those paragraphs in JH’s defence and counterclaim which alleged that the court
lacked jurisdiction. The applications were granted by an assistant registrar,
after which OJ assigned all its rights, title and interest under the MOA to JH
on 5 August 1996. JH took the view that as a result of the assignment, it was
entitled to raise against NMB all the defences which would have been available
to OJ in an in personam action against OJ. JH appealed to the High Court
against the assistant registrar’s decision on this basis, but the High Court
affirmed the assistant registrar’s decision to strike out the said paragraphs
alleging the court’s lack of jurisdiction.

37 JH then appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that it should not be
precluded from pleading a defence of no jurisdiction at the trial even though
it had already been decided at the interlocutory stage that the court had
jurisdiction. This was because the question of jurisdiction was a substantive
one. JH contended that the burden at the interlocutory stage was simply for
NMB to prove that there was an arguable case that the court had jurisdiction
as the question of jurisdiction would be re-tried at the final hearing, where
NMB would have to prove its case on the balance of probabilities; in other
words, it was “implicitly understood that in addition to the hearing on
jurisdiction at the interlocutory stage, there would be a second hearing on
the issue at the trial stage” (see The Jarguh Sawit at [28]). For these
reasons, JH submitted, those paragraphs of its pleadings alleging the court’s
lack of jurisdiction had been wrongly struck out. The Court of Appeal
disagreed and held (at [29]–[32]):

29 Dealing first with the suggestion that the question of jurisdiction is not
procedural but substantive, we find ourselves unable to accept it for two
reasons.

30 Firstly, whether or not a court has jurisdiction is, of necessity, a
question logically prior to the substantive dispute of the parties. Unless and
until a court is properly seized, it cannot adjudicate on the matter. If the
appellants were right to characterise a dispute over jurisdiction as a
substantive issue, and that they were entitled to raise it as a substantive
defence, then they would in effect be arguing this at trial: “Our case is that
this court has no jurisdiction to decide substantive issues; could you then
please give a ruling on a substantive issue?” The defect in logic is self-
apparent. Thus, our law provides that a party disputing jurisdiction may
appear before the court to argue the question of jurisdiction (which we hold
to be a procedural issue) without thereby submitting to the court’s
jurisdiction to determine substantive issues. This is particularly so when the
court’s admiralty jurisdiction in rem is invoked as such jurisdiction is
founded on [the then equivalent of the HCAJA], s 3(1). See also s 16(3) of
[the then equivalent of the SCJA].

…

32 In view of our finding that jurisdiction is a procedural issue, the analogy
with Kelsey v Doune [[1912] 2 KB 482] is inapt and we accordingly hold that
insofar as this argument is concerned, the position is that the question of
jurisdiction cannot be tried again.

[emphasis added]

38 The paragraphs cited above may give the impression that all jurisdictional
questions are settled with finality at the interlocutory stage. However, that
is not necessarily so in every case. In our view, the paragraphs quoted above
have to be read in their proper context and together with the subsequent
paragraphs, ie, [40]–[44] of The Jarguh Sawit. It is apparent that the Court
of Appeal’s remarks were made in the context of interlocutory challenges to
the court’s exercise of admiralty jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal took pains
to distinguish “the issues of jurisdiction and substantive liability” in the
context of “the peculiar nature of admiralty actions in rem” (at [40]), while
acknowledging at the same time that “for some of the grounds [in s 3(1) of the
then equivalent of the HCAJA], … there is some similarity in the questions
posed to determine jurisdiction and substantive liability”’ (at [41]). As we
see it, what this means is that once an applicant’s interlocutory challenge to
jurisdiction has been dismissed with finality, the applicant cannot, at the
trial, mount another challenge to jurisdiction based on the same standard of
proof as that applicable to its interlocutory challenge to jurisdiction since,
at the trial stage, the court would not be deciding whether there was good
cause to assume jurisdiction, but rather, would be deciding whether there was
good cause for judgment to be given to the plaintiff. We set out below the
relevant paragraphs from The Jarguh Sawit (viz, [40]–[44]) for good measure:

40 Turning to the third argument raised by the appellants [ie, the argument
that the question of jurisdiction would be re-tried at the trial (see [37]
above)], we believe that counsel confused the issues of jurisdiction and
substantive liability because of the peculiar nature of admiralty actions in
rem. Unlike actions in personam, in which the court’s jurisdiction is founded
on the presence of the defendant within the jurisdiction, admiralty
jurisdiction in rem is founded whenever one of the requirements of s 3(1) of
[the then equivalent of the HCAJA] … [is] satisfied. The particular ground
relied on in this case was ground (c): “any claim in respect of a mortgage of
or a charge on a ship or any share therein”.

41 We acknowledge that for some of the grounds, including ground (c), there is
some similarity in the questions posed to determine jurisdiction and
substantive liability. When deciding whether it has jurisdiction, the question
the court must ask itself is whether there is [a] good arguable case based on
a ship’s mortgage. When deciding at trial whether a defendant is liable, the
question the court must ask itself is whether the claim based on a ship’s
mortgage is proved on a balance of probabilities.

42 Counsel considered that as the question asked in both cases is the same,
and it is only the standard of proof that varies, he was entitled to argue
“jurisdiction” twice, with his chances on the second try being better because
the plaintiff had a higher burden. The point, however, that counsel missed,
was that the standard of proof varies because the nature of the legal
examination is different depending on whether one is asserting jurisdiction or
liability.

43 In a hearing of an application to dispute jurisdiction, the plaintiff need
only show that he has a good arguable case that his cause of action falls
within one of the categories of s 3(1) … His objective is to persuade the
court that there is sufficient evidence that a claim of the type specified …
exists. …

44 Once the suit reaches the trial stage, however, the nature of the legal
examination changes. The court is not deciding if there is a good cause for it
to assume jurisdiction – it is deciding if there is good cause for it to give
judgment for the plaintiff. The same facts cited to establish jurisdiction
must then be proved by the plaintiff in the context of the substantive dispute
proper and not [in] the context of a jurisdictional dispute. These facts must
be proved beyond the standard of a good arguable case. They must be proved to
the civil standard of proof, that is, on a balance of probabilities.

[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]

39 It is therefore not the case that the question of jurisdiction will never
arise subsequently at the trial. Instead, it is clear from the above
paragraphs from The Jarguh Sawit that the issue of jurisdiction can arise
again at the trial, but would fall to be determined based on a different
standard of proof due to the different nature of the subsequent inquiry at the
trial. Instead of being a procedural matter to be decided on the basis of a
good arguable case, the issue of jurisdiction would, at the trial, be a
substantive one to be decided on the balance of probabilities. In any event,
we note that the Court of Appeal’s observations in The Jarguh Sawit were made
in the context of JH (the appellant in that case) having already submitted to
the court’s jurisdiction. Besides having filed a defence and counterclaim, JH
had also failed to apply for leave to withdraw its appearance. This meant that
pursuant to O 12 r 7(6) of the then equivalent of the ROC, it had consented to
the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction to decide the matter (see [37]–[38] of The
Jarguh Sawit). That being the case, JH could no longer raise the issue of lack
of jurisdiction at the substantive trial of the action. It was therefore
correct for those paragraphs in JH’s pleadings alleging the court’s lack of
jurisdiction to be struck out since any contention at the trial that the
Singapore courts lacked jurisdiction over the dispute would have been doomed
to fail.

40 Chan CJ’s dicta in The Bunga Melati (CA) lends further weight to our
analysis of The Jarguh Sawit. He was of the view that the Court of Appeal’s
comments at [40]–[44] of The Jarguh Sawit (cited at [38] above) constituted a
piece of “somewhat elliptical dicta” which partly resulted in the procedural
problems concerning jurisdictional challenges to ship arrests involving
factual disputes at the interlocutory stage (see The Bunga Melati (CA) at
[126]). He commented (at [127]):

The court’s observations [at [40]–[44] of The Jarguh Sawit] are not self-
explanatory. The statement at [41] that “[w]hen deciding whether it has
jurisdiction, the question the court must ask itself is whether there is [a]
good arguable case based on a ship’s mortgage”, is unhelpful because it is not
clear whether the court was referring to a factual or a legal challenge, or
one involving an issue of mixed fact and law. The [High Court judge]
interpreted the test of a good arguable case in these passages in [The Jarguh
Sawit] as being referable to a question of law, and not to a question of fact,
because whether the claim “‘falls within one of the categories of s 3(1)’ is a
question of characterisation and categorisation, and therefore a question of
law” … However, this was not what the court in [The Jarguh Sawit] actually
said. At [43] of its judgment, the court said that “[the plaintiff’s]
objective is to persuade the court that there is sufficient evidence that a
claim of the type specified in s 3(1)(c) exists” [emphasis added], words which
are clearly apt as referring to an issue of fact rather than purely an issue
of law. In [The Jarguh Sawit], the disputed issue was whether a mortgage of
the ship had been executed – one which could be construed as a question of
fact indeed. However, it was not clear whether there was a clearly framed
factual challenge on jurisdiction in [The Jarguh Sawit] at the interlocutory
stage of the proceedings, and the comments by the court at [41] that “[w]hen
deciding at trial whether a defendant is liable, the question the court must
ask itself is whether the claim based on a ship’s mortgage is proved on a
balance of probabilities” referred to the liability stage rather than the
interlocutory stage. [emphasis in original]

41 The problem with the present case was precisely this – how could a disputed
jurisdictional fact (viz, whether Sejin was still the demise charterer of the
Vessel at the Relevant Time), which also involved the application of foreign
law (namely, South Korean law), be proved conclusively on the balance of
probabilities at the interlocutory stage when HKC (the applicant seeking to
set aside the Creditors’ in rem writs, and, in turn, the arrest of the Vessel)
did not apply to the court to have the relevant witnesses examined orally? In
our view, by relying wholly on affidavit evidence to decide the point on
jurisdiction, the Judge could only have determined the disputed jurisdictional
fact on a prima facie basis, and this would be non-conclusive of the
jurisdiction issue. Indeed, given the manner in which HKC made the Setting-
Aside Applications (viz, with striking out being the alternative relief to
setting aside and without any oral evidence being adduced), the disputed
jurisdictional fact could only be conclusively determined at the trial itself
after cross-examination of the witnesses, especially the experts on South
Korean law. In this regard, the dicta of Chan CJ in The Bunga Melati (CA) is
helpful. He placed importance on how the parties ran the proceedings, and
referred to the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Vostok Shipping
Co Ltd v Confederation Ltd [2000] 1 NZLR 37 (“Vostok Shipping”) as a case in
point.

42 In Vostok Shipping, the vessel concerned was arrested in New Zealand waters
by the appellant, Vostok Shipping Co Ltd (“Vostok”), based on an in personam
claim against a Russian company, Primorskaya Rybopromyshlennaya Kompaniya
“Orka” (“Orka”). Confederation Ltd (“Confederation”), the respondent, sought
to set aside the arrest on the ground that it had acquired ownership of the
vessel by the time the in rem action was brought, and thus, the New Zealand
High Court had no jurisdiction over the action under s 5(2)(b)(i) of the
Admiralty Act 1973 (No 119) (NZ) (“the New Zealand Admiralty Act”), which is
in pari materia with s 4(4) of the HCAJA.

43 Counsel for Vostok submitted that where there was a challenge to the
court’s jurisdiction before the trial, the challenge should be dealt with “on
the same footing as any other peremptory attack on the plaintiff’s case” (at
[16]). He analogised such a challenge to a striking-out application (likewise
at [16]), and submitted that Confederation had to show that Vostok did not
have any arguable case on the jurisdictional issue. As such, counsel
contended, the issues of: (a) whether the person who would be liable on the
claim in an in personam action was the owner of the ship at the time the cause
of action arose; and (b) whether that person was the beneficial owner of the
ship at the time the writ was issued should be determined at the interlocutory
stage by asking whether Vostok had no arguable case, with the onus on
Confederation to show this (at [16]). This position, Vostok’s counsel
asserted, made sense as (at [17]):

… [I]t is burdensome for a plaintiff to have to deal with objections to
jurisdiction on an urgent basis. Evidence, including expert evidence on
foreign law perhaps not available from anyone in this country, has to be
assembled under pressure of time and when the facts are not clear. A plaintiff
is not in a position to know about the ownership arrangements for a vessel
other than as disclosed by a ship register, whereas an applicant in the
position of Confederation in this case does have that knowledge. The decision
on jurisdiction will often be decisive of the case overall when the
maintaining of an arrest in a “satisfactory forum” may be an unpaid creditor’s
only prospect of securing payment. [Counsel for Vostok] accepted that an early
decision on ownership may save much time and expense but argued that it can
best be done by trial of the point as a preliminary issue under R 418 of the
[New Zealand] High Court Rules, when the plaintiff will have had a fair
opportunity through discovery, interrogatories, cross-examination and
marshalling of foreign and domestic law to test the other side’s assertions as
to ownership. [emphasis added]

44 Counsel for Confederation, on the other hand, urged the court to follow the
approach laid down in an earlier case, Baltic Shipping Co Ltd v Pegasus Lines
SA [1996] 3 NZLR 641, which adopted the same approach as that taken in
England, Australia and Singapore – namely, that the plaintiff needed to prove
on the balance of probabilities that the proceedings were within the in rem
jurisdiction of the court. He pointed out that the effect of establishing
jurisdiction in rem was to allow the plaintiff to arrest and detain a vessel
without any undertaking for damages, and there was no real protection for the
shipowner and the party who would be liable on the claim in an in personam
action against a claim which later proved to be ill-founded, considering,
especially, that urgency was required in ship arrests (see Vostok Shipping at
[18]). Moreover, counsel submitted, as the factual issues arising under s 5(2)
of the New Zealand Admiralty Act went to jurisdiction only and had no
relevance to the substance of the claim, they were not defences and should be
decided at the outset (see Vostok Shipping at [18]).

45 The New Zealand Court of Appeal accepted Confederation’s arguments and held
that:

(a) It was well-established practice in England, Australia and Singapore that
when faced with an application to set aside a ship arrest, the plaintiff had
to prove on the balance of probabilities that the proceedings were within the
in rem jurisdiction of the court (at [19]).

(b) Even allowing for considerations of urgency, the court should, in
appropriate circumstances, adjourn an application to set aside a ship arrest
so that there would be sufficient time for the parties to adduce the necessary
evidence, and for the court to determine important questions of ownership or
facts establishing jurisdiction without undue haste and consequent prejudice
to a party which might not have immediate access to all the relevant factual
materials (at [21]).

(c) Vostok had to establish, on the balance of probabilities based on the
evidence placed before the court by the parties, that its claim was within the
New Zealand High Court’s jurisdiction, and that Orka was both the legal and
the beneficial owner of the vessel at the time legal proceedings were
commenced (at [23]).

46 It is pertinent to note that in Vostok Shipping, the New Zealand Court of
Appeal cited the following holding of Robert Goff J (as he then was) in I
Congreso del Partido [1978] QB 500 (at 535–536):

… [A]s a matter of principle … any question of jurisdiction … must be dealt
with on [interlocutory] motions and cannot be dealt with as an issue in the
actions. Of course, on the hearing of such a motion, evidence will be
admitted. Usually that evidence will be in the form of affidavits, though in
theory oral evidence, for example, by cross-examination of deponents of
affidavits, might be allowed. … On the evidence so admitted, which in the
present case is purely affidavit evidence, the question of jurisdiction has to
be decided, and it cannot be right for the decision on that question to be
allowed to depend on the decision of some issue to be tried in the actions. If
there is no jurisdiction as against [the defendant, it] should not be troubled
with the actions at all; indeed, it cannot be decided whether the actions can
be allowed to proceed until the question of jurisdiction has been determined.
[emphasis added]

47 Returning to Chan CJ’s dicta in The Bunga Melati (CA) at [126]–[127] (see
[40] above), Chan CJ went on to approve the holding in Vostok Shipping (see
The Bunga Melati (CA) at [128]). He expressed the view that the New Zealand
Court of Appeal’s approach met the requirements of procedural justice in
determining factual challenges under the first step of the five-step process
laid down in The Bunga Melati (CA) (at [129]–[130]):

129 In my view, the court’s approach as described in the italicised words in
[Vostok Shipping at [19]–[21]] meets the requirements of procedural justice in
determining factual challenges under step 1 in an admiralty action. The court
must conduct a trial of the issue at the interlocutory/jurisdictional stage,
if the defendant seeks a conclusive finding of fact from the court. However,
if the defendant is only prepared to rely on its affidavits, the court will
only be able to determine the disputed issue on a preliminary basis.
Consistent with the nature of the hearing, there can be no finding of fact on
the balance of probabilities, but only on a prima facie basis that, on the
facts, the court has jurisdiction. Although there will be no conclusive
finding towards the disputed jurisdictional fact(s) under step 1 at the
interlocutory stage, the issue of jurisdiction will merge at the liability
stage with the issue of whether the plaintiff has proved its claim on the
facts on the balance of probabilities, and the court at the liability stage
would be entitled to come to a differing opinion from the court at the
interlocutory stage based on evidence beyond contested affidavits which might
surface at trial. … It does not matter how the standard of proof (at the
interlocutory/jurisdictional stage) is labelled provided it is understood that
a factual dispute cannot be conclusively decided on contested affidavit
evidence alone.

130 In my view, in the case of a factual challenge to jurisdiction, whether
the question of fact would be determined on the balance of probabilities
depends on how a defendant wishes to make good its challenge by way of
evidence. It is not in every case that the court is required to decide the
dispute of fact on the balance of probabilities. This is only possible,
consistent with the requirements of procedural justice, where all the evidence
relating to disputed facts are before the court. Each case must depend on what
the defendant is prepared to agree to in relation to how the jurisdictional
issue is to be determined or tried. It is not for the court to compel the
defendant to undergo a full pre-trial of the factual dispute if it only wishes
to rely on affidavit evidence. In this regard, I am of the view that there is
no justification from the perspective of procedural justice for an admiralty
action to be treated differently from any other civil action. The court is the
master of its own procedure, subject of course, to [the then equivalent of the
ROC], but there is nothing in [the then equivalent of the ROC] which compels
the court to deal with factual or legal challenges in admiralty actions in any
particular way. There is nothing to prevent the court to prescribe its own
procedure, depending on the needs of the parties, and in particular, the needs
of the party who wishes to set aside the admiralty action or the consequential
arrest of its vessel.

[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]

48 We agree with the views of Chan CJ, which make eminent sense in the context
of a ship arrest. A ship arrest can sometimes (and, indeed, may often) take
place under urgent conditions, with the ship spending only a fleeting moment
within the waters of Singapore – in such a situation, the arresting party may
often be able to obtain only a limited amount of information which
sufficiently supports the grant of an in rem writ and the issue of a warrant
of arrest. The defendant may wish to set aside the in rem writ and the warrant
of arrest, and it can choose to do so relying only on affidavit evidence. If
it so chooses, findings made by the court on disputed facts based only on
affidavit evidence at an interlocutory hearing, which facts impinge on the
court’s admiralty jurisdiction, will necessarily be prima facie non-conclusive
as the requirements of procedural justice would not have been fully complied
with. The issue of jurisdiction will then merge with the plaintiff’s
substantive claim at the trial, which will have to be proved by the plaintiff
on the balance of probabilities. This, in our view, is consistent with The
Jarguh Sawit, which (at [43]–[44]) made the very same distinction (see [38]
above). This element of choice was also alluded to by Steven Chong JC (as he
then was) in The Catur Samudra [2010] 2 SLR 518 at [23], where he cited the
same passage by Goff J in I Congreso del Partido (at 535–536) that we referred
to earlier (see [46] above). On the other hand, if the defendant seeks a
conclusive finding on jurisdiction and opts to have a full hearing on the
jurisdictional issue replete with all the requirements of procedural justice,
the court can decide the jurisdictional issue conclusively based on the
standard of proof enunciated in The Bunga Melati (CA), which we have set out
at [30] above.

Section 34(1)(a) of the SCJA read with para (e) of the Fourth Schedule thereto

49 The present case would appear to be one where the defendant seeks to set
aside an in rem writ based solely on affidavit evidence. The Creditors
instituted the four in rem writs on the basis that Sejin, the party who would
be liable on their claims in an in personam action, was at the Relevant Time
the demise charterer of the Vessel. This was a necessary jurisdictional fact
for the invocation of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction. There was also the
question, which was very much in dispute, of whether the communications which
took place between HKC/HKA and Sejin (see [9]–[18] above) sufficed to
terminate the demise charter under South Korean law. It was undisputed that at
the Relevant Time, HKA had communicated the termination of the Lease Agreement
to Sejin, but the Vessel was still in Sejin’s physical possession. Thus, the
critical question was whether Sejin was still the demise charterer of the
Vessel at the Relevant Time, and the answer to this question would have a
bearing on Step 5 of the analysis set out in The Bunga Melati (CA). Also
directly relevant to the question of jurisdiction is the concept of
constructive redelivery in relation to the termination of demise charters,
which concept has yet to be accepted in our law.

50 If HKC had succeeded on its jurisdictional challenge, the four in rem writs
filed by the Creditors would have had to be set aside. But, on the basis of
how the case was run before the AR and the Judge, there was no way in which a
conclusive finding on disputed facts going to the court’s admiralty
jurisdiction could be made until the full trial of the admiralty actions, with
cross-examination of the witnesses. In the circumstances, HKC’s jurisdictional
challenge could only be determined on a non-conclusive prima facie basis, ie,
based on affidavit evidence alone.

51 To recapitulate, before the AR and the Judge, the Setting-Aside
Applications were dealt with in chambers based solely on affidavit evidence.
There was no cross-examination of the parties’ factual witnesses or the expert
witnesses testifying on the content of South Korean law, which governed the
Lease Agreement. This meant that HKC had chosen to take a course of action
under which the court could only make a finding on jurisdiction on a non-
conclusive prima facie basis. Such a finding would not be conclusive on the
jurisdictional issue, and clearly, HKC should not be precluded from
subsequently addressing this issue again at the liability stage.

52 Before us, HKC argued that it was entitled to lodge these appeals because
the Singapore courts had no in rem jurisdiction over the Vessel. It contended
that the Vessel was no longer leased to Sejin on a demise charter at the
Relevant Time as the demise charter had earlier been brought to an end by
either express termination of the Lease Agreement or the constructive
redelivery of the Vessel. Mr Heng Gwee Nam Henry, counsel for HKC, contended
that since the entire proceedings would come to an end if the Creditors’ in
rem writs were set aside, the issue of jurisdiction was a substantive one as
it could have a substantive impact on the rights of the parties. While we
agreed with Mr Heng to the extent that the entire admiralty proceedings could
have ended had the Judge determined that Sejin was not the demise charterer of
the Vessel at the Relevant Time and, consequently, set aside both the in rem
writs and the warrant of arrest, the fact of the matter was that the Judge did
not in fact rule that way. Had the Judge done so, we would have had no
hesitation in holding that the Creditors would have a right of appeal against
that decision, which would effectively have brought the proceedings to an end;
and no leave of court would have been required for the Creditors to appeal
against that decision. But, given that the Judge’s decision was the converse,
ie, that Sejin was still the demise charterer of the Vessel at the Relevant
Time, no substantive rights of either HKC or the Creditors were affected. The
consequence of the Judge’s ruling, although he also proffered his view on a
number of legal issues, was that the jurisdictional issue was to be deferred
and decided definitively at the trial.

53 We would reiterate that before us, HKC was appealing against the Judge’s
refusal to set aside the Creditors’ in rem writs. In view of the fact that
there were factual disputes which related to the court’s jurisdiction, and
given that no application was made to the court to hear oral evidence and
subject witnesses to cross-examination, there was no way in which those
factual disputes could be resolved definitively. In our view, the Setting-
Aside Applications were in substance a request to the court to strike out the
in rem actions on a basis similar to that which underlies O 18 r 19 of the
ROC. We also note that the grounds relied on by HKC to challenge the court’s
jurisdiction were the same as the grounds which could defeat the Creditors’
substantive claims in the in rem writs. As the Judge declined to set aside the
in rem writs on the basis of the affidavit evidence before him, the present
admiralty proceedings continue to be afoot, with no conclusive finding made
yet on the jurisdictional point. HKC can therefore raise the jurisdictional
issue again at the trial; and the trial judge would be entitled, at that
stage, to rule on jurisdiction based on all the evidence, including oral
evidence, and the arguments placed before him. Nothing said by the Judge or by
us in the present proceedings would have a bearing on how the trial judge
should decide the jurisdictional issue at the trial. And whatever the trial
judge’s ruling on jurisdiction may be, any party who is dissatisfied would
have an automatic right to appeal against that decision. For these reasons, we
held that s 34(1)(a) of the SCJA read with para (e) of the Fourth Schedule
thereto precluded HKC from appealing against the Judge’s decision, and this
court in turn had no jurisdiction to hear the present appeals.

Section 34(2)(d) of the SCJA read with para (e) of the Fifth Schedule thereto

54 At this juncture, we turn to s 34(2)(d) of the SCJA read with para (e) of
the Fifth Schedule thereto, which were relied on by Mercuria and Winplus in
arguing that HKC had no right to appeal against the Judge’s decision without
first seeking the court’s leave (see [28] above). They contended that pursuant
to these provisions, HKC had to first obtain leave of court before it could
appeal against the Judge’s decision. This was because the Setting-Aside
Applications were interlocutory applications, and no appeal could be brought
against any order made on an interlocutory application unless leave of court
was first obtained, with such leave to be sought from the High Court first.
This was, Mercuria and Winplus submitted, by virtue of s 35 of the SCJA, which
provides that where an application “may be made either to the High Court or to
the Court of Appeal, it shall be made in the first instance to the High
Court”. Therefore, Mercuria and Winplus argued, a leave application had to be
made by HKC to the High Court first, and it was only if the High Court refused
to grant leave to appeal that HKC could apply for leave from the Court of
Appeal.

55 Given our decision that HKC had no right of appeal to begin with by virtue
of s 34(1)(a) of the SCJA read with para (e) of the Fourth Schedule thereto
(see [53] above), it is not necessary for us to deal with the submissions of
Mercuria and Winplus on the issue of leave to appeal. Be that as it may,
assuming HKC could have appealed against the Judge’s decision with the court’s
leave (in other words, if, as Mercuria and Winplus submitted, s 34(2)(d) of
the SCJA read with para (e) of the Fifth Schedule thereto were applicable), we
agree with Mercuria and Winplus that HKC should have sought leave to appeal
from the Judge first. As HKC did not do so, even if it could have brought the
present appeals with the court’s leave, it would be out of turn for us to
grant HKC such leave. This was a second reason why we dismissed OS 21/2015 and
why, as a result, HKC’s appeals (assuming s 34(2)(d) of the SCJA read with
para (e) of the Fifth Schedule thereto applied) could not be allowed to
proceed.

Order 57 r 16(4) of the ROC

56 HKC also made an argument that O 57 r 16(4) of the ROC entitled the Court
of Appeal to grant it leave to appeal despite its failure to obtain leave from
the Judge if there were “special circumstances” which made it “impossible or
impracticable” for HKC to seek leave to appeal from the Judge. It submitted
that such “special circumstances” had been established on the facts as the
issue of leave to appeal was raised only after the Notices of Appeal and the
various Appellant’s and Respondent’s Cases had been filed. Furthermore, none
of the Creditors had applied to strike out the Notices of Appeal, and thus,
there was no prior opportunity for the issue to be determined by the High
Court. 38

Appellant’s Skeletal Arguments in OS 21/2015 at para 19.

57 In our view, this contention was unmeritorious. The correspondence between
HKC’s solicitors and the respective solicitors for Mercuria and Winplus showed
that HKC’s solicitors had been informed of their client’s failure to seek
leave from the Judge before filing its appeals. HKC’s solicitors were,
however, adamant in their position that HKC did not need leave of court to
appeal. 39

CA 59/2015 RSCB at pp 4, 10 and 13.

That being the case, the proper approach for HKC to take (assuming HKC had a
right of appeal to begin with) would have been to seek a declaration from the
Judge that it did not need leave of court to appeal; alternatively, in the
event that the Judge ruled that leave to appeal was needed, HKC should have
sought leave from the Judge before lodging its appeals. We did not think that
HKC’s failure to take these measures could constitute “special circumstances”
so as to bring them within the scope of O 57 r 16(4) of the ROC.

Conclusion

58 For the above reasons, we dismissed OS 21/2015. Consequently, we also
dismissed all four of HKC’s appeals on the grounds that pursuant to s 34(1)(a)
of the SCJA read with para (e) of the Fourth Schedule thereto, HKC had no
right of appeal as it was, in substance, attempting to appeal against an order
refusing to strike out a writ action. Considering that the work done in
relation to these appeals would not entirely go to waste, we fixed costs at
$25,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by HKC to each of the
respondents in CA 59/2015 and CA 62/2015 (ie, Mercuria and Winplus
respectively), with the usual consequential orders.

Closing observations: O 12 r 7 and O 14 r 12 of the ROC

59 In closing, we wish to refer to two sets of provisions in the ROC. First,
pursuant to O 12 rr 7(1) and 7(4), a defendant who wishes to dispute the
court’s jurisdiction may apply to set aside the writ issued against it; and
the court is empowered, on such an application, to make such orders as it
thinks fit or give such directions as may be appropriate, including directions
for the trial of the jurisdictional dispute as a preliminary issue. Second, O
14 rr 12(1) and 12(2) provide that the court may determine “any question of
law or construction of any document arising in any cause or matter” if it
appears that: (a) the question is “suitable for determination without a full
trial of the action”; and (b) such determination will “fully determine
(subject only to any possible appeal) the entire cause or matter or any claim
or issue therein”. On determining such a question, the court can “dismiss the
cause or matter or make such order or judgment as it thinks just”.

60 At the conclusion of the oral hearing before us, we indicated to the
parties that they were free to bring an application under O 14 r 12 for a
ruling on: (a) any points of law which could be determinative of the issues in
the in rem actions and which did not require any evidence; or (b) any points
of law which could be determined on the basis of agreed or undisputed facts. A
ruling by the High Court pursuant to such an application could then, if any of
the parties was dissatisfied, be brought before us on appeal. We underscored
the fact that the process under O 14 r 12 could only be invoked if there were
no factual disputes relating to the point of law in question.

61 We further indicated that should any of the parties decide to make an
application under O 14 r 12, the application and any appeal therefrom could be
heard on an expedited basis. To save costs, in the event of such an
application being made, we also granted leave to the parties to use the
materials that have already been filed in relation to OS 21/2015 and the
present appeals.
