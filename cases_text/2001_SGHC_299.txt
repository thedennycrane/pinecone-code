**_The originating summons_ **

****

To ensure that all relevant parties are before the court, the executrix
applied for and was granted an order appointing:

(1) Mr Chelva Rajah SC to represent items 1 to 5, 7 to 9 and 12 to 14 listed
in the will;

(2) Mr Philip Loh to represent item 10 appearing in the will; and

(3) Mr TPB Menon to represent items 6 and 11 appearing in the will and the
next of kin of the testatrix.  
  
Mr N Ganesan, counsel for the executrix, also represents the Wesley Methodist
Church.  
  
The remaining prayers of this originating summons seek the determination of
the court on whether the respective pecuniary legacies have failed on the
ground of uncertainty or on the ground that the gifts in question are not
charitable in nature and also seek the following relief:

> _
>
> (v) That it may be determined upon the true construction of clause 15 on
> page 3 of the Will of the Testatrix that the Flat 53B Lorong Stangee, Chapel
> Lodge Singapore is an absolute and outright gift to the "Westley Methodist
> Church" of No. 5 Fort Canning Road, Singapore and that the Flat be
> conveyed/transferred to the "Trustees of the Methodist Church in Singapore"
> subject to the trusts set out in the Will of the Testatrix.
>
> (vi) That there is an intestacy as to the residuary estate of the Testatrix
> and that in default of distribution under section 7 of the Intestate
> Succession Act the Government shall be entitled to the residuary estate of
> the Testatrix.
>
> (vii) Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to
> make.
>
> (viii) The costs of all parties to these proceedings be taxed on an
> indemnity basis and be paid out of the residuary estate of the Testatrix.
>
> (ix) Liberty to apply.
>
> _

  
  
**_Executrix`s first affidavit_ **

****

The executrix states in her affidavit that she has been advised that the gifts
to items 1 to 5, 8, 9 and 14 in the will may be void for uncertainty as there
are no charitable institutions with those names. She has also been advised
that the gifts to items 6, 10, 11 and 12 in the will may be void for
uncertainty or may not be charitable. Item 7 has been correctly described in
the will but its registered office is at 11 Mount Sophia Blk B [num ]B1-01
Singapore and not at 1 St George`s Lane as stated in the will.  
  
The testatrix had no relatives in Malaysia or in Singapore. As she did not
provide a residuary clause in her will, the residuary estate would go to the
state under the Intestate Succession Act.  
  
**_Next of kin_**

****

An advertisement in English setting out the terms of the originating summons
was placed on 14 May 2001 in The Straits Times in Singapore and in The New
Straits Times in Malaysia inviting persons having any interest as next of kin
of the testatrix to contact Mr TPB Menon. To date, no one has made any claim
as such.  
  
**_The state_**

****

The Attorney General`s Chambers and the Public Trustee`s office have been
informed by the solicitors for the executrix about this originating summons.
They have indicated they will not be participating in these proceedings.  
  
**_Executrix`s second affidavit_**

****

In her second affidavit, the executrix elaborated on the relationship she had
with the testatrix. She first came to know the testatrix in early 1938 while a
student in a kindergarten at the Methodist Girls School in Malacca. The
testatrix was her teacher and was living in the orphanage run by the Methodist
Mission. She became very close to the testatrix as her elder sister also knew
the testatrix. She learned that the testatrix was an orphan from a nearby
rubber estate who had been living in the orphanage since she was two or three
years old.  
  
In late 1938, the testatrix moved to Singapore to take up nursing. She lived
and worked at the then Outram Road General Hospital. In 1945, the executrix
also followed this career path and became a colleague of the testatrix, who
treated her like a younger sister and kept in practically daily contact until
her demise.  
  
The testatrix was a spinster and had no relatives in Malaysia or in Singapore.
Before she made the will of 9 September 1995, the testatrix discussed with the
executrix her desires and intentions concerning the various parties she wished
to make bequests to. When she was decided on the list of beneficiaries, the
executrix brought her to see the late Mr Haridas Ganesan, an advocate and
solicitor and the husband of the executrix. He drafted the will.  
  
They were unaware at that time of the accurate description and correct
addresses of the beneficiaries. Accordingly, on 6 April 2000, after the death
of the testatrix, a meeting of the representatives of the intended
beneficiaries was held in the executrix`s present solicitors` office to
ascertain their particulars.  
  
In so far as item 10 (`the Lam family`) in the will was concerned, the
executrix knew that the testatrix was a close friend and colleague of the late
Charlotte Lam. They had jointly purchased a house at 26 Siglap Hill and lived
there together. When Charlotte Lam passed away in 1982, the testatrix became
the sole owner through the right of survivorship. The house was sold in 1994
at a huge profit.  
  
The testatrix had often mentioned to the executrix that she wanted to leave
some money for Charlotte`s siblings. There were five such siblings but one has
since passed away on 12 October 1999 (ie after the testatrix`s death on 7 May
1999). The testatrix intended that the $250,000 bequest be shared by the five
siblings equally. They are:

(1) Michael Lam;

(2) Beatrice Lam;

(3) Winifred Lam;

(4) David Lam; and

(5) Lam Peng Seng (deceased).  
  
The testatrix attended Wesley Methodist Church at Fort Canning Road with the
executrix regularly for more than 30 years. The testatrix intended to reward
all the pastors for their devotion and commitment to the Church by giving them
$2,000 each.  
  
The testatrix intended to give her flat at 53B Lorong Stangee to the said
church. The executrix has ascertained from the representatives of the Church
that the proper party to be holding the title to the property ought to be `The
Secretary of the Trustees of the Methodist Church in Singapore`. Since the
beneficiary is a charitable trust, she asks that the flat be transferred
absolutely to the Church without the condition stated in the will.  
  
**_Beatrice Lam`s affidavit_**

****

Beatrice Lam confirms that her late sister, Charlotte, and the testatrix were
colleagues and the best of friends. The testatrix was also very close to the
Lam family and went to their home frequently for meals. Her mother and her
sisters would cook and serve the testatrix her favourite food such as assam
fish, bean paste pork and curry chicken.  
  
In 1956, Charlotte purchased 26 Siglap Hill and went to live there alone. Soon
thereafter, Charlotte invited the testatrix to live with her in that house. In
1957, Charlotte mortgaged the property to Malaya Borneo Building Society Ltd
and the testatrix stood as surety. The mortgage was subsequently discharged
and in 1959, Charlotte conveyed the property to herself and the testatrix as
joint tenants.  
  
Before she passed away in 1982, Charlotte, who remained unmarried, expressed
her desire to sever the joint tenancy so that she could transfer her share of
the property to her siblings. However, the testatrix objected.  
  
After Charlotte passed away, Beatrice, as the sole executrix of Charlotte`s
estate, sought legal advice and was informed that the right of survivorship
applied in the testatrix`s favour.  
  
The testatrix began to distance herself from the Lam family after Charlotte`s
death. The Lam family`s mother passed away in 1986. In the early 1990s, as the
Lam family was facing serious financial problems, Beatrice wrote to the
testatrix on 9 December 1993 to appeal to her conscience and to ask that
Charlotte`s share in the property be returned to the Lam family as she had
promised Charlotte on her deathbed. The testatrix did not respond to that
letter.  
  
Beatrice is of the view that the testatrix must have felt beholden to her late
sister and to their family in making the bequests listed as items 6 and 10 in
the will. She states further that the testatrix used to refer to her mother
and her siblings as `the Lam family`.  
  
**_Michael Lam`s affidavit_**

****

Her brother, Michael Lam, the administrator of the estate of the deceased
sibling, confirms Beatrice`s evidence contained in her affidavit.  
  
**_Stanley Peck`s affidavit_**

****

Stanley Peck is the Chairman of the St Andrew`s Cathedral Home for the Aged
located at Blk 341 Clementi Ave 5 [num ]01-148 which was established about 20
years ago with the object of promoting the welfare of the aged without
distinction of sex, race or creed. The Home currently provides shelter for 25
elderly and destitute women. It is supported by donations from members of St
Andrew`s Cathedral and the public. The Home is the only one of its kind set up
for the aged by St Andrew`s Cathedral.  
  
**_Han Kee Fong`s affidavit_**

****

Han Kee Fong, an advocate and solicitor, filed an affidavit on his and Mr
Chelva Rajah SC `s behalf. In his affidavit, he states:

> _
>
> 6\. Through Mr N Ganesan, solicitor for the Executrix, I learnt that the
> Testatrix was by nature a charitable person and she also had fond memories
> of the Executrix`s father-in-law, the late Dr Gopal Haridas. I am also
> informed that the Testatrix had her will drawn up and executed on the very
> day she decided to make same and that she did not take the opportunity of
> checking out the true names of the various organizations, institutions,
> bodies or persons she intended to make the various donations referred to in
> her will. She was then already 79 years of age when she made her will on 5
> (**_sic_**) September 1995.
>
> 7\. In the result, she had left some of the beneficiaries` names incomplete
> or misdescribed in her will. Set out herebelow is a comparison of the names
> and addresses of the relevant beneficiaries as appears in the Testatrix`s

I am informed by Mr Chelva Rajah SC that Dr Gopal Haridas (`the father of
paediatrics`) was the father of the late Haridas Ganesan, the husband of the
executrix.  
  
There is no dispute among the parties as to the identity of Ms Chong Yook Yin
(item 11 in the will). She has been given the $10,000 by the executrix.  
  
**_The decision of the court_**

****

It is helpful to set out some principles on the construction of wills,
especially in relation to charities, stated in **_The Law and Practice
Relating to Charities_** by Hubert Picarda (2nd Ed, 1995) at pp 226-228:

> _**General principle: benignant construction** _

> _There is a well-established maxim that the court leans in favour of charity
> when construing charitable gifts. Charity is always favoured by equity._

> _In the words of Lord Lorebun, `there is no better rule than that a
> benignant construction will be placed upon charitable bequests`. Thus where
> a gift is capable of two constructions, one which would make it void and the
> other which would render it effectual, the latter must be adopted. It is
> better to effectuate than to destroy the intention ..._

> _The court must not on the other hand strain the will to gain money for the
> charity. For in doing so it will cheat the residuary legatees or next of kin
> ..._

> _**Extrinsic evidence** _

> _Extrinsic evidence, in the discussion which follows, means any evidence
> other than the document the contents of which are under consideration. Such
> evidence may, in general, be received whenever a knowledge of extrinsic
> facts can be made ancillary to the right interpretation of the will or
> written instrument in question._

> _However, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to rebut plain words ..._

> _**Ambiguity** _

> _Extrinsic evidence is not admissible for the purpose of interpreting
> a**patent** ambiguity. So, if the amount of a legacy is left blank in a will
> it cannot be ascertained from parole evidence. The same applies where the
> name of the charitable beneficiary is left blank ..._

> _**Misdescription** _

> _Where a legacy has been bequeathed to a specified charitable institution
> the first step is to identify the institution. For if it exists, well and
> good; but if it does not, a cy-prSs problem arises. In most cases executors
> should be able to identify a named institution by reference to the registers
> kept by the Charity Commissioners. It is usually only where a testator has
> named or described incompletely the institution intended to benefit that a
> point of construction may arise for the court. But the fact that an existing
> institution is accurately described does not preclude all possibility of
> there being an ambiguity. There is no absolute rule that a person, whether
> juridicial or natural, answering the description in the will must have the
> gift whatever other considerations arise._

  
  
Section 102 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) provides that nothing in ss
93 to 101 of the Act shall affect the construction of wills. These sections
relate generally to the exclusion of oral evidence by documentary evidence.  
  
Charities can be classified under the following four broad categories:

(1) trusts for the relief of poverty;

(2) trusts for the advancement of education;

(3) trusts for the advancement of religion; and

(4) trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community not falling within
any of the preceding three heads  
  
( **Comrs for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel** [1891] AC 531 at 583).
`The trusts last referred to are not the less charitable in the eye of the
law, because incidentally they benefit the rich as well as the poor, as
indeed, every charity that deserves the name must do either directly or
indirectly` (per Lord Macnaghten in the same case).  
  
It can be seen, without any disrespect to the drafter, that the will was
prepared in a rather casual fashion. In fact, p 3 of the will is in a
different font from the rest of the five-page will (including the backing
sheet). There was obviously no great effort made to ascertain the proper
descriptions and addresses of the various intended beneficiaries. By 1
September 1995, the six-digit postal code was already in use but the will
signed on 9 September 1995 seems oblivious to that fact. Even the testatrix`s
own postal code has been omitted. Indeed, the only two postal codes specified
in the entire will are those of the Wesley Methodist Church and of the firm of
solicitors (at the backing sheet). Even the Church is described in various
ways. A residuary clause was not included when it should have been obvious
that the testatrix`s huge cash assets would still have more than $1m left
after distribution of all the amounts stated.  
  
Such casualness is understandable considering the very close and warm
relationship that the testatrix had with the executrix and presumably with her
late husband as well. It was not so much a case of solicitor meeting client as
a situation of family friends meeting to discuss the testatrix`s future
wishes. Obviously, they understood one another so well that it never occurred
to them that an outsider reading the will would not know immediately what some
terms like `the Lam family` signify.  
  
However, the tenor of the will is clear. The testatrix had no blood relatives
as the evidence incontrovertibly shows and was planning to give away her
worldly possessions to the Church, to institutions which she deemed worthwhile
causes and to certain people whom she had associated with in this life. She
was clearly intending to be kind and generous and to do good when she
expressed the bequests in her will. It is in that broad sense of doing charity
that she was making the `Donations for Charities`.  
  
While all the institutions named would fit within the four categories of
charities discussed earlier, I have no doubt that on the facts of this case,
neither the testatrix nor the solicitor who helped her prepare her will
intended to use the word `charities` in its legal sense. The only issue before
me therefore becomes one of whether the intended beneficiaries can be
sufficiently identified.  
  
I accept the uncontroverted evidence of Han Kee Fong set out in his affidavit.
I also accept the evidence of the executrix and of the Lams that `the Lam
family` refers to the five siblings mentioned earlier and that the gift is
meant to be shared equally among them, including the sibling who passed away
subsequent to the testatrix`s death. There is no dispute as to the identity of
Ms Chong Yook Yin. I also accept the evidence of Stanley Peck. In view of the
very close relationship that the testatrix had with Charlotte Lam, it is
little wonder that she should choose to make a gift of $50,000 to the St
Andrew`s Cathedral Home for the Aged in her memory. The addition of the word
`Anglican` changes nothing as the said Cathedral is Anglican.  
  
`Pastors with letter of thanks` (item 12), read in the context of the will, in
particular paras 1 and 2, clearly refers to the pastors of the Wesley
Methodist Church at Fort Canning Road. I accept the executrix`s evidence that
the testatrix intended each of them to receive $2,000 as a token of
appreciation for their devotion and service. I assume the executrix will use
her discretion in deciding what ought to be included in the letters of thanks
in the same way as she decided the text of the obituary and the message of
thanks mentioned in para 2 of the will.  
  
The Director of Administration of the Wesley Methodist Church, in his letter
of 10 April 2000 to the executrix`s solicitors, identified five ordained
pastors with the honorific `Reverend` and included one Mr Alfred Quah
described as a `Lay Staff, Pastoral Care` as the pastors of the Church. The
reason given was:

> _I have included Mr Alfred Quah on the list of pastors as he has been the
> staff responsible for providing pastoral care to Emily in the last months of
> her stay._

  
  
I am informed by Mr N Ganesan that there are many lay pastors like Mr Alfred
Quah in that Church. With respect, I feel that including a particular lay
pastor when there are many others would probably be giving a twist to what the
testatrix meant by `pastors`. I conclude that the only meaningful way of
interpreting that clause in the will is to say it refers to the ordained
pastors in that Church at the time of the testatrix`s death.  
  
Item 13 in the will (`Tea or lunch after Church Service and other costs to be
paid`) with no amount specified as a gift is hopelessly indeterminate both in
scope and in quantum and must necessarily fail as a gift.  
  
In so far as the gift of the flat is concerned, I see no justification for
transferring the flat to the Church shorn of the restriction imposed by the
testatrix.  
  
Mr TPB Menon suggests that the residue of the estate after payment out of all
the stated amounts and proper expenses should be placed with the Public
Trustee for one year before payment out to the state on the ground of bona
vacantia in case some next of kin of the testatrix should appear. I do not
think that is necessary here. It is quite clear that there is no such next of
kin and the money is after all going to the state and not to some individual
or private organisation.  
  
I therefore make the following orders:

(1) Beneficiaries 1 to 5, 7 to 9 and 14 - I declare that these refer to the
beneficiaries stated in para 7 of Han Kee Fong`s affidavit of 7 September
2001.

(2) Beneficiary 6 - refers to St Andrew`s Cathedral Home for the Aged.

(3) Beneficiaries 10 and 11 - the gifts are valid and refer to the five Lam
siblings and Ms Chong Yook Yin. Each of the Lam siblings should receive
$50,000.

(4) Beneficiary 12 - `Pastors` refer to the five ordained pastors of the
Wesley Methodist Church at the time of the testatrix`s death. It does not
include lay pastors.

(5) Beneficiary 13 - the gift fails for ambiguity.

(6) 53B Lorong Stangee is to be conveyed to `the Secretary of the Trustees of
the Methodist Church in Singapore` with the restriction imposed by the
testatrix in her will.

(7) Costs of all solicitors to be paid on an indemnity basis out of the
estate.

(8) I declare that there is an intestacy as to the residuary estate of the
testatrix and that such residuary estate should be paid to the state after all
gifts and expenses have been paid out, without the need to place any moneys
with the Public Trustee for any period of time.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
