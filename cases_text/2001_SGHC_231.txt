**JUDGMENT:**

_

Introduction

_

1\. This is an appeal against the decision of Kan Ting Chiu J sanctioning a
scheme of arrangement made between the company, CEL Tractors Pte Ltd (CEL
Tractors) and ten creditors under section 210 of the Companies Act (Cap. 50,
1994 ed) (the Companies Act). One of the creditors, Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd
(Daewoo) objected to the scheme and now appeals against Kan Js decision.

_

The facts

_

2\. The facts are not in dispute and are briefly these. CEL Tractors have
proposed a scheme of arrangement dated 23 February 2001 (the scheme) expressed
to be made between CEL Tractors and ten creditors, one of whom was Daewoo. All
the ten creditors hold guarantees in respect of loans and liabilities owed by
CEL Tractors to them respectively. In particular Daewoo have a guarantee given
by one Mr Lim Chee Seng (Mr Lim) in respect of monies owing to them by CEL
Tractors. Mr Lim is a director of CEL Tractors.

3\. For the purpose of this appeal, the material terms of the scheme are those
contained in cl 4. Briefly they are as follows. Under cl 4.1, CEL Tractors are
obliged to pay certain sums of money to the creditors within certain times;
and under cl 4.2, CEL Tractors are obliged to grant to the respective
creditors an option entitling them to require CEL Tractors to allot and issue
to them certain numbers of shares credited as fully paid in the capital of CEL
Tractors. All these options become exercisable at a certain time. The
controversial part of the scheme is cl 4.3, which is as follows:

> 4.3 Release of Security Documents and Guarantees
>
> 4.3.1 Upon the Company fulfilling its obligations under Clause 4.1.1.1 and
> Clause 4.1.1.2, (a) the Bank Creditors shall fully and completely discharge
> all and any of its rights under the Deed of Debenture and the Creditors
> Mortgage, and save for Keppel TatLee Bank Limited, shall fully and
> completely release each and every Bank Guarantor from his obligations under
> any and each Bank Guarantee, and (b) Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd shall fully
> and completely release the Daewoo Guarantor from his obligations under the
> Daewoo Guarantee.
>
> 4.3.2 Upon the Company fulfilling its obligations under Clause 4.1.1, Keppel
> TatLee Bank Limited shall fully and completely discharge all and any of its
> rights under the Keppel Mortgage, and shall fully and completely release
> each and every Bank Guarantor from his obligations under any and each Bank
> Guarantee in its favour.
>
> 4.3.3 If the Creditors decide to exercise the option for the First Tranche
> and the second Tranche pursuant to Clause 4.2.3, (a) the Bank Creditors
> shall fully and completely discharge all and any of its rights under the
> Deed of Debenture and the Creditors Mortgage, and save for Keppel TatLee
> Bank Limited, shall fully and completely release each and every Bank
> Guarantor from his obligations under any and each Bank Guarantee, and (b)
> Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd shall fully and completely release the Daewoo
> Guarantor from his obligations under the Daewoo Guarantee.

4\. Section 210 of the Companies Act allows, among other things, a compromise
or arrangement to be made between the company and its creditors or any class
of creditors. In so far as relevant, the provisions of s 210 are as follows:

> 210.(1) Where a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a company and
> its creditors or any class of them the Court may, on the application in a
> summary way of the company or of any creditor order a meeting of the
> creditors or class of creditors to be summoned in such manner as the Court
> directs.
>
> (2) ..
>
> (3) If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the
> creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members present and
> voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting or the adjourned meeting
> agrees to any compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement
> shall, if approved by order of the Court, be binding on all the creditors or
> class of creditors or on the members or class of members, as the case may
> be, and also on the company or, in the case of a company in the course of
> being wound up, on the liquidator and contributories of the company."

5\. We should mention that, in the case of a compromise or arrangement with
creditors of a company, s 210 is applicable only if the compromise or
arrangement as proposed is one made between the company and all its creditors
or any class of its creditors. It is unclear from the facts deposed in the
affidavits whether the ten creditors are all the creditors CEL Tractors or
they form a class of the creditors of CEL Tractors. However, no issue was
raised on this point, and for the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the
ten creditors are either all the creditors or form a class of the creditors of
CEL Tractors.

6\. Pursuant to s 210(1), an order of court was obtained by CEL Tractors on 2
February 2001, directing them to convene a meeting of the ten creditors for
the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, approving the scheme.
Accordingly, a meeting of the creditors was duly convened for the purpose. At
the meeting, the scheme was put to vote and was approved by a majority
representing not less than three-fourths in value of the debts of the
creditors present and voting, namely eight out of the ten creditors, holding
95.62% of the debts, with one creditor abstaining. Only Daewoo voted against
the scheme.

7\. Having obtained the requisite majority of the creditors at the meeting,
CEL Tractors applied to court for approval of the scheme under s 210(3) of the
Companies Act. At the hearing of the application, predictably Daewoo objected
to the scheme. They raised two objections. The first objection was that the
scheme as drafted requires them to release the guarantor from his obligations
under the guarantee given to them for the debt of CEL Tractors. That was the
guarantee issued by Mr Lim in favour of Daewoo. Under the guarantee, Mr Lim
guaranteed the payment of all monies and liabilities owing by CEL Tractors to
Daewoo. It was contended on their behalf that such release was unfair to
Daewoo as the guarantee was a valuable security to them. The second objection
is that a scheme of arrangement under s 210 of the Companies Act could not
embody a term which had the effect of discharging the liability of a third
party, such as a guarantor, for the debt or liability of CEL Tractors or make
such a term as part of the scheme. Mr Lee Young Kwon, the finance manager of
Daewoo, in his affidavit filed in opposition to the scheme, said at 7, 11 and
12 as follows:

> 7\. The principle reason why Daewoo is objecting to the scheme of
> arrangement is because the scheme of arrangement as drafted/passed requires
> Daewoo to release a guarantee given by a director of CEL on 15 August 1998
> i.e. one Lim Chee Seng. A copy of the said guarantee is now produced and
> shown to me marked as "YKL-1".
>
> 11\. I wish to state that sanction of the scheme is unfair to Daewoo as the
> said Lim Chee Sengs debt to Daewoo under the said guarantee is a personal
> debt which he owes to Daewoo, wherein he contracts as principle debtor. By
> allowing the scheme to encompass the guarantee, Daewoo would be losing a
> valuable security and/or an opportunity to recover its losses from an
> independent third party, which is over and above the debt which CEL owes to
> Daewoo.
>
> 12\. I verily believe that a scheme of arrangement under Section 210 of the
> Companies Act cannot encompass a scheme which allows the debts or financial
> obligations of a non-company or third party individual to be forgiven or to
> form part of a comprehensive settlement of a companys debts as Section 210
> of the Companies Act should only allow a scheme of arrangement in relation
> to debts owed by the Company itself.

8\. The first objection raises the question of fairness of the scheme to
Daewoo, which, however, was not canvassed before the court below. It was not
suggested that the scheme was unfair to Daewoo in anyway. True it is that cl
4.3.1 of the scheme requires Daewoo to release the guarantor, Mr Lim, from his
liability under the guarantee in respect of CEL Tractors debts owed to them.
But Daewoo have not been singled out in this respect. All the other creditors
have been treated alike. They are required to discharge their securities and
also to release their guarantors from the guarantees respectively. In
particular, the Bank creditors (as described therein) are required to
discharge the securities given to them, such as the mortgages and debenture,
and also to release the the Bank Guarantors from their guarantees
respectively.

9\. The second objection is this. The scheme expressly incorporates provisions
requiring the creditors to discharge and release their securities and further
to release the guarantors from their liabilities under the guarantees for the
debts and liabilities of CEL Tractors. It was argued that a scheme of
arrangement under s 210 of the Companies Act could not encompass such
provisions on the ground that a scheme under that section bound only the
company and the creditors and therefore could only discharge or affect the
debts and liabilities of the company and not the liability of a third party,
such as a guarantor, for the same debts and liabilities of the company.

_

The decision below

_

10\. The judge examined the Australian and English cases dealing with
statutory schemes of arrangement, and acknowledged that there were authorities
to the effect that a scheme of arrangement could not affect the rights of
third parties. However, he regarded the authorities as only persuasive and
chose to adopt the approach in the analogous case of _Johnson v Davies_ [1998]
2 BCLC 252 decided by the English Court of Appeal. The judge agreed with the
reasoning in _Johnson v Davies_ and accordingly held that a scheme of
arrangement could similarly discharge the liability of a third party such as a
guarantor. He also justified this proposition on the ground of policy. He
said:

> 26\. In my view s 210(3) should be given its plain meaning, i.e. that an
> approved arrangement binds all the creditors. It cannot matter that an
> objecting creditor has not consented to be bound because he is nevertheless
> bound by the operation of law. I do not see any reason why the arrangement
> has to have his support for the provision to take effect and for the
> arrangement to bind him.
>
> 27\. I do not agree that an arrangement cannot discharge the liability of a
> party who is not a party to it. That view ignores the commercial framework
> of such arrangements. It is not unusual for the creditors of a company to
> hold guarantees from the major shareholders and directors of the company. It
> is not uncommon for these shareholders and directors to be the main players
> in seeking an arrangement with the creditors by offering their own assets in
> satisfaction of the debts owed by the company in return for the release of
> their guarantees. In such situation the creditors cannot be permitted to
> take the benefits offered by the arrangement and also retain the benefit of
> the guarantees.
>
> 28\. The better policy is to allow the release of guarantors when that has
> been expressly provided for, than to refuse it. It should be remembered that
> a scheme of arrangement must have the support of the majority of the
> creditors and approved by court before it takes effect. After a scheme is
> accepted by the creditors, an objecting creditor can persuade the court to
> withhold its approval, or to approve it subject to such alternatives or
> conditions as it thinks fit (see s 210(4)). The objecting creditor would
> succeed if he can show that the creditors did not vote _bona fide_ for the
> benefit of the creditors or the company as a whole (see _Re Wedgwood Coal
> and Iron Co_ (1877) 6 Ch D 627), or that the scheme is not fair and
> reasonable (see _Re Dorman, Long & Co_ [1934] Ch 635). I find it difficult
> to agree that as a matter of policy or principle an arrangement cannot be
> allowed to release guarantors, regardless of its terms.

_

The appeal

_

11 Before us it has not been suggested that the scheme is in anyway unfair or
discriminatory or that the majority creditors in approving the scheme were not
acting bona fide and that Daewoo being the minority were coerced to promote
the interests of the majority. Therefore, no issue of unfairness,
discrimination or absence of bona fides arises in this appeal.

12 The only objection raised before us by Mr Tan Cheng Han, counsel for
Daewoo, is that the scheme cannot contain or embody a term which has the
effect of discharging the liability of a third party, such as a guarantor, for
any indebtedness or liability of the company or make such a term as part of
the scheme. The basis for this objection is that it is settled law that a
scheme of arrangement made between a company and its creditors and approved
under s 210 of the Companies Act does not affect the liability of a guarantor
to pay the debt of the company which he has guaranteed. In support, counsel
relies on some Australian and English cases. As we will show in a moment,
these cases are concerned with the question as to the effect of a scheme of
arrangement on the liability of a co-debtor or surety of the company which is
subjected to the scheme of arrangement, and not really with the question
whether a scheme of arrangement can embody a term seeking to discharge the
liability of a co-debtor or surety of the company.

_

Effect of a statutory scheme of arrangement

_

13**** We turn first to the leading case of****_Hill v Anderson Meat
Industries_ [1971] 1 NSWLR 868. There, a company, Anderson Meat Industries Ltd
(Anderson") and its five subsidiaries were in financial difficulties, and
schemes of arrangement were made between the subsidiaries and their creditors
respectively under s 181(1) of the Companies Act 1961 (the equivalent of our s
210) whereby, among other things, in consideration of a payment to the
creditors amounting to sixty cents to the dollar the debts owed to the
creditors would be extinguished and discharged. One of the subsidiaries,
Anderson Meat Packing Co Pty Ld, was indebted to a Mrs Hill, and the debt was
guaranteed by Anderson. Mrs Hill voted against the scheme. There was no
provision in the schemes, which discharged any guarantee given for the debts
and liabilities of the subsidiaries. The schemes were approved by the
requisite majority and by the court. Mrs Hill later sued Anderson for the
amount due under the guarantee, contending that Anderson remained liable to
her under the guarantee, notwithstanding the schemes. At first instance,
Street J, having considered the distinction between a debt discharged by
contract and one discharged by operation of law, said at p 875:

> Essentially the point for present determination turns upon whether there is
> a valid distinction between a composition within the bankruptcy legislation
> or a scheme within a current winding up on the one hand, and a scheme
> outside a winding upon the other. In my judgment the point of distinction,
> although it exists, is too fine to be recognized. Where, as here, a Scheme
> of Arrangement is propounded in connection with the affairs of an insolvent
> company, then the courts approval under s. 181 will give to the scheme a
> statutory operation upon the relationship between the debtor and its
> creditors, and so far as concerns a guarantor, in the absence of any special
> provision in the guarantee agreement, the guarantors liability subsists in
> exactly the same manner as if the scheme had been formally approved within a
> current winding up.

The learned judge therefore held that the liability of Anderson under the
guarantee was not discharged. On appeal, his decision was affirmed: [1972] 2
NSWLR 704. Jacobs P said at p 706:

> What has been submitted to this Court is that by the terms of the scheme,
> particularly cl 3 which I have set out, the debt owing by the packing
> company to Mrs Hill extinguished. Next, because a guarantee is an accessory
> obligation, upon the extinguishment of the principal indebtedness the
> guarantee goes also, as a result of the fact that there is no principal debt
> to which the accessory liability can attach. It is conceded, as of course it
> must be, that these principles do not apply where the obligation is
> extinguished by operation of law, as for instance in the case of bankruptcy
> or the winding up of a company, but it is submitted that the obligation in
> the present case is not extinguished by operation of law but rather is
> extinguished by the terms of the scheme which impose not only upon those
> creditors who assent to it, but upon all creditors, the effect of the
> document which constitutes the scheme. In this way it is submitted that the
> cases which are referred to by Street J are distinguishable.
>
> The argument is not substantially different from that which was propounded
> before the judge at first instance. He rejected it upon the ground that
> there is in fact a discharge of the obligation by operation of the law. I
> agree with this conclusion. Mrs Hill was never a party to the release of the
> obligation. The release came through the operation of a law which bound her
> as though she were a party. This seems to me in principle to be within that
> line of authority which so clearly establishes that the extinguishment of a
> principal obligation, when it is brought about by operation of law, does not
> result in a discharge of the surety."

14 The decision in _Hill_ was followed in Australia. In particular, in _Gan v
Sanders and Anor_(1994) 15 ACSR 298, the Supreme Court of Victoria held that
the deed of arrangement entered into between Luxville Pte Ltd (the debtor
company) and its creditors did not discharge the third party surety. Mandie J
said at p 301:

> It is true that cl 5 speaks of a discharge although that discharge is in
> consideration of the entitlements of creditors under the deed. It is clear
> from cll 4, 5, 6 and 12(c) that the creditors remain entitled to participate
> in distributions as referred to therein. Indeed, cl 6 refers to the
> extinguishment of debts and claims "if the administrator has paid to the
> creditors their full entitlements under this deed". The deed takes and is
> binding by virtue of ss 444D, 444E and 444G of the Corporation Law.
>
> In _Hill v Anderson Meat Industries Ltd_ [1972] 2 NSWLR 704, there was a
> scheme of arrangement which had been approved by the court under the then
> provisions of the Companies Act. The scheme, like the deed in this case, in
> substance substituted a right to participate in distributions for the
> original debt which was extinguished. The New South Wales Court of Appeal
> held that the extinguishment of the principal debt occurred by operation of
> law and hence did not result in the discharge of the surety. In my view, the
> present case is indistinguishable.

15 The New Zealand courts have likewise followed suit. In the High Court case
of _Re Southern World Airlines Ltd_ [1993] 1 NZLR 597, a scheme of arrangement
was designed to resuscitate Southern World Airlines Ltd with a buy-out by a
new operator. The scheme, among other things, expressly provided for the
assignment of the debts of the company to a nominee of the new operator and
further provided that thereafter the creditors would have no further claim
against the company. Upon the application to court for sanction of the scheme,
two creditors objected to the scheme. One of the objections made was that one
of the two creditors held a guarantee from another party for part of the debt
owed by the company and that the scheme might discharge the guarantee.
However, there was no term in the scheme which sought to extinguish the rights
of the creditor under the guarantee. Williams J held that the scheme did not
extinguish third party liabilities. He said at p 605:

> In the present case the scheme of arrangement required the creditors in
> consideration of their receipt of certain money from the scheme manager to
> assign the amount of their debts and the creditors "shall not henceforth
> assert against the company any claim action or proceeding arising from any
> indebtedness matter instrument or thing existing prior to the commencement
> date. It was submitted that what would happen to the creditors debts under
> this scheme just as in the other forms of scheme, occurred by operation of
> law and not by the voluntary act of the creditor so there could not be a
> discharge of the guarantor
>
> In summary the applicant submitted that it was not the form of the scheme
> which mattered in terms of whether the guarantee was discharged but rather
> whether the scheme of arrangement occurred by operation of law. Fine
> distinctions between schemes were immaterial the key issue was the principle
> expounded in _Hill v Anderson Meat_ which was of general application. I
> uphold those contentions.

16 Similar pronouncement was made in _Buttle v Allan as Official Liquidator of
Buttle & Co Sharebrokers Ltd (In Liquidation)_ [1994] 1 NZLR 396 at p 404,
where the New Zealand Court of Appeal said:

> "We accept _Hills_ case as being a correct statement of the law in New
> Zealand as well as in Australia. The sanctioning of a scheme of arrangement
> does not discharge the original debt for all purposes any more than does the
> adjudication in bankruptcy of the debtor or the winding up of a debtor
> company. It does not affect the liability of a guarantor, even though that
> liability is expressed in the form of a guarantee of the original debt."

17 We now turn to the English authorities. In _Ex p Jacobs, Re Jacobs_ (1875)
LR 10 Ch App 211, one James Martin was the holder of a bill of exchange which
was drawn by a person called Sydney Jacobs upon one Samuel Phillips. The bill
was dishonoured, and Phillips, being unable to pay his debts, called a meeting
of his creditors, and a composition was agreed upon between him and the
requisite number of creditors pursuant to s 125 and 126 of the English
Bankruptcy Act 1869. The issue for determination before the court was whether
Jacobs liability to Martin was discharged by virtue of the composition. The
court held that the discharge of Phillips was by operation of law and that
Jacob was not discharged. Mellish LJ said at p 213:

> There can be no doubt that, if the holder of a bill, by becoming party to a
> deed or arrangement, independently of any bankruptcy Act, agrees to accept a
> composition from the acceptor, he thereby discharges the drawer; but, on the
> other hand, it is equally clear that if the acceptor is discharged from his
> liability by operation of law by becoming a bankrupt, the liability of the
> drawer to the holder is not thereby affected.

18 In _Re London Chartered Bank of Australia_ [1893] 3 Ch 540, Vaughan
Williams J considered a scheme of arrangement proposed by a bank under s 2 of
the Joint Stock Companies Arrangement Act 1870 (which, so far as material, is
substantially similar to our s 210). An objection was made to the scheme on
the ground that it did not reserve the right of the creditors against the
sureties of the company for the latters debts. The learned judge held that
there was no need to insert such a reservation in the scheme. In considering
the terms and the effect of the scheme, the learned judge said at pp 546 547:

> The scheme contains no release of the bank or the contributories; it
> contains no covenant not to sue, and it is by operation of law that the
> scheme becomes effective to relieve the company and contributories from
> further liability than that contemplated or imposed by the scheme. The
> scheme of arrangement under the Act of 1870 is as I have had occasion to
> point out in several cases an alternative mode of liquidation which the law
> allows the statutory majority of creditors to substitute for the pending
> winding-up, whether voluntary or under the Court, just as the _Bankruptcy
> Act_ , 1869, allowed the creditors the substituted liquidation by
> arrangement under sect. 125, or composition under sect. 126, of that Act,
> for a pending bankruptcy. The discharge of the bankrupt in such case was
> statutory and not conventional, and therefore by operation of law. Just so
> here, under the Act of 1870. The discharge of the company or contributories
> under the _Joint Stock Companies Arrangement Act_ , 1870, is by operation of
> law effected by the stay of actions imposed .. It seems to me, then, that
> the discharge being clearly by operation of law consequent upon statutory
> liquidation, the principles laid down by Lord Justice Mellish in _In re
> Jacobs_ ((1875) LR 10 Ch App 211) apply, and that, therefore, there is no
> need, and it would not be right, to introduce a reservation of rights
> against sureties into the scheme of arrangement.

19 In a similar vein was the case of _Dane v Mortgage Insurance Corp Ltd_
[1893] 1 QB 54 decided by the Court of Appeal. There, the defendants by an
instrument purported to be a policy of insurance guaranteed the plaintiff that
they would pay her a certain sum of money, if a certain bank defaulted in
making payment on a loan agreement. Subsequently, the bank defaulted and
proposed a scheme of arrangement with the creditors under the Australian
legislation, and the scheme was approved by the requisite majority of
creditors and the court. The plaintiff did not assent to the scheme, which
however under the legislation was binding on her. She later brought an action
against the defendants under the guarantee. Although the court was undecided
as to whether the liability of the defendants was in the nature of a
suretyship or an insurance contract, it was unanimous that the defendants were
liable notwithstanding the scheme of arrangement. Kay LJ following _Re Jacobs_
(supra) said at p 63:

> It was decided in _Ex parte Jacobs_ (1875) LR 10 Ch App 211 that a
> resolution for liquidation or composition, though binding on all the
> creditors, is a discharge of the debtor by operation of law, and does not
> discharge the surety. Assuming that this contract was, as contended by the
> defendants counsel, a mere contract of guarantee or suretyship, it seems to
> me that default did occur within the meaning of that contract, and that
> therefore a right of action vested in the plaintiff to which what occurred
> afterwards affords no kind of defence.

20 In _Re Garners Motors, Limited_ [1937] 1 Ch 594, two companies Sentinel
Waggons Works Ltd (Sentinel) and Garners Motors Ltd (Garners Motors) were
under a joint and several liability to Temple Press Ltd in respect of certain
payments. Sentinel went into receivership and a scheme of arrangement was
proposed by Sentinel to be made with its creditors and shareholders under s
153 of the Companies Act 1929 (which was identical in all material respects
with our s 210). The scheme was sanctioned by the court. Pursuant to the
scheme of arrangement, Temple Press Ltd accepted a certain payment from
Sentinel, which discharged all the liability of Sentinel. Later, Garners
Motors went into liquidation, and Temple Press lodged a proof of debt for the
balance sum owing. The proof was rejected by the liquidators of Garners
Motors. The question was whether the scheme of arrangement of Sentinel
discharged the liability of Garners Motors to Temple Press Ltd. Crossman J
held that a statutory scheme did not have this effect and said, at p 598:

> It is settled law that accord and satisfaction between a creditor and one of
> several debtors, who are jointly and severally liable to the creditor,
> discharges the other debtors unless it appears from the terms of the
> agreement or the surrounding circumstances that the creditor intended to
> reserve his rights against them But in my judgment a discharge of one of
> several joint debtors by operation of law does not discharge the other
> debtors. In my judgment the effect of s 153 of the Companies Act, 1929, is
> to give to a scheme when sanctioned by the Court under the section a
> statutory operation. The scheme when sanctioned by the Court becomes
> something quite different from a mere agreement signed by the parties. It
> becomes a statutory scheme. In my judgment, therefore, the discharge of
> Sentinel Waggon Works, Ld., from the debt to Temple Press, Ld., which was
> effected under clause 15 of the scheme sanctioned by the Court on March 23,
> 1936, did not have the effect of discharging Garners Motors, Ld., from its
> liability in respect of the debt. It is settled law that a discharge of one
> of several judgment-debtors by operation of law does not release the other
> debtors. But in my judgment the effect of s 153 of the Companies Act, 1929,
> is to give a scheme when sanctioned by the Court a statutory operation.

Settled law

21 On the basis of these authorities, it is settled law that a scheme of
arrangement or compromise made between a company and its creditors in relation
to its debts and liabilities, approved by the requisite majority of the
creditors and by the court, affects only the rights of the creditors against
the company, and does not affect the rights of the creditors against a third
party, such as a guarantor, for the same debts and liabilities of the company.
Consequently, where such scheme discharges either in whole or in part the
debts owed by the company to its creditors, it does not operate as a discharge
of the liability of the guarantor for the same debts or liabilities of the
company. However, in all these cases, the schemes in question did not contain
any express term requiring the creditors to extinguish or discharge the
liability of a third party, such as a guarantor, for the debts or liabilities
of the company concerned. In the instant case, the scheme contains an express
provision to the effect that upon the company, CEL Tractors, observing and
performing their obligations under the scheme, the creditors will release the
guarantors from their obligations under the respective guarantees. In this
respect, the instant case is distinguishable from these cases, which therefore
do not really assist in the resolution of the issue before us.

_

Issues

_

22 It seems to us that in this case there are really two issues for
determination. The first is whether it is permissible to incorporate in a
scheme of arrangement or compromise under s 210 of the Companies Act, as was
incorporated in the present scheme under consideration, a term to the effect
that, upon the company performing its obligations as regards payments and
other things vis--vis the creditors under the scheme, the creditors will
release the guarantors from their obligations under the respective guarantee.
The second is whether such a term is valid and effectual for the purpose.

23 On the first question, we can see no reason in principle why a scheme of
arrangement or compromise under s 210 of the Companies Act cannot incorporate
such a term. No cases have been cited to us to say that such a term cannot be
embodied in a scheme. After all, a scheme of arrangement or compromise
proposed by a company to be made with its creditors or a class of creditors
under s 210 of the Companies Act is no more than a proposal to vary or modify
its obligations in relation to its debts and liabilities owed to its creditors
or a class of creditors on certain terms and conditions. In seeking so to vary
or modify its obligations, there is nothing to prevent the company from
proposing, as part of a wider scheme, inter alia, a term to the effect that,
in consideration of what the company has provided under the scheme, the
creditors will, upon implementation of the scheme, discharge not only the
debts and liabilities of the company but also the liabilities of the
guarantors for the same debts and liabilities of the company. Whether such a
term is agreeable to its creditors is a different matter; it all depends on
the circumstances of the case and what the company has to offer under the
scheme as a quid pro quo for the discharge of these liabilities.

24 It is trite law that, where a scheme of arrangement or compromise
(containing such a term) is approved by all the creditors of the company, it
is binding on the company as well as its creditors. In such a case, there is
no need on the part of the company to invoke s 210 of the Companies Act. The
scheme is wholly a contractual scheme. Where, as is usually the case, it is
not practical or practicable to secure the unanimous agreement of all the
creditors, s 210 is invoked. And when s 210 is invoked, and the scheme is
approved by the requisite majority of the creditors and the court, the scheme
becomes binding on all the creditors or the class of creditors (as the case
may be). That is provided in s 210(3) of the Act. The binding effect of the
scheme is given by the court order approving the scheme. As Street J said in
_Re Norfolk Island And Byron Bay Whaling Co Ltd_ (1969) 90 WN (NSW) 351 at 354
with reference to s 181 of the Companies Act 1961 of the State of New South
Wales (which is the equivalent of our s 210), the section is intended to
provide a machinery (i) for overcoming the impossibility or impracticability
of obtaining the individual consent of every member of the class intended to
be bound thereby, and (ii) for preventing, in appropriate circumstances, a
minority of class members frustrating a beneficial scheme.

25 We now turn to another aspect of a scheme of arrangement or compromise
under s 210 of the Companies Act. It is permissible in law to incorporate in a
scheme an involvement or participation by an outsider, that is, a party not a
party to the scheme. Indeed, quite often, a scheme does provide for such
involvement or participation by an outsider. Quite often, a scheme as devised
provides for a buy out or an injection of cash by an outsider and it has been
held that such a scheme falls within the purview of that section. In _Re A and
C Constructions Pty Limited_[1970] SASR 565, the Supreme Court of South
Australia held that the court would not refuse to approve a scheme under s 181
of the Companies Act 1962-1968 (which was the equivalent of our s 210) merely
because (i) the scheme provided for an outsider to purchase the company
structure in order to obtain a tax benefit, and (ii) that a person other than
the company, its members and creditors was a party to the scheme. Bray CJ said
at p 568:

> An order of the court under s 181(2) is necessary so that a dissentient,
> non-voting or absentee minority of creditors or members may be bound by the
> scheme. Otherwise everything could be done contractually. The order of the
> court in the terms of the sub-section is made binding only on the creditors
> or members, or particular class of creditors or members, and on the company,
> or, if the company is being wound up, also on its liquidator and
> contributories. It is, however, in my view, a fallacy to assume that
> therefore no other person can be a party to the scheme. In my view, so long
> as the scheme can properly be described as a compromise or arrangement
> between a company and its members or creditors or any class of them within
> the meaning of s 181(1), it is immaterial that other persons are parties to
> it, but its binding force on such other parties will derive from the scheme
> as a contract, or from some other contract, and not from the order of the
> court.

A similar pronouncement was made by another member of the court, Wells J who
said at p 574:

> A scheme that includes provisions that may without doubt be said to
> constitute a compromise or arrangement of the kind described by s 181 does
> not cease to fall within the jurisdiction conferred upon the court by that
> section by reason only of the inclusion within the scheme of an outsider a
> person not the company, a member or a creditor but the extent to which the
> stranger will be bound by the scheme will depend on the inherent contractual
> validity of the scheme with respect to the stranger, and not upon any order
> of the court under s 181 signifying its approval of the scheme.

26 In _Re Glendale Land Development Ltd (in liq)_ [1982] 9 ACLR 171, a scheme
of arrangement proposed by the company under s 315(1) of the Companies (NSW)
Code involved a third party in the implementation of the scheme. On the
application by the company for directions to convene a meeting of creditors,
McLelland J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales considered whether the
scheme could contain such a provision involving an outsider. He held that an
arrangement between a company and its relevant creditors was not outside the
scope of s 315 merely because it was part of a wider scheme involving an
outsider or an outsider was a necessary party to the implementation of the
scheme. The learned judge said at p 173:

> [A]n arrangement between a company and its relevant creditors or members is
> not outside the scope of such a provision as s 315 merely because it is part
> of a wider scheme involving outsiders, or an outsider is a necessary party
> to its implementation. This is in any event made abundantly clear by the
> provisions of s 317.

In coming to this conclusion, the learned judge followed the decision in _Re A
and C Construction Pty Ltd_ (supra) and adopted those parts of the judgments
of Bray CJ and Wells J quoted above.

27 The scheme before us involves also third parties but in a passive way.
Under cl 4.3 of the scheme, the creditors of CEL Tractors are required, upon
the CEL Tractors performing their obligations under the scheme, to release the
guarantors from the obligations to pay the debts and liabilities of the
company under the respective guarantees. In our judgment, there is no reason
why the scheme may not contain such a provision.

28 We now turn to the second question, which is whether such a term is valid
and effectual, bearing in mind that the guarantors are not a party to the
scheme. It has been held in a couple of Australian cases that even if a scheme
contained a term seeking to discharge the rights of the creditors against the
guarantors, such a scheme would not affect the rights of the creditors against
the guarantors for the debt or liability of the company concerned.

29 The first is _Re Buildmat (Australia) Pty Ltd And The Companies Act_ (1981)
5 ACLR 689 which is relied upon by Daewoo. A company, Buildmat, had covenanted
to pay to the landlord of certain premises the rents and other outgoings of
the tenant, Piermat. The latter subsequently entered into an arrangement with
its creditors whereby, among other things, upon certain payments being made,
Piermat would be under no further liability to its creditors. The scheme also
contained a term to the effect that the creditors would relinquish all their
rights under the guarantees and indemnities given in respect of Piermats
indebtedness. The scheme was approved by the requisite majority of Piermats
creditors and by the court. The landlord subsequently petitioned for the
winding up of Buildmat relying on the latters failure to meet their
obligations to make certain payments due under the lease. Needham J of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales held that, notwithstanding the express
provision in the scheme of arrangement, the scheme did not discharge the
liability of Buildmat. He said at pp 691-692:

> In my opinion, cl 15 of the lease is not an indemnity: it creates a joint
> and several liability in the lessee and the covenantor However, it does not
> seem to me to matter, in this case, whether I am right or wrong in that
> conclusion, because, even if cl 15 constitutes an indemnity, the scheme does
> not effect a discharge of that indemnity
>
> It is, I think, well established by decisions binding on me that the
> contractual relationship existing between the creditors of a company and the
> company after the approval by the court of a scheme of arrangement under s
> 181 of the Companies Act 1961, is a relationship created by the operation of
> the Act on the order of the court It follows, as the Court of Appeal has
> held (in _Hill v Anderson Meat Industries_ [1972] 2 NSWLR 704) that, where a
> creditors debt has been discharged by the operation of a scheme of
> arrangement approved by the court, the approval of the scheme does not
> affect the right of a creditor bound by the scheme to take proceedings for
> recovery against a guarantor.

30 We would make two observations. First, what the learned judge said is, in
our respectful view, strictly correct; that was clearly the position as
between the creditor and the guarantor, Buildmat. However, it does not follow
that as between the creditor and Piermat such a term had no effect and was not
binding on the creditor, and that Piermat could not take proceedings to
enforce that term. This particular point was not discussed or mentioned by
Needham J in his judgment. Secondly, the learned judge founded his decision on
_Hill_ , but the schemes in _Hill_ did not contain such an express term
extinguishing the rights of the creditors against the guarantors. To that
extent, _Hill_ is distinguishable from _Buildmat_.

31 __ The next case is _Re Andersens Home Furnishing Co Pty Ltd_ (1996) 14
ACLC 1,710. There, the directors of a company, Edshar, appointed an
administrator under Part 5.3A of the Corporation Law, and the administrator
drew up a deed of arrangement proposed to be made between the company and its
creditors. Under the deed the directors were to sell their house and to use
the proceeds to pay the creditors and upon such payment the creditors were
deemed to have released the directors from their guarantees. At a meeting of
creditors called to consider the proposed deed, the motion that the deed be
approved and executed was carried with the requisite majority. Two of the
creditors who were against the deed had guarantees given by the directors of
the company. One of these two creditors applied to court to terminate the deed
on the ground that it was unfairly discriminatory against it. Demack J,
following _Hill v Anderson Meat Industries Ltd_ (supra), held that the deed
did not extinguish the rights of the creditors against the guarantors. The
learned judge said at p 1,714:

> Applying that decision here, Lacys [the guarantors] have given a guarantee
> to Andersens that they will meet Edshars debts. If the Deed operates as a
> discharge of Edshars obligations to Andersens, it does so by virtue of s.
> 444D and not by virtue of any agreement between Edshar and Andersens. In
> those circumstances it does not discharge Lacys obligations to Andersens. In
> the words of s 444D(1), the deed binds all creditors of the company so far
> as it concerns claims arising on or before the day specified in the deed.
> The claims that are referred to are claims against the company, not claims a
> creditor might make against a person who has guaranteed the payment of the
> debts of the company .

Later the learned judge said:

> However, by this Deed, the creditors meeting has purported to release Lacys
> from personal obligations they have assumed towards Andersens and the
> landlord. There is no statutory authority to do this. There is no common law
> or equitable basis for doing this. Consequently, cl 5.3 is beyond the power
> of the creditors meeting, unless, of course, the creditors who are affected
> by the clause vote in favour of the execution of the deed. The provision, cl
> 5.3, is unfairly discriminatory against Andersens, which voted against the
> motion to execute the Deed.

Here again, we observe that the learned judges decision was founded on _Hill v
Anderson Meat Industries Ltd_. As we have said, the schemes of arrangement in
_Hill_ did not contain any provision seeking to discharge the rights of the
creditors against the guarantors of the company concerned. Nor did the learned
judge consider the binding effect of the arrangement as between Edshar and it
creditors, and in particular whether Edshar could in principle enforce the
term relating to the discharge of the guarantors.

32 True it is that a scheme of arrangement or compromise made between a
company and its creditors under s 210 of the Companies Act binds only the
company and the creditors. The guarantors of the companys debts and
liabilities are not a party to the scheme, and hence as between the creditors
and the guarantors of the debts and liabilities of the company, the scheme of
arrangement by itself, of course, does not affect directly the rights and
obligations of these parties under the guarantees. Consequently, as and when
the scheme is approved by the requisite majority of the creditors and by the
court under s 210, as between the creditors and the guarantors of the company,
the rights and obligations of the parties under the guarantees remain
unaffected by the scheme. On the other hand, as the scheme is binding on the
company and its creditors, there is no reason in principle why the company
cannot in principle enforce the terms of the scheme as against the creditors.
It must be borne in mind that the scheme contains reciprocal rights and
obligations of the company and the creditors, and once the company has
observed and performed all its obligations under the scheme, the creditors
likewise must observe and perform their obligations thereunder, and if they
fail or refuse to do so, the company is entitled to take proceedings to
enforce their obligations under the scheme.

33 It follows therefore that in this case, if CEL Tractors duly perform their
obligations under the scheme vis--vis the creditors, the latter must likewise
perform their obligations thereunder, and if they refuse or fail to do so,
e.g. if they take legal proceedings to enforce the guarantees, CEL Tractors
are entitled to seek equitable reliefs in the form of an injunction and
specific performance against the creditors concerned, because if the creditors
seek to enforce the guarantees, the guarantors will inevitably seek to have a
recourse against CEL Tractors for an indemnity. Such a position would entirely
negate the provisions of cl 4.3 of the scheme.

34 For completeness, we should consider the decision of the English Court of
Appeal in the case of _Johnson and Anor v Davies and Anor_ [1998] 2 BCLC 252,
which was relied upon by the judge below and by Mr Coomaraswamy, counsel for
CEL Tractors, before us, although in our view it is not strictly relevant. In
that case, the plaintiffs were the sureties of a lease taken in the name of
their company. Later they sold their shares in the company to the two
defendants and a third party, Hopkins, and in the sale agreement the
defendants and Hopkins agreed to indemnify the plaintiffs against all claims
arising under the lease. The company subsequently went into receivership and a
claim was made against the plaintiffs which they met. At about that time,
Hopkins entered into a voluntary arrangement with his creditors under Pt VII
of the Insolvency Act 1986, under which, among other things, subject to
certain payments made by Hopkins in a certain manner, he would be released
from further liability to all his creditors. The plaintiffs were given notice
of the meeting of the creditors convened for the purpose of approving the
arrangement. The arrangement was approved. Under the Act, the plaintiffs were
deemed to be bound by the arrangement. Subsequently, the plaintiffs brought
proceedings against the defendants seeking to recover the sums they had paid
under the lease. They applied for summary judgment, and the deputy district
judge held that the defendants were discharged by the voluntary arrangement
entered into between Hopkins and his creditors, including the plaintiffs, and
accordingly, he dismissed the application. The plaintiffs appealed to the High
Court judge. The judge took the view that the effect of the voluntary
arrangement entered into by Hopkins under the Insolvency Act 1986 was not such
as to release co-debtors, namely, the defendants from their liabilities under
indemnity given to the plaintiffs. He therefore allowed the appeal. The
defendants then appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court dismissed the
appeal but on different grounds.

35 The question in that case was whether the voluntary arrangement made
between Hopkins and his creditors under the Insolvency Act 1986 had the effect
of releasing the defendants from their joint liability with Hopkins. The
provision of the Insolvency Act 1986 applicable to arrangements made by
individual persons is s 260, which so far as relevant provides:

> 260.(1) This section has effect where the meeting summoned under section 257
> approves the proposed voluntary arrangement (with or without modifications).
>

>> (2) The approved arrangement

>>

>> (a) takes effect as if made by the debtor at meeting, and

>>

>> (b) binds every person who in accordance with the rules had notice of, and
was entitled to vote at, the meeting (whether or not he was present or
represented at it) as if he were a party to the arrangement.

>>

>> ..

Chadwick LJ, with whom Wade and Kennedy L JJ concurred, held that the
arrangement being an voluntary arrangement made under the Insolvency Act 1986,
depending on its terms, could have the effect of discharging a co-debtor of
Hopkins jointly liable for the same debt, but that on the terms of the
arrangement it could not be construed to have such effect. Accordingly, the
defendants remained liable to the plaintiffs under the indemnity. The learned
judge rejected the contention that, even if there is any express term in an
arrangement, which would or might otherwise have the effect of discharging co-
debtors and sureties of the debtor from any further liability, that will not
be the effect if the arrangement is made under the provisions in Part VIII of
the Insolvency Act 1986. The learned judge took the view that the provisions
of the Insolvency Act regarding voluntary arrangements introduce a statutory
hypothesis of consent. As such, an arrangement under the Act is not to be
considered `statutory in nature, but were to be treated as consensual deeds
which would accordingly be capable of releasing co-debtors. He said at p
269-270:

> There is an important and, to my mind, crucial distinction between the
> provisions in Pt VIII of the 1986 Act and those in ss 125 and 126 of the
> 1869 Act. Under the 1869 Act the discharge of the debtor took effect by
> virtue of the statute and the rules made under it: see _Megrath v Gray, Gray
> v Megrath_ (1874) LR 9 CP 216 at 231 and _Ex p Jacobs, Re Jacobs_ (1875) LR
> 10 Ch App 211 at 213. Under the various Companies Acts, considered in the
> authorities cited, the discharge takes place by virtue of a scheme which
> becomes operative when it is approved by the court. Under Pt VIII of the
> 1986 Act, the discharge of the debtor depends entirely on the terms of the
> arrangement. One must look at the arrangement, and nothing else, in order to
> find the terms (if any) under which the debtor is discharged. This is
> emphasised by the words in s 260(2) of the 1986 Act: _The approved
> arrangement_ _(b) binds every person_ _as if he were a party to the
> arrangement_. Unlike the earlier legislation, s260(2) of the 1986 Act does
> not purport, directly, to impose the arrangement on a dissenting creditor
> whether or not he has agreed to its terms; rather, he is bound by the
> arrangement as the result of a statutory hypothesis. The statutory
> hypothesis requires him to be treated as if he had consented to the
> arrangement. The consequence, as it seems to me, is that the legislature
> must be taken to have intended that both the question whether the debtor is
> discharged by the arrangement and the question whether the co-debtors and
> sureties are discharged by the arrangement were to be answered by treating
> the arrangement as consensual; that is to say, by construing its terms as if
> they were the terms of a consensual agreement between the debtor and all
> those creditors who, under the statutory hypothesis, must be treated as
> being consenting parties.

We do not think it is necessary for us to deal with this analysis of Chadwick
LJ. Suffice it to say that his analysis was based on the express wording in s
260 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

36 Generally speaking, in approving a scheme under s 210 of the Act, the duty
of the court is to consider whether the statutory provisions have been
complied with, whether the scheme is fair and reasonable to the creditors as a
whole, whether the company and the majority creditors are acting bona fide,
and whether the minority is being coerced to promote the interest of the
majority: see _In re English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank_ [1893]
3 Ch 385, 408; _In re Dorman, Long and Company, Ltd_[1934] 1 Ch 635. In our
opinion, no question of unfairness, discrimination or absence of bona fides
arises in this case. There is no reason why the scheme should not be approved.
The judge below approved it. We would do so likewise.

Conclusion

_

37 For the reasons given above, we accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.
The security deposit together with the interest, if any, will be released to
the respondents or their solicitors to account of costs.
