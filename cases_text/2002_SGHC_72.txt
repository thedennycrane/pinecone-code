Held, awarding judgment in favour of the plaintiff,

> (1) From the time the contract was being negotiated, Global knew that OSM
> was an agent of Rapiscan and was negotiating on behalf of Rapiscan. This was
> evident from the factual matrix as well as from the correspondence between
> Global and Rapiscan after the "mistake" regarding the shipment was
> discovered. The first time that Global sought to deny that Rapiscan was the
> contracting party was in the Defence filed in these proceedings. ( 29 – 31)
>
> (2) The evidence clearly showed that the obligation to monitor the shipment
> and keep Rapiscan informed of its progress was an express term. It was also
> reasonable to imply such a term: see George Peereboom v World Transport
> Agency Ltd [1921] LLR 170. Global’s negligence in monitoring the shipment
> was a breach of both the express and implied term of the parties oral
> contract of carriage. ( 6 – 9)
>
> (3) Every page of the two quotations faxed to OSM by Global on 4 and 5
> December 2000 had carried a qualification that all transactions entered into
> by Global would be subject to the SFFA Conditions. In the circumstance,
> Global had made known to Rapiscan, before Global agreed to undertake the
> shipment, that the shipment was subject to the SFFA Conditions. Hence, the
> contract of carriage entered into was subject to those Conditions. ( 32)
>
> (4) When parties enter into a contract of carriage with the expectation that
> a bill of lading will be issued to cover it, they enter into it upon those
> terms which they know or expect the bill of lading to contain : see Pyrene
> Co Ltd v Scindia Steam Navigation Co Ltd [1954] 1 LLR 321. In the present
> case, Rapiscan who had used the services of Global in the past, were aware
> that there were standard conditions attached to the bill of lading issued by
> Global. Hence, the terms in the bill of lading issued in this case formed
> part of the contract between Global and Rapiscan notwithstanding that the
> bill of lading had not been issued at the time the oral contract was entered
> into. ( 33 – 34)
>
> (5) Whether the exemption clauses contained in both the SFFA Conditions and
> the bill of lading can be construed as exempting liability from negligence
> would depend on whether it succeeds on the three limbs of the "Morton test"
> : see Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King [1952] HL 192. In the present
> case, the exemption clauses which did not make any express reference to
> negligence or any synonym of negligence did not satisfy the first Morton
> test. The second test requires the court to consider whether the words used
> are wide enough, in their ordinary meaning, to cover negligence on the part
> of the person whose favour it is made. The words used in the exemption
> clauses in question were wide enough to cover negligence. However, since the
> exemptions clauses in both the SFFA Conditions and the bill of lading were
> applicable to heads of claim other than claims based on negligence, the
> third Morton test was not satisfied. The exemption clauses would not
> therefore exempt from liability the claim against Global for the breach of
> contract arising from their negligence to monitor the shipment. ( 43 – 59)
>
> (6) The same strict approach adopted by the courts towards exemption clauses
> does not apply to contracts containing limitation of liability clauses.
> Whether Global can rely on the limitation clauses contained in the SFFA
> Conditions and bill of lading depends on whether the clauses are
> sufficiently clear and unambiguous to receive effect in limiting the
> liability of Global for its negligence. Both cl 27 (b) of the SFFA
> Conditions and cl 6(4)(A) of the bill of lading, relied on by Global, limits
> liability for negligence only in respect of claims for delay. As such, the
> limitation of liability clauses could not limit Global’s liability arising
> from its negligence in fulfilling its obligations to properly monitor the
> shipment of the X-ray machines. ( 60 – 65)
>
> (7) Global’s negligence in monitoring the shipment also made Global liable
> in tort. There is no need to consider Global’s remedy in tort since Global
> has been found to be liable in contract which is the more appropriate
> remedy. ( 67 – 68)

> (8) Global’s failure to comply with its contractual obligation to monitor
> the shipment resulted in Rapiscan’s loss of rental income from the Fei Fu
> contract which amounted to US$ 125,000. Rapiscan, by its abortive attempt to
> air-freight the X-ray machines to Macau was attempting to mitigate that
> loss. As the attempt would have been successful but for matters outside the
> control of Rapiscan, Rapiscan was entitled to recover those costs amounting
> to US$ 29,056 from Global. Judgment for the sum of US$ 154,056 with interest
> was awarded in favour of Rapiscan. ( 69 – 72)

**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The plaintiff, Rapiscan Asia Pte Ltd ("Rapiscan"), is a Singapore
incorporated company which markets/rents X-ray machines that screen for the
presence of guns, knives and other such weapons. Such X-ray machines are found
in airports and other public places. They are also used by organisers of
public events. Rapiscan is a wholly-owned subsidiary of an American company,
OSI Systems Inc, said to be one of the largest manufacturers of such
equipment. Opto Sensors (M) Sdn Bhd ("OSM") is also a wholly-owned subsidiary
of OSI Systems. OSM manufactures such X-ray machines and has its offices in
Johor Baru, Malaysia. Rapiscan and OSM, being sister companies, were managed
administratively as one group of companies. The defendant, Global Container
Freight Pte Ltd ("Global") is a freight forwarding company incorporated in
Singapore. _**

  
The Fei Fu contract

**_.

2\. In December 1999, Macau was handed back to China by the Portuguese. In
connection with the hand-over celebrations, Rapiscan rented some of its X-ray
machines to an organisation in Macau called Fei Fu and the X-ray machines were
shipped to Macau through the services of Global. In December 2000, for the
First Anniversary Celebrations of the hand-over, Fei Fu again contacted
Rapiscan for the rental of X-ray machines. A contract was entered into between
Rapiscan and Fei Fu on 4 December 2000 for the rental of 13 such X-ray
machines for use from 10 to 31 December 2000. It was subsequently agreed
between Rapiscan and Fei Fu that it would be sufficient if Rapiscan had the
X-ray machines operationally ready at the designated sites in Macau before 18
December 2000. The First Anniversary Celeberations were to commence on 19
December 2000.

_**

  
The contract with Global

**_.

3\. Rapiscan had, in connection with the APEC Meeting held in Brunei in
mid-2000, rented X-ray machines to the authorities in Brunei. These X-ray
machines, which had also been shipped to Brunei by Global, were still in
Brunei and Rapiscan decided to ship 13 of these X-ray machines to Macau.
Towards this end, Paul Quek Jat Han ("Paul"), the Materials Manager of OSM,
asked Sharimah bte Mohamed ("Sharimah"), an Administrative Assistant with OSM,
to make enquiries from Global about their freight charges. Sharimah contacted
one Jason Thng ("Jason") of Global. From the two quotations sent by Jason –
the first on 4 December 2000 and the second on 5 December 2000 – it would
appear that Sharimah had at first asked for a quote from Muara to Singapore
and thereafter a quote from Muara to Macau.

4\. Paul told the court that upon receipt of the quotations he had spoken on
the phone with Jason and emphasized to Jason that the X-ray machines were for
use in Macau in connection with the First Anniversary Celebrations and the
shipment therefore had to be closely monitored in order to ensure that the
X-ray machines arrived in Macau by 16 December 2000. Paul claimed that he told
Jason that if Global could not confirm that the X-ray machines would reach
Macau by then, Rapiscan would consider other methods of transport to meet the
deadline. According to Paul, Jason assured him that he would monitor the
shipment. He said that Jason also assured him that the X-ray machines would
reach Macau by 16 December 2000 or the early hours of 17 December 2000 at the
latest. Paul relayed this assurance to his senior management and, after
obtaining their approval, reverted to Jason and gave the go-ahead to effect
the shipment. Paul also informed Jason that Tamil Selvan ("Selvan") and
Swaminathan ("Nathan") of Rapiscan in Singapore would liaise on the shipment
details.

5\. Jason’s account of that conversation was somewhat different. Jason agreed
that he was told by Paul that the shipment was urgent and required in
connection with the First Anniversary Celeberations in Macau but maintained
that Jason had not given 16 December 2000 as the deadline by which the X-ray
machines had to be in Macau. Jason’s evidence was that Paul told him that the
X-ray machines had to be in Macau before 20 December 2000.

6\. Mr S Palaniappan, counsel for Rapiscan, in his closing submission
submitted that this oral contract entered into between Rapiscan and Global
contained the following terms:

(a) that Global would ensure that the X-ray machines reached Macau by 16
December 2000;

(b) that the X-ray machines were to be carried on the "Kota Perkasa"; and

(c) that Global would promptly advice and accurately inform Rapiscan about the
whereabouts of the shipment ("the need to monitor").

On the evidence, it is clear that Paul gave the go-ahead to Global to effect
the shipment on 5 December 2000. It is also clear that on that date the
details of the vessel to be used for the Singapore/Macau leg of the shipment
had not been identified. This is apparent from an e-mail to Global’s Brunei
agent on 5 December 2000 in which Jason informed the agent that the customer
wished to know the name of the mother vessel from Singapore to Macau and asked
for the name. The Brunei agent responded by e-mail on 6 December 2000. In
response, the Brunei agent named two possible vessels, namely:

"Kota Perkasa":  | ETD Singapore 12.12.00.  
---|---  
| ETA Macau 17.12.00.  
"Kota Jaya": | ETD Singapore 14.12.00.  
| ETA Macau 19.12.00.  

The use of the "Kota Perkasa" for the shipment of the X-ray machines was
therefore not envisaged on 5 December 2000 when the contract was entered into.

7\. In the above circumstances, it could not have been envisaged on 5 December
2000, when the contract was entered into, that the "Kota Perkasa" would be the
vessel to be used. Assuming that the vessel "Kota Perkasa" had been identified
at the time of the contract, it was hardly likely that Jason would commit
himself to the X-ray machines reaching Macau by 16 December 2000 when the ETA
Macau of the "Kota Perkasa" was 17 December 2000. I therefore reject Paul’s
evidence that Jason told him that the X-ray machines would reach Macau by 16
December 2000. I also find that it was not envisaged at the time the contract
was entered into that the "Kota Perkasa" was to be used for the
Singapore/Macau sector of the journey.

8\. It now remains for me to consider whether the need to monitor the shipment
was a term of the oral contract entered into. I accept the evidence of Paul
that he had impressed on Jason that this shipment was urgent and needed to be
closely monitored so that if there was any difficulty in meeting the deadline
Rapiscan could make alternative arrangements. I find that the need to monitor
and keep Rapiscan informed of the progress of the shipment was a term accepted
by Jason at the time the contract was entered into.

9\. This obligation to monitor was also pleaded as an implied term in the
contract. In support of the submission that such a term could be implied, my
attention was drawn to the case of _George Peereboom v World Transport Agency
Ltd_ [1921] LLR 170 where at 172 Roche J said:

"I think it was hardly disputed that a person in the position of a forwarding
agent is bound to give such information to his principal as is necessary for
the principal to protect his interest in the goods. That is a duty which is
entirely independent of whether the forwarding agent has actual possession of
the goods or not. He is managing a certain transaction with regard to them,
and if anything arises during the conduct of that transaction which affects
the goods or their value or the interest of the plaintiff in them, it is
impliedly the duty of the forwarding agent to tell his principal about it."

It is, in my view, reasonable to imply such a term.

_**

  
Monitoring the shipment

**_.

10\. On 6 December 2000, Nathan faxed a draft of the bill of lading to
Global’s agent in Brunei for the Muara/Singapore sector of the journey. On 9
December 2000, Paul called Jason to ascertain if the X-ray machines had
reached Singapore. Jason told him that the X-ray machines would reach
Singapore on 10 December 2000 and that they would be trans-shipped without
delay to Macau.

11\. On 11 December 2000, Paul called Jason to enquire about the progress of
the shipment. Jason assured him that the shipment was on schedule and will be
trans-shipped from Singapore on 12 December 2000. On 12 December 2000, Nathan
spoke with Jason. Nathan told the court that Jason told him that the X-ray
machines had arrived in Singapore and would be trans-shipped on board the
vessel "Kota Perkasa" due to leave Singapore on that day.

12\. On 14 December 2000, Global faxed the draft bill of lading for the
Singapore/Macau leg of the shipment to Nathan. The bill of lading was dated 12
December 2000 and named the "Kota Perkasa" as the vessel, Rapiscan as the
shipper and Fei Fu as the notification party. On the same day, Global in a
shipping confirmation note faxed to OSM gave the ETA of vessel at Singapore as
"on/about 12 Dec 00" and the ETA Destination as "17.12.00".

13\. On 14 December 2000, Paul, as well as Selvan, called Jason to enquire
about the progress of the shipment. It was the evidence of Selvan that he
emphasized to Jason that many dignitaries, including the President of mainland
China, would be attending the First Anniversary Celebrations and that it was
absolutely crucial that the X-ray machines arrive in Macau latest by 17
December 2000. Selvan said that Jason assured him that the X-ray machines
would arrive in Macau by 16 December 2000 or at the latest by the morning of
17 December 2000.

14\. On 15 December 2000, Selvan received a fax from Jose Sin ("Sin") of Fei
Fu expressing concern that the "Kota Perkasa" would reach Hong Kong only on 17
December 2000 and not on 16 December 2000. Selvan referred this fax to Nathan
who then called Jason. Unable to get Jason on the phone, Nathan called Pacific
International Line ("PIL") which owned the "Kota Perkasa" to enquire about the
X-ray machines and was told that he would have to get details through Global.
Thereafter, Nathan managed to contact Jason. Jason told Nathan that PIL would
release information about the shipment only to the party that had booked the
space on board the ship and again assured Nathan that the X-ray machines would
reach Macau by 16 December 2000 or at the latest 17 December 2000. Nathan
testified that he again told Jason that should there be any delay Jason should
inform Rapiscan.

15\. Soon thereafter Jason called Nathan and told him that the "Kota Perkasa"
was delayed because of heavy storms but assured Nathan that the X-ray machines
would reach Macau on 17 December 2000. Independently, Selvan had called Jason
on the same day and was given the same assurance. Selvan, who was the
executive in Rapiscan who had negotiated the rental agreement with Fei Fu,
told the court that he accepted the assurance of Jason that the X-ray machines
would reach Macau by 17 December 2000 and telephoned Sin to convey this
assurance. Sin told Selvan that he (Sin) could ensure that the X-ray machines
would reach Macau a few hours after the vessel arrived in Hong Kong.

_**

  
The "mistake"

**_.

16\. On 16 December 2000, Sin, much to his dismay, learnt from sources in Hong
Kong that the X-ray machines were not on the "Kota Perkasa" but on a different
vessel – the "Kota Jaya" – which was not scheduled to arrive in Macau until 19
December 2000. This meant that the X-ray machines (and hence the security
arrangements) could not be in place when the First Anniversary Celebrations
commenced on 19 December 2000. He relayed the information and his concerns to
Selvan. Selvan called Global’s agent in Hong Kong and they confirmed that the
"Kota Perkasa" would arrive in Hong Kong that night and that the X-ray
machines in question were not on board the vessel. Selvan told the court that
he was devastated when he heard this. Shortly thereafter, Jason called Selvan
and confirmed the "mistake".

_**

  
Mitigation of loss

**_.

17\. When Selvan learnt of this "mistake", it was already about noon on 16
December 2000: a Saturday. He discussed the matter with Nathan and Gurdip
Singh, the Deputy Managing Director of Rapiscan and OSM and they decided that,
with Fei Fu’s consent, they would immediately air-lift similar X-ray machines
that Rapiscan held in Global’s warehouse in Singapore, to Macau. Sin agreed
provided the X-ray machines arrived in Macau on 18 December 2000 and were
available for use at the required site when the First Anniversary Celebrations
commenced on 19 December 2000.

18\. The staff of Rapiscan worked frantically to arrange for the immediate
air-lift of the X-ray machines from Singapore to Macau but were unable to get
the necessary air-cargo space. Air-cargo space to Hong Kong was, however,
available from Sepang International Airport, Kuala Lumpur. There were five
similar X-ray machines stored in Johor Baru. It was decided that these five
X-ray machines from Johor Baru and eight X-ray machines from Singapore be air-
freighted from Sepang to Hong Kong. They managed to secure air-cargo space in
Sepang and the eight X-ray machines from Johor Baru left Kuala Lumpur for Hong
Kong on 18 December 2000. But, because of the weekend, Rapiscan encountered
problems in getting the eight X-ray machines from Singapore to Sepang. Various
documents had to be processed before the X-ray machines could be trucked out
of Keppel Distri Park where the machines were stored. And when the X-ray
machines reached the Johor Immigration point, further delays relating to
customs clearance were encountered. In the event the trucks were able to cross
into Johor Baru only on 18 December 2000. When the trucks were halfway to
Sepang, Rapiscan received notification from Fei Fu that they were canceling
the contract for the X-ray machines.

_**

  
The post-mortem

**_.

19\. On 4 January 2001, Rapiscan wrote to Global complaining that Global had
"bungled" the shipment of the X-ray machines and stating that Rapiscan took a
serious view of the breach of the agreement between Global and Rapiscan. In
that letter Rapiscan, inter alia, stated: "Had you at least conveyed the
correct information to us on the 14th of December that the goods were lying in
Singapore, we would have been able to avert our losses by air-lifting the
machines immediately."

20\. In their response dated 9 January 2001, Global gave the following
explanation of what happened:

"When said shipment was finally loaded onboard vessel from Muara, our Agent –
Tri Star highlighted to ‘PIL Muara’ that this shipment is a ‘Government
Project’ & needed to be connected to first available vessel to Macau, which
was schedule to eta Macau 16/12/00 or 17/12/00. PIL/Muara also informed our
Agent that the said shipment would be connected on vessel: ‘Kota Perkasa’
which was schedule to sail from Singapore on the 14/12/00.

On 16/12/00, our agent in Hong Kong advised us that shipment was not on board
vessel ‘Kota Perkasa’. On learning the said news. We immediately contacted PIL
Singapore to confirm the information whether the said shipment was indeed
shipped onboard ‘Kota Jaya’ and they claimed that PIL Muara never informed
them that the said shipment is urgently needed by consignee & therefore rolled
over the said shipment to next sailing."

It was clear from this response that Global was shifting the blame for the
"mistake" on PIL. It was also relevant that Global did not, in this letter or
at any stage prior to the commencement of this suit, challenge Rapiscan’s
assertion that the agreement was between itself and Global.

_**

  
Jason’s version of the "mistake"

**_.

21\. Jason’s evidence as to the events that transpired during the second leg
of the shipment was somewhat different from the version given by the witnesses
for Rapiscan. Jason claimed that he knew on 15 December 2000 that the X-ray
machines had not been loaded on the "Kota Perkasa" and claimed that he had
given this information to Paul on 15 December 2000.

22\. Whether the information regarding the "mistake" was conveyed to Rapiscan
on 15 or on 16 December 2000 could be a matter of considerable significance to
Global’s defence to Rapiscan’s claims. If indeed Rapiscan had been notified of
the mistake on 15 December 2000 as claimed by Jason, then the fact that
Rapiscan took no action until 16 December 2000 (a Saturday) to try and air-
freight substitute X-ray machines to Macau would be a factor adverse to
Rapiscan in considering whether Rapiscan had taken adequate steps to mitigate
its loss. I therefore had to determine which of these two versions to accept.

23\. Jason’s version was inconsistent even with Global’s position as stated in
Global’s letter of 9 January 2001 referred to above where Global stated that
they discovered that the X-ray machines were not on the "Kota Perkasa" but
were on the "Kota Jaya" on 16 December 2000. I accept that letter as
reflecting the truth of the matter. I find that Global, in common with Sin and
Rapiscan’s executives, came to know about the "mistake" on 16 December 2000.

24\. Jason in his evidence also denied having misled Rapiscan into believing
that the X-ray machines were on board the "Kota Perkasa". Jason’s evidence was
that, in their telephone enquiries, all that the staff of Rapiscan had asked
was the ETA of the "Kota Perkasa" in Macau. He said that he had, in response,
given accurate information about the ETA of the "Kota Perkasa". Jason
maintained that he had not been asked and therefore had not told Rapiscan
anything about the whereabouts of the X-ray machines.

25\. The fact that Jason was aware that this was an urgent shipment is clearly
seen from an internal e-mail of 19 December 2000 sent by Jason to Global’s
agent in Brunei where Jason, in instructing the agent to stop the shipment
(that was then on the "Kota Jaya") at Hong Kong, stated:

"Please question her why they did not inform ‘PIL-SIN’ that this shipment is
of ‘TOP URGENT’ and was government project require for their handover
anniversary on 20 Dec and MUST BE LOADED ONBOARD vessel ‘Kota Perkasa
V.PKS062’ as according to your booking ???"

Global had also informed Rapiscan that the X-ray machines had on 12 December
2000 been loaded on the "Kota Perkasa". This is evident from the draft bill of
lading faxed by Jason to Rapiscan on 14 December 2000 wherein the name of the
vessel carrying the X-ray machines was given as "Kota Perkasa".

26\. In the circumstances, it must have been obvious to Jason – even if the
staff of Rapiscan had only enquired about the ETA of "Kota Perkasa" in Macau –
that Rapiscan’s only concern was to ensure that the X-ray machines reached
Macau on time. In those circumstances, for Jason to inform Rapiscan that the
ETA Macau of "Kota Perkasa" was 17 December 2000 was tantamount to telling
them that the X-ray machines would arrive in Macau on 17 December 2000. I am
satisfied however that, in making those enquiries, the employees of Rapiscan
had specifically asked Jason about the arrival time of the X-ray machines in
Macau. Jason’s failure to properly ascertain the whereabouts of the X-ray
machines before answering those queries resulted in Rapiscan being misled into
believing that the X-ray machines would arrive in Macau in time for use in the
First Anniversary Celebrations. This negligent misrepresentation about the
whereabouts of the X-ray machines was a breach of the term of the contract
(both express and implied) that Global would monitor the shipment and keep
Rapiscan informed about its progress.

_**

  
The defence

**_.

27\. Global, in its defence, denied that there was any contract between Global
and Rapiscan: it was Global’s case that the contract that was entered into was
between itself and OSM and that being so Global was liable to OSM – not
Rapiscan.

28\. In the alternative, Global relied on certain exemption/limitation clauses
in the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association Standard Trading Conditions
("SFFA Conditions") and in the bill of lading to deny/limit liability.
Rapiscan disputed the applicability of the SFFA Conditions and the bill of
lading terms to the contract in this case and argued that in the event those
clauses were held to be part of the contract, they were ineffective in
exempting/limiting the liability of Global.

_**

  
Was there a contract between Rapiscan and Global

**_?

29\. In support of its defence that there was no contract between itself and
Rapiscan, Global relied on the fact that up to the time the contract of
carriage was concluded the only persons who communicated with Global were
Sharimah and Paul – both employees of OSM. Counsel for Global, Mr Loo Dip
Seng, submitted that there was no evidence before the court that in entering
into the contract, OSM was acting as an agent of Rapiscan.

30\. Paul had testified that, in negotiating the contract with Global, he had
told Jason that Rapiscan wanted the goods shipped to Macau. Paul had also
testified that he told Jason that Rapiscan would monitor the progress of the
shipment. In the light of Paul’s evidence, the submission by Mr Loo that there
was no evidence before the court was not quite correct. It is in this context
relevant that Global did not refute Rapiscan’s allegation – in its letter to
Global after the "mistake" was discovered – that Global had an agreement with
Rapiscan. Not only did Global not refute that claim, Global went on to give
detailed explanations to Rapiscan about how it came about the X-ray machines
were not on the "Kota Perkasa" as scheduled. This correspondence is consistent
with Rapiscan being the contracting party in respect of that shipment. The
first time that Global sought to deny that Rapiscan was the contracting party
was in the Defence filed in these proceedings.

31\. I accept the submission of Mr Palaniappan, counsel for Rapiscan, that
Global’s claim that their contract was with OSM and not with Rapiscan was a
mere afterthought. I find, on the evidence, that from the time the contract
was being negotiated, Global knew that OSM was an agent of Rapiscan and was
negotiating on behalf of Rapiscan. I therefore find no merit in this defence.

_**

  
The SFFA Conditions: Did they apply?

**_

32\. Every page of the two quotations faxed to OSM by Global on 4 and 5
December 2000, had printed on it the following qualification:

"All business and transactions entered into by or on behalf of the Company is
subject to the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association Standard Trading
Condition ["the SFFA Conditions"], copy available upon request."

It was submitted, on behalf of Global, and I accept that submission, that in
view of the fact that it was made known to Rapiscan, before Global agreed to
undertake the shipment, that the shipment was subject to SFFA Conditions, the
contract of carriage that was entered into was subject to those Conditions.

_**

  
The bill of lading terms: Did they apply?

**_

33\. Rapiscan did not dispute that Global would, in the ordinary course of
business, issue a bill of lading for the shipment of the X-ray machines. It
was also not in dispute that a bill of lading was not issued at the time the
contract with Rapiscan was entered into but that it was issued after the Fei
Fu contract had been aborted. The issue that arises for consideration is
whether the terms attached to a bill of lading that had not been issued at the
time the contract of carriage was entered into, can be incorporated in the
contract of carriage.

34\. That question was considered in _Pyrene Co Ltd v Scindia Steam Navigation
Co Ltd_ [1954] 1 LLR 321 where at 329 the court held:

"When parties enter into a contract of carriage in the expectation that a bill
of lading will be issued to cover it, they enter into it upon those terms
which they know or expect the bill of lading to contain."

In this case, Rapiscan (and its agent OSM through whom this contract was
entered into) had also used the services of Global in the past and would be
aware that there were standard conditions attached to bills of lading issued
by Global. I find that the terms in the bill of lading issued in this case
formed part of the contract between Global and Rapiscan. The relevant
exemption/limitation clause in the bill of lading is cl 6(4)(A).

35\. I will deal first with the arguments relating to the exemption clauses
before dealing with the arguments dealing with the limitation clauses.

_**

  
The SFFA Conditions

**_.

36\. The provisions of the SFFA Conditions relied on by Global were the
following:

_

Clause 14

_ : (the delay clause)

Unless otherwise _previously agreed in writing_ that the Goods shall depart or
arrive by a particular date, the Company accepts no responsibility _for
departure or arrival dates of Goods_.

_

Clause 26

_ : (the exemption clause)

(a) …

(b) Subject to Clause 14, the Company shall not _in any circumstances_ be
liable for loss or damage however caused to property other than the Goods
themselves, indirect or _consequential loss or damage, loss of profits_ , loss
of market _or the consequences of any delay_ or deviation.

_

Clause 27

_ : (the limitation clause)

Except insofar as otherwise provided by these Conditions, the liability of the
Company _howsoever arising and notwithstanding that such liability shall have
arisen from the neglect or default of the Company_ , shall not exceed

(a) …

(b) in respect of claims for delay where not excluded by the provisions of
these Conditions, the amount of the Company’s charges for the services in
respect of the Goods delayed.

(Emphasis added.)

_**

  
Delay in shipment

**_.  
_**Clause 14**_.

37\. Clause 14 provides that the company accepts no responsibility for
departure or arrival dates of goods unless it has been agreed in writing that
the goods shall depart or arrive by a particular date. There was, in this
case, no such written agreement. I have also rejected Rapiscan’s claim that
there was an oral agreement to that effect. In the circumstances, Global can
be under no liability to Rapiscan merely from the fact that the goods arrived
(or would have arrived) at the destination at a date later than expected. I
would add that had there been a written agreement that the X-ray machines had
to arrive in Macau by a specified date and there was a breach of that
agreement, Global would be liable to Rapiscan in damages but the measure of
those damages would, by reason of cl 27(b) of the SFFA Conditions relied on by
Global, be limited as provided therein.

_**

  
Negligence in monitoring

**_.

38\. Global’s negligence in monitoring the shipment resulted in Rapiscan being
misled into believing that the X-ray machines were on board the "Kota Perkasa"
which would be arriving in Macau on 17 December 2000. This was a breach by
Global of its express and implied obligation to properly monitor the shipment.
Had Global kept Rapiscan properly informed of the whereabouts of the X-ray
machines – in particular if Global had informed Rapiscan whilst the X-ray
machines were in Singapore that they had not been able to load the X-ray
machines on board the "Kota Perkasa", or failing that even if Global had
timeously informed Rapiscan that the X-ray machines had been loaded on board
the "Kota Jaya" – Rapiscan would have been able or better able to save its
contract with Fei Fu by air-freighting substitute X-ray machines to Macau. I
say "better able" because one can never be certain whether, at such short
notice, air cargo space could have been obtained for the X-ray machines to
arrive in Macau in time for the First Anniversary Celebrations. I am prepared,
however, to find that if Global had, even as late as 15 December 2000,
informed Rapiscan that the X-ray machines were not on board the "Kota Perkasa"
but on the "Kota Jaya", alternative arrangements to air-freight substitute
X-ray machines in time for use in the First Anniversary Celeberations could
have been successfully effected.

39\. Prima facie, therefore, unless this claim of negligent misrepresentation
fell within an exemption/limitation clause, Rapiscan would be entitled to
damages in full for the said breach. I will deal first with the exemption
clauses in the SFFA Conditions and in the bill of lading before considering
the limitation clauses.

_**

  
The exemption clause in the SFFA Conditions

**_.  
_**Clause 26(b)**_.

40\. Mr Loo submitted that even if Global had in breach of its contractual
obligation negligently misrepresented to Rapiscan that the X-ray machines were
on board the "Kota Perkasa", such breach fell within the exemption contained
in cl 26(b) of the SFFA Conditions and Global would not be liable in damages.
Clause 26(b), he submitted, should be read as follows:

"Subject to clause 14, the Company shall not _in any circumstances_ , be
liable for:

(a) loss or damage however caused to property other than the goods themselves;

(b) indirect or consequential loss;

(c) loss of profits;

(d) the consequences of any delay or deviation."

The words "_in any circumstances_ ", he submitted, were wide enough to exempt
Global from any liability for loss of profits or any direct or consequential
loss suffered by Global as a result of that negligent misrepresentation.

41\. Where a party to a contract seeks to exempt himself from liability for
the breach of his contract (or for that matter from liability in tort), it is
incumbent on that party to set out that exemption in clear language. If
language that is ambiguous is used, the contract will be construed against the
proferens, ie the party seeking to incorporate that exemption clause
(Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th Ed), paragraph 370). This is known as the
"contra proferentem rule".

42\. Relying on the contra proferentem rule, Mr Palaniappan submitted that cl
26(b) should be read with due regard to the phrase "subject to clause 14"
appearing therein. He submitted that, thus read, the exemption of liability in
cl 26(b) would extend only to liability arising out of any delay in the
shipment. That liability for delay (if there was agreement in writing that the
goods would arrive by a particular date), would then be subject to the
limitation imposed by cl 27(b). Clause 26(b), he submitted, would not exempt
Global from liability – such as that which arose from Global’s failure to
adhere to its contractual obligation to keep Rapiscan properly posted on the
whereabouts of the X-ray machines – that did not arise from delay.

43\. I was unable to accept the construction placed on cl 26(b) by Mr
Palaniappan. The reference to cl 14 did not, in my view, derogate from the
force of the words in cl 26(b) that the company shall not "in any
circumstances" be liable for loss of profits, etc. Prima facie those words are
wide enough to include claims in negligence. That, however, does not conclude
the matter. The courts have, over the years, adopted a cautious approach in
determining whether an exemption clause can be construed as exempting
liability from negligence. Clause 26(b) will have to be construed bearing
those decisions in mind.

_**

  
The construction of exemption clauses: the Morton tests

**_.

44\. In _Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King_ [1952] HL 192, the Privy
Council, after an extensive review of the authorities, set down guidelines for
determining whether an exemption clause encompasses liability for negligence.
In that case Lord Morton stated at page 208:

"Their Lordships think that the duty of a court in approaching the
consideration of such clauses may be summarized as follows:

(1) If the clause contains language which expressly exempts the person in
whose favour it is made (hereafter called ‘the proferens’) from the
consequence of the negligence of his own servants, effect must be given to
that provision …

(2) If there is no express reference to negligence, the court must consider
whether the words used are wide enough, in their ordinary meaning, to cover
negligence on the part of the servants of the proferens. If a doubt arises at
this point, it must be resolved against the proferens …

(3) If the words used are wide enough for the above purpose, the court must
then consider whether ‘the head of damage may be based on some ground other
than that of negligence,’ to quote again Lord Greene in the _Alderslade_ case
([1945] KB 189, 192). The ‘other ground’ must not be so fanciful or remote
that the proferens cannot be supposed to have desired protection against it;
but subject to this qualification, which is no doubt to be implied from Lord
Green’s words, the existence of a possible head of damage other than that of
negligence is fatal to the proferens even if the words used are prima facie
wide enough to cover negligence on the part of his servants."

The rationale for this cautious approach is that it is highly unlikely that
the parties to a contract would have intended to exonerate from liability the
party who performs his obligation under that contract negligently.

45\. In _Marina Centre Holdings Pte Ltd v Pars Carpet Gallery Pte Ltd_ [1997]
3 SLR 625, our Court of Appeal followed the guidelines enunciated in _Canada
Steamship Lines_ ("the Morton tests"). L P Thean JA, who delivered the
decision of the Court of Appeal, summarised in the following passage the
reasons for that approach:

"The underlying reason for this approach is that the court starts with a
presumption that parties to a contract do not normally agree to accept the
consequences of each other’s negligence, ie by way of an exemption clause,
much less to shoulder responsibility for them, ie by way of an indemnity
clause, and will not be taken to have intended to do anything so improbable,
unless the contract does not admit of any other reasonable construction."

The Court of Appeal having adopted the Morton tests, I can only construe cl
26(b) in accordance with those tests.

46\. In _Marina Centre Holdings Pte Ltd_ , an air-conditioning water pipe
within the false ceiling of a neighbouring unit had given way resulting in
extensive damage to carpets stored by the respondents in a unit that they had
rented from the appellant landlord. In resisting a claim in negligence, the
appellant sought to rely on an exemption clause that purported to exempt the
landlord from liability __ "_for any damage to property or any consequential
loss resulting from_ … leaks from any part of the SHOPPING CENTRE _… unless
caused by the wilful misconduct of the Landlord_ or its officers, servants,
employees or agents". In considering whether that exemption clause satisfied
the first Morton test, Thean JA, after reviewing the authorities, held:

"The clause does not _expressly_ exempt the appellants from liability in
negligence: _it contains neither the word ‘negligence’ nor any synonym for
it_. In the absence of such an express reference to negligence or word
synonymous with it, the clause clearly fails the first test."

(Emphasis added.)

Amongst the authorities reviewed by Thean JA was _Smith & Anor v South Wales
Switchgear Ltd_ [1978] 1 WLR 165 and _E Scott (Plant Hire) Ltd v British
Waterways Board_ (1982, unreported).

47\. In the _Smith_ case, the clause that the court was called upon to
construe read as follows:

"In the event of the order involving the carrying out of work by the supplier
[appellants] and its sub-contractors on land and/or premises of the purchaser
[respondents], _the supplier will keep the purchaser indemnified against:_ (a)
All losses and costs incurred by reason of the supplier’s breach of any
statute, bye-law or regulation; (b)  _Any liability, loss, claim or
proceedings whatsoever under statute or common law_ (i) in respect of personal
injury to, or death of, any person whomsoever, (ii) in respect of any injury
or damage whatsoever to any property, real or personal, arising out of or in
the course of or caused by the execution of this order."

(Emphasis added.)

Lord Fraser in dealing with the argument raised that the words "any liability,
loss, claim or proceedings whatsoever under statute or common law" amounted to
an express reference to negligence and therefore satisfied the first Morton
test, said:

"I do not see how a clause can ‘expressly’ exempt or indemnify the proferens
against his negligence unless it contains the word ‘negligence’ or some other
synonym for it and I think that is what Lord Morton must have intended as
appears from the opening words of his second test (‘If there is no express
reference to negligence …’)."

48\. In _E Scott (Plant Hire) Ltd_ , Oliver LJ, in applying the Morton tests,
stated:

"In my judgment _it is no longer possible_ , in the light of _Smith v South
Wales Switchgear_ [1978] 1 All ER 18, [1978] 1 WLR 165, _to treat the
undoubtedly wide words ‘any damage whatsoever’ or ‘however arising’ as a
periphrasis of ‘damage arising from negligence of the proferens’_ and as
either satisfying or by-passing the tests propounded by Lord Morton in
relation to exclusion and indemnity clauses, for it has now been made clear by
authority which binds this court that unless the clause concerned uses the
word ‘negligence’ or some equivalent in unmistakable and unequivocal terms,
its effect falls to be tested … by tests 2 and 3."

(Emphasis added.)

In the present case, there was no specific or express reference to negligence
or any synonym for negligence in cl 26(b). In the light of the authorities
cited above such a clause will not satisfy the first Morton test. I therefore
go on to consider the second test.

49\. The second test requires the court to consider whether the words used are
wide enough, in their ordinary meaning, to cover negligence on the part of the
servants of the proferens; if a doubt arises at this point, it must be
resolved against the proferens. As indicated earlier, the words in cl 26(b)
are wide enough to cover negligence. I therefore go on to consider the third
test.

50\. The third test and last of the Morton tests requires the court to
consider whether there are possible heads of damage other than that of
negligence. The existence of a possible head of damage other than that of
negligence is, to quote Lord Morton, "fatal to the proferens even if the words
used are prima facie wide enough to cover negligence on the part of his
servants".

51\. Addressing the third test, Mr Palaniappan pointed out (by reference to cl
40 of the SFFA Conditions) that in this case Global was not only freight
forwarders but had also assumed the role of bailee and carrier. In view of the
various roles that Global had assumed, Mr Palaniappan submitted that the heads
of damages covered by cl 26(b) would be multi-faceted in that liability
independent of negligence can arise out of Global being the bailee, it can
arise out of Global being the carrier and it can also arise under _The Hague-
Visby Rules_.

52\. In the context of those submissions, Mr Palaniappan referred to the case
of _Rutter v Palmer_ [1922] 2 KB 87. There Atkin LJ stated at page 94:

"I accept the proposition that if a party to a contract would exempt himself
from liability he must express himself in plain words. There is a class of
contract in which words purporting in general terms to exempt a party from
‘any loss’ or to provide that ‘any loss’ shall be borne by the other party,
have been held insufficient to exempt from liability for negligence. Those are
contracts of carriage by sea or land. _The liability of the carrier is not
confined to his acts of negligence or those of his servants; it extends beyond
liability for negligence; therefore when a clause in the contract exempts the
carrier from any loss it may have a reasonable meaning even though the
exemption falls short of conferring immunity for acts of negligence_. That is
the reason at the root of the shipping cases."

(Emphasis added.)

A similar approach was taken in the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada in the
case of _Belships (Far East) Shipping (Pte) Ltd et al v Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd et al_ (1999) 175 DLR (4th) 449. The exemption clause in
that case (cl 8) read as follows:

"Goods stowed on deck shall be at all times and in every respect at the risk
of the Shipper/Consignee. The Carrier shall _in no circumstances whatsoever be
under any liability for loss of or damage to deck cargo, howsoever the same be
caused_ except that, in the event of jettison of deck cargo, there shall in
that respect be a right of contribution in general average in favour of any
party interested in the adventure."

(Emphasis added.)

In ruling that cl 8 failed the third Morton test, Stone JA said at page 460:

"It would seem to me, as well, that _a carrier by sea at common law is exposed
to another potential head of liability beyond that of negligence. I refer to
the carrier’s implied undertaking of seaworthiness_. That obligation has been
held to attach at the time of loading and departure on the voyage and at all
stages thereof to destination. Liability for its breach is imposed regardless
of the carrier’s negligence.

…

What is significant is that this implied warranty exposed the appellants to
another potential head of liability that is quite apart from negligence. This,
too, constituted a head of liability to which Clause 8 would apply."

(Emphasis added.)

53\. I accepted the submission of Mr Palaniappan that cl 26(b) was applicable
to heads of claim other than claims based on negligence. That being so, the
third Morton test was not satisfied. Clause 26(b) would not therefore exempt
from liability the claim against Global for the breach of contract arising
from the negligent misrepresentation of Global as to the whereabouts of the
X-ray machines.

54\. Mr Loo, in his submissions, referred me to another clause in the SFFA
Conditions which he submitted was relevant in determining whether cl 26(b)
excluded liability arising from negligence. This was cl 35(a) which reads:

"The defences and limits of liability provided for by these Conditions shall
apply in any action against the Company whether such action be founded in
contract or tort or in whatsoever form."

Mr Loo submitted that as liability in negligence was a component in the law of
tort, negligence (whether as a breach of contract or whether as a tort) would
be expressly covered by cl 35(a) and, accordingly, cl 26(b) should be read so
as to give effect to cl 35(a).

55\. In determining whether cl 35(a) had the effect of including negligence
within the purview of the exemption of liability in cl 26(b), one again
applies the three Morton tests. In the _Smith_ case (paragraph 47 above),
although the indemnity clause covered "_any liability, loss, claim or
proceedings whatsoever under statute or common law_ ", the House of Lords
nevertheless held that the first test was not satisfied. What Lord Fraser said
in that case bears repeating:

"I do not see how a clause can ‘expressly’ exempt or indemnify the proferens
against his neligence unless it contains the word ‘negligence’ or some other
synonym for it … "

If words such as "_any proceedings whatsoever under common law_ " are
insufficient for the purposes of the first test, I cannot see how the words in
cl 35(a) which in effect seek to exempt liability for "_any action against the
company whether such action is founded in contract or tort_ " can be said to
satisfy the first test. In the light of the authorities, nothing short of the
express use of the word "negligence" or some synonym of that word would
satisfy the first test.

56\. The considerations relating to the application of the second and third
Morton tests in respect of cl 35(a) of the SFFA Conditions would be identical
to the considerations in respect of cl 26(b) of the SFFA Conditions.

_**

  
The exemption clause in the bill of lading

**_.

57\. The clause in the bill of lading relied on by Global in its attempt to
exempt liability was cl 6(4)(A). Clause 6(4)(A) provided as follows:

"Save as otherwise provided herein, the Carrier shall _in no circumstances be
liable for direct, indirect or consequential loss or damages caused by_ delay
or _any other cause whatsoever and howsoever caused_. Without prejudice to the
foregoing, if the Carrier is found liable for delay, liability shall be
limited to the freight applicable to the relevant stage of the transport."

(Emphasis added.)

The word "Carrier" was defined in the bill of lading to mean: "the Company
stated on the front of the Bill of Lading as being the Carrier and on whose
behalf their Bill of Lading has been signed". The bill of lading issued in
this case stated that Global was the carrier. The bill of lading also had the
following clause [cl 5(4)]:

"The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Bill of Lading
shall apply to any action against the Carrier whether the action be founded in
Contract or in Tort."

a clause similar in effect to cl 35(a) of the SFFA Conditions.

58\. In my view, the exemption contained in cl 6(4)(A) of the bill of lading,
even when read with cl 5(4), takes the position no further than cl 26(b) of
the SFFA Conditions insofar as the first Morton test is concerned. Although
worded widely, cl 6(4)(A) makes no express reference to negligence or any
synonym of that word. I am of the view – for the same reasons as in respect of
cl 26(b) of the SFFA Conditions – that cl 6(4)(A) will also not satisfy the
third Morton test. In this respect, I would note that the exemption clause
relied on in the case of _Belships (Far East) Shipping (Pte) Ltd_ (paragraph
52 above) was couched in language about as wide as the language used in cl
6(4)(A).

59\. For the above reasons, I hold that Global cannot rely on cl 6(4)(A) of
the bill of lading to avoid its liability to Rapiscan for the negligent
misrepresentations made by Jason.

_**

  
Limitation of liability

**_.  
_**(a) Under the SFFA Conditions**_.

60\. Mr Loo submitted that even if Global was guilty of negligent
misrepresentation and even if Global was not exempted from liability for such
negligent misrepresentation under cl 26(b) of the SFFA Conditions, Global
would be entitled to rely on the limitation of liability clause in the SFFA
Conditions. The limitation of liability provision in the SFFA Conditions that
Global invoked in its pleadings was cl 27(b).

61\. The question whether the same strict approach adopted by the courts
towards exemption clauses should be applied to contracts containing limitation
of liability clauses was considered by the House of Lords in _Ailsa Craig
Fishing Co Ltd v Malvern Fishing Co Ltd and Anor_ (the "Strathallan") [1983] 1
LLR 183. All five law lords who sat in that case unanimously agreed that the
approach towards limitation of liability clauses should not follow the
approach taken in respect of exemption of liability clauses. The rationale for
this distinction as stated by Lord Wilberforce was:

"Clauses of limitation are not regarded by the Courts with the same hostility
as clauses of exclusion: this is because they must be related to other
contractual terms, in particular to the risks to which the defending party may
be exposed, the remuneration which he receives, and possibly also the
opportunity of the other party to insure."

Lord Fraser, in his judgment, dealing specifically with the Morton rules
enunciated by the Privy Council in _Canada Steamship Lines_ said:

"There are later authorities which lay down very strict principles to be
applied when considering the effect of clauses of exclusion or of indemnity –
see particularly the Privy Council case of _Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The
King_ …

_

In my opinion these principles are not applicable in their full rigour when
considering the effect of clauses merely limiting liability. Such clauses will
of course be read contra proferentem and must be clearly expressed, but there
is no reason why they should be judged by the specially exacting standards
which are applied to exclusion and indemnity clauses

_. The reason for imposing such standards on these clauses is the inherent
improbability that the other party to a contract including such a clause
intended to release the proferens from a liability that would otherwise fall
upon him. But there is no such high degree of improbability that he would
agree to a limitation of the liability of the proferens, especially when, as
explained in condition 4(i) of the present contract, the potential losses that
might be caused by the negligence of the proferens or its servants are so
great in proportion to the sums that can reasonably be charged for the
services contracted for. _It is enough in the present case that the clause
must be clear and unambiguous_."

(Emphasis added.)

62\. The terms of the limitation clause in the "_Strathallan_ " [special
condition 2(f)] were as follows:

" 2(f). If, pursuant to the provisions set out herein, _any liability on the
part of the Company shall arise (whether under the express or implied terms of
this Contract, or at Common Law, or in any other way_) to the customer for any
loss or damage of whatever nature arising out of or connected with the
provision of, or purported provision of, or failure in provision of, the
services covered by this Contract, _such liability shall be limited to the
payment by_ the Company by way of damages of a sum … [alternatives are stated
…]. "

(Emphasis added.)

In considering whether special condition 2(f) would limit the liability of
Securicor arising from its own negligence Lord Fraser said:

"… the question remains whether in its context it is sufficiently clear and
unambiguous to receive effect in limiting the liability of Securicor for its
own negligence or that of its employees. In my opinion it is. It applies to
any liability

… whether under the express or implied terms of this contract, or at common
law, or in any other way.

Liability at common law is undoubtedly wide enough to cover liability
including the negligence of the proferens itself, so that even without relying
on the final words ‘any other way’, I am clearly of opinion that the
negligence of Securicor is covered."

63\. In the present case, the opening words of cl 27, without taking into
account sub-cl (b) thereof, provides that the liability of the company,

"…howsoever arising and notwithstanding that such liability shall have arisen
from the neglect or default of the Company …"

shall not exceed the amounts stated thereunder. These words, following the
approach adopted in the "_Strathallan_ ", are wide enough to limit liability
arising out of the negligence of the proferens. But when one goes on to
consider sub-cl (b) – the sub-clause relied on by Global in its defence – the
broad sweep of cl 27 is whittled down considerably. Clause 27(b) provides as
follows:

"(b) in respect of claims for delay where not excluded by the provisions of
these Conditions, the amount of the Company’s charges for the services in
respect of the Goods delayed."

On a plain reading of cl 27(b), the limitation of liability envisaged is a
limitation of liability in respect of claims for delay. That clause could not
therefore limit Global’s liability arising from its negligence in fulfilling
its obligations to properly monitor the shipment of the X-ray machines. Clause
27(b) is therefore of no avail to Rapiscan to the claim founded on negligent
misrepresentation.

64\. Mr Loo, in his closing submissions, adverted to other clauses in the SFFA
Conditions that may have limited liability for negligence. These other clauses
were, however, not invoked by Global in its pleadings and I agree with Mr
Palaniappan that it would be prejudicial to Rapiscan for this court to
consider defences that Global had not raised in its pleadings.

_**

  
(b) Under the bill of exchange

**_.

65\. The limitation of liability provisions in the bill of exchange is in the
same clause that seeks to exempt Global from liability in respect of direct,
indirect or consequential losses, namely, cl 6(4)(A) [paragraph 57 above]. The
limitation of liability in cl 6(4)(A) is similar in scope to the limitation of
liability under cl 27(b) of the SFFA Conditions. The relevant part of cl
6(4)(A) reads:

"Without prejudice to the foregoing (ie exemption from direct, indirect or
consequential losses howsoever caused), if the _Carrier is found liable for
delay, liability shall be limited_ to the freight applicable to the relevant
stage of the transport."

(Emphasis added.)

Again, the limitation of liability is confined only to liability for delay: it
does not seek to limit liability for other breaches by the carrier. Clause
6(4)(A) by itself would therefore not limit the liability of Global arising
from its breach of duty to properly monitor the shipment.

_**

  
Damages for Global’s breach of contract

**_.

66\. I am satisfied that Rapiscan has, in these proceedings, sufficiently
proved that Global breached its contractual obligation to monitor the shipment
of the X-ray machines when Jason negligently misrepresented to Rapiscan and
led Rapiscan to believe that the X-ray machines were on board the "Kota
Perkasa". I am also satisfied that the exemption clauses and the limitation of
liability relied on by Global do not exempt or limit the liability of Global
for such negligent misrepresentation. I therefore find Global liable in
damages for the breach of that obligation.

_**

  
The claims in tort

**_.

67\. Global owed a duty of care – particularly in the light of the fact that
Global knew of the importance, purpose and urgency of the shipment – to keep
Rapiscan accurately informed about the progress of the shipment. By misleading
Rapiscan about the whereabouts of the X-ray machines Global failed in this
duty of care and Rapiscan suffered losses as a direct result. The exemption
clauses and the limitation of liability clauses relied on by Global, for
reasons discussed above, do not constitute a defence or limit Global’s
liability in tort to Rapiscan for the negligent misrepresentation.

68\. In a number of cases (_Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank_
[1986] AC 80 amongst others) the courts have expressed reservations about
parties pursuing a remedy in tort when a remedy in contract was the more
appropriate. In this regard, Mr Loo in his submissions accepted – based on
what Selvam J said in _Darwish MKF Al Gobaishi v House of Hung Pte Ltd_ [1998]
3 SLR 435 – that a party who performs his contractual obligation in a
negligent way is in breach of contract and should be pursued in contract even
though he could also be pursued in tort for negligence. I have found Global
liable in contract and there is therefore no need to consider in detail
Global’s concurrent liability in tort.

_**

  
The measure of damages

**_.

69\. I am satisfied that it was Global’s negligent conduct in misleading
Rapiscan about the whereabouts of the X-ray machines that caused Rapiscan to
lose the Fei Fu contract. If Global had, when the X-ray machines were in
Singapore awaiting trans-shipment to Macau, informed Rapiscan that they had
not been able to load the X-ray machines on board the "Kota Perkasa", Rapiscan
would have been able to air-freight the X-ray machines to Macau and save the
Fei Fu contract. Failing that, even if Global had timeously informed Rapiscan
that the X-ray machines were on board the "Kota Jaya", I am satisfied that
Rapiscan would have been able to get alternative X-ray machines to Macau to
save the Fei Fu contract. Global’s failure to comply with this contractual
obligation resulted in the loss of the Fei Fu contract – a loss that amounted
to US$125,000 in lost rental.

70\. Rapiscan was under an obligation to mitigate damages. At the time
Rapiscan embarked on the exercise of air-freighting other X-ray machines to
Macau, there was a reasonable prospect that the exercise would be successful
but that prospect, by reason of matters outside the control of Rapiscan, did
not materialise. Rapiscan, in my view, cannot be faulted for this failed
attempt. The expenses in connection with this exercise which amounted to
US$29,056 were incurred as a direct consequence of Global’s breach of its
obligation to keep Rapiscan informed of the progress of the shipment and would
be recoverable as damages.

71\. In the circumstances, I award judgment with costs in favour of Rapiscan
for the sum of US$154,056 with interest thereon at 4% per annum from date of
writ.
