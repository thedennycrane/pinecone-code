**_The application_**

****

This was an application by Polybuilding (S) Pte Ltd, the plaintiffs. There
were five defendants: (1) Lim Heng Lee; (2) Koh Guan Poh; (3) Loh Song Huat
[commat] Loh Sung Wat; (4) Lim Soo Chong [commat] Lim Soo Kong; and (5)
Polymotor Pte Ltd.  
  
The application sought remedies against the second defendant only. It asked
for a declaration that the second defendant, Koh Guan Poh, ceased to be a
director of the plaintiffs from 27 January 2001. It also asked for certain
other consequential equitable remedies including an injunction. No remedy was
sought against any of the other defendants.  
  
The basis of the application was that the second defendant was removed from
his office as director by an ordinary resolution passed at an extraordinary
general meeting of the plaintiff company.  
  
At the outset I suggested that it might be better if this matter were heard
with oral evidence. The first and second defendants responded positively. The
plaintiffs and other defendants were adamantly against it. So,I decided to
hear the matter.  
  
At the hearing, it was obvious that no remedy was sought against the first,
third, fourth and fifth defendants. It was summarily dismissed as against
those four defendants.  
  
The second defendant contested the application. His ground was that the fifth
defendant (Polymotor Pte Ltd) was not properly represented at the EGM of the
plaintiffs (Polybuilding (S) Pte Ltd) on 27 January 2001 when a resolution was
purportedly passed, voting him out of office. This ground was elaborated as
follows.  
  
Polymotor at the material time had five shareholders. Four of them were
directors. They were:  
  

Lim Soo San | - | Shareholder  
---|---|---  
Lim Soo Tiah | - | Shareholder and Director  
Lim Soo Chong | - | Shareholder and Director  
Koh Guan Poh | - | Shareholder and Director  
Loh Song Huat | - | Shareholder and Director  
  
  
  
On 13 December 2000 three of the four directors without notice to Koh Guan Poh
signed a `written resolution` appointing one of them, Loh Song Huat, as the
representative of Polymotor at any meeting of the plaintiffs. The written
resolution, says the second defendant, was invalid because he, as a director,
had no notice of it and accordingly it was unlawful in equity. Since some of
those who signed the written resolution, with full knowledge of the
invalidity, voted in concert to oust him from the board of Polybuilding, the
removal was unlawful.  
  
Article 92, pursuant to which the written resolution was procured, read as
follows:

> _A resolution in writing signed by a majority of the Directors of the
> Company shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a
> Meeting of the Directors duly called and constituted._

  
  
**_Chan Choon Ming v Low Poh Choon_ **It is necessary to consider the law. The
following propositions are settled law.

(1) Every director of a company, by reason of being vested with the power to
act on behalf of the company becomes a fiduciary. That fiduciary office
imposes on every director an equitable duty to act bona fide in the interest
of the company as a whole and not for personal and ulterior reasons. Lack of
bona fides of the directors is a good ground to invalidate the written
resolution. The impropriety of individual directors will be imputed to the
company which has notice of the impropriety through its directors. See **Chua
Boon Chin v JM McCormack** [1978-1979] SLR 496  [1979] 2 MLJ 156 , **Howard
Smith v Ampol Petroleum** [1974] AC 821[1974] 1 All ER 1126 and **Lee Tak
Samuel v Chou Wen Hsien** [1984] HKC 409[1984] 1 WLR 1202.

(2) Since all directors collectively owe their duties to the company no
director or group of directors can exclude one or more directors from their
deliberations or exclude his input of his insight before a decision is taken.
This is not a mere procedural propriety; it goes to the root of essential
justice. See **Chan Choon Ming v Low Poh Choon** (Unreported) .

(3) Where the majority of directors abuse their voting powers by voting
without good faith and for ulterior reasons and not for the good of the
company, they commit a wrong which can be remedied under s 216 of the
Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Ed) (oppression or injustice to minority
interest).

(4) The directors are the primary organ of a company. They have powers
conferred on them to manage the company. These powers are conferred upon the
directors for their conscious and collective decision as a board. Prima facie,
they can be exercised only at a board meeting of which due notice has been
given and at which a quorum is present. And although majority decision
prevails, a meeting of the majority without notice to the minority is
ineffective - **Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines** (Unreported) **Young
v Ladies` Imperial Club** [1920] 2 KB 523 and (supra) at p 2,041.  
  
In **_Chan Choon Ming v Low Poh Choon_** (supra), art 90 of a company provided
as follows:

> _A resolution in writing signed by a majority of the directors present in
> Malaysia entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the directors, shall be
> as valid and effectual as if it had been resolved at the meeting of the
> directors duly convened and held._

  
  
A majority of directors signed circular resolutions without consulting a
minority director and deliberately excluding them from the minority director.
The resolution was struck down on the ground that it was unlawful. In a short
but salutary judgment, VC George J said at p 2,041:

> _Article 90 which is one of the articles under the general heading
> `Proceedings of Directors` has to be read in the context of the principle
> that the powers conferred upon directors are conferred on them collectively
> as a board. In that context it is inconceivable that notice of an intended
> resolution of the directors need not be given to every member of the board.
> If upon the majority signing such a resolution it is not necessary to pass
> it on to the others who are present in the country there could be a
> situation of a company being managed, not by the board, but by a clique, no
> doubt consisting of the majority of the board, using art 90 type of
> resolutions and leaving the minority completely in the dark as to what is
> happening in and to the company. It cannot then be said that the business of
> the company is managed by the directors (as provided by art 73)._

> _In**Pulbrook v Richmond Consolidated Mining Co** [1878] 9 Ch D 610, what
> Jessel MR said, in dealing with the case of a director who was improperly
> and without cause excluded from meetings of the board, is I think applicable
> to a director kept in the dark in respect of an art 90 resolution. He said:_

> _`He has been excluded. Now, it appears to me that this is an individual
> wrong, or a wrong that has been done to an individual. It is a deprivation
> of his legal rights for which the directors are personally and individually
> liable. He has a right by the constitution of the company to take a part in
> its management, to be present, and to vote at the meetings of the board of
> directors. He has a perfect right to know what is going on at these
> meetings. It may affect his individual interest as a shareholder as well as
> his liability as a director, because it has been sometimes held that even a
> director who does not attend board meetings is bound to know what is done in
> his absence.`_

> _In my judgment to make art 73 meaningful and to give effect to the
> collective responsibility of the board, although all that is required for an
> effective art 90 resolution is that it be signed by the majority, it must be
> taken as implied that every member of the board has to have the resolution
> circulated to him or her before it can be accepted as a directors`
> resolution. Which is why in boardroom parlance, an art 90 type of resolution
> is usually referred to as a circular resolution. Each of the said
> resolutions, notice of which was not given to the plaintiff, is, in my
> judgment, ineffective._

  
  
In this regard there is much merit in what is stated in **_Company Law (2nd
Ed, 1997)_** by Walter Woon at p 216:

> _Even if the articles allow a circular resolution to be effective when
> signed by the majority, notice of the resolution must still be given to all
> directors. Otherwise a cabal of controlling directors could do things
> without the knowledge of the rest of the board, a situation fraught with
> danger for the company._

  
  
**_Mayson, French & Ryan on Company Law _ **Having stated the substantive
propositions I shall now state two peripheral propositions which bear on this
case:

(1) he who comes to equity must come with clean hands;

(2) in a case where the court is exercising a judicial discretionary remedy,
it is entitled to and obliged to lift the veil of incorporation and scrutinise
the real motives of those who hide behind the corporate veil. See (17th Ed,
2000) para 5.2.2.7 and the cases cited there.  
  
In this case, the act of the majority directors of Polymotor purporting to
sign the written resolution of appointing one of them the corporate
representative was a selfish and surreptitious act. It was to achieve their
private agenda of discarding the second defendant as a director of
Polybuilding.  
  
The act of the majority directors might constitute an act of conspiracy if the
second defendant suffered any damage. The second defendant has also asserted
that it was an act of minority oppression or injustice. I am not concerned
with these matters in this case.  
  
They acted without giving notice to the second defendant who was also a
substantial shareholder of Polymotor. He was away in Thailand at that time.
Accordingly, the third defendant was not a true representative of Polymotor.
The act of the majority directors was tantamount to substantial injustice
because it was a selfish act lacking good faith. The plaintiffs had notice of
the defect because those who voted to remove the second defendant had notice
of the defect and unlawfulness of the written resolution.  
  
Additionally, the plaintiffs sought the equitable remedies of declaration and
injunction. In doing so they did not come with clean hands.  
  
The fact that there was a procedural irregularity in addition to lack of good
faith distinguishes this case from the facts of the **_Lee Tak_** Samuel case
(supra).  
  
Accordingly, the plaintiffs` application is dismissed against the second
defendant. The plaintiffs shall pay the costs of the application.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application dismissed.
