factors

Public Prosecutor has power to intervene in criminal proceedings and private
prosecutions – Whether Public Prosecutor has power to discontinue proceedings  
  

: This was an appeal against the decision of the District Judge Salina Ishak
in a private summons case when she convicted the respondent of one offence
each under ss 352, 341 and 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The respondent was
sentenced to a fine of $500 (in default two days` imprisonment) in respect of
the first offence, a fine of $500 (in default two days` imprisonment) in
respect of the second offence, and a fine of $1,000 (in default five days`
imprisonment) in respect of the third offence. The appellant appealed against
the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. Although the
Public Prosecutor had not been involved directly in the proceedings, he took
the unusual step of intervening in the appeal. He submitted that the appeal be
discontinued. I ordered that the appeal be discontinued and now give my
reasons.

**_The facts_ **

****

Both the appellant and respondent conduct business from units in a building
complex called Balestier Point. The appellant operates a health centre and was
the chairman of the Balestier Point Management Corporation at the material
time. The respondent is a car dealer and parked cars which were offered for
sale by his business at the car park of Balestier Point.  
  
Some time before the incident occurred, the appellant had instituted rules
which imposed a charge on the transfer of season parking labels from one
vehicle to another. This materially affected the respondent`s business and
that of other car dealers operating in the complex, as the dealers would
transfer the season parking labels from cars which they had sold to cars which
were yet to be sold. With the introduction of this scheme, they were looking
to incur significant transfer fees. If the parking label used on a vehicle had
not been issued for that vehicle, the vehicle was liable to be wheel-clamped
and a fee would have to be paid to have the clamp released. The respondent`s
unhappiness about this situation was the backdrop for the offences.  
  
On 15 September 2000, the respondent confronted the appellant and wanted to
know if the appellant had caused one of his vehicles (without a valid season
parking label) to be wheel-clamped. The judge accepted the appellant`s
evidence of the events that subsequently transpired. The cogent facts were as
follows. The respondent insisted on talking to the appellant and raised his
hands to prevent the appellant from proceeding to the restroom (this gave rise
to the charge under s 341). The respondent hurled vulgarities at the
appellant. He said that he would `kill` the appellant if the appellant
`touched` his car and that he would `get people to beat` the appellant (this
gave rise to the charge under s 506). The respondent also raised his fist, at
which point the appellant fled to the security counter and called the police
(this gave rise to the charge under s 352).  
  
Some police officers arrived and tried to mediate between the appellant and
the respondent. The respondent offered a verbal apology but the appellant
insisted on a written one. When the respondent refused, the appellant
commenced the private prosecution. The police did not think it necessary to
investigate further nor to charge the respondent.  
  
**_The judge`s decision_**

****

The judge handed down her grounds of decision on 14 May 2001. She set out in
detail the evidence of the prosecution and of the defence. She found that the
appellant had proved his case beyond a reasonable doubt, but did not elaborate
on how she arrived at that conclusion.  
  
Although the appellant did not expressly argue for a custodial sentence, the
key issue in this appeal (as between the appellant and the respondent) was
whether the sentence imposed should have included a custodial element. It
should be noted that the judge had already imposed the maximum fine in respect
of the first two charges, while there is no prescribed maximum fine for the
third charge. In deciding that the case did not warrant a custodial sentence,
the judge was mindful in particular of the following factors:

(1) although the police were aware of the matter, they did not conduct further
investigations and the Public Prosecutor did not think it necessary to
institute a public prosecution;

(2) the appellant had brought the private prosecution because he was
dissatisfied with the respondent`s verbal apology and insisted on a written
one;

(3) the respondent did not cause any physical injury or property damage;

(4) all three charges arose from the same incident.  
  
**_The appeal against sentence_**

****

The appellant`s first ground of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly
inadequate and that is the only ground that is of relevance in a court of law.
Firstly, in relation to an offence under s 352, the respondent cited
**_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_** to show that, in the
absence of aggravating factors, the usual sentence imposed was a fine. There
were no aggravating factors in this case; and the fact that the respondent had
acted on impulse would negative the seriousness of the crime.  
  
Secondly, although the respondent did not refer to **_Sentencing Practice in
the Subordinate Courts_** in relation to an offence under s 341, it would be
useful to refer to the same. Once again, factors which indicated that the
crime was not a serious one were present: one, the respondent acted on
impulse, not because he intended to commit a serious offence; and two, the
restraint was only momentary.  
  
Thirdly, in relation to an offence under s 506, the respondent referred to the
abovementioned book to show that the circumstances of this offence rendered it
less serious. For example, although the respondent had threatened to have the
appellant beaten up and said he would `kill` the appellant if the appellant
touched his car, this was a one-off, impulsive outburst. It did not occur in a
deserted place. It did not take place in a wider context of illegal activity.  
  
The appellant`s remaining grounds of appeal were either irrelevant or
unsubstantiated.  
  
**_Public Prosecutor intervention_**

****

There were two parts to the DPP`s submission. The first was that the Public
Prosecutor had a right to intervene to have the proceedings discontinued. The
second was that the appeal was without merit. This second issue has been dealt
with above.  
  
The starting point was art 35(8) of the Constitution, which states:

> _The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to
> institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence._

  
  
Section 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) further provides:

> _The Attorney-General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the
> control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this
> Code._

  
  
Since the provisions refer to `any proceedings for any offence` and `criminal
prosecutions and proceedings under this Code` without qualification, they
apply to private prosecutions as well. It would seem that these provisions
squarely contemplate the risks particular to private prosecutions, where the
complainant may allow his `private passions and prejudices to creep into the
conduct` of a criminal appeal ( **Ponniah v Lim** [1960] MLJ 152 ). A private
prosecution is a prosecution by a private individual which, if successful,
relies on the state machinery to mete out the sentence imposed. In addition, a
criminal offence is based on the notion of a wrong committed against society
or social values. It follows that a private prosecution should not defeat the
interests of state and society (such interests in this context being
determined by the Public Prosecutor).  
  
The case law on this subject is also clear. **Hawa bte Haji Mohamed Hussain v
Miranda** [1988] SLR 720  [1988] 3 MLJ 397  and **Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar
Singh** [1999] 2 SLR 349  involved straightforward applications of art 35(8)
and s 336(1).  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

For the reasons stated above, I ordered that the proceedings be dismissed.  
  
**Outcome:**

Proceedings dismissed.
