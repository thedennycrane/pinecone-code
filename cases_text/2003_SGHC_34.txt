Civil Procedure – Appeals – Leave – Whether leave to appeal required Â– Proper
interpretation of s 21(1) Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322).  
  

1\. This was an application for leave to appeal to the High Court. The
applicant was the defendant in a District Court suit. The claim arose from a
motorcar accident. The trial judge found the defendant to be 40% to blame for
the accident. The plaintiff was a cyclist who collided with a car driven by
the defendant. The court assessed damages at $79,800 on a 100% basis. The
amount after apportionment of liability at 60% was $47,880.

2\. The first issue before me was whether the defendant required leave of
court to appeal against the decision below. Mr Ramasamy, counsel for the
defendant, submitted that leave was not required whereas Mr Perumal, counsel
for the plaintiff, submitted that since the amount awarded was $47,880 it was
less than the $50,000 limit under s 21(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature
Act, the defendant, therefore, required leave to appeal.

3\. This issue thus concerned the proper interpretation of s 21(1). The
arguments advanced by counsel on both sides were virtually identical to
submissions by counsel in another proceedings that was heard by me just
preceding this originating summons, namely Originating Summons No. 1744 of
2002 which was heard together with Originating Summons No. 1766 of 2002.

4\. I had delivered my judgment in this originating summons as well as that of
Originating Summons No. 1744 of 2002 and Originating Summons No. 1766 of 2002,
one after the other. Insofar as the issue of interpretation of s 21(1) of the
Supreme Court of Judicature Act is concerned, my grounds are the same as that
delivered in Originating Summons No. 1744 of 2002 and Originating Summons No.
1766 of 2002.

5\. The difference between the two originating summonses is that the applicant
in this originating summons (who was the defendant at the trial below) is the
party who intends to appeal against the judgment sum of $47,880. As I had
explained, the amount in dispute may be limited by the stand taken by the
party concerned at the trial or hearing below. In this case the defendant’s
position below was that there was no liability, or zero sum. Her position
after the trial was the same save that she now wishes to appeal against the
sum adjudged against her, and that is $47,880. In either case, the amount in
dispute in the cause does not exceed $50,000. In the circumstances, in this
case, the defendant would require leave to appeal. I then considered the
question as to whether leave ought to be granted.

6\. The defendant seeks to overturn a finding of liability as well as the
quantum of damages. The issue of liability was determined partly on findings
of fact and partly from inferences from facts. There were no grounds of
decision available from the trial judge. I accept the submissions of Mr
Ramasamy and am of the view that the defendant has raised credible issues for
argument on appeal, the merits of which must, of course, be reserved to the
judge hearing the appeal. I also took into account the fact that the amount in
dispute is very close to the $50,000 threshold.

7\. I, therefore, granted leave to the defendant to appeal with costs in the
cause here and below.
