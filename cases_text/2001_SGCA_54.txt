(delivering the judgment of the court): This appeal raises a point of
procedure on the right of intervention of a solicitor in relation to an
application made by a complainant who is dissatisfied with the decision of the
Council of the Law Society of Singapore, pursuant to s 96 of the Legal
Profession Act (`the Act`).  
  
**_Background_**

****

By a letter dated 18 August 1999, the appellant in the present appeal
(hereinafter referred to as `Mr Wee`) complained to the Law Society against
two advocates and solicitors, namely, Davinder Singh SC and Hri Kumar (`the
two solicitors`). The gist of the complaint relates to the preparation of
affidavits for clients in relation to judicial proceedings and which
affidavits allegedly contained false statements. The Council of the Law
Society decided that the letter of complaint disclosed no information of
misconduct that must be referred to the Chairman of the Inquiry Committees
under s 85(1) of the Act.  
  
Mr Wee was dissatisfied with the decision of the Council and commenced OS
37/2000 seeking a declaration that the Council should have referred the letter
of complaint to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel in accordance with s 85(1).
In that application the High Court judge ruled that of the four alleged
`falsehoods` set out in the letter, three were `baseless and frivolous` and
did not fall within s 85(1). As for the fourth alleged `falsehood` he felt
that it should be referred to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel and
accordingly so ordered.  
  
An inquiry committee (`IC`) was constituted to investigate into the fourth
alleged falsehood. After due inquiry, the IC submitted its report and
recommended that it be dismissed. Pursuant to s 87, the Council, having
considered the report, determined that there was no case for a formal
investigation by a disciplinary committee (`DC`). It is against this
determination of the Council that Mr Wee has applied, by way of OS 1573/2000,
and pursuant to s 96(1), to a judge for an order compelling the Society to
apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a DC to investigate that
complaint. It is in relation to OS 1573/2000 that the two solicitors have
applied to intervene. The assistant registrar granted the application. The
judge on appeal affirmed that decision. Mr Wee has taken it further before us.  
  
For completeness, we ought to mention that in relation to the other three
alleged `falsehoods` in the letter of complaint alluded to in [para ]3 above,
and which was dismissed by the High Court, the matter went on appeal before
the Court of Appeal. The court allowed the appeal, directing that the
complaint relating to the other three alleged falsehoods be also referred to
the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel: see **Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of
Singapore** [2001] 2 SLR 145 .  
  
**_Basis of application to intervene_**

****

In the court below, counsel for the two solicitors argued that they were
entitled to intervene pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)(b)(i), namely, that they are
persons whose presence before the court is necessary to ensure that all
matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined
and adjudicated upon.  
  
**_Decision below_**

****

The learned judge below was of the view that, in an application under s 96,
one of the real substantive parties was the solicitor against whom the
complaint was made. The application would be of serious consequence to the
solicitor and if the matter could be `nipped` in the bud, namely, that the
court was persuaded not to allow the complaint to go to a DC, the solicitor
concerned would have avoided the inconvenience, expenses, and anxiety of a
hearing before the DC and the risk of an adverse outcome against him.
Therefore, the solicitors concerned would have, at least, as great an interest
as the complainant has in a s 96 application.  
  
However, without deciding whether O 15 r 6(2)(b)(i), or even (ii), was
applicable, the judge held that the court had an inherent jurisdiction to
allow a party to intervene if the justice of the case required and that the
jurisdiction was not confined to the illustrations given in para 15/6/12 of
the **_Supreme Court Practice_** 1999\. He was of the opinion that this was a
`just case` to allow the two solicitors to intervene.  
  
**_Order 15 rule 6(2)(b)_**

****

Before us, the parties have submitted on the question of the applicability of
O 15 r 6(2)(b)(i) and (ii) and on the inherent jurisdiction of the court, in
determining whether the two solicitors should be allowed to intervene. We
shall consider each of the bases in turn.  
  
It may be convenient for us at this juncture to set out the provisions of O 15
r 6(2)(b)(i) and (ii):

> _Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings in
> any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just and
> either of its own motion or on application -_

> _
>
> (a) ...
>
> (b) order any or the following persons to be added as a party, namely:
>
> (i) any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence
> before the Court is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or
> matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon; or
>
> (ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may
> exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with
> any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of
> the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and
> that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.
>
> _

  
  
Mr Yim, counsel for the respondents (the two solicitors), submits that in this
instance both limbs of r 6(2)(b) are applicable. In relation to the first limb
he says that it is necessary for the solicitors to be joined as parties in the
originating summons to ensure that all matters in that action may be
effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon. As an application
to the High Court under s 96 is really a request to the court to review the
decision of the Council and of the IC (where the Council has adopted the
recommendation of the IC), allowing the intervention would enable the court to
`obtain a more complete picture of the facts, circumstances and legal
arguments of the case`.  
  
In relation to the second limb, Mr Yim submits that there exists a question or
issue between Mr Wee, the Law Society and the two solicitors. The allegation
of misconduct in the complaint is a matter of concern to all three parties. It
would be just and convenient for the two solicitors to be heard. There would
be no prejudice to Mr Wee or the Law Society. In this regard, counsel refers
to the expenses which would have to be incurred by the two solicitors before
the DC and emotional trauma which the solicitors would have to go through even
though they may eventually be vindicated before the DC. Thus, it is important
that the court hearing the originating summons should have the fullest
assistance from all concerned parties.  
  
The scope and application of the first limb has been considered in numerous
cases. It would suffice if we refer to only two. In **Pegang Mining Co v
Choong Sam** [1969] 2 MLJ 52 , a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from
Malaysia, the court was concerned with the then Malaysian O 16 r 11, the
equivalent of the first limb. There, the Privy Council stated that one of the
principal objects of the rule was to enable the court to prevent injustice
being done to a person `whose rights will be affected by its judgment by
proceeding to adjudicate upon the matter in dispute in the action without his
being given an opportunity of being heard`. This being the object, flexibility
of approach must be the order of the day. The Privy Council said that in
determining whether a person should be joined as a party, the question to be
asked was (at p 56):

> _Will his rights against or liabilities to any party to the action in
> respect of the subject matter of the action be directly affected by any
> order which may be made in the action?_

  
  
In **Gurtner v Circuit** [1968] 2 QB 587, a case which concerned the joinder
of the Motor Insurers Bureau as a party, Lord Denning MR said (at p 595):

> _It seems to me that when two parties are in dispute in an action at law,
> and the determination of that dispute will directly affect a third person in
> his legal rights or in his pocket, in that he will be bound to foot the
> bill, then the court in its discretion may allow him to be added as a party
> on such terms as it thinks fit. By so doing, the court achieves the object
> of the rule. It enables all matters in dispute to "be effectually and
> completely determined and adjudicated upon" between all those directly
> concerned in the outcome._

  
  
It is perhaps necessary for us to remind ourselves as to what is the scheme of
things under Pt VII of the Act dealing with disciplinary proceedings against
errant solicitors. The Act contemplates two stages of investigation pursuant
to the receipt of a complaint. The first stage is before an inquiry committee,
whose function is to sift out frivolous and wholly unmeritorious complaint.
The nature of the inquiry before the IC was recently dealt with by this court
in **Subbiah Pillai v Wong Meng Meng** [2001] 3 SLR 544  and we do not think
there is a need for us to traverse that ground again. If the IC determines
that there should be a formal investigation into the complaint, the Council
shall then request the Chief Justice to appoint a DC to hear the case.
However, if the IC should determine that a formal investigation is not
necessary, and if the Council should agree with that determination, the
complainant has the recourse of applying to the High Court to ask for a review
of the decision of the Council and an order compelling the Society to apply to
the Chief Justice for the appointment of a DC. This is what happened in the
present case.  
  
Here, we would like to make an observation on the remark of the judge below as
to the idea of `nipping` in the bud. The very elaborate scheme set out in Pt
VII of the Act is one that seeks to strike a balance between the interests of
the public and that of the individual solicitor who is under complaint. As
stated before, the proceeding before the IC is to ensure that clearly
frivolous complaints should not be allowed to go further. But it is not the
mandate of the IC to come to a firm view as to the merits where there is
conflict as to the facts. That would be the task of the DC. Under s 87(2), if
the IC recommends that a DC be appointed, the Council has no discretion in the
matter, but if it recommends that a formal investigation by a DC is not
necessary, the Council may disagree and approach the Chief Justice for the
appointment of a DC. Where the alleged misconduct is trivial which does not
warrant the appointment of a DC, the IC may recommend a penalty (not exceeding
$5,000) be imposed by the Council. Here again, the Council is not obliged to
affirm the recommendation. Thus, the entire scheme is one where primary
consideration is the protection of the public. We thought we should say all
these lest the idea of `nipping` in the bud might give the wrong impression.  
  
Having regard to the nature of the first stage of the disciplinary process
before the IC, and the object of the application by Mr Wee to the High Court
under s 96, we do not think the two solicitors are persons who `ought to be
joined` as parties. Neither is their presence before the court `necessary` to
ensure that all matters in the cause may be effectually and completely
determined. At the hearing, the Law Society would have to defend its decision,
in the light of the report of the IC, why a formal investigation by a DC is
not necessary. The hearing of the application could quite properly proceed
without the presence of the two solicitors, even though they are the subject
of the complaint. Having an interest in the outcome of the application in the
originating summons, which the two solicitors no doubt have, does not mean
that the persons should be joined as, or it is necessary to make him, a party
to the application. An adverse decision by a judge in such an originating
summons application does not mean that the solicitor`s rights are affected -
no definitive decision has been taken. All it means is that the solicitor must
explain himself formally (with the support of witnesses, if any) before the
DC.  
  
Turning to the second limb of r 6(2)(b), the court has the power, under that
limb, to add a person as a party where a question or issue arising out of or
relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the action may
exist between him and a party to the action which the court thinks it would be
just and convenient to determine between him and that party as well as between
the parties to the action. This limb, in our view, is also inapplicable. In
the originating summons application of Mr Wee there is only one issue, whether
a prima facie case has been shown for the complaint to proceed forth to the
DC. There is really no different issue existing between the two solicitors and
either the Law Society or Mr Wee.  
  
Finally, it may be helpful if we turn our mind to the basic question: what are
the objects of the two limbs of r 6(2)(b). In para 15/6/7 of the **_Supreme
Court Practice_** , the learned authors summarise it as follows:

> _... the objects of para (2)(b) as to joinder of parties are broadly the
> same as the objects of the rules relating to third party proceedings, namely
> (a) to prevent multiplicity of actions and to enable the Court to determine
> disputes between all parties to them in one action, and (b) to prevent the
> same or substantially the same questions or issues being tried twice with
> possibly different results._

  
  
None of these problems exist in the present matter.  
  
**_Inherent jurisdiction_**

****

We now turn to the question of inherent jurisdiction of the court to allow the
two solicitors to intervene. This was the basis upon which the court below
granted the request of the two solicitors.  
  
The inherent jurisdiction of the court to make such order as the justice of
the case may require is set out in O 92 r 4 as follows:

> _For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these Rules
> shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make
> any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of
> the process of the Court._

  
  
The judge below noted the following passage in the **_Supreme Court
Practice_** para 15/6/8:

> _In addition to the powers contained in this rule or under O. 75, r. 17(1),
> the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to enable it to do justice in
> particular cases to allow a person not a party to intervene in proceedings
> if the effect of such proceedings has been, or is likely to be, to cause
> such a person serious hardship, difficulty or damage, e.g. a person whose
> property is adversely affected by the presence of an arrested vessel in an
> Admiralty action in rem even though he has no interest in the vessel to
> entitle him to intervene under O. 75, r. 17(1) (**The Mardina Merchant**
> (Unreported) )._

  
  
But, he did not think that the jurisdiction should only be invoked where
`serious hardship, difficulty or damage` would be caused to the intended
intervener.  
  
In **The Mardina Merchant** [1974] 3 All ER 749, the court allowed, under its
inherent jurisdiction, the intervention by the Port Authority in an admiralty
action in rem because the continued presence of an arrested vessel was causing
the authority `serious hardship, difficulty or danger`. The Port Authority
sought the removal of the vessel to another location. It seems to us clear
that those terms were used because they were apt descriptions in relation to
the problems encountered by the Port Authority.  
  
Indeed **_The Mardina Merchant_** (supra) is interesting. Our O 92 r 4 talks
of preventing `injustice` or `abuse of process`. We have serious doubts that
`preventing injustice` or `preventing abuse of process` arose in that case.
What occurred was that because of the arrest of the vessel, serious practical
problems were encountered by the Port Authority. Yet, Brandon J did not feel
constrained to grant the application.  
  
The applicable rule in that case was RSC O 75 r 17 and it provided:

> _Where property against which an action in rem is brought is under arrest or
> money representing the proceeds of sale of that property is in court, a
> person who has an interest in that property or money but who is not a
> defendant in the action may, with the leave of the Court, intervene in the
> action._

  
  
Brandon J, while noting that the Port Authority did not have an `interest` in
the vessel, and that the situation did not come within that rule, nevertheless
felt that the rule was not exhaustive of the powers of the court to do justice
in particular cases. He concluded:

> _there must be an inherent jurisdiction in the court to allow a party to
> intervene if the effect of an arrest is to cause that party serious hardship
> or difficulty or danger._

  
  
It would appear that in England there was and is no equivalent rule to our O
92 r 4. Brandon J went on general principles. He certainly did not seek to lay
down any general criteria as to how the inherent jurisdiction should be
applied. We agree with the judge below that Brandon J`s pronouncement was just
an instance of the application of the inherent jurisdiction.  
  
It seems to us clear that by its very nature, how an inherent jurisdiction,
whether as set out in O 92 r 4 or under common law, should be exercised should
not be circumscribed by rigid criteria or tests. In each instance the court
must exercise it judiciously. In his lecture on `The Inherent Jurisdiction of
the Court` published in **_Current Legal Problems_** 1970, Sir Jack Jacob
(until lately the General Editor of the **_Supreme Court Practice_**) opined
that this jurisdiction may be invoked when it is just and equitable to do so
and in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law, to
prevent improper vexation or oppression and to do justice between the parties.
Without intending to be exhaustive, we think an essential touchstone is really
that of `need`. Bearing that in mind, one can easily understand why in **_The
Mardina Merchant_** (supra) the court invoked its inherent jurisdiction.  
  
As this court noted in **Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore**
[2001] 2 SLR 145 , Pt VII of the Act sets out an elaborate scheme on how a
complaint against a solicitor should be dealt with, with emphasis on
objectivity and transparency and the need for maintaining the highest
standards of professionalism and integrity. This can be seen from the fact
that the Act allows the complainant, should the conclusion of the IC or the DC
be in favour of the solicitor concerned, to apply to the High Court for a
review of the decision. There is no corresponding facility accorded to the
solicitor should the decision of the IC or DC be against him. But of course,
if the IC should decide that the complaint warrants a formal investigation by
the DC, the solicitor would have the opportunity to respond before the DC.
Similarly, if the DC should find that cause of sufficient gravity for
disciplinary action exists under s 83, the solicitors would have the
opportunity to challenge that finding before the court of three judges.  
  
It cannot be disputed that the solicitor complained against has an interest in
the outcome of an application made by a complainant under s 96. It is also
understandable why the solicitor may wish to intervene in that proceeding even
though it is quite unnecessary for him to do so. But it is altogether another
thing to say that there is a necessity for him to do so, a need of such a
gravity that the court should invoke its inherent jurisdiction. The
intervention in such a situation by the solicitor may or may not be of
assistance to the court. After all, the report of the IC, with all the
necessary annexes, would be before the court when it considers the
application. Besides counsel for the complainant/applicant making submission,
counsel for the Law Society would also be heard in response, the latter no
doubt seeking to support the recommendation of the IC and the decision of the
Council. Even if the solicitors should be allowed to intervene, what their
counsel would seek to do would really be no more than what the Law Society`s
counsel would be doing. Thus, we hold that the circumstances do not warrant
the court invoking its inherent jurisdiction.  
  
The question might well be asked, what prejudice would the intervention cause
to the complainant/applicant. But we do not think that that is the correct
approach upon which to invoke the court`s inherent jurisdiction. It may well
be that the question of prejudice is relevant to determine whether
intervention should be allowed in the circumstances of a case. But that is not
to say that once no prejudice is shown, the court should invoke that
jurisdiction. There must nevertheless be reasonably strong or compelling
reasons showing why that jurisdiction should be invoked.  
  
**_Judgment_**

****

Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the
assistant registrar, which was affirmed by the judge. The appellant shall have
the costs of this appeal as well as those below (before the judge and the
assistant registrar). The security for costs, together with accrued interest,
shall be refunded to the appellant.  
  
As in this appeal the Law Society has taken a neutral stand, and has not made
a submission, the contest is really between the appellant and the proposed
interveners. Thus, the costs ordered herein to be paid to the appellant shall
be borne by the proposed interveners.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
