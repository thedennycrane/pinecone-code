Choo Han Teck J:

1 The appellant was a 46 year old restaurateur. He was disqualified by a
Subordinate Court from holding a driver’s licence for two years. The
disqualification order took effect from 26 November 2008 and would have
expired on 25 November 2010. However, on 29 July 2010 the appellant was
arrested for riding a motorcycle FZ 7117 T. He pleaded guilty to that charge
as well as a charge for riding without insurance cover. He was sentenced to
five weeks’ imprisonment and four years’ disqualification in respect of the
first charge, and fined $500 in respect of the second charge.

2 The appellant was married with two daughters aged 11 and 14 at the material
time. He started a restaurant in Tanjong Pagar on 8 May 2009. Coming from
Italy, he had misgivings in having sent his children out of their country at
too young an age. One of his daughters had more trouble adapting than he
feared, and he and his wife wondered if they should send her back to Italy. On
the evening in question, the appellant spent an hour in vain to catch a taxi
home. He had also received several telephone calls from his wife telling him
that their daughter was distressed and had locked herself in the bathroom at
home. The appellant was also physically tired for want of sleep. It was under
these circumstances that he rode his brother’s motorcycle towards home when he
was stopped at a routine police road block. His brother had just left for
China to work and had asked the appellant to have the motorcycle towed away.

3 The trial judge below was of the view that an offence under s 43(4) of the
Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) usually attracts a custodial sentence
of eight weeks’ imprisonment, and a disqualification of three years. Several
cases were referred to in which the range of sentence was between four to
eight weeks’ imprisonment. Counsel on appeal referred to the same authorities
and conceded that he was unable to find cases involving motorcycles. All the
authorities referred to driving a motor car while under disqualification. The
only one that involved a motorcycle was Fazil bin Azman [2010] SGDC 186, but
in that case the rider was involved in a collision at the time of the offence.

4 I am of the view that the court may, in appropriate cases, distinguish a
case in which a motorcar or heavy vehicle was used, from one in which a
motorcycle was used in offences under s 43(4). In this case, a shorter
sentence of imprisonment may be ordered where the vehicle was a motorcycle, no
accident had occurred, no physical harm was caused and there were sympathetic
considerations available to the court. The appellant from despair and
temptation rode himself to prison. I think that he will not place himself in a
similar situation again. Consequently, I reduced the term of imprisonment from
five to two weeks. Other terms remain undisturbed.
