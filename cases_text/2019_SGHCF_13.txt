Tan Puay Boon JC:

Introduction

1 The plaintiff (“Wife”) and the defendant (“Husband”) (collectively
“Parties”) were married in November 1985. They have three sons (“the
Children”) who are all about 30 years old. Two of them are twins. The Wife,
who is 59 years old this year, has been working throughout the marriage and is
currently a research assistant. She earns approximately $5,697.20 per month.
The Husband, who is 57 years old this year, has also been working throughout
the marriage and is currently holding a senior position in a
telecommunications company. He earns approximately $20,179.75 per month. 1

2 The Parties last lived together in their matrimonial home, a HDB flat in
Bishan (“Bishan Property”) that they own. They also own a condominium unit
near Farrer Park (“Farrer Park Property”) that was purchased in 2005, and
another condominium unit in Pasir Panjang (“Pasir Panjang Property”) that was
purchased in 2010. In January 2015, the Husband moved out to live in the Pasir
Panjang Property. 2

Wife’s written submissions dated 13 July 2018 (“WWS 13 July 2018”) at para
66(i).

The Wife filed a writ of divorce in May 2016 and interim judgment was granted
on 4 October 2016 on the ground that the Husband had behaved in such a way
that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him, ending a marriage
that lasted some 31 years. The ancillary matters were adjourned to chambers.

Issues

3 The contested ancillary matters to be decided are the division of the
matrimonial assets, the maintenance for the Wife and costs.

Division of matrimonial assets

The legal principles

4 The court will divide matrimonial assets between parties in proportions that
are just and equitable, having regard to the matters set out in s 112(2) of
the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”). These matters include those
relevant for the assessment of the maintenance of the Wife, as set out in s
114(1) of the WC.

5 There are two methods available to divide the pool of matrimonial assets:
the global assessment method, and the classification method. The latter is
appropriate only in circumstances where there are multiple classes of assets,
and some assets “are not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of
efforts that the marriage represents” (TNC v TND [2016] 3 SLR 1172 at [40]).
Parties at first made their submissions on the basis that their matrimonial
assets should be pooled and valued according to the global assessment method.

The Husband then submitted later during the proceedings that the
classification method should be used. 4

Notes of Evidence (“NE”) dated 10 September 2018 at p 5.

This stemmed mainly from whether monies belonging to the estate of the
Husband’s late father should be treated as matrimonial assets. However, since
Parties agreed subsequently that they should not be so treated, and because
there is no evidence suggesting that any of the assets was wholly acquired by
the singular efforts of one party, I will adopt the global assessment
methodology, which involves the identification, assessment, division and
apportionment of the matrimonial assets (NK v NL [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [31]).

Identification and Assessment of the matrimonial assets

6 The starting position for the identification of matrimonial assets is the
date that the interim judgment is granted, ie, on 4 October 2016 (ARY v ARX
and another appeal [2016] 2 SLR 686 at [31]), and the valuation of matrimonial
assets is the date of the ancillary matters hearing, ie, on 8 October 2018
(TND v TNC and another appeal [2017] SGCA 34 (“TND v TNC”) at [19] - [20]).

7 After various updates, the Parties have provided a Joint Summary of Relevant
Information (Amendment No 3) dated 10 October 2018 (“JSRI-3”) which sets out
all the assets which the Parties individually or jointly owned, and reflects
their latest positions on the division of matrimonial assets.

8 Parties initially disagreed on whether the Children’s joint accounts that
they held with the Wife, and the Husband’s inheritance monies (including the
alleged dissipation of them) amounting to $525,264.02, should be included as
part of their matrimonial assets. 5

WWS 13 July 2018 at paras 17-34 and 39-41; HS 24 July 2018 at paras 42-94.

At the hearings on 10 September 2018 and 8 October 2018, Parties confirmed
that they have agreed that those Children’s joint accounts with the Wife and
the Husband’s inheritance monies will not form part of the pool of matrimonial
assets.

9 Parties had therefore agreed what the matrimonial assets were. While the
valuations of most of these assets were also agreed, a number of them were
disputed. I will deal with these shortly.

Assets with disputed values

11 The matrimonial assets with disputed values are the Bishan Property, the
Farrer Park Property, the Pasir Panjang Property, and the balance in the
Husband’s UOB SRS Fixed Deposit Account. I will deal with these in turn.

(1) Bishan Property

12 The Parties have different net valuations of the Bishan Property because
they valued it at different dates. The Wife valued it as at August 2018 while
the Husband valued it as at January 2018. 6

##### Foot Note 6

×

JSRI-3 at p 4.

The Wife’s net valuation was derived from deducting pending liabilities from a
gross valuation of $898,000 as at 31 August 2018 while the Husband’s net
valuation was derived from deducting pending liabilities from an agreed gross
valuation of $906,000 as at 24 January 2018.

13 Instead of the Husband’s net valuation of $799,143.00, I will adopt the
Wife’s net valuation of $822,689.48, being the value closest to the date of
the ancillary matters hearing (Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another
appeal [2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [39]). Although this is not a hard and fast rule,
neither the facts nor the Husband’s submissions suggest that it was more
appropriate to adopt the January 2018 figure: see, for example, TND v TNC at
[22]–[23].

(2) Farrer Park Property

14 The Farrer Park Property was purchased in 2005 for approximately $625,000.
The Parties’ different net valuations of this property were due to the same
reasons as that for the Bishan Property. 7

##### Foot Note 7

×

JSRI-3 at p 4.

For the same reasons in deciding the net valuation of the Bishan Property, I
will adopt the Wife’s net valuation of the Farrer Park Property of $806,936.34
instead of the Husband’s net valuation of $686,470.62.

(3) Pasir Panjang Property

15 The Pasir Panjang Property was purchased in 2010 for $2,382,330. The Wife’s
net valuation was $614,723.05 also as at August 2018 while the Husband’s net
valuation of $48,393.00 was again as at January 2018. 8

##### Foot Note 8

×

JSRI-3 at p 4.

16 The Husband’s net valuation of $48,393.00 was arrived at by deducting from
the agreed gross valuation of $2,110,000 as at 24 January 2018 the liabilities
of the property, which also included a sum of $300,000 contributed by his
mother, and $32,000 (later agreed by Parties to be $35,000) contributed by the
Children towards the purchase price of the Pasir Panjang Property. 9

##### Foot Note 9

×

HS 24 July 2018 at paras 23-24.

The Husband submitted that these were loans that have to be deducted from the
gross valuation of the Pasir Panjang Property. Otherwise, the value of the
property would be inflated, and he had to reimburse his mother the $300,000
from his share of the matrimonial assets, leaving him a substantially lower
amount. 10

##### Foot Note 10

×

Husband’s Reply Submissions dated 7 September 2018 (“HRS”) at paras 2-4.

The Wife’s position was that the $300,000 from the Husband’s mother was not a
loan, but a gift to the Husband that should be treated as the Husband’s direct
contribution and forms part of the matrimonial asset pool. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

WWS 13 July 2018 at para 59.

She agreed that the $35,000 contributed by the Children was a loan from the
Children to her. 12

##### Foot Note 12

Notes of Evidence (“NE”) of 10 September 2018 at p 5.

The $300,000 contributed by the Husband’s mother

17 I will first deal with the $300,000 contributed by the Husband’s mother. A
presumption of resulting trust arose in favour of the Husband’s mother since
equity presumes that when one party makes a voluntary payment towards a
property, he or she did not intend to benefit the other through a gift (Shi
Fang v Koh Pee Huat [1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 at [11]). This presumption of
resulting trust, however, is displaced by a presumption of advancement that
operates within a parent-child relationship by presuming that when the
Husband’s mother contributed $300,000 towards the purchase of the Pasir
Panjang Property, it was intended to be a gift to her son, the Husband (Lau
Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [56] –
[59], [67] and [77]). To rebut this presumption of advancement, the Husband
must produce evidence that the $300,000 from his mother was not intended to be
a gift, but a loan. This he has not done. The Husband failed to produce any
documentary evidence evidencing a loan, whether to him or to Parties jointly,
nor was there any affidavit from the Husband’s mother that could have
supported his claim. Further, there was no attempt by the Husband’s mother to
claim any beneficial interest in the Pasir Panjang Property. For the reasons
above, I am satisfied that the $300,000 contributed by the Husband’s mother is
a gift to the Husband. It is therefore to be taken as the Husband’s direct
contribution towards the Pasir Panjang Property.

18 For completeness, I note that there is a presumption that a parent’s
contribution towards the purchase of his or her child’s matrimonial home is
presumed to be a gift for the benefit of both the husband and wife (Ang Teng
Siong v Lee Su Min [2000] 1 SLR(R) 908 at [28]). This presumption, however, is
not applicable to this case as the Pasir Panjang Property is not a matrimonial
home, but an investment property: see for example, Beh Chin Joo and another v
Chu Kar Hwa Leonard [2018] SGHC 17 at [99].

The $35,000 contributed by the children

19 Parties have agreed that the $35,000 contributed by the Children is a loan
from the Children to the Wife. Unlike bank loans, this is a liability that is
borne by the Wife alone. It should therefore not be deducted from the gross
value of the Pasir Panjang Property when determining the net value of the
property. Similar to the treatment of the $300,000 gift from the Husband’s
mother to him as his direct contribution, the $35,000 loan from the Children
to the Wife is also to be taken as her direct contribution towards the Pasir
Panjang Property.

(4) UOB SRS Fixed Deposit Account

20 The Parties’ difference in valuation of the Husband’s UOB SRS Fixed Deposit
Account arose from the fact that the Husband used the amount as at 30 November
2016, while the Wife used the amount as at 31 December 2016. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

JSRI-3 at p 7.

I will adopt the Wife’s valuation since it is the value closest to the date of
the ancillary matters hearing on 8 October 2018.

21 In summary, I set out in the table below Parties’ valuations of the assets
with disputed values, and my valuations for these properties, after
liabilities have been deducted:

Asset| Husband’s Valuation ($)| Wife’s Valuation ($)| Court’s Valuation ($)  
---|---|---|---  
Joint Assets  
Bishan Property| 799,143.00| 822,689.48| 822,689.48  
Farrer Park Property| 686,470.62| 806,936.34| 806,936.34  
Pasir Panjang Property| 48,393.00| 614,723.05| 614,723.05  
Husband’s Asset  
UOB SRS Fixed Deposit Account| 45,791.36| 83,721.20| 83,721.20  
Total| 2,328,070.07  
  
22 I should point out that the Wife had used the “x value” provided by the
website “www.srx.com” of the Singapore Real Estate Exchange to obtain the
gross valuations of the Bishan, Farrer Park and Pasir Panjang properties as at
August 2018. These are computer-generated estimates of the value based on
certain methodologies, and she had adopted the highest values obtained. 14

##### Foot Note 14

×

W’s written submissions dated 5 September 2018 (“WWS 5 September 2018”) at Tab
D.

The Wife proposed that a joint valuer be appointed for all three properties if
Parties could not agree on the valuations. 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

NE dated 8 October 2018 at p 3.

23 While I have accepted the net valuations of the three properties based on
the gross valuations provided by the Wife, I recognise that a more
conventional valuation method may yield different gross valuations. I will
revisit this when I deal with the apportionment of the matrimonial assets
below.

Total value of pool of matrimonial assets

24 Subject to any revaluation of the Bishan, Farrer Park and Pasir Panjang
properties, the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets is set out in
the table below:

Class of Assets| Value ($)| Reference  
---|---|---  
Assets with agreed values| 1,547,087.71| [10] above.  
Assets with disputed values| 2,328,070.07| [21] above.  
Total| 3,875,157.78| -  
  
Division of matrimonial assets

25 Parties have agreed that the structured approach in ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR
1043 (“ANJ v ANK”) applies to the division of matrimonial assets. 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

WWS 13 July 2018 at paras 48-78; HS 24 July 2018 at paras 20-104.

This structured approach was succinctly summarised in TIT v TIU and another
appeal [2016] 3 SLR 1137 at [21] as follows:

(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each
other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made
towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets [(“Step 1”)];

(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to
each other, having regard to both financial and nonfinancial contributions
[(“Step 2”)]; and

(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking
an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as
“the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of
each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal
weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the
other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors
under s 112 or s 114(1) of the [WC] [(“Step 3”)].

26 I will apply this structured approach in the present case.

Step 1: Direct contributions

27 The Husband submitted that the operative date for ascertaining direct
contributions should be on 4 October 2016, the date of the interim judgment.
He argued that his contributions after parties separated (amounting to over
$333,372) towards the Bishan Property and the Pasir Panjang Property should be
reimbursed to him. 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

HRS at para 19.

The Husband highlighted that the Wife had taken the position in her second
affidavit of assets and means that the cut-off date should be the time of the
issuance of the interim judgment. The Wife submitted that payments made to the
matrimonial properties between the interim judgment and the ancillary matter
hearing date should be included as the Parties’ direct contributions. 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

WWS 5 September 2018 at paras 16-19.

In support of her submission, the Wife relied on ARL v ARM [2015] SGHC 61,
where the High Court held at [41] that:

… In order to arrive at a just and equitable division in the present case, it
is appropriate to take into account the Defendant’s direct financial
contribution of $55,890 … made up to the point of the hearing. This approach
is also consistent with the wording of s112(2) of the WC … Nothing in s 112 of
the WC dictates that only contributions up to the date of the grant of interim
judgment can be taken into account …

28 I accept the Wife’s submission despite the position taken by her earlier.
The court can deviate from the general position that the cut-off date for
direct contributions is the hearing date of the ancillary matters if it is
necessary to achieve a just and equitable division. However, I am not
satisfied that the Husband’s contribution of approximately $333,372 towards
the two matrimonial properties, which were for payments of mortgages and
expenses connected with these properties, justifies a deviation from this
general position. I therefore adopt the date of the hearing of the ancillary
matters as the cut-off date.

29 The Husband had submitted that the $300,000 contributed towards the Pasir
Panjang Property by his mother was a loan and is hence not part of his direct
financial contributions. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

HRS at paras 2-3.

I have dealt with this at [17] above, and found that the $300,000 was a gift
to the Husband that is taken to be his direct financial contribution towards
the Pasir Panjang Property. Even if the $300,000 is a loan to the Husband, it
is still to be taken to be his direct financial contribution. As a loan, he
will have to return it to his mother from his share of the matrimonial assets
after division.

30 Likewise, the $35,000 from the Children to the Wife is taken to be her
direct financial contribution towards the Pasir Panjang Property (see [19]
above). However, since it is a loan to her, the Wife will have to return the
amount to the Children from her share of the matrimonial assets after
division.

31 Parties have agreed that if the cut-off date of August 2018 is used, their
direct financial contributions will be the figures set out at JSRI-3 at pages
3 and 4. 20

She also argued that even though Parties employed domestic helpers for 19

In support of her submission, she relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision in
Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin [2009] 4 SLR(R) 935 at [20] that:

… The Wife, in other words, took on a managerial role in ensuring the smooth
running of the household (with all the accompanying logistical requirements).
This role is at least as essential and important as the direct performance of
the chores itself. Further, it is clear, in our view, that the Wife also, when
required, personally looked after the needs of the two children. Considering
that she managed to do all these while holding down a regular full-time job,
the wife should be accorded the credit that is due to her.

34 The Wife further highlighted that in 1995, ten years into the Parties’
marriage, the Husband spent a year abroad to pursue his master’s degree, and
the Wife single-handedly cared for the Children and the household with
domestic help when they remained in Singapore. 25

##### Foot Note 25

She argued that this is a substantial indirect contribution and relied on the
decision of the High Court in UAP v UAQ [2018] 3 SLR 319 at [80] that:

… [T]he Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions were significant. The Wife
had made serious sacrifices in order to support the Husband in his overseas
attachments and night classes to obtain his post-graduate degree, and to take
care of the son… The Husband’s focus was on his career …

35 In contrast, the Husband submitted that the ratio of indirect contributions
ought to be 50:50 between him and the Wife. 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

HS 24 July 2018 at para 105.

He argued that the Wife worked full-time throughout the marriage and had full-
time domestic help. The Husband also submitted that he bore the lion’s share
of the household expenses, paid for the Children’s expensive tuition classes,
helped with the household chores and organised family gatherings and
children’s parties. The Husband concluded his submission by asserting that
while Parties played differing roles throughout the marriage, their commitment
was equal. 27

##### Foot Note 27

HS 24 July 2018 at paras 65-69.

He had also continued paying the mortgages of the Farrer Park and Pasir
Panjang properties which allow them to be available for division between
Parties.

36 Even in households where both parties are working full-time, absent
concrete evidence to the contrary, the wife will ordinarily be the party who
renders greater indirect contributions (ANJ v ANK at [24]). This is a dual-
income marriage that lasted 31 years and, even though the Wife had the
assistance of a domestic helper, the Husband did not allege that the Wife
delegated all the household responsibilities to the domestic helper.
Nevertheless, the engagement of a domestic helper did reduce the burden of the
Parties’ homemaking and caregiving responsibilities (ANJ v ANK at [27]). This
will be taken into account when assessing the Parties’ indirect contributions.

37 Furthermore, it was undisputed that when the Husband pursued his master’s
degree abroad in 1995, the Wife had to single-handedly manage both her full-
time job and the care of the Children. This is a significant indirect
contribution of the Wife. Moreover, I note that two of the Children are twins.
This means that caring for them would have demanded more from the Wife from
the time they were born as compared to caring for single birth children.

38 Parties also did not dispute that it was the Husband who contributed to the
majority of the household expenses. 28

##### Foot Note 28

Furthermore, the Husband made efforts to take the family out for holidays, and
planned gatherings and parties for the family. 29

and these would have affected the amount of time that he could otherwise
devote to his family.

39 Assessing the evidence, I find that the ratio proposed by the Wife to be
overly generous, and I am of the view that an indirect contribution ratio of
70.0:30.0 between the Wife and the Husband would be just and equitable. I am
guided by the following dual-income long marriage cases:

(a) In TPY v TPZ and another appeal [2017] SGHCF 2 (“TPY v TPZ”), the parties
were married for about 13 years, worked full-time and relied on a domestic
helper substantially for homemaking and caregiving. The wife was the main
supervisor of the domestic helper. The court found the ratio of indirect
contributions to be 60:40 in favour of the wife.

(b) In UTJ v UTK [2019] SGHCF 6 (“UTJ v UTK”), the parties were married for 41
years, worked full-time and relied on a domestic helper who was supervised by
the wife. The wife retired in 2004, and parties divorced on May 2015. The
Husband contributed to the bulk of the family expenses. The court found the
ratio of indirect contributions to be 60:40 in favour of the wife.

(c) In UNE v UNF [2018] SGHCF 12 (“UNE v UNF”), the parties were married for
29 years, have two adult children and worked full-time. The wife worked full-
time for around 19 years of the marriage before assuming the role of a
homemaker for the final 10 years. The wife was the main caregiver. The court
found the ratio of indirect contributions to be 75:25 in favour of the wife.

40 The ratio of 70.0:30.0 is in line with the cases above. I have awarded the
Wife a higher indirect contribution ratio of 70% as compared to the 60% found
in both TPY v TPZ and UTJ v UTK because the Wife made a more significant
indirect contribution by single-handedly caring for the Children (including
the twins) while the Husband pursued his master’s degree abroad in 1995. In
UNE v UNF, the court awarded an indirect contribution ratio of 75% to the wife
because she took unpaid leave and relocated with the husband to Canada for a
year for his employment, and also assumed the role of a homemaker for the last
ten years of their marriage (UNE v UNF at [75] and [79]). Since the Wife in
the present case has continued working full-time throughout, it would be
inappropriate to adopt the higher ratio used in UNE v UNF.

Step 3: Average ratio

41 Based on the circumstances of the case, the average ratio of contributions
may be adjusted by giving different weights to direct and indirect
contributions (ANJ v ANK at [27]). Factors affecting the weightage include the
length of the marriage, the size of the matrimonial assets and its
constituents, and the extent and nature of the indirect contributions.

42 The Wife submitted that in the light of the fact that Parties were married
for 31 years with three adult children, and that she had supported the Husband
while he was pursuing his master’s degree abroad, the court should give more
weight towards the Parties’ indirect contributions. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

WWS 13 July 2018 at paras 72-78.

The Husband’s position was that given the Parties’ long marriage, both the
direct and indirect contributions should be given equal weight. 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

HS 24 July 2018 at para 103.

43 The court can calibrate the average ratio in favour of one party if it is
just and equitable to do so (ANJ v ANK at [26]). In long marriages, indirect
contributions tend to feature more prominently, especially where there are
children of the marriage (ANJ v ANK at [27]). I accept the Wife’s submission
that in a long marriage of 31 years with three adult children, the indirect
contributions made by the Parties would have been more pronounced. As stated
by the High Court in UBM v UBN [2017] 4 SLR 921 at [30]:

[I]n a very long marriage where extensive marital co-operation, mutual
emotional support and joint parenting have been carried out, an adjustment to
the final ratio ought to be made to reflect this circumstance … In the case of
long marriages, such assistance and support is very substantial and is
immensurable.

44 In the present case, however, the Wife’s significant indirect contributions
have already been duly recognised by having a higher percentage given to it.
The Husband has also been paying for the mortgages of the Farrer Park and
Pasir Panjang properties since the Parties’ separation, which helped to retain
them in the pool of matrimonial assets for division. I therefore find it just
and equitable to accord equal weight to the Parties’ direct and indirect
contributions.

45 In the result, from the ratios of the direct and indirect contributions, I
arrive at the overall average ratio of 50.0:50.0 between the Husband and the
Wife based on the computations in the table below:

| Husband (%)| Wife (%)  
---|---|---  
Direct Contributions| 70.0| 30.0  
Indirect Contributions| 30.0| 70.0  
Average ratio| 50.0| 50.0  
  
46 Based on the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets being
$3,875,157.78 (see [24] above), both the Husband and the Wife’s 50% share of
the matrimonial assets is $1,937,578.89 each.

Apportionment of the matrimonial assets

47 The Wife submitted that since she is staying in the Bishan Property with
the Children, the Bishan Property should be transferred to her with no
consideration. 33

##### Foot Note 33

NE dated 10 September 2018 at p 3.

48 Having the Parties retain the respective properties that they are staying
in and the assets in their sole names is a sensible way to divide the
matrimonial assets. Since the Husband has agreed that the Wife should retain
the Bishan Property, I order that the Husband is to take steps to transfer it
to her within three months of this judgment.

49 To minimise the transaction costs necessitated by any transfer ordered, I
further order that the Wife is to retain the assets in her sole name.

50 Accordingly, the Wife is to retain the following assets:

S/No| Description| Agreed value ($)  
---|---|---  
|  Wife’s Assets  
1\. | POSB Passbook Savings Account No ending with 7339| 9,019.78  
2\. | POSB MySavings Account No ending with 2386| 3,353.88  
3\. | Maybank Savings Account No ending with 5704| 112,603.41  
4\. | Prudential Insurance Policy No ending with 3711| 22,413.19  
5\. | Bayswater Fiduciary Services Investment| 13,200.00  
6\. | Central Depository Account| 41,882.41  
7\. | Central Provident Fund Account| 264,021.11  
8\. | Hatten (Harbour City Resort)| 16,152.93  
9\. | AVIVA MyWhole LifePlan Policy No ending with 6349| 4,834.50  
10\. | Bishan Property| 822,689.48  
| Total| 1,310,170.69  
  
51 The Wife is therefore entitled to another sum of $627,408.20 (being
$1,937,578.89 - $1,310,170.69) from the pool of matrimonial assets.

52 Again, to minimise the transaction costs, I order that the Husband is to
retain the assets in his sole name as follows:

S/No| Description| Agreed value ($)  
---|---|---  
|  Husband’s Assets  
1\. | POSB Account No ending with 7176 | 7,130.09  
2\. | POSB Account No ending with 5950| 12,493.38  
3\. | DBS Multiplier Account No ending with 0930| 3,114.66  
4\. | UOB Investments Account No ending with 7853| 7,883.00  
5\. | Central Depository Account| 8,661.10  
6\. | Central Provident Fund Account| 383,202.93  
7\. | Standard Chartered Mortgage One Current Account No ending with 7113| 73,115.66  
8\. | Standard Chartered Bonus Saver Account No ending with 8677| 6,166.08  
9\. | UOB CashPlus Statement Account No ending with 1980| 5,740.94  
10\. | Citibank Maxisave Account No ending with 2007 and Unfixed Time Deposits No ending with 0612| 30,092.52  
11\. | NatWest Account| 4,132.77  
12.| Fidelity Investments Account| 397,910.36  
13.| Car (sold 31 July 2017)| 65,630.00  
14.| AXA Inspire Policy No ending with 4592| 19,244.73  
15.| PruLink Capital Account| 8,932.80  
16.| UOB SRS Fixed Deposit Account| 83,721.20  
| Total| 1,117,172.22  
  
53 Since both Parties want the Farrer Park Property and there is no agreement
on how the Pasir Panjang Property is to be dealt with, they will have to
decide how these two properties and the balances in the joint bank accounts
(see S/No 1 to 3 of [10] above) are to be divided, so that each will receive
their respective shares of the total matrimonial asset pool that is valued at
$3,875,157.78 (see [24] above). This may involve the use of assets in their
sole names, if required. If Parties are unable to agree, they will have
liberty to apply within three months of this judgment on how the Parties are
to achieve their shares.

54 As I have pointed out in [22] above, there was no updated formal valuation
of the three properties as at August 2018. I have therefore used the Wife’s
net values of these properties, which are derived from the gross values
obtained by her using the website “www.srx.com”, to arrive at the total value
of the pool of matrimonial assets set out in [24] above. If Parties are unable
to agree on the valuations, they will also have liberty to apply within three
months of this judgment to appoint a joint valuer to provide the gross values
of the three properties as at August 2018, and thereafter to review the total
value of the pool of matrimonial assets as a result of the new valuations. The
amounts that they receive under their respective shares (see [46] above),
which were determined using their direct and indirect contributions and
independent of the values of the three properties, would then be adjusted
accordingly.

Maintenance for the Wife

The legal principles

55 The court has the power to order the Husband to pay maintenance to the Wife
pursuant to s 113 of the WC, after taking into account the non-exhaustive
factors listed under s 114 of the WC. The purpose of an order for maintenance
is to place the Wife in the financial position which she would have been had
the marriage not broken down (s 114(2) of the WC). This is noted by the Court
of Appeal in Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow [2012] 2 SLR 506 at [13]:

… The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) of the Act is that of
financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a
standard, which is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of
living she had enjoyed during the marriage …

56 Further, maintenance plays only a supplementary role to an order for
division of matrimonial assets, and the court will take into account the
Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets upon division before deriving at an
appropriate maintenance sum: BG v BF [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [75]; and ATE v
ATD and another appeal [2016] SGCA 2 at [33].

The needs of the Wife

57 The Wife stated that her total expenses per month amounted to $6,261.33,
and that the Husband had been contributing $2,350 per month towards a general
fund for “property taxes, conservancy charges, utility bills and other
miscellaneous household expenses”, before eventually reducing it to $500 when
their marriage broke down. 37

##### Foot Note 37

WWS 13 July 2018 at paras 88-104.

The Wife submitted that she should be awarded a lump sum maintenance of
$120,000 ($2,000 per month multiplied by five years) or in the alternative,
$2,000 per month. 38

##### Foot Note 38

×

WWS 13 July 2018 at para 105; JSRI-3 at p 3.

The Husband disagreed and submitted that the Wife’s earnings are more than
sufficient to maintain herself, and that her expenses are inflated as it
includes the Children’s expenses. 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

HS 24 July 2018 at paras 96-98.

58 In the present case, the Wife will receive a total of $1,937,578.89 (unless
revised after revaluation of the three matrimonial properties) as her share of
the matrimonial assets. She is also currently working full-time, and earns a
monthly salary of $5,697.20. I note though that she is already 59 years old
this year. On the other hand, the Husband, who is younger at 57, earns a
monthly salary of $20,179.75 (at [1] above).

59 In my view, while the amount of assets that the Wife will receive is
substantial, with a significant part of it in liquid form, it remains fair
that the Wife should be given a sum of maintenance. In so deciding, I have
taken into consideration that this was a 31-year old marriage, the role of the
Wife in bringing up the Children, the number of working years left before she
reaches retirement age, and the four times greater earning power of the
Husband. The maintenance will be for a period of five years. And while the
Husband used to contribute $2,350 per month towards household expenses, it
included payments for the upkeep of the Bishan Property, 40

##### Foot Note 40

and would have benefited the Children too. A reasonable amount for the Wife’s
maintenance would therefore be $1,000 per month.

The ability of the Husband to pay

60 The Husbands earns approximately $20,179.75 per month (see [1] above).
While he claimed that his monthly expenses totalled $20,543.15, 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

WWS dated 13 July 2018, at para 103(i) and (ii).

he had included items which were disputed by the Wife (eg, payments for the
upkeep of the Bishan Property which the Wife said was only $500 per month, and
SRS contributions which are in the nature of savings), items where the amount
appeared excessive (eg, utility and broadband bills of $1,000 per month for
the Pasir Panjang Property), and mortgage payments for the Farrer Park and
Pasir Panjang properties (which will be substantially reduced after the
division of the matrimonial assets). He is therefore well able to afford to
pay maintenance of $1,000 per month to the Wife.

The maintenance amount ordered

61 However, to achieve a clean break, since the Husband also has substantial
liquid assets after division of the pool of matrimonial assets, I order that
the Husband pays to the Wife the maintenance amount as a lump sum of $60,000
(being $1,000 per month x 5 years) within three months of this judgment.

Costs

62 I encourage Parties to agree on the issue of costs, including the option of
each party bearing its own costs. If there is no agreement, they are to file
and exchange submissions on the issue of costs (limited to ten pages each)
within 21 days from the date of this judgment.
