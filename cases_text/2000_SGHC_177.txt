>
> This action was then commenced by the plaintiffs in 2000. In the statement

**Held** , dismissing the plaintiffs’ action with costs:

(1) There was no merit in the plaintiffs’ claim relating to the 350 shares
belonging to Ng Siew Hoon as the evidence showed that those shares were never
transferred to the second defendant but were actually sold to Ng Siew Mui (see
41).

(2) The defendants did not obtain the dismissal of the OS by fraud. Firstly,
the first defendant finally disposed of all the Johore properties only in
December 1995. This was five years after the second defendant had purchased
the NQL shares while the assessment of capital gains tax by the Malaysian tax
authorities was only made nine years later in mid-1999. Secondly, the concern
of the second defendant in the OS proceedings was only with the financial
status of the first defendant as at 26 December 1990, not subsequent dates and
events. Although the purchase by the second defendant of the NQL shares proved
to be at a bargain price, the court is not concerned here with hindsight.
Thirdly, it could not be said that the second defendant had deliberately
concealed the property sales and profits generated therefrom from the third
plaintiff when she had nothing to do with the running of the company which she
left to the directors and her sister. Fourthly, although the accounts relied
upon by the second defendant were qualified, there were no other accounts or
means whereby she could assess the first defendant’s share value in 1990. The
court did not form the impression that the second defendant knew very much
about or was interested in the first defendant, let alone its financial
position. Fifthly, after taking into account all the assets and liabilities of
the company, the net value of each share would be a negative figure (see 49 –
54).

(3) The plaintiffs having failed on their claim based on fraud, they cannot
take advantage of the extended time limit provided under s 29 of the
Limitation Act. Accordingly, the time-bar under s 6(1)(a) of the Act would
apply since more than six years have lapsed from the date of the transfer of
the NQL shares in 26 December 1990 (see 54).

(4) A plain reading of article 25 in the first defendant’s articles of
association does not support the plaintiffs’ contention that existing
shareholders have a pre-emptive right to shares being offered for sale. In any
case, the prohibition against transferring shares to a non-member if a member
was willing to buy would not apply to the second defendant because she was
already an existing shareholder of the first defendant when the NQL shares
were offered for sale (see 55-56); _Delavenne v Broadhurst_ [1931] 1 Ch 234,
_Greenhalgh v Mallard_ [1943] 2 All ER 234 followed.

(5) It is trite law that for a judicial decision to operate as a res judicata,
it must be final, the parties to the action and the issue must be the same in
both actions and the issue was necessary or fundamental to the earlier
decision reached instead of being merely a collateral matter. However even if
the outcome of a prior decision amounted to res judicata, evidence of fraud
would vitiate the estoppel. Such fraud included every variety of mala fides
and mala praxis whereby a party deceives the judicial tribunal. In order to
succeed the third plaintiff would have to show that he had come into
possession of fresh facts or evidence which shows conclusively that the
previous decision was wrong or must be likely to be decisive or, evidence such
as entirely changes the aspect of the case (see 60-61).

(6) On the facts, the alleged fresh evidence pertaining to the actual realised
values of the first defendant’s Malaysian properties were not events which
took place in 1990 but in 1995. Since there was no fraudulent conduct on the
part of the second defendant, the decision in the OS cannot be impugned and
consequently, the principle of res judicata would apply to preclude the third
plaintiff from making the same claim against her (see 61-62).

(7) While the first and second plaintiffs are not estopped from raising afresh
the issue that the shares were transferred to the second defendant by the
first defendant at an undervalue, that still did not advance their case any
further as the court had not found such an undervalue (see 62).

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

_The facts_

1\. The plaintiffs in this case are actually one person who is wearing three
(3) hats: firstly, as the trustee for two bankrupt individuals (first and
second plaintiffs) and secondly as the liquidator for a company (the third
plaintiff). Ng Eng Kiat (NEK) was adjudged a bankrupt in 1988 while Ng Siew
Hoon was made a bankrupt on 30 October 1992. Ng Quee Lam Pte Ltd (NQL) was
incorporated on 14 June 1960 by one Ng Quee Lam; it was compulsorily wound up
by its judgment creditor United Malayan Banking Corporation on 6 September
1991. According to documents produced in court, NQL's misfortunes arose from
its role as guarantor for banking facilities granted to Ng Quee Lam's flagship
company South Union Company Private Limited (South Union) which itself was a
victim of and was wound up during, the 1986-87 recession. Ng Siew Hoon and the
second defendant are daughters of Ng Quee Lam. Although it was not adduced in
evidence, I believe NEK is the nephew of Ng Quee Lam as Ng Quee Lam's son is
named Ng Eng Chan suggesting he and NEK came from the same generation of the
extended Ng family.

2\. The first defendant is a company incorporated in Malaysia on 29 September
1960; it owns rubber estates as well as other properties and is also a
developer. The company is registered in Singapore as a branch of a foreign
company. The second defendant was at all material times a shareholder of the
first defendant; originally she held 2,500 shares. NQL and Ng Siew Hoon were
also shareholders. As at the dates of their respective bankruptcies, Ng Eng
Kiat and Ng Siew Hoon held 41,112 (the NEK shares) and 350 shares respectively
in the first defendant while NQL held 42,900 shares (the NQL shares) as at the
date of its liquidation. I note in the letter dated 20 July 1999 to the
Official Assignee from the first defendant's solicitors, that Ng Siew Hoon
held the 350 shares as a nominee for NQL. Another shareholder of the first
defendant is Excelux Pte Ltd (Excelux), a company belonging to the family of
Ng Kwee Teng @ Ng Quee Teng (NKT) who is the older brother of Ng Quee Lam. Ng
Quee Lam and NKT were also adjudged bankrupts on 21 October 1988 (together
with NEK) at which time NKT held 5,000 shares in the first defendant. Both NKT
and NEK were directors of the first defendant. In late 1990 and early 1991,
prior to its own liquidation, NQL offered to buy the NEK shares from the first
plaintiff as well as the 5,000 shares of NKT at RM2 each but withdrew the
offer in March 1991.

3\. On 9 and 11 November 1991, the first plaintiff gave notice to the first
defendant's secretary that he intended to dispose of the NEK shares as well as
the 5,000 shares belonging to NKT at a minimum price of RM2 per share; he
invited interested parties to submit offers by 30 November 1991. Through their
solicitors, Excelux offered RM2.60 per share which offer the first plaintiff
accepted in early December 1991, subject to contract. However the first
plaintiff was unable to effect the transfer of both lots of shares to Excelux
as he had to arrange for NEK and NKT to affirm statutory declarations to the
effect that the relevant share certificates were lost or misplaced. However
before the first plaintiff could effect the transfer of the shares to Excelux,
the first defendant made a demand on NEK in January 1992 for the sum of
S$32,992.60 he purportedly owed the company. The first defendant gave notice
that if the debt was not paid, it would sell the NEK shares in exercise of its
lien under article 13 of its articles of association. NEK denied owing the
debt and the first defendant's proof of debt lodged subsequently in that
regard was rejected by the first plaintiff against whose decision the first
defendant did not appeal.

4\. In October 1993 the first plaintiff discovered that NEK was no longer the
owner of the NEK shares as the shares had earlier been transferred by the
first defendant to the second defendant, her brother Ng Eng Chan and her
sister Ng Siew Mui. These transfers became the subject of Suit No. 996 of 1999
(the Suit) wherein the first plaintiff sued the second defendant as well as
her two siblings and the first defendant for the return of the NEK shares on
the ground that the purported transfers were void. On 29 October 1999 when the
Suit came on for trial, the second defendant and her two siblings agreed to
transfer the shares back to NEK free from encumbrances. The Suit was stayed
except for the purpose of carrying out the terms agreed between the parties.

5\. As for the NQL shares, the third plaintiff ascertained from a search
conducted on the first defendant in the Malaysian registry of companies in
November 1992, that those shares had been transferred to the second defendant.
The first plaintiff complained that he did not receive notice of the sale of
these shares (which apparently took place on 26 December 1990) in
contravention of article 25(B),(C) and (D) of the articles of association of
the first defendant. The first and third plaintiffs also discovered from
documents in NQL's files that the second defendant paid RM0.10 for those
shares even though NQL had itself offered to purchase the NEK shares and those
belonging to NKT from the first plaintiff at RM2 each in December 1990. Prior
to the transfer of the NEK and NQL shares, NEK held 25% of the shareholdings
in the first defendant while NQL held 26%.

6\. In December 1995, the third plaintiff instituted proceedings against the
second defendant in Originating Summons No. 1193 of 1995 (the OS) to recover
the NQL shares on the basis that the shares had been sold to her at an
undervalue to their true market value. The second defendant resisted the
action and in an affidavit filed on 16 January 1996, she deposed that she had
_'directed'_ the first defendant to obtain valuation reports. The two (2)
valuation reports one from public accountants Casey Lin & Company (Casey Lin)
and the other from the company's auditors C H Teo & Co stated that the shares
were valueless or unlikely to be worth RM0.01 or at all; indeed the auditors
went further to say that the net asset backing per share was a negative figure
of minus RM33.49. Based on the second defendant's affidavit, the court
dismissed the OS. The third plaintiff, on his lawyers' advice, did not appeal
against the dismissal.

7\. On 19 November 1999, pursuant to one of the terms of settlement between
the first plaintiff and the defendants in the Suit, the solicitors for the
first defendant forwarded to the plaintiffs' solicitors copies of two (2)
letters dated 22 May and 19 June 1999 from the Malaysian tax authorities
setting out the computation of real property gains tax on land belonging to
the first defendant which had been sold. The first defendant disposed of
certain pieces of land situated in the district of Tebrau in Johore at
RM54,932,000 while another piece of land in Johore was sold for RM100,000,000;
the total profits made by the first defendant less the original purchase
prices were RM153,925,873.

8\. Besides the two letters, the plaintiffs were also given a supplementary
agreement dated 15 December 1994 (the supplementary agreement) between the
first defendant and Laksamana Realty Sdn Bhd (Laksamana) relating to land
situated at lot 51 town area XXXVI in Malacca state belonging to the first
defendant. The supplementary agreement referred to an earlier agreement
between the parties dated 16 November 1993 (the earlier agreement). In that
earlier agreement (see 1AB144) the first defendant had agreed to sell to
Laksamana lot 51 for RM1.75m and it was paid a deposit of RM175,000 upon
signing. By the supplementary agreement (see 1AB169) Laksamana agreed to pay
the balance sum of RM1.575m to purchase lot 51 and a further sum of RM200,000
for three (3) other pieces of land situated at lots 43, 44 and 46 town area
IX. A recital in the supplementary agreement also referred to an earlier
agreement dated 9 June 1990 between Chay Eng Huat (Melaka) Sdn Bhd (CEH) and
Ally Azran Holdings Sdn Bhd (AA) wherein CEH agreed to sell the same piece of
land to AA for RM2.3m. Lot 51 had been valued by CH Williams Talhar & Wong Sdn
Bhd (CH Williams) at RM1.37m as at 1 January 1988. Lots 43, 44 and 46 had been
valued collectively at RM165,000. Both valuations were adopted by Casey Lin
and used by the second defendant in resisting the OS. Casey Lin had assumed
there were no material changes in the value of the lots between 1 January 1988
and 26 December 1990. Neither did CH Williams mention the various other
transactions pertaining to lot 51. The plaintiffs were of the view that lot 51
had been undervalued by Casey Lin by at least RM930,000 (RM2.3m -1.37m) based
on the transactions reflected in the supplementary agreement.

9\. As for Ng Siew Hoon, she had completed a questionnaire of the second
plaintiff on 23 February 1993 stating she owned 350 shares in the first
defendant. On 29 March 1993 she affirmed an affidavit for the second plaintiff
stating she had sold her 350 shares on 28 September 1992. On 28 July 1994, Ng
Siew Hoon affirmed a statutory declaration wherein she declared she had not
been paid for those shares. On seeing the statutory declaration, the second
plaintiff realised that the transfer of her shares was absolutely void as a
voluntary settlement under s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act Cap 20 as it took place
after the date she committed her act of bankruptcy (31 July 1992); under s 46
of the Bankruptcy Act, Ng Siew Hoon had no legal capacity to make the
transfer. The first and third plaintiffs also complained that they were not
given notice of the sale and transfer, contrary to articles 25(B) (C) and (D)
of the first defendant and, they only learnt of it on 29 March 1993.

10\. After these proceedings had commenced and in the course of discovery, the
first defendant disclosed to the plaintiffs that the 350 shares of Ng Siew
Hoon were transferred to her sister Ng Siew Mui on 25 July 1992 for a
consideration of RM350 which transfer was duly approved on 28 July 1992 by the
first defendant's board of directors.

_The claim_

11\. In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants
breached article 25 of the first defendant which gave all shareholders in the
first defendant a pre-emptive right in relation to shares which are to be
sold. The plaintiffs alleged that the third plaintiff did not give notice in
writing of its intention to sell the NQL shares, yet the first defendant sold
those shares and did not offer them to the first and third plaintiffs who were
the other shareholders and, which act the second defendant knew was a breach
of article 25.

12\. The third plaintiff further alleged that the second defendant had, in the
OS proceedings made false statements in her affidavit filed on 16 January 1996
when she stated:

> > a. as at 31 December 1990, shares in the first defendant were either
> valueless or unlikely to be worth even RM0.01 per share.
>>

>> b. pre-emption rights under the articles only applied to sales to non
members of the first defendant.

as she well knew that the shares in the first defendant were not worthless.
The third plaintiff asserted that she knew that the accounts audited by C H
Teo & Co could not be relied upon as they qualified their accounts by stating
in their report that the accounts 'do not give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs as at 31 December 1990'. The second defendant also knew that
the valuation done by Casey Lin & Co did not take into account the value of
the first defendant's shareholding in President Emporium Pte Ltd. The third
plaintiff alleged that by her aforesaid false statements, the second defendant
obtained the dismissal of the OS on 25 March 1996.

13\. The plaintiffs repeated the complaint that they were deprived of their
pre-emptive rights for the 350 shares of Ng Siew Hoon which they alleged were
also transferred to the second defendant for no consideration thereby
contravening s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act.

14\. The plaintiffs prayed inter alia for the following orders:

> > a. to set aside the judgment in the OS;

> > b. to set aside the transfers to the second defendant of the NQL and Ng
> Siew Hoon shares coupled with a declaration that those shares remained
> vested in the third and second plaintiffs respectively;
>>

>> c. that the books of the first defendant be amended to reflect the third
and second plaintiffs' ownership of those shares;

>>

>> d. in the alternative for damages to be assessed.

15\. In the common defence filed by the defendants, they denied that the
articles of the first defendant created any right of pre-emption for a sale of
shares by a retiring member to an existing member of the company or, that the
articles required the first defendant to give notice of an intended sale of
shares to existing members. However, the defendants asserted, NQL did give
notice of the sale of the NQL shares by its letter dated 26 December 1990. The
defendants further denied that the third plaintiff at any time owned the NQL
shares which were transferred to the second defendant on 26 December 1990.

16\. The second defendant on her part denied that she had knowingly made false
statements in her affidavit filed for the OS. She asserted that the sale to
her of the NQL shares was at an arms length carried out on a 'willing seller
willing buyer' basis. She denied that the 350 shares of Ng Siew Hoon were
transferred to her. The second defendant averred that the plaintiffs' claim in
any case was time-barred under s 6(1) and (2) of the Limitation Act Cap 163
(the Limitation Act) and was precluded/estopped by the doctrines of laches and
acquiescence. In the alternative, the second defendant relied on the order of
court made on 25 March 1996 in the OS as constituting an estoppel per rem
judicatum or as an issue estoppel against the third plaintiff or, in the
further alternative, as a binding judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction against which no attack should be made.

17\. In the Reply, the plaintiffs alleged that their rights had been concealed
by fraud on the part of the defendants. They relied on s 29(1)(a) and (b) of
the Limitation Act and contended that the defendants could not rely on the
proviso to that section as the second defendant was a party to the fraud at
the time she purchased the shares as she knew or had reason to believe that a
fraud was being committed because:

> > a. she knew that the procedures laid out in articles 25(B)(C) and (D) for
> the sale of the shares had not been followed;
>>

>> b. she knew that NQL was insolvent or likely to be insolvent and therefore
go into liquidation;

>>

>> c. she knew that the shares were worth substantially more than the price
she paid.

18\. As for the NQL shares, the plaintiffs alleged that they only became aware
of the transfer to the second defendant on or about 19 November 1999 when they
received the two notices from the Malaysian tax authorities; alternatively on
or about 13 August 1999 when the second defendant filed her defence in the
Suit. As for the 350 shares of Ng Siew Hoon, the plaintiffs said their right
of action was only discovered on or about 28 July 1994 when Ng Siew Hoon filed
her statutory declaration. The defendants could not rely on the proviso to s
29 of the Limitation Act because the second defendant gave no valuable
consideration for those shares. the plaintiffs repeated their allegation of
fraud as regards the 350 shares.

_The evidence_

_(i) the plaintiffs' case_

19\. I have, in the preceding paras 1 to 10, set out in essence the written
testimony of the plaintiffs' case officer Wang Wang Chew (Wang). I now turn to
evidence adduced from him under cross-examination. Wang (PW2) explained that
the plaintiffs were not in possession of the 1990 audited accounts of the
first defendant for the OS hearing. Further, although his office had written
to NQL's company secretaries in January 1993 for clarification and
confirmation on the change in shareholdings, there was no reply. Wang
testified that the plaintiffs thought it strange that the second defendant and
other shareholders had offered to purchase shares in the first defendant at
more than RM2 per share in December 1990 before NQL was wound up even though
the shares were said to be valueless in 1990. That fact made the plaintiffs
suspicious of the two (2) transfers of shares to the second defendant. He also
thought the second defendant may have some influence on the affairs of the
first defendant by her use of the word '_directed'_ (para 3 supra) in her
affidavit filed to resist the OS. However all this was not raised in the
affidavit filed by the Official Assignee's then legal officer for the OS
proceedings for reasons unknown to him.

20\. Wang testified that although the third plaintiff knew before the OS
proceedings that the first defendant owned substantial properties in West
Malaysia, the plaintiffs were unaware of the details and their actual values
until they saw the 1999 notices from the Malaysian tax authorities. In any
case, at the hearing of the OS, the valuation reports produced by the second
defendant only related to certain not all, the properties owned by the second
defendant. This surmise however, proved to be incorrect on further questioning
by counsel. Wang explained that the third plaintiff was in no position to
refute the valuations in any event as, the first defendants' properties were
not situated in Singapore; otherwise his office would have enlisted the
assistance of the Chief Valuer to obtain comparative valuations.

21\. Wang also revealed that the OS proceedings had been funded by Excelux who
were similarly funding this litigation; there were no assets realised by the
third plaintiff from NQL since its liquidation. Pressed why in that case, the
third plaintiff did not request Excelux to pay the costs of obtaining
comparative valuations of the first defendant's properties, Wang said it did
not occur to his office to do so before the hearing of the OS. Moreover, the
third plaintiff believed what the second defendant said in her affidavit –
that the shares had no value at the relevant time. Unlike the second defendant
and other shareholders or directors, the third plaintiff was a stranger to the
first defendant and had no access to its documents. He could not verify what
the second defendant claimed. Presumably the court must also have believed
that the shares were valueless as the OS was dismissed. Wang explained that
the first plaintiff was not involved in the OS because, until NEK's status as
a shareholder was restored by order of court in the Suit last October, NEK was
not a member of the first defendant when the third plaintiff commenced the OS
proceedings.

22\. To support their contention that the first defendant's properties as at
26 December 1990 were worth more than their assessments by the company's
valuers, the plaintiffs obtained valuations from (Johore) valuers Param &
Associates which showed that (as at December 1990) the Johore properties were
worth RM28,661,000 (as against the first defendants' valuation of
RM16,145,000) while the six (6) Malacca properties were worth a total of
RM2,250,000 (as against the first defendant's valuation of RM1,615,000).

23\. Sivadas Velayudhan (Sivadas), the manager of Param & Associates,
testified that he prepared the valuations using a comparable sales method.
Sivadas (PW3) was cross-examined at length on his valuations; counsel for the
defendants suggested that he had not used the most suitable comparables in
arriving at his valuations for both the Johore and Malacca properties as,
Sivadas either largely ignored or gave little weight to sales at lower values.
Sivadas countered by pointing out that he had taken into account and made the
appropriate adjustments for, drainage reserves/streams, electrical pylons and
lack of access as minus factors while road access or future/imminent road
access were treated as plus factors. Further, until informed by counsel for
the defendants, Sivadas was unaware that lots 38 and 120 in Malacca had been
sold in August 1990 for RM148,000 which sale proceeds accordingly needed to be
deducted from his valuation figure of RM2.25m.

24\. Sivadas had valued on the basis that the plots of land were free from
encumbrances and with vacant possession even though some plots did not have
clean titles. The encumbrances included a judgment debt obtained by Indian
Overseas Bank (IOB) against a company called Mercator Pte Ltd (see 2AB88) of
which the first defendant was the guarantor (to the limit of S$2.8m) and for
which the first defendant had given a third party charge to IOB over lots 2051
and 2058 Mukim of Tebrau, Johore. There was also a caveat lodged by United
Overseas Bank (UOB) against lot 2051 while private caveats were entered by an
individual Yeo Yang Poh against lots 2069, 2070, 2075 and 2076. In addition,
although the 8 plots of Johore land were zoned for industrial use, they had
yet to be converted as at 26 December 1990. Indeed, when Sivadas visited the
plots on 7 April 1999, he found that some plots were still being used as
agricultural land for the cultivation of vegetables while others were left
vacant.

25\. The plaintiffs also called the audit manager from Robert Yam & Co namely
Lim Min Kwong (Lim) to testify. Lim (PW4) was tasked with ascertaining the
value of the shares of the first defendant and its Singapore subsidiary Heap
Huat Rubber Company Pte Ltd (the subsidiary company). For purposes of his
valuation, Lim relied on the information given in:

> > a. the audited consolidated accounts of the first defendant and the
> subsidiary company;

> > b. the valuation reports of Param & Associates;
>>

>> c. the share valuation report of Casey Lim.

Lim adopted the net asset value method as the basis for his valuation and
arrived at a figure of RM56 per share.

26\. Cross-examined on why he had not taken into account the outstanding tax
liabilities in his valuation, Lim said it was because he did not value the
first defendant's assets on a break-up basis but on the basis that the company
was a going concern. Further, as the properties were not sold, no tax
liability should be taken into consideration. He pointed out that it was
difficult for a property based company like the first defendant to be valued
on an earnings basis, hence he took a net asset value approach.

27\. After he had completed cross-examining Sivadas and Lim, counsel for the
defendants produced a computation (see 2AB202) he had prepared which was
premised on the valuations of Param & Associates being accurate but which
factored in property gains tax, encumbrances on the various plots of land and
Singapore income tax liability; he arrived at a negative figure of -RM21.09
per share value. The computation is as follows:-

> > **A** | **Johore properties** | RM28,661,000  
>> ---|---|---  
>> **Less:** |  |   
>> (i) |  real property gains tax  
>  (28,661,000-1,006,127 [cost]) @ 5% | 1,382,743.65  
>> (ii) |  sum owed to IOB as guarantor for judgment debt of Mercator Pte Ltd of S$2m @ RM$1.557 to S$1.00 | 4,359,600.00  
>> (iii) |  Outstanding Singapore income tax of S$4,327,836.22 for Y/A 1986-91 not taken into account @ RM1.557 to S$1.00 as at 32.12.90 | _6,738,441.00 12,480,784.65  
>  _ 16,180,215.35

>> **B** | **Malacca properties** | 2,250,000.00  
>> **Less:** |  |   
>> (i) | sale on 14.8.90 of lots 38 and 120 town area XVI | 148,000

>  _ 2,004,859.95  
>> |  |   
>> **C** | Total net valuations **A + B** =16,180,215.35 + 2,004,859.95 = RM18,185,075.30

>> Less: |  Excess of liability over assets as per accounts as at 31.12.90 | (16,962,024.00)  
>> Deficiency of assets over liabilities | ( 3,469,578.70)  
>> Therefore value per share = _(RM3,469,578.70_) = – RM21.09 per share  
>  164,500  
  
28\. The plaintiffs also called Ng Siew Hoon (PW1) to testify; she confirmed
what had been stated in her statutory declaration (affirmed on 28 July 1994).
She recalled that a share transfer form was brought to her father's house and
it was already filled out when she signed. She could not remember the name of
the transferee as she signed the form some ten (10) years ago. She disclosed
that she worked for the first defendant for the whole of 1999 for which she
received a salary, for assisting the company to draft letters in English and
to give input at meetings.

_(ii) the first defendants' case_

29\. I next turn to the first defendant's case. The company's only witness was
their director and employee Ng Puay Khoon (Ng). Ng (DW1) was also a director
of NQL which company (together with South Union) he first worked for (in March
1970); he was the author of the letters of offer from NQL to the Official
Assignee for the NEK shares in 1990. Ng became a director of the first
defendant in 1990.

30\. Ng disputed the plaintiffs' allegations; he contended that the pre-
emptive rights under article 25(B) of the first defendant only applied when
there is a proposed sale of shares in the first defendant to non-members.
Where one member wished to sell to another member, that article had no
application. Hence no notice needed to be given to other members in respect of
the sale of NQL shares to the second defendant since both NQL and the second
defendant were members of the company. Further, the second defendant gave
valuable consideration for those shares. The first defendant had therefore
complied with all necessary procedures and that was why the court dismissed
the OS proceedings.

31\. Cross-examined, Ng explained that the first defendant had a housing
development project located at Choa Chu Kang, Singapore (the project). In the
company's 1990 audited accounts, a sum of RM46,466,852 was recognised as
revenue from that project. Arising from that revenue, the Singapore inland
revenue authorities assessed tax @ 31% amounting to S$609,556.10. Ng revealed
that the project was mortgaged to UOB together with lot 241 at Pulai in
Johore. UOB had obtained summary judgment against the company in 1992 in the
Johore Baru court for the sum of S$26,889,986.44. UOB had also applied to the
Johore court to auction the 7 lots of land at Tebrau. Hence, when the 7 Tebrau
lots and lot 241 at Pulai were sold, the sale and purchase agreements both
dated 29 December 1995 stipulated that the purchasers were required to obtain
UOB's consent to the sales as well as resolve UOB's outstanding claims.

32\. UOB had, in the exercise of its rights as mortgagees pursuant to the
power of attorney contained in the mortgage instrument, taken over the project
account. As such Ng said, neither the first defendant nor its auditors were
able to verify the revenue and the expenses charged to the project by UOB as
the Bank did not provide sufficient details in their bank statements. Hence
the 1990 audited accounts qualified the revenue as well as expense figures
relating to the project. He testified that the first defendant did not make a
profit on the project but tax on alleged profits were levied by the inland
revenue authorities which tax to date had not been settled.

33\. Ng was questioned on his letter to the Official Assignee (written on
behalf of NQL) dated 15 December 1990 offering to buy the NEK shares as well
as the 5,000 shares belonging to NKT at RM0.50 each. Yet, eleven (11) days
later on 26 December 1990, he had written to the first defendant's directors
on behalf of NQL offering to sell the NQL shares at RM0.10 each. Ng explained
that the second letter to the first defendant's directors was his idea which
was intended to raise money for NQL as the company was also in financial
difficulties at the time. His offer price of RM0.10 per share was based on the
accounts of the first defendant and the position the company was then facing.
Ng revealed that his letter to the first defendant was never sent out because
on the date itself of the letter (26 December 1990) NQL found an immediate
buyer for the shares in the second defendant. He and Madam Keh Soh Guat (wife
of Ng Quee Lam and mother of the second defendant) the then two directors of
NQL passed the necessary resolution on the same day approving the sale to the
second defendant. Apart from the immediate family members of Ng Quee Lam, Ng
said no other shareholders of the first defendant (including the first and
second plaintiffs) were informed of the sale.

34\. Ng explained that had he succeeded in purchasing the NEK shares and those
of NKT from the Official Assignee, he would have distributed and sold them
proportionally to the existing shareholders of the first defendant including
Excelux, hopefully at the same price. His offer of RM0.50 per share was made
without considering the value of the shares as it was prompted by the desire
of the members of Ng Quee Lam's family to retain the shares within the family
'for sentimental reasons'. Ng described his offer of RM0.50 a share as a
'mistake' by NQL as it meant they would be out-of-pocket in selling at RM0.10
a share and buying from the Official Assignee at RM0.50 a share. Hence NQL
withdrew its offer subsequently. He denied that the sale to the second
defendant at RM0.10 per share was at an undervalue as, it was based on the
auditors' opinion that the shares were valueless. Ng also denied that Ng Quee
Lam or members of his family controlled the first defendant's board of
directors but, he acknowledged that he represented the interests of NQL on the
board.

35\. Ng admitted that on 22 April 1992 he had signed a director's resolution
of the first defendant resolving to sell the NEK shares (pursuant to the
company's lien) to the second defendant and her three siblings at RM2.65 per
share. He denied that the move was to keep the shares out of the hands of
Excelux and members of NKT's family although he was aware that in late
November 1991, the Official Assignee had agreed to sell the same shares to
Excelux at RM2.60 per share. Ng's attention was also drawn to a letter dated
18 December 1991 from a Johor Baru law firm Abdullah Rahman & Co to the
Official Assignee which stated that the firm's clients (members of Ng Quee
Lam's family) offered RM3.00 per share to buy the NEK shares as well as those
of NKT. In December 1990, he did not know the shareholders of the first
defendant were divided into two (2) factions who were seeking to control the
company; he only became aware of the rivalry between the families of Ng Quee
Lam and NKT after 1995. To counsel's question whether he considered himself a
member of the Ng Quee Lam faction, Ng's answer was _'it all depends'_. As the
Official Assignee had offered to sell the NEK shares at RM2.60 per share, Ng
said the directors of the first defendant decided to add RM0.05 to that figure
as their asking price. However, he did not know whether the directors' asking
price reflected the true value of the shares as NQL did not obtain a valuation
in December 1990.

36\. Ng agreed he had previously acted as the second defendant's proxy at
annual general meetings of the first defendant. Further, it was on her
instructions that he obtained a valuation report from the auditors CH Teo on
the value of the first defendant's shares, which copy he handed to her. He
admitted he was pleased when the sales of the first defendant's Johore
properties were completed in 1997 since the proceeds turned the company around
and gave a value to its shares (provided there was no tax liability). He had
told the second defendant about the sale agreements although he could not
recall when. Neither could Ng recall whether he had informed the Official
Assignee about the same. As for the first defendant's delay in issuing new
share certificates to the Official Receiver on behalf of another shareholder
Ng Quee Hock Pte Ltd (in liquidation), Ng said the delay was due to certain
procedures having to be first complied with including the giving of an
indemnity to the first defendant; these had since been complied with and he
had instructed the company secretary to issue new share certificates to the
Official Receiver.

37\. In the course of his cross-examination, Ng's attention was drawn to a
resolution of the board of directors of the first defendant dated 26 November
1997 wherein a company called Lee Huat Investment Pte Ltd (Lee Huat) was
appointed the first defendant's general agent and a deposit of $200,000 was
paid as agency fees to the former. Questioned on Lee Huat, Ng said he was a
shareholder of the company. Ng's attention was also drawn to another
resolution of the first defendant dated 1 May 1998 approving the appointment
of one Kong Choot Sian as the company's consultant at a monthly salary of
S$9,000 and the appointment of one David Ng Puay Tiong as an administration
supervisor at a monthly salary of S$4,000, for a period of five (5) years.
Questioned, Ng said Kong Choot Sian is the son-in-law of Ng Quee Lam while
David Ng is his cousin but, he did not bring him into the company; I shall
make my observations on these resolutions later in my findings.

_(iii) the second defendant's case_

38\. The second defendant, a bank officer, was the only witness for herself.
She produced a receipt from NQL dated 26 December 1990 to prove she had paid
RM4,290 for her purchase of the NQL shares. She believed that the price she
paid (RM0.10 per share) was not less than what the shares of the first
defendant were then worth. The second defendant pointed out that at the
material time, the first defendant was in serious financial trouble and its
shares were practically worthless as its liabilities exceeded its assets by
millions of dollars and it was involved in several suits with its creditors,
including banks. She asserted that the plaintiffs' allegation of fraud was an
attempt to circumvent s 29 of the Limitation Act. The second defendant denied
she knew that NQL was insolvent or likely to be so at the time of her
purchase. She bought the NQL shares for sentimental reasons so that the shares
of the first defendant would remain within the family since her father had put
in a lot of effort to build up the first defendant and, the shares were owned
by his own company. Questioned by the court, the second defendant said it was
her father who initiated the offer through her; he could not buy himself as he
was already a bankrupt. As for the 350 shares of Ng Siew Hoon, the second
defendant said they were not transferred to her but to her sister Ng Siew Mui.

39\. While she was aware that her father had the project as well as several
other housing projects, the second defendant said she did not know the
details. She was also not aware that the project came under the first
defendant until she saw the company's accounts in relation to the negative
value of its shares and that her offer of RM0.10 per share was a fair value.
She did not pay much attention to the project as she was aware that the first
defendant had and still has, numerous debts. Questioned why in that case she
was willing to and did, pay RM2.65 per share for the NEK shares she
subsequently purchased from the first defendant, the second defendant
explained this was some two (2) years later; she had no choice as it was the
only price at which the vendor was willing to sell. She acknowledged that she
would have been unhappy had Excelux bought the NEK and NQL shares and thereby
obtained control of the first defendant although there were no ill feelings
between herself and her cousins from NKT's family. She also agreed that by
January 1996 it appeared to her that she had got a bargain for the NQL shares
and they were certainly worth more than RM0.10 a share. However she denied the
affidavit she filed for the OS proceedings was misleading pointing out that
the affidavit was based on 1990 events, not what transpired in 1996.

40\. As for the first defendant, the second defendant testified that she
relied on the directors and her sister Ng Siew Kuan (who had since passed
away) but not her sister's husband Kong Choot Sian, to run the family owned
company.

_The findings_

41\. I shall first dispose of the plaintiffs' claim relating to the 350 shares
sold to Ng Siew Mui. Counsel for the plaintiffs conceded that his clients'
claim against the second defendant must fail as those shares were never
transferred to her. Accordingly I dismiss with costs that claim against the
second defendant.

42\. I turn next to the far more substantial claim relating to the NQL shares.
In that regard several issues were raised by the parties. Firstly, is the
plaintiffs' claim time-barred pursuant to s 6(1) and (2) of the Limitation
Act? Secondly, has fraud been established against the defendants in relation
to their dismissal of the OS proceedings? Next, does article 25(B) and (C) of
the first defendant's articles of association require the company to give
notice to all existing members of an intended sale of shares and, were the NQL
shares transferred to the second defendant in breach of those articles?
Finally, is this action barred by the doctrine of res judicata because of the
dismissal of the OS proceedings without any appeal therefrom?

(_i) Is the claim time-barred?_

43\. The plaintiffs relied on s 29 of the Limitation Act for their counsel's
argument that his clients' claim was not time-barred whereas the defendants
relied on s 6 for the opposite proposition. As both sections are relevant to
my determination, I set them out herewith:

> > 6(1) Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after
> the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action
> accrued:
>>

>>> (a) actions founded on a contract or on tort;

>>

>> (2) An action for an account shall not be brought in respect of any matter
which arose more than 6 years before the commencement of the action.

>>

>> 29(1) Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is
prescribed by this Act --

>>

>>> (a) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent or of
any person through whom he claims or his agent;

>>>

>>> (b) the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person as
aforesaid; or

>>

>>> (c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,

>>

>> the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has
discovered the fraud or the mistake, as the case may be, or could with
reasonable diligence have discovered it.

>>

>> (2) Nothing in this section shall enable any action to be brought to
recover, or enforce any charge against, or set aside any transaction
affecting, any property which --

>>

>>> (a) in the case of mistake, has been purchased for valuable consideration
by a person who was not a party to the fraud and did not at the time of the
purchase know or have reason to believe that any fraud had been committed; or

>>

>>> b) in the case of mistake, has been purchased for valuable consideration,
subsequently to the transaction in which the mistake was made, by a person who
did not know or have reason to believe that the mistake had been made.

44\. Determination of the first issue is dependent upon my finding on the
second issue – did the defendants obtain the dismissal of the OS by fraud? If
they did not, I would accept the defendants' contention that the plaintiffs'
claims based on breach of contract are time-barred as more than 6 years have
lapsed from the date (26 December 1990) when the NQL shares were transferred
to the second defendant.

(_ii) did the defendants fraudulently obtain the dismissal of the OS?_

45\. The plaintiffs' case based on fraud relied heavily on the statement made
by the second defendant in her affidavit filed on 16 January 1996 for the OS,
that the NQL shares were either valueless or unlikely to be worth even RM0.01
per share. I had in para 12 above particularised the plaintiffs' allegation
that the second defendant knew that her deposition was false. The plaintiffs'
pleaded case however has to be seen against the evidence adduced at the trial.

46\. The plaintiffs' case officer Wang was unable to enlighten the court on
what transpired at the hearing of the OS as he was not directly involved in
those proceedings. However, Wang did confirm that what triggered off the
plaintiffs' present action was the receipt by his office on 19 November 1999
from the first defendant's solicitors of the two (2) letters dated 22 May and
19 June 1999 from the Malaysian tax authorities setting out the real property
gains tax payable by the first defendant. The first letter related to the
disposal of 7 lots of Tebrau properties at RM54.93m while the later assessment
related to the disposal of the Pulai property at RM100m, both disposals were
on 28 December 1995. I am of the view that too much store has been put on
these two (2) letters by the plaintiffs. In any case, the first defendant has
appealed against the assessment, according to Ng.

47\. While I accept Wang's testimony that the third plaintiff was in no
position at the hearing of the OS (25 March 1996) to challenge the statements
made by the second defendant that the shares of the first defendant had no
value or were worthless, I do not accept that the Official Assignee could not
have done anything else other than to accept what the second defendant said at
face value. Cross-examination of Wang revealed that Excelux funded the OS just
as they are funding these proceedings. The third plaintiff could and indeed
should, have filed a rebuttal to the second defendant's affidavit _after_
obtaining his own valuations (as the plaintiffs have now done) of the first
defendant's properties to show the same were worth more than the values put on
them by CH Williams and Colliers Jordan Lee & Jaafar Sdn Bhd (Colliers). Wang
candidly admitted that this course of action did not occur to his office at
the material time. His office did not inquire of members of NKT's family
whether Excelux was willing to pay for the costs of obtaining valuations of
the first defendant's Malacca and Johore properties and of its shares. Even
without comparative valuations however, a valid objection which could have
been (but was not) raised by the third plaintiff at the hearing of the OS was,
that the property valuations relied on by the second defendant were not
reflective of their values _as at 26 December 1990_. The valuation done
(retrospectively) by CH Williams was as at 1 January 1988 for the Malacca
properties, it was outdated by almost three (3) years whilst the first (dated
1 October 1989) by Colliers was more than a year outside the requisite date
and the second (dated 29 August 1990) was four (4) months too early .

48\. It is noteworthy that Casey Lin's report was also retrospective being
dated 8 January 1996 but based on values as at 26 December 1990. Casey Lin
relied on the qualified audited balance sheet of the first defendant as at 31
December 1990 for information concerning the company's assets and liabilities
and the fact that the company's trading results showed losses for the years
1989 to 1991. Casey Lin clearly stated in para 4 of its report that it did not
carry out an audit of the group, it relied on information provided by the
company's management and the auditors' report without verification and of
course on the valuations done by the aforementioned two valuers. Casey Lin's
report contained the following concluding paragraph:

> > In the light of this, we are unable to state whether the value per share
> of the group is exactly -RM33.49 as at 26 December 1990. However, based on
> evidence of claims from the banks and subsequent accounts, it is unlikely
> that the share value of the group to be worth RM0.01 at all as at 26
> December 1990.

49\. There are other factors which need to be considered in relation to the
property valuations. Firstly, the first defendant finally disposed of all the
Johore properties (after numerous attempts) in December 1995. This was five
(5) years _after_ the second defendant had purchased the NQL shares while the
assessment of capital gains tax by the Malaysian tax authorities was only made
nine (9) years later in mid-1999. I agree with counsel for the plaintiffs that
it would have been preferable had the second defendant disclosed in her
affidavit (filed on 16 January 1996) that the first defendant had reaped an
unexpected windfall in the previous December 1995 by disposing of plots of
land it had owned for over 20 years (but which had yielded little revenue in
the interval not to mention being the subject of conflicting claims from
prospective purchasers and lending banks). However, as the second defendant
repeatedly maintained under cross-examination, her concern in the OS was with
the financial status of the first defendant as at 26 December 1990, not
subsequent dates and events. Moreover, she had worked in a bank throughout the
years and had nothing to do with the running of the company which she left to
the directors and her sister. How then can it be said she had deliberately
concealed the property sales and profits generated therefrom from the third
plaintiff? How could she know, as the plaintiffs alleged, that the shares were
not valueless? As far as the second defendant was concerned, the first
defendant was a debt-ridden company which indeed it was. Of course as it
turned out, and which the second defendant admitted, her purchase proved to be
at a bargain price but, we are not concerned here with hindsight.

50\. The plaintiffs had also alleged that the second defendant knew that the
accounts of CH Teo were qualified; hence they did not show a true and fair
view of the company's financial position and presumably she should not have
relied on them. Although the accounts were indeed qualified, there were no
other accounts or means whereby the second defendant could assess the first
defendant's share value. The fact that those 1990 qualified accounts were only
ready 2 years later (on 2 April 1993) also speaks of the state of the
company's management and financial health. From the second defendant's
testimony, I certainly did not form the impression that she knew very much
about or was interested in, the first defendant let alone its financial
position. She was vague on the properties it owned and she was none too clear
about the (housing) project either. Like other members of her family, she held
the shares in the company either for or because of her father or on behalf of
his company NQL. Unlike her two (2) sisters, she never worked in the company
at all. What she knew about the company would be what Ng or other directors
told her; she would have had no first hand knowledge. I therefore do not agree
with the plaintiffs' assertion (made through Wang) that the use of the word
'_directed'_ by the second defendant in her affidavit filed for the OS (in
relation to her request or instruction to the first defendant to obtain
valuation reports) implied that she was in a position to direct the affairs of
the first defendant notwithstanding that she was not a director.

51\. I had in para 37 above, briefly referred to the appointment in 1998 of
the son-in-law of Ng Quee Lam as a 'consultant' at a monthly salary of S$9,000
and David Ng being appointed as an administration supervisor at S$4,000 per
month. For a debt-ridden company, such salary scales would be considered very
high by any standards. One also wonders why a property-based company would
need to have a 'consultant'. A cursory perusal of the general ledger accounts
of the first defendant for 1997 and 1998 (see AB852-1089) shows widespread
misuse of the company's funds. Despite its continuing trading losses, the
company's money was used for a variety of expenditure totally unrelated to its
business including entertainment, household appliances/items, furniture and
incidentals, meals, parking charges and petrol. Unfortunately, this practice
is not an uncommon occurrence in many family-owned and family-run companies;
their directors and or shareholders have a tendency to give themselves a
_carte blanche_ to use the company's funds as and how they please. I can only
say it reflects poorly on them and such a questionable practice is to be
discouraged. It does not surprise me that the accounts of the company, at
least for 1990, were qualified.

52\. The last factor be taken into account on the issue of the first
defendant's share value is the defendants' computation set out at 2AB202 and
reproduced in para 27 above. Their calculation was premised on and accepted
the accuracy of, the valuations done by the plaintiffs' valuers Param &
Associates. The defendants' disagreement with the plaintiffs centred on three
(3) items which the plaintiffs did not but which the defendants factored into
their calculations namely: (i) real property gains tax levied by the Malaysian
tax authorities, (ii) the encumbrances on (and the liabilities attached to)
the various plots of land and (iii) Singapore income tax liability.

53\. I am mindful that the plaintiffs' expert Lim disagreed with the
defendants' negative figure because he assessed the company's share value on
the basis that the company is a going concern, not that it was being broken
up. While I would be loathe to disagree with any accountant on his method of
calculation of the fair value of a company's shares, it seems to me that the
defendants' approach is sensible and is to be preferred. I would imagine that
for a true and fair view of a company's financial health to emerge, one would
need not only to take into account all its assets but also all its liabilities
to arrive at its net value. Whether the company is valued as a going concern
or on a break-up basis, it cannot avoid its creditors be it income tax
authorities or judgment creditors – confirmed liabilities must be or have to
be discharged, otherwise the company runs the risk of compulsory liquidation.
Indeed Lim agreed that its liabilities (other than real property gains tax)
should be taken into account when valuing the first defendant. Even if I
accept his view that the outstanding Malaysian tax (totalling RM1,627,883.70)
should not be taken into account and the two (2) amounts are added back to the
deficiency of RM3,469,578.70, the share value would still be a negative
figure, as can be seen from the following computation:-

Deficiency of assets over liabilities (+3,469,578.70… 1,627,883.70) = …
1,841,695

Value per share = … _RM1,841,695_ = … RM11.196  
164,500

54\. Consequently, I would answer the second issue in the negative. I do not
find that either defendant was guilty of any fraudulent conduct which enabled
the second defendant to obtain the dismissal of the OS. The plaintiffs having
failed on their claim based on fraud, they cannot take advantage of the
extended time limit provided under s 29 of the Limitation Act. Accordingly,
the time-bar under s 6(1)(a) of the Act would apply. Even if I accept the
plaintiffs' contention that they only found out about the transfer of the NQL
shares to the second defendant in or about November 1992, the claim would
still have been time-barred by November 1998; these proceedings were commenced
on 1 February 2000.

_(iii) does article 25 give a right of pre-emption to existing shareholders?_

55\. Although my findings on the first two (2) issues would dispose of this
suit, I will go on to consider the remaining two (2) issues, starting with
article 25. The relevant provisions of that article in the first defendant's
articles of association state:-

> > (B) Save as hereby otherwise provided, _no share shall be transferred to
> any person who is not a member of the Company_ so long as any member or any
> person selected by the directors as one whom it is desirable in the
> interests of the company to admit to membership is willing to purchase the
> same at the fair value, which shall be determined as hereinafter provided.
>>

>> (C) In order to ascertain whether any member or person selected as
aforesaid is willing to purchase a share at the fair value, the person,
whether a member of the Company or not, proposing to transfer the same
(hereinafter called the 'retiring member') shall give a notice in writing
(hereinafter described as 'a sale notice') to the Company that he desires to
sell the same. Every sale notice shall specify the denoting numbers of the
shares which the retiring member desires to sell and shall constitute the
Company the agent of the retiring member for the sale of such shares to any
member of the Company at the fair value. No such notice shall be withdrawn
except with the sanction of the directors.

56\. A plain reading of the above article does not support the plaintiffs'
contention that existing shareholders have a pre-emptive right to shares being
offered for sale. The key words in article 25(A) are those underlined. The
prohibition against transferring shares to a non-member if a member was
willing to buy would not apply to the second defendant because she was already
an existing shareholder of the first defendant when the NQL shares were
offered for sale. Support for my views can be found in the cases relied on by
the defendants namely _Delavenne v Broadhurst_ [1931] 1 Ch 234 and _Greenhalgh
v Mallard_ [1943] 2 All ER 234.

57\. Counsel for the plaintiffs relied on the Australian case _Carew-Reid v
Public Trustee_ 20 ACSR 443 for his clients' right of pre-emption. In that
case the issue concerned the interpretation of a similar article (namely
article 103) in a company's articles of association which states:

> > A share may be transferred by a member or other person entitled to
> transfer to any member selected by the transferor but save as aforesaid and
> subject to articles 108 and 110 no share shall be transferred to a person
> who is not a member so long as any member (or any person selected by the
> directors as one whom it is desirable in the interests of the company to
> admit to membership) is willing to purchase the same at fair value.

The court there held that there was no evidence that the shares which the
plaintiff wished to transfer were offered to the other members first or at
all. Consequently the registration of shares effected in breach of the pre-
emption rights in the articles was void and the defendant shareholder had the
right to apply for rectification of the share register. That situation is far
different from our case.

58\. Another case relied on by the plaintiffs was _Mohamed Yahaya v MS Ally
Sdn Bhd_ CSLR V 379. There, although the pre-emptive rights of the articles of
association of the defendant company were considered by the Malaysian court,
the actual dispute did not turn on the pre-emption article but whether a
retiring member of the defendant company had the final say on the offer price
for his shares. He had offered to sell his shares at $2.60 per share whereas
the company had accepted offers at $1.63 per share (as determined by the
company's auditors to be the fair value) from existing shareholders on his
behalf and effected the transfer of his shares to transferees at that price
despite his objections. Hence, the case is not relevant.

_(iv) is the claim by the third plaintiff res judicata?_

59\. In the OS proceedings, the third plaintiff had sought a declaration
against the second defendant that the transfer to her of the NQL shares was
void under s 329(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) and s 52 of the then
Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20). The OS raised two (2) issues namely:-

> > a. whether the NQL shares had been transferred to the second defendant at
> an undervalue;
>>

>> b. whether the procedure adopted on the transfer of the shares involved a
breach of the first defendant's articles which breach itself invalidated the
transfer.

The court dismissed the third plaintiff's application although the reasons
therefor were not stated.

60\. Consequently, the question arises whether the third plaintiff is
precluded from making the same claim in these proceedings, based on the
principles of (i) action estoppel or (ii) issue estoppel (res judicata in its
widest sense). In support of (i) and (ii), counsel for the defendants relied
on _The modern law of evidence_ (1996 4th ed at pp 546-550) by _Adrian Keane_
for his contention that as between the third plaintiff and the second
defendant, the claim could not be re-litigated. It is trite law that for a
judicial decision to operate as a res judicata

> > (a) it must be final,
>>

>> (b) the parties to the action and the issue must be the same in both
actions and

> > (c) the issue was necessary or fundamental to the earlier decision reached
> instead of being merely a collateral matter.

The defendants argued that the requirements were satisfied save that the mode
of commencement of the proceedings differed, the earlier being by way of
Originating Summons while the present was by way of a writ of summons.

61\. Counsel for the plaintiffs on the other hand referred to _The doctrine of
Res Judicata_ (1996 3rd ed) by _Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley_ for his
argument that even if the outcome of the OS amounted to res judicata, fraud
would vitiate the estoppel and such fraud included every variety of mala fides
and mala praxis whereby a party deceives the judicial tribunal. To succeed,
the third plaintiff would have to show that he had come into possession of
fresh facts/evidence which brings into question the findings in the OS.
According to _Keane's_ textbook, the fresh evidence must show conclusively
that the previous decision was wrong or must be likely to be decisive or,
evidence such as entirely changes the aspect of the case. As pointed out
earlier (para 49), the alleged fresh evidence pertaining to the actual
realised values of the first defendant's Malaysian properties were not events
which took place in 1990 but in 1995. I should also point out that the various
sub-sales of the first defendant's Malacca properties (see para 8) referred to
by the plaintiffs do not help their case either as I am only concerned with
what the first defendant itself received under its own sale agreements, not
the profits made by its purchasers or sub-purchasers under those agreements.

62\. As my earlier finding was that there was no fraudulent conduct on the
part of the second defendant, the decision in the OS cannot be impugned.
Consequently, the principle of res judicata would apply to preclude the third
plaintiff from making the same claim against her. Although the first and
second plaintiffs are not estopped from raising afresh the issue that the NQL
shares were transferred to the second defendant by the first defendant at an
undervalue, that still does not advance their case any further as I do not
find there was such undervalue either, based on the computation set out in
para 53 above.

_Conclusion_

63\. Accordingly, I dismiss the plaintiffs' claim against both defendants with
costs.
