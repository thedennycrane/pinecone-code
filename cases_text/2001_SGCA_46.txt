Commercial Arbitration  
  

**JUDGMENT:**

**_Curia Advisari Vult_**

1\. This appeal raises a general question of law as to the power or
jurisdiction of an arbitrator under the International Arbitration Act (Cap
143A) (IAA) and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration
(the Model Law) to revisit or reverse an award he has made. UNCITRAL is the
acronym for United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The Model
Law is set out in the First Schedule to the IAA. At the hearing below, the
judge set aside the further award rendered by the arbitrator on the ground
that, when he made that further award, he was _functus officio_.

**

The facts

**

2\. We shall first briefly set out the background facts giving rise to the
application to set aside the further award. In 1994, the appellant, Mr Jeffrey
Tang (Tang) and the respondent, Mr Stanley Tan (Tan), together with their
respective group of investors, formed a joint venture corporation called
Dynasty Pacific Group (DPG). Dispute arose between them which led to
litigation in Australia. Pursuant to mediation, a Settlement Agreement dated
24 January 1998, was reached. In the Settlement Agreement there was an
arbitration clause for the settlement of disputes arising thereunder. The DPG
had basically two main lines of business property development and hotels.
Under the Settlement Agreement, the businesses were duly divided between Tang
and Tan and their respective associates. It also set out the details on how
the division should be carried out.

3\. However, disputes arose between the parties as to the obligations each
party should fulfil under the Settlement Agreement. The disputes were referred
to Mr Giam Chin Toon SC as arbitrator (the Arbitrator). There were two sets of
disputes giving rise to two separate arbitration proceedings. We are here
concerned with only the second arbitration. Before the Arbitrator, Tang was
the respondent and Tan, the claimant. There were claims and counterclaims
between the parties. One of the counterclaims brought by Tang was for a sum of
A$1,375,762.64 (hereinafter referred to as the "A$1.3 million counterclaim").
On 10 January 2000 the Arbitrator made a reasoned award, with the following
concluding results:-

> "1. The claimants (Tans) claim be dismissed
>
> 2\. The respondents (Tangs) counterclaim be dismissed.
>
> 3\. This award is final save as to costs."

4\. Two days later, on 12 January 2000, the solicitors for Tang wrote to the
Arbitrator, pointing out that, although he had dismissed Tangs counterclaim,
it would appear that an aspect of the counterclaim of Tang relating to cash
deposits were left out by the Arbitrator and that the award in dismissing
Tangs counterclaim did not refer to these cash deposits. Tangs solicitors
accordingly asked the Arbitrator to make an additional award, pursuant to
Article 33 of the Model Law.

5\. On 17 January 2000, the Arbitrator issued an additional award wherein he
acknowledged that he had omitted to address Tangs counterclaim relating to the
seven cash deposits and duly made the award in respect thereof. However, as
regards Tangs A$1.3 million counterclaim, the Arbitrator re-affirmed the 10
January 2000 award and refused to make any award in respect of that
counterclaim because he did not think that Tang was entitled to it. The
Arbitrator gave his reasons.

6\. Following the delivery of this additional award, on 21 January 2000, Tangs
solicitors wrote again to the Arbitrator raising two points. First, they
sought further arguments before the Arbitrator relating to the A$1.3 million
counterclaim on the ground that the Arbitrator appeared to have decided the
matter on the basis of a point which was not argued before him. Second, they
sought clarification as to whether Tang would be entitled to interest on the
cash deposits which were to be refunded to him under the additional award of
17 January 2000.

7\. The Arbitrator acceded to the request of Tang for further arguments and
heard the parties on 31 January 2000. On 6 March 2000, the Arbitrator rendered
"Additional Award II" wherein he dealt with not only the counterclaim for
A$1.3 but also the question of interest on the cash deposits and the question
of costs, which question was reserved under the award of 10 January 2000. On
the A$1.3 million counterclaim, the Arbitrator stated that his previous
interpretation of the relevant provision of the Settlement Agreement as set
out in his Additional Award of 17 January 2000 was erroneous. He thus changed
his mind and gave an award in respect of the A$1.3 million counterclaim with
interest. This award will hereinafter be referred to as the "March award".

8\. Accordingly, Tan applied by way of a motion to have the March 2000 award
set aside.

**

Reasons given by Arbitrator

**

9\. In the March award, the Arbitrator expressly addressed the question
whether he had the jurisdiction or power to recall an award and alter it. We
will now quote the relevant paragraphs of the award where he gave his reasons
why he could do that:-

> It is not in dispute that in the case of judgments pronounced by the courts,
> the Judge has the power to re-consider his verdict so long as the judgment
> has not been entered or perfected. There is no such procedure in an
> arbitration award. So, a judge can, like in the case of _Lim Yam Teck v Lim
> Swee Cheng_ (1979) 1 MLJ 162 change his mind after giving further
> consideration to the matter. There is, therefore, a period in which a judge
> is permitted to re-consider the matter. Thereafter, if a decision is wrong,
> it would have to be rectified by a Court of Appeal.
>
> Unfortunately, the position is less clear in an international arbitration
> award where the arbitrator desires to re-consider the matter. There are no
> direct authorities on the point. If an error is made, there are no express
> provisions whereby the decision could be rectified in a court of law. Great
> injustice would be caused in such a case. It is inconceivable that the law
> or public policy would permit such a situation.
>
> In addition, it has been submitted by Counsel for the Respondent that since
> there is no procedure of registration or perfection of the Award, the
> equivalent period for an arbitrator could be when enforcement proceedings
> are applied for. I agree with this.
>
> I am therefore of the view that an arbitrator can re-consider the award not
> only on the terms of Article 33(1) of the Model Law but under the general
> powers given to him to determine the rules and procedure of the tribunal
> which would include the power to re-consider an award before enforcement if
> the arbitrator so decide. If I have good reasons to re-consider the matter,
> I should be allowed to do it. Otherwise, an injustice would be perpetuated.

10\. It will be seen that essentially the basis upon which the Arbitrator felt
he had the jurisdiction or power to reconsider an award already delivered is
the overriding consideration of justice so long as the award had not yet been
enforced.

**

Court below

**

11\. The judge below was of the view that the March award was a nullity
because the Arbitrator was _functus officio_ when he made that award. Having
rendered an award, the powers which an arbitrator still possesses would only
be those which were reserved under Article 33 of the Model Law. That article
does not empower an arbitrator to recall an award with a view to reversing it.

12\. As regards Tangs alternative argument, that the court should exercise the
discretion conferred upon it under article 34(4) of the Model Law and afford
the Arbitrator an opportunity to resume the hearing so that the ground to set
aside the award could be eliminated, the judge said:-

> Article 34(4) can be invoked only when there are irregularities in the award
> and not when the award is a nullity. Furthermore, the power to remit does
> not apply to an award made after the Arbitrator became _functus officio._

**

Appeal

**

13\. Counsel for Tang, Mr Alvin Yeo, put the issues which we are required to
consider in this appeal under the following four heads:-

> a. Whether the judge erred when he decided that the Arbitrator was _functus
> officio_ when he made the Arbitration 2 Award;
>
> b. If so, whether the Arbitrator had the jurisdiction to reconsider the
> Arbitration 2 Award as regards the claim for A$1,375,762.64 and to make the
> March Award;
>
> c. whether the Respondent had successfully made out a case for setting aside
> under Article 34 of the Model Law;
>
> d. In the alternative, whether the judge erred when he refused to remit the
> March Award to the Arbitrator pursuant to Article 34(4) of the Model Law.

14\. As we see it, there is really only one main issue: was the Arbitrator
_functus officio_ vis--vis the A$1.3 million counterclaim when he made the
March award. If he was, then the March award is a nullity and we do not think
Article 34(4), which gives the court the discretion to remit a case back to
the Arbitrator either to give the Arbitrator an opportunity to resume the
arbitral proceedings or to take such other actions as will eliminate the
grounds for setting aside, can be applied to a case such as this. Here,
remitting the case back to the Arbitrator will not eliminate the problem.

**

Relevant Provisions

**

15\. It is common ground that the proceeding before the Arbitrator was an
international arbitration, governed by the IAA. By s 3 of the IAA, the Model
Law (except Chapter VIII) is to have the force of law. The relevant provisions
are Articles 32-34 of the Model Law which provide:-

_

> Article 32

_

(1) The arbitral proceedings are terminated by the final award or by an order
of the arbitral tribunal in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Article.

(2) The arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the
arbitral proceedings when:

> (a) --- Not relevant
>
> (b) --- Not relevant
>
> (c) --- Not relevant

(3) _The mandate of the arbitral tribunal terminates with the termination of
the arbitral proceedings, subject to the provisions of Articles 33 and 34(4_).
(Emphasis added).

_

Article 33

_

(1) Within thirty days of receipt of the award, unless another period of time
has been agreed upon by the parties:

> (a) a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral
> tribunal to correct in the award any errors in computation, any clerical or
> typographical errors or any errors of similar nature;
>
> (b) if so agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party,
> may request the arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific
> point or part of the award.

If the arbitral tribunal considers the request to be justified, it shall make
the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days of receipt of the
request. The interpretation shall form part of the award.

(2) The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in
paragraph (1) (a) of this Article on its own initiative within thirty days of
the date of the award.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other
party, may request, within thirty days of receipt of the award, the arbitral
tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitral
proceedings but omitted from the award. If the arbitral tribunal considers the
request to be justified, it shall make the additional award within sixty days.

(4) The arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within
which it shall make a correction, interpretation or an additional award under
paragraph (1) or (3) of this Article.

_

Article 34

_

(1) Recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an
application for setting aside in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) of
this Article.

(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in Article 6
only if:

> (a) the party making the application furnishes proof that:
>

>> .  
>  .
>>

>> (iii) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling
within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on
matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if
the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those
not so submitted, only that part of the award which contains decisions on
matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or

>>

>> (iv) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was
not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was
in conflict with a provision of this Law from which the parties cannot
derogate; or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this Law;

>
> .  
>  .

(4) The court, when asked to set aside an award, may, where appropriate and so
requested by a party, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of
time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to
resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the
arbitral tribunals opinion will eliminate the grounds for setting aside.

**

Appellants contentions

**

16\. Mr Yeo relied upon a number of works to say that in this instance there
was, as yet, no _final_ award. First, is _A guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on
International Commercial Arbitration Legislative History and Commentary by
Holtzmann and Neuhaus_ (hereinafter referred to as "The Guide"), where the
authors referred briefly to the history behind Article 32(1) and said:-

> Common to the various definitions is the commonsense notion that a final
> award is simply one that decides, or completes the decision of, all claims
> presented. At the same time, the Secretariat also suggested as an
> alternative a definition of the term final award; this draft provided that
> the making or delivery of the final award, which constitutes or completes
> the disposition of all claims submitted to arbitration, would terminate the
> mandate of the arbitral tribunal.
>
> The Working Group favoured this last approach, although it was noted that it
> would be desirable to express in some provision of the Model Law that the
> arbitral tribunal had the power to render awards such as interim,
> interlocutory, or partial awards. This affirmative definition of the term
> final award without a mention of the other types of awards that might be
> issued was incorporated into the draft of what became Article 32, dealing
> generally with the termination of the arbitral proceedings. Later, however,
> for the sake of simplicity, the Working Group deleted the defining clause
> the words which constitutes or completes the disposition of all claims
> submitted to arbitration leaving just the term the final award that appears
> in Article 32(1).
>
> We may add that Mr Holtzmann was the Secretary-General to UNCITRAL during
> the period when the latter was deliberating on the Model Law.

17\. Next is the Report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations
(Document A/CN 9/260), which incorporated an Analaytical Commentry on Draft
Text of a Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. In the
commentary, the following observation was made on Article 32 (at page 68):-

> A good example is that the arbitrator would become _functus officio_ by
> making an award only if that is the final award, i.e., the one which
> constitutes or completed the disposition of all claims submitted to
> arbitration.

18\. In _Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration by Redfern
and Hunter (3 rd Edition_) the authors stated the following in relation to the
expression final award (8-33):-

> However, the term "final award" is customarily reserved for an award that
> completes the mission of the arbitral tribunal. Subject to certain
> exceptions, the delivery of a final award renders the arbitral tribunal
> functus officio. It ceases to have any further jurisdiction over the
> dispute, and the special relationship that exists between the arbitral
> tribunal and the parties during the currency of the arbitration ends. This
> has significant consequences. An arbitral tribunal should not issue a final
> award until it is satisfied that its mission has actually been completed. If
> there are outstanding matters to be determined, such as questions relating
> to costs (including the arbitral tribunals own costs) or interest, or
> further directions to be given relating to the disposal of property, the
> arbitral tribunal should issue an award that is expressly designated as a
> partial or interim award.

19\. _Redfern and Hunter_ also say that when the arbitrator does not deal with
the question of costs in the award, he effectively reduces "what was intended
to be a final award on the merits of the case to the status of a partial
award."

20\. Counsel submitted that as the Arbitrator did not deal with the question
of costs, as well as the claim on the cash deposits in the 10 January award,
the latter award could not constitute a final award within the meaning of
Article 32(1). While the cash deposits question was dealt with in the 17
January award, the question of costs remained undetermined until the March
award. Until then the Arbitrator had not completed his mission.

21\. Reference was also made by Mr Yeo to _Russell on Arbitration (21 st
Edition)_, which is a work concerned with domestic arbitration rather than
international arbitration under the Model law. There the author recognises
there are three senses in which an award may be said to be final:-

> There are three senses in which an award may be said to be final. First, an
> award may be final in that it determines all the issues in the arbitration,
> or determines all the issues which remain outstanding following earlier
> awards dealing with only some of the issues in the arbitration. Secondly, an
> award is final under section 58(1) of the Arbitration Act 1996 in that it is
> final and binding on the parties. Thirdly, an award must be final in the
> sense of being a complete decision without leaving matters to be dealt with
> subsequently or by a third party.

22\. But in relation to the term "final award", the author said:-

> A final award is descriptive of the kind of award rather than its effect; it
> describes an award which determines all the outstanding issues in the
> arbitration. A tribunal can only make one final award .. and once its final
> award is made, the tribunal is _functus officio_.

23\. Counsel also emphasised the fact that care must be exercised in
considering English authorities because England decided not to adopt the Model
Law following the Mustill Report 1988 which Report came to the conclusion that
the Model Law "does not offer a regime which is superior to that which
currently exists in England."

24\. Section 16 of the English Arbitration Act 1950 provided as follows:-

_

> 16\. Awards to be final

_

Unless a contrary intention is expressed therein, every arbitration agreement
shall, where such a provision is applicable to the reference, be deemed to
contain a provision that the award to be made by the arbitrator or umpire
shall be final and binding on the parties and the persons claiming under them
respectively.

25\. The 1950 Act was replaced by the Arbitration Act 1996, and s 58(1) is the
equivalent of the previous s 16 and it provides:-

_

Effect of award

_

58(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an award made by the tribunal
pursuant to an arbitration agreement is final and binding both on the parties
and on any persons claiming through or under them.

26\. Counsel argued that the concept of an award being final and binding is
different from final award, referred to in Article 32 of the Model Law. The
concept of final and binding means that an award once given, whether partial
or otherwise, cannot be re-opened and the arbitrator would be _functus
officio_ in relation to the matters dealt with in that award. Counsel also
pointed out that in comparison with the English Arbitration Acts, there is no
appeal to the Court under IAA and the Model Law and the parties rights to
challenge an award under the Model Law are severely curtailed.

27\. Counsel submitted that to give an arbitrator the jurisdiction to revise
or vary his earlier award, so long as it is not the final award, will not be
inconsistent with the scheme contemplated under the Model Law and the need for
finality. There is no reason in logic why an arbitrator may not revise or vary
his earlier award if he is, on hearing further arguments, satisfied that his
earlier award is wrong, all the more so bearing in mind that even a High Court
Judge has the inherent jurisdiction to reconsider his decision so long as the
order has not yet been perfected.

**

Respondents arguments

**

28\. The respondents argument is that while s 32 of the Act provides that an
arbitrators mandate only terminates upon the final award, all that means is
that the arbitrator has not finished his mission until all issues have been
dealt with. But that in no way means that in respect of a claim which has been
decided in an award, the arbitrator is empowered to re-open it, so long as
there are other claims or issues yet to be determined, such as costs.

29\. Mr Jeyaratnam, for Tan, submitted that once an award is given, it is
final on all matters dealt with in the award though the arbitration may still
not be completed as there are other issues to be determined or it had
inadvertently omitted to deal with other claims (s 33[3]). But s 33(3) would
not empower an arbitrator to revise or reverse an award already made, even if
that award is only a partial award. Section 33(1)(b) which gives the
arbitrator the power to interpret specific points of an award given reinforces
that viewpoint.

30\. The 17 January award was an additional award which the Arbitrator was
empowered to make pursuant to s 33(3). It is of significance to note that the
Arbitrator had called the 10 January award his final award reserving only the
question of costs. He did it again in the 17 January award. He did not reserve
any right to revisit the issues already dealt with. This is effectively a
final award in so far as the issues dealt with are concerned.

31\. As for Article 19 of the Model Law (which allows the arbitrator to
conduct proceedings as he deems appropriate) and section 12 of the IAA (which
accords to the arbitrator specific powers in relation to the arbitration
including the power to grant any remedy or relief which would have been
ordered by the High Court), counsel submitted that they do not in any way have
any relevance to the question whether the arbitral tribunal may, after having
given an award on a specific matter, have the power to reconsider and vary it.
There must be finality to an award, unless the IAA or the Model Law otherwise
provides, e.g., Articles 33 and 34 of the Model Law.

**

Our decision

**

32\. The judge below had set aside the March award on the ground that when it
was made the Arbitrator was _functus officio_. We have in 15 above set out the
relevant provisions of the Model Law. In this regard, it is relevant to point
out that under s 4(1) of the IAA, it is expressly provided that in
interpreting the Model Law it is permissible to have reference to the
documents of UNCITRAL and its Working Group relating to the preparation of the
Model Law.

33\. The first limb of article 32(1) provides that arbitral proceedings are
terminated by the final award. In 17 above, we have referred to an UN doc A/CN
9/260, where it was stated that:-

> A good example is that the arbitrator would become _functus officio_ by
> making an award only if that is the final award, i.e., the one which
> constitutes or completed the disposition of all claims submitted to
> arbitration.

34\. It will further be recalled from the Guide by Holtzmann & Neuhaus, that
while in the UNCITRAL and the Working Group there were different views as to
the types of award, it was generally understood that final award was simply
one that decides or completes the decision of all claims presented.
Apparently, it was for the sake of simplicity that the term "final award" was
not defined in the Model Law. We would add that Article 32(1) is the only
place in the Model Law where the term "final award" appears.

35\. We do not think there could be any doubt that the final award must be the
one that completes everything that the arbitral tribunal is expected to
decide, including the question of costs. Costs are invariably an item of claim
both in civil litigation in the courts as well as in arbitral proceedings. It
was such an item in the present arbitration.

36\. Following from the above, it is clear that until such a final award is
given, the arbitral tribunals mandate still continues; it is not _functus
officio_. In this connection, Article 32(2) is very pertinent as it provides
that even after an arbitral tribunals mandate is terminated, with the issue of
the final award, it still has certain residual powers as the Articles states
that the termination of the tribunals mandate is subject to Articles 33 and
34(4). Article 33 sets out the scope and the time frames within which the
arbitral tribunal may, after its mandate is terminated, exercise the
additional powers to make corrections, to give interpretation to an award and
to make an additional award. As regards Article 34(4), the tribunal is
empowered to resume hearing the case if the court, on the grounds set out in
article 34(2), remits the case back to the tribunal.

37\. The scheme of things under the Model Law is, therefore, quite different
from the English Arbitration Acts of 1950/1996, where it is provided that an
award made by an arbitral tribunal is final and binding on the parties, and
every such award, whether interim/partial or final, could be challenged by way
of an appeal or review in accordance with the provisions of those Acts.
Therefore, the English authorities, including a Singapore High Court decision
of 1934, _Chung & Wong v CM Lee_ [1934] 3 MLJ 153, which decided that an
arbitrator is _functus officio_ on a particular claim, once he has given his
award, are of no relevance to the interpretation of the Model Law. As we have
referred to earlier, England did not adopt the Model Law because, in the words
of the Mustill Report, 1988, it "does not offer a regime which is superior to
that which currently exists in England." Implicit in this statement is the
recognition that there are differences between the two regimes. We would
reiterate that under the Model Law, there is extremely limited scope
(essentially on jurisdictional grounds) to challenge an award.

38\. It is true that in the 10 January award, as well as the 17 January award,
the Arbitrator had described the award as final. But the label which the
Arbitrator gave to the award could not be conclusive if the facts were that
there was still the claim on costs which have yet to be adjudicated upon.
Accordingly, as the mandate of the Arbitrator had not yet been terminated, he
was entitled to reconsider his decision and if he thought fit, as he did here,
to reverse himself.

39\. We recognise that the High Court has the inherent jurisdiction to recall
its decision which have not yet been perfected. However, we are here concerned
with a model law, discussed and adopted at an international forum. We do not
think it would be correct to inject any domestic law practices or
consideration into the construction of such a model law. Neither could that
have been intended by the participants at the forum who adopted the Model Law.
Nevertheless, until the issue of the final award, the arbitral tribunal is not
_functus officio_. What are the remaining powers of the arbitral tribunal
after it has given the final award are set out in Article 33. The concept of
partial _functus officio_ on the basis of issues/claims decided by the
arbitrator is adopted by the English Courts because of the provisions in their
Arbitration Acts 1950/1996. Singapore has also adopted a similar approach as
far as domestic arbitration is concerned see Arbitration Act (Cap 10). But
there is nothing in the Model Law which indicates that there should be another
sense to the meaning of _functus officio_ other than that set out in article
32.

40\. In the result, we would allow the appeal with costs here and below. The
order of the court below is set aside. The security for costs (with any
accrued interest) shall be refunded to the appellant or his solicitors.
