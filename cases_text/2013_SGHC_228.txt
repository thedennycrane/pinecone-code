Introduction

1 These proceedings were to decide outstanding ancillary matters between Kwee
Lee Fung Ivon (“the Wife”) and Lim Gordon (“the Husband”). This followed the
granting of an Interim Judgment on 17 December 2010.

Background

2 The couple are medical doctors and were married on 3 June 1985. The Wife and
Husband are 54 and 61 years old respectively. As at the time of the hearing,
the Wife was working as a resident physician at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The
Wife comes from a well-to-do family. She is a daughter of the second wife of
the late Henry Kwee, who owned the Pontiac Land Group which has interests in
hotels and properties in Singapore and elsewhere. The Husband is currently an
obstetrician and gynaecologist in private practice at Gleneagles Medical
Centre (“Gleneagles”).

3 The Wife qualified as a doctor in 1985. Before the marriage, the Wife was an
assistant doctor at Richard Choo & Partners (“RCP”) located at Liat Towers,
earning a monthly salary of S$3,000. She ceased working soon after marriage
but resumed practice some 20 years later in 2006. There are five children from
the marriage, three boys born between 1986 and 1990 and a pair of twins
(girls) born in 1992. The Wife left the matrimonial home on or about 3 January
2009 to live in a rented flat but returned later of her own accord.

4 By a consent judgment granted on 22 August 2011, both parties were granted
joint custody of the three youngest children of the marriage _viz_ Alexander,
Laura and Caroline with the Husband being given care and control with
reasonable access to the Wife. The Husband also agreed to solely maintain
without any contribution from the Wife: (i) Alexander, Laura and Caroline as
well as (ii) their second child Christopher until he obtains his first degree.

5 The ancillaries that were outstanding and which needed this court’s
determination were (i) the division of the matrimonial assets and (ii) the
Wife’s maintenance. To support their respective cases, the Wife filed six
while the Husband filed nine affidavits. It is fair to say that the
relationship between the parties is acrimonious.

Division of Matrimonial Assets

The parties assets

6 It was not disputed that the parties jointly own the following assets:

|  Asset |  Date of acquisition/ incorporation |  Current estimated value   
---|---|---|---  
(a) |  7 Victoria Park Close, Singapore (“the matrimonial home”) |  1987 |  S$42m (based on CBRE valuation on 13.2.12)  
(b) |  Flat #302, Elkhorn Lodge, Beaver Creek, Colorado, USA (“Elkhorn Lodge”) |  June 1997 |  US$1.3m (as at 12.10) (Husband’s estimate)  
  
  

As stated above, 7 Victoria Park Close was the parties’ matrimonial home.

7 In addition, the parties have joint accounts with the following banks with
the following balances:

|  Account |  Balance

(a) |  RBS Account 152025XXX (“RBS Joint Account 1”) |  £8,161 (as at 8.1.13)

(o) |  OCBC Account No XXX |  SS$443,931 (account now closed)  
(p) |  FirstBank (USA) Account No. XXX |  US$10,702.77 (as at 28.2.12)

(r) |  Deutsche Bank Portfolio Account No 609XXX (“the Husband’s DB Account”) |  S$4,065 (as at 29.2.12)

(u) |  Some articles of jewellery and personal adornments (including watches) |   
  
  

One of the key assets of GLC is the premises at Gleneagles #10-07 (“the
Gleneagles unit”). The Wife values this at S$4.59m whereas the Husband values
it at S$3.4m.

9 The Husband’s assets also included 13 NTUC Income Foundation and/or
Education and/or Incomeshield insurance policies that he had purchased for
each of the five children. He also has an NTUC Incomeshield policy no XXX195
in which the Wife is the beneficiary.

10 The Wife contended, _inter alia_ , that the DBS Joint Account had a balance
of S$185,252.76 before the Husband unilaterally withdrew all the monies
therefrom in April 2009.

11 Since the Husband had also admitted that he only needed about S$2.1m for
the children’s education, it meant that there was a surplus of at least S$1.2m
in the Trust. The Wife herself estimated that the Husband would only need
S$1.2m as a Further, as the Husband had admitted that monies from DB Joint
Bank Account 1 and DB Joint Bank Account 2 had gone into a trust fund known as
The Grateful Trust (“the Trust”), the Trust was a matrimonial asset. The Trust
had assets worth around S$3.3m. As will be discussed further below (at [43]
ff), the husband claimed that the Trust was set up to finance his children’s
overseas education. reasonable sum to educate the children to a first degree
level. Consequently, the rest of the funds in Trust should be returned to the
matrimonial asset pool for distribution.

12 The Wife further alleged that the husband had siphoned off monies from
their various joint accounts (including the DBS Joint Account mentioned at
[10]) to service the mortgage on the Ash Grove property. She therefore alleged
that the Ash Grove property was a matrimonial asset subject to division. She
denied the Husband’s claim that he had borrowed monies from his mother and
sister to part-fund the purchase, arguing that he had produced no evidence to
support their loans.

13 The Wife also accused the Husband of failing to disclose the following:

(a) the sale proceeds of the couple’s condominium at Unit 506, Lorong Ampang
Dua, (“the KL property”);

(b) the sale proceeds of the couple’s flat at Kensington Green, Marloes Road,
London W8 (“the London flat”); and

(c) his interest in his family company Hui Huat Pte Ltd (“the Lim’s Family
Company”).

Consequently, counsel for the Wife, Mr Christopher De Souza (“Mr De Souza”),
argued that the Husband had not disclosed all his assets and an adverse
inference should be drawn against him for such non-disclosure.

14 On her part, the Wife disclosed the following assets as solely owned by
her:

|  Asset |  Value  
---|---|---  
(a) |  Mercedes Benz vehicle No SBB3838X (“the Mercedes”) |  S$150,000 (as at 16.2.12)  
(b) |  Lexus motor vehicle No SJJ 4583L (“the Lexus”) |  S$66,000 (as at 16.2.12)  
(c) |  35,000 shares in the Raffles Medical Group |  S$78,400 (as at 30.9.11)  
(d) |  33,418 Comfort Delgro shares |  S$46,785.20 (as at 31.10.11)  
(e) |  1,106 OCBC shares |  S$9,367.82 (as at 31.10.11)  
(f) |  2,500 SBS Transit shares |  S$4,400 (as at 31.10.11)

(j) |  23,041.47 Horizon Singapore Fixed Income Enhanced Fund units |  S$29,976.65 (as at 31.10.11)  
(k) |  1 out of 2 shares in GLC |  S$6,188,286 (Based on the Wife’s estimate) The Wife valued the Gleneagles unit at S$4,590,000. She has also not been paid dividends worth S$428,000.  
(l) |  DBS Account No 008-016XXX |  S$11,374,47 as at 29.12.11  
(m) |  DBS Account No 558XXX |  S$11,944.29  
(n) |  DBS Savings Plus Account |  S$602.60 (as at 1.2.11)

(r) |  CPF |  S$378,111.36  
(s) |  Jewellery |  Unknown  
  
  

15 The Husband pointed out that the Wife failed to disclose the following
assets until he raised the issue:

Asset |  Value  
---|---  
POSB savings account No 087XXX |  Unknown  
Undisclosed bank accounts held in joint names with each of the five children |  Unknown  
Membership of The American Club |  Unknown  
Membership of Singapore Island Country Club |  Unknown  
Membership of Singapore Swimming Club |  Unknown  
  
  

16 Before I deal with the parties’ respective submissions, I should point out
that this court had heard a related application in Originating Summons No 209
of 2013 (“OS 209/2013”) which was taken out by the Wife’s mother.

17 In OS 209/2013, the Wife’s mother applied for a declaration that she was/is
the legal and beneficial owner of 50% share in the matrimonial home. On 22
July 2013, this court ruled _inter alia_ that:

(a) the Wife’s mother was the legal and beneficial owner of 50% of the
matrimonial home (notwithstanding these proceedings);

(b) that the matrimonial home should be sold and

(c) the Wife’s mother shall be paid 50% of the net sale proceeds after
deducting costs and expenses incurred in relation to the sale.

The Husband has not appealed against this court’s decision in OS 209/2013.

18 Attendant with these proceedings, the Wife was granted leave by another
court in Originating Summons No 654 of 2012 (“OS 654/2012”) to take derivative
action in the name of GLC under s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev
Ed) against the Husband for breaches of his director’s duties. The wife then
commenced a derivative action by way of Suit No 98 of 2013 (“Suit 98/2013”),
claiming that the Husband had acted in breach of duties by, _inter alia_ ,
transferring the business of GLC to GLCSFW. The Husband appealed against the
High Court decision in OS 654/2012 in Civil Appeal No 163 of 2013 (“CA
163/2013”). At the recent hearing of CA 163/2013 however, the Husband had a
change of heart and informed the Court of Appeal that he was willing to put
into the matrimonial asset pool for division all three entities _viz_ GLC,
GLCSFW as well as his sole proprietorship called Gordon Lim Clinic & Surgery
for Women (“the sole proprietorship”).

19 GLCSFW was incorporated on 22 July 2010 and the Husband commenced practice
with GLCSFW in October 2010. The sole proprietorship was started in April 2010
and was terminated on 23 April 2011. GLCSFW rented the Gleneagles unit owned
by GLC but moved to another rented premises at Gleneagles after the Wife
commenced Suit 98/2013. The Gleneagles unit is currently rented out to a third
party.

The Wife’s case

20 Throughout the lengthy hearing, Mr De Souza repeatedly emphasised that the
couple’s marriage (and GLC in particular) was a 50-50 partnership. As such,
like the couple’s equal half share in (i) 50% of the matrimonial home and her
1 out of 2 shares in (ii) GLC, the Wife claimed that the entire pool of
matrimonial assets should be divided equally between the parties and that she
was entitled to a 50% share (if not more).

21 In her affidavits as well as in her counsel’s submissions, the Wife without
any attempt at modesty, highlighted her immeasurable contributions as (i) a
mother to five children and (ii) as a wife who gave her life to, and
sacrificed her professional career as a medical doctor for, the family. Hence,
she contended, she is entitled to 50% of all the matrimonial assets.

22 The Wife contended that she made direct financial contribution towards the
purchase of the matrimonial home in 1987. She claimed to have jointly paid
with the Husband half the purchase price _ie_ S$1,175,000 _via_ :

(a) S$384,987.93 of CPF withdrawals;

(b) cash payments from the DBS Joint Account; and

(c) a joint loan from Chase Manhattan Bank.

The Wife’s mother paid the remaining half (S$1,175,000) of the purchase price
in cash.

23 I turn now to the Wife’s claims on her indirect contributions to the 25
year marriage. In brief, the Wife asserted:

(a) She organised the couple’s wedding from the invitations right down to the
music for the church ceremony and wedding dinner and subsequent thank-you
notes to guests.

(b) She took care of the physical and emotional well-being of the five
children singlehandedly because the Husband was busy with his practice. To
this end:

(i) In her first and second affidavits, the Wife set out _in extenso_ all that
she had done for each of the five children from birth until they left for
further studies overseas and even thereafter. In the case of her oldest son
Geoffrey, her contributions apparently commenced even before he was born.

(ii) According to the Wife, she was effectively a single mother who
practically raised the children alone with domestic help. She claimed the
Husband was mostly “uninvolved”, preferring to focus on his career and
building up his wealth.

(c) She was largely instrumental in the Husband’s success as a gynaecologist,
from the time he resigned as a registrar with Kandang Kerbau Hospital (“KKH”)
until he went to work for his cousin Dr TH Lean in 1985 in a practice called
Clinic 33, and then when he started his own practice in premises at Specialist
Centre (“the Specialist Centre unit”) in 1986. To this end:

(i) She did everything for the Husband, from printing and sending out
notification cards to his patients from KKH, informing them of the Husband’s
move to private practice to doing the design and layout of Clinic 33. The Wife
referred “countless cases” to the Husband from RCP (where she was employed at
the time) and recommended patients to him for consultations.

(ii) Her father purchased a foetal cardiac monitor and ultrasound machine for
the Husband, saving him from having to apply for a loan or having to dig into
his own savings.

(iii) The Wife accompanied the Husband when he had to do deliveries/surgical
procedures outside office hours, and assisted him as a theatre assistant in a
few surgical procedures as well as acted as a female chaperone for his
patients.

(iv) When he moved his practice to the Specialist Centre unit, the Wife was
responsible for designing the logo of the clinic (which is used to this day),
arranging the printing of business cards, stationery _etc_ as well as
recruiting a staff nurse and a receptionist.

(v) She managed the Husband’s accounts from 1985 until the mid-2000s,
recording the Husband’s daily takings manually into an accounts book and
subsequently, entering the data into a computer using Microsoft Word and Excel
(for which she attended courses). She then deposited the cash into the
clinic’s bank account.

(vi) When the Husband moved his practice to the Gleneagles unit, she worked
closely with a Thai interior designer to design the clinic. This included (A)
commissioning a famous local Chinese brush painter to do three paintings for
the waiting area and (B) selecting a sculpture for the entrance and artwork
for the main consultation room. The Wife personally selected the material and
design for the staff’s uniforms.

(vii) The Wife attended overseas conferences with the Husband.

(viii) The Wife ordered cakes/cookies/festive items for every Chinese New Year
and Christmas for the Husband’s staff.

(ix) The Wife also ordered/selected festive goodies for general practitioners
(“GPs”) who supported the Husband and delivered them personally (with the
driver), during Chinese New Year, the Mid-Autumn festival and Christmas.

(d) She paid the foreign worker’s levy (“FWL”) for the second domestic helper
until her bank account was exhausted.

(e) She organised all the annual family vacations usually to US theme parks
(which the Husband did not join) and to ski resorts including Beaver Creek,
Colorado, US (which the Husband joined infrequently);

(f) She was instrumental in selecting the couple’s investment properties in
Kuala Lumpur, London and in the US.

(g) She took care of the Husband’s two Dobermanns which were show dogs he had
imported from the US.

The Husband’s case

24 The husband disputed the Wife’s claims in [23] above. He contended:

(a)The Wife did not sacrifice her career for him/the family. She was not keen
to work full-time even when her father offered to set up a GP practice for
her. Despite the Husband’s encouragement that she should not let her
qualification go to waste but should obtain qualifications in a specialised
area of medicine, the Wife refused.

(i)The Wife greatly exaggerated her contributions to his practice. She lied
when she claimed to have designed the layout of Clinic 33. The Husband took
over premises which were previously occupied by a paediatrician and no
renovation works were required.

(ii)When the Husband moved to Clinic 33, only a few patients followed him from
KKH. It was he, not the Wife, who sent out notification letters (not cards) of
his move to private practice. It was he, not the Wife, who liaised with the
printers on the design of his business cards _etc_. The Wife did not refer
“countless cases” to him. Her referrals were few and did not contribute
significantly to the growth and success of his practice.

(iii)The Husband relied on referrals from GPs he knew and from his cousin when
the latter was too busy to attend to the patients. Most of the Husband’s
patients came by word of mouth.

(iv)When he was at Clinic 33, he had to shuttle between private hospitals to
perform surgeries and deliver babies. The Wife accompanied him on a few
occasions at night but only when he was at Gleneagles. She stopped
accompanying him after Geoffrey was born in 1986.

(v)It was the Husband’s mother who helped to secure him the Specialist Centre
unit through her connections.

(vi)The Wife’s father gave him a gift of S$30,000 to start his clinic but the
Husband paid S$20,000 for the ultrasound machine using a loan from his cousin.

(vii)Contrary to the Wife’s claim, she played no part in the design or layout
of the Specialist Centre unit; it was a relative of the Husband (an architect)
who did the design which the Husband solely oversaw.

(viii)In the initial years after 1986, the Wife did help the Husband to
manually record his daily takings from the practice and later input the data
into his computer. However the Wife’s recording was not on a daily basis – she
would accumulate takings over days/weeks before recording them. Subsequently
the Wife asked her brother to help her enter the data into the computer,
thereby enabling her brother to see the Husband’s daily takings. As a result,
the Husband took over the recording himself, which he has done for the past 10
years. The Husband also arranged for his receptionist to deposit the daily
takings into the clinic’s bank account.

(ix)The Wife’s sister helped out as a temporary receptionist at Specialist
Centre unit while she was waiting to enter university but the Wife did not
recruited the receptionist or the staff nurse. The receptionist was
recommended to the Husband while he approached the staff nurse as he knew her
personally. Most of the clinic’s full-time staff are employed through
advertisements or through job agencies. The Wife had no dealings with the
staff, save for telephoning the receptionist with instructions to pack her
slimming tablets for the Husband to take home.[note: 2]

(x)The Wife’s only involvement with festive goodies was to order the items.
Thereafter (up to 2006) the driver would deliver them to the clinic. After the
driver left, the Husband himself would pick up and deliver the items to the
clinic. The Wife never delivered festive goodies or flowers to the Husband’s
staff.

(xi)The Wife had minimal involvement in the Gleneagles unit save for one
occasion when she accompanied the Husband to the interior designer. The
Husband alone was involved in its design and construction.

(xii)The Wife had nothing to do with the staff’s uniforms. The Husband was
recommended a seamstress by another doctor and the seamstress designed and
sewed the uniforms although the Husband did ask the Wife for her opinion on
the colour.

(b)The Wife had exaggerated her contributions to his practice and its success.
All income earned therefrom was primarily through the Husband’s sole effort.
Notwithstanding that the Wife did not work at GLC, she received remuneration
(up to 2008) and was paid director’s fees (up to 2009).

(c)The Wife’s claim of being a loving mother and dedicated caregiver was also
grossly exaggerated. The Husband cited numerous incidents to prove that he,
and not the Wife, took care of the children when they were sick or injured.
While the Wife took care of them when they were very young, she always had the
help of two domestic helpers as well as the Wife’s mother when she lived at
the matrimonial home from about 1986/1987 to 1994. The Husband maintained he
was/is the children’s primary caregiver. The Wife did not provide emotional
support to the children as she was demanding and had unrealistically high
expectations of them which sometimes led to quarrels/fights between her and
the children in which the Husband had to act as the go-between and peacemaker.

(d)He, not the Wife, planned birthday parties (for the children when they were
older) and functions at home; the Wife was not interested. On the contrary,
whenever his family held functions, the Wife would be reluctant to attend
them.

(e)The Wife was not truthful in her claim that she paid the FWL – it was paid
from one of the couple’s now defunct joint POSB savings account no 057XXX
(“the POSB Joint Savings Account”) which he alone funded and topped up
periodically. The Wife took away the passbook for this account when she left
the matrimonial home. However, the Husband still managed to exhibit the POSB
passbook entries showing deductions for FWL and his two deposits of S$10,000
each between 12 November 2006 and 31 July 2007. The Husband also produced
entries from the passbook showing that the Wife had steadily depleted this
POSB joint account. There was a letter[note: 3] addressed to him and to the
Wife (at her rented flat) from POSB dated 30 September 2009 stating the
account had been closed because the balance was zero. The Husband now pays the
FWL _via_ GIRO from the Husband’s DBS Account.

The matrimonial home

25 Earlier at [17]-[18], I had alluded to OS 209/2013 where this court ruled
that the Wife’s mother was legally and beneficially entitled to 50% of the
matrimonial home which was to be sold. In OS 209/2013, the parties and the
Wife’s mother had argued extensively on how the purchase price of the
matrimonial home was paid as well as how its redevelopment in 1994 was funded.
I do not propose to repeat the arguments here in any great detail save to set
out the following (undisputed) figures in relation to the contribution towards
purchase price:

Source |  Amount  
---|---  
Husband’s payments (including CPF) |  S$ 323,900  
Wife’s payments (via CPF) |  S$9,100  
Loan from Chase Manhattan Bank |  S$750,000  
Loan by the Wife’s mother |  S$750,000  
Husband’s payments from funds from his practice |  S$467,000  
  
  

The above payments only total S$2,300,000 leaving a shortfall of S$50,000 on
the purchase price of S$2.35m. However as the Wife does not dispute that the
Husband paid for the matrimonial home using his earnings from GLC (indeed it
was her case), I will assume that the shortfall in payment of S$50,000 came
from GLC.

26 It is not disputed that in January 1994 the couple refinanced the Loan from
Chase Manhattan (see [25] above) by taking a loan from DBS for S$2.34m (“the
DBS Loan”). The DBS Loan comprised of (i) a reconstruction loan of S$1.2m
(including an overdraft facility of S$800,000) and (ii) S$340,000 housing loan
to repay the outstanding sum owed to Chase Manhattan. The loan documentation
stated that the monthly instalments for both portions of the DBS Loan totalled
S$16,262.[note: 4]

27 The existing house situated at 7 Victoria Park was demolished and the DBS
Loan was used to build a renovated matrimonial home designed by the renowned
firm of Bedmar & Shi (“the designers”) while the Balinese landscaping was
designed by the well-known designer called Made Wijaya (“Wijaya”), the main
building contractor was Pacific-Nature Landscape Pte Ltd (“the main
contractor”).

28 The Husband paid the instalments of the DBS Loan, the cost of furnishings,
repairs, upkeep _etc_ of the renovated matrimonial home from his earnings from
GLC. He and the Wife also utilised their CPF savings to repay the DBS loan:
S$767,870.37 by the Husband and S$535,804.93 by the Wife. The Husband also
paid $48,814.26 to DBS in August 2006 to redeem the DBS Loan.

29 Although the Wife took credit for the design and building of the renovated
matrimonial home, claiming _inter alia:_[note: 5] that she worked closely with
the designers, sourced for Wijaya and chose the main contractor, she did not
(apart from her self-serving statements and isolated diary entries in 1994)
produce one iota of evidence to support her claims. The Husband, on the other
hand, produced the contract dated 16 March 1992 that he (alone) signed with
the designers,[note: 6] correspondence he had exchanged in 1994-96 with the
designers and other parties involved in the construction setting out matters
that only someone who was intimately involved in the building process would be
aware of. The Husband also attended the site meetings.

30 The Husband’s position on the matrimonial home is that it should be sold
and the Wife should be given 2/7 (or 28.5%) while he is entitled to 5/7 (or
71.5%) of the sale proceeds. As this court in OS 209/2013 held that the Wife’s
mother is entitled to 50% of the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial home, it
means that the Husband’s and the Wife’s shares in the net sale proceeds would
be correspondingly reduced to 2/14 (or 14.25%) and 5/14 shares (or 35.75%)
respectively.

The overseas properties

(i) The KL property

31 The Husband said the KL property was purchased in or about 1997 for RM1.2m
and sold at a loss in 2004 for RM750,000. The purchase was made in the name of
a special purpose vehicle called Perfect Meridian Sdn Bhd (“Perfect
Meridian”). He questioned the Wife’s professed ignorance of the sale pointing
out that as a co-director of Perfect Meridian, she signed a board resolution
dated 16 August 2004 approving the sale of the KL property to one Low Hong
Ling.[note: 7]

32 The KL property had been purchased with a loan of RM660,000 from
PhileoAllied Bank. Less the outstanding loan, the net sale proceeds of about
RM234,896.69 (equivalent to S$101,584.55[note: 8]) was initially deposited
into Perfect Meridian’s Maybank account in Kuala Lumpur before it was remitted
in tranches to the DBS Joint Account between March and June 2006. The Husband
explained that the remitted sum had been used for the family’s expenses.

(ii) The London flat

33 Contrary to the Wife’s claim that she researched its location, amenities
and potential yield, the Husband asserted that it was he who found the London
flat. The Husband used to be a permanent resident of the UK where he studied
from 1968 to 1976. He would visit the UK every two years to renew his
permanent resident status. On one of his trips to the UK with the Wife, he had
shown her the development called Kensington Green where the London flat is
located. It was marketed by a company called HRL in Singapore. The development
had also been recommended to the Husband by some of his colleagues who had
purchased units through HRL. The Husband bought the London flat in March 1997
for £520,000, with the help of a loan.

34 The Husband accused the Wife of lying in taking credit for it when he alone
took care of the upkeep, rental, repairs and mortgage payment of the London
flat. It was sold around March 2004 for £690,000 and the net sale proceeds of
£375,000 were initially deposited into the RBS Joint Account 1. Subsequently,
the funds were transferred first to a DBS fixed deposit account (“the DBS FD
Account”) and later to the Husband’s Lloyd’s Account to earn higher interest.
The funds were earmarked for the children’s education. I shall return to the
London flat’s sale proceeds later when dealing with the Trust.

(iii) Elkhorn Lodge

35 Contrary to the Wife’s claim at [23(e)], the Husband said he was at Elkhorn
Lodge for at least five out of seven skiing trips the family made to Beaver
Creek, the last being in December 2007. The Husband said the purchase of
Elkhorn Lodge was a joint decision by the couple. They purchased it because it
had an excellent view of the mountains.

36 The Husband accused the Wife of lying in contending that it “fell on her
shoulders to design and decorate Elkhorn Lodge” and that she worked closely
with the designers Slifer Designs. He pointed out that the Wife had no
supporting documents for her claims. He, on the other hand, was able to
produce correspondence to show he liaised with (i) the Colorado lawyers, (ii)
the estate agent and (iii) the aforesaid designers. The Husband was/is the
person whom the Elkhorn Lodge manager contacts for maintenance and upkeep as
well as to make arrangements to stay when the family wanted to visit Beaver
Creek, Colorado, US.

37 In fact, the Husband complained of an incident in 2008 when the property
tax bills for Elkhorn Lodge were mistakenly sent by the authorities to the
Wife’s instead of to his email. She failed to forward the same to him and did
not pay the tax. The result was that the Husband ended up paying interest for
late payment of the property tax.

38 The Husband said it was a gross exaggeration on the Wife’s part when she
claimed that she was instrumental in ensuring that Elkhorn Lodge fetched a
good rental. The Husband pointed out that the rental was often insufficient to
cover the monthly interest on the loan that was obtained to finance its
purchase. The Husband periodically has to transfer money from the Husband’s
Lloyd’s Account to cover the shortfall between the rent and the loan
repayments.

39 The Husband indicated he wants the Wife to transfer to him her interest in
Elkhorn Lodge. He pointed out that it is unfair for her to have 50% of the
property. He was willing to assume responsibility for the outstanding loan
since he felt that selling Elkhorn Lodge in the current US property market
would probably result in a loss.

The other assets

(i) The Ash Grove property

40 As stated above at [12], the Wife contended that the Ash Grove property is
a matrimonial property that should go into the asset pool for division. The
Husband disagreed pointing out that he had purchased the Ash Grove property in
November 2010 after the Wife had left the matrimonial home and well after she
had commenced these divorce proceedings in January 2010. He claimed that he
had funded the purchase from (i) a S$115,000 loan from his sister; (ii) a
S$7,858,308.67 loan from his mother; and (iii) a $3.5m loan from United
Overseas Bank (“UOB”). The Husband explained that he purchased the property so
that he and the children would have a home after the matrimonial home is
sold.[note: 9]

41 In the light of the Wife’s/Mr De Souza’s repeated contention that they
disbelieved the Husband had borrowed S$115,000 and S$7,858,308.67 from his
sister and his mother respectively for the purchase of the Ash Grove property,
the court ordered the Husband’s mother to disclose her UOB advices
/statements. These documents confirmed that she is a woman of substantial
means in her own right. The court is satisfied that the Husband’s mother had
indeed extended the aforesaid loan to the Husband which the Husband intends to
repay using his share of the sale proceeds when the matrimonial home is sold.
The Husband’s statement that he took a loan from UOB for S$3.5m on 26 October
2010 is also documented. The Wife’s claim that the Husband funded the purchase
from monies in their joint bank account is therefore unfounded.

(ii) The Lim’s Family Company

42 The Wife had in the course of these proceedings administered
Interrogatories to the Husband on the Lim’s Family Company. Her contention
that the Husband had failed to disclose his interest in the Lim’s Family
Company proved to be untrue. The Husband’s explanation, which the court
accepts, was that the company was incorporated by his parents in 1975 for real
estate investment.[note: 10] Until 1981, his parents were the only
shareholders. The Husband held 153,120 or 21.9% of the shareholdings on trust
for his mother. The company has been dormant since 2010 and was struck off on
7 March 2012.

(iii) The Trust

43 The Trust was the main bone of contention between the parties. The Trust
was established on 3 April 2009. The Husband did not deny the Wife’s
allegation that he had in March 2009 transferred monies from DB Joint Account
1 and DB Joint Account 2 totalling approximately S$2.9m into his personal DB
accounts and then set up the Trust using these funds in April 2009. The
Husband produced a letter from Deutsche Bank (“DB”) dated 7 March 2012
confirming this.[note: 11] The Husband has since closed DB Joint Account 1
(item [7(d)]) and DB Joint Account 2 (item [7(e)]).[note: 12]

44 The Husband confirmed that the children are also beneficiaries of the
Trust. Initially the Trust comprised of (i) the Grateful Trust Discretionary
Account Nos. 606XXX (“the Trust Discretionary Account”) and the Trust Advisory
Account (see item [8(q)] above). Subsequently, to reduce the costs of
administering the Trust, the Trust Discretionary Account was closed, leaving
the Trust Advisory Account as the only account in the Trust.[note: 13]

45 The Wife complained that the Husband is not only the settlor but also a
beneficiary of the Trust which is revocable. The Husband pointed out that the
Trust was specifically created so that he can withdraw money therefrom for the
children’s education (and which he did when he instructed DB on 13 June 2013
to pay A$16,504.25 to Monash University for Christopher’s fees).[note: 14] The
Husband gave a breakdown of the projected costs of the four younger children’
education (Geoffrey, the oldest child, having graduated and is working
overseas). The costs totalled around S$2.1m.[note: 15]

46 In regard to the Wife’s complaint that there was a discrepancy of
approximately S$500,000 between the sums all the parties’ joint bank accounts
and monies in the Trust, the Husband explained that it was due to the fact
that only the monies from DB Joint Account 1 and DB Joint Account 2 were
transferred to the Trust.

47 In fact, the Husband gave a full account of what had happened to the monies
in the parties’ joint accounts under (a) RBS Joint Account 1; (b) RBS Joint
Account 2; (c) DB Joint Account 1; (d) DB Joint Account 2; (e) the DBS Joint
Account (where (a)-(e) are the accounts referred to at [7] above); and (f) the
POSB Joint Savings Account (referred to at [24(e)] above).[note: 16] The DBS
Joint Account was the account that the Wife complained (at [10]) the Husband
had closed when it had a credit balance of S$185,252.76.

48 In essence, the Husband utilised the monies first from the DBS FD Account
(see [34] above) and later, from the RBS Joint Accounts 1 and RBS Joint
Accounts 2 to defray the university fees/living expenses of Laura and Geoffrey
in the UK. He volunteered the information (as the Wife did not ask) that he
used monies in the Husband’s Lloyd’s Account to open an account with: (i)
Christopher at Commonwealth Bank for purposes of his education in Australia
and (ii) Laura at HSBC for purposes of her education in UK. The DBS FD Account
was subsequently closed. The Husband produced documents[note: 17] to support
his statements on the various bank transfers he had made and the accounts he
had opened with the children.

49 Counsel for the Husband, Ms Loh Wai Mooi (“Ms Loh”) had explained (which
explanation the court accepts) that as the Trust comprises of a portfolio of
shares, the value of securities and thereby the Trust, would fluctuate from
time to time.

50 The Husband disclosed that the Trust was created as a safeguard for the
children’s education because of the Wife’s irresponsible, extravagant and
spendthrift ways (for which he cited numerous examples). It was revealed that
the Wife had withdrawn $10,000 from each of the joint POSB accounts she had
with the twins and with Christopher.[note: 18] Further, after leaving the
matrimonial home in January 2006, the Wife travelled (at his expense spending
freely on her supplementary credit cards) to exotic places such as Bora Bora
and Nepal and also to Hong Kong and Melbourne, with her rich divorced and/or
single friends. The Husband only stopped her usage of the supplementary credit
cards when she refused to cut down on her expenses after he had requested that
she do so for the sake of the children’s education and his own retirement.

51 In regard to his own future, the Husband revealed that he was diagnosed
with fibromyalgia in 2010 – a chronic incurable disease characterized by
multiple muscle and joint pains, trigger points, stiffness and muscle
weakness. This condition commenced in the early 1990s when he started
suffering from low back stiffness, pain and muscle weakness. He raised the
possibility that his affliction may affect his ability to work full-time in
future and which may force him to retire. I shall return to the Husband’s
condition later when addressing the Wife’s claim for maintenance below.

52 As for the DBS Joint Account (see item [7(c)] above), the Husband deposed
that he had closed it and transferred the monies therein to the Husband’s DBS
account (see [8]) from which account he meets all the expenses relating to the
family. As at 31 March 2012, the Husband’s DBS account had a balance of
S$14,886.15.[note: 19]

(iv) GLC

53 The Husband explained that the incorporation of GLC required a minimum of
two shareholders and on the advice of his accountant the Wife became the
second/other shareholder, presumably as a matter of convenience. There was
therefore no significance in the fact that the Wife held one of the two issued
shares in the company as she/Mr De Souza sought to suggest.

54 In any case, as mentioned above at [18], the Husband had informed the Court
of Appeal at the hearing of CA 163/2013 that he was prepared to put (i) GLC,
(ii) GLCSFW as well as (iii) the sole proprietorship into the matrimonial
asset pool for division. As such, it is no longer necessary for this court to
decide whether the Husband had (in the words of Mr De Souza) “colonised” the
assets of GLC for the benefit first of the sole proprietorship and
subsequently, of GLCSFW.

55 However, unless the parties otherwise agree, I envisage that an inquiry
will have to be held at a later date to determine what profits the three
practices made for purposes of division between the parties if the Wife does
not (as Mr De Souza seems to suggest) accept the accounts of GLC and GLCSFW as
provided by the Husband. I return to this later at [71] below.

Analysis

56 Was the marriage between the parties an equal partnership as the Wife/Mr De
Souza repeatedly contended? I think not.

57 Common sense dictates that an equal partnership in a marriage means that
both parties contribute equally to the marriage by working or doing the
equivalent in kind; this was not the case here. It is not an equal partnership
where one party (the Husband) toils ceaselessly to maintain and enable the
family/the Wife to live in comfort and the other party (the Wife) spends what
the Husband earns. None of the many cases cited by Mr De Souza for the Wife’s
case supported the Wife’s position in this regard. Mr De Souza’s submission
that the Wife had contributed towards payment of the purchase price of the
matrimonial home must be seen in the light of the fact that the Husband paid
her director’s fees approximating S$180,000 per annum together with attendant
CPF contributions and dividends without her having worked at all at GLC. He
was therefore instrumental in her having the cash to contribute towards the
purchase price. It was hypocritical of the Wife to complain that the Husband
paid the Husband’s mother S$20,000 per annum as a director of GLC for doing no
work.

58 Granted this was a 25 year marriage, but looking at it dispassionately,
what were the Wife’s contributions? Taking what she said in her affidavits at
face value, the Wife appeared to have been an incredibly devoted and amazing
“hands on” mother. However, having reviewed the evidence, this court shares
the Husband’s view that the Wife has grossly exaggerated her contributions and
greatly overstated her case. Indeed, at times she took liberties with the
truth. In this regard, I find it strange that the Wife did not depose to her
accomplishments on oath. She had set out her copious contributions (presumably
drafted by her) not in the body itself of her first affidavit of assets and
means (filed on 30 March 2011) but by way of a 79 page exhibit attached
therewith. [note: 20] Mr De Souza then relied on and quoted her comments _in
extenso_ , but those statements were not made on oath and some were proved by
the Husband to be untrue, as can be seen in the instances cited below.

59 Contrary to the Wife’s allegation that he had alienated himself from the
children by his temper and rages, the Husband disclosed that it was the Wife
who had alienated herself from the children, first when she left the
matrimonial home while the twins were in junior college, and later when the
twins discovered that she was having affairs with Caucasian men. In this
regard, the Wife admitted that she did have one affair in January 2009 after
she left the matrimonial home but claimed that the relationship had
ended.[note: 21] The Husband disputed that, pointing out that according to the
Wife’s diary entries (which the twins found in 2008) she had more than one on-
going relationship; he surmised that was the reason the Wife rebuffed his
repeated attempts at reconciliation, before he found out about her affairs in
2010, as the twins kept them from him for two years so as not to hurt him. I
would add that the affectionate notes written by all five children in the
Father’s Day and birthday cards that they sent to the Husband[note: 22] belies
the Wife’s accusations in any case.

60 As an aside, I would add that to support her professed role of being the
children’s main caregiver, the Wife had procured[note: 23] a 32 page statutory
declaration from the second son Christopher dated 20 July 2012 where he
referred to (voluminous) extracts pertaining to him, from the Wife’s second
affidavit filed on 4 January 2012.

61 I had advised Mr De Souza not to get the children involved in these
proceedings. Mr De Souza pointed out that Christopher had independent legal
advice from another law firm when he made the statutory declaration; that
explanation was disingenuous. The statutory declaration was prepared (although
the contents suggested it was more the Wife than the lawyers who drafted it)
by the law firm to which Mr De Souza was formerly attached before he moved to
his present firm. In any case, I view the statutory declaration with
considerable scepticism – how can Christopher remember what the Wife did for
him when he was a baby/a child? The Husband disclosed[note: 24] that
Christopher had a gambling problem which he told the Husband in various text
messages in April 2012, and the Wife had paid his gambling debt of S$5,000 –
which in my view was a wrong form of “financial assistance” by the Wife. As
Christopher had suffered from depression in or about June 2012, I accept the
Husband’s submission that his statutory declaration should be seen in that
light. Further, it is not for Christopher to testify on his siblings’ behalf
to what the Wife had done for them.

62 One instance where the Wife was found by this court to have lied was her
claim that she used the Mercedes (see item [14(a)] above) which was a gift
from the Husband, to ferry the children around. The court pointed out to Mr De
Souza that would not have been possible as the Mercedes is a two-seater sports
convertible. The Wife further lied when she said she would allow the children
(Christopher in particular) to drive the Mercedes while she was away. The
Husband pointed out that that was not possible since the Wife would lock up
the car’s keys when she was out of Singapore to prevent the children from
using the Mercedes.

63 The court had also informed Mr De Souza that the Wife’s claim that her
earning capacity was only around S$4,000–S$5,000 per month as a locum was
unbelievable as that would be what a newly qualified doctor would earn,
bearing in mind that the Wife had resumed her medical career seven years ago
in 2006. The Husband produced evidence that the Wife had obtained in 2010 a
graduate diploma in family medicine as well as attended courses in anti-aging
medicine and mental health.[note: 25] These qualifications would have enhanced
her employability as a family physician. Therefore, either the Wife was (i)
not trying hard enough in looking for better-paying employment; or (ii) she
was untruthful; or (iii) she could not hold down a permanent job because of
her penchant for travelling. In any case, very tellingly, the Wife did not
produce a single document to support her claim of earning such a low income.
Indeed, what the Wife did produce contradicted her case. She had exhibited an
IR8A form[note: 26] from Parkway Shenton Pte Ltd which showed she earned
S$16,651 for 1½ months work in 2012 (which works out to S$11,100.67 per
month).

64 The Wife had claimed she was in such dire financial straits that she was
unable to pay her credit card bills on time, thereby incurring overdue
interest charges. Yet she did not file any maintenance claims against the
Husband after 2009. Indeed, her previous claim for maintenance in MSS No. 3358
of 2009 was struck out with costs to the Husband because she failed to appear
in court at the hearing on 7 October 2009. In this connection, I note that the
Wife worked at Raffles Hospital between 2006 and 2011 (or thereabouts). What
did she do with her income which would have amounted to S$9,000–S$10,000 per
month? No mention was made of that income in any of her affidavits. Bearing in
mind she left the matrimonial home in January 2009, there was at least three
years’ income that the Wife saved, as the money did not go into the DBS Joint
Account while the Husband paid for all her expenses, including the hire-
purchase instalments (S$2,797.50 per month) on her Mercedes. Mr De Souza did
not address the issue of the Wife’s non-disclosure of her earnings since 2006
and what she did with the dividends and director’s fees paid to her by GLC
before 2009.

65 If the Wife was so impecunious, where did she find $66,000 to pay for
Geoffrey’s master’s course in English literature which she alleged the Husband
refused to pay as it was not the Husband’s preferred course of law or
medicine? She had also accused the Husband of refusing to attend Geoffrey’s
graduation from Oxford University. Suffice it to say the Husband successfully
refuted both allegations and proved that it was he, not the Wife, who paid for
Geoffrey’s master’s degree expenses and accommodation (mainly _via_ a Gold
American Express Charter credit card which charges are borne by the Husband).

66 I noted too that the Wife practised double standards. She was quick to
submit that the Husband’s Tanglin Club membership must be taken into account
in the division of assets even though the membership is not transferable and
has no intrinsic value. Yet, when it came to her memberships of the Singapore
Island Country Club (“SICC”), the American Club and the Singapore Swimming
Club (“SSC”), all of which were transferable club memberships, the Wife took
pains to obtain letters from the three clubs to prove she had acquired the
memberships before her marriage and therefore they should be excluded from
division. However Ms Loh rightly pointed out, the three clubs have
consistently been patronised by the entire family (as proven by the Clubs’
statements/bills produced by the Wife) with the Husband bearing all the
charges. As such, the memberships come within s 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s
Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Women’s Charter”) which states:

(10) In this section, “matrimonial asset” means —

(_a_) _any asset acquired before the marriage by one party_ or both parties to
the marriage —

(i) _ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their
children while the parties are residing together for_ shelter or
transportation or for household, education, _recreational, social_ or
aesthetic _purposes…_

(emphasis added)

The club memberships therefore are matrimonial assets subject to division. Ms
Loh submitted that the current market values of the clubs are (i) S$118,000
for the American Club; (ii) S$224,000 for the SICC and (iii) S$18,000 for the
SSC, thereby adding S$360,000 to the Wife’s assets.

67 Contrary to the Wife’s submission, I do not find that the Husband has
failed to make full and frank disclosure of his assets and means. Instead, it
is the Wife who can be criticised in this respect. She had failed to disclose
(i) a joint POSB account that she had with the Wife’s mother; (ii) what she
did with her own income after 2006; and (iii) what she received from GLC
before 2009. The court draws an adverse inference against her in this respect
(see _O'Connor Rosamund Monica v Potter Derek John_ [2011] 3 SLR 294).

The law

68 It would be appropriate at this juncture to set out the relevant extracts
from s 112 of the Women’s Charter applicable to this case. The section states:

112 — (1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant
of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order
the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any
such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of
any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.

(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its
powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all
the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

(_a_) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or
work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

(_b_) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for
their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

(_c_) the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

(_d_) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the
family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged
or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

(_e_) an order postponing the sale or vesting of any share in any matrimonial
asset, or any part of such share, until such future date or until the
occurrence of such future event or until the fulfilment of such condition as
may be specified in the order;

…

(_g_) an order for the payment of a sum of money by one party to the other
party.

The decision

69 I now apply s 112 of the Women’s Charter to the facts. In the light of my
earlier observations, I am of the view that the Wife is not entitled to 50%
(let alone more) of the matrimonial assets for her contributions to the 25
year marriage. Even though she was the primary caregiver of the children when
they were young, she always had the help of two maids and the Wife’s mother
for about seven years.

(i) The matrimonial home

70 The Husband had offered (which I think is fair), 28.5% of half the net sale
proceeds of the matrimonial home. Based on the Wife’s valuation of S$42m,
subject to the final sale price, that would give the Wife approximately S$6m
as her share.

(ii) GLC, GLCSFW and the sole proprietorship and the cars

71 With regard to GLC, the Gleneagles unit, GLCSFW and the sole
proprietorship, I am of the view the Wife is only entitled to 20% share of the
sale proceeds or current valuation as the case may be, based on a broad brush
approach. The figure gives her credit for the fact that she helped the Husband
to record his daily takings from his practice for a number of years. As stated
at [55] above, if the parties are unable to agree on a valuation of these
assets, an inquiry may need to be held at a later stage. It would be
preferable if the parties can agree on a valuation of all three practices as
well as of the Gleneagles unit failing which separate inquiries may have to be
held to determine their values.

72 The Husband acknowledged that he had not paid the Wife S$428,060 for her
share of the dividends declared by GLC in July 2010. She should be paid the
sum less the sums (S$30,000 or thereabouts) that she had withdrawn from the
POSB accounts of the twins and Christopher, and less the monthly hire-purchase
instalments the Husband had paid for the Mercedes since January 2011 (one
month after the date of the Interim Judgment dated 17 December 2010). The
Mercedes was a gift to the Wife from the Husband and she should be allowed to
keep it for her own use. However, the Wife should transfer to the Husband (or
to one of the children at his choice) the Lexus. That vehicle, although
registered in the Wife’s name, was/is used by the children.

73 The Wife should also be paid her outstanding director’s fees from GLC for
the years 2009-2012. As per the Husband’s request, she shall transfer back to
him or to his nominee forthwith her one share in GLC.

(iii) Elkhorn Lodge

74 The Wife has no claim to Elkhorn Lodge and she shall remove her name from
its ownership.

(iv) The Ash Grove property

75 Although the Ash Grove is technically a matrimonial asset under s 112 of
the Women’s Charter as it was acquired in November 2010 (a month before the
Interim Judgment), I am exercising my discretion and hold that it should be
excluded from the matrimonial assets for division. The property was purchased
by the Husband with borrowed money (from the Husband’s mother, his sister and
UOB) and is intended as accommodation for him and the children after the
matrimonial home is sold. It would be highly inequitable to award the Wife a
share in the same when she made no contribution towards the purchase and the
Husband did not make use of any monies from the DBS Joint Account to fund its
purchase. I accept Ms Loh’s submissions that the facts here are very different
from _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy_ [2011] 2 SLR 1157 and this court
should not abide by the appellate court’s ruling in that case.

(v) The Lim’s Family Company

76 Nothing more needs to be said about the Husband’s family company in the
light of [42]; the Wife has implicitly abandoned her claim.

(vi) The Trust

77 The Wife submitted that the Trust should be unwound and the funds therein
divided equally between the parties. At the very least S$1m should be taken
therefrom and put back into the matrimonial assets pool for division. The
Wife’s submission was based on the Husband’ estimate[note: 27] of
S$1,364,168.80 for the four younger children’s education to first degree level
at university ignoring the additional sum of S$751,476 for projected costs for
Master’s degrees for them. For a mother who professed she had given her life
to the children, the Wife’s stand was utterly selfish. It also contradicts her
position that she funded Geoffrey’s Master’s degree because the Husband
refused to do so. She only thought of herself and not the children or the
Husband who at 61 years of age, is unlikely to practice indefinitely as a
gynaecologist. Physically he cannot especially if his fibromyalgia condition
worsens. The husband too needs funds to live on after his retirement/for his
old age. The court will not unwind the Trust or put back any part of its funds
into the pool for division with the Wife. There is precedent for this court’s
ruling in _AQT v AQU_ [2011] SGHC 138 and _NI v NJ_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75.

(vii) Joint accounts

78 The Wife shall have 50% of the monies in RBS Joint Account 2 (as per the
Husband’s offer) and RBS Joint Account 1.

(viii) Others

79 Finally, the Wife shall remove herself as the beneficiary of the Husband’s
NTUC Incomeshield policy no XXX195 (at [0] above).

80 Subject to what has been ordered above, each party shall retain his/her own
assets.

Maintenance for the Wife

81 The Wife asked for a lump sum maintenance in the amount of S$7,651,399.20
(based on a multiplier of S$31,880.83 per month and a multiplicand of 20
years). The Wife had argued that this lump sum in excess of S$7m was necessary
to fund her lifestyle.

82 The figure is absurd. It included the Wife’s claim that she requires to
make ten trips at S$10,000 per trip (travelling business/Raffles class on
Singapore Airlines) or S$120,000 per annum to visit the children
studying/working in the US, UK and in Australia. The four younger children
return to Singapore every year for holidays. She can see them then.

83 The court has the power to order maintenance payments under s 113 of the
Women’s Charter. The assessment of maintenance is set out under s 114 of the
Women’s Charter. It states:

114 —(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to
his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances
of the case including the following matters:

(a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which
each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the
foreseeable future;

(_b_) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the
parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

(_c_) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the
marriage;

(_d_) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

(_e_) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the
marriage;

(_f_) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the
welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the
home or caring for the family; and

(_g_) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value
to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a
pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that
party will lose the chance of acquiring.

(2) In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so
to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their
conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have
been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his
or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.

84 Mr De Souza had placed great emphasis on ss 114(1)(c) and 114(2). He took
the court through innumerable statements to show the average monthly bills
incurred by the family/the Wife reflecting the lifestyle the Wife was
accustomed to during the marriage.

85 The Husband on the other hand submitted that the Wife should not be awarded
any maintenance at all as her monthly expenses, an exorbitant
S$31,880.83[note: 28] (which she had reduced from her initial estimate of
S$46,402.88),[note: 29] should realistically be reduced to S$7,500 which the
Wife can comfortably earn.

86 I agree that the multiplier should be reduced. Some of the Wife’s expenses
were completely unjustified. If she is no longer Mrs Gordon Lim, she cannot
frequent the Tanglin Club. There is no question then of her incurring the
monthly subscription fee (for married couples) of S$170. Further, why would
she a working doctor need to take enrichment classes for (i) French lessons
(S$360 per month); (ii) German lessons (S$840 per month); (iii) Photography
(S$100 per month); (iv) Psychotherapy (S$720 per month) and (v) cookery (S$740
per month)? On top of that she listed as her monthly expenses professional
fees costing S$334.66 (excluding “self-development conferences” and
“conferences fees” for which she claimed another S$2,500 per month). In
contrast to the Wife’s purported monthly expenses of S$31,880.83, the
Husband’s monthly household expenses totalled S$38,427.99. The figure included
S$3,333 or S$40,000 per annum for family travel for five to six persons
(depending on whether Geoffrey joined the trips). It excluded the Husband’s
income tax liability.

87 If (as the Husband surmised), the foreign language courses are to enable
the Wife to communicate better with her boyfriends, it is galling that the
Husband has to pay for them. The Husband had also disagreed that the Wife only
travelled in business class. He said that whenever she did so, she upgraded
from economy class using frequent flyer mileage.

88 Again using the broad brush approach, I am of the view that S$15,000 per
month should comfortably fund the lifestyle the Wife used to enjoy during the
marriage. The Wife should receive a monthly sum of S$5,000 per month as
maintenance on the basis that she can and should earn at least S$10,000 per
month. Bearing in mind her age as well as that of the Husband, the Wife is
awarded 16 years’ maintenance or S$960,000 commuted to a lump sum (SS$5,000 x
192 months). The sum of S$960,000 shall be paid to the Wife from the Husband’s
share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home, less the interim sum of
S$100,000 the court previously ordered the Husband to pay to her.
