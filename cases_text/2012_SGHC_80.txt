Woo Bih Li J:

1 Parties were before me to determine certain issues ancillary to their
divorce. The husband discharged his lawyer after the second hearing and
represented himself thereafter.

2 The defendant (“the husband”) is an eye-surgeon with Australian citizenship;
the plaintiff (“the wife”) is an aesthetics doctor with Singapore citizenship.
They are now both in private practice with their own clinics. Their marriage
began on 17 May 1986 and lasted for 23 years. They have a 19 year old daughter
reading for an undergraduate degree in England, and a 15 year old son studying
at an international school in Singapore.

3 I will now summarise the orders I made on 6 March 2012.

4 I ordered parties to be granted joint custody over the children and granted
the wife sole care and control with reasonable access to the husband. The
terms of access were to be worked out by the parties.

5 As regards the division of matrimonial assets, I granted the wife:

(a) 20% of $1,323,655.19 being the parties’ combined matrimonial assets
(excluding sale proceeds of the matrimonial home and of a property in
Australia (“the Australia house”);

(b) 39% of $886,887 being the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial home; and

(c) 5% of $533,122.52 being the husband’s share of the sale proceeds of the
Australia house.

The husband would be entitled to the balance. Any sum to be paid by the
husband to the wife arising from the division of matrimonial assets may be
set-off against his share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home.

6 (a)I ordered the husband to pay the wife $1 per month from 1 January 2010
for her own maintenance.

(b) I also ordered the husband to pay 60% of the children’s maintenance. I
determined the children’s expenses (excluding school fees) in Singapore to be
$2,000 per month and the husband was to pay the wife 60% thereof amounting to
$1,200 per month from 1 January 2010.

(c) The wife was to reimburse the husband for 40% of the school fees from 1
January 2009. She was also to reimburse the husband 40% of overseas
accommodation and living expenses of the daughter. He was to provide
reasonable documentary evidence of the school fees, accommodation and living
expenses to the wife. Any sum to be paid by the wife for reimbursement may be
set-off against her share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home.

7 Each party was to bear his or her own costs of these ancillary proceedings.

8 The wife has filed an appeal against my decision on the division of
matrimonial assets and on maintenance for herself and for the children. I set
out my reasons below.

The children

9 The children presently live with the wife – the daughter when she is in
Singapore. To their credit, the parties appear to have worked out a mutually
satisfactory arrangement that allows the children to spend enough time with
their father. It was in this context that the husband agreed to give the wife
sole care and control of the children with reasonable access for himself.

Matrimonial property

10 I will deal first with the division of matrimonial assets (not arising from
the sale of real property) and, secondly, the division of the sale proceeds
from the matrimonial home. Thirdly, I will discuss the division of the sale
proceeds from a house in Australia. The goal was to achieve a just and
equitable result, taking into account the factors listed in s 122 of the
Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed).

Matrimonial assets (not arising from the sale of real property)

11 The parties were able to agree on $875,897.19[note: 1] worth of matrimonial
assets, held by either the husband or the wife, by the third hearing on 9
January 2012. This sum excluded a refund of $178,577.79 to the wife’s Central
Provident Fund (“CPF”) account from the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home
which would be taken into account when such sale proceeds are dealt
with.[note: 2]

12 The parties were not able to agree on five items of matrimonial assets. The
first was the valuation of Clinic C, one of the husband’s clinics.[note: 3]
The husband had hired a professional accountant to value his shares in Clinic
C. The accountant’s report was dated 27 April 2011 and valued Clinic C at
$197,758 as at 4 November 2007 and $443,281 as at 12 May 2009. The former
valuation was based on Clinic C’s management accounts for the year ending 30
June 2008. The husband was initially happy to rely on this report in his
affidavit filed on 12 May 2011. At the second hearing on 12 October 2011, I
was informed by lawyers for the husband and wife that they had agreed to use 7
November 2007 (being the date the wife left the matrimonial home) as the date
to value the matrimonial assets. This meant that the parties were adopting the
figure of $197,758 for the value of Clinic C since that value was as at 4
November 2007, which was close enough to 7 November 2007.

13 However at the fifth hearing of 6 March 2012, the husband told me that the
true valuation of Clinic C as at 4 November 2007 was $3,693 instead. He
explained the difference of more than $190,000 on the basis that Clinic C had
taken out a loan to buy medical equipment soon after 4 November 2007. His
business at Clinic C had also been very good from after November 2007 onwards.
So the accounts as of 30 June 2008, which had been used to prepare the
valuation, gave an inflated impression of the actual value of Clinic C as at 4
November 2007. To support his position, the husband tried to adduce a fresh
accountant’s report prepared by the same accountant as before. He said that
the accountant had explained to him that it was standard accounting practice
to use the management accounts for the year ending 30 June 2008 to determine
the value of Clinic C as at 4 November 2007, but he disagreed that this was
the correct approach. Hence the fresh report which was allegedly based on the
accounts as at 4 November 2007. Counsel for the wife, Ms Loo, objected on the
basis that the court should not look behind the earlier accountant’s report.

14 I denied the husband leave to admit the fresh report. As already noted, the
first valuation had been done by the husband’s own accountant. The husband had
been happy at the start to rely on it. So had his former lawyer acting on his
instructions. The husband said that the figure of $197,758 was an alternative
to the other valuation of $449,781 as at 12 May 2009. He said he did not know
that the court might adopt the figure of $197,758. I was of the view that this
was not a valid reason. That figure was mentioned as an alternative for the
court’s possible adoption. Accordingly I based the value of Clinic C on the
accountant’s report of 27 April 2011, this value being $197,758.

15 The second item of disputed matrimonial assets related to the valuation of
Clinic S, which was another of the husband’s clinics.[note: 4] The wife said
its value was $307,797.70, while the husband’s valuation of it was $214,199.
At the hearing on 9 January 2012, Ms Loo and the husband eventually agreed to
the sum of $250,000.

16 I should mention that although the wife has a clinic owned through a
company, Clinic L, this clinic started after 7 November 2007 which was the
cut-off date which both counsel had agreed upon to value the matrimonial
assets, before the husband decided to represent himself. Hence the wife’s
clinic was not taken into account as part of the matrimonial assets.

17 The third and fourth items in dispute were respectively, the value of the
husband’s company [H][note: 5], and $39,337.47 held in Clinic C’s account with
OCBC bank.[note: 6] According to the wife, the quantum of the third item was
the relatively small sum of $2,866.80. During the hearing on 9 January 2012,
Ms Loo agreed to drop the claim to it.

18 In relation to the sum held in Clinic C’s bank account, the wife’s initial
stand was that this sum had not been taken into account by the accountant in
his 27 April 2011 valuation. However Ms Loo eventually accepted that the court
should not look behind the accountant’s valuation and confirmed on 6 March
2012 that the wife would also not be pursuing her claim in relation to Clinic
C’s bank account.

19 The fifth item of dispute was the wife’s credit card liabilities for
October and November 2007, totalling $9,155.36.[note: 7] Ms Loo informed me on
9 January 2012 that these expenses had been incurred because the wife was
moving out of the matrimonial home. However when I looked at the respective
credit card statements, it was plain that the sum of $9,155.36 included
expenses for things as varied as groceries, eating at restaurants, internet
“friendfinder”, hairdressing, clothing, and charitable donations. Neither was
it immediately apparent which items of expenditure related directly to the
cost of moving out. I thus decided that it was not appropriate to take into
account these liabilities in determining the matrimonial assets.

20 Hence the total amount of matrimonial assets was $1,323,655.19. Of this
sum, $1,186,532.08 (89.6%) was held by the husband, and $137,123.11 (10.4%) by
the wife. I attach Annex A which contains details of the matrimonial assets
(excluding proceeds from the sale of real property).

21 The wife asked to keep her share of the matrimonial assets, and 30% of what
the husband held. According to her, she had made significant indirect
financial contributions and non-financial contributions to the family
throughout the marriage. For example, she had financially supported the family
in Australia while the husband had been on a specialist medical training
course from 1990 – 1995, during which period their daughter had been born. She
had also done most of the housework by herself. According to the wife she was
also the primary caregiver of the two children. She stopped working full-time
after the birth of her daughter in 1992 in order to better take care of the
family. She was in charge of the day-to-day care of the children, eg,
supervising their homework, taking them to school and for medical
appointments. She spent most of her free time with the children. She denied
socialising much and said that it was about four or five years after the
family had returned to Singapore and the children were older that she started
to go out with her friends. When the family moved to Singapore in 1995, she
worked part-time till 2007 when she started to work full-time. She said that
she helped to pay for the family’s expenses, although she admitted that the
husband paid for the bulk of it.

22 As regards the fact that the wife had left the matrimonial home in November
2007, the wife said that the tension between the husband and her was getting
intolerable. She did not want her children to be adversely affected especially
before their major exams in 2008 for ‘O’ levels and the primary school leaving
exams respectively. She said that she would call the children every other day
to check on them. She also wanted the children to stay with her on weekdays to
spend time with them and help with their schoolwork but the husband did not
agree to this. It is not disputed that the children went to live with her
about 26 months later from January 2010.

23 The husband submitted that each party should keep 100% of the matrimonial
assets already in his/her hands. His reason was that both parties had invested
equal amounts of non-financial contributions to the marriage. Furthermore, he
had paid for most of the household expenses. He also gave evidence of his
regular payments of $1,000 to $3,000 into a joint bank account which he said
had been used for household expenses.

24 The husband did not accept the wife’s assertions about her substantial non-
financial contributions to the welfare of the family. In particular, he
stressed that she is a spendthrift and a gregarious person and that over the
years she became more interested in her social life than in the family. This
culminated with the wife leaving the children with him in November 2007 when
she left the matrimonial home and he was happy to care for them. He disagreed
that he had refused to let them stay with her until January 2010. He obtained
a report from a private investigator which was submitted by the investigator
to him on 15 April 2008. It showed that over a period of a few days in
December 2007, _ie_ , after the wife had left the matrimonial home, she was
seen partying at two night spots on two separate nights, one a weekday and
another a weekend.

25 It was clear that the main breadwinner in the family had been the husband.
He had provided a home and a comfortable life for the family. I accepted that
the wife was the primary caregiver of the children, especially in their
formative years. As a result the wife had to make certain career sacrifices,
but she did not give up her career entirely. I also accept that there was some
truth in the husband’s allegation that over the years the wife became more
interested in her social life. Furthermore, she left the matrimonial home on 4
November 2007 and the husband was the children’s caregiver for 26 months. I
was of the view that she had no valid reason for leaving the children with the
husband if she had really wanted to have them with her. The husband did not
stop her from achieving any such intention. However, as mentioned above, the
children did live with her from January 2010.

26 In my opinion, it would be just and equitable to award the wife 20% of the
combined matrimonial assets of $1,323,655.19, _ie_ , $264,731.04. Since she
held $137,123.11 of such assets, the husband would have to pay her the
balance, _ie_ , $264,731.04 - $137,123.11 = $127,607.93.

Sale proceeds from the matrimonial home

27 The parties’ matrimonial home in Singapore was bought in 1997 for $650,000,
with a down payment of $126,000. The dispute was on how much of the down
payment the wife had paid. The wife’s contention was not that she had
contributed a specified sum towards the down payment. Instead she argued that
since there was no documentary evidence as to who had paid for the down
payment, a fair and broad brushed approach would be to take both parties as
having contributed equally to the down payment. Importantly however, she had
already acknowledged in Ms Loo’s written submissions (at para 22) filed on 17
August 2011 that the husband had paid for a significant portion of the down
payment although there was no indication from her as to how much of the down
payment the husband had made. Given that admission, I was of the view that she
did not make half of the down payment, and that it was just to conclude that
the husband had paid the entire down payment.

28 If the wife had paid half of the down payment, her direct financial
contribution to acquire the matrimonial home would be 23.7%[note: 8]. She
sought another 30% for her non-financial contributions in the marriage, making
a total of 53.7% of the net sale proceeds.

29 On the other hand, the husband’s position was that the wife should receive
only 20% of the net sale proceeds on the basis that she did not contribute to
the down payment. The husband’s previous lawyer had submitted that if the wife
had not contributed to the down payment, then her direct financial
contribution to acquire the matrimonial home would be 19%.[note: 9] During the
hearing on 6 March 2012, Ms Loo confirmed that she did not dispute this figure
if I were to find, as I did, that the wife did not contribute to the down
payment. In addition, I awarded 20% for the wife’s non-financial
contributions, in particular her care of the children. Therefore I awarded her
a total of 39% of the net sale proceeds of $886,887. The net sale proceeds
comprised a $178,577.79 refund to her CPF account and $708,309.21 held by
certain solicitors as stakeholders. The 39% worked out to $345,885.93. As the
wife had already received $178,577.79 in her CPF account, she was entitled to
$167,308.14 from the stakeholders and the balance of the net sale proceeds was
to be paid to the husband.

Sale proceeds from a house in Australia

30 The husband had bought the Australia house with his sister in 1987 about
one year after the parties’ marriage in May 1986\. According to the husband,
the Australia house had been rented out until 1994, and he had used the rent
and his own money to service a loan secured by a mortgage of the Australia
house. The wife was working in Singapore at the time of the purchase, and she
went to live with him in Australia only in 1989.

31 The husband said that he sold his half-share in the Australia house to his
parents for about A$275,000 in 1996, when he decided to relocate to Singapore.
However, on this point he was not entirely consistent, as he also said at
times that he sold the half-share to his father only. To avoid stamp duty
there was no formal transfer. The husband used the money he received from the
sale to partially pay for their matrimonial home in Singapore. Around 2003 to
2004, the husband’s parents sold the Australia house (the sister had sold them
her half-share in 1989) for about A$1.15m to pay for his mother’s medical
bills. In order to better look after his parents, the husband brought them
over to Singapore and rented an apartment for them. According to the husband,
a sum equivalent to $533,122.52 was then deposited by his parents into his
bank account in Singapore to help defray his expenses in looking after them.
Subsequently, the sum was transferred back to his father’s bank account in
Australia.

32 The husband’s version was challenged by the wife. She said she had helped
him to repay his share of the mortgage, but was unable to provide any
documentary evidence. She also claimed that the husband never sold his
interest in the Australia house to his parents in 1996, and that the
$533,122.52 in fact represented his portion of the proceeds of sale in 2003 or
2004. The wife claimed half of the $533,122.52 which she said was a
matrimonial asset.

33 There was insufficient evidence to support the husband’s claim that he had
sold his half-share in the Australia house to his parents in 1996. Even though
there was no formal transfer in 1996, one would have expected some documents
from the subsequent sale in 2003 or 2004 to suggest that the parents were the
sole beneficiaries of the Australia house. For example, there could have been
a letter to (or from) their Australian professional advisors confirming that
they had acted on the instructions of the parents in the sale, or that they
had been informed by the husband that the sale proceeds belonged to the
parents. There was no evidence as to whose account the sale proceeds were
initially credited into. Furthermore, there was no reason why the parents
could not open a bank account in Singapore in their own names to transfer the
sale proceeds. Accordingly, I was of the view that the husband did retain a
half-share in the Australia house, of which the $533,122.52 represented his
portion of the sale proceeds. The next question was whether the wife had any
claim to this money.

34 I found that the wife had not proved her direct financial contributions for
the Australia house. She did not adduce any documentary evidence and it was
unlikely that she contributed to the payment of any monthly instalment. The
property was bought by the husband and his sister. For the first two years
after the Australia house was bought, the wife remained in Singapore while the
husband resided in Australia. Further, the parties did not live in the
Australia house even when the wife joined the husband in Australia
subsequently. In the circumstances I found it hard to accept the wife’s word
that she had helped to pay for the mortgage. There was also hardly any
evidence as to how her indirect contributions had assisted the husband to
acquire the Australia house. Nevertheless, the Australia house was technically
part of matrimonial assets because it was acquired by the husband after the
parties were married. In the circumstances, I awarded the wife 5% of the
$533,122.52, _ie_ , $26,656.13.

35 I also ordered that any sum to be paid by the husband to the wife arising
from the division of matrimonial assets could be set-off against his share of
the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home.

Maintenance

36 The wife initially asked for maintenance of $10,000 per month for herself
and the children, and for the husband to be solely responsible for the
children’s school fees (which was also referred to as tuition fees).
Eventually, the wife was prepared to bear her own living expenses and those of
her children while they lived with her in Singapore, if the husband paid the
school fees. As the daughter was studying in England and the son in a local
international school, the school fees added up to an estimated sum of about
$100,000 every year. On his part, the husband was not prepared to pay any
maintenance for the wife. As for the children, he initially suggested that the
parties bear the children’s expenses equally, including their school fees.
However, he was prepared to pay 55% with the wife paying 45%. This offer was
rejected by the wife.

37 The wife was earning a substantial income and her earning capacity was
about equal to that of the husband’s. I will elaborate on these points later.
For the time being, I will just say that in view of these points, I ordered
the husband to pay her maintenance of $1 per month from 1 January 2010 so as
to keep alive her option of applying for a variation in the future.

38 The main dispute between the parties on the issue of maintenance for the
children was the school fees. As it was, the children were studying in an
international school in Singapore. The fees would increase if the children
were to study overseas as the daughter was now doing. There would then be
overseas accommodation and living expenses as well.

39 Three reasons led me to conclude that it would not be fair or equitable to
make the husband solely responsible for the school fees. The first reason was
that the wife appeared to have played a part in encouraging the children to
attend an international school in Singapore. She said in her first affidavit
of assets and means filed on 30 April 2009 (at para 45(f)):

... Recently, both the children moved from the local system to [the
international school]. It was I who took the children to talk to a parent
whose child was attending [the international school] and got them interested
in continuing their education there.

40 Yet the wife made a contrary allegation in her later affidavit of assets
and means filed on 2 June 2011 (at para 91):

... The [husband] was aware of the significant difference between the school
fees for [the international school] and local schools. Despite this, and
despite my own preference that the children should attend local schools, the
[husband] insisted on enrolling both children at [the international school].
Since it was done at [husband’s] insistence, the [husband] said he would pay
the children’s international school fees.

In my opinion, this new position was a deliberate attempt by the wife to avoid
her responsibility to bear part of the school fees for an international
school.

41 The second reason was that in 2007 the wife had already offered to pay half
of the school fees. This offer had been made in a letter dated 5 November 2007
sent by her previous solicitors Bih Li & Lee to the husband’s former
solicitors Bajwa & Co. Even then the wife baulked at paying her half share,
suggesting that she had no money to do so. Consequently, Bih Li & Lee wrote on
25 June 2009 to suggest that the husband pay the school fees first. Then in a
letter from the wife’s present solicitors Allen & Gledhill dated 16 June 2010,
the wife made a U-turn. She alleged that parties had agreed that the husband
was to pay (entirely) for the school fees as it was the husband’s wish for the
children to study at an international school. The alleged agreement by the
husband was untrue. It was also untrue that he had insisted that the children
study at an international school which is what the wife was suggesting through
Allen & Gledhill.

42 Ms Loo also tried to persuade me that the earlier offer of 5 November 2007
was limited to local school fees but I saw no reason to see the offer as being
so restricted. There was no such suggestion in the correspondence and the wife
had not alluded to that in her affidavits. Neither did Ms Loo mention this
point earlier when the husband’s previous counsel first stressed the wife’s
agreement on this point.

43 Third, I looked at the earning capacity of the parties.[note: 10] The wife
initially said she earned an income of an average of $10,000 per month. The
husband initially said he earned about $13,750 per month. Both did not seem to
have taken into account the profits their clinics made. From various income
tax assessments, their earning capacities did not seem to be very different.
Indeed, the fact that the wife had offered to pay half of the school fees
suggested that she herself had acknowledged that their earning capacities were
about equal. However as the husband was the one who bore most, if not all, the
expenses in the past, I concluded that it would be fair to order the husband
and wife to bear the school fees in the ratio 60:40 respectively.

44 The husband also asked for an order that the wife reimburse him 40% of the
school fees from 1 January 2009. I allowed the husband’s request and made the
order. Ms Loo then objected on the basis that the earning capacity of the wife
in 2009 had been far lower than the husband’s. I rejected this argument for
the same reasons set out above (at [39] – [42]). I also ordered the wife to
reimburse the husband 40% of the daughter’s accommodation and living expenses
while she was studying in England. The husband was to provide the wife with
reasonable documentary evidence of the daughter’s school fees, accommodation
and living expenses overseas to claim reimbursement from the wife.

45 I also ordered that any sum to be paid by the wife to the husband as
reimbursement may be set-off against her share of the sale proceeds of the
matrimonial home.

46 The last issue I had to decide was the amount that the husband should
contribute towards the children’s living expenses while they were staying in
Singapore with the wife. According to the wife, the personal monthly expenses
for the daughter and son were $755 and $635 respectively.[note: 11] The wife
also asked for the husband’s contribution towards the children’s share of
certain household expenses, for example the $4,300 monthly rent of her
apartment, the $1,300 monthly loan repayment for her car, and $285 for
ERP/carpark fees.[note: 12] I set out in Annexes B and C the wife’s claim for
the children’s monthly personal expenses and for household expenses for all
three of them. It seemed to me that the wife would have incurred many of the
household expenses whether or not she had care and control of the children.
For example, it was not her evidence that she would move to a smaller
apartment if she did not have to take care of the children. My conclusion was
reinforced by the fact that at present the daughter spends a large part of the
year in England. For these reasons and using a broad brush approach, I found
the reasonable personal expenses for each child to be $700 per month (which is
close to what the wife was claiming) and an additional $300 per month for each
child for his/her share of household expenses (including maid expense), making
a total of $2,000 a month. The husband was to pay 60%, _ie_ , $1,200 per month
from 1 January 2010.
