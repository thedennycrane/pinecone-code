Facts

**Amran bin Eusuff (‘Amran’) and Rabu bin Rahmat (‘Rabu’) were jointly charged
with committing an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, read
with s 34 of the Penal Code and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs
Act for trafficking in more than 500 grams of cannabis, in furtherance of a
common intention of them both, by delivering 2174.86 grams of cannabis to an
undercover CNB officer, Mohd Nabil bin Shahar on 3 May 2001.

On 1 May 2001, Corporal Fazuri bin Isnin (‘CPL Fazuri’) of the CNB received
information that a person named "Daud" was looking for a buyer of cannabis.
The next day, he managed to get in contact with Daud and his partner who was
called "Abu". CPL Fazuri posed as a buyer named "Boy" and negotiated with both
of them to purchase 3 kg of cannabis to be delivered on 3 May 2001. On that
date, two CNB officers posed as Boy’s men. These officers met with Amran and
Rabu, who introduced themselves as "Daud" and "Abu" respectively. Both Amran
and Rabu got into a car that the undercover officers were in. The car was
driven to Bukit Merah View where Rabu alighted to collect the drugs. He
returned to the car and handed the drugs to one of the undercover officer. The
CNB officer then signalled to his colleagues to move in to arrest the two
suspects whereupon the undercover car was intercepted. Amran and Rabu tried to
flee but were eventually arrested.

Amran made two long statements to the Investigating Officer. He admitted that
he and Rabu negotiated the sale of cannabis to CPL Fazuri and that he went
with Rabu to deliver the drugs to the undercover CNB officers. He admitted
that he did so for the commission he was promised. As for Rabu, he also made
two long statements to the Investigating Officer. In the first one, he denied
flatly that he was involved in drug trafficking. However, in the second
statement, he admitted that he procured the drugs to sell to Boy.

During the trial, Amran claimed that he did not own the drugs and that he was
entrapped to commit the offence. Rabu argued that he made the statements to
the CNB involuntarily and that he was actually not involved in the trafficking
at all. The trial judge rejected all the defences raised by both accused,
convicted them of drug trafficking and sentenced them to death. Both accused
appealed against his decision.

**

Held

**, dismissing both appeals:

  1. Entrapment is not a valid defence to a criminal charge. The central thesis of our criminal law is that a person who voluntarily, and with the necessary intent, commits all the elements of a criminal offence is guilty of that offence, regardless of whether he was induced to do so. Amran admitted to the offence and could not be exonerated on the grounds of entrapment. (¶ ¶ 29,30)
  2. Rabu’s appeal against conviction was an appeal against the trial judge’s findings of fact. The usual caution that an appellate court should not overturn a trial judge’s finding of fact unless it is clearly wrong, applied. (¶ 32)
  3. The burden was on the prosecution to prove that the statements made by Rabu were made voluntarily. The test for the admissibility of such statements is partly objective and partly subjective. The prosecution must show objectively that there was no threat, inducement or promise. If it failed to prove that, it must show that although there was an objective threat, inducement or promise, it did not actually operate on the mind of the accused in question. (¶ 34)
  4. Reading a previous statement made by an accused person back to him at the start of the recording of another statement to refresh the memory of the accused does not amount to an objective threat. It is a self-induced threat which does not cause a statement to be inadmissible. (¶ 36)
  5. The denial of family visits would not make Rabu more susceptible to making an involuntary and inadmissible statement as compared to other accused persons. Such a measure is necessary during the period of interrogation. (¶ 41)
  6. The trial judge rightly decided that Rabu was not unwell or deprived of food and sleep to the extent that he could not make a voluntary statement (¶ 41)
  7. Amran’s confession was admissible as against Rabu, pursuant to s 30 of the Evidence Act. It was also reliable because Amran implicated himself fully for a serious offence carrying a mandatory death penalty, he did not seek to shift the blame to Rabu and gave evidence which was credible as a whole. (¶ 47)
  8. The evidence against Rabu was overwhelming. His statements to the CNB, Amran’s evidence against him and the independent evidence available clearly pointed to his guilt. (¶ 53)
  9. Under s 33(1), read with the Second Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, the court does not have any judicial discretion to reduce Rabu’s sentence from one of death to life imprisonment. It is irrelevant whether Rabu had been entrapped to commit the offence. (¶¶ 54,55)

The prosecution’s case

_

3 The prosecution presented the following facts. On 1 May 2001, at about 8:30
p.m., an agent contacted Corporal Fazuri Bin Isnin (‘CPL Fazuri’) of the CNB
and informed him that a man named "Daud" was looking for a buyer of cannabis.
CPL Fazuri told the agent to contact Daud to recommend him as a buyer called
"Man Boy". When contacted, Daud asked the agent to relay the message to CPL
Fazuri to call him at telephone number "4688965" the next night to discuss the
deal. This number belonged to a public telephone at a coffeeshop along Sixth
Avenue.

4 On 2 May 2001, at about 8 p.m., CPL Fazuri called Daud at the pre-arranged
number and told him that he wanted to buy 1 kg of cannabis. Daud said he had
to check the stuff and the price first. He called back about ten minutes later
and informed CPL Fazuri that the price would be cheaper if he were to buy 3 kg
of cannabis instead. CPL Fazuri said that he would check with his partner and
call Daud back. About 15 minutes later, CPL Fazuri called and told Daud that
he would take 3 kg if the price was right. Daud said that he wanted $6,000 for
the drugs and CPL Fazuri bargained with him to reduce the price. Daud then
handed the phone over to a person called "Abu". Abu continued the negotiations
with CPL Fazuri and finally agreed to accept $5,000 for the drugs. He told CPL
Fazuri that either he or Daud would contact him the next day to confirm the
time and place of delivery of the drugs.

5 The next day, Daud called CPL Fazuri to arrange a meeting with him later
that evening at the 7-eleven store along Sixth Avenue to collect the drugs.
CPL Fazuri told Daud that he would send his men to meet Daud and Abu. Daud
agreed to the arrangement and told CPL Fazuri that either he or Abu would call
again in the evening for a final confirmation. At 7 p.m., Abu called CPL
Fazuri to tell him that he had only 2.5 kg of cannabis and that it was selling
for $4,400. CPL Fazuri agreed to buy the drugs at that price. He also informed
Abu that the registration number of the car that his men would be driving was
"SZA 5202 M". Abu then told CPL Fazuri to instruct his men to pick Daud and
him up at the 7-eleven store along Sixth Avenue at 7:45 p.m..

6 After the conversation with Abu, CPL Fazuri briefed the CNB officers
involved in the operation to arrest Abu and Daud for trafficking cannabis. The
plan was that Corporal Mohd Nabil Bin Shahar (‘CPL Nabil’) and Sergeant Noor
Aldi bin Alip (‘SGT Aldi’) would act as Man Boy (CPL Fazuri)’s men. They would
drive the car bearing the registration plate of "SZA 5202 M" to meet Daud and
Abu and be led by the pair to another place to collect the drugs. Three other
teams would follow the undercover car in three separate cars. CPL Fazuri would
call CPL Nabil’s handphone just before the latter was due to meet Daud and
Abu. The telephone line would be kept on so that CPL Fazuri could monitor the
conversation in the car. Once the cannabis was handed over, CPL Nabil would
give a pre-arranged signal by saying the words "barang bagus". Upon receiving
this signal, CPL Fazuri would notify the rest of the teams to move in and
arrest the suspects.

7 After the briefing, SGT Aldi drove the undercover car and CPL Nabil was the
front seat passenger. They parked the car near the 7-eleven store at Sixth
Avenue as arranged. At about 7:50 p.m., Amran and Rabu approached their car
and asked if they were sent by Man Boy. Amran then introduced himself as
"Daud" and Rabu said he was "Abu". Both men entered the car. Daud sat behind
CPL Nabil and Abu sat behind SGT Aldi. Amran then instructed SGT Aldi to
proceed to Bukit Merah View and stop along the road in front of Block 117,
Bukit Merah View. During the drive, Rabu did not say anything but Amran asked
CPL Nabil if he had the money for the drugs. When the car stopped, Rabu
alighted on his own accord and crossed the road. He headed towards Block 123,
Bukit Merah View and was out of sight of the people in the car. While Rabu was
collecting the drugs, Daud told CPL Nabil that the stuff was still wet which
meant that the drugs were good.

8 About five minutes later, Rabu reappeared with a yellow paper bag in his
hands. SGT Aldi made a U-turn to pick him up. Rabu handed the bag over to CPL
Nabil and when he saw that the bag contained some bundles, he said "barang
bagus". As arranged, the rest of the CNB officers moved in to effect the
arrest of Amran and Rabu. One team’s car intercepted the undercover car. When
the undercover car stopped, both men ran out and tried to escape. They put up
a violent struggle to evade arrest and suffered minor injuries in the course
of their struggle. However, both were eventually subdued and arrested by the
CNB officers.

9 The suspects were brought to a carpark near Delta Swimming Complex where
Inspector Senthil Kumaran (‘Insp Senthil’) recorded their oral statements.
Amran admitted that he knew that the yellow paper bag contained 2.5 kg of
"ganja" or cannabis. However, he said that the drugs belonged to Rabu and that
they were for "Boy". He admitted that he arranged for Rabu to sell the drugs
to "Boy". On the other hand, Rabu said that the contents of the yellow paper
bag were Amran’s. He claimed that he did not know what was inside the bag.

10 After that, CNB officers proceeded to search the homes of Amran and Rabu.
However, Amran’s residence had already been demolished and nothing
incriminating was found in Rabu’s home. Subsequently, the suspects were
brought to the Jurong Police Regional Headquarters for their urine tests. At
about 2:15 p.m., Amran and Rabu were brought to the Major Investigation Branch
(‘MIB’) of the CNB.

11 At the MIB, Insp Senthil briefed Assistant Superintendent Daniel Tan (‘ASP
Tan’), the Investigating Officer of the case. CPL Nabil also handed the yellow
paper bag over to ASP Tan who weighed the drugs in the presence of the
suspects and locked them in his metal cabinet. ASP Tan instructed the
arresting officers to bring the suspects for a pre-statement medical
examination. When Amran and Rabu returned to MIB that night, ASP Tan served
them both a copy of the charge against them and a Notice of Warning under
section 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Between about 4 a.m. to 4:42
a.m., he recorded down their cautioned statements separately. Rabu denied that
he knew what was in the yellow paper bag while Amran stated that it was Rabu
who owned the drugs. Then, he instructed his men to bring the two suspects for
their post statement medical examination and left for home.

12 Dr. John Chiam (‘Dr. Chiam’) of the Alexandra Hospital conducted the pre
statement medical examination for both Amran and Rabu. He testified that he
found recent abrasions on the forehead, nose, right cheek and lip of Amran. As
for Rabu, he found a bruise on his forehead and his right hand and back as
well as an abrasion on his left shoulder. Dr. Tan Sing Huang, also a doctor at
the Alexandra Hospital, conducted the post statement medical examination. She
found seven injuries on Amran instead of the four found by Dr. Chiam. However,
she found approximately the same injuries noted by Dr. Chiam on Rabu. She also
testified that both Amran and Rabu did not complain to her that any CNB
officer has assaulted them.

13 When ASP Tan returned to MIB on 4 May 2001, he took the drug exhibits
pertaining to the case to the Centre for Forensic Science (‘CFS’) and handed
it over to Dr Lui Chi Pang for analysis. Subsequently, ASP Tan received six
certificates from the CFS which revealed that the drugs recovered from Amran
and Rabu in the yellow paper bag were 2174.86 grams of cannabis.

14 Dr. Ann Young, also an analyst with the CFS testified that Iskandar
Zulkarnain Bin Abd Aziz handed the urine samples of Amran and Rabu for
analysis on 4 May 2001\. She found that Rabu, but not Amran, tested positive
for cannabis consumption. Another analyst with the CFS, Dr Natarajan also gave
evidence that he received the urine sample of Rabu on 4 May 2001 from Iskandar
Zulkarnian. Upon analysis, he found that Rabu’s urine sample contained
cannabis.

15 Lastly, the prosecution relied on the long statements made by Amran and
Rabu to show that both were involved in trafficking cannabis. Amran made a
long statement on 8 May 2001 and a further one on 15 May 2001. In the
statement recorded on 8 May 2001, he described the events of 2 and 3 May 2001
as the following: On 2 May 2001, he spoke with Boy and told him that he could
obtain some cannabis for him. On 3 May 2001, he and Rabu contact Boy to
negotiate the sale of the cannabis. When Rabu reached an agreement with Boy,
Rabu passed the phone to him. At this point, Boy informed him that his men
would pick him and Rabu up at about 7:45 p.m. that night to collect the drugs.
When the car arrived, Rabu and him got in. The car drove to Bukit Merah View
where Rabu left to collect the drugs. Shortly after that, the car was
intercepted and he was arrested. In his statement recorded on 15 May 2001, he
admitted that he promised Boy to get the drugs for him because he wanted the
commission that Boy promised him badly.

16 Rabu made a long statement on 9 May 2001. He denied that he was involved in
the negotiations for the sale of the cannabis. He admitted that, on 3 May
2001, he followed Amran into the undercover car. Furthermore, he admitted that
when the car reached Bukit Merah View, he left the car to collect a yellow
paper bag from another person waiting at Block 123, Bukit Merah View. However,
Rabu denied that he knew what was in the bag. He claimed that he merely
followed Amran’s instructions to collect the bag.

17 However, in his long statement recorded on 15 May 2001, Rabu changed his
story. He admitted that he was involved in procuring and selling the cannabis
to CPL Fazuri. His version of what happened on 3 May 2001 was the following:
that day, Amran asked him whether he could obtain some cannabis for him and he
replied that he would try. At about 7:15 p.m., Amran asked him to talk to Boy
who wanted 3 kg of cannabis. Rabu said that he would try to get the drugs and
subsequently, he contacted a person called "Daud" (not Amran), whom he met in
Batam previously. Daud told him that he could supply him with 2.5 kg of
cannabis at $4,400. Rabu then informed Amran who in turn told Boy that only
2.5 kg of cannabis was available. Boy agreed to both the quantity and price.
Rabu also knew that Amran had been promised a commission for setting up the
sale.

_

  
Amran’s case

_

18 Amran did not dispute most of the prosecution’s case. In his defence, he
testified that he did not own the drugs and that he was entrapped into
committing the offence. However, in his closing submissions, Mr. Luke Lee,
counsel for Amran, conceded that entrapment was not a defence to the charge.
Furthermore, Mr. Lee conceded that Amran had admitted to all the essential
facts constituting the charge even though he denied ownership of the drugs.
Ownership was not an essential element of drug trafficking. Amran pleaded for
leniency in court but Mr. Lee also conceded that no leniency was possible
since Amran was charged with an offence that was punishable with a mandatory
death penalty.

_

  
Rabu’s case

_

19 Rabu’s gave the following version of the facts in court: He went to Batam
on 30 April 2001 and returned to Singapore on 2 May 2001, arriving at the
World Trade Centre at about 8 p.m.. He had his dinner at the hawker centre
near the World Trade Centre and returned home after that. He did not go to the
coffeeshop at Sixth Avenue or speak to Boy that day. He pointed out that Boy
spoke to a person called "Abu" and testified that he was not "Abu" since he
was never known by that name.

20 On 3 May 2001, he did go to the coffeeshop at Sixth Avenue at about 5 p.m..
Amran arrived at the coffeeshop at about 7:15 p.m. but they did not speak to
each other until Amran had finished with his telephone call. Amran told him
that his friends would be coming to the coffeeshop in a car and that they were
proceeding to Bukit Merah View. He was invited to come along with Amran and he
did so because he thought that Amran wanted to give him some tips about racing
horses. He did not ask Amran any other questions about the purpose of the
trip. He testified that he introduced himself as "Rabu" to Amran’s "friends",
i.e. the undercover CNB officers. During the journey, there was no mention
about drugs. He did not talk to the CNB officers. It was Amran who instructed
the officers to proceed to Bukit Merah View.

21 When the car reached its destination, Amran asked him to go to Block 123 to
collect a plastic bag. He decided to collect the bag as a favour to Amran.
Thus, he went to the void deck of Block 123 where he met a man, called
"Ahmad", whom he had never seen before. Ahmad refused to tell him what he
promised to give Amran and Rabu did not press the issue. He followed Ahmad to
the landing between the second and third floor. Ahmad then took a paper bag
that was tied up from a heap of rubbish and handed it to him. He took the bag
without opening it and gave it to Amran in the car. Rabu testified that he did
not know the contents of the bag.

22 When he entered the car, SGT Aldi drove off. In the car, Amran handed the
paper bag to the front seat passenger. Rabu gave evidence that he only
realised that the bag contained cannabis when the front seat passenger opened
up the bag and he smelt the drugs. He heard the front seat passenger say
"barang bagus". Soon after that, the car was intercepted. Rabu suspected that
CNB officers were conducting arrests and he attempted to flee because he
thought he might be implicated for drug trafficking or at the very least for
drug consumption. He had consumed cannabis while he was in Batam. However, he
was eventually arrested.

23 This version of the facts contradicted his long statement to the CNB
recorded on 15 May 2001. In court, Rabu claimed that the contents of that long
statement, together with his statement that was recorded on 9 May 2001, were
inaccurate because he had made them involuntarily.

24 A _voir dire_ was conducted. Rabu alleged that he was suffering from a
toothache and was not feeling well. He testified that he suffered from a lack
of sleep and missed his family. In addition, when he made the statement on 15
May 2001, ASP Tan read the statement made on 9 May 2001 and he felt that this
was a signal that he must give a different answer when he recorded the later
statement. Furthermore, he alleged that ASP Tan told him that if he co-
operated, his sentence for the offence may be reduced. For these reasons, he
contended that his statement was involuntary as they were made as a result of
a threat or inducement. He alleged that ASP Tan did not record the full facts
and contended that the accurate version of the facts was that he did not know
anything about the drug deal or the contents of the paper bag that he
collected.

_

  
The decision below

_

25 Tay JC decided that the prosecution had proven its case against Amran
beyond reasonable doubt. He found that Amran’s version of the facts coincided
with essentially all of the prosecution’s case. It was immaterial that Amran
did not own the drugs. In addition, he dismissed Amran’s defence of entrapment
because such a defence was unavailable in Singapore. In any case, he found
that Amran participated voluntarily in the drug deal.

26 The judge also concluded that the totality of evidence put it beyond
reasonable doubt that Rabu was guilty of trafficking cannabis. The judge
decided that Rabu made the statements to the CNB on the 9 and 15 May 2001
voluntarily. He relied on the statement made on 15 May 2001 as evidence that
Rabu knew about and became involved in selling Boy 2.5. kg of cannabis. He
accepted the testimony of ASP Tan and Ms. Sofia, the Malay interpreter who was
present during the recording of both statements in question. Both emphatically
denied that any threat, inducement or promise were offered to Rabu during the
recording of his statements. The judge also accepted Amran’s testimony that
Rabu was actively involved in the trafficking. He applied section 30 of the
Evidence Act and _Chin Seow Noi & Ors. v PP _[1994] 1 SLR 135 to admit Amran’s
oral evidence and written statements as against Rabu as these amounted to
confessions by Rabu’s co-accused. Lastly, the judge held that Rabu’s conduct
on 3 May 2001 was more consistent with the prosecution’s case that Rabu was
aware that a drugs deal was taking place.

_

  
The appeal

Amran’s appeal

_

27 _****_ In his Petition of Appeal, Amran appealed against the judge’s
findings of fact that he directed the undercover car to Bukit Merah View and
that he sat behind the driver during the journey. He also contended that he
was entrapped to commit the offence.

28 However, before us, Counsel for Amran stated that he had advised his client
that the appeal was unlikely to succeed. We agreed. Amran had already admitted
to all the essential elements of the charge against him by his own evidence,
in court as well as in his statements to the CNB. He gave evidence that he
facilitated the sale between Abu and CPL Fazuri of 2.5 kg of cannabis at
$4,400 to obtain a commission which he badly wanted. He also took part in the
delivery of the drugs by going with Rabu and the undercover CNB officers to
Bukit Merah View to collect the drugs. Amran did not dispute all these facts
in this appeal.

29 In addition, the defence of entrapment was obviously unavailable to
exonerate Amran from liability. It is trite law that entrapment is not a valid
defence to a charge. In _How Poh Sun v PP_[1991] 1 SLR 220, another case on
drug trafficking where the defence of entrapment was raised, this court held
at p 224:

> The observation of the Law Lords that the defences of agent provocateur and
> entrapment do not exist in English law would also reflect the position in
> Singapore. It is not the province of the court to consider whether the CNB
> should have proceeded about its work in one way or the other. The court can
> only be concerned with the evidence before it

30 The rationale for this position was elaborated in _SM Summit Holdings v
PP_[1997] 3 SLR 922, 937 in the following terms:

> _
>
> Sang
>
> _ and the line of Singapore cases following _Sang_(e.g. _PP v Rozman bin
> Jusoh and Razali bin Mat Zin_[1995] 3 SLR 317, _Ajmer Singh v PP_[1986] SLR
> 454, _Chan Chi Pun v PP_[[1994] 2 SLR 61; _How Poh Sun v PP_[1991] 1 SLR
> 220) have held that entrapment is not a substantive defence to a charge of a
> criminal offence. This is not surprising since it is _a central thesis of
> our criminal law that a person who voluntarily, and with the necessary
> intent, commits all the element of a criminal offence is guilty of that
> offence, regardless of whether he was induced to act_ by another, whether a
> private citizen or law enforcement officer __

31 In conclusion, we found that the trial judge had rightly convicted Amran of
the charge against him since Amran had admitted to voluntarily committing all
the elements of drug trafficking. The fact that he was induced to act by a law
enforcement officer could not exonerate him from his guilt.

_

  
Admissibility of Rabu’s statements to the CNB

_

32 In his appeal, Rabu sought to revisit the issue on whether he had made the
statements on 9 and 15 May 2001 to the CNB voluntarily. The appeal on this
matter was purely factual. The usual caution that an appellate court should
not overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact unless they are _clearly_ wrong
applies (_Ng Ai Tiong v PP_[2000] 1 SLR 454).

33 The law governing the admissibility of these statements was not in dispute.
Section 24 of the Evidence Act governs the admissibility of confessions made
to CNB officers. It reads:

> A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal
> proceeding if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been
> caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge
> against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and
> sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds
> which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he
> would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference
> to the proceeding against him.

34 In _Gulam bin Notan v PP_[1999] 1 SLR 26, the Court of Appeal restated the
law on the admissibility of confessions made to CNB officers. The court held
that the prosecution had the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the
confession was made voluntarily although it need not remove "every lurking
shadow of influence or remnants of fear". The court described the test of
voluntariness as a partly objective and partly subjective one. The prosecution
must prove objectively that there was no threat, inducement or promise, i.e.
there were no circumstances that made it reasonable for an accused to suppose
that he would gain some advantage for himself or avoid some evil of a temporal
nature to himself if he made the statement. If the prosecution failed to prove
this, it must then show beyond reasonable doubt that although there was
objectively a threat, inducement or promise, it did not actually operate on
the mind of the accused in question.

35 In his appeal, Rabu placed strong reliance on the trial judge’s finding
that ASP Tan had asked Ms. Sofia to read his earlier statement back to him at
the beginning of the recording of the later statement. First, he argued that
this itself constituted a threat which Rabu had actually succumbed to.
Secondly, he argued that because ASP Tan had previously made such a threat, it
was likely that ASP Tan had also offered a lighter sentence to Rabu if he co-
operated. He also urged the Court to consider that he was particularly
susceptible to any inducements or threats because he was unwell and was
deprived of food, sleep and family visits.

36 The trial judge dealt with all these arguments comprehensively. He found
that there was nothing sinister about reading Rabu’s earlier statement back to
him at the beginning of the recording to refresh his memory. We agreed that
such a situation could not amount to a threat objectively. It is not
reasonable for an accused person to believe that he will avoid some evil of a
temporal nature to himself by making an incriminating statement merely because
the investigating officer reads back his previous statement. An accused who
views the reading back of his own statement as a threat must clearly be
labouring under his own delusions. It is trite law that such self-induced
threats will not cause a statement made pursuant to it to be inadmissible.

37 At this juncture, we would deal with Rabu’s argument that the trial judge
had erred in finding that ASP Tan did not offer him an inducement of a lighter
sentence if he co-operated. Rabu contended that since ASP Tan caused Ms. Sofia
to threaten him by reading his previous statement back to him, it was probable
that ASP Tan also offered him an inducement and the judge should have found in
his favour. This argument clearly involved a leap of logic and we rejected it.
Even if ASP Tan did threaten Rabu once (which clearly had not been shown on
the facts), it did not necessarily imply that he offered another separate
inducement as well. No other reasons were raised to show that the judge was
clearly wrong in finding that ASP Tan had not offered a lighter sentence to
Rabu if he co-operated.

38 Finally, we also rejected Rabu’s argument that he had made the statements
in question involuntarily because he was "not fit" to make those statements
when they were recorded. Rabu claimed that he was unwell and complained that
he was deprived of food, sleep and family visits. In his written submissions,
Counsel for Rabu argued that these circumstances made Rabu more susceptible to
any form of threat or inducement held out to him. He urged the Court to find
that the statement were made involuntarily because he actually felt that he
was threatened and offered inducements to make them.

39 We rejected this argument on two grounds. First, it was unnecessary to
consider whether the circumstance actually operated on Rabu when he made the
statement (the subjective limb). Rabu did not raise a reasonable doubt that an
inducement or a threat that would reasonably affect an accused and cause such
a person to make statements involuntarily did not exist (the objective limb).
Under _Gulam bin Notan v PP_ , it was unnecessary to consider the subjective
limb of the test of voluntariness when the objective limb of the test had not
been met.

40 Secondly, the facts that Rabu sought to rely on to prove that he was more
susceptible to any inducement had not been proven. In the trial below, the
judge had the advantage of observing ASP Tan and Ms. Sofia and preferred their
testimonies about the conduct of the recording of Rabu’s statements. He noted
particularly, that Ms. Sofia had no interest in ensuring that Rabu made an
incriminating statement. The judge accepted the evidence of ASP Tan and Ms.
Sofia that Rabu did not appear unwell and that he said nothing about feeling
unwell or being unable to carry on with the statements at anytime. He was also
satisfied that Rabu had not been deprived of food or sleep to such an extent
that he could not comprehend what was going on during the recording of the
statement. As for Rabu’s complaint about his toothache, the judge found that
the tooth problem only featured after the recording of the two statements in
issue.

41 In the present appeal, Rabu failed to raise any grounds to show that the
judge was _clearly wrong_ in his assessment of the witnesses and evidence
before him. Consequently, we affirmed the trial judge findings of fact on this
issue. Furthermore, although Rabu had been denied family visits, this would
not make him more susceptible to inducements compared to any other accused
person since the deprivation of family visits is necessary during the period
of interrogation. Rabu had no basis to argue that he was more susceptible to
an inducement or threat because he felt unwell and was deprived of food, sleep
and family visits.

42 In summary, we concluded that none of Rabu’s contentions to support his
argument that he made the statements on the 9 and 15 May 2001 involuntarily
were valid. We agreed that the trial judge rightly admitted and gave due
weight to these statements.

_

  
Admissibility and weight of the confessions of a co-accused

_

43 Rabu also appealed against the decision of the trial judge to accept
Amran’s evidence. The law on confessions of a co-accused is clear. Section 30
of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) reads:

> When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence and
> a confession made by one such persons affecting himself and some other of
> such person is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession
> as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the
> confession

44 In _Chin Seow Noi v PP_[1994] 1 SLR 135, the Court of Appeal held that the
natural construction of s 30 meant that the confession of a co-accused may be
made part of the substantive evidence against the accused in the same manner
it formed part of the evidence against the confessing co-accused. The court
noted that a co-accused’s confession may not always be reliable because the
maker of the statement may lie to shift the blame on the other accused.
However, this went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.

45 Amran’s oral evidence and written statements to the CNB amounted to
confessions since, by them, he had admitted to the essential elements of drug
trafficking. Pursuant to s 30 of the Evidence Act, these confessions were
admissible and could be taken into consideration against Rabu.

46 Amran gave evidence that Rabu was aware of the drug deal, negotiated it and
went with him into the undercover car to obtain delivery of the drugs to sell
to Boy. Rabu argued that this evidence should be rejected because it was
unreliable. Amran had an incentive to lie and shift the blame on Rabu since he
believed that he could obtain leniency from the Court.

47 We did not accept this argument. In his confessions, Amran implicated
himself fully for a serious offence that carried the mandatory death penalty.
He accepted his own role in the matter fully. Although Amran did dispute the
fact that he gave directions to the CNB officers to go to Bukit Merah View,
this was merely a minor discrepancy. In the rest of his testimony, Amran did
not seek to push the blame onto Rabu to lessen his role in the offence.
Amran’s evidence was convincing and credible as a whole. The judge had the
opportunity to observe both Amran and Rabu on the stand and chose to believe
Amran’s version of the facts as stated in his confession. Rabu failed to show
that the judge obviously erred in his assessment of the weight of Amran’s
confession.

_

  
Independent evidence against Rabu

_

48 The trial judge found that there was sufficient independent evidence to
convict Rabu. Rabu contended that the judge made two main errors of fact. The
first error was finding that he took part in the negotiations with CPL Fazuri
to sell the drugs. Secondly, he argued that the judge wrongly found that he
knew the true purpose of the journey in the undercover car and the contents of
the yellow paper bag.

49 The judge’s findings were clearly supportable. Rabu argued that he could
not have taken part in the negotiations with CPL Fazuri on 2 May 2001 at about
8 p.m. at the coffeeshop at Sixth Avenue. This was because he had just arrived
in Singapore from Batam. However, the prosecution produced documentary proof
in the form of the records kept by the Singapore Immigration and Registration
to show that Rabu had disembarked from the ferry at the World Trade Centre
Terminal at 7:32 p.m.. It was _possible_ for him to be at Sixth Avenue at
about 8 p.m. since would take less than half an hour to get from World Trade
Centre to Sixth Avenue by cab. The trial judge had a proper basis for
believing Amran’s testimony that Rabu was at the coffeeshop on 2 May 2001 and
that Rabu took part in the negotiations for the drugs deal with CPL Fazuri. It
also followed that the judge’s finding that Rabu was the "Abu" who spoke to
CPL Fazuri that day could not be seriously challenged.

50 The judge’s finding that Rabu knew the true purpose of the journey to Bukit
Merah View also could not be faulted. Rabu claimed that he did not know that
the people in the undercover car intended to obtain drugs at Bukit Merah View.
He testified that he was simply accompanying Amran on a journey with unknown
men so that Amran could talk to him about horses. The judge found this
explanation incredulous. It was illogical for a fully-grown up man to go along
with Amran to Bukit Merah View with strangers without even first enquiring
about the purpose or the length of time that they would stay there. In any
case, there was no talk about horses and it was inconceivable that a person
expecting to talk about horses would later just sit in the car silently while
Amran and the front seat passenger continued talking. The judge drew the
inference that Rabu’s conduct in the car was much more consistent with someone
who already knew the purpose of the trip and who needed no explanation from
anyone. In light of the evidence, this inference was perfectly justifiable.

51 Furthermore, other than Amran, CPL Nabil and SGT Aldi testified that when
the car reached Bukit Merah View, Rabu alighted _on his own accord_ to collect
the paper bag. The judge chose to believe these witnesses over Rabu. The Notes
of Evidence did not show that the judge was clearly wrong to accept the
testimonies of the CNB officers that Rabu acted on his own accord to collect
the yellow paper bag.

52 Rabu’s attempt to evade arrest was also consistent with his knowledge of
what has been going on. He explained that he bolted because he feared being
caught for drug consumption. On appeal, he added that he tried to escape to
avoid the beatings by the CNB officers who were trying to effect his arrest.
However, in view of the totality of the evidence, the true reason for his
attempt to evade arrest for drug trafficking was that he knew that the yellow
paper bag that he delivered to Boy’s men contained cannabis.

53 The evidence against Rabu was overwhelming. His statements to the CNB, the
independent evidence available and Amran’s testimony against him painted a
consistent picture that he was heavily involved in the drug transaction on 3
May 2001. He negotiated with CPL Fazuri for the sale of the drugs and he
contacted the supplier in Batam to provide the drugs. On the 3 May 2001, he
and Amran entered the undercover car to go to Bukit Merah View to collect the
drugs. Upon reaching the destination, he got down on his own accord and went
to pick up the drugs from the supplier, brought it back to the car and passed
them to Amran who in turn delivered it to CPL Nabil. We found that his appeal
against conviction was devoid of merits and we upheld his conviction.

_

  
Sentencing

_

54 Counsel for Rabu also made submissions on Rabu’s sentence at the end of his
oral submission. He suggested that if the Court intended to uphold Rabu’s
conviction, it should exercise its judicial discretion to reduce Rabu’s
sentence from one of death to life imprisonment. He submitted that the Court
should consider the fact that Rabu was entrapped into committing the offence
as a mitigating factor in sentencing him.

55 This argument was totally misconceived and we rejected it. Section 33(1)
read with the Second Schedule of the Act prescribes a _mandatory_ death
sentence for persons convicted under s 5(1)(a) of the Act for trafficking more
than 500 grams of cannabis. There was no room for judicial discretion in
sentencing in the face of the clear wording of the section.

_

  
Conclusion

_

56 For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeals of Amran and Rabu and
upheld their convictions and sentences.
