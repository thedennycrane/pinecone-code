Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):

1 In our judgment dated 28 May 2004 at [2004] SGCA 23, we allowed the
defendant-appellant’s appeal and thereby dismissed the plaintiff-respondent’s
claim for breach of contract against the appellant. We also awarded costs to
the appellant in respect of the appeal and the trial below.

2 Further to our judgment, on 10 June 2004, the solicitors for the appellant
wrote to inform us that the appellant had, on 4 September 2002, made an offer
to settle (“OTS”) (_ie_ to pay to the respondent the sum of S$60,000, with
each party to bear its own costs). The validity of the OTS was not restricted
as to any period of time. It was never withdrawn and was still on the table as
at the date of our judgment. The solicitors for the appellant thus sought
indemnity costs pursuant to O 22A r 9 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
1997 Rev Ed).

3 Counsel for the appellant also informed us that at the date the OTS was
made, the parties had only completed discovery. The affidavits of evidence-in-
chief were only filed by the respondent on 11 November 2002, more than two
months later. So, costs in that regard could not have been incurred yet. The
solicitors for the respondent have not written in to dispute the foregoing.

4 In the light of the circumstances outlined above, and bearing in mind the
views expressed by this court in _Man B &W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd v PT Bumi
International Tankers_ _(No 2)_ [2004] SGCA 22 as to the application of O 22A
r 9, we are of the opinion that the appellant should be entitled to indemnity
costs as from the date of the OTS. In the circumstances of this case, the OTS
was a serious and genuine offer. We accordingly modify our earlier order on
costs and grant indemnity costs to the appellant.
