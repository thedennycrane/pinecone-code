**Judgment:**

1\. This was an appeal by S3 Building Services Pte Ltd (the appellant) against
the decision of Woo Bih Li JC, in which he allowed the appeal from the
decision of the registrar refusing the application by Sky Technology Pte Ltd,
the respondent (the respondent) for an extension of time to file the
affidavits of evidence-in-chief of witnesses and exchange them with the
appellant, and striking out the defence and dismissing the counterclaim with
costs. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons. _**

Background facts

**_

2\. The relevant facts giving rise to the appeal were briefly these. On 25
November 2000, the appellant instituted this action against the respondent,
seeking an order for the rescission of an agreement whereby the respondents
agreed to assign certain patent rights to the appellant on the terms and
conditions therein stated. The basis of the claim, among others, was that the
respondent had intentionally suppressed material information relating to the
patent rights. Soon after the commencement of the action, the appellant took
out an application for summary judgment. At the hearing thereof before an
assistant registrar on 15 January 2001, the respondent was granted
unconditional leave to defend. On 31 January 2001, the respondent served its
defence and counterclaim. The appellant appealed against the decision of the
assistant registrar and the appeal was heard on 13 February 2001 before Lai
Siu Chiu J. She dismissed the appeal. Not contented with the decision, the
appellant, on 27 February 2001, applied for hearing of further arguments. That
application appeared to be belated, as the time for such application had
expired. Nonetheless, the application was acceded to by Lai J, and 5 March
2001 was fixed for the hearing of further arguments.

3\. In the meantime, on 28 February 2001, the parties appeared before the
registrar for directions, and at that hearing the registrar made, inter alia,
the following directions:

> (a) The affidavits of evidence-in-chief of witnesses to be called were to be
> exchanged between the parties by 30 March 2001 and objections thereto were
> to be taken by 6 April 2001.
>
> (b) Leave was granted to the respondent to adduce the oral evidence at the
> trial of a representative from Allen & Gledhill, and a representative from
> Chu Chan Gan & Ooi.
>
> (c) The trial be fixed for five days from 27 April 2001 to 4 May 2001 and
> the action be set down by 9 April 2001.

4\. On 5 March 2001, the parties appeared before Lai J for the hearing of
further arguments. At the conclusion, the judge altered her previous decision
and ordered that the respondent be given only conditional leave to defend the
appellants claim instead. The condition imposed was that the respondent was to
provide security in the sum of S$600,000 for the appellants claim by 26 March
2001\.

5\. On 16 March 2001, the respondent filed an appeal against Lai Js decision
and applied for the hearing of the appeal to be expedited. The application was
allowed, and in consequence the appeal was heard on 22 March 2001. The appeal
was unsuccessful, but the court granted to the respondent an extension of two
weeks from the original deadline of 26 March 2001 to provide the security in
the sum of S$600,000.

6\. Thereafter, the respondent and its solicitors attempted to prepare the
affidavits of evidence-in-chief of the witnesses for the trial to meet the
deadline of 30 March 2001, but did not succeed in so doing. On Friday, 30
March 2001, the appellants solicitors sent a fax to the respondents solicitors
requesting for a time to be fixed for the exchange of the affidavits. The
respondents solicitors sought an extension of time from the solicitors for the
appellant on the ground that Ms Winnie Tham of Allen & Gledhill, one of the
witness they intended to call, was overseas. The solicitors for the appellants
refused. There followed an exchange of correspondence and no agreement was
reached between the parties. The appellant took out an application to strike
out the defence and counterclaim. The respondent, on its part, applied for an
extension of time to 14 April 2001 to file and exchange the affidavits of
evidence-in-chief.

7\. On 4 April 2001, both the applications were heard before the registrar.
The registrar refused the respondents application for an extension of time and
allowed the appellants application, and consequently ordered that the defence
be struck out and counterclaim dismissed with costs, and that judgment for the
appellant be entered. On the same day, the respondent filed an appeal to a
judge in chambers, and the appeal was heard before Woo Bih Li JC on 10 April
2001. He allowed the appeal. From that decision, the appellant appealed to
this Court.

_**The appeal**_

8\. We considered first the reasons given by the respondent in the application
for an extension of time before the registrar. In the affidavit filed in
support of the application, Mr Lim Yeow Bing, the intellectual property and
contracts director of the respondent, said in 4 the following:

> 4\. The directions provided a short time frame for the preparation of the
> affidavits. Meanwhile, the Defendants efforts to prepare the affidavits
> expeditiously have been affected by the following circumstances:-
>

>> (a) The Plaintiff obtained leave, subsequent to the giving of the
directions, to make further arguments before Justice Lai Siu Chiu in respect
of her earlier dismissal of their appeal for summary judgment. The further
arguments were heard on 5 March 2001 and, at the end of a lengthy hearing, the
learned Judge gave conditional leave to defend.

>>

>> (b) The Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the learned
Judges order, and the appeal was heard on an expedited basis on 22 March 2001.
The appeal was unsuccessful. Much of the Defendants attention and effort were
taken up by the hearing of the further arguments and the appeal.

>>

>> (c) The Defendant had also previously indicated that they may call a lawyer
from M/s Allen & Gledhill to testify. In this regard, Ms Winnie Tham of M/s
Allen & Gledhill, who acted for the Defendant in the subject patent
application, has been out of the country since 23rd March 2001 and is
understood that she will only return to Singapore after 4 April 2001.

9\. The judge below held that the true reason for the delay was not given in
the application for the extension of time and thus the conduct of the
appellant was unsatisfactory, and further, that the delay was unjustified. The
judge said at 61:

> 61\. The truth of the matter was that Rodyk & Davidson and Sky Technology
> had used the absence of Winnie Tham to seek an EOT [extension of time] when
> the real reason was something else. To this extent, their conduct was
> unsatisfactory.

Later, the judge said at 64-66:

> 64. The true reason for the delay was that Rodyk & Davidsons time and
> attention had been taken up and distracted by the hearings before Lai J and
> the Court of Appeal in respect of the application for summary judgment and
> conditional leave. They had misjudged the time required to prepare the
> AEICs.
>
> 65. Although I had some sympathy for the situation they found themselves to
> be in, the true reason was still not satisfactory. After all, S3s AEICs were
> ready by 30 March 2001.
>
> 66. Hence, the delay was unjustified.

10\. We had some difficulty in accepting the findings the judge made in this
part of his judgment. First, with respect, we did not agree with his finding
that the respondents had used the absence of Ms Winnie Tham to seek an
extension of time when the true reason was something else. Mr Lim, in his
affidavit, gave what the judge later said were the true reasons for the delay
and these included the absence of Ms Winnie Tham as one of the reasons. It is
true that in seeking an agreement from the appellants solicitors for the
extension of time, Mr Lok Vi Meng, the solicitor for the appellant, gave only
one reason for the delay: that is, that Ms Winnie Tham was out of the country.
That was rather unfortunate, but not fatal. What was more important, surely,
must be what the respondent relied on as the true reasons for the delay at the
hearing before the registrar. These were given by Mr Lim in his affidavit
filed in support of the application, the relevant part of which we have quoted
above. We certainly did not find anything wanting in respect of what was said
there. Nor did we find the conduct of the respondent unsatisfactory.

11\. Secondly, with respect, we did not find that the delay was unjustified.
The summons for directions before the registrar was heard only on 28 February
2001 and, among other things, a direction was given for the exchange of the
affidavits of evidence-in-chief to take place on 30 March 2001. Mr Lim said in
his affidavit that the time frame given for the preparation of the affidavits
was a short one. We found nothing wrong with this statement. In the
circumstances of this case, we think that the time frame was a short one. Now,
what happened immediately after the directions were given was that multiple
proceedings took place. It appeared that on 27 February 2001, which was the
day before the date the directions were given, the appellant applied to Lai J
for a hearing of further arguments on the application for summary judgment. Mr
Lok said that he was unaware of this application at the hearing of the summons
for directions before the registrar. That was not disputed. Probably at that
point in time, neither of the parties knew that the application had been
granted, or for that matter, expected that it would be granted, having regard
to the fact that the time for such an application had expired. It was unclear
when the parties were notified that Lai J agreed to hear further arguments.
However, the hearing of further arguments was fixed for 5 March 2001\.
Naturally both parties would have to prepare further arguments for submission
before the judge. Then on 5 March 2001, Lai J altered her decision previously
given and gave the respondent leave to defend the appellants claim on
condition that the respondent furnished security in the sum of S$600,000.
Against that decision, the respondent decided to appeal, and it immediately
filed an appeal. An urgent application was made by the respondent for the
hearing of the appeal to be expedited and an order was made expediting the
hearing. The appeal was heard on 22 March 2001, but unfortunately the
respondent was unsuccessful in the appeal. Plainly, all these events
supervened during the relevant period, i.e. date when the order for directions
was made, namely 28 February 2001, and the deadline for the exchange of
affidavits on 30 March 2001. It was manifestly clear to us that all these
events, which were unforeseen at the time the directions were given,
occasioned a delay in the preparation by the respondent of the affidavits of
evidence-in-chief. As the judge below said, and we agreed, the time and
attention of the solicitors for the respondent had been taken up and
distracted by the hearing before Lai J and the Court of Appeal in respect of
the application for summary judgment.

12\. In our judgment, having regard to the supervening events and the short
time frame allowed, the delay could not, with respect, be characterised as
unjustified. We were of the view that an adequate explanation was given for
the extension of time, and the registrar should have granted the extension of
time sought or alternatively an extension of seven or even ten days, and
should not have exercised the draconian power of striking out the defence and
dismissing the counterclaim with judgment to the appellant. Particularly, in
this case, such extension would not necessitate an adjournment or postponement
of the trial, and the impact of an extension of time on the case overall would
not have been significant. _**

  
Prejudice

**_

13\. Having regard to what we have said, it is unnecessary to deal with the
issue of prejudice. However, since this was an issue raised and argued by both
parties, we should say a word on it. The leading authority is the case of _The
Tokai Maru_ [1998] 3 SLR 105. That was a case involving also a delay in filing
and exchanging affidavits of evidence-in-chief, and the delay involved covered
a period of some nine months, and the court held that the explanation given
for the delay was unsatisfactory and the delay was unjustified. Nonetheless,
the Court of Appeal found that there was no prejudice caused to the
respondents and the application to extend the time was granted. In coming to
this conclusion, the Court followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in
England delivered by Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) in _Costellow v
Somerset County Council_ [1993] 1 All ER 952, [1993] 1 WLR 256. Among other
things, it was stated there that _the courts practice has been to treat the
existence of such prejudice as a crucial, and often a decisive, matter._ Even
if prejudice is caused, which can be cured by an appropriate order of costs,
the court would be disinclined to refuse the application for an extension of
time.

14\. It is unnecessary for us to refer to the judgment in _Costellow_ which
was quoted in extenso in _The Tokai Maru_ and also in this Courts decision in
_Leong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hook David_ [2001] 2 SLR 17. Suffice here to
remind ourselves of the following passage of the judgment of Sir Thomas
Bingham MR which we find appropriate ([1993] 1 All ER 952 at 960, [1993] 1 WLR
256 at 264):

> [I]n the ordinary way, and in the absence of special circumstances, a court
> will not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to dismiss a plaintiffs action
> for want of prosecution unless the delay complained of after the issue of
> proceedings has caused at least a real risk of prejudice to the defendant. A
> similar approach should govern applications made under Ords 19, 24, 25, 28
> and 34. The approach to applications under Ord 3, r 5 should not in most
> cases be very different. Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances,
> it can rarely be appropriate, _on an overall assessment of what justice
> requires_ , to deny the plaintiff an extension (where the denial will stifle
> his action) because of a procedural default which, even if unjustifiable,
> has caused the defendant no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by
> an award of costs. In short, an application under O 3 r 5 should ordinarily
> be granted where the overall justice of the case requires that the action be
> allowed to proceed.

[Emphasis is ours]

15\. The judge below found that there was no undue prejudice to the appellant
if an extension of time was granted to the respondent to exchange affidavits
of evidence-in-chief by 11 April 2001, i.e. one day after the hearing before
him. We, for our part, found that there was no evidence that the appellant had
suffered _any_ prejudice entitling it to deny an extension of time to the
respondent. _**

  
Conclusion

**_

16\. For the reasons given, we found that the appeal had absolutely no merit
and had no hesitation in dismissing it.
