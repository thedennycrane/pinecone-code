General Division of the High Court (Family Division) — Divorce (Transferred)
No 4951 of 2019  
Choo Han Teck J  
16 September, 21 October 2021

8 December 2021 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The parties were married in 1999 in India. The Father started working in
Singapore in June 2005 and became a Singapore citizen in 2012. He currently
works as a director in an electrical equipment company. The Mother is 46 years
old, and a freelancer in the real estate business with PropNex since 2009. She
came to Singapore in September 2005 and became a Singapore citizen in 2018.
Both earn around $25,000 a month. The Father filed for divorce and interim
judgment was entered on 8 September 2020.

2 They have two children from the marriage. The elder child is 18 years old,
and is now serving in the National Service. The younger son is 15 years old.
He is in Grade 10 in an international school. The parties and their two
children are still staying in the matrimonial home.

3 With respect to custody, care and control of the children, both parties
agree to have joint custody. But they disagree on care and control of the
children. During my interview with the children, I find the children mature,
independent and thoughtful. They have a good relationship with both parents
but acknowledged that the Mother was more involved in their day-to-day life,
such as their academics, as the Father was frequently at work. I would award
care and control to the Mother and grant liberal access to the Father. As the
children are grown up and mature, they are more than capable of expressing
their desires on how they wish to spend their time with each parent. I do not
think it necessary to set out a detailed arrangement in this respect.

4 The key issue is how the matrimonial assets shall be divided. The operative
date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets should be the date of
interim judgment, and the operative date for determining the valuation of
matrimonial assets should be the date of the ancillary matters hearing (“AM
hearing”). As long as a property falls within the definition of a “matrimonial
asset” under s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed), it
should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets regardless of whether it
is jointly or separately owned.

5 The Husband says that the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial
assets should be 1 April 2019, but the date of the interim judgment is 8
September 2020. In the absence of any cogent reason to the contrary, the date
of the interim judgment should be the operative date for determining the pool
of matrimonial assets. As for the valuation of the matrimonial assets,
balances in bank and CPF accounts will be taken at the time of the IJ as it is
the monies that form part of the matrimonial assets and not the accounts
themselves. The rest of the matrimonial assets, namely the properties and
shares, will be valued based on the available values as close to the AM
hearing date as possible.

6 For the division of matrimonial assets, I will refer to the Joint Summary
submitted by parties. For the purpose of valuation, I will adopt the currency
rates stated in the Joint Summary: SGD$1:MYR3.12, SGD$1:USD$0.74,
SGD$1:INR54.82.

7 The Mother claims that the pool of assets amount to $4,167,689. This
includes the Noida apartment which the Father tries to exclude from the pool
on the basis that it was purchased by his own father, as well as the family
car which the Father had sold off without her consent. Her position is that
she had made 55% of the direct contributions, and 80% of the indirect
contributions. The final ratio should, she says, be 72.5:27.5 in favour of
her. The Father submitted that the total value should be $5,047,120. His
direct contributions should be 45%, and indirect contributions 50%. The final
ratio should be 52.5:47.5 in his favour. The Father contends that the Mother’s
HDFC savings account and ICICI bank account should be included in the pool of
matrimonial assets. But the Mother claims that those accounts were used to
receive rental proceeds from the properties in India, which she had inherited
from her parents.

8 Section 112(10) of the Charter provides that “matrimonial asset” does not
include any asset that has been acquired by one party by gift or inheritance,
and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other
party or by both parties to the marriage. For inheritance, unless it has been
substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both
parties to the marriage, it will be excluded from the pool of matrimonial
assets.

9 The parties disagree on the status of the Noida apartment, which is an
apartment in India jointly owned by the Father, and the Father’s father. The
Father says that this is retirement savings of his own father; his own father
invested in the purchase of this property, and put the Father and the Father’s
brother’s name as the joint owners. Further, the developer has gone bankrupt
and the property remains uncompleted for at least six years. The Mother
disagrees that the Noida apartment should be excluded from the pool of
matrimonial assets. She claims that $167,943.27 of the purchase price was paid
by the Father to the developer in India. Based on the letter of allotment
issued by the developer confirming the allocation of the Noida apartment,
there is nothing to support the Father’s claim that his father paid for the
Property solely. The Father further claims that the developer has gone
bankrupt and the project has been delayed. But at the same time, the Father
informed me that he had told his own father not to sell this property pending
the settlement of present Suit. The Noida property is, therefore, not without
value, and in the absence of proof that he was holding his half shares on
trust for his father, I would count the Noida apartment as part of the
matrimonial assets.

10 The New Delhi Property which the Wife inherited from her late parents is
also claimed by the Father. The New Delhi Property was valued at $450,000, and
was paid for by the Mother’s parents. The will by the Mother’s mother
specifically stated that, to honour the wishes of her late father, the Mother
was not to sell this property. The same applies to her shares in the Gurgaon
Property; neither parties contributed to the purchase of this property. I
agree with the Mother that since these two properties were inherited from the
Mother’s parents, this should not be included in the pool of matrimonial
assets.

11 Another issue arising from the inheritance properties is the rental
proceeds from them. The Mother has two bank accounts in India and shares held
in the Indian bank account: the bank accounts were used to receive rental
proceeds earned from the inherited properties, and the shares in the India
bank were likewise inherited from the Mother’s parents. I will exclude these
assets from the matrimonial asset pool, for the same reasons as the inherited
properties. There is no evidence that these assets were used or substantially
improved by the parties in the course of their marriage.

12 Parties have also included insurance policies for the purpose of their
children’s education, such as one Aviva plan worth $35,862.82 according to the
Mother. The Mother submitted that the monies that went towards purchasing such
policies should be added back to the pool of matrimonial assets. I decline to
include these insurance policies for the purpose of the asset division. First,
the insurance policies in question, as contested by the Mother, are largely
health insurance policies with no surrender value. Second, a number of the
policies were purchased for the children’s benefit, including their education
plan and health insurance. I see no reason to include the purchase monies in
the asset pool.

13 Another point of contention was the sale proceeds of the former family BMW
car, which was sold on 28 November 2019 for the price of $38,691.49. The
Mother submitted that she had paid $40,000 for the down payment of the car,
and the Father sold it while divorce proceedings were pending without the
Mother’s consent, and failed to return any monies. The Father said that the
sale proceeds had been deposited into the bank account and therefore it should
not be included as a separate item in the pool of matrimonial assets. Though
the Mother is rightly aggrieved that the family car was sold without her
consent, I am inclined to exclude this item from the pool of matrimonial
assets as the monies had been deposited into the Father’s SCB account -0989.
In the absence of evidence from the Mother that he had dissipated monies in
his bank account, including the sale proceeds as a separate item would lead to
double-counting.

14 In sum, the parties’ assets in the matrimonial pool are:

15 As this is a dual-income family, I will first ascribe a ratio that
represents each party’s direct contributions relative to those of the other
party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party had
made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. I will
then ascribe a ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution in terms
of their contribution to the well-being of the family, relative to that by the
other spouse. Third, I will derive the average percentage contribution, based
on the respective direct and indirect contributions by the parties.

16 In terms of the direct financial contribution, the Father asked for a 70:30
split of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home, based on his initial
contribution and mortgage payments for the matrimonial home. As for the
Tanjong Rhu property in the Mother’s sole name, the Father sought a 50:50
split as it was a joint matrimonial asset. The rest of the assets in cash
should be distributed 50:50, and the properties in Malaysia and India be
excluded from the matrimonial pool. As for his indirect contribution, the
Father submitted that he the primary caretaker was the domestic helper, and
not the Mother who was active in both her careers and her social life. The
Father also asks that the Mother bear 50% of the mortgage instalments in
arrears since August 2020, until the titles are transferred, as the Mother had
allegedly declined to pay for her share of the mortgage payment.

17 The Mother says that the Father did not provide any proof as to how the
mortgage and down payments were paid. With respect to the Johor Bahru
apartment, the Mother claims that she had contributed MYR10,000 to the
purchase of the Johor Bahru apartment, and 20% of the purchase price of a plot
of residential land in Faridabad (“Sector 46 Faridabad”). As for the
matrimonial home, the Mother claims that she had paid the 4% down payment, the
15% cash payment, the stamp duty payment, legal fees and part of the
renovation costs, amounting to a total of $518,125.54.

18 Though the Mother contends that there is no proof of the Husband’s
contribution to the matrimonial home, it is also undisputed that the Husband
contributed solely to the payment of the mortgage, and the Mother contributed
more in terms of the cash down payment and renovation expenses. The ratio of
the contribution between the Father and Mother is around 63:37. As for the
Sector 45 Faridabad land, there was an agreement between parties evidencing
their respective contributions, which were around 80:20 in favour of the
Father. With their respective properties taken into account (without factoring
in the Sector Faridabad land under the Father’s assets which has been taken
into account), the direct financial contributions are 40:60 in favour of the
Mother.

19 As for indirect contributions, this includes their contributions to other
household expenses, and to taking care of their children. I accept that the
Father travelled frequently for work. But he had also contributed to the
upbringing of the children, paid for their school fees. Accordingly, I ascribe
a ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Mother. The average ratio is therefore
60:40.

20 For the matrimonial home, since the younger son is sitting for a major exam
in the coming year, it would be more appropriate and convenient for the Mother
to buy out the Father’s shares in the matrimonial home, than for the children
to be compelled to move to a new apartment.

21 In the circumstances, I make the following orders as to the parties’
respective entitlement:

(a) Parties are to retain assets in their sole names;

(b) The remaining moneys in the POSB Joint Account are to be shared 60:40 in
favour of the Mother, and the account shall be closed thereafter;

(c) The Mother is to sell the Swimming Club Membership, and the net proceeds
to be divided 60:40;

(d) The matrimonial home is to be sold in open market, and the net sale
proceeds of the matrimonial home shall be distributed in the ratio of 40% to
the Father and 60% to the Mother, with an option for the Mother to buy over
the Father’s share of the matrimonial home, based on market price or price
otherwise agreed upon.

(e) If the matrimonial home were to be sold in open market, each party shall
utilize their shares of the nett sale proceeds of the matrimonial home to
refund their CPF monies withdrawn for the purchase of the matrimonial home
plus accrued interest.

(f) The Mother is to reimburse the Father for half of the mortgage instalments
paid between the date of the IJ and the date of this Judgment, subject to the
Father producing proof of the sums paid.

22 As for maintenance for the children, I think that the Father’s request that
the Mother enumerates the expenses for the children, is unreasonable. The
elder son is in National Service and only requires limited daily expenses,
which can be paid for as he so requires. For the younger son, the Father
suggested that both parents bear his school fees ($3,700 per month) in the
proportion of 53.5% by the Mother, and the rest by the Father, and that a
nominal maintenance for $380 be given on top of his school fees if he does not
have care and control.

23 The Mother wants the Father to bear 70% of the children’s expenses. For the
elder son, this amounts to a total of $4,949.67 including personal expenses,
mortgage, household expenses and car. For the younger son, this amounts to
$10,273.67, out of which $6,381 are for school fees and related expenses, for
the period until the younger son starts National Service in September 2024.
After the younger son starts his National Service, the expenses are estimated
to be a total of $4,949.67, less school fees, school bus and other school-
related expenses.

24 As both parties are of comparable earning power (although the Mother seems
to earn more than the Father), they should contribute to both Children’s
educational fees and other daily expenses equally from the date of this
Judgment onwards. For the educational expenses, this would be subject to the
invoices from the school or university, to be paid by parties to the
respective school/university upon receipt of the invoices.

25 For the daily expenses, I do not find the Mother’s request to include the
mortgage payments in the children’s expenses justifiable. Moreover, since the
older son has started serving National Service, there is no evidence as to how
extra-curricular tuition fees for both children would amount to $1,500 per
month. Further, some of the expenses such as the sports activities were
incurred in 2020; there is no evidence that such activities are ongoing. For
the dental expenses, the Mother showed payment of around $250 for the dental
visits, but the records do not bear out her claim that such expenses are
incurred on a monthly basis. I therefore find that $2,500 for both children
would be reasonable, taking into account groceries, pocket money, school bus,
medical needs, clothing and other sundry expenses. The Father is to pay for
half of the personal expenses by depositing $1,250 per month into the Mother’s
bank account. Once the younger son commences National Service in 2024, with
the elder son in university, the personal expenses would be $900 for each
child and both parents shall deposit their respective contributions to the
child’s bank account directly.

26 Both children are mature and articulate, but the evidence shows that their
parents kept involving them in the quarrels. As the ancillary matters draw to
a close, the parties should move on with their lives and allow their children
to move on with theirs too, and perhaps for once, to breathe freely.

27 I make no order as to costs.
