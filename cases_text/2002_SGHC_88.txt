**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. In this action, PSA Corporation Limited (‘PSA’) claims against Korea
Exchange Bank (‘KEB’) for payment under two guarantees issued by KEB in favour
of PSA.

2\. For the purpose of my Grounds, the main defences of KEB are that:

> (a) PSA did not open an account for Cho Yang (Singapore) Pte Ltd (‘CY
> Singapore’) as required under each guarantee and that the account was opened
> for Cho Yang Shipping Co Ltd (‘CY Korea’) instead.
>
> (b) KEB also alleged that the second guarantee was issued in replacement or
> substitution of the first guarantee and not in addition to it.

3\. PSA then applied for discovery of two categories of documents in relation
to each of the two guarantees:

> (a) copies of all correspondence, including e-mail, between KEB and CY
> Singapore and/or CY Korea relating to each particular guarantee,
>
> (b) copies of all documents, including but not limited to KEB’s internal
> memoranda, file notes and e-mail, relating to KEB’s processing and issue of
> the particular guarantee.

4\. KEB did not dispute that the documents for which discovery was sought were
relevant to the disputes in the action. However, it took the position that it
was precluded by s 47 of the current Banking Act (Cap 19) from giving
discovery.

5\. At the hearing before Assistant Registrar Phang Hsiao Chung, PSA obtained
an order for discovery of the first category but not the second category of
documents.

6\. However, only PSA appealed against AR Phang’s decision. PSA wanted an
order of discovery to be made against KEB in respect of the second category of
documents as well. On 27 March 2002, I dismissed PSA’s appeal with costs.

Section 47(3) Banking Act (Cap 19) 1994 Edition

**_

7\. The previous s 47(3) Banking Act (‘the Act’) stated:

> ‘(3) Subject to subsection (4), no official of any bank and no person who by
> reason of his capacity or office has by any means access to the records of
> the bank, registers or any correspondence or material with regard to the
> account of any customer of that bank shall, while his employment in or
> professional relationship with the bank, as the case may be, continues or
> after the termination thereof, give, divulge or reveal any information
> _whatsoever regarding the money or other relevant particulars of the
> account_ of that customer.’
>
> [Emphasis added.]

8\. Various exceptions were set out in subsection (4) but I need not refer to
them.

_**

  
Current Section 47 Banking Act (Cap 19)

**_

9\. The previous s 47 was repealed and substituted by the current s 47 with
effect from 18 July 2001. The banking secrecy provision is now spread over two
subsections instead of one. The relevant provisions are s 47(1) to (2). There
is also another provision i.e s 47(3) on the court’s power to give directions
or orders to ensure confidentiality.

10\. Section 47(1) to (3) state:

> ‘**Banking secrecy**
>
> 47\. (1) Customer information shall not, in any way, be disclosed by a bank
> in Singapore or any of its officers to any other person except as expressly
> provided in this Act.
>
> (2) A bank in Singapore or any of its officers may, for such purpose as may
> be specified in the first column of the Sixth Schedule, disclose customer
> information to such persons or class of persons as may be specified in the
> second column of that Schedule, and in compliance with such conditions as
> may be specified in the third column of that Schedule.
>
> (3) Where customer information is likely to be disclosed in any proceedings
> referred to in item 3 or 4 of Part I of the Sixth Schedule, the court may,
> either of its own motion, or on the application of any party to the
> proceedings or the customer to which the customer information relates

> > (a) direct that the proceedings be held in camera; and
>>

>> (b) make such further orders as it may consider necessary to ensure the
confidentiality of the customer information.’

11\. As is evident, exceptions to banking secrecy are stated in the first
column of the Sixth Schedule to the Act. For present purposes, I need refer
only to items 3 and 4 thereof which state:

‘ **SIXTH SCHEDULE**

PART I

FURTHER DISCLOSURE NOT PROHIBITED

> _
>
> First column
>
> _**
>
> Purpose for which customer information may be disclosed
>
> **
>
> 3\. Disclosure is solely in connection with -
>

>> (a) where the customer is an individual, the bankruptcy of the customer; or

>>

>> (b) where the customer is a body corporate, the winding up of the customer.

>
> 4\. Disclosure is solely with a view to the institution of, or solely in
> connection with, the conduct of proceedings-
>

>> (a) between the bank and the customer or his surety relating to the banking
transaction of the customer;

>>

>> (b) between the bank and 2 or more parties making adverse claims to money
in an account of the customer where the bank seeks relief by way of
interpleader; or

>>

>> (c) between the bank and one or more parties in respect of property,
whether movable or immovable, in or over which some right or interest has been
conferred or alleged to have been conferred on the bank by the customer or his
surety.’

12\. In addition, ‘customer information’ in s 47 is defined in s 40A as
follows:

> ‘ "customer information", in relation to a bank, means
>

>> (a) any information _relating to_ , or any particulars of, an account of a
customer of the bank, whether the account is in respect of a loan, investment
or any other type of transaction, but does not include any information that is
not referable to any named customer or group of named customers; or

>>

>> (b) deposit information;’

>
> [Emphasis added.]

There is a definition of ‘deposit information’ also but that is not relevant
for present purposes.

_**

  
Submission for PSA

**_

13\. Mr Siraj Omar, Counsel for PSA, submitted that under the predecessor to s
47, the prohibition from disclosure of information was restricted only to the
money in the account of the customer and particulars of the account. In other
words, other information was not precluded from disclosure by a bank. He
derived support from some textbooks.

14\. For example, International Bank Secrecy, 1992, by Dennis Campbell states
at para 31-027:

> ‘**Subject matter of statutory duty**
>
> Section 47 prohibits those concerned from giving, divulging, or revealing
> "any information whatsoever regarding the money or other relevant
> particulars of the account of [the bank’s] customer". It will be noticed
> that a moratorium is imposed on "any information whatsoever", that relates
> to:
>

>> (1) The money in the customer’s account, or  
>  (2) Relevant particulars of the account.
>
> It would appear that an omission has been made in respect of the affairs of
> the customer other than the money in, or relevant particulars, of the
> account. The situation in _Tournier_ , for example, would apparently fall
> outside the wording of section 47 as the information divulged in that case
> was that the banks’ customer had diverted the proceeds of a check to his
> bookmaker. This neither relates to the money in his account, nor is it a
> particular of his account.’

15\. Another textbook which he relied on was Bank Confidentiality by Francis
Neate, Second Edition 1997, at p 442:

> ‘ _**Subject matter of statutory duty**_
>
> The prohibited matter under BA, s 47(3) relates to the balance in the
> customer’s account and other relevant particulars of the account of the
> customer. In _Tournier_ , the bank had made disclosure to a third party of
> the fact that the customer had diverted the proceeds of a cheque to a
> bookmaker. Since such information neither relates to the money in the
> customer’s account nor is it a particular of his account, this raises the
> issue of whether the bank would have been held to have breached its
> statutory duty of confidentiality in Singapore even though it may have
> breached its contractual duty at common law, which is framed more widely.’

16\. However the next two paras state:

> ‘ This is a (_sic_) possibly anomaly, which unfortunately has also not come
> before the courts. Although it is appreciated that the argument made above
> that s 47 is not intended to be exhaustive, it is submitted here that the
> narrower wording of s 47(3) should be followed, on the principle of
> statutory interpretation that a penal statute be narrowly construed.
>
> It should be noted that the Malaysian statutory duty does not have this
> anomaly, because their equivalent provision prohibits the disclosure of ‘any
> information or document whatsoever relating to the affairs or account’ of a
> customer.’

17\. Mr Omar submitted that there was no radical departure from this regime
when the predecessor Act was repealed and the new Act came into force because
no such departure was suggested when Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier-General
Lee Hsien Loong (‘DPM’) moved the reading of the Banking (Amendment) Bill. DPM
said, inter alia,

> ‘Revision of Banking Secrecy Provisions
>
> The banking secrecy provisions of the Banking Act protect the
> confidentiality of customer information. Tight banking secrecy is important
> to maintaining the confidence of customers in our banking system. However,
> our present banking secrecy provisions have impeded banks wanting to take
> advantage of potential operational benefits and savings. For example, banks
> find it difficult to securitise mortgage loans, or to outsource data
> processing to third parties. MAS has reviewed the banking secrecy provisions
> in consultation with the industry. We have considered both the operational
> requirements of banks and the need to preserve customer confidentiality. The
> measures set out in the new section 47 strike a careful balance between
> these two sets of considerations.

> The new section 47 will stipulate a wider set of circumstances under which
> banks can disclose customer information, and the terms of such disclosure.
> These are set out in a new Sixth Schedule, which consists of two parts. Part
> I will contain many of the existing exceptions, and Part II will contain
> most of the new exceptions to the secrecy provisions. Examples of new
> exceptions are the disclosure of credit information in a sale or transfer of
> credit facilities (for example, asset securitisation), and the disclosure of
> customer information to a bank’s head office for risk management purposes.
> Two key points about the new exceptions are, first, only very few exceptions
> have been allowed for the disclosure of information relating to a customer’s
> deposit and funds placed for investment; and second, a person who receives
> customer information will be required by law to keep the information
> confidential.
>
> These measures ensure that by law, all banks will provide a basic level of
> customer confidentiality to all their customers. Beyond this legal minimum,
> individual banks and customers may reach their own contractual arrangements
> offering higher standards of confidentiality. The Act does not compel a bank
> to invoke the newly introduced exceptions if the bank deems this to be in
> the best interests of its business and its customers.’

18\. Mr Omar submitted that since the category of documents for which PSA
sought discovery did not pertain to money in the account of KEB’s customers,
whether it be CY Singapore or CY Korea, or particulars of the account as such,
KEB was not prohibited from disclosing the same under s 47 of the current
Banking Act. In addition, if any document disclosed would reveal any
prohibited information which was not relevant to the action, portions of the
document could be blanked out.

19\. Finally he submitted that it was anomalous to allow one category of
documents to be disclosed and not another.

_**

  
Submission for KEB

**_

20\. Mr Toh Kian Sing, Counsel for KEB, stressed that it was common ground
that the exceptions in the Sixth Schedule did not apply. The question was
whether the prohibition in s 47 was as limited as advocated by Mr Omar or the
prohibition was wider. He submitted that as the definition of ‘customer
information’ was wider than the words in the previous s 47(3), the prohibition
was wider.

21\. As for the current s 47(3), Mr Toh submitted that the court can make such
orders as it may consider necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the
customer information only if the proceedings come within item 3 or 4 of Part I
of the Sixth Schedule in the first place.

_**

  
My Decision

**_

22\. DPM’s speech in Parliament did not indicate whether a change was intended
on the point in issue before me.

23\. I was of the view that whether a change was intended or not, the scheme
under the current s 47 was to have a general, as opposed to a limited,
prohibition from disclosure with the exceptions stated in the Sixth Schedule.

24\. I came to this conclusion from the wider words used to define ‘customer
information’ as well as the speech of DPM.

25\. Firstly, as I have set out, ‘customer information’ means ‘any information
_relating to_ … an account of a customer of the bank’ [emphasis added]. True,
the definition is not in the same terms as the Malaysian statutory duty
mentioned in Bank Confidentiality by Francis Neate i.e where the provision
prohibits disclosure of ‘any information _or document whatsoever_ relating to
the _affairs_ or account’ of a customer [emphasis added]. However, I was of
the view that the omission of the words I have emphasized do not mean that the
prohibition is as limited as was argued by Mr Omar. In my view, ‘information’
includes documentary information and so long as the information sought relates
to an account of a customer, then, prima facie disclosure by the bank is
prohibited.

26\. Secondly, the speech by DPM reflects the scheme that there should first
be a general prohibition from disclosure by banks to ensure confidentiality.
This is then subject to exceptions stated in the Sixth Schedule. If any
further exception is to be made, then this should be done by amending the
Sixth Schedule and not by narrowly construing ‘customer information’.

27\. On the facts before me, the second category of documents related to the
account of KEB’s customer or customers.

28\. I also agreed that under the current s 47(3), the question of the court
making such further orders as are necessary to preserve confidentiality comes
into play only if item 3 or 4 of the Sixth Schedule apply. The current s 47(3)
does not enable a court to order disclosure from a bank if none of the
exceptions apply in the first place.

29\. It may well be that the present case calls for further amendments to be
made to the Act to include an exception which allows disclosure in litigation
between a bank and the beneficiary of an instrument issued by the bank.
Indeed, there are many instances of banks issuing instruments like guarantees,
performance bonds and letters of credit. It seems to be incongruous that where
there is litigation between, say, a bank and a surety relating to the banking
transaction of a customer, discovery of relevant documents pertaining to
‘customer information’ is allowed but yet where a beneficiary sues a bank on
any of the instruments I have mentioned, such disclosure is not allowed. Since
the dispute between the beneficiary and the bank relates to an instrument
which must have been issued at the request of the customer, the customer
should not be in a position to complain if information relating to his account
is disclosed so long as it satisfies the test of relevance in the litigation.
In addition, the current s 47(3) can be expanded to allow the court to make
such directions and orders it thinks fit to ensure confidentiality where this
exception, if available, applies.

30\. As an aside, it seems to me that the current s 47(3) is too narrow in
that it should not be confined to items 3 and 4. This is because there are
other exceptions which may require the court’s assistance to ensure
confidentiality, for example, items 6 and 7 of the Sixth Schedule which
pertain respectively to garnishee proceedings and a court order pursuant to
Part IV of the Evidence Act.

31\. However, it is for Parliament to decide whether any further exception to
banking secrecy or confidentiality is required and whether the current s 47(3)
should be expanded.

32\. As for the argument that it would be anomalous to allow one category of
documents to be disclosed and not another, I accepted that there was some
force in that argument. It seemed to me that either both categories should
have been disclosed or not at all. However, that was the decision below and
there was no appeal by KEB.

33\. In the circumstances, I dismissed PSA’s appeal with costs.
