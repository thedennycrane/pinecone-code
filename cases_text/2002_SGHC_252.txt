HELD, JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFF :

> The key document in this case was the purchase order. The signature by JB
> Lee, inserted without prior consultation or knowledge of the plaintiffs, did
> not in any way alter the character of the contract entered into, where the
> first defendants were unequivocally identified and described as the vendors.
> If the first defendants were indeed the sourcing agents, they should have,
> before the return of the purchase order to the plaintiffs, pointed out that
> their role was merely that of sourcing agents or intermediaries. From the
> e-mail exchanges, it would seem that the first defendants were at all times
> seen to be projecting themselves as vendors of the goods. Furthermore, their
> contention that they were only sourcing agents did not seem to cohere with
> their representation that the second defendants were their branch office in
> US in their e-mail dated 26 August 2000. Another unsettling aspect in the
> first defendant’s case was that although JB Lee of the second defendants was
> admittedly in Singapore on 3 and 4 September 2000, Philip Loh who met JB
> Lee, did not even arrange for JB Lee to meet with the plaintiffs’
> representatives. Having regard to all the evidence and arguments, the
> conclusion was that the first defendants did indeed enter into the contract
> with the plaintiffs, not as sourcing agents or intermediaries, but on the
> basis that they were the contracting party (See [41]-[44], [47], [49]).
>
> The plaintiffs were not estopped from proceeding against the first
> defendants as a result of paragraph five of their statement of claim because
> there had not been any election by the plaintiffs, which must be
> unequivocal. Final election would not take place until the party had
> obtained judgment against one party (See [55])

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

Facts

**_

1 In this trial, the following facts by and large were not in dispute. The
plaintiffs are a company incorporated in the Republic of China. They wanted to
purchase 1,920 pieces of computer chips (model Intel E28F320J5-120) for resale
to their customers. In this they enlisted the assistance of a Singapore
commission agent, one Sean Lim Chong Jin (PW-1) (‘Sean Lim’). Sean Lim became
the plaintiffs’ local representative since early January 2000.

2 Sean Lim for his part sent out a mass electronic mail (‘e-mail’) to
prospective suppliers. The result was that he received an e-mail on 11 August
2000 from the first defendants, a company incorporated in Singapore. The said
e-mail (DB-8) read thus:

> > Attn: Mr Sean Lim

4 Then on 24 August 2000, a proforma invoice dated 23 August 2000 for
US$134,400 addressed to the plaintiffs was received by the plaintiffs by way
of fax. It was reportedly from T & M International and was sent to Sean Lim by
the first defendants.

5 In the event, on 24 August 2000, the plaintiffs forwarded their purchase
order to the first defendants. Since the said purchase order became the

6 Some aspects of the said purchase order need highlighting here. The purchase
order which was forwarded to the attention of Philip Loh of the first
defendants named the defendants as vendors. At the bottom left-hand corner of
the purchase order, there was a space for signature under the notation
‘confirmed by’. This was reportedly signed by one JB Lee describing himself as
the president of one T & M International and returned to the plaintiffs. At
the time the plaintiffs forwarded the purchase order to the first defendants,
the plaintiffs had admittedly no clue as to the actual relationship between
the first defendants and the said T & M International.

7 The plaintiffs next wrote to the defendants on 25 August 2000 stating that
they would be arranging for telegraphic transfer of the sale amount on 28
August 2000 and requested the first defendants to arrange shipment of the
goods by Fedex immediately after receipt of payment. Following the said
communication, the plaintiffs, on 28 August 2000, remitted US$134,400 to T & M
International as advised by the defendants’ Philip Loh in his e-mail dated 28
August 2000.

8 Contrary to expectation, the goods were not despatched to the plaintiffs. On
30 August 2000, JB Lee of T & M International reportedly wrote to the first
defendants that payment for the goods had already been made to ‘Intel U.S.’
and that T & M International expected delivery of the goods by 6 September
2000 latest. On 31 August 2000 the plaintiffs protested to the first
defendants regarding the delay. They warned the first defendants that if the
plaintiffs’ customers were to insist on cancelling the order because of the
delay, the plaintiffs would look to the first defendants not only for the
return of the amount paid but also for compensation for any resulting loss. On
4 September 2000, the plaintiffs wrote to the first defendants again, this
time conveying their customers’ demand for compensation as a result of the
delay in the delivery of the goods. This letter was followed by a letter from
the plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 12 September 2000 in which the plaintiffs’
solicitors said that the non-delivery of the goods by 30 August 2000
constituted a breach of the agreement entered into between the parties and
that the amount paid towards the purchase of the goods be refunded to the
plaintiffs within three days from the date of the letter together with a sum
to be determined in respect of losses suffered by the plaintiffs.

9 On 20 September 2000, the first defendants’ solicitors replied to the
plaintiffs’ solicitors. In this letter, the first defendants’ solicitors
stated that their clients were not liable to the plaintiffs in any way as they
were only acting as an intermediary between T & M International and the
plaintiffs and the role of the first defendants was no more than mere sourcing
agents.

_**

Pleadings

**_

10 The pleaded case of the plaintiffs against the first and second defendants
was in the alternative. The earlier parts of the statement of claim (paras 1
to 4) were directed against the first defendants for breach of contract. The
plaintiffs averred in those paragraphs as follows:

> > 1\. By a contract in writing as evidenced by the following documents:-
>>

>>> (a) an offer in writing from the First Defendants addressed to the
Plaintiffs, through the Plaintiffs’ Singapore representative, dated the 23rd
day of August, 2000; and

>>>

>>> (b) a Purchase Order No: SK-001 from the Plaintiffs addressed to the First
Defendants dated the 24th day of August, 2000;

>>

>> the First Defendants agreed to sell and deliver 1920 pieces of computer
chips model: Intel E28F320J5-120 at US$70.00 per piece to the Plaintiffs
immediately after receipt of payment from the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs will
refer to the documents at the trial for their full terms and effects.

>>

>> 2\. On the 28th day of August, 2000, and acting on the terms of the
contract or the instructions of the First Defendants, the Plaintiffs made
payment of or remitted a sum of US$134,400.00, by way of telegraphic transfer
through a financial institution, to the Second Defendants in full payment of
the agreed price for the 1920 pieces of computer chips Model: Intel
E28F320J5-120. The Second Defendants have duly acknowledged receipt of the
said sum of US$134,400.00.

>>

>> 3\. At all material times, the First Defendants well knew that the
Plaintiffs bought the said 1920 pieces of computer chips Model No:
E28F320J5-120 in the ordinary course of their business for resale at a profit
to their customers.

>>

>> 4\. In breach of the said contract, the First Defendant wrongfully failed
refused and/or neglected to deliver any of the 1920 pieces of computer chips
Model No: E28F320J5-120 within a reasonable time or at all and the First
Defendants have wrongfully repudiated the said contract, which repudiation the
Plaintiffs have accepted by way of a letter from the Plaintiffs’ Solicitors
dated the 12th day of September, 2000.

11 Averments in second part of the claim framed in the alternative against the
second defendants, were as follows:

> > 5\. Alternatively, by a contract in writing as evidenced by a Proforma
> Invoice No. I-23080 from the Second Defendants addressed to the Plaintiffs
> dated the 23rd day of August, 2000 but sent by the First Defendants to the
> Plaintiffs, the Second Defendants agreed to sell and deliver 1920 pieces of
> computer chips Model: Intel E28F320J5-120 at US$70.00 per piece to the
> Plaintiffs on the following terms :-
>>

>>> (a) the Plaintiffs are to arrange for telegraphic transfer of the full
purchase price to the Second Defendants in advance; and

>>>

>>> (b) the computer chips so ordered will be shipped Free On Board (F.O.B.)
via the United States of America to the Plaintiffs.

>>

>> The Plaintiffs will refer to the said Proforma Invoice at the trial for its
full terms and effects.

>>

>> 6\. On the 28th day of August, 2000, the Plaintiffs made payment or
remitted a sum of US$134,400.00, by way of telegraphic transfer through a
financial institution, to the Second Defendants in full payment of the agreed
price for the 1920 pieces of computer chips Model: Intel E28F320J5-120. The
Second Defendants have duly acknowledged receipt of the said sum of
US$134,400.00.

>>

>> 7\. At all material times, the Second Defendants well knew that the
Plaintiffs bought the said 1920 pieces of computer chips Model No:
E28F320J5-120 in the ordinary course of their business for resale at a profit
to their customers.

>>

>> 8\. In breach of the said contract, the Second Defendants wrongfully failed
refused and/or neglected to deliver any of the 1920 pieces of computer chips
Model No: E28F320J5-120 within a reasonable time or at all and the Second
Defendants have wrongfully repudiated the said contract, which repudiation the
Plaintiffs have accepted by the issuance of the present Writ.

>>

>> 9\. By reasons of the matters stated in paragraphs 5 to 8 aforesaid, the
consideration for the payment of US$134,400.00 has wholly failed, and the
Second Defendants have had and received the said sum of US$134,400.00 to the
use of the Plaintiffs.

12 The second defendants did not file any defence and neither did they take
any steps to contest the plaintiffs’ claim. As for the first defendants, their
defence in sum, was that they acted only as sourcing agents and as
intermediaries between the plaintiffs and the second defendants. Their defence
insofar as was material (paras 1 to 5), read thus:

> > 1\. The 1st Defendants deny that they made the contract alleged in
> paragraph 1 of the statement of claim or any contract with the Plaintiffs.
>>

>> 2\. The 1st Defendants say that the Plaintiffs knew or ought to have known
that at all material times, the 1st Defendants acted only as sourcing agents;
and as intermediary between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendants.

>>

>> 3\. The 1st Defendants further say that the alleged offer in writing dated
23rd day of August 2000 and the Purchase Order No. SK-001 dated 24th August
2000 from the Plaintiffs to the 1st Defendants do not constitute in law an
offer and acceptance necessary and required for the formation of a contract
between the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendants.

>>

>> 4(a) The 1st Defendants also say that the contract for the sale and
purchase of the goods referred to in the statement of claim, namely 1920
pieces of computer chips model: Intel E28F 320J5-120 at U$70.00 per piece, is
evidenced by the following documents (and not by the 2 documents referred to
in paragraph 1 of the statement of claim):-

>>

>> (1) the Plaintiffs said Purchase Order No. SK-001 dated 24th August 2000
which said Purchase Order was duly confirmed (hence accepted) by the 2nd
Defendants (and not by the 1st Defendants).

>>

>> (2) The Proforma Invoice No. I-23080 dated 23rd August 2000 from the 2nd
Defendants to the Plaintiffs referred to in the paragraph 5 of the Statement
of Claim.

>>

>> (b) The 1st Defendants admit paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim in that
the Plaintiffs made payment or remitted a sum of US$134,400.00 as therein
stated, to the 2nd Defendants. The 1st Defendants received no payment
whatsoever from the Plaintiffs.

>>

>> 5\. By reason of the aforesaid matters, the 1st Defendants say that:-

>>

>>> (a) no contract exist between the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendants for
the sale and purchase of the said goods;

>>>

>>> (b) the contract for the said sale and purchase is between the Plaintiffs
and the 2nd Defendants.

_**

Evidence

**_

13 The facts which were not in dispute have already been summarised earlier. I
now propose to highlight some aspects of the parties’ evidence which were at
variance.

14 Sean Lim, a sales executive who was the plaintiffs’ local representative
and the person who was charged with the task of procuring the goods under
reference for the plaintiffs, testified on behalf of the plaintiffs. After
narrating the events and the e-mail exchange which led to the placing of the
purchase order referred to, he said that following the plaintiffs’ complaint
that they had yet to receive the goods despite their remitting the purchase
price, he met Philip Loh of the first defendants on 30 August 2000. At that
meeting, Philip Loh told him amongst other things that ‘the second defendants
were the branch office of the first defendants in the US and that the boss of
the second defendants was a good friend of his boss and that shipment of the
goods would be delayed until the 5 or 6 September 2000.

15 Subsequently, he met Simon Tan the marketing manager of the first
defendants on 1 September 2000. At that meeting, Sean Lim told Simon Tan that
the plaintiffs’ customers were threatening to cancel their contract with the
plaintiffs on account of the non-delivery of the said goods and were demanding
an immediate refund of the purchase price as well as compensation from the
plaintiffs.

16 Simon Tan assured Sean Lim at that meeting that the goods would be
delivered by 6 September 2000. At that meeting, Simon Tan suggested to Sean
Lim that the plaintiffs ought to look to the second defendants or the
manufacturers of the goods for compensation for the late or non-delivery of
the said goods. Nonetheless, Simon Tan also assured Sean Lim that there would
not be any problems or difficulties for the first defendants to make refund of
the sum of US$134,4000 or to meet any compensation sought by the plaintiffs’
customers arising from the late or non-delivery of the goods.

17 As it transpired, on 4 September 2000, the plaintiffs demanded from the
first defendants, a sum of US$14,000 as compensation for the delay in delivery
of the goods contracted to be supplied. But the demand went unheeded by the
first defendants. Not only that, the first defendants in fact sought to shift
the blame for such non-delivery of the goods on to the plaintiffs, stating
that the delay was due to late remittance of the purchase price by the
plaintiffs.

18 On 8 September 2000, the plaintiffs’ General Manager Kao Wen Teng arrived
from Taiwan. He, together with Sean Lim and another person by name Tony Tang,
called at the offices of the first defendants. Later, they had a fruitless
meeting with Simon Tan who suggested they go after the second defendants or
the manufacturers of the goods. Simon Tan also stated at that meeting that he
would be flying to the US to check on the situation and to collect the sum of
US$134,400 from the second defendants. Since nothing seemed to be
materialising, the plaintiffs sought legal advice and the upshot was a demand
letter from their solicitors dated 12 September 2000, addressed to the first
defendants.

19 On 13 September 2000, the plaintiffs received a letter of demand from their
customers, one Component Sourcing House, demanding the return of a sum of
US$149,760 being the sum paid by them to the plaintiffs for the purchase of
the said goods. This sum of $149,760 was subsequently paid over by way of
instalments to Mitkem Technologies who are the customers of Component Sourcing
House.

20 According to Sean Lim, the plaintiffs were sent a copy of a letter dated 27
September 2000 from the first defendants to T & M International. It appeared
from that letter that the first defendants had asked T & M International to
deal with the plaintiffs directly stating that the first defendants’ ‘role as
a middleman is limited and [they were] in no position to reply [to the
plaintiffs] on the refund of money.’

21 There were other details recounted by Sean Lim which do not require mention
here save for the aspect that the second defendants were apparently willing to
assume responsibility for the fiasco and in the process were seen to be
blaming one Malaysian Corporation known as Nikiwa for the default.

22 It must be mentioned presently that Sean Lim’s assertion that Philip Loh
told him on 30 August 2000 that the second defendants were the branch office
of the first defendants in the US was not disputed by the defence.

23 The testimony of Kao Wen Tang (PW-2), the General Manager of the plaintiffs
was confirmatory of the account narrated by Sean Lim. Additionally, Kao Wen
Tang averred how the plaintiffs arranged to pay Mitkem Technologies their
claim for refund of the sums paid by them.

24 Anita Kuo Hsiu-Chin (PW-3), Assistant Manager of the plaintiffs, in her
testimony adopted what was narrated by Sean Lim and Kao Wen Tang.

25 Philip Loh Wei Siang (DW-1), sales manager was the only person who
testified for the defence. His evidence can be summarised as follows.

26 The first defendants’ business included import and export of goods in the
electronic field. The first defendants also acted as intermediaries between
buyers and sellers. Between 31 July and 23 August 2000, he had a number of
telephone conversations with the plaintiffs’ representative Sean Lim. In one
of his conversations - he could not quite recall when it was – he told Sean
Lim that the first defendants were only sourcing agents and that they would
try to source for the goods the plaintiffs wanted. He told Sean Lim that the
first defendants would not be supplying goods themselves but would be
middlemen or intermediaries between the plaintiffs and sellers.

27 Philip Loh claimed that the plaintiffs knew or ought to have known that the
first defendants would not enter into any contract with the plaintiffs and the
contract would be between the plaintiffs and the actual supplier of goods. He
then recounted the e-mail exchanges between the parties culminating in the
purchase order from the plaintiffs. He added that he sent the purchase order
to the second defendants and after it was signed by the second defendants
below the column ‘confirmed by’ he forwarded the confirmed purchase order to
the plaintiffs. He further claimed that the purchase order thus confirmed by
the second defendants ought to have made the plaintiffs aware that the second
defendants were the sellers of the goods to the plaintiffs and the first
defendants were only the intermediaries. Further, according to him, the second
defendants had also given the plaintiffs a proforma invoice dated 23 August
2000 (DB-15).

28 According to Philip Loh, unfortunately the goods were not delivered by the
second defendants to the plaintiffs after payment from the plaintiffs had been
received by the second defendants. He disclosed that the first defendants even
made a report to the police on 7 September 2000 casting aspersions on the
plaintiffs’ motives. In the said police report (DB-24/25), the first
defendants’ Philip Loh and Simon Tan described the second defendants as their
‘US contact point’. In the last two sentences of the first paragraph of the
report, both Philip Loh and Simon Tan said: ‘ _In the meantime we find it
highly suspicious the default of the Malaysian supplier coincided exactly with
Trigen (sic) urgency for delivery. We have refused to pay compensation to
Trigen as we think they are in league with the Malaysian supplier and are
trying to make off with the compensation_.’

29 As it transpired, the Commercial Affairs Department of Singapore informed
the first defendants on 28 December 2000 that they had carefully considered
the matter and that they were of the view that no criminal offence had been
disclosed (DB-27).

30 In cross-examination, Philip Loh reiterated that he told Sean Lim on 31
July 2000 before the issuance of the purchase order that the first defendants
were a trading company and they would like to source for the plaintiffs for
the items under reference (page 240 of the NE). He was then referred to an
e-mail dated 26 August 2000. The said e-mail reads as follows:

> > 1\. My branch office in U.S. found 30K pcs Intel DA28F640J5-150 at
> US$105.00 with 2000+ data code. Anyway, I rejected them due to high price.
> They are still searching and believe they can have the price early next wk,
> price that is near our current item. They also found some qty <5.6K pcs>
> going at US$88.00 but need to be confirmed. Anyway, need to check on the
> packing because standard is not 960 pcs. Will keep you update asap. Any idea
> on its standard pack ???
>>

>> 2\. Current item, Intel E28F320J5-120, found 3840 pcs going at US$71.00.
Are you interested. Got this news in the late evening, U.S. timing, can only
confirm on Monday.

>>

>> 3\. Need your help. Regarding the T/T remittance, I need your Taiwan office
to wire early on Monday morning, so that when U.S. starts their Monday,
hopefully the money will be in. (takes 24-36 hrs to be in). Please call Anita
to arrange this, it is very important to us. Please help. Our branch office
actually have their difficulties to answer to their supplier when the money
was delayed. I’m afaraid any more delay will spell trouble and my head will
roll. I need to answer to my boss.

>>

>> Thank you for your kind attention and look forward to your reply soon.

>>

>> Regards.

>>

>> P.S. This e-mail address is my home address, while I work on wkends.
Anyway, you have my contact number if you need to call me, right ???

31 When questioned by the court (page 280 of the NE) whether the first
defendants had indeed a branch office in the US, he replied in the negative.
When asked why then he used the phrase ‘our branch office in U.S.’ in his
e-mail dated 26 August 2000 addressed to the plaintiffs, his reply was: ‘In
this market, it is common to use counterparts’ branch office to show the close
link with the supplier’ (page 280 of the NE, lines 24-26). He admitted however
that his representation was untrue (page 281 of the NE).

32 His answers in cross-examination suggested (pages 303 and 304 of the NE)
that the first defendants were contemplating paying compensation to the
plaintiffs after the police had concluded that there was no criminal offence.
He added that they would have paid the compensation provided there was a
second purchase order from the plaintiffs. The evidence in this respect (pages
303 and 304 of the NE) reads as follows:

> > Q All right. Now, I’m going back to your police report, that is DB25, to
> the last sentence again which we’ve just touched on earlier, (reads) "We
> have refused to pay the compensation to Trigen as we think that they are in
> league with the Malaysian supplier and are trying to make off with the
> compensation", right?
>>

>> A Yes.

>>

>> Q So would I be correct to say now, all right, the only reason that the 1st
Defendants refused to pay the compensation is because you believe that they’re
in league with the Malaysian supplier? Now the police have concluded the
investigation, they have found no criminal offence. So there are no reasons
now for the 1st Defendants not to pay the compensation, would you agree?

>>

>> A I would agree at that time provided there was a second purchase order.

>>

>>> His Honour: Do you seriously expect a second purchase order when you’ve
not even supplied the goods for the first purchase order?

>>>

>>> Witness: Sorry, your Honour?

>>>

>>> His Honour: You haven’t supplied the goods, neither you nor T&M.

>>>

>>> Witness: Mm-hmm.

>>>

>>> His Honour: Then do you expect the Plaintiffs to give you a second order
and send you further monies?

>>>

>>> Witness: At that time, before the 3rd of September, before meeting up with
Mr Lee, the Plaintiff actually told us that there would be a second purchase
order. So at that time, we wanted to pay for the compensation---

>>>

>>> His Honour: What is the value of the second purchase order?

>>>

>>> Witness: The second purchase order is one dollar above the original one,
that is seventy-one.

>>>

>>> His Honour: For how many units?

>>>

>>> Witness: The same unit, 1,920 pieces.

>>>

>>> His Honour: So you will not make any money. The first purchase order,
you’ll be making about US$6,000.

>>>

>>> Witness: Yes.

>>>

>>> His Honour: Second one, you’ll make probably about $7,000. You pay about
$16,000 of compensation, your Company will lose $3,000. Wouldn’t your head
roll?

>>>

>>> Witness: We know from the Plaintiff that subsequent purchase order would
continue to come.

>>>

>>> His Honour: I see.

>>>

>>> Witness: Every week one purchase order.

>>>

>>> His Honour: All right.

>>

>> Q All right, Mr Loh, I’m putting to you, all right, these are my
instructions. One, now, there is a contract between the Plaintiffs and the 1st
Defendants for the purchase of the computer goods, that’s 1,920 pieces of the
computer chips, would you agree?

>>

>> A No.

Issues

**_

33 The main issue in this case was whether there was in fact a contract for
sale of goods between the first defendants and the plaintiffs or whether the
contract, if any, was between the plaintiffs and the second defendants, the
first defendants acting only as an intermediary or sourcing agents. The next
issue related to a pleading point. The issue here was whether the plaintiffs
in framing a claim against the second defendants in the alternative, as
pleaded in para 5 of the statement of claim, were prevented from proceeding
against the first defendants.

_**

Arguments

**_

34 Let me first summarise the first defendants’ contentions as advanced by
their counsel. His submissions as contained in the concluding part of his
closing submission read thus:

> > (1) the contract for the sale of the goods [was] not between the
> Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendants.
>>

>> (2) The contract for the sale of the goods [was] between the Plaintiffs and
the 2nd Defendants.

>>

>> (3) The quotation D11 [was] not the offer and accordingly incapable of
acceptance.

>>

>> (4) The purchase order (DB 13/14) [was] the offer by the Plaintiffs.

>>

>> (5) The 1st Defendants did not accept the offer; the offer was accepted by
the 2nd Defendants.

>>

>> (6) The Plaintiffs were aware that they were dealing with the 2nd
Defendants as their sellers and paid the purchase price of US$134,400.00 to
the 2nd Defendants in accordance with the Proforma Invoice (DB-15) issued by
the 2nd Defendants to the Plaintiffs.

>>

>> (7) The Plaintiffs’ "branch office allegation" [was] an afterthought. The
evidence [showed] that the allegations [were] untrue and cannot be relied
upon.

>>

>> (8) The 1st and 2nd Defendants [were] separate legal entities and sued as
such by the Plaintiffs. The "branch office allegation" [was] a material
allegation which [had] not been pleaded. The Plaintiffs [were] estopped from
doing so.

>>

>> (9) The Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendants [were] unsupported by
the evidence. The Plaintiffs [had] failed to prove their case on a balance of
probabilities.

35 The first defendants’ counsel’s supplemental submission insofar as was
material, was as follows:

> > The Pleading Point:

> > (1) The specific point requiring address here is:-
>>

>>> "whether or not, the Plaintiffs are bound by paragraph 5 of the amended
statement of claim"

>>

>> (2) Paragraph 5 starts off with the words:

>>

>>> "Alternatively, by a contract in writing as evidenced by a proforma
Invoice No. 1-2308 from the Second Defendants addressed to the Plaintiffs
dated the 23rd day of August 2000 but sent by the First Defendants to the
Plaintiffs, the Second Defendants agreed to sell and deliver 1920 pieces of
computer chips Model: Intel E28F320J5-120 at US$70.00 per piece to the
Plaintiffs on the following terms .…."

>>

>> (3) In essence, this paragraph states that it was the 2nd Defendants who
agreed to sell and deliver the goods in question.

>>

>> (4) As it turned out, on the special facts in this particular case, what
the Plaintiffs had pleaded in paragraph 5 is in fact what the 1st Defendants
say are the true facts of the matter.

>>

>> (5) It is well established that pleadings have a binding effect. The
Plaintiffs (and the Defendants) are bound by their respective pleadings.

>>

>> (6) The need for and the very purpose of pleadings make it crucial that the
rule whereby parties are bound by the respective pleadings be adhered to
strictly. Otherwise the position would be quite chaotic. Parties in a civil
case would be at large to wander as they wish and justice would not be done.

>>

>> …

>>

>> (9) The nett effect … is that the Plaintiffs’ are estopped and cannot be
heard to say that paragraph 5 of their amended statement of claim is of no
effect and do not bind them.

>>

>> …

36 The plaintiff’s counsel’s closing submission in brief was that the
plaintiffs, in the first instance entered into a contract for the supply of
goods with the first defendants as vendors. It was further submitted (see page
32 of plaintiffs’ written submission) that when DB-14 (the purchase order) was
returned by the first defendants to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs had no
reason to doubt that there was in fact a contract between the plaintiffs and
the first defendants as vendors and not otherwise. Plaintiffs’ counsel also
highlighted the aspect that Philip Loh in his e-mail (DB-18) addressed to the
plaintiffs, intimated to them that the first defendants’ branch office in US
had found the goods under reference for sale and their ‘branch office’ were
encountering difficulties in answering their suppliers on account of the delay
in payment.

37 In relation to the pleading point, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that
the alternative plea in para 5 of the statement of claim did not prevent them
from seeking judgment against the first defendants. He submitted that the
plaintiffs had made it clear at the commencement of the trial that they were
pursuing their claim only against the first defendants (see page 21, para 3.3
of their written submission) and so long as the plaintiffs had not entered
judgment against the second defendants, they were not precluded under law from
seeking relief and obtaining judgment against the first defendants.

_**

Conclusion

**_

38 As mentioned by me earlier, there were two main issues to be decided in
this case. The first issue was whether there was in fact a contract between
the plaintiffs and the first defendants for sale by the first defendants to
the plaintiffs, of 1920 pieces of computer chips (marked Intel E28F 320
J5-120) or whether the first defendants acted purely as sourcing agents or
intermediaries between the second defendants and the plaintiffs in relation to
the said sale. The other issue was whether the plaintiffs’ claim framed in the
alternative against the first and second defendants, barred the plaintiffs
from claiming relief against the first defendants in this action.

39 In determining who is entitled to sue or liable to be sued on a contract, a
useful point as suggested by Diplock LJ (as he then was) where the contract is
in writing, is to look at the contract itself (_**Teheran- Europe Co Ltd v S T
Belton (Tractors), Ltd**_ [1968] 2 All ER 886 at 890G). He further said at
page 893B:

> > … The task of the court in construing any contract is to look at the words
> used in the contract and at what has passed between the contracting parties
> before it was made, and to determine what it was that the party alleged to
> be in breach, by the words of the contract and his conduct, induced the
> other party to believe he was accepting a legally enforceable obligation to
> do or to refrain from doing. …

40 The key document in this case was the purchase order (DB-13). Dealing with
this document, the first defendants’ counsel’s submission was that the
purchase order DB-13 was to be regarded as an offer and that offer was
accepted not by the first defendants but by the second defendants and hence
the contract, if any, was between the plaintiffs and the second defendants and
not with the first defendants. In my determination, having regard to the
manner in which the parties were dealing with each other and the exchange of
the e-mails between them, the argument presented by the defendants’ counsel
did not appear to possess much cogency.

41 Much was spoken by counsel for the first defendants on the significance of
the signature under the confirmation column of the purchase order (DB-14) by J
B Lee of T & M International. In my view, the said signature - that too
inserted without prior consultation or the knowledge of the plaintiffs – did
not in any way alter the character of the contract entered (between the
plaintiffs and the first defendants) where the first defendants were
unequivocally identified and described as the vendors. If the first defendants
indeed were the sourcing agents, then they should have, before they returned
the purchase order to the plaintiffs, pointed out to the latter that their
role was merely that of sourcing agents or intemediaries.

42 Counsel for the first defendants attempted his best to argue his clients’
case by characterising them as sourcing agents and intemediaries between the
plaintiffs and the second defendants. But the documents produced to the court,
viewed in their proper perspective did not support his contention. On the
contrary, the first defendants were at all times seen to be projecting
themselves all along as the vendors of the goods. This was evident from the
first defendants’ e-mail dated 11 August 2000 (DB-8) – which commenced with
the opening line: ‘We are pleased to offer as follow. (sic)’ The said e-mail
also ended with this line: ‘Kindly let us know your decision soon as our
_supplier_ can only hold (sic) for 24 hours (highlight added).’ Again in the
first defendants’ e-mail dated 23 August 2000 (DB-11) with a subject heading
‘quotation’, the first defendants after stating, ‘we are pleased to offer as
follow’ (sic), seemed to be requesting the plaintiffs to forward them the
purchase order and T/T documents ‘in order for [the first defendants] to
secure these cargo.’ Similarly, in another e-mail dated 23 August 2000 (PB-6),
the first defendants were seen to be urging the plaintiffs to issue the
purchase order to Sinko – the first defendants - urgently.

43 Furthermore, the first defendants’ contention that they were only sourcing
agents or intemediaries did not seem to cohere with their representation that
the second defendants were their branch office as contained in the first
defendants’ e-mail dated 26 August 2000 (DB-18). When asked by the court why
they chose to describe the second defendants as their branch office, Philip
Loh could only say: ‘In this market, it is common to use counterparts’ branch
office to show the close link with the supplier.’ (page 280 (lines 24-26) and
page 281 (lines 8-9) of the NE). In my evaluation, if the first defendants
were in fact acting as sourcing agents or intemediaries, there was no reason
for Philip Loh to portray the second defendants as their branch office in
their e-mails.

44 It would also appear from the evidence of Sean Lim - which I accepted as
cogent and having a persuasive ring to it - that even after the non-delivery,
Philip Loh of the first defendants was trying to assuage the plaintiffs by
saying that the first defendants’ branch office ie, the second defendants
could not meet the agreed delivery deadline and the goods would be delayed to
the 5 or 6 of September 2000. There was no mention even at this stage that the
second defendants were the contracting parties with the plaintiffs and that
the plaintiffs should look to the second defendants and not to the first
defendants for relief.

45 Counsel for the first defendants submitted that since the branch office
aspect was not pleaded by the plaintiffs, the court should disregard any
submissions based on it. I found this argument totally disingenuous since the
very assertion that the second defendants were the branch office of the first
defendants was contained in the e-mails sent by the first defendants to the
plaintiffs and these documents were included in the defence bundle (DB-18) and
admitted in evidence without any qualification by the parties. In my opinion,
there was no validity in the argument by the first defendants’ counsel that a
litigant cannot rely on an uncontroverted document to add weight to his claim
or cast doubt on the veracity of the opponent. In the circumstances, the
argument so advanced by counsel for the first defendant ought to fail _in
limine_.

46 Another unsettling aspect in the first defendants’ case was that although J
B Lee of the second defendants was admittedly in Singapore on 3 and 4
September 2000 (pages 284 to 285 of the NE), Philip Loh who met J B Lee did
not even arrange for J B Lee to meet with the plaintiffs’ representatives.
This aspect strengthened the plaintiffs’ contention that the first defendants
were treating the second defendants as part of the latter. Furthermore, the
first defendants’ complaint to the police on 7 September 2000 (page 290 of the
NE) seemed to suggest that the first defendants were not mere sourcing agents
or intemediaries. If they were indeed such sourcing agents, they would not
have made the complaint in the form in which it had been made; and they would
have in fact required the second defendants to make the complaint.

47 Moreover, the report itself contained a passage which implied that the
parties who would be liable to pay compensation were the first defendants. The
passage adverted to reads: ‘We have refused to pay compensation to Trigen as
we think they are in league with the Malaysian supplier and are trying to make
off with the compensation.’ In this regard, Philip Loh let slip in his
explanation to the court (page 300 of the NE, lines 1 to 12) that at that
stage they were expecting another order from the plaintiffs and if such a
second order materialised, the first defendants would have paid the
compensation. In my determination, this explanation did not seem to lend any
credence to the first defendant’s stand that they were just sourcing agents
for the goods and at this juncture, I must also observe that I did not find
the evidence of Philip Loh that the first defendants were only sourcing agents
or intemediaries, as worthy of any credit.

48 Having considered all the evidence and arguments presented in regard to the
first issue, my conclusion was that the first defendants did indeed enter into
the agreement bespoken with the plaintiffs in the first instance, not as a
sourcing agents or intemediaries, but on the basis that they were the
contracting party. The first defendants’ subsequent acts in disclosing the
name and identity of their suppliers, ie the second defendant, requiring the
plaintiffs to make payment to the second defendants and making the second
defendants sign the purchase order as a confirming party, did not, in any way,
absolve the first defendants of their liability to the plaintiffs. In my view,
even if the first defendants were to be held as agents, it is a settled
principle of law (see para 168, Vol 1(2) _**Halsbury’s Laws of England**_ ,
4th Edn, reissue) that where a person makes a contract in his own name without
disclosing either the name or the existence of a principal, he is personally
liable on the contract to the other contracting party though he may be in fact
acting on a principal’s behalf. He will continue to be liable even after the
discovery of the agency by the other party unless and until there has been an
election by the other contracting party to look to the principal alone.

_**

The pleading issue

**_

49 As regards the second issue ie the pleading issue raised by the first
defendants in relation to para five of the statement of claim which was framed
in the alternative and the plaintiffs’ prayers for reliefs in the alternative,
plaintiffs’ counsel was on record from the outset that the plaintiffs were not
intent on applying for judgment against the second defendants and that the
inclusion of the second defendants in the statement of claim was merely to set
out both defendants’ respective liabilities. The plaintiffs’ counsel also made
it clear that the present hearing was directed only against the first
defendants and that the plaintiffs had not availed themselves of the
opportunity to enter interlocutory judgment against the second defendants,
although they could have done so much earlier. In my view, inasmuch as the
plaintiffs had not so far elected to obtain judgment against the second
defendants, they were not precluded from praying for judgment against the
first defendants.

50 In the case before me, the first defendants claiming to be the suppliers of
goods and later projecting the second defendants as their branch office were
in a position akin to persons acting on behalf of undisclosed principals. The
liability of such agents came for discussion before the English Court of
Appeal in _**Clarkson, Booker Ltd v Andjel**_ [1964] 3 All ER 260. The facts
of the case as appear in the headnotes of the case are as follows.

51 Acting on behalf of his undisclosed principals, an agent (the defendant)
for a travel agency company, contracting as if he were principal, booked
flights from Athens to London with the plaintiffs and received credit from
them for the tickets, having previously done business with them on credit
terms. The plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote letters to both the defendant and the
company stating that failing payment, proceedings for recovery from the
recipient of the letter might be commenced. They subsequently wrote further to
the travel agency company stating that they had instructions to obtain
judgment against the company ‘to safeguard [the plaintiffs’] interests’, and
subsequently they issued and served a writ against the company. Being later
informed that the company was insolvent and was going into voluntary
liquidation, the plaintiffs did not proceed with the action, but brought an
action against the defendant. The defendant contended that there had been a
binding election by the plaintiffs to pursue their remedy against the
principals, the company.

52 Affirming the decision of the court below, the Court of Appeal held that
although the commencement of proceedings by the plaintiffs against the
principals was _prima facie_ evidence of election, the issue of the writ
against them was not necessarily an abandonment of the plaintiffs’ cause of
action against the defendant, the agent; and, on the facts in the present
case, there had not been any final election by the plaintiffs to rely on the
liability of the company in exoneration of the defendant.

53 It was further held in that case (per curiam) if judgment had been obtained
by the plaintiffs against the principals, the cause of action would have
merged in the judgment and the plaintiffs could not subsequently have
recovered against the defendant.

54 It would appear from the views expressed in _**Clarkson Booker Ltd**_ that
election had to be unequivocal and final election would not take place until
the party had obtained judgment against one party. I am also of the same
opinion and in the premises, the argument by the first defendants’ counsel
that the plaintiffs were estopped from proceeding against the first defendants
as a result of para five of the statement of claim and the attendant prayers
for relief in the alternative, was in my determination, ill-founded.

55 There was one other detail which ought to be mentioned at this stage. The
plaintiffs’ claim was for the refund of the amount paid for the goods, ie
US$134,400 under prayer 1 and a further sum of US$15,360 under prayer 2 of the
statement of claim against the first defendants. There was no dispute raised
as to the figures stated by the parties and the evidence of the plaintiffs’
witnesses, in this connection, stood uncontroverted.

56 Following the principles articulated by Chua J in _**Bulsing Ltd v Joon
Seng & Co**_ [1972] 2 MLJ 43, that the general rule in the case of breach of
contract is that the plaintiffs by way of damages are entitled to be put in
the same position as he would have been if the contract had been completed, I
awarded judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of US$134,4000 under prayer 1
and a further sum of US$15,360 under prayer 2 of the statement of claim
against the first defendants together with interests thereon at the rate of 6%
per annum on the said sums from the date of writ until judgment, and costs to
be taxed, if not agreed upon.

_

Order accordingly.
