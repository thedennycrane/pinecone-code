Quentin Loh J:

Introduction

1 This is an application for the determination of ancillary matters. I have to
decide on the division of matrimonial assets and the issue of maintenance for
the defendant and a child who has been accepted as a member of the family.

Background facts

2 The plaintiff (“the Husband”) and the defendant (“the Wife”) were married on
24 March 1979.[note: 1] They have been living apart since 1996.[note: 2] They
had one child, one Yong Jun, who is currently 30 years of age.[note: 3] The
Husband also had two other children from another relationship, _viz_ , one
Yong Wei and one Yong Li.[note: 4] They are both currently 23 years old and
are financially dependent on the Husband.[note: 5] Yong Li was accepted as a
member of the family.

3 The Husband applied for and obtained an interim judgment for divorce on 2
July 2008.[note: 6] The ground for divorce was that the parties had lived
apart for a continuous period of at least four years immediately preceding the
filing of the writ of divorce.[note: 7] The interim judgment was made final on
17 March 2010.[note: 8] The Husband has since remarried. His current wife is
one Fan Yu Yan (“Fan”).[note: 9]

Issues

4 I have to consider the following issues:

(a) the division of matrimonial assets;

(b) maintenance for the Wife; and

(c) maintenance for Yong Li.

Division of matrimonial assets

5 The Court of Appeal held in _NK v NL_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“ _NK_ ”) that
there are two broad approaches to the division of matrimonial assets, _viz_ ,
the “global assessment methodology” and the “classification methodology (see
_NK_ at [31]–[32]). I will adopt the global assessment methodology in the
present case. It would be conducive to fairness and justice to adopt this
approach to minimise the reshuffling of assets.

6 I will analyse the issue of the division of matrimonial assets in the
following manner:

(a) determining and valuing the pool of matrimonial assets;

(b) considering the direct contributions of the parties;

(c) considering the indirect contributions of the parties;

(d) deciding on a just and equitable apportionment of the matrimonial assets
and making orders to achieve this most conveniently.

Step 1: Determining and valuing the pool of matrimonial assets

The definition of matrimonial assets

7 Section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the
Charter”) provides for the following definition of matrimonial assets:

(10) In this section, “matrimonial asset” means —

(a) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the
marriage —

(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their
children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation
or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or

(ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other
party or by both parties to the marriage; and

(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or
both parties to the marriage,

but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been
acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been
substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both
parties to the marriage.

The operative date for determining the matrimonial assets

8 As held in a recent Court of Appeal decision (_viz_ , _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay
Ang Choo Nancy_ [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“ _Nancy Tay_ ”)), there is no single
operative date that would be applicable in all cases. On the facts in this
case, I reached the conclusion that an appropriate cut-off date was the date
of the interim judgment for divorce because the hearing for the determination
of ancillary matters took place more than three years after the interim
judgment for divorce was obtained. For the same reason, I am of the view that
the appropriate date for the determination of the matrimonial assets in the
present case is the date of the interim judgment. As I have noted above,
interim judgment was obtained on 2 July 2008 (see [3] above). The hearing of
the ancillary matters only took place on 14 November 2011.

9 It should be noted that for assets acquired after this operative date, the
funds used to acquire the assets should be restored to the common pool for the
purpose of the division of matrimonial assets (see _Nancy Tay_ at [33]). This
is necessary in order to prevent spouses from dissipating the common pool
after interim judgment has been granted (_ibid_).

The operative date for valuing the matrimonial assets

10 Jointly owned assets should be valued at the date of the judgment for
ancillary matters. Matrimonial assets that are held in the names of each
party, _ie_ , separately owned matrimonial assets, should be valued at the
date on which the matrimonial assets were determined. However, it must be
noted that these dates are just starting points. They may be departed from in
appropriate cases in order to reach a just and equitable division.

Jointly owned assets

(1) The matrimonial home

11 The parties’ matrimonial home at Block 103 Cashew Road #15-01 Cashew
Heights Singapore 679674 (“the Matrimonial Home”) was purchased in 1991.[note:
10] The outstanding mortgage loan on the Matrimonial Home is S$141,501.38 as
at 31 December 2009 (this is the most recent figure that the parties have
placed before me).[note: 11] The Husband’s counsel referred me to recent
transactions in 2011 (as reflected in the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s
records of caveats lodged against properties in the same condominium) which
suggested a valuation of around S$1.3m to S$1.45m.[note: 12] The most recent
transaction was in the amount of S$1,388,000.[note: 13] Deducting the
outstanding mortgage loan from that figure, I will adopt a valuation of
S$1,246,498.62.

(2) Joint account

12 The parties have a joint account with the Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corporation (“the Joint Account”). The latest available balance in the account
(as at 31 May 2010) is S$3,118.02.[note: 14]

Assets held in the Husband’s own name

(1) Motor vehicles

13 As of the date of the interim judgment, the Husband had three vehicles in
his name:[note: 15]

(a) A “Mercedes Benz 240E” motor vehicle with the registration number SDH
6688L (“the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle”);

(b) A “Mitsubishi Colt 1.5” motor vehicle with the registration number SDP
6886P (“the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle”); and

(c) An “Alfa Romeo 2.0” motor vehicle with the registration number SDP 6006P
(“the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle”).

14 According to the Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means (which was
filed on 8 June 2009), the values of the vehicles and the outstanding loans on
the vehicles were as follows:[note: 16]

Vehicle |  Value |  Outstanding loan  
---|---|---  
The Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle |  S$59,345 |  S$61,469.40 (as at 3 April 2009)  
The Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle |  S$16,900 |  S$36,880 (as at 30 June 2008)  
The Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle |  S$45,001 |  S$111,030.75 (as at 2 March 2009  
  
  

15 The values of the vehicles in the preceding paragraph were based on open
market values as obtained from the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”). The
Husband later recognised that it was incorrect to have used those
figures.[note: 17] He then provided the court with values based on figures
obtained from the website www.sgcarmart.com on 31 January 2011. By this time,
however, the Husband had sold the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle and acquired a
“Mercedes Benz 250E” motor vehicle with the same registration number of SDH
6688L (“the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle”).[note: 18] Hence, he provided a
market value for the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle instead of the Mercedes Benz
240E Vehicle. This was an error because, as I explain below, the Mercedes Benz
250E Vehicle is not a matrimonial asset (see [18] below). The market values of
the other two vehicles (_viz_ , the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle and the Alfa
Romeo 2.0 Vehicle) as at 31 January 2011, together with updated figures for
the outstanding loans on those vehicles, is as follows:

Vehicle |  Value[note: 19] |  Outstanding loan[note: 20]  
---|---|---  
The Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle |  S$31,000 |  S$16,406.15 (as at 24 June 2010)  
The Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle |  S$64,800 |  S$84,586.13 (as at 30 June 2008)  
  
  

16 It would have been ideal if the parties had provided me with the market
values and outstanding loans as at the date of the interim judgment.
Unfortunately, the parties have not provided me with those figures. I must,
however, do the best that I can on the evidence available. I accept the
Husband’s valuation of the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle and the Alfa Romeo 2.0
Vehicle. Taking the latest available figures (_ie_ , the figures in the table
at [15] above), I value the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle at S$14,593.85. I will
disregard the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle because it has a negative value (see
_Nancy Tay_ at [61] where cars bought on hire-purchase were disregarded
because they were of negative value).

17 As for the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle, the Husband has only provided me
with the open market value of that vehicle from the LTA (see [14] above).
However, it is possible to deduce a more accurate value from other evidence on
the record. As noted above, the Husband sold the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle
and acquired the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle in January 2010. According to the
“order specifications / booking form” for the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle (“the
Order Form”), another vehicle was traded-in for S$84,000 in the same
transaction.[note: 21] Although the Order Form does not provide the
particulars of the vehicle that was traded-in, I gather from the text of the
Husband’s third affidavit of assets and means that the vehicle traded-in was
the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle. In this affidavit, the Husband explained that
one of his reasons for selling the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle was that he was
advised that it was better to sell it because “it could still fetch a better
price of [S]_$84,000_ (in January 2010) before it approached the 6th year by
April 2010” [emphasis added].[note: 22] I therefore find that the market price
of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle was approximately S$84,000. I should
reiterate that this is not the ideal way of valuing the Mercedes Benz 240E
Vehicle because what I should determine is the market price of the Mercedes
Benz 240E Vehicle as at the date of the interim judgment. On this approach,
the value of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle is S$22,530.60 (this figure is
derived by deducting the only available figure for the outstanding loan for
the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle (_viz_ , S$61,469.40 (as at 3 April 2009) – see
the table at [14] above) from my estimation of the market price of the
Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle (_viz_ , $84,000)).

18 As noted above, the Husband purchased the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle in
January 2010\. He claimed that he held the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle on trust
for Chong Park Medical Hall (S) Pte Ltd (“Chong Park Singapore”).[note: 23] I
do not accept his bare assertion that the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle, which
was registered in his name, was held on trust. The Husband produced no
documentary evidence to support the existence of the trust. I find, however,
that the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle is not a matrimonial asset simply because
it was acquired after the date of the interim judgment.

(2) Insurance policies

19 The Husband has the following insurance policies in his name:

Policy |  Surrender Value  
---|---  
NTUC Income “Living” policy (Policy Number 6837579-3) |  S$5,156.80 (as at 10 October 2008)[note: 24]  
NTUC Income “Anticipation” policy (Policy Number 6837577-7) |  S$4,739.94 (as at 10 October 2008)[note: 25]  
NTUC Income “Dependent’s Protection Scheme” policy (Policy Number 7000645266) |  S$0  
American International Assurance Co Ltd (“AIA”) “21 year Special Anticipated Endowment” policy (Policy Number L517958328) |  Assigned to Yong Jun[note: 26]; no value provided before assignment[note: 27]  
AIA “Special Anticipated Endowment” policy (Policy Number Q515379255) |  Assigned to Yong Jun[note: 28]; no value provided before assignment[note: 29]  
Great Eastern Life Policy Number 0722664-6 (“the Great Eastern Life Policy”) |  S$993.67 (as at 5 March 2010)[note: 30]  
Great Eastern Life “Whole Life” policy (Policy Number 0057175559) |  RM65,782.56 (as at 9 July 2010)[note: 31]  
Great Eastern Life “Medical Insurance” policy (Policy Number 922642009) |  RM62,395.50 (as at 9 July 2010)[note: 32]  
  
  

It should be noted that the Husband provided updated figures for the surrender
values of the NTUC Income “Living” policy (Policy Number 6837579-3) and the
NTUC Income “Anticipation” policy (Policy Number 6837577-7) in his second
affidavit of assets and means.[note: 33] I will, however, adopt the earlier
figures in his first affidavit of assets and means because I am assessing the
value of the insurance policies as at the date of the interim judgment (see
[10] above). I have no alternative but to adopt the surrender values of the
three Great Eastern Life policies in the Husband’s second affidavit of assets
and means because the Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means does not
provide the relevant figures.

20 I find that the Husband’s insurance policies have the surrender values as
stated in the table at [19] above. The Husband provided documentation from the
respective insurers to support his figures. As the Wife did not propose an
exchange rate, I will use the Husband’s proposed exchange rate of RM2.47 per
unit of SGD.[note: 34] At this exchange rate, the two Great Eastern Life
policies in the table at [19] above are valued at S$26,632.62 and S$25,261.34,
respectively.

21 Before me, the Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband had taken out a
loan of S$36,000 against the Great Eastern Life Policy in 2005.[note: 35] As
the Husband’s counsel submitted, no allegation had been made before of a loan
being taken up against the policy.[note: 36] I will disregard the Wife’s
allegation of a loan in the absence of any documentary evidence to support the
existence of the loan.

(3) Shares in listed companies

22 The Husband had shares in listed companies with a market value of
S$14,911.14 as at 31 August 2008.[note: 37] I will adopt this valuation in
preference to an updated figure that the Husband provided in his second
affidavit of assets and means.

(4) Shares in private companies

23 In his first affidavit of assets and means, the Husband listed the
following companies under the section entitled “Any Other
Issues/Information”:[note: 38]

(a) Chong Park Singapore;

(b) Chong Park Medical Hall Sdn Bhd (“Chong Park Malaysia”);

(c) Jun Marketing Snd Bhd (“Jun Marketing”); and

(d) Rhino Distributors Sdn Bhd (“Rhino Distributors”).

The Husband disclosed that he held 49% of the shares in Rhino
Distributors.[note: 39] He did not, however, disclose his shareholdings in the
other companies listed above.

24 It was only in his second affidavit of assets and means that the Husband
disclosed his shareholding in the companies listed at [23].[note: 40] He also
disclosed that he was a shareholder in two other companies, _viz_ , IDR
Superior Marketing (“IDR Superior”) and Chong Park Pharmaceuticals Sdn Bhd
(“Chong Park Pharmaceuticals”).[note: 41] The Husband’s shareholdings are
tabulated below:[note: 42]

Company |  Husband’s shareholding  
---|---  
Chong Park Singapore |  51%  
Chong Park Malaysia |  95%  
Jun Marketing |  80%  
Rhino Distributors |  49%  
IDR Superior |  50%  
Chong Park Pharmaceuticals |  49%  
  
  

25 The Husband has provided valuations of _his shares_ in the above companies.
The valuations are tabulated below:

Company |  Valuation |  Date of the Valuation  
---|---|---  
Chong Park Singapore |  S$147,273[note: 43] |  15 July 2010[note: 44]  
Jun Marketing |  RM1[note: 45] |  1 June 2010[note: 46]  
Rhino Distributors |  Nil[note: 47] |  23 June 2010[note: 48] and 29 March 2011[note: 49]  
IDR Superior |  RM294,597[note: 50] |  1 June 2010[note: 51]  
Chong Park Pharmaceuticals |  RM97,687[note: 52] |  26 October 2010[note: 53]  
  
  

As for Chong Park Malaysia, the Husband deposed that he has not valued the
company because it has been dormant since 2006.[note: 54]

26 The Wife referred the valuation reports on Jun Marketing and IDR Superior
to an accountant, Mr Goh Ngiap Suan (“Mr Goh”).[note: 55] I note that the text
of the Wife’s affidavit of assets and means dated 13 December 2010 at [37]
stated that Mr Goh was referred to the valuation reports on Rhino Distributors
and IDR Superior. However, the letter from Mr Goh which was exhibited in the
affidavit stated that Mr Goh was referred the reports on Jun Marketing and IDR
Superior (see p 79 of the same affidavit). Be that as it may, Mr Goh
criticised the reports in the following terms: [note: 56]

…

(a)We noted that both reports are not signed and dated to prove their origins.

(b)We noted that the reports include no name(s) and qualification(s) of the
preparer(s) to prove that they are prepared by professionals with relevant
professional competencies. We also noted that the reports include no relevant
source materials on which the valuations are based upon, i.e. relevant
financial statements and market research materials leading to the provision of
equity premiums and risk premiums.

(c)We noted that the reports are addressed to just [the Husband] and not to a
general audience.

(d)We noted that the figures used in the report, Valuation of the Equity of
[the Husband] in [Jun Marketing] differ from the figures reported in the
balance sheet as at 30 September 2008 of the said company.

(e)We noted the reference number (AF 0155) stated on the cover pages of both
reports and did a World Wide Web search. Our search results show that the
search on the list of CPA in Malaysia has audit firm number AF0155.

We also noted that the reports are not printed with their official letterhead,
company registration number and any other professional accreditation reference
numbers.

(f)With respect to [Jun Marketing], we noted that source materials, such as
financial statements including statements of comprehensive incomes, financial
position and changes in equity, are not included in the report to substantiate
the facts mentioned therein.

With respect to [IDR Superior], we noted the premium of 18% arise [_sic_] from
the fact that the company is an owner-operated business. Little literature has
been written on such company-specific risk premium in particular. We noted
that there are no document and information to substantiate the premium rates
used in the report. This information may include the following:

1)A market research report on the risk premiums of Malaysian companies of
similar attributes including company size and business types

2)Documents to provide basis for the premium allocated for an owner-operated
business, with supporting information from average market rates of such
premium

3)Financial statements including income statement, balance sheet and statement
of changes in equity.

…

27 The formal objections to the valuation reports, such as the absence of a
date or the names and qualifications of the authors, were addressed in the
Husband’s third affidavit of assets and means. In this affidavit, he exhibited
the cover pages of the reports which state the dates, names and qualifications
of the author of the reports.[note: 57] As for the other criticisms, the Wife
did not provide her own valuations of the companies in a manner that addressed
the criticisms. The approach that she took was to simply criticise aspects of
the valuations by the Husband. This leaves me with some difficulty as to how I
should value the Husband’s shares in the companies.

28 I note that the Court of Appeal in _NK_ ordered the parties to agree to
appoint a valuer to value a company within a time period, failing which the
court would appoint a valuer (see _NK_ at [54]). The court further ordered
that the valuation would be final (see _NK_ at [54]). The dispute did not,
however, end there. The husband in _NK_ invoked the “liberty to apply” clause
in the court’s order to dispute the valuation of the court-appointed valuer
and to seek a revaluation (see _NK v NL_ [2010] 4 SLR 792at [5]).

29 One option is to follow the approach of the Court of Appeal in _NK_ by
ordering the parties to agree to appoint another valuer within a time period,
failing which I could appoint a valuer. However, the situation in the present
case is different from that in _NK_. The Court of Appeal in _NK_ did not have
a valuation report before it. In contrast, I already have valuation reports.

30 In my view, it is not in the interests of fairness and justice to order a
further valuation. Such a course would prolong the resolution of the ancillary
matters further and would entail further costs for both parties.
Notwithstanding Mr Goh’s criticisms, I accept the Husband’s figures as they
are the only available evidence before the court of the value of his shares in
the companies. Applying the exchange rate that I adopted _vis-à-vis_ the
insurance policies (see [20] above), the Husband’s shares have the following
values in SGD:

Company |  Valuation  
---|---  
Chong Park Singapore |  S$147,273  
Jun Marketing |  S$0.40  
Rhino Distributors |  Nil  
IDR Superior |  S$119,270.04  
Chong Park Pharmaceuticals |  S$39,549.39  
  
  

(5) Money in bank accounts

31 In his first affidavit of assets and means, the Husband stated that he had
the following amounts in his bank accounts:[note: 58]

Bank account |  Balance  
---|---  
Development Bank of Singapore (“DBS”) account (“the DBS Account”) |  S$5,468.82 (as at 31 October 2008)  
Post Office Savings Bank (“POSB”) account (joint savings account with Yong Li) (“the POSB Account”) |  S$2,100.20 (as at 14 October 2008)  
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (Malaysia) account (joint account with Yong Jun) (“the HSBC Account”) |  RM34,109.27 (as at 3 September 2008)  
  
  

The Husband also included the balances in the corporate accounts for his
companies. The Husband does not explain the reason for including these
corporate accounts in his first affidavit of assets and means (_viz_ ,
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation ­– S$34,443.06, United Overseas Bank
(Malaysia) – RM18,305.38 and United Overseas Bank – RM20,000). These accounts
are not mentioned in his second affidavit of assets and means. This appears to
be an error.

32 In his second affidavit of assets and means, the Husband provided an update
of the balances in his accounts:[note: 59]

(a) The DBS Account had gone into overdraft in the amount of S$3,449.25 (as at
31 March 2010).

(b) The balance in the HSBC Account had reduced substantially to RM3,498.91
(as at 28 February 2010).

(c) The POSB Account had been closed on 19 February 2009 and the outstanding
balance of S$2,269.07 was deposited into the DBS Account.[note: 60]

I will adopt the balances in the Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means
because those balances are closer in time to the interim judgment.

33 In addition, the Husband disclosed that he had two further accounts:[note:
61]

Bank account |  Balance  
---|---  
Public Growth Fund |  RM42,440.36 (as at 31 January 2010)  
Standard Chartered Account |  RM2,796.69 (as at 20 June 2010)  
  
  

The Husband has not provided me with the balances in the above accounts as at
the date of the interim judgment. In the absence of any better evidence, I
will include the amounts stated in the table above in the common pool.

34 The Husband also disclosed that he used to have four Standard Chartered
Bank accounts which were closed.[note: 62] He claimed that the balances in the
accounts were withdrawn and used for financing the operations of one of his
companies, Rhino Distributors.[note: 63] In my view, the reason why the
accounts were closed is immaterial. The money in those accounts were
matrimonial assets. From an examination of the relevant bank statements, the
accounts had the following amounts before they were closed:[note: 64]

(a) RM20,008.15;

(b) RM10,024.41;

(c) RM5,012.20; and

(d) RM1,112.99.

In the absence of any evidence as to the amounts in these closed accounts as
at the date of the interim judgment, I will include the above amounts in the
common pool.

35 It should be noted that the Wife claimed that a RM250,000 structured
investment that the Husband had with HSBC (“the HSBC Structured Investment”)
should be included as part of the matrimonial assets.[note: 65] The HSBC
Structured Investment was later redeemed prematurely by six months. The
redemption amount was paid into the Husband’s bank account.[note: 66] The
Husband explained that the HSBC Structured Investment was used for Yong Jun’s
overseas education (Yong Jun confirmed this in an affidavit).[note: 67] The
Husband said that after Yong Jun’s education was completed, the Husband
withdrew the balance and used it to pay for legal fees for proceedings against
Chong Park Malaysia and Rhino Distributors, as well as for payment to
suppliers.[note: 68] In any event, the HSBC Structured Investment was taken up
on 13 August 2008, after the interim judgment was finalised. Hence, it is not
a matrimonial asset.

36 In summary, the following amounts of cash in the Husband’s bank accounts
should be included in the common pool:

Bank account |  Balance  
---|---  
The DBS Account |  S$5,468.82  
The POSB Account |  S$2,100.20  
The HSBC Account |  RM34,109.27  
Public Growth Fund |  RM42,440.36  
Standard Chartered Bank Account |  RM2,796.69  
Closed Standard Chartered Bank account |  RM20,008.15  
Closed Standard Chartered Bank account |  RM10,024.41  
Closed Standard Chartered Bank account |  RM5,012.20  
Closed Standard Chartered Bank account |  RM1,112.99  
Total (S$) |  S$7,569.02  
Total (RM) |  RM115,504.07  
  
  

37 Using the same exchange rate of RM2.47 per unit of SGD, the value of the
Husband’s RM deposits is equivalent to S$46,762.78.

(6) Money in Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts

38 In his first affidavit of assets and means, the Husband reproduced a
statement of the balances in his CPF accounts.[note: 69] He had S$32,475.71 in
his Medisave Account and S$59,507.32 in his Retirement Account. His Ordinary
Account and Special Account had zero balances.[note: 70] Those amounts are
part of the common pool. I will not take into account the updated figures
provided in the Husband’s second affidavit of assets and means.

39 It should be noted that the Husband admits that he withdrew the amount of
S$62,557.77 from one of his CPF accounts on 23 November 2007.[note: 71] This
money was deposited into the DBS Account on 26 November 2007.[note: 72] The
Wife’s counsel submitted that this money should be reflected as part of the
matrimonial assets.[note: 73] I agree with the Husband’s counsel that this
amount should not be included in the common pool. The money was withdrawn and
deposited into the DBS Account well before the divorce proceedings had even
commenced.

(7) Club memberships

40 In his first affidavit of assets and means, the Husband only disclosed that
he was a member of Raffles Town Club (“RTC”).[note: 74] He deposed that his
RTC membership had “hardly any value”.[note: 75]

41 In his second affidavit of assets and means, the Husband disclosed that he
was also a member of the Starhill Golf Club in Malaysia (“Starhill”) and the
Singapore Recreation Club (“SRC”).[note: 76] He estimated the market price of
his Starhill membership at S$2,000 and his SRC membership at S$11,500 by
referring to advertisements in the “Classified” section of The Straits
Times.[note: 77] After taking into account transfer fees, his Starhill
membership had a negative value and his SRC membership had a value of
S$8,290.[note: 78]

42 I accept the Husband’s valuation of his SRC membership at S$8,290.

(8) Property purchased with new wife

43 On 14 August 2005, the Husband purchased a property at Block 810 Bedok
Reservoir Road #09-10 Baywater Condo, Singapore 479241 (“the Baywater
Property”) together with his current wife, Fan.[note: 79]

44 I first have to determine the value of the Baywater Property at the time of
the interim judgment. In his first affidavit of assets and means, the Husband
estimated that the Baywater Property had a value of S$600,000.[note: 80]
However, the Husband did not provide any basis or documentary evidence for his
estimation. It was only in his second affidavit of assets and means that he
provided an estimation of S$862,330 based on transacted prices as at April
2010.[note: 81] In the absence of better evidence of the value of the Baywater
Property, I accept the Husband’s estimation of S$862,330. The outstanding
mortgage loan as at 5 February 2010 is S$385,421.63.[note: 82] Hence, I
estimate the net value of the Baywater Property to be S$476,908.37.

45 I next have to determine the value of the _Husband’s share_ of the Baywater
Property at the time of the interim judgment. The Husband and Fan are joint
tenants of the Baywater Property.[note: 83] At the time of the interim
judgment, the Husband was not married to Fan (according to the Husband’s
counsel, the Husband and Fan married in 2010[note: 84]). Their contributions
to the purchase price of the Baywater Property were unequal, with Fan
contributing more.[note: 85] In view of their unequal contributions, at the
time of the interim judgment, there would have been a presumption of resulting
trust, _ie_ , the Husband and Fan would be presumed to hold the Baywater
Property as tenants in common at equity in the proportions of their
contribution to the purchase price (see _Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence
and another_ [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“ _Lau Siew Kim_ ”) at [107]). There would
not have been a counter-presumption of advancement because, at the time of the
interim judgment, the Husband and Fan were not in a spousal relationship and
the conventional position is that the presumption of advancement does not
apply in a _de facto_ spousal relationship (see _Lau Siew Kim_ at [73]).
Although the Court of Appeal in _Lau Siew Kim_ did not exclude the possibility
of a future argument for the expansion of the presumption to such
relationships (see _Lau Siew Kim_ at [74]), no argument was made by either
party that the presumption of advancement was applicable as between the
Husband and Fan at the time of the interim judgment. I see no reason why the
presumption of resulting trust would be rebutted in the present case. Hence, I
find that at the time of the interim judgment, the Husband and Fan held the
Baywater Property as tenants in common at equity in the proportions of their
contributions to the purchase price. As for the proportions held by the
Husband and Fan, mortgage repayments and other financial contributions after
the acquisition of the Baywater Property will not be considered unless there
was an agreement between them on the repayment of the mortgage (see _Lau Siew
Kim_ at [115]–[116]). There is no evidence of an agreement between the Husband
and Fan on the amounts that they would each contribute towards the mortgage on
the Baywater Property. Hence, I can only take into account their contributions
to the downpayment. In this regard, I accept that the Husband contributed
S$45,590 and Fan contributed S$75,810 to the S$121,400 downpayment.[note: 86]
On this view, the Husband’s share of the Baywater Property was 37.5% at the
time of the interim judgment. On my valuation of the Baywater Property, the
Husband share is accordingly worth S$179,317.55.

Assets held in the Wife’s own name

(1) Insurance policies

46 The Wife disclosed in her third affidavit of assets and means that she
purchased an insurance policy in 1978 before her marriage. This policy matured
on 28 May 2000, well before the interim judgment.[note: 87] This is not a
matrimonial asset.

(2) Shares in listed companies

47 The Wife has shares in listed companies. Those shares were worth a total of
S$173,446.19, US$3,320 and HK$6,600 as at 31 July 2008.[note: 88] She
separately holds shares in listed companies through her CPF Investment
Account. Those shares were valued at S$150,644.37 as at 31 July 2008.[note:
89] I will adopt these valuations of her shares in preference to an updated
figure that she provided in a later affidavit of assets and means.[note: 90] I
will use the Husband’s proposed exchange rates of US$0.83 per unit of SGD and
HK$6.48 per unit of SGD to determine the SGD equivalents of the shares held in
USD and HKD respectively.[note: 91] Applying these exchange rates, the USD
denominated shares are worth S$4,000 and HKD denominated shares are worth
S$1,018.52.

48 In her third affidavit of assets and means, the Wife deposed that she had
inadvertently omitted to disclose that she has shares in various Malaysian
listed companies. Those shares were acquired more than 10 years ago.[note: 92]
She estimated that those shares were worth approximately S$10,000.[note: 93] I
note that the Wife used the currency symbol (_ie_ , “$”) for her Malaysian
shares in both her affidavit (at [63]) and her written submissions (at p 8).
In her affidavit, she used the currency symbol for all assets denominated in
SGD. Hence, I deduced that her Malaysian shares were valued at _S_ $10,000.
The Husband, however, has stated the value of the Malaysian shares at _RM_
10,000 (see Annex B to the Husband’s Skeletal Arguments). It is not possible
to determine the true value from the Bursa Malaysia statements that the Wife
exhibited in her affidavit because those statements do not state the market
values of the shares. I therefore assume the figure to be in SGD. These shares
are matrimonial assets.

(3) Unit trusts

49 The Wife also has investments in unit trusts. Although she disclosed that
she had such investments in her first affidavit of assets and means, the
values of her investments and the full list of her investments were not
clearly stated. I will adopt the following valuation of her investments as
stated in her third affidavit of assets and means:[note: 94]

Unit trust |  Value  
---|---  
“First State Global Balanced Fund” (held with First State Investments) |  S$2,980.01  
“Templeton Global Balanced Fund Class A (ACC) SGD” (held with Franklin Templeton Investments) |  US$2,472.53  
“Eight Portfolio C” (held with DBS Asset Management) |  S$5,228.72  
“Schroder Asian Growth Fund (S$ Class)” (held with Schroders) |  S$3,949.89  
“Lionglobal Singapore/Malaysia Fund SGD Class” (held with Lion Global Investors Ltd) |  S$6,653.92  
Total SGD |  S$18,812.54  
Total USD |  US$2,472.53  
  
  

Using the exchange rate adopted above in relation to the Wife’s shares (see
[47] above), the Wife’s investment in USD unit trusts is worth S$2,978.95.

(4) Shares in private companies

50 The Wife did not disclose in her affidavits of assets and means that she
was a shareholder of Chong Park Singapore. However, in his second affidavit of
assets and means, the Husband deposed that the Wife owned 49% of the shares in
Chong Park Singapore.[note: 95] In his written submissions, the Wife’s counsel
stated that the Wife owned 49% of the shares in Chong Park Singapore.[note:
96]

51 I have already accepted the Husband’s valuation of his shares in Chong Park
Singapore (see [30] above). Adjusting his valuation, I value the Wife’s shares
in Chong Park Singapore at S$141,497.79.

(5) Money in bank accounts

52 As disclosed in her first affidavit of assets and means, the Wife had the
sum of S$21,807.16 in a joint account with Yong Jun as at 11 August
2008.[note: 97] I will adopt this figure in preference to the updated figure
in a subsequent affidavit.

(6) Money in CPF accounts

53 In her first affidavit of assets and means, the Wife reproduced her CPF
Statement of Account for January to December 2007. This statement disclosed
that she had the following amounts in her respective accounts:

(a) Ordinary Account: S$21,392.19;

(b) Special Account: S$3,901.80; and

(c) Medisave Account: S$26539.11.

I will use these figures in preference to updated figures provided in later
affidavits.

Step 2: Considering the direct financial contributions of the parties

55 There was initially a dispute on the extent of the Wife’s direct cash
contributions to the Matrimonial Home. The Wife asserted that she paid an
amount of S$14,688 as part of the downpayment and that she contributed
S$10,000 for renovations.[note: 98] The Husband disputed this.[note: 99]
However, at the hearing before me, both counsel agreed that it was “not really
disputed” that the proportions of the direct contributions were 75:25 in
favour of the Husband. In the light of this concession, I find that the direct
contributions to the Matrimonial Home were in the ratio of 75:25 in the
Husband’s favour.

56 Apart from the contributions to the Matrimonial Home, the Husband deposed
in his third affidavit of assets and means to paying for utility bills,
telephone bills, television and cable television charges, management
corporation charges, household maintenance and repairs.[note: 100]

Step 3: Considering the indirect contributions of the parties

57 The Wife resigned from her employment as a personal assistant in 1993 to
take care of Yong Jun and Yong Li.[note: 101] There was initially some dispute
as to whether the Wife cared for the children. In his second affidavit of
assets and means, the Husband deposed that his mother took care of the
children, that he enlisted a maid to assist in caring for the children and
that the Wife “hardly looked after the children”.[note: 102] The Wife
contested this.[note: 103] She also referred to an affidavit filed by her
former maid in which it was deposed that the Husband’s mother did not play a
role in Yong Li’s care. The former maid also said that the Wife showed Yong Li
“unconditional care” and that the Wife was a “full-time mother” after she gave
up her employment.[note: 104] Yong Jun and Yong Li also filed affidavits. Yong
Jun deposed that the Wife was an “exemplary mother” and that she committed to
being a full-time mother after she resigned from her employment in 1993.[note:
105] Yong Li expressed her gratitude at the Wife’s acceptance of her
notwithstanding that she was not her biological daughter.[note: 106] She also
explained that she was cared for by her mother with the assistance of their
former maid.[note: 107] I accept that the Wife made extensive indirect
contributions in caring for the children. Indeed, in his written submissions,
the Husband’s counsel submitted that the Husband acknowledged and was grateful
for the role that the Wife played in the care of Yong Jun and Yong Li.[note:
108]

58 However, the Husband asserted that he also helped to care for the
children.[note: 109] He referred in this regard to affidavits deposed to by
Yong Jun and Yong Li:

(a) Yong Jun deposed that his father contributed financially to the
family.[note: 110] He also paid for his overseas education.[note: 111] Yong
Jun said that he would not have graduated without the Husband’s “moral and
financial support”.[note: 112] Yong Jun also recounted that his father bought
him the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle as a reward for his good results at a
polytechnic.[note: 113] Yong Jun further deposed that the Husband assisted him
with starting a business by the name of “Alldo Resources Sdn Bhd” (“Alldo
Resources”).[note: 114] He claimed that the Husband assisted him with running
the business when Yong Jun decided to further his education overseas.[note:
115]

(b) Yong Li deposed that the Husband has been supporting the family
financially.[note: 116] The Husband also covered her expenses and gave her the
money that she needed, both for education expenses as well as other expenses
such as holiday trips.[note: 117]

59 On the basis of the evidence of Yong Jun and Yong Li, which I accept, I
find that the Husband also contributed both financially and non-financially to
the care for the children. However, it is fair to say that the Wife’s
contributions were more substantial. The Husband’s non-financial contributions
were supportive in nature.

60 The Wife also claimed to have contributed to Chong Park Singapore after her
resignation from her previous employment in 1993. She explained that she
oversaw the company’s operations together with the Husband and joined him on
overseas trips. She claimed that she provided the “essential backup” in
Singapore that the Husband could rely upon, such that he was able to travel
overseas for long periods.[note: 118] The Husband disputed this. He claimed
that the Wife’s role was “nominal”. He said that she merely signed documents
for the company as a director. He claimed that she hardly went to the
company’s office and did not go for sales trips. She did not also travel for
business.[note: 119]

61 I find the Wife’s claims of having contributed extensively to Chong Park
Singapore to be inconsistent with her claim that she was a full time caregiver
to her children upon her resignation from her previous employment in 1993. I
find that it is more likely that she was a full time mother from 1993 and that
she played, at most, a minor role in Chong Park Singapore.

Step 4: Deciding on a just and equitable apportionment of the matrimonial
assets and making orders to achieve this most conveniently

Preliminary issue: Should an adverse inference be drawn against either party?

(1) The law on drawing adverse inferences

62 The parties have a duty of full and frank disclosure (see _NK_ at [57]). If
a party fails to comply with this duty, an adverse inference may be drawn.
There are at least two possible consequences to the drawing of an adverse
inference. First, the court may divide the matrimonial assets on the basis of
the assets that were disclosed (see _NK_ at [58]). This approach entails
ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed assets to the other party (see
_NK_ at [62]). Alternatively, the court may determine the value of the
undeclared assets (see _NK_ at [59]). In pursuing this second approach, the
court must be careful not to be unnecessarily speculative in determining the
values of the undeclared assets (see _NK_ at [61]). As will be seen, I have
adopted the first approach because there is no basis for me to determine the
true amount of the undeclared assets with any accuracy.

(2) Analysis

63 Both the Wife and the Husband have alleged that the other has failed in his
or her obligation to give full and frank disclosure.

(A) Alleged non-disclosures by the Husband

(I) Failure to disclose the existence of interests in two companies until
second affidavit of assets and means

64 The Wife first referred to the fact that the Husband did not disclose the
existence of his interests in Chong Park Pharmaceutical and IDR Superior until
his second affidavit of assets and means, which was filed on 21 September 2010
(see [23]–[24] above), even though he had earlier disclosed in an answer to
interrogatories filed on 19 November 2009 that “he had no other business
entities in Singapore or elsewhere”.[note: 120] It should be noted that the
existence of his interests in the two companies was first raised by the Wife
in her second affidavit of assets and means dated 22 February 2010.[note: 121]

65 The Husband’s explanation for this was that his first affidavit of assets
and means and his answers to interrogatories were filed by his previous
solicitors and were incomplete.[note: 122] He corrected this omission by
making full disclosure in his subsequent affidavit.

66 I do not accept the Husband’s explanation. The very first page of his first
affidavit of assets and means stated that he “made full and frank disclosure
of [his] assets and means” and that he has “no other assets and means aside
from what has been disclosed in [the] [a]ffidavit”.[note: 123] It should have
been clear to the Husband that he had a duty to disclose all his assets. He
cannot hide behind the convenient fact that he had a change of solicitors.

(II) Income from companies in Singapore and MAlaysia

67 The Wife referred to Chong Park Singapore’s balance sheet for the financial
year which ended on 31 July 2009.[note: 124] This balance sheet indicated that
an amount of S$727,944 was due to Chong Park Singapore’s directors in 2008.
For the year 2009, this amount was reduced by S$111,043 to S$616,901. The cash
flow statement in the balance sheet indicated that this amount was paid to
directors.[note: 125] The Wife pointed out that Chong Park Singapore has only
two directors, _viz_ , the Husband and herself. As she did not receive any
payment, she submitted that the payment must have been made to the
Husband.[note: 126] The Husband has not disclosed that he received such a
payment.[note: 127]

68 The Husband’s explanation for the amount reflected in the balance sheet as
being due to the directors is that those monies were loans given by his
mother, aunt and uncle to Chong Park Singapore. He claims that the benefit of
those loans was transferred to him when they transferred their shares to him
in 1989.[note: 128]

69 The Husband’s explanation does not satisfactorily explain the reason for
the reduction in the amount due to the directors. Even if the amount reflected
as being due to the directors was a loan from the Husband’s relatives, he has
not explained the reason for the _reduction_ in that amount in 2009 with an
accompanying outward cash flow. He has not also contradicted the Wife’s
assertion that she did not receive the amount of S$111,043. The only remaining
possibility is that the Husband received that amount. His failure to disclose
this fact was a breach of his duty of full and frank disclosure.

70 The Wife next referred to inconsistencies in the Husband’s affidavits on
the source of his declared income from Malaysia.[note: 129] For example, the
Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means stated that he drew a RM96,000
annual income from Jun Marketing.[note: 130] However, he later claimed that
this income was from Chong Park Pharmaceuticals in 2007 and from IDR Superior
in 2008.[note: 131] She also referred to the financial statements of the
Malaysian companies of which the Husband was a director. These financial
statements indicated that directors’ fees, remuneration and bonuses of various
amounts were paid. The amounts that were paid out exceeded the Husband’s
disclosed Malaysia-sourced income (_ie_ , RM96,000 per annum).[note: 132] The
Wife submitted that it was “logical to believe” that the Husband received most
if not all of the money that these companies paid to its directors.[note: 133]

71 The Husband explained that the inconsistencies in relation to the source of
his income were mistakes.[note: 134] As for the directors’ fees paid by the
other Malaysian companies, he explained that his _fellow directors_ received
those amounts.[note: 135] He asserted that his annual income from Malaysia
was, as declared, _viz_ , RM96,000.[note: 136] As documentary evidence, he
produced his Malaysian tax return.[note: 137] He also produced the income tax
notices of his fellow directors disclosing that they received the relevant
directors’ fees, remuneration and bonuses.[note: 138] At the hearing before
me, his counsel also offered to arrange for these directors to file affidavits
to confirm that they received those amounts.[note: 139]

72 I accept the Husband’s explanations for the inconsistencies in the source
of his income. I also accept that his Malaysia-sourced income was only
RM96,000. His assertion that he only received that amount was not
unsubstantiated. He was able to produce documentary evidence which, on its
face, supported his assertion.

(III) Loan from Alldo Resources to Rhino Distributors

73 The Wife also referred to the unaudited balance sheets of Rhino
Distributors for the years which ended on 31 December 2007 and 31 December
2008. The balance sheets disclosed a loan from Alldo Resources in the amount
of RM1,139,229.32.[note: 140] The Wife submitted that Yong Jun, who was a
director and 50% owner of Alldo Resources, was a cover for the Husband.[note:
141] She asserted that the Husband was running Alldo Resources even though he
claimed to have no interest in the company.[note: 142]

74 The Husband referred to an affidavit by Yong Jun in which Yong Jun deposed
that he is a director and shareholder of Alldo Resources and that the Husband
had helped him to run the business while he was studying in Australia.[note:
143] As for the loan from Alldo Resources to Rhino Distributors, the Husband
pointed out that the _audited_ accounts of Rhino Distributors do not reveal
that such a loan was made.[note: 144]

75 I accept that the Husband’s role in Alldo Resources was to assist Yong Jun
in running the business. There is no reason to disbelieve Yong Jun’s evidence
that he was a shareholder and director of Alldo Resources and that his
father’s role in the company was to simply assist him in running it in his
absence. In view of this finding, the issue of whether a loan was made to
Rhino Distributors is immaterial.

(IV) Expenses beyond disclosed income

76 The Wife submitted that the Husband’s disclosed monthly expenses totalled
S$20,875, excluding his own personal and other expenses.[note: 145] The
Husband’s counsel disputed this estimation. He said it included Yong Jun’s
expenses for his overseas education even though Yong Jun had completed his
education.[note: 146] However, even so, the Husband’s expenses exceeded his
declared monthly income of S$6,163.50 and RM8,000.[note: 147] At the exchange
rate of RM2.47 per unit of SGD (see [20] above), his net monthly income is
S$9,402.37. His expenses far exceed his income.

77 The Husband’s explanation for how he is able to cope with the shortfall is
as follows:[note: 148]

(a) He charged some of his expenses, such as for his cars and his meals, to
his companies.

(b) The expenses for his car (the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle) were paid for by
Chong Park Singapore.

(c) Fan assisted him financially by making contributions to his personal
expenses.

78 I do not accept the Husband’s explanation for how he is able to maintain
his expenses with his current income. Even if the first two explanations are
taken into account, the shortfall is still substantial. His claim that Fan
assists him financially is a bare assertion. The Husband must have some other
undisclosed assets or sources of income to support his expenses.

(V) Other assets

79 The Wife claimed that the Husband tried to hide his purchase of the
Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle.[note: 149]

80 I accept the Husband’s explanation that the non-disclosure of the purchase
was not intentional. The Husband’s explanation is that the non-disclosure of
the new vehicle was an error because it had the same license number as his
previous vehicle (_ie_ , the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle). He further explained
that he had no intention to hide the purchase because he exhibited a document
on the Preferential Additional Registration Fee / Certificate of Entitlement
rebate for the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle in his second affidavit of assets
and means. If his non-disclosure was intentional, he would not have disclosed
that document.[note: 150]

81 Finally, the Wife referred to the Husband’s failure to disclose the
existence of his four Standard Chartered Bank accounts (see [34] above). The
Wife first raised the existence of three of these accounts in her second
affidavit of assets and means dated 23 February 2010.[note: 151] The Husband
then disclosed the four accounts in his second affidavit of assets and means
dated 21 September 2010.[note: 152] The Husband’s explanation for his non-
disclosure was that the accounts were closed and the balances were used to
finance the operations of Rhino Distributors. His explanation was not
satisfactory because the accounts were only closed in the course of
2009.[note: 153] There is no reason why the accounts should not have been
disclosed in his first affidavit of assets and means.

(B) Alleged non-disclosures by the Wife

82 The Husband argued that an adverse inference should be drawn against the
Wife for her alleged non-disclosure of income. These arguments were made in
the context of the Wife’s claims for maintenance. However, they are also
relevant to the issue of division of matrimonial assets. Hence, I will
consider his arguments here.

83 The Husband first argued that the Wife claimed to have given tuition for
about 10 hours a week, which earned her S$540 per month. The Husband argued
that the figures did not tally because, according to him, the market rate for
tuition is at least S$40–S$50 per hour. Hence, the Wife should be earning a
total of S$1,600–S$2,000 a month.[note: 154] He also argued that the Wife’s
disclosures of her recent jobs, and her income from those jobs, were not
supported by any documentary evidence. I accept the Wife’s explanation that
her income from tuition was not as much as the Husband asserted because of her
relatively lower level of education (she has an “Ordinary” Level General
Certificate of Education).[note: 155] I do not consider her failure to produce
documentary evidence to substantiate her other sources of income to be of any
significance. The Wife actually disclosed that she received income from those
sources.

84 Next, the Husband argued that the Wife failed to disclose her dividend
income from her shares.[note: 156] The Wife’s explanation was that she was not
able to obtain records of the dividends that she received in the years 2008
and 2009 and that she was only able to deduce the amount of dividends that she
earned in the year 2010.[note: 157] I find that the Wife did not deliberately
fail to disclose her dividend income. Her very first affidavit of assets and
means exhibited her notice of assessment of taxable income (dated 5 August
2008).[note: 158] This assessment noted her dividend income.

85 Finally, the Husband submits that the Wife failed to disclose the existence
of her investments in unit trusts and her shares in Malaysian companies until
her third affidavit of assets and means.[note: 159] This is not strictly
accurate because her first affidavit of assets and means exhibited her CPF
Investment Scheme Special Account Investment Portfolio.[note: 160] This
portfolio statement disclosed three of her investments in unit trusts. Hence,
the Wife could only be said to have breached her duty of full and frank
disclosure _vis-à-vis_ one of her investments and her investment in Malaysian
shares (which she claims was inadvertent – see [48] above).

The just and equitable apportionment

86 The Husband submitted that the Matrimonial Home should be sold, with the
proceeds to be apportioned in the ratio of 60:40 in his favour. He further
proposed that each party retain the assets held in his or her name.[note: 161]

87 The Wife submitted that the Husband’s share of the Matrimonial Home should
be transferred to her because she has been living there since its purchase and
she wants to retain her present lifestyle. She proposed that the Husband
transfer his share without any refund to his CPF account. She also proposed
that the Husband should repay the outstanding mortgage loan.[note: 162] As for
the other assets, she made the following proposals:[note: 163]

(a) She will not “make a claim” on the Husband’s share of the Baywater
Property.[note: 164]

(b) Chong Park Singapore should be valued and the Husband should buy over her
share in Chong Park Singapore at 50% of the determined value.

(c) The Husband’s Malaysian companies should be valued and the Wife should be
entitled to 50% of the Husband’s shares in the companies.

(d) The Husband is to repay the outstanding loan taken on the Great Eastern
Life Policy (see [21] above). The Wife submitted that the Great Eastern Life
Policy should be maintained because insurers are unwilling to provide her with
coverage because of her medical condition (she suffers from Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus, scoliosis and myofascial syndrome[note: 165]).

(e) The Wife should be given 50% of the Husband’s money in his bank accounts
(including the amount in the Public Growth Fund).

(f) The Wife also proposed that she be given 50% of the HSBC Structured
Investment. However, this proposal is no longer tenable in view of my
conclusion that this investment was not a matrimonial asset (see [35] above).

(g) The Wife will not “make a claim” on the Husband’s CPF savings and shares
in listed companies.

(h) The Husband should transfer his SRC membership to the Wife.

(i) The Husband should transfer ownership of the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle to the
Wife. He should repay the outstanding loan on the vehicle.

(j) The Wife should be allowed to keep her shares in listed companies because
she claims to have started her investments before her marriage. She further
claims that some of the shares belonged to her father.

(k) The Wife should retain her CPF monies, investments in unit trusts, shares
in Malaysian companies and her savings in her bank account with Yong Jun.

88 The Wife’s approach will entail more costs and administrative burden for
both parties because several assets will have to be transferred. As I noted
above, I consider it to be in the interests of fairness and justice that I
take a global approach to dividing the matrimonial assets in the light of the
direct and indirect contributions, as well as other relevant factors (see [5]
above).

89 In addition to the factors that I have already considered above (_viz_ ,
the direct and indirect contributions and the non-disclosures), I should also
consider the following in deciding on the proportion of the division:

(a) There is no indication that the Wife paid any rent for her exclusive
occupation of the Matrimonial Home since the Husband moved out in 1996. This
is a relevant consideration under the Charter (see s 112(2)(f) of the
Charter);

(b) The parties had a fairly long marriage (they were married for 31 years),
however, they were also separated for an extended period of 14 years.

90 Taking into account the direct and indirect contributions of the parties,
the non-disclosures by the parties (with the Husband’s non-disclosures being
more substantial), the fact that the Wife enjoyed a substantial period of
rent-free occupation and the fact that the parties were separated for a
substantial proportion of their long marriage, I order that the matrimonial
assets should be divided equally. On this division, each party is entitled to
S$1,290,245.22.

91 The Wife requested in her skeletal arguments for the Husband to repay a
S$36,000 loan that she alleges he took out against the Great Eastern Life
Policy (see [21] above). The fact that this loan was taken out before was not
previously disclosed. It was suggested above at [21] that there is no evidence
of the existence of the loan. I therefore disregard this allegation.

Consequential orders

92 I make these orders with a view to minimising the reshuffling of assets and
ensuring a clean break in the parties’ relationship:

(a) The Wife is to transfer her shares in Chong Park Singapore to the Husband
for a nominal consideration of S$1. With this order, the assets in the Wife’s
name will be reduced to S$434,540.83. A sum of S$855,704.39 would have to be
paid to her to equalise the division of matrimonial assets. I will round this
down to S$855,000.

(b) The Matrimonial Home is to be sold on the open market within a period of
six months from the date of this judgment, with liberty to apply for further
extensions if necessary. A sum of S$855,000 from the sale proceeds is to be
paid to the Wife. This amount _includes_ the CPF monies which she spent in the
purchase of the Matrimonial Home.

(c) The remainder of the sale proceeds is to be paid to the Husband.

(d) The Joint Account is to be closed. The remaining balance is to be paid to
the Husband.

Maintenance of the defendant

93 Section 114(1) of the Charter requires the court to consider all the
circumstances of the case in determining the amount of maintenance:

**114**.—(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man
to his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard to all the
circumstances of the case including the following matters:

(_a_) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources
which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the
foreseeable future;

(_b_) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the
parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

(_c_) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the
marriage;

(_d_) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

(_e_) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the
marriage;

(_f_) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the
welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the
home or caring for the family; and

(_g_) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value
to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a
pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that
party will lose the chance of acquiring.

94 The objective of an order for maintenance is set out in s 114(2) of the
Charter:

(2) In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so
to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their
conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have
been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his
or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.

95 As the Court of Appeal recently recognised, the objective in s 114(2) of
the Charter must be read in the light of the need to adopt a “commonsense
holistic approach” (see _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam_ _Heng Chow_ [2012] SGCA 15 (“
_Foo Ah Yan_ ”) at [15]–[16]):

15 Yet, whilst England and Wales have abandoned their equivalent of the s
114(2) directive after amendments  _vide_ the 1984 UK Act (see, in particular,
s 3), with the result that s 25 of the UK Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 now only
directs the court to consider a non-exhaustive list of relevant factors, our
legislature has not followed suit (see Leong Wai Kum, _Elements of Family Law
in Singapore_ (Singapore: LexisNexis, 2007) (“ _Elements of Family Law in
Singapore_ ”) at p 796 and  _Halsbury’s_ at para 130.853). Our courts have,
however, applied s 114(2)  _purposively_ to achieve a commonsense response to
the requirements of justice in each case – a point which has been acknowledged
by the work just mentioned (see  _Halsbury’s_ at para 130.853). As this court
noted in  _BG v BF_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 (“ _BG v BF_ ”) at [74]–[75]:

The High Court in _Wong Amy v Chua Seng Chuan_ [1992] 2 SLR(R) 143 made some
crucial observations in relation to these powers: (a) adequate provision must
be made to ensure the support and accommodation of the children of the
marriage; (b) provision must be made to meet the needs of each spouse; and (c)
_at the end of the day, it is the court's sense of justice which demands and
obtains a just solution to many a difficult issue_ : see also  _Quek Lee Tiam
v Ho Kim Swee_  _[1995] SGHC 23_. These principles were recently endorsed by V
K Rajah J (as he then was) in  _NI v NJ_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75.

… In  _Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang_  _Bok Dennis_  _[2004] 3 SLR(R) 376_ ,
this court held that the rationale behind the law imposing a duty on a former
husband to maintain his former wife is  _to even out any financial
inequalities between the spouses, taking into account any economic prejudice
suffered by the wife during marriage_.

[emphasis added]

16 The  _purposive_ approach to the s 114(2) directive recognises that there
could be an infinite number of reasons why the applicant should not get all
she asks for, and requires s 114(2) to be applied in  _a commonsense holistic
manner_ that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown
of a marriage: see the Singapore High Court decision of  _NI v NJ_ [2007] 1
SLR(R) 75 (“ _NI v NJ_ ”) at [15]–[16]. Indeed, Lord Gardiner LC referred to
instances of the possible pitfalls which might occur (and which the
commonsense holistic approach adopted by the Singapore courts  _avoids_)
during the debate in the House of Lords on clause 5 of the UK Matrimonial
Proceedings and Property Bill (which was later enacted as s 5 of the 1970 UK
Act that was, in turn, and as noted above at [12], the provision upon which s
114 of the Act was modelled), as follows (see  _Parliamentary Debates
(Hansard) - House of Lords_ (4 December 1969) vol 306 at cols 267268):

In its present form, Clause 5(1) requires the court, first, to consider the
relevant factors set out in paragraphs (a) to (f) and then so far as it is
practicable and, having regard to the conduct of the parties, “just to do so”,
to put the party in whose favour the order is to be made in the position he or
she would or should have been had the marriage not broken down.  _This formula
could lead to the conclusion that, where no question of penalising misconduct
arises, and where there is enough money to do so, the court must put the payee
in his “pre-breakdown” position, regardless of the effect on the payer. This
could produce a most unfortunate result. If one takes a case where there is a
decree granted to a wife petitioner on the grounds of five years’ separation
and no question arises of misconduct by either husband or wife, the wife may
be receiving an appreciable income of her own—for example from practice as a
doctor or from the profits of a business—which is much greater than that of
her husband. From the way the parties behaved before the breakdown, it may be
clear that, but for the breakdown, the wife would have continued to be the
financial mainstay of the family. It would hardly be right for the husband to
claim that, on divorce, he was entitled to be put back in his financial status
quo, even if this meant the wife's paying him more than half her income._

_It is notoriously true that two separate homes are much more expensive to run
than one. It will, therefore, in almost every case be impracticable so to
reallocate the resources of the parties as to put one spouse in his or her
pre-breakdown financial position without drastically reducing the standard of
living of the other. In some cases, for example where that other's conduct is
the more blameworthy, this may be a fair result. But where there is no
question of one being more to blame than the other, it will not be fair. The
principle underlying the Amendment is that the court should aim at getting as
near as possible to putting both parties in their pre-breakdown financial
position, so that, where some reduction in the standard of living is
inevitable (as it usually will be), that reduction is shared and not borne
entirely by one party—save where his own bad conduct makes it just that he
should be the one to suffer the greater financial loss._

[emphasis added]

Consequently (and in accordance with this commonsense holistic approach), our
courts have held,  _inter alia_ , that a former wife must, where possible,
exert reasonable efforts to secure gainful employment and contribute to
preserve her pre-breakdown lifestyle: see, for example,  _Quek Lee Tiam_ at
[22] and  _NI v NJ_ at [14]–[16].

[emphasis in original]

96 The Husband submitted that the Wife has a large share portfolio from which
she earns “sizeable dividends”. He also submitted that she has not disclosed
the sources of her income and that she can earn as much as S$4,800 to S$6,000
per month, if not more. Given these circumstances, he submitted that no order
of maintenance should be made.[note: 166] It should be noted that the
Husband’s allegations in relation to the Wife’s sources of income and the
amount that she earned from tuition have been dealt with above (see [83]). I
accepted the Wife’s explanations.

97 The Wife estimated her monthly expenses at S$3,260. She submitted that in
order to sustain her present lifestyle, she would need monthly maintenance in
the sum of S$5,000. This represents an increase of S$1,500 from the S$3,500
that she used to receive from the Husband after she resigned from her
employment in 1993. She justified the increased amount on the basis of an
increase in living and medical costs and her need to employ a full-time maid
in the light of her medical condition.[note: 167] She also wanted her
maintenance payments to be backdated to the date of filing of the writ for
divorce. She submitted that she should receive lump sum maintenance of
S$720,000 on the basis of a 12-year multiplier.[note: 168]

98 In my view, maintenance in the amount of S$720,000 was extravagant in the
light of the assets and means of the parties. As I have noted above, the
Husband has not fully disclosed his assets and income. However, his non-
disclosures were taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets,
with the effect that the Wife was awarded a higher proportion of the
matrimonial assets than I would have awarded if full disclosure was made. I
should also take into account the fact that the Wife has a considerable
portfolio of shares from which she earned a dividend income of S$6,056 in the
year 2008.[note: 169] She is also presently working as a part-time teaching
assistant, from which she derived an income of between S$200 and S$500 per
month.[note: 170]

99 In my view, a sum that is more reasonable in view of the Husband’s means is
S$2,000 per month. This is not too far from the S$1,600 per month maintenance
payment that the Husband proposed in his first affidavit of assets and
means.[note: 171] Neither is it far from the amount that the Wife sought in
her first affidavit of assets and means (she sought an amount of
S$3,000).[note: 172] I would prefer to order lump sum maintenance. There is no
fixed rule on the multiplier to be used for this purpose (see _Foo Ah Yan_ at
[18]). The Husband was 55 years of age at the time of the filing of his first
affidavit of assets and means on 8 June 2009. This means that he is presently
57 or 58 years old. The Wife is 54 or 55 years old at present. In the
circumstances, a multiplier of 12 years would be excessive. I will use a
multiplier of eight years. On this multiplier, the lump sum maintenance award
is S$192,000. This sum is to be paid within a month of the completion of the
sale of the Matrimonial Home.

100 The Wife also sought the recovery of arrears of maintenance in the amount
of S$49,378.48 from 2005 to 2008.[note: 173] She claims that, since 2005, when
the Husband purchased the Baywater Property, he ceased reimbursing her for
monthly expenses. She claimed that the Husband only paid her S$1,000
sporadically.[note: 174] The Husband disputed the Wife’s claims for arrears.
He asserted that there is no basis for such a claim. He also pointed out that
the court had made an order for him to pay monthly maintenance of S$1,000 from
November 2008. No order was made for the payment of arrears.[note: 175] I
agree. The Wife has not explained the basis for her to claim those amounts,
which allegedly accrued _prior_ to the institution of the divorce proceedings,
in these ancillary proceedings.

Maintenance of Yong Li

101 Yong Li is presently above the age of 21 years. She is undergoing her
university education. She is entitled to maintenance under s 69(5)(c) of the
Charter. The Husband is presently paying for her expenses and her school
fees.[note: 176] Yong Li confirmed in an affidavit that the Husband is indeed
paying for her educational and other additional expenses.[note: 177]

102 In the circumstances, I will make no order for the Husband to pay the Wife
maintenance for Yong Li. Yong Li may, of course, apply for maintenance herself
should the Husband cease to pay her maintenance (see s 69(3)(b) of the
Charter).

Conclusion

103 Considering all the facts and circumstances of this case, I make no order
as to costs subject to the following. If either party feels there are special
circumstances that entitles one party to an order for costs against the other
party, that party is at liberty to apply, for oral argument therefor within 10
days from the date hereof, failing which my order on costs will stand. The
parties shall have liberty to apply.
