18 April 2022 Judgment reserved.

Dedar Singh Gill J:

1 The accused, Mr Wan Azasar bin Wan Yusoff, claimed trial to three charges
under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “MDA”):

(a) One charge of importing not less than 27.34g of diamorphine into
Singapore, an offence under s 7 of the MDA and punishable under s 33(1) of the
MDA (the “First Charge”).

(b) One charge of importing not less than 340.43g of methamphetamine into
Singapore, an offence under s 7 of the MDA and punishable under s 33(1) of the
MDA (the “Second Charge”).

(c) One charge of importing not less than 656.53g of vegetable matter which
was analysed and found to be cannabis into Singapore, an offence under s 7 of
the MDA and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (the “Third Charge”).

Under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the
punishment prescribed for unauthorised importation in these quantities is
death. Pursuant to s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, the court has a discretion not to
impose the death penalty if the requirements set out in s 33B(2) of the MDA
are satisfied.

2 It is undisputed that the diamorphine (which I refer to as “heroin”) forming
the subject matter of the First Charge, the methamphetamine forming the
subject matter of the Second Charge and the cannabis forming the subject
matter of the Third Charge were recovered from the accused’s car bearing
registration number JRJ 6150 (the “Car”) at the Woodlands Checkpoint located
at 21 Woodlands Crossing, Singapore (the “Woodlands Checkpoint”). 1

4 The accused’s defence is that out of the 27.34g of heroin, he had only
knowingly imported the 3.75g of heroin in Exhibits “B1A”, “B1B” and “B1C”. He
denies knowledge of the nature of the remaining 23.59g of heroin, the entire
340.43g of methamphetamine and the entire 656.53g of cannabis (“the Ignorance
Defence”). 2

Agreed facts

5 During a random check, officers from the Immigration and Checkpoints
Authority (“ICA”) inspected and searched the Car at the Woodlands Checkpoint.
ICA officers arrested the accused on 29 October 2018 at or about 1.50pm as
exhibits suspected to be drugs were found in the Car. 3

##### Foot Note 3

×

SOAF at paras 2–3.

Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers were notified and arrived at the
scene.

6 After arresting the accused, officers searched the Car twice. The first
search was conducted at about 1.55pm on the same day by Sergeant (2) Ng Jian
Zuan (“Sgt Ng”) and Sergeant (2) Saranraj s/o Ramachandran (“Sgt Saranraj”).
The Exhibits discovered in the armrests at the rear seats of the Car were
recovered by Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Khairul Bin Khairudin (“SSSgt
Khairul”) and Staff Sergeant Muhammad Saifuddin Rowther Bin Mohidin Pitchai
(“SSgt Saifuddin”).

7 The second search was conducted at about 1.15am on 30 October 2018 by
Sergeant (2) Muhammad Syamil Bin Bueari (“Sgt Syamil”), Senior Staff Sergeant
Ritar d/o Diayalah (“SSSgt Ritar”) and Sergeant (2) Tao Junwei, Amos (“Sgt
Amos”).

8 In all, the officers retrieved the Exhibits from six locations in the Car,
later marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E” and “F”, which corresponded to the first
letter in the final marking of the Exhibits and indicated that the Exhibit was
retrieved from the said location (see summary at [3]).

9 The following table summarises the results of the analysis of these
Exhibits, which are not in dispute.

11 It is undisputed that the Statements set out in the preceding paragraph,
except for the Third Long Statement (at [10(h)]), were voluntarily provided by
the accused. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

SOAF at para 69.

The accused challenged the Third Long Statement on the basis that two threats
were uttered to the accused during the statement recording. The accused also
challenged the accuracy in the recording of paragraphs 50, 52, 54, 57, 59 and
61 in the Third Long Statement. Therefore, I held an ancillary hearing to
determine if the Third Long Statement was admissible (see [41]–[60] below).

12 At the main trial, the accused challenges the accuracy in the recording of:

(a) the First Contemporaneous Statement at Q1/A1 to Q3/A3; 14

The parties’ cases

The Prosecution’s case

14 The Prosecution advances two alternative cases.

15 The Prosecution’s primary case is that the evidence proves, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the accused possessed the drugs in the Exhibits for the
purpose of intentionally importing the Exhibits into Singapore without prior
authorisation. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

PCS at para 28.

In summary, the Prosecution says that the accused knew at all material times
that the Exhibits in his possession contained heroin, methamphetamine and
cannabis. The Prosecution relies on the following admissions:

(a) The accused’s response to SSSgt Khairul’s question on the identity of the
Exhibits from locations later marked “A” and “B” that they were “panas”
(heroin) and “sejuk” (methamphetamine) in Room B-318 on 29 October 2018 at
about 2.35pm. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

PCS at para 28(a); PS26 at para 7: ABOD at p 160.

(b) In the accused’s First Contemporaneous Statement, he said that the
Exhibits retrieved from locations later marked “A” and “B” were “panas”
(heroin) and “sejuk” (methamphetamine), which he understood to be drugs. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

PCS at para 28(b); P55 at Q1/A1–Q2/A2: ABOD at p 162.

(c) In the accused’s Second Contemporaneous Statement, he said that Exhibits
“C1” (retrieved from location later marked “C”) and “D1” (retrieved from
location later marked “D”) were “panas” (heroin) and Exhibits “E1”, “E2”,
“E3”, “E4” and “E5” (retrieved from location later marked “E”) and “F1”, “F2”,
“F3”, “F4” and “F5” (retrieved from location later marked “F”) were “ganja”
(cannabis). 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

PCS at para 28(c); P60 at Q13/A13–Q17/A17: ABOD at p 175.

(d) In the accused’s Third Long Statement, he admitted that he had placed the
Exhibits in the Car. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

PCS at para 28(d); P69: PBOD at pp 32–35.

(e) The accused confessed to Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”) on 21 November
2018, 27 November 2018 and 4 December 2018 that he had knowingly brought
“ice”, “heroin” and “ganja” into Singapore. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

PCS at para 28(e); P63T at p 8 / P63 at p 9: PBOD at p 20.

16 The Prosecution’s alternative case is that the Exhibits were in the
possession of the accused pursuant to the presumption under s 21 of the MDA.
26

##### Foot Note 26

×

PCS at para 29.

This provision states that:

Presumption relating to vehicle

21. If any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of the vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time being. 

17 Further to [16], the accused knew that the Exhibits contained heroin,
methamphetamine and cannabis by virtue of the presumption under s 18(2) of the
MDA. This provision states that:

Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs

…

(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his
possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the
nature of that drug.

18 The Prosecution has to defeat the accused’s Ignorance Defence on either of
its cases. In this regard, the Prosecution submits that the Ignorance Defence
is not credible for the following reasons. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

PCS at para 59.

19 First, full weight should be given to the accused’s confessions in his
statements at [15] and the admissions to Dr Goh corroborate this. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

Prosecution’s Reply Submissions (“PRS”) at paras 46–47 and 51.

According to the Prosecution, his attempts to challenge the accuracy of the
statements should not be believed because:

(a) While the accused alleges that IO Neo and Mr Farhan were unreliable
witnesses and fabricated aspects of the Third Long Statement, the evidence
does not bear out any apparent or real inconsistency nor provide
substantiation for the claim of manipulation. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

PRS at paras 57–61.

Rather, the falsity of the accused’s contention as to the voluntariness of the
Third Long Statement is made apparent by his “cherry-picking” of certain
exculpatory parts of the statement as being voluntary. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

PCS at paras 52–53.

(b) The accused alleges that the First Contemporaneous Statement, the First,
Second and Third Long Statements, and the First Cautioned Statement were
inaccurately recorded. However, the evidence shows that the statements were
read back to the accused and there is no basis for the accused’s allegation
that the contents – including amendments – of the statements were fabricated.
31

##### Foot Note 31

×

PRS at paras 62–84.

(c) The accused’s claims that portions of Dr Goh’s clinical notes were
recorded inaccurately and that the interpreter, Mr Shaffiq Bin Selamat (“Mr
Shaffiq”), was affiliated to CNB, are misconceived. 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

PRS at paras 48–51.

(d) The Ignorance Defence is an afterthought. The confessions in the accused’s
statements should be preferred over his testimony at trial as they set out a
contemporaneous and consistent account of the offences. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

PCS at para 59.

In contrast, the accused was unable to satisfactorily explain his departure
from the admissions in the statements provided (see list at [15]). 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

PCS at para 59.

20 Second, the allegations against the statement recorders and interpreter of
the First Contemporaneous Statement, the First, Second and Third Long
Statements and the First Cautioned Statement are fanciful and self-serving. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

PCS at para 59.

In this regard, the Prosecution emphasises that the evidence from the
statement recorders and the interpreter is coherent and logical, and there was
no impropriety in the statement recording process. 36

##### Foot Note 36

×

PRS at paras 56–64.

Thus, the accused’s confessions as to his knowledge of the nature of the
Exhibits should be accorded full weight.

21 Third, the accused’s claim that he had kept silent when SSSgt Khairul posed
the question on the Exhibits retrieved from locations later marked “A” and “B”
(see [15(a)]) was an afterthought. 37

##### Foot Note 37

×

PCS at para 38.

In making this submission, the Prosecution underscores the accused’s failure
to put the allegation to SSSgt Khairul, the absence of any reason for SSSgt
Khairul to lie in his evidence and SSgt Saifuddin’s corroboration of SSSgt
Khairul’s contemporaneous narration of the accused’s response that the
Exhibits from locations later marked “A” and “B” were “panas” (heroin) and
“sejuk” (methamphetamine).

22 In respect of the Prosecution’s alternative case set out at [16]–[17], the
accused argues that the presumptions in ss 21 and 18(2) of the MDA have not
been invoked or that the said presumptions have been rebutted by him. 38

##### Foot Note 38

×

PRS at para 2; DCS at para 559.

In this connection, the accused submits that there may have been a break in
the chain of custody of the Exhibits, 39

##### Foot Note 39

×

DCS at paras 10 and 281.

in which case the presumptions in ss 21 and 18(2) of the MDA are not
successfully raised.

23 In reply, the Prosecution makes the following submissions:

(a) First, no reasonable doubt has arisen in this regard as it is undisputed
that the Exhibits were recovered from various locations in the Car, 40

##### Foot Note 40

×

PRS at para 6.

and the chain of custody between the initial seizure of the Exhibits and their
eventual analysis by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) is unbroken on the
totality of the evidence. 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

PRS at paras 8–44.

(b) Second, in relation to the accused’s submission that the ss 21 and 18(2)
presumptions have been rebutted by virtue of the Ignorance Defence, the
arguments set out above at [19]–[21] refute the accused’s claim of his lack of
knowledge of the nature of the Exhibits retrieved from locations other than
the location later marked “B”. 42

##### Foot Note 42

×

PRS at paras 45–64.

24 For all the above reasons, the Prosecution urges the court to convict the
accused.

The Defence’s case

25 To recapitulate, the accused’s defence is that he did not have actual
knowledge of the nature and existence of the drugs 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

DCS at para 5.

and the Prosecution failed to prove his possession of the Exhibits beyond
reasonable doubt. 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

DCS at paras 6–7.

He claims that he only knew that the Exhibits “B1A”, “B1B” and “B1C” contained
heroin. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

DCS at para 8(a).

He denies knowledge of the nature of the remaining 23.59g of heroin in the
First Charge, the entire 340.43g of methamphetamine in the Second Charge and
the entire 656.53g of cannabis in the Third Charge. Further, even though the
accused knew that the Exhibits “B1A”, “B1B” and “B1C” contained heroin, he
only knew this because a person known as “Din” told him so. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

DCS at para 8(c).

The accused makes the following points in support of the Ignorance Defence.

26 First, no weight should be given to the Third Long Statement. 47

##### Foot Note 47

×

DCS at paras 11(c) and 12.

Notwithstanding the admissibility of the statement, the contents of the Third
Long Statement should be disregarded for two main reasons:

(a) The credibility of the statement recorder, IO Neo, should be doubted
because he had been “evasive” in his evidence on the reason for the recording
of the Third Long Statement and the prior assistance rendered by Mr Farhan to
him on other occasions. 48

##### Foot Note 48

×

DCS at paras 366–368.

Similarly, the credibility of the interpreter, Mr Farhan, is called into
question because he was not forthcoming in his responses 49

##### Foot Note 49

×

DCS at paras 406, 412 and 417.

and his answers were inconsistent. 50

##### Foot Note 50

×

DCS at paras 407 and 427.

(b) Certain portions of the Third Long Statement were answers “prompted” or
“fabricated” by IO Neo. 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

DCS at paras 385, 387, 394–396 and 399.

27 Second, no weight should be accorded to the incriminating aspects of Dr
Goh’s notes in the Psychiatric Clerking Case Sheet (marked as “P63”). 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

DCS at para 11(a)–(b).

Specifically, the Defence emphasises that the clerical error made by Dr Goh in
recording the words “for charging heroin, ganja and ice into Singapore”
supports the inference that the accused had told Dr Goh that he was being
charged for bringing in heroin, “ganja” and “ice”. This is opposed to Dr Goh’s
testimony that he had erroneously recorded “charging” when he intended to
record “bringing”, ie, “for bringing heroin, ganja and ice into Singapore”. 53

##### Foot Note 53

×

DCS at paras 91–93.

Further, Dr Goh’s omission to record whether he had explained to the accused
the limits of confidentiality and his primary duty to the court on some
occasions, and his inability to confirm whether he had done so, places the
accuracy of his notes into question. 54

##### Foot Note 54

×

The Defence posits that a portion of Dr Goh’s record instead corroborates the
accused’s evidence that he had kept the packets from “Din” which were found at
location later marked “B”. 55

28 In support of its submission that no weight should be placed on the
incriminating portions of Dr Goh’s clinical notes P63, the Defence submits
that the interpreter for the accused in the interviews conducted by Dr Goh, Mr
Shaffiq, was in fact affiliated with CNB, and therefore urges the court not to
take into account the accused’s admissions in Dr Goh’s clinical notes P63. 56

##### Foot Note 56

DCS at paras 105–106.

29 Third, the Defence appears to suggest that limited weight should be
accorded to the First and Second Contemporaneous Statements, the First
Cautioned Statement, and the First and Second Long Statements. The following
summarises, inter alia, the arguments put forth by the Defence:

(a) In respect of the First Contemporaneous Statement, the accused had
allegedly remained silent when the statement recorder, SSSgt Khairul, asked
him what the “A” and “B” Exhibits were. SSSgt Khairul then asked whether he
took drugs, and the accused responded “panas” and “sejuk”. The accused claims
that Q3 was not asked by SSSgt Khairul. 58

##### Foot Note 58

×

DCS at para 59(a)–(d).

(b) In relation to the Second Contemporaneous Statement, the statement
recorder, SSgt Khairul, likely did not read the statement back to the accused
as he had not read back phrases describing his actions to the accused, 59

and no photographs were shown to the accused. 60

##### Foot Note 60

×

DCS at para 72.

An example of such a phrase recorded in the statement is “… (pointing to one
bundle of brownish granular substance found behind the speedometer)”.

(c) Aside from the deletion in the First Cautioned Statement as set out in
[12(e)], the Defence further argues that Mr Farhan had likely neglected to
interpret the entirety of the charges and the corresponding statements for the
accused, 61

##### Foot Note 61

×

DCS at paras 112 and 118.

and the accused did not initially express that he had nothing to say. 62

##### Foot Note 62

×

DCS at paras 316–319.

Hence, there is doubt over the accuracy of the Cautioned Statements.

(d) In respect of the First Long Statement, the deletions made by IO Neo
merely operated as a façade to portray that the said statement had been
translated and read back to the accused. 63

##### Foot Note 63

×

DCS at paras 124 and 335–337.

(e) The Second Long Statement was inaccurately recorded by IO Neo. 64

##### Foot Note 64

×

DCS at para 350.

30 Fourth, the Defence seems to contest SSSgt Khairul’s testimony on what the
accused had told him prior to the recording of the First Contemporaneous
Statement. To this end, the Defence takes issue with the evidence led from
SSgt Saifuddin, that he had not heard, but instead learned, that the accused
told SSSgt Khairul that the Exhibits from locations later marked “A” and “B”
contained “panas” and “sejuk”. 65

##### Foot Note 65

×

DCS at para 48.

31 Moving next to the Defence’s submission that the Prosecution has failed to
invoke the presumptions under ss 21 and 18(2) of the MDA, the following
propositions are raised to show that the Prosecution has not proven the chain
of custody of the Exhibits beyond reasonable doubt:

(a) the Exhibits were inconsistently marked; and

(b) the movement of the Exhibits in and out of zip-lock bags, and between zip-
lock bags and tamper-proof bags, may result in a break in the chain of
custody.

32 Even if the presumptions under ss 21 and 18(2) of the MDA are operative,
the Defence argues that the presumptions have been successfully rebutted. 66

##### Foot Note 66

×

DCS at para 559.

Issues to be determined

33 Based on the foregoing, the issues for my determination are as follows:

(a) whether the Prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused knowingly imported the Exhibits into Singapore;

(b) whether the Prosecution has successfully relied on the presumptions under
ss 21 and 18(2) of the MDA; and

(c) whether the accused has established, on the balance of probabilities, the
Ignorance Defence.

34 In relation to the actual possession of the Exhibits, I consider the
following sub-issues:

(a) whether the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the
chain of custody of the Exhibits was unbroken;

(b) the relevance and weight to be accorded to the First and Second
Contemporaneous Statement and the First, Second and Third Long Statements;

(c) the reliability of the accused’s admissions to Dr Goh and the
contemporaneous clinical notes P63; and

(d) the evidential significance of the accused’s DNA on the cling wraps of
Exhibit “E3”.

35 In respect of actual knowledge of the nature of the Exhibits, I contemplate
the sub-issues set out at [34(b)]–[34(d)].

36 Moving to the inquiry at [33(b)], I will first consider whether the
presumptions have been successfully invoked by the Prosecution proving the
unbroken chain of custody of the Exhibits beyond a reasonable doubt.

37 Finally, in respect of the inquiry at [33(c)], I consider if the Ignorance
Defence has introduced a reasoned doubt in the Prosecution’s primary case of
actual possession and knowledge or rebutted the Prosecution’s alternative case
which relies on the presumptions.

Elements of the Importation Charges

38 The elements of the offence of importation of a controlled drug under s 7
of the MDA are set out in Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2
SLR 254 (“Adili”) at [27] as follows:

(a) the accused person was in possession of the drugs (the “possession
element”);

(b) the accused person had knowledge of the nature of the drugs (the
“knowledge element”); and

(c) the drugs were intentionally brought into Singapore without prior
authorisation (the “authorisation element”).

39 It is not in dispute that the accused did not have any prior authorisation
to bring the drugs into Singapore. For the possession element, it is necessary
to establish that the accused person was in physical possession of the drugs
and knew that he was in possession of the items in question which turn out to
be the drugs (Adili at [32]).

40 In proving the elements of the offence, the Prosecution may prove the
elements beyond a reasonable doubt or rely on statutory presumptions. In the
present context, the possession element may be fulfilled by reliance of the
presumption of possession under s 21 of the MDA, ie, if any controlled drug is
found in any vehicle, the person in charge of the vehicle for the time being
is presumed to be in possession of the drug. The knowledge element may be
satisfied with the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, ie, any
person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his
possession is presumed to have known the nature of the drug.

Whether the Third Long Statement was made voluntarily

41 I held an ancillary hearing within the main trial as the accused challenged
the admissibility of the Third Long Statement. The Third Long Statement was
recorded by IO Neo on 2 May 2019 at 2.18pm, in Changi Prison Complex, with the
assistance of the certified Malay interpreter, Mr Farhan.

42 At the end of the ancillary hearing, I admitted the Third Long Statement
pursuant to s 258(1) of the CPC as I found that it was voluntarily made and
accurately recorded.

Voluntariness of the Third Long Statement

43 The accused submitted that Mr Farhan uttered two threats to him in Malay
while the Third Long Statement was being recorded. As a result, the accused
provided involuntary incriminating responses to some of the questions he was
asked. Mr Farhan uttered the first threat – “you have to cooperate with us, if
not you will go and die” – at paragraph 50 of the Third Long Statement (“the
First Threat”). 67

##### Foot Note 67

×

Accused’s submissions (“AS”) at para 7.

The second threat – “you must cooperate, if not you will die” – was uttered by
Mr Farhan just before Q2 at paragraph 50 of the Third Long Statement was asked
(“the Second Threat”). 68

##### Foot Note 68

×

AS at para 12.

The First Threat and the Second Threat are collectively referred to as the
“Threats”. The accused’s case was that the Threats were uttered by Mr Farhan
“possibly” with IO Neo’s authority. 69

##### Foot Note 69

×

AS at para 7.

44 On the other hand, the Prosecution submitted that neither Mr Farhan nor IO
Neo issued any threat, inducement or promise to the accused. Accordingly, the
Third Long Statement was made voluntarily and was admissible under s 258(1) of
the CPC. 70

##### Foot Note 70

×

Prosecution’s submissions (“PS”) at paras 44–45.

45 In Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor [2021] 1 SLR 557 (“Sulaiman”) at
[39], the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the two-stage test for determining the
voluntariness of a statement:

(a) whether objectively there was a threat, inducement or promise made to the
accused, and having reference to the charge against him (the “objective
limb”); and

(b) whether subjectively, the threat, inducement or promise was such that it
would be reasonable for the accused to think that by making the statement he
would gain some advantage or avoid any adverse consequences in relation to the
proceedings against him (the “subjective limb”).

46 Further, where an ancillary hearing is convened to determine the
admissibility of a statement, the legal burden of proof falls on the
Prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was given
voluntarily (Sulaiman at [36]).

Whether the two alleged threats were uttered by Mr Farhan

47 I began by examining the objective limb of the test of voluntariness under
s 258(3) of the CPC. To provide context for the following discussion, I set
out the accused’s account of events leading up to the alleged Threats: 71

##### Foot Note 71

×

AS at paras 8–9.

(a) At paragraph 50 of the Third Long Statement, Mr Farhan asked the accused
why his DNA was found on the Exhibits. However, the accused was not informed
at this point in time that his DNA was found only on Exhibit “E3”.

(b) In response, the accused said he had only put three to four items in the
back of the Car behind the driver’s seat. Mr Farhan then revealed that his DNA
was found on Exhibit “E3”, but the accused maintained that he had only kept
three to four items as described above. Mr Farhan did not believe the accused.

(c) An alleged conversation between IO Neo and Mr Farhan took place in English
(“the Alleged Conversation”). The accused claimed that both of their faces
looked unhappy.

(d) Mr Farhan’s face changed colour and he scolded the accused in English
(“the Alleged Scolding”). The accused was unable to understand the scolding.

(e) Mr Farhan then uttered the First Threat to the accused in Malay: “You must
work together with us, if not you will go and die”.

(f) Subsequently, prior to the asking of Q2 in paragraph 50, Mr Farhan uttered
the Second Threat in Malay, “You have to cooperate with us. If not, you will
go and die.”. 72

18:7–9.

48 Having scrutinised the evidence adduced in the course of the ancillary
hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt
that no threats were issued by Mr Farhan or IO Neo. My reasons were as
follows.

49 First, both IO Neo and Mr Farhan denied the utterance of any threats when
the Third Long Statement was recorded. 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

NE: 9 March 2021, p 68:8–13 (IO Neo, First Threat); NE: 10 March 2021, pp
28:19–23 (Mr Farhan, First Threat), 31:3–7 (Mr Farhan, First and Second
Threat).

I focused my attention on what transpired during the recording of paragraph 50
of the Third Long Statement as the Threats were allegedly issued at that time.
In this regard, IO Neo’s and Mr Farhan’s evidence corroborated each other.
Both of them testified that: (a) the accused was informed that his DNA was
found on Exhibit “E3” and was asked to account for this; and (b) the accused
then said that his DNA was found on Exhibit “E3” as he “could have touched
[Exhibit “E3”]” when keeping it inside the Car (“the accused’s first response
at paragraph 50”). Further, contrary to the Defence’s case, both IO Neo and Mr
Farhan testified that the accused did not speak about keeping items in other
locations of the Car when asked to explain the presence of his DNA on Exhibit
“E3” at paragraph 50. 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

NE: 9 March 2021, p 67:30–31 (IO Neo); NE: 10 March 2021, p 28:10–11 (Mr
Farhan).

On the whole, IO Neo’s and Mr Farhan’s evidence contradicted the accused’s
allegation that the Threats were issued.

50 Second, and in contrast to the Prosecution’s witnesses, the accused’s
version of events was rife with inconsistencies. In respect of the First
Threat, the accused vacillated over who had issued it and the events leading
up to it:

(a) When cross-examining IO Neo, the Defence did not take a clear position on
who issued the First Threat. The Defence initially put it to IO Neo that the
First Threat was “from you and/or Farhan”. Only after the court and
Prosecution sought greater clarity did the Defence accept that “I think the
better person … is to put to Mr Farhan”. 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

NE: 9 March 2021, p 68:12–22.

(b) The accused provided conflicting accounts of when Mr Farhan performed the
Alleged Scolding. When the Defence cross-examined Mr Farhan, it was put to him
that he scolded the accused after the Alleged Conversation and First Threat.
76

##### Foot Note 76

×

NE: 10 March 2021, p 28:24.

Under cross-examination, the accused said that the Alleged Scolding occurred
before the Alleged Conversation and First Threat. 77

##### Foot Note 77

×

NE: 11 March 2021, p 8:8–11.

To compound matters, in his submissions, the accused claimed that he was
scolded after the Alleged Conversation but before the First Threat was
uttered. 78

##### Foot Note 78

×

AS at para 9.

(c) The accused’s account of whose face changed colour before the First Threat
was allegedly uttered was problematic. This was material as it was relevant to
whether IO Neo had been frustrated with the accused’s responses and had a
motive to authorise the Threats. At one point during the cross-examination,
the accused said that IO Neo’s face changed colour. 79

##### Foot Note 79

×

NE: 11 March 2021, p 10:5–9.

Contrastingly, in his submissions, the accused asserted that Mr Farhan’s face
changed colour before the Alleged Scolding although both Mr Farhan and IO Neo
had an “expression of unhappiness” during the Alleged Conversation. 80

##### Foot Note 80

×

AS at para 9.

51 Further, in respect of the Second Threat, it was not even put to IO Neo
that this Threat had allegedly been uttered. 81

##### Foot Note 81

×

NE: 9 March 2021, p 68:8–13.

Mr Farhan took the stand after IO Neo and it was only during the former’s
cross-examination that the allegation of the Second Threat surfaced. Mr Farhan
denied uttering the Second Threat. 82

##### Foot Note 82

×

NE: 10 March 2021, p 31:3–7.

52 These inconsistencies did not paint the testimony of the accused on the
Threats to be credible.

53 Third, the accused’s claim that the Threats operated intermittently on his
mind was difficult to accept. While this point was directly relevant to the
subjective limb of the test of voluntariness, it also undermined the claim
that any threat was issued at all. The accused testified that he understood
the Threats as Mr Farhan wanting him to “confess to everything which was asked
of [him] in [the] statement” [emphasis added]. 83

##### Foot Note 83

×

NE: 11 March 2021, p 15:9–11.

Yet, the accused remained able to provide exculpatory responses in various
parts of the Third Long Statement. To take one example, in the final sentence
of paragraph 51 of the Third Long Statement, the accused was recorded as
saying “I do not know the contents of ‘A1’, ‘A2’, ‘A3’, ‘A4’ and ‘A5’ before I
kept them inside my car”. 84

##### Foot Note 84

×

PBOD at p 33.

The position of the accused that the first half of the sentence (on not
knowing the contents of the packages found at location later marked “A”) was
given voluntarily while the second half of the sentence (where he admitted to
keeping those items inside the Car) had been involuntary, was hard to accept.
85

##### Foot Note 85

×

NE: 10 March 2021, p 49:21–28.

This intermittent operation of the Threats contradicted his own understanding
that Mr Farhan wanted him to confess to everything, and was another factor
undermining the credibility of the accused’s allegation of the Threats having
been made.

54 For these reasons, I found that there were no threats made by IO Neo or Mr
Farhan during the recording of the Third Long Statement. The challenge to the
voluntariness of the Third Long Statement under s 258(3) of the CPC therefore
failed. Consequently, I did not need to address the subjective limb of the
test of voluntariness or whether the Threats proceeded from “a person in
authority”.

Inaccuracies in the Third Long Statement

55 In the course of challenging the voluntariness of the Third Long Statement,
the accused also alleged that certain questions and responses therein were
recorded inaccurately. Chan Seng Onn J in Public Prosecutor v Parthiban
Kanapathy [2021] 5 SLR 372 at [34] made clear that “… unless and until the
part of the recorded statement alleged to be inaccurate or inauthentic is
determined to be accurate and authentic at the conclusion of an ancillary
hearing, it is obvious that it ought not to be considered as part of the
Prosecution’s evidence from which the court will decide whether the accused is
to be called upon to enter his defence.” [emphasis added]. Accordingly, a
distinct but related issue flowing from the challenge to voluntariness was
whether there were inaccuracies in the Third Long Statement which affected its
admissibility.

56 A summary of the alleged inaccuracies in the Third Long Statement is as
follows:

S/N| Paragraph in Third Long Statement| What is recorded in the Third Long
Statement| Alleged inaccuracy  
---|---|---|---  
1\. | [50]| (Recorder’s note: accused was informed that his DNA was found on the cling wraps on exhibit ‘E3’.

57 I begin by noting that the accused signed the Third Long Statement. 98

PBOD at pp 32–35; NE: 11 March 2021, p 12:26–29.

Further, IO Neo and Mr Farhan confirmed that the accused declined to make
amendments to the Third Long Statement when offered the chance to do so. 100

##### Foot Note 100

×

NE: 9 March 2021 p 57:13–15 (IO Neo); NE: 10 March 2021, p 18:3–5 (Mr Farhan).

Against the backdrop of my finding that no threats were made, the narration by
IO Neo and Mr Farhan of the events leading up to the accused signing the
statement was preferred over the accused’s version of events. I note that the
accused had signed the Third Long Statement after it was read back to him and
he declined to make any amendments.

58 In particular, with regard the challenge to Q1 at paragraph 61 of the Third
Long Statement, the accused blew hot and cold about the nature of his
challenge. This undermined the credibility of his challenge. While he claimed,
at first, that his affirmative response was given involuntarily, he later said
that he answered “Yes” voluntarily but in response to a different question
than what was recorded. He later asserted that the question he had been asked
was: “explain whether this item was found in [the] car”. The fluidity of his
case aside, I did not think the question the accused alleged was asked at Q1
of paragraph 61 cohered with the rest of the Third Long Statement. At multiple
points in the Third Long Statement, Mr Farhan asked the accused whether he
kept certain items in various locations of the Car (eg, paragraph 53 Q1,
paragraph 54 Q1 and Q2, paragraph 57 Q2). The accused did not challenge the
fact that these questions were asked. The phrasing of Q1 at paragraph 61, as
recorded, was entirely consistent with the wording of these earlier questions.
The accused had not credibly demonstrated why the accuracy of the recording of
Q1 at paragraph 61 should be doubted.

59 For the foregoing reasons, the challenges to the accuracy of the Third Long
Statement failed.

Conclusion on the admissibility of the Third Long Statement

60 In conclusion, I dismissed the accused’s challenges to the voluntariness
and accuracy of the Third Long Statement. The Third Long Statement was found
to be admissible under s 258(1) of the CPC.

Whether the Prosecution has established the possession element in respect of
the Charges

61 It is undisputed that the Exhibits were recovered from the Car 101

Integrity of the chain of custody of the Exhibits

62 I deal first with the integrity of the chain of custody, as the Defence
suggests that the chain of custody of the Exhibits was not established. 103

##### Foot Note 103

×

DCS at paras 10, 33–51 and 143–297.

The Statement of Agreed Facts (“SOAF”) sets out how the Exhibits were
recovered from the Car after the accused’s arrest and how they were passed
from one officer to another until they ended up with IO Neo, and were finally
submitted to the HSA for analysis. 104

##### Foot Note 104

×

SOAF at paras 4–6, 10–11, 14, 21–25, 28, 30–32, 36–39, 41–42 and 47–48.

Even putting aside what was agreed in the SOAF, I find that the chain of
custody has been established on the evidence.

63 The legal principles are well established. It is incumbent on the
Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the chain of custody of the
exhibits, and to account for the movement of the exhibits from the point of
seizure to the point of analysis, such that there cannot be a single moment
that is not accounted for if this might give rise to a reasonable doubt as to
the identity of the exhibits (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in Mohamed
Affandi bin Rosli v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2019] 1 SLR 440
(“Affandi”) at [39]). That said, speculative arguments regarding the mere
possibility of contamination are insufficient (Affandi at [118]).

64 The Prosecution has adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of
proof demonstrating an unbroken chain of custody beyond a reasonable doubt.

##### Foot Note 139

×

PS11 at para 4: ABOD at p 217.

76 The Defence raises three main contentions in its submission that the
Prosecution has not proven the chain of custody of the Exhibits beyond a
reasonable doubt.

77 The Defence’s first argument relates to the accused not witnessing the
recovery of the Exhibits from the Car 140

##### Foot Note 140

×

DCS at paras 452 and 456.

and the weighing of the Exhibits subsequently. 141

##### Foot Note 141

×

DCS at paras 278–279 and 491.

78 In relation to the former point that the accused did not observe the
retrieval of the Exhibits, the accused’s case is that he had not witnessed the
search and recovery of the Exhibits. In relation to the recovery of the
Exhibits from locations later marked “A” and “B” (the “First Search”), the
accused testified that he was standing with his back facing the Car and was
unable to see. 142

##### Foot Note 142

×

NE: 27 July 2021, p 5:1–16.

The accused also stated that he was seated and unable to see the search and
recovery of the Exhibits from the locations later marked “C”, “D”, “E” and “F”
(the “Second Search”). 143

##### Foot Note 143

×

NE: 27 July 2021, p 6:1–2.

79 However, SSSgt Khairul and SSgt Zuraidah testified that the accused was at
the rear of the Car and had an unobstructed view of the search and seizure of
the Exhibits during the First Search. 144

##### Foot Note 144

×

NE: 2 March 2021, p 48:19–27 (SSSgt Khairul); NE: 26 July 2021 at p 4:3–23
(SSgt Zuraidah).

Although SSgt Saifuddin’s evidence was that the accused was seated at the rear
of the Car when he retrieved the Exhibits during the First Search, he attested
to the accused’s clear line of vision during the process. 145

##### Foot Note 145

×

NE: 2 March 2021 at p 5:11–17.

In relation to the Second Search, while SSSgt Ritar was ultimately unable to
recall whether the accused was seated, 146

##### Foot Note 146

×

NE: 3 March 2021 at p 55:2–3.

Sgt Amos testified that he escorted the accused and he and the accused both
witnessed the search and retrieval of the Exhibits. 147

##### Foot Note 147

×

NE: 3 March 2021 at p 62:2–8 and 12–18.

80 On the whole, I disbelieve the accused on his evidence that he had not
witnessed the search and recovery of the Exhibits. In arriving at this
conclusion, I considered the evidence of the officers who were with the
accused at the time of the searches above at [79], and their explicit
testimony that both the accused and themselves were able to observe the entire
process. More importantly, the testimony of each escorting officer, SSSgt
Khairul and Sgt Amos, shows that the accused had a clear view of the Car
during both searches. At the First Search, SSSgt Khairul escorted the accused
throughout the search, 148

##### Foot Note 148

×

PS26 at para 4: ABOD pp 159–160.

and he testified that the accused witnessed the retrieval of the Exhibits and
that they shared the same vantage point. 149

##### Foot Note 149

×

NE: 2 March 2021, p 48:19–27.

This was similarly the case for Sgt Amos who escorted the accused during the
Second Search. 150

##### Foot Note 150

×

NE: 3 March 2021, p 62:2–8 and 12–18.

81 On the latter point that the accused did not witness the weighing of the
Exhibits, the Defence submits that the Prosecution did not show that the
accused was present during the weighing of the Exhibits retrieved from
locations later marked “A” and “B”. 151

##### Foot Note 151

×

DCS at para 42.

This submission does not get the accused far; it is clear from the evidence
that the weighing of Exhibit “A1” was in the accused’s presence at Room B-318,
and the weighing of the other Exhibits retrieved from the locations later
marked “A” and “B” commenced only after the accused was brought from Room
B-318 to the CNB office at the Woodlands Checkpoint (where Exhibit “A1” was
re-weighed as well). 152

##### Foot Note 152

×

NE: 2 March 2021, p 16:12–13 (SSgt Saifuddin); NE: 26 July 2021, pp 13:30–32
and 14:2–8 (SSSgt Zuraidah); PS42 at paras 6–10 (conditioned statement of
SSSgt Zuraidah); P175.

Furthermore, this contention was not canvassed during the cross-examination of
the prosecution witnesses and only arose when the accused took the stand. In
the absence of any reasonable explanation from the accused as to the
belatedness of the contention, it would be challenging to accord this argument
any merit.

82 The Defence’s second argument relates to the potential break in the chain
of custody in the movement of the Exhibits recovered from locations later
marked “E” and “F” from the zip-lock bags to the tamper-proof bags. 153

##### Foot Note 153

×

DCS at para 183.

It is not clear how the Defence envisages this potential break in the chain of
custody. The Defence ventures to say that the resealable nature of the zip-
lock bags P170 and P171, which contained the Exhibits found at locations later
marked “E” and “F” respectively, lends to the ease of a break in the chain of
custody between the point of recovery from the Car and the eventual analysis
by the HSA. 154

##### Foot Note 154

×

DCS at para 280.

However, this is insufficient to introduce a reasonable doubt in the chain of
custody. Whether the resealable characteristic of the zip-lock bags was
exploited has no grounding in the evidence.

83 The Defence postulates that SSSgt Ritar and Sgt Amos were not involved when
the Exhibits retrieved from locations later marked “C” to “F” were weighed in
the presence of the accused. 155

##### Foot Note 155

×

DCS at para 277.

It is not SSSgt Ritar’s evidence that she was involved in the weighing of the
Exhibits. Sgt Amos testified that he was involved in the weighing of the
Exhibits, 156

##### Foot Note 156

×

NE, 3 March 2021 at pp 67:14–32 and 68:1–11 (Sgt Amos).

and the Defence did not contest his involvement when they had the opportunity
to cross-examine Sgt Nadirah and SSgt Renjie, who were also involved in the
weighing of the Exhibits. In the same breath, the Defence contends that the
markings of the Exhibits must have been mixed up by Sgt Amos sealing the
Exhibits again after he weighed them. 157

##### Foot Note 157

×

DCS at para 277.

I reject any submission that Sgt Amos was not involved in the weighing of the
Exhibits. Further, the mere fact that Sgt Amos unsealed the two resealable
zip-lock bags 158

##### Foot Note 158

×

P170 and P171.

(containing the Exhibits retrieved from locations later marked “E” and “F”) in
order to weigh the Exhibits, before placing and sealing them in tamper-proof
bags, 159

##### Foot Note 159

×

P172A–172C and P173A–P173C.

does not in itself result in any break in the chain of custody of the
Exhibits.

84 The Defence’s third argument is that there are actual and apparent
inconsistencies in the markings of the Exhibits.

85 First, in support of its submission, the Defence relies on SSgt Saifuddin’s
evidence that he did not know (and therefore could not confirm) that the
locations where the Exhibits were found were the locations later marked “A”
and “B”. 160

##### Foot Note 160

×

DCS at para 45.

This does not assist the Defence – SSgt Saifuddin explained that the location
markings were assigned by IO Neo on 30 October 2018 at about 5.16am after his
seizure of the Exhibits from the Car, 161

##### Foot Note 161

×

NE: 2 March 2021, p 27:12–16; PS41 at para 7 (conditioned statement of IO
Neo): ABOD at p 230.

and attested to the specific locations from which he recovered the Exhibits
(ie, the left-rear compartment of the Car (location later marked “A”) and the
right-rear compartment of the Car (location later marked “B”)) 162

##### Foot Note 162

×

NE: 2 March 2021, pp 27:17–18 and 24–27.

which are consistent with IO Neo’s evidence on his marking of the locations
depicted in photographs 20 and 22 in photo bundle P5 as “A” and “B”
respectively. 163

##### Foot Note 163

×

NE: 26 July 2021, p 48:10–18.

Further, in retrieving and marking the Exhibits, SSgt Saifuddin did not label
them individually, but placed each Exhibit into individual small zip-lock bags
before placing them into a larger zip-lock bag marked “L” and “R” (which
represented the left-rear compartment and the right-rear compartment of the
Car where the Exhibits were retrieved from respectively). 164

NE: 2 March 2021, pp 7:26–32, 8:1–10 and 9:1–13.

87 Second, in relation to the Exhibits retrieved from the locations later

inconsistencies in the Exhibit markings, 169

##### Foot Note 169

×

DCS at paras 143, 166, 219, 239 and 243.

and submits that the markings “surely had been mixed up” by the sealing and
resealing of the bags containing the Exhibits during the weighing process. 170

##### Foot Note 170

×

DCS at para 277.

While there were changes to the markings on the Exhibits (see below at [88]),
the evidence shows that SSSgt Ritar and IO Neo had, in substance, referred to
the same locations.

88 In summary, the initial markings by SSSgt Ritar of the Exhibits retrieved
from locations later marked “C”, “D”, “E” and “F” and the eventual markings by
IO Neo are as follows.

89 IO Neo confirmed that the new markings for the Exhibits corresponded to the
respective location markings, eg, Exhibit “D1” was found at the location later
marked “D”. 173

##### Foot Note 173

×

NE: 26 July 2021, p 50:17–22.

More pertinently, IO Neo identified the Exhibit locations with reference to
photographs in photo bundle P5, and explained that the specific locations and
their associated markings correspond to the descriptions of the locations in
the original markings by SSSgt Ritar. For example, IO Neo explained that the
location later marked “D” depicted in photographs 35 to 37 of photo bundle P5
(where Exhibit “D1” was found) 174

##### Foot Note 174

×

NE: 26 July 2021, p 50:23–25.

corresponds to the location described in the original exhibit marking
“Passenger side air-con vent, C2”. Using the same example, subsequently,
during the photography of the Exhibit “D1”, IO Neo would instruct the forensic
officers to remove the contents of “D1” and assign markings to each individual
sub-packet within “D1”, eg, “D1A”, “D1B” and “D1C” (with reference to
photograph 54 of photo bundle P5). 175

##### Foot Note 175

×

NE: 26 July 2021, pp 50:28–32 and 51:1–9.

The sub-packets found within the other Exhibits were given similar markings by
IO Neo. 176

##### Foot Note 176

×

NE: 26 July 2021, p 51:10–17.

Therefore, there was no actual inconsistency in the marking of the Exhibits.

90 Turning to the Defence’s submission that the markings on the Exhibits
retrieved from locations later marked “C”, “D”, “E” and “F” must have been
mixed up during the weighing process, 177

##### Foot Note 177

×

DCS at para 277.

I find no basis for this assertion in the evidence. Similar to the analysis at
[82]–[83], the mere fact that the Exhibits were removed from the resealable
zip-lock bags for weighing and subsequently placed in tamper-proof bags does
not necessarily lead to the inference that there would be any mix-up of the
labels of the Exhibits.

91 The Prosecution has therefore proven the unbroken chain of custody of the
Exhibits beyond a reasonable doubt.

The accused’s admissions to Dr Goh

92 Before this court, Dr Goh testified that he had examined the accused on a
total of four occasions, being, 14 November 2018, 21 November 2018, 27
November 2018, and 4 December 2018 at the Medical Centre at Changi Prison
Complex. 178

I will refer mainly to the type-written transcript P63T of Dr Goh’s hand-
written clinical notes P63.

93 I deal first with the Defence’s objections to the reliability and accuracy
of Dr Goh’s notes which record the accused’s admissions. The Defence’s
position that Dr Goh’s notes ought to be given no weight is grounded on two
premises.

94 First, the Defence submits that Dr Goh had inaccurately recorded his
interviews with the accused. Based on his clinical notes P63, the accused told
Dr Goh on 21 November 2018 that he was “charged for charging [sic] in heroin,
ganga [sic] and ice”. Dr Goh clarified that he meant that the accused informed
him that he was “charged for bringing in heroin, ganja and ice” [emphasis
added]. 180

##### Foot Note 180

NE: 9 March 2021, pp 17:18–32 and p 18:1–5.

The Defence contends that the accused must have told Dr Goh that he was
charged for bringing in heroin, “ganja” and “ice”, and not that he brought in
heroin, “ganja” and “ice”, 181

##### Foot Note 181

×

and points out that Dr Goh’s record of the accused saying that he faced two
charges cannot be accurate as the accused was facing three charges by that
time. 182

##### Foot Note 182

×

DCS at para 92.

95 The Defence’s interpretation does not withstand scrutiny. While Dr Goh’s
handwritten clinical notes P63 included a clerical error, the rest of the
handwritten notes for the interview on 21 November 2018, particularly at page
9, contain the accurate record of what the accused had said, which was: “I
came to Sg to bring the items I was charged for ‘ice’ ‘heroin’ ‘ganja’”.

96 The Defence’s characterisation of the evidence was not explored in its
cross-examination of Dr Goh. The accused claims in his EIC that, contrary to
Dr Goh’s notes, he had not told Dr Goh that he was sentenced for previous
charges. 183

##### Foot Note 183

×

DCS at para 493, NE: 27 July 2021, p 20:2–14.

Even if I do not reject the Defence’s perspective, it remains that the few
purported inaccuracies in Dr Goh’s notes are clerical or semantic. Such
alleged inaccuracies are of no use to the Defence’s submission that no weight
should be placed on the accused’s confessions in Dr Goh’s notes.

97 In this vein, the Defence has only offered a bare denial of other, arguably
more incriminating, portions of Dr Goh’s notes (see below at [100]–[102]). For
instance, the accused told Dr Goh on 21 November 2018 that he was “aware” that
he was “bringing ice, heroin, ganja”, 184

##### Foot Note 184

×

expressed on 27 November 2018 that he entered Singapore as he wanted to
“deliver the thing…that caused [him] to be arrested ‘ice, heroin, ganja’” 185

##### Foot Note 185

×

P63: PBOD at p 25; P63T at p 13.

and later explained on 4 December 2018 that he “obtained ice, ganja, heroin
from a friend of [his] … called ‘Din’”. 186

##### Foot Note 186

×

P63: PBOD at p 29; P63T at p 17.

Throughout these three interviews with Dr Goh, the accused consistently
informed Dr Goh that he did so to obtain payment of RM15,000. 187

##### Foot Note 187

×

P63: PBOD at pp 20, 25 and 28; P63T at pp 8, 13 and 16.

Instead, the Defence deals summarily with the accuracy of Dr Goh’s notes by
underscoring that the interpreter, Mr Shaffiq, did not translate Dr Goh’s
notes and read them back to the accused. 188

##### Foot Note 188

×

DCS at para 495.

98 Second, the Defence submits that Mr Shaffiq is affiliated with CNB. The
evidence led at the trial does not support such an assertion. Mr Shaffiq’s
evidence is that he is a freelance Malay language interpreter, and the
Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) solicited his services to assist Dr Goh in
interviews with the accused. 189

he did not go so far as to attest to this as a matter of personal knowledge.
191

language was a concern. 192

undermined by an affiliation, real or imagined, with the CNB. 193

DCS at para 104.

99 Having dealt with the Defence’s contentions on Dr Goh’s notes, I move now
to consider the accused’s admissions as recorded in Dr Goh’s notes in the
context of the possession element. As discussed above at [39], the Prosecution
must prove both that the accused had physical possession and knew that he was
in possession of the Exhibits which contained the drugs at the material time.

100 Referring to Dr Goh’s clinical notes P63, the accused admitted that he
knowingly brought “ice”, “ganja” and “heroin” into Singapore in the interview
on 21 November 2018. In particular, in response to Dr Goh’s question if he
“[k]new that he was bringing in drugs then”, the accused replied that he was
“aware that [he] was bringing ice, heroin, ganja” and provided details about
taking the “drugs from [somebody] call [sic] ‘Din’” and the agreed
remuneration of RM15,000. 194

##### Foot Note 194

×

P63T at p 8; NE: 9 March 2021, p 20:1–2.

101 On a separate occasion on 27 November 2018, the accused revisited the
events of the date of the offending with Dr Goh, and intimated that he “wanted
to deliver the thing – the thing that caused me to be arrested” and clarified
that the thing was “‘[i]ce’, ‘heroin’, ‘ganja’”. 195

##### Foot Note 195

×

P63T at p 13; NE: 9 March 2021, pp 20:18–32 and 21:1–11.

The accused shared that the drugs were from “a friend” called “Din”, and
restated that he would be paid RM15,000 for this trip and that he drove the
Car alone. 196

##### Foot Note 196

×

P63T at p 13.

102 Finally, during another interview on 4 December 2018, the accused told Dr
Goh that he placed the drugs in the Car and indicated the area where the
Exhibits containing the drugs were found, viz, “[i]tems found at last row at
place where water bottles being held, right and left side”. 197

##### Foot Note 197

×

P63T at p 16.

In this interview, the accused again reinforced that he had a RM15,000
monetary incentive for bringing in the drugs to Singapore, and that “Din” had
given him the drugs to transport to Singapore. 198

##### Foot Note 198

×

NE: 9 March 2021, p 22:1–28.

103 The consistent re-telling of the events surrounding the alleged offences
by the accused to Dr Goh on three occasions lends weight to the finding that
Dr Goh’s notes accurately captured the accused’s answers to his questions in
their interviews. I consider the accused’s admissions to Dr Goh significant in
their own right, and they provide corroboration of the voluntariness and
accuracy of the Third Long Statement.

104 In respect of the possession element, the admissions by the accused to Dr
Goh, as recorded in his clinical notes P63, render the Ignorance Defence
hollow and buttress the finding that the accused knowingly held the Exhibits
in his possession.

The accused’s DNA on Exhibit “E3”

105 It is not disputed that the accused’s DNA was detected on Exhibit “E3”.
The Defence relies on the evidence of HSA analyst Ang Hwee Chen (“Ang”) that a
person’s DNA may be indirectly transferred to an exhibit to support its
submission that the DNA profile of the accused could have been transferred by
another person to Exhibit “E3”. 199

##### Foot Note 199

×

DCS at para 9.

However, this hypothetical possibility does not assist the accused. There is
no evidence adduced to explain how the accused’s DNA could have ended up on
the Exhibit. As such, this remains entirely theoretical. The accused’s DNA
found on Exhibit “E3” is evidence which precipitated the accused’s confessions
in the Third Long Statement. The objective finding that the accused’s DNA
profile was found on Exhibit “E3” clearly refutes any claim that the accused
did not know of the Exhibits retrieved from location later marked “E”, and
undermines the Ignorance Defence: the accused has not been truthful about his
claim that he had no knowledge of Exhibits other than those retrieved from
location later marked “B”.

Weight to be accorded to the accused’s statements relevant to the possession
element

106 Following that, I deal with the accused’s statements which establish the
possession element and the appropriate weight to be placed on them.

109 I do not accept the Defence’s submission that the First Contemporaneous
Statement was inaccurately recorded. The accused claims that he was silent
because he was feeling unwell and experiencing drug withdrawals. However, this
justification only made its appearance in fthe accused’s EIC.

110 In support of the contention that the accused had been silent due to drug
withdrawal symptoms, the Defence relies on the evidence led from the doctors
who assessed the accused around the material time of the First Contemporaneous
Statement. In particular, the Defence seizes on the conclusion that the
accused was “positive for mild opioid drug withdrawal” in the medical report
dated 18 January 2019 (P61) prepared by Dr Tan Zi Feng of the Cluster Medical
Centre located at the Changi Prison Complex (“CMC”). 208

##### Foot Note 208

×

ABOD at pp 147–148.

The medical report P61 was written based on the assessments of the accused
conducted by Dr Tan Chong Han (“Dr Tan”), Dr Sahaya Nathan (“Dr Nathan”) and
Dr Ong Rong Hua, Jason (“Dr Ong”) separately over the period of 1–3 November
2018. 209

111 Despite the Defence’s contentions about the robustness of the assessment
by the doctors, 210

##### Foot Note 210

×

DCS at para 59(l)–(q).

I find the evidence of the doctors satisfactory and accept that the accused
was found positive for “mild opiate withdrawal”. The common criteria for the
Clinical Opiate Withdrawal (“COW”) Scale assessment adopted by all three
doctors were found in the checklist of clinical “observations” and “symptoms”
or “complaints” in the Case Summary of Drug Withdrawal Assessment P174. 211

##### Foot Note 211

×

P174 at p 3.

The assessing doctors had all found that the accused exhibited very few of the
observations or symptoms (the presence of the observation or symptom is
denoted by “1”). Given the evidence of the doctors, I do not find that the
accused had been experiencing drug withdrawals at a level of severity which
would affect the reliability of the First Contemporaneous Statement.
Regardless, Dr Tan’s evidence, that the duration of positive mild opioid
withdrawals may vary from individual to individual 212

##### Foot Note 212

and that symptoms exhibited would differ, 213

##### Foot Note 213

×

NE: 4 March 2021, p 56:14–18.

requires a closer examination of the First Contemporaneous Statement.

112 The weakness of the accused’s claim is made apparent in the manner in
which he contests the accuracy of the First Contemporaneous Statement. In
relation to Q1, where the accused was asked an open-ended question on what the
Exhibits retrieved from locations later marked “A” and “B” were, the accused
claims that he was silent due to his withdrawals and had only responded with
“panas and sejuk” recorded in A1 when he was asked if he took drugs. More
inconceivably, the accused testified that Q3 and Q9 were never posed to him
but confirmed the main substance of the First Contemporaneous Statement where
it was favourable to his case – that the accused was supposed to send the
“panas” and “sejuk” to “postal code … 730011” but “did not know there were
other drugs hidden inside”. 214

##### Foot Note 214

×

P55 at Q4/A4 to Q8/A8: ABOD at pp 162–163.

113 The claim that the accused was experiencing withdrawals and feeling unwell
at the point of the recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement was never
put to the statement recorder, SSSgt Khairul, at cross-examination. Instead,
SSSgt Khairul’s evidence was that the accused comprehended every question
posed to him and responded “logically and to the question that was asked”. 215

##### Foot Note 215

×

NE: 2 March 2021, p 58:27–31.

114 Taking the First Contemporaneous Statement in its entirety, it does not
appear plausible to me that the accused slipped in and out of the alleged
drug-induced silence to proffer coherent explanations about matters which
related only to his personal knowledge, such as where he was supposed to
deliver the drugs and the expected remuneration, yet conveniently operated
under the influence of drug withdrawals in his answers on the nature of the
specific drugs he carried.

115 On the contrary, the accused has been inconsistent on his alleged account
of the statement recording – while it was put to SSSgt Khairul that A9 was
inaccurate, 216

##### Foot Note 216

NE: 2 March 2021, p 83:12–24.

the accused in his EIC testified that Q9 was never asked. 217

##### Foot Note 217

×

NE: 27 July 2021, p 10:21–26.

The accused then shifted to agreeing with the Prosecution in his cross-
examination that the First Contemporaneous Statement was accurately recorded
218

##### Foot Note 218

×

NE: 27 July 2021, pp 47:29–31 and 48:4–6.

before reverting to his original claim that the said Statement was an
inaccurate record, 219

##### Foot Note 219

×

but only in respect of the first page. 220

##### Foot Note 220

×

NE: 29 July 2021, p 5:22–24.

However, Q9 was on the second page of the First Contemporaneous Statement, and
not the first page.

116 Given the medical evidence and the inconsistencies in the accused’s
alleged account of the recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement, I
disbelieve the accused when he says that he had remained silent. Due weight
must be placed on the First Contemporaneous Statement.

117 In this regard, the Defence has not raised any allegation that the accused
was unwell or experiencing withdrawals in respect of the Second
Contemporaneous Statement even though it was recorded shortly after the First
Contemporaneous Statement and prior to the COW Scale assessments conducted by
the doctors. In fact, it was recorded that “B1 was feeling okay and ready to
give his statement in the Malay language” at the beginning of the Second
Contemporaneous Statement. This undermines the Defence’s position that the
accused had been suffering from drug withdrawals at the point of the recording
of the First Contemporaneous Statement.

118 Further, the Defence asserts that it is highly unlikely that the First
Contemporaneous Statement was accurately recorded because of the relative
length of time it took to record it compared against the prior conversation
between SSSgt Khairul and the accused in Room B-318. 221

##### Foot Note 221

×

DCS at para 58.

It is not clear how this undermines the accuracy of the First Contemporaneous
Statement: SSSgt Khairul’s evidence was not that the First Contemporaneous
Statement was a record of the conversation he had with the accused in Room
B-318 prior to its recording; instead, SSSgt Khairul testified that the
accused had already identified the Exhibits recovered from locations later
marked “A” and “B” as “panas” (heroin) and “sejuk” (methamphetamine) during
their conversation in Room B-318 before he identified the Exhibits in his
answers recorded in the First Contemporaneous Statement. I reject the
Defence’s suggestion that the First Contemporaneous Statement was inaccurately
recorded because its recording took a relatively shorter amount of time
compared to the time SSSgt Khairul spent with the accused in Room B-318.

119 In accepting that the First Contemporaneous Statement was accurately
recorded, I conclude that the accused knew that the Exhibits retrieved from
locations later marked “A” and “B” were “panas” (heroin) and “sejuk”
(methamphetamine) and admitted that they belonged to him. The inescapable
conclusion is that the accused knowingly possessed the Exhibits recovered from
locations later marked “A” and “B”.

Second Contemporaneous Statement

120 I now address the Second Contemporaneous Statement. While it mainly deals
with the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs retrieved from
locations later marked “C”, “D”, “E” and “F”, the Defence relies on A18 to
demonstrate the credibility of the Ignorance Defence. 222

##### Foot Note 222

The relevant section of the Second Contemporaneous Statement is reproduced
below: 223

Q18) Who does all these belong to?

A18) I do not know. I am only aware of the 4 bundles that they ‘Din’ gave me.
I do not know of any other drugs hidden in the car.

121 Although A18 appears to provide support for the Ignorance Defence, the
answer must be seen in the context of the rest of the Statement and the other
admissions made by the accused. The accused’s answers to the rest of the
questions in the Second Contemporaneous Statement show that he knew that the
Exhibits retrieved from locations later marked “C” to “F” were heroin and
cannabis. However, the Defence contends that the accused’s answers to Q13 to
Q16 were merely the accused identifying the type of drug by visual examination
of the Exhibits shown to him. 224

##### Foot Note 224

×

DCS at paras 477–485.

122 Despite the accused’s response at A18 and his explanation on why he was
able to identify the Exhibits seized from locations later marked “C” to “F”,
the presence of the accused’s DNA on Exhibit “E3” is incontrovertible evidence
that he must have handled the Exhibit. Taken together with his admissions in
the Third Long Statement (which I have found both admissible and accurate
above at [60]) when he was confronted with this finding, it must be that the
accused identified the Exhibits referred to in A13 to A16 because he knew that
the Exhibits contained heroin and cannabis at the material time. I cannot
consider A18 in isolation. I have to take into account the accused’s answers
to the rest of the questions in the Second Contemporaneous Statement, his DNA
on Exhibit “E3” and his admissions in the Third Long Statement. When viewed in
this light, I find that A18 was not a credible answer. Thus, A18 of the Second
Contemporaneous Statement does not support the accused’s Ignorance Defence.

First Long Statement

123 I move to the First Long Statement.

124 The First Long Statement was recorded by IO Neo with the assistance of a
Malay interpreter, Mr Farhan, at an interview room at the Police Cantonment
Complex. 225

##### Foot Note 225

##### Foot Note 226

On the other hand, the Defence submits that the First Long Statement was
inaccurately recorded and not read back to the accused. 227

##### Foot Note 227

×

DCS at para 124.

I deal with the key arguments put forth by the Defence in support of its
contention.

125 The Defence’s first basis for its objection is that the accused did not
provide certain information recorded in the First Long Statement at paragraphs
5, 11 and 13. For instance, it is the Defence’s case that the accused had not
said that he helped “Din” to deliver drugs on one other occasion, 228

##### Foot Note 228

×

P67 at para 11; NE: 27 July 2021, p 25:17–23.

nor did he say that he did not know there were drugs inside the car during the
first time. 229

##### Foot Note 229

×

P67 at para 13.

The Defence contrasts paragraphs 11 and 12 of the First Long Statement: 230

##### Foot Note 230

×

DCS at para 342.

paragraph 11 states that the accused brought drugs into Singapore on one other
occasion and paragraph 12 states that “Din” did not pass the accused any drugs
on the first occasion. In emphasising this apparent contradiction, the Defence
posits that part of paragraph 13 which states that the accused “did not know
there was drugs inside the car during the first time” was not said by the
accused. 231

##### Foot Note 231

×

DCS at para 343.

The Defence prefers the version of events in paragraph 12 of the First Long
Statement, ie, the accused did not bring drugs into Singapore on the first
occasion.

126 However, no reasonable explanation has been proffered for the source of
the detailed information in paragraphs 11 and 13 in the First Long Statement
which the accused claims did not come from him. As a matter of logic, it would
appear that the objectionable portions would have to come from either IO Neo
or Mr Farhan. Therein lies a fundamental difficulty with the Defence’s
position: had IO Neo or Mr Farhan fabricated any part of the objectionable
portions, why would the consecutive paragraphs read inconsistently? In fact,
the apparent inconsistencies only serve to strengthen the conclusion that the
accused himself gave the information recorded in the First Long Statement.

127 The second basis for the Defence’s rejection of the First Long Statement
relates to the credibility of IO Neo and Mr Farhan. In this connection, the
Defence alleges that the amendment of the commencement time was only made to
serve as an illusion that the First Long Statement was read back to the
accused. 232

##### Foot Note 232

×

DCS at para 337.

Further, IO Neo and Mr Farhan’s unclear evidence on when the amendment was
made indicates that they are not reliable witnesses. However, the evidence of
IO Neo and Mr Farhan does not support these allegations. IO Neo gave evidence
that the amendment was made either when the First Long Statement was being
read back to the accused or after the said Statement had been read back to the
accused, while Mr Farhan testified that he could not recall whether it was
made after the First Long Statement was read back to the accused but confirmed
that it was made during the recording process. Given that some time has passed
since the event, some allowances must be made for the fallibility of human
memory. I do not perceive that IO Neo was “trying to wriggle” 233

##### Foot Note 233

×

DCS at para 336.

out of a situation; similarly, there is nothing extraordinary about Mr Farhan
being unable to recall precisely when during the statement recording process
the amendment was made.

128 Correspondingly, I do not accept the Defence’s proposition that the
accused told IO Neo and Mr Farhan that he kept “three black packets” [emphasis
added] rather than that he “kept the 3 bags inside a compartment near to the
boot of the car” [emphasis added], as recorded at paragraph 5 of the First
Long Statement. 234

##### Foot Note 234

×

DCS at para 338.

While this was put to IO Neo and Mr Farhan (to which they disagreed) during
cross-examination, 235

##### Foot Note 235

×

NE: 26 July 2021, p 32:30–32 (Mr Farhan); NE: 26 July 2021, p 66: 30–32 (IO

the accused later agreed in his EIC that he had referred to the three bags
shown in photograph 48, which were Exhibits “B1”, “B2” and “B3”, and that he
put these three bags into the compartment shown in photograph 29, which was
location later marked “B”. 236

##### Foot Note 236

×

NE: 27 July 2021, p 24:8–17.

Therefore, there is no material contention about paragraph 5 because the
accused ultimately accepts that he kept the Exhibits found at location later
marked “B”.

129 Having dispensed with the Defence’s objections above, the First Long
Statement remains evidence that the accused knowingly possessed Exhibits “B1”,
“B2” and “B3”. 237

##### Foot Note 237

Second Long Statement

130 The Second Long Statement recorded by IO Neo at an interview room at the
Police Cantonment Complex was similarly assisted by the interpreter, Mr
Farhan. The Defence argues that paragraphs 18 and 33 (specifically the line,
“I know they are heroin because I mentioned it earlier that I had wrapped the
heroin and placed them into the black plastic bag.”) did not contain
information furnished by the accused. 238

131 In this respect, the Prosecution surmises that the Defence’s contentions
amount to a vain attempt to resile from parts of the Second Long Statement
which are detrimental to the accused’s case. The challenges to the Second Long
Statement relate to general allegations of poor recording or fabrication by IO
Neo and Mr Farhan. Again, there is no evidence that there was in fact any foul
play by the statement recorder and the translator. Aside from the lack of
specific and substantive opposition, the inherent plausibility of the
Defence’s position is negated by IO Neo and Mr Farhan’s evidence that the
information in the contested paragraphs of the Second Long Statement was given
by the accused.

132 Although the Defence has not canvassed this in its submissions, portions
of the Second Long Statement which have not been disavowed are coherent with
the Ignorance Defence. The accused in the Second Long Statement denied keeping
the Exhibits found at locations later marked “C”, “D”, “E” and “F”, and
claimed not having seen them prior to his arrest. 239

However, these denials must be weighed against the strength of the other
evidence, including, the accused’s admissions to Dr Goh, the accused’s DNA on
Exhibit “E3”, and his confession that he had knowingly kept all of the
Exhibits in the Car in the Third Long Statement (where he was confronted with
the finding that his DNA had been found on Exhibit “E3”). Considering the
totality of the evidence, the accused’s denial in the Second Long Statement
does not assist the Ignorance Defence.

133 At paragraphs 4 to 5 of the First Long Statement, the accused stated that
“Din” handed him three bags. However, in the Second Long Statement at
paragraph 18, the accused claimed that “Din” handed him one bag. There is no
material inconsistency between the two versions, as the accused stated within
paragraph 18 of the Second Long Statement that the one bag contained “3 big
packets of heroin”. Further, even if the accounts on what “Din” had handed the
accused in paragraphs 4–5 of the First Long Statement and paragraph 18 of the
Second Long Statement differ slightly, both versions belie the accused’s
account in his EIC on how he handled the bag(s) upon receipt. At the trial,
the accused maintained that he kept Exhibits “B1”, “B2” and “B3” without
opening them. In both the First and Second Long Statements, however, the
accused said that he knew that heroin was inside the bags handed to him. In my
view, his position at the trial is untenable; it is inexplicable that he had
not checked the bag(s) upon receiving them because he had no prior
relationship of trust with “Din” and the delivery was undoubtedly a business
transaction. Further, the accused’s volte-face on whether he knew the contents
of Exhibits “B1”, “B2” and “B3” at the trial evinces his lack of credibility;
it seems that the accused had done so in order to reconcile his prior
Statements with his case that he only knowingly possessed three packets of
heroin, viz, Exhibits “B1A”, “B1B” and “B1C”. I therefore reject the accused’s
contention that he did not check (and did not know) the contents of Exhibits
“B1”, “B2” and “B3”.

134 Thus, in respect of the possession element, the Second Long Statement
serves to fortify the finding that the accused had been in knowing possession
of the Exhibits found at location later marked “B”. 240

Third Long Statement

135 The Third Long Statement was admitted into evidence after the ancillary
hearing. In addition to the inaccuracies raised in the accused’s submissions
for the ancillary hearing dealt with above at [57] to [59], the Defence
contends that paragraph 51 of the Third Long Statement was inaccurately
recorded.

136 In its closing submissions, the Defence challenges the accused’s admission
in paragraph 51 that he had kept Exhibits “A1”, “A2”, “A3”, “A4” and “A5” in
the Car. The Defence submits that the accused’s response does not square with
the question asked by IO Neo, which was to explain why the packaging of the
“A” and “B” Exhibits was similar. 241

##### Foot Note 241

×

DCS at para 387.

I do not accept the Defence’s argument that the accused’s answer does not
align with the question posed by IO Neo. It is abundantly clear that the
accused’s response that he did in fact keep Exhibits “A1”, “A2”, “A3”, “A4”
and “A5” in the Car (but did not know of the contents of the Exhibits prior to
keeping them in the Car) was a reasonable answer to IO Neo confronting the
accused about the similarity of the packaging of the “A” and “B” Exhibits.

137 I turn now to consider the bearing of the Third Long Statement on the
possession element. In the Third Long Statement, the accused was informed that
his DNA was found on the cling wraps on Exhibit “E3”. The accused explained
that he could have inadvertently touched the Exhibit when he kept it in the
Car, and admitted to keeping the Exhibits retrieved from location later marked
“E” in the Car. 242

##### Foot Note 242

×

P69 at paras 50: PBOD at p 32.

It follows that the accused was in possession of the Exhibits recovered from
location later marked “E” and was aware of his possession of the Exhibits.

138 Within the same statement, the accused confessed to keeping Exhibits
marked “A1” to “A5”, 243

in the Car as well. It follows that the accused was in possession of all the
Exhibits and knew that he was in possession of them.

139 The accused was confronted with the fact that his DNA was found on Exhibit
“E3” for the first time in the Third Long Statement. Therefore, this was the
turning point where the accused admitted to keeping all the Exhibits in the
Car, and the Third Long Statement establishes that the accused had knowingly
possessed the Exhibits, which were later found to contain the drugs.

140 For the reasons above, I find that the Prosecution has established beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused was in physical possession of all the
Exhibits and knew that the Exhibits were in his possession.

Prosecution’s alternative case on possession

141 I find that the Prosecution’s alternative case on possession is also
satisfied. The accused failed to rebut the presumption of possession under s
21 of the MDA for the same reasons at [62] to [91].

Whether the Prosecution has established the knowledge element of the charges

The First Charge

142 Having considered the evidence, I am satisfied that the knowledge element
of the First Charge has been established.

143 In order to fulfil the knowledge element of the First Charge, the
Prosecution must show that the accused knew that Exhibits “A1A”, “A1B”, “A1C”,
“A2A1A”, “A3A”, “A3B”, “A4A”, “A4B”, “B1A”, “B1B”, “B1C”, “C1A1”, “C1B”,
“C1C1”, “D1A”, “D1B” and “D1C” contained heroin. The Defence does not dispute
that the accused knew of the nature of the drug contained in Exhibits “B1”,
“B2” and “B3”, viz, the accused knew that the Exhibits retrieved from location
later marked “B” contained heroin. In this regard, the accused does not
challenge his knowledge that Exhibits “B1A”, “B1B” and “B1C” contained heroin
at the material time.

144 I set out the evidence in respect of the accused’s knowledge of the nature
of the drug (heroin) contained in Exhibits aside from “B1A”, “B1B” and “B1C”.

First Contemporaneous Statement

145 I give due weight to the First Contemporaneous Statement after assessing
its accuracy above at [116]. The accused identified the Exhibits retrieved
from locations later marked “A” and “B” (ie, seven black bundles and one block
of vegetable matter) as “panas” and “sejuk” in the First Contemporaneous
Statement. At location later marked “A”, four black bundles (Exhibits “A1” to
“A4”) and one block of vegetable matter (Exhibit “A5”) were recovered. Exhibit
“A1” contained individual sub-packets, viz, Exhibits “A1A”, “A1B” and “A1C”.
248

##### Foot Note 248

Photo bundle P5 at photograph 43.

The naming convention is similar for the other Exhibits retrieved from
location later marked “A” which were recovered and marked by IO Neo (see [3]),
eg, individual packets found in Exhibit “A2” would be named “A2X”, where “X”
is a unique letter or number. Therefore, the accused admitted that he knew
that Exhibits “A1A”, “A1B”, “A1C”, “A2A1A”, “A3A”, “A3B”, “A4A” and “A4B”
contained heroin.

Second Contemporaneous Statement

146 The accused recognised the two wrapped bundles (later marked Exhibits “C1”
and “D1”) as “panas” (ie, heroin) in the Second Contemporaneous Statement.

147 I consider briefly the accused’s one-off contention in cross-examination
that he was unsure if the entire Second Contemporaneous Statement was read
back to him. 249

##### Foot Note 249

×

NE: 27 July 2021, p 16:10–12.

While SSgt Khairul did not read back the description of the Exhibit and the
corresponding location it was found in (ie, the phrases within the
parentheses) within his questions, it was made clear that the Exhibits were
retrieved from the Car and he attested to pointing out each Exhibit to the
accused when he read back the statement to the accused. 250

##### Foot Note 250

×

NE: 3 March 2021, pp 87:11–29, 88:1–7 and 98:22.

Consequently, the Second Contemporaneous Statement serves as evidence that the
accused knew of the nature of Exhibits “C1” and “D1” at the material time of
the offence. IO Neo adopted the naming convention described in [145] for these
Exhibits. The accused therefore knew that Exhibits “C1A1”, “C1B”, “C1C1”,
“D1A”, “D1B” and “D1C” contained heroin.

Third Long Statement and confessions in Dr Goh’s clinical notes P63

148 Finally, the accused’s confessions recorded in Dr Goh’s notes and the
admissions in the Third Long Statement serve more generally as evidence that
the accused knew of the nature of the drugs contained in the Exhibits he
brought into Singapore. In the Third Long Statement, the accused again
reiterated that Exhibits “C1” and “D1” were heroin and answered in the
affirmative when asked if he had known of the nature of the Exhibits at the
point at which he kept them in the Car. 251

##### Foot Note 251

×

P69 at paras 53–54: PBOD at p 33–34.

In Dr Goh’s clinical notes P63, he documented the accused’s admissions on
three separate occasions that he had knowingly brought “panas”, “ice” and
“ganja” into Singapore. I set out above that due weight would be given to the
admissions in the Third Long Statement (see [41]–[60]) and the confessions in
Dr Goh’s clinical notes P63 (see [104]).

149 For the above reasons, the knowledge element is established for the First
Charge.

The Second Charge

150 To satisfy the knowledge element of the Second Charge, the Prosecution
must show that the accused knew that Exhibits “B2A”, “B2B”, “B3A” and “B3B”
contained methamphetamine.

151 The Prosecution relies principally on the accused’s admission to SSSgt
Khairul in Room B-318, his admission in the First Contemporaneous Statement
that the Exhibits retrieved from locations later marked “A” and “B” were
“panas and sejuk” (the latter being the street name for methamphetamine), and
the accused’s confessions to Dr Goh that he had brought in the “items” or
“things” which contained, inter alia, “ice”. 252

##### Foot Note 252

×

PCS at paras 39 and 54–59.

I consider the First Contemporaneous Statement accurately recorded for the
reasons set out at [109]–[115].

152 SSSgt Khairul’s account of what the accused had told him in Malay in Room
B-318 prior to the recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement materially
corroborated it. Although the accused claims that he had remained silent when
SSSgt Khairul asked him what the Exhibits retrieved from locations later
marked “A” and “B” were, I accept SSSgt Khairul’s evidence that the accused
had in fact responded to identify the Exhibits as “panas and sejuk”. From the
Prosecution’s arguments at [21], I observe, in particular, that SSgt Saifuddin
testified that SSSgt Khairul contemporaneously informed him of the accused’s
admission at Room B-318.

153 Crucially, SSSgt Khairul had shown the accused the seized Exhibits from
locations later marked “A” and “B” while they were in their original opaque
black bags (save for Exhibit “A5”, which was wrapped in cling wrap) when he
asked the accused what the Exhibits were. The accused had responded that they
were “panas” and “sejuk” even prior to having had the opportunity to visually
examine the sub-packets within the Exhibits (as the accused had the
opportunity to examine the Exhibits during the recording of the First
Contemporaneous Statement). In other words, the accused was able to identify
that “sejuk” (ie, methamphetamine) was contained in the Exhibits recovered
from locations later marked “A” and “B” independent of the subsequent
inspection during the recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement.
Further, the accused maintained that the Exhibits retrieved from locations
later marked “A” and “B” were “panas and sejuk” in the recording of the First
Contemporaneous Statement.

154 In relation to the accused’s statements to Dr Goh that he knowingly
brought “heroin”, “ice” and “ganja” into Singapore over three separate
interviews, Dr Goh testified that his clinical notes were the accused’s
verbatim account of the incident through the certified Malay interpreter, Mr
Shaffiq. 253

##### Foot Note 253

×

NE: 9 March 2021, pp 19:14–30, 20–21 and p 22:1–20.

I accept that the notes were an accurate record of what the accused had told
Dr Goh.

155 Notwithstanding the accused’s identification of Exhibits “B2A”, “B2B”,
“B3A” and “B3B” as “heroin” in the Third Long Statement, 254

##### Foot Note 254

×

P69 at para 57, Q2/A2–Q4/A4 (Third Long Statement): PBOD at pp 34–35.

I nonetheless find that the accused had actual knowledge that he was bringing
methamphetamine into Singapore. I set out my reasons below.

(a) First, the accused told SSSgt Khairul that the Exhibits retrieved from
locations later marked “A” and “B”, which contained Exhibits “B2A”, “B2B”,
“B3A” and “B3B”, were “panas” and “sejuk”. I consider this a significant
admission as the accused identified the nature of the drugs prior to having
seen the sub-packets within the Exhibits later marked “B2” and “B3” (which
were black, opaque packets).

(b) Second, the accused maintained that the Exhibits recovered from locations
later marked “A” and “B”, which contained Exhibits “B2A”, “B2B”, “B3A” and
“B3B”, were “panas and sejuk” in the First Contemporaneous Statement.

(c) Third, the accused’s confessions to Dr Goh on three separate occasions on
21 November 2018, 27 November 2018 and 4 December 2018 were that he had
knowingly brought “ice”, “heroin” and “ganja” into Singapore.

(d) Taken together, I find that the accused knew that he brought, inter alia,
methamphetamine into Singapore, specifically within Exhibits retrieved from
locations later marked “A” and “B” (including the sub-packets, Exhibits later
marked “B2A”, “B2B”, “B3A” and “B3B”, which contained methamphetamine). The
accused had either not been forthcoming or made a mistake in his
misidentification of Exhibits later marked “B2A”, “B2B”, “B3A” and “B3B” as
“heroin”.

156 The totality of the evidence shows that the accused knew the nature of the
Exhibits found at location later marked “B”, ie, that they contained
methamphetamine, and the knowledge element of the Second Charge is
established.

The Third Charge

157 In order to satisfy the knowledge element of the Third Charge, the
Prosecution must show that the accused knew that Exhibits “A5A”, “E1A”, “E2A”,
“E3A”, “E4A”, “E5A”, “F1A”, “F2A”, “F3A”, “F4A” and “F5A” contained vegetable
matter which was found to be cannabis.

158 I find that the accused had actual knowledge that Exhibits “A5A”, “E1A” to
“E5A” and “F1A” to “F5A” contained cannabis on the following evidence:

(a) First, while the accused identified the Exhibits from locations later
marked “A” and “B” (including Exhibit “A5”) collectively as “panas and sejuk”
in the First Contemporaneous Statement, 255

##### Foot Note 255

×

P55 at Q1/A1 to Q2/A2: ABOD at p 162.

the accused’s later confessions in the Second Contemporaneous Statement and
the Third Long Statement evince his knowledge that Exhibit “A5” was cannabis.

(b) Second, the accused recognised Exhibits “E” and “F” as “ganja”, which he
conveyed was “cannabis” in the Second Contemporaneous Statement. 256

##### Foot Note 256

×

P60 at Q15/A15 to Q17/A17: ABOD at p 175.

(c) Third, the accused divulged that he had intentionally brought into
Singapore, inter alia, “ganja”, in his confessions to Dr Goh.

(d) Finally, he admitted to bringing the Exhibits into Singapore in the Third
Long Statement.

159 For the above reasons, the knowledge element is established on the Third
Charge.

160 I find that the Prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that
the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the Exhibits.

Prosecution’s alternative case on knowledge

161 On the Prosecution’s alternative case on knowledge, the Prosecution
succeeds in relying on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA
for each of the Charges.

162 I consider next whether the Defence successfully rebuts the presumption
under s 18(2) of the MDA.

Whether the Ignorance Defence is established on the balance of probabilities?

163 The accused has failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA
by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know the nature of
the drugs found in his possession. I set out my reasons for rejecting the
Ignorance Defence below.

164 The law on rebutting the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA is settled.
In order to displace the presumption, the accused must be able to say what he
thought or believed he was carrying instead of the drug (Obeng Comfort v
Public Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 633 (“Obeng”) at [39]). The next step is to
assess the credibility and the veracity of the accused’s account (Obeng at
[40]). In the situation where an accused person is indifferent to what he is
carrying, he cannot be said to believe that the nature of the thing in his
possession is something other than or incompatible with the specific drug he
is in possession of (Gobi a/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor [2021] 1 SLR 180
(“Gobi”) at [65]). The Court of Appeal in Gobi held as follows (at [65]):

… In this connection, we consider that in the context of rebutting the s 18(2)
presumption, an accused person may be said to be indifferent to the nature of
the thing in his possession if he had the ready means and opportunity to
verify what he was carrying, but failed to take the steps that an ordinary
reasonable person would have taken to establish the nature of the thing, and
also fails to provide any plausible explanation for that failure. …

165 The accused’s main defence lies in his claim that he believed that the
Exhibits retrieved from location later marked “B” only contained heroin. He
held this conviction solely based on the word of “Din”, and did not check the
contents of the Exhibits. A substantial part of the accused’s defence is that
he did not examine the contents of the Exhibits retrieved from location later
marked “B” prior to keeping them in the Car. The accused first raised this
defence at the trial.

166 It is uncontroversial that defences which are mounted at a later stage
will invite more scrutiny. If an exculpatory fact is withheld, the court may
justifiably infer that that fact is an afterthought and untrue, unless there
are good reasons for the accused person’s omission to mention it earlier
(Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor [2021] 1 SLR 67 at [152]).

167 This principle applies to the accused’s defence specifically in relation
to the Exhibits found at location later marked “B”. A key portion of the
accused’s defence, ie, that the accused knew about three packets of heroin at
location later marked “B” only because “Din” told him so, was never raised in
any of the nine statements recorded from the accused. That poses significant
difficulty in the Defence’s discharge of the burden of proof of this defence.
Apart from the lack of a good reason for the absence of the accused’s claim
that he had not ascertained the contents of the Exhibits found at location
later marked “B” from his statements, this defence does not square with common
sense.

168 Under cross-examination, the accused agreed that his denial of paragraph
33 of the Second Long Statement, specifically that he knew that Exhibits “B1”,
“B2” and “B3” were heroin as he had wrapped the Exhibits, placed them into the
black plastic bags and kept them in the Car, was because it contradicted the
Ignorance Defence in so far as the accused claims that he had not checked
Exhibits “B1”, “B2” and “B3” himself. 257

##### Foot Note 257

×

NE: 28 July 2021, p 24:14–21.

Furthermore, the accused agreed that he elected not to check Exhibits “B1”,
“B2” and “B3” despite having no reason to take “Din’s” word for it. 258

##### Foot Note 258

×

NE: 28 July 2021, pp 24:26–32 and 25:4–10.

The accused did not have any relationship of trust with “Din” and the delivery
was a business transaction. The cumulative effect of the accused’s concessions
and his counter-intuitive behaviour is to render the accused’s claims
unbelievable.

169 The implication of the accused’s unusual behaviour, in my view, amounts to
indifference. Taken in its entire context, the accused’s claim in wholly
trusting “Din’s” word that the Exhibits found at location later marked “B”
contained heroin does not cohere with their business arrangement, particularly
where the accused was tasked to deliver the said Exhibits. The accused’s claim
parallels the facts in Gobi where it was held that an accused who was
indifferent to what he was carrying cannot be said to believe that the nature
of the thing in his possession was something other than or incompatible with
the specific drug he was in possession of.

170 I now address the Ignorance Defence in respect of the Exhibits recovered
from locations later marked as “A”, “C”, “D”, “E” and “F”. The Defence’s case
is that the accused did not know about the nature of the drugs contained in
the Exhibits. In other words, the accused is unable to say what he thought or
believed he was carrying instead of the drugs – he simply did not know.

171 Taken together with the evidence in the Third Long Statement, the
accused’s account becomes a contrived one: if, as I have found, the accused
kept the Exhibits in the Car, it would not be logical that he had no knowledge
as to the nature of the drugs contained in the Exhibits. It is not reasonable
that the accused had kept the Exhibits in the Car but did not form any thought
or belief on what he was carrying into Singapore.

172 For the reasons above at [163]–[171], the accused has failed to rebut the
presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA and the Prosecution’s alternative case on
knowledge succeeds as well.

173 I found admissible the Third Long Statement in which the accused admitted
that he had knowing possession of the Exhibits because he kept them in the
Car. I have also considered the accuracy of the other relevant statements
given by the accused in the course of investigations. Consequently, full
weight must be given to the admissions in the accused’s statements, and the
challenges to the accuracy of the statements lack credibility.

Conviction

174 Given the totality of the evidence, I find that the Prosecution has proven
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had knowingly imported the Exhibits.
Alternatively, for the reasons I set out at [141] and [161]–[172] above, the
Prosecution’s alternative case relying on the presumptions succeeds as well.
For both the Prosecution’s main case and its alternative case, the Defence has
failed to establish the Ignorance Defence on a balance of probabilities.

175 I therefore find the accused guilty of the First, Second and Third
Charges.

Concluding remarks

176 In the course of the proceedings, considerable resources were expended to
clarify how the Exhibits were marked and re-marked during investigations. To
avoid any confusion or substantial re-tracing of steps, it would be prudent
for CNB to standardise the exhibit marking format such that, wherever
possible, there would only be a single marking associated with an exhibit.
