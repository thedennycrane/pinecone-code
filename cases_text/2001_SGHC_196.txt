**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. This was an appeal (in Registrars Appeal No. 56 of 2001) against the
learned Assistant Registrars decision on 28 March 2001 in Suit No. S595 of
2000/H refusing to grant a stay of proceedings on the ground of _forum non
conveniens_. I dismissed the appeal on 17 April 2001 and the defendant has now
appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 600060 of 2001).

_

**The facts**

_

2\. This was a claim by the plaintiff (Yuninshing) against the defendant
(Mondong) for damages of US$530,000 arising from an alleged breach of a
foreign exchange contract.

3\. Both parties are Indonesian nationals; they are also related in that
Mondong is the uncle of Yuninshing. The claim arose out of an oral agreement
reached in a conversation between the parties sometime in June 1999, at the
home of Yuninshings parents in Surabaya, Indonesia. At that time, Yuninshing
desired to buy US dollars to deposit into her Singapore account, while Mondong
wished to convert US dollars in Singapore to Indonesian Rupiahs in his Jakarta
account. It struck them that by entering into a direct exchange agreement,
they would save on the exchange rate in the open forex market.

4\. The arrangement worked well initially and transactions took place between
June 1999 to mid-November 1999 without any problems. During this period,
Yuninshing remitted sums in Indonesian Rupiahs (IR) from her accounts with
Bank Central Asia and Bank Danamon in Surabaya, to Mondongs accounts in the
Jakarta branches of the respective banks. In return, Mondong would usually fax
her a telegraphic transfer application form showing the corresponding
remittance in US dollars into her Singapore account with Republic Central Bank
(RCB) or N M Rothschild & Sons (Rothschilds). Such telegraphic transfers were
done via Thomas Cook Travel Services Pte Ltd (Thomas Cook), HBZ International
Exchange (HBZ), and Christiana Bank, Singapore (Christiana Bank), depending on
which had the most attractive prevailing rate, and also via Dutair & Sea Cargo
Services Pte Ltd (Dutair Singapore), a company controlled by Mondong. On
certain occasions, when Mondong had bank-notes to exchange, cash payments in
US dollars would also be made to Yuninshings representive, Mr Ko Ahok, in
Jakarta.

5\. The subject of Yuninshings claim was the following two sums of monies
which were deposited into Mondongs account:

> (a) IR 2,047,400,000 (equivalent to US$290,000), deposited on 25 November
> 1999; and  
>  (b) IR 1,722,000,000 (equivalent of US$240,000), deposited on 29 November
> 1999.

6\. After these deposits were made, Mondong faxed to Yuninshing two
telegraphic transfer application forms from Thomas Cook indicating the
remittance of the sums into her Rothschilds account. However, the plaintiff
was later informed by Rothschilds and Thomas Cook that no such remittances had
been made. Yuninshing therefore claimed that Mondong had failed to remit to
her account the sum of US$530,000, equivalent to IR 3,769,400,000, which was
the combined total of the two deposits.

7\. Yuninshing filed this claim against Mondong on 7 August 2000. The first
round of proceedings was however largely unfruitful. Mondong entered an
appearance on 25 September 2000 and took out an application for inter alia, a
declaration that the Singapore courts had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.
The application was allowed by the learned Assistant Registrar on 9 January
2001, but the order was subsequently set aside by consent on 30 January 2001
(in Registrars Appeal No. 9 of 2001).

8\. In the second round of proceedings that followed, Mondong sought, inter
alia, a stay of proceedings on the ground that Singapore was not the
appropriate forum to try the matter. The application was heard by the learned
Assistant Registrar on 28 March 2001. She refused to grant a stay on the
ground of _forum non conveniens_ and ordered costs against Mondong. It was
against her decision (which I affirmed) that Mondong lodged the present
appeal.

_

**  
Preliminary Issues**

_

9\. There were three preliminary issues which I took into consideration in
determining this appeal:

> (a) Firstly, Mondong had in the interim commenced legal proceedings in the
> District Court of Surabaya on 19 March 2001 (Register Case Number:
> 141/Pdt.G/2001/PN). In those proceedings, he claimed that he had overpaid
> Yuninshing and that it was the latter who in fact owed him IR 1,250,450,000
> from the series of transactions. The Surabaya action was however quite
> inexplicably revoked upon Mondongs request on 11 April 2001.
>
> (b) Secondly, it was noteworthy that the Surabaya proceedings constituted
> the conclusion of a series of vacillating defences advanced by Mondong.
> These defences were relevant as they indicated the type of evidence required
> in the main action itself.

10\. Initially, Mondong claimed that he had made part payment of US$450,000
out of the US$530,000 in the following manner:

> Date Payment Amount
>
> 25 Nov 99 Cash payment to Mr Ko Ahok US$100,000  
>  30 Nov 99 Cash payment to Mr Ko Ahok US$30,000  
>  30 Nov 99 Deposit into bank US$200,000  
>  02 Dec 99 Deposit into bank US$100,000  
>  02 Dec 99 Deposit into bank US$20,000

11\. He admitted that he had failed to remit the remaining US$80,000 as his
courier was apprehended by the Indonesian Customs authorities and fined as a
result.

12\. Yuninshing however contended that these cash payments and deposits were
in respect of previous remittances and not the present claim in question.
Mondong subsequently revised his position and claimed that due to a
miscalculation, he had actually made full payment of the US$530,000 and that
he had in fact overpaid Yuninshing a nett amount of IR 1,673,950,000 (in his
3rd affidavit affirmed on 29 December 2000, at para 33 ). He later revised
this figure to IR 1,810,450,000 (in his 4th affidavit affirmed on 12 February
2001 para 33). Finally, he adjusted the figure once more to IR 1,250,450,000
(in his 5th affidavit, affirmed on 22 March 2001 at para 77), which was the
amount eventually claimed against Yuninshing in the Surabaya proceedings. In
fact the IR figures which appeared in Mondongs 3rd and 4th affidavits are
incorrect as they are in millions instead of billions.

13\. It was clear from Mondongs affidavits that the crux of the dispute did
not lie with the remittances he received from Yuninshing in Jakarta. The
contested issue is whether he had satisfied his contractual obligation to
remit US dollars back to Yuninshing in Singapore. I also note that Mondong did
no great favour to his credibility by repeatedly miscalculating the quantum of
what was merely six (6) months worth of transactions, which were all in large
lump sum amounts.

14\. The third issue of note is the fact that Mondong has substantial assets
within jurisdiction against which a judgment can be enforced. To this end,
Yuninshing had obtained a Mareva injunction from the High Court on 2 April
2001 preventing Mondong from dissipating his individual and matrimonial assets
in Singapore up to the value of US$600,000, in particular:

> (a) A residential property (held on joint tenancy with his wife Baliati) at
> No. 5 Tanjong Rhu Road, #02-02 Waterside Condominium, Singapore 436002;
>
> (b) A commercial warehouse at 3, Upper Aljunied Link, #01-04, Blk B, Joo
> Seng Warehouse, Singapore 367902; and
>
> (c) Majority shares in Dutair Singapore, held by Mondong and his wife
> Baliati, with an authorised capital of S$150,000 and a paid-up capital of
> S$100,003.

_

  
T**he law**

_

15\. The principles governing a stay on the ground of _forum non conveniens_
are well established; the _locus classicus_ of this area of law is _Spiliada
Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd_ [1987] AC 460. For ease of reference I
lay out the key passage in this case by Lord Goff of Chieveley (at p 476):

> (a) The basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of
> _forum non conveniens_ where the court is satisfied that there is some other
> available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate
> forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more
> suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.
>
> (b) As Lord Kinnears formulation of the principle indicates, in general the
> burden of proof rests on the defendant to persuade the court to exercise its
> discretion to grant a stay Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that there
> is another available forum which is prima facie the appropriate forum for
> the trial of the action, the burden will then shift to the plaintiff to show
> that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires
> that the trial should nevertheless take place in this country."

16._The Spiliada_ has been affirmed and applied locally by our Court of Appeal
in _Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp & Anor v PT Airfast Services Indonesia
& Anor_ [1992] 2 SLR 776, _Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern_ [1995] 3 SLR 97,
_Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd_ [1998] 1 SLR 253, and
most recently in _PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings)
Limited_[2001] 2 SLR 49.

17\. In _PT Hutan_ , Chao Hick Tin JA commented that whether the process
contemplated by Lord Goff in _The Spiliada_ was a two-stage process or a one-
stage process, telescoping two into one, did not really matter, for, as he
explained (at p 55):

> "The ultimate question remains the same: Where should the case be suitably
> tried having regard to the interest of the parties and the ends of justice."

18\. I respectfully agreed and applied the _Spiliada_ test as follows: Had the
defendant satisfied this court that the Indonesian court, having competent
jurisdiction, was the appropriate forum for trial of the action, having regard
to the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice? If so, had the
plaintiff shown that there were any special circumstances why the trial should
nevertheless have taken place before this jurisdiction?

_

**  
The appropriate forum**

(i) The Residence of the Parties

_

19\. Both parties are Indonesian citizens, and Yuninshing herself resides in
Surabaya.

20\. It was unclear where Mondong habitually resides. He purported to reside
at Greenville Block Q, No. 5, Jakarta, Indonesia, and admitted that he was
under police investigations for deception and fraud, which arose when
Yuninshing and other parties lodged complaints against him. As a result, the
Indonesian police had issued a Police Order dated 28 June 2000 requiring him
to report on Mondays and Thursdays to the Directorate of General Offences,
Indonesian Police Intelligence. However, he had stopped reporting to the
Directorate since 11 September 2000 on the grounds that he was ill and
receiving treatment at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore. Consequently, the
Indonesian police had placed him on the wanted list.

21\. Mondong however maintained that he still resided in Indonesia but had
gone into hiding as "_unwanted elements_ " might resort to "_strong arm
tactics_ " if he turned up at the police station. He further alleged that
Yuninshing and her mother wielded substantial influence in Indonesia and might
use force against him to resolve the dispute. To support this claim, he
referred to a letter purportedly written by Yuninshing informing him that "_if
the matter could not be settled immediately, Mama would pay somebody (known to
Mamas Boss) to solve this matter, definitely they would use a force._ " (sic)

22\. Conversely, Yuninshing alleged that Mondong frequently visited Singapore
and had strong family ties here. She alleged that his wife, Baliati, resided
here, his three children were educated here, and that they lived at the
Waterside condominium he owns.

23\. Having considered the evidence, I found that Mondongs account did severe
disservice to his appeal. If he truly lived in fear in Indonesia from both
legitimate as well as illegitimate scrutiny, it seems, quite contrarily, that
it would have been to his personal advantage to have the matter heard in
Singapore. Ironically, it should have been Yuninshing who would express
preference for litigation in Indonesia. Whatever the truth may be as to
Mondongs habitual residency, it is clear to me that as a fugitive in
Indonesia, he would be ill-disposed to enter an appearance in any court of law
within that jurisdiction. Conversely, insofar as he has both residential and
commercial interests in Singapore, as well as freedom of movement within this
jurisdiction, the issue of residency seems to me to weigh more heavily in
favour of this forum.

_

(ii) Witnesses and documentary evidence

_

24\. The crux of the dispute lay in Mondongs alleged failure to perform his
contractual obligation in Singapore. I would reiterate that the methods of
contractual performance by Mondong included:

> (a) Cash payments of US dollars to Mr Ko Ahok in Jakarta; and
>
> (b) Telegraphic transfers from Thomas Cook, HBZ, Christiana Bank and Dutair
> Singapore, to Yuninshings accounts with Republic Central Bank and N M
> Rothschild & Sons in Singapore.

25\. With regard to the cash payments, Yuninshing had represented that Mr Ko
Ahok is an old family friend and would be willing and able to travel to
Singapore to attend as a witness.

26\. In respect of the telegraphic transfers, I likewise found that as
contractual performance was to take place in Singapore, documentary proof
would be easily attainable within this jurisdiction. The relevant institutions
such as Thomas Cook, Rothschild's, as well as Dutair Singapore are located in
Singapore. It is unnecessary, as Mondong submits, to procure Indonesian
witnesses who handled the transactions on the Jakarta end to prove the
remittance. Further, the documents from the above-mentioned financial
institutions in Singapore as well as from Christiana Bank and HBZ, would
likely be in English and in any case, I could not see that translation of bank
statements from Bahasa Indonesia would prove of much difficulty to this court.
Accordingly, I found that with regard to the witnesses and documentary
evidence necessary for the main trial, the balance of convenience clearly lay
with a trial within this jurisdiction.

_

(iii) Illegality

_

27\. Mondong had submitted at various stages of the proceeding that the oral
agreement was illegal under the laws of Indonesia for several reasons, and as
such best dealt with in an Indonesian court. Firstly, he claimed the agreement
was in reality designed to flout currency controls in Indonesia, in that
Mondong was effectively smuggling Yuninshings rupiahs out of Indonesia by
courier to convert into US dollars in Singapore. In support of this contention
Mondong claimed that on one occasion his courier was caught and heavily fined.
Secondly, he alleged that Yuninshing had also entered into the agreement for
the purpose of tax evasion and money laundering.

28\. With regard to currency controls, the law in Indonesia has been helpfully
set out by Minang Warman Sofyan & Associates Law Offices, in a letter
addressed to Yuninshings solicitors dated 23 October 2000 (see exhibit Y8 in
Yuninshings 3rd affidavit filed on 12 March 2001 at p 55). At the material
time, the applicable provisions were Indonesian Government Regulation No. 18
of 1998 dated 17 January 1998, the Decision of the Board of Executive
Directors of Bank Indonesia No. 30/181A/KEP/DIR dated 17 January 1998 and No.
30/217A/KEP/DIR dated 6 March 1998. The combined effect of these provisions
was that the transportation of a sum of between five million to ten million
IRs into or out of Indonesia required the making of a declaration, and the
transportation of a sum in excess of ten million IRs required a permit from
Bank Indonesia.

29\. The present transaction would clearly have been an illegal one if it had
specifically provided for the transporting of rupiahs into or out of Indonesia
without a permit, given the quantum of the sums involved. However, I did not
find that the contract contemplated such a transaction. It is within ordinary
commercial practice to effect a standing foreign exchange arrangement _inter
partes_ in order to save on losses resulting from open market trading.
Furthermore, there is evidence that Yuninshing had performed such transactions
legally via telegraphic transfer when Mondong had no US dollars to exchange
with her. In such circumstances, she had purchased US dollars from
Rothschild's and remitted IRs into the ABN-AMRO Bank in Jakarta. It is highly
unlikely that she would have done so if she had an arrangement with Mondong to
illegally smuggle rupiahs out of Indonesia. Moreover, had Yuninshing been
privy to an illegal contract, it is doubtful that she would have reported
Mondong to the Indonesian authorities for fraud in the first place.

30\. It seemed far more likely to me that Mondong had simply acted on his own
initiative to illegally smuggle rupiahs out of Indonesia. Such action does
not, without more, taint the contract with illegality. A contract capable of
legal fulfilment is not rendered illegal simply because of the nefarious means
by which the promisor chooses to fulfil it.

31\. As for money laundering and tax evasion, I found that the claims made by
Mondong were bare assertions and completely unsupported by evidence.
Accordingly, I found that the issue of illegality was quite simply a red
herring.

_

**  
Special circumstances justifying refusal of stay**

_

32\. Had Mondong been able to convince me that, prima facie, Indonesia was the
more appropriate forum for the hearing of this dispute, there would
nevertheless have existed special circumstances in favour of refusing a stay
of proceedings. The matter had already proceeded to an advanced stage within
this jurisdiction. As of the hearing date, the parties had filed several
affidavits (Yuninshing had filed five and Mondong six). Both parties had also
adduced substantial documentary evidence within their affidavits. The
Statement of Claim and the Defence for the main action had likewise been
filed. In addition, Yuninshing had obtained interim relief in the form of a
Mareva injunction to secure her chances of satisfaction upon judgment.

33\. In contrast, the Surabaya claim had quite inexplicably been retracted by
Mondong on 12 April 2001. Further, in view of Mondongs fugitive status, there
was no indication that there would remain any worthwhile assets in Indonesia
against which a potential judgment could be enforced. Thus, even if Yuninshing
succeeded in a fresh action in Indonesia, she would in all likelihood still
have to apply to our courts to enforce the ruling as a judgment debt, if
indeed by such time there were still assets remaining within this
jurisdiction.

_

**Conclusion**

_

34\. The burden was upon the defendant to persuade this court to exercise its
discretion to grant a stay on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_. As
emphasized by Lord Goff in _The Spiliada_ and our Court of Appeal in _PT
Hutan_ , this is not simply a question of practical convenience, but of
whether the forum is the most appropriate one in the interests of all parties
and the ends of justice. Although the oral agreement was concluded in Surabaya
and remittances by Yuninshing took place in Jakarta, the central issue in
dispute was contractual performance by Mondong in Singapore, that is, the
remittance of US dollars into Yuninshings bank accounts in Singapore. Proof of
this issue would largely be found within this jurisdiction. Further, Mondongs
fugitive status in Indonesia suggested that he was unlikely to enter an
appearance before or place his assets at the disposal of, the Indonesian
courts. Conversely, there was every indication that he had a residential
presence in Singapore and, by his own account, it seemed to be to his personal
advantage to attend court within this jurisdiction. Finally, proceedings in
Singapore were at a very advanced stage, with numerous affidavits filed by
both parties and a Mareva injunction obtained to secure enforcement of a
prospective judgment. It was clear that the interests of the parties and the
ends of justice pointed towards Singapore as the place of adjudication of this
claim.
