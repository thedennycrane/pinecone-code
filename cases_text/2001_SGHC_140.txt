**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. The Plaintiffs, a company registered in Singapore, are shipbuilders. The
Defendants are a French company and the owners of the catamaran "Passion"
("the Passion"), which is the subject of this dispute. On 27 April 1999 the
Plaintiffs entered into an agreement with the Defendants and a third party to
design, build and deliver the Passion for the price of EUR 6,666,600. This
agreement was subsequently amended by the parties and the amended agreement is
hereafter referred to as "the Agreement".

2\. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Plaintiffs furnished the Defendants with a
Banker's Guarantee ("the BG") which provides as follows:

> "In consideration of your entering into the above Shipbuilding Contract with
> MARINTEKNIK SHIPBUILDERS (S) PTE LTD (hereinafter called "the Builder")
> whose registered address is at LEVEL 19, UIC BUILDING NO 5 SHENTON WAY
> SINGAPORE 068808 and office address at 31 TUAS ROAD SINGAPORE 638493, we THE
> DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SINGAPORE LTD, a company incorporated in Singapore and
> having its registered office at 6 Shenton Way DBS Building Singapore 068809,
> hereby irrevocably undertake, as security for the fulfilment of the
> obligations of the Builder under Clauses 10.2(b), 14.7, 15.1 and 19 of the
> Shipbuilding Contract, to pay to you an amount not exceeding EUROPEAN UNION
> EUROS SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY ONLY (EUR666,660-00)
> equal to 10% of the Basic Purchase Price as defined under the Shipbuilding
> Contract ie. EUR6,666,600-00 upon receipt of your first demand in writing
> that the Builder has failed to perform any of its obligations under clauses
> 10.2(b), 14.7, 15.1 and 19 of the Shipbuilding Contract.
>
> Such a demand from you in writing shall be conclusive evidence that such sum
> as stated therein is payable to you under this performance guarantee.
>
> The Guarantee will be subject however to the following:
>
> 1\. Our total liability herein shall not exceed the sum in principal of
> EUROPEAN UNION EUROS SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY ONLY
> (EUR666,660-00); and
>
> 2\. The Guarantee is effective from 25 June 1999 to the earliest of the
> following dates (hereinafter called the "Expiry Date"): - twelve (12) months
> from the date the vessel commences service, - eighteen (18) months from the
> delivery date of the vessel in Singapore, - 15 July 2001 and after the
> aforesaid date, our liability hereunder shall automatically cease and your
> rights hereunder shall be extinguished and this Guarantee shall be null and
> void notwithstanding that the Guarantee is not returned to us for
> cancellation. All demands, if any, must be made in writing and received by
> us at our Banker's Guarantee Section at 6 SHENTON WAY, DBS BUILDING TOWER
> TWO #03-08, SINGAPORE 068809 on or before the Expiry Date.
>
> 3\. The guaranteed amount shall bear interest at 10% per annum from the date
> when the demanded sum is to be paid by us until its actual date of payment;
> provided that the interest sum shall not exceed EUR66,666-00.
>
> 4\. This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
> English Law and is subject to the jurisdiction of the High Courts of
> England.
>
> 5\. This Guarantee is non-assignable."

3\. The Plaintiffs do not dispute that the BG is an on-demand guarantee
subject only to the limitation that it is solely for the purpose of providing
security against breaches of their obligations under clauses 10.2(b), 14.7,
15.1 and 19 of the Agreement as provided in the preamble to the BG. The
Defendants concede that the BG applies only to breaches of those clauses.

4\. On 9 August 2000, the Defendants threatened to make a demand on the BG in
respect of alleged breaches of the Agreement. Fearing that they would carry
out that threat, the Plaintiffs took out this Originating Summons on 11 August
for the following orders:

> "1. An injunction that the Defendants whether acting by themselves, their
> officers, servants or agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever be
> restrained until after a final award in an arbitration between the
> abovenamed parties pursuant to the terms of the Shipbuilding Contract for a
> High Speed Catamaran (Yard No. H162) dated 27 April 1999 (the "Shipbuilding
> Contract") has been made and published to the parties, from doing any of the
> following acts:

> (a) give, furnish or make any written demand pursuant to the Banker's
> Guarantee No. 0016LT0222499 for EUR 666,660.00 (the "guaranteed sum") dated
> 26 June 1999 issued by the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd (the
> "Guarantee") in favour of the 1st Defendants;
>
> (b) claim, collect, obtain, acquire or receive the guaranteed sum or any
> part thereof from the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd, its officers,
> servants or agents or otherwise howsoever;
>
> (c) if they have so received the guaranteed sum or any part thereof, from
> removing out of the jurisdiction or disposing or parting with or dealing
> with, within the jurisdiction such monies paid.

> 2\. A declaration that on the true construction of the Guarantee and in the
> circumstances, the guaranteed sum or any part thereof is payable only on
> proof by the Defendants of the Plaintiffs' default under Clauses 10.2(b),
> 14.7, 15.1 and 19 of the Shipbuilding Contract for a High Speed Catamaran
> (Yard No. H162) dated 27 April 1999 made between the Plaintiffs and the
> Defendants;
>
> 3 The return of all sums that may or have been paid to Defendants by the
> Development Bank of Singapore Ltd under the Guarantee;
>
> 4 Costs;
>
> 5 Interest; and
>
> 6 Such further and other reliefs as this Honourable Court deems fit."

5\. Plaintiffs also applied ex parte for an interim injunction pending final
determination of the OS. On 12 August 2000 Prakash, J granted an interim
injunction subject to the usual undertakings. On 30 March 2001 the Defendants
took out this Summons-in-Chambers to discharge the ex parte injunction. After
hearing counsel for the parties, I discharged the injunction on 1 June 2001 on
the grounds that:

> (i) there was no fraud;
>
> (ii) there was no unconscionability on the part of the Defendants; and
> further
>
> (iii) there was material non-disclosure on the part of the Plaintiffs in
> their application for the ex parte injunction.

Consequently, I ordered the Plaintiffs to pay to the Defendants damages to be
assessed as well as costs. Counsel for the Plaintiffs then applied for a stay
of the discharge order pending an appeal. I granted the stay, subject to the
condition that the Plaintiffs procure adequate extensions of the BG which was
due to expire on 15 June 2001.

6\. is not disputed that the Passion was built and delivered to the agreed
place of delivery, viz. Pointe-a-Pitre in Guadeloupe. The Defendants allege
that the Plaintiffs have breached various terms of the Agreement and their
intention to make a demand under the BG is based on their claims for:

> (i) liquidated damages for late delivery;
>
> (ii) liquidated damages for the failure of the vessel to attain the
> specified speed;
>
> (iii) damages for miscellaneous defects; and
>
> (iv) failure to deliver a fifth engine.

**(i) Late delivery**

7\. There are 2 aspects to the issue of late delivery. Firstly, the parties
had originally agreed on delivery by 30 March 2000, failing which liquidated
damages would be imposed. The Plaintiffs agree that this deadline was not met
and that pursuant to this provision they are liable for the sum of EUR 33,333.
However this only comprises a small part of the total that the Defendants are
claiming under the BG.

8\. The dispute lies in the second aspect of this matter. The new deadline for
delivery was 30 April 2000. Should the Plaintiffs fail to achieve this,
liquidated damages at a rate of 2.5% per month (pro rated daily) would be
payable. The Defendants allege that delivery was effected only on 6 May 2001
and that the liquidated damages for this amounts to EUR 32,876. The Plaintiffs
do not disagree with the arithmetic, but allege that they had complied with
the delivery provision by 30 April 2000.

9\. The Plaintiffs' case is as follows. The delivery provision in the amended
contract, clause 10.2(b), reads as follows:

> "Subject to this Agreement if the Vessel is not completed by the Builder as
> evidenced by the execution by the parties of the Protocol of Completion on
> or before 29 February 2000 at the Port of Delivery, or the Vessel does not
> arrive in Pointe-a-Pitre on or before 30 April 2000, the Operator shall have
> the right to rescind the sale of the Vessel by notice to the Builder and
> upon doing so title to the Vessel shall revert to and revest in the Builder.
> The Builder shall pay to the Purchaser as liquidated damages an amount equal
> to ten percent (10%) of the Basic Purchase Price."

The Plaintiffs say that the Passion arrived at Point-a-Pitre before 20 April
2000 and therefore they had satisfied this provision.

10\. The Defendants contend that delivery was only completed at the earliest
on 6 May. They said that while the Passion may have arrived at Guadeloupe on
23 April, she was not offloaded from the cargo vessel; instead the Plaintiffs'
sub-contractors began work on the required modifications. The Passion was
unloaded on 25 April and the sub-contractors continued with the modification
works. It was not until 5 May that the Plaintiffs requested the Defendants to
sign the Protocol of Completion. The Defendants refused to sign it on various
grounds, some of which are dealt with below. At the hearing before me, they
were prepared to accept that delivery was made on 6 May as they took over the
Passion on that date.

11\. The Plaintiffs point out that the Passion did "arrive" at Pointe-a-Pitre
before 30 April 2000, even if she was not operational by then. The Defendants
contend that this provision required that she be operational by then. This
question is one for the arbitrator to determine but it cannot be said that the
Defendants' position is untenable. This is because the Plaintiffs' position,
taken to the extreme, would mean that so long as all the components of the
Passion are at Pointe-a-Pitre, they are not under any obligation to get her to
be operational by a stipulated date. In my view, it cannot be said that the
Defendants were unreasonable in holding the view that because the Plaintiffs
only requested them to sign the Protocol of Completion on 5 May, liquidated
damages for late delivery is payable up to that date.

**(ii) Failure to attain specified speed**

12\. Clause 15.1 of the Agreement provides as follows:

> "15 PERFORMANCE
>
> 15.1 Speed (a) The Builder hereby warrants that the continuous speed of the
> Vessel shall be 40 knots at 5816 kw corresponding to 100% of maximum
> continuous power with a load of 41.5 tons, in calm weather, wind and sea not
> exceeding Beaufort 3 and 2 respectively, with clean hull.

> > (b) If the actual continuous speed of the Vessel during sea trials varies
> from the guaranteed value of 40 knots, the Basic Purchase Price shall be
> adjusted as follows -

Actual continuous speed Reduction in Speed (knots) Basic Purchase Price
(percent) up to 39.5 knots 0 below 39.5 knots USD 10,000 per 0.1 knot

Should the actual continuous speed as measured on sea trials fall below 37.50
knots the Operator shall have the right to reject the Vessel and terminate
this Agreement."

13\. Sea trials were conducted on 27 and 28 January 2000 at which the Passion
attained a maximum continuous speed of 41.9 knots and an average of 41.35
knots. The Plaintiffs argue that the vessel was therefore in conformity with
clause 15.1(a) and there was no basis for the Defendants' complaint in this
respect.

14\. The Defendants say that the sea trial was defective in that the engines
of the vessel were overloaded to achieve that speed. In support of this, the
Defendants exhibited a letter from the engine supplier which stated that the
engines were overloaded by about 8.3% to 13.9% during the sea trials and
warned that the warranty for those engines would be affected unless corrective
action was taken in respect of the overloading problem. By the time the engine
supplier sent this letter, the vessel was already being transported to Point-
a-Pitre. Therefore a further sea trial in Singapore was impossible.

15\. The Defendants engaged a surveyor to conduct sea trials at Guadeloupe on
26 and 27 June 2000. The surveyor reported a speed of between 37 and 38 knots.
Based on an average of 37.5 knots, the Defendants say that the formula in
clause 15.1(b) entitles them to make a claim for US$250,000 which is
equivalent to approximately EUR285,000.

16\. The Plaintiffs allege that this sea trial was not done in their presence
as required under the Agreement. This is not disputed by the Defendants.
However this does not detract from the fact that there is a claim by the
Defendants against the Plaintiffs in respect of the speed performance of the
Passion. It would be necessary for the arbitrator determine whether the
Plaintiffs have satisfied this provision. Whether this is done by a further
sea trial or by some other means would be a matter for the arbitrator to
decide. For the present, the Defendants have this claim, and so far as they
have been capable of determining it, the Passion could only reach 37.5 knots
and their claim rested on that basis. I cannot see anything unreasonable in
that position.

**(iii) Miscellaneous defects**

17\. The Defendants alleged that there were various defects to the Passion
that were not rectified by the time they took over the vessel and that they
either had repaired or would have to do so. However at the hearing before me
the Defendants had not provided any quantification of these repair costs.
Therefore I would have to disregard them in relation to this application.

**(iv) Fifth engine**

18\. The Passion was designed as a vessel with 4 engines. However the
Agreement, as modified, obliges the Plaintiffs to supply a fifth engine which
is to be used as a spare. This obligation is not denied by the Plaintiffs.
Neither do they deny that the Passion was supplied without the fifth engine.
However the Plaintiffs raised issues as to whether they were liable to the
Defendants for this engine rather than to a third party. The Plaintiffs also
submit that the BG states that it is for the purposes of securing their
obligations pursuant to clauses 10.2(b), 14.7, 15.1 and 19 of the Agreement
and only to those clauses. Therefore even if they were in breach of their
obligations to supply the fifth engine, this was outside the scope of the BG.

19\. The Defendants contend that this breach did fall within one of those
provisions, namely clause 10.2(b) which is set out in paragraph 9 above. This
relates to the completion or arrival of the "Vessel". The Defendants say that
the Passion was not in conformity with the specifications and therefore did
not fall within the definition of "Vessel" in the Agreement. That term is
defined in clause 1.1 as meaning (emphasis added):

> " a 43 metre Catamaran vessel with all its components which is the subject
> of this Agreement having the Yard Number H162 allocated to it by the Builder
> to be, or being constructed, awaiting delivery or delivered as the case may
> be."

Thus, the Defendants argue, if the Passion did not have all its components,
she was not the "Vessel" as defined. The term "components" is defined in the
same clause as meaning:

> " everything which forms or is intended to form part of the Vessel or to be
> placed in or on the Vessel and, without limiting the generality of the
> foregoing, includes the hull, engines, machinery, appliances, appurtenances,
> equipment, gear, fittings, furniture and stores;"

Since she did not have the fifth engine which is one of the "components" of
the "Vessel", it would follow that the Passion was not the "Vessel" as defined
in the Agreement. Therefore the Plaintiffs were in breach of their delivery
obligation under clause 10.2(b).

20\. Although the Defendants' argument appears to be a technical one,
nevertheless it is not untenable and one which ought to be dealt with by the
arbitrator. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Defendants' claim in this
respect is perfectly reasonable. It is for a sum of EUR 278,000 and the
Plaintiffs do not deny that this is the price of an engine.

**Unconscionability and fraud**

21\. The Defendants' claims appear to be entirely reasonable. In any event,
there is clearly no fraud. The only question is whether it is unconscionable
for them to make the demand. In Eltraco International Pte Ltd v CGH
Development Pte Ltd [2000] 4 SLR 290 the Court of Appeal stated that in
considering unconscionability, the entire picture must be viewed, taking into
account all the relevant factors. In the matter before them the court found
that it was not unconscionable for a beneficiary to make a call on a demand
bond where there was a genuine dispute between the parties on liability. The
court said at para 32:

> "32. At the time the respondents called on the bond on 18 February 2000, the
> appellants had clearly not rectified all the defects listed in the November
> 2000 schedule. The earlier joint inspection of 2 February 2000 is evidence
> of that. Furthermore, the appellants also disputed that they were liable for
> all the defects. Quite clearly, there were genuine disputes between the
> parties - both as to the extent of the defect liability and the cost of the
> rectification works. In the circumstances, the learned judge was entitled to
> find that as regards both matters, the extent of the defect liability and
> the cost for rectifying the same, were unclear to him. In the light of the
> foregoing, we do not see how the call on the bond by the respondents can be
> termed to be abusive. The respondents are entitled to protect their own
> interest. In our opinion, there is nothing improper on the part of the
> respondents in calling on the bond. The defendants` concern was further
> aggravated by the fact that there was some evidence then that the appellants
> were in financial difficulties."

22\. In the present case, the BG was issued for the purpose of providing
"security for the fulfilment of the obligations" of the Plaintiffs under the
Agreement. It is an undertaking by the bank to pay upon receipt of the
Defendants' written demand. It is an ordinary on-demand bond clearly intended
to entitle the Defendants the right to receive such sum from the bank as they,
in their bona fide view, determine that the Plaintiffs are liable to them
under the relevant provisions of the Agreement. A demand made by the
Plaintiffs on the grounds described above would fall within what is
contemplated in the Agreement. In those circumstances, I cannot see how such a
demand would be unconscionable as would move the court to continue the
injunction. Accordingly I discharged it.

**Material non-disclosure**

23\. The Defendants also point out that the Plaintiffs had, in their
application for the ex parte injunction, failed to make full and frank
disclosure of all material facts. They submit that the nature of the non-
disclosure of itself justifies discharging the injunction.

24\. The ex parte application was supported by an affidavit filed by Priscilla
Lim, a director of the Plaintiffs. After citing the relevant provisions of the
Agreement, Lim said in paragraph 9 that: "9. The Plaintiffs delivered the
Vessel to the Port of Final Delivery on 23 April 2000. The Defendants,
however, wrongfully refused to take delivery of the Vessel until 5 May 2000
and wrongfully refused to sign the Protocol of Transit."

Lim then continued by saying that the Defendants unilaterally declared that
the Vessel only arrived on 15 May 2000 and claimed liquidated damages on that
basis. No mention was made of the basis of the Defendants' claim as I had set
out above, i.e. that the Passion was not unloaded from the carrier vessel
until 25 April, that the Plaintiffs' sub-contractors were working on her
thereafter and that it was not until 5 May that the Plaintiffs requested the
Defendants to sign the Protocol of Completion. The impression given by Lim is
that the Defendants had absolutely no basis for their claim of late delivery
and therefore their behaviour was fraudulent.

25\. The affidavit then turns to the Defendants' claim in relation to the
speed of the vessel. Lim said that it was made fraudulently because:

> (i) sea trials conducted jointly in Singapore recorded a speed of 41.7 knots
> which was above the 40 knots specified;
>
> (ii) the Defendants' allegation that the Vessel was not up to speed was
> based on sea trials conducted by them in the absence of the Plaintiffs'
> representatives;
>
> (iii) the conditions of the Defendants' unilateral sea trials were suspect
> because the weather conditions were not recorded; and
>
> (iv) the modification works carried out would at most have reduced the speed
> by 0.5 to 1.0 knots.

26\. Lim thus gave the impression that a proper sea trial had been done in
Singapore and that it was witnessed by both parties. At that sea trial the
Passion had recorded a speed of 41.7 knots, well in excess of the specified
speed of 40 knots. Therefore it was fraudulent of the Defendants to go on to
conduct a further speed trial under spurious conditions in which the
Plaintiffs' representatives were not present and then claim that the Passion
did not attain the speed specified. Lim did not disclose in her affidavit that
the sea trial in Singapore was unacceptable because the engines were
overloaded when the speeds of 41.7 knots was achieved.

27\. A party applying ex parte for an injunction on an urgent basis owes a
duty to the court to set out all the relevant facts, in particular any
possible defence that would weaken his case for an injunction. But even if
there has been material non-disclosure, the court nevertheless has the
discretion to continue an injunction if the justice of the case requires it:
see Dauphin Offshore Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH
Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan [2000] 1 SLR 657 at para 48. In
the present case, not only did Lim fail to disclose those matters which she
was aware of and highlight the relevant correspondence in her affidavit, she
had gone out of the way to paint a wholly different picture in order to attach
fraud on the Defendants and in so doing had misled the court. The Plaintiffs
had presented such a distorted view of the facts that to ignore their non-
disclosure would be to reward such behaviour and encourage similar acts by
other parties. Therefore, on this basis alone, the injunction ought to be
discharged.

**English law**

28\. The foregoing are sufficient grounds for my decision to discharge the
injunction. However in the course of writing this judgment, I discovered an
interesting point which deserves ventilation.

29\. Both the Agreement and BG are expressed to be governed by English law. It
was held in New Civilbuild Pte Ltd v Guobena Snd Bhd [1999] 1 SLR 374 that
there was no concept of unconscionability in English law in relation to on-
demand bonds and that fraud was the sole exception. The court went on to find
that the Court of Appeal in Bocotra Construction Pte Ltd v A-G (No 2) [1995] 2
SLR 733 did not rule otherwise, notwithstanding that the term
unconscionability was used in that judgment. However in GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack
Building Construction Pte Ltd [1999] 4 SLR 604 the Court of Appeal disagreed
with that view and held that the court in Bocotra had made a conscious
departure from English law in that unconscionability was another exception
under Singapore law. The court held (at para 16):

> "It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the court expressly held that
> `fraud or unconscionability` was a ground on which the court would interfere
> and restrain the enforcement of a performance bond. It is significant that
> in that judgment the court on no less than three occasions referred
> consistently to `fraud or unconscionability` as a ground for the grant of an
> injunction. We should add that the concept of `unconscionability` was
> adopted after deliberation, and was not inadvertently inserted as a result
> of a slip; nor was it intended to be used synonymously or interchangeably
> with `fraud`. There is nothing in that judgment which can be said to
> indicate or suggest that the court did not decide that `unconscionability`
> alone is not a separate ground as distinct from fraud. We accept that to
> that extent, Bocotra is a departure, and if we may respectfully say so, a
> conscious departure, from the English position."

30\. This position is reinforced in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal
in Eltraco International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd [2000] 4 SLR 290.
In that judgment, the court referred to the English decision of Cargill
International SA & Anor v Bangladesh Sugar & Food Industries Corp [1996] 4 All
ER 563 and observed as follows (at para 38):

> "38 There is one other observation on Cargill International which we should
> make. If the fact situation in that case were to recur in a Singapore case,
> the court here might well have issued a restraint on the call since
> unconscionability is a ground on which a Singapore court would grant
> restraint, unlike the position in England."

31\. As unconscionability is not an exception in English law, there is the
question as to whether the Plaintiffs may rely upon this ground in addition to
fraud because the relevant contracts, i.e. the Agreement and the BG, are
governed by English law. However this issue is not necessary for my decision
and I did not have the benefit of submissions from counsel. Therefore I will
be content to merely raise it here and leave this question to be decided
elsewhere.
