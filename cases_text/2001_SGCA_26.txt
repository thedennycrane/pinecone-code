death of Kheng. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal
([1993] 3 SLR 148) and finally by the Privy Council ([1996] 2 SLR 297).

The issue in the present appeal concerns only the one lot of 27 Overseas Union
Bank (OUB) shares. At the trial of the consolidated action, it was
established, that all the movable properties (including stocks and shares) in
Singapore belonging to the Kongsi were registered in the name of Nam.

However, on 30 April 1962, Nam purported to give the 27 shares to Tng as a
gift by way of transfer. Following the transfer, Tng had taken up and paid for
the rights issues originating from the 27 shares. OUB had also issued bonus
shares. Through the splitting of the par value of each share from $100 to $1,
and through the declaration of bonus shares and rights issue over the years,
the 27 shares had become 125,564 shares, each of $1 par value.

Based on the intention on the part of Nam to give Tng the 27 shares, Tng
advanced the argument that the appropriate portion of the 27 shares which
beneficially belonged to Nam (by virtue of his 8/21 shareholding in the Kongsi
and a share in STTCK) should be treated as having been given to Tng.

In April 1999, Tng and Woon, in their capacity as the executors and trustees
of Nam, instituted an Originating Summons to seek the court's determination of
two questions: (a) the rights of the parties with respect to the gift of the
27 shares from Nam to on 30 April 1962 and more particularly the portion of
the gift that Nam held a beneficial interest through the Kongsi and STTCK (the
gift question); (b) whether Tng is entitled to an indemnity and/or
contribution in respect of all costs and expenses incurred by him pertaining
to the 27 shares from the estate of Nam (the reimbursement question).

The defendant was Tng, in his personal capacity. Three beneficiaries of the
estate of Nam intervened in the proceedings, and objected to the application
on the ground that it amounts to an abuse of the process of court as the
issues had already been decided upon by the High Court in the consolidated
action. As the High Court had ordered that the executors and trustees of the
estate of Nam restore, inter alia, the 27 shares back to the Kongsi, the three
interveners submitted that the doctrine of _res judicata_ should apply to
restrain this re-litigation. For this Originating Summons, the High Court
agreed that the doctrine of _res judicata_ in the wider sense applied in the
circumstances and ruled that Tng was precluded from re-litigating the issues
sought.

Tng appealed, in his personal capacity, that in relation to the gift question
two issues be addressed: (a) whether the gift from Nam to Tng of the 27
shares, which belonged to the Kongsi, were effective to convey to Tng the
portion of those 27 shares owned by Nam through his interest in the Kongsi;
and (b) whether the transfer of the 27 shares by Nam to Tng raises the
presumption of advancement.

As to costs, the interveners, in their case, challenged that the High Court
was wrong in not granting costs to Tng and Woon in their representative
capacity. The interveners contended that, the costs of Tng and Woon in their
representative capacity, should be paid by Tng personally as the proceeding
was brought by Tng pursuant to his personal interest. Further, the effect of
the order that there be no order on costs in favour of Tng and Woon in their
representative capacity would mean that such costs would have to be borne
ultimately by the beneficiaries of the estate. However, the interveners did
not file any notice of appeal against such order of costs, and merely stated
their challenges in their Case and submission.

Per curiam

_**

In the context of husband and wife, the current approach is to treat the
presumption of advancement as an evidential instrument of last resort where
there is no direct evidence as to the intention of the parties, rather than as
an oft-applied rule of the thumb. However, the court left open the question of
whether the presumption of advancement in the context of father and son has
similarly been weakened, and thus is readily rebutted by comparatively slight
evidence (see 36-37 ) _Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew_ [1999] 4 SLR 560, _Pettitt
v Pettitt_[1970] AC 777 followed, _Shephard v Cartwright_ [1955] AC 431 and

Legislation referred to

Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) s 34(2)(b)

**JUDGMENT:**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. This is an appeal by the plaintiff (Tng) against a decision of Amerjeet
Singh JC, dismissing the plaintiffs claim in relation to a lot of 27 Overseas
Union Bank (OUB) shares, hereinafter referred to as "the 27 shares". The
learned judge was of the view that the plaintiff was barred from bringing the
present Originating Summons (OS) on the ground of _res judicata_ in the wider
sense.

2\. The circumstances giving rise to the plea of _res judicata_ are primarily
based on a judgment (unreported) given by the High Court in the consolidated
action (S 1401/73 and S 2457/81), which judgment was upheld on appeal by this
Court ([1993] 3 SLR 148) and finally by the Privy Council ([1996] 2 SLR 297).

**

Essential facts

**

3\. In order to better appreciate the issues in the present proceeding, there
is a need to set out in brief the essential facts relating to the earlier
consolidated action. The story began at the end of the nineteen century when
three brothers, Lee Wee Kheng (Kheng), Lee Wee Nam (Nam) and Lee Wee Kiat
(Kiat) left their village in Canton, China to seek their fortune here. Their
father, Lee Hum Chye, came to Singapore in 1917 and in the following year he
gave his savings to the three sons and also set up a family fund called "Sze
Teck Tng Chye Kee" (STTCK). Lee Hum Chye died shortly thereafter. The
businesses of the three sons prospered. In 1927, Kheng, Nam and Kiat decided
to pool their resources and established a partnership, Wee Kee Kongsi (the
Kongsi). STTCK was given a share in the Kongsi. Later in the same year, Kiat
died. The business of the Kongsi continued to prosper. In October 1940, the
estate of Kiat relinguished its interest in the Kongsi by way of a deed of
release. After the death of Kiat, the shares in the Kongsi were redistributed
in the following proportions:-

> Kheng 9/21
>
> Nam 8/21
>
> STTCK 4/21

We should add that even after the deed of release, his estate was treated as
having an equal share in STTCK, as the deed did not relate to anything due to
Kiat under STTCK. However, for the purposes of the present proceeding, nothing
on that is pertinent.

4\. In February 1950, Kheng and Nam incorporated a company, Lee Brothers (Wee
Kee) Ltd (Lee Brothers). All the immovable properties of the Kongsi and STTCK
were transferred to Lee Brothers.

5\. In July 1962, Kheng died. In his Will, he appointed his two sons, Lee Hiok
Kher (Kher) and Lee Hiok Hwee (Hwee) as his executors. We should add that long
before he died, Kheng spent much of his time in Bangkok. The businesses in
Singapore of the Kongsi, as well as those of Lee Brothers, were managed by
Nam.

6\. After the death of Kheng, the businesses of the Kongsi and Lee Brothers
continued as before. In January 1964, Nam died, having appointed his two sons,
Lee Hiok Tng (Tng) and Lee Hiok Woon (Woon) as his executors.

7\. Neither Nam, before his death, nor his executors, after his death,
rendered any account to the executors and trustees of Kheng in relation to the
assets of the Kongsi. However, it is clear that in law, upon the death of
Kheng, the partnership in the Kongsi was dissolved. The surviving partner or
partners should wind up the affairs of the partnership and distribute its
assets to those who were entitled thereto. Indeed, the records would show that
Nams executors and trustees were not even helpful towards Khengs executors and
trustees, who were then seeking to ascertain the assets of the Kongsi.

8\. As a result, two actions (S 1401/73 and S 2457/81) were commenced by some
of the beneficiaries of the Kheng estate (sons and grandsons of Kheng
hereinafter referred to as the "S & G of Kheng") against the executors and
trustees of the Kheng estate as well as of the Nam estate. Eventually, both
the actions were consolidated and tried together.

9\. In the consolidated action, the S & G of Kheng sued Tng and Woon as the
executors and trustees of the estate of Nam for breaches of trust committed by
Nam after the death of Kheng in, inter alia, failing to wind up the
partnership business, and in failing to give an account of the partnership
business to the estate of Kheng. The S & G of Kheng also sued Kwee and Kher as
the executors and trustees of the Kheng estate for failing to get in the
assets belonging to the Kheng estate. During the course of the trial of the
consolidated action, the plaintiffs and the executors and trustees of the
estate of Kheng reached a settlement and, accordingly, no further reliefs were
sought against the executors and trustees of Kheng. So what remained of the
consolidated action for which the High Court had to decide were, in the main,

> (i) whether Nam had acted in breach of trust upon the death of Kheng, in
> respect of the partnership assets; and whether upon the death of Nam, the
> latters executors and trustees had similarly acted in breach of trust;
>
> (ii) whether the executors and trustees of the Nam estate were liable to
> restore to the Kongsi certain specified shares, including 12,240 OCBC
> shares, three lots of 125, 27 and 125 shares in OUB (at $100 par value each)
> and 378,000 UOB shares (hereinafter referred to collectively as the
> "undisclosed shares").

10\. We should add that in the consolidated action, the estate of Kheng had
also made a counterclaim against the estate of Nam relating to the undisclosed
shares.

11\. In the course of the trial of the consolidated action, the estate of Nam
conceded that the 378,000 UOB shares and one of the two 125 lots of OUB shares
belonged to the Kongsi. As regards the other three lots of undisclosed shares,
the High Court in a judgment delivered in January 1992 (the 1992 judgment)
held that they belonged to the Kongsi and the estate of Nam must account for
the same. The court also held that Nam, as well as his executors and trustees,
had committed breaches of trust and ordered that an account be taken of the
assets of the Kongsi in respect of the period after the death of Kheng.

**

Issues in the present action

**

12\. The issues in the present OS concerns only the one lot of 27 OUB shares.
At the trial of the consolidated action, it was established, and also not
disputed, that all the movable properties (including stocks and shares) in
Singapore belonging to the Kongsi were registered in the name of Nam. It would
appear that on 30 April 1962, Nam purported to give the 27 shares to Tng as a
gift by way of transfer. However, by virtue of the 1992 judgment, the
executors and trustees of Nam had to restore those 27 shares to the Kongsi.
Nevertheless, based on the intention on the part of Nam to give Tng the 27
shares, Tng advanced the argument that the appropriate portion of the 27
shares which beneficially belonged to Nam (by virtue of his 8/21 shareholding
in the Kongsi and a share in STTCK) should be treated as having been given to
Tng. Therefore, in April 1999, Tng and Woon, in their capacity as the
executors/trustees of Nam, instituted the present OS to seek the court's
determination of the following two questions:-

> 1\. The determination of the rights of the parties with respect to the gift
> of the 27 Overseas Union Bank ("OUB") shares from Lee Wee Nam to Lee Hiok
> Tng on or about 30th April 1962 and more particularly the portion of the
> gift that Lee Wee Nam held a beneficial interest through Wee Kee Kongsi and
> Sze Teck Tng Chye Kee.
>
> 2\. That it may be determined whether Lee Hiok Tng is entitled to an
> indemnity and/or contribution in respect of all costs and expenses incurred
> by him pertaining to the said 27 OUB shares from the Estate of Lee Wee Nam.

The defendant to the OS is Tng, in his personal capacity. For ease of
reference, prayer 1 will be referred to as "the gift question" and prayer 2
"the reimbursement question".

13\. Subsequently, in February 2000, Lee Siew Choon (Choon), Lee Siew Hong
(Hong) and Lee Siew Ngung (Ngung), three beneficiaries of the Nam estate
(hereinafter collectively referred to as CHN) applied to intervene in the
proceeding. They objected to the application made by Nams executors and
trustees on the ground that the application amounts to an abuse of the process
of court as the issues had already been decided upon by the High Court in the
consolidated action.

14\. As presented by counsel for Tng to the court below, the court needed to
address and decide on the following issues on the gift question:-

> (i) whether the gift from Nam to Tng of the 27 shares, which belonged to the
> Kongsi, were effective to convey to Tng the portion of those 27 shares owned
> by Nam through his interest in the Kongsi.
>
> (ii) whether the transfer of the 27 shares by Nam to Tng raises the
> presumption of advancement.

15\. In an affidavit, filed in his personal capacity, Tng deposed that his
father, Nam, transferred the 27 shares to him as a gift and that his offer to
pay his father for the 27 shares was declined. He said he believed his father
gave him those shares as an expression of his appreciation for all the
assistance rendered by Tng to his fathers business in the previous thirty
years. Following the transfer to him of those shares, Tng had taken up and
paid for the rights issues originating from the 27 shares. OUB had also issued
bonus shares. It would appear that the original 27 shares, through the
splitting of the par value of each share from $100 to $1, and through the
declaration of bonus shares and rights issue over the years, had become
125,564 shares, each of $1 par value.

16\. On the other hand, CHN argued, inter alia, that by virtue of the High
Court decision in the consolidated action declaring that the 27 shares
belonged to the Kongsi, Nam was holding those shares in trust for the Kongsi.
CHN also pointed out that while in the consolidated action, Tng did file a
defence, he failed to turn up and testify to claim for the 27 shares.
Similarly, Woon too, did not elect to testify at that trial. In any event, any
purported transfer of the 27 shares would have been in breach of trust. In the
light of the courts order that the executors and trustees of the Nam estate
restore, inter alia, the 27 shares back to the Kongsi, CHN submitted that the
principle of _res judicata_ or estoppel should apply to restrain this re-
litigation.

**

Decision below

**

17\. The judge below agreed with CHN and ruled that Tng was precluded from re-
litigating the issues sought in the OS. He said (though at times without
clearly separating Tngs personal capacity from his representative capacity):-

> "Having considered the Affidavit evidence and all the submissions and the
> Counsel of the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs having conceded by agreeing that the
> 27 OUB shares formed part of the assets of Wee Kee Kongsi and the 1st and
> 2nd Plaintiffs having accepted the decision of Chao J on the issue of the
> ownership of the 27 OUB shares, there was no doubt in my mind that the
> Defendant (in his personal capacity but the alter ego of the 1st Plaintiff)
> was attempting to re-litigate the matter to the entitlement of the 27 OUB
> shares. The Defendant had failed to pursue his claim in the trial before
> Chao J after filing his defence by testifying and subjecting himself to
> cross-examination concerning his claim or claims which Plaintiffs Counsel
> was now articulating."

18\. After referring to the reasons given by the High Court, the Court of
Appeal and the Privy Council in the consolidated action on why the 27 shares
belonged to the Kongsi, the judge below concluded (at 18):-

> "In my opinion therefore, the Defendant could not reassert his claim to the
> 27 OUB shares to say that the several issues defined by the 1st and 2nd
> Plaintiffs Counsel as set out earlier had not arisen in the Consolidated
> Suit and claim that there was as such no re-litigation of the issues here.
> The truth is the 1st Plaintiff (the Defendant) and the 2nd Plaintiff could
> and should have raised the issue there as they were Defendants to the Suit.
> They chose not to. The judgment of Chao J upheld by the Court of Appeal and
> the Privy Council touching on the issue of the 27 OUB shares therefore
> operated both as an estoppel by record and as an issue estoppel against the
> Defendant. Such judgment prevented both the 1st Plaintiff who is also the
> Defendant and the 2nd Plaintiff from denying or re-agitating the facts on
> which it is based. The only exception when a judgment does not operate as
> such is when it is obtained by fraud or collusion which is plainly not the
> case here. The proceeding by the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs and the claim by the
> Defendant was an abuse of the process of court."

19\. The judge held that as the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi as a
composite whole, there was no question of the lot of shares being split up
although Nams estate would, in accordance with the partnership agreement, get
8/21 share of the 27 shares and Tngs interest in the said share was only in
his capacity as one of the beneficiaries of Nams estate.

20\. As for the alternative remedy which Tng sought for reimbursement on the
ground that he had expended money to take up rights issues in the belief that
the 27 shares were a gift to him and with no knowledge that the gift was in
breach of trust, the court nevertheless held that that application must also
fail. The judge felt that Tng and Woon, having failed to explain the position
in the consolidated action, were bound by the decision in that action.

**_

Res judicata

_**

21\. The main question that arises for consideration in this appeal is whether
the doctrine of _res judicata_ in the wider sense applied in the circumstances
of this case.

22\. The _locus classicus_ on _res judicata_ in the wider sense may be found
in the speech of Wigram V-C in _Henderson v Henderson_ [1843] All ER 378 where
he expounded the following principles:-

> where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of
> adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the
> parties to that litigation to _bring forward their whole case_ , and will
> not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the
> same subject of litigation in respect of matters which _might have been
> brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought
> forward,_ only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even
> accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of _res judicata_ applies,
> except in special cases, _not only to points upon which the court was
> actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a
> judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of
> litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might
> have brought forward at the time_. (Emphasis added).

23\. In _Talbot v Berkshire County Council_ [1994] QB 290 at 296 Stuart-Smith
LJ clarified the two situations where _res judicata_ arises as follows:-

> The first relates to those points which were actually decided by the court;
> this is _res judicata_ in the strict sense. Secondly, those which might have
> been brought forward at the time, but were not. The second is not a true
> case of _res judicata_ but rather is founded upon the principle of public
> policy in preventing multiplicity of actions, it being in the public
> interest that there should be an end to litigation; the court will stay or
> strike out the subsequent action as an abuse of process.

24\. The two senses of _res judicata_ expounded by Wigram V-C was accepted by
the Privy Council in the Hong Kong case _Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng
Bank Ltd & Anor_ [1975] AC 581 and by this court in _Ng Chee Chong v Toh Kouw_
[1999] 4 SLR 45 and _Ching Mun Fong v Liu Cho Chit_ [2000] 1 SLR 51. In _Yat
Tung Investment_ , Lord Kilbrandon in referring to the extended sense of _res
judicata_ , adopted very much the same language as that of Wigram V-C:-

> where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of
> adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the
> parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not
> (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the
> same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been
> brought forward as part of the subject in contest ."

25\. It is clear that the true basis for the extended sense of the doctrine of
_res judicata_ is to be found in the concept of abuse of process of the court.
It is not in the public interest that in relation to a single matter there
could be multiplicity of proceedings. In _Ching Mun Fong_ , this Court
endorsed the following passage of Somervell LJ in _Greenhalgh v Mallard_
[1947] 2 All ER 255 at 257:-

_

> res judicata

_ for this purpose is not confined to the issues which the court is actually
asked to decide, but it covers issues or facts which are so clearly part of
the subject matter of the litigation and so clearly could have been raised
that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new
proceeding to be started in respect of them.

26\. But in determining whether a case falls within the scope of _res
judicata_ in the extended sense, this Court in _Ng Chee Chong_ noted that
great care should be exercised as it would amount to shutting out a subject of
litigation. There, this court relied in particular, the following sentiments
of Gibson J in _Lawlor v Gray_ [1984] 3 All ER 345 at 352.

> The words of the Vice Chancellor (in _Henderson v Henderson_) ought not to
> be treated like the words of a statute and no doubt it is right to construe
> them in a non-technical common sense way. But it should always be borne in
> mind that what is sought by the party claiming the estoppel is the shutting
> out of a matter not previously pronounced on expressly in the earlier
> litigation from the determination of the court.

27\. Before us, Tng made it clear at the outset that by raising the gift
question in the OS he is not seeking to go behind the 1992 judgment, which was
upheld by this Court and the Privy Council. He emphasised that what was
basically decided in the 1992 judgment related to certain assets of the
Kongsi, and, in the process, the court had to determine whether Nam, and later
his executors and trustees, had committed breaches of trust. The true object
of the consolidated action was to determine the extent of the assets of the
Kongsi. Having decided that, the court had to make a number of consequential
orders.

28\. One of the essential conditions, which must be satisfied before _res
judicata_ can arise is that there should be identity of parties. It would be
clear from the background given above that there were three sets of parties in
the consolidated action. First, there were the S & G of Kheng, beneficiaries
under the Kheng estate, who instituted the two actions which were
consolidated. Second, there were Tng and Woon, both being sued in their
representatives, as well as in their personal, capacities. Third, there were
Kwee and Kher also being sued in both their representative and personal
capacities. Though originally the S & G of Kheng had sued Kwee and Kher for
failing in their duties as executors/trustees of the Kheng estate, by the time
the trial of the consolidated action came on, the two sides had resolved their
differences and the S & G of Kheng had abandoned their claim against Kwee and
Kher. Thereafter, they stood on the same side as Kwee and Kher, who were
parties to the action, both in their representative as well as their personal
capacities. The battle lines drawn was between the Kheng estate on the one
side and the Nam estate on the other.

29\. In the instant OS, the plaintiffs are Tng and Woon in their capacity as
executors and trustees of the Nam estate. The defendant is Tng in his personal
capacity. The interveners, CHN, are the beneficiaries under the Nam estate.
While CHN were not parties to the consolidated action, Tng and Woon, in their
representative capacity, were. As CHN claim their interest through Tng and
Woon in their representative capacity, CHN will be deemed to be privy to the
consolidated action. Thus, the condition of identity of parties is fulfilled.

30\. We now turn to consider whether the condition relating to the identity of
subject matter is satisfied in this case. There can be no doubt that _res
judicata_ in the strict sense cannot apply. The question is whether _res
judicata_ in the extended sense could. The issues which Tng now in his
personal capacity wishes to put before the court were clearly not before the
court in the consolidated action. The only question that remains is whether
these issues can be considered to be issues which "belonged to the subject of
litigation" in the consolidated action. We would reiterate that the primary
issue in the consolidated action was in determining whether certain shares,
including the 27 shares, belonged to the Kongsi or to Nam personally. In
passing, we would add that the court there had also decided the question
relating to the scope of a particular settlement reached between the S & P of
Kheng and the Nam estate. However, this aspect of the decision has no bearing
whatsoever to the present OS.

31\. To determine whether _res judicata_ in the extended sense applies to this
OS, there is a need to consider the two questions raised therein, the gift
question and the reimbursement question, separately, as the answers to both
may not be the same. We shall first deal only with the gift question. Does
that question, as now formulated by Tng, falls within "the subject of
litigation" in the consolidated action? In our opinion, the answer is a clear
negative. The gift question would concern only the beneficiaries of the Nam
estate. It would not be appropriate to raise it in the consolidated action.
Indeed the gift question would only arise if the court, as it did, ruled that
the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi rather than to Nam personally. In our
judgment, it would not facilitate the orderly disposal of the consolidated
action if the gift question was raised then. It would be premature. There is
no question of multiplicity of action by allowing Tng to raise the gift
question at this stage.

32\. In the result we hold that _res judicata_ in the wider sense has no
application to estop Tng from raising the gift question.

**

Gift question on merits

**

33\. We now turn to consider the gift question on its merits. This can be
disposed of fairly briefly. Tng contends that when his father Nam transferred
the 27 shares to him, Nam intended that transfer as a gift. Nam refused his
payment for those shares. Tng said that although there was no written document
under the hand of Nam evidencing that intention, it was clear from all the
background circumstances.

34\. Even if we assume that what Tng now asserts is true, that Nam intended
the transfer as a gift, we still do not see how it could help Tngs claim.
Obviously when Nam transferred the 27 shares to Tng, Nam was under the
impression that the 27 shares were his beneficially. With the 1992 judgment
declaring that the 27 shares did not belong to Nam but to the Kongsi, and that
Nam acted in breach of trust when he transferred the 27 shares to Tng, the 27
shares were not Nams to give. Indeed, the 1992 judgment declared that the 27
shares should be restored to the Kongsi. The purported gift to Tng accordingly
failed. In a portion of Tngs Case, he seemed to be asking this Court to uphold
his claim that the whole of 27 shares were a valid gift to him. We are unable
to see how that contention could be made when the 27 shares did not even
belong to Nam.

35\. It seems to us that what Tng now seeks to argue is that although Nam
could not give to Tng all the 27 shares, but as Nam was the beneficial owner
of some of the 27 shares (by virtue of 8/21 share in the Kongsi and indirectly
through STTCK), Nam must have also intended to give to Tng that portion of the
27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam in line with Nams share in the
Kongsi. What Tng wants us to rule is that even though Nam was in no position
to give away the 27 shares to Tng as they belonged to the Kongsi, we could
construe from such a purported gift of the 27 shares that there must have been
an intention on the part of Nam to give to Tng that part of the 27 shares
which beneficially belonged to Nam. We do not think it would be justified at
all to make such an inference. As we view it, the two intentions are not
consistent. As it was Nams intention to give away all the 27 shares, one
cannot infer from that that Nam would also have the intention to give away
only that part which beneficially belonged to Nam. This second scenario could
not have entered into Nams mind. For there to be a gift, two elements must be
present: the intent to give and the precise subject matter to be given, to be
followed by proper conveyance (e.g., land by deed and chattels by delivery).
Here, both the elements are missing.

**

Presumption of Advancement

**

36\. We ought to mention that Tng has also made an argument based on the
presumption of advancement in view of the fact that there is no documentary
proof of a gift. This presumption is essentially an evidential rule, based on
relationship (e.g., husband and wife, father and son), to rebut the opposing
presumption of a resulting trust where a transfer of property is made by one
person to another without consideration. In _Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew_
[1999] 4 SLR 560, this Court, after considering _Pettitt v Pettitt_[1970] AC
777, observed that, in the context of husband and wife, the application of
this presumption has diminished in recent years in line with changing social
norms. It also noted that the current approach is to treat the presumption "as
an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence as
to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of the
thumb".

37\. An interesting question is whether the current approach towards the
presumption in the context of husband and wife should also be applied to the
context of father and son. We note that in _Shephard v Cartwright_ [1955] AC
431, a case where shares acquired by a father was registered in the name of a
child, Viscount Simonds said that:-

> Where a man purchases shares and they are registered in the name of a
> stranger there is a resulting trust in favour of the purchaser; on the other
> hand, if they are registered in the name of a child or one to whom the
> purchaser then stood in loco parentis, there is no such resulting trust but
> a presumption of advancement. Equally it is clear that the presumption may
> be rebutted but should not, as Lord Eldon said, give way to slight
> circumstances: _Finch v Finch._

38\. But in _McGrath v Wallis_ [1995] 2 FLR 114, the Court of Appeal extended
the views of Lord Upjohn in _Pettitt v Pettitt (supra),_ namely, that the
presumption of advancement in the context of husband and wife was readily
rebutted by comparatively slight evidence, and applied it to the context of
father and son. This could be viewed as a further shift in judicial attitude
in the light of changing social conditions. However, for the purposes of this
case, there is no need for us to go further into that as we are of the view
that whichever way the presumption is applied, it will not be of any
assistance to Tng, as the problems here are not those related to the question
of resulting trust but to problems of identification of the intention of the
giver (Nam) and the objects which are the subject of that intention.

39\. In the result, prayer 1 of the OS must fail.

**

Reimbursement Question

**

40\. We now turn to consider the second issue raised in the OS, namely, that
Tng should be entitled to be reimbursed by the Nam estate in respect of "all
costs and expenses incurred by him" pertaining to the 27 shares or that the
Nam estate should make a contribution in relation thereto. The judge below
ruled that Tng was barred from seeking reimbursement or contribution by reason
of _res judicata_ in the extended sense.

41\. In this regard, Tng relied upon _Rowley v Ginnever_ [1897] 2 Ch 503 where
it was held that a constructive trustee of property who expended money in
improving what he _bona fidely_ believed to be his own property, was held to
be entitled to be recouped of his expenditure, to the extent of the improved
value.

42\. On this reimbursement question we need to go back to the 1992 judgment.
There, the court besides declaring that the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi,
also made an order in these terms:-

> "6. An account of all bonus and rights issues which had been declared in
> respect of the shares specified in paragraph 5 (which includes the 27 OUB
> shares) and all moneys expended to take up the shares."

43\. This order was made obviously in recognition of the fact that moneys had
been expended to take up additional OUB shares pursuant to rights issues
(based on the 27 shares). The matter had been decided upon and that was really
it. If Tng, who was a party to the consolidated action in his personal as well
as his representative capacities, had complied with that order he would have
been reimbursed. But he did not, though he was bound by that order. In our
judgment _, res judicata_ in the strict sense applied to estop Tng from
pursuing the matter against the Nam estate of which he is an executor and
trustee. In any event, there is no basis upon which he may make a claim
against the Nam estate on account of expenditures incurred on behalf of the
Kongsi.

44\. In passing we would like to observe that there is one further difficulty
in the way of this claim by Tng. There is no evidence that Tng had expended
his own personal resources to take up the OUB rights issues.

**

Judgment and costs

**

45\. In the result, the appeal of Tng is dismissed with costs to the 3rd to
5th respondents. However, as CHN have raised the defence of _res judicata_ in
relation to prayer 1 of the OS and that has been held by us to be
inapplicable, CHN should not be awarded costs for work done in relation
thereto. Taking a broad view, we hold that CHN should only be given costs.

46\. With regard to the costs of Tng and Woon in their representative capacity
(1st and 2nd respondents), we note that the court below did not grant them any
costs. No appeal on that was lodged by Tng and Woon. However, CHN, in their
Case, challenged the correctness of that order. They argued that the costs of
Tng and Woon in their representative capacity should be paid by Tng
personally, as the whole proceeding was brought about by Tng pursuant to his
personal interest. While there are some merits in this point, as the personal
interest of Tng is different from that of Tng and Woon in their representative
capacity, and as the effect of the order that there be no order on costs in
favour of Tng and Woon in their representative capacity would mean that such
costs would have to be borne ultimately by the beneficiaries, we are
nevertheless unable to consider this argument because CHN have not filed any
notice of appeal, preceded by an application for leave as required by s
34(2)(b) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, against that order on costs.

47\. However, for this appeal, Tng and Woon, as executors and trustees of the
Nam estate shall be entitled to the costs thereof, to be paid by Tng
personally. Of course, the actual quantum of the costs to be allowed to Tng
and Woon in this capacity would have to be assessed by the Registrar, taking
into account the work done in relation thereto.
