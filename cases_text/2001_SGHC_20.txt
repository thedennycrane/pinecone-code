: On 4 January 2001, Sitra Wood Products Pte Ltd (`Sitra Wood`) applied for
and obtained, on an ex parte basis, an interim injunction ordering that:

(1) The third, fifth, seventh and fourteenth to eighteenth defendants whether
by themselves or by their agents or servants or howsoever otherwise be
restrained, and an Injunction is hereby granted restraining them from selling,
transferring and/or otherwise disposing of their shares described in Schedule
annexed hereto.

(2) The first, third, fifth and fourteenth to nineteenth defendants whether by
themselves or by their agents or servants or howsoever otherwise from dealing
with or howsoever otherwise acting on the first defendants` notices of offers
of shares for sale in the first defendants dated 21 and 22 December 2000 until
the determination or outcome of the action herein or until further order.  
  
The defendants named in that injunction applied, on 18 January 2001, for the
injunction to be set aside. That application was fixed for hearing before me
on 19 January 2001. It was supported by affidavits sworn by the fifth and
sixth defendants, namely, Wong Hong Hung (`Wong`) and Tan Kim Heng (`Tan`).  
  
At the hearing before me on 19 January 2001, Mr Govind Asokan, who appeared
for Sitra Wood, sought one week`s adjournment in order for his clients to file
an affidavit in response to the affidavits of Wong and Tan. This application
for adjournment was opposed by Mr William Jansen and Miss Molly Lim, counsel
for the defendants, on the grounds that any delay would be prejudicial to
their clients as a sale of shares in the company might, as a result, be
aborted. In order to avoid any prejudice to Sitra Wood by reason of it not
having had sufficient time to respond to the affidavits of Wong and Tan,
counsel for the defendants were prepared to withdraw the two affidavits and
continue with the hearing by reference only to the contents of the originating
summons and the affidavit of Sitra Wood filed in support of the ex parte
injunction.  
  
Mr Asokan objected to this course of action. He submitted that for the hearing
to proceed on that basis would be tantamount to this court re-hearing a matter
that had been heard by the judge who granted the ex parte injunction. Such a
re-hearing, Mr Asokan submitted, would be improper. He therefore urged the
court to grant him the adjournment in order that his clients could respond to
the two affidavits.  
  
I saw no merit in Mr Asokan`s submission that it would be improper for this
court to hear the application without the affidavits of Wong and Tan. As the
judge who issued the injunction did so on an ex parte basis, the defendants
are entitled to apply to have that order set aside. I can see no reason why
this court should curtail that right by requiring that such an application can
only be heard if it is supported by affidavits. If the defendants felt
confident enough to make the application without filing supporting affidavits,
they should not, in my view, be precluded from doing so. I therefore overruled
Mr Asokan`s objections and allowed the hearing to proceed on the basis that no
reference will be made to the affidavits filed by the defendants.  
  
The main ground relied on by the defendants in their application was that
Sitra Wood`s claim (as contained in paras 4 to 7 of the originating summons)
was only for damages arising from the alleged oppressive conduct of the
defendants. And in para 8 of the originating summons, Sitra Wood was seeking
an order that the second to sixteenth defendants purchase their shares in the
company. Mr Jansen told the court that his clients were prepared to purchase
the shares and that any dispute on price or the date on which the shares
should be valued for the purposes of the sale were matters that could be
determined by the court at the hearing of the originating summons. Mr Jansen
submitted that since the only issues in the claim were damages for the alleged
oppression and the price at which the defendants should buy out the shares
held by Sitra Wood, the ex parte injunction should be set aside.  
  
The relevance of the adequacy of damages in the grant of ex parte
interlocutory injunctions was considered in **_The Supreme Court Practice_**
(the **_White Book_**) (1999 Ed) where at p 566 the authors state:

> _In**Fellowes & Son v Fisher** [1976] 1 QB 122 at 137, CA, Browne LJ set out
> Lord Diplock`s guidelines (in the **American Cyanamid** case) in an
> enumerated series (much relied upon by judges in subsequent cases) as
> follows:_

> _
>
> (1) The governing principle is that the court should first consider whether,
> if the plaintiff succeeds at the trial, he would be adequately compensated
> by damages for any loss caused by the refusal to grant an interlocutory
> injunction. **_If damages would be adequate remedy and the defendant would
> be in a financial position to pay them_** , no interlocutory injunction
> should normally be granted, however strong the plaintiff`s claim appeared to
> be at that stage.
>
> (2) If, on the other hand, damages would not be an adequate remedy, the
> court should then consider whether, if the junction were granted, the
> defendant would be adequately compensated under the plaintiff`s undertaking
> as to damages. If damages in the measure recoverable under such an
> undertaking would be an adequate remedy and the plaintiff would be in a
> financial position to pay them, there would be no reason upon this ground to
> refuse an interlocutory injunction.
>
> (3) It is where there is doubt as to the adequacy of the respective remedies
> in damages that the question of balance of convenience arises. It would be
> unwise to attempt even to list all the various matters which may need to be
> taken into consideration in deciding where the balance lies, let alone to
> suggest the relative weight to be attached to them. These will vary from
> case to case.
>
> (4) Where other factors appear to be evenly balanced it is a counsel of
> prudence to take such measures as are calculated to preserve the status quo.
>
> (5) The extent to which the disadvantages to each party would be incapable
> of being compensated in damages in the event of his succeeding at the trial
> is always a significant factor in assessing where the balance of convenience
> lies.
>
> (6) If the extent of the uncompensatable disadvantage to each party would
> not differ widely, it may not be improper to take into account in tipping
> the balance the relative strength of each party`s case as revealed by the
> affidavit evidence adduced on the hearing of the application. This, however,
> should be done only where it is apparent upon the facts disclosed by
> evidence as to which there is no credible dispute that the strength of one
> party`s case is disproportionate to that of the other party. [Emphasis is
> added.]

Mr Asokan cited that part of item (1) above emphasized in italics in support
of his submission that the injunction should not be lifted. He submitted that
it was the law that if damages was an adequate remedy there must be evidence
that the defendants would be in a financial position to pay the damages. He
submitted that since there was no evidence in this case that the defendants
would be able to pay the damages the interlocutory injunction ought not to be
set aside.  
  
I saw no merit in that submission. If Sitra Wood was applying for the
interlocutory injunction on the grounds that the defendants were not in a
financial position to pay damages, it was incumbent on Sitra Wood to prove
that allegation and even then it was a matter of discretion in the court
whether the injunction should be granted. In the present case, the affidavit
filed by Sitra Wood did not even allege that the defendants would be unable to
pay. For the purposes of the granting of an interlocutory injunction, the
burden is not on the defendants to show that they can pay the damages: it is
on Sitra Wood to satisfy the court that the defendants cannot pay the damages.  
  
Mr Asokan then went on to submit that, on the balance of convenience, the
injunction ought not to be lifted. Balance of convenience needs to be
considered only if the court had doubts about whether damages was an adequate
remedy (see item (3) in the extract from the **_White Book_** quoted above).
In this case, based on the prayers in the originating summons and the
supporting affidavit of Sitra Wood, I was of the view that damages would be an
adequate remedy. It did not appear to me that, for the purpose of assessing
damages, it was necessary to restrain any of the defendants from disposing of
their shares.  
  
I therefore granted the application and set aside the ex parte interlocutory
injunction that had been granted.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application allowed.
