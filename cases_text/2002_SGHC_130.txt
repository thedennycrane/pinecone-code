Facts

**

The appellant was the private trustee of the estate of Goh Poh Choo in
bankruptcy (‘Goh’). Goh was adjudicated bankrupt on 21 July 2000. Prior to
that, she had paid $101,500 to the respondents who were partners of the law
firm which acted for her in respect of a suit brought against her by a
judgment creditor. The judgment creditor’s claim was dismissed by the High
Court, but was reversed by the Court of Appeal on 13 April 2000. In the
meantime, the said sum of money had been paid by Goh to the respondents in two
tranches: $56,500 was paid on 25 June 1999 and $45,000 on 4 April 2000 (nine
days before the Court of Appeal’s decision). The appellant made an application
for the sum to be repaid to the bankrupt’s estate on account of unfair
preference under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) (‘the Act’). The assistant
registrar dismissed the application and the appellant appealed.

**

Held,

**dismissing the appeal

(1) The sum of money was held by the respondent solicitors as trustees for the
client, and they were therefore "associates" of the bankrupt by virtue of s
101(5) of the Act (see 6 – 7).

(2) In determining whether there was unfair preference, the court has to
ascertain whether the bankrupt had been influenced by a desire to put the
payee in a better position than he would have been, in the event of the
bankrupt becoming a bankrupt. The legal fees did not appear in any way
excessive such that the intention of the payor to pay his solicitors in the
ordinary course of business can reasonably be doubted. The evidence on record
was sufficient to rebut the presumption of unfair preference. The fact that
$45,000 of the total fees were paid about nine days before the Court of Appeal
decision was not sufficient to indicate unfair preference on the part of the
bankrupt (see 10 – 11).

**Judgment** __

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. This was an appeal by Mr. Soh Gim Chuan (the appellant) the private
trustee of the estate of Goh Poh Choo in bankruptcy. The appellant applied
before the assistant registrar for an order that the respondents pay a sum of
$101,500 to the bankrupt’s estate. This sum of money was previously paid by
the bankrupt (before her bankruptcy) to the respondents as legal fees. The
respondents were at all material times partners of the law firm that had acted
for her in respect of a suit brought by the judgment creditor against her in
the High Court. The judgment creditor’s claim was dismissed by the trial judge
on 30 August 1999. The judgment creditor appealed and the appeal was heard on
22 February 2000. The Court of Appeal handed down its verdict on 13 April 2000
in favour of the judgment creditor. Goh Poh Choo was adjudicated a bankrupt on
21 July 2000. In the meantime, the said sum of $101,500 was paid to the
respondents as legal fees in two tranches. The first, $56,500 was paid on 25
June 1999 and the second, $45,000 on 4 April 2000 (nine days before the Court
of Appeal’s decision). The appellant’s application was based on unfair
preference under the Bankruptcy Act, Ch 20. His application was dismissed by
the assistant registrar and he appealed to this court against that decision.

2\. Mr. Gwee, one of the two respondents appeared on behalf of the
respondents. He raised a preliminary objection on the ground that the
appellant had no standing to make this application because he is a private
trustee of the bankrupt’s estate. Mr. Gwee’s argument was that only the
Official Assignee is empowered to make this application. Counsel relied on s
36 which provides as follows:

> > > > "36. - (1) Subject to subsection (3) and section 39, a trustee shall –
>>>>

>>>>> (a) have all the functions and duties of the Official Assignee in
relation to the conduct of a bankrupt and the administration of his estate as
provided in this Act; and

>>>>>

>>>>> (b) exercise all the powers of the Official Assignee."

3\. Mr. Gwee says that in order for the private trustee to be endowed with all
the power of the Official Assignee he must first administer the estate of the
bankrupt under as provided under s 36(1)(a). I have no difficulty ruling
against Mr. Gwee on this point as it seems clear to me that s 36(1)(a) and (b)
complement each other and are not subject to either in the way argued by Mr.
Gwee, nor are they mutually exclusive. I do not need to dwell further in an
argument borne out of desperation as this appears to be.

4\. The salient facts that I have set out above are not disputed by any party.
There are, therefore, only two points in contention that are relevant to the
appeal. First, in order to determine whether the payments of the $90,000 are
subject to recovery as being payments made as "unfair preferences", the
relevant time must be ascertained.

5\. The act provides for three time periods. These are set out in s 100(1) (a)
to (c) as follows:

> > "100. – (1) Subject to this section, the time at which an individual
> enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives an unfair preference
> shall be a relevant time if the transaction is entered into or the
> preference given –
>>

>>> > > (a) in the case of a transaction at an undervalue, within the period
of 5 years ending with the day of the presentation of the bankruptcy petition
on which the individual is adjudged bankrupt;

>>>>>

>>>>> (b) in the case of an unfair preference which is not a transaction at an
undervalue and is given to a person who is an associate of the individual
(otherwise than by reason only of being his employee), within the period of 2
years ending with that day; and

>>>>>

>>>>> (c) in any other case of an unfair preference which is not a transaction
at an undervalue, within the period of 6 months ending with that day."

6\. Only (b) and (c) are relevant for our purposes since the earlier of the
two payments (that is the $56,500 payment) was made within two years. This
depends on whether the respondents are "associates" of the bankrupt as defined
in s 101(5) which provide as follows:

> "101. – (5) A person in his capacity as trustee of a trust is an associate
> of an individual if the beneficiaries of the trust include, or the terms of
> the trust confer a power that may be exercised for the benefit of, that
> individual or an associate of that individual."

7\. Mr. Gwee argued that the firm of Koh & Partners, in whose client account
the money of the bankrupt was deposited, are not trustees within the meaning
of s 101(5). I do not accept this argument because the words of s 101(5) are
simple and straightforward, and are sufficiently broad to include a solicitor
who holds his money in his account. The account is in the name of the
solicitor or his firm, but the money belongs to the client. The money is
therefore held by the solicitor in no other capacity than that of a trustee.

8\. The second and more crucial aspect of the appeal is in respect of the
question whether the two payments by the bankrupt amount to "unfair
preference". The relevant provision in the Bankruptcy Act is s 99 which
provides as follows:

> > 99\. – (1) Subject to this section and sections 100 and 102, where an
> individual is adjudged bankrupt and he has, at the relevant time (as defined
> in section 100), given an unfair preference to any person, the Official
> Assignee may apply to the court for an order under this section.
>>

>> (2) The court shall, on such an application, make such order as it thinks
fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that individual
had not given that unfair preference.

>>

>> (3) For the purposes of this section and sections 100 and 102, an
individual gives an unfair preference to a person if –

>>

>>> > (a) that person is one of the individual’s creditors or a surety or
guarantor for any of his debts or other liabilities; and

>>>>

>>>> (b) the individual does anything or suffers anything to be done which (in
either case) has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in
the event of the individual’s bankruptcy, will be better than the position he
would have been in if that thing had not been done.

>>

>> (4) The court shall not make an order under this section in respect of an
unfair preference given to any person unless the individual who gave the
preference was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce in
relation to that person the effect mentioned in subsection (3)(b).

>>

>> (5) An individual who has given an unfair preference to a person who, at
the time the unfair preference was given, was an associate of his (otherwise
than by reason only of being his employee) shall be presumed, unless the
contrary is shown, to have been influenced in deciding to give it by such a
desire as is mentioned in subsection (4).

>>

>> (6) The fact that something has been done in pursuance of the order of a
court does not, without more, prevent the doing or suffering of that thing
from constituting the giving of an unfair preference."

The appellant submitted that the assistant registrar was in error because he
did not take into account subsection (5) which, by the presumption raised
against the respondents as trustees, shifted the burden to them. He submitted
that the respondents have not made any point in their affidavit that goes
towards rebutting the presumption.

9\. In determining whether there was unfair preference the direct object of
the court is to ascertain whether the bankrupt had been influenced by a desire
to put the payee in a better position than he would have been, in the event of
the bankrupt becoming a bankrupt. This exercise naturally involves a finding
of fact to a large extent and thus would vary from case to case. For instance,
the case cited before me, _Re Libra Industries Pte Ltd (in compulsory
liquidation)_ [2000] 1 SLR 84 turned on its own facts, so different that I
need not elaborate here. See also _Re MC Bacon_(1990) BCLC 324 in which Millet
J emphasized that it is not sufficient merely to "establish a desire to make
payment or grant the security which it sought to avoid". Otherwise, every
payment in itself, other than perhaps, a payment under mistake, becomes an
unfair preference.

10\. The act or the payment within the two years or six months prior to the
bankruptcy by itself is of little significance otherwise every payment even to
the bankrupt’s grocer will, by the receipt of payment alone, be counted as an
unfair preference. I now revert to the appellant’s main point, that the
respondents had not rebutted the presumption. In this case, in addition to the
public examination of Mr. Gwee Boon Kim (one of the respondents), Mr. Koh Hai
Keong (the other respondent) had filed an affidavit on 15 April 2002\. From
the evidence of the two respondents I accept that the payments were genuine
payments of legal fees. There is nothing to indicate otherwise. Although
counsel examining Mr. Gwee did not challenge the size of the bills, I am of
the view that on a broad scan, based on the nature of the suit in the High
Court, the legal fees did not appear in any way excessive such that the
intention of the payor to pay his solicitors in the ordinary course of
business, can reasonably be doubted. From the evidence available on record, it
would not be wrong for the assistant registrar to accept the payments as
having being made in the ordinary course of business. As I have stated, every
case turns on its own facts. In this case, I am of the view that by the nature
of the payments in question, the evidence on record were sufficient to rebut
the presumption of unfair preference.

11\. Although $45,000 of the total fees were paid about nine days before the
Court of Appeal decision, this fact alone would not be sufficient to indicate
unfair preference on the part of the bankrupt. Payments are made by clients to
their lawyers only upon his solicitor rendering a bill of costs. In this case,
if the respondents (as opposed to the bankrupt) had woken up to the fact that
if the judgment of the High Court was reversed, they (the respondents) may not
be paid, and thus promptly render their bill of costs on the eve of the Court
of Appeal decision, would that indicate unfair preference on the part of the
bankrupt? I think not. The intention to create an unfair preference is the
intention of the bankrupt. To contemplate otherwise without more is to put all
solicitors at risk of having to refund their fees should their clients become
bankrupt with two years of payment.

12\. It is thus the misfortune of the judgment creditor in this case that
money she had paid out under a judgment of court could not be recovered having
herself subsequently succeeding on appeal. But such are the risks inherent in
every case. Risks that cannot fully be measured. That is why parties, in the
hope of minimising these risks, ask for a stay of execution pending appeal.
Sometimes they are successful and sometimes not.

13\. For the reasons above the appeal was dismissed.
