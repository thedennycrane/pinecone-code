## Chaly Chee Kheong Mah, Po'ad bin Shaik Abu Bakar Mattar & 34 others

Court in England, in which judgment was given in its favour; (b) the legal
costs incurred by it in defending proceedings brought against one of its
partners before the Singapore Public Accountancy Board, in which judgment was
given in its favour; and (c) the legal costs incurred by it in defending
proceedings brought against it by BFS in the High Court in England, in the
event that judgment was given in its favour. D&T Singapore also contended that
all sums payable to it in respect of the indemnity referred to in (c) are
payable out of the assets of BFS in priority to all other claims or, as an
expense of the liquidation in priority to the claims of all creditors entitled
to prove in the liquidation.

Article 110 provided that every director or other officer of the Company shall
be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all
losses or liabilities, which he may sustain or incur in or about the execution
of the duties of his office or otherwise in relation thereto.

Three issues arose in this application: Firstly, whether Article 110 was
incorporated into the contract between BFS and D&T Singapore; secondly,
whether or not Article 110 covered the costs of successfully defending legal
proceedings; and thirdly, whether the indemnity element in respect of D&T
Singapore’s costs for the BFS action should be treated as an Expense claim and
accorded priority.

**

Held, dismissing the motions:

**

> BFS’s Articles of Association were not part of the contract between BFS and
> D&T Singapore. The established position at law is that the Memorandum and
> Articles of Association bind only the company and its members inter se and
> not third parties including auditors. Though generally the articles may be a
> source of the terms of engagement, it was not right to assume that they are
> incorporated into the engagement of every auditor (See [24] and [26]).

In this case, it cannot be reasonably concluded from the two letters of 6 and
15 October 1986 that Article 110 was incorporated into the contract of
engagement. Firstly, the letter of 6 October was a formal request to seek D&T
Singapore’s consent to be appointed as auditors. Although BFS enclosed its
Memorandum and Articles of Association under the cover of the 6 October
letter, it had to be noted that the Articles were sent ‘for the information’
of D&T Singapore. The more important letter was that of 15 October, in which
there was no reference to the earlier letter of 6 October, let alone the
Memorandum and Articles of Association. (See [22] and [25]).

Article 110 was not intended to cover the expenses incurred by D&T Singapore
in defending proceedings against it. This was because Article 110 was amended
from its equivalent, which was Article 113 in Table A of the Fourth Schedule
to the Companies Act, to remove the original wording in Article 113 that
expressly provided for indemnification of the costs for successfully defending
proceedings. As a result of the amendment, Article 110 was couched in general
language which cannot cover indemnification of expenses incurred in defending
legal proceedings. Costs incurred by D&T Singapore in defending legal
proceedings brought against it for acts which would be against its duty to do,
were not losses or liabilities sustained by it in or about the execution of
its duties to BFS or otherwise in relation thereto (See [30] – [37]).

For a debt accruing post-liquidation but under a pre-liquidation contract to
be elevated in priority based on the "liquidation expenses" principle, it had
to be shown that the debt was incurred for the benefit of the estate. The
costs incurred by D&T Singapore in defending the proceedings and BFS’s
liability for the same (if any) under a pre-liquidation contractual obligation
could not be described as expenses incurred by BFS for the benefit of the
estate. It was undeniable that the potential liability to D&T Singapore’s
costs under Article 110 was a risk which had been imposed on the BFS
liquidations by the pre-liquidation contract and was certainly not incurred
for the benefit of the estate (See [43]).

D&T Singapore should not be awarded indemnity costs by the English court in
the BFS action to reflect the Article 110 contractual entitlement, as that
would upset the priorities in the liquidation of BFS which was under the
supervision of the Singapore courts. D&T Singapore would not be entitled to
"super-priority" in respect of the indemnity element of any costs awarded on
an indemnity basis solely to reflect D&T’s contractual entitlement under
Article 110. The indemnity element of costs under Article 110 should
accordingly not be treated as an Expense claim (See [44]).

Introduction**

1 Massive losses were incurred as a result of the criminal and fraudulent
activities of a rogue trader in Baring Futures (Singapore) Pte Ltd ("BSF").
The funds were provided by its parent, Barings PLC ("PLC") of London, and the
losses brought about the collapse of the Barings group. PLC, BSF and their
related company Bishopscourt (BS) Limited, formerly known as Barings
Securities Limited ("BSL"), acting by their respective liquidators, instituted
or continued with legal proceedings to recover damages from Deloitte & Touche,
Singapore ("D&T Singapore") and Coopers & Lybrand, Singapore ("C&L Singapore")
and Cooper & Lybrand, London ("C&L London"). D&T Singapore and C&L Singapore
were successively auditors of BFS. The claims against D&T Singapore and C&L
Singapore are essentially for negligence in the audit of the accounts of BSF
and also in the audit of BFS’s consolidation schedules under the United
Kingdom auditing standards for group accounts. The proceedings in the High
Court in London against D&T Singapore have proceeded to an advanced stage. But
I was told that it was estimated to continue into the first half of 2003. The
liquidators of BSF could continue with their litigation against D&T Singapore
because of the escrow funds which were set aside out of the settlement sums
paid by C&L Singapore and C&L London who settled with the Barings group. The
settlement will be elaborated later in this judgment.

2 However, the amount of legal expenses which D&T Singapore had incurred is,
according to them, in the order of some 30 million and, in the circumstances,
both the liquidators of the three companies and D&T Singapore are very keen to
have a determination from this court, notwithstanding what I had stated in my
judgment which was reported in [2002] 1 SLR 370. Both parties agreed that I
should make my determination and set out my views on the issues raised.

3 I have two motions before me. They are predicated on the assumption that D&T
Singapore eventually succeeds before the courts in London in defending the
claims for negligence. In these applications, D&T Singapore claim, in effect,
that their legal costs calculated on an indemnity basis, and not merely on the
standard basis, should as a matter of priority rank in the liquidation of all
three companies as an expense, by reason of either or both of the estate costs
rule and the liquidation expenses principle, whatever is the appropriate
categorisation.

**

The background

**

4 D&T Singapore was appointed auditor of BSF on 15 October 1986 by a
resolution of the directors of BSF. As usual in the appointments of auditors,
the firm was re-appointed to the office of auditor for each successive year
until 1994. In and from that year, C&L Singapore was appointed the auditor and
was an officer of BSF from that date until about July 1994.

5 The precise circumstances and terms of the appointment of D&T Singapore as
the auditor are relevant. By a letter of 6 October 1986 the solicitors of BFS
wrote to D&T Singapore (then known as Deloitte Haskins+Sells). The letter was
in these terms:-

> > "6th October 1986

6 By a directors’ resolution passed on 15 October, 1986 it was resolved that
subject to its written consent to act as auditor, D&T Singapore be appointed
auditor of the company and to act as such until the first Annual General
Meeting of the company at a remuneration to be thereafter determined.

7 On 15 October 1986, D&T Singapore wrote to the Board of Directors of BFS
confirming its consent to act as auditor for the company. The letter stated:-

> > "The Board of Directors October 15, 1986

9 The various actions against C&L Singapore and C&L London (collectively
referred to as "C&L") were settled in October 2001. C&L paid 65 million in
settlement of the claims brought against it by BSF, PLC and BSL. BSF’s share
was 28 million. After that settlement BSF had 38.2 million, out of which it
contributed 35.75 million towards the settlement of the creditors’ claims
against the Barings group. BFS retained the balance to fund liquidation costs.

10 Under an Escrow Agreement reached, the sum of 32.5 million was set aside to
fund the continuation of the actions against D&T Singapore. Of this amount,
the sum of 24 million constituted the "Costs Escrow Account", intended to meet
any costs in favour of D&T Singapore and the sum of 8.5 million funded the
"Litigation Escrow Account" which was intended to meet the costs of the BFS,
PLC and BSL liquidators as to 6 million for BFS and as to 2.5 million for PLC
and BSL combined. The Litigation Escrow Account is to be used for specified
purposes which included the BFS, PLC and BSL liquidators’ costs of continuing
the action against D&T Singapore in London. The Costs Escrow Account was put
in place because BFS accepts that, as a matter of general principle, any
adverse cost orders made against BFS would be a liquidation expense ranking
above all other liquidation expenses save for those incurred in getting in,
maintaining and realising the assets of the company.

11 The action against D&T Singapore brought by PLC and BSL was struck out by
order of Evans-Lombe J in December 2001. The appeal to the Court of Appeal is,
I am told, stayed.

**

D&T Singapore two motions

**

12 By a Motion in this Winding-Up petition D&T Singapore asked that the
decision of the liquidators of BFS made on 5 December 2001, in rejecting the
Proof of Debt dated 22 November 2001 in the liquidation be reversed and that
it be ordered that the Proof of Debt be admitted in full. The first Proof of
Debt included (a) its indemnity costs of the PLC action amounting to
3,286,901.35, which was a contingent claim; (b) its indemnity costs of the PAB
proceedings amounting to 850,000 which was an actual claim for costs already
incurred; (c) BFS’s contribution liability in the third party action brought
by D&T Singapore against BFS in the PLC action said to amount to a maximum of
approximately 1.77 billion**,** a contingent claim; and (d) its costs of the
BFS action amounting to a maximum of approximately 25,935,733.06 which was in
part actual but mostly contingent. With regard to claims (a) and (b) D&T
Singapore have accepted that these would be ‘proof’ claims ranking together
with all other unsecured creditors of BFS and in respect of which a dividend
would be payable on a pari passu basis. As regards claim (c) it was rejected
by the liquidators of BFS on the ground, amongst others, that it related to a
tortious unliquidated claim which is not proveable in liquidation.

13 D&T Singapore also asked that another decision of the liquidators of BFS in
rejecting the Proof of Debt dated 7 December 2001 be reversed and that the
said Proof of Debt be ordered to be admitted in full. In support of its
application, D&T Singapore referred to the fact that it had incurred
liabilities in respect of legal costs in defending proceedings brought by PLC
and BSL in the High Court of England, Chancery Division and by the Singapore
Public Accountancy Board ("the PAB proceedings"), in which judgment had been
given in favour of D&T Singapore in both sets of proceedings.

14 D&T Singapore further pointed out that it had incurred and continued to
incur liabilities in respect of legal costs in defending proceedings brought
by BFS in the High Court of England, Chancery Division.

15 D&T Singapore contended that as ‘officer’ of BFS it was entitled to be
indemnified out of the assets of the company pursuant to Article 110 of BFS’s
Articles of Association ("Article 110") in respect of any losses or
liabilities that D&T Singapore may sustain or incur in or about the execution
of the duties of its office or otherwise in relation thereto. It was further
contended that the indemnity provided by Article 110 extended to costs
incurred by it in defending proceedings in which judgment is given in its
favour arising out of the execution of its office as auditor.

16 The primary case of D&T Singapore is that it is entitled to an indemnity in
respect of the costs incurred by it in the legal proceedings in London
instituted by BFS and that such indemnity ranks for payment in full as an
expense of the liquidation of BFS. In the alternative, D&T Singapore’s
entitlement to an indemnity in respect of the costs of that action is a
provable debt and that the liquidators of BFS were wrong to have rejected its
Proof of Debt dated 7 December 2001.

17 By the other Motion filed at the same time, D&T Singapore asked for a
declaration that it is entitled, pursuant to Article 110 to an indemnity out
of the assets of BFS in respect of:

> > (a) the legal and other costs incurred by it in defending proceedings
> brought against it by PLC and BSL in the High Court in England in which
> judgment was given in its favour on 23 November 2002;

> > (b) the legal and other costs incurred by it in defending proceedings
> brought against one of its partners, Chaly Mah Chee Keong, before the
> Singapore Public Accountancy Board, in which judgment was given in its
> favour by letter dated 16 November 2001; and

> > (c) the legal and other costs incurred by it in defending proceedings
> brought against it by BFS in the High Court in England, in the event that
> judgment is given in its favour.

18 Further, D&T Singapore also sought a ruling as to the priority of its
claims to the indemnity in the liquidation. The same grounds were relied upon.
It sought a declaration that all sums payable to it in respect of the
indemnity referred to in paragraph 15(c) above are payable out of the assets
of BFS in priority to all other claims, including that of the liquidator for
his own legal costs and remuneration, alternatively as an expense of the
liquidation in priority to the claims of all creditors entitled to prove in
the liquidation: (a) in the event that costs are awarded against BFS by the
trial judge in the High Court in London on the indemnity basis (whether in
order to reflect D&T Singapore’s contractual entitlement under Article 110 or
otherwise); and/or (b) in the event that costs are awarded against BFS by the
trial judge in that action on the standard basis, such that D&T Singapore’s
entitlement to an indemnity arises solely under Article 110.

19 Article 110 provides as follows:

> > "Every Director or other officer of the Company shall be entitled to be
> indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all losses or
> liabilities (including any such liability as is mentioned in the Act), which
> he may sustain or incur in or about the execution of the duties of his
> office or otherwise in relation thereto, and no such Director or other
> officer shall be liable for any loss, damage or misfortune which may happen
> to be incurred by the Company in the execution of the duties of his office
> or in relation thereto. But this Article shall only have effect in so far as
> its provisions are not avoided by the Act."

**

Incorporation

**

20 The first issue is whether Article 110 was incorporated into the contract
between BFS and D&T Singapore. The first point to note is that on the terms of
their letter of engagement dated 15 October 1986, as quoted above, the letter
set out "the terms of our engagement which will continue to apply until varied
by a subsequent letter". In _Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Company_ [1925]
Ch 407, there were no written terms of engagement between the auditors and the
company but the auditors were found to have contracted on the footing of the
articles. It was there recognised, and it is common ground in this case, that
the articles constitute a contract between the company and its members but not
as between the company and its auditors.

21 D&T Singapore, however, made the following points in relation to the letter
of 15 October 1986. First, it pointed out that the letter is a post-
appointment document and is a confirmation of the terms of an appointment
already accepted. Secondly, it was submitted on its behalf that the letter did
not purport to be a comprehensive record of the terms of contract between BFS
and D&T Singapore. As the range of services of an auditor was very wide, the
fact that D&T Singapore specified its services is no reason to infer an
intention to detract from "terms otherwise incorporated generally into the
contract". Lastly, D&T Singapore also pointed out that the letter was not a
comprehensive record of the terms of contract between BFS and D&T Singapore,
given in particular the absence of any reference to regulatory audit functions
required of D&T Singapore. In response, BFS submitted that the first point
raised irrelevant matters which did not disprove the fact that the accepted
terms of the contract of appointment as expressly confirmed did not
incorporate the Articles of BFS. The second point was, according to BFS, based
on a flawed premise that there are other terms (namely, the Articles)
generally incorporated into the contract. In relation to the last point, BFS
contended that the absence of any reference to the regulatory audit functions
of D&T Singapore was a neutral matter and did not advance the contentions of
D&T Singapore in any way. Those functions, as a matter of contract, would be
implied on the basis of necessity and making the contract of engagement work.
That implication of the term as to audit functions is quite different from
implying the contract under which BFS would indemnify D&T Singapore.

22 D&T Singapore further stressed the fact that BFS enclosed its Memorandum &
Articles of Association under cover of their letter of 6 October 1986. On that
fact, it submitted that the Articles were incorporated into the contract of
appointment and relied on the case of _John v Price Waterhouse_ [2001] All ER
(D) 145 (Jul) where at paragraph 26 of the judgment Ferries J considered that
"comparatively little will be required to satisfy the court that in particular
cases, the indemnity provided for by regulations 136 and 118 is incorporated
in the contract which is made when the company appoints a director or an
auditor." In the context of this case, it has to be noted that the Memorandum
and Articles of Association were sent **‘ _for the information’_** of D&T
Singapore. The short letter stated the wish of BFS to appoint it as its
auditors and the letter was a formal request to seek its consent. The letter
went on to "enclose each of the following documents _**for your information**_
:- 1. Certificate of Incorporation (Form 9); 2. Memorandum and Articles of
Association; 3. Form 49 showing the particulars of the directors" (emphasis
added).

23 D&T Singapore further called in aid of their submission that Article 110
was incorporated into the contract by pointing out that the appointment to of
a person to the office of auditor is an appointment to an office ‘the
attributes of which are (without more) defined in and subject to the
applicable companies legislation and any applicable terms of the Memorandum
and Articles of Association of the company’. It further noted that ‘the
appointment of an auditor necessarily carried with it certain attributes
(including obligations and rights) that are to be found other than the
specific terms of appointment.’

24 But must the attributes of the office be defined by and subject to the
applicable terms of the Memorandum and Articles of Association? The general
assertions of D&T Singapore as set out in the preceding paragraph may not be
consistent with the established position at law that the Memorandum and
Articles of Association bind only the company and its members inter se and
_**not**_ third parties including auditors. Admittedly, it is possible that a
director or auditor may be employed by a company on the terms of its articles.
In that case the articles will form part of the contract between the director
or auditor and the company. This was the position in _Re City Equitable Fire
Insurance Company_ [1925] Ch 407, where there was no written terms of
engagement between the auditors and the company but the auditors were found to
have contracted _**on the footing**_ of the articles. Warrington LJ at p527
pointed out that where "auditors are engaged without any special terms of
engagement…then if the articles contain provisions relating to the performance
by them of their duties and to the obligations imposed upon them by the
acceptance of the office, I think it is quite plain that the articles must be
taken to express the terms upon which the auditors accept their position. _Of
course, if the terms of their employment are expressed in a separate document,
then that document must be taken to define the conditions of their engagement,
and it would not be proper to assume any implied terms either from the
provisions of the articles or elsewhere."_

25 Both D&T Singapore and BFS agreed before me that all the evidence they had
about the circumstances of the appointment of D&T Singapore are reflected in
the two letters. On the basis of the two letters can one reasonably conclude
that Article 110 was incorporated into the contract of engagement? In my view,
the first letter was a ‘formal’ letter. The more important letter is the
letter of 15 October 1986 quoted above. It should be noted that there is no
reference to the earlier letter of 6th October, let alone the Memorandum &
Articles of Association. Secondly, this letter was signed by Mr Po’ad Mattar
who was the managing partner and not by Mr Owen Lee to whom the first formal
letter was addressed by the solicitors of BFS.

26 I am persuaded by the submissions advanced on behalf of BFS and conclude
that the articles were not part of the contract between it and D&T Singapore.
The articles of a company constitute a contract between the members of the
company inter se and between each of them and the company but, in the words of
Ferries J in para 26 in the case of _John & Others v Price Waterhouse and
another (supra)_, "do not, without more, constitute a contract between the
company and its directors or auditors." Though generally the articles may be a
source of the terms of engagement, it is not right to assume that they are
incorporated into the engagement of every auditor. There was not, in this
case, sufficient material to conclude that BFS had agreed to confer on D&T
Singapore the indemnity in terms of Article 110. The letter of 6 October 1986
signed by Mr Mattar was, in my view, not capable and did not incorporate the
indemnity into the contract.

**

Scope of Article 110

**

27 I now turn to the second issue, namely whether Article 110 does not cover
costs of successfully defending proceedings. BFS contended that D&T Singapore
is not entitled to an indemnity in respect of its costs of the legal
proceedings which its auditors had taken against it or the PAB proceedings.
The reasons are these. First, and forcefully, BFS asserted that such costs are
not losses or liabilities sustained or incurred by D&T Singapore in or about
the execution of its duties to the company or otherwise in relation thereto.
In addition or alternatively, it is argued on behalf of BFS that it was never
intended by the parties that Article 110 would provide an indemnity for such
costs. BFS expanded on these two cumulative or alternative bases in support of
their proposition.

28 BFS relied on _**Rowland & Ors v Gulpac Limited**_ [1999] Lloyd’s Rep. Bank
86 (decided in 1995 but reported only in 1999). The Commercial Court in London
considered, in the context of a Mareva injunction, an indemnity action brought
by directors including Rowland against _**Gulfpac**_ based on an article in
_**Gulpac’s**_ articles in the following terms:

> > "Subject to the provisions of the Act (viz the Companies Act 1985 of UK)
> _**every director, or other officer or auditor**_ of the company, or person
> acting as an alternate director _**shall be entitled to be indemnified out
> of the assets of the Company against all**_ costs, charges, expenses,
> _**losses or liabilities which he may sustain or incur in or about the
> execution of his duties to the Company or otherwise in relation
> thereto."**_(Emphasis added to show the similarity to BFS’s Article 110).

29 Rix J (as he then was) considered that Rowland and the other directors
could not establish a good arguable case for an indemnity from _**Gulfpac**_
under Article 31 against any liability which they might incur as a result of
proceedings being taken against them by _**Gulfpac’s**_ parent company, Gulf
USA ("the Idaho proceedings") concerning (as the Judge found) "not…their role
as directors of _**Gulfpac**_ , but only...their role as directors or offices
of Gulf USA". He then addressed the question whether the directors were
entitled to an indemnity as regards costs in the Idaho proceedings. After
concluding that there was no indemnity for the liability complained of, he
observed that it should follow that there would be no indemnity for costs,
noting that the case of costs was "a fortiori". Rix J continued at p 93 lhc:

> > "If the costs which are to be considered are costs ordered against the
> directors, then that might be viewed as a liability ancillary to the
> principal liability. In such a case costs and liability plainly go together.
> But _**costs incurred as an expense**_ , as occurs in the United States,
> where it is common there are no adversarial orders for costs, or in England
> as part of the directors’ own English proceedings, _**are costs incurred in
> defending or prosecuting actions and are not,**_ it seems to me,_**costs
> incurred or sustained in or about the execution of a director’s duties**_ to
> _**Gulfpac**_ _**or otherwise in relation thereto.**_ " (emphasis added)

30 In paras 69 to 71 of its submissions D&T Singapore sought to distinguish
the case by arguing that the above dicta was made by Rix J in the context of
the actions against _**Gulfpac’s**_ directors being in connection with those
directors’ duties to _**Gulfpac’s**_ parent company and did not have anything
to do with the execution of those directors’ duties to _**Gulfpac**_ itself. I
agree with BFS that that was not a correct reading of the case. Clearly, Rix J
was speaking in general of costs and held that costs incurred as an expense
were costs incurred in defending or prosecuting actions and were not costs
incurred or sustained in or about the execution of duties of the officer or
otherwise in relation thereto.

31 Rix J stated that his view was fortified by two other considerations: see
last paragraph on p 93 lhc and following. In referring to the first
consideration, he said:

> > "The first arises out of the terms of Section 310(3)(b) of the Companies
> Act 1985. Section 310(1) and (2) provides that any provision contained in a
> company’s articles or in any contract with the company indemnifying an
> officer of the company from any liability in respect of any negligence,
> default, breach of duty or breach of trust, is to be void. However, section
> 310(3) then provides as follows:
>>

>>> ‘This section does not prevent a company…

>>>

>>> (b) from indemnifying any such officer or auditor against any liability
incurred by him,

>>>

>>> (i) in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which
judgment is given in his favour or he is acquitted…’

>>

>> It seems to me that that _**subsection emphasises both by its function and
by its language a liability for costs incurred in the successful defence of
any proceedings is something different from a liability for costs sustained or
incurred in the execution of the directors’ duties to a company or, indeed, in
relation thereto."**_ (emphasis added).

32 It should be noted that the UK Section 310 referred to above is equivalent
to Section 172 of the Singapore Companies Act which provides as follow:

> > "172 (1) Any provision, whether in the articles or in any contract with a
> company or otherwise, for exempting any officer or auditor of the company
> from, or indemnifying him against, any liability which by law would
> otherwise attach to him in respect of any negligence, default, breach of
> duty or breach of trust of which he may be guilty in relation to the
> company, shall be void.
>>

>> (2) Notwithstanding anything in this section, a company may pursuant to its
articles or otherwise indemnify any officer or auditor against any liability
incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in
which judgment is given in his favour or in which he is acquitted or in
connection with any application in relation thereto in which relief is under
this Act granted to him by the Court."

33 To distinguish _**Gulfpac**_ , D&T Singapore submitted that it is not
applicable because the wording of Article 110 is materially different from
that in _**Gulfpac**_ and that Rix J’s comments were unnecessary for deciding
the case before him where the facts were different. BFS, of course, asserted
that _**Gulfpac**_ is directly applicable to the present case and is very
persuasive authority.

34 In relation to the second consideration, Rix J continued as follows:

> > "The second matter which seems to me to fortify the conclusion to which I
> have arrived concerning "good arguable case" arises from the authority of
> _**Tomlinson v Adamson**_ (1935) SC 1. That authority shows at least that
> the _**costs of successfully defending a prosecution for fraud does not
> easily come within a different version of an article 31 type indemnity.**_
> Whether or not the analysis in that authority is close, and granted that the
> wording of the provision there is probably narrower than article 31, the
> case does illustrate the _**difficulty of providing by general language for
> the indemnifying of a successful defendant.**_ " (emphasis added).

35 I agree with BFS that D&T Singapore faced the same difficulty. Article 110
was amended from its equivalent in Table A of the Companies Act, to
_**remove**_ the original wording in the article in Table A that
_**expressly**_ provided for indemnification of costs for successfully
defending proceedings. Article 113 in Table A in the Fourth Schedule of the
Companies Act under the heading "Indemnity" reads as follows: Every
Director...auditor…shall be indemnified out of the assets of the company
_**against any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether
civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour or in which he is
acquitted**_ or in connection with any application under the Act in which
relief is granted to him by the Court in respect of any negligence, default,
breach of duty or breach of trust." (emphasis added). It should be noted that
Table A was expressly excluded from BFS’s Articles of Association. Further,
the statutory words expressly providing for an indemnity against "liability
incurred in defending any legal proceedings in which judgment is given in his
favour or in which he is acquitted" were also excluded. There was accordingly
no intention behind Article 110 to cover such expenses._****_ At this stage, I
should also note that Article 110 as a result of the amendments is couched in
general language that cannot accommodate the meaning which D&T Singapore
sought to ascribe to it.

36 In _**Tomlinson v Adamson**_(supra) the article in question was in the
following terms:

> > "Every Director…of the Company shall be indemnified by the Company against
> … all costs, losses, and expenses which any such Director … may incur or
> become liable to by reason of any contract entered into, or act or deed done
> by him as such Director…in any way, in the discharge of his duties,
> including travelling expenses."

37 In that case, the claimant director relied on the article and lodged with
the liquidator a claim for his expenses in defending himself in criminal
proceedings wherein he had been charged with issuing a fraudulent prospectus
and fraudulently misapplying the company funds. He was acquitted of these
charges. The liquidators rejected his claims. The director appealed to the
court and maintained that he was entitled to be indemnified against the
expenses (1) in virtue of the indemnity clause in the company articles, and
(2) in any event at common law, as the expenses were incurred in consequence
of acts done by him as agent of the company. The House of Lords, affirming the
First Division, held that he was not entitled to his expenses. Lord Tomlin in
the House of Lords stated in his judgment on p 6 as follows:

> > "Here the allegation against the agent was that he had done something
> which he did not in fact do, and which would have been against his duty to
> do, are expenses incurred by him by reason of any act done by him as a
> director in the discharge of his duty. _**Upon the true construction of the
> article I am unable to see how that can possibly be maintained. In my view
> the expenses incurred by reason of the allegations made against (the
> director), being allegations of matters which would have been a breach of
> his duty and which were held to be disproved or non-proven, are not expenses
> incurred by him by reason of any act done by him as a director in the
> discharge of his duties.**_
>>

>> If the cases does not fall, as I think it does not fall, within the
language of article 160 of the articles of association, it is difficult to see
upon what principle it can possibly be brought within the common law rule. My
conclusion is that this appeal fails, and I recommend to your Lordships that
it be dismissed with costs". (emphasis added)

38 D&T Singapore asserted in para 60 of its submissions that there is a direct
causal link between the execution of its duties as auditor and the costs
incurred by it in defending proceedings based on an alleged breach of those
duties, so that such costs constitute a liability (if outstanding) or loss (if
paid) incurred or sustained "in the execution" of D&T Singapore’s dues as much
as any expenses incurred by it in doing so. Even if this argument is wrong,
D&T Singapore went on to say that such costs would have been undoubtedly
incurred "otherwise in relation thereto" to the execution of its duties as
auditor. D&T Singapore relied on the underlying proposition that if D&T
Singapore was found to have breached its duties to BFS then there would be
liability within the opening sentence of Article 110. In response, BFS pointed
out with considerable force that it is quite clear from _**Tomlinson**_ that
any liability of D&T Singapore would _**not**_ fall within the opening
sentence of Article 110 because the relevant acts of D&T Singapore would not
be within D&T Singapore’s duty to do and therefore would not be acts done by
D&T Singapore in discharge of its duty. Accordingly, any liability arising
therefrom would not have been "incurred or sustained in the execution of D&T
Singapore’s duties or otherwise in relation thereto".

39 I now turn to D&T Singapore’s reliance on the words in parentheses in
Article 110 to distinguish the _**Gulfpac**_ case. I am of the view that there
is no difference in the distinction drawn. The words in parentheses are all
qualified by the requirement that the liabilities of the officer be ‘
_**sustained or incurred in or about the execution of the duties of his office
or otherwise in relation thereof.’**_

40 Lastly, D&T Singapore sought to invoke the spirit of Article 110. It relies
on _**Re Famatina**_[1914] 2 Ch 271 for the proposition that at common law
there is no doubt that costs incurred by an agent in successfully resisting
claims brought against it as a consequence of executing its duties are covered
by the indemnity available to an agent under the general duty owed by a
principal to its agent at law. D&T Singapore pointed out that the indemnity
expressly permitted in Section 172(2) of the Companies Act is an aspect of
this general duty. I do not think there is substance in this approach. It has
been rightly pointed out that _**Re Famatina**_ did not involve the agent
having incurred the costs of successfully resisting proceedings brought by the
principal itself. Secondly, House of Lords accepted the distinction between
**_Re Famatina_ **and **_Tomlinson_ **on the facts and I also agree with BFS
that the facts in **_Tomlinson_ **are analogous to the present case to the
extent that both cases involve the officer/agent having to defend proceedings
brought against them for acts which would be against their duty to do. The
director in _**Tomlinson**_ had to defend himself against charges of fraud and
D&T Singapore is defending against allegations of negligence.

**

Priority

**

41 Finally, I address the question whether the indemnity element in respect of
D&T Singapore’s costs for the BFS action should or should not be treated as an
Expense claim and accorded priority. D&T Singapore pointed out that BFS’s
liability to D&T Singapore in respect of the costs of the BFS action will have
been incurred by reason of the actions of the liquidators taken solely for the
purpose of the winding up. It suggested that the simplest way to test this is
to compare the situation at the commencement of the liquidation with the
situation current in September this year. At the date of BFS’s liquidation,
whilst the indemnity provided by Article 110 existed, absolutely nothing was
owing under it. As at September 2002, I was told, some 30 million is owned
under it.

42 D&T Singapore argued that the indemnity under Article 110 survived the
winding up of BFS on the basis of the estate costs rule or as the liquidation
cost. There is, I am told, no Commonwealth authority where in an unsuccessful
legal proceedings an order for indemnity costs were ordered against the
liquidator. In my view I think that such an order would be wrong in principle;
it would be an unwarranted departure from the pari passu rule.

43 If D&T Singapore were to succeed on this third and final issue, it would be
on the basis of the estate costs rule or not at all. The liquidation expense
rule, historically, was always meant to cover the usage of property by a
liquidator. It has never been applied to costs. In this connection D&T
Singapore relied _**re Atlantic Computer Systems PLC**_[1992] Ch. 505. BFS
relies on _**Kahn & Anor v Commissioners of Inland Revenue **_[2002] UKHL 6,
which disapproved of **Re Atlantic Computer Systems Inc.** It is clear from
what was traversed in _**Kahn & Anor**_ that for a debt accruing post-
liquidation but under a pre-liquidation contract to be elevated in priority
based on the "liquidation expenses" principle, it has to be shown that the
debt was incurred for the benefit of the estate. Accordingly, costs payable to
BFS’s solicitors and experts incurred as a result of BFS choosing to bring
proceedings against D&T Singapore could be said to have been incurred for the
benefit of the estate of BFS. But the costs incurred by D&T Singapore in
defending those proceedings is another matter altogether. I agree with BFS
that it is not permissible to describe those costs of D&T Singapore, and BFS’s
liability for the same (if any) under a pre-liquidation contractual
obligation, as expenses incurred by BFS for the benefit of the estate. It is
undeniable that potential liability to D&T Singapore’s costs under Article 110
should BFS lose its action against D&T Singapore is a risk which has been
imposed on the BFS liquidators by the pre-liquidation contract and is
certainly not incurred for the benefit of the estate.

44 I am persuaded to the view that D&T Singapore should not be awarded
indemnity costs by the English Court in the BFS action to reflect the Article
110 contractual entitlement as that would upset the priorities in the
liquidation of BFS which is under the supervision of the Singapore Courts. I
have also concluded that D&T Singapore would not be entitled to "super-
priority" in respect of the indemnity element of any costs awarded on an
indemnity basis solely to reflect D&T’s contractual entitlement under Article
110. I need hardly say that if the claims in the BFS action had been or would
be misconducted (of which there is no evidence whatsoever) that would be
entirely for the discretion of the trial Judge in London to consider awarding
costs on an indemnity basis. But that is an entirely different matter, of
which there is not a whiff of a suggestion that it would be in prospect.
Accordingly, the indemnity element of costs under Article 110 should not be
treated as an Expense claim.

45 In the premises, D&T Singapore’s two applications are dismissed with costs.
