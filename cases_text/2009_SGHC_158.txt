Choo Han Teck J:

1 This was an appeal by the defendant against the order of the Assistant
Registrar allowing the plaintiff’s application to appoint Mr Johnny Tan as an
arbitrator in an on-going arbitration between the plaintiff and the defendant.
The plaintiff was the builder for the house at 8 Brizay Park belonging to the
defendant. A dispute arose between the parties from that contract and the
plaintiff claimed $177,237.30 against the defendant who counter-claimed for
$280,500. The claim and counter-claim was being arbitrated by Mr Yang Yung
Chong. The Assistant Registrar also ordered costs to be paid by the defendant
to the plaintiff fixed at $4,000. The arbitration was commenced by the
plaintiff in January 2000 pursuant to Clause 37 of the Singapore Institute of
Architects Conditions of Contract in the contract between the parties dated 14
July 1998. Mr Yang was appointed sole arbitrator about March 2000. The process
was long drawn and the interlocutory proceedings took place over six years. On
15 December 2006 the plaintiff’s then solicitor and the defendant’s solicitor
attended before Mr Yang for directions. These included the exchange of
affidavits and the questions and answers to and by the architect by 15 March
2007, and written submissions by 15 May 2007. The parties did not comply with
the directions in that the affidavits and questions and answers by the parties
were not exchanged by 15 March 2007.

2 Mr Yang then wrote to the parties on 29 March 2007. The letter stated as
follows:

I refer to my letter dated 15 December 2006 and to the directions given for
the conduct of the arbitration proceedings.

As the parties have yet to comply with the directions, please let me know if
the parties have agreed or will be agreeing on varied directions.

Unless I hear from either of the parties within 7 days from date hereof, I
shall consider my appointment as arbitrator as having been terminated by
conduct and thereafter close my file on this matter.

On 5 April 2007 the plaintiff’s then solicitor called Mr Yang to ask for more
time. Nothing more happened until 8 June 2007 when Mr Yang wrote to ask the
parties if the plaintiff was proceeding with the matter. His letter stated:

I refer to my letter dated 29 March 2007 and to the telephone conversation
that I had with Mr David Ong on 5 April 2007.

Please let me know in due course whether the Claimants are in a position to
proceed with the matter.

The defendant wrote on 13 June 2007 expressing surprise that Mr Yang still
considered himself the arbitrator. The defendant’s letter is set out for
convenience:

1. |  We refer to your letter dated 8th June 2007.  
---|---  
2. |  We are surprised by the same as your letter dated 29th March 2007 stated that you shall consider your appointment as terminated after seven days thereafter of neither party responds to the same.  
3. |  There has been no written respond to date and our client has assumed that the matter has been ended. Hence, he has allowed the expert’s request to destroy his file. Our client is severely prejudiced in this aspect. On our part, we have also closed our file and rendered our final invoice.  
4. |  Our client’s position is that the arbitration has been terminated accordingly.  
5. |  Thank you for your attention.  
  
3 On 10 July 2007 Mr Yang wrote to say that he had given the parties
reasonable opportunities to proceed with directions and since that did not
take place, he said “I am hereby treating my appointment as terminated.” Hence
the plaintiff applied under s 8 (1)(b) and s 8(2) of the Arbitration Act, Cap
10 (1985 Ed), which was the applicable version, to appoint a new arbitrator.
The application was allowed by the Assistant Registrar. The defendant appealed
against that order on the ground that the arbitration proceedings had been
terminated, alternatively, that s 8(1)(b) applied only if the arbitrator
refuses to act or is incapable of acting, or dies. Counsel for the defendant
argued that none of these situations applied since the arbitrator did not
refuse to act. He argued that the arbitration had been terminated by the
parties’ agreement. Finally, counsel submitted that this court should exercise
its discretion by virtue of the plaintiff’s conduct not to allow the
application.

4 I agree with counsel for the plaintiff that the arbitrator terminated his
own appointment which is not the same as the parties having terminated the
arbitration by agreement. I also noted that there had been undue delay but it
appeared from the record that it was due to the protracted sloth on both sides
although eventually a large part of the blame lay with the then solicitor for
the plaintiff. I accept the plaintiff’s explanation that its solicitor did not
notify it of the progress of the proceedings, especially of Mr Yang’s letter
of 29 March 2007. In this regard, the plaintiff might, had this application
failed, have recourse against the solicitor in question, but that has some
very difficult problems, namely, that to succeed against the solicitor the
plaintiff will have to prove that its claim against the defendant would have
succeeded. That would mean instituting the claim afresh in court. I am of the
view that the better recourse was to have the solicitor show cause why he
should not bear the costs of this application and appeal. Neither counsel
appeared to want to take this route. There is no basis on the record that the
parties had agreed to terminate the arbitration and I do not think that the
arbitrator could have unilaterally terminated his own appointment.
Furthermore, I found it strange that the defendant through counsel declared
that the defendant would abandon his counterclaim if the court agrees that the
arbitration is at an end. The defendant’s counterclaim far exceeds the
plaintiff’s claim. Finally, both counsels submitted that were this appeal be
dismissed, they would prefer to re-appoint Mr Yang as arbitrator since he was
au fait with the case.

5 For the reasons above, this appeal is dismissed.
