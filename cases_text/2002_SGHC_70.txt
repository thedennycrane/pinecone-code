**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. This Registrar’s Appeal is against the order of an Assistant Registrar
given on 6 March 2002 dismissing the Plaintiff’s application for leave to
serve interrogatories on Rey Foo Jong Han, an advocate and solicitor in the
law firm of K S Chia Gurdeep & Param. I allowed the Plaintiff’s appeal and
made certain consequential orders as to costs. I will refer to the
interrogatories later._

  
THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND

_

2\. Rey Foo Jong Han was the former solicitor of both the Plaintiff and the
Defendant. He was instructed by them in June or July 2000 to act for them in
the sale and purchase of 90 million shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd. He
acted on their joint instructions and was involved in the drafting and
finalisation of the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the said shares. Under the
Agreement, the Plaintiff and the Defendant were named as joint-purchasers of
the 90 million shares from the vendors.

3\. In this action, the Plaintiff is claiming half the purchase price of the
first tranche of shares under the Agreement. He paid for the shares solely.

4\. In his Defence, the Defendant averred that there was a "Precedent
Agreement" between him, the Plaintiff and one Mr Ong Puay Koon wherein they
would each purchase one third of the 90 million shares. The Plaintiff denied
the existence of any "Precedent Agreement". He asserted that he had not given
Rey Foo any instructions on a Precedent Agreement and had not received any
advice from his former solicitor regarding such. Accordingly, the Plaintiff
stated, the interrogatories would be directly relevant to the Defence raised
by the Defendant as they concerned the probability of the existence of the
alleged Precedent Agreement

5\. Further, if Rey Foo was aware of the existence of such a Precedent
Agreement from the instructions he received from the Defendant, he and his
firm would be potentially liable to the Plaintiff for failing to advise him on
its repercussions on the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The Plaintiff was
advised by his present solicitors that an inspection of the file maintained by
M/s K S Chia Gurdeep & Param on 21 February 2002 revealed no evidence of any
Precedent Agreement or of advice on this subject.

6\. The Plaintiff’s present solicitors sought the co-operation of Rey Foo but
he declined to reveal any information unless the Defendant waived solicitor
and client privilege. However, the Defendant was not willing to do so. In
response to the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of 14 February 2002 asking for
confirmation that the Defendant had no objections to them interviewing Rey Foo
and inspecting his file on the transaction in question, the Defendant’s
solicitors stated in their letter dated 24 February 2002 as follows:

> "Both our clients instructed Mr Rey Foo of M/s K S Chia Gurdeep & Param. As
> such your client is perfectly entitled to speak to his own solicitor, Mr Rey
> Foo. Your client is also perfectly entitled to review whatever documents
> that Mr Rey Foo has in his files, that he is entitled to under the usual
> solicitor-client relationship.
>
> However, at this time, our client does not waive privilege in respect of any
> instructions/communications between himself and Mr Rey Foo. Your client may
> well wish to ascertain the relevance of the information he seeks from Mr Rey
> Foo, before considering further steps."

_

  
THE APPLICATION

_

7\. Accordingly, the Plaintiff took out this application on 25 February 2002,
by way of Summons for Further Directions, for the following orders:

> "1. That the Plaintiff be at liberty to serve on Mr Rey Foo Jong Han of M/s
> K S Chia Gurdeep & Param interrogatories in writing as set out in a copy of
> which is attached hereto and that the said Mr Rey Foo Jong Han do answer the
> questions in writing by affidavit to be filed within twenty-eight (28) days
> after service of the Order to be made hereon and of the interrogatories ;
>
> 2\. That the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Mr Rey Foo Jong Han be
> dispensed with and his evidence be given orally at the trial of this action.
>
> 3\. That the costs of this application be paid by the Defendant to the
> Plaintiff."

9\. The Assistant Registrar granted an order in terms of prayer 2 of the above
application and dismissed prayer 1 as he was of the opinion that the
interrogatories would not serve the purpose of disposing of the issues at
trial. He also made no order as to costs.

_

  
THE APPEAL

_

10\. Order 26A of the Rules of Court, which permits interrogatories to be
administered to a non-party, provides:

> "**Interrogatories against other person (O. 26A, r.1)**
>
> 1\. – (1) …
>
> (2) An application after the commencement of proceedings for an order to
> administer interrogatories to a person who is not a party to the proceedings
> shall be made by summons, which must be served on that person personally and
> on every party to the proceedings.
>
> (3) The summons under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be supported by an
> affidavit which must –
>

>> (a) in the case of a summons under paragraph (1), state the grounds for the
application, the material facts pertaining to the intended proceedings and
whether the person against whom the order is sought is likely to be party to
subsequent proceedings in Court; and

>>

>> (b) in any case, specify the interrogatories to be administered and show,
if practicable by reference to any pleading served or intended to be served in
the proceedings that the answers to the interrogatories are relevant to an
issue arising or likely to arise out of the claim made or likely to be made in
the proceedings or the identity of the likely parties to the proceedings, or
both.

>
> (4) A copy of the supporting affidavit shall be served with the summons on
> every person on whom the summons is required to be served.
>
> (5) An order to administer interrogatories before the commencement of
> proceedings or to administer interrogatories to a person who is not a party
> to the proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or with a
> view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings in such
> circumstances where the Court thinks it just to make such an order, and on
> such terms as it thinks just.
>
> **
>
> Interrogatories to be ordered only if necessary (O. 26A, r. 2)
>
> **
>
> 2\. On the hearing of an application for an order under Rule 1, the Court,
> if satisfied that interrogatories are not necessary, or not necessary at
> that stage of the cause or matter, may dismiss or, as the case may be,
> adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order
> if and so far as it is of opinion that interrogatories are not necessary
> either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.
>
> …
>
> **
>
> Costs (O. 26A, r. 5)
>
> **
>
> 5\. Unless the Court orders otherwise, where an application is made in
> accordance with this Order, the person against whom the order is sought
> shall be entitled to his costs of the application, and of complying with any
> order made thereon on an indemnity basis."

11\. I will deal first with the issue whether interrogatories ought to be
ordered. Rey Foo was not willing to provide an affidavit of evidence-in-chief
before the trial although he has consented to give oral testimony at the
trial. His answers to the interrogatories would clearly be crucial for an
important issue in the proceedings – the existence of the Precedent Agreement
and, if there was one, the circumstances in which it came about. The Plaintiff
has therefore satisfied the requirement of relevance specified in Order 26A
rule 1 (3)(b). Further, Rey Foo’s evidence may assist the Plaintiff in
deciding whether to add him or his firm as a party to the proceedings, a
purpose allowed under rule 1 (5) of the same Order. I emphasize here that I do
not imply any wrongdoing on the part of Rey Foo or his firm.

12\. Rey Foo’s evidence would also clarify the above-mentioned important issue
before the trial. This would be beneficial to both parties as it would help
them prepare the case they have to meet and no one would be taken by surprise
by the solicitor’s evidence. The present solicitors would probably need to ask
the trial judge for time to take further instructions if Rey Foo were to
proffer his evidence only at the trial. This would be obviated if the
interrogatories were answered before the trial. The interrogatories should
therefore result in a fair disposal of the action and would save some costs
for the parties, factors the court should take into consideration pursuant to
Order 26A rule 2. I therefore allowed the interrogatories to be administered.

13\. I now come to the issue of solicitor-client privilege. This is governed
by Section 128 of the Evidence Act which is in the following terms:

> "128. – (1) No advocate or solicitor shall at any time be permitted, unless
> with his client’s express consent, to disclose any communication made to him
> in the course and for the purpose of his employment as such advocate or
> solicitor by or on behalf of his client, or to state the contents or
> condition of any document with which he has become acquainted in the course
> and for the purpose of his professional employment, or to disclose any
> advice given by him to his client in the course and for the purpose of such
> employment.
>
> (2) Nothing in this section shall protect from disclosure –
>

>> (a) any such communication made in furtherance of any illegal purpose;

>>

>> (b) any fact observed by any advocate or solicitor in the course of his
employment as such showing that any crime or fraud has been committed since
the commencement of his employment.

>
> (3) It is immaterial whether the attention of such advocate or solicitor was
> or was not directed to such fact by or on behalf of his client.
>
> _
>
> Explanation – The obligation stated in this section continues after the
> employment has ceased.
>
> _ "

14\. Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant were former clients of Rey Foo in
respect of the same matter. They employed him as their solicitor jointly. Rey
Foo’s obligation in the above section continues even though he has ceased to
be their solicitor. "Client" in this context would obviously mean both the
Plaintiff and the Defendant as "words in the singular include the plural"
[Section 2(1) Interpretation Act]. The privilege conferred by the Evidence Act
is a joint privilege in these circumstances. Rey Foo would be prohibited from
disclosing any communication made by one or both of them in the course of his
employment as their solicitor unless _both_ of them expressly consent.
However, the prohibition is against disclosure to third parties – that is,
anyone not within the solicitor-client relationship. The said Section 128 does
not seek to regulate disclosure within that relationship.

15\. Solicitors dealing with such clients would take instructions from both of
them jointly or from one of them by convention or by express instruction. They
would also write to such clients jointly on any matter falling within the
scope of their employment. It would therefore be highly artificial, and indeed
an impossible task, for the solicitor to have to distinguish between
communication with client A and with client B in respect of the same matter.
This is not a case of vendor and purchaser instructing the same solicitor
where a distinction must be made between communication to the solicitor in the
character of one party’s own legal advisor and communication to him in the
adverse character of legal advisor for the other party [see _Perry v Smith_
(1842) 9 M & W 681].

16\. There could therefore be no question of solicitor-client privilege in the
interrogatories in issue here.

_

  
COSTS FOR THE NON-PARTY

_

17\. The general rule as to costs in respect of the non-party is found in
Order 26A rule 5 (quoted above). The Plaintiff submitted that he should not be
ordered to pay the costs of Rey Foo here as there was "some measure of
culpability" on the part of Rey Foo. The Plaintiff referred to a letter dated
1 March 2002 from Rey Foo’s firm to the Plaintiff’s solicitors which stated
that the interrogatories were not necessary or not necessary at that stage of
the proceedings and that, in any event, Rey Foo did not accept that there was
no privilege attaching to the interrogatories. The Plaintiff relied on a
passage from Jeffrey Pinsler’s Civil Practice in Singapore and Malaysia (2002)
where, at paragraph 634, the author said, in reference to Order 24 rule 6
(which deals with discovery against non-parties but which has a similar
provision on costs):

> "However, there may be circumstances in which the court may vary this
> position by requiring the person to pay the costs in part or full. He may
> even be required to pay part or all of the applicant’s costs. For example,
> if he unreasonably refuses to comply with a justified request for the
> information or his unreasonable conduct has resulted in delay in obtaining
> the information."

The author actually made much the same remarks in commenting on Order 26A rule
5 in his Singapore Court Practice (2001).

18\. While I did not quite understand why Rey Foo should take the stand that
the interrogatories were not necessary at that stage or at all, the crux of
his difficulty was that he was caught in a dispute between two erstwhile
clients and was concerned about breaching his obligation owed to both. I
decided that the proper order to make was that the Plaintiff would pay Rey Foo
costs on an indemnity basis pursuant to Order 26A rule 5, such costs to be
agreed between themselves, and that such costs and the costs of the
application and of the appeal be costs in the cause.
