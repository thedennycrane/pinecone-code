: The parties were married in December 1977 in Australia. The petitioner is a
Singapore citizen and the respondent is an Australian citizen. After they
married the petitioner returned to Singapore with the respondent to set up
home, and they had three children. Eventually the marriage broke down. The
respondent returned to Australia, and they were divorced in December 1997.  
  
The divorce itself on the ground of the respondent`s unreasonable behaviour
was relatively uneventful. Matters became contentious over the division of the
matrimonial assets.  
  
These matters were heard before a district judge who ordered that:

> _
>
> 1 The respondent shall retain the property known as 1 Rosewood Avenue,
> Thornton, New South Wales, Australia and shall bear the outstanding mortgage
> thereon;
>
> 2 The respondent shall transfer her share of the property known as 13
> Balmoral Crescent, Singapore to the petitioner within four months of the
> date of the order herein and the petitioner shall refund to the respondent
> all moneys withdrawn from the respondent`s CPF account and applied to the
> purchase of the property known as 13 Balmoral Crescent, Singapore together
> with accrued interest.
>
> 3 If the respondent fails to execute the transfer of her share of the
> property known as 13 Balmoral Crescent, Singapore pursuant to cl 2 above,
> the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts is hereby empowered to do all acts
> and sign all documents to transfer the respondent`s share of the property
> known as 13 Balmoral Crescent, Singapore to the petitioner.
>
> 4 The property known as 36 Gwandalan Close, Seaham, New South Wales,
> Australia shall be sold within four months of the date of the order herein
> and the proceeds of sale shall be divided within 85% to the petitioner and
> 15% to the respondent.
>
> 5 Each party to retain their respective CPF contributions.
>
> _

  
  
In his grounds of decision, he explained that

> _In view of all the facts and circumstances of the case, I found that it
> would be just and equitable to award the respondent 35% of the Balmoral
> property, and 20% of the other matrimonial assets. I found that the
> respondent should have 35% of the Balmoral property, because of the
> following factors:_

> _
>
> a The respondent`s contribution of S$15,210 from her CPF to the initial
> purchase of the property.
>
> b The respondent`s contributions to the acquisition of the property in terms
> of searching for a suitable property to buy, working with the contractors
> and purchasing materials.
>
> c The fact that the bulk of the respondent`s contributions would have been
> there and to that property, it being the matrimonial home.
>
> _

  
  
The district judge had arrived at the orders set out in the foregoing
paragraph on the basis of the respondent`s 35% and 20% shares of the
matrimonial assets.  
  
The respondent was dissatisfied with the orders and appealed that

> _
>
> 1 the (respondent) be entitled to an equal division or alternatively to a
> fair and equitable distribution of all the assets acquired jointly or by
> either party to the marriage during the course of their marriage;
>
> 2 the (respondent) be entitled to an equal division or alternatively to a
> fair and equitable distribution of the matrimonial assets of the club
> memberships and shares in the public listed companies, upon which the
> learned District Judge failed to make an order;
>
> _

  
  
The matrimonial assets comprised real property in Singapore and Australia,
club memberships in Singapore and Malaysia, shares in listed companies, and
the moneys in the parties` Central Provident Fund accounts.  
  
The principal assets were two houses at 1 Rosewood Avenue, Thornton (`the
Thornton property`) and at 13 Balmoral Crescent (`the Balmoral Crescent
property`) and a plot of land at 36, Gwandalan Close, Seaham (`the Seaham
property`).  
  
The district judge made the orders after taking into account the circumstances
and purposes of the acquisition of each property.  
  
The Thornton property was purchased by the respondent in her own name for
A$160,416 in August 1996 after the marriage had broken down. The funds came
from the sale proceeds of another property also purchased in the respondent`s
name. There was a bank loan of A$59,000 taken by the respondent secured by
this property. The district judge found that the loan was not taken for the
purchase of the property but for the respondent`s own use. The property is the
respondent`s home following her return to Australia.  
  
The Balmoral Crescent property was purchased in the parties` joint names. Both
of them contributed to the acquisition of this property. The property was
purchased in 1989, before the marriage broke down. It was the matrimonial
home, and still is the petitioner`s home. There are three loans secured by the
property.  
  
The Seaham property is a plot of land bought as an investment in 1990 by the
parties in their joint names, funded by a bank loan which has since been
repaid. The district judge found that both parties had contributed in the
repayments.  
  
After hearing counsel, I allowed the appeal and ordered that

> _
>
> (i) the matrimonial assets shall be shared 65:35 between the petitioner
> andthe respondent.
>
> (ii) the total value of the matrimonial assets is assessed at $805,082.
>
> (iii) in the implementation of the division the petitioner may retain the
> property known as 13 Balmoral Crescent, Singapore and the respondent may
> retain the property at 1 Rosewood Avenue, Thornton, each to be adjusted
> against the agreed values, and
>
> (iv) the parties are to work out within two weeks an agreement for the
> division to be completed in three months, or in such extended periods as may
> be agreed.
>
> _

  
  
Sections 112(1) and (2) of the Women`s Charter stipulate that

> _
>
> (1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of
> a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order
> the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any
> such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale
> of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and
> equitable.
>
> (2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its
> powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to
> all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:
>
> (a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or
> work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;
>
> (b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for
> their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;
>
> (c) the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;
>
> (d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the
> family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any
> aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;
>
> (e) any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and
> division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;
>
> (f) any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party
> in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;
>
> (g) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other
> party(whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance
> or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her
> occupation or business; and
>
> (h) the matters referred to in section 114 (1) so far as they are relevant.
>
> _

  
  
Subsection (2) requires that all relevant matters including but not limited to
those set out be considered in the division of matrimonial assets. In most
cases, it would be practical and desirable to have a global apportionment of
all the assets. Where circumstances require, an asset can be apportioned
specifically, the overriding consideration being to come to a just and
equitable result.  
  
I did not think that the circumstances referred to in [para ] 4 required a
separate apportionment for the Balmoral Crescent property, and I dealt with
the apportionment on a global basis.  
  
A court may want to avoid displacing parties from their homes when dividing
matrimonial assets. This can be done by allowing them to retain their homes
within the framework of the overall division, as provided in my order (iii).
In this case, if the petitioner wants to retain the Balmoral Crescent
property, he will have to pay the respondent 35% of its value or give credit
for it to the respondent in the division, and if the respondent wishes to keep
the Thornton property, she can do that by paying the petitioner 65% of its
value, or give credit for it to the Plaintiff in the division.  
  
In the course of working out the values of the matrimonial assets, the
district judge made two errors. He adopted the agreed market value of the
Thornton property of A$155,000 as its value without deducting the A$59,000
loan secured by it. This is wrong because the respondent`s interest in the
property is subject to the bank`s interest. If the property is sold the
respondent will not be able to retain the full sale price. She has to repay
the bank and can only keep the remainder. The district judge should have taken
the value of the property at A$96,000 (A$155,000-A$59,000).  
  
When the district judge worked out the total value of the matrimonial assets
he added up the values of all the assets, then he deducted from that the
petitioner`s personal overdraft liabilities to several banks totaling
$115,481. He should take those debts into consideration in the course of the
division, but he should not take them out of the value of the matrimonial
assets. These debts which are not secured by the matrimonial assets do not
diminish their value, and should not be deducted from the matrimonial assets.
They should be considered as debts under s 112(2)(b) (if they come within the
provision) and s 114(1)(b).  
  
The district judge could have avoided the pitfalls by

(i) identifying the assets which are matrimonial assets in accordance with
s120 (10),

(ii) ascertaining as far as possible their values that may be realised and be
available for division,

(iii) taking into account all relevant circumstances including the matters
under s 112 (2), and then

(iv) deciding on the apportionment.  
  
I went through the process, worked out the value of each matrimonial asset and
came to the total of $805,082, and I ordered a 65:35 apportionment in favour
of the petitioner. I will not go into the makeup of the $805,082 or the basis
for the apportionment as the parties have accepted them.  
  
I then departed from the usual practice at this stage. I did not set out how
the division is to be carried out. There was a variety of types of assets
involved. Some of them are more readily realisable and disposable than others.
A party may have a greater attachment to some of them than the others. The
parties should be allowed to agree between themselves on how to divide the
assets by keeping those they want to keep, liquidating the remainder, and
completing the division by cash adjustments. They can come to any arrangement
as long as each party gets its share of the assets in kind, or cash, or both.  
  
I felt that the petitioner, a senior civil servant, and the respondent, a
lawyer, and their respective solicitors should be able to work out the
division better than I could without consultation with them. I gave them time
to work out an arrangement between themselves, with the proviso that they were
to revert to me for me to order the division if they failed to agree, or if
they needed the terms of agreement to be embodied in an order of court.  
  
In the event the parties had made good use of the opportunity and agreed on
the division without coming back to me. I believe this practice can be
employed to good effect in appropriate cases.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
