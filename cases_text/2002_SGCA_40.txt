**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. In this case, the prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by the
trial judge on the respondent, Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid,**** who was
found guilty of committing an offence punishable under section 436 of the
Penal Code, Chapter 224, which provides as follows:

> > Whoever commits mischief by fire or any explosive substance, intending to
> cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, the
> destruction of any building which is ordinarily used as a place for worship,
> or for the administration of justice, or for the transaction of public
> affairs, or for education, or art, or for public use or ornament, or as a
> human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property, shall be punished
> with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend
> to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

2\. The appellant, who contended that the trial judge’s sentence of
imprisonment for four years was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of
the case, asserted that an order of preventive detention under section
12(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC") should have been made.

__

Background

__

3\. At around 11 pm on 4 November 2001, the respondent returned to his flat at
Block 38, Bedok South Road, #02-653. He could not enter his flat because there
was a padlock on his gate. He called his mother, the deceased, to open the
gate. When his mother, who was lying on her bed in the front bedroom, did not
respond to his shouts, the respondent took a brick and threw it at her though
the window louvres. Although the brick landed on his mother’s shoulder, she
did not stir. The respondent, who became more angry, threw another brick at
her but she still did not get up. The respondent then rolled some newspapers
into a ball and threw the lighted object at his mother. It landed on her
mattress, which caught fire.

4\. A police officer, Sergeant Rohaizad bin Majnen, who lives five floors
above the respondent’s flat, rushed down to investigate after he saw smoke
emitting from a unit below. He saw the respondent standing outside his flat,
smoking a cigarette. When questioned, the respondent said that his flat was on
fire and that his mother was inside the flat.

5\. The respondent’s mother’s body was found badly charred and lying on her
burnt bed frame. The autopsy report stated that the cause of her death was
unascertainable. All the same, fire was ruled out as the cause of the death of
the respondent’s mother, who was 77 years old and suffering from diabetes, a
lung infection and ischaemic heart disease with interstitial fibrosis, which
could cause her to die suddenly.

6\. The fire started by the respondent damaged the flat and the common
corridor outside it. Repairs costing around $3,000 were carried out by the HDB
and the East Coast Town Council.

__

The trial

__

7\. The prosecution urged the trial judge to impose an order of preventive
detention under section 12(2)(a) of the CPC on the respondent in view of his
numerous previous convictions. The trial judge initially agreed that such an
order was appropriate and sentenced the respondent to 14 years of preventive
detention. At this juncture, the prosecution pointed out that section 12(3) of
the CPC requires the court to consider the physical and mental condition of
the offender and his suitability for preventive detention before imposing such
a sentence. The trial judge accordingly called for a preventive detention
report and the matter was adjourned for three weeks. The report concluded that
this was a case where an order for preventive detention was appropriate.

8\. After studying the report in question, the trial judge noted that the
respondent’s terms of imprisonment ranged in the main from eight weeks to six
months and were mostly for theft. He said that an order for preventive
detention should not be made as it was too great a jump from sentences of six
months to a period of incarceration ranging from seven to 20 years under a
preventive detention order. He then sentenced the respondent to imprisonment
for four years.

__

The appeal

__

9\. To determine whether or not the appeal ought to be allowed, reference must
first be made to section 12(2) of the CPC, which sets out the regime for
preventive detention and provides as follows:

> > (2) Where a person who is not less than 30 years of age —

> > (a) is convicted before the High Court or a District Court of an offence
> punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years or upwards, and has been
> convicted on at least 3 previous occasions since he attained the age of 16
> years of offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least two
> of those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; ….
>>

>> then, _if the Court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of
the public that he should be detained in custody for a substantial period of
time_ , followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration
of his sentence, the Court, unless it has special reasons for not so doing,
shall pass, in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, a sentence of preventive
detention of such term of not less than 7 nor more than 20 years as the Court
may determine.

>>

>> (Emphasis added)

10\. A sentence of preventive detention is intended for habitual offenders,
aged more than 30 years, whom the court considers to be too recalcitrant for
reformation (see _PP v Wong Wing Hung_ [1999] 4 SLR 329). Preventive detention
ought to be imposed if the accused has shown that he is such a menace to
society that he should be incarcerated for a substantial period of time (see
_PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah_ [2000] 3 SLR 308). While the court will consider
the need for the public to be protected from physical bodily harm, offences
against property, such as theft, offences against the peace, such as affray,
and offences against society in general, such as the consumption and
possession of drugs, may also be taken into account for the purpose of
determining whether it is appropriate for an order of preventive detention to
be made. In _Tan Ngin Hai v PP_ [2001] 3 SLR 161, 163, Yong Pung How CJ
explained:

> > In my view, there is no rule of law which states that protection of the
> public necessarily refers to protecting them only from physical harm…. As
> such, the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be restricted only
> to persons with a history of violent behaviour as exhibited though the
> commission of violent crimes. Instead, the real test is whether or not the
> degree of propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such
> that the offender ought to be taken out of circulation altogether in order
> that he be not afforded even the slightest opportunity to give sway to his
> criminal tendencies again.

11\. The respondent is 41 years old. The offences previously committed by him
are numerous. In 1976, he was put on probation for two years for theft. He did
not turn over a new leaf as he was fined $300 in 1981 for committing theft
again. In 1982, he was imprisoned for a year for housebreaking and theft by
night. In 1984, he was fined $2,500 for theft and fraudulent possession of
property. He was imprisoned for 5 months as he failed to pay the fine. In
1986, he was fined $500 for criminal trespass and was imprisoned for one month
after he failed to pay the fine. In 1986, he was imprisoned for a day and
fined $400 for committing theft. As the fine was not paid, he was imprisoned
for an additional month. By 1987, he had turned to drugs and was sent to a
Drug Rehabilitation Centre for 6 months. In 1988, he was placed under drug
supervision. In the same year, he committed theft for yet another time and was
imprisoned for 8 weeks. In 1990, he was found guilty of unlawful possession of
an offensive weapon and three counts of theft. He was imprisoned for 8 months
and given 6 strokes of the cane. In 1990, he was sent to the Drug
Rehabilitation Centre for 6 months and was subjected to drug supervision for
24 months. In 1993, he was once again sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre
for 6 months and was subjected to drug supervision for 24 months. He could not
get himself off drugs and in 1996, he was imprisoned for a total of six months
for possession and consumption of drugs. In 1997, he was sent to the Drug
Rehabilitation Centre for a third time and was again subjected to drug
supervision. Finally, in 2000, he was imprisoned for 12 months for failing to
report for a urine test on three occasions. Within a few months of his release
from prison, he threw a lighted projectile at the mattress on which his mother
was lying and was found guilty of committing mischief by fire, an offence for
which the punishment prescribed in section 436 of the Penal Code includes life
imprisonment or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years.

12\. The respondent’s string of previous convictions and the circumstances of
his latest offence reveal his propensity for criminal activity. In our view,
there is a real danger that the respondent will commit more offences in the
future. As such, this is a case where the trial judge should have made an
order for preventive detention.

13\. As for the period of detention, we were minded to have the respondent
detained for a very long time. The respondent pointed out to us that although
he had committed numerous offences in the past, he had never been imprisoned
for a long period of time. However, in _PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah_[2000] 3 SLR
308, 316 _,_ Yong Pung How CJ made it clear that any comparison between the
sentences previously imposed on the offender and the minimum period of
preventive detention is misconceived and constitutes a misreading of the law
and objective of preventive detention. He explained as follows:

> > The criteria for the imposition of preventive detention is that set out in
> s 12(2)(a) or s12(2)(b) CPC. The provision does not stipulate a minimum term
> for an offender’s previous sentences and does not require the previous
> sentences to correspond to the minimum period of preventive detention.
> Indeed an offender who has committed a perpetual string of offences for
> which he was sentenced to varying imprisonment terms of under one year is
> precisely the type of offender targeted by the provision.

14\. We considered two cases where the maximum period of 20 years’ preventive
detention was imposed. In the first case, _PP v Wong Wing Hung_ [1999] 4 SLR
329, the appellant, who was 35 years old, pleaded guilty to a charge under
section 332 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt to a public
servant. He had been previously charged and convicted a total of 16 times
since 1980 and had been sentenced to a total of 15 years of imprisonment. In
addition, he had received as punishment a total of 25 strokes of the cane. His
previous convictions were in respect of outrage of modesty, rape, causing
grievous hurt, criminal intimidation, armed robbery and using an offensive
weapon. The court was of the view that the appellant’s large number of
criminal convictions and his apparent lack of repentance proved that an order
of preventive detention for the maximum possible period should be imposed.

15\. In the second case, _Heng Jong Cheng v PP_[1999] 2 SLR 345, the
appellant, who pleaded guilty to a charge of affray, was found guilty of 23
counts of abetment of cheating and one charge of abetment of attempted
cheating. He had many previous convictions involving dishonesty over a period
of more than three decades. For instance, in 1991, he was convicted of two
charges of housebreaking and theft by night and was sentenced to two
concurrent terms of 24 months’ imprisonment. Shortly after he was released
from prison, he was found guilty of three counts of assisting in the
concealment or disposal of stolen property and sentenced to three terms of
imprisonment, each of a duration of two years and six months, with two of the
terms running consecutively. After his release from prison, he was charged
with, inter alia, 23 counts of abetment of cheating. He was sentenced by the
district judge to 9 years of preventive detention. On appeal, the period of
detention was increased to 20 years. Yong Pung How CJ said that faced with an
offender who had evinced a complete lack of remorse and whose record indicated
that he was highly likely to return to a life of crime once he was released
from detention, 9 years of preventive detention was manifestly inadequate to
protect the public.

16\. The respondent’s position is not better than that of the offenders in the
two cases referred to above. His first crime was committed way back in 1976,
when he was merely 15 years old and he has gone from bad to worse over the
years. He has been convicted on innumerable occasions over a period of 26
years and has been imprisoned for a total of 49 months. The imposition of a
punishment of six strokes of the cane has had no effect whatsoever on his bent
for criminal activity. In regard to his latest offence, it is rather alarming
that he displayed such a blatant disregard for his own frail and aged mother
when he threw bricks at her and when he threw a lighted ball of newspaper onto
the mattress on which his mother was lying. He also showed how callous he was
about the safety of his neighbours as the fire could easily have spread to
other flats and could have caused death and injury but for the timely
intervention of the civil defence force. When the fire started, the respondent
took no steps whatsoever to put out the fire or to call the fire brigade even
though his mother was trapped in the flat. He merely stood outside his house
and smoked a cigarette. Indeed, in his skeletal submissions, he stated that he
was "unable to do anything except to watch while waiting for the arrival of
the police and fire brigade … and he could only prevent himself from getting
caught in the raging fire".

17\. The respondent’s dependence on drugs and alcohol should not be
overlooked. He has not been able to hold a steady job and many of the offences
committed by him stemmed from the need to find money for drugs. Taking all
circumstances into account, detaining the respondent for a long period of time
would be in the interest of the public. As such, we sentenced the respondent
to preventive detention for a period of 20 years.
