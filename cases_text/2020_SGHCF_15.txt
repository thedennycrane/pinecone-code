Tan Puay Boon JC:

Introduction

1 The plaintiff (“Husband”) and the defendant (“Wife”) (collectively, “the
parties”) were married on 15 October 2005 in Singapore. There are two children
to the marriage, a daughter born in 2005 (“Daughter”) and a son born in 2010
(“Son”) (collectively, “the Children”). 1

but the proceedings were discontinued. He filed for divorce on again 1 July
2017, and interim judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 6 March 2018, on the ground
that that the Wife has behaved in such a way that the Husband cannot
reasonably be expected to live with her. 3

5 It is also necessary to mention the Husband’s marriage history. The marriage
which is the subject of these ancillary proceedings is the Husband’s second
marriage. The Husband has two children from his first marriage, who are 21 and
24 years old. 11

6 In addition, a few brief words ought to be said on the Wife’s employment
history. When she met the Husband in 2004, the Wife was also working at
Company [A]. 14

In 2017, she found employment with Organisation [B] as a Senior Vice-
President, 15

Notably, Organisation [B] was in a different industry from that of the
companies where the Wife worked between 2004 and 2012. The Wife was let go
from Organisation [B] in 2019.

7 The parties have, prior to the hearing, made numerous applications to the
court. It is unnecessary to recite the entire procedural history of the
divorce, save to highlight the following salient points. In FC/ORC 3372/2018,
the parties were given joint custody over the Children. Care and control of
the Children was granted to the Wife by consent. The Husband was also ordered
to pay the Wife $13,300.00pm for maintenance of the Children, while no
maintenance of the Wife was ordered. The Wife subsequently commenced
proceedings for committal under FC/SUM 2754/2019, FC/SUM 348/2019 and FC/SUM
32/2020, owing to the Husband’s failure to pay interim maintenance. FC/SUM
2754/2019 was eventually withdrawn. Under FC/ORCs 145/2020 and 147/2020, the
Husband was found to be in contempt for not paying the maintenance amounts
referred to under HCF/SUM 348/2019 and FC/SUM 32/2020, but his contempt was
purged by making full payments of the said maintenance amounts.

Division of matrimonial assets

8 I first consider the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets under s
112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Charter”).

9 There are two methodologies of dividing matrimonial assets, as set out in NK
v NL [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [31]–[33]: the global assessment methodology and
the classification methodology. The global methodology comprises four distinct
steps: identification, valuation, division and apportionment (of the
matrimonial assets). On the other hand, the classification methodology first
divides the matrimonial assets into separate classes before applying the four
steps above in relation to each class of assets.

10 Neither the Husband nor the Wife sought to divide the pool of matrimonial
assets into distinct classes in their Joint Summary of Relevant Information
(“JSRI”). 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

Joint Summary of Relevant Information (19.8.2019) (“JSRI”) pp 8–13.

I understand them to be relying on the global assessment methodology, and will
adopt this methodology accordingly as I see no reason to use the
classification methodology.

Identification and valuation

11 The starting position for the date of the identification of matrimonial
assets is the IJ date, ie, 6 March 2018 (ARY v ARX and another appeal [2016] 2
SLR 686 at [31]). The starting point for the date of the valuation of the
matrimonial assets is the date of the AM hearing, ie, 29 August 2019 (TND v
TNC and another appeal [2017] SGCA 34 at [19]). However, specifically for bank
accounts, the matrimonial assets are the money in the accounts, and not the
accounts themselves (UZR v UZS [2019] SGHCF 28 at [11]). Therefore, the better
date to value bank accounts would be the IJ date, and not the AM date.

12 The Wife argued that there should be a departure from this default
position. According to her, the date for identification and valuation should
both be the date when the Husband filed the writ for divorce, ie 1 July 2017.
18

##### Foot Note 18

×

Wife’s Submissions (21.08.2019) (“WS-1”) at para 36.

The identification date should be 1 July 2017 because the marriage must have
ended when the Husband commenced for divorce the second time. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

WS-1 at para 38.

Further, using a valuation date later than 1 July 2017 would be unfair as the
Husband has reduced the value of matrimonial assets since the commencement of
the divorce to the Wife’s detriment. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

WS-1 at para 41.

13 I do not accept the Wife’s argument. The marriage between the parties was
only dissolved upon the grant of IJ, 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

See FC/IJ 1119/2018 at para 2(b)(ii).

and not upon the filing of the writ of divorce. Further, the Husband’s
dissipation of matrimonial assets is a matter that go towards identification
and not valuation. In any event, the Wife herself recognised that the court
has the power to claw back any asset dissipated by the Husband before and
after the commencement of the divorce. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

WS-1 at para 42.

14 Accordingly, there is no reason to depart from the default position and I
apply the approach in [11] above for the identification and valuation of the
matrimonial assets, save where otherwise agreed by the parties.

15 The parties also did not agree on the applicable exchange rate. I therefore
use the exchange rate on the AM date of 29 August 2019 of EUR1 = $1.54 23

6| Stock plan from Company [A] (“[A] Stock Plan”)  
  
18 I address the assets with disputed values in turn.

(1) Matrimonial Home

19 The court-ordered valuer, RHT Chesterstons (“RHT”), valued the Matrimonial
Home at $1,598.00 psf (or $5,780,000.00) as at 22 October 2019. 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

HS-2 at para 64.

The Husband was dissatisfied with this valuation and obtained a further
valuation from Knight Frank, which found that the valuation of the Matrimonial
Home should be at $1,733.00 psf (or $6,266,528.00) as at 4 December 2019. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

HS-2 at para 65.

20 It was not clear what the Husband wanted to achieve by furnishing the Frank
Knight report. He did not appear to challenge the RHT report, but only sought
to have such report “looked at in light of such a different market analysis by
another company”. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

HS-2 at para 65.

Likewise, the Frank Knight report does not “constitute an opinion on the
fairness of the [RHT report]”. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

HS-2 at Annex 3, p 2.

In the absence of a formal challenge to the RHT report, the Husband should not
be allowed to furnish additional valuation reports just because he is unhappy
with the RHT report. To do otherwise would encourage litigants to furnish
numerous valuation reports, leading to protracted proceedings and unnecessary
expenses.

21 From the market valuation of $5,780,000.00 which I adopt, I deduct the
mortgage loan valued at $1,796,164.23 as at 18 March 2019 30

(2) Natwest Accounts -378, -957 and -689 and [A] Pension

pension with Company [A], as indicated in the JSRI 31

3| Natwest -689| 840,415.14(GBP500,437.75)

24 The Husband explained that the [A] Pension was withdrawn and the proceeds
deposited into his UOB Account -855 on 14 February 2017. The proceeds were
subsequently moved from UOB Account -855 to Natwest Account -378 on 27 July
2018, 34

I accept the Husband’s explanation. However, as mentioned at [11] above, the
pool of matrimonial assets is determined as at the IJ date, ie 6 March 2018.
At this date, the proceeds of the [A] Pension (of EUR513,792.23) was still
parked in UOB Account -855 . 37

matrimonial assets, and exclude the [A] Pensions and the balance in Natwest
Account -689.

26 As regards Natwest Accounts -378 and -957, their balances should be taken
as near to the IJ date as possible. I therefore adopt the balances in these
accounts as indicated by the Husband in his first Affidavit of Assets and
Means (“HAOM1”), which were GBP53,951.35 for Natwest Account -378 as at 1
March 2018 38

Disputed assets

28 The disputed assets are as follows:

S/N| Description  
---|---  
Wife’s Assets  
1| Dissipation by the Wife  
Husband’s Assets  
2| UK Pension  
3| Dissipation by the Husband  
  
(1) Dissipation by the Wife

29 The Husband submitted that the Wife has dissipated $279,877.37 between 31
March 2016 and 18 September 2018, 41

##### Foot Note 41

×

HS-1 at para 189.

which must be clawed back to the pool of matrimonial assets.

30 The Court of Appeal provided the following guidelines on how allegations of
wrongful dissipation are to be addressed (TNL v TNK [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“TNL”)
at [24]):

[T]he issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one
spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or
(b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are of
the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or
otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to
the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative
interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the
expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time.
Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure
was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the
expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse
who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full.
In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share
in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact
and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except
to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill
expenses.

[emphasis added]

31 As emphasized by the Court of Appeal, what constitutes a substantial sum is
a factual question. Considering the lifestyle that the Wife has enjoyed, and
that the family withdraws an average monthly sum of over $50,000.00 between
2015 and 2018, 42

##### Foot Note 42

×

HS-2 at para 28.

I am of the view that only withdrawals exceeding $50,000.00 should be clawed
back. For example, if the Wife made three withdrawals of $49,000.00, $3,000.00
and $51,000.00, only the final withdrawal would be clawed back. The first two
withdrawals, being less than $50,000.00 each, will not be clawed back. I
therefore notionally add back a sum of $89,953.93, being the sum withdrawn by
the Wife from POSB Account -635 on 18 September 2018, which was the only
withdrawal that exceeded $50,000.00.

(2) UK Pension

32 The evidence shows that the UK Pension was granted to the Husband for
services rendered by him from 1 October 1986 to 31 March 2007, 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

HAOM4 at p 81.

for a total of 21 years. On the date at which the Husband stopped accumulating
the UK Pension, ie 31 March 2007, the accrued amount due to him was
GBP36,860.22 per annum 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

HAOM4 at p 89.

(ie, that upon his retirement, tentatively indicated to be 1 October 2016, he
would receive GGP38,860.22 per annum). It therefore appears that the earliest
date this amount would be payable to the Husband is 1 October 2026. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

Wife’s Affidavit (29.08.2019) (“WAOM4”) at p 104.

33 The UK Pension is a matrimonial asset, notwithstanding that the amount
accrued is not yet payable to the Husband. This is because the Husband’s
entitlement to the UK Pension is in itself a chose in action, which falls
within the definition of “matrimonial assets” under s 112(10) of the Charter:
Chan Teck Hock David v Leong Mei Chuan [2002] SGCA 3 (“Chan Teck Hock”) at
[17], [27]–[29].

34 However, as earlier mentioned, the UK Pension was granted to the Husband
for services rendered (largely) before the marriage. Since parties were only
married in 2005, just 2 out of the 21 years’ of the Husband’s services
occurred after the marriage. Accordingly, the amount of accrued pension to be
added to the pool of matrimonial assets would be GBP3,510.50 per annum (being
GBP36,860.22 x 2 / 21): Chan Teck Hock at [37]. However, it was not indicated
for how many years the UK Pension would be available to the Husband after his
retirement. In other words, while the multiplicand of GBP3,510.50 per annum is
known, the multiplier (in terms of the number of years) is not. It follows
that the total amount of accrued pension to be added to the pool of
matrimonial assets cannot be ascertained. I am thus constrained to adjusting
the final division ratio in the Wife’s favour.

(3) Dissipation by the Husband

35 When the Husband was retrenched in February 2017, he received a termination
package of about $1.2m, which was deposited into DBS Account -466. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

HS-2 at para 30.

However, as of end October 2018 (about 20 months later) this sum has been
substantially used up. 47

##### Foot Note 47

×

WS-1 at para 41(a)(i)–(ii).

The Husband has also withdrawn his CPF money amounting to approximately
$259,165.00 48

##### Foot Note 48

×

HAOM1 at p 3.

and transferred this sum to Natwest Account -378 on 10 September 2018. 49

##### Foot Note 49

×

WS-1 at para 41(a)(v).

36 As mentioned at [11] above, bank accounts should be identified and valued
as at the IJ date. Since the Husband’s CPF money was only withdrawn after the
IJ date, it follows that such money would still be parked in the Husband’s CPF
accounts as at the IJ date. I therefore add the $259,165.00 back to the pool
of matrimonial assets.

37 I turn to the termination package. The Husband explained that the $1.2m has
been spent on various categories of expenses. 50

##### Foot Note 50

×

HS-2 at para 34.

I note that for 12 months following his termination in February 2017, the
Husband did not find another job (because of a non-compete clause in his
employment contract with the employer that retrenched him). 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

HS-2 at para 32.

Nevertheless, the Husband ought to provide some explanations for spending
$1.2m over the course of 20 months (ie, about $60,000.00pm).

38 The Husband has explained that his money has been used on the following: 52

##### Foot Note 52

HS-2 at para 34.

Category| Description| Amount ($)  
---|---|---  
1| Income tax| 234,935.63  
2| Rental | 28,000.00  
3| Maintenance of the family | 261,279.00  
4| Daughter’s school fees | 77,852.92  
5| Family holidays| 29,047.52  
6| Repayment for Wife’s car accident| 1,200.00  
7 | Holidays with relatives| 42,515.06  
8| Maintenance of children from his first marriage| 115,725.54  
9| Counselling fees | 29,251.25  
10| Repayment of loans to Husband’s parents| 21,982.46  
11| Overseas trips to look for jobs| 44,665.72  
12| Legal fees| 96,061.98  
13| Living expenses| ~ 165,000.00  
  
39 My analysis of the Husband’s explanations is as follows:

(a) I can accept that category 1 is valid, since such payments were required
by law.

(b) I can also accept that categories 2 to 6 are valid, since these expenses
were for necessities and/or to the benefit of the family. These expenses were
incurred for the benefit of the family, and with full knowledge from the Wife.
Such expenses, by their nature, must have been taken to have been consented to
by the Wife. They thus do not fall foul of the rule in TNL (see [30] above).

(c) Concerning category 7, while the Husband is entitled to go on holidays
with his relatives, I do not think that he should spend excessively on these
trips. In my view, the Husband should only be allowed to spend up to
$20,000.00 on overseas trips with his relatives.

(d) Concerning category 8, while the Husband can, and should be allowed to,
maintain his children from his first marriage, I do not think that he should
spend excessively. This is because the Husband indicated that his maintenance
of his children from his former marriage was not done out of a legal
obligation, ie that it was voluntary. In contrast, there is a legal obligation
for him to maintain the Wife and the Children. In his first affidavit of
assets and means, the Husband stated that he gave his children GBP1,000.00pm
for their university education. 53

##### Foot Note 53

HAOM1 at paras 15(a)–(b).

Over a course of 20 months (the duration in which the Husband was unemployed),
this would amount to GBP20,000.00 (~ $30,800.00). I am willing to add in some
further allowance in respect of the maintenance provided, but even then, the
Husband should only be allowed to spend up to $50,000.00 on maintenance of the
children from his first marriage.

(e) I can accept that category 9 is valid, since the importance of counselling
for the Husband to deal with his emotional stress arising from the divorce 54

Husband’s 3rd Affidavit of Assets and Means (31.05.2019) (“HAOM3”) at para 12.

should not be understated.

(f) Concerning category 10, there is the presumption that transfers from
parents to children are presumed to be gifts and not loans (see Neo Hui Ling v
Ang Ah Sew [2012] 2 SLR 831 at [23]). The money given to the Husband by his
parents is thus presumed to be a gift. The Husband claimed that his parents
lent him about GBP10,000.00 in September 2015 when he was struggling to pay
rent after leaving the Matrimonial Home. 55

##### Foot Note 55

HAOM3 at p 290.

To show that the GBP10,000.00 was in the nature of a loan, the Husband merely
pointed to his bank statements for DBS Account -466. However, the statements
simply indicated that there were two cheque deposits into the account. 56

##### Foot Note 56

×

HAOM2 at p 482.

There was no explanation on the source of, or the purpose behind, the
deposits. I am thus not convinced that the GBP10,000.00 was a loan.
Accordingly, I do not accept the expense in category 10.

(g) Concerning category 11, the Husband stated that he had to travel overseas
to Paris, Pakistan, Dubai and London to find jobs after being retrenched from
Company [A]. 57

##### Foot Note 57

HS-2 at para 33(d).

The Husband did not specify the number of trips taken, or the amount spent on
each trips, but a rough picture can be drawn from the Husband’s bank
statements for his UOB Account -892. The bank statements show transactions
made in Pakistan in April 2017, 58

These transaction patterns match the Husband’s version on his travelling to
these countries in search of a job. 66

##### Foot Note 66

×

HS-2 at para 34(d).

Strictly speaking, these transactions concerned leisure expenses such as
shopping, restaurant etc, and it is not self-evident that these expenses were
incurred in search of a job. However, I am willing to give the Husband the
benefit of the doubt, since the Husband’s efforts at re-connecting with his
old contacts in the industry would likely have taken place over a leisurely
setting. I also keep in mind that these expenses could be considered a
“necessity” insofar as they are incurred as part of the Husband’s pursuit for
a job. Exercising my discretion in a broad-brush manner, I am of the view that
the Husband was entitled to spend up to $40,000.00 on his overseas trips to
look for jobs (ie, $4,665.72 would be clawed back to the pool of matrimonial
assets).

(h) Concerning category 12, legal fees are generally not deducted from the
pool of matrimonial assets, lest any cost order rendered be made nugatory: AQT
v AQU [2011] SGHC 138 at [37]. Therefore, I do not accept that the expenses in
category 12 is validly incurred.

(i) Concerning category 13, the Husband stated that he paid for not just his
living expenses, but also the expenses of the Wife and the Children. 67

##### Foot Note 67

×

HS-2 at para 35.

He explained that in spite of his unemployment, living expenses remained high
because the family continued to maintain a high standard of living, 68

##### Foot Note 68

×

HS-2 at para 36.

and because the Husband wanted to entertain his ex-clients so as to maintain
good relationships with them. 69

##### Foot Note 69

×

HS-2 at para 37.

In my opinion, the Husband’s explanation corresponds with the evidence. The
bank account statements for UOB Account -892 showed numerous transactions in
family venues, such as Golden Village, Sentosa and McDonalds; the statements
also showed transactions in fine dining restaurants. However, even if the
Husband’s explanation stands up to scrutiny, there must nevertheless be a cap
on the amount that he could reasonably spend. Exercising my discretion in a
broad-brush manner, and keeping in mind the Husband’s employment history as
well as the family’s standard of living, I find the Husband should be allowed
to spend up to $150,000.00 on living expenses (ie, $15,000.00 would be clawed
back to the pool of matrimonial assets).

40 Accordingly, from the $1.2m retrenchment package, I claw back the following
sums:

Category| Description| Amount clawed back ($)  
---|---|---  
7| Holidays with relatives| 22,515.06  
8| Maintenance of children from his first marriage| 65,725.54  
10| Repayment of loans to Husband’s parents| 21,982.46  
11| Overseas trips to look for jobs| 4,665.72  
12| Legal fees| 96,061.98  
13| Living expenses| 15,000.00  
Total| 225,950.76  
  
41 In sum, $259,165.00 is to be clawed back in respect of the Husband’s CPF
money (see [36] above) and $225,950.76 is to be clawed back in respect of his
retrenchment package (see [40] above). I thus notionally add back $485,115.76
(being $225,950.76 + $295,950.76) back to the pool of matrimonial assets.

Disputed liabilities

42 The disputed liabilities are as follows:

S/N| Description  
---|---  
Husband’s Liabilities  
1| Income tax  
Wife’s Liabilities  
2| Loan from Wife’s parents  
3| Loan from brother  
4| Citibank loan  
5| Income tax  
  
43 I address the disputed liabilities in turn.

(1) Husband’s income tax

44 The Husband indicated in the JSRI that his income tax liability was
$175,882.30, 70

##### Foot Note 70

×

JSRI at p 16.

but later claimed that his income tax liability was reduced to $132,328.78. 71

##### Foot Note 71

×

Minute Sheet (31.10.2019) at p 10.

I accept his position, since the Husband’s reduced income tax liability will
benefit the Wife by increasing the Husband’s net assets available for
division.

(2) Loan from Wife’s parents

45 The Wife claimed that she has had to borrow $114,400.00 from her parents 72

##### Foot Note 72

×

JSRI at p 16.

to meet the family’s finances. 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

WAOM2 at para 68(b).

She has furnished, in support of her claims, some cheques issued from her
parents. 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

WAOM4 at pp 63, 76; WAOM1 at pp 56–77.

46 Gratuitous transfers from parents to children are presumed to be gifts and
not loans by virtue of the presumption of advancement: see [39(f)] above.
Therefore, the $114,400.00 will be presumptively treated as a gift from the
Wife’s parents, and not a liability. The Wife’s evidence in this regard was
limited to the copies of the cheques from her parents. 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

WAOM1 at para 34(a)(ii).

This, without more, merely shows that money was given from the Wife’s parents.
This does not show the nature of the money that was given. Therefore, the
presumption of gift has not been rebutted.

47 Since the $114,400.00 was a gift, it is not a valid liability. I therefore
decline to deduct the $114,400.00 from the Wife’s share of the matrimonial
assets. However, I note the Wife’s evidence that she has applied the
$144,400.00 towards family expenses, and will take this sum into consideration
when considering the Wife’s indirect financial contributions.

(3) Loan from Wife’s brother

48 The Wife claimed that she has had to borrow $52,000.00 from her brother 76

##### Foot Note 76

×

JSRI at p 16.

to buy a new car for the family. 77

##### Foot Note 77

WAOM4 at para 15.

In support of her claim, she furnished a promissory note entered into between
her and her brother for the aforementioned sum. 78

49 The promissory note was dated 15 August 2019. 79

##### Foot Note 79

This debt was thus incurred after the IJ date, which is the identification
date for matrimonial assets and liabilities. Nor was there evidence that the
$52,000.00 was received by the Wife and applied towards the purchase of the
new car. I therefore decline to deduct the sum of $52,000.00 from the pool of
matrimonial assets.

(4) Citibank loan

50 The Wife claimed that she has had to borrow $57,000.00 from Citibank. 80

##### Foot Note 80

×

JSRI at p 16.

In support of her claim, she furnished a letter from Citibank dated 6
September 2018. 81

51 It appears that the sum of $57,000.00 was given to the Wife on 27 August
2018. 82

##### Foot Note 82

×

WAOM4 at p 64.

This debt was thus incurred after the IJ date, which is the identification
date for matrimonial assets and liabilities. I therefore decline to deduct the
sum of $57,000.00 from the pool of matrimonial assets.

(5) Wife’s income tax

52 The Wife indicated in the JSRI that her income tax liability was
$43,979.64, 83

##### Foot Note 83

×

JSRI at p 16.

but later claimed that his income tax liability was reduced to $4,724.42. 84

##### Foot Note 84

×

Minute Sheet (31.10.2019) at p 10.

I accept her position, since the Wife’s reduced income tax liability will
benefit the Husband by increasing the Wife’s net assets available for
division.

Division

Direct contributions

54 The parties were in broad agreement that assets held in a party’s sole name
was financed by that party alone. The controversy concerned the parties’
direct contributions towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Home.

(1) The Matrimonial Home

55 The parties agreed on the extent of their mortgage payments between 2007
and 2015. 85

##### Foot Note 85

×

WS-1 at para 63; HS-2 at para 77.

They differed on how much they contributed in terms of the initial outlay and
the mortgage payments between June 2015 and June 2017.

(A) Initial outlay

56 The main controversy concerns a sum of $252,066.08 that the Husband
allegedly transferred to the Wife by way of cheque. The Husband claimed that
this sum represented his contributions towards the initial outlay. 86

##### Foot Note 86

×

HS-2 at para 68.

The Wife denied receiving such a sum.

57 The evidence showed that the Husband issued a cheque for $252,066.08 on 27
February 2007. 87

##### Foot Note 87

×

HAOM1 at p 271.

The Wife was ordered to disclose statements for her Standard Chartered bank
account for February 2017, but the statements disclosed only went up to 17
February 2017. 88

##### Foot Note 88

×

Husband’s Supplementary Affidavit (20.11.2019) (“HAOM5”) at p 57.

The Wife then furnished an email from Standard Chartered stating that the
Wife’s bank account statements for February 2007 cannot be retrieved. 89

##### Foot Note 89

×

Wife’s Affidavit (30.10.2019) (“WAOM6”) at p 35.

58 On the evidence, I accept the Husband’s position. The cheque sum, when
combined with the Husband’s other payment that was proven, lends credence to
his position that the Husband and the Wife would each be responsible for half
of the initial outlays. 90

##### Foot Note 90

×

HS-2 at paras 67–68.

The evidential burden thus shifted to the Wife to show that the cheque was not
issued to her, by showing her bank account statements. That she failed to do.

59 Accordingly, I deduct the sum of $252,066.08 from the Wife’s actual
contributions towards the initial outlays of $630,232.15. I add this sum to
the Husband’s actual contributions of $126,400.00.

(B) Mortgage payments from 1 June 2015 to 31 June 2017

60 According to the Husband, $7,300.00 out of the money he sent the Wife
monthly should be treated as his contributions towards the mortgage payments
because he earmarked the $7,300.00 specifically for this purpose. 91

##### Foot Note 91

×

HS-2 at para 78.

The Wife explained that this $7,300.00pm needed to be applied towards
household expenses instead, since the money given from the Husband to the Wife
specifically for household expenses was not sufficient. 92

##### Foot Note 92

×

WS-1 at

61 In my view, the Wife should not be allowed to use the $7,300.00 for a
purpose different from what was intended by the Husband. If the Husband truly
did not provide enough for the Wife and Children between 2015 and 2017, the
Wife should have commenced proceedings for interim maintenance then, instead
of waiting until January 2018 to commence interim maintenance proceedings.

62 I therefore accept that the $7,300.00pm should be treated as the Husband’s
contributions towards the mortgage payments. From 1 June 2015 to 31 June 2017
(25 months), this amounts to a total of $182,500.00. I add this sum to the
Husband’s contributions for the period from 1 June 2015 to 1 July 2017.
However, I do not deduct this sum from the Wife’s contributions for the same
period, since the fact remains that she did apply her CPF money towards
discharging the mortgage loan. In other words, the Husband’s direct
contributions for this period will be increased by $182,500.00, while the
Wife’s direct contributions remain the same at $204,923.63.

(C) Mortgage payments from 1 July 2017 to 28 February 2018

63 The determination of the parties’ contributions ought not be limited to 31
June 2017. A spouse’s contributions ought to be considered up to the point
where the marriage continues to “[exist] in any meaningful sense”: UWL v UWM
[2019] SGHCF 17 at [42]–[44]. This generally refers to the IJ date, which in
this case was 6 March 2018. Therefore, the parties’ contributions towards
mortgage payments from 1 July 2017 to end February 2018 (another 8 months)
should be taken into account as well.

64 For this period, the Wife applied $15,945.80 of her CPF money towards
discharging the mortgage loan. 93

##### Foot Note 93

×

WAOM2 at pp 98–101.

I count this as the Wife’s contributions. However, the Husband was still
providing the Wife the monthly sum of $7,300.00 to pay for the mortgage loan
for this period. I therefore also add $58,400.00 (being $7,300.00pm x 8) to
the Husband’s contributions for this period.

(D) Summary

65 The parties' contributions towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Home
is as follows:

| Wife’s Contributions($)| Husband’s Contributions($)  
---|---|---  
Initial outlay| 378,166.07| 378,466.08  
Mortgage payments from 1 April 2007 to 31 May 2015| 289,484.15| 618,000.00

66 The parties’ overall contributions are as follows:

| Wife’s Contributions($)| Husband’s Contributions($)  
---|---|---  
Matrimonial Home| 1,660,875.10| 2,322,960.67

##### Foot Note 95

×

WS-1 at para 76.

68 Having considered the evidence, I am of the view that both parties have
made substantial indirect financial contributions. Beginning with the Wife,
she furnished evidence of her spending on the renovations of the Matrimonial
Home when it was purchased. 96

##### Foot Note 96

×

WAOM2 at para 54(a) and pp 423–493.

The Husband himself recognised that the parties made roughly equal
contributions since they moved into the Matrimonial Home until the Wife quit
her job in 2012. 97

##### Foot Note 97

×

HS-1 in para 200.

Turning to the Husband, it was not disputed that the Wife stopped contributing
to the household expenses since October 2012, when she left her job. 98

##### Foot Note 98

×

WAOM2 at para 55.

Regardless of how the Wife lost her job, the fact remains that the Husband
contributed the bulk of family expenses from this point onwards until the
marriage has broken down. Nevertheless, the Wife did appear to have applied
some of her own money towards family expenses (see [47] above). Taking a
broad-based view of the entire marriage, it appears to me that both parties
have made substantial indirect financial contributions. It is thus impractical
to embark on a comparison of which party has contributed more in this regard.

69 In relations to non-financial contributions, I am of the view that the Wife
has put in more effort compared to the Husband. The Wife was a full-time
housewife between 2012 and 2017. It follows that she would have been more
involved in raising the Children. The Husband did not appear to deny the fact
that the Wife was the one who took charge of the Children’s welfare. 99

##### Foot Note 99

×

HS-1 at para 208.

However, I am not of the view that the Wife’s non-financial contributions
“vastly outweigh” 100

##### Foot Note 100

×

WS-1 at para 73.

the Husband’s. The Husband did make time to interact with the Children, and
did take part in household chores whenever possible.

70 In sum, both parties have made substantial indirect financial
contributions, and it is in my view not feasible to make a comparison on whose
contributions was greater. In terms of non-financial contributions, however,
it could be reasonably concluded that the Wife has put in greater effort – but
this in no way meant that the Husband has been derelict in his familial
duties.

71 Based on my observations above, and exercising my discretion in a broad-
brush manner, I arrive at an indirect contributions ratio of 40:60 between the
Husband and the Wife.

Overall contributions

72 In the present case, there is no compelling reason to depart from the
general position that direct and indirect contributions are given equal
weightage.

73 The parties’ average contributions ratio is as follows:

| Wife| Husband  
---|---|---  
Direct contributions| 0.32| 0.68  
Indirect contributions| 0.60| 0.40  
Average | 0.46| 0.54  
  
74 I make a further adjustment to the average ratio to take into account the
UK Pension (see [34] above) and arrive at a final division ratio of 48:52
between the Wife and the Husband.

Apportionment

75 There is agreement between the parties that the Wife should take over the
Husband’s share of the Matrimonial Home. I therefore make an order for the
Wife to buy over the Husband’s share in the Matrimonial Home. However, I note
that the valuation of the Matrimonial Home was rather dated. Further, I take
judicial notice of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pandemic’s impact on the
property market. Accordingly, I am of the view that for the purposes of
apportionment (and only for this purpose), there should be a revaluation of
the Matrimonial Home, and the Wife shall buy the Husband’s share of the
Matrimonial Home based on this revaluation (at 0.52 x the revaluation value).
The costs of the revaluation shall be borne equally by the parties. If the
Wife is unable to buy over the Husband’s share within six months after the
date of this judgment, the Matrimonial Home will be sold, and the net proceeds
of sale will be divided between the parties in the proportions of 48:52
between the Wife and the Husband.

76 I turn to the assets held in the parties’ sole name, the aggregate value of
which is $3,089,934.87. Using the division ratio of 48:52, this translates to
$1,483,168.74 for the Wife and $1,606,766.13 for the Husband. To arrive at
this division, the Husband is to transfer to the Wife $851,841.10 (being
$2,458,607.23 - $1,606,766.13). The transfer is to take place at the same time
of the transfer of the Matrimonial Home to the Wife, or the completion of the
sale of the Matrimonial Home, as the case may be.

Custody and access

Custody

77 The Wife submitted that no order of custody should be made, while the
Husband submitted that there should be an order for joint custody.

78 Practically speaking, there is little (if any) difference between a “no
custody order” and a “joint custody order”: CX v CY (minor: custody and
access) [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690 (“CX”) at [18]. In either case, both parents
continue to exercise custody over their children. Nevertheless, in cases where
there is a dispute between the parents over the children’s upbringing, a joint
custody order may be preferable: CX at [19].

79 In the present case, I am of the view that a joint custody order should be
made. There is a dispute concerning the Children’s education, with the Wife
insisting that the Children continue their education in an international
school in Singapore and the Husband arguing that a local school would be more
than sufficient. This disagreement on the choice of schooling for the Children
is clearly a dispute concerning the Children’s upbringing, as education is
also a matter falling within a parent’s custodial power (CX at [33]). In the
circumstances, I am of the opinion that a joint custody order will be more
appropriate, since it will be a reminder that both parties have a say over the
Children’s education.

80 This brings me to the dispute concerning the Children’s education. The Wife
submitted that the Children should be allowed to continue studying in an
international school where they are thriving, and to transfer them elsewhere
would be disruptive. 101

##### Foot Note 101

×

WS-1 at paras 10–12.

The Husband submitted that the Children should study in local schools instead,
which are just as good as international schools but cheaper. 102

##### Foot Note 102

×

HS-1 at para 79.

Regard must be had to the reasonable views of the Husband, who is also a
custodial parent. As a result, while the Wife is entitled to continue
enrolling the Children in the international school, the Husband will not be
made to bear the financial burdens of such a decision. I deal with this
further below when assessing the maintenance of the Children.

Access

81 The parties also disagreed on the Husband’s access terms. The Wife
submitted that the access terms must “accord with the Children’s wishes”, 103

##### Foot Note 103

×

WS-1 at para 22.

which I interpret to mean that the Husband should not be allowed access to the
Children if the Children does not want to meet the Husband. The Husband
understandably disagreed. 104

##### Foot Note 104

×

HS-2 at para 15.

82 I accept the Husband’s position. It is in the best interests of a child for
him to maintain links with both of his parents (see UYK v UYJ [2020] SGHCF 9
at [65]). The Children, being young, may not appreciate the importance of
maintaining the links with the Husband, and thus it is not in their best
interest to allow the Husband access only when the Children feel like meeting
him. Moreover, the Husband has moved out of the Matrimonial Home and away from
the Children since as early as 2012. The Children would thus have necessarily
became somewhat estranged from the Husband, and there is a real possibility
that the Children would be unwilling to meet with him. In the circumstances,
to subject the Husband’s access to the Children’s wishes would not help
improve their relationship. Any concerns about the Children being afraid of
the Husband 105

##### Foot Note 105

×

WS-1 at para 28.

can be addressed by making access supervised, where necessary.

83 Accordingly, I set out the following access terms:

(a) The Husband shall have video access twice a week. Keeping in mind the
7-hour difference in time zone, I am of the view that the three access
sessions should take place on Friday and Sunday every week, between 7.00 pm to
7.30 pm Singapore time (ie 12.00 pm to 12.30 pm UK time). The duration of each
session takes into account the attention span of a child of the Child’s age
and can be increased as they grow older. Setting access at fixed timings would
also prevent any potential conflict between the Husband and the Wife on
scheduling. The Husband is to give advance notice by 11.59 pm Singapore time
(or 4 pm UK time) the previous day if he is not exercising his right to video
access. The Wife is to give advance notice of 3 hours if the Children are
unavailable for video access, and shall provide make-up access the next day at
the same time. The first three video access sessions shall be supervised, and
the fourth video access session onwards shall be unsupervised.

(b) The Husband shall have three weeks of physical access during the
Children’s summer vacation if they continue to attend international schools,
or three weeks of physical access during the Children’s year-end holidays
should they attend public schools. Given the ages of the Children, the Wife
would have to accompany the Children if they are to go to the UK. Between the
Wife and Children travelling to UK to meet the Husband, and the Husband
travelling to Singapore to meet the Children, I am of the view that the latter
arrangement is preferable. The Husband is to give the Wife a month’s notice
before flying to Singapore so that parties have time to discuss the itinerary.
However, I take judicial notice of the current travel restrictions imposed by
the Singapore government in respect of foreign travellers. Therefore, physical
access is to commence only when the travel restrictions have been lifted.
Parties can make mutual arrangements for the Children to visit the UK after
2021.

(i) When the Husband is travelling to Singapore, the Husband is to bear the
travel expenses by himself. For the time being, when the Children are not able
to travel by themselves and the Wife will need to accompany them to the UK,
the travel expenses for the Wife and the Children are to be borne by the Wife
and the Husband in equal measures. However, the Husband will be liable for no
more than $4,000.00 in travel expenses. Once the Children are able to travel
to the UK by themselves, the Husband shall bear the Children’s travel expenses
by himself (for the avoidance of doubt, if the Wife wishes to accompany the
Children even though the Children can travel by themselves, the Wife shall
bear her own expenses).

(ii) Considering that the Children have been, and continue to be, somewhat
estranged from the Husband, the first physical access session after this
issuance of this judgment will be supervised. Subsequent physical access
sessions will be unsupervised. It is therefore to the interests of parties to
work together, for the sake of the Children, to encourage the bonding between
the Children and the Husband on every possible occasion until then.

Maintenance

Children

84 The Wife submitted that the Husband should be solely responsible for the
Children’s monthly expenses, estimated by the Wife to be $27,000.00pm. 106

##### Foot Note 106

×

WS-1 at para 114.

This sum is an aggregate of the Children’s share of the maid, car and
household expenses, as well as their personal expenses.

85 Beginning with the maid expenses, I can accept that Children’s share of
such expenses at $291.09pm per person 107

##### Foot Note 107

×

WAOM2 at p 562.

is reasonable.

86 Turning to the car expenses, I am of the view that the car expenses is more
appropriately characterised as the part of the Wife’s expenses, and not the
Children’s. While the Wife would undoubtedly use the car to ferry the Children
around, I am convinced that the Wife’s personal use of the car would still be
dominant.

87 With regard to the household expenses, the food expenses of $4,300.00pm is
in my view on the high side. A more reasonable quantum to incur would be
$3,600.00pm (or $1,200.00pm per person). Therefore, the reasonable monthly
household expenses would be $2,174.16pm per person (being $2,407.49 (which is
the Wife’s claimed household expenses) 108

##### Foot Note 108

×

WAOM2 at p 565.

\- $1,433.33 (the Wife’s claimed food expenses) + $1,200.00).

88 I now deal with the Children’s personal expenses. First, the school fees
and school-related expenses at $8,012.00pm 109

##### Foot Note 109

×

WAOM2 at p 565, S/Ns 33–34.

for both Children are on the high side. As mentioned above at [80], the
Husband has a say over the Children’s education. The views of the Husband in
wanting to enrol the Children in local schools are not unreasonable. I
therefore lower the reasonable amount of school fees and school-related
expenses to $1,500.00pm for both Children. For the avoidance of doubt, this is
separate from the tuition expenses of $814.00pm for both Children, which I am
of the view is reasonable. If the Wife insists that the Children attend
international schools, she would have to bear the additional expenses above
the $1,500.00pm for both Children herself.

89 Secondly, the hobbies and tours and family outings expenses for both
Children at $2,897.40pm and $1,666.00pm are on the high side. In my view, the
reasonable hobbies expenses for both Children ought to be no more than
$1,000.00pm, and the tours and family outing expenses for both Children no
more than $750.00pm.

90 Third, the childcare expenses of $2,500.00pm, which concern travelling fees
and food expenses, is in my view overlapping with the household expenses 110

##### Foot Note 110

WAOM2 at p 560, S/N 1.

and the Children’s transport expenses. 111

##### Foot Note 111

×

WAOM2 at p 565, S/N 44.

I thus lower the amount of reasonable childcare expenses to $250.00pm for both
Children. Likewise, the furniture expenses also overlap with the household
expenses. 112

##### Foot Note 112

×

WAOM2 at p 560, S/N 4.

I thus lower the amount of reasonable furniture expenses to $200.00pm for both
Children.

91 Fourth, the entertainment expenses of $354.00pm for both Children is in my
view inflated. I lower the quantum of reasonable entertainment expenses to
$200.00 for both Children.

92 Lastly, the miscellaneous expenses at $674.00pm for both Children is in my
view inflated. I lower the quantum of reasonable miscellaneous expenses to
$350.00pm for both Children.

93 Accordingly, the Children’s reasonable personal expenses are as follows:

S/N| Description| Quantum ($)  
---|---|---  
1| School fees and school-related expenses| 1,500.00  
2| Pocket money | 280.00  
3| School snacks| 200.00  
4| Medical/Dental| 559.00  
5| Enrichment/Tuition| 814.00  
6| Hobbies/Sports| 1,000.00  
7| Tours and family outings| 750.00  
8| Insurance| 306.00  
9| Transport| 100.00  
10| Childcare| 250.00  
11| Clothing | 284.00  
12| Stemcord fees| 25.00  
13| Electronics/Toys| 318.00  
14| Furniture| 200.00  
15| Entertainment| 200.00  
16| Miscellaneous| 350.00  
Total| 7,086.00  
  
94 The Children’s reasonable monthly expenses would be as follows:

S/N| Description| Quantum ($)  
---|---|---  
1| Children’s personal expenses| 7,086.00  
2| Children’s shares of household expenses| 4,348.32(2,174.16 x 2)  
3| Children’s shares of maid expenses| 582.18(291.09 x 2)  
Total| 12,016.50  
  
95 I note that the Husband claimed that his current income is only
$10,089.47pm. 113

##### Foot Note 113

In support of his claim, he furnished pay slips showing that his monthly take-
home income was GBP6,076.00. 114

However, as the Wife pointed out in her second Affidavit of Assets and Means,
the Husband’s remuneration consists of not just salary but also four
additional discretionary bonus payments. 115

##### Foot Note 115

WAOM2 at para 77.

(This was not addressed by the Husband in his third Affidavit of Assets and
Means). Nevertheless, I take judicial notice of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its
potential effect on the discretionary components of the Husband’s income. In
my view, the Husband should only be responsible for three-quarters of the
Children’s reasonable expenses, ie $9,000.00pm. This order for maintenance of
the Children can be varied once the Wife finds employment.

Wife

96 I now consider the Wife’s maintenance. She claimed maintenance of
$14,123.84pm. 116

##### Foot Note 116

×

WAOM2 at p 565.

Having looked at the Wife’s claimed personal expenses, I am of the view that
they are rather inflated. I have excluded tithing/donations and parent-related
expenses, which are personal to the Wife in nature, and should no longer be
borne by the Husband after the marriage ends. I have also excluded income tax
as the Wife has ceased employment. I set out a tabulation of the Wife’s
reasonable personal expenses below:

S/N| Description| Quantum ($)  
---|---|---  
1| Medical/Dental/Physiotherapy| 500.00  
2 | Personal upkeep| 500.00  
3| Clothing| 500.00  
4| Sports| 300.00  
5| Facial/Manicures| 200.00  
6| Entertainment| 500.00  
7| Magazines| 25.00  
8| Insurance | 657.00  
9| Others | 616.00  
10| Travel| 300.00  
Total| 4,098.00  
  
97 I turn to the Wife’s claimed car expenses, which is in my view also rather
inflated. I accept the Husband’s valuation of the car expenses, at
$2,669.97pm. 117

##### Foot Note 117

×

HS-1 at p 68.

98 The Wife’s reasonable monthly expenses would be as follows:

S/N| Description| Quantum ($)  
---|---|---  
1| Personal expenses| 4,098.00  
2 | Car expenses| 2,669.97  
3| Wife’s share of household expenses| 2,174.16  
4| Wife’s share of maid expenses| 291.09  
Total | 9,233.22  
  
99 The Wife is currently unemployed. Even then, the Husband should not be made
wholly responsible for the Wife’s monthly expenses. While the Children cannot
be expected to provide for themselves, the Wife can be expected to do so. (As
mentioned above in [6], the Wife was able to obtain a new job in a new
industry after five years of being out of the workforce for a salary of about
$11,000.00pm). In my view, the Husband should only be responsible for
$4,000.00 out of the $9,683.22 of the Wife’s reasonable monthly expenses.

100 I agree with the Wife that an award for lump-sum maintenance should be
given, since it will ensure a clean break in at least one area between the
parties. The Wife submitted that the multiplier should be four years. 118

##### Foot Note 118

×

WS-1 at para 108.

I am of the view that this multiplier is too generous, since the Wife can, and
ought to, find employment within four years, given her employment history.
That being said, I do take judicial notice of the COVID-19 pandemic and its
effect on the economy. Accordingly, a multiplier of 24 months would be in my
view appropriate. The Husband should thus pay the Wife a lump-sum award of
$96,000.00 (being $4,000.00 x 24).

Conclusion

101 In sum, the Wife is to buy over the Husband’s 52% share of the Matrimonial
Home based on the new valuation of the same. If the Wife is unable to buy over
the Husband’s share within six months after the date of this judgment, the
Matrimonial Home will be sold, and the net proceeds of sale will be divided
between the parties in the proportions of 48:52 between the Wife and the
Husband The Husband, in turn, is to give the Wife a sum of $851,841.10 in
respect of the matrimonial assets and a further lump sum of $96,000.00 in
respect of maintenance of the Wife. The transfer of the $851,841.10 is to take
place at the same time of the transfer of the Matrimonial Home to the Wife, or
the completion of the sale of the Matrimonial Home, as the case may be. The
transfer of the $96,000.00 is to take place one month from the date of this
judgment.

102 The Husband is also to give the Wife $9,000.00pm for maintenance of the
Children with effect from the date of this judgment. The Husband can apply for
a variation of the maintenance order once the Wife has found employment.
