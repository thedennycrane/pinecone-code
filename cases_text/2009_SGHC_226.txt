Choo Han Teck J:

1 This is an appeal against the learned District Judge’s (“DJ”) decision of 16
July 2009 whereby the appellant, who had pleaded guilty to two charges of
forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
1985 Rev Ed), was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on each charge. The
sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The DJ noted that the facts are
sufficiently unique and warrant a lenient sentence but he might have felt
constrained in deciding what the appropriate lenient sentence should be. I am
of the view that the sentence of 12 months imprisonment was manifestly
excessive and that an appropriate sentence should be two months imprisonment
for each charge.

2 The offences were committed in March and April 2007. The appellant is the
wife of the complainant, Lim Chin Foong. She had misappropriated funds from
the complainant’s joint fixed deposit accounts with his mother by forging the
complainant’s signature on bank documents. Four other charges relating to the
forgery of the complainant’s signature on three insurance policy surrender
requests and a letter in respect of a fixed deposit account were taken into
consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The total amount misappropriated
by the appellant came to S$152,453.22. The appellant used the money to settle
personal debts and other expenses.

3 The appellant has no previous convictions for any offence. She claimed, and
the learned DJ acknowledged, that some of the misappropriated monies went into
meeting expenses jointly incurred by the complainant and the appellant.

4 The appellant had pleaded guilty and confessed her intention to deceive the
banks. When confronted by the complainant prior to his making a police report,
she had confessed and offered to compensate him although she was unable to do
so immediately. The appellant eventually entered into an agreement with both
the complainant and the complainant’s mother in which she agreed to forgo her
right to claim maintenance for their one-year old child if she was not
required to make restitution. The learned DJ was of the view that the
complainant’s mother was the real victim in this case as the monies
represented her life savings and the agreement reached would be of poor
comfort to her. While that may be true, the settlement agreement that the
mother consented to was not utterly without comfort to her. It would not be
productive to speculate the precise nature of this comfort save to note that,
the mother’s loss was not, in itself, sufficient to impose a custodial
sentence of 12 months on the facts of this unusual case. For that reason, the
sentence here would not be a general precedent.
