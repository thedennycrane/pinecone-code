**Judgment:**

1\. There were two appeals before me from decisions of the assistant registrar
below. The first was an appeal by the defendant against the dismissal of his
application to strike out the plaintiff’s claim. The second was an appeal by
the plaintiff against the assistant registrar’s order granting unconditional
leave to the defendant to defend.The facts and issues were enmeshed and,
consequently, the appeals were dealt with conveniently, at the same time.

2\. The plaintiff is a Canadian registered company. Germain Gauthier was a
shareholder and director of the plaintiff company. On 25 April 1995 the
plaintiff loaned a sum of C$350,000 to a Singapore company called Wiraco in
which Germain Gauthier’s son, Pierre, was a shareholder and director. The
defendant’s wife was also a shareholder and director of Wiraco. One month
prior to the loan the defendant signed a letter (dated 20 March 1995)
addressed to Germain Gauthier stating that:

> "In consideration of your agreement to extend a loan of C$350,000 to WIRACO,
> I Hong Pian Tee (hereinafter known as "P.T.Hong") I/C No: 0274819/C of 48
> Leedon Road, Singapore 1026, hereby irrevocably guarantee the due payment of
> the said sum of C$350,000 upon expiry of 24 months from the date of the
> loan.
>
> Though I am surety only for WIRACO yet as between us, I shall be deemed to
> be the principal debtor for the monies extended by you, the payment of which
> is hereby guaranteed and accordingly, I confirm that my obligation shall not
> be affected or diminished in any way by any act or omission by WIRACO."

3\. When the Wiraco did not make payment the plaintiff sued the defendant in
the Superior Court of Montreal in Canada to recover the debt. The defendant
challenged the jurisdiction of that court but his challenge was dismissed.
There was no appeal against that order by the defendant. After a three-day
trial in which the defendant appeared and contested the claim, the court found
in favour of the plaintiff and granted judgment in its favour. The defendant
appealed, but was unsuccessful.

4\. The enforcement of foreign judgment statutes in Singapore are inapplicable
to the present case because the Canadian court was not a scheduled court under
our legislation concerning the enforcement of foreign judgments. The plaintiff
was therefore, obliged to commence a writ action against the defendant based
on the Canadian judgment for the purposes of enforcement. Having done so, it
applied for a summary judgment. Assistant registrar Vivian Wong, allowed the
application and gave judgment against the defendant. The appeal by the
defendant went before a judge in chambers on 29 August 2000. There is no
record of any argument before the court, but the orders of the court were,
however, extracted by the defendant and reads as follows:

> "1. The judgment of the learned assistant registrar Ms. Vivian Wong given on
> 14 August 2000 be set aside/reversed with no order as to costs.
>
> 2\. Leave be granted to the Plaintiffs to amend their Statement of Claim and
> to file a fresh Order 14 application.
>
> 3\. The Defendant undertakes not to object to the Plaintiffs’ fresh Order 14
> application, save on merits.
>
> 4\. By consent, there be no order as to costs on the amendments to the
> Statement of Claim."

There is a minor oddity of no great significance but it ought to be mentioned
nonetheless. The first order of the judge was minuted as "The judgment of the
learned assistant registrar Ms. Vivian Wong given on 14 August 2000 be set
aside with no order as to costs." However, the extracted copy approved by both
parties included the word "reversed" as an alternative, and appearing next to
the words "set aside".

5\. Mr. Sivakumar, counsel for the plaintiff, stated that counsel for the
defendant began his submission by saying that a letter of guarantee dated 20
March 1995 was not pleaded and therefore the claim was inadequate. The judge
then made the above orders after suggesting to Mr. Sivakumar that the
plaintiff amends its statement of claim by setting out the underlying contract
and not merely relying on having obtained the Canadian judgment. The plaintiff
subsequently did so, and consequently, filed a fresh application for summary
judgment. The hearing before the judge in chambers on 29 August 2000 is
relevant because an issue arose as to whether the plaintiff is precluded from
relying on the Canadian judgment in its appeal before me. Counsel for the
defendant, Mr. Manjit Singh submitted that when a judge had already
adjudicated and reversed an order for summary judgment made by an assistant
registrar no appeal is permissible under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act.
I shall revert to this submission shortly.

6\. In the meantime, on 29 January 2001, the defendant applied before
assistant registrar Tan Boon Heng to strike out the amended claim on the
ground that it disclosed no cause of action. The defendant’s case was that the
letter of guarantee of 20 March 1995 was issued by the defendant to Germain
Gauthier and not the plaintiff. Mr. Sivakumar then successfully applied to
adjourn the striking out hearing and obtained leave to make further amendments
the statement of claim. This time, the plaintiff amended the claim to include
the reference to a loan document dated 25 April 1995 which was not referred to
in this suit, but was the subject matter of the trial in Canada.

7\. The application to strike out was reinstated for hearing after the
amendments were made. The striking out and order 14 applications were heard by
the assistant registrar Toh Han Li who dismissed the defendant’s application
to strike out. AR Toh who also dismissed the plaintiff’s application for
summary judgment and granted unconditional leave to the defendant to defend.
The appeals before me concern the abovesaid decisions of the assistant
registrar Toh.

8\. Mr. Manjit Singh submitted before me that the re-amended statement of
claim still discloses no cause of action because there was no privity of
contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. The loan document of 25
April 1995 was signed by the plaintiff as the lender, WIRACO as the borrower,
and the defendant described only as "a private individual". For the reasons
appearing below I do not consider this argument as having any significance,
but in any event, clause 3 of the agreement provided as follows:

> "3. The Borrower hereby represents and warrants as follows:
>

>> (c) if the Borrower is unable to fulfil all or part of its obligations
towards the Lender, the obligations relating to this loan shall be fully
guaranteed and assumed by [the defendant] … as evidenced in a deed of
obligation signed by [the defendant] on March 20, 1995 with respect to the
loan to be granted, a copy whereof is annexed hereto as Schedule ‘B’."

There was no dispute that the defendant was a signatory to the 25 April 1995
loan agreement.

9\. I shall put aside for the time being the point that this was an action on
a foreign judgment and that the plaintiff was suing on the judgment itself. In
my view, even if the plaintiff was suing on the original cause of action the
pleadings do disclose a reasonable cause of action. On the material before me,
I am of the view that the pleadings should not be disturbed by the court at
this stage. Both parties must be entitled to test the issue of whether there
was any liability by the defendant to the plaintiff arising from the documents
cited in the statement of claim. Therefore, whether there was privity of
contract is a substantive defence and if pleaded, is a matter for trial. Thus,
the defendant’s appeal against the assistant registrar’s dismissal of the
striking out application by the defendant fails and is therefore dismissed. My
decision in respect of this appeal will, however, be of no practical
importance in view of my decision in respect of the plaintiff’s appeal.

10\. I now turn to Mr. Sivakumar’s appeal against the assistant registrar’s
order granting unconditional leave to the defendant to defend. If counsel
relied on the case as amended then it must follow, from my decision above
(that there are sufficiently pleaded issues for trial), that the plaintiff’s
appeal must also be dismissed. However, Mr. Sivakumar sought to advance the
argument that the plaintiff is entitled to rely solely on the Canadian
judgment. Mr. Manjit challenged its right to do so because he said that that
argument was the only one available to the plaintiff in its first application
for summary judgment. On the strength of that argument, the assistant
registrar Wong granted judgment, but that judgment, Mr. Manjit pointed out,
was "set aside/reversed" by the judge in chambers.

11\. Mr. Manjit objected to this appeal before me on the ground that this
issue was closed on 29 August 2000 when the judge "set aside/reversed" the
assistant registrar Wong’s summary judgment. Mr. Sivakumar’s point before me
was that the judge did not hear his submission on the issue and therefore I am
free to consider it afresh. Mr. Manjit conceded that at the hearing before the
judge in chambers Mr. Sivakumar did not present his submission, but he argued
that nonetheless, technically, there is an order reversing an order for
summary judgment and, it must follow that unconditional leave to defend must
have been given implicitly even though the orders of court did not explicitly
say so. Counsel’s argument was that as a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction, I
cannot overrule the previous decision, and there being no right of appeal
against an order granting unconditional leave to defend, the plaintiff’s
appeal must necessarily be dismissed. Ordinarily, that must be correct; but
this case is unusual. First, the plaintiff’s counsel did not present his
arguments through no fault of his. Secondly, there was no specific order that
there be unconditional leave to defend. Such leave cannot be implied in this
case not only on account of the foregoing point, but also because the judge
specifically granted leave to the plaintiff to amend its pleadings (I note
counsel’s point that he did not make an application to amend) and file a fresh
application for summary judgment to which it was recorded that the defendant
undertakes not to object. These two further orders must be taken into
consideration because, ordinarily, if a summary judgment is set aside, no
further orders would be necessary other than ancillary orders such as the
granting of conditional or unconditional leave to defend. In either case,
there would be no necessity to grant leave to amend the pleadings or to file a
fresh summary judgment application. A plaintiff who desires to amend his
pleadings is always entitled to make the necessary application to do so. In
this case, the plaintiff did not think it necessary to make any amendment and
so it seems to me, therefore, unfair if it was to be denied the opportunity of
presenting its argument based on the Canadian judgment just because it was
directed to amend some other parts of its claim. The plaintiff was entitled at
law to present its argument twice – once before an assistant registrar and
once before a judge in chambers. It had only one shot thus far.

12\. Mr. Manjit also submitted that the effect of the judge’s order "setting
aside/reversing" the assistant registrar’s order granting summary judgment is
that the defendant must have been given unconditional leave to defend since in
setting aside the order no conditions were imposed. That there can be no
appeal against a judge’s decision granting unconditional leave to defend is a
statutory provision under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. I accept that
there is no exception to that provision; and I cannot even invoke any inherent
powers of the court in aid. And yet, there is every compelling reason why the
plaintiff must be permitted to raise the argument it did not raise before at
this level, that is, before a judge in chambers (through no fault of his).
Without guidance from any notes of arguments or the reasons for the decision,
and there being no specific order granting unconditional leave to defend, I
find myself hearing the case afresh, unencumbered, and unhindered.

13\. I now come to the gravamen of the plaintiff’s application for summary
judgment, and that is whether the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the
strength of the Canadian judgment. Mr. Manjit argued that the plaintiff is not
entitled to judgment here unless the "underlying basis" of the foreign
judgment is pleaded and tried in the Singapore courts. He submitted that
neither the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act ("RECJA") Ch.
264 nor the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act ("REFJA") Ch. 265
applied in this case so as to enable the plaintiff to merely register its
Canadian judgment. Mr. Sivakumar disagrees. Mr. Manjit further submitted that
when a foreign judgment is not registrable under either of the above statutes
they cannot rely on the benefit of the "conclusive effect" provisions. It is,
however, in my judgment, too vast a leap to say that it thus follows that the
plaintiff with a foreign judgment in hand must re-litigate all over again in
Singapore. The law in this regard is straightforward and I need only recite
1007 of Halsbury’s Laws of England, vol. 8, 4th edition to emphasize the
point:

> "1007. Foreign judgment generally conclusive. Subject to certain exceptions,
> a judgment in personam of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction which is
> final and conclusive on their merits is conclusive in England between
> parties and privies as to any issue upon which it adjudicates. It is not
> impeachable or examinable on the merits, whether for error of fact or of
> law.
>
> It has, however, been held that a foreign judgment will not be recognised if
> it shows on its fact a perverse and deliberate refusal to apply generally
> accepted doctrines of private international law. In the interest of
> international comity English courts will recognise the validity of the
> decisions of foreign arbitration tribunals whose competence is derived from
> international law or practice.
>
> Although every presumption is to be made in favour of a foreign judgment,
> and the burden of proof lies on the party who seeks to impeach it, such a
> judgment may be impeached on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, or
> that its recognition or enforcement would be contrary to public policy, or
> that it was obtained in proceedings which were contrary to natural or
> substantial justice."

In this case, the defendant not only challenged the jurisdiction of the
Canadian court (in Canada) but also the correctness of the Canadian trial
judge’s decision by filing an appeal that was duly heard and dismissed. The
defendant was also represented by counsel in the Canadian proceedings. There
is therefore no ground for the courts here to re-hear the case on its merits
(which is what Mr. Manjit is saying we ought to do). It is pointless,
therefore, to plead the underlying cause of action in this suit because that
is only relevant for the purpose of determining the issues for trial, which,
in this case, is unwarranted as the only issue is whether the judgment in
Canada was properly obtained. I set out the exposition of law from Halsbury’s
Laws of England because it represents the position of the common law in
respect of the rules of private international law concerning the enforcement
of foreign judgments. If litigants here expect that a judgment of the
Singapore courts on the merits will be respected in a foreign jurisdiction
that abides by the rules of private international law that I referred to above
(or similar rules) then the courts here ought to do likewise. The position
that Mr. Sivakumar takes which finds my approval is not a novel one. It is
well defined and based on time-honoured affirmation in cases such as _Ralli v
Anguilla_ [1915-1923] XV SSLR 33 where the principle that a foreign judgment
creates a new and independent obligation distinct from that of the underlying
or original cause of action is reiterated. In this instance, the plaintiff is
suing on a debt – a judgment debt. Correspondingly, the defence will have to
be based on the premise that there was no such debt, as for instance, the
judgment was in respect of some other defendant, or was falsely obtained. To
say that there is no debt because the foreign court would not have created
that debt had the merits been properly argued or that the court of this forum
would have decided otherwise is untenable because that is a defence on the
merits of the original cause of action. If the original cause of action has
not merged with the judgment the courts would allow the plaintiff to sue in
the alternative but if it had, suing on the judgment done is sufficient.

14\. Mr. Manjit raised the point that the Canadian judgment was improperly
obtained because of the fraudulent conduct of the plaintiff in failing to
disclose to the Canadian court that the letter of 20 March 1995 was addressed
to Germain Gautier and not the plaintiff. However, as I had noted above, the
text of that letter was incorporated into the loan agreement and signed there
by the defendant. The more important point, however, is that this issue ought
to have been raised at the Canadian trial. Mr. Sivakumar submitted that it
was, in fact, there raised, but even if it was not, a Singapore court is not
the proper place to raise it. I agree with him. It is inappropriate for either
party to have a second opportunity to re-litigate the Canadian action here.
Thus, for these reasons the authorities, including some of my own decisions
such as _Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft v Lim Kee Ban Heng Pte Ltd_ ,
unreported, cited by Mr. Manjit for the proposition that no evidence is
admissible to contradict the letter of guarantee, are not relevant in this
appeal before me.

15\. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s appeal is allowed with costs. There will
therefore be judgment for the plaintiff as claimed.
