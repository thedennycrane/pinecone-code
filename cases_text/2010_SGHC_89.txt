2 The prosecution proceeded with the second, third, sixth, seventh, eighth and
ninth charges. AGG pleaded guilty to all the charges and I accepted his plea
of guilt and convicted him on the charges. AGG agreed to the first, fourth and
fifth charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing.

3 The facts leading to the commission of the offences, the arrest and other
relevant information were contained in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which
AGG agreed to. Paragraphs 3 to 30 of that SOF read as follows:

**B. FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

3\. On 30 April 2009, at about 3.50pm, the victim lodged a police report at
the Criminal Investigation Department, in which she stated that between the
year 2000 and mid-2007, she had been molested by her brother on several
occasions. The victim also stated that the accused had begun to rape her, at
their residence, from sometime in either 2005 or 2006.

4 The accused was thereafter arrested on 2 June 2009, at about 4.50pm, at the
Serious Sexual Crimes Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department.

**C. FACTS RELATING TO THE 6 th CHARGE (OUTRAGE OF MODESTY)**

5\. The victim’s immediate family consists of her parents and two older
brothers. The accused is the eldest son of the family.

6\. …

7\. …

8\. …

9\. At [address redacted], the victim’s father occupied the master bedroom,
while the victim’s mother slept on the living room sofa. This was due to the
fact that the victim’s parents were estranged and on poor terms. The accused
and the victim shared the other bedroom in the flat: the accused slept on the
only bed in the room, while the victim slept on a pull-out mattress placed on
the floor adjacent to the accused’s bed.

10\. On a night sometime in the year 2005 or 2006, both the accused and the
victim were in their shared bedroom at [address redacted]. The accused was
lying on his bed and the victim was lying on her mattress. The accused then
came over to where the victim lay on her mattress. Assuming that the victim
was asleep, the accused then inserted his hand into the victim’s panties, and
used his hand to rub on the victim’s vulva and clitoris. The accused admitted
that he felt aroused and excited whilst touching the victim in this manner.

11\. Unbeknownst to the accused, the victim was awake and aware of that the
accused was touching her. However, out of fear and embarrassment, the victim
refrained from stirring, in order not to alert the accused to the fact that
she was awake.

12\. In addition to stroking her vulva with his hand, the accused also began
to touch the victim’s bare breasts by sliding his hands under her top. The
accused also caressed and sucked on the victim’s nipples. The accused then
inserted his finger into the victim’s vagina whilst she lay on her mattress in
their shared bedroom at night.

13\. The above acts were carried out, at night, whilst all of the lights in
the bedroom were switched off. When the accused committed the acts of molest
against the victim, he had assumed that the victim had remained asleep
throughout the entire episode.

14\. …

**D. FACTS RELATING TO THE 2 nd AND 3rd CHARGES (RAPE)**

15\. On a night sometime in the year 2007, the accused and the victim were
again in their shared bedroom at [address redacted]. At around midnight, the
accused went to where the victim lay on her mattress, in the darkness, and
proceeded to remove all of the victim’s clothing. As the victim did not appear
to move, the accused assumed that the victim was asleep. The accused then
turned the victim so that she lay facing up, spread her legs apart, and
kneeled in between her thighs. He then began to rub, grope, lick and suck on
the victim’s breasts and nipples. The accused also inserted a finger into the
victim’s vagina and began to move it in and out of the vagina.

16\. When the victim did not stir, the accused then undressed completely and
guided his erect penis into the victim’s vagina with his right hand. He began
moving his hips and thrusting his penis repeatedly in and out of the victim’s
vagina, supporting his weight by resting his palms at the side of the victim’s
body. The accused did not use a condom or any other contraceptive devices.

17\. …

18\. The accused raped the victim again on a second occasion sometime in the
year 2007. …

19\. Although the victim was awake and aware of what the accused was doing on
the second occasion as well, she once again remained still due to her fear of
the accused, as well as due to the fact that she felt embarrassed by the
sexual abuse perpetrated by the accused on her. The victim did not at any time
consent to having sexual intercourse with the accused.

20\. The accused admitted that he enjoyed having sexual intercourse with the
victim, even though he was aware that she had not consented to the said sexual
intercourse, and that it was wrong for him to have forced himself on her in
such a manner. Prior to each act of sexual abuse committed on the victim, the
accused had viewed pornographic material via the Internet, and felt the urge
to touch a female. He would thereafter ensure (so he thought) that the victim
was asleep, before starting to molest and rape her. The accused therefore
continued to have sexual intercourse with the victim as he could not resist
his sexual urges.

21\. …

**E. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

i. **Confrontation and violence between the accused and the victim**

22\. Sometime in 2007, at [address redacted], the victim confronted the
accused and threatened to tell their parents that he had been having sexual
intercourse with her without her consent. Their parents were not at home at
the time. The accused was shocked that the victim was aware of the sexual
abuse he had committed on her, and surmised that she had not been asleep after
all when he committed the acts of molest and rape on her.

23\. The accused immediately began punching the victim on her face and body
several times, in response to her threat to inform their parents. The victim
quickly ran out of the flat and ran to a neighbouring flat for assistance,
where she called both the police and their parents. When their parents and the
police returned to the flat, the accused admitted that he had assaulted the
victim, but did not mention that he had done so after having been confronted
by the victim. The police subsequently advised the victim’s parents to apply
for a Personal Protection Order (‘PPO’) on behalf of the victim. However, the
victim’s parents eventually decided against applying for the said PPO.

**ii**. **Discovery of the offences**

24\. At the end of 2007, the victim ran away from her home at [address
redacted] as she could not endure the incidents of molest and rape committed
by the accused against her any further. She did not tell her parents that the
accused was raping her as she felt that her parents were unsympathetic to her,
and would either not believe her or not do anything (a feeling partly
engendered by their decision not to apply for a PPO on her behalf against the
accused). The victim therefore went to stay with her then-boyfriend at his
residence.

25\. The victim continued to reside with her then-boyfriend until April 2009,
when she finally informed her secondary school principal about the incidents
of molest and rape committed by the accused on her. The principal and school
counsellor duly informed the police about the matter, after which the victim
formally lodged a police report against the accused on 30 April 2009.

**F. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE VICTIM**

26\. The victim was examined on 5 May 2009 by Dr. [D], an Associate Consultant
at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at [hospital 1]. In a medical
report dated 20 May 2009, Dr. [D] stated that:

a. Clinical examination of the victim’s breast and abdomen were normal;

b. Pelvic examination revealed multiple old hymenal tears;

c. The victim’s urine pregnancy test was negative; and

d. Screening for common STD’s were negative.

**G. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ACCUSED**

27\. The accused was examined on 14 July 2009 by Dr. [E], a Consultant at the
Department of Urology at [hospital 2]. In a medical report dated 14 August
2009, Dr. [E] stated that the accused did not have erectile dysfunction.

**H. FACTS RELATING TO THE TRAFFIC CHARGES (7th – 9th CHARGES)**

28\. The complainant is Senior Staff Sergeant Kheong Yew Ming, attached to the
Tanglin Police Division of the Singapore Police Force.

29\. In the early morning of 30 January 2009, the complainant was performing
road-block duties along Farrer Road. At about 3.33 am, the accused, who was
riding a motorcycle bearing registration number [XXX] along Farrer Road, was
stopped by the complainant at the said road-block. Upon conducting a check,
the complainant discovered that the accused did not possess a valid Class 2B
driving licence in respect of the motorcycle.

30\. Investigations revealed that the said motorcycle bearing registration
number [XXX] was registered to one [C], the accused’s father. On 30 January
2009, the accused had taken the ignition keys of the said motorcycle without
the consent or permission of his father. The accused thereafter took the
motorcycle from their residence [address redacted] and rode the said
motorcycle, until he was stopped by the complainant at the road-block along
Farrer Road.

4 AGG pleaded for a lighter sentence. He said that he was extremely
remorseful. He was a hooligan a few years ago but had changed. He wanted to
finish his national service. He was concerned about his mother and grandmother
who were seriously ill.

5 AGG had previous convictions in 2002 in respect of uncensored or obscene
films, voluntarily causing hurt and theft for which he was asked to reside in
a juvenile home. I did not enhance his sentence because of these prior
offences as they were different in nature from the offences of outrage of
modesty and rape. However, they demonstrated that he had had a brush with the
law before. Instead of changing his ways, he had gravitated to the more
serious offences of outrage of modesty and rape.

6 There is only one other case of rape by a sibling of a young age. This was
_PP v S_ [2003] SGHC 70 (“ _PP v S_ ”) in which I had convicted the accused on
his plea of guilt in respect of rape under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (Cap
224, 1985 Rev Ed). I said at [22]:

I took into account the fact that the accused was in a position of
responsibility and trust vis-à-vis the victims but he was not their parent and
he was of a young age. I also took into account the fact that he had sexually
abused not one but three of his siblings in various ways on various occasions
over a number of years.

7 In that case, I sentenced the accused to ten years’ imprisonment and 12
strokes of the cane for each of the two charges under s 376(2) of the Penal
Code with the sentences for each of these two charges to run consecutively
making a total of 20 years of imprisonment.

8 However, in _PP v S_ , there were three victims and the charge was under the
more serious s 376(2) rather than s 376(1) of the Penal Code.

9 On the other hand, AGG, while professing to be remorseful, had escalated his
sexual offences from outrage of modesty to rape and had assaulted B when she
confronted him instead of feeling shame and remorse.

10 In the circumstances and being mindful of his young age, I sentenced AGG to
12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on each of the charges
under s 376(1) and one year’s imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for
the charge under s 354 of the Penal Code. While the sentence of ten years’
imprisonment on each of the s 376(2) charges in _PP v S_ might appear lower
than that of 12 years’ imprisonment for each of the s 376(1) charges in the
present case before me, it must be remembered that in _PP v S_ , I had ordered
the two stiffest sentences to run consecutively making a total of 20 years
whereas I was not minded to do that for the present case. Accordingly, the
total imprisonment for AGG was in fact 13 years’ imprisonment, _ie_ , the
sentence of one year for the sixth charge (under s 354) was to run
consecutively with the sentence of 12 years for the second charge (under s
376(1)) which was in turn to commence from 4 June 2009, the date of remand. On
the totality principle, I was of the view that the conduct of the accused
person in _PP v S_ was more heinous than that of AGG. This explains why the
total imprisonment for AGG was less than that in _PP v S_.

11 As for each of the seventh to ninth charges, I sentenced AGG to a fine of
$600 and in default, six days’ imprisonment. I added the mandatory
disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road
Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) for 12 months from the date of conviction,
_ie_ , 19 February 2010 for the ninth charge.

12 AGG has filed an appeal against the sentence.
