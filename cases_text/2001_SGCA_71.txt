**Judgment**

**__**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

This was an appeal from the decision of the Judicial Commissioner Woo Bih Li
("the judge"), in which he convicted the appellant of an offence under s
5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). The appellant
was sentenced to death, as required by s 33 and the Second Schedule to the
Act. The appellant appealed against the conviction.

The charge

_

2 The charge read:

> That you, Yap Ah Chuan
>
> on the 19th day of January 2001, at about 1.20 p.m., at Blk 218 Choa Chu
> Kang Ave 3 #03-246, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in
> Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to
> wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, 2 blocks,
> 54 sachets and 1 straw containing a total of more than 15 grams but less
> than 55.38 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the said
> Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an
> offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs
> Act, Chapter 185, and punishable under section 33 of the aforesaid Act.

_

  
The offence

_

3 The substantive offence is found in s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act,
which provides:

> 5\. --(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a
> person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not
> that other person is in Singapore
>
> (a) to traffic in a controlled drug

This substantive offence includes the offence of possession of a controlled
drug for the purpose of trafficking, as provided for in s 5(2):

> (2) For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of
> trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for
> the purpose of trafficking.

4 The elements required for the offence are as follows. The _actus reus_ is
the possession of a threshold amount of a controlled drug. The relevant
provision in this case is s17(c):

> 17\. Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than
>
> (c) 2 grammes of diamorphine

This element must be proved by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.

5 The _mens rea_ is the intention to traffic in that controlled drug. The
presumption in s 17(c) reverses the burden of proof such that, instead of the
prosecution having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the accuseds intention
to traffic, it is the defence which has to show (on a balance of
probabilities) that the accused had no such intention. The relevant part of s
17 provides:

> 17\. Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than
>
> (c) 2 grammes of diamorphine
>
> whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture
> _shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of
> trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for
> that purpose_ (_emphasis added_).

_

  
The background facts

_

6 On 19 January 2001, a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau
("CNB") arrived at Blk 218 Choa Chu Kang Central and discovered the appellant
at the landing between the fourth and fifth storeys. On arrest, the appellant
led the officers to his home and surrendered two packets, 25 sachets and a
straw of heroin. Inspector Gary Chan ("Inspector Chan") (PW13) took a
statement from the appellant ("the first statement"). The officers searched
the apartment and found another 29 sachets of heroin. At this point, Inspector
Chan took another statement from the appellant.

7 The particulars of the items found are as follows. It would be useful at
this point to adopt and adapt a table from the judges grounds of decision. A
final column, labelled "status", has been added.

** Item** | ** Exhibit No** | ** Weight (g)** | ** Diamorphine weight (g)** | ** Found** | ** Status**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 sachet | P78 | 6.26 | 0.27 | Rack in appellants bedroom | Court held it was for appellants own consumption  
2 sachets | P79 | 9.92 | 0.51 | Pouch on rack in appellants bedroom  
1 straw |  P80 |  0.23 |  0.01  
10 sachets | P81 | 73.90 | 4.26 | White envelope on coffee table in appellants bedroom | Appellant admitted it was for trafficking  
5 sachets | P82 | 37.49 | 2.29 | Newspaper on coffee table in appellants bedroom  
5 sachets |  P83 |  37.28 |  2.22  
1 packet |  P84 |  447.20 |  19.14 | White bag in appellants bedroom | Appellant claimed it was for own consumption  
1 packet |  P85 |  446.80 |  17.88  
2 sachets |  P86 |  14.91 |  0.92 | Hazeline Snow box on study table in appellants bedroom | Court held it was for appellants own consumption  
29 sachets |  P87 |  216.40 |  7.88 | Cookie tin on table near kitchen | Appellant claimed it was for own consumption  
  
8 The total weight of the drugs found was 1,290.39 g, and the total
diamorphine weight was 55.38 g. The appellant admitted to possessing 8.77 g of
the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. Hence the issue was whether
the appellant possessed the remaining 46.71 g of diamorphine for trafficking.

9 The officers also found various paraphernalia used for drug consumption, two
mobile phones and two pagers.

10 As mentioned above, the appellant made two statements which were recorded
by Inspector Chan. He also made a long statement, recorded in four tranches,
which was recorded by the Investigating Officer, Inspector Muruganandam (PW
21). The defence did not challenge the voluntariness of any statement.

_

  
The evidence of the prosecution

_

11 The prosecution called a total of 22 witnesses. The majority of them were
Central Narcotics Bureau officers, who gave evidence as to the appellants
arrest and the location of the drugs. Others were staff of the Centre for
Forensic Science, Health Sciences Authority, who had analysed the appellants
urine sample and the drugs. The combined effect of their evidence proved
beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant was in possession of 55.38 g of
diamorphine. At this point, the s 17 presumption operated to place on the
appellant the burden of proving that he did not intend to traffic in the
drugs.

_

  
The evidence of the defence

_

12 The first point which the defence tried to establish was that the appellant
was heavily addicted to heroin. The appellant had been detained in drug
rehabilitation centres ("DRC") seven times between 1983 and 1998. He was
imprisoned for two years from 1998. During this period, he spent more time
incarcerated than free. However, he reverted to his drug habit each time he
was released. The table below shows his level of consumption over this period,
according to the appellant. It should be noted that the appellants evidence as
to the period of detention is not on fours with the records, and in any case,
some of the time periods do not make sense. However, these inconsistencies are
not material.

** Approximate time** | ** Sachets consumed** | ** Grade of heroin**  
---|---|---  
Before 1st detention (1983) |  2 / week |  3  
After 1st detention |  2 / week |  3  
Before 2nd detention (1984) |  5-6 / week |  3  
After 3rd detention (1986) |  8 / week |  3  
Before 4th detention (1988) |  4 / week |  4 (superior grade)  
After 4th detention |  8 / week |  4  
Before 5th detention (1991) |  11 / week |  3  
After 5th detention |  15 / week |  3  
After 6th detention |  20-21 / week |  3  
After 7th detention |  20 / week |  3  
After imprisonment |  2.5-3 / day |  3  
  
To support this, the appellants sister, Yap Bee Hoon ("Ms Yap")(DW2) also
testified regarding the withdrawal symptoms which she had witnessed in the
appellant, and her failed attempts to rid him of the addiction.

13 The appellant claimed that most of the drugs were for his own consumption.
Hence the second point which the defence attempted to address was, why the
appellant had purchased such a large quantity of drugs from one Ah Boy for his
own consumption. The reasons given were:

> a As Ah Boy would not supply drugs for three weeks over the Chinese New Year
> period, the appellant bought a larger amount to tide himself over during
> that period.
>
> b The appellant wanted to show Ah Boy that he could pay for a large quantity
> of drugs, so that he could win Ah Boys trust.

14 The third point which the defence tried to establish was that the
appellant, though an odd-job painter with a drug habit, could pay $12,000 for
the heroin. It was also alleged that Ah Boy allowed the appellant to have the
drugs on credit. The appellant planned to pay by either of the following ways.
The first option was:

> a He would borrow $10,000 from his brother-in-law, Goh Hak Hua ("Mr Goh")
> (DW3).
>
> b He would make a profit of $1,000 from selling certain exhibits P81, P82
> and P83; and
>
> c He would return to work and earn the balance of $1,000.

If Mr Goh could not or would not lend him the money, the appellant claimed
that he could return to work and save about $10,000 in seven months. He would
also sell exhibits P81, P82 and P83. This was his second option.

15 The appellant claimed that the drugs could not have been meant for sale
because:

> a There was no weighing machine in the appellants bedroom with which the
> packets could be accurately weighed.
>
> b The packets had not been machine-sealed.

16 The appellant added that one of the mobile phones had been given to him by
one Ah Heng, so that he could contact the appellant when he wanted to consume
drugs with the appellant. The appellant also said that both pagers belonged to
him, but only one was still in use.

_

  
The Judicial Commissioners decision

_

17 The judge handed down his grounds of decision on 7 August 2001. He first
set out the background facts relating to the appellants arrest and the
recovery of the drugs. He then set out the gist of the appellants statements
to the police. He then documented the proceedings before him.

18 The judge found that the charge against the appellant was proved beyond
reasonable doubt for the following reasons:

> a He did not believe that the appellant had bought such a large quantity of
> drugs merely because Ah Boy would not supply him with drugs for three weeks
> over the Chinese New Year period.
>
> b He did not believe that the appellant had tried to borrow $10,000 from Mr
> Goh.
>
> c He did not believe that Ah Boy would not chase the appellant for payment.
>
> d He did not believe that the sachets could not be for sale because they had
> not been sealed by machine, as the sachets which the appellant had admitted
> were for sale had also not been sealed by machine.
>
> e The fact that there was no weighing scale in the appellants bedroom was
> irrelevant, as there was no evidence that buyers would not buy drugs unless
> they had been accurately weighed.
>
> f He accepted the evidence of the prosecutions expert, Dr Choos opinion that
> the appellant was only mildly addicted to heroin.
>
> g He did not believe that Ah Heng gave the appellant a mobile phone merely
> for the purpose of contacting him so they could consume drugs together. He
> also did not believe that the appellant had terminated the line of his
> second pager.
>
> h He was not satisfied with the appellants attempt to explain away the
> inconsistencies between his statements and his evidence, by saying that he
> had been confused and tired when he gave his statements.

19 We do not discuss points (d), (e) and (g) above as they are minor and we
see no reason to overturn the judges findings thereon.

20 The judge also held that 1.81 g of the diamorphine was probably for the
appellants own consumption, as these items were not found with the other drugs
and were neither in an envelope nor covered with newspaper. The respondent
submitted before us that the judge should not have conducted the apportionment
exercise, but the status of the 1.81 g of heroin would not have affected the
outcome of our decision.

The issues

_

21 The issues in this appeal were:

> a Whether the appellant was severely addicted to, and consumed large amounts
> of, heroin.
>
> b Whether it was believable that the appellant had bought an unusually large
> amount of drugs on credit, for his own consumption.
>
> c Whether it was believable that the appellant would be able to pay for the
> drugs.

22 In dealing with these issues, the following passage from _Public Prosecutor
v Lim Ah Poh and another_[1992] 1 SLR 87 was borne in mind:

> An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly
> reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an
> appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor
> heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges findings
> and their reasons therefor.

_

  
The first issue

_

23 The first question was whether the appellant was severely addicted to
heroin. The prosecutions final witness was Dr Choo. Dr Choo had, in a little
less than a year, attended to about 1,000 drug addicts at DRCs. He was called
to rebut the defences case that the appellant was heavily addicted to heroin,
and hence that it was very likely that exhibits P84, P85 and P87 were also
meant for the appellants own consumption.

24 Dr Choo first described the withdrawal symptoms associated with mild,
moderate and severe cases of drug addiction respectively. He then spoke about
the treatment which had to be administered in each case. He also offered an
opinion on the average amount of heroin which a mildly-, moderately- and
severely-addicted person would consume per day.

25 Dr Choo felt that the following factors pointed to the conclusion that the
appellant was only mildly addicted to heroin:

> a Several reports by different doctors at the DRCs stated that the appellant
> was mildly addicted to heroin.
>
> b Each time the appellant was in DRC or in prison, he did not have access to
> drugs. This would mean that, each time he reverted to his drug habit, he
> would start by consuming small amounts as his tolerance to drugs had not
> built up. It was hence unlikely that the appellants consumption rate was as
> high as he claimed it was.
>
> c Dr Choo and his staff nurse examined the appellant on the day of his
> arrest and found that his symptoms were consistent with that of mild
> addiction. He was well enough to be discharged the next day.
>
> d As Ms Yap testified, the appellant recovered from his withdrawal symptoms
> after "cold turkey" treatment. If he had been severely addicted, he would
> have died as a result of such treatment.

26 The defence did not challenge Dr Choos status as an expert and failed to
produce any relevant evidence which rebutted Dr Choos opinion.

27 The second question was whether it was likely that the appellant was
consuming 2.5 to 3 sachets of grade 3 heroin a day prior to his arrest for the
present charge. This was the evidence given by the appellant at trial.
However, in the third tranche of his long statement (recorded on 29 January
2001), the appellant had stated that he smoked a sachet of heroin a day and
hence his average monthly consumption was 30 sachets. When cross-examined on
this inconsistency, the appellant claimed that he may have been confused as to
the quality of the heroin, because if it was of a better grade, he would
require fewer sachets. However, as pointed out by the prosecution, the only
time during which he consumed grade 4 heroin was 1986 to 1987. There should be
no reason for such confusion in 2000.

28 Dr Choo also opined that it was unlikely that the appellant consumed 2.5 to
3 sachets of heroin a day. His rate of consumption was more likely to be 0.5
sachet per day.

_

  
The second issue

_

29 The first question was whether the drugs were for the appellants own
consumption or for trafficking. Several parts of the appellants statements
suggested that the appellant was trafficking in drugs:

> a From the first statement:

> > Q: Whom does this drug belong to?
>

>> A: I safe keep for my friend.

>>

>> .

>>

>> Q: What are all these substances for?

>>

>> A: He call me to pass to people when he contact me. I do not know who will
take from me as I will be instructed by Ah Boy.

>>

>> Q: How much will you earn from all these?

>>

>> A: About one thousand dollars.

>
> b From para 15 of the second tranche of the long statement (recorded on 26
> January 2001):
>
> I have not paid the money to him, as I will have to sell the heroin and pay
> it to him later. I normally would sell the heroin and pay Ah Boy later. Ah
> Boy would call me regularly to check if I could pay him his money.
>
> c From para 21 of the third tranche of the long statement (recorded on 29
> January 2001):
>
> The profits, which I had obtained from the heroin trafficking, had been
> loaned out to my friends. For each ball of heroin that I purchase from Ah
> Boy, I would make about $3,000 profit.
>
> d From para 27 of the fourth tranche of the long statement (recorded on 30
> January 2001:
>
> The other reason why I do not have many customers is because I had just
> started selling drugs about three weeks before my arrest I have five friends
> who are living in Teck Whye to whom I sell heroin.

30 The appellant only mentioned the notion of personal consumption in the
third tranche of the long statement (para 24):

> I would like to say that on the day of my arrest there were two balls of
> heroin and another 30 over sachets of heroin seized in my flat. All these
> drug (_sic_) were actually meant for my own consumption.

However, during the trial, the appellant admitted that exhibits P81, P82 and
P83 were meant for trafficking. The appellant seemed to have changed his story
more than once: he first spoke of his trafficking in general terms, then
claimed that all the drugs seized were for his personal consumption, then
circumscribed his admissions as to trafficking to exhibits P81, P82 and P83.
We found this account unbelievable.

31 The second question was why the appellant bought such a large quantity of
drugs if they were merely for his own consumption. Neither reason given by the
appellant at trial had been mentioned in his statements. Under s 123(1) of the
Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), the court could draw any relevant inferences
from this failure. The appellants first reason was that Ah Boy would not
supply him with heroin for three weeks over the Chinese New Year period. At
the trial below, defence counsel submitted that the appellant would take
between 60 and 72 days to consume three packets of heroin, and this made the
appellants case credible. The prosecutions calculations, based on two packets,
54 sachets and a straw of heroin, concluded that the appellant would have
enough to last him more than 51 days. A period of 51 to 72 days can by no
means be mistaken for three weeks, and with respect this aspect of the
appellants case was not credible.

32 The appellants second reason was that he had ordered a large quantity of
heroin from Ah Boy so that, on his making full payment, Ah Boy would think him
a reliable customer and trust him. There were many holes in this line of
reasoning. The largest one was the premise that the appellant could make
payment at all (see the third issue below). It also went against common sense
to go to so much trouble to gain Ah Boys trust. Surely the relationship
between drug supplier and drug user is of a commercial nature rather than one
built on trust. For this reason, the appellants evidence that Ah Boy supplied
the heroin to him on credit and did not chase him for payment was also
difficult to believe.

_

  
The third issue

_

33 A key element in the appellants first payment option was a loan of $10,000
from Mr Goh. It should be noted that the appellant did not mention in any of
his statements that he had asked Mr Goh for a loan. Once again, the court
could draw adverse inferences under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

34 Mr Gohs testimony also cast some doubt on the truth of this claim. The
first issue was Mr Gohs ability to make the loan. In response to a question by
the judge, Mr Goh revealed that his personal savings amounted to more than
$10,000 but less than $15,000. While he may have been able to lend the
appellant $10,000, that would have meant parting with a large part of his
savings. Given that the appellant still had not repaid a loan which he had
previously taken from Mr Goh, and that the appellant did not hold a regular
job, it was unlikely that Mr Goh would see his money again.

35 Secondly, Mr Goh was not sure of, and did not care for, the reason behind
the appellants request for a loan. This seemed strange, given the reason
above. Under cross-examination, he admitted that he knew of the appellants
drug habit, but claimed that it did not occur to him that the appellant might
use the money to buy drugs. It also did not strike him that this might
undermine the efforts of the appellants family to rid the appellant of his
addiction.

36 Thirdly, Mr Goh had not even agreed to the appellants request. He was
unable to communicate his decision to the appellant because the latter had
been arrested. He was evasive as to his level of willingness to make the loan,
and maintained that he would "consider" the appellants present and future
requests.

37 As for the appellants second payment option, it was unlikely, given his
monthly salary of about $2,000 and his expensive drug habit, that he could
save $10,000 in seven months.

_

  
Conclusion

_

38 For the reasons above, we dismissed the appeal.
