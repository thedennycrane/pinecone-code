31 July 2019 Judgment reserved.

Tan Puay Boon JC:

Introduction

1 The Plaintiff (“Husband”) and the Defendant (“Wife”) (collectively
“Parties”), who are Singaporeans, were married in the United Kingdom in 1986.
They have three children (“Children”), born in 1991, 1992 and 1996, who are
now all of age and in their twenties. The Parties both turn 57 this year. The
Husband holds a senior position in an international financial institution and
the Wife is the process advisor in a petrol chemical company.

2 The Parties own a condominium unit in the Newton area ("Newton Property")
that was bought in 2011, where the Wife resides with the youngest child, as
the two older children have married and moved out. 1

Plaintiff’s Reply Affidavit dated 29 March 2018 (“P2”) at para 23.

They also own a condominium unit in Havelock Road (“Havelock Road Property”)
that was bought for investment purposes in 1998. The Husband moved out of the
Parties’ earlier matrimonial home, a property in the Novena area (“Novena
Property”) in 2003. 2

3 On 30 October 2015, the Husband filed for divorce on the ground of four
years’ separation. This was contested by the Wife, and interim judgment was
eventually granted on an uncontested basis on 11 January 2017 on the Wife’s
amended counterclaim. This was based on the ground of unreasonable behaviour
of the Husband, which included his affair with the Defendant in the
counterclaim (“Third Party”), 3

bringing an end to a 31-year marriage.

Matters in dispute

4 The ancillary matters that were adjourned to be decided were the division of
the matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial flat, the Newton Property),
the maintenance for the Wife and the costs for the divorce and ancillary
matters.

Division of matrimonial assets

The legal principles

5 Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) sets out
the powers of the court to divide matrimonial assets, and the matters that it
has to have regard to. The considerations that are to be taken into account
when making the division include the matters that are relevant for the
assessment of maintenance for the Wife that are set out in s 114 of the WC.

6 Two distinct methodologies have been applied in the division of matrimonial
assets – the global assessment methodology and the classification methodology:
NK v NL [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [30]–[32]. The global assessment methodology
“consists of four distinct phases: viz, identification, assessment, division
and apportionment”. The classification methodology involves “an assimilation
of all four of the above steps into a broad judicial discretion which, in the
first instance, separately considers and divides classes of matrimonial
assets”. At the hearing on 27 August 2018, the Parties were in agreement that
the global assessment method should be used. 4

##### Foot Note 4

×

Plaintiff’s Skeletal Arguments (“PSA”) at paras 20–21; Notes of Evidence
(“NE”) 27 August 2018 at p 7.

Also, since this is not a case where there are multiple classes of assets to
which the Parties had made different contributions to for the classification
methodology to apply, the global assessment methodology is the appropriate
methodology to use (see TNC v TND [2016] 3 SLR 1172 at [35]). I will therefore
apply the global assessment methodology in the division of the matrimonial
assets.

Identification and Assessment of the matrimonial assets

7 I now deal with the identification of the matrimonial assets and the
assessment of their net values. I will first deal with the agreed assets and
liabilities, followed by the assets with disputed values and, finally, the
assets which are disputed to be part of the matrimonial pool.

8 By default, the date for the identification of matrimonial assets is at the
date of the interim judgment: ARY v ARX and another appeal [2016] 2 SLR 686 at
[31]. The Parties have not contended otherwise, and I also see no reason to
depart from the default position. I therefore adopt this date.

9 The general rule is that the assessment of the value of the matrimonial
assets is at the date of the ancillary matters hearing: TND v TNC and another
appeal [2017] SGCA 34 at [19]–[20]. However, the Husband submitted that the
operative cut-off date ought to be on or around the date on which interim
judgment was granted, ie, 11 January 2017, as the Parties arrived at an agreed
valuation for various joint matrimonial assets based on the valuations as at
2017. 5

##### Foot Note 5

×

PSA at para 16.

He also cited a passage from UBD v UBE [2017] SGHCF 14 at [12], where the High
Court decided to depart from the default position, and delineated and valued
the disputed bank accounts as at the interim judgment date, stating:

… This was because the parties had lived separate and independent lives for
more than 6 years since January 2011 when the Husband moved out of the
matrimonial home. It was thus a reasonable expectation on their part that they
would be free to spend from their bank accounts as they saw necessary from the
date at which their separation formalised (ie, the IJ Date), without having to
account ex post for or rebut contentions of wrongful dissipation.

[emphasis in original]

10 On the other hand, the Wife submitted that the latest valuation ought to be
adopted. 6

##### Foot Note 6

×

Defendant’s Skeletal Arguments (“DSA”) at paras 75-76.

I find that the facts of the present case do not warrant a departure from that
position. Therefore, where there is any dispute on valuation of assets and
liabilities that is due to the difference in dates of valuation by the
Parties, I will accept the valuation closest to the date of the ancillary
matters hearing, which was in August 2018.

11 The Parties have signed a joint summary of relevant information (“JSRI”),
updated on 25 July 2018, that sets out all their assets and liabilities which
are jointly or individually owned. I will make reference to it where required.

Assets that are agreed

12 The agreed matrimonial assets with agreed values are set out in the table
below:

S/No| Description| Value ($)  
---|---|---  
Joint Assets  
1\. | Standard Chartered Joint Bank Account number ending with 1075| 1,793.31  
2\. | DBS Joint Current Account number ending with 3198| 2,121.76

three AXA policies and three of the Wife’s Prudential policies listed in the
JSRI were to be excluded from the dispute. 7

##### Foot Note 7

NE 27 August 2018 at p 1.

I will therefore not deal with them in this judgment.

Agreed liabilities with agreed values

14 The agreed matrimonial liabilities with agreed values are set out in the
table below:

S/No| Description| Value ($)  
---|---|---  
Joint Liabilities  
1\. | UOB Mortgage for Newton Property| 558,882.02  
2\. | UOB Renovation Loan for Newton Property| 54,333.13  
3\. | DBS Mortgage for Havelock Road Property| 276,936.94  
| Total| 890,152.09  
  
15 Except for the mortgage for the Havelock Road Property which is explained
at [20] below, I will take these liabilities into consideration when
determining the net values of the matrimonial assets.

Agreed assets with disputed values

16 Set out in the table below are the agreed matrimonial assets where the
values are disputed by the Parties:

S/No| Description  
---|---  
Joint Assets  
1\. | Newton Property  
2\. | Havelock Road Property  
Wife’s Assets  
3\. | Central Depository Account (“CDP”) Account Shares  
4\. | UOB Bank Account number ending with 5510  
5\. | UOB Bank Account number ending with 2939  
6\. | UOB Bank Account number ending with 2015  
7\. | UOB Bank Account number ending with 7158  
8\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 3298  
9\. | POSB Bank Account number ending with 2658  
  
17 I will deal with these in turn.

(1) Newton Property

18 The Husband submitted the net value of the Newton Property to be
$3,475,651.09 (as at 31 January 2017) while the Wife submitted the net value
to be $3,486,784.85 (as at 17 February 2017). 8

##### Foot Note 8

×

JSRI at p 8.

As explained in [10] above, I accept the Wife’s valuation of $3,486,784.85 as
it is closest to the date of the ancillary matters hearing.

(2) Havelock Road Property

19 The Husband’s gross valuation of the Havelock Road Property was
$1,070,058.00 (for which he has not provided any supporting documents) while
the Wife’s gross valuation was $1,250,000.00 (based on the Urban Redevelopment
Authority’s recent caveats records for properties similar to the Havelock Road
Property). 9

##### Foot Note 9

×

Defendant’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“DAM1”) at pp 300–301;
Plaintiff’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“PAM1”) at p 11.

In the absence of any supporting documents for the Husband’s valuation, I
accept the Wife’s valuation of $1,250,000.00, given that it is the most
reliable valuation provided by the Parties. Moreover, in the JSRI, the Husband
agrees to accept the Wife’s higher valuation of the asset if she is able to
obtain it.

20 On the other hand, I accept the Husband’s valuation of the outstanding
mortgage of $274,827.77 (as at 1 February 2017) in preference to the Wife’s
valuation of $276,936.94 (as at 31 January 2017), as it is the latest
valuation closest in time to the date of the ancillary matters hearing. 10

##### Foot Note 10

×

PAM1 at pp 137–141.

21 Hence, I find that the net valuation of the Havelock Road Property is
$975,172.23, being $1,250,000.00 - $274,827.77.

(3) CDP Account Shares

22 The Parties disagreed on the valuation of the CDP Account Shares, with the
Husband valuing it at $60,839.00 and the Wife valuing it at $54,719.00. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

JSRI at p 10.

The difference is on whether the CapMallAB220112 shares in the CDP Account,
valued at $6,120.00, should be included as a matrimonial asset. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

DAM1 at p 17.

Based on the evidence provided by the Wife, the CapMallAB220112 shares had
belonged to her father and should not be included. The shares were sold on 12
January 2017 and this is corroborated by a deposit into a joint bank account
of the Wife and her father on 12 January 2017. On or about 16 June 2017, the
Wife’s father passed away. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

Defendant’s Reply Affidavit dated 2 April 2018 (“D3”) at p 19.

On a balance of probabilities, I accept the Wife’s evidence that the shares
belonged to her father. I therefore adopt the Wife’s valuation of $54,719.00.

(4) UOB Bank Account number ending with 5510

23 The Husband valued the balance of this bank account at $28,056.57 (as at 31
December 2017) while the Wife valued it at $15,371.11 (as at 29 March 2018).
14

##### Foot Note 14

×

JSRI at p 11.

As explained in [10] above, I accept the Wife’s valuation as it is closest to
the date of the ancillary matters hearing.

(5) UOB Bank Account number ending with 2939

24 The Husband valued the balance of this bank account at $1,468.13 (as at 31
January 2017) while the Wife valued it at $643.00 (as at 28 February 2018). 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

JSRI at p 11.

As explained in [10] above, I accept the Wife’s valuation as it is closest to
the date of the ancillary matters hearing.

(6) UOB Bank Account number ending with 2015

25 The Husband valued the balance of this bank account at $38,109.40 (as at 31
January 2017) while the Wife valued it at $69,070.94 (as at 28 February 2018).
16

##### Foot Note 16

JSRI at p 11.

As explained in [10] above, I accept the Wife’s valuation as it is closest to
the date of the ancillary matters hearing.

(7) UOB Bank Account number ending with 7158

26 The Husband valued the balance of this bank account at $6,047.18 (as at 31
January 2017) while the Wife valued it at $1,049.88 (as at 1 April 2018). 17

As explained in [10] above, I accept the Wife’s valuation as it is closest to

27 The Husband valued the balance of this bank account at $100,560.47 (as at
31 January 2017) while the Wife valued it at $97,230.47 (as at 1 April 2018).
18

January 2017) while the Wife valued it at $11,226.99 (as at 1 April 2018). 19

As explained in [10] above, I accept the Wife’s valuation as it is closest to
the date of the ancillary matters hearing.

Summary of agreed assets with disputed values

29 In summary, for the assets with disputed values, I set out in the table
below the values which the Parties submitted, and the values which I have
found:

Asset| Wife’s Value($)| Husband’s Value($)|  Court’s Value($)  
---|---|---|---  
Joint Assets  
Newton Property| 3,486,784.85| 3,475,651.09| 3,486,784.85  
Havelock Road Property| 795,230.23| 973,063.06| 975,172.23  
Sub-total (A)| 4,461,957.08

Total [(A) +(B)]| 4,711,268.47  
  
Assets disputed to be matrimonial assets

30 Set out in the table below are assets which the Parties disagree on whether
they should be classified as matrimonial assets:

S/No| Description  
---|---  
| Wife’s Assets  
1\. | Wife’s Employee Pension Plan  
2\. | UOB Bank Account number ending with 2803  
3\. | UOB Bank Account number ending with 9622  
4\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 91569  
5\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 19936  
6\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 96498  
7\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 04113  
8\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 60102  
9\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 60101  
10\. | Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 50101  
| Husband’s Assets  
1\. | Gilstead Road Property (see [37] below)  
2\. | Gifts to Third Party  
3\. | Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited Insurance policy  
4\. | Undisclosed AXA Insurance policy  
5\. | Undisclosed Insurance Corporation of Singapore (“ICS”)/Aviva Insurance policy  
6\. | Undisclosed Prudential Assurance Insurance policy  
7\. | Unaccounted Stock Options  
  
(1) Wife’s Employee Pension Plan

31 The Husband alleged, based on his belief but without supporting evidence,
that the Wife has an Employee Pension Plan that should be included in the pool
of matrimonial assets. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

P2 at para 28; PSA at para 61.

In the JSRI, the Husband had required the Wife to provide documentation from
her employer on whether she has a pension plan. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

JSRI at p 16.

However, he did not make any request for discovery or interrogatories to
support the allegation until the date of the ancillary matters hearing. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

NE 27 August 2018 at p 3.

The Husband also accepted that he has the burden of proof on the existence of
this asset. Since the Wife denied having such a pension plan with her
employer, 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

D3 at para 122.

and as the Husband has not discharged his burden of proof, the existence of
the pension plan is not proved and I will not include the alleged Employee
Pension Plan in the pool of matrimonial assets.

(2) UOB Bank Account number ending with 2803

32 The Husband submitted that the $1,746.31 in this account (as at 31 January
2017) should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

DAM1 at p 522; PSA at para 62; Plaintiff’s Core Bundle of Documents (“PCB”) at
p 62.

However, this account was closed on 10 February 2017 and the moneys were
transferred to the UOB One Account number ending with 2015 for higher interest
returns. Since the balance in the latter account has already been included in
the pool of matrimonial assets (see [24] above), to include it again would be
double counting the same asset. I therefore exclude it from the pool of
matrimonial assets.

(3) Joint Bank Accounts of the Wife and her mother

33 The following five bank accounts are joint bank accounts of the Wife and
her mother, and they will be dealt with collectively:

(a) UOB Bank Account number ending with 9622;

(b) Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 91569;

(c) Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 19936;

(d) Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 96498; and

(e) Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 04113.

34 The Wife submitted that the moneys in these joint bank accounts belonged
wholly to her mother and not her. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

DSA at p 14.

This was corroborated by evidence from her mother that the Wife helped to
manage the funds of her parents. The Wife’s father, who passed away in June
2017 (at [22] above), was in his nineties and her mother was in her eighties.
The Wife invested the moneys of her parents on their behalf whenever there
were favourable rates. 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

Affidavit of Wife’s mother dated 19 January 2018 at pp 4–6.

The Husband alleged that as a blood relation, the Wife’s mother’s affidavit
was “biased and tendentious” and that the moneys in these bank accounts should
not be excluded from the pool. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

PSA at para 67.

He did not, however, provide further proof of such allegations. In the absence
of evidence to contradict the position of the Wife and her mother, I find on a
balance of probabilities that the moneys in the bank accounts do indeed belong
to her mother. After the Wife’s father passed away, the Wife bore and
continues to bear the sole responsibility of looking after her mother.
Although the Wife has a brother, he is permanently based in the United States
of America, and also does not contribute to the daily living expenses of their
mother. She lives with the Wife, and is reliant on her. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

DAM1 at para 54.

I therefore exclude the moneys in these bank accounts from the pool of
matrimonial assets.

(4) Closed bank accounts of the Wife

35 I now deal with the three bank accounts of the Wife which were closed on 20
September 2017, namely:

(a) Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 60102;

(b) Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 60101; and

(c) Standard Chartered Bank Account number ending with 50101.

36 A letter from Standard Chartered Bank dated 15 December 2017 confirmed that
the above bank accounts were closed on 20 September 2017 and had zero
balances. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

Defendant’s Voluntary Affidavit dated 15 December 2017 at p 25.

Moreover, the bank accounts with numbers ending with 60101 and 50101 had no
activity since 2006 or 2007, and the bank account with the number ending with
60102 had no transactions at all. I therefore reject the Husband’s submission
that the Wife did not disclose these bank accounts, and find that these
accounts should not be included in the pool.

(5) Gilstead Road Property

37 The Wife initially submitted that a property at Gilstead Road owned by the
Third Party (“Gilstead Road Property”) should be included as a matrimonial
asset. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

JSRI at p 22.

However, she later confirmed that she was not seeking an interest in the
Gilstead Road Property but was asking the court to draw an adverse inference
against the Husband for failing to provide full and frank disclosure for his
contributions in relation to the Gilstead Road Property. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

DSA at para 53; NE 8 August 2018 at p 1.

38 The Husband maintained that he did not own the Gilstead Road Property,
which was held in the sole name of the Third Party, and put the Wife to proof
of his ownership. The Wife asserted that the Husband had bought the property
in the Third Party’s name, and provided the following evidence, which I will
now examine in turn.

39 First, the Parties’ second child deposed in an affidavit that the Husband
admitted to her that he “had a property in [the Third Party’s] name” which the
second child understood to mean that he had paid for the property but it was
bought in the Third Party’s name. 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

Second child’s affidavit dated 2 April 2018 (“CDC-1”) at para 19.

However, the Husband denied this. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

CDC-1 at p 5; D3 at paras 107–108.

40 Secondly, the Husband made a payment of $100,000.00 to the Third Party on 5
June 2000, and did not provide any explanation for what the money was utilised
for. 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

DAM1 at p 696.

41 Thirdly, on 19 April 2013, the Husband made payment of a sum of $1,317.48
for the MCST fees of the Gilstead Road Property. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

DAM1 at p 695.

42 Finally, the Wife asserted that the purchase price of the property was
$1,428,000.00 when it was transferred to the Third Party in 19 June 2010. 36

##### Foot Note 36

×

DAM1 at pp 698–704.

She said that the Third Party, who was 36 years old in 2010, would not have
had sufficient income to purchase the property given the role she had held in
another international financial institution at the time. 37

##### Foot Note 37

×

D3 at paras 102–106.

The Husband disagreed, and asserted that the Third Party held a “senior
position in the financial industry”. 38

NE 27 August 2018 at p 3.

43 Without further documentary proof of the Third Party’s occupation, income
and the financial ability of the Third Party to pay for the property, I accord
limited weight to the Wife’s submission. There is also insufficient evidence
to show that the Husband has a beneficial interest in the Gilstead Road
Property, as his payments of $100,000.00 to the Third Party and $1,317.48 for
MCST fees, on their own, do not establish this.

44 That said, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Husband did make
various payments for the Gilstead Road Property, though the Wife has not
proven the exact extent of these contributions save for the MCST fees.

45 Therefore, while I will not include the Gilstead Road Property in the pool
of matrimonial assets, I will include into the pool the known amounts that the
Husband has paid that are in connection with the property. I will deal with
the $100,000.00 when considering the gifts to the Third Party, as there is no
direct evidence connecting it with the Gilstead Road Property. I will deal
with my finding that the Husband had paid other amounts for the Gilstead
Property when considering whether any adverse inference should be drawn
against the Husband.

(6) Gifts to Third Party

46 In TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“TNL v
TNK”), the Court of Appeal set out the following guidelines on dealing with
dissipated assets at [24]:

[T]he issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one
spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or
(b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are of
the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or
otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to
the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative
interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the
expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time.
Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure
was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the
expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse
who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full.
In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share
in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact
and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except
to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill
expenses.

47 The Husband made the following payments to the Third Party, evidenced by
what the Wife called “suspicious transactions”, that amounted to a total of
$35,900.00: 39

##### Foot Note 39

D3 at para 86 and pp 253–277; DSA at para 166.

(a) $2,000.00 on 18 February 2015, which the Husband claimed were for moneys
owed to Third Party for personal expenses;

(b) $27,400.00 on 23 February 2015, which the Husband claimed were for moneys
owed to Third Party for Chinese New Year new currency notes;

(c) $3,000.00 on 27 February 2015, which the Husband claimed were for moneys
owed to the Third Party for his personal expenses;

(d) $2,000.00 on 11 August 2015, which the Husband claimed were for moneys
owed to the Third Party for his personal expenses; and

(e) $1,500.00 on 7 November 2016, which the Husband claimed were for moneys
owed to the Third Party for his personal expenses.

48 These were in addition to the $100,000.00 paid to the Third Party on 5 June
2000.

49 I am of the view that that all the payments from the Husband to the Third
Party in 2015 were made sufficiently close in time to the date of the filing
of the Husband’s divorce writ on 27 October 2015, which was based on four
years’ separation. As for the 2016 payment, it was made before the ancillaries
were concluded. I find that they satisfy the TNL v TNK test, and therefore
return these amounts to the pool of matrimonial assets for division.

50 With regard to the Husband’s cheque payment of $100,000.00 to the Third
Party on 5 June 2000, 40

##### Foot Note 40

the Husband did not provide an explanation for this payment. 41

##### Foot Note 41

DAM1 at para 147.

If there are any matrimonial assets (including cash) that are proved to have
been unfairly or unjustly dissipated by either party during the course of the
marriage until the date of interim judgment which the court finds unacceptable
and must be accounted for as part of the matrimonial assets as if they had
never been dissipated, then the amount that the court deems to have been
unfairly or unjustly dissipated would be notionally added to the total net
value of the matrimonial assets available for distribution: see AJR v AJS
[2010] 4 SLR 617 ("AJR v AJS”) at [6]. Given that this money was inexplicably
given to the Third Party during the course of the Parties’ marriage, I am of
the view that the $100,000.00 should be returned to the total pool of
matrimonial assets for division.

51 The Husband also received $40,000.00 from the Third Party on 27 May 2016
and $20,000.00 on 11 July 2016. 42

##### Foot Note 42

D3 at paras 86(g) and (h).

He could not remember what the first sum was for, and said that the second
amount was to help pay for the mortgage and other expenses. The Wife disputed
the explanation, and pointed out that he had sufficient money in his UOB
account and was not in financial need. The Husband also did not show evidence
of his repayment of the latter sum to the Third Party. In the circumstances, I
disregard these payments, and will not deduct them from the amounts which the
Husband gave to the Third Party when considering the amount to be returned to
the pool of matrimonial assets.

(7) Undisclosed Insurance Policies

52 The Wife submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against the
Husband for failing to fully disclose four insurance policies. 43

##### Foot Note 43

×

DSA at para 54.

I will deal with them below.

Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited Insurance Policy

53 While the Husband asserted that this policy has no surrender or cash value,
he only disclosed the payments he made but did not provide any further
documentary evidence to support this assertion earlier. 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

PSA at para 92.

While he later applied to admit the policy documents at the hearing on 27
August 2018, this was opposed by the Wife on the ground that he did not admit
them during discovery and had also confirmed at the previous hearing on 8
August 2018 that he had no other documents to disclose. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

NE 8 August 2018 at p 5 and 27 August 2018 at p 3.

I agreed with the Wife and disallowed the application. In the result, I find
on a balance of probabilities that this insurance policy does have a surrender
value which the Husband has failed to disclose. In the absence of evidence on
a particular sum which I can add to the pool of matrimonial assets, I will
deal with this when considering whether an adverse inference should be drawn
against the Husband below.

AXA Insurance Policy

54 The Husband only disclosed the three AXA insurance policies which have
annual premiums totalling $2,400.00, but did not disclose that he has a fourth
AXA insurance policy. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

PSA at para 93.

There was evidence of payment of $3,274.00 for the fourth AXA insurance policy
according to his bank statement, 47

##### Foot Note 47

×

Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 24 August 2017 (“PA2”) at p 284; PCB at pp
286–287.

and this was corroborated by the Wife’s evidence that he received four letters
from AXA monthly. 48

##### Foot Note 48

×

D3 at para 94.

I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that the Husband does have this
insurance policy and that it has a surrender value. Since I am unable to
include any particular sum to the pool of matrimonial assets, I will deal with
it when considering whether an adverse inference should be drawn against the
Husband below.

ICS/Aviva Insurance Policy

55 The Wife recalled that the Husband had an insurance policy from ICS, which
was later bought over by Aviva, but the Husband did not disclose this. 49

##### Foot Note 49

×

D3 at para 95.

However, without supporting documents, I find that the Wife has not proven
that the Husband had such a policy.

Prudential Assurance Insurance Policy

56 Although the Husband’s CPF statement indicated that he made payments of
$42,660.00 to his Prudential Assurance policies, 50

##### Foot Note 50

×

PAM1 at p 185.

he denied having any Prudential Assurance policy which was paid for using the
CPF Investment Scheme in his reply to the Wife’s interrogatories. 51

##### Foot Note 51

×

PA2 at p 20.

While the Husband made credit card payments of $7,445.66 and $833.33 to
Prudential Assurance on 14 and 24 October 2015, 52

##### Foot Note 52

×

DSA at Annex D at p 152.

none of the Prudential Assurance policies declared by the Husband has an
annual premium which matches these sums. 53

##### Foot Note 53

×

PAM1 at pp 147–174.

I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that the Husband does have this
insurance policy and that it has a surrender value.

57 Since there was no evidence on the actual value of the undisclosed
insurance policy, I am unable to include any particular sum in the pool of
matrimonial assets. I will therefore deal with it when I consider whether an
adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband below.

(8) Unaccounted Stock Options

58 The Wife asserted that the Husband’s stock options which he received in
January 2018, amounting to USD8,739.00 ($12,409.38 based on the exchange rate
provided by the Husband), should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets
for division. 54

##### Foot Note 54

×

JSRI at p 25; DSA at Annex B at pp 118–119; DSA at para 74.

The Husband had failed to disclose these earlier, and his eventual position
was that these were "unvested shares". 55

##### Foot Note 55

×

PSA at para 99.

However, the Husband’s Equity Award Summary clearly showed that this amount of
shares is under the header, “Outstanding”, which means that the Husband has
unexercised and non-expired rights to these shares.

59 Even in the unlikely event that these shares were not vested, the Court of
Appeal in Chan Teck Hock David v Leong Mei Chuan [2002] 1 SLR(R) 76 at [17],
[27]–[29] has noted that the term “matrimonial asset” is given a wide meaning
to include “any asset of any nature”, and includes vested stock options as
well as unvested stock options which the Court classified as being choses in
action and contractual rights. All matrimonial assets, including any valuable
accrued rights such as stock options and future bonuses arising from
employment prior to the date of interim judgment, which existed as at the date
of the interim judgment are the relevant assets for distribution, see: AJR v
AJS at [4].

60 I will therefore include the sum of $12,409.38 in the pool of matrimonial
assets.

61 The following table sets out the amounts for the disputed assets to be
added to the pool of matrimonial assets:

S/No| Assets disputed to be matrimonial assets | Value ($)  
---|---|---  
1\. | MCST fees of Gilstead Road Property| 1,317.48  
2\. | Gifts to Third Party| 135,900.00  
3\. | Unaccounted stock options| 12,409.38  
| Total| 149,626.86  
  
Total pool of matrimonial assets

62 The total value of the pool of matrimonial assets is $7,052,255.58 as set
out below:

Class of Assets| Value ($)| Reference  
---|---|---  
Assets with agreed values|  2,191,360.25| [12] above.  
Assets with disputed values| 4,711,268.47| [29] above.  
Assets disputed to be matrimonial assets that have been included| 149,626.86|
[61] above  
Total| 7,052,255.58|  
  
Division of matrimonial assets

Methodology in ANJ v ANK

63 In ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ANJ v ANK”) the Court of Appeal sets out a
structured approach for the division of assets for dual income marriages. This
three-step approach was explained in TIT v TIU and another appeal [2016] 3 SLR
1137 at [21] as follows:

(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each
other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made
towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to
each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions;
and

(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking
an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as
“the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of
each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal
weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the
other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors
under s 112 or s 114(1) of the [WC].

64 Since the Parties both worked and have made direct and indirect financial
contributions, I will apply the structured approach in ANJ v ANK in the
division of the matrimonial assets.

Step 1: Direct Contributions

65 The Husband initially submitted that the broad brush approach should be
used to adopt the income method to determine direct financial contributions.
56

##### Foot Note 56

×

PSA at para 107; JSRI at p 30.

However, at the ancillary matters hearing, the Husband also submitted on the
Parties’ financial contributions for their respective properties, and
indicated that the contributions approach was to be taken. 57

##### Foot Note 57

×

NE 27 August 2018 at p 2.

The Wife opposed the use of the income method, and also proposed that the
contributions approach be adopted.

66 I accept the Wife’s submission that the income approach is unsuitable as
there is insufficient evidence on the incomes of the Parties throughout the
years of marriage up to 2017. The income statements admitted were for the
years of 2014 to 2016 for the Husband, and 1995 to 2017 for Wife. 58

##### Foot Note 58

×

JSRI at p 2; PAM1 at pp 312–314; DAM1 at pp 358–385.

Further, there was no evidence of the pooling of incomes for asset
acquisition. 59

##### Foot Note 59

×

NE 8 August 2018 at p 3.

Instead, the Parties acquired assets through the sales of their two previous
properties. Moreover, since the Parties had made their submissions based on
the contributions approach, I will adopt the contributions approach as the
most suitable approach.

67 In the JSRI, the Husband stated that the direct financial contributions
should be apportioned in the ratio of 80:20 between him and the Wife, while
the Wife stated that the ratio should be 60:40 instead. 60

##### Foot Note 60

×

JSRI at p 27.

68 The Parties currently own two properties, the Newton Property and the
Havelock Road Property. The Parties used to own two other properties, one in
the Toh Tuck Road Road area (“Toh Tuck Road Property”) and the Novena
Property. The tracing of the contributions of the Parties towards these two
previous properties will be taken into consideration for ascertaining their
contributions to the Newton Property and Havelock Road Property.

Toh Tuck Road Property

69 The Parties bought the Toh Tuck Road Property in 1990, contributing
approximately equally towards its acquisition. It was sold in early 1994 at a
profit of more than $250,000.00. 61

##### Foot Note 61

×

DSA at paras 94, 97; DAM1 at pp 354–356; Exhibit H1 (“H1”).

The sale of the Toh Tuck Road Property was timed with the purchase of the
Novena Property in June 1994 so that the refunds of the CPF moneys from the
sale of the Toh Tuck Road Property were utilised to purchase the Novena
Property. 62

##### Foot Note 62

×

DAM1 at para 73.

The cash sale proceeds from the moneys of Toh Tuck Road Property were also
utilised to pay for the Novena Property. 63

##### Foot Note 63

×

DSA at para 101.

Novena Property

70 The Wife submitted that the Parties’ financial contributions towards the
Novena Property were in the ratio of 56.3:43.7 between the Husband and her. 64

##### Foot Note 64

×

DSA at para 101.

The Husband disputed this, and asserted that the ratio was 67.35:32.65
instead: see H1 (Breakdown of the Parties’ financial contributions for the
respective properties). On the totality of the evidence adduced, I accept the
Wife’s submitted ratio over the Husband’s submitted ratio. I accept that the
proceeds of sale from the Toh Tuck Road Property, which was acquired by the
Parties with almost equal financial contributions from each of them, were
utilised to pay for the Novena Property’s option moneys, initial down payment
and capital payment at completion. 65

##### Foot Note 65

×

DSA at para 101.

Moreover, the Husband did not provide any documentary evidence to support his
assertions that he made cash repayments of $211,000.00 towards the mortgage,
$115,000.00 for renovation costs and $34,000.00 for maintenance or sinking
funds. 66

##### Foot Note 66

×

H1.

In any event, I note that the Husband’s submitted ratio of 67.35:32.65 in H1
is arithmetically incorrect. If his figures are accepted, the ratio of should
be 69.9:30.4 instead.

71 The Novena Property was sold en bloc in July 2011, giving a profit of
$2,268,646.95 (comprising $2,035,817.85, $184,500.00 and $48,329.10) which the
Parties agreed to use to fund the purchase of the Newton Property in September
2011. 67

PSA at para 114; DAM1 at paras 92-93, pp 155 –156 and p 295; DSA at p 49.

Newton Property

72 I now deal with the dispute on the direct contributions to the Newton
Property. The Parties agreed that the estimated total amount they paid towards
the purchase of the property was $3,678,364.85, after taking into account the
outstanding mortgage loan and renovation loan. 68

##### Foot Note 68

×

DSA at para 108; H1.

73 The Wife submitted that the contribution ratio should be 55:44 between the
Husband and her, while the Husband submitted that it should be 79:21 instead.

74 I accept the Parties’ submissions on the CPF contributions as both made the
same proportion of CPF repayments (whether monthly or in total) with
supporting documents. 69

##### Foot Note 69

×

DSA at para 109; H1.

I also accept the Wife’s calculations on the sale proceeds from the Novena
Property, that was apportioned between them in the proportions decided above
at [70]. 70

##### Foot Note 70

×

DSA at para 109.

75 However, for the monthly payments in cash for the mortgage, the Wife
claimed that she made $93,000.00 in cash payments while the Husband did not
contribute at all for the monthly mortgage. On the other hand, the Husband
claimed that he contributed $7,668.46 while the Wife paid $1,500.00 for the
monthly repayments in cash. On this matter, I find that both parties have not
provided any supporting documentation and have not proven their respective
monthly contributions on a balance of probabilities. In the circumstances, I
am constrained to exclude their direct cash contributions from the
calculations.

76 Even though the Husband did not include them as his financial
contributions, I find that the Husband has contributed to maintenance repairs,
servicing of air-conditioning and management and conservancy fees for the
total value of $9,099.00 and had paid $7,800.00 for property tax (collectively
“Miscellaneous Fees”). 71

##### Foot Note 71

×

PCB at pp 388–414.

77 Finally, I also disagreed with the Husband’s approach in calculating the
direct contributions towards the Newton Property, where he only took into
account monthly repayments in CPF and cash, but disregarded the Parties’
initial down payment for the Newton Property from the sale proceeds of the
Novena Property and the apportionment between them for this down payment. 72

##### Foot Note 72

×

DSA at para 117(b); H1.

78 In the result, I set out below my findings on the Parties’ respective
direct financial contributions to the Newton Property. I omit the contribution
ratio as it will not be used in the determination of the division of the
matrimonial assets when the global assessment methodology is applied:

Newton Property| Husband| Wife| Total  
---|---|---|---  
CPF ($)| 727,174.33| 526,548.69| 1,253,723.02  
Utilised Sale Proceeds from Novena Property apportioned in the ratio of
56.3:43.7 between the Husband and the Wife ($)| 1,277,248.23| 991,398.72|

Total ($)| 2,021,321.56| 1,517,947.41| 3,539,268.97  
  
Havelock Road Property

79 The Parties agreed that the Havelock Road Property was purchased in 1998 at
$845,000.00 with a mortgage loan of $676,000.00. The outstanding mortgage loan
was $276,936.94 as at 31 January 2017. 73

##### Foot Note 73

while she made CPF contributions of $126,068.71. 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

PAM1 at p 234; DAM1 at p 351.

The Husband submitted that he initially did not make any CPF contributions but
had later contributed $169,000.00, which is strangely less than what the Wife
credited the Husband for his CPF contributions. 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

JSRI at p 30; H1.

Since there is no reason not to accept the Wife’s figure, which is also borne
out by the Husband’s CPF statement, I find the Husband’s CPF contributions to
be $245,947.84.

81 As for the initial down payment of $169,000.00, the Husband submitted that
it was solely borne by him, though he provided no supporting evidence. 76

##### Foot Note 76

×

PSA at para 117(a).

The Wife submitted that this amount of $169,000.00 was paid in cash from their
joint bank account using the proceeds from the sale of the Toh Tuck Road
Property, and hence should be apportioned equally between the Parties. I am
unable to accept this submission, as I have already attributed the entire
proceeds from the Toh Tuck Road Property for the purchase of the Novena
Property in 1994, leaving nothing available for the down payment for the
Havelock Road Property which was purchased in 1998. In the absence of evidence
on the source of this $169,000.00, I find that it came from the Husband.

82 As for the mortgage payments totalling $399,063.06, I accept the Wife’s
submission that they should be attributed equally to the Parties, given that
they were paid out of the Parties’ joint account ending with 3198. 77

##### Foot Note 77

×

DSA at para 113; PCB at pp 429–430.

I also accept the Wife’s submission that since the rental income received from
the Havelock Road Property was used to pay the monthly loan instalments, it
ought to be considered as belonging jointly to the Parties, as it was income
earned on an asset that was jointly owned: Twiss, Christopher James Hans v
Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast [2015] SGCA 52 at [18].

83 Finally, despite the Husband not factoring the following contributions into
the calculations, I have taken into account the Husband’s direct contributions
to the renovation, maintenance, agency fees, stamp duties and property tax
(“Miscellaneous Fees”) for the Havelock Road Property, amounting to a total of
$11,417.10. 78

Summary of direct contributions

85 In summary, I set out below my findings on the Parties’ direct
contributions towards all the assets that were included in the pool of
matrimonial assets to be divided:

86 The ratio of direct contributions between the Husband and the Wife is
rounded up to 63.1:36.9.

Step 2: Indirect Contributions

87 In the JSRI, the Husband proposed a ratio of 80:20 between him and the Wife
for the indirect contributions while the Wife proposed a ratio of 30:70
instead. 79

##### Foot Note 79

JSRI at p 27 and DSA at para 145.

In deciding the appropriate ratio for the indirect contributions of the
Parties, I take into consideration the following factors:

(a) The marriage was a relatively long one of 31 years.

(b) This was a dual-income household, where the Wife was a working mother and
also the primary caregiver of the Children. The Wife took charge of their
education, birthdays, vacations, health and discipline. 80

infidelity at about the same time, and her father was also undergoing a major
operation during that period. 84

They were then aged only 12, 11 and 7, respectively. Considering the Husband’s
extra-marital affair, it would have certainly affected the amount of time he
could have devoted to his family and the Children.

(g) When the youngest child was born, the Wife took unpaid leave for six
months to care for the child since her employer only provided maternity leave
for the first two children. The Husband did not take any time off and did not
contribute to caring for this child. 87

He fetched the Children to school when they were younger, helped them with

marriage had broken down. For the two older children, the Husband had visited
them when they were studying overseas, upgraded their air tickets to business
class using his airline miles and helped them obtain internships and
subsequent employment after they graduated. He helped the eldest child to
overcome visa problems so that he could complete his overseas education. 95

88 In my assessment, I am guided by the following cases:

(a) Even in households where both parties are working full-time, absent
concrete evidence to the contrary, the wife will ordinarily be the party who
renders greater indirect contributions (ANJ v ANK at [24]).

(b) In Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin [2009] 4 SLR(R) 935 at [20], the Court
of Appeal acknowledged that the managerial role of a wife in ensuring the
smooth running of a household is at least as essential and important as the
direct performance of the chores itself, especially where the wife personally
took care of the needs of the children while holding down a regular full-time
job.

(c) In Smith Brian Walker v Foo Moo Chye Julie [2009] SGHC 247 the wife had
helped the husband to secure a consultancy project during the period of
cohabitation before their marriage (at [13]). He received from this a
substantial commission that he used to fund the purchase of a property. The
High Court accepted the significant indirect contribution of the wife, and
increased her share in the property.

(d) In UNE v UNF [2018] SGHCF 12, the parties were married for 29 years and
have two adult children. The wife was the main caregiver, and worked full-time
for around 19 years of the marriage before assuming the role of a homemaker
for the final ten years. The High Court held the ratio of indirect
contributions between the wife and the husband to be 75:25.

(e) In UAP v UAQ [2018] 3 SLR 319, the wife had made serious sacrifices to
support the husband in his overseas attachments and night classes for his
post-graduate degree while she took care of their child. This was considered a
significant indirect contribution (see [80]), and the High Court held the
ratio of indirect contributions between the wife and the husband to be 80:20.

(f) In UTJ v UTK [2019] SGHCF 6, the parties were married for 41 years. They
had both worked and relied on a domestic helper who was supervised by the
wife. The wife retired in 2004, and parties divorced on May 2015. The husband
contributed to the bulk of the family expenses, and the High Court held the
ratio of indirect contributions between the wife and the husband to be 60:40.

89 Assessing the totality of the evidence, I am of the view that an indirect
contribution ratio of 70:30 between the Wife and the Husband would be just and
equitable.

Step 3: Average ratio

90 As stated in ANJ v ANK at [27], based on the circumstances of the case, the
average ratio of contributions may be adjusted by giving different weights to
direct and indirect contributions. Factors affecting the weightage include the
length of the marriage, the size of the matrimonial assets and its
constituents, and the extent and nature of the indirect contributions.

91 In the present case, the Wife’s significant indirect contributions have
already been duly recognised by having a higher percentage given to it. In the
circumstances, I find it just and equitable to accord equal weight to the
Parties’ direct and indirect contributions.

92 In the result, from the ratios of the direct and indirect contributions, I
arrive at the overall average ratio of 46.55:53.45 between the Husband and the
Wife based on the computations in the table below:

| Husband (%)| Wife (%)  
---|---|---  
Direct Contributions| 63.1| 36.9  
Indirect Contributions| 30| 70  
Average ratio| 46.55| 53.45  
  
Adverse inference

93 As discussed earlier in [36]–[48] above, I find that the Husband has failed
to make full and frank disclosure of the following of his contributions and
assets:

(a) Other payments for the Gilstead Road Property;

(b) Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited Insurance policy;

(c) Undisclosed AXA Insurance policy; and

(d) Undisclosed Prudential Assurance Insurance policy.

94 For the Gilstead Road Property, although I find that the Husband did make
various payments, I can only return the known amounts of the moneys used by
the Husband to the pool of matrimonial assets ([44] – [45] above). For this,
and for the various insurance policies, as there is no evidence on what the
values of these policies are, I will draw an adverse inference and adjust the
division of the assets accordingly.

95 On the other hand, I decline to draw an adverse inference against the Wife
for allegedly not making full and frank disclosure of the following assets for
the reasons stated: 97

##### Foot Note 97

×

PSA at para 131.

(a) For the Wife’s Employee Pension Plan, the Husband failed to make a request
to the Wife during discovery or interrogatories to produce it ([31] above).

(b) For the Standard Chartered bank accounts that the Wife hid away, although
the Husband alleged the Wife has made several transfers of moneys through
these accounts, he did not provide any proof of these allegations ([35]-[36]
above).

(c) For the transfers of moneys, which the Wife claimed to belong to her
mother, through the Wife’s bank accounts, I accept that these moneys belong to
the mother ([34] above).

The Husband has not shown any substratum of evidence that establishes a prima
facie case against the Wife, the person against whom the inference is to be
drawn: see Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim [2015] 2 SLR 195 at [62].

96 Accordingly, I find that an adverse inference should only be drawn against
the Husband, and order that his share be reduced by 2.5%, and the Wife’s share
be correspondingly increased by 2.5%. The final ratio of division between the
Husband and the Wife is therefore 44:56 (rounded off).

97 Based on the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets of $7,052,255.58
(see [62] above), the Husband’s share of the matrimonial assets is
$3,102,992.46 and the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets is $3,949,263.12.

98 This is a just and equitable division. The Husband has been generous to the
Third Party, buying her expensive gifts which he never gave to the Wife,
providing her a supplementary credit card with a credit limit of $60,000 and
even upgrading her economy class air ticket to Hong Kong to a business class
air ticket using his accumulated air miles. 98

##### Foot Note 98

He also gave her various sums of money, including an amount of $100,000.00. 99

##### Foot Note 99

×

DSA at para 157.

It is also likely that the Husband has not disclosed all his assets.
Considering his income over the years of his career, the total value of his
assets would be more than that which he has declared, even after the Newton
Property and Havelock Road Property are included. 100

Apportionment of matrimonial assets

99 The Wife was prepared for the Newton Property and the Havelock Road
Property to be sold and the net proceeds of sale be used to satisfy the
Parties’ shares of the matrimonial assets. 101

##### Foot Note 101

×

DSA at para 176.

The Husband’s position was also to sell both properties. 102

##### Foot Note 102

×

PAM1 at p 45.

Given the Parties’ positions, I will not make any order save to direct that
the Parties should retain the various liquid assets in their own names. This
will minimise any transaction cost which is associated with a transfer.

100 The Parties will have to decide how the Havelock Road Property and the
Newton Property are to be sold and the proceeds of the sales divided, so that
each will obtain their respective shares of the total pool of matrimonial
assets. The Parties will have liberty to apply for directions on the division
of these properties within three months of this judgment if they are unable to
agree on how this is to be achieved.

Maintenance for the Wife

101 Section 113 of the WC sets out the power of the court to order maintenance
for former spouses, with the factors relevant to determining the quantum of
maintenance stated in s 114. The Court of Appeal held in Foo Ah Yan v Chiam
Heng Chow [2012] 2 SLR 506 (“Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow”) stated at [13]:

The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) of the Act is that of financial
preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard, which
is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had
enjoyed during the marriage. [emphasis added in bold]

It added that s 114(2) must be applied in a “commonsense holistic manner that
takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of a
marriage”: at [16]. Maintenance also plays only a supplementary role to an
order for division of matrimonial assets. The court takes into account the
Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets upon division before arriving at an
appropriate maintenance sum, see BG v BF [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 (“BG v BF”) at
[75]; and ATE v ATD and another appeal [2016] SGCA 2 at [33].

102 The Wife sought a lump sum maintenance of $2,280,000.00. This was
calculated on the basis of $10,000.00 per month (the difference between her
expenses and take home income per month) for a period of 19 years. 103

##### Foot Note 103

×

DSA at para 198.

She relied on the method set out in TNL v TNK at [61]:

The Wife’s basis for a 19-year multiplier is this court’s decision in Wan Lai
Cheng v Quek Seow Kee [2012] 4 SLR 405, where we followed (at [89]) the method
of quantifying an appropriate multiplier for a lump sum maintenance award set
out in our earlier decision in Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau Poo [1993] 2 SLR(R) 545
(at [35]). This method involves taking a compromise between the average life
expectancy of a woman and the usual retirement age of a Singapore male worker
less the wife’s present age, ie, [(average life expectancy of a woman + usual
retirement age of a Singapore male worker) ÷ 2] – the wife’s present age (“the
Ong Chen Leng method”).

[emphasis in original]

However, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal in TNL v TNK at [62], the “Ong
Chen Leng” method is not intended to be the only method of quantifying the
appropriate multiplier for a lump sum maintenance award, but is simply a guide
rather than a rule of law.

103 In contrast, the Husband submitted that no order for maintenance for the
Wife should be made, given that the Wife has been financially self-sufficient
throughout the marriage of 31 years, and that the Children are all grown up
and would provide for her financially. 104

##### Foot Note 104

×

PSA at para 142.

104 The Husband’s submission is inconsistent with settled authority: Foo Ah
Yan v Chiam Heng Chow, at [21]–[22]. It is also speculative as to whether the
Children will or will not be in a position to provide for the Wife
financially. In deciding the maintenance for the Wife, I take into
consideration the following factors. First, the share of matrimonial assets
that the Wife will receive is $3,949,263.12. Second, the Parties are 57 years
old and are approaching retirement. The Children are also no longer
dependants, and will be able to provide for themselves, whether or not they
are able to provide for the Wife financially. Third, the Wife’s average gross
monthly income is $12,809.67 and her monthly expenses amount to $11,058.91.
105

##### Foot Note 105

DAM1 at paras 17, 44.

Fourth, the Wife has to take care of her mother who is financially dependent
on her and she incurs an expenditure of approximately $800.00 a month on her
mother. This includes her mother’s medical expenses since she was no longer
able to rely on her husband’s pension benefits after he passed away, 106

##### Foot Note 106

×

DAM1 at paras 52–54; D3 at paras 118–119, pp 501–504.

and the cost of engaging a helper. Fifth, I also note that the Wife’s
insurance policies have matured after her recovery from cancer in 2008, and
her lack of personal medical insurance coverage puts her at risk of high
future medical expenses in the event of a relapse. 107

##### Foot Note 107

×

DAM1 at paras 162–163, 224.

However, I place lesser weight on this factor given its speculative nature.

105 The Wife submitted that she has suffered financial inequalities over the
years and has far less savings than the Husband. 108

##### Foot Note 108

×

DSA at para 183.

She also sacrificed her career and it was her indirect contributions to the
family that allowed the Husband to achieve professional success. 109

##### Foot Note 109

DSA at paras 184–185.

She relied on BG v BF where the Court of Appeal, summarising its earlier
decision in Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok Dennis [2004] 3 SLR(R) 376,
noted that “the rationale behind the law imposing a duty on a former husband
to maintain his former wife is to even out any financial inequalities between
the spouses, taking into account any economic prejudice suffered by the wife
during marriage” (at [75]). However, the Court of Appeal also stated in Foo Ah
Yan v Chiam Heng Chow, at [19], that “it is the reasonableness of the
maintenance claim vis-à-vis the husband’s ability to pay, which guides the
court’s application of financial preservation”.

106 Considering these circumstances in the round, I order that there be no
maintenance for the Wife. She has received a significant share of the
matrimonial assets, which comprise assets that are liquid in nature. It would
be sufficient for her to live comfortably, even after purchasing another
property.

Conclusion

107 I order costs of the ancillary matters proceedings against the Husband. In
so ordering, I have considered that the Husband has been uncooperative in
disclosing his assets despite the multiple requests made in discovery and
interrogatories: see JBB v JBA [2015] 5 SLR 153 at [33].

108 The costs of the divorce were also earlier adjourned: see [4] above.
Although no submissions were made on the order to be made, I note that the
counterclaim was contested until the Wife adduced irrefutable evidence of the
Husband’s relationship with the Third Party. The costs of withdrawal of the
statement of claim and the defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 1) were also
ordered to be borne by the Husband, to be taxed if not agreed. 110

##### Foot Note 110

FC/ORC 5403/2016 dated 18 October 2016.

I therefore order the costs of the divorce to be borne by the Husband, to be
fixed by me if not agreed.

109 In the event that costs are not agreed, the Parties are to file written
submissions on costs, limited to ten pages each excluding annexes on the
amounts of disbursements, within 14 days of this judgment for the costs of the
divorce and the ancillary matters proceedings to be fixed by me.
