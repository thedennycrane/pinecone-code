**JUDGMENT:**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. The plaintiff, Mr Richard Ang Ah Lah, who was disqualified by the
defendants, the Singapore Turf Club (hereinafter referred to as "STC"), sought
a declaration that the decision of STCs inquiry panel to disqualify him is
null and void. He also claimed damages for the loss and damage suffered by him
in respect of STCs decision and other consequential relief.

**

A. BACKGROUND

**

2\. Mr Ang, a professional horse trainer, was licensed as an "A Grade Trainer"
by the Malaysian Racing Association (MRA), an unincorporated sports
association which regulates horse racing in Singapore and West Malaysia
through four associated clubs, the Singapore Turf Club, the Penang Turf Club,
the Perak Turf Club and the Selangor Turf Club. All licensed horse trainers
are subject to MRAs Rules of Racing and Regulations. MRA delegated to STC its
powers and authority to punish errant trainers in accordance with the said
Rules of Racing and Regulations.

3\. Racehorses are routinely tested before and after a race to determine the
presence of prohibited substances. A blood sample is taken before a race and a
urine sample after the race. The tests for prohibited substances are conducted
at the MRA laboratory located at the premises of the Singapore Turf Club. The
MRA laboratory is an entity separate from and independent of STC.

4\. Mr Angs woes began on 19 August 2000 when Mr David Fisher, STCs Chief
Stipendiary Steward, was informed that urine samples from two horses which had
raced in Singapore a week ago, namely "_Star Dragon"_ and _"Sky Warrior",_ had
tested positive for Eltenac, a prohibited substance. These two horses were
trained by Mr Ang. Mr Fisher immediately informed Mr Ang of the finding and
drew his attention to the relevant rules of the MRA. He also told Mr Ang that
an inquiry would be conducted on a date to be fixed.

5\. Later that evening, shortly before the start of the first race, Mr Fisher
was informed that another horse trained by Mr Ang, namely "_Crystal Chilavert_
" had failed the pre-race blood test. This horse was withdrawn from the race.
Shortly before the start of the fifth race, Mr Fisher was informed that
_"Prinz Oskar",_ another horse trained by Mr Ang,__ also failed the pre-race
blood test and had to be withdrawn from the race. Mr Fisher told Mr Ang that
an investigation was pending with respect to this matter. For convenience, in
the rest of this judgment, "_Star Dragon_ ", "_Sky Warrior", "Crystal
Chilavert"_ and _"Prinz Oskar"_ will be referred to as "the four horses".

6\. On the same evening, security officers, acting under instructions,
searched Mr Angs office. After that, they searched his car. During the search,
they found a sling bag, which contained a brown clutch bag, in which were
found syringes, needles and medication. The medication included prohibited
substances. The security officers made a list of the items. The items were
stated in the list as two 100ml bottles of Xtrizine, one 100ml bottle of
Adenolin, one 100ml bottle of Tridenosen, one 20ml bottle of Rakelin, two 20ml
bottles of Telzenol, four pieces of 10ml syringes, one piece of 30ml syringe
and 14 needles.

7\. The term "Telzenol" recorded in the said list was a mistake. In fact, the
correct name of the medication is "Telzenac", which contains Eltenac, which,
as has been mentioned earlier on, is a prohibited substance. Mr Ang perused
the list and signed it. According to STC, Mr Ang should not have been in
possession of the syringes, needles and the bottles of Telzenac and Rakelin,
which is also a prohibited medication.

8\. On 22 August 2000, Mr Fisher informed Mr Ang by telephone that he was
required to attend an inquiry hearing the next day. Mr Ang was also told that
the inquiry would relate to the prohibited items seized from him on 19 August
2000. On the same day, Mr Ang wrote a letter to Mr Fisher asking for leniency.
In it, he stated as follows:

> This is a personal letter and I am ashame[d] of myself for letting you down
> despite of your leniency towards me in the past. I am totally wrong for my
> misjudgment and action which place me in this situation which I have no
> defence whatsoever and I am guilty in every sense.
>

>> My only hope now is that you can help me as far as you can, not to take
away my Trainers Licence in the final outcome of my cases involving the four
horses.

>>

>> I have never beg anyone in my life for help but this is one time I am
begging you for help and I sincerely hope that you can do so.

9\. Later that evening, Mr Ang collected a letter from the STC office. It
required him to "attend an inquiry relating to prohibited items seized from
you at SNTC on Sat 19 August 2000". The same letter advised Mr Ang that under
Rule 5B of the MRA Rules of Racing, he was not entitled to legal
representation.

10\. The inquiry was chaired by Mr David Fisher, the Chief Stipendiary Steward
of STC, and the inquiry panel included three other Stipendiary Stewards, Mr
Scott Matthews, Mr Peter Chadwick and Mr Rajendran s/o Pavadai. At the
inquiry, Mr Ang was charged with breaching Rule 203(d) of the MRA Rules of
Racing by having in his possession several syringes, needles and prohibited
medication. Four separate charges were also preferred against him for
breaching Rule 200(5) of the MRA Rules of Racing by administering Telzenac to
each of the four horses.

11\. Mr Ang pleaded guilty to all five charges. He was disqualified for a
period of two years with respect to each charge and as the disqualification
periods were to run consecutively, he was disqualified for a total of ten
years. Under Rule 1 of the MRA Rules of Racing, a disqualified person "shall
not be qualified to subscribe or enter or run or train or ride any horse
either in his own name or in the name of any other person for any race under
these rules".

12\. After Mr Ang was disqualified, he appealed against the decision of the
panel of Stipendiary Stewards. His appeal was heard by STCs Racing Stewards.
After hearing the appeal, the Racing Stewards decided as follows:

> (a) The sentence of a disqualification for two years on the first charge was
> upheld.
>
> (b) The sentence of a disqualification of two years for each of the
> remaining four charges was also upheld but with the following modifications:
>

>> (i) The period of disqualification for the second charge was to run
concurrently with the period of disqualification for the third charge.

>>

>> (ii) The period of disqualification for the fourth charge was also to run
concurrently with the period of disqualification for the fifth charge and
consecutive to the disqualification period with respect to the second and
third charges.

13\. In view of the aforesaid, Mr Angs total period of disqualification was
reduced from ten to six years.

14\. After his appeal to the Racing Stewards had been heard, Mr Ang instituted
this action. In essence, Mr Ang complained that the rules of natural justice
were not adhered to by STC as he was given insufficient notice of the hearing
of the inquiry and was not given an opportunity to defend himself.

**

B. PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE

**

15\. At the outset, it ought to be reiterated that domestic tribunals such as
STCs inquiry panel are required to observe the cardinal principles of natural
justice. The most important of these are that the accused should be given
reasonable notice of the charge to be brought against him and that he should
be given an opportunity to defend himself. However, when considering the
application of the principles of natural justice in the context of domestic
tribunals, the following words of Pilcher J in _Davies v Carew-Pole and
Ors_[1956] 1 WLR 833,__ 840 ought to be borne in mind:

> Domestic tribunals of this kind are entitled to act in a way which would not
> be permissible on the part of local justices sitting as a court of law. The
> requirement of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the case,
> the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the
> subject matter that is being dealt with, and so forth.

16\. In similar vein, in _Russell v Duke of Norfolk & Ors _[1949] 1 All ER
109, 118, Tucker LJ said as follows:

> There are, in my view, no words which are of universal application to every
> kind of inquiry and every kind of domestic tribunal. The requirements of
> natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the case, the nature of
> the inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject-
> matter that is being dealt with, and so forth. Accordingly, I do not derive
> much assistance from the definitions of natural justice which have been from
> time to time used, but, whatever standard is adopted, one essential is that
> the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his
> case.

Tucker LJs view was endorsed by Lord Guest in _Wiseman v Borneman_[1971] AC
297, by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in _Furnell v Whangarei High Schools
Board_[1973] AC 660, and by Lord Slynn in _Rees v Crane_[1994] 1 All ER 833.

17\. Admittedly, a layman would be somewhat disadvantaged without the
assistance of a lawyer at an inquiry such as the one conducted by STCs
Stipendiary Stewards on 23 August 2000 but this is an inevitable result of
having domestic tribunals. In _Davies v Carew-Pole & Ors _[1956] 1 WLR 833,__
839-840, Pilcher J put the matter in its proper perspective when he said as
follows:

> A layman at an inquiry of this kind is, of course, at a grave disadvantage
> compared with the trained advocate, but that is a necessary result of these
> domestic tribunals which proceed in a somewhat informal manner. Counsel for
> the plaintiff, in the course of his forceful argument in this point, again
> and again said: "What would be said of local justices who acted in this
> way?" With all due respect, the position is totally different. This matter
> is not to be judged by the standards applicable to local justices.

18\. The sensible approach adopted by Pilcher J in _Davies v Carew-Pole & Ors_
and by Tucker LJ in _Russell v Duke of Norfolk & Ors _will be followed for the
purpose of determining whether STCs inquiry panel observed the rules of
natural justice in Mr Angs case.

1\. _WHETHER THERE WAS SUFFICIENT NOTICE OF THE INQUIRY_

19\. Mr Ang had three complaints about the notice of the inquiry which he
received on 22 August 2000. First, he contended that he was not given adequate
notice of the inquiry, which was scheduled for the very next day. Secondly, he
said that he was given no notice of the charges faced by him at the inquiry.
Thirdly, he asserted that the notice of the inquiry that was served on him was
only in respect of the circumstances surrounding his possession of prohibited
items. As such, he claimed that he was given no notice that the administering
of prohibited medication to the four horses would also be discussed at the
inquiry.

__

_

(a) _Adequacy of notice of the inquiry_

_

20\. Mr Angs complaint that he was given one days notice of the inquiry would,
without more, have merited serious consideration. However, the short notice
must be viewed in the context of offences relating to horse racing and the
nature of an inquiry conducted by STC.

21\. The integrity of horse racing and public confidence in horse racing are
utmost in the minds of turf clubs. An inquiry into complaints of doping,
administering of prohibited substances to horses and possession of prohibited
items must be conducted swiftly as race events are held on a very regular
basis. Mr Fisher said that but for the fact that the prohibited items were
seized from Mr Ang on a race day, when officials of the club were preoccupied
with the races, an inquiry might have been held even earlier.

22\. The precise nature of an inquiry conducted by turf clubs, such as STC,
must be taken into account when considering whether an accused trainer has
been given sufficient notice of the inquiry. STC carries out investigations
into allegations of misconduct on the part of trainers primarily through an
inquiry. Such an inquiry is merely the _beginning_ of the formal stage of
investigating an allegation that a trainer has done something wrong. At the
initial stage of such an inquiry, all that is required of a trainer who has
been summoned to appear before the inquiry panel is that he offer an
explanation with respect to his alleged misconduct. When referring to an
inquiry into the misconduct of a horse trainer in _Russell v Duke of Norfolk
and Ors_ [1949] 1 All ER 109, 117, Tucker LJ explained:

> In dealing with this matter, I think it is essential to appreciate the
> precise nature of the inquiry. The horse is said to have been doped. The
> stewards have evidence which satisfies them that there is a _prima facie_
> case of doping. They require the trainer to attend the inquiry and to give
> an explanation. If in the course of that explanation, it is made manifest
> that there has been negligence or misconduct, a specific charge then
> emerges.

23\. Viewed in such a light and considering the urgency with which allegations
of misconduct on the part of horse trainers must be investigated, the fact
that an inquiry has been commenced at very short notice does not, by itself,
mean that the rules of natural justice relating to notice have not been
followed. Much depends on whether the accused trainer has indeed been
prejudiced by the short notice of the inquiry.

24\. The fact that an STC inquiry is merely the beginning of the formal
investigation into an alleged wrong and that an accused horse trainer, such as
Mr Ang, has ample opportunities to seek an adjournment of the inquiry if they
feel that they have had insufficient notice of the inquiry to be able to
present their case effectively must be borne in mind. To begin with, the
notice which Mr Ang received on 22 August 2000 specifically provided that if
he was unable to attend the inquiry due to exceptional circumstances, he was
to inform the Stipendiary Stewards Department at the earliest opportunity. In
such a case, a new date for the inquiry would be fixed if there are
circumstances to warrant this.

25\. Even after the commencement of the inquiry, Mr Angs right to call
witnesses was not prejudiced by the speed with which the inquiry was
commenced. He could have sought an adjournment of the inquiry for a variety of
reasons, including the calling of witnesses who were unable to be present at
the hearing on 23 August 2000. This was confirmed by Mr Fisher, who said as
follows during cross-examination and in reply to a question posed by me:

> Q. How can you expect witnesses to be called at such short notice?
>
> A. If he wanted to call witnesses who were unavailable, we would adjourn the
> hearing to another date unless this was a delaying tactic. __I do not recall
> an occasion where we have refused such a request.__
>
> Ct. Can you confirm that you have adjourned inquiry hearings to another day
> because the accused wanted to call witnesses?
>
> A. _Yes, quite often._
>
> (emphasis added)

26\. Furthermore, if Mr Ang had not admitted his guilt, the inquiry hearing
might have had to be adjourned to another date. Evidently, the STC panel of
Stipendiary Stewards knew this when they commenced the inquiry on 23 August
2000. For instance, if Mr Ang, who knew that he had a right to insist that
samples of his horses urine be sent to an independent laboratory in another
country for testing, had insisted that this be done, the inquiry hearing would
have had to be postponed until after the relevant test results had been
obtained.

27\. What is thus of utmost importance in this case is that Mr Ang was not
prejudiced at all by the short notice of the inquiry. He cannot claim to have
been surprised by the speed with which the inquiry of 23 August 2000 was
arranged as he was fully aware of the speed with which STCs inquiries are
arranged. In a previous inquiry into another breach committed by him, which
was held only one month earlier in July 2000, he was also given only one days
notice of the inquiry. He thus knew on 19 August 2000, the day he was caught
with prohibited items and was informed that his horses had failed tests, that
an inquiry would be held at any moment in relation to his possession of
prohibited items and the finding that four of his horses had been injected
with a prohibited substance.

28\. In truth, Mr Ang, who was expecting an inquiry to be held at a moments
notice, had given much thought to his case. He had consulted Dr Brian Stewart,
STCs veterinary surgeon about his case and about the nature of Eltenac, the
prohibited substance found in his horses. He had also laid the ground work for
a mitigation plea by lobbying both Mr Fisher and Dr Steward to help him
wherever possible. If he had wanted to, he would have called his witnesses to
be ready for an inquiry at short notice. When cross-examined, he did not deny
that he could have approached his witnesses between 19 August 2000 and 23
August 2000. He said as follows:

> Q. Between 19 and 23 August 2000, did you approach any one to be a witness?
>
> A. No.
>
> Q. You knew at the inquiry, you were entitled to call witnesses?
>
> A. Yes .
>
> Q. You told the inquiry panel that it was unnecessary to call witnesses.
>
> A. Yes, at that time.

29\. After careful thought, Mr Ang decided that the best strategy for him to
adopt at the inquiry was to admit the offences and hope that he would be
punished with only a fine. It is patently clear that he had no intention
whatsoever of denying his guilt at the inquiry. He confirmed this when he said
as follows during cross-examination:____

> Q. Were you not given the opportunity to say you did not personally
> administer Telzenac to the horses?
>
> A. Is it not clear to you that I was just agreeing to every question. I was
> trying to take the rap. Finish everything, hope to get a fine. I hoped that
> when I admit to everything, I will get a fine. That was all I was hoping
> for.

30\. In view of his decision to admit his guilt, he did not wish to call any
witnesses. At p 65 of the notes of the inquiry, he said as follows:

> Chairman: Any witnesses you would like to call in?
>
> Trainer Ang: No need sir because theres no need to implicate anybody else
> because I am responsible Sir.

31\. When cross-examined, Mr Ang confirmed that he did not intend to call any
witness for the inquiry. His answers were as follows:

> Q. You wanted to get the inquiry over and done with and you did not intend
> to call witnesses at the inquiry.
>
> A. Thats about it.

32\. Since Mr Ang had made up his mind to plead guilty in the hope that his
forthright admission of guilt will persuade the inquiry panel to be more
lenient to him, he cannot claim to have been prejudiced by the short notice of
the inquiry. In view of this and the fact that he could, if he had wanted more
time, have sought an adjournment of the inquiry in order to call witnesses,
read reports or to await the results of tests demanded by him, his assertion
that the inquiry proceedings should be set aside on the ground of inadequacy
of notice of the inquiry is thus rejected.

_

(b) _No notice of charges_

_

33\. Mr Angs next complaint was that before the inquiry hearing, he received
no notice of the charges which he had to face at the inquiry. In regard to
such a complaint in the context of horse racing, the following passage from
Tucker LJs judgment in _Russell v Duke of Norfolk and Ors_[1949] 1 All ER 109,
117, part of which has been cited earlier on in this judgment, ought to be
borne in mind:

> It does not seem to me that at the outset there is necessarily any
> particular charge made against the trainer. If in the course of [the
> trainers] explanation, it is made manifest that there has been negligence or
> misconduct, a specific charge then emerges, and that is exactly what
> happened in the present case. It was an inquiry in the course of which it
> emerged that there were matters for which the stewards held the trainer
> responsible.

34\. In short, the adversarial system, under which the prosecution is deemed
to have completed its investigation before proceeding to court, has no place
in the inquiry conducted by STCs Stipendiary Stewards on 23 August 2000. In
fact, in _Russell v Duke of Norfolk and Ors_ , Tucker LJ rightly added at p
117 that it would be a mistake to regard the proceedings in a domestic
tribunal as if they were prosecutions with a prosecutor and a defendant.

35\. I endorse Tucker LJ words. In this case, in view of the Security
Departments report and the fact that four of Mr Angs horses had been found to
have been administered a prohibited medication, there was a prima facie case
against him. If evidence is found in the course of the inquiry that Mr Ang had
committed an offence, a specific charge would then emerge.

36\. In any case, Mr Ang knew what he would be charged with. He knew that it
is an offence to be found with prohibited medication. He also knew that it is
an offence to administer a prohibited drug or medication to a horse. During
the course of the trial, he repeated on several occasions that he was aware
that under the MRA Rules of Racing, a horse trainer is deemed to be fully
informed and aware of the consequence of any medication or substance
administered to a horse under his charge. Surely, he must have been aware,
before the inquiry, that it is an offence to administer the prohibited
substance to the horse himself. In short, he was not prejudiced at all by the
lack of specific charges because he had a very good idea of the charges which
could be filed against him. In the circumstances, Mr Angs complaint that he
received no notice of the charges is dismissed.

__

___

(c) _Whether the second, third, fourth and fifth charges should have been the
subject of another inquiry_

_

37\. Mr Ang next contended that only the first charge, relating to possession
of prohibited items, was relevant to the inquiry and that the remaining four
charges relating to the administering of Telzenac to the four horses should
not have been dealt with by the inquiry panel on 23 August 2000. This is
because the notice of the inquiry given to him on 22 August did not mention
anything about the administering of Telzenac to the four horses. It merely
stated as follows:

> You are officially informed that you are required to appear before the
> Stipendiary Stewards of the Singapore Turf Club on Wed 23 August 2000 at 1
> pm _to attend an inquiry relating to prohibited items seized from you at
> SNTC on Sat 19 August 2000._
>
> (emphasis added)

38\. When questioned about the prohibited items seized from him on 19 August
2000, Mr Ang admitted not only that he had prohibited items in his possession
but also that he personally administered Telzenac to the four horses. As such,
although investigations into the presence of a prohibited substance in the
four horses were still going on, the inquiry panel saw it fit in the face of
Mr Angs unequivocal admission of guilt to press four additional charges
against him for breaching MRA Rule 200(5), which provides as follows:

> 200\. Any person who ..
>

>> (5) shall administer or cause to be administered to a horse which has been
entered for a race any prohibited substance, internally or by hypodermic or
other methods .

>>

>> may be disqualified, and such disqualification, if imposed, shall take
effect as from the date of the offence or from such other date as the
Committee of the Associated Club or Stewards may determine.

39\. The second charge against Mr Ang concerned his administering of Telzenac
to the horse, _"Star Dragon"._ It was in the following terms:

> Now the Stewards are charging you under [MRA Rule 200(5)] in that on your
> own admission, you, Trainer Ang, administered a prohibited substance, namely
> "Telzenac", to the horse, "_STAR DRAGON"_ , which was entered for and
> subsequently ran in Race 2 at the Singapore Turf Club Meeting on 12 August
> 2000 and a post-race urine sample taken from that horse confirmed the
> presence of Eltenac, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory and prohibited
> substance under the MRA Rules, thereby contravening MRA Rule 203(b).

40\. The third, fourth and fifth charges concerned his administering of
Telzenac to the other three horses, "_Sky Warrior", "Crystal Chilavert"_ and
_"Prinz Oskar"_ respectively.

41\. For the purpose of considering whether the second, third, fourth and
fifth charges ought to have been pressed against Mr Ang at the inquiry on 23
August 2000, the following words of Pilcher J in _Davis v Carew-Pole & Ors_
[1956] 1 WLR 833, 839, are worth noting:

> The mere fact that the accused person has not in a particular case been
> given formal notice of all the matters in which his conduct is to be called
> in question does not, in my view, necessarily entitle him to contend
> successfully that the proceedings of a tribunal consisting of fair-minded
> and honest laymen were not conducted in accordance with the principles of
> natural justice.

42\. In _Davis v Carew-Pole & Ors_, the plaintiff, a stable keeper, was
required to attend a meeting of the stewards of the National Hunt Committee to
inquire into an allegation that he, as an unlicensed trainer, had trained a
horse, named _Kings Henrys Road_ ,__ for a steeplechase in contravention of
the National Hunt Rules. During the course of the inquiry, his alleged
activities in connection with the training of two other horses, named _Prince
Balbo_ and _Belljinks,_ were considered. There was no doubt that the plaintiff
had not received any prior notification that his activities in connection with
the training of _Prince Balbo_ or _Belljinks_ were also to be the subject of
the inquiry. At the end of the inquiry, the stewards were satisfied that he
should have been aware of the relevant regulations and declared him a
disqualified person. Pilcher J said at p 840:

> It may well be in the present case that, although not formally notified of
> the alleged [offence regarding _Prince Balbo_] and the alleged offence in
> regard to [_Belljinks_], the plaintiff had a shrewd suspicion that those
> matters would be inquired into. In any event, as I say, _no fact was in
> dispute in relation to these other matters_ and in the circumstances of the
> present case I am not prepared to hold, as a matter of law that the
> plaintiff is entitled to succeed in his contention that the inquiry was not
> held in accordance with the principles of natural justice, _because I do not
> think that the plaintiff was, on the facts of the case, prejudiced by the
> lack of notice._
>
> (emphasis added)

43\. In the above-mentioned case, Pilcher J laid great emphasis on the fact
that in relation to the other matters raised at the inquiry, no facts were in
dispute, and that the accused was not prejudiced by the discussion on the
additional matters. The present case is similar to _Davis v Carew-Pole & Ors._
In the present case, the facts relating to the second, third, fourth and fifth
charges, which concern the administering of Telzenac to the four horses, were
also not in dispute because he admitted his guilt.

44\. Furthermore, Mr Ang must have had, what Pilcher J termed, a "shrewd
suspicion" that the matters relating to the administering of Telzenac to the
four horses would also be raised at the inquiry on 23 August 2000. That was
why after having been told that there would be an inquiry on the following day
relating to prohibited items seized from him on 19 August 2000, Mr Ang wrote
to Mr Fisher on 22 August 2000 as follows:

> My only hope is that you can help me as far as you can, not to take away my
> Trainers licence in the final outcome of my cases __involving the four
> horses.__
>
> (emphasis added)

45\. In any case, in an inquiry with respect to the prohibited items seized
from Mr Ang, a relevant question must surely relate to what he did with the
prohibited items. He admitted without any qualification whatsoever, that he
administered Telzenac to the four horses. The validity of his guilty plea will
be considered later on. All that needs to be stated here is that in the face
of his unqualified admission of guilt, the Stipendiary Stewards were entitled
to frame charges against him in relation to the administering of the
substances to the four horses. As such, his contention that there was a breach
of the rules of natural justice when the second, third, fourth and fifth
charges were framed at the inquiry on 23 August 2000 cannot be countenanced.

(2)****_REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD_

46\. As has been mentioned, one of the cardinal principles of natural justice
is that the accused must be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

47\. There is no doubt that Mr Ang was given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard. Mr Fishers opening statement at the beginning of the inquiry hearing
and Mr Angs reply were recorded at p 1 of the notes of the inquiry as follows:

> Chairman: You may call any witnesses to the Inquiry and make any statements
> to the Stewards and you can present any evidence that you wish. You can
> question any evidence or witnesses that the Stipendiary Stewards might
> introduce. Do you understand the position and your rights?
>
> Trainer Ang: Yes.

__

Calling of witnesses

__

48\. The fact that Mr Ang had the opportunity to call witnesses to testify at
the inquiry but did not do so has already been considered. It must also be
noted that he was even afforded an opportunity to call witnesses to speak on
his behalf after he pleaded guilty to the charges. At p 78 of the notes of the
inquiry, the exchange of words between Mr Fisher and Mr Ang was recorded as
follows:

> Chairman: Mr Ang, are there any witnesses that you would like to call in to
> speak on your behalf on mitigation?
>
> Trainer Ang: Not necessary, Sir.

__

Opportunity to read reports

__

49\. Mr Ang complained that before the inquiry, he was not given relevant
reports, such as the Security Departments report and the analysts report on
the tests on the four horses, for his perusal.

50\. At the beginning of the inquiry, Mr Ang was invited to read the Security
Departments Report. Mr Fishers invitation and Mr Angs reply were recorded in
pp 2-3 of the notes of the inquiry in the following terms:

> Chairman: [S]ecurity has submitted a report to me, a copy of which I have
> here. If you wish to see any part of the report, you may do so.
>
> Trainer Ang: No need, Sir.
>
> Chairman: I will be referring to extracts from it. However, you may see any
> part of this as Ive referred to.
>
> Trainer Ang: Not necessary, Sir.

51\. Later on in the inquiry, Mr Fisher again invited Mr Ang to read the
entire report from the Security Department. At p 33 of the notes of the
inquiry, the relevant extract is as follows:

> Chairman: . Im offering you the chance to read the report in full.
>
> Trainer Ang: No need, no need; because they have found everything there.

52\. Mr Ang paid attention to the parts of the Security Departments report
which were read to him at the inquiry. He said that notwithstanding what was
stated in the report, he did not try to hide the brown bag containing the
prohibited items. He did not dispute the other parts of the report. Having
opted not to view the report, he is in no position to assert that his right to
see the Security Departments report has been infringed.

53\. As for the analysts report on the finding of prohibited substances in the
four horses, Mr Ang did not doubt the findings of the MRA laboratory. At the
inquiry, he made this clear when he declined to insist on his right to have
samples of the urine of the four horses sent to another laboratory for
testing. This will be discussed in greater detail later on in this judgment.

__

Questioning of STCs witnesses

__

54\. Mr Ang was given the opportunity to question STCs witnesses. To begin
with, Mr Fisher invited Mr Ang to question Mr Lim from the Security
Department. This is evident from p 34 of the notes of the inquiry. The
relevant extract is as follows:

> Chairman: Mr Ang, this report was submitted to me by Lim Ah Tee, from
> Security Department . Are there any questions that you want to ask him
> regarding this report or the content of this report.
>
> Trainer Ang: Only thing is, I did not try to hide the bag.
>
> Chairman: Is there anything you want to question him about these items?
>
> Trainer Ang: No, the items are there. Theres no need to question him .

55\. Before the security officers left the premises, Mr Fisher asked Mr Ang
once more whether he wanted to question anyone from the Security Department.
Mr Ang declined to do so.

56\. Mr Ang was also invited to question Dr Brian Stewart, STCs veterinary
surgeon but he declined to do so. (See p 21 of the notes of the inquiry.)

57\. In short, Mr Ang cannot complain that he was given no opportunity to
defend himself by questioning STCs witnesses.

__

Referee samples

__

58\. To understand Mr Angs complaint in relation to the referee samples,
reference must be made to Rule 29 of the MRA Regulations, which provides as
follows:

> __Rule 29.2__
>
> When a urine sample is taken, it will be split into two samples, one sample
> will be analysed by the MRA laboratory; the other to be held by the
> Associated Club where the sample was taken.
>
> __Rule 29.3.1__
>
> Within seven (7) days of the trainer being notified of the presence of a
> prohibited substance from a sample collected from a horse under his charge,
> the trainer may request the referee sample be sent to one of the MRA
> approved laboratories. When despatching the referee sample to the nominated
> laboratory, the associated Club shall ask the nominated laboratory to
> confirm the presence of the prohibited substance found by the MRA laboratory
> in the first sample.
>
> __Rule 29.5__
>
> All costs arising from the despatch of the referee sample to the nominated
> laboratory shall be to the account of the trainer.

59\. Mr Ang complained that after he made an oral request for the referee
samples of the urine of the four horses to be sent to an independent
laboratory for testing, STC failed to act on his request. In his statement of
claim, he stated that STCs omission unfairly deprived him of vital evidence
which might have showed that the MRA laboratorys test results were flawed.

60\. Mr Fisher said that as a trainer has to bear the cost of such a test, he
asked trainers who require a referee sample to be sent to an independent
laboratory for testing to make their request in writing in order to avoid a
dispute as to whether or not such a request has been made after the cost has
already been incurred. Admittedly, the relevant rule does not require a
request to be made in writing but it was not difficult for Mr Ang to make his
request in writing. In any case, Mr Fisher, who was fully aware of Mr Angs
right to have the referee sample tested, asked him at the inquiry whether he
still required the referee samples to be tested. The following exchange of
words between Mr Fisher and Mr Ang was recorded in p 43 of the notes of the
inquiry:

> Chairman: Im asking you now because those Inquiries were pending, your
> decision on whether you wanted to send the referee samples away?
>
> Trainer Ang. No, not necessary, Sir.

61\. When he was cross-examined, Mr Ang claimed that at the inquiry, he
thought that the referee samples had already been sent for testing and that
the inquiry panel had the test results. He said as follows:

> Q. At the inquiry, you were asked whether you wanted the referee samples to
> be sent for testing?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Q. You declined this offer because you knew that the prohibited substance in
> your bag was Eltenac?
>
> A. I totally disagree. I was under the impression that my oral request was
> met with. I thought that he had the results.

62\. Mr Angs contention that he thought that the referee samples had already
been tested and that Mr Fisher had the results is absolutely untenable. He
must have known that if the samples had indeed been sent to a laboratory in
another country for testing after he made an oral request on the evening of 19
August 2000, which was a Saturday, the results could not have been available
on 23 August 2000. In any case, the following exchange of words between Mr
Fisher and Mr Ang at p 43 of the notes of the inquiry puts paid to any
suggestion that Mr Ang could have been mistaken about whether the referee
samples had already been sent away for testing:

> Chairman: . So you had the Right within seven days. _Do you still wish to
> send those referee samples away_?
>
> Trainer Ang: No, because if say is anti-inflammatory, it must be the
> substance administered by myself. So, there is no need to doubt the Lab. I
> mean if were questioning the integrity and the ..
>
> (emphasis added)

63\. There is thus no doubt that even at the inquiry stage, Mr Ang had the
opportunity to have the referee samples sent for testing. Having not exercised
his right, he has no grounds for complaining that the referee samples were not
sent for testing.

__

Mr Ang was given an opportunity to defend himself

__

64\. In view of the fact that Mr Ang was given the opportunity to call
witnesses, read the relevant reports, question STCs witnesses and insist that
the referee samples be sent to an independent laboratory, his assertion that
he was not afforded an opportunity to defend himself is rejected.

_

_**

C. THE VALIDITY OF THE PLEA OF GUILT

**

65\. At the inquiry on 23 August 2000, Mr Ang pleaded guilty to all the five
charges. However, he asserted that his guilty plea was not valid.

66\. In _Ganesun s/o Kannan v PP_[1996] 3 SLR 560, 563 _,_ Yong Pung How CJ
reiterated that a plea of guilt must be valid and unequivocal and that the
court must ensure that it is the accused himself who wishes to plead guilty,
that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and that
the accused intends to admit without qualification the offence he is alleged
to have committed.

67\. The evidence does not show that Mr Ang did not wish to plead guilty or
that he did not understand the nature and consequences of his plea.

68\. As for the first charge, which concerns the possession of prohibited
items and drugs, Mr Ang clearly knew what he was doing when he pleaded guilty.
To begin with, he admitted that needles, syringes and prohibited medication
were found on him. He also admitted that the prohibited bottles of medication
were his property. During cross-examination, he said as follows:

> Q. These items belonged to you.
>
> A. I did not deny they were my bottles.

69\. At the inquiry, Mr Ang was given innumerable opportunities to deny that
the prohibited items were his. Mr Fisher was cautious enough to ask him more
than once whether the said items belonged to him. His questions and Mr Angs
replies, as recorded in p 34 of the notes of the inquiry, are as follows:

> Chairman: Ill ask you once more, do you accept that these items as listed
> here 1-8 were in your possession and in your brown bag?
>
> Trainer Ang: Yah, they were there, they were right in front of me. Theres no
> denying it.
>
> Chairman: And you admit they, some of which, are prohibited substances?
>
> Trainer Ang: No denying, Im as guilty as it comes. Yes, Im not denying that,
> Sir.

70\. Mr Ang admitted his guilt again when he declined to question Mr Lim from
the Security Department. At p 34 of the notes of the inquiry, the relevant
questions and answers are as follows:

> Chairman: Is there anything that you want to question [Mr Lim] about these
> items?
>
> Trainer Ang: No, the items are there.
>
> Chairman: The concern we have is for these items and the possession.
>
> Trainer Ang: Because the items are there, no denying. No denying, Sir.

71\. When questioned by Mr Rajendran, a member of the inquiry panel, Mr Ang
again confirmed that he had the prohibited items in his possession. The
relevant questions and answers, as recorded in p 31 of the notes of the
inquiry, are as follows:

> Mr Rajendran: Why would you ask [the security personnel] for the help?
>
> Trainer Ang: Because inside the bag was a lot of medication.
>
> Mr Rajendran: Which were prohibited, right?
>
> Trainer Ang: Some of them were prohibited.
>
> Mr Rajendran: [W]hat I am trying to establish is whether you knew that it
> was.
>
> Trainer Ang: _If I did not, if I didnt know what it was, I wont ask him to
> help._
>
> (emphasis added)

72\. It is pertinent to note that when Mr Ang was questioned by the police, he
admitted that the prohibited items were in his possession. He confirmed this
at the inquiry. At p 64 of the notes of the inquiry, he said as follows:

> Chairman: And you accepted and you also advised the police that you had
> these items in your possession.
>
> Trainer Ang: Yes, yes, I told them, theres no denying.

73\. When cross-examined, he also confirmed that he told the police that he
had the prohibited substances in his possession. He said as follows:

> Q. Did you advise the police that you administered the medication and you
> had possession of them.
>
> A. Yes, I did.

74\. Mr Arul contended that Mr Ang should not have been found guilty of
possessing prohibited items because there was no proof that the bottles in
question contained prohibited medication. This argument ignores the fact that
Mr Ang admitted that he had in his possession needles and syringes, which are
also prohibited items. In any case, as far as the contents of the bottles of
medication are concerned, Mr Ang did not deny that they were properly labelled
or that the contents therein were not the medication stated in the labels.
When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> Q. Were the bottles properly labelled?
>
> A. I cannot deny that the labels were there.

75\. As for the second, third, fourth and fifth charges which concerned the
administering of Telzenac to the four horses which had been entered for the
race, Mr Ang also admitted his guilt on innumerable occasions during the
inquiry. He also said that although he knew that the substance was prohibited,
he administered it to the four horses as he had been told that it could not be
detected in the pre-race blood test and post-race urine test conducted by the
MRA laboratory.

76\. Mr Arul submitted that Mr Angs plea of guilt in relation to his
administering of Telzenac to the four horses is invalid because he was under
the mistaken impression that he was only going to be charged under MRA Rule
203(d), which concerns the absolute liability of a trainer for prohibited
substances found in his horse and not under MRA Rule 200(5), which is
applicable where a trainer has personally administered a prohibited substance
to his horse. Mr Arul explained that as Mr Ang was under the mistaken
impression that the effect of MRA Rule 203(b) is that he is guilty of an
offence regardless of whether or not he has personally administered a
prohibited substance to any of the horses under his training and care, he
pleaded guilty to the charges under MRA Rule 200(5).

77\. This submission is untenable as Mr Ang repeatedly acknowledged at the
inquiry that he personally administered Telzenac to the horses. At p 42 of the
notes of the inquiry, the relevant extract is as follows:

> Chairman: Youre saying that you administered Eltenac to those horses?
>
> Trainer Ang: I am personally responsible for that and theres no denying
> there because I got no defence whatsoever, Ive got no intent to put in any
> defence.
>
> Chairman: So, Mr Ang, to reiterate then, are you saying that STAR DRAGON and
> SKY WARRIOR returned positive to Eltenac because you administered that?
>
> Trainer Ang: Thats right, Sir, yes.

78\. Mr Fisher then asked Mr Ang about the amount of prohibited medication
administered to the horses. His question was very specific and referred to Mr
Angs own act. The relevant extract from p 43 of the notes of the inquiry is as
follows:

> Chairman: How much did _you_ administer to those horses?
>
> Trainer Ang: Also 2 mls, Sir.
>
> (emphasis added)

79\. Within a short time after the above answer, Mr Fisher returned to the
subject of Mr Angs personal liability. At p 46 of the notes of the inquiry,
the following extract may be found:

> Chairman: Mr Ang, can I just ask you did you personally administer
> medication to these four horses, STAR DRAGON, STAR WARRIOR, CRYSTAL
> CHILAVERT and PRINZ OSKAR?
>
> Trainer Ang: Yes, Sir.
>
> Chairman: You administered personally?
>
> Trainer Ang: Personally, yes, Sir.

80\. It should also be noted that Mr Ang told the inquiry panel that when he
was questioned by the police, he admitted that he administered the prohibited
medication to the horses. As is evident from p 64 of the notes of the inquiry,
he told the inquiry panel as follows:

> Chairman: Did you advise the Police that you administered this medication to
> your horses?
>
> Trainer Ang: Yes, yes, I told them I did.

81\. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that Mr Ang admitted his guilt
at the inquiry hearing, he said at the trial that his admission of guilt
should be ignored because he had told the inquiry panel a pack of lies. As for
his admission to the police, he also said that he lied to the police and that
it must be borne in mind that he was not under oath when he spoke to the
police. No one should, without more, expect a re-hearing of his case merely on
the ground that he had deliberately lied to the inquiry panel and the police.
In any case, Mr Ang did not establish that what he had told the inquiry panel
and the police were lies. As such, much more is required to show that his plea
of guilt is invalid.

__

Whether Mr Ang was confused at the inquiry

__

82\. Mr Angs final line of attack with respect to the validity of his plea of
guilt was that he was so confused and emotional during the inquiry that he was
in no position to understand the ramifications of his plea of guilt.

83\. Throughout the trial, Mr Ang claimed that he was too confused at the
inquiry on 23 August 2000 to be able to think clearly. However, a perusal of
the notes of the inquiry will show that Mr Ang did not appear to have been a
confused man at the inquiry. It must be noted that what Mr Ang told the
inquiry panel was consistent with what he told the police when they
interviewed him before the inquiry. He had intended that at the inquiry, he
would stick to what he told the police. During cross-examination, he said as
follows:

> Since I said those things at the police station, I might as well say the
> same things at the inquiry so that I dont have to implicate anybody.

84\. It was not alleged that Mr Ang was confused when he gave his statement to
the police. As such, if he merely repeated at the inquiry what he told the
police earlier on, namely that he had in his possession prohibited items and
that he had administered a prohibited substance to his horses, his contention
that he was so confused at the inquiry that he would have pleaded guilty to
any charge framed against him at the inquiry cannot be countenanced.

85\. When cross-examined, Mr Peter Chadwick, a member of the inquiry panel,
confirmed that he did not think that Mr Ang was in a confused state during the
inquiry. He said as follows:

> Q. Do you agree that Mr Ang was confused and emotional?
>
> A. He was not confused during the inquiry.
>
> Q. Did you not think it prudent although Mr Ang did not request it, to
> adjourn the inquiry.
>
> A. Mr Ang did not break down. He did not act in a manner which would cause
> me any concern.
>
> Q. After five charges were preferred, was it not prudent to adjourn the
> hearing?
>
> A. The impression Mr Ang gave me was that he wanted the matter finalised. He
> had pleaded guilty and was willing to throw himself at the mercy of the
> inquiry panel.

86\. Mr Rajendran, another member of the inquiry panel, also did not think
that Mr Ang was confused at the inquiry. When cross-examined, he said as
follows:

> Q. What was Mr Angs emotional state at the inquiry?
>
> A. He threw in the towel when he came in and said that he was sorry. He was
> calm and cool.
>
> Q. Maybe, he was evasive or confused?
>
> A. Evasive, not confused.

87\. Mr Arul referred to p 62 of the notes of the inquiry, where Mr Ang said
in reply to a question by Mr Rajendran that he was so confused that he did not
know what was happening. This remark must be read in its proper context. When
he was cornered by STCs security officers on 19 August 2000, Mr Ang had asked
them not to open a brown bag because he said that it contained money. When the
bag was searched, it contained no money. Instead, it contained prohibited
items such as Telzenac, Rakelin, needles and syringes. The notes of the
inquiry revealed that Mr Ang had been confused by his own evidence with
respect to the brown bag, which was supposed to have contained money instead
of prohibited items. At first, he said that the brown bag containing the
prohibited items was the bag that was supposed to have contained his money.
Subsequently, he changed his position and claimed that there were two brown
bags instead. The relevant extract from p 62 of the notes of the inquiry is as
follows:

> Mr Rajendran: On the 16th, you came back from Perth?
>
> Trainer Ang: Yes, I came back from Perth with that bag of money.
>
> Mr Rajendran: Ok. Is that the same bag as?
>
> Trainer Ang: The same bag, yes. I think I got same bag, _it was the same
> bag._
>
> Mr Rajendran: You sure it was the same bag?
>
> Trainer Ang: _Im so confused, I dont know what is happening_.
>
> Mr Rajendran: Take your time, take your time.
>
> Trainer Ang: _Hang on, I had two bags in the bag._
>
> Mr Rajendran: So two bags?
>
> Trainer Ang: Ive two bags, both are brown.
>
> (emphasis added)

88\. Mr Rajendran took the view that Mr Angs confusion was limited to the
issue of the brown bags. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> Q. He said at p 62 of the Notes of Evidence that he was confused. Was he
> crying at this point?
>
> A. He was not crying. He was confused because he was trying to establish
> which bag it was.
>
> Q. If he is confused, is it possible that he did not understand what was
> going on?
>
> A. No. We were trying to establish which bag it was. I dont think he was
> confused. He perfectly understood what was going on.

89\. Mr Chadwick also had no doubt that Mr Angs confusion was only in relation
to his own explanation on the brown bags. When cross-examined, he said that
when Mr Ang said that he was confused, he was asking Mr Rajendran for a
clarification of his question with respect to the brown bag.

90\. After listening to the witnesses and evaluating the evidence, I have no
doubt that Mr Angs confusion was limited to the question of the brown bag and
that although he may have been stressed and anxious during the inquiry, he was
not so confused as to be unable to understand the proceedings or the
ramifications of his plea of guilt.

__

Lack of legal advice

__

91\. Mr Arul also submitted that Mr Angs plea of guilt was affected by a lack
of legal advice. Mr Ang claimed that he tried but failed to contact Mr Arul on
the day before the inquiry. It must be noted that Mr Ang knew that he was in
serious trouble and he knew from experience that an inquiry would be called at
any moment. He also knew that the MRA Rules did not permit him to be
represented by a lawyer at the inquiry. He would not have waited until the
last minute to try and contact Mr Arul or any other lawyer if he needed legal
advice. As has already been mentioned earlier on in the judgment, Mr Ang had
planned all along to admit his guilt in the hope of getting a lighter
sentence. In these circumstances, he is in no position to complain that he did
not have time to consult a lawyer or that he was not allowed any legal
representation at the inquiry. I thus find that Mr Angs decision to plead
guilty has got nothing to do with the lack of legal advice.

__

Whether Mr Ang pleaded guilty to void charges

__

92\. Mr Arul also submitted that the charges against Mr Ang were invalid for a
number of reasons.

93\. To begin with, the first charge will be considered. It concerns a breach
of Rule 203(d) of the MRA Rules of Racing, which provides as follows:

> No person other than an Official Veterinary Surgeon or a person authorised
> by the Club shall have in his possession _in any stable or grounds of a race
> track_ :
>

>> (i) any means of parenteral or nasogastric administration of any prohibited
substance;

>>

>> (ii) any prohibited substance.

>
> (emphasis added)

94\. As has been mentioned, Mr Ang was found with needles, syringes and
medication such as Rakelin and Telzenac. Needles and syringes are regarded as
means of parenteral administration of prohibited substances and Rakelin and
Telzenac are prohibited substances. Notwithstanding this, Mr Arul contended
that Mr Ang had not breached Rule 203(d) of the MRA Rules of Racing because he
was not found to have been in possession of the prohibited items while in any
stable or grounds of a race track. Instead, he was caught with the prohibited
items while in the car park. Whether or not a purposive construction of the
term "stable" should be employed so as to include within its ambit the stable
complex, an enclosed area which includes the car park, need not be considered
because Mr Ang admitted at the inquiry that the bag containing the prohibited
items was in his stable. At p 5 of the notes of the inquiry, he said as
follows:

> To be honest with you, Sir, I carried this bag around without realising it
> my stuff was in there. I had it in my bag when I, when I, when I was __in
> the stable in the morning of Thursday and actually I forgot it was in
> there__. And all the time I was carrying it around.
>
> (emphasis added)

95\. When he was questioned by Mr Rajendran, Mr Ang again admitted that the
prohibited items were brought to his stable. The following extract from p 59
of the notes of the inquiry makes this clear:

> Mr Rajendran: When did you bring to your stable?
>
> Trainer Ang: On the Thursday.
>
> Mr Rajendran: That was on the 17th you are trying to tell?
>
> Trainer Ang: Yes.

96\. As for the contention that the search conducted by STCs security officers
in the car park was illegal, this is not tenable because Rule 203(e) of the
MRA Rules of Racing specifically provides that STCs security officers are
entitled to "enter and search any stable and any _stable complex_ "_._ Surely,
the car park within the fenced-up enclosure in which the respective stables of
the trainers are located is part of the stable complex. In these
circumstances, the argument that the first charge against Mr Ang is invalid
has no merit.

97\. In regard to the second, third, fourth and fifth charges against Mr Ang
concerning the administering of Telzenac to the four horses, Mr Arul pointed
out that all that Mr Ang had admitted to at the inquiry was that he had
administered Telzenac to the four horses on the Thursday before the relevant
Saturday race day. He pointed out that Dr Kimberley John Rose, an Australian
veterinary surgeon, gave evidence to the effect that if a horse had been given
Telzenac on a Thursday, there would be no trace of the medication by Saturday.
In view of this, he said that Mr Angs plea of guilt was ineffective as it was
impossible to relate his admission that he administered Telzenac to the horses
on Thursday to the failure of the horses to pass the tests on Saturday.

98\. The above argument fails to take into account the effect of Rule 200(5)
of the MRA Rules of Racing, which provides that any person who administers any
prohibited substance to a horse _"which has been entered for a race"_ may be
disqualified. Mr Ang knew that the horses had already been entered for a race
when he administered Telzenac to them on Thursday. At p 39 of the notes of the
inquiry, he said as follows:

> Chairman: So when you administered this medication to CRYSTAL CHILAVERT and
> PRINZ OSKAR on or about the 17th of August, were you aware that you were
> administering a prohibited substance?
>
> Trainer Ang: Yes, Sir.
>
> Chairman: And were you aware that that would be contrary to the Rules as
> those horses were entered to race?
>
> Trainer Ang: I was aware of that, Sir, but I was thinking of the welfare of
> the horse, Sir.

99\. In view of the aforesaid, the contention that Mr Ang did not admit that
he had breached Rule 200(5) of the MRA Rules of Racing is rejected.

__

Mr Angs plea of guilt is valid

__

100\. I hold that Mr Angs plea of guilt was unequivocal and that he understood
the nature and consequences of his plea.

**

D. WHETHER MR FISHER WAS BIASED?

**

101\. Finally, I turn to the allegation that Mr Fisher should not have chaired
the inquiry proceedings because he was biased against Mr Ang. It is trite law
that a person may be disqualified from hearing or determining a case or matter
because of actual or apparent bias. (See, for instance, the decision of the
Court of Appeal in _Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew & Anor _[1998] 1 SLR 97.)

102\. Mr Ang said that he had a bad relationship with Mr Fisher. For a start,
he contended that sometime around July 2000, Mr Fisher had accused him of
spreading rumours about his impending resignation from STC. Secondly, it was
alleged that Mr Fisher had on occasion voiced his unhappiness over the fact
that Mr Angs daughter, Ms Crystal Ang, rode to the starting gate without using
stirrups. Thirdly, Mr Ang pointed out that Ms Ang had on several occasions
received unnecessarily harsh sentences from the panel of stipendiary stewards
when Mr Fisher was presiding. Finally, Mr Ang submitted that the harsh
sentence received by him on 23 August 2000 showed that STC and its officials
were biased against him.

103\. Mr Ang failed to prove his assertion that Mr Fisher was biased against
him for a number of reasons. To begin with, in his letter of 22 August 2000 to
Mr Fisher, he stated as follows:

____

> I am ashamed of myself for letting you down despite __your leniency towards
> me in the past__.
>
> (emphasis added)

104\. When cross-examined, Mr Ang confirmed that he thought that Mr Fisher had
been lenient in the past. He said as follows:

> Q. Did you not state in your letter of 22 August 2000 that Mr Fisher had
> been lenient to you in the past?
>
> A. It appears that he was lenient in the past. To me, he was lenient.

105\. It is also worth noting that Mr Fisher did not submit Mr Angs letter of
22 August 2000 to him as evidence before the inquiry panel. As has already
been mentioned, Mr Ang said in this letter that he was totally wrong and that
he was guilty in every sense of the word. If Mr Fisher was indeed biased, he
would have placed the said letter before the inquiry panel as that would have
seriously prejudiced Mr Angs case.

106\. As for Mr Angs allegation that Mr Fisher had accused him of spreading
rumours, Mr Fisher said as follows in para 86 of his affidavit of evidence-in-
chief:

> The plaintiff has chosen to exaggerate an issue which I mentioned in passing
> to him during one of our conversations. I had been informed by a member of
> the defendants staff that the plaintiff had mentioned that I might be
> resigning. When I next spoke to the plaintiff, I asked him in passing
> whether he had said such a thing. The plaintiff expressed his surprise and
> said that he had not made such a statement. I left it at that. I was neither
> confrontational [nor] accusatory.

107\. When cross-examined and when questioned by me, Mr Angs answers confirmed
Mr Fishers position. His answers were as follows:

> Q. You said that Mr Fisher accused you of spreading rumours?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Q. All that Mr Fisher asked you was whether you told other people that he
> was resigning?
>
> A. He asked me if I told people and I said I did not and that was all.
>
> Ct. That ended the matter?
>
> A. Yes. He added that he was not resigning. He then walked away.

108\. As for the allegation that Mr Fisher was displeased with Mr Angs
daughter for riding to the starting gate without the use of stirrups, Mr
Fisher admitted that he told Ms Ang that riding without the use of stirrups at
the starting gate is bad form. However, he stressed that he was only trying to
educate Ms Ang as she was an apprentice jockey and it was STCs policy to
improve the image of horse racing. When cross-examined, Mr Ang conceded that
Mr Fisher was performing his duties as an official of STC whenever he
mentioned that Ms Ang should not ride to the starting gate without stirrups.

109\. As for Ms Angs allegation that she had received manifestly unfair or
unnecessary sentences from the panel of Stipendiary Stewards whenever Mr
Fisher was the chairman of the panel, Mr Fisher pointed out that Ms Angs
disciplinary record is "fairly average". He produced the disciplinary records
of Ms Ang and two other apprentice jockeys to prove his point. He also noted
that Ms Angs sentences had been upheld on appeal by the Racing Stewards.

110\. Ms Crystal Ang did not substantiate her allegation that Mr Fisher was
biased against her and her father. Although she tried to correct her position
during re-examination, her answers during cross-examination clearly showed
that she had no basis for alleging that Mr Fisher was biased. She said as
follows:

> Q. Did you think Mr Fisher was biased because you were suspended?
>
> A. Yes.
>
> Q. Is that the only reason why you think he was biased?
>
> A. Yes.

111\. Finally, Mr Angs complaint that the sentence imposed on him was unduly
harsh and manifestly excessive will be considered. In his statement of claim,
he asserted that the sentence which he received was clearly disproportionate
to the offences which he committed and this can only be explained on the basis
that there is evidence of bias on the part of STC or its representatives.
Although he further asserted in his statement of claim that there were
previous cases involving other race horse trainers who were merely fined for
offences with "similar facts", no credible evidence of such cases was produced
at the trial. In contrast, Mr Fisher pointed out that this was the first case
in which a trainer has been found guilty of personally administering a
prohibited substance to his horse. As for the possession of prohibited items,
Mr Fisher referred to another case where a trainer was also disqualified for
two years for having in his possession equipment for the nasogastric
administration of prohibited substances. In view of this, Mr Angs claim that
the sentence which he received showed that STC breached its duty to act in a
fair and reasonable manner in sentencing him cannot be countenanced.

112\. When cross-examined, Mr Ang acknowledged that he thought that Mr Fisher
was biased only because he was unhappy with the penalty meted out to him at
the inquiry of 23 August 2000. He said:

> Q. You say that he is biased?
>
> A. I know he is biased according to the penalty meted out to me.
>
> Q. Are you saying that he was biased just because of the penalty?
>
> A. Yes.

113\. I thus hold that Mr Ang failed to establish that Mr Fisher should not
have sat on the inquiry panel which heard his case on 23 August 2000.

E. CONCLUSION

**

114\. Although Mr Ang claimed that he was confused and that he did not know
what was happening at the inquiry hearing on 23 August 2000, he had no basis
for saying that he had told the inquiry panel and the police a pack of lies.
The evidence is that he had planned from the very start to admit his guilt and
had hoped that his sincerity in co-operating with the panel of Stipendiary
Stewards will result in the imposition of a fine and not a disqualification.
He was clearly startled when the Stipendiary Stewards decided to disqualify
him for a total of ten years. In the final analysis, after having pleaded
guilty to the charges faced by him, Mr Ang tried to obtain a re-hearing of his
case because the punishment imposed on him was more severe than what he had
expected.

115\. Mr Angs claim is dismissed with costs.
