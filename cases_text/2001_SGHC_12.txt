**JUDGMENT:**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. This is an action in which Wellform Construction Pte Ltd (Wellform
Construction) is the plaintiff. It claimed an account from the defendant Lay
Sing Construction Pte Ltd (Lay Sing).

2\. Lay Sing had taken over two building projects regarding Canossa Convent
School (9702) on the one hand, Canossaville Childrens Home and Magdelenes
Kindergarten (9901) on the other hand. They were referred to as Phase 1 and 2
respectively in the proceedings.

3\. The parties had a joint venture agreement in which both would manage and
do the work. Payment by the owner would be made first to Lay Sing and the net
profits were to be shared 30:70 as between Wellform Construction and Lay Sing
respectively.

4\. On 12 May 2000 an order was made by an Assistant Registrar in which
directions were given for the taking of accounts in order to determine what
amount, if any, was payable by Lay Sing to Wellform Construction. The order,
inter alia, directed that Lay Sing was to file an affidavit by 31 May 2000
exhibiting an auditors report as well as depose that full discovery of
relevant documents was made available to the auditors for their report.
Wellform Construction was to file an affidavit by 21 June 2000 deposing to the
profits and expenses in relation to the auditors report as well as exhibit a
list of queries.

5\. The report was done by Chio Lim & Associates (Chio Lim) but it turned out
during cross-examination that the report was only for Phase 1 and not for
Phase 2. Lay Sing should have ensured that it was for both phases but did not.
Indeed no satisfactory reason was given as to this unsatisfactory state of
affairs. It gave the impression that Lay Sing had not been candid with Chio
Lim and with the court.

6\. Chio Lims report dated 20 June 2000 showed that the net profit for Phase 1
was $158,397.68.

7\. On the other hand, Wellform Construction produced print-outs obtained from
Lay Sings computer which showed a set of accounts prepared by Lay Sing for
Phase 1 and for Phase 2. The print-outs were exhibited in its affidavit in
reply. There was no list of queries as such in this affidavit in reply.

8\. Mr David Ong, for Lay Sing, argued that Wellform Construction was not
entitled to object to the report by Chio Lim as it did not, in his affidavit
in reply, filed on 8 August 2000, state a list of queries on the report
although he informed me that a list of queries was filed on the day of the
hearing before the Assistant Registrar. I do not think this is a valid
argument.

9\. In the first place, the report by Chio Lim did not comply with the order
of court of 12 May 2000 in that it did not cover both phases as was intended.
As Lay Sing had failed to obtain a report which complied with the order,
Wellform Construction did not have to list out its queries as regards the
report.

10\. In any event, the purpose of the order of 12 May 2000 was for Wellform
Construction to indicate to Lay Sing, by the list of queries, what objection
it had to the report. In exhibiting the accounts prepared by Lay Sing for
Phase 1 and 2 and which, for Phase 1, were different from Chio Lims report,
Wellform Construction had made it clear to Lay Sing that it did not agree with
the report and preferred to rely on the accounts prepared by Lay Sing itself.

11\. As regards Phase 1, work thereon had been completed by 20 December 1998
and Lay Sings accounts for this phase were prepared in April 1999.

12\. The last page of the accounts prepared by Lay Sing for Phase 1 showed
that the profit was $1,394,629.66 as follows:

13\. There was no satisfactory explanation by Lay Sing or Chio Lim as to why,
for Phase 1, there was this huge difference between the profit figure from the
accounts prepared by Lay Sing on the one hand in April 1999 ($1,394,629.66)
and from the report prepared by Chio Lim in June 2000 ($158,397.68). Neither
Lay Sing or Chio Lim were asked by either counsel to elaborate on the
difference. It also appeared that Chio Lim may not have been aware of the
accounts prepared by Lay Sing for Phase 1.

14\. The only explanations given by Mr Sim Lay Sing for Lay Sing as regards
the accounts for Phase 1 prepared by Lay Sing was that:

> a. The accounts prepared by Lay Sing provided for an approximate payment to
> it of $1,132,650.86. However it actually received $868,883.18, ie. a
> reduction of $263,767.48.
>
> b. The profit element of $3,472,142.03 had excluded materials and
> preliminaries. The profit as reflected in such accounts was just an
> estimate.

15\. On 11 November 2000, the Assistant Registrar Ms Chong Chin Chin made the
following order:

> a. Phase 1
>
> That the accounts prepared by the Defendants were preliminary accounts and
> did not account for overhead costs.
>
> That there is no distinction between structural works and architectural work
> as alleged by the Defendants.
>
> That the Plaintiffs are not bound by the agreement entered into by the
> Defendants and Chon Hwa Construction Pte. Ltd.
>
> That the accounts prepared by Messrs. Chio Lim & Associates for Phase 1 of
> the works in issue are correct. The profits earned by the Defendants in
> Phase 1 is a sum of $158,397.68.
>
> b. Phase 2
>
> The profits earned by the Defendants in Phase 2 is a sum of $328,447.74.
>
> c. The Defendants Set-Off
>
> The Defendants are entitled to set off these items against the Plaintiffs
> claim:
>
> i. Set-off for the Ubi Project $41,729.00
>
> ii. Advance payments $159,708.74
>
> iii. Partial payment of profits $8,625.55
>
> d. The total sum due to the Plaintiffs
>
> The total sum due to the Plaintiffs from the Defendants, after the
> Defendants set-offs are accounted for, is a sum of $0.00.
>
> e. The costs of this action is to the Plaintiffs, to be agreed to or taxed.

16\. In doing So, Ms Chong, inter alia, adopted the profit figure for Phase 1
as stated in the report prepared by Chio Lim.

17\. Wellform Construction appealed against part of Ms Chongs order on two
grounds: (a) the Assistant Registrar was wrong to accept the profit figure for
Phase 1 as stated in the accounts prepared by Chio Lim and (b) the Assistant
Registrar should not have allowed a further deduction of $159,708.74 from the
sum to be paid by Lay Sing to Wellform Construction as that sum had already
been taken into account by Chio Lim.

18\. On the other hand, Lay Sing also appealed against part of Ms Chongs
order. In the appeal before me, Lay Sing confined its appeal to that part of
the order which did not allow a further deduction of $80,000 from the profit
figure for Phase 1, which $80,000 was allegedly paid by Lay Sing to another
company as part of an earlier joint venture agreement pertaining to Phase 1
and 2. This would have meant not only that no payment should be made by Lay
Sing to Wellform Construction but that Wellform Construction should make some
payment to Lay Sing.

19\. One of the arguments of Wellform Construction was that the report of Chio
Lim was not admissible as it was hearsay evidence even though Mr Y C Chee of
Chio Lim had given evidence. The argument of hearsay was that he had to rely
on work done by his staff and he had no personal knowledge about the documents
which he had to consider.

20\. I do not agree that the report was inadmissible. Mr Chee was the person
in charge of the report. He was entitled to rely on the work of his staff as
one cannot expect the person in charge to do everything himself. Also he did
not need to have personal knowledge of the documents which he considered. The
weight to be given to the report was another matter.

21\. After hearing arguments and considering the documents, I agree that the
Assistant Registrar should not have accepted the report of Chio Lim in place
of the accounts prepared by Lay Sing.

22\. The last page of the accounts for Phase 1 as prepared by Lay Sing has
been set out in paragraph 12 above. Although the fourth line from the bottom
of the accounts had the qualification that materials and preliminaries were
excluded, the next line, ie. the third line from the bottom, made a deduction
of $2,376,548.85. This figure was derived from another page of the accounts
prepared by Lay Sing which showed a break-down, by each month, of the costs
for Phase 1 with separate columns for materials/machinery, wages (workers),
staff salary and others. The second line from the bottom showed an add back
and the last line from the bottom showed a net profit of $1,394,629.66.

23\. It was therefore not accurate to look at the fourth line from the bottom
of the last page only and ignore the last three lines. Contrary to Mr Sims
assertion, Lay Sing had included cost of materials and preliminaries in this
set of accounts to arrive at the eventual net profit figure of $1,394,629.66.

24\. Mr Ong sought to argue that only some and not all the materials and
preliminaries had been included in this set of accounts but that was not the
evidence of Mr Sim, who gave the impression that all had been excluded.
Furthermore, no explanation was given as to why Lay Sing should include some
but exclude other expenses in its own attempt to determine the profit for
Phase 1.

25\. Secondly, Chio Lim had to draw certain conclusions which were not
necessarily correct. For example, there was apparently no invoice to
substantiate claims of and payments to NSCs (nominated sub-contractors) and
DSCs (direct sub-contractors) against Lay Sing amounting to a total of
$1,392,630.48.

26\. Mr Chee was aware of this but said they had verified the payments from
alternative sources such as certification of payment and claims.

27\. It was not clear from paragraphs 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 of the report as to who
had certified the payments to these sub-contractors, the architect or Lay Sing
itself.

28\. According to the notes of evidence, Mr Chee had said that for NSC claims,
the payments were always approved by the architect. Even if this were so, it
still left open the question about the claims by the DSCs.

29\. If payments to the DSCs had indeed been made as claimed by Lay Sing, then
there should be some other means of verifying the same such as by the cheque
numbers, if cheques were used, or by bank statements of Lay Sing.

30\. Further or alternatively, verification could and should have been
obtained from the DSCs. This was not done.

31\. During cross-examination at NE 22 line 23, Mr Sim said he would produce
evidence to substantiate the payments to the NSCs and DSCs but no evidence was
produced thereafter by him.

32\. Another example of a conclusion drawn by Chio Lim which may not be
correct is their treatment of certain payments in 1999 by Lay Sing to Wellform
Construction. According to Mr Shahiran, acting for Wellform Construction,
these payments totalled $159,708.74 but, including GST, they actually totalled
$164,500. Chio Lim had treated the payments as part of expenses of Phase 1 but
gave no reason why they did so.

33\. According to Mr Sims second affidavit of 24 February 2000, paragraph
11.2, for Lay Sing, these payments were various advance payments to Wellform
Construction by way of a loan.

34\. According to Mr Johnny Thngs second affidavit of 14 April 2000, paragraph
10, for Wellform Construction, these payments were part of payments made to
Wellform Construction for the purchase of raw materials to be used for our
joint venture in the Canossa Convent Project and they were therefore advance
payments towards the joint-venture profit and progress payments towards this
amount.

35\. Phase 1 had already been completed by 20 December 1998. I did not see how
payments in 1999 could be for payments of raw materials to be used for Phase 1
as contended by Mr Thng. Besides Mr Thngs affidavit was contradictory on this
point. On the one hand, he gave the impression that the payments were used to
pay for expenses but yet on the other hand, the second part of his paragraph
10 said, they were therefore advance payments towards the joint venture profit
. The two were inconsistent.

36\. Thirdly, Mr Sim himself admitted during cross-examination at NE 21 line
10 to 17 that the accounts for Phase 1 prepared by Lay Sing were correct.

37\. I therefore conclude that based on those accounts, the profit for Phase 1
was $1,394,629.66 subject to the qualification that since Lay Sing received a
payment of $868,883.18 instead of the anticipated payment of $1,132,650.66,
the profit should be reduced by the difference of $263,767.48 ie. it would
then become $1,130,862.18 as follows:

> (a) Profit (including anticipated payment) | $1,394,679.66  
> ---|---  
> (b) Less $263,767.48 (being the difference between an anticipated and the actual payment) | $263,767.48  
> | ____________  
> | $1,130,862.18  
> | ____________  
  
38\. The profit for Phase 2 is agreed by the parties at $328,447.74. This is
based also on a set of accounts prepared by Lay Sing.

39\. The total profit for Phases 1 and 2 is therefore $1,459,309.92.

40\. I now come to the second part of Wellform Constructions appeal.

41\. Mr Shahiran argued that as the Assistant Registrar had accepted the set
of accounts in the report by Chio Lim, then there was no need to deduct the
payments totaling $159,708.74 to Wellform Construction from the profit derived
by Chio Lim as the $159,708.74 had already been taken into account by Chio Lim
in deriving the profit of $158,397.08. Mr Ong agreed provided the profit
figure as determined by Chio Lim was accepted by me and subject to Lay Sings
appeal that $80,000 should be deducted from the profit figure.

42\. However, for Phase 1, I did not accept the profit figure from the report
by Chio Lim but from the accounts prepared by Lay Sing.

43\. Mr Shahirans alternative argument regarding the $159,708.74 was that this
figure should be deducted as expenses from the profit for Phase 1 first
instead of deducting it from Wellform Constructions share of the profit as it
was part of expenses.

44\. I do not agree with this argument. The $159,708.74 was paid to Wellform
Construction after Phase 1 had been completed. It was not paid as part of
expenses for Phase 1 but to account of Wellform Constructions share of the
profit for Phase 1, as was mentioned in the second part of paragraph 10 of Mr
Thngs second affidavit (see para 35 above).

45\. Accordingly, the deduction should be from Wellform Constructions share of
the profit for Phase 1 as determined by Lay Sing. The sum to be deducted is
$164,500 as this was the total sum received by Wellform Construction from the
payments. As I have mentioned in paragraph 32 above, the figure of $159,708.74
given by Mr Shahiran excluded the GST which was received by Wellform
Construction. This deduction is in addition to two other sums to be deducted,
which deductions were not disputed.

46\. Therefore, subject to Lay Sings appeal, the balance payable to Wellform
Construction would be:

> Total profits from Phase 1 and 2 (see paras 37 to 39 above) | $1,459,309.92  
> ---|---  
> 30% thereof | $437,792.98  
> _Less:_ |   
> (a) Advance payments to Wellform Construction | $164,500.00 -  
> (b) Set-off for Ubi Project (undisputed) | $41,729.00 -  
> (c) Partial payment of profits (undisputed) | $8,625.55 -  
> | ___________  
> | $222,938.43  
> | ___________  
  
47\. I now come to Lay Sings appeal against part of Ms Chongs order which was
argued before me. It was the part which did not take into account a sum of
$80,000 allegedly paid by Lay Sing to another company, Chon Hwa Construction
Pte Ltd (Chon Hwa) pursuant to an alleged agreement between Lay Sing and Chon
Hwa dated 21 June 1997 in which Lay Sing purportedly agreed with Chon Hwa to
set up a joint venture to carry out works pertaining to the upgrading of
Canossa Convent Primary School and the relocation of Canossian School for the
Hearing Impaired to the premises of Canossian Convent and the upgrading of
Canossa Convent.

48\. Under that agreement, Lay Sing purportedly agreed with Chon Hwa that Chon
Hwa should retain 1% of the Building Contract for the works.

49\. The Building Contract is not defined although Lay Sings position appeared
to be that it pertains to both Phase 1 and 2.

50\. Lay Sing alleged that it had subsequently by a sub-contract agreement
dated 29 January 2000, agreed to let Chon Hwa have $80,000 as its share of the
profit from Phase 1 and 2 and that this sum should be deducted from the
profits to be shared with Wellform Construction.

51\. That sub-contract agreement states:

> **_SUB-CONTRACT AGREEMENT_**

52\. I do not see how that letter could substantiate the alleged payment of
$80,000 by Lay Sing to Chon Hwa. It dealt with a different project at No 4
Lorong M Telok Kurau and the figure of $80,000 had nothing to do with the
value of Chon Hwas contract for that project which value was $4,510,000.

53\. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the intended joint venture
between Lay Sing and Chon Hwa for Phase 1 and 2 had been carried out. Indeed,
the evidence was to the contrary as Lay Sing eventually ended up with Wellform
Construction to carry out the works for Phase 1 and 2. There was no reason why
Lay Sing should let Chon Hwa have $80,000 for Phase 1 and 2 or why Wellform
Construction should be affected by this.

54\. It is quite clear to me that the sub-contract agreement dated 29 January
2000 is but a desperate attempt by Lay Sing to try and reduce the profits of
Phase 1 and 2 so as to reduce the payment it has to make to Wellform
Construction.

55\. Accordingly, I am of the view that there is no need to reduce the profit
figure of Phase 1 and 2 by $80,000 and Lay Sings appeal is dismissed.

56\. In the circumstances, the appeal of Wellform Construction is allowed in
that Ms Chongs order of 11 November 2000 is set aside and Lay Sing is to pay
Wellform Construction $222,938.43 with interest at 6% per annum from the date
of Writ of Summons until the day before my judgment as statutory interest runs
from the date of judgment. Costs of the action up to the hearing before Ms
Chong is to be paid by Lay Sing to Wellform Construction to be agreed or
taxed.

57\. I would also mention that should Lay Sing recover more monies from the
owner regarding the difference between $1,132,650.66 which it anticipated
receiving and the $868,883.18 which it received, then, 30% of the net monies
recovered should be paid by Lay Sing to Wellform Construction.

58\. I will hear the parties on costs of the appeal before me.
