Criminal Procedure

**– Appeal - Appellate court not to disturb findings of fact unless reached
against the weight of evidence _**

Facts

**The appellant’s flat was raided by the Central Narcotics Bureau and 58.83
grams of diamorphine was recovered along with various drug-trafficking
paraphernalia. The appellant’s control of the flat at all material times was
not in issue. The presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs
Act was triggered and the appellant was duly charged with possession of a
controlled drug for the purposes of trafficking.

At trial, the appellant raised the defence of consumption, claiming that he
was a severe heroin addict and all the heroin recovered was intended for his
own personal consumption. Moreover, he had sufficient funds to support his
habit such that he did not need to resort to drug-trafficking. The judicial
commissioner rejected the defence, disbelieving the appellant’s
unsubstantiated claims as to the degree of his addiction and preferring the
prosecution’s evidence that the appellant was only a moderate addict. The
judicial commissioner also relied on the appellant’s long statement to the
police, in which he confessed to be a drug trafficker, and on the drug-
trafficking paraphernalia found in the flat. The appellant was sentenced to
death and appealed against his conviction.

**

Held

**, dismissing the appeal:

  1. An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact made by a trial judge unless they are clearly reached against the weight of evidence – _Lim Ah Poh v PP_ , _PP v Hla Win_(see ¶15).
  2. The judicial commissioner’s finding that the appellant was only a moderate heroin addict could not be faulted. It followed from this finding that the defence of consumption failed as the amount of diamorphine recovered from the appellant’s flat amounted to a seven-month supply of heroin for a moderate addict. Furthermore, even if it was believed that the appellant was indeed a severe heroin addict, his 

claims as to the amount he consumed could not be accepted as it far exceeded
the upper limit of a severe addict’s rate of intake. (see ¶13-14).

  3. Drug-trafficking paraphernalia is relevant in establishing whether a person is a drug trafficker – _Low Kok Wai v PP_. The judicial commissioner’s findings in this regard were clearly correct as the appellant’s explanations for the presence of the drug-trafficking paraphernalia were extremely far-fetched (see ¶17).
  4. It is clear that an accused person can be convicted solely on his own retracted confession if the court is satisfied of its truth. Here, even if the appellant’s grounds of appeals were of merit, the length and detail of his long statement were such as to warrant the dismissal of the appeal (see ¶18).

**Grounds of Judgment:**

_Delivered by Yong Pung How_

The appellant was tried in the High Court before Choo Han Teck JC on a charge
of drug trafficking pursuant to s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of
Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the "MDA"). The judicial commissioner convicted the
appellant of the charge and sentenced him to death by hanging. We dismissed
the appeal against the conviction and now give our reasons.

**The facts**

2 On 27 November 2000 at about 9.15pm, officers from the Central Narcotics
Bureau ("CNB") raided the appellant's flat at Block 331, Woodlands Avenue 1,
#04-421. Upon gaining entry, the appellant was spotted dashing into the
toilet, from where he was forcibly removed by the CNB officers and arrested. A
quantity of yellowish granular substance (the "substance") was recovered from
the drainage hole of the said toilet. Apart from the substance, other items
seized from the appellant and from various places in the appellant's flat
included:-

> (a) Various substances, tablets and powders, including 60 tablets of Erimin
> 5, one sachet of heroin and one straw of heroin;
>
> (b) One pager;
>
> (c) Three handphones;
>
> (d) One electronic weighing scale;
>
> (e) One sealer;
>
> (f) Numerous empty plastic sachets and bags, including "Ziplock" bags;
>
> (g) One drug supervisee card; and
>
> (h) Six uncensored video compact discs ("VCDs").

The appellant's control of the flat at all material times was not in issue.

3 Analysis by Dr Saw Chwee Guan of the Department of Scientific Services
showed that the 687.3 grams of dried substance contained not less than 58.83
grams of diamorphine.

**The prosecution's case**

4 The prosecution placed reliance on the appellant's long statement, made
pursuant to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) (the "CPC"), in
which the appellant admitted to drug trafficking by assisting one "Ah Chong"
in delivering heroin to Ah Chong's purchasers. The appellant also trafficked
in heroin by purchasing heroin from Ah Chong for purpose of resale to his
fellow addicts. The electronic scale was used to pack heroin for resale. The
appellant's clients would use the pager to contact him, while Ah Chong would
contact the appellant using one of the handphones. On the day of his arrest,
the appellant had collected three bags of heroin from Ah Chong's hireling, one
bag of which he delivered. The appellant was holding on to the other two bags,
pending further instructions from Ah Chong, when the CNB raided his flat.
These two bags of heroin together constituted the substance recovered from the
drainage hole.

5 The prosecution also pointed out that the appellant's cautioned statement,
made pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC, disclosed no defence to the charge of
trafficking. Instead, the appellant had simply pleaded for leniency as he had
an aged mother who had no one to look after her.

6 Finally, the prosecution placed reliance on the evidence of Dr Choo Shiao
Hoe ("Dr Choo"), who had treated the appellant for drug withdrawal at Changi
Prison Hospital. Dr Choo had testified that based on the withdrawal symptoms
exhibited by the appellant upon admission to Changi Prison Hospital, the
appellant was a moderate drug addict. A moderate drug addict would consume
between 0.1 gram to 0.27 gram of diamorphine a day, while a severe addict
would consume between 0.28 gram to 0.67 gram of diamorphine a day. However, it
would not be necessary for an addict to consume such an amount on a daily
basis because the 'high' from one session of drug-taking would last the addict
a day or two.

**The defence**

7 The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He attempted to rebut the
incriminating portions of his long statement by alleging that he had either
been "not sober" during the recording sessions, or that he had not appreciated
the ramifications of what he had said until it was read out at the trial. The
appellant also claimed that he had not mentioned the consumption defence in
his s 122(6) statement as he was feeling cold and in a hurry to get the
recording of it over with.

8 Instead, the appellant based his defence on two claims. The first claim was
that all the substance seized was intended for his own consumption as he was a
severe heroin addict who consumed approximately 20 grams of impure substance a
day. Moreover, he liked to buy his heroin in big bags, sufficient for one to
two months' use, as he had absconded from drug supervision and feared arrest.
Second, the appellant claimed that despite his having told the CNB that he
made approximately $800 to $1200 a month as a security guard, he had not
disclosed the additional income that he derived from the sale of VCDs. As
such, although he had not worked between 30 June 2000 and his arrest on 27
November 2000, he had amassed $30,000 in savings with which he supported his
drug habit, and did not need to resort to drug trafficking.

**The decision below**

9 The judicial commissioner rejected the appellant's defence for the following
reasons:-

> (a) The appellant was admittedly a heroin addict, but had failed to show
> that the heroin was for his own consumption. The judicial commissioner was
> dissatisfied by his explanations for the presence of the drug trafficking
> paraphernalia, finding that they were indicative of a large-scale
> trafficking activity. He also disbelieved the appellant's claim to be such a
> severe addict that he required all the heroin for himself.
>
> (b) The defence of consumption was not an elaborate legal defence and he
> would have expected it to be raised in the s 122(6) statement but it was
> not.
>
> (c) In the light of the length and detail of the long statement, the
> judicial commissioner could not accept that the appellant did not intend to
> make it, or was unaware that he was incriminating himself.
>
> (d) The appellant's financial means were not an issue as he could have
> derived his money from drug trafficking.

10 The judicial commissioner hence convicted the appellant on the charge. As
the amount of diamorphine seized was in excess of 15 grams, the appellant was
sentenced to death pursuant to s 33 and the Second Schedule of the MDA.

**The appeal**

11 The appeal to this court rested on two contentions:-

> (a) that the judicial commissioner should not have rejected the consumption
> defence as raised by the appellant; and
>
> (b) that the judicial commissioner should not have rejected the appellant's
> explanation for the presence of the drug trafficking paraphernalia found in
> the appellant's flat.

**The defence of consumption**

12 The appellant claimed in his written submissions that, contrary to the
findings of fact made by the judicial commissioner, there was "ample evidence"
to support the defence of consumption. We took the view that this contention
could not be supported. The defence of consumption, as raised by the
appellant, rested on a single unsubstantiated claim: that he was a severe
heroin addict who consumed approximately 20 grams of impure substance a day,
such that 687.3 grams accounted for a 34-day supply. However, the appellant
was unable to provide any evidence to show that he was indeed a severe heroin
addict. The medical reports cited by the appellant in his written submissions
could not help him, as they stated that the appellant was at worst only a mild
addict, while the prosecution was willing to accept that he was a moderate
addict.

13 On the other hand, the prosecution was able to adduce expert evidence, in
the form of Dr Choo's testimony, as to the degree of the appellant's
addiction, which was unchallenged by the appellant at the appeal. Based on Dr
Choo's assessment, this would leave the appellant with approximately 217 days'
worth of heroin, a supply that could conceivably have lasted the appellant for
over a year. Even allowing for the appellant's unsubstantiated claim that he
bought his heroin in amounts sufficient for one to two months' use, this could
not explain the extremely large amount of heroin seized from the appellant.

14 The figures provided by Dr Choo on the rate of consumption of a severe
heroin addict also meant that even if we accepted that the appellant was a
severe addict, we could nevertheless not accept his claim of consuming 20
grams of impure substance a day. As was pointed out by the prosecution in the
trial below, the purity of the seized heroin meant that 20 grams of substance
would yield approximately 1.71 grams of diamorphine, a figure which is over
two-and-a-half times the upper limit of a severe addict's rate of consumption.

15 It is clear from cases such as Lim Ah Poh v PP [1992] 1 SLR 713 and PP v
Hla Win [1995] 2 SLR 424 that an appellate court will not disturb findings of
fact made by a trial judge unless they are clearly reached against the weight
of evidence. In light of the foregoing, we took the view that the judicial
commissioner had been entirely correct to reject the consumption defence.

**The drug-trafficking paraphernalia**

16 Drug-trafficking paraphernalia is relevant in establishing whether a person
is a drug trafficker or not - Low Kok Wai v PP [1994] 1 SLR 676. Moreover, it
was stated in Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP [1996] 3 SLR 29 that "the more
directly the item is connected to drug trafficking, the more weighty evidence
of possession by the accused of that item is in suggesting that the drugs
found in his possession were for the purpose of trafficking."

17 The items seized from the appellant's flat indubitably constituted drug-
trafficking paraphernalia. The appellant never disputed that the items
belonged to him, but instead tried to offer alternative explanations for their
presence in his home. For example, the appellant had claimed at the trial
below that he had bought the electronic scale from an unidentified old man in
Sungei Road because he felt sorry for him. As in the case of the consumption
defence, we saw no reason to overturn the judicial commissioner's decision in
relation to the drug-trafficking paraphernalia. We were of the view that the
appellant's explanations were extremely far-fetched. If he was to be believed,
it would have been remarkably coincidental that he should have randomly
assembled a collection of items which just so happened, when taken together,
to constitute paraphernalia commonly used by drug traffickers. We also noted
that these claims were all in strict contradiction to the appellant's long
statement, where he stated that the paraphernalia in question were used for
drug trafficking, and which the judicial commissioner had accepted as true.

**Other issues**

18 We noted in passing that the judicial commissioner's refusal to accept the
appellant's explanations for the incriminating nature of his long statement
was not challenged before us. Mohamed Bachu Miah v PP [1993] 1 SLR 249
establishes that an accused person may be convicted on his own confession even
when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth. The contents of
the long statement were sufficient to warrant the dismissal of the appeal.

**Conclusion**

19 For the reasons stated above, we found that a case of trafficking in 58.83
grams of diamorphine had been properly made out against the appellant, and
dismissed the appeal.
