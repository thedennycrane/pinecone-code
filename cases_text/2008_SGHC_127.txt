Choo Han Teck J:

1 The applicant filed this criminal motion for an order that the proceedings
before District Judge Thian Yee Sze (“DJ Thian”) be adjourned till 18 August
2008 so that the applicant may “instruct counsel Joseph Chen of Joseph Chen &
Co” to represent him in the proceedings. The proceedings in question involved
two charges PS 718 of 2006 and PS 721 of 2006 in which the applicant was on
trial together with Yap Keng Ho. The trial commenced on 14 July 2008 and was
scheduled to continue to 8 August 2008.

2 On the first day of trial Mr Chia Ti Lik, counsel for the applicant applied
for leave to discharge himself as counsel for the applicant. Leave was granted
to him on 15 July 2008 and the proceedings were adjourned to 18 July 2008 for
the applicant to instruct new counsel. Mr Joseph Chen appeared on 18 July 2008
and asked if the trial could be adjourned to 18 August 2008 because he was
unable to proceed until then. His application was rejected by the trial judge.
Mr Chen then applied to discharge himself as counsel. This was granted and the
trial proceeded with the applicant acting in-person.

3 The applicant then filed this application on 23 July 2008 for the same
prayer made by Mr Chen before DJ Thian on 18 July 2008, namely that the trial
before DJ Thian be adjourned to 18 August 2008. This application was similar
to the one filed by the applicant in Criminal Motion No 30 of 2006 (see: _Chee
Soon Juan v Public Prosecutor_ [2006] SGHC 202) which was an application made
shortly after that of his co-accused Mr Yap in Criminal Motion No 29 of 2006
(see: _Yap Keng Ho_ _v Public Prosecutor_ [2007] 1 SLR 259). The judge
conducting any legal proceedings decides how those proceedings are to be
conducted. There are rules of procedure and standards of practice that help
the court administer justice fairly and consistently. How she applies those
rules is a matter strictly within her discretion. All applications regarding
the conduct of those proceedings must be made to the judge having conduct of
the case. Counsel before her may try and persuade her to one view or the
other, but no one, not even a superior court, can tell her how to conduct
those proceedings and how she should exercise her discretion. If any party is
aggrieved by the final verdict of the court, he will have such recourse as the
law relating to appeals permits. This is an important aspect of the
independence of the judiciary. The applicant was fortunate that the trial
judge gave him time to appear before me on this application although she was
entitled to order that the trial would continue.

4 I need not reiterate all that I had said in the two cases referred to except
to say that the applicant had either forgotten the judgments in the two cases
cited above, or had chosen to ignore them. I shall therefore remind him that
an application to overturn a decision of a court when the proceedings have not
concluded amounts to an abuse of the process of court. So far as the applicant
is concerned, this Court will not hear any further applications of this
nature.

5 For the reasons above, the application was dismissed.
