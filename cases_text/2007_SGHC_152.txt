1 The plaintiff (“wife”) and defendant (“husband”) were married in 1996. The
present marriage is the husband’s second; he divorced his first wife in 1995.
The husband comes from a well to do family and is nine years older than the
wife. After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of
Washington, he became involved in the development of family-owned properties.
He derives his income from managing those properties. The wife is a housewife.
After obtaining her A-levels she worked as a foreign exchange trader, a
karaoke disc jockey and an administration manager in a construction company.
They had lived together from July 1995 and were married in February 1996. They
have two daughters who were born in March 1996 and January 1998. In 2003 the
wife discovered that the husband was having an affair with the party cited who
was her best friend and confidante. This led to the breakdown of the marriage
and on 9 May 2003, the husband filed Divorce Petition No 601568 of 2003 on the
ground of the wife’s unreasonable behaviour. This was followed by the wife’s
own application in Divorce Petition No 601758 of 2003 on the grounds of the
husband’s unreasonable behaviour in respect of the party cited. On 13 August
2003, the wife filed a supplemental petition on the grounds of the husband’s
adultery with the party cited. On 12 April 2004 a decree nisi was granted on
the wife’s supplemental petition and the ancillary matters were adjourned to
chambers.

2 In this originating summons the plaintiff prayed that:

(a) The whole of the proceedings commenced in the Subordinate Courts in
Divorce Petition No 601758 of 2003 between ET as the petitioner, ES as the
respondent and B as the party cited be transferred to the High Court and heard
as a High Court matter.

(b) The whole of the proceedings commenced in the Subordinate Courts in the
following matters be transferred to the High Court:

(i) Divorce Petition No 601568 of 2003 between ET as the petitioner and ET as
the respondent.

(ii) Originating Summons No 650070 of 2003 between ET as the plaintiff and ES
as the defendant.

(iii) Originating Summons No 15 of 2004 between ES as the plaintiff and ET as
the defendant.

(iv) Summons SS 1212 of 2003 between ET as the complainant and ES as the
respondent.

(v) Summons SS 1050 of 2003 between ES as the complainant and ET as the
respondent.

(c) The costs of this originating summons be in the cause of the matters duly
transferred to the High Court.

3 On 25 July 2006, I granted an order in terms of these three prayers and gave
directions for filing of affidavits for the hearing of the ancillaries.
Thereafter submissions were made over six days on the issues of custody and
access, maintenance and division of matrimonial assets.

4 On 24 April 2007, I made the following orders:

_Custody, care and control, access_

1 The wife and the husband shall have joint custody of the two children of the
marriage, C and D (each referred to as “child”, both referred to together as
“children”).

2 The wife shall have sole care and control of the children in that the wife
shall have sole decision-making power in respect of the day-to-day care of the
children and all matters affecting the welfare and interests of the children,
save for the following matters:

(ii) choice of school and tertiary institution;

(iii) treatments in respect of major and critical illnesses (other than
emergencies); and

(iv) elective surgery including dental braces.

3 Where the wife is required to consult the husband in any of the matters
enumerated in paragraph 2 above, she shall do so by way of registered mail to
YY Draycott Park, or such other address as the husband shall notify the wife
by registered mail. The husband shall likewise reply by registered mail.
Unless it is not possible for her to do so, the wife shall give in respect of
such matters. If the parties are unable to reach a joint decision, the wife’s
decision shall prevail until such time as the husband can obtain an order of
court.

4 Save and except that the parties have agreed to change the husband’s weekday

8 The following assets shall be retained by or transferred to the wife as part
of the wife’s share:

|  **Value (S$)**  
---|---  
XX Draycott Park (matrimonial home) |  2,600,000  
Wife’s UOB account |  29,160.25  
Wife’s CDP shares |  18,500  
NTUC policy |  9,042.14  
AIA policy |  3,750  
Prulink Asian Reach Managed Fund |  24,700  
Wife’s “overspending” to be accounted for |  189,000  
Jewellery |  To be assessed  
  
9 The husband shall pay the wife the remainder of the wife’s share in cash.

10 The husband shall pay all rental proceeds in respect of XX Draycott Park to
the wife with effect from 1 May 2007.

_Maintenance_

11 The husband shall pay the wife a lump sum maintenance of S$1,000,000.00.

12 The husband shall pay the sum of $2,500.00 per month for the monthly

the total monthly maintenance of $5,000.00 for both children directly into the
wife’s UOB account by the 7th of each calendar month.

_Costs_

13 The husband shall pay the wife costs to be taxed if not agreed.

5 On 22 May 2007 the wife filed Civil Appeal No 55 of 2007, to appeal against
the following orders:

(a) The wife shall be entitled to a global division of 35% of the value of the
matrimonial assets as set out in the schedule of matrimonial assets annexed
hereto as her share of the matrimonial assets.

(b) The wife’s Prulink Asian Reach Managed Fund is a matrimonial asset.

(c) The husband shall pay the wife a lump sum maintenance of $1,000,000.

(d) The husband shall pay the sum of $2,500 per month for the maintenance of
each child of the marriage with effect from 1 May 2007.

6 On 23 May 2007 the husband filed Civil Appeal No 58 of 2007 appealing
against the following orders:

(a) Order 3, in particular the part of the Order stating, “If the parties are
unable to reach a joint decision, the wife’s decision shall prevail until such
time as the husband can obtain an order of court.”

(b) Orders 6 and 10 on the division of matrimonial assets.

(c) Order 11 on the lump sum maintenance awarded to the wife.

(d) Order 13 on the issue of costs.

7 I now give the grounds for my decision in respect of the orders appealed
against. The issues in the two appeals may be consolidated into the following
issues:

(a) order on custody, care and control, access;

(b) determination of matrimonial assets;

(c) division of matrimonial assets;

(d) maintenance; and

(e) costs order.

Order on custody, care and control, access

8 I had granted joint custody of the two children to the wife and husband with
the wife having sole care and control. I had ordered that the wife was to have
sole decision-making power in the day-to-day care of the children except in
respect of major decisions, namely: (i) choice of religion; (ii) choice of
school and tertiary institutions; (iii) treatments for major and critical
illnesses (other than emergencies); and (iv) elective surgery (including
dental braces). In relation to these four matters, the wife was required to
consult the husband and the period of notice and mode of communication were
set out in the order. The reason for so doing was in order to minimise the
sources of potential conflict so that the parties can then devote their
energies more productively to the welfare – mental as well as physical – of
their children. The circumstances of this case – where the husband is living
with the wife’s former best friend – is particularly ripe for continuing
conflict and this can only be to the detriment of the children.

9 However I considered that it was necessary, in the event that the parties
cannot agree on a particular matter, to vest one party with the responsibility
of making the decision, with the other party’s recourse being an application
to court. Otherwise there will be no end of applications to court and,
crucially, important decisions, which may be urgent, cannot be made in time.
Since the children are living with the wife, it is only logical that she be
the person vested with this responsibility. Hence Order 3 was made, which the
husband is now appealing against.

Determination of matrimonial assets

10 Matrimonial asset is defined in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
1997 Rev Ed) in the following manner:

In this section, “matrimonial asset” means —

(a) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the
marriage —

(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their
children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation
or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or

(ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other
party or by both parties to the marriage; and

(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or
both parties to the marriage,

but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been
acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been
substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both
parties to the marriage.

11 The issue was raised as to whether income received during the marriage from
assets that are not matrimonial assets constitute matrimonial assets. During
the marriage, rent and dividends were received from real property and shares
that were acquired by the husband before the marriage and which were not
matrimonial assets by way of limb (a) of s 112(10)(a) of the Women’s Charter.
Counsel for the husband cited three cases in support of her contention that
such income were not matrimonial assets: (i)  _Yow Mee Lan v Chan Kai Buan_
[2000] 4 SLR 466 (“Yow Mee Lan’s case”), (ii)  _Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee Guan_
[2006] 4 SLR 605 (“Chen Siew Hwee’s case”); and (iii)  _Chan Mei Lan Kristine
v Ong Boon Huat Samuel_ [2006] SGHC 108 (“Chan Mei Lan’s case”). The first two
cases are totally irrelevant. In _Yow Mee Lan’s_ case, the properties in
question from which the income were derived were matrimonial property. _Chen
Siew Hwee’s_ case did not concern income generated from a non-matrimonial
asset but dealt with the situation where a gift was transformed into an asset
of another nature. The third case is of some relevance. _Chan Mei Lan’s_ case
concerned a divorce in which two apartments came up for consideration. The
first apartment was the matrimonial home and there was no dispute that it was
a matrimonial asset. The second apartment (“Malvern Springs”) was an
investment property acquired during the marriage by the husband and for which
he had paid all expenses and mortgage instalments. Andrew Phang J (as he then
was) held that, as this was acquired during the marriage, it fell within the
definition of “matrimonial asset” under limb (b) of s 112(10) of the Women’s
Charter. Citing the Court of Appeal in _Chan Teck Hock v Leong Mei Chuan_
[2002] 1 SLR 177, Phang J said that s 112(10)(b) was “ _not only clear but
also extensive in nature_ ” and that, the proviso being inapplicable, Malvern
Springs was matrimonial property.

12 Although the Court of Appeal subsequently reversed Phang J on the finding
that the second apartment should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets
to be divided, this was not on the ground that it did not fall within the
definition. Instead the appellate court considered that, in the circumstances
of the case they would exercise their discretion not to distribute Malvern
Springs, stating at [25, 26] of their judgment in _Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan
Mei Lan Kristine_ [2007] 2 SLR 729:

25 In the light of all the circumstances, we see no reason why Malvern Springs
should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided between the
parties. While it may be that Malvern Springs was acquired during the
marriage, and therefore technically falls under the definition of a
matrimonial asset contained in s 112(10) of the Act, we must emphasise that
the court’s power to divide any matrimonial asset is a discretionary power.
This is obvious from ss 112(1) and 112(2) of the Act, which provide:

(1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a
judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the
division between the parties of _any matrimonial asset_ or the sale of any
such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of
any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.

(2) It shall be the duty of the court _in deciding whether to_ _exercise its
powers under subsection (1)_ and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all
the circumstances of the case …[emphasis added]

26 Thus, it is not mandatory for the court to exercise its powers of division
under s 112 and the court may generally decline to do so where a valid reason
is given: _Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang_ [1993] 2 SLR 192 at 200, [31].
For the reasons given above, the present case is one in which there is good
reason for the court not to divide Malvern Springs.

13 As counsel were unable to produce any authority directly on point, it fell
upon me to determine this issue as a matter of statutory interpretation.
Firstly, s 112(10)(b) brings within the scope of matrimonial asset “**any …
asset of any nature acquired during the marriage** ” [emphasis added] by any
of the parties. I respectfully agree with Phang J in _Chan Mei Lan’s_ case
that this provision is extensive in nature. These wide words are only
circumscribed by the proviso which excludes “**any asset (not being a
matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or
inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage
by the other party or by both parties to the marriage** ”[emphasis added]. The
plain interpretation of the proviso would mean that an asset (of any nature)
acquired during the marriage is a matrimonial asset unless it is a gift or
inheritance that had not been substantially improved on during the marriage by
either party. Since the income from rent or dividend is an asset received
during the marriage, it falls within the definition of matrimonial asset. With
this determination on the point of law, counsel made their submissions on each
asset based on the evidence disclosed in the affidavits and documents
exhibited therewith.

14 After consideration of the submissions, I made a determination as to which
of the assets fell within the definition of matrimonial assets in s 112(10) of
the Women’s Charter. Those assets are as listed in Schedule A of the order of
24 April 2007, which is reproduced below:

|  **Asset** |  **Value (S$)** |  **Value Date**  
---|---|---|---  
1 |  XX Draycott Park (matrimonial home) |  2,600,000.00 |  24 Aug 06  
2 |  YY Draycott Park |  1,300,000.00 |  24 Aug 06  
3 |  Husband’s UOB Account |  (6,482.15) |  31 Jul 06  
4 |  New Bank Account |  42,236.88 |  31 Jul 06  
5 |  Merill Lynch Account |  147,120.00 |  30 Jul 06  
6 |  Coutts Account |  2,955,013 |  31 Jul 06  
7 |  Coutts Loan for YY Draycott Park |  (420,000) |  31 Jul 06  
8 |  Wife’s UOB Account |  29,160.25 |  31 Jul 06  
9 |  Husband’s CDP shares |  174,849.10 |  30 Jun 06  
10 |  Wife’s CDP shares |  18,500 |  31 Jul 06  
11 |  Husband’s CPF |  315,382.93 |  31 Jul 06  
12 |  Husband’s CPF shares |  46,410 |  31 Jul 06  
13 |  DBS Upswing fund |  18,276.60 |  31 Jul 06  
14 |  AIA policy |  6,903.45 |  31 Aug 06  
15 |  NTUC (Life assured: D) |  9,042.14 |  31 Aug 06  
16 |  AIA policy (Life assured: C) |  3,750.00 |  13 Jun 03  
17 |  Prulink Asian Reach Managed Fund |  24,700.00 |  Jul 06  
18 |  OUB Manulife Financial Account |  126,309.00 |  24 Aug 06  
19 |  Audi A8 |  109,190.00 |  31 Jul 06  
20 |  Wife’s “overspending” to be accounted for |  189,000.00 |  Court assessed  
21 |  TTT shares |  2,327,444.21 |  1 Jul 04  
22 |  Loan to Husband’s sister |  23,000.00 |  Court assessed  
23 |  Jewellery bought by the Wife during the  
marriage (“**Jewellery** ”) |  To be assessed |   
|  **Total:** |  10,039,805.41+ Jewellery |   
  
15 In relation to items 20 and 22, I had determined that the wife was not
entitled to spend these sums of money, and that these sums should constitute
part of the matrimonial assets for which she would be held to account. As for
item 23, the value of the jewellery was not available at the time and I had,
in Order 7, ordered that they be valued by an appraiser and that such value be
added to the total value of the matrimonial assets for division.

16 The total value of the matrimonial assets is $10,039,805.41, not counting
the value of the jewellery (which is not expected to alter this sum
significantly).

Division of matrimonial assets

17 In assessing the division of matrimonial property, the court is required by
s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter to have regard to all the circumstances of the
case, including the following:

(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or
work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

(b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for
their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

(c) the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the
family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged
or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

(e) any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and
division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

(f) any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party
in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

(g) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party
(whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or
support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation
or business; and

(h) so far as they are relevant, the following matters referred to in s
114(1):

(i) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which
each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the
foreseeable future;

(ii) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the
parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

(iii) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the
marriage;

(iv) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

(v) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the
marriage;

(vi) the contributions made by each of the parties to the welfare of the
family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring
for the family; and

(vii) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value
to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a
pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that
party will lose the chance of acquiring.

18 The parties had been married for slightly over eight years, from February
1996 to April 2004 when the decree nisi was granted. Two children were born of
the marriage. By all accounts it was a very happy marriage in the initial
years and it was destroyed only when the wife discovered in January 2003 that
the husband had an affair with her best friend. Indeed when the wife
discovered an earlier affair in 2002 that the husband had with his former
girlfriend, she had forgiven him for the sake of their children and because he
had seemed very remorseful. I took into account the wife’s contribution to the
eight years of marriage in terms of bearing and raising the children and
looking after the household, bearing in mind that the matrimonial assets came
mostly from the husband. He was 39 years of age when he married the wife, and
had acquired most of the assets (by value) before the marriage, e.g. the
matrimonial home.

19 In the event, I assessed that a fair division in the circumstances would be
a 35% share to the wife and ordered accordingly. With this division, it was a
matter of awarding to her the assets listed in the table in Order 8 as these
were most convenient to be distributed to her.

20 I should add that counsel for the husband had alleged that the wife had
siphoned out money during the period that she controlled certain bank
accounts. I had considered the evidence laid out before me and was satisfied
that this allegation was not borne out. The wife had undergone a difficult
period during the transitional period before the determination of the divorce
and ancillaries and had to utilise the moneys for family expenses. Although
she appeared to have incurred certain expenditures unreasonably, I found that
these could be explained as a natural reaction of a person in her
circumstances rather than part of a malicious plan to siphon away the assets
as counsel had, with great force, alleged. To the extent that those
expenditures were not reasonable, I had made the wife account for them. These
are reflected in items 20 and 22 of Schedule A of the order of 24 April 2007.

Maintenance

21 In January 2004, the Family Court ordered the husband to pay maintenance of
$8,000 per month to the wife and children with effect from October 2003. In
March 2004 the High Court increased it to $12,000 per month, backdated to
October 2003.

22 I took into account the fact that the husband’s income after tax in the
last seven years was about $20,000 per month. I also took into account that
the wife, who did not work throughout the marriage and with two children to
look after did not intend to work, had an income capacity from the assets she
would receive from the division of about $2,600 per month (after tax). Taking
into consideration all the circumstances of the case including the factors set
out in s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter, I was of the view that the husband
should be ordered to pay maintenance to the wife in the sum of $5,000 per
month and to each child $2,500 per month.

23 The circumstances of the case begs for a lump sum maintenance settlement of
the wife’s mainetnance. The wife is bitter about the divorce and the husband
has the capacity to pay a lump sum which would remove a potential source of
future conflict and enable the parties to focus on the needs of their
children. As the wife was 41 years of age, I applied a multiplier of 18 years
and ordered a lump sum (rounded off) of $1,000,000 to be paid by the husband
to the wife in lieu of maintenance.

Costs order

24 There had been considerable costs incurred in determining the issue of
matrimonial assets mainly due to submissions made by counsel for the husband
that the wife had siphoned out assets. I had found that this allegation was
without merit. In view of this and of the division I eventually ordered, I
adjudged that costs should be ordered against the husband.

Epilogue: Civil Appeal 99 of 2007

25 On 26 July 2007, pursuant to the order giving the parties liberty to apply,
the wife applied for execution of the orders I had made notwithstanding that
the appeals were pending. The lease for the apartment she was residing in with
her children would run out in October 2007 but the husband had not handed over
possession of the matrimonial home which I had ordered to be distributed to
her. In addition I had also ordered that the rental proceeds for the
matrimonial home be paid over to her with effect from 1 May 2007 which he had
not done pending appeal. In response, counsel for the husband said that the
wife has the means to make interim provisions pending appeal.

26 I took into account that the matrimonial home may be the subject of a lease
that made it difficult for the husband to hand over possession before its term
was up. However this did not justify his retaining the rental proceeds which
the wife might require in order to continue paying rent, whether in the
present rented apartment or in another one after the lease for that ran out.
As an interim order pending disposal of the appeals, I ordered the husband to
pay to the wife all rental proceeds from the matrimonial home within seven
days of receipt, and to pay all arrears from 1 May 2007 within seven days of
my order. I also ordered that upon expiry of the existing tenancy or its
earlier termination, the husband was to deliver vacant possession of the
matrimonial home to the wife within seven days thereof. Upon the wife’s
application I also ordered the husband to pay to the wife maintenance of
$5,000 per month with effect from 1 August 2007, which sums may be deducted
from the lump sum maintenance ordered.

27 The husband filed an appeal against these interim orders on 17 August 2007.
I had made those orders to ensure that the wife and daughters had a roof over
their heads and enable her to receive some maintenance pending disposal of the
appeals.
