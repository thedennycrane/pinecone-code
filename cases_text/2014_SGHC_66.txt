Choo Han Teck J:

1 The appellant, in this appeal against sentence, was charged with two counts
of drug trafficking (DAC 19309/2013 and DAC 19310/2013). DAC 19309/2013
involved 8.81g of diamorphine and DAC 19310/2013 involved 9.38g of
diamorphine. He pleaded guilty to both charges, and was convicted by district
judge Jasbendar Kaur (“the DJ”) on 22 October 2013. The DJ sentenced the
appellant to 12 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane for each charge.
She ordered the sentences for both charges to run concurrently, resulting in a
total sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane. The
appellant appealed against his sentence.

2 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the sentence imposed was against
precedents and that the cases relied on by the court below were not
appropriate. Counsel submitted that the court should have sentenced the
appellant to only 10 years plus 16 strokes in all. I reserved judgment to
consider the merits of counsel’s arguments and found that there were none.

3 Yong Pung How CJ held in _PP v Siew Boon Loong_ [2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at [22]
that a sentence is “manifestly excessive” if it is “unjustly severe… and
requires substantial alterations rather than minute corrections”, and further,
appellate courts should reject “the lore of nicely calculated less or more in
matters of sentence” (citing _Liow Chow and another v PP_ [1939] MLJ 170).

4 In his petition of appeal, a single sentence was listed as the grounds on
which the petitioner was dissatisfied with the DJ’s judgment. It read “[t]hat
the sentence is manifestly excessive”. When parties appeared before me,
counsel for the appellant conceded that an appropriate range would be 10 to 12
years’ imprisonment for each charge in this case (although he submitted at the
trial court that the range should be 7 to 10 years’ imprisonment).
Nonetheless, he then went on to argue that this _appellate_ court should
intervene to reduce the appellant’s sentence so that it comes nearer to the
lower end of the range. The adjustment in this case would have been a small
one and, there being no compelling reason or ground to show why the sentence
should be so adjusted, the appeal has to be dismissed. Furthermore, beyond the
appellant’s submissions, I see no injustice manifest, given that the sentence
meted by the DJ is consistent with recent decisions cited by the respondent.
