: **_Introduction_**  
  
The plaintiffs and defendants are both Singapore incorporated companies of
well known pedigree. They have at all material times been carrying on business
in the manufacturing, distributing and sale of paints.  
  
Both companies have been manufacturing and marketing a range of paints under
their corporate name in Singapore. They have been and are by far the dominant
players in the Singapore retail paint market.  
  
The plaintiffs filed proceedings in March 2000 claiming that the defendants
were passing off or attempting to pass off or assisting others to pass off one
of a range of the plaintiffs` wall paints, namely, an interior wall paint
which the defendants introduced and began marketing in October 1999 which they
called `Supreme 3 in 1` for the plaintiffs` interior wall paint introduced in
February 1995 which the plaintiffs were successfully marketing under the name
or mark `3 in 1`. The plaintiffs consequently prayed for an injunction for
delivery and destruction of the offending paint product of the defendants or
an order for the obliteration of the offending name or mark `Supreme 3 in 1`
from the defendants` product and damages suffered or at the plaintiffs` option
an account of profits.  
  
**_The undisputed facts_**

****

The plaintiffs and defendants have been manufacturing and selling various
brand names of paints under their corporate names directly or through a
limited number of specially appointed wholesalers to retailers and retailers
to customers. On divers dates after 1994 the plaintiffs and the defendants
introduced new interior wall paints which had as far as it is relevant the
get-up and livery in the following form and impression on their cans.

(a) In May 1994 defendants introduced:

On 7 February 1995, the plaintiffs had filed an application with the Registry
of Trade Marks to register its `Nippon 3 in 1` mark, ie at about the time the
said mark was launched. The Registry objected to the application on the
grounds that the mark contained numerals. The application was renewed by the
plaintiffs and filed on 5 February 1997. This time the Registry of Trade Marks
was only prepared to accept the application subject to a disclaimer to the
words and numerals `3 in 1` and the letter `n`. The plaintiffs` solicitors
wrote to the Registry stating that the plaintiffs were agreeable to having the
disclaimer imposed on (i) a word and numerals `3 in 1` and (ii) a letter `n`.
The Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) was amended in 1998 (Act 46 of 1998). The
amended Act permitted the plaintiffs if they had made an application after the
amendments were instituted to register the mark `Nippon 3 in 1` without a
disclaimer. However, the plaintiffs had still not attempted to register such a
mark when these proceedings came up to be heard. However, the defendants had
proceeded and registered their `Supreme 3 in 1` mark under the amended Act as
appears in the **_Trade Mark Journal_** , Journal No 69 dated 18 August 2000.
Plaintiffs` counsel stated in court that the plaintiffs would in due course be
raising an objection to the registration of the said mark `Supreme 3 in 1`.  
  
It was common ground established by the evidence that:

(i) over the years paint products had become more sophisticated;

(ii) both ICI and Nippon conducted their business through wholesalers and
retailers and also by selling their paints directly to contractors or end
customers;

(iii) contractors have been and are the largest group of paint purchasers and
as that could be considered as professionals, they knew what paint they were
buying and that about 80% of the paint sales were being made to such
contractors and further that correspondingly only 20% sales were being made to
walk-in buyers such as household consumers;

(iv) household consumers had a very high percentage of loyalty to a brand they
were used to;

(v) all retail outlets sold both ICI and Nippon paints in their shops. Such
outlet may give more prominence and exposure to the corporate brand name of a
paint where they specially represented one or the other manufacturer to
produce volume sales for better discounts;

(vi) both ICI and Nippon published colourful brochures and colour charts every
year for distribution to their customers both at the direct and retail level;

(vii) retailers presented the brochures and or colour charts to their
customers especially the walk-in customers and were in the habit of explaining
the different brands of paint to them and left the choice of paints to the
customers suggesting an alternative corporate brand name paint only where a
choice of colour was unavailable;

(viii) both the plaintiffs and defendants closely followed the paint products
of the other, conducted specialist independent surveys very regularly for
self-renewal and to feel the market`s needs;

(ix) the household customers as purchasers of paint were generally a literate
lot.  
  
**_The plaintiffs` case_**

****

The plaintiffs` case was that the plaintiffs were the first in Singapore to
introduce a `3 in 1` multi-purpose interior wall paint having launched it in
February 1995. The `3 in 1` mark for a paint was novel in Singapore. The `3 in
1` paint became successful immediately as the percentage share of sales of `3
in 1` show compared to the `Wash & Wear` brand marketed by ICI Dulux in the
statistics which were provided by the plaintiffs and defendants and which have
been set out earlier. The plaintiffs had since the launch in any case,
acquired goodwill in the name `3 in 1` and that name had become distinctive of
the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs averred that in October 1999 the defendants
introduced a new interior wall paint calling it `Supreme 3 in 1`. This mark
was a colourable imitation of the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` mark and since its
introduction and to the date of hearing the defendants in the course of trade
passed or attempted to pass off or assisted others to pass off `Supreme 3 in
1` product not being the paint product of the plaintiffs, as a paint product
associated with the plaintiffs and caused damage to the plaintiffs` business
by reducing their market share of the `3 in 1` paint. Plaintiffs` counsel also
submitted that although the defendants` `Supreme 3 in 1` brand was calling its
paint `3 in 1`, it in fact listed out eight attributes of the paint on the can
and their representation of their paint as `3 in 1` was part of the colourable
device to pass off their paint for that of the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs` counsel
further submitted that damage to them was also caused by a `creeping` passing
off which the defendants brought about from September 1996 when they had also
affixed on their `Wash & Wear` paint cans the additional mark `3 in 1`, first
in a small **_roundel_** and in the following year in 1997 by juxta-
positioning the `3 in 1` just below and next to the words `Wash & Wear` to
make it more prominent.  
  
Counsel submitted that based on the evidence of the plaintiffs` Managing
Director Philip William Medway (`Medway`), the defendants` conduct in
introducing the `Supreme 3 in 1` mark was according to para 10(d) of the
plaintiffs` amended statement of claim calculated to cause both confusion and
deception and was intended to mislead the paint buying customers because the
defendants saw that their `Wash & Wear` brand had lost its market share and
lost the competition to the plaintiffs` `3 in 1`. This intention of the
defendants could be discerned from the defendants` conduct of first
disparaging the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` paint after it first appeared by
cautioning customers not to be susceptible to the claims of multi-purpose
paints and soon afterwards introducing multi-purpose paints themselves with
the `3 in 1` concept. In short, the defendants` conduct amounted to a fraud on
the public. It was further averred by the plaintiffs that by October 1999 when
the defendants launched their `Supreme 3 in 1` interior wall paint, the
plaintiffs` `3 in 1` was already a distinctive mark and had acquired a
secondary meaning on which they had spent from 1995 to 1999 and as at October
1999 a total of $9,840,000 in promotional and advertising expenditure. Counsel
for the plaintiffs further submitted that even assuming as the defendants
contended that it was only a descriptive mark it had nevertheless become a
distinctive mark having a secondary meaning.  
  
It was also the submission of the plaintiffs that the disclaimer of the
plaintiffs dated 21 January 1999 to the use of the letter and numerals `3 in
1` and the letter `n` by them on their paint cans was not a bar to an action
of passing off based on its use of its `3 in 1` mark as the mark had assumed a
secondary meaning.  
  
The plaintiffs (through Medway`s evidence) claimed damages of $967,022 basing
it on an extrapolated percentage loss of plaintiffs` loss of market share
occasioned by the launch of `Supreme 3 in 1` in October 1999. Before the
launch, the plaintiffs` market share was 56.64%. After the launch period, ie
up to August 2000 the period up to when the internal management accounts were
available, the plaintiffs` market share had been reduced to 42.16%. All this
was evident according to Medway in exh P4 (columns A-M) the comparative sales
chart (1999-2000). The percentage difference or market loss was put by Medway
at 14.48% for the period. Medway expressed the percentage loss of 14.48% as
amounting to the sales figure loss of $967,022 for the plaintiffs on the
plaintiffs` and defendants` combined sales of their brands (`Nippon 3 in 1`
and Nippon`s newly introduced `3 in 1 MEDIfresh` plus ICI`s Wash & Wear 3 in
1` and `Supreme 3 in 1`) which amounted to $6,780,326.  
  
**_The defendants` case_**

****

The pitch of the defendants` case was that the plaintiffs distributed and sold
their interior wall paint not by reference to the mark `3 in 1` but by the
name `Nippon Paint 3 in 1`; that the numerals and letter whether in the phrase
`Nippon 3 in 1` or `3 in 1` by itself were used in a descriptive or generic
sense to describe the properties or qualities of the paint (three main
properties) and not in a trade mark sense. In the circumstances, the
plaintiffs could not have acquired goodwill and reputation in the above terms
to the exclusion of use by others notwithstanding how extensive or substantial
the plaintiffs` use of the term may have been. Further, the defendants sold or
referred to their interior wall paint under their own corporate name as `ICI
Dulux Supreme 3 in 1`, `Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` or `Supreme 3 in 1` from ICI
Dulux. Further, the plaintiffs` paint can bearing the marks `ICI Dulux Wash &
Wear` and `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` had a colourful and completely distinct
and different get up and livery on its above paint cans all of which was
incapable of causing any confusion between the defendants` brand of paints and
that of the plaintiffs and in the light of all the market conditions in
Singapore.  
  
The defendants further averred in their evidence and submitted that whenever
they reformatted paints or re-launched them it was done as a result of their
continuously monitoring the market for customers` wants in paints and as a
result of extensive surveys by their independent surveyors and market feedback
from customers. They had only thereafter introduced and positioned their
various brands `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear` brand (in 1994) that with the
additional `3 in 1` roundel (in 1995), without the roundel but their words `3
in 1` being given more emphasis by being placed next to the words `Wash &
Wear` (in 1996) and `Supreme 3 in 1` (in October 1999). The plaintiffs denied
they had disparaged multipurpose paints in their advertisements after `Nippon
3 in 1` multi-purpose paint was introduced. They had merely placed
advertisements with a humorous `tongue in cheek` touch (as was conceded by the
defendants in court) hinting to the public that they should be cautious in
reacting to messages carried by multipurpose paints that claimed to do more or
performed better than they actually could. The advertisements ended in late
1996. The defendants` own survey results had soon afterwards shown that
multiple attributes as a marketing platform was gaining popularity amongst
consumers whether it be paints or other products. The defendants began then to
adopt a multi-attribute platform for their paints to address the needs of
customers. The end result was that the defendants` `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1`
paint was a new product superior to and distinct from their `Dulux Wash &
Wear` product and the product was superior to the plaintiffs` `Nippon paint 3
in 1` being the best multi-attribute product in the market and was priced
slightly higher than the plaintiffs` `Nippon paint 3 in 1`. The defendants had
made a decision in June 1999 to manufacture and sell the paint which was then
manufactured and sold from October 1999. Defendants` counsel further submitted
that they themselves had introduced the mark `3 in 1` in 1996 on their can for
their interior wall paints which the plaintiffs admitted they knew of. As for
the eight attributes listed on the can, D1, the others were subsidiary to the
main three properties and were listed under the word `PLUS`.  
  
Defendants` counsel took strong issue with the plaintiffs` counsel on his
submission of a `creeping` passing off since September 1996 when they began
using the `3 in 1` mark alongside their `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` paint
to October 1999 when they introduced `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint. Defence
counsel stressed that the usage by ICI of the label `3 in 1` on their `Wash &
Wear` brand as passing off had never been the subject of any complaint nor
pleaded in the statement of claim by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs` claim was
restricted to the introduction of the `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` brand. The
plaintiffs had therefore acquiesced to the use by the defendants of the mark
`3 in 1` on their cans from October 1996 and were now estopped from raising
any issue thereon. The defendants had built up their own goodwill on the use
of the `3 in 1` mark. Defendants` counsel submitted that the plaintiffs were
not the ones to coin the expression `3 in 1` nor was it a fancy concept as
could be discerned from enquiries on the internet which showed that some
80,000 products were being sold with `3 in 1` attributes one of which was the
`Hammerite` paint being sold in Scandinavia. The plaintiffs had, to say the
least, acquiesced in the plaintiffs` usage of such numerals and letters quite
apart from the legal position that the defendants had no exclusive rights to
such usage themselves and could not nor raise their heckles over the
introduction of their new mark `Supreme 3 in 1` (which was marketed under
their corporate name). One of the three (most washable, covers hairline
cracks, better coverage) properties of `Supreme 3 in 1` was in any case
different from the properties canvassed by the plaintiffs` `Nippon 3 in 1`
(covers cracks, washable, waterproof), namely, that `Dulux Supreme 3 in 1`
gave `Better Coverage`. `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` had earlier expressed
the three attributes as most washable, covers hairline cracks, covers twice
the wall area.  
  
As for the defendants` improved market share, the defendants averred that
their market share had been doing badly in 1995 because of internal problems.
It had to change its management twice that year. They had brought in a new
management by 1996 and employed a large team thereafter to build up its market
share. The defendants` market share showed positive growth by their better
marketing and their market share had much improved by 1999 and even before the
`ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint was introduced as shown by the statistics.
`ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` was the best interior wall paint introduced and
that the brand sold more of their paint to discerning buyers. The defendants
had further been advertising both their `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` mark as
well as their `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` mark.  
  
Defendants` counsel denied any damage to the plaintiffs` business as such.  
  
**_Decision_**

****

  
  
**Issues**

The following main issues therefore arose for determination of the case:

(i) Whether the mark `3 in 1` was a descriptive term of ordinary usage, if it
was descriptive whether the plaintiffs had shown the mark to have acquired a
secondary meaning namely that the mark was recognised by the public as
distinctive specifically of the plaintiffs` interior wall paint or put in
other words, the term `3 in 1` had become well-known in the trade and to the
general public as Nippon`s paint exclusively or a paint that was connected or
associated with Nippon as such.

(ii) Whether Nippon had by reason of acquiring a secondary meaning acquired
goodwill in the said term or name `3 in 1` by 17 October 1999 when the
defendants launched their `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` interior wall paint.

(iii) Whether the defendants` use of the mark `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` was a
misrepresentation to paint consumers that the said paint was that of or
connected with Nippon`s paint product or was in any way connected with Nippon
or their business.

(iv) Whether there was acquiescence and/or a disclaimer on the part of the
plaintiffs touching and concerning the mark `3 in 1` in respect of which they
are now estopped from asserting otherwise.

(v) If there was passing off, whether damage resulted to plaintiffs and if so
what was the quantum.  
  
**_Law_**

****

Generally, the law has a discountenance for a descriptive mark or name to
operate as trade mark or name and it jealously guards the usage of ordinary
words or numerals from being monopolised by traders for sale of either their
goods or services. Any plaintiff claiming that such a trade name is his as
such has an onerous burden to discharge in establishing the same. As was put
by Lord Herschell in the classic case of **Frank Reddaway & Co v George Banham
& Co** [1896] AC 199 at 210; 13 RPC 218 at 228:

> _The name of a person or words forming part of the common stock of language,
> may become so far associated with the goods of a particular maker that it is
> capable of proof that the use of them by themselves, without explanation or
> qualification by another manufacturer, would deceive a purchaser into the
> belief that he was getting the goods of A, when he was really getting the
> goods of B. In a case of this description, the mere proof by the plaintiff
> that the defendant was using a name, word, or device which he had adopted to
> distinguish his goods would not entitle him to any relief. He could only
> obtain it by proving further, that the defendant was using it under such
> circumstances or in such manner as to put off his goods as the goods of the
> plaintiff. If he could succeed in proving this, I think he would, on well-
> established principles, be entitled to an injunction._

  
  
It may be instructive to refer to some guiding principles stated by the Court
of Appeal in **Super Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte & Anor**
[2000] 3 SLR 145  and other relevant cases as illustrations in relation to a
claim of passing off. The brief facts in the above case were that the
appellants since 1987 sold a `3 in 1` instant coffee mix under the mark `SUPER
COFFEEMIX` comprising of coffee, sugar and a creamer and when mixed with hot
water the mixture produced an instant coffee drink. The revenues of the
product rose from just over half a million dollars to some $8.2m in 1997 on
the back of aggressive promotional and advertising which by 1997 had cost
about $6m. The respondents were in the coffee business selling INDOCAFE coffee
products since 1990. In 1993 they had begun a similar `3 in 1` mixture which
bore the name INDOCAFE and an additional style `Coffeemix` (ie `INDOCAFE
Coffeemix`). The appellants sued the respondents for, amongst other things, a
restraining order and damages for passing off their goods as the appellants`
product `SUPER COFFEEMIX`. The appellants` action was dismissed both by the
trial judge and on appeal by the Court of Appeal. In dismissing the appeal the
Court of Appeal held that whilst the appellants had acquired goodwill in the
mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` there was hardly sufficient evidence to show that the
public had regarded `COFFEEMIX` exclusively as the mark which linked the
product to the respondents. The Court of Appeal noted that the two products
had a different design and packaging. The evidence of sales and advertising
related to the entire mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` and not `COFFEEMIX`. The
appellants had not sold or promoted their products as `COFFEEMIX`. Chao Hick
Tin J (as he then was) in giving the opinion of the court went on to state:

> _

Chao J then went on to hold that no evidence was shown that customers were
deceived and that there was no misrepresentation over the respondents` mark.
The learned judge observed that where a mark is descriptive, a minor
difference would be held to be sufficient to distinguish one mark or name from
another as was held in **_Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Office
Cleaning Association_** 63 RPC 39.  
  
**_Horlicks Malted Milk Co v Summerkill_** 34 RPC 63 is another pertinent case
in point. The plaintiffs manufactured a food preparation and sold it as
`Horlicks Malted Milk`. The defendants subsequently made and sold a similar
preparation but under the name of `Hedleys Malted Milk` and having done that
they were sued by the plaintiffs in a passing off action, the plaintiffs
claiming that the plaintiffs` preparation had been a trade secret and they had
invented and given the preparation the distinctive name of `Malted Milk` and
the same product had been extensively advertised and persons who asked for
`Malted Milk` intended and expected to receive the plaintiffs` product. The
plaintiffs` action was dismissed at first instance, then in the Court of
Appeal and finally in the House of Lords, the Law Lords being of the opinion
that the expression `Malted Milk` was merely descriptive of milk which is
combined or prepared with malt or with extract of malt. Earl Loreburn had this
to say:

> _The claim really is for a part of a designation which the plaintiffs have
> been in the habit of using. They have been in the habit of using the term
> `**Horlick`s** Malted Milk`. They now eliminate the word `**Horlick** ` and

In **Canadian Shredded Wheat Co Ltd v Kellog Co of Canada, Ltd** [1938] 1 All
ER 618 and **McCain International Ltd v Country Fair Foods Ltd & Anor** [1981]
RPC 69 `shredded wheat` products in the former case and `oven chips` in the
latter case made by the respective respondents were held to be descriptive
although the manufacturers had intended for the public to be able to tell from
the particular name the nature of the novel product. Further, in **Woodward`s
TM; Woodward v Boulton Macro Ltd** [1915] 87 LJ Ch 27, 32 RPC 173 it was held
that notwithstanding that the plaintiffs were the first persons to offer the
proprietary remedy called `Gripe Water` (on which several generations of
children have grown up), the term was to be properly regarded as descriptive
as the term `gripe water` was applied by pharmacies to preparations made up
extemporaneously.  
  
As for misrepresentation, the general considerations to be borne in mind by
the court are the possible deception and confusion of a plaintiff`s own
customers or the eventual consumers of the goods in question. It is sufficient
to show that there will be a likelihood of confusion amongst a substantial
proportion of purchasers of the goods. For this purpose careless and
indifferent buyers who disregard the get-up and livery on labels of products
may be disregarded as customers must `treat the label fairly`: Lord Halsbury
LC in **Schweppes v Gibbens** [1905] 22 RPC 601 at 606.  
  
**_Assessment of evidence: Plaintiffs` mark `3 in 1` - whether descriptive_**

****

I return now to the present case. The plaintiffs` pleaded case was an
infringement and passing off of their mark `3 in 1` which mark was prominently
displayed in a large format on their interior wall paint can (exh P1) since
its introduction in February 1995. The defendants had according to the
plaintiffs, caused the infringement in October 1999 by labelling their rival
paint can as `Supreme 3 in 1` (exh D1) wherein the portion of the mark `3 in
1` after the word `Supreme` was the offending portion. It had been submitted
that the offending portion was intended to cause and caused confusion and
deception in the market as it was passing off the defendants` product as that
of the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` interior wall paint of which mark the plaintiffs
were the originators in the paint market in Singapore and the distinctive mark
had assumed a secondary meaning, namely, that it had become distinctive of the
plaintiffs` business with goodwill attached to it. The defendants` forceful
contention, on the other hand, was that the plaintiffs` case was misleading as
the plaintiffs` paints were being marketed as `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` and not
just `3 in 1`. The get up and livery on the cans of paint of `Nippon Paint 3
in 1` and `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` was so different that there was no
possibility of any confusion in the minds of the paint buying public.  
  
It was plain to me from the outset that the plaintiffs were severing or
eliminating the words `Nippon Paint` just as the plaintiffs had severed the
word `Malted Milk` from **_Horlicks_** in **_Horlicks Malted Milk Co v
Summerkill_** professing then to have goodwill in the remaining words `Malted
Milk` which two words were held in that case to be descriptive words as I have
stated earlier. The plaintiffs in the present case had similarly pressed that
the defendants be prohibited from using `3 in 1` being the remainder of the
mark and that they also be compensated for trade losses.  
  
I am of the opinion that the `3 in 1` concept is not really in any form, a
mark that can identify meaningfully a product by that expression alone without
the manufacturer also linking to that expression either his corporate name or
other unique or distinct name so that the composite of the two can identify
the product or its source. There is no inherently identifiable characteristic
or source in a product simply called `3 in 1` or for that matter `2 in 1` as
that mark appears alongside some other **_proper_** trading marks. Clearly,
the expression `3 in 1` is a generic one, a descriptor and the `3 in 1` mark
on the plaintiffs` interior wall paint can, in my opinion, was an indicia or
reference to the inherent qualities of the paint which were boldly spelled out
across the can three times as `Covers Crack, Washable, Waterproof`. Indeed,
when questioned, Medway made this admission:

> _
>
> Q: The name `3 in 1` describes your product?
>
> A: Yes. The 3 main attributes are described.
>
> _

  
  
[NE p 24 line 8.]  
  
Counsel for the defendants had submitted that a search for the tag `3 in 1` on
the Internet today reveals some 80,000 `hits` on the `3 in 1` tag for
products. I had no reason to doubt him as plaintiffs` counsel took no issue on
this. Thus, shampoos (Herbalife 3 in 1 Shampoo (cleanse, condition and rinse),
WD-40 oil (lubricates, cleans, prevents rust) and Hewlett-Packard `3 in 1`
(print, fax and scan) are a few examples of `3 in 1` products. Defendants`
counsel submitted that the plaintiffs were submitting their case within a
paint and not a shampoo context and were the first to use the term `3 in 1` as
such. Also, the plaintiffs were using the term `3 in 1` as a fanciful term
within a paint context in Singapore.  
  
I reject the submission. The term `3 in 1` is too generic that it should be
arrogated for any one particular usage for a particular type of product in
Singapore to the exclusion of others. The Christian Bible, if I might say so,
when it refers to the word `Trinity` which represents God in its plural form,
may well be the first and earliest connotation of the concept of `3 in 1`.
Presently, the term has become a common expression used to describe various
properties of a product offered for sale highlighting three main properties
within a product as indicating its multi-purpose multi-attribute content or
use. The number `3` in the expression `3 in 1` is probably used by market
makers as representing and thereafter describing an optimum number of
properties that the general public has a memory for spontaneous recall.  
  
It was drawn to my attention that in the field of paints, `Hammerite paints`
in Scandinavia also expressed itself on its can as a `3 in 1` paint and lists
the three outstanding qualities of that paint. In **_Super Coffeemix
Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte & Anor _** (discussed earlier) the
plaintiffs and the defendants` respective brands both carried the `3 in 1`
mark or sub-mark. The plaintiffs wisely had not sued the defendants for
passing off that mark or sub-mark although they had introduced it six years
earlier than the defendants. No issue was raised there by the plaintiffs on
the adoption of such a mark by the respondents.  
  
This is not to say that letters and numbers alone or in combination would
always remain common and therefore descriptive. They can be accepted as
distinctive or having a reputation attached to them, over long user such as
the notorious cologne `4711` and perfume `Chanel No 5`. To my mind, however,
there is nothing inventive, novel, conjured or unique in the mere expression
`3 in 1`.  
  
The term `3 in 1` is, therefore, in my opinion, a descriptor. A mere
descriptor name cannot have goodwill attached to it unless the descriptive
term or name becomes distinctive and acquired a secondary meaning with long
user.  
  
**_Whether `3 in 1` mark as descriptor, acquired secondary meaning and
goodwill_**

****

The question then is as to whether the plaintiffs` 3 in 1` paint had taken on
a secondary meaning because it had become known in the trade and to the
general public as `Nippon`s paint distinctively or a paint that was connected
or associated with Nippon and had as such, acquired goodwill. As stated
earlier, unlike an inventive word, it is harder to acquire distinctiveness in
relation to a descriptive word. The word `distinctive` in the law of passing
off does not, I might emphasise bear an everyday meaning. It denotes the goods
of the plaintiffs to the exclusion of other trades.  
  
Had therefore the descriptive name or words `3 in 1` become distinctive of the
plaintiffs` goods? If it did, the plaintiffs failed to prove the same on a
balance of probabilities. The plaintiffs had, in my opinion, failed to
surmount a number of hurdles, in proving the same. `3 in 1` name was not used
in isolation but was a composite of words `Nippon Paint` so that the product
that was marketed by the plaintiffs was `Nippon Paint 3 in 1`. The goodwill
that the plaintiffs acquired was in the composite name `Nippon Paint 3 in 1`
with the corporate name `Nippon` being the significant mark which linked the
product to the term `3 in 1`. In other words, `3 in 1` on the plaintiffs` cans
was not a stand alone mark. The plaintiffs did not sell their interior wall
paint nor advertised or sold it simply as `3 in 1`. The publicity, promotional
material and advertisements always referred to the paint as `Nippon Paint 3 in
1`. Medway had admitted to this in the following evidence:

> _
>
> Q: Look at Core 22/23. In all your publicity and promotional material
> plaintiffs describe their paint as `Nippon 3 in 1`?
>
> A: Yes
>
> Q: Also in TV advertising reference is to `Nippon 3 in 1`?
>
> A: Yes
>
> Q: All the marketing and promotional material use term`Nippon 3 in 1`?
>
> A: Yes.
>
> _

  
  
[NE p 24 lines 20-26 and p 25 line 4.]  
  
Plaintiffs` counsel made reference to one write-up in a Television Corporation
of Singapore (TCS) in-house journal. In one of the lines of a brief article
the paint was referred to as `3 in 1` but having read the article, I was
satisfied that in the earlier paragraphs the words `Nippon Paint` had been
used and the `3 in 1` expression later was a short-hand way of referring to it
as Nippon`s paint. The short article must be read as a whole not in parts. It
appeared to me as if the plaintiffs were clutching straws to build goodwill on
an obscure article where the paint was referred to as `3 in 1` in the
particular sense.  
  
Medway also admitted in cross-examination that the plaintiffs` amended
statement of claim containing the references that the plaintiffs sold and
marketed paints by reference to the name `3 in 1` was `strictly not correct`:
[NE25 lines 23-24.]  
  
The plaintiffs had attempted to show that the `3 in 1` mark had become
associated or connected with Nippon and therefore had become exclusive or
distinctive in view of the evidence of some seven surveys done between 12
October 1995 and 27 December 1999 by Liew Lee Sah @ Chong Lee Sah, PW2 (`Ms
Chong`), the plaintiffs` independent market researcher and surveyor and
Managing Director of CLS Research Solutions. The plaintiffs also relied on
some of the survey evidence of the defendants` witness Kenneth Chih-Sien Tan,
DW3 (`Kenneth Chih`), the Managing Director of Acorn Marketing Research
Consultants (`Acorn`). The results of some ten surveys done between March 1999
and April 2000 were tendered in evidence as conducted by the plaintiffs.  
  
I am unable to place any sufficient weight on the accuracy of the survey
results. I agree with defendant counsel`s submission that formulation of the
questions in the surveys leave much to be desired. The totality of the answers
given were not produced or recorded nor the exact answers recorded or answer
sheets made available. Moreover, Ms Chong retracted in cross-examination
important aspects of the evidence which she had stated in favour of the
plaintiffs as follows:

(i) Paragraph 14: `Based on the survey results, my conclusion is that the name
and mark `3 in 1` has therefore become very well known in the trade and to the
general public as the plaintiffs paint exclusively or a paint associated with
or connected with the plaintiffs.`Ms Chong was asked if she will now withdraw
the said para 14, agreed to withdraw her said paragraph after being asked and
replying as follows to questions:

> _
>
> Q: Paragraph 12c of your affidavit: When you asked respondents: `If you ask
> your painter to use "3 in 1" there was no exclusive association of "3 in 1"
> with Nippon?
>
> A: Yes because there is another `3 in 1` in the market.
>
> Q: Paragraph 12c(ii) - of 302 consumers only 12% or 36 consumers knew `3 in
> 1` as belonging to Nippon?
>
> A: Yes.
>
> ...
>
> Q: There is never a survey that shows `3 in 1` refers to Nippon exclusively?
>
> A: None.
>
> _

  
  
In this regard, it is pertinent to recall the conceding evidence of Medway in
cross-examination as follows [at NE35 lines 11-13]:

> _
>
> Q: Based on the figures there is no exclusivity in sub-brand recognition for
> `Nippon 3 in 1`?
>
> A: Correct.
>
> Q: The public did not think that `3 in 1` was a name connected with Nippon
> and none other?
>
> A: Correct.
>
> _

  
  
These answers were telling.

(ii) Further admission by Ms Chong were made when she gave these answers:

> _
>
> Q: So `Nippon 3 in 1` has a much higher brand awareness over `Dulux Wash &
> Wear`?
>
> A: Yes.
>
> Q: Awareness of customers lies in the word `Nippon`?
>
> A: That`s natural. Yes. Nippon has been the parent brand. It is so the way

>
> Earlier she had stated:

>
> On the face of documents, the 1% of respondents replied `Nippon 3 in 1` and

>
> _

  
  
Indeed on the face of Ms Chong`s survey documents that were exhibited, the
respondents` answers reflect that the answers were `Nippon 3 in 1` rather than
`3 in 1`.  
  
In my opinion, the evidence in court of Ms Chong and Medway showed
unequivocably that it was not the term `3 in 1` simpliciter that Nippon was
marketing but the composite `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` brand. It was in that
composite name that the plaintiffs` goodwill lay.  
  
Faced with Ms Chong`s retractions the plaintiffs` counsel relied on the
defendants` surveys which they had asked for and conducted by Acorn to
establish exclusivity and hence goodwill but the surveys did not help the
plaintiffs as they were no more satisfactorily conducted. The plaintiffs
relied on Acorn`s survey report of 23 September 1999 conducted for the
defendants where the surveyor had made these statements amongst other things:

(i) `Conclusions & Recommendations "3 in 1" is now associated with Nippon` (p
1405).

(ii) `Brand Awareness...Nippon has established some ownership of "3 in 1" idea
(50% respondents are aware at prompted level` (p 1417).

(iii) `Association of Brands with Different Variants` -

see column that shows 51% interviewed recalled "3 in 1" (when asked to think
of paints).  
  
The 50% figure above is no doubt an approximation of the 51% figure in the
survey documented at 4AB1416. The document also shows 12% identified the mark
`3 in 1` with ICI, and 8% with other brands. Whilst 29% were not able to make
an association, defendants` counsel`s submission was that the 50% or 51%
itself did not show exclusivity even if the survey was accurate. Counsel for
the plaintiffs stressed that the 51% figure was sufficient to establish
distinctiveness and exclusivity for the mark `3 in 1` as the public could
recall `3 in 1` which was the mark that Nippon employed. Indeed, I observed
that Ms Chong, the plaintiffs` surveyor, had stated in her cross-examination
that there was no exclusive association of `3 in 1` with Nippon because there
is another `3 in 1` in the market. Ms Chong no doubt had in mind the
defendants `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` paint which had come into the market
in 1996 - just 18 months after the plaintiffs had introduced their `Nippon
Paint 3 in 1`. Medway himself when questioned on the survey statistics at
4AB1416 answered:

> _
>
> Q: Based on these figures there is no exclusivity in sub-brand recognition
> for `Nippon 3 in 1`?
>
> A: Correct.
>
> Q: The public did not think that `3 in 1` was a name connected with Nippon
> and none others?
>
> A: Correct.
>
> _

  
  
In fact exh 4AB1415 shows a `Top of Mind Awareness for a "3 in 1"` paint
simply described as such at 7%, but an awareness of 50% for ICI brand and 34
for Nippon brand. To my mind, this tended to show that the respective paints
are bought predominantly on the recognition of the corporate names rather than
their sub-names. Ms Chong herself agreed in **_cross-examination_** for
instance it was natural that awareness of customers lies in the word `Nippon`
as it was the parent brand. Anyway, the actual survey documents were not
before the court, only the keyed in results and they were therefore not
sufficiently intelligible. The full basis of statistical information could not
be substantiated to the court whether the surveys were conducted by the
plaintiffs or defendants. Again, the defendants` surveyor Kenneth Chih on
whose results the plaintiffs were relying, had also stated that in the same
survey 19% of respondents identified the `Wash & Wear` brand with Nippon
although Nippon did not sell such a paint: [NE147 lines 19-24]. This hardly
spoke well of the accuracy of the recall by respondents of the products of the
plaintiffs and the defendants. In the circumstances, I placed little weight on
the surveys.  
  
In any case, I am further satisfied that the 50% or 51% result even if it was
accurate does not establish exclusive association of the `3 in 1` mark with
Nippon in a paint mark which Nippon and ICI were the dominant players having
cornered the paint market between their competing brands. Medway himself
admitted that the public did not think that `3 in 1` was a name connected with
Nippon exclusively. Fifty one per cent constituted therefore, only a slim
majority not exclusivity. There was, as such, no secondary meaning to the mark
`3 in 1` as that of Nippon`s and consequently no secondary meaning with
goodwill attached to it was proved by the plaintiffs having regard primarily
(as well) to the incontestable fact that the plaintiffs manufactured and sold
their paint under the composite name `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` in which composite
name the true goodwill was built up as shown by the advertising, the brochures
and the cans of paint themselves and in which composite name the true goodwill
resided.  
  
As for plaintiffs` counsel`s submission that damage had also been caused to
Nippon`s `3 in 1` brand by the defendants by attaching the term `3 in 1` on
their `Wash & Wear` brand in October 1996 and that there had since been a
`creeping` passing off of the `Wash & Wear` brand for the plaintiffs` `3 in 1`
paint, I agree with the submission of defence counsel that this had never been
the subject of any complaint by the plaintiffs and that the defendants had
built up their recognisable `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand over the subsequent
three years before introducing their `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint. Only
the defendants `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` brand was the subject of the
plaintiffs` claim and the plaintiffs` pleaded case only asked for damages
against the said `Supreme 3 in 1` brand.  
  
It is significant to note that the `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand continues to
sell even after the introduction of the `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` brand and
alongside it without objection by the plaintiffs to the brand. The defendants
had therefore built up their own reputation on the mark `3 in 1` as used on
their `Wash & Wear` label and they were a **_fortiori_** entitled to use and
exploit the mark as their top-end grade of interior wall paint when they
introduced the `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1`.  
  
**_Acquiescence, disclaimer, estoppel_**

****

I further noted that the Registry of Trade Marks had in 1995 rejected the
plaintiffs` application for the numbers and letters in `3 in 1` `n` for
registration alongside the brand mark `Nippon Paint` no doubt because of their
generic or descriptive nature rather than distinctive nature. The plaintiffs
had therefore probably acquiesced when the defendants adopted and used the `3
in 1` mark on their `Wash & Wear` brand from October 1996 that they had no
exclusivity in the numbers and letters `3 in 1`. The plaintiffs were estopped
now from asserting otherwise.  
  
The plaintiffs` renewed their application in 1997. The plaintiffs` full mark
`Nippon Paint 3 in 1 `n` ` was listed as a pending mark by the Registrar as
one belonging to them only after the plaintiffs had **_disclaimed_**
exclusivity to the mark `3 in 1` and the letter `n` (exh D7(1-2)) as requested
by the said Registrar. Whilst a disclaimer is not necessarily a bar to an
action of passing off, I found however that the plaintiffs did not have the
necessary ingredients in place to establish exclusivity and goodwill arising
therefrom as stated earlier.  
  
**_Misrepresentation_**

****

I next come to the question of misrepresentation which ground in my assessment
of the evidence also fails.  
  
The gist of the plaintiffs` submission was that the defendants copied their
marketing strategy of adopting the `3 in 1` mark. The defendants added the
word `Supreme` before it to read `Supreme 3 in 1`. It was insufficient for the
defendants to distinguish `Supreme 3 in 1` from the plaintiffs` brand name `3
in 1` and the defendants` use of the `3 in 1` mark coupled with the word
`Supreme` was intended to cause and had caused confusion in the market among
paint buyers. The `3 in 1` sales of Nippon had dropped by 14.48% from the time
of the introduction of `Supreme 3 in 1` to August 2000 and had cost them a
market loss of $967,022 as put by the plaintiffs earlier.  
  
No evidence was adduced before me except for the hearsay evidence of a number
of plaintiffs` witnesses (which I disregarded) that the plaintiffs had
intended to deceive or had caused deception through confusion or otherwise in
gaining a market share of 14% for themselves on their `Supreme 3 in 1` over
the plaintiffs` `3 in 1`. The plaintiffs` allegation in their pleaded case and
affidavit evidence was that the defendants had up to October 1999 been losing
and had lost market share on their `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand. Defendants`
counsel pointed out by referring to the sales figures in exh P3(B) (Amended)
that this was incorrect. I accepted counsel`s submission. Medway had admitted
the plaintiffs` allegation was flawed and that the plaintiffs had been working
on the defendants` figures as a `guesswork`. The defendants` figures were only
made available at the trial. The defendants` `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand in
fact after the defendants had revamped their management by appointing new
managers, had begun to increase from $2.4m in 1995 to $4.007 m in 1996 and
from $4.0007 to $4.439m in 1998 and thereafter to $5.31m in 1999 before the
launch of their `Supreme 3 in 1` paint. The defendants had been narrowing the
gap between their two respective dominant competing brands of paint with the
new management and had been resorting to increased advertising. Indeed it was
the case of both the plaintiffs and defendants that their sales from the end
of 1999 (when the defendants` `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint was introduced
and the plaintiffs had brought out their new paint at the same time with the
mark `Nippon Paint 3 in 1 MEDIfresh`) to August 2000 had been adversely
affected by the Housing & Development Board`s (HDB) announcement at about the
same time that for the year 2000, HDB would be reducing the building of new
flats from 24,000 to 10,000. In my opinion, that is a significant reduction in
public housing and has impacted on both the plaintiffs` and defendants` paint
sales especially to a greater extent on the party that supplied more paint for
use on HDB flats. No statistics were placed before me on this aspect. The
burden was, however, on the plaintiffs which they did not discharge that they
had not lost their market share due to the implementation by HDB of their new
housing policy and at that not lost a greater proportion of the market share
than the defendants had lost.  
  
I could not in any way see the possibility of a confusion arising between
Nippon `3 in 1` and ICI Dulux `Supreme 3 in 1`. The get up, make up or livery
of the two brands was totally different as can be seen from the description of
the cans I have given earlier and more significantly if one views the cans.
ICI`s livery of all its brand is very colourful and vibrant. Nippon`s cans
have pastel appearance and the livery is very different. To put it shortly,
the difference in the cans between that of `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` and `ICI
Dulux 3 in 1` are discernable at first glance by anyone. The real selling
names are the corporate names `Nippon` and `ICI` as I have already stated. The
word `Supreme` on the `ICI` can before the mark `3 in 1` also constituted a
differentiation between the two brands. Then again the witnesses of both sides
were agreed that the paint market in Singapore was a sophisticated one. The
buyers were a literate lot. About 80% of the sales were through contractors.
Contractors were in my opinion unlikely ever to make a mistake of one brand
for another being habitual users. About 20% of the users were walk-in
customers. The evidence from both plaintiffs and defendants show that these
customers make at least two visits to a retailer and would be shown charts and
colourful brochures of paints and it was only then that they make up their
minds. Both plaintiffs and defendants introduced colourful brochures every
year. Purchasing paints was not an impulse buying. Then again there was the
brand loyalty factor. In view of all these circumstances I was of the opinion
that the defendants could not have intended to cause any deception or
confusion hoping to sell ICI Dulux paint for that of Nippon whatever sub-mark
was put on the paint cans. Confusion was highly unlikely to have occurred in
the circumstances. There was no evidence of confusion.  
  
**_Findings_**

****

For all the reasons given, I hold that the plaintiffs have failed to establish
a claim of passing off and no issue of ensuing damages as computed by the
plaintiffs or otherwise arises. The plaintiffs` claim is therefore dismissed
with costs to be taxed or agreed.  
  
**Outcome:**

Plaintiffs` claim dismissed.
