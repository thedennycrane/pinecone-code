Introduction

1 I will use the same definitions as in my judgment dated 4 May 2015.

Reasons for suing Dr Yue and SGHPL

2 Andrew has given two reasons for suing both Dr Yue and SGHPL as follows:

(a) judgment may not be satisfied; and

(b) higher chance of negotiating a settlement.

3 The elaboration of the first reason was that Dr Yue’s insurers might have
repudiated liability. Therefore, the fallback was on the hospital which would
have a deeper pocket irrespective of whether the hospital was insured.
However, this reason does not address the point that it would have sufficed
for Andrew to continue with his claim against SGHPL only since SGHPL did not
deny that it was vicariously liable for any negligence of Dr Yue.

4 The second reason was based on an observation in the English case of _Wright
v Cambridge Medical Group (a partnership)_ [2012] 3 WLR 1124. In that case,
the claim was against a partnership of medical practitioners and the hospital
was not joined as a party. Andrew submitted that Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury
had suggested that the hospital should have been joined as a party in the
proceedings as there was a risk of inconsistent findings if the defendants
were to eventually make a claim for contribution against the hospital. Also,
there might have been a better chance of a negotiated settlement (of the
plaintiff’s claim) if the hospital had been joined as a party.

5 In my view, one must bear in mind that in that case, the medical
practitioners were not the hospital’s employees. Indeed their defence was that
it was the hospital’s subsequent treatment of the plaintiff that was negligent
and that was causative of the plaintiff’s injury. That difference is important
as that case does not suggest that action should be commenced against both a
medical practitioner and a hospital when the hospital is accepting liability
for the conduct of the medical practitioner.
