**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

This was an appeal against the decision of Mavis Chionh DJ. The appellant, Yeo
Chiang Chew (‘Yeo’) was convicted of a charge under s 57(1)(e) of the
Immigration Act (Cap 133) (‘the Act’). The charge alleged that between the end
of September 2001 and 12 November 2001, Yeo had employed an illegal immigrant,
one Lin Rui Chai (‘Lin’) at "Yi Xin Shu Shi" Stall at Yishun Ring Road, with
reasonable grounds to believe that Lin was an immigration offender.

2 Under s 57(ii) of the Act, Yeo was liable for a jail sentence between six
months and two years as well as a fine not exceeding $6,000. Yeo was sentenced
to 12 months’ imprisonment and appealed against both conviction and sentence.

The offence

**_

3 The _actus reus_ of employment in this case was not disputed. An agreed
statement of facts which was admitted agreed that Lin had entered Singapore
illegally from Malaysia sometime at the end of September 2001, without any
valid entry or work permit. She had already been convicted of a charge of
entering Singapore without a valid pass and another charge of entering
Singapore whilst under a ban, without written permission from the Controller
of Immigration. It was also admitted that Lin was employed by Yeo at her stall
from sometime around the end of September 2001 to 12 November 2001 and was
paid about $5 an hour for washing dishes and cleaning the stall. She was paid
by Yeo either daily or once every two to three days.

4 Only the _mens rea_ of the offence was in dispute. Yeo claimed that she had
believed Lin to be a Singapore permanent resident because Lin had shown her a
"blue IC" prior to starting work. The district judge held, following
_Assathamby s/o Karupiah v PP_[1998] 2 SLR 744, that if Yeo had genuinely
believed in Lin’s permanent resident status, she would have a complete defence
to the charge.

_**

The prosecution’s case

**_

5 The prosecution’s case was that Lin did not show Yeo any "blue IC", so Yeo
could not have believed Lin to be a Singapore permanent resident on that
ground. Lin herself denied having any blue IC or having shown any such
identity card to Yeo. She testified that it was Yeo who approached her for the
job and no one at the stall asked her for identification documents, nor had
she shown such documents to anyone. On the day she was arrested, she was only
permitted to bring along her purse. SSgt Abdul Halim, the investigation
officer of the case, testified that no identification documents were seized
from or found on Lin. The arresting officer, SSgt Cindy Yong Jong Hoi (‘SSgt
Yong’) testified that she had searched Lin and tried to ascertain whether Lin
had identification documents elsewhere other than on her person, but Lin did
not have any such documents.

_**

The case for the defence

**_

6 Yeo testified that Lin was the one who approached her for a part-time job
and she had accepted Lin only after being shown a blue-coloured IC with a
photograph of a person who "looked the same as" Lin. She did not take note of
the name shown on the IC and could not remember what Lin had said her name
was. She called Lin "Big-size" and her other workers addressed Lin as "Xiao
Mei". She also did not know Lin’s exact address. The other two defence
witnesses, Yeap Ah Yam (‘Yeap’) and Phang Kia Lau (‘Phang’), both of whom were
workers at Yeo’s stall, confirmed that it was Lin who approached Yeo for a job
and that Yeo had told Lin to bring her IC. They both testified to having seen
Lin show Yeo a blue IC with a photograph resembling Lin herself.

7 It was not disputed that in her long statement of 12 November 2001 and in
her cautioned statement, Yeo had mentioned Lin showing her a blue IC.

_**

The appeal

**_

8 The district judge found that Yeo’s story about the "blue IC" was entirely
fabricated. She was satisfied that Yeo had failed to rebut the presumption of
_mens rea_. In Yeo’s appeal against conviction, it was submitted that the
district judge erred in fact and in law:

> > (i) when holding that she believed the assertion of Lin that no blue
> identity card was ever produced to Yeo;
>>

>> (ii) when holding that the evidence of Yeo was highly unsatisfactory and
finding Yeo’s story of the blue IC a pure fabrication;

>>

>> (iii) by failing to place emphasis on the fact that Yeo had in her long
statement mentioned the blue IC;

>>

>> (iv) by not accepting the evidence of the two workers as corroboration;

>>

>> (v) by holding that Yeo did not have any genuine belief that Lin was a
permanent resident simply because she looked non-Singaporean and spoke
strongly-accented Mandarin.

>>

>> (vi) by concluding that Yeo had reasonable grounds to believe that Lin was
a immigration offender.

9 The district judge’s decision stemmed entirely from the fact that she did
not believe any of the defence witnesses. In paragraphs 30 and 31 of her
grounds of decision, she clearly explained why she did not believe Yeo:

> > 30 The accused, on the other hand, struck me as being a shifty and
> disingenuous witness. In the course of watching her in the witness stand, I
> formed the distinct impression that she was attempting to put on a show of
> being even more simple-minded than Lin. From time to time, when asked
> questions by the DPP and by me, she would shake her head and mutter loudly
> about her lack of comprehension. Yet, when it suited her, she was able to
> answer questions readily and even, on occasion, to prompt the court
> interpreter.

31 The accused also showed herself capable of giving ambiguous and evasive
answers when it suited her, leading to questions having to be repeated
numerous times by the DPP and finally by me. It became clear that she was most
evasive when cross-examined about her account of Lin’s production of the "blue
IC". It must have been obvious to her that there were various loopholes in
this story. According to the accused, she only employed Lin after being
convinced that Lin was a permanent resident. According to the accused, also,
she would not have employed Lin if the latter had produced a forged IC. Having
regard to these assertions, it was very odd that after taking the trouble to
require proof of Lin’s PR-status, she should have taken only a "cursory
glance" at the "blue IC". It was also extremely odd that whilst she apparently
took care to ensure the photograph on the IC was Lin’s, she failed entirely to
notice any of the personal particulars on the IC, not even the name or the
address.

10 As for the other two defence witnesses Yeap and Phang, the district judge
at paragraph 35 stated that she "found their evidence equally disingenuous and
glib". In fact, she found that Phang was not working at the stall at all when
Lin started work and so, could not have seen Lin show Yeo any blue IC. There
were also "strange inconsistencies" among the testimonies of all three defence
witnesses. In paragraph 40, the district judge held that "both Yeap and Phang
struck me as being overly eager and suspiciously rehearsed in their accounts
of the "blue IC" incident. On careful assessment, I found their evidence to be
of no credibility and thus no corroborative value."

11 On the other hand, the district judge found Lin to be an honest witness
after observing her closely in the witness stand. She considered Lin "simple-
minded and guileless" (at paragraph 29) and believed her when she said that
she did not show Yeo any blue IC.

12 I found it difficult to accept any of the arguments raised by the defence
counsel once the district judge lost faith in the credibility of the defence
witnesses, since it is trite law that an appellate court will not disturb the
findings of fact of the court below unless they are clearly reached against
the weight of the evidence: _Lim Ah Poh_[1992] 1 SLR 713. In examining the
evidence, the appellate court has to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor
heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge’s findings
and reasons therefor. Moreover, seldom does a district judge go this far in
discrediting a witness and detailing her reasons for doing so. It was quite
clear that she had no doubts about the lack of truth in what the defence
witnesses were claiming. In the absence of objective evidence, it was
impossible to expect me to allow the appeal.

13 It must further be borne in mind that this was a case where a statutory
presumption had been placed on the accused and the burden was on her to rebut
it on a balance of probabilities. This is the policy decision taken by
Parliament. If the district judge did not believe her and her witnesses’
story, and she had no further objective evidence to back her up (such as a
photocopy of the blue IC to say the least), I could only defer to the better
judgment of the district judge since I myself did not have the opportunity to
observe the demeanour of the witnesses. Once it was held that Yeo was not in
fact shown a blue IC by Lin, there was no need to consider any further
questions on due diligence.

14 As for the sentence, I found no reason to disturb it as it was not
manifestly excessive. A 12-month imprisonment is the benchmark in cases where
an offender is convicted after trial of a s 57(1)(e) Immigration Act offence:
_Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP_(MA No 257 of 2000); _PP v Chia Kang Meng_(MA No 71
of 2001).

15 For the reasons above, I dismissed the appeal against conviction and
sentence.

_

Appeal dismissed.
