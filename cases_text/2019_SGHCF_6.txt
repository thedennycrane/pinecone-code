Tan Puay Boon JC:

Introduction

1 This is a divorce involving two septuagenarians (“the Parties”). They had
registered their marriage in Singapore in late 1974, and have a son (“the
Son”) who is now in his forties. He is married and has a son (“the grandson”).
The Plaintiff (“the Wife”) commenced divorce proceedings against the Defendant
(“the Husband”) on 2 November 2011 on the ground that he had behaved in such a
way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him (“unreasonable
behaviour”). While the Husband did not dispute that the marriage had broken
down, he contested the Wife’s claim and filed a counterclaim that the marriage
should be dissolved on two grounds – the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour, and
that Parties had lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years
immediately preceding the filing of the Writ.

2 Interim Judgment was eventually granted on 29 May 2015 to dissolve the
marriage on both the claim and counterclaim based on the grounds of the
Parties’ respective unreasonable behaviour, some 41 years after the marriage
was registered. The ancillary matters of the division of the matrimonial
assets, including the matrimonial home, maintenance for the Wife, and costs
were adjourned to chambers.

Background of the Parties

3 The Husband is a director at a company which is in the business of printing
and publishing. The Wife used to be a primary school teacher until her
retirement in June 2004. 1

4 The Parties were engaged to be married in 1969. However, due to certain
events which interrupted the Husband’s life from September 1970 to December
1973, the Parties were only married in Singapore in 1974. 2

5 The Parties purchased as their first matrimonial home a Housing &
Development Board flat located in the Whampoa area. The sale proceeds from the
first matrimonial home went into the purchase in 1989 of the current
matrimonial home at Jalan J (“the Jalan J Property”).

resulting in Parties having separate bedrooms in their matrimonial homes at

and filed for divorce in November 2011. Presently, the Wife lives with the Son
at the Jalan B Property and the Husband lives at the Jalan J Property.

7 Following the Wife’s application on 15 July 2015 for interim maintenance of
$4,000 per month, the High Court, on appeal, ordered the Husband to pay her
$2,000 per month backdated to commence from 1 August 2015.

8 There was a long delay between the commencement of divorce in 2011 and the
grant of Interim Judgment in 2015. This was because of the number of
amendments to the pleadings by the Parties, and the long time they took to
amend them. For example, the Defence and Counterclaim that was first filed on
12 March 2012 was amended on 9 May 2012 and then again on 12 January 2015.

9 After Interim Judgment was granted, the Parties filed 3 applications for
discovery and interrogatories, and also applied for an extension of time to
file responses. In addition, the Parties filed applications to strike out
affidavits, to appoint an independent forensic accountant, and to file further
affidavits. The Parties attended mediation twice as well. In the result, the
hearing for the ancillary matters took place only in April and May 2018. At
the time of the ancillary matter hearing, the Husband was 77 years old and the
Wife was 72 years old.

Matters in dispute

10 In the present case, the contested ancillary matters are the division of
matrimonial assets and the maintenance of the wife.

Division of matrimonial assets

The legal principles

11 The power of the Court to order the division of matrimonial assets (which
are defined in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) (“WC”)) is provided
for in s 112(1). The considerations that are to be taken into account when
making the division are set out in s 112(2), and include the matters that are
relevant for the assessment of maintenance of the wife, as set out in s
114(1). These provisions are well known, and will not be reproduced here.

12 In NK v NL [2007] 3 SLR 743 (“NK v NL (2007)”) (at [31] – [33]), the Court
of Appeal discussed two distinct methodologies that have been applied in the
case law in the division of matrimonial assets – the global assessment
methodology and the classification methodology. The global assessment
methodology “consists of four distinct phases: viz, identification,
assessment, division and apportionment”. The classification methodology
involves “an assimilation of all four of the above steps into a broad judicial
discretion which, in the first instance, separately considers and divides
classes of matrimonial assets”. The Court of Appeal explained that while there
is “much to be said for either method, both of which are consistent with the
legislative framework provided by s 112 of the Act”, in the final analysis,
the court should apply the methodology that achieves the paramount aim of
ensuring that the matrimonial assets are divided in a just and equitable
manner (at [33]). For the reasons set out later in this judgment at [54] to
[55], I have applied the global assessment methodology in the division of the
matrimonial assets of the Parties.

Identification and Assessment of the matrimonial assets

13 I deal first with the identification of the matrimonial assets and the
assessment of their net values. Parties are agreed that subject to the updates
of the valuations of two Singapore properties, viz the Jalan J Property and
the Jalan B Property, the assessments of the matrimonial assets will be based
on valuations produced around 2015, when Interim Judgment was granted. 10

Agreed Assets

14 The Parties had signed a Joint Summary of Relevant Information on 6 April
2018. Of the various assets that were listed, the total value of those assets
which were agreed to be matrimonial assets, where there were also agreed
valuations, was $2,256,667.53. These assets are set out in the table below.

15 I have omitted from the above table two items that were listed as agreed
matrimonial assets which also had agreed valuations in the Joint Summary of
Relevant Information. The first is the Husband’s shareholding in Company C.
While listed under the “Agreed valuation” column, later written submissions
from the Wife disputed the value of this asset. I will therefore deal with
this item separately below. Parties had further agreed that an item listed as
“Gold Vinyagar Ring with some Precious Stones” was a matrimonial asset, but
further agreed that this asset was “Value Unknown”. In those circumstances, I
took the monetary value of this item as being de minimis and ascribed zero
value to it. This item, together with other items that the Parties agreed to
be of $0.00 in value, have been omitted from the above table.

Disputed Assets/Assets with disputed values

I will deal with these in turn.

Assets jointly owned by the Parties

Jalan J Property

17 The Parties had agreed that the Jalan J Property which they held as joint
tenants formed part of the matrimonial assets but could not agree on the
valuation. The Husband claimed its value to be $3,500,000 and the Wife claimed
its value to be $3,430,000, based on valuation reports they had earlier
obtained. As both valuation reports were prepared some three years ago, I
ordered a revaluation of this property by a valuer appointed by the court from
a list of valuers they proposed. The valuation obtained was $3,350,000 as at
28 June 2018, and I adopt this as the valuation of the Jalan J Property.

POSB Bank Account No ending with 8107

18 The Parties agreed that the money in this account formed part of the pool
of matrimonial assets but could not agree on the amount to be included. The
Husband submitted that it was $51.21, while the Wife submitted that it was
$260.75. 12

##### Foot Note 13

Wife’s 2nd AOM dated 10 October 2017, pp 6, 104 and 105.

I will take the value of $51.21, which was the account balance on that date,
being the value closest to the date of the ancillary matters hearing. As the
Court of Appeal in Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy [2011] 2 SLR 1157 held
at [39], once an asset “is regarded as a matrimonial asset to be divided, then
for the purposes of determining its value, it must be assessed as at the date
of the hearing”. This approach has also been endorsed by the Court of Appeal
in TND v TNC [2017] SGCA 34 (“TND v TNC”). While not a hard and fast rule (see
TDT v TDS [2016] 4 SLR 145), a departure has to be justified on the facts (see
TND v TNC at [22] – [23]). There is none in the present case to suggest that
the value of $260.75 should be used instead.

Assets jointly owned by Wife and the Son

Jalan B Property

19 The Parties had agreed that the Jalan B Property formed part of the
matrimonial assets but could not agree on the valuation. The Husband submitted
that as this property was held by the Wife and the Son as joint tenants, 14

##### Foot Note 14

she should only be entitled to half of his valuation of $4,170,000, ie,
$2,085,000. 15

##### Foot Note 15

Husband’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 10, para 21.

The Wife on the other hand submitted that the full amount of her valuation of
$4,170,000 should be taken, 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

Wife’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 20, para 43.

although she submitted during the hearing that it was her half share that was
to be divided. 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

Notes of Argument dated 18 April 2018, p 3.

As both valuation reports were prepared some three years ago, I ordered the
Jalan B Property to be revalued. The same court appointed valuer valued it at
$4,200,000 as at 28 June 2018, and I adopt this as the valuation of the Jalan
B Property. Since the Wife and the Son are joint tenants of this property, in
the absence of any evidence of what their respective beneficial interests are,
I take each of them to hold a half share in the property. I will therefore use
$2,100,000 as the value of the half share of the Jalan B Property that is part
of the matrimonial assets.

Assets owned by the Wife

AIA Dollars for Life (CPF MSS) Policy No ending with 7018 18

##### Foot Note 18

Wife’s 1st AOM dated 30 July 2015, pp 128 to 139.

20 The Parties agreed that this policy formed part of the pool of matrimonial
assets but could not agree on the value of the AIA Dollars for Life account
under which the Wife receives a monthly annuity payment of $376.84 for life.
The Husband submitted that the value should be $30,402.92 after taking into
consideration the last monthly pay out of $376.84 made on 18 September 2017.
19

##### Foot Note 19

×

Wife’s 2nd AOM dated 10 October 2017, pp 6 and 96.

The Husband’s value was derived from deducting $42,206.08, the total of the
amounts withdrawn (up until 18 September 2017), from the premium sum of
$72,609.00. The Wife on the other hand submitted that the value should be
$33,417.64, but did not provide any such calculation or information on the
date on which the value was calculated. Given those circumstances, I found it
fair to adopt the Husband’s value of $30,402.92.

Jewellery given by the Husband

21 Parties were agreed that the jewellery given by the Husband to the Wife
formed part of the matrimonial assets. The Husband did not exhibit any
documentary evidence such as receipts to show the values of the gifts, but
merely stated estimated values which totalled $50,800. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

Husband’s 2nd AOM dated 9 October 2017, para 71 and pp 92 and 93.

However, the Wife disputed the Husband’s valuation and had marked the value of
the jewellery as “Not Known” in the Joint Summary of Relevant Information. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

See also Wife’s 1st AOM dated 3 February 2016, pp 72 and 73.

While one who asserts the fact bears the burden of proving the fact exists, I
do not think it would be equitable to just assign no value to the 29 items of
jewellery which include the wedding gold Thali and chain, two Rolex gold
watches, and many gold items. I would therefore use $30,620 (the same amount
that was accepted as the value of the Wife’s 23 items of jewellery) as their
value.

Retirement Gratuities

22 The Wife received $634,148.08 on 30 June 2004 when she retired as a
teacher. This was an agreed valuation, but the Parties disputed whether this
sum ought to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets.

23 The Wife submitted an itemised table to show how the sum of $628,176.24 was
spent from 30 June 2004 to July 2015. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

Wife’s 1st compliance affidavit dated 3 February 2016, pp 72 and 73.

Essentially, her point was that the sums had been expended prior to the date
of the divorce proceedings. The Husband submitted that the Wife made large
lump sum withdrawals from the retirement gratuities over the years and
highlighted the Wife’s feeble response of not recalling the details of what
these large lump sum withdrawals were for. 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

Wife’s 1st voluntary affidavit, p 85.

The Husband also submitted that since he had been giving the Wife monthly
maintenance of $2,000 until December 2011, the amounts which the Wife spent
from her retirement gratuities were not credible. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

Husband’s written submissions, p 28, para 69.

24 Some of the items in the Wife’s table were not supported by documentary
evidence. Where the Wife had exhibited documentary evidence, certain of the
documents were not readable or were without any explanation on what they were.
Hence, I will not take them into consideration.

25 After reviewing all documents exhibited by the Wife, I note that only
approximately $475,995 out of the $634,148.08 has been accounted for in the
exhibits. A large proportion of the items listed consisted of household
expenses which the Wife incurred on a daily basis. Given that the Husband has
been providing the Wife a monthly maintenance of $2,000 since 1999 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

Wife’s Brief Skeletal Submissions dated 19 April 2018, para 4.

until December 2011, it is not reasonable to find that the entire sum of
$475,995 was paid entirely out of the Wife’s retirement gratuities. The
Husband would have contributed a total of $180,000 (being $2,000 x 90) from
June 2004 to December 2011.

26 In light of the above, I find that the amount of $295,995 (being $475,995
minus the $180,000 contributed by the Husband) was spent by the Wife from the
retirement gratuities. I therefore add $338,153.08 (being $634,148.08 -
$295,995.00) from the retirement gratuities into the pool of matrimonial
assets.

Sale proceeds of shares

27 Parties agreed that the valuation of this item is $110,485.03. However, the
Wife disputed that this item should be added to the pool of matrimonial
assets. The Wife submitted that the sale proceeds of the shares should be
considered together with her retirement gratuities, where the breakdown on how
it was spent has been disclosed together with how the retirement gratuities
was spent. 26

The Wife further submitted that the Court should consider the purchase price
of the shares and the price at which the shares were sold, as it would show
that the Wife suffered losses of $114,894.20 instead. 27

the balance in that account is only $7,954.06. Therefore, the Husband
submitted that the Wife had not properly accounted for the sum of $110,485.03.
30

##### Foot Note 30

×

Husband’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 32, para 77.

28 Based on the evidence produced by both Parties, I find that the Wife did
not adequately explain where the sale proceeds of the shares went, and these
should be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. Except for the Allgreen
shares that were disposed of for $11,134.39 on 31 May 2011, all the shares
were disposed of by the Wife after the writ was filed in November 2011. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

Wife’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 21, para 46.

In TNL v TNK [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“TNL v TNK”), the Court of Appeal held at [24]
that when divorce proceedings are imminent, substantial expenditures incurred
by one spouse, whether by gift or otherwise, without the consent of the other
spouse should be returned to the asset pool. This is regardless of whether the
expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets or for
the benefit of children. Here, the shares were disposed of by the Wife shortly
before or soon after the writ was filed, and no adequate explanation was
provided on where the sale proceeds went. Accordingly, the amount of
$110,485.03 will be added into the pool of matrimonial assets. In so deciding,
I do not accept the Wife’s submission that this amount should not be included
in the pool of matrimonial assets because she had suffered a loss upon the
sale of the shares. This is because it is the current value of the asset, as
represented by sale price, that has to be divided. If the Wife is correct,
then any asset that has depreciated in value would never be available for
division, irrespective of the current value. By way of illustration, if the
value of the only asset of a divorcing couple that was purchased for $2
million has dropped to $1 million, it would not be included in the pool of
matrimonial assets for division, and will be retained by the spouse in whose
name it belongs. This would not be correct.

Gold bars and souvenir coins

29 The Husband submitted that he had left some gold bars and souvenir coins in
his room in the Jalan B Property before he moved out but has since been unable
to find them. Thus, the Husband alleged that the Wife took them. 32

##### Foot Note 32

Husband’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 32, para 78.

He has valued these items at $560,000. The Wife submitted that the Husband’s
allegation was not supported by any documentary evidence hence it should be
disregarded. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

Wife’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 22, paras 50 – 52.

I agree with the Wife’s submissions as there was no documentary evidence, not
even photos of the alleged gold bars and souvenir coins. Moreover, the Wife
was not the only person who had access to the Jalan B Property. 34

I will therefore not include the alleged gold bars and souvenir coins in the

Assets owned by the Husband

Johore Property

30 In UDA v UDB and another [2018] 1 SLR 1015 (“UDA v UDB”), the Court of
Appeal held that s 112 of the WC does not confer power upon the court to
adjudicate a third party’s claim to an alleged matrimonial asset or make
orders against the third party in respect of that asset. It sets out the
following options in cases where an asset legally owned by a third party is
alleged by one or both spouses to belong beneficially to them:

56 If the property is legally owned by the third party, then the following
options will be available to the court and the spouses.

(a) First, the spouse who claims the property to be a matrimonial asset may
obtain legally binding confirmation from the third party that this is so and
an undertaking that the third party would respect and enforce any order that
the court may make relating to the beneficial interests in the property.

(b) If this is contested, either that spouse or the other who is asserting
that the property belongs beneficially to the third party would have to start
a separate legal action to have the rights in the property finally determined,
vis-à-vis the third party, in which case the s 112 proceedings would have to
be stayed until the rights are determined. This would be Option 2.

(c) The third possibility would be for the spouse to drop his or her claim
that the property is a matrimonial asset and allow the s 112 proceedings to
continue without it.

(d) Alternatively, that spouse may ask the court to determine whether the
asset is a matrimonial asset without involving the third party’s participation
at all or making an order directly affecting the property. This is Option 1.

57 In respect of [56(d)] above, the family justice court should only take
Option 1 if both spouses agree to it, as this course could result in the
disputed asset being treated as a matrimonial asset and adjustments being made
in the division of other assets to account for its value when in separate
proceedings later it may be determined that the third party was both the legal
and the beneficial owner of the property and neither spouse had any interest
in it at all …

The Wife submitted that the Husband’s purported intention of gifting the
Johore Property to the Son has not been realised by any document, deed or

Wife submitted that this property should be deemed as a matrimonial asset. 38

32 Section 112(10)(b) of the WC defines “matrimonial asset” as any other asset
of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the
marriage. Hence, the Johore Property may be considered a matrimonial asset
even though the Wife did not contribute financially to the property.

33 Applying UDA v UDB, the option in [56(a)] is not available because the
Husband contested the Wife’s assertion, and Wife did not commence legal
proceedings as contemplated in [56(b)]. Since the Wife did not want to drop
the claim, the option in [56(c)] is also not viable. The option in [56(d)] is
out as well as the Husband was not agreeable to it. Even though the Johore
Property is held by the Husband and the Son as joint tenants, 39

The Husband’s companies

34 The Husband referred to Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine (“Ong
Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine”) [2007] SLR(R) 729, where the Court
of Appeal held that the court can exercise its discretionary power to exclude
a property acquired during the marriage from the pool of matrimonial assets
where there is good reason to do so (at [25] to [26]).

35 The Husband submitted that the companies were fully acquired and managed by
him and there was a complete lack of involvement of the Wife in them. She was
also disinterested in them, and sought to distance herself from any
liabilities resulting from the operation of the companies. When one of the
companies was in need of financing during the recession in 2000, the Wife had
refused to act as a guarantor so that he could obtain financing to sustain the
company, stating that “in business anything can happen, and that was the
recession period”. 41

Husband’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 18, para 38.

However, Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine involved a property
which was purchased at a time when the parties’ relationship had deteriorated
and the wife also sought to enter into a deed of settlement disclaiming all
responsibilities for its purchase (see “TNC v TND” [2016] 3 SLR 1172, at
[36]). I do not think the matters relied on by the Husband were sufficient to
warrant the companies being excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. It
is not uncommon for spouses to divide their roles, with one concentrating on
being the financial provider while the other concentrates on domestic matters.
The refusal by the Wife to act as a guarantor was because she could not do so,
being a civil servant. 42

It can also be seen from the perspective of her preserving her financial
status in case the companies did fail, so that the family could still depend
on her income as a teacher. I therefore include the companies in the pool for
division.

Valuation of the Husband’s companies

36 The Husband had applied for a court-appointed expert to value his
companies. This was opposed by the Wife who had already appointed an expert
while the Husband did not similarly do so. The Husband’s application was
eventually granted, and a court-appointed expert (“the Court Expert”) was
subsequently chosen and directed by the District Judge on 5 September 2016 to
value the Husband’s shareholdings in the six companies as of 31 December 2016.
There were no terms of reference ordered, but the scope of work was agreed
between Parties. 43

The Wife disputed the Court Expert’s valuation of the Company Property and
submitted that a higher figure of $8.5 million should be adopted instead. She
said that the Court Expert considered three different methods of valuing the
Company Property, the Direct Comparison Approach, the Market Approach and the
Discounted Cash Flow Approach. While the Direct Comparison Approach would
value the property at $8 million, the Market Approach would value it at $5.6
million and the Discounted Cash Flow Approach would value it at $5.6 million,
the Court Expert valued the property at $6.4 million. The Wife submitted that
this was an average valuation of the three valuations, and the Court Expert
had no basis for doing so. She submitted that the value of the Company
Property should instead be $8.5 million. 45

Notes of Argument dated 14 April 2018, p 4.

38 In NK v NL [2010] 4 SLR 792 (“NK v NL (2010)”), the Court of Appeal held at
[6] that:

… a court could intervene if a court-appointed valuer does not act in
accordance with his terms of reference, or if his valuation was patently or
manifestly in error. This is subject to the caveat that the court would be
slow to find that the valuation is in error, since by appointing an expert in
the first place it has taken the position that the matter is best left to the
expert.

and further held at [20] that where there are legitimate differences of
opinion between experts on the valuation, it would not warrant intervention by
the court.

39 I do not find that the Court Expert failed to act in accordance with his
terms of reference, that his valuation was patently or manifestly in error or
that the method used was wholly inappropriate for valuing shares of a private
company. Indeed, the Wife acknowledged that she was not in a position to say
that the Court Expert was completely wrong, but was asking the court to
consider the various valuations and his reasons, and to come to its own view
on the valuation. At the draft stage of his report, the Court Expert had also
taken on board the views of the Wife’s expert where he agreed with them, but
not others where he disagreed. 48

and how he treated the various cash advances the Husband made to the company.
After reviewing the Court Expert’s reasons for arriving at the value of the
Company Property at $6.4 million and how he valued the company, I find that
the Court Expert has adequately explained how he arrived at the valuation and
I agree with the Court Expert’s valuation. Accordingly, I accept the valuation
of the Husband’s shareholdings in Company C to be the Court Expert’s valuation
of $11,506,014, and add it to the pool of matrimonial assets.

Company D

40 The Court Expert stated that the value of the Husband’s shares in Company D
is $0. This was based on a duly executed share purchase agreement dated 19
July 2007 that showed that the Husband has sold his shares to a third party.

42 Having reviewed the evidence, I am inclined to agree with the Court Expert,
as there is a duly executed share purchase agreement showing that all of the
Husband’s shares in Company D has been sold. As the Husband is no longer a
shareholder in the company, it is up to Company D to make the necessary
arrangements to remove the Husband’s name from the company’s profile search
and not for the Husband to ensure this was the case. I therefore exclude the
shares in the company from the pool of matrimonial assets.

Company E

43 Company E was wound up by the Husband and he closed its bank account in or
around January 2012. The account had AUD 553,836.19 at the time it was closed
and the Husband transferred AUD500,000 to an account of a third party to hold
on trust for Company E, and AUD53,836.19 to his personal bank account. There
was a suit commenced in Australia for the AUD500,000 as the amount was frozen
by a third party. The Court of Appeal of Victoria, Australia held that the
AUD500,000 was for repayment of a loan owed to the third party and as such it
did not form part of the assets of Company E. Accordingly, Company E did not
have any assets at the time it was wound up. 53

Motor Vehicle – Mercedes Benz

45 The Husband had purchased the motor vehicle at a price of $322,888. While
the Parties agreed that the motor vehicle is part of the pool of matrimonial
assets, the Husband submitted that the value of the motor vehicle should be
$197,888, being the price of the vehicle less the loan amount of $197,000. 55

which was the price of the motor vehicle. I accept as a matter of principle
that it is the net value of the motor vehicle that should be added to the pool
of matrimonial assets. This is the current value of the motor vehicle less any
outstanding loan. It is not clear how the documents provided by the Husband on
the purchase of the motor vehicle are relevant for establishing the net value.
They were on the proposed purchase of a bigger model in 2014, and the

or before August 2016. However, it appears that the Wife has accepted that the
price of the motor car to be the $322,888 provided by the husband. Given that
the Husband is claiming a value of $197,888 and the Wife is claiming a value
of $322,888, in the absence of other evidence, I am constrained to accept the
lower amount of $197,888 as the net value, and accordingly add it to the pool
of matrimonial assets.

London Property

46 The Husband disputed that the London Property formed part of the pool of
matrimonial assets. He submitted that he is holding the London Property on
trust for his cousins. This is because it was meant to be a gift to the
cousins when it was purchased in 1997 as his cousins were facing financial
difficulties. 58

48 Although the cousins had filed an affidavit explaining that the beneficial
interest in the London Property belonged to them, the evidence is hardly
persuasive. The payments by them for utilities expenses and council tax are
not inconsistent with them not having beneficial ownership of the property, as
tenants also do make such payments. The other expenses were for minor
renovations, the general upkeep of the property, purchase of furniture and
appliances which added up to a relatively insignificant sum. If indeed the
only obstacle holding the Husband back from transferring the property was to
avoid incurring stamp fees, one would have expected the Husband to have done
his calculations on the costs of such transfer. However, the Husband was
unable to even submit on how much the stamp duty is payable for the transfer
of the property now, or how much estate duty would have to be paid if his
intention is to bequeath the property to the cousins upon his death, 64

49 The Husband had previously owned the Race Course Road Property which he
bought in December 2006 for $1,350,000 and sold in February 2007 for
$1,600,000. The Wife submitted that the net proceeds of sale should be
included in the pool of matrimonial assets as the Husband was not able to
provide any documentary evidence on where the money went. They should be
treated in a like manner as what the Husband had submitted on how the proceeds
of sale of her shares should be treated. 67

As the Race Course Property had been sold in 2007, some four years before the
divorce proceedings were filed, I accepted that the proceeds would have found
their way into the Husband’s bank accounts and utilised since then. In
contrast, the proceeds of sale of the Wife’s shares that were sold when the
divorce was imminent or soon after it was filed had to be included (TNL v TNK
at [24]). I will therefore not include the sale proceeds of the Race Course
Property into the pool of matrimonial assets.

Notes of Argument of 18 April 2018, p 1.

There, the Court of Appeal laid out a structured approach for the division of
matrimonial assets. That structured approach was succinctly summarised in TIT
v TIU [2016] 3 SLR 1137 (“TIT v TIU”) at [21] as follows:

(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each
other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made
towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets (“Step 1”);

(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to
each other, having regard to both financial and nonfinancial contributions
(“Step 2”); and

(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking
an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as
“the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of
each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal
weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the
other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors
under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the
Charter”) (“Step 3”).

53 I will apply this structured approach in the present case.

Global assessment methodology vs Classification methodology

54 In TNC v TND [2016] SGHCF 9 (“TNC v TND”), the Court held that the
classification approach would be appropriate where there were multiple classes
of assets to which the parties had made different contributions and some
assets were not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts
that the marriage represented. The Court held further at [39] and [40] that:

39 The first methodology, "the global assessment methodology", is far more
commonly used than the “classification methodology”. Pursuant to the
classification methodology, only the direct contributions may vary. The
classification approach “would be appropriate where there are multiple classes
of assets, and where the parties have made different contributions” to each
class: NK v NL (2007) at [35]. The weightage accorded to indirect
contributions must remain constant in relation to each class of assets, since
indirect contributions can only be assessed and applied at the end of the
marriage: AYQ v AYR and another matter [2013] 1 SLR 476 at [22] to [23]. The
court must avoid the “blinkered” approach where “varying weights are accorded
for indirect contributions in different matrimonial asset classes” (at [23]).

40 Since the presence of different direct contributions to different assets
has never stood in the way of a court dividing the matrimonial assets
globally, there must be something more to indicate that the classification
methodology may be the more suitable approach. In my view, assets can be
separately divided if some are not wholly the gains of the co-operative
partnership of efforts that the marriage represents. Professor Leong Wai Kum
stated in Elements of Family Law in Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013)
(“Elements”) at p 577 that “[t]he power to divide matrimonial assets is driven
by the motive to share the gains of the marital partnership as fairly as
possible between the former marital partners” [emphasis added]. In Professor
Leong’s view, there is a meaningful distinction to be made between
“quintessential matrimonial assets”, which are assets that wholly represent
the gains of the marital partnership, and those which are not. She describes
assets acquired during the marriage by the efforts of one or both parties as
“quintessential” matrimonial assets (Elements at p 557).

55 The Husband submitted that pursuant to the approach laid out in TNC v TND,
the classification methodology would be appropriate for the Husband’s
shareholdings in the six companies and his foreign properties. 70

Wife’s Brief Supplemental Submissions dated 19 April 2018, p 1, para 1.

Amongst the reasons she provided in support was that the London and Johore
Properties which the Husband claimed to be holding on trusts for others were
not, in fact, trust properties. Given that there had been no substantive
submissions on how the classification methodology is to be applied,
particularly on how the other assets are to be classified and what the
Parties’ direct contributions were in some of the assets like jewellery and
cars, I found that there was little to no utility in applying the
classification methodology. I have found that the London and Johore Properties
were not trust properties, but belonged to the Husband. For his shareholding
in the companies, the Wife has not claimed to make any direct contributions,
so that dealing with them as a separate class would not have made any
difference, as indirect contributions are applied across the board to all
classes of assets in any event (see AYQ v AYR [2013] 1 SLR 476, at [22] –
[24]). Requesting for further submissions on the point would only draw out an
already long fought legal battle. In the circumstances, I will adopt the
global assessment methodology. I note that the Court of Appeal has observed in
NK v NL (2007) at [35] that in the vast majority of cases, “either approach
would likely achieve the same result”.

Step 1

Parties’ direct contributions

56 Given that there is not always evidence of the Parties’ direct
contributions in the acquisitions of the various matrimonial assets, I am
constrained to use the value of a party’s share in an asset as a proxy of his
or her direct contribution in the acquisition of those assets. For
consistency, where there is evidence of the Parties’ direct contributions, I
have used the ratio of the direct contributions to apportion the value of that
asset between the Parties. I then attribute the apportioned values as the
Parties’ respective direct contributions.

57 For the amount of $304.27 in the POSB Account No ending with 7029, even
though it is held jointly by the Wife and the Son, Parties have agreed that
the amount in the account is a matrimonial asset. Since there is no claim on
it by the Son, I will attribute it to the Wife solely.

58 For the Jalan J Property, the Wife submitted that her CPF statement as at 6
October 2017 shows that she had utilised $172,400.00 towards its payment. 72

Wife’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 41, para 92.

While the Husband accepted that the Wife did make this payment, he claimed
that he had repaid her in cash for the entire sum. Hence, he took the view
that the Wife did not make any direct contributions towards the purchase of
the Jalan J Property. 73

Husband’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 19, para 42.

I was unable to accept this claim by the Husband, as his paying the Wife in
cash for the amount was not evidenced in any document. Even if the repayments
were in cash, there would be records of the bank accounts from which the money
was withdrawn. None was provided in support of the Husband’s claim.

59 The apportionment of each party’s direct contributions towards the Jalan J
Property is therefore as follows:

Apportionment of the value of the Jalan J Property ($3,350,000) between the
Parties| $721,255.00| $2,628,745.00  
  
60 In coming to this finding, I am aware that Parties had taken out a
Government Loan of $205,000 and a Credit POSB Loan of $45,000 to pay for the
purchase of the Jalan J property. In the usual course of events, they would
have paid for these loans using both their CPF savings and cash savings.
However, in the absence of any evidence on what they had paid in cash, this is
the best result I can arrive at.

61 For the POSB account ending with 8107, since it is a joint account of both
Parties, I will ascribe the balance of $51.21 to each equally.

62 For the Jalan B Property, the Wife did not contend that she made any direct
contributions towards the acquisition of the property. The Husband submitted
that, in 2001, he paid $1,600,000 in cash for the Jalan B Property and an
additional $137,642.87 in renovations. The amount to be ascribed to the
Husband’s direct contribution is therefore $2,100,000 (being half the value of
$4,200,000).

63 For the Johore and London properties, the Wife also did not contend that
she made any direct contributions towards their acquisition, I therefore
ascribe their respective values of $636,527.04 and $682,614.21 as the
Husband’s direct contributions towards these properties.

64 Save for what has been set out above, the Wife has not made any claims that
she had directly contributed to the matrimonial assets in the possession of
the Husband. I therefore proceed on the basis that the rest of the assets in
the possession of the Husband were paid for by him solely.

65 For the rest of the assets in the possession of the Wife, the Husband
accepted that the Wife had contributed to her own assets save for the
jewellery he gifted her. 77

67 The ratio of direct contributions between the Wife and the Husband is
therefore 6.16:93.84.

Step 2

Parties’ indirect contributions

68 The Wife submitted that the ratio of indirect contributions ought to be
80:20 between her and the Husband. Broadly, she stated that she was the
primary caregiver of the Son and contributed to the household and Son’s
expenses from 2003. She argued that even though Parties had domestic helpers
(from 2003), she had to manage both the Jalan B and the Jalan J properties and
either personally saw to chores or supervised the domestic helpers. The Wife
also argued that she had to top up $1,500 to the monthly $2,000 which the
Husband paid to her as maintenance for the household expenses. She further
submitted that she was involved in the activities of the Husband’s side of the
family and organised family gatherings. 78

She added that during certain periods of her marriage, she had hosted the
Husband’s relatives and business associates at home for meals; for a number of
years bought and prepared gifts for his staff of about 120 during Christmas;
assisted in accompanying his mother to the doctors when she was very ill and
visited her daily whenever she could; and provided emotional support to him
during a dispute in his family. 79

contribution of a sum of money to the household expenses, household expenses
at the Jalan B Property from March 2012, helper’s salary and levy for the

70 In contrast, the Husband submitted that the ratio of indirect contributions
ought to be 70:30 between him and the Wife. He argued that the Son was taken
care of by the Wife’s mother, grandmother, siblings and domestic helpers when
young, and he had an active role bringing up the Son. The Husband also argued
that he was the financial provider for the family, paid for all expenses
including repair works on the house, paid for the Son’s overseas education and
provided for the Wife’s immediate family. The Husband further argued that he
provided the Wife with a monthly allowance and reimbursed her for household
expenses. 84

Joint Summary of Relevant Information dated 6 April 2018, p 21 and Husband’s
written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 24.

71 I found the ratios submitted by the Parties to be over generous. This was
not a marriage where only the Husband contributed to the household but it was
one where both Parties worked during the entirety of their marriage (up to the
point when the Wife retired in June 2004). Whilst I acknowledge that the Wife
did not dispute that the Husband paid for the bulk of the family’s expenses
including the Son’s education overseas, 85

Husband’s 1st AOM para 51.

Parties (as the Husband admitted) had led separate lives for at least 22 out
of 41 years of the marriage when they slept in separate rooms or even lived in
different houses. It is thus believable that the Wife had to maintain the
household expenses by herself. 86

In addition, when the Wife was a full-time working mother, she had contributed

Even though she had the assistance of a helper (from the time the Son was

), the Husband did not allege that the Wife delegated all of the household
responsibilities to the helper.

72 I note also that little has been said about the Husband’s role as a father
during the growing years of the Son beyond him saying that he spent a
substantial amount of time tutoring the Son in English, fetching him to school
daily when he was 8 to 10 years old and attending his school functions. 89

##### Foot Note 89

×

Husband’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018, p 24.

73 The Parties did not submit on any authorities to support their proposals on
the indirect contributions. I refer to the following three cases where the
lengths of the marriages were also substantial as guides:

(a) In TEG v TEH and another matter [2015] SGHCF 8, both the husband and wife
had worked full-time throughout the marriage and had three children, one of
whom had severe cerebral palsy, who were all adults at the time of hearing.
The marriage lasted for about 22 years. The ratio was 65:35 between the wife
and the husband on indirect contributions.

(b) In Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin Thor [2014] SGHC 185, both husband and wife
had worked throughout the marriage, although the wife worked part-time.
Parties have two children who were 25 and 23 years old. The marriage lasted
for about 29 years. The ratio was 50:50 for indirect contributions.

(c) In TPY v TPZ and another appeal [2017] SGHCF 2, the husband and wife had
worked full-time throughout the marriage and relied on a domestic helper
substantially for homemaking and caregiving in order to focus on their
respective careers. The wife was the main supervisor of the domestic helper as
the husband frequently travelled for work throughout the marriage and was not
at home in those periods thus weighing slightly in the wife’s favour. The
marriage lasted for about 13 years. The Court found the ratio of indirect
contributions of 60:40 between the wife and the husband.

74 Having regard to these cases, and the circumstances of the present case, in
particular the length of the marriage and the nature of each party’s indirect
contributions, I am of the view that a ratio of 60:40 between the Wife and the
Husband would be just and equitable.

Step 3

Average ratio

75 After deciding on the ratios of direct and indirect contributions, I arrive
at the overall average (rounded off) ratio of 33:67 between the Wife and the
Husband based on the computations in the table immediately below:

| Wife (%)| Husband (%)  
---|---|---  
Direct Contributions| 6.16| 93.84  
Indirection Contributions| 60.00| 40.00  
Average| 33.08 ≈ 33| 66.92 ≈ 67  
  
76 The Wife submitted that a higher weight should be given to the indirect
contributions of Parties, as the marriage has lasted 37 years before the writ
was filed. However, the calculations presented appeared to be based on equal
weights being given to indirect and direct contributions. 90

Wife’s Brief Supplemental Submissions dated 19 April 2018, p 1, paras 2 and 3.

77 In ANJ v ANK (at [27]), the Court of Appeal held that the average ratio
under Step 3 may be calibrated by giving different weights to direct and
indirect contributions depending on the circumstances of the case. The
relevant factors to be considered include the length of the marriage, the size
of the matrimonial assets and its constituents, and the extent and nature of
the indirect contributions. I am not minded to adjust the Parties’ respective
average percentage contributions by giving different weightages to the direct
and indirect contributions as the facts presented no compelling reason to do
so. The importance of each of the factors to be considered has already been
duly recognised in the percentages of the direct and indirect contributions.
In my view, the ratio of 33:67 between the Wife and the Husband was a just and
equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

Adverse Inference

78 The Wife argued that an adverse inference should be drawn against the
Husband as he had failed to provide all information required for the Court
Expert to value the six companies, 91

##### Foot Note 91

and that the information provided to the Court Expert came mainly from persons
who were either employed by the Husband or affiliated to the Husband’s
Companies. 92

80 The Husband also argued that an adverse inference should be drawn against
the Wife with regard to her retirement gratuities of $634,148.08 and sale
proceeds of the shares that she sold shortly after the divorce proceedings
were commenced. The Husband alleged that the Wife had habitually kept records
of the Parties’ lives from as early as 1970s, but yet claimed that she could
not recall or did not have any records of how she spent the retirement
gratuities. 95

##### Foot Note 96

81 The Husband therefore sought the full sum of the retirement gratuities and

assets and for an adverse inference to be drawn. He also pointed out that the
$201,410.51 the Wife received when her five insurance policies matured between
2012 and 2014 had not been accounted for and should be returned to the pool of
matrimonial assets. 97

##### Foot Note 97

×

Notes of Argument dated 18 April 2018, p 9 and Exhibit D2.

82 The Wife did not submit on any cases for adverse inference to be drawn,
while the cases submitted by the Husband did not exactly shed much light on
the conditions that must be present for the Court to draw an adverse
inference.

83 Instead, I found the following excerpt in TIT v TIU, where the High Court
held that the duty of full and frank disclosure must extend with equal force
to material facts, to be useful in determining which non-disclosures would
warrant the drawing of an adverse inference:

31 As noted by the Court of Appeal in BG v BF [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 (“BG v BF”),
at [52], the general duty owed by parties to the court to “make full and frank
disclosure of all relevant information within his or her knowledge [,] is
particularly relevant in the context of the division of matrimonial assets.”
The absence of full and frank disclosure would entitle the court to draw a
suitable adverse inference.

32 In the context of matrimonial proceedings, the lack of full and frank
disclosure is normally argued in the context of one party not disclosing his
or her assets (see, for example, Koh Kim Lan Angela v Choong Kian Haw [1993] 3
SLR(R) 491 at [31]). Nevertheless, in keeping with the observations of the
Court of Appeal in BG v BF that the duty of full and frank disclosure is one
that is derived from general law, the duty of full and frank disclosure must
extend with equal force to material facts.

33 In Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah)
[2000] 1 SLR(R) 786, the Court of Appeal gave guidance on what “material
facts” are (at [21]):

… The difficulty here is in determining what facts are material. Any
definition of “materiality” has to be, by its very nature, general. In the
words of Ralph Gibson LJ in Brink’s-Mat Ltd v Elcombe [1988] 3 All ER 188
“material facts are those which it is material for the judge to know in
dealing with the application.” It need not be “decisive or conclusive” — per
Warren L H Khoo J in Poon Kng Siang v Tan Ah Keng [1991] 2 SLR(R) 621. We
would add that the duty to disclose applies not only to material facts known
to the applicant but also such additional facts which he would have known if
he had made proper inquiries. The extent of the inquiries which an applicant
should make would have to depend on the facts and circumstances prevailing in
the case.” [emphasis added]

84 I accept the Wife’s submissions and the Court Expert’s evidence on the
failure to provide the various documents of the companies that were required
for their valuation. Accordingly, I find that the Husband did not make full
and frank disclosure of material facts pertaining to the six companies which
would have affected their valuations. In dealing with the Husband’s lack of
full and frank disclosure, I found helpful the following comments of the High
Court in TYS v TYT [2017] 5 SLR 244:

45 As explained earlier, I decided to use the uplift approach to address the
adverse inference because it was not practicable to come to a finite sum for
the Husband’s non-disclosure. The cases adopting an uplift approach cover a
broad range of facts. In Au Kin Chung v Ho Kit Joo [2007] SGHC 150, the High
Court upheld the decision of the district judge who increased the wife’s share
from 50% to 70% on account of husband’s failure to give full and frank
disclosure of his assets (at [45]). In Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei [2011] 4
SLR 875, the wife was awarded a further 10% of the value of the disclosed
assets of $10.95m (at [52]). Therefore, the wife was awarded 30% of all the
remaining assets save for the matrimonial property, which was separately
divided. While the general uplift approach may be criticised as being
arbitrary since there is no objective value to which it may take reference
(AZZ v BAA at [120]), I considered that some degree of arbitrariness was
inevitable as adverse inferences were drawn precisely to deal with situations
of imperfect and incomplete information, and discarding the uplift approach
entirely may create a perverse incentive for parties to tactically craft non-
attributable non-disclosure. In the final analysis, much would depend on the
facts, and in determining the appropriate uplift, the court will be guided by,
inter alia, the evidence before it as to the extent of non-disclosure relative
to the value of the disclosed assets.

46 On the facts of this case, this was not an extraordinarily long marriage
nor was the asset pool extraordinarily large. If equal weightage was given to
both direct and indirect limbs, the final division ratio would be 55:45 in
favour of the Husband. In my judgment, two factors called for a more unusual
order in this case: (a) the adverse inference drawn against the Husband’s
financial position, and (b) the needs of the family.

85 I accept also the Husband’s arguments that the Wife did not sufficiently
explain or account for how she spent her retirement gratuities and the sale
proceeds of the shares. However, since I have returned the unaccounted sums to
the pool of matrimonial assets for division (see [26] and [28] above), no
further adverse inference needs to be drawn against the Wife for these two
groups of assets beyond the findings that I have made above. While I also do
not think her response that the money she received from the insurance policies
had gone into household expenses was adequate in explaining where this amount
went, 98

##### Foot Note 98

×

Exhibit P4 – Brief submissions on issues concerning retirement gratuity and
monies  
received from insurance policies.

I will only draw an adverse inference against the Wife for this group of
assets instead of returning them to the pool of matrimonial assets. This is
because they were not listed in the Joint Summary of Relevant Information, and
no substantive evidence was adduced or submissions made on them.

86 In light of the above, I will adjust the ratio at Step 3 between the Wife
and the Husband from 33:67 to 38:62 by increasing the percentage of the Wife’s
share by 5%. Applying the percentages to the total value of the assets of the
Parties of $21,239,423.02 (see [51] above), the Wife will receive
$8,070,980.75 and the Husband will receive $13,168,442.27.

Apportionment of the matrimonial assets

Approach – each to keep assets under their respective names – indicated
preferences to be followed where possible

87 The Wife did not indicate her position on whether Parties should keep the
assets which are presently in their names, save to state that she has no
objection to the Jalan J Property being sold and divided. 99

##### Foot Note 99

×

Notes of Argument dated 18 April 2018, p 4.

The Husband, however, submitted that:

(a) Parties keep assets that are in their own names;

(b) the Wife’s share of Jalan J Property to be transferred to him for no
consideration; and

(c) the Wife to be entitled to keep her share in Jalan B Property absolutely.

88 This is a sensible solution considering that it minimises transaction costs
that would otherwise reduce the current value of the pool of matrimonial
assets as a result of the apportionment. It also has the advantage of leaving
the Wife with a property in her name and a roof over her head. Accordingly, I
order that the Wife is to retain her interest in the Jalan B Property where
she is a joint tenant (which is valued at $2,100,000, being half of the
valuation of $4,200,000), and that she transfers her interest in the Jalan J
Property to the Husband. I further order that the Wife keeps the following
properties in her name which have a total value of $617,328.05:

Description| Amount ($)  
---|---  
POSB Account No ending with 7029| 304.27  
Honda car | 25,011.00  
AIA Life Endowment Special Policy No ending with 0209| 28,807.92  
POSB Savings Account No ending with 3798| 7,954.06  
UOB Savings Account No ending with 0772| 190.71  
Jewellery (Self-purchased)| 30,620.00  
CPF Medisave Account| 14,753.46  
POSB Savings Account No ending with 8107| 25.60  
AIA Dollars for Life (CPF MSS) Policy No ending with 7018| 30,402.92  
Jewellery given by Husband| 30,620.00  
Retirement Gratuities| 338,153.08  
Sale proceeds of shares| 110,485.03  
Total| 617,328.05  
  
89 I also order that the Husband keeps the properties that are in his name.
However, since the value of the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets is
$8,070,980.75 (see [86] above), the Husband will have to pay to the Wife from
the total pool of the matrimonial assets another sum of $5,353,652.70 (being
$8,070,980.75 - $2,100,000 - $617,328.05 (see [88] above)).

90 To complete the division of matrimonial assets, where assets have been
ascribed zero value or are not included in the list of matrimonial assets (see
[15] above), the party having possession will be allowed to retain them.

91 I will also give liberty to apply within 3 months of the date of this
judgment in the event that Parties require further directions on which assets
of the Husband are to be used to pay the Wife.

Maintenance

92 The Wife, who is in her early 70s, stated in the Joint Summary of Relevant
Information that she would like to have a lump sum maintenance of $240,000,
based on a multiplicand of $2,000 (which was what she is receiving as interim
maintenance) and a multiplier of 10 years. She did not provide any authorities
in support in her written submissions. Alternatively, the Wife suggested a
monthly maintenance of $3,000. 100

93 The Husband, who is in his late 70s, submitted that there should be no
maintenance for the Wife as she has a substantial share of the pool of
matrimonial assets after taking into consideration her retirement gratuities.

The Husband also submitted that maintenance for a former spouse is meant to be
supplemental in nature. 102

He added that the Wife has free medical benefits as a former civil servant,
while he has to pay for the medical expenses of his various health issues,
such as diabetes, heart problems, arthritis and other problems associated with
old age as he has no medical coverage. 103

94 The Court of Appeal in TNL v TNK provided the following guidance on the
ordering of maintenance for a wife:

61 The Husband’s position on appeal is that no maintenance should be awarded
to the Wife. On the other hand, the Wife, while accepting the monthly sum of
$3,000 as “reasonable”, contends that the multiplier should be 19 years
instead, giving a total sum of $684,000. The Wife’s basis for a 19-year
multiplier is this court’s decision in Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee [2012] 4
SLR 405, where we followed (at [89]) the method of quantifying an appropriate
multiplier for a lump sum maintenance award set out in our earlier decision in
Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau Poo [1993] 2 SLR(R) 545 (at [35]). This method
involves taking a compromise between the average life expectancy of a woman
and the usual retirement age of a Singapore male worker less the wife’s
present age, ie, [(average life expectancy of a woman + usual retirement age
of a Singapore male worker) ÷ 2] – the wife’s present age (“the Ong Chen Leng
method”).

62 Whilst not proposing to discard the Ong Chen Leng method altogether, we do
not think that the Ong Chen Leng method was intended by this court to be the
only method of quantifying the appropriate multiplier for a lump sum
maintenance award. In this regard, we agree with the Husband’s submission that
the Ong Chen Leng method is simply a guide rather than a rule of law.
Ultimately, the award of maintenance is a multi-factorial inquiry which,
pursuant to s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”),
requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case
including the following matters listed in s 114(1)(a) to (g) of the WC:

…..

63 Additionally, as noted by the Judge, the court’s power to order maintenance
is supplementary to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets (ATE v
ATD and another appeal [2016] SGCA 2 at [33]). Consequently, if, from the
division of matrimonial assets, there is a sum which, if invested properly,
would be sufficient to maintain the wife, the award of maintenance should be
no more than what is necessary to allow the wife to, in the words of the
Judge, “weather the transition of the divorce” (GD at [77]).

64 In the present case, we have held that the wife is entitled to an equal
share of the substantial pool of matrimonial assets. We note, too, that the
Husband supported the Wife up till mid-2015. Although the Judge was alive to
both these factors, we find her multiplier of five years to be on the generous
side. Accordingly, we order that the Husband pay the Wife a lump sum
maintenance of $100,000, which is approximately the sum obtained using a
multiplier of three years, which we consider to be more appropriate. The
Husband shall pay this sum on completion of the sale of the matrimonial home
or within nine months, whichever is earlier.

95 Considering the factors listed in s 114(1)(a) to (g) of the WC and the
guidance provided in TNL v TNK, I am not inclined to order any maintenance for
the Wife. The foremost consideration is that, as the Husband submitted, the
Court’s power to order maintenance is “supplementary” to its power to divide
matrimonial assets (ATE v ATD [2016] SGCA 2 (“ATE v ATD”) at [33]). The Court
of Appeal in ATE v ATD also emphasised at [31] that “the overarching principle
embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation, which requires the
wife to be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent,
commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage –
but … s 114(2) had to be applied in a “commonsense holistic manner that takes
into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of marriage”.

96 In the present case, it is key to note that the Wife will receive a
significant share of the large pool of matrimonial assets which includes
substantial liquid assets. As I pointed out at the start of my judgment, this
is a case which involves two septuagenarians. In the circumstances, the amount
of matrimonial assets awarded to the Wife should see her through her twilight
years, and a separate lump sum for maintenance will not be necessary. Nor
would an order for periodic maintenance be appropriate having regard to the
age of the Husband and his many health problems. Even though he is still
earning an income, it is not certain how much longer he will be able to
continue such payments.

97 I will hear Parties on costs.
