**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Judgment**

**

Background

**

1\. Protax Co-operative Society Limited (the plaintiffs) is a registered co-
operative society with over 400 Muslim taxi-drivers as members. They carried
on business previously at Nos. 357, 359 and 359A Bedok Road, Singapore (the
premises) and operated a coffee shop under the name of Protax Caf at Nos. 357
and 359 (1st storey units). Their office was at No 359A (the 2nd storey unit
above). The plaintiffs rented out a number of the food stalls in the coffee
shop including some spare rooms at the 2nd storey unit.

2\. By a deed of assignment made on 15 November 1998, the plaintiffs took over
a sublease from Mr Syed Ali Bin Syed Abdullah Sidek, who had leased the entire
premises from Mr Ng Tiong Kiat (the head lessee). Sometime in September 1999,
Mr Toh Teng Seng and Mr Sng Soon Heng (the defendants) purchased the said
premises subject to two existing head leases granted to the head lessee by the
former owners, Mr Lim Sing Kok and Mr Yong Kum Thong.

3\. In respect of the 1st storey units, the head lease dated 1 June 1997 was
for a period of 7 years expiring on 31 May 2004. The rental was $10,800 per
month payable in advance and due on the 1st day of the month.

4\. The head lease for the 2nd storey unit, dated 4 March 1998, was for a
period of 6 years and 5 months from 15 December 1997 to 14 May 2004. The rent
was $2,000 per month also payable in advance and would fall due on the 15th
day of each month.

**

Claim

**

5\. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants entered the premises on 15
February 2000 without their permission. The plaintiffs and various other
stallholders were told to leave the premises within 24 hours. On the following
day, the defendants changed the locks and locked the premises.

6\. The defendants then handed possession of the premises to their new
tenants, Mdm Fariday Awall Walter and Mr Amin Awall, who proceeded to carry
out renovations.

7\. The plaintiffs averred that the defendants had committed trespass. The
following damages were claimed:

> (a) Loss of rental from various stallholders at $15,300 per month from 16
> February 2000 to 31 July 2003;
>
> (b) Loss of profit from the plaintiffs drink stall;
>
> (c) Loss of profit from the plaintiffs chicken rice stall;
>
> (d) Loss of rental of 3 rooms at the 2nd storey unit;
>
> (e) Loss or removal of various chattels at the premises; and
>
> (f) Punitive or alternatively aggravated damages due to the mental distress
> and humiliation suffered by the plaintiffs representatives.

**

Defence and Reply

**

8\. The defendants relied on the fact that they had served a writ of
possession (DC Suit No. 5500/1999) on the head lessee for defaulting in
payment of his rent. The head lessee in his defence in the DC Suit admitted
the rent arrears and the defendants determination of the leases. The head
lessee further counterclaimed for a refund of his rental deposit. The
defendants regarded this as a wrongful repudiation on the part of the head
lessee but accepted that repudiation nevertheless. Accordingly, the defendants
re-entered the premises. To mitigate their loss, they re-let the premises to
new tenants.

9\. On 27 March 2000, about 6 weeks after the re-entry, the head lessee
obtained a grant of relief against forfeiture from the court. The defendants
appeal against that order was dismissed on 25 April 2000. Soon thereafter on 3
May 2000, the defendants returned the keys to the head lessee. There was no
undue delay.

10\. On these facts, Mr Harbajan Singh acting for the defendants, submitted
that there was no trespass. Until the head lessee obtained relief, the head
lessee had no status on the property. Mr Singh contended that the defendants
had acted throughout in good faith on their right to forfeit under the leases
for non-payment of rent, whereas the head lessee obtained relief against that
forfeiture not on a right he had, but on an exercise of the Courts discretion
based on equitable principles.

11\. In answer to that, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Andrew Ee, argued that
the defendants had waived their right to re-enter the premises by accepting
the outstanding rent, which was paid directly into defendants joint bank
account. Once that right was lost, the re-entry became unlawful and hence, the
defendants had committed trespass.

12\. Mr Ee submitted that the contemporaneous book entries recorded by the
defendants showed that the deposits of money by the head lessee into the
defendants joint account were accepted and treated by the defendants as
payment towards the rent on a first-in-first-out basis. For simplicity, I have
collated the particulars of the various payments in the table below:

Counsels submissions and the law

**

13\. Mr Ee conceded that if the head lease had been validly determined by
forfeiture, then the sublease, which depended on the head lease, would
automatically determine. He rightly acknowledged that there would be no
trespass if the re-entry took place after the head lease had been forfeited
unless that forfeiture was waived.

14\. On the facts, Mr Ee submitted that the defendants had waived their right
of re-entry and forfeiture by accepting all the outstanding rent due on the
1st storey units on 12 February 2000 (i.e. 3 days before the date of re-
entry).

15\. Mr Ee referred me to Sections 18 and 18A of the Conveyancing of Law and
Property Act (Cap. 61) in relation to the statutory restrictions on and relief
against forfeiture of leases. Mr Ee correctly pointed out that Section 18 was
not applicable to a re-entry or forfeiture due to non-payment of rent: see
Section 18(9). However, he said that Section 18A applies where the lessor is
proceeding by writ action to enforce a right of re-entry or forfeiture for
non-payment of rent. I observed however that Section 18A does not deal with
the central issues here, namely, when and how a right of re-entry and
forfeiture for non-payment of rent may lawfully be exercised. Neither does it
deal with the circumstances under which a wavier arises. These are governed by
the common law.

16\. As I will explain later, I found on the facts that the physical re-entry
was peaceably effected. The defendants regained possession of the premises.
The two head leases were lawfully forfeited for non-payment of rent. Although
the defendants succeeded in their self-help remedy of physical re-entry
without resorting to legal action, nevertheless the court can still grant
relief on equitable grounds by restoring possession to the head lessee and on
whatever terms it deems fit. However, it does not follow that a subsequent
grant of relief against forfeiture necessarily converts an earlier lawful re-
entry into a trespass.

17\. Mr Ee contended that a lease can only be forfeited after a judgment or
order for possession is obtained. Until such time that the landlord obtains an
order or judgment for possession, the tenants lease has not been forfeited. On
that basis, the re-entry was unlawful because no judgment or order for
possession was obtained by the defendants prior to the re-entry.

18\. I did not agree. In my judgment, the lessor may re-enter physically and
peaceably, provided that his right to re-enter and forfeit has arisen under
the terms of the lease and that right has not in the meantime been waived by
him, whether inadvertently or otherwise. Where the landlord manages to secure
actual possession without the assistance of the court, why must there always
be a supporting order or judgment for possession before the lease can be
forfeited? Regaining physical possession is clear proof of the landlords
intention and election to forfeit and end the tenancy, subject of course to
the courts discretion to grant equitable relief against the forfeiture.

19\. Similarly, service of the writ of possession on the tenant is an
unequivocal act amounting to a constructive re-entry and forfeiture. Mr Ees
proposition that a judgment for possession is a pre-requisite for a lawful re-
entry and forfeiture has no basis whatsoever in law.

20\. Before I delve into the application of the law to the unique facts of
this case, it is appropriate to examine the rather technical doctrine of re-
entry and waiver in the law of landlord and tenant. The Law Commission in
England in 1985 stated, quite justifiably, in para. 1.3 of its report, (1985)
Law Com. No. 142, that the present law, "_besides being unnecessarily
complicated, is no longer coherent and may give rise to injustice_ ". The Law
Commission examined the various deficiencies and recommended a replacement
with a new statutory scheme to simplify this area of the law. Be that as it
may, the common law in Singapore mirrors that in England in this area.

**_

(a) Doctrine of Waiver

_**

21\. Hill & Redmans Law of Landlord & Tenant 17th Edn succinctly summarises at
p 451 the law in relation to waiver of a right of forfeiture:

> Waiver of Forfeiture Rule 131
>
> (1) A right of re-entry may be waived either expressly or impliedly. There
> is an implied waiver where the lessor with knowledge of the cause of
> forfeiture does any act which recognises the continued existence of the
> tenancy.
>
> (2) An action for, demand for, or receipt of rent accrued due since the
> cause of forfeiture with knowledge by the lessor of that cause is an implied
> waiver.
>
> (3) Where there is a continuing breach of covenant a waiver does not extend
> to breaches continuing beyond the date of the acts which constitute the
> waiver.

22\. Good guidance in this area of the law can also be obtained from
paragraphs 509 and 510 at p 475 and 476 of Halsburys Laws of England 4th Edn
Reissue Vol 27 (1):

**

> 509\. Waiver of forfeiture

**. The landlord has the option whether to take advantage of a forfeiture or
not; and, if he elects not to do so, the forfeiture is waived. Such election
may be either express or implied, and it is implied when, after the cause of
forfeiture has come to his knowledge, the landlord does any act whereby he
recognises the relationship of landlord and tenant as still continuing. If,
however, it is shown that, with knowledge of the cause of forfeiture, the
landlord has recognised the tenancy, he will be precluded from saying that he
did not do the act with the intention of waiving the forfeiture. A landlord
does not waive the forfeiture by merely standing by and seeing it incurred,
as, for example, where the tenant makes alterations in breach of covenant and
the landlord does not interfere; there must be some positive act of waiver.
_There is no difference in principle in the rules governing waiver of the
right to forfeiture whether the breach is a failure to pay the rent or some
other breach of covenant._

> **
>
> 506\. What acts amount to waiver.
>
> **A subsisting tenancy is recognised, and, if the landlord has notice of the

>> **(i) by bringing an action for, or by the mere receipt of, rent which has

condition broken or under an express proviso for re-entry;

>>

>> (ii)

>>

>> (iii) .

> A demand made by the landlord or his agent with knowledge of the breach for

> is accepted, it is a question of fact whether it is tendered and accepted as

> of rent accrued due before the cause of forfeiture unless at the same time
> the landlord recognises the tenancy as subsisting, as, for example, where he
> describes the tenant as such in the receipt_**. (Emphasis is mine.)

23\. I have also extracted certain useful portions from "The Forfeiture of
Leases" by Mark Pawlowski (1993) at p 152 155:

> (1) An unambiguous demand for rent accruing due **_after_** the breach of
> covenant will constitute a waiver of forfeiture. .. Needless to say, the
> bringing of an action for rent accruing due after the breach will also
> amount to a waiver of the forfeiture: _Dendy v Nicholl_. Demand for rent
> qualified by such terms as "without prejudice" or "under protest" will
> operate as an effective waiver: _Segal Securities Ltd. v Thoseby_.
>
> (2) An acceptance of rent accruing due **_after_** the breach of covenant
> will constitute a waiver of forfeiture. .
>
> (3) A further point to bear in mind relates to the demand (or acceptance) of
> rent (a) in arrear and (b) in advance as regards continuing breaches of
> covenant. Demand (or acceptance) of rent payable in arrear will only amount
> to a waiver of the forfeiture for the period up to the date when the rent
> falls due and the landlord will not be precluded from taking advantage of
> the continuing breach after such date. On the other hand, a demand (or
> acceptance) of rent payable in advance will operate as a waiver of past and
> continuing breaches known to the landlord at the time of acceptance of the
> rent and for such period as the landlord knows they will continue. Footnote:
> But it, clearly, cannot constitute a waiver of future breaches of which the
> landlord has no advance knowledge.

24\. It would appear that waiver is entirely a matter of law and not of the
parties intention. The landlord thus could not, with knowledge of the event of
forfeiture, avoid a waiver of forfeiture by accepting or demanding rent
accruing due after that event by stipulating that the rent was accepted "under
protest" or "without prejudice". The fact that the landlord did not intend to
waive is irrelevant. As Parker J. said in _Matthews v Smallwood_(1910) 1 Ch
777 at p 786-787:

> If, knowing of the breach, he does distrain, or does receive the rent, then
> by law he waives the breach, and nothing which he can say by way of protest
> against the law will avail him anything.

25\. Mr Ee cited to me _Hong Cheok Lam v Ong Sing Mai and 4 others_ (1951) 17
MLJ 34. There the plaintiff rented out premises on a monthly tenancy to one Mr
Lim, who in breach of the terms of tenancy against subletting, had sublet
parts of the said premises to the 4 defendants. On 7 November 1949, the
plaintiffs solicitors wrote to Mr Lim, complaining of the subletting. On 2
December 1949, a notice to quit was served on Mr Lim. But prior to its
expiration, the plaintiff accepted rent accruing due **_after_** the date of
the complaint. When the subtenants refused to quit, the plaintiffs commenced
recovery proceedings against them, _inter alia_ , on the ground of the
prohibited subtenancy. It was held on appeal from the Civil District Court in
Singapore by Murray-Aynsley C.J. that acceptance of rent after knowledge of
the breach amounted to a waiver of the right of re-entry. The English position
in _Norman v Simpson_ (1946) K.B. 158 was followed.

26\. The Court of Appeal in Singapore in _Station Hotel Co v Malayan Railway
Administration_ [1993] 3 SLR 403 appeared to have accepted that the English
principles on waiver of forfeiture on acceptance of rent after knowledge of
breach would similarly apply in Singapore for contractual tenancies of non-
rent controlled premises, although they have no application in relation to a
breach of the provisions of the Control of Rent Act in respect of rent-
controlled premises.

27\. There is clear authority in Singapore that an actual receipt of rent
prior or subsequent to the forfeiture, which rent accrued due before the cause
of forfeiture, will not amount to a waiver. For it to operate as a waiver, the
receipt must be of rent accruing due after the cause of forfeiture has arisen.
Worley J. in _Low Bee Hoe (w) v Morsalim Chin_ (1947) MLJ 3, an appeal from
the Civil District Court in Singapore, had this to say:

> I do not know of any authority for the proposition that acceptance, after
> expiry of notice to quit, of rent accrued due for a period not going beyond
> the date of expiration of the notice can be a waiver of that notice and I
> cannot find any authority for it in the cases to which I was referred. The
> case most in point is _Price v Worwood_ (1859) 28 L.J. 329 where Baron
> Martin said "**_a receipt of rent to operate as a waiver of forfeiture must
> be a receipt of rent which was become due after the forfeiture was incurred
> and the mere receipt of the money afterwards the rent having become due
> previously is of no consequence and for the very plain reason that the entry
> for a condition broken does not at all affect the right to receive payment
> of a pre-existing debt." In my view this reasoning applies equally to
> receipt of rent accrued due prior to the expiry of a notice to quit._**
> (Emphasis mine.)
>
> .
>
> As pointed out in _Davies v. Bristow_ (1920) 3 K.B. 428, the notice having
> expired, the landlord can no more waive it than he can waive the effluxion
> of time: the contractual relationship between the parties is ended but,
> whereas at common law if there is no fresh agreement between them, (which
> may if necessary be inferred from the acceptance of rent) the **_former
> tenant becomes a trespasser_** ,

28\. In _Price v Worwood_ (1859) 4 H & N 512, the plaintiff brought an action
to recover possession of three houses on account of the tenants failure to
insure. However, the plaintiff received rent from the undertenants of the
premises the day before he took out the writ. Channell B. held that the
plaintiff must show that **as of the date of writ** he has the right to enter
the premises before he can succeed in his action of ejectment. He must show
that the premises had remained uninsured **as at the date of writ** and under
circumstances that would entitle him to take advantage of the forfeiture. He
found that there was a continuing breach between date of payment of rent and
the time the action was brought. Martin B. further added that _there would be
a good right to maintain the ejectment, for the non-insurance is a continuing
breach, and its continuance during the period between the time of the payment
of the rent on the 23 December and the commencement of the suit on the 24 th
is sufficient for the purpose of entitling the plaintiff to his verdict._

**_

(b) Continuing Breach

_**

29\. The Court of Appeal in England dealt with another case of continuing
breach in _Penton v Barnett_ [1898] 1 QB 376. The headnote reads as follows:

> A lease contained a general covenant to repair and a covenant to repair
> within three months after notice. The premises being out of repair, the
> lessor gave notice to the lessee under the Conveyancing Act, 1881, to repair
> within a given time. Three days after the expiration of the notice a
> quarters rent became due. No repairs having been done by the tenant, the
> lessor brought an action to recover possession, and in the action claimed
> the quarters rent:-
>
> Held, that, the breach of covenant being a continuing one, no new notice was
> required in respect of the non-repair after the expiration of the time
> specified in the notice, and that the claim for rent did not affect the
> right to possession in respect of non-repair after the date when the rent
> fell due.

30\. In _Pentons_ case, A.L. Smith L.J. accepted the proposition that the
claim for rent up to 25 December 1896 was at most an election to treat the
defendant as a tenant up to that date. But inasmuch as between that date and
14 January 1897, being the date the writ of possession was issued, the
premises had remained in the same state of disrepair, there was a breach of
covenant between those dates in respect of which the plaintiff could maintain
his action for possession. Ribgy L.J. said that the landlord had a power of
re-entry so long as there was a broken covenant and a continuing breach. As
nothing was done since the notice to repair, the position on 14 January 1897
would be that the plaintiff had the right to determine the tenancy by the
issue of the writ, and to sue in respect of such rights as had accrued to him
during the tenancy.

31\. The court in _Doe. Dem. Ambler v Boodbridge_ (1829) 9 B&C 377 held that
the use of rooms in a manner prohibited by the lease was a continuing breach,
and that the landlord was not, by receiving rent, precluded from taking
advantage of the forfeiture because the continued use after receipt of rent
was a new breach of covenant every day during the time that they were so used.

32\. In _Doe v Jones_ (1850) 5 Exch 498, the judges had this to say:

> Pollock CB: Where reasonable time for repair given in the notice was still
> running, there was no breach to waive as opposed to a case of breach before
> receipt of rent, where the acceptance of rent is a waiver of the forfeiture
> actually incurred.
>
> Alderson B: The receipt of rent is a waiver of all forfeitures, which are,
> so to speak, single and complete, and are not in the nature of continuing
> forfeitures. So with respect to continuing forfeitures, where the lessee is
> bound from time to time to keep the premises in repair, and he omits for an
> unreasonable time, but afterwards repairs them, there the receipt of rent
> waives the previous forfeiture. But where the matter is plainly a continuing
> breach, the only question is, whether, when the party seeks to re-enter, the
> premises have been an unreasonable time out of repair and so continue.
>
> Rolfe, B: I am of the same opinion. If, instead of "a reasonable time," the
> lease had named five days, within which the lessee was to repair, there
> could have been no difficulty, because the 5 days had elapsed on 25 March
> 1847: the receipt of rent would have been a waiver of the actual breach, but
> it would have been no waiver of a neglect to repair between the 21st and
> 25th, for then there was no complete breach.
>
> Platt B: It is a fallacy to say that the receipt of rent was a waiver of the
> breach of contract to repair, for it was a continuing breach, and until the
> repairs were perfected, the lessors of the plaintiff were entitled to re-
> enter for the forfeiture.

33\. The Court of Appeal in _Downie v Turner_ [1951] All ER 416 took the view
however that subletting in breach of the covenant was not a continuing or
recurring breach. It was a once and for all breach taking place at the time
the subletting first took place in February 1946. After knowing of the
subletting, the landlord continued however to accept rent until 13 February
1950\. In April 1950, the landlord served a notice of forfeiture. The landlord
was held to have waived that subletting because he had, with knowledge of it,
accepted rent subsequent to the date of the breach.

34\. In _Farimani v Gates_ [1984] 2 EGLR 66, the Court of Appeal explained the
difference between a recurring breach and a single breach in the following
terms:

> If an obligation is to perform an act by a given time, once that time has
> elapsed and the act has not been performed, there is a breach of a single
> obligation and not of a continuing one. The fact that it still lies within
> the power of the lessee to perform the act cannot affect the nature of his
> obligation. In this field of law a reference to a continuing breach is a way
> of referring to breaches of a continuing obligation and does not refer to
> the ability to remedy a single breach. There is no difference between an
> obligation to perform an act by a given date and an obligation to perform an
> act within a reasonable time. If the tenant fails to perform the act within
> a reasonable time he has broken his obligation, which is a single and not a
> continuing obligation: see _Re King_ [1963] 1 Ch 459, CA, in which Lord
> Denning MR said at p 478:
>

>> Let me next take the covenant to reinstate. Suppose the premises are
damaged by fire. The lessee does not reinstate within a reasonable time. The
breach is over once and for all, but its effect continues.

35\. With guidance from the authorities above, I therefore hold that just as
with the general covenant to repair, the obligation to pay rent on the due
date each month throughout the entire duration of the lease is a continuing
obligation. It gives rise to a continuing right of re-entry and a continually
recurring cause of forfeiture should the obligation to pay rent be breached.
If the rent is not paid by the grace period stipulated, each day thereafter
that the accumulated rent or part thereof remains unpaid must be treated as a
fresh breach of obligation, entitling the landlord to exercise his right of
re-entry as provided in the lease. As the rent accrues daily, a failure to pay
rent on the due date cannot be regarded as a once and for all breach. It is
different from a breach by way of subletting, where the breach (i.e. the act
of subletting) is regarded as a once and for all breach of covenant taking
place at the time the sublessee was first let into the premises.

**_

(c) Service of writ of possession

_**

36\. Upon service of a writ of possession or after a physical re-entry, the
right of re-entry ceases to be capable of waiver. It has been consummated.
Thus, acceptance of rent or levying distress after service of a writ of
possession cannot be regarded as conduct amounting to a waiver.

37\. In _Grimwood v Moss_ (1871) L.R. 7 C.P. 360, it was held that the
landlords distress for rent after the date of service of proceedings for
possession was not conduct amounting to a waiver.

38\. In _Civil Service Co-operative Society v Mc Grigors Trustee_ [1923] 2 Ch
347, the defendant lessees relied on a demand for, payment and acceptance of,
rent by the plaintiff landlords as a waiver since action brought of the causes
of forfeiture, namely, a breach of covenant against assignment or otherwise
parting with the demised premises and the bankruptcy of the lessees. The
demand for rent was made with knowledge of the bankruptcy and was for rent
accrued in part before the bankruptcy, in part between the bankruptcy and the
writ, and in part subsequent to the writ. The plaintiffs claimed in the writ
that they were entitled to recover possession of the premises as on a
forfeiture of the lease, delivery up of possession and mesne profits. On the
question whether the demand for rent operated as a waiver of the forfeiture,
Russell J., answered in the negative and held that the plaintiffs were
entitled to recover possession on the ground of the tenants bankruptcy. In the
course of his judgment, Russell J. referred to _Dendy v Nicholl_ [1893] 2 Ch.
271, as a case where the landlord, with knowledge of an underletting in breach
of covenant, had sued the tenant for arrears of rent accruing subsequent to
the underletting, and obtained payment. After the issue of the writ for rent,
but before actual payment of the amount claimed, the landlord commenced an
ejectment action based on non-payment of rent and the underletting. Although
the court there held that the bringing of the action for rent, and acceptance
of the rent was a waiver of the right of re-entry, which waiver occurred
before the ejectment brought, Russel J. did not think that the court touched
on the real question namely, whether the issue and service of a writ in
ejectment was such a final election by the landlord to determine the tenancy
that a subsequent receipt of rent was no waiver of the forfeiture. He then
said:

> In my opinion the authorities establish that this is so. In _Jones v.
> Carter_ 15 M. & W. 718, Parke B. held that after ejectment brought, there
> being no evidence of actual re-entry by the landlord, the landlord could not
> sue for rent; and he cites with approval a decision of Lord Tenterden that
> the receipt of rent after ejectment brought for a forfeiture was no waiver
> of such forfeiture: _Doe v. Meux_ (1824) 1 C. & P. 346. To the same effect
> is the case of _Grimwood v Moss_ L.R. 7 C.P. 360, where it is definitely
> stated that the bringing of an ejectment action is an irrevocable election
> to determine the tenancy: see also _Rex v. Paulson_ [1921] 1 A.C. 271; and
> _Evans v. Enever_ [1920] 2 K.B. 315. I adopt the words of Lord Coleridge J.
> in _Evans v. Enever_ where he says at p 320: "**_There is a series of cases
> which establish that if an action is brought for recovery of possession for
> breaches of covenants in the lease that is an irrevocable election to
> determine the lease, and that no subsequent acts of the plaintiff can be
> relied on as qualifying that position."_** (Emphasis is mine.)

39\. After an analysis of the various authorities, Sachs J in _Segal
Securities, Ltd. v Thoseby_ [1963] 1 All E.R. 500 said:

> Clearly, [a demand for or acceptance of rent payable in advance] cannot be a
> waiver of future breaches of which the landlord has no advance knowledge;.
> Equally clearly, an acceptance of rent in advance does waive a non-
> continuing breach in the past: such a waiver applies both to the past and to
> the period covered by the rent. As regards continuing breaches, it seems to
> me that in the absence of express agreement, the acceptance of rent in
> advance can, at highest, only waive those breaches that are at the time of
> demand known to be continuing, and to waive them for such period as it is
> definitely known that they will continue.

40\. In short, a demand or acceptance of rent due before a breach of covenant
does not _per se_ constitute a waiver. Neither does demanding nor accepting
rent after a re-entry and forfeiture waive the forfeiture that has taken place
because an irrevocable election to determine the lease has already been made.
Thus, any acts of the lessor subsequent to a constructive re-entry and
forfeiture by the issue and service of a writ of possession, or subsequent to
an actual peaceable re-entry, will not be capable of waiving the forfeiture.
However, if there is no writ issued, or no physical or constructive re-entry
as yet, a demand or acceptance of rent accrued due after the date of the
breach of covenant or the date on which the right of forfeiture arises will
constitute a waiver irrespective of whether the demand or acceptance of the
rent is on a without prejudice basis. This applies just as well to a breach
arising from non-payment of rent.

**_

(d) Dispensation with notice of formal demand

_**

41\. The words whether formally demanded or not often appear in forfeiture
provisions for non-payment of rent because forfeiture cannot be obtained at
common law, unless there is a formal demand for rent. For this reason, leases
often expressly dispense with the need for a formal demand.

42\. Since the common law requires a formal demand before forfeiture can be
effective, it necessarily means that a demand for rental arrears accumulated
prior to the cause of forfeiture itself cannot amount to a waiver of the
forfeiture. Otherwise, it would be defeating the very objective (i.e the
forfeiture) that is sought. To constitute a waiver of forfeiture, the demand
for rent must necessarily be for rent accruing due after the cause of
forfeiture has arisen. Therefore, demands for rent accruing due before the
cause of forfeiture cannot have the effect of waiving the forfeiture.

43\. What also seems clear after a review of the authorities is that where it
is a new breach surfacing or an existing breach continuing after the act of
waiver, then a fresh right of re-entry and forfeiture flowing from that breach
will arise. A waiver operates only in respect of those breaches antedating the
landlords act of waiver.

**_

(e) Forcible entry

_**

44\. A landlord entitled to possession of land may enter forcibly and yet the
tenant may have no civil remedy against him for that entry although he is
liable to criminal proceedings: Hill & Redmans Law of Landlord and Tenant 17th
Edn at p 521. In _Blades v Higgs_ (1861) 10 CBNS 713, Erle C.J. delivering the
judgment of the court said:

> It has been decided that the owner of land entitled to the possession may
> enter thereon and use force sufficient to remove a wrong-doer therefrom. In
> respect of land, as well as chattels, the wrong-doers have argued that they
> ought to be allowed to keep what they are wrongfully holding, and that the
> owner cannot use force to defend his property, but must bring his action,
> lest the peace should be endangered if force was justified: see _Newton v.
> Harland_ , 1 M. & G. 644, 1 Scott, N. R. 474. But, in respect of land, that
> argument has been overruled in _Harvey v. Brydges_ , 14 M.& W. 442. Parke,
> B., says: "Where a breach of the peace is committed by a freeholder, who, in

Events leading to the re-entry and re-possession

**

45\. On 30 November 1999, the defendants, through their solicitors Jing Quee &
Chin Joo, sent a letter of demand for payment **_by 6 December 1999_** of the
outstanding November 1999 rent (amounting to $10,800) in respect of the 1st
storey units. Another letter of demand dated the same day was issued for the
arrears of rent also for November 1999 (amounting to $2,000) in respect of the
2nd storey unit. Both letters to the head lessee clearly stated that in the
event of non-payment, the defendants would commence legal action to recover
the arrears of rent without prejudice to their rights to re-enter and take
possession of the premises pursuant to Clause 4 (a) of the respective tenancy
agreements. Each letter further demanded payment of the costs and
disbursements incurred to date of $51.50 cts.

46\. Clause 4(a) of the head lease for the 1st storey units states:

> 4\. Provided always and it is hereby agreed:
>

>> (a) That if any part of any rent hereby reserved shall at any time be
arrear for twenty-one days (**_whether formally demanded or not_**) or if the
tenant shall neglect to observe any stipulation on his part herein contained
or .. the landlord **_may at any time hereafter re-enter upon the demised
premises_** and **_thereupon this demise shall absolutely determine_** ;
(Emphasis is mine.)

47\. Clause 4(a) of the head lease for the 2nd storey unit was in similar
terms as follows:

> 4\. PROVIDED ALWAYS and it is hereby agreed as follows:
>

>> (a) If the rent hereby reserved or any part thereof shall be unpaid for
fourteen (14) days after becoming payable (**_whether formally demanded or
not_**) ... then** _... it shall be lawful for the Landlord at any time
thereafter to re-enter upon the premises_** or any part thereof in the name of
the whole and **_thereupon this tenancy shall absolutely determine_** but
**_without prejudice to the right of action of the Landlord in respect of any
antecedent breach_** of this Agreement by the Tenant. (Emphasis is mine.)

48\. Clearly, they must be construed as forfeiture clauses, where the right of
forfeiture accrues only after the grace period has elapsed and the overdue
rent remains unpaid. The right then becomes exercisable at the option of the
landlord by a re-entry into the premises. That re-entry may be effected either
by a peaceable physical re-entry, or by issuing and serving a writ of
possession which amounts to a constructive re-entry in law. But I would not go
so far to construe the above provisions as giving a right to the landlord to
terminate the leases absolutely (as opposed to a mere right to forfeit) so as
to deny the tenant his access to relief against forfeiture altogether. Should
a demand for rent be made during the grace period, it will not amount to a
waiver because it remains a demand before the right of forfeiture has arisen.
There is nothing to waive as yet.

49\. The requirement of a formal demand by the common law before the landlord
can forfeit for non-payment of rent has been dispensed with in this case by
agreement of the parties with the insertion of the words "_whether formally
demanded or not_ " into the proviso for re-entry under clause 4(a) in both
leases. The landlord may thus re-enter and forfeit the lease without any prior
demand in the event of a breach of this clause for non-payment of rent.

50\. When the head lessee failed to pay by the date stipulated in the letters
of demand (i.e. 6 December 1999), the defendants filed a writ of summons (DC
Suit No 5500 of 1999) on 13 December 1999, wherein they claimed that by reason
of the head lessees failure to pay the rent both for November and December
1999, they had acquired and were exercising their right to forfeit the
respective tenancies, and thus, they were entitled to possession of the
premises. They then prayed, _inter alia_ , for immediate delivery of
possession, payment of rental arrears and mesne profits until delivery of
vacant possession. There was nothing in the writ claiming any relief
inconsistent with an unequivocal demand for possession or any relief
consistent with a continuation of the lease. Clearly, by the time the writ was
filed, a valid cause of re-entry and forfeiture had arisen because the grace
periods for payment of the November 1999 rent in respect of both head leases
had expired.

51\. But before the writ was served, the head lessee banked $10,800 directly
into the defendants joint bank account No. 014-21970-6 with DBS on 18 December
1999 following the previous agreed mode of payment by direct cheque deposits.
Although this covered the rent for November 1999, it left unpaid the overdue
December 1999 rent for the 1st storey units. Neither were the November and
December 1999 rents for the 2nd storey unit paid.

52 _._ For the period between the issue and service of the writ, May J. in
_Richards v De Freitas_(1974) 29 P & CR 1 adopted the view that there is no
_locus poenitentiae_ (i.e. opportunity of repentance). Thus acceptance of the
rent during this period would not prejudice the landlord or amount to a waiver
of the cause of forfeiture, which had accrued prior to and on which the issue
of the writ of possession was based _._ As such, acceptance of the $10,800
payment in respect of the November 1999 rent for the 1st storey units did not
waive the right of forfeiture claimed in the writ, which was pending service
on the head lessee.

53\. Since the breach of the rent clause must be regarded as a continuing
breach, the cause of forfeiture under clause 4 (a) would naturally be
recurring continually. Even if the late payment and acceptance of the November
1999 rent in respect of the 1st storey units could waive the defendants right
to forfeit on account of the head lessees failure to pay the November 1999
rent by 21 November 1999, nevertheless it could not in my judgment constitute
in law a waiver of the fresh breaches involving the non-payment of the next
months rent for the 1st and 2nd storey units. The right to forfeit in respect
of these fresh breaches for non-payment of the December 1999 rent eventually
crystallised on 21 December 1999 for the 1st storey units and on 29 December
1999 for the 2nd storey unit after the respective grace periods expired. The
crystallisation arose subsequent to the date (i.e. 18 December 1999) on which
the head lessee banked in the sum of $10,800 for the November 1999 rent for
the 1st storey units. Hence, any acceptance by the defendants of this sum,
whether as rent, damages or otherwise, could never constitute a waiver of
these fresh breaches that followed. In my view, the defendants here were fully
entitled to take advantage of any subsequent fresh breaches or continuation of
a breach: Paragraph 511 Vol 27(1) Halsburys Law of England (4th Edition
Reissue) at p 478; _Penton v Barnett_ [1898] 1 QB 276; _New River Co v
Crumpton_ [1917] 1 KB 762.

54\. As a result of that incomplete settlement of the overdue rent, the
defendants solicitors wrote a letter dated 22 December 1999 to the head lessee
stating that the $10,800 received had been applied towards payment of arrears
of rent accumulated before December 1999 on the basis of the principle of
first-in-first-out. The defendants solicitors notified the head lessee in no
uncertain terms that acceptance of this payment and any subsequent payment was
to be without prejudice to their clients rights accrued to date, including
their right to determine the tenancy and recover possession of the premises
together with all costs and expenses arising therefrom. In particular, their
acceptance of payment was not to prejudice their clients rights in DC Suit No
5500 of 1999, which they had commenced against the head lessee. The defendants
solicitors were right to take advantage of the principle of no _locus
poenitentiae_ between the issue of the writ and its pending service. I noted
that the head lessee already had prior notice that if they did not pay up the
November 1999 rent arrears by 6 December 1999, the defendants would commence
action. If the head lessee did not take that seriously, he had only himself to
blame.

55\. The defendants solicitors then enquired from the head lessee if he had
appointed solicitors to accept service of the writ or was prepared to accept
service at the office of the defendants solicitors. No reply was received. By
this letter, the head lessee should be aware that the defendants had commenced
action to recover possession, although the writ had not been formally served
on him. To be effective in law to bring about a notional re-entry and an
effective forfeiture of the lease, the lessor must serve the writ of
possession on the tenant to signify his intention to treat the lease as at an
end.

56\. In the meantime, the head lessee quickly deposited a further sum of $2000
on 3 January 2000 directly into the defendants joint bank account to cover the
long outstanding November 1999 rent, this time for the 2nd storey unit. As
explained earlier, there is no _locus poenitentiae_ between the issue and
service of the writ entitling a lessee to tender the rent and avoid
forfeiture. In _Richards v De Freitas_ (1974) 29 P & CR 1), May J. took the
view, though it was _obiter dictum_ , that even if there was acceptance of
payment of the rent between the date of issue of the writ and its service, the
position of the landlord would not be prejudiced as against his tenant. On the
facts of that case, he could not see any suggestion that the acceptance would
have been with any intention of creating a new tenancy in anyone. There could
be no possible waiver of any forfeiture if the alleged ground of forfeiture
was the failure to pay rent within the stipulated 21 days.

57\. **_On 21 January 2000, the defendants solicitors effected substituted
service of the writ on the head lessee_** by pasting a copy of the writ and
order of substituted service on the front door of No 359A and on the notice
board of the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs, having their office then at No
359A, should have been fully aware of this writ, and hence, of their head
lessees failure to pay rent to his landlord.

58\. As on the date of service of the writ (i.e. 21 January 2000), the grace
periods for payment of the December 2000 rents for the 1st storey and 2nd
storey units had long expired without any payment forthcoming from the head
lessee. The defendants were no doubt entitled under clause 4 (a) of the
respective leases, to re-enter the premises at any time on account of these
fresh and continuing breaches (as a further ground) to determine the leases.
As stipulated in both leases, no formal demand for rent was necessary as a
pre-requisite for re-entry and forfeiture.

59\. By this act of serving the writ, the defendants finally conveyed to the
head lessee (and for that matter his underlessees too) their unequivocal
demand for immediate recovery of possession pursuant to their right under the
leases. It was an unqualified and conclusive election to determine both
leases. In serving the writ, they had in law notionally re-entered the
premises and exercised their right to forfeit the two leases. As stated in
_Canas Property Co Ltd v K L Television Services Ltd_ [1970] 2 All ER 795
(C.A.), the landlord must not only issue, but also **_serve_** the writ of
possession on the tenant, if he wants to effect forfeiture for breach of a
covenant in a lease by way of a notional physical re-entry. I could see no
reason why the defendants should be precluded from suing for the rent accrued
due prior to the date of the notional re-entry and forfeiture on 21 January
2000. Since the rent was payable in advance and not in arrear, all rents
accrued due including the monthly rent falling due on 1 January 2000 could be
claimed as arrears of rent, without any danger arising from a waiver of the
right of re-entry or forfeiture. Had it been rent payable in arrear, then the
rent could only be claimed up to 21 January 2000 and thereafter, it would have
to be claimed as mesne profits until delivery up of possession. Where the head
lessee continues to remain in possession, he must be held liable for mesne
profits, which are technically damages for trespass.

60\. A judgment for possession, if obtained, would of course finally terminate
the lease, and that termination would then relate back to the date of
forfeiture. If the landlord had thereafter re-entered pursuant to that
judgment for possession, relief against forfeiture would no longer be
possible. But in this case, the landlord physically re-entered **_before_**
obtaining judgment for possession. Hence, the court had the power subsequently
to grant the tenant relief against forfeiture upon the head lessees
application. But that relief subsequently granted could not retrospectively
turn the defendants in legal possession into trespassers, which apparently was
what Mr Ee had been precipitously hanging his clients case on.

61\. I found Paragraph 508 at p 473 of Vol 27(1) Halsburys Laws of England
(4th Edition Reissue) to be enlightening. It states:

> **
>
> 508\. What amounts to re-entry.
>
> ** The terms of a proviso for re-entry require that, if the landlord elects
> to determine the lease for a forfeiture, he must do so by re-entry, which
> the landlord may effect by physically entering upon the premises with the
> intention of determining the tenancy or _by the issue and service of
> proceedings for recovery of possession of the premises_. In the case of
> forfeiture for non-payment of rent the landlord must first make formal
> demand for payment, unless this requirement is dispensed with by suitable
> words in the proviso, or by statute. Usually the formal demand is expressly
> dispensed with by inserting the words, whether formally demanded or not,  **
>
> **_Actual entry is not necessary in order to take advantage of the
> forfeiture._ When the cause of forfeiture is complete, the landlord may
> bring an action to recover possession, and _the bringing of the action is
> equivalent to actual entry_. _If the writ contains an unequivocal demand for
> possession, the service of the writ operates as a final election to
> determine the term, whether judgment is obtained or not_. (Emphasis is
> mine.)

62\. In _Billson v Residential Apartments Ltd._ [1992] 2 W.L.R. 15 (H.L.),
Lord Templeman pointed out that:

> In order to exercise his option to determine the lease the landlord must
> either re-enter the premises in conformity with the proviso or must issue
> and serve a writ claiming possession. The bringing of an action to recover
> possession is equivalent to an entry for the forfeiture.

63\. Concluding on this point, the defendants had notionally re-entered and
forfeited the leases by serving the writ of possession on 21 January 2000
pursuant to their right of re-entry and forfeiture under the respective
leases. Being a valid constructive re-entry and forfeiture, the defendants
would not in law be liable to any trespass on his own premises, should he
follow up with a peaceable physical re-entry to re-gain possession.

Effect of Pleadings in DC Suit No 550 of 1999

> > > **_

64\. Other subsequent events fortified the defendants defence here. Without
paying the December 1999 and January 2000 arrears of rent, the head lessee,
through his solicitors Andrew Ee & Co., filed and served a defence on 3
February 2000 in DC Suit No 5500 of 1999, admitting the rental arrears. The
head lessee said that he intended to settle the arrears promptly and would
seek relief from forfeiture. This was no more than a mere statement of a
future course of action intended by him rather than a specific legal or
equitable defence as such. In fact, the head lessee implicitly recognised in
his defence that the lease had been forfeited. Otherwise, why should he seek
relief from forfeiture? It must be pointed out that by now (i.e. 3 February
2000), the grace periods had expired not only for the December 1999 but also
for the outstanding January 2000 rental for the premises under the two head
leases.

65\. What was more significant was that the head lessee had on the advice of
his solicitors, counterclaimed for the return of his deposit of $32,400 being
the equivalent of 3 months rental, and averred in unambiguous terms that the
leases had been determined. Paragraph 9 of the head lessees defence, which I
regarded as fatal to the plaintiffs case, was as follows:

> 9\. The said **_Deposit should be refunded_** to the Defendant [i.e. head
> lessee] upon the determination of the said [Lease] Agreements, which
> **_determination has taken place upon the issue of the Plaintiffs Writ_**
> [i.e. Writ of Mr Toh Teng Seng and Mr Sng Soon Heng] in this present action.
> (Emphasis is mine.)

66\. Either this amounted to a repudiatory breach in the form of a repudiatory
termination of the two leases by the head lessee, which the defendants were
shown later to have accepted, or it was an express acceptance by the head
lessee of the determination of the leases by the defendants upon the issue of
their writ of possession. Stephen Sedley J. in _Hussein v Mehlman_ [1992] 2
EGLR 87 was of the view that the doctrine of repudiation applied to tenancies.
See also _Chartered Trust plc v Davies_ [1997] 2 EGLR 83 and _Nyehead
Developments Ltd v RH Fibreboard Containers Ltd_ [1999] 2 EG 139.

67\. Subject to any relevant statutory provisions on relief against forfeiture
and to the general law of forfeiture applicable to tenancies, I would hold
that this repudiatory determination of the leases by the head lessee was
capable of being accepted by the landlord resulting in a premature
determination of the leases, and in effect a forfeiture, but this should not
prejudice the right of the tenants to apply for relief against the forfeiture
nevertheless. It would be wrong I think to allow this common law doctrine of
repudiation to circumvent the protection or relief otherwise available to
tenants against forfeiture of their leases.

68\. In my view, the head lessee had no basis to seek a refund of his deposit
unless he also considered the leases as having been determined by the act of
the defendants in issuing the writ for, _inter alia_ , recovery of possession,
which determination the head lessee must in turn have agreed to by filing his
counterclaim in the terms he did. His unequivocal demand for an early refund
of his rental deposit necessarily evinced his intention to bring the leases to
a premature end. These new circumstances distinguished this case and set it
apart from the authorities cited by the plaintiffs in support of their
argument on waiver of forfeiture.

69\. Based on this defence as filed, I concluded that the defendants and the
head lessee had, through this unexpected turn of events, unequivocally come to
an agreement to treat the two tenancies as forfeited as of 3 February 2000,
the date on which the head lessees defence was served on the defendants. It
must follow that a subsequent peaceable physical re-entry into the premises by
the defendants, as the owners, to re-gain possession under these circumstances
would never amount to a trespass against the head lessee, or his undertenants
for that matter, namely, the plaintiffs in this case, who could have no better
right than the head lessee in this respect. Needless to say, the rights of the
plaintiffs here as the subtenants, would be destroyed once the head lessees
lease was lawfully forfeited, though of course, the plaintiffs might later
apply to the court themselves for relief from such forfeiture.

70\. Moreover, I did not think it conscionable that the defendants should be
regarded as trespassers and be made to pay damages when they had in the first
place acted _bona fide_ in the belief that the head lessee had himself adopted
the position that the two tenancies were terminated, and the defendants
therefore peaceably re-entered the premises to regain possession, and found
new tenants to lease the premises thereafter.

71\. For the reasons given, the plaintiffs claim must be dismissed. In fact,
once the head lease had been lawfully forfeited, the undertenants must
themselves be regarded as trespassers in relation to the landlord and not the
other way round. It would be preposterous to allow these trespassing
undertenants to claim damages for trespass against the landlord.

72\. It would be worthwhile reiterating at this juncture that the fact that a
tenant could subsequently apply for relief against forfeiture did not mean
that the earlier lawful re-entry pursuant to a forfeiture clause for the
failure to pay rent would _per se_ constitute a trespass. The landlord could
validly hold on to the re-possessed premises until the court subsequently
intervenes by granting relief against the forfeiture of the lease, whereupon
the landlord will have to surrender possession of the premises to the tenant.
But until the tenant succeeds in obtaining such an order for relief, it will
be the landlord (as opposed to the tenant) who has the right to immediate and
continued possession of the premises. Just as the landlord cannot possibly
claim rent for that interim period whilst he is in occupation prior to
surrendering possession to the evicted tenant in conformance with the court
order granting relief, neither can the evicted tenant claim damages for
trespass because (a) the landlord has gained lawful possession following a
lawful re-entry under the terms of the lease, and (b) the tenant is no longer
under an obligation to pay rent for which the _quid pro quo_ of peaceable
enjoyment of the demised premises during that interim period without any
interruption from the landlord no longer exists.

73\. In summary therefore, where an order for relief against forfeiture is
granted before physical re-entry, the landlord will not be entitled to re-
enter. But where the order for relief is obtained after a lawful physical re-
entry done peaceably, as in this case, the landlord cannot be said to have
trespassed during the interim period when he remains in possession prior to
the granting of the relief by the court.

74\. In the reply and defence to the counterclaim in DC Suit No 5500 of 1999,
filed and served on 11 February 2000, Mr Toh Teng Seng and Mr Sng Soon Heng
(the defendants here) made clear to the head lessee that they were compelled
to issue proceedings to recover possession of the premises due to the non-
payment of rent by him as the head lessee. Damages were claimed for loss of
rent suffered for the remainder of the term from the date on which possession
was recovered.

75\. In their reply, the defendants did not dispute paragraph 9 of the defence
of the head lessee (which asserted that the leases were determined upon issue
of the writ). **Effectively, the defendants had on 11 February 2000 in their
reply accepted the legal and factual position adopted by the head lessee**.
The defendants only contended in a very limited way that the refund of the
full deposit was misconceived, or alternatively, that it was premature, since
the cost of making good any damage to the premises found after recovery of
possession would have to be deducted from that deposit. Clearly, the
defendants were not by any means affirming the continuance of the tenancy in
their reply by disputing that the head lessee was not entitled immediately to
a full refund of the deposit. The defendants stand all along had been fairly
clear and consistent that they wanted the premises back and the two leases
terminated. Thus, there could be no room for the head lessee to argue
thereafter that the leases had not been determined or that there was a
positive act of waiver or forfeiture by the defendants somewhere along the
line. If indeed the head lessees stand was that the leases on the demised
premises had not been determined, then it was the head lessee who had misled
the defendants into (a) thinking that the leases had been so determined, and
then (b) acting on that basis to their detriment. The head lessee would be
estopped in law from claiming that there was now no determination of the
leases.

76\. Subsequent voluntary payments by the head lessee, intended for rental
arrears, could not alter the fact that in law, the tenancies had been
determined by agreement of the parties. Obviously there was no way that the
defendants could stop the head lessee from dropping cheques drawn in favour of
the defendants into the quick cheque deposit box in the hope of reviving the
terminated tenancies. These payments in, whether for rental arrears, damages
or otherwise, could not amount to any waiver of the lawful forfeiture that had
occurred. Nor could they resurrect the tenancies after they had been
determined in the manner explained. The head lessee could not be allowed to
blow hot and cold. The writ of possession had been issued and served on the
head lessee long before, and according to the authorities, no subsequent acts,
including acceptance of rents thereafter, could waive that final election made
by the landlord to re-enter and forfeit the leases.

77\. In fact, the solicitors for the defendants subsequently made quite clear
in their letter of 14 February 2000 (the day immediately preceding the re-
entry) to the head lessees solicitors that subsequent payments received after
the date of issue of the writ would be regarded as payment towards arrears of
rent and/or damages **_without affecting the determination of the two
leases_**. The defendants solicitors wisely noted in the same letter that the
head lessee had in his defence conceded (a) liability for the arrears of rent
and (b) that the tenancy agreements had been determined.

78\. In essence, this letter confirmed the determination of the tenancies as
agreed. It was also fairly obvious from what was stated therein that the
withholding of the refund of the rental deposits by the defendants was never
on the basis that the tenancies were intended to continue, but that the
refunds would be temporarily withheld and paid over only after delivery of
vacant possession subject to any breaches under the leases for which the
defendants would be entitled to make deductions from the deposit held before
its refund.

79\. It must be pointed out that as of this date, the defendants were still
unaware that the head lessee had deposited directly into the defendants joint
DBS account a sum of $10,800 on 8 February 2000, and another sum of $21,600 on
12 February 2000 with the intention of covering the 3 months arrears of rental
(i.e. December 1999, January and February 2000) for the 1st storey units. On
12 February 2000, the head lessee deposited a further sum of $2,000 sufficient
to cover the overdue rental for December 1999 but not the January and February
2000 arrears for the 2nd storey unit. If one were to treat these 3 units as a
whole, one could not say that there were no arrears whatsoever outstanding as
at the critical date 15 February 2000, the date of the alleged trespass. As of
that date, the rent for the 2nd storey unit remained in arrears despite the
flurry of last minute deposits into the defendants joint bank account to avoid
forfeiture under the terms of the leases.

80\. In any case, Mr Sng Soon Heng testified that it was only later, on or
about the 15 February 2000, that he first knew of this deposit of $10,800. As
for the other deposits of $21,600 and $2,000, he learnt of them on or about 17
or 18 February 2000. His wife informed him. His wife would check with the bank
once a week to find out if there was any payment from the head lessee after
the rentals began falling into arrears. As there was no challenge by Mr Andrew
Ee, I accepted Mr Sngs evidence on this. This meant that as of 14 February
2000, when the defendants solicitors wrote to the solicitors for the head
lessee, the defendants were unaware of the fresh payments made.

81\. Granted that the defendants had not returned the payments after learning
of the fresh deposits, nevertheless these payments (on 8 and 12 February 2000)
of the arrears of rent by the head lessee, even if accepted as rent and not as
mesne profits or damages, could not be sufficient in law to constitute a
waiver of the re-entry and forfeiture. In my judgment, they came much too late
after the issue and service of the writ of possession on the head tenant on 21
January 2000\. See _Civil Service Co-operative Society v Mc Grigors Trustee_
[1923] 2 Ch 347 and _Evans v. Enever_ [1920] 2 K.B. 315, where no subsequent
acts of the lessor could be relied upon to qualify the lessors irrevocable
election to determine the lease by way of an action for recovery of
possession.

82\. Mr Ee relied on _Pierson v Harvey_ (1885) 1 T.L.R. 430 where the tenant
had also been paying rent directly into the landlords bank account. When the
landlord discovered the breach of the covenant not to sublet, he commenced
action to recover possession. Without giving notice to tenant, the landlord
instructed the bank not accept further cheques from the tenant. The bank
inadvertently allowed one cheque to be paid on 9 July 1884 for the rent due at
the end of June 1884\. The landlord was not aware of this until 21 October
1884, but he did not return the money. It was held that receiving rent under
protest made no difference. The landlord had not given notice to tenant that
he did not intend to receive the rent. Since he had received the rent, he had
therefore waived the forfeiture.

83\. I declined to follow _Pierson v Harvey_ if it was meant to substantiate
the proposition that payment (intended to be rent by the tenant) after service
of the writ of possession on the tenant could waive the forfeiture relied on
in the writ. In my view, the landlord is perfectly entitled, after the date of
issue of the writ, to receive payment towards arrears of rent, mesne profits
or damages as claimed in the writ without prejudicing their forfeiture of the
lease consequent upon the notional re-entry by serving the writ. This was
exactly what the defendants solicitors had stated in their letter dated 14
February 2000 as to the character with which the defendants would be accepting
the payments from the head lessee. The landlords acts of receiving the
payments after the date of issue of the writ, and _a fortiori_ after the date
of service of the writ, could not give rise to any waiver, the final election
to forfeit having irrevocably taken place.

84\. Although the previous agreed method of payment was banking directly into
the defendants joint bank account by way of cheques, nevertheless the
circumstances had changed so much and with the dispute now in the hands of
solicitors, the most appropriate mode of payment in my view should have been
to the defendants solicitors. Thus when the defendants went to the premises on
15 February 2000 to notify the subtenants to vacate, they acted _bona fide_ in
the belief that (a) both tenancies had been determined, (b) the head lessee
had himself agreed to it, and (c) the rental arrears had continued to remain
outstanding to the best of their knowledge at that time. Furthermore, they had
found prospective tenants, who had agreed to lease the premises subject to the
formal contract being finalised.

85\. The head lessee could not revive those forfeited leases by payment of
rental arrears or rents due in the way he did after the writ of possession had
been issued and served. He could only apply to the court to grant him relief
against forfeiture but only after fully settling all the arrears of rent.

**

Was the physical re-entry peaceably done?

**

86\. After the defendants had re-entered on 15 February 2000 and regained
possession of the premises on 16 February 2000, the secretary of the
plaintiffs, Mr Nordin bin Mohd, wrote a letter dated 17 February 2000 to
protest the re-entry, stating that Mr Toh Teng Seng had come with five other
men to threaten and intimidate them. In spite of their protests, Mr Toh had
pulled down the door-rail and locked up the premises, thereby preventing them
and other stallholders from carrying on their business.

87\. Coincidentally on the same day, the head lessees solicitors also filed an
amended defence, which resiled from the position stated in their earlier
defence filed on 3 February 2000\. The significant part of the earlier defence
- _which determination has taken place upon the issue of the Plaintiffs Writ
in this present action_ \- was deleted. It would appear that both the head
lessee and plaintiffs had decided that it was necessary to change tact and
treat the leases as subsisting. In my view it was much too late after the head
lessee had unequivocally intimated to the defendants that the leases had been
determined and the defendants had, vide their reply to the defence dated 11
February 2000 and their letter dated 14 February 2000, accepted that
repudiatory determination, and had acted on it to their detriment.

88\. What was perplexing was that the head lessee continued to maintain his
counterclaim for the sum of $32,400 being the rental deposits held by the
defendants and at the same time prayed for an order that the leases _be not
forfeited but do continue to be in force and effect_. If the head lessee
wanted to turn round and assert instead that the lease was to continue, then
it would be inconsistent to mount a counterclaim for the refund of the rental
deposit. Having allowed matters to run so far down the road, and with the re-
entry/forfeiture having taken place and new tenants given possession of the
premises for renovation works, the head lessee including his sublessees
obviously could not be allowed unilaterally to take a different position now
i.e. that there was no determination of the tenancies at all and hence, the
re-entry was a trespass by the defendants.

89\. In any event, there appeared to be a concerted action by the head lessee
and his sublessees, both represented by the same set of solicitors, Andrew Ee
& Co., to save the head leases. In my view, it was too late because lawful and
peaceable entry had taken place. There could be no trespass in law. The only
way to save the tenancies was for the head lessee or his sublessees to apply
for relief against forfeiture. Until the court grants equitable relief, the
owner is entitled to proceed with finding a replacement tenant, but he will
run the risk of disengaging from any new tenancy entered into should the court
subsequently order relief against forfeiture of the tenancies.

90\. At the hearing, I asked Mr Nordin bin Mohd to explain how the defendants
had threatened and intimated them. He testified that on 15 February 2000, the
defendants entered the premises. Mr Toh Teng Seng told the stallholders
including the plaintiffs to vacate the premises within 24 hours. Nr Nordin
asked Mr Toh whether he had any papers, letters of authority or court
documents. Mr Nordin said that Mr Toh acted arrogantly and shouted at them,
telling them to talk to their lawyers. However, Mr Sng Soon Heng behaved well
according to Mr Nordin. On the 16 February 2000, Mr Nordin witnessed the
closure of the premises by Mr Toh and his men. Mr Nordin testified that they
left at once because they felt embarrassed with the whole situation.

91\. In any act of re-entry or re-possession by the landlord, the occupants
may have to face some embarrassment. This is unavoidable. Clearly, the
plaintiffs decided to move out themselves because of their own embarrassment,
which Mr Nordin admitted in his evidence. There was no evidence that they were
forced out of the premises by physical force or threats of violence of any
kind by the defendants. Neither could I regard telling the occupiers to speak
to their lawyers as a threat, even though Mr Toh might have told them to do so
in a loud voice. Finally, Mr Nordin admitted on oath in court that the
defendants in fact did not intimidate them or threaten them, contrary to what
he had earlier stated in his letter.

92\. According to Mr Sng Soon Heng, the occupiers were informed on 15 February
2000 that the head lessee wanted to surrender the premises. He told them to
cease business and look for the head lessee. They then changed some of the
locks and said that they would lock up the premises the following day. He also
personally spoke to Mr Nordin and told him that the head lessee did not want
the premises and that he wanted to take possession of the premises. When asked
if they had any court order, Mr Sng replied that he did not have any. Mr Sng
then mentioned that the head lessee had informed him that Mr Nordin himself
was in arrears of rental for 4 months. Mr Nordin kept quiet. Mr Sng told Mr
Nordin that he knew very well why the matter ended up that way. The contents
of this conversation with Mr Nordin were not challenged.

93\. From the totality of the evidence, I concluded that the re-entry was
largely peaceful, and the plaintiffs left of their own accord due to their own
embarrassment more than anything else. The head lessee was nowhere to be seen
during the re-entry on 15 February 2000 and re-possession by the defendants on
the 16 February 2000.

94\. In my judgment, the fact that the defendants had commenced an action for
recovery of possession did not preclude self-help remedies to recover the
premises by themselves if done peaceably. It did not mean that they had to
wait for judgment for possession before they could physically re-enter. If the
subtenants and tenants refused to move out, then the defendants should not
forcibly remove the tenants, unless they did not mind risking the penalties
prescribed under the criminal law. A court judgment for possession would then
be required to compel the subtenants and tenants to surrender possession. But
if the subtenants, whether under protest or not, decide to move out upon being
told to do so, the landlords would have succeeded in recovering physical
possession. Once possession is surrendered, the evicted tenants or subtenants
cannot remove the landlords unless they succeed in obtaining relief against
forfeiture. If the landlords decide to allow the tenants to regain possession
and continue the lease, then it is superfluous to come to court to obtain
relief against forfeiture.

95\. I accepted the submission of Mr Singh that on account of the head lessee
having stated unequivocally that the tenancy of the premises had been
determined, the defendants proceeded to mitigate their loss by looking for new
tenants. If indeed the plaintiffs suffered any loss as a result of the failure
of the head tenant to pay the rent in the manner covenanted, which directly
resulted in the landlords forfeiture of the two head leases, then they ought
to look to the head tenant instead and not to the defendants.

**

New Tenants

**

96\. Mr Ee on the other hand tried to portray the defendants as greedy
landlords who chased out the plaintiffs after they found new tenants willing
to pay a higher rent to them.

97\. It could not be denied that the defendants were having difficulties
collecting rent from the head lessee since November 1999. Their frustrations
must have led them to file the writ on 13 December 1999 and finally to serve
it on 21 January 2000. In these circumstances, it was perfectly reasonable for
the defendants to look for new tenants to mitigate their loss and to minimise
the period that their premises would be left vacant without a tenant. If
anything at all, it showed their intention and determination to end the two
leases. The defendants were clearly not interested in continuing their
tenancies with the head lessee at all. No waiver could arise from their
conduct. In any event, the correspondence with the new tenants clearly proved
that the writ was in fact issued long before any new tenancy agreement was
concluded. Any suggestion of ulterior motive on the part of the defendants was
without basis.

98\. I observed with some interest that the defendants solicitors were careful
to stipulate in their letter dated 8 February 2000 to Rodyk & Davidson, the
solicitors for the prospective tenants Mdm Fariday and Mr Amin Awall, that all
necessary approvals from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and other
relevant authorities that were required for the use of the premises as an
eating house were to be applied for and obtained by their clients at their own
cost and expense. From the exchange of letters, it would appear that both the
defendants and their prospective tenants were keenly aware of the need to
obtain approval from the URA for change of use of the two units on the 1st
storey to that of eating house before the premises could be used as such.

99\. When the prospective tenants agreed that they were prepared to rent the
premises for 4 years from 19 February 2000 to 18 February 2004, they forwarded
a cheque on 15 February 2000 for $90,000 comprising 6 months rental deposit to
the defendants solicitors. The 1st months rent was free. The rent was $12,800
p.m. for the next 6 months and thereafter at $15,000 p.m.

100\. On the same day i.e. 15 February 2000, the defendants went to the
premises to inform the occupiers to vacate the premises. On the following day,
16 February 2000, the defendants exercised their right to re-possess the
premises and locked up the premises. On or about the same day, the keys were
handed over to the new tenants to allow them to commence renovation work.

101\. After securing possession of the premises, the defendants solicitors
wrote to Rodyk & Davidson on 17 February 2000 that the new tenancy was subject
to the relevant authorities approval for change of use of the 1st storey units
to an eating house. In the event that this was not approved, the intended
tenancy would not be proceeded with. The defendants eventually agreed to
undertake the application to the relevant authorities for the said change of
use.

102\. The new tenancy agreement with Mdm Fariday and Mr Amin Awall (trading
under the name of "Black & White Grill Ltd.") was finally signed on 23
February 2000. The new tenancy agreement contained detailed provisions for
disengagement in the event that the necessary approvals were not obtained.__
This showed that the defendants had acted prudently to obtain legal possession
first before they proceeded to sign the new tenancy agreement subject to
certain terms and necessary approvals. They were not prepared to break the law
and allow their tenants to operate an unapproved and illegal eating house on
their premises.

103\. The use of the premises as an eating house without planning approval of
the URA will contravene the Planning Act (Cap.232). See section 14(7) read
with Sections 3(1), 12, 13 and 14. The penalties are severe: a fine not
exceeding $200,000, and in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine
not exceeding $10,000 for every day or part thereof during which the offence
continues.

104\. In the process of applying for planning permission from the URA, the
defendants discovered that neither the head lessee nor the plaintiffs had
themselves any planning permission to operate the premises as an eating house.
Not only was there a breach of the head lease and sublease, it was also in
violation of the Planning Act. This will be of significance when considering
whether the damages claimed by the plaintiffs had any merit.

**

Damages

**

105\. Should I be wrong to conclude that there was no trespass, I would go on
to hold that the plaintiffs had suffered no damage.

106\. When the court in DC Suit No 5500 of 1999 granted the head lessee relief
from forfeiture on 27 March 2000, and ordered the defendants to restore the
premises to the head lessee, the defendants said they had done so promptly on
3 May 2000 by returning the keys, after their appeal was dismissed on 25 April
2000. But the head lessee rejected the keys until he was ordered by the court
in High Court Suit No 315 of 2000 to retake possession of the premises. Since
then, the plaintiffs had not resumed their food business on the premises. Yet
they were claiming damages on the basis that they could have been continuing
their food business till the end of their sublease in the year 2003.

107\. If there was indeed any trespass, the assessment of damages must be
confined to the loss including direct consequential loss caused by the
defendants occupation for the short period of 2 months from 16 February 2000
to 3 May 2000. Loss too remote or not traceable to the defendants said
occupation must be excluded.

**_

Restrictions on use of the premises in the head lease

_**

108\. Clause 1 of the head lease of the 1st storey units specifically states
_that the landlords let and the tenant takes all the two** _shophouses_**_.
These words imply that the premises were specifically rented out as shophouses
and not as eating houses or coffee shops. But the plaintiffs were using the
1st storey units as an eating house or a caf contrary to the provisions of the
head lease.

109\. Clause 2 (e) of the head lease moreover stipulates that:

> 2\. The tenant hereby agrees with the landlord as follows:
>
> (e) Not without first obtaining the landlords consent and all permissions
> and consents required by law to cause or permit at any time during the
> tenancy **_any such material change in the user of the premises_** as may be
> deemed to amount to development within the meaning of the Planning Act of
> Singapore or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof;
>
> **__**

URA Planning Approval

110\. Mr Ayob Ali Bharoocha, the elected chairman of the plaintiffs, admitted
that the committee running the plaintiffs was not aware as a fact that
planning approval from URA was required before the premises could be operated
as an eating house. Since they took over an existing eating house, they
assumed that all they needed was a foodshop licence from the Ministry of
Environment, which they had. Mr Singh showed him an application form for a
licence under the Environment Public Health Act (Cap 95), where the applicant
had to confirm that planning approval from Chief Planner, URA had been
obtained or applied for. All Mr Ayob was prepared to say was that he
remembered filling up a form when applying for the foodshop licence but he
could not specifically remember whether he had made such a statement to the
Ministry of Environment. Finally, he conceded that his food licence would be
subject to URAs planning approval.

111\. Mr Ayob admitted that the plaintiffs never applied for any planning
approval from URA. However, since they took over an existing food business,
there could be an existing URA planning approval for such use. What could not
be disputed was that the grant of written permission from URA given to the
head lessee (who was also Mr Ng Tiong Kiat at that time) for change of use of
the 1st storey units (from a 1st storey shop at No 357 and a veterinary clinic
at No 359) to an eating house was for a period only up to 18 January 1993,
whereupon the written permission would lapse unless further written permission
was granted.

112\. URAs reply dated 25 February 2000 to a recent legal requisition clearly
showed that the temporary permission for use of the said two units as an
eating house had in fact lapsed on 18 January 1993 and there was no further
written permission granted to the head lessee. I found therefore that neither
the head lessee, nor the plaintiffs as the subtenants, had any URA approval to
use the premises as an eating house after 18 January 1993. Further, the
obligation to obtain all permissions or consents required by law for any
material change in use of the premises had always been that of the head lessee
under clause 2 (e) of the head lessees lease agreement with the former owners,
and also under clause 2 (e) of the subtenants sublease agreement with the head
lessee, which was assigned to the plaintiffs.

113\. In fact, the defendants themselves applied on 1 March 2000 to the URA
for change of use to an eating house. On 24 March 2000, the URA replied (see
D1) refusing permission under Section 14 (4) of the Planning Act (Cap 232,
1998 Ed) for the premises on the 1st storey to be operated as an eating house
because it would _affect the amenity of the residential area in terms of car
parking and traffic_. The refusal had nothing to do with any internal layout
or structural alterations of the food stalls or facilities at the eating house
by the new tenant. Hence, any attempt by the plaintiffs to bolster their claim
for damages on a supposition that the URA would extend their temporary
permission granted earlier had there been no renovations, would not go very
far. A second attempt in June 2000 to obtain permission was similarly rejected
for the same reason (see D2). In the legal requisition from the URA (see D3),
the premises had been zoned as _Residential with commercial at 1st storey
only_ in the 1998 Master Plan Zoning.

114\. But the plaintiffs in their claim adduced evidence of damage and loss
grounded almost entirely on the prohibited use of the 1st storey premises as
an eating house. How the plaintiffs, as advised by his solicitors, could
expect the court to grant an award of damages on that basis was something that
I could not comprehend. It would be tantamount to a dissatisfied tenant,
having used the premises as an illegal betting house, bringing forth a claim
against the lessor for damages for trespass computed on the basis of a
disruption to his illegal betting activities and the consequent loss of his
lucrative profits. Obviously, a claim for damage of such nature based on an
illegal mode of performance or an illegal business was not legitimate. A court
will not assist a claimant to make good the shortfall of his ill-gotten
profits by way of an award of damages or otherwise.

115\. If indeed the plaintiffs were serious in thinking that they were
entitled to operate at the 1st storey premises as an eating house, there would
have been no reason for them to surrender their foodshop licence to the
Ministry of Environment on 10 July 2000 after their head lessee managed to
obtain an order of relief against forfeiture of the head leases as early as 27
March 2000. After the defendants appeal was dismissed on 25 April 2000, the
defendants had promptly 8 days later, on 3 May 2000, forwarded the keys to the
head lessees solicitors for onward transmission to their client. I found it
most surprising that the plaintiffs should surrender their foodshop licence
thereafter. It was obvious to me that the plaintiffs realised by now that they
could not possibly carry on a coffee shop or a caf business at the premises
legally without URA approval.

116\. Unfortunately, there was further dispute between the head lessee and the
defendants where the head lessee insisted on having the premises restored to
their original unrenovated condition and refused to accept the keys, resulting
in a string of suits and court applications that need not concern us here. The
inability of the plaintiffs to re-enter after 2 May 2000 was therefore not
caused by the defendants but by the head lessee in refusing to accept the keys
returned by the defendants until the head lessee was compelled to do so by the
court.

117\. Whatever it was, it was absolutely clear that the URA was not going to
grant any permission for the premises to be operated as an eating house. The
entire commercial objective of the plaintiffs sublease of the premises had
been frustrated. I could not see why the renovated and improved premises could
no longer be run as an eating house (if not more profitably), without
restoration to its former state, unless of course, there was no prospect of
approval as an eating house by URA. If indeed the only way was to renovate the
premises into a shophouse or office or some other useful commercial premises
as allowed by URA, then the renovated eating house or the unrenovated Protax
Caf would have to be demolished in either event. In converting the premises to
a shophouse or an office or some other commercial premises that the URA might
approve, the old food stalls must still be demolished and renovations must
still be carried out. Hence, the investment sunk in by Protax in taking over
the food stalls from the previous sublessee would not be recoverable in any
event. I thus found that no damage whatsoever had resulted from the renovation
of the coffee shop at the 1st storey premises.

118\. In any event, the head lessee had in breach of clause 2 (e) of the lease
agreement dated 1 Jun 1997 and in complete disregard of the provisions of the
Planning Act allowed the 1st storey units to be used as an eating house, which
he should not. The head lessee would have known that the earlier temporary URA
approval had lapsed. He would know that he needed to apply for URA approval as
he himself made the earlier application for change of use to an eating house,
for which only approval for a limited period was granted. Therefore, there was
in law sufficient basis for the defendants to exercise their right of re-entry
and to determine the lease under clause 4 (a) of the lease due to the head
lessees neglect to observe Clause 4 (e) of the lease, quite apart from the
issue of non-payment of rental for the premises, although notice for such a
breach must first be given under Section 18 of the Conveyancing and Law of
Property Act before the right of re-entry or forfeiture pursuant to such a
breach could be exercised.

**_

Plaintiffs claim for loss of or trespass to their goods

_**

119\. In my view, the claim for loss of or trespass to chattels was unfounded.

120\. Mdm Norsiah Binte Haji Abdul Samat testified that the plaintiffs had
brought a lorry to remove their belongings. They also went to the 2nd storey
unit to take their things away. I found corroboration from the fact that the
plaintiffs could tender into court a book of records as evidence of their
earnings from the various stalls purportedly run by them. If they had not
removed their belongings and just left the premises, how could they produce
those records? According to Mdm Norsiah, the other stallholders also removed
their belongings. Certain chillers, coffee boilers, tables and chairs supplied
on rental basis were taken back by the suppliers. She appeared to me to be
forthright in her testimony. I believed her.

121\. Clearly, the plaintiffs were not deprived of the opportunity to remove
any belongings they wanted before the new tenants of the defendants started
their renovations. I did not think the new tenants nor the defendants would be
interested in any of the old and used items left behind. The former stalls
were totally demolished. The premises were given a totally different and
modern look.

122\. When the premises were repossessed, the plaintiffs never once complained
that they were deprived of their chattels and their equipment. There was no
evidence to show that they tried to retrieve their chattels and equipment
after the 16 February 2000 but were prevented by the new tenants or the
defendants. The correspondence exhibited merely showed that they wanted to
have the premises back.

123\. According to Mr Admin Bin Awall, no items of any significant value were
left behind by the plaintiffs.

124\. From the evidence of Mr Toh Teng Seng, it appeared to me that the
defendants were very reasonable and accommodating. When the roti-prata seller
asked him for one week to remove his things from his room on the second
storey, Mr Toh said that he telephoned the new tenants for their permission
and they agreed. It did not seem to me that the defendants would have any
interest in refusing anyone permission to remove their belongings. I imagine
that it would have made it more difficult for the defendants to persuade these
stallholders to vacate the premises had they done so. From the spontaneity of
Mr Tohs evidence on how he went out of his way to try to help the roti-prata
stallholder finish selling his roti-prata by eating roti-prata himself,
getting his workers to do the same and offering to pay for it, it did not
appear to me that he had acted harshly towards the stallholders. More likely
than not, the stallholders were given sufficient opportunity to retrieve their
possessions. Thereafter, they left voluntarily and the re-possession of the
premises was peaceful. I could not see why the defendants would not accord the
same courtesy to the defendants if indeed they had requested for more time to
remove their belongings.

125\. If the tenants or subtenants refused to take steps to remove their
belongings after reasonable notice and opportunity had been given to them to
do so, it would be too late now to complain that there was loss of or trespass
to their goods by the landlord upon lawful re-entry and re-possession of the
premises. Thereafter, the landlord or his agents would be entitled to remove
these goods or discard them. The landlord cannot then be accused of committing
trespass to the goods left behind in the premises.

126\. I accepted Mr Tohs evidence that they had in fact locked up the premises
in a very amicable way. I also accepted his evidence that they had informed
the stallholders that the keys to the coffee-shop would be handed over to the
contractors and if they wanted to remove anything, they could get the
contractors to open the doors. I believed Mr Sngs evidence that they did not
take any photo-copier, computer, equipment or any items of value from the
premises. His evidence was that when they went upstairs on 16 February 2000,
there was a mattress on the floor belonging to Mr Mohammad selling roti-prota.
In another room were two chairs, a table and some newspapers on the floor.
Downstairs were one or two refrigerators, kitchen utensils, two to three
showcases, a few gas cylinders, bowls and plates and one signboard. He was not
interested in them. If the owners wanted to take them, they could. In my view,
it would be much easier for the contractor to do the renovations if the owners
of the items were to remove them. Otherwise, the contractor would be saddled
with their disposal. The allegation of the plaintiffs that they lost their
goods was not substantiated by the evidence.

Conclusion

**

127\. I concluded that the plaintiffs had removed the belongings that they
wanted. Only items of inconsequential value or non-reusable items like the
Protax Caf signboard were left behind. I did not find any evidence of unlawful
taking, removing or damaging of goods belonging to the plaintiffs by the
defendants or their agents acting at their behest. The plaintiffs failed to
prove any legitimate damage. They also did not prove that they could have
obtained URA approval to run the premises as an eating house. They did not
show that they could have netted a profit if the premises were merely used as
an ordinary office or a shophouse while having to pay the hefty $16,000 p.m.
rent on their sublease to the head lessee. No evidence whatsoever in this
direction was adduced. That burden rested with them, which they failed to
discharge.

128\. Accordingly, I dismissed the plaintiffs claim with costs to be taxed if
not agreed.
