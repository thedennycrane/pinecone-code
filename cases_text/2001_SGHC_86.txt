## Wong Wai Leng Laura alias Yow Wai Leng Laura v Yap Thiam Nguan  
[2001] SGHC 86

Case Number | : | D 202/1999, RAS 720068/2000  
---|---|---  
Decision Date | : | 04 May 2001  
Tribunal/Court | : | High Court  
Coram | : |  Judith Prakash J   
Counsel Name(s) | : |  Ann Tan with Veronica Joseph (Ann Tan & Associates) for the petitioner/respondent; Koh Geok Jen (Koh Ong & Partners) for the respondent/appellant   
Parties | : |  Wong Wai Leng Laura alias Yow Wai Leng Laura — Yap Thiam Nguan   
  
**JUDGMENT:**

**_Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. Mr Yap Thiam Nguan (the husband) married Ms Wong Wai Leng Laura (the wife)
at the Registry of Marriages, Singapore, on 2 November 1985. In November 1988,
their son, Nathanael, the only child of the marriage, was born.

2\. In December 1994, the parties were living in a house in Taman Bedok
together with the wifes parents. The house was owned jointly by the husband,
the wife and the wifes mother. A quarrel took place on 5 December and
following that the husband left the matrimonial home. His position was that
the wife and her family forced him out. The parties did not cohabit thereafter
and various legal proceedings ensued.

3\. First, proceedings were taken in relation to the custody and maintenance
of the child. In June 1996, an order was made by the High Court granting the
parties joint custody of Nathanael with care and control to the wife and
access to the husband. In addition, the husband was ordered to pay monthly
maintenance of $900 for Nathanael with effect from June 1996.

4\. In early 1998, the husband took out an originating summons procedure in
this court to obtain the courts determination of the various shares held by
himself, the wife and her mother in Taman Bedok. In February 1999, the wife
presented a petition for divorce on the ground of their having lived
separately and apart for at least the previous four years. The husband did not
contest the proceedings and a decree nisi was granted in April 1999.
Meanwhile, the husband had filed an application in March 1999 seeking a
variation (and reduction) of the original order for maintenance of the son.
When this matter came on for hearing in May 1999 in the High Court, it was
remitted for hearing before the District Judge hearing the ancillary matters.

5\. The hearing of the ancillary matters was somewhat delayed due to the
dispute over Taman Bedok. Finally, the parties were able to resolve this
dispute in February 2000. A consent order was made whereby the property was to
be sold and each of the parties was to be reimbursed his/her actual financial
contribution to its purchase from the sale proceeds and the balance thereafter
was to be divided equally among them.

6\. The ancillary matters finally came up for hearing in August 2000. The wife
was granted sole custody of Nathanael with reasonable access to the husband.
He was ordered to pay $1,100 per month as maintenance for Nathanael and a lump
sum maintenance of $85,000 to the wife. The lump sum maintenance was to be
paid from his share of the proceeds of sale of Taman Bedok. The husband was
also ordered to transfer to the wife all his right, title and interest in a
flat at The Bayshore upon payment by her of the sum of $22,396.22. Finally,
the husband was ordered to transfer the membership of the Singapore Swimming
Club to the wife.

7\. The husband is dissatisfied with four aspects of the decision below.
First, he wants the maintenance payment for Nathanael reduced to $345 per
month. Secondly, he contests the lump sum maintenance order in favour of the
wife on the basis that she is not entitled to maintenance. Thirdly, in respect
of the Singapore Swimming Club membership, he wants an order for the wife to
reimburse him the sum of $10,218.52 being the expenses which he incurred in
connection with this membership and also for her to bear the cost of the
transfer. Finally, the husband wants the wife to be ordered to pay him the sum
of $25,505.98 being a half share of the sale proceeds realised from the sale
of a flat in AVA Towers, Singapore which was jointly owned by the parties.

Maintenance for Nathanael

**

8\. Nathanael was aged 11 at the date of the hearing. He is now 12 and in his
first year of secondary school. According to the wife, Nathanaels expenses
last year amounted to $2,929.96 per month. At that time the wife herself was
earning $2,449 per month as the principal of a Before and After School
Student-care Centre run by a church.

9\. She itemised Nathanaels expenses as follows:

> 1. |  Student Aftercare |  $400  
> ---|---|---  
> 2. |  Chinese tuition (Qualified IE teacher: $35 per hour x 1.5 hours x 8 lessons |  $420  
> 3. |  Pocket money ($3.50 per day x 5 days x |  $90  
> 4. |  Assessment book, CD-Rom aids, other stationery |  $200  
> 5. |  Uniform & school shoes 2 sets per year (approximately $360 per year) |  $30  
> 6. |  Medical/dental |  $120  
> 7. |  Transport (includes $80 alone for school transport) |  $150  
> 8. |  Vitamins |  $150  
> 9. |  Outings on weekends (approximately $50 each outing) |  $200  
> 10. |  School and supplementary fees |  $15  
> 11. |  Domestic maid ($675 3 people in household) |  $225  
> 12. |  Insurance |  $155.20  
> 13. |  Toys |  $50  
> 14. |  Clothing and other apparel |  $80  
> 15. |  Toiletries |  $25  
> 16. |  Spectacles ($110 x 2 per annum) |  $18.30  
> 17. |  Marketing/food (approximately $100 per week x 4 divided among 3 persons in household) |  $133.33  
> 18. |  Supermarket, groceries and household toiletries (approximately $75 per week x 4 divided among 3 persons in household) |  $100  
> 19. |  Water, electricity and gas (divided among 3 persons in household) |  $83.33  
> 20. |  Newspapers ($45 divided among 3 persons in the household) |  $15  
> 21. |  Internet |  $20  
> 22. |  Vacation ($3,000 per annum) |  $250  
> |  |  __________  
> |  Total |  $2,929.96  
  
10\. The husband on the other hand considered that these expenses were
exaggerated and that it would be reasonable for a sum of only $690 per month
to be spent on Nathanael. He was willing to contribute half that amount. As
the Judge pointed out, he failed to factor into account not only the tuition
fees and the fees for student after care but also the costs which the wife
incurred in providing a home for the son. Before me, his counsel submitted
that they should be worked out as follows:

> 1. |  Tuition |  $300  
> ---|---|---  
> 2. |  Pocket money |  $90  
> 3. |  Assessment books, CD roms etc |  $30  
> 4. |  Uniforms and school shoes (two sets per annum each) |  $30  
> 5. |  Medical/Dental |  $30  
> 6. |  Transport (school bus $80 plus weekends) |  $100  
> 7. |  Vitamins |  $30  
> 8. |  Outings |  $80  
> 9. |  School fees |  $15  
> 10. |  Maid (in lieu of student care) |  $225  
> 11. |  Toys |  $20  
> 12. |  Clothes |  $30  
> 13. |  Toiletries |  $10  
> 14. |  Spectacles |  $18.30  
> 15. |  Food |  $133.33  
> 16. |  Groceries |  $20  
> 17. |  Water, utilities |  $15  
> 18. |  Newspapers |  $15  
> 19. |  Internet |  $20  
> | Total | $1,211.63  
  
I note here that the husband had revised his figures from those presented
below and that the total figure of $1,211.63 is some $500 higher than the
estimate that he originally put forward before the Judge.

11\. The Judge observed that the wife had inflated the sons expenses to some
extent but also that the husbands estimate (at that stage) that he required
only $690 per month was unrealistic and totally unreasonable for the child.
She stated that the husband had been content with the High Court order to pay
the sum of $900 per month for the son but was now quibbling over maintenance.
The Judge also considered that the husbands claim to be unemployed was
difficult to believe and that for the purposes of determining his income, the
husband had to be considered as having an earning capacity of $5,000 a month
as that was his approximate salary in 1998 before he resigned from his
employment with Pidemco Land Ltd (Pidemco). The Judge having taken this into
account and bearing in mind the factors set out in the Womens Charter decided
that it was fair and reasonable to order the husband to pay $1,100 per month
as maintenance for the son.

12\. Before me, it was submitted that although the husband had originally been
content with the original maintenance order, after he lost his paid employment
he had taken steps to reduce the amount payable by making the necessary
variation application. It was unfortunate that although the application was
filed in March 1999, it was not heard but remitted by the High Court to the
Family Court to be heard together with the ancillary matters and, as a result,
was not considered until more than a year later. It was therefore incorrect to
conclude that the husband had been content all along with the maintenance
order.

13\. It was also submitted that the husbands unemployment was a material
change in circumstances justifying his application for variation as well as
his appeal. The observation below that when the husband resigned from his
employment with Pidemco he must have been confident of obtaining alternative
employment at least $5,000 per month was criticised and it was also pointed
out that the Judge did not give sufficient consideration to his parlous
financial circumstances as shown by his reliance on loans from his siblings
and his several debts and overdraft facilities.

14\. I must first state that I consider the sons expenses to be greatly
exaggerated and unreasonable. The wifes position was that she was earning only
$2,449 a month as at the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. That
being the case, I do not think that she could have maintained an expenditure
of $2,929.96 per month on Nathanael alone, even taking into account the $900
paid by the husband. If in fact she was spending that much on Nathanael she
either had substantial savings which could support the expenditure or was
acting extravagantly. When the wife earned $10,000 a month as she had prior to
the end of 1998, expenditure at this level may have been justified.
Unfortunately, the familys financial situation is now much reduced and whilst
every parent wants the best for her offspring, she must adjust the expenses to
suit the familys income.

15\. In the circumstances of this case, I consider that the husbands estimate
of Nathanaels expenses to be, on the whole, more reasonable. I think he has
underestimated the amount that his son eats and that therefore the amount for
groceries should be increased from his figure of $20 to $100 as claimed by the
wife. This increase of some $80 would bring Nathanaels total expenses each
month to $1,291.63 which could be rounded off at $1,300.

16\. The next question is how much of these expenses should be borne by the
husband. In this regard, I have to consider the husbands income and his
earning capacity, property and other financial resources. The Judge treated
the husband as having the capacity to earn $5,000 a month since that was his
last drawn salary at Pidemco. Unfortunately, it appears that the husband has
not been able to achieve anything like that level since leaving that company.

17\. According to the husbands affidavits, at the time the original order was
made, he was employed as a manager by Pidemco and was seconded to China.
Unfortunately, around July 1998, Pidemco decided to restructure its China
operations and its regional office in Beijing took over the management of the
projects in Xiamen that the husband had had charge of. He was made redundant
and posted back to Singapore where he was told to report to the marketing and
sales division. About a week later, however, management informed him that he
was redundant in Singapore as there was no available position here for someone
who had his qualifications and experience in real estate management. He was
asked whether he wanted to resign and was told that the alternative was that
the company would give him notice. The husband then chose to resign. I should
state here that, unlike the Judge, I accept the husbands explanation of the
circumstances in which he lost his employment and that it was not his choice
to leave his job but that the situation made resignation the only face saving
course open to him. It appeared to me to be a coherent and credible account
particularly bearing in mind the economic climate that existed in 1998. It is
significant here that the wife too, although in a completely different
industry, was retrenched in October 1998.

18\. After resigning, the husband attempted to find employment in the property
business in China. He produced a number of application letters which he had
written in 1999 applying to be a business development manager or an operations
manager of property developments in China. He was not successful in any of
them. According to the husband, he had also travelled to China in order to
secure employment since he had worked there for four years and was more
familiar with the Chinese property market than the Singapore market. At the
time of the hearing below, he had made contact with a manager of a
construction project in Xiamen, China and had just been given the opportunity
to market some of the units of this development on a commission basis. The
husband asserted that between August 1998 and May 2000 he had had no paid
employment and had lived off his savings and loans from banks, credit cards
and his siblings.

19\. There was a great deal of evidence in the affidavits regarding the
husbands indebtedness. The wife was not convinced of this or of his claim to
have been unable to find a job since being forced to resign. She even doubted
that he had been forced to resign. She was not, however, able to produce any
direct evidence to rebut the husbands assertions. She relied instead on
inference and suspicion. The wife herself should, however, have appreciated
the difficult economic situation which was faced by the husband, particularly
since he was seeking employment in the property segment of the economy. She
herself was retrenched at the end of 1998 from a well paying job with Levi
Strauss Asia Pacific Division (Levi Strauss). She subsequently tried to work
as a consultant. Even though by this means she was able to earn $3,000 to
$4,000 per month, the uncertainty and difficulty of working for herself
eventually persuaded her to take on employment at only $2,449 per month.

20\. In my judgment, it was not correct in all the circumstances of this case,
for the Judge to treat the husband as being able to command an income of
$5,000 a month. This would only have been the case had jobs in the area in
which the husband had expertise been available ie property developments in
China. Unfortunately, that area was affected by the economic down turn of the
period. On the other hand, it would not be correct to treat the husband as
being incapable of earning any income at all. He is obviously a competent man
who has a number of business friends and other contacts. Further, he has no
health problems or other disabilities. He should therefore be able to earn a
living if he is willing to change the nature of his employment. He probably
has to move out of the property sector but I see no reason why he should not
be able to earn at least $2,500 a month in an administrative or marketing
position. The wife was able to find a job at that level and the husband should
be equally employable if he would lower his expectations.

21\. The husband should therefore be able to contribute to half of Nathanaels
expenses at the current level of $1,300. I therefore allow the husbands appeal
in relation to maintenance and set aside the order below. Instead, the husband
should pay the wife $650 a month as maintenance for Nathanael. The varied
maintenance amount shall take effect from June 1999 ie just after the High
Court remitted the husbands application for variation of the maintenance order
to the Family Court.

**

Maintenance for the wife

**

22\. In the court below, the wife asked for lump sum maintenance calculated at
$2,000 per month for a period of ten years which would amount to $240,000. The
husband was not prepared to make any offer of maintenance for the wife since
he was of the view that the wifes income far exceeded his and also asserted
that he did not have the financial means to pay her anything. The Judge
considered that although the wife was gainfully employed, the husband was
under a duty to maintain her and the fact of her employment only had an impact
on the quantum.

23\. Where the quantum was concerned, the Judge found that the wife had
exaggerated her expenses and that the figure of $2,000 per month sought by her
was excessive. The Judge considered that the wife should scale down her
expenses and live within her means. The Judge found $700 a month to be a
reasonable figure for the wifes maintenance. She also considered that this was
an appropriate case for a lump sum maintenance award and that the husband
would have the means to satisfy such a lump sum order from the $200,000 he
would receive from the sale of 61 Taman Bedok. The Judge considered that the
period of ten years maintenance sought by the wife was fair. That would have
meant $84,000 in maintenance but the Judge rounded up this figure to $85,000
and ordered the husband to pay it from his share of the net proceeds of sale
of Taman Bedok.

24\. The husband contended that the wifes income had always surpassed his,
that her expenses were wildly exaggerated and that she had had various
financial resources and advantages that were not available to him. He pointed
out that despite the order of court made in February 2000 for the sale of
Taman Bedok, at the date of the appeal, it had still not been sold and the
wife had occupied it, to his exclusion, since December 1994. Further, since
the decision below, it was clear that the wife would have other valuable
assets from the marriage: she would be the one retaining the membership of the
Singapore Swimming Club, she would not be accounting for any part of the sum
of $51,011.97 realised from the sale of AVA Towers, she would be the sole
owner of The Bayshore property (having refunded to the husband only his direct
financial contribution so that any gain from the increased value of the
property would be hers alone), and she would also receive about $376,000 from
the sale of Taman Bedok (inclusive of a $200,000 refund to her CPF account).
Additionally, the wife clearly had the potential to earn a high income. Before
her retrenchment in 1998, she earned $10,909 a month and even as a freelance
consultant she was able to earn $3,000 to $4,000 a month by charging $200 an
hour for her services.

25\. On the other hand, the husband argued that his financial resources and
income were far below those of the wife. Although he would gain about $281,000
from the sale of Taman Bedok, about $105,000 would go back to CPF leaving him
with cash of $176,000 out of which he would have to settle his outstanding
loans and liabilities amounting to $163,166.24. His only other assets would be
the sum of $22,396.22 which the wife would have to pay him in respect of his
interest in The Bayshore property and the sum of $23,167.18 from the sale of a
flat at Tanjong Pagar Plaza after the grant of the decree nisi. In respect of
the latter amount, the husband stated that he had used $7,000 to repay part of
a loan made by his brother Yap Kah Hoon and another $12,000 to reduce an
overdraft extended by HSBC. He therefore contended that he did not have the
resources to pay the wife the $85,000 lump sum that had been ordered.

26\. The wifes assertion was that subsequent to the parties separation in
December 1994, the husband did not maintain her. In 1995, she filed an
originating summons asking for custody of Nathanael and for the husband to
maintain him. She did not at that stage or later ask for any maintenance for
herself. Her explanation for not applying for maintenance between 1995 and
June 1999 when she filed her first affidavit in relation to the ancillary
matters, was that she was working and earning a good salary. She decided to
apply for maintenance after she was retrenched in October 1998 from Levi
Strauss. She stated that her savings were fast depleting and that in the light
of the then current economic downturn and her family situation, she had not
been able to find suitable permanent employment in her area of speciality that
would pay her the salary she was earning before.

27\. There is no doubt that the wife is as able as, if not more able than, the
husband, to make a good living. As she herself said, in 1992 when the husband
decided to take up a job in Taiwan, she gave up a position with a leading oil
company to join him even though at the time she was drawing a much bigger
salary than he was. In total, on an annual basis including bonuses, she
thought that she was earning twice as much as the husband at that time. The
position was similar in early 1998. The wife earned $10,000 a month and the
husband earned $5,000 a month. At the moment, the wifes income is much
reduced. This is partly the result of the economic situation and partly the
reason of a deliberate choice made by her. She could, if she wished, do
consultancy work or look for a better paying job in a more high level position
than the one she currently occupies as the principal of the church Studentcare
Centre.

28\. I also agree with the Judges assessment of the wifes expenses as being
exaggerated. In June 1999, the wifes affidavit stated that her then current
monthly expenses amounted to $6,648.25 inclusive of a sum of $3,103 paid
towards the mortgage of The Bayshore property. In April 2000, the wife filed a
further affidavit. By then her expenses had gone up to $8,147.74 per month
which she explained as being due to an increase in her income tax liability
arising from the income she had earned from Levi Strauss. It should be noted
that in 1999, her income tax return showed an income of $198,657. This
amounted to $16,554.75 per month which means that Levi Strauss gave her a very
generous retrenchment benefit and/or bonuses.

29\. Going by the wifes affidavits, her total expenses each month were
$11,077.70 when the childs expenses were taken into account. Her income,
taking into account maintenance for the child paid by the husband, was $3,349
monthly. There was therefore a discrepancy of $7,728.70 a month. The wife did
not explain exactly how she managed this discrepancy. She did allege that her
savings were being depleted but whilst this sounds a reasonable explanation,
the wife did not produce any bank accounts to show what savings she had and to
what extent these had been depleted by her expenses. The wife also did not
make full disclosure of the rental income received in respect of The Bayshore
property.

30\. Under s 114 of the Womens Charter (Cap 353), among the factors which the
court has to take into account in determining the amount of maintenance to be
paid by a man to his former wife are the income, earning capacity, property
and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or
is likely to have in the foreseeable future and their financial needs,
obligations and responsibilities. It appears to me that this is one of those
rare cases where the earning capacity of the wife equals if not exceeds those
of the husband. It is also a case where the wife has greater assets than the
husband both in terms of CPF savings as well as in real property. Further, she
has expectations which he does not in the sense that she is the only child of
the family and as such likely to inherit her mothers property (presently
represented by a 1/3 share in Taman Bedok). The wife has high expenses which
cannot be met by her present income but she has not shown any evidence of
being in debt now or of any likelihood that she will go into debt in the
foreseeable future. The husband, however, is clearly in a much more difficult
financial position with existing debts which he must repay.

31\. In any case, the husband has not got the resources to pay the wife any
lump sum maintenance. To require him to do so from his share of Taman Bedok
would be to prevent him from settling his debts and putting his finances back
on a stable footing. I do not think, therefore, that this is an appropriate
case for a lump sum maintenance. I do not think either that it is an
appropriate case to make a monthly maintenance order against the husband in
favour of the wife. At present, there is no evidence that he is capable of
earning, or is actually earning, more than she is and, for the time being at
least, he will be stretched by having to pay towards the sons maintenance. If
in future the husbands income increases, he can be asked to make a greater
contribution towards the cost of maintaining the son and the wife can then
retain more of her income to meet her own expenses.

32\. I therefore allow the husbands appeal in respect to the award of
maintenance. I set aside the order below and hold that the wife, in this case,
is not entitled to either lump sum or periodical maintenance.

**

Singapore Swimming Club membership

**

33\. The Judge found that this membership had been given to the wife by her
late father. Upon her marriage, the membership had been vested in the name of
the husband since the by-laws of the club provided that she was to become a
lady member and the husband ordinary member. She then paid a sum of $5,803.02
towards the husbands entrance fees. The Judge noted the wifes assertion that
since 1985, she had paid the monthly subscriptions and club bills and that her
total payments to the club including the entrance fees had come up to
$26,786.99. The wife wanted the membership transferred to her absolutely.

34\. The Judge noted that the husband did not challenge the wifes calculation
of the amount she had paid or her version of how the membership had been
acquired. He merely stated that he had paid $10,218.52 towards the fees and
expenses. The Judge found that the husband had not contributed towards the
acquisition of the asset and that he should not be repaid the $10,218.52 paid
by him towards expenses incurred in the club. Further, since the wife had paid
the club more than double what the husband had, the Judge did not consider
that it would be just and equitable for the wife to pay anything to the
husband for taking over the membership. In making this decision, the Judge was
also influenced by the fact that no order was being made to give the wife a
share in the $23,167.18 which the husband had received from the sale of the
Tanjong Pagar Plaza flat.

35\. The husbands appeal was for reimbursement of the said sum of $10,218.52.
He said that upon marriage, he had become the principal club member and
thereby been responsible for club due and expenses. Further, these expenses
had been incurred by the wife after the parties had separated and during the
time when the husband had been paying maintenance for the son. The facilities
had been enjoyed by the wife and son and not by the husband.

36\. The bills exhibited by the husband in his affidavit showed that he had
made payment of some of the subscription fees and expenses incurred over the
years. I do not think that the husband is entitled to reimbursement of the
expenses met by him as, insofar as these represented payment for meals and
other facilities enjoyed at the club by the wife and the son, they were
payments in the nature of maintenance which cannot be reclaimed. The wife too
met some bills for subscriptions and expenses since after the separation the
husband was sometimes irregular in payment. If neither of them had paid the
bills, then the membership would have been lost. Whilst the wifes contribution
to the membership exceeded that of the husband, I think it correct to
recognise that his action in paying subscription fees after the separation
helped preserved the membership which she now enjoys.

37\. The clubs rules provide that once a married couple who are members
divorce, only one of them can retain the membership. The other would need to
apply for a new membership if he or she wished to use the clubs facilities as
well. From other matrimonial appeals I have heard where membership of the
Singapore Swimming Club has been an issue, it appears that currently a new
member would have to pay the club an entrance fee of $40,000. As the wife has
been awarded this membership, she will not have to incur such a charge. This
is a benefit to her and I think that the husband should be compensated in some
way for this benefit which he does not enjoy. Taking into account the
discrepancy in the amounts paid for subscription and entrance fees by the
husband and the wife over the years, I award the husband $5,000 in respect of
his interest in the club which is being transferred to the wife. The cost of
transfer, if any, should, as the Judge observed (though no specific order was
made in this regard) be borne by the wife.

**

AVA Towers

**

38\. The parties purchased an apartment at AVA Towers in late 1991 and sold it
in February 1993. The net proceeds of sale which amounted to $51,011.97 were
paid into the wifes account and she did not thereafter pay any part of them to
the husband. The Judge did not allow the husbands claim for a share in those
monies. He thus sought to have that decision reversed.

39\. The wife had admitted that she had retained the money but asserted that
she had used it towards living expenses for Nathanael and herself during the
period of one and a half years that they were in Singapore and the husband was
in Taipei. She asserted that the husband had not given her any maintenance
during that period and, whilst the husband disputed this, he was not able to
produce any evidence that he had remitted money to her whether from Taipei or
otherwise to maintain her and Nathanael during that period. He argued that she
had not been able to show how she utilised the sum (ie she did not produce
documentary evidence showing how each dollar of that $51,000 was spent) and
that its retention could not be tied to the issue of maintenance during his
absence from Singapore.

40\. The Judge held that at the hearing of the ancillaries, the husband had to
satisfy the court that the amount was still with the wife. She accepted the
wifes explanation as to how the money had been utilised and observed as
follows:

> Taking into account the fact that some 6 years have passed from the receipt
> of the monies and the date of the divorce, it would be incredible if the
> said sum is still available for division between the parties. If it was the
> intention of the husband, that the wife is only entitled to use half of the
> sum of $51,011.97, then he should not have, in the first place, credited the
> entire sum to her account, and in the second place, he should have not have
> waited until the divorce proceedings to pursue his claim for the other half.
> There was nothing wrong for the wife to assume that she could use the said
> sum of $51,011.97 towards living expenses and the payment of bills. She was
> under no obligation to preserve half of the sum on the off-chance that one
> day, it must be returned to the husband. At that time, the parties were
> still together and had not separated. That being the case, I did not make
> any order on the division of the sale proceeds of $51,011.97 received by the
> parties some 6 years before the divorce.

With respect, I entirely agree that the wife was entitled to use the money for
the maintenance of herself and her son during the period when the husband sent
them nothing else. If the husband had been making regular maintenance
payments, the position would have been different. As no other maintenance was
being paid, she was entitled to draw the inference that she could use the
husbands share of the sale proceeds to meet the familys needs. It is also
significant that the husband did not allege that he had given her any specific
instruction with regard to the use of the money. In the circumstances, I see
no merit in the husbands appeal on this point.

Conclusion

**

41\. The husband has succeeded wholly in respect of two of his grounds of
appeal and partially in respect of the third ground. Accordingly, I award the
husband costs of the appeal. I will hear the parties on the quantum of costs.
