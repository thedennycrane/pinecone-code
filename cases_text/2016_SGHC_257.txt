Lee Seiu Kin J

1 On 17 February 2015, in Committal Hearing No 154 of 2011, the accused was
committed to stand trial in the High Court on 15 charges under the Misuse of
Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). At the trial before me on 18 October
2016, the prosecution proceeded on the first charge, which is punishable by
death. That charge (“the Charge”) was as follows:

1ST CHARGE on 12 October 2011, at about 11:50 am, inside a car (registration
number SGW 5275 L), at Jurong West Street 52, Singapore, did traffic in a
controlled drug specified in Class '”A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of
Drugs Act, Cap 185 (“MDA”), to wit, by having in your possession for the
purposes of trafficking, fifteen (15) packets and six (6) bundles containing
not less than 61.75 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the
said Act or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 5(l)(a) read
with s 5(2), MDA and punishable under s 33(1), MDA, and further upon your
conviction, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under s 33B, MDA.

2 After the Charge was read to the accused, he pleaded guilty. However, s
227(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) states
that, where the offence is punishable with death, the court shall not record
the plea of guilty unless evidence is led by the prosecution to prove its case
at trial. Accordingly, I called upon the prosecution to give evidence to prove
the Charge.

3 The prosecution gave evidence by way of a statement of agreed facts (“SAF”)
to be used as a formal admission under s 267 of the CPC. Counsel for the
accused confirmed that the accused agreed to the contents of the SAF and its
use under s 267 of the CPC. I set out below the provisions of s 267 of the
CPC:

Proof by formal admission

267.—(1) Subject to this section, any fact of which oral evidence may be given
in any criminal proceedings may be admitted for the purpose of those
proceedings by or on behalf of the Public Prosecutor or the accused, and the
admission by any party of any such fact under this section shall as against
that party be conclusive evidence in those proceedings of the fact admitted.

(2) An admission under this section —

(a) may be made before or at the proceedings;

(b) if made otherwise than in court, must be in writing;

(c) if made in writing by an individual, must purport to be signed by the
person making it and, if so made by a body corporate, limited liability
partnership, partnership or unincorporated association, must purport to be
signed by a duly authorised representative of that body corporate, limited
liability partnership, partnership or unincorporated association, as the case
may be;

(d) if made on behalf of an accused who is an individual, must be made by his
advocate; and

(e) if made before the trial by an accused who is an individual, must be
approved by his advocate before or at the proceedings in question.

(3) An admission under this section for the purpose of proceedings relating to
any matter shall be treated as an admission for the purpose of any subsequent
criminal proceedings relating to that matter, including any appeal or retrial.

(4) An admission under this section may with the leave of the court be
withdrawn in the proceedings for which it is made or any subsequent criminal
proceedings relating to the same matter.

4 I was satisfied that the SAF may be used as evidence in the trial as the
admissions therein were made by counsel for the accused on behalf of the
latter. Accordingly, I admitted the SAF in evidence. The contents of the SAF
are as follows:

I. The accused’s arrest and background

1 The accused person is Mohamad Noor Bin Abdullah, a 39 year old Singaporean
(D.O.B: 18 July 1977) and holder of NRIC No.: [xxx]. At the material time, he
was unemployed.

2 On 12 October 2011 at about 10 am, officers from the Central Narcotics
Bureau (“CNB”), Singapore were instructed at an operations briefing to proceed
to Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1, Singapore to conduct observation on the unit at
#08-523. They were informed to look out for a male Malay known by the nickname
“Boy”, who was suspected of involvement in drug activities. The CNB officers
then proceeded to the vicinity of Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1, and kept
observation. At about 11.16am, the accused, who fitted the description of
“Boy”, was seen walking at the ground floor of Blk 336 with a sling bag and a
plastic bag. He then entered a car bearing registration number SGW 5275L (“the
Car”) which was driven by another person.

3 The CNB officers then followed the Car from Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1 to
the car park at Blk 4 and Blk 5 Marsiling Road. At the car park, near to Blk 5
Marsiling Road, the accused handed an envelope, which he knew contained
heroin, to an unknown female Chinese. The Car left the car park at about
11.30am. The officers continued following the Car until it reached the car
park behind Blk 525 and Blk 527 Jurong West Street 52, Singapore, which was in
the vicinity of Blk 523. There, at about 11.50am, the officers stopped the Car
and effected arrest of the accused who was in the front passenger seat.

II. Search and seizure

4 After his arrest, the sling bag and plastic bag which the accused was seen
carrying when he was at Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1 were searched by the
Station Inspector Tay Cher Yean, and they found, inter alia, the following
items which were suspected to contain controlled drugs:  

Marking| Location of exhibit| Description  
---|---|---

L1D| One black plastic bag containing one newspaper wrapped bundle of granular

5 The said six bundles and 15 packets of granular substances (“the Drugs”)
were placed in tamper-proof bags and handed over to Senior Station Inspector
Ng David (“SSI Ng”).

6 On 12 October 2011 at about 7pm, SSI Ng handed over the Drugs to the
investigating officer at the time, then Inspector Almumin Ehsan Bin Akbar Ali
(“IO Almumin”).

III. Analysis of the Drugs

7 IO Almumin later handed the Drugs over to the Health Sciences Authority,
Singapore (“HSA”) for analysis. Upon analysis of the Drugs, Ms Tan Sylvia, an
analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA issued, on 14 August
2012, the following nine certificates under s16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act

11 In recording the above statements, no threat, inducement or promise was
made or given to the accused by CNB officers or any other officer or person in
authority involved in the investigations against the accused. The contents of
all statements were voluntarily provided by and accurately recorded from the
accused.

V. Investigations

12 Investigations revealed that sometime in August 2011, the accused, Mohd
Anuar bin Sujak (“Anuar”) and persons unknown had agreed to perform specific
tasks in relation to procuring, storing and delivering heroin for the purpose
of trafficking. Pursuant to the agreement, the accused was to deliver heroin
to Anuar’s customers.

13 Sometime on 11 October 2011, Anuar instructed the accused to make a drug
delivery to a place in Jurong West the next day (i.e. 12 October 2011). Anuar
promised Noor $100 for the said delivery and the accused agreed.

14 On 12 October 2011, the accused received the following calls with
instructions on the delivery of the Drugs:

(a) At about 10 am, Anuar called the accused, whilst the latter was at the
Flat, and told him to:

(i) take a red plastic bag (later marked as “L1”) and a white plastic bag
(later marked “L1A”) from the storeroom of the Flat. Both the accused and
Anuar knew that “L1” and “L1A” contained heroin;

(ii) wait for a call from a Malaysian male who would provide further
instructions on when and who to deliver “L1” and “L1A” (with the 6 bundles)
to; and

(iii) take envelopes, which both the accused and Anuar knew that each envelope
contained heroin, from the storeroom of the Flat. Anuar informed the accused
that he would provide further details on the delivery of these envelopes later
in the day.

The accused proceeded to assist Anuar. After retrieving the relevant items
from the storeroom, the accused put “L1A” (with its contents) inside “L1”. He
also placed the said envelopes into his black sling bag.

(b) Subsequently, the accused received a call from an unknown Malaysian male
who instructed him to deliver “L1” and “L1A” to one “Hassan” at Blk 523 Jurong
West. The accused acknowledged the said instructions. The call was made from a
Malaysia-registered phone line. The said Malaysian male informed the accused
that “Hassan” was a male Chinese and also provided the latter’s contact number
which the accused saved in his mobile phone as “Hassan (JW)”.

(c) At about 11am, Anuar called the accused and told him to deliver one of the
envelopes to an unknown female Chinese at Blk 5 Marsiling Road before
proceeding to Jurong West. The accused acknowledged what the accused had
conveyed to him.

15 At about 11 am, the accused left the Flat carrying his black sling bag
(containing the envelopes of heroin) and “L1” (containing 6 bundles of
heroin). At about 11.16am, the accused boarded the Car, driven by Hairil, and
sat in the front passenger seat. Hairil then drove the Car to the car park at
Blk 4 and Blk 5 Marsiling Road. There, the accused delivered one of the
envelopes to the said unknown female Chinese, as earlier told to do so by
Anuar.

16 The accused then requested Hairil to drive the Car to Jurong West. At about
11.30am, the Car left the said Marsiling Road car park. At about 11.50 am, the
Car reached the car park behind Blk 525 and Blk 527 Jurong West Street 52,
which was in the vicinity of Blk 523. There, CNB officers stopped the Car and
placed the accused under arrest.

17 As at the time of his arrest on 12 October 2011, the accused was not
authorised under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to traffic in a
controlled drug.

5 Upon admission of the SAF in evidence, the prosecution rested its case. I
found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case and called upon the
accused to give his defence in accordance with s 230(1)(m) of the CPC. The
accused elected to remain silent. Thereafter, I found that the evidence before
me was sufficient to prove the accused’s guilt and convicted him of the
Charge.

6 The prosecution tendered a certificate by the Public Prosecutor stating that
the accused had substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in
disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. After
hearing submissions by counsel, I agreed that the evidence showed that the
accused’s involvement in the offence was restricted to transporting, sending
or delivering the controlled drug which was the subject of the Charge.
Accordingly, by operation of s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, this court had a
discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment with caning instead of
the death penalty.

7 After considering the accused’s antecedents and his counsel’s plea in
mitigation, I found that this was an appropriate case to exercise the
discretion to impose the lesser punishment. Accordingly, I sentenced the
accused to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest on 12
October 2011 and to the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane.
