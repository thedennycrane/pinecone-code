Civil Procedure – Discovery of documents – Specific discovery – Whether
discovery of various internal documents should be ordered.  
  

1 July 2004

Choo Han Teck J:

1 This action was commenced by the plaintiff for US$427,300, being payment for
a product and some services provided by them to the defendant. The product and
services concerned were software called N2B Platform which was used to manage
data, and other related services. The defendant did not pay for the product
and services and the plaintiff sued for breach of contract. The defendant
averred that it was the plaintiff who was in breach and counterclaimed for
expenses incurred by reason of the plaintiff’s failure to provide the product
and services under the contract.

2 The issues at trial appear to be straightforward although technical as
evidence has to be adduced to prove whether the product met with the
contractual requirements. The plaintiff, however, had asked for discovery of
various documents including internal email and purchase documents involving
the defendant’s acquisition of a company known as TMI Telemedia International
Hong Kong (“TMI”). The plaintiff suspected that with the acquisition of TMI,
the defendant no longer required the plaintiff’s product. They were deeply
suspicious of the defendant’s motives. Mr Chacko, counsel for the plaintiff,
therefore argued that the particulars of the acquisition of TMI are highly
relevant. He gave some examples, orally, of the information sought. Examples
of such information were the date the acquisition took place and when the
defendant began using the software of TMI.

3 It appeared to me, after listening to counsel from both sides, that the
plaintiff’s request for discovery was a major fishing expedition designed to
harass and embarrass the defendant. I suggested to Mr Chacko that the
information that his clients sought could easily be obtained by an
interrogatory since the questions posed were all very specific.

4 The plaintiff’s preference for discovery seemed to me, an excessive and
inappropriate way of obtaining information (which, in this case, might not
even be relevant for the trial) instead of the more direct, focused, and less
intrusive means of the interrogatory process. I am not satisfied that this
application for specific discovery was in good faith but I gave them the
opportunity to put specific interrogatories to the defendant along the lines
that Mr Chacko had prayed to see the internal documents of the defendant.

5 The order for discovery was therefore set aside.

Defendant’s appeal allowed.
