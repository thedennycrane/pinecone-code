Sundaresh Menon CJ:

Introduction

1 The appellant was apprehended at a car park in Jurong West by officers from
the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) on 5 November 2012. At the time of her
arrest, she was in possession of a weighing scale and six packets of brown
granular substance weighing 501.91g, which was subsequently found to contain
not less than 8.98g of diamorphine. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of
possession of 8.98g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking under s
5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
(“the MDA”), and was sentenced by the district judge (“the District Judge”) to
11 years’ imprisonment. She appealed against the sentence on the basis that it
was manifestly excessive.

2 I heard the appeal on 23 April 2015. At the end of the hearing, I reserved
judgment as I had some concerns. It struck me that the sentencing precedents
had tended to focus very much on the harm caused by the offence by reference
to the quantity of the drugs involved, with little if any attention paid to
the culpability of the offender. I raised this during the hearing, and at the
end of the oral arguments, I invited counsel to reflect on this and to submit
further arguments within a week if they had anything further to add. Both
counsel did so on 29 April 2015. Having considered the matter, I am satisfied
that in the circumstances of the present case the sentence imposed by the
District Judge was manifestly excessive. I therefore allow the appeal and
reduce the sentence to a term of imprisonment of 8 years for the reasons that
follow.

Background facts

3 The appellant was a housewife at the time of her arrest. She has three
children. On 6 or 7 September 2012, while the appellant was heavily pregnant
with her third child, her husband was arrested for a drug-related offence. On
or about 18 October 2012, the appellant received a call on her husband’s
handphone, her husband being in prison at the time. The caller was a person
known as “Muru”. Later that day, Muru delivered some drugs to the appellant
for sale, telling her that she would be contacted through her husband’s
handphone by persons wishing to take delivery of some of the drugs he had
passed to her. Muru told her to take her time to sell the drugs before paying
him for it.

4 Between 18 October and 5 November 2012 (which was the day she was arrested),
the appellant delivered or sold various quantities of drugs to six
individuals, identified only as “Bob”, “Kak”, “Kadir”, “M Rajan”, “Aja” and
“Sam”. Some of them paid for the drugs they took, while others did not. The
appellant claimed that she had received a total of $20 from all these
deliveries, and this was not challenged by the Prosecution.

5 The District Judge sentenced the appellant to 11 years’ imprisonment (see
_Public Prosecutor v Vasentha d/o Joseph_ [2014] SGDC 315 (“GD”)). He
considered that deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration in such
cases. He also relied on the table of sentencing precedents for cases
involving trafficking or importation of diamorphine which was set out in
_Public Prosecutor v Kovalan a/l Mogan_ [2013] SGDC 395 (“ _Kovalan_ ”). In
particular, it was observed that in _Kovalan_ at [24], the range of sentences
for cases involving 8–10g of diamorphine was between 10–20 years’ imprisonment
and 7–15 strokes of the cane. He found that the appellant’s mitigation plea
was not exceptional. While he accepted that the appellant was a “first
offender” insofar as she did not have any past convictions, he concluded that
she was an “experienced offender” given that she had been selling drugs to
various people prior to her arrest (GD at [22]). He considered this a
“significant aggravating factor” (GD at [25]). He acknowledged, however, that
the Prosecution had no evidence to suggest that the appellant was part of a
syndicate (GD at [25]). The District Judge also gave little weight to the fact
that the appellant had pleaded guilty and “assisted the police” in light of
the fact that she had been caught red-handed with the drugs in her possession
(GD at [23]). He nevertheless accepted that the period of nine months that the
appellant spent in remand before she made bail should be “factored into the
sentence imposed” (GD at [24]).

6 As I have noted above, the appellant appealed against the sentence on the
basis that it was manifestly excessive.

The drug problem and the legal framework in place to restrict the supply of
controlled drugs

7 The drug problem is a scourge. The binds of addiction make it difficult for
those ensnared to break free. Singapore has recognised the evils of drug abuse
and enacted legislation to address the problem since the early part of the
last century. For instance, the Straits Settlement Deleterious Drugs Ordinance
(No 27 of 1910) made it an offence to import, administer or possess any
deleterious drugs such as diamorphine. In more recent times, legislation such
as the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (No 7 of 1951) and the Drugs (Prevention of
Misuse) Act (Cap 154, 1970 Rev Ed) were passed to address the drug problem.
These two pieces of legislation were the predecessors of the MDA which was
enacted in 1973.

8 At the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs Bill in 1973, Mr Chua Sian
Chin, then Minister for Home Affairs, explained that the tough penalties for
traffickers were there by design in order to suppress the drug trade. He said
(_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (16 February 1973) vol 32
at cols 415–420):

The ill-gotten gains of the drug traffic are huge. The key men operating
behind the scene are ruthless and cunning and possess ample funds. They do
their utmost to push their drugs through. Though we may not have drug-
trafficking and drug addiction to the same degree as, for instance, in the
United States, we have here some quite big-time traffickers and their pedlars
moving around the Republic selling their evil goods and corrupting the lives
of all those who succumb to them.

_They and their trade must be stopped. To do this effectively, heavy penalties
have to be provided for trafficking_. ...

... The existing law on dangerous drugs provides for the offence of
trafficking, but there is no distinction as regards the age of the person to
whom the drugs are sold. The penalties for the offence of trafficking in the
existing law are $10,000 or five years, or both. These penalties are obviously
totally inadequate as deterrents ...

Government views the present situation with deep concern. _To act as an
effective deterrent, the punishment provided for an offence of this nature
must be decidedly heavy. We have, therefore, expressly provided minimum
penalties and the rotan for trafficking_. However, we have not gone as far as
some countries which impose the death penalty for drug trafficking.

...

Finally, I wish to state quite categorically here that whatever heavy
penalties that are being provided in this Bill, they by themselves are not
sufficient to solve the drug problem in Singapore. We shall require all the
co-operation from parents, teachers, doctors, social workers and, in fact, the
whole public if we are to successfully meet that problem. It is going to be an
uphill task all the way. Of course, _highly deterrent laws against drug
traffickers will help us tremendously in our fight against drug trafficking
and addiction_.

[emphasis added]

9 In 1975, the MDA was amended to provide even harsher penalties for drug
traffickers. The prescribed minimum and maximum sentences for trafficking in
controlled drugs were adjusted upwards; and the death penalty was introduced
for trafficking in more than 30g of morphine or 15g of diamorphine (commonly
known as “heroin”). At the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment)
Bill, Mr Chua Sian Chin explained the rationale behind the changes as follows
(_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (20 November 1975) vol 34
at cols 1381–1382):

Heroin is one of the most potent and dangerous drugs. In the first half of
1974 only nine out of 1,793 drug abusers arrested consumed heroin. In the
corresponding period this year 1,007 out of 1,921 drug abusers arrested
consumed heroin. Thus the number of heroin abusers arrested increased by
almost 112 times in 12 months. This is an explosive increase by any reckoning.
Equally significant is the fact that the number of traffickers arrested for
dealing in heroin had also increased from six in the first half of 1974 to 26
in the corresponding period this year.

_These statistics show clearly that existing penalties under the Misuse of
Drugs Act, 1973, have not been a sufficient deterrence to traffickers._ …

Clause 13 of this Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the Second Schedule of the
Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, so that the death penalty will be imposed for the
unauthorised manufacture of morphine and heroin irrespective of amounts
involved. The death penalty will also be imposed for the unauthorised import,
export or trafficking of more than 30 grammes of morphine or more than 15
grammes of heroin.

[emphasis added]

10 Later, in 1977, Mr Chua Sian Chin clarified that the harsh penalties for
drug traffickers were underpinned by considerations of both general and
specific deterrence: _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (27
May 1977) vol 37 at cols 34–35.

11 The MDA was subsequently amended several times to provide stiffer penalties
for trafficking in controlled drugs such as cannabis mixture, methamphetamine
(commonly known as “ice”) and ketamine (see Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act
(Act 40 of 1993); Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act (Act 20 of 1998) and Misuse
of Drugs (Amendment) Act (Act 2 of 2006)). These amendments were necessitated
by changes in the local and global drug situation (including the emergence of
new synthetic drugs) and they seek to ensure that we can continue to
effectively curb drug abuse and drug trafficking in Singapore.

12 A “key pillar” of our drug control strategy has been to restrict the supply
of controlled drugs by “eradicating trafficking activities through tough laws
and robust enforcement” (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
Report_ (15 September 2010) vol 87 at col 1163 (Wong Kan Seng, Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)). To that end, Singapore has adopted a
strong deterrent stance in relation to drug trafficking. This remains true
notwithstanding the amendments to the MDA in 2012 which give the courts the
discretion to spare a drug courier from the death penalty under certain
limited circumstances. In the ministerial statement introducing this change,
Mr Teo Chee Hean, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs,
emphasised the continuing need for deterrence: _Singapore Parliamentary
Debates, Official Report_ (9 July 2012) vol 89.

13 The point was reiterated at the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs
(Amendment) Bill in 2012 (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_
(12 November 2012) vol 89), where Mr Teo Chee Hean said:

Those who trade in illegal drugs are still attracted by the huge financial
gains to be made, and deterring them requires the strictest enforcement
coupled with the severest of penalties.

14 The legal framework under the MDA undoubtedly reflects the strong stance
taken by Singapore against drugs in the severe punishments provided for drug
trafficking. The MDA sentencing framework with regard to trafficking rests
primarily on the _type_ and the _quantity_ of the drugs. As I explain below,
both factors reflect the extent of harm that may be caused by the distribution
of the drugs in question and this goes towards the seriousness of the offence.

15 The First Schedule of the MDA classifies the various _types_ of controlled
drugs into Classes A, B and C based on their relative harmfulness. A similar
three-tier classification system can be found in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971
(c 38) (UK) (“the UK Act”). At the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs Bill
in 1970, Mr James Callaghan, the then United Kingdom Secretary of State for
the Home Department, explained the rationale underlying the classification
system in the UK Act as follows (United Kingdom, House of Commons,
_Parliamentary Debates_ (25 March 1970) vol 798 at col 1453):

I want now to make a few comments about Clause 2 and Schedule 2. These
establish a three-tier classification of drugs for the purposes of the
penalties provided by Clause 25 and Schedule 4. The object here is to make, so
far as possible, a more sensible differentiation between drugs. _It will
divide them according to their accepted dangers and harmfulness in the light
of current knowledge and it will provide for changes to be made in
classification in the light of new scientific knowledge_. ... [emphasis added]

16 The classification system was eventually introduced in the UK Act that was
enacted in 1971. The rationale offered by Mr Callaghan is instructive given
that the three-tier classification system in our MDA appears to have been
modelled on the UK Act (as was the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 (No
116 of 1975) (see New Zealand Law Commission, _Controlling and Regulating
Drugs: A Review of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975_ (NZLC R122, 2011) (President:
The Honourable Justice Grant Hammond) at pp 150–151)) which, in turn, was
guided by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (30 March 1961) 520 UNTS 151
(entered into force 13 December 1964). At the second reading of the MDA, Mr
Chua Sian Chin explained that (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
Report_ (16 February 1973) vol 32 at col 415):

Control has been brought in line with those in force in other countries
closely concerned with the spread of the addictive use of such drugs within
their own countries and the increased international traffic which supplies
such demands. The different categories of control as recommended by the United
Nations have been incorporated into this Bill.

17 Diamorphine is a Class A controlled drug under the MDA. This classification
reflects the fact that diamorphine is “one of the most potent and dangerous
drugs” (see [9] above). Under s 33 read with the Second Schedule of the MDA, a
person convicted for trafficking in diamorphine may be punished as follows:

Net weight  |  Minimum sentence |  Maximum sentence  
---|---|---  
Below 10g |  5 years and 5 strokes  |  20 years and 15 strokes  
10g to not more than 15g |  20 years and 15 strokes |  30 years or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes  
More than 15g |  Death (subject to s 33B of the MDA)  
  
  

18 It is evident from this table that aside from the harmfulness of the drug
in question, which is reflected in its classification, the other key factor
that affects the prescribed sentences for a trafficking charge under the MDA
is its quantity. The parliamentary debates shed some light on the rationale
behind the significance of weight. In particular, the response of Mr Teo Chee
Hean to questions and concerns raised by parliamentarians at the debates on
the amendments to the MDA in 2012 is instructive (_Singapore Parliamentary
Debates, Official Report_ (14 November 2012) vol 89):

Sir, when Parliament sat in 1975 to consider the drug problem, they were faced
with a serious drug situation which was threatening to overwhelm Singapore.
_They weighed the damage that drugs and those who traffic in drugs were doing
to our society. They decided to institute tougher laws and penalties, coupled
with strong enforcement_.

Severe penalties were introduced, including the mandatory death penalty for
those trafficking significant amounts of drugs. _Even though the penalties
were severe, they were instituted in a measured and calibrated way, with only
those convicted of trafficking substantial amounts of drugs subject to the
mandatory death penalty_. In the case of heroin, for example, the threshold
amount for capital punishment is set at 15 grams of pure diamorphine. This may
not sound like very much, but it is, in fact, equivalent to the pure
diamorphine content of some 2,200 straws of heroin, with a current street
value of $66,000. _This is enough to supply one straw per day to more than 300
addicts for a week_.

[emphasis added]

19 It is obvious that the quantity of drugs (measured in terms of _net_
weight) that has been trafficked would have a direct correlation with the
degree of harm to the society: see _Ong Ah Chuan and another v Public
Prosecutor_ [1979-1980] SLR(R) 710 (“ _Ong Ah Chuan_ ”) at [38]; _Yong Vui
Kong v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ [2010] 3 SLR 489 at [112];
quantity therefore serves as a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the
offence.

20 Aside from the type and quantity of the drugs, there are some other factors
that may affect the prescribed sentences for a trafficking offence. Section
33(4A) and (4B) of the MDA provide enhanced punishments for repeat
traffickers, and traffickers who direct their activities to young or
vulnerable persons, but they do not arise in the present case.

21 The MDA thus prescribes the minimum and maximum sentences based on the type
and quantity of the drugs involved and for these to be enhanced in certain
circumstances. Subject to these statutory limits, the sentencing discretion
remains with the courts. In that light, I turn to consider the sentencing
precedents.

The sentencing precedents

22 At the hearing before me, both parties relied substantially on the
sentencing precedents to argue that the sentence imposed on the appellant was
or was not manifestly excessive. The Prosecution concentrated on the quantity
of drugs involved and relied on the range of sentences imposed in cases that
involved similar quantities. The appellant, on the other hand, argued that the
facts pertaining to her culpability for the offence in this case were so far
removed from those in the precedent cases that the sentences imposed in those
cases could not have been a guide to what might have been appropriate in this
case.

23 In my judgment, the quantity of drugs involved in a trafficking charge will
inevitably have a strong bearing on the sentence to be imposed in any given
case. I have explained earlier at [19] that the quantity of the drugs will
usually be proportionate to the harm and thus serves as a reliable indicator
of the seriousness of the offence. However, the quantity of drugs cannot be
the _only_ consideration when determining the appropriate sentence to be
imposed in any given case. This has been acknowledged in several High Court
decisions, even though some of the earlier cases appear to have placed less
emphasis on the offender’s culpability: see for example _Public Prosecutor v
Ang Soon Huat_ (Criminal Case No 34 of 1987, unreported), where the High Court
observed that:

... the gravity of the offence of drug trafficking lay not in the personal
circumstances in which the offender committed the offence, like in many other
offences, but simply in the amount that was trafficked ... Therefore it must
follow, that in the ordinary case where there are no exceptional circumstances
affecting the offender’s conduct, the sentence should be proportionate to the
gravity of the offence, which is the quantity of the drugs that is being
trafficked in. [original emphasis omitted]

24 This passage was cited with approval by Yong Pung How CJ in _Public
Prosecutor v Hardave Singh s/o Gurcharan Singh_ [2003] SGHC 237 at [15]. It
has also been cited in numerous District Court decisions which tended to focus
on the portion of the _dictum_ that emphasised the need for the sentence to be
proportionate to the quantity of the drugs (see, _eg_ , _Koh Bak Kiang v
Public Prosecutor_ [2008] SGDC 18 (“ _Koh Bak Kiang_ ”) at [15]). It should be
noted, however, that the principle is stated as being applicable only “in the
ordinary case where there are no exceptional circumstances affecting the
offender’s conduct”. More recently, Chan Sek Keong CJ in _Jeffery bin Abdullah
v Public Prosecutor_ [2009] 3 SLR(R) 414 (“ _Jeffery_ ”) at [7] accepted the
view of the learned editors of _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_
(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at pp 638–639 that the following sentencing factors
will generally be relevant when sentencing an offender for drug trafficking:

(a) the quantity of the drug in the possession of the offender;

(b) the type of drug;

(c) the duration and sophistication in planning and carrying out of the
offence; and

(d) the relative levels of participation where more than one offender is
involved and there are accomplices.

25 In my judgment, this is significant for its acknowledgement that the nature
and extent of the offender’s role will be relevant to the sentence and some
cases have on the basis of _Jeffery_ taken this into account when deciding on
the appropriate sentence (see _Public Prosecutor v Norhisham Bin Mohamad
Dahlan_ [2010] SGDC 310 (“ _Norhisham_ ”) at [16]-[17]; _Kovalan_ at
[17]–[19]).

26 Despite this, there has remained a tendency for the lower courts to use a
single dominant point of reference – namely, the quantity of diamorphine – to
derive the applicable range of sentences. _Kovalan_ , which the Prosecution
relied substantially on, is an example of this. There, the district judge said
as follows at [24]:

I had also considered the sentences imposed in previous reported cases that
involved trafficking or importation of diamorphine of substantial amounts [see
the table below] and having done so, I noted the following:

\- for cases involving more than 5 grams and less than 8 grams of diamorphine,
the sentencing range is between 8 years to 12 years imprisonment and 6 to 12
strokes; and

\- for cases involving more than 8 grams and less than 10 grams of
diamorphine, the sentencing range is between 10 years to 20 years imprisonment
and 7 strokes to 15 strokes.

27 I note that the district judge in _Kovalan_ proceeded to carefully consider
the circumstances of each of the precedents that she sought to rely on (at
[25]–[28]) to justify the sentence imposed in that case. However, I doubt that
a range of sentences which seemingly emphasises the quantity of diamorphine is
ultimately helpful because it has the potential to divert attention away from
other relevant considerations. The sentences in cases that feature the same or
similar quantities of diamorphine may or may not be similar because sentencing
takes account of other circumstances, such as the offender’s personal
culpability or the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors.

28 The Prosecution accepted the broad proposition that all the circumstances
had to be considered in arriving at a just sentence. Nonetheless, it also
contended that a consideration of the relevant case law reveals a correlation
between the quantity of diamorphine and the length of the imprisonment term
imposed. My analysis, however, suggests that such a correlation is weak.
Having reviewed 27 cases where written grounds were issued and which involved
offenders who pleaded guilty to a trafficking charge involving less than 10g
of diamorphine, I found it useful to tabulate them as follows:

30 It is evident from this that beyond a general upward trend, the
relationship is less than clear. In particular, it appears that there can be a
wide range of sentences imposed for cases with the same or similar weight –
see, for example, the cases at or near 0.1g which feature sentences of between
5 and 10 years and those at or near 9.99g which feature sentences of between
12 and 15 years. Furthermore, the cases over a range of weights can have
relatively similar sentences. This is most obvious in the cases involving
quantities of between 3g and 6g where, except for one case, the sentences were
all within in a tight band of between 7½ and 9 years.

31 In my judgment, the actual correlation between the quantity of drugs
trafficked and the term of imprisonment that is imposed is somewhat weak and
this is precisely because the quantity of drugs is not the sole or overriding
sentencing consideration.

32 I can illustrate the broad point by reference to the decision in _Public
Prosecutor v Mohamed Yasin Bin Sutoh and another_ [2010] SGDC 354 (S/No 26 of
the table). There, the 1st accused person was asked by an acquaintance to pass
a bag to the 2nd accused person, and he obliged. The bag contained
diamorphine, which was subsequently analysed to be not less than 9.99g in
quantity. The 1st accused person had neither any “share in nor stood to
benefit from the transaction” (at [15]). In contrast, the 2nd accused person
admitted that he had intended to repackage the drugs into smaller packets to
be sold to his drug clients. Both accused persons pleaded guilty and were
sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 years. Only the 2nd accused person
was sentenced to 10 strokes of the cane; the 1st accused person was past the
permissible age limit for a sentence of caning to be imposed on him. While
both accused persons dealt with the identical quantity of drugs, they clearly
did not share the same level of culpability. In particular, their motives as
well as the nature of their involvement differed significantly. It is
unsurprising having regard to these differences that on appeal, the sentence
of the 1st accused person was reduced to 12 years’ imprisonment (Magistrate’s
Appeal No 279 of 2010, unreported).

33 Similarly, the sentences in _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Khaliq bin Mohammed
Shan_ [2010] SGDC 81 (“ _Khaliq_ ”) (S/No 2 of the table) and _Public
Prosecutor v Ong Nancy_ [2009] SGDC 398 (“ _Ong Nancy_ ”) (S/No 4 of the
table) were different even though the quantities were similar. _Khaliq_ and
_Ong Nancy_ involved quantities of 0.09g and 0.12g of diamorphine
respectively. Notwithstanding this, the accused in _Khaliq_ was sentenced to
10 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane whereas the accused in _Ong
Nancy_ was given the statutory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. The
difference, it seems, lay in the circumstances of the two cases (and
specifically, the antecedents of the two accused persons). The district judge
in _Khaliq_ found at [12] that the accused person had not been deterred from
carrying on his drug-related activities within a short time of being released
from prison, even though he had already been imprisoned twice for substantial
periods for drug-related offences (12 years and 2 months for a drug
trafficking charge in 1995, and 5 years for multiple drug charges in 2005).
Hence, on the facts of that case, the district judge considered that an
aggravated sentence was warranted. In contrast, the accused person in _Ong
Nancy_ had a prior conviction for drug trafficking that dated back almost 30
years (in 1979) when she was a juvenile and moreover, had never been sentenced
to imprisonment for more than 3 years. The district judge found that the
statutory minimum sentence was appropriate in the circumstances.

34 Hence, while I accept that there will generally be some correlation between
the quantity of the drugs involved and the severity of the punishment that is
imposed, it would not be sufficient to focus on the quantity alone as that
will only tell part of the story. The sentencing judge must have due regard to
all the circumstances of the case, and this would include the culpability of
the offender and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.

The culpability of the offender

35 It is clear that deterrence is the key sentencing consideration when
dealing with the offence of drug trafficking, and this has been recognised by
the courts on several occasions (see _Public Prosecutor v Tan Kiam Peng_
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 522 at [10]). However, an unyielding focus on deterrence must
not displace the need to ensure that the sentence meted out is one that fits
_both_ the offence and the offender. This has been repeatedly acknowledged:
see, for instance, _Ng Teng Yi Melvin v Public Prosecutor_ [2014] 1 SLR 1165
at [14]). In _Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor_ [2006] 4 SLR(R) 10, V K Rajah
J (as he then was) observed at [31] that “[d]eterrence must always be tempered
by proportionality in relation to the severity of the offence committed as
well as by the moral and legal culpability of the offender”.

36 More recently, I observed in _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v Public
Prosecutor_ [2014] 2 SLR 1028 at [21] that “[p]roportionality acts as a
counterbalance to the principles of deterrence, retribution and prevention in
the sentencing matrix”. As I noted in that case, for an offence of driving
whilst on a disqualification order, it would well have served the objectives
of deterrence and prevention to impose a lifetime ban on driving rather than a
ban of a shorter duration. However, the courts do not routinely do so; only
when they find that such a sentence is appropriate in light of the
circumstances of the case do they do so. Proportionality ensures that the
sentence is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence and this in turn
is affected not only by the harm caused by the offence but also by the
culpability of the offender (see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ [2007] 2
SLR(R) 814 at [33], citing Andrew von Hirsch, “Deservedness and Dangerousness
in Sentencing Policy” (1986) Crim L R 79 at p 85).

37 That being the general position, should a different rule apply for drug
traffickers? I see no reason for thinking that. It is true that the
legislature has provided minimum and maximum sentences, but beyond that, it
has left the actual sentence to the discretion of the sentencing judge. In
that context, it is not evident why or on what basis an entirely different
rule should apply to drug trafficking. Admittedly, the parliamentary debates
place a strong emphasis on the importance of deterrence but this does not mean
that the culpability of the offender is to be regarded as irrelevant.

38 To be fair, although the Prosecution submitted that the focus should be on
the quantity of diamorphine, it too accepted in the final analysis that the
culpability of an offender is a relevant sentencing consideration for a drug
trafficking charge. Indeed, in light of the foregoing, it would be difficult
to suggest otherwise.

39 Drug syndicates are often transnational criminal organisations with
individuals playing any of a number of different roles in the chain of
operations, from the mastermind to peddlers and couriers. It would be
illogical to treat all of them as equally culpable. This was implicitly
acknowledged in _Ramalingam Ravinthran v Attorney-General_ [2012] 2 SLR 49,
where the Court of Appeal examined the earlier case of _Thiruselvam s/o
Nagaratnam v Public Prosecutor_ [2001] 1 SLR(R) 362 and stated at [38] that:

... The evidence in that case showed that Thiruselvam had instructed
Katheraven to pay him the proceeds from the sale of the drugs upon the
successful delivery of those drugs. Thiruselvam was thus either Katheraven’s
controller or supplier in relation to the latter’s drug trafficking. If, in
this situation, Thiruselvam occupied a higher or more significant position in
the supply chain of illegal drugs, then his criminal activities would have
been more significant in terms of the potential harm caused to society. In
comparison, Katheraven would have been a mere courier. Thus, from a policy
perspective, Thiruselvam could be said to have been more culpable an offender
than Katheraven in the context of combating drug trafficking in Singapore.

40 Moreover, not all offenders performing the same role may be equally
culpable. It may be relevant, for instance, to have regard to such factors as
the offender’s motive. One who engages in drug trafficking activities for
personal gain would bear a higher degree of culpability than one who becomes
involved only because he was coerced or threatened into doing it, or was
exploited by virtue of his low intellectual ability or naivety. In line with
this, Chan Sek Keong CJ observed in _Zhao Zhipeng v Public Prosecutor_ [2008]
4 SLR(R) 879 at [37] that “motive affects the degree of an offender’s
culpability for sentencing purposes”. He went on to observe that “[p]ersons
who act out of pure self-interest and greed will rarely be treated with much
sympathy” while “those who are motivated by fear will usually be found to be
less blameworthy”. This was later endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Tan
Kheng Chun Ray v Public Prosecutor_ [2012] 2 SLR 437 at [17].

41 I should also mention the 2012 amendments to the MDA which introduced a
distinction between couriers and non-couriers. Specifically, the courts may
decide not to impose the death penalty on a courier when certain conditions
are met (see s 33B of the MDA). This does not arise in the present case, but
it bears noting in this context that couriers were recognised as having
relatively lower culpability than the “drug king pins” or “drug lords who
direct such couriers” (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_
(12 November 2012) vol 89 (Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and
Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs)).
This again is consistent with my earlier observation at [39] that the
offender’s culpability may vary according to his role. This is not to say that
couriers have low culpability; just that it may be lower than that of their
controllers and on this ground, may in the specified circumstances, gain them
a reprieve from the death penalty.

42 Hence, when it comes to sentencing for drug trafficking, it will be
important to have regard also to the culpability of the offender. This will
entail a consideration of other factors including the offender’s role and
involvement in the offence, his motive and the circumstances in which he came
to be involved in the commission of the offence at hand.

The appropriate benchmark sentence for trafficking in diamorphine

43 In light of the foregoing, I set out a framework with which to approach
sentencing for offenders convicted for trafficking in diamorphine in
quantities up to 9.99g. I should reiterate that the Prosecution had accepted
the relevance of examining the offender’s culpability and advanced a number of
factors to be incorporated in any sentencing framework.

44 In broad terms, I consider that sentencing should be approached in the
following way subject to any prescribed mandatory minimum or maximum sentence:

(a) because the quantity of the diamorphine reflects the degree of harm to the
society and is a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the offence, it will
provide a good starting point;

(b) after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing
judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on:

(i) the offender’s culpability; and

(ii) the presence of relevant aggravating or mitigating factors;

(c) lastly, the sentencing judge may, where appropriate, take into account the
time that the offender had spent in remand prior to the conviction either by
backdating the sentence or discounting the intended sentence.

The indicative starting points based on quantity

45 I should start by mentioning the considerations that I took into account in
deciding what should be the appropriate indicative starting points. The first
is that the maximum sentence is usually reserved for the “worse type of cases
falling within the prohibition” [original emphasis omitted], and the courts
would impose a sentence close to or fixed at the statutory maximum only if the
offender’s conduct is “among the worst conceivable for that offence”: _Angliss
Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 (“ _Angliss_ ”) at
[84] citing _Sim Gek Yong v Public Prosecutor_ [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at
[12]–[13]. The sentence must correspond to the seriousness of the offence, and
that requires an examination of not only the harm but also the culpability of
the offender and other relevant circumstances. The starting point is based
only on the quantity of diamorphine and, as the name suggests, leaves room for
the sentencing judge to adjust the sentence upwards in an appropriate case to
reflect the offender’s culpability as well as other aggravating circumstances.
As such, I do not fix the indicative starting point for those cases involving
9 to 9.99g of diamorphine at or close to the maximum sentence.

46 The second consideration is that the cases should generally utilise the
full spectrum of possible sentences. I also made this point in _Poh Boon Kiat
v Public Prosecutor_ [2014] 4 SLR 892 at [60]. It follows, therefore, that the
indicative starting points would span the range of possible sentences but stop
short of the statutory maximum sentence. The third consideration is that in
general, because of the importance of the degree of harm as a sentencing
consideration, the starting points should be broadly proportional to the
quantity of diamorphine (_ie_ , the greater the quantity, the higher the
sentence).

47 In my judgment, the indicative starting points on this basis, for first-
time offenders trafficking in diamorphine, which I have banded according to
the quantity, should be as follows:

Quantity |  Imprisonment |  Caning  
---|---|---  
Up to 3g |  5-6 years |  5-6 strokes  
3-5g |  6-7 years |  6-7 strokes  
5-7g |  7-8 years |  7-8 strokes  
7-8g |  8-9 years |  8-9 strokes  
8-9g |  10-13 years |  9-10 strokes  
9-9.99g |  13-15 years |  10-11 strokes  
  
  

48 These indicative starting points, which are based only on the quantity of
diamorphine, will then have to be adjusted, where appropriate, to reflect the
offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating
circumstances. In a case where no adjustment is necessary, the indicative
starting point may well be the appropriate sentence to be imposed. Further,
the indicative starting points are not rigid or inflexible categories, and the
sentencing judge may, in an appropriate case, depart from it. The precise
sentence to be imposed in each case would depend on the specific circumstances
of that case.

Adjustment for culpability

49 As I have indicated above, in order to assess the offender’s culpability,
the sentencing judge would have to consider his motive as well as the nature
and extent of his role and involvement in the drug trade. These are the
factors that were considered in _Norhisham_ (S/No 14 of the table) at [6] and
[16]-[17] and also in _Koh Bak Kiang_ at [23].

50 In my judgment, the inquiry into the offender’s culpability would require a
holistic assessment of all the circumstances. This may include such
considerations as whether special efforts were made to avoid detection (see,
_eg_ , _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Sohaili bin Mohamed Supri_ [2013] SGDC 289
(“ _Sohaili_ ”) (S/No 12 of the table) at [22]; as well as _Kovalan_ (S/No 23
of the table), where the district judge considered that it was appropriate to
increase the sentence given that the accused had tried to conceal the drugs to
avoid detection (at [19])).

51 Having regard to the past cases, I formulate a list of indicia for
assessing an offender’s culpability as follows:

Culpability |  Indicia  
---|---  
Higher |  • Directing or organising drug trade on a commercial scale (_eg_ , having regular clientele or offering wide variety of drugs) • Involving others in the operation whether by pressure, influence, intimidation or reward  • Being motivated by financial or other advantage, whether operating as part of a drug syndicate or alone (_eg_ , to sustain offender’s own drug habits) • Taking active steps to avoid detection of the offence   
Lower |  • Performing only a limited function under direction  • Being engaged by pressure, coercion and intimidation, or being involved through naivety and exploitation  
  
  

52 This is a non-exhaustive list that is merely illustrative and should be
developed with the accretion of our case law.

Adjustment for aggravating and mitigating factors

53 The next step in the sentencing process, having taken into account the
quantity of diamorphine and the culpability of the offender, would be to
adjust the sentence to reflect the aggravating and mitigating factors that
apply in the case at hand.

Aggravating factors

54 I start with the main circumstances that have been recognised by the courts
as aggravating in drug trafficking cases. These include:

(a) the presence of relevant antecedents;

(b) offences taken into consideration and the offender’s involvement in other
offences;

(c) the commission of an offence on bail;

(d) the attempt to conceal or dispose of evidence of the offence; and

(e) trafficking in a variety of drugs.

55 In light of the sentencing framework that I have outlined above, the
sentencing judge should be mindful to ensure that he assiduously avoids
double-counting factors. To give one example, it would not be appropriate to
have regard to the offender’s relevant antecedents _to the extent these have
already been taken into account_ in an enhanced sentencing regime that is
provided for by statute as is the case with ss 33A and 33(4A) of the MDA
pursuant to which the sentencing framework already provides for mandatory
enhanced penalties for recalcitrant abusers and repeat traffickers; and to
give another, it would not be appropriate to have regard to attempts to
conceal the evidence as a separate aggravating factor to the extent this has
already been considered in assessing the offender’s culpability. Subject to
these reservations, I make some observations on the common aggravating and
mitigating factors.

(1) Antecedents

56 The most common aggravating factor in drug trafficking cases is the
presence of relevant antecedents. This is not surprising given that many drugs
addicts will resort to related crimes in order to fund their habit. We have
seen a number of these cases in the courts (see, _eg_ , _Public Prosecutor v
Jamal s/o Mohamed Sha_ [2011] SGDC 252 (S/No 1 of the table) at [7] and [24];
_Public Prosecutor v Sali bin Mohd_ [2011] SGDC 194 (“ _Sali_ ”) at [3] and
[9]). Subject to the caveat noted in the preceding paragraph, this will be a
relevant consideration as it will signal, at the very least, a greater need
for specific deterrence.

(2) Offences taken into consideration and other offences

57 The accused may commonly consent to having other offences taken into
consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Consideration ought to be given
to whether this should result in the sentence being enhanced especially if the
offences were similar in nature to those being proceeded with: _Public
Prosecutor v BNN_ [2014] SGHC 7 at [48]–[49] citing _Public Prosecutor v Chow
Yee Sze_ [2011] 1 SLR 481 at [34]. Such offences may provide the context for
the offence of which the offender is being convicted and is to be sentenced
and it may show whether the offence was a “one-off” incident or part of a
pattern of criminality.

58 But what about offences for which charges were never brought? In _Angliss_
, the appellant was convicted of an offence for having illegally affixed a
halal certification mark on its food product without approval. The appellant
had no antecedents but admitted to at least one prior breach of the same
offence. The appellant argued that it should be punished as a first offender.
Rajah J rejected that contention and held that although that fact could not be
taken into consideration for the purposes of enhancing the sentence, the court
should not “turn a blind eye to the obvious” (_Angliss_ at [81]). In arriving
at this view, he referred to the decision of the English Court of Criminal
Appeal in _R v Twisse_ [2001] 2 Cr App R (S) 9 where the appellant who pleaded
guilty to supplying heroin also admitted that he had been dealing in heroin
for about nine months. Kennedy LJ there held that such matters may, to a
limited degree, be taken into account and he observed as follows at [7]-[8]:

If the prosecution can prove that a defendant has been acting as a supplier
over a substantial period of time, it can put the court in a position to
sentence properly in one of three ways: first, by charging a number of
offences of supplying or possession of drugs at different dates; or, secondly,
by charging the defendant with conspiracy to supply over a prescribed period;
or, thirdly, by charging him with being concerned in the supply of a
controlled drug over a specified period, contrary to section 4(3)(b) of the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

What, however, is important is that, if the indictment is not drawn as we have
suggested and the defendant does not ask for offences to be taken into
consideration, judges when sentencing should refrain from drawing inferences
as to the extent of the defendant's criminal activity, even if such inferences
are inescapable having regard, for example, to admissions made or equipment
found. In other words, a defendant charged with one offence of supply cannot
receive a more substantial sentence because it is clear to the court that he
has been trading for nine months:  _but the court is not require_ [_sic_] _to
blind itself to the obvious. If he claims that the occasion in question was an
isolated transaction, that submission can be rejected. He can be given the
appropriate sentence for that one offence without the credit he would receive
if he really were an isolated offender_.

[emphasis added]

59 This suggests that the fact that the offender was involved in criminal
activities for a period of time prior to his arrest can only be used to negate
the mitigating weight of the offender’s assertion that it was his first or
only offence (see _Louis Joseph Marie Gerard Tyack v Mauritius_ [2006] UKPC 18
at [21] and [31]). According to Lord Mance at [31], the offender “ _loses the
possibility of such mitigation_ as would have existed if he had committed no
more than an isolated slip” [emphasis added]. In my judgment, there is good
sense in this.

60 But V K Rajah JA (as he then was) refined the approach he took in _Angliss_
in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor_ [2005] 3
SLR(R) 1 saying as follows at [60]:

... The incident in question was to all intents and purposes a one-off episode
unlike the other known prosecutions in the Laroussi cluster of cases. I would
also suggest, for the future, that if the Prosecution intends to press for a
particularly deterrent sentence in relation to a consumption offence, it
should adduce evidence either through the Statement of Facts or otherwise of
the circumstances pertaining to the act of consumption.  _PP v Simmonds Nigel
Bruce_ is a helpful illustration. The Statement of Facts in that case makes it
abundantly clear that he was a confirmed drug addict. Such persons should
receive more severe sentences. While such persons are in literal terms first-
time offenders in the sense that they are facing the music for the first time,
_serious consideration ought to be given to whether they should receive a
sentence outside the general tariff_. If there is indeed convincing evidence
of repeated drug abuse and a history of flagrant disregard of the MDA, then
_it may only be appropriate that such offenders receive their just dessert in
the form of enhanced sentences_. In so far as such offenders are concerned,
one might even say cogently, that the ‘first-time offender’ label is a legal
misnomer. I realised that this is a distinction that the lower courts have not
always properly appraised or responded to. [emphasis added; original emphasis
omitted]

61 This passage suggests that the presence of convincing evidence of prior
drug abuse, even if there has been no conviction, can be taken into
consideration for the purposes of enhancing the sentence. I have reservations
over this.

62 In my judgment, an offender cannot be punished for conduct which has not
formed the subject of the charges brought against him; he can only be
sentenced for offences of which he has been convicted, either by trial or a
plea of guilt, and in doing so, regard may properly be had only to any other
charges which the accused has consented to being taken into consideration for
the purpose of sentencing.

(3) Reoffending on bail

63 Another common aggravating factor is when the offender has reoffended while
on bail (see, _eg_ , _Public Prosecutor v Liyakath Ali s/o Maideen_ [2008]
SGDC 216 (“ _Liyakath_ ”) (S/No 24 of the table) at [17]). Among other things,
this may indicate that the offender is not genuinely remorseful (see _Chen
Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor_ [2003] 2 SLR(R) 334 at [18]–[23]) and
warrants greater attention being placed on the need for specific deterrence.

(4) Trafficking in a variety of drugs

64 A number of recent District Court cases have treated the fact that the
offender was trafficking in a variety of drugs as an aggravating factor (see,
_eg_ , _Sohaili_ (S/No 12 of the table) at [12]; _Sali_ at [8], [13] and
[15]). However, there has been no clear articulation of _when_ or _why_ this
factor should operate to enhance the sentence.

65 Some of the cases seem to have accepted that the mere fact that a variety
of drugs has been found to be in the possession of the offender, for the
purpose of trafficking or otherwise, would suffice to constitute an
aggravating factor. In _Public Prosecutor v Azahari bin Saleh_ [2013] SGDC 300
(S/No 20 of the table), the offender pleaded guilty to four drug offences,
with three others taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The
district judge considered that the “sheer variety of the drugs found” was
itself an aggravating factor (at [13]). Similarly, the district judge in
_Sali_ said (at [8]) that she was “unable to ignore the fact that [the
offender] was dealing in three different kinds of drugs”, but she did not
explain why this was so.

66 Other cases appear to have approached the variety of drugs as evidence of
the offender’s culpability. In both _Public Prosecutor v Lim Loy Hock_ [2010]
SGDC 428 at [22] and _Public Prosecutor v Chai Kok Leong_ [2010] SGDC 229 at
[23], the variety of drugs was taken as evidence that the offender was “not a
naïve or inexperienced dealer of drugs” and “could not have been an amateur in
drug activities”. Similarly, the district judge in _Norhisham_ (S/No 14 of the
table) considered at [16] that the circumstances, including the quantity and
types of drug that the offender had in his possession, indicated that he had
been in the business of selling drugs prior to his arrest. The same reasoning
has been applied even to a courier (as opposed to a peddler) who was
apprehended with a variety of drugs. In _Public Prosecutor v Puvaneswaran
Chandran_ [2013] SGDC 251 (S/No 16 of the table), the district judge reasoned
at [10] that:

... With several bundles, containing a variety of Controlled Drugs in powder
(Heroin), pill (Ecstasy) and crystalline form (Ice), there was no reason to
put Mr Chandran (who was being punished with two Charges with another three
being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence) in the same
category as offenders who traffic in only one kind of drug (and thus face only
one Charge). Removing this link with culpability would perversely encourage
couriers to make the most of their runs, and we would be the worse for it.

67 In my judgment, a higher sentence for an offender who is trafficking in a
variety of drugs would be warranted where it can be reasonably inferred from
this, together with any other circumstances including the absence of any other
explanation, that there is a higher degree of sophistication in the offender’s
drug operations or that these exist on a larger scale or that he is reaching
out to a wider range of abusers. The cases have articulated this rationale in
different ways (_eg_ , that the offender is not a “naïve or inexperienced
dealer” or is able to cater or appeal to a wider group). In this regard, see
also: _HKSAR v Yim Hung Lui Ricky_ [2012] HKCU 333 at [11] and _R v Murphy_
[2011] CarswellMan 519 at [15] and [43]. In the final analysis, the question
for the sentencing judge in each case is whether it can safely be inferred
from this that the offender is more culpable or blameworthy such that this
should be reflected in a more onerous sentence.

(5) Attempt to conceal or dispose of evidence

68 This issue has arisen in at least two previous cases involving trafficking
in diamorphine. In _Jeffery_ (S/No 7 of the table), the CNB officers engaged
in a four-hour-long vehicle pursuit of the appellant and his co-accused. At
one point during the chase, the appellant tore open two plastic packets and
threw the contents out of the lorry before throwing the empty packets out as
well. He also put up a violent struggle to resist arrest. The appellant was
eventually arrested with two packets containing 0.41g and 0.43g of diamorphine
in his possession. The empty packets recovered were certified by the Health
Sciences Authority as being stained with diamorphine. The appellant was a
first offender. At first instance, he had been sentenced to 7 years’
imprisonment and 7 strokes of the cane. His appeal was dismissed. Chan Sek
Keong CJ expressly considered that the appellant was deserving of a higher
sentence (than he would otherwise have had) for having successfully emptied
the contents of the two packets in order to avoid being arrested with a higher
quantity of diamorphine (at [9]–[10]). This can be contrasted with the case of
_Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Rafiq Abdullah_ [2012] SGDC 200 (S/No 27 of the
table). In that case, the two accused persons tried to dispose of the drugs in
their possession by flushing them down the toilet when they realised that the
CNB officers were forcing their way into the flat. Their attempt was thwarted
by the CNB officers. The district judge in this case (unlike _Jeffery_) did
not explicitly take into account the attempt to dispose of the drugs as an
aggravating factor perhaps because it had not been successful.

69 In my judgment, an offender’s attempt to conceal or dispose of the evidence
of his offence, such as drugs or paraphernalia, in order to avoid prosecution
or a heavier sentence should be treated as an aggravating factor. The
rationale for this is not dissimilar to the basis on which attempts to conceal
the offence or prevent detection are treated as enhancing culpability. In
these cases, the accused is generally seeking to do one or more of a number of
things: to avoid detection in order to continue the unlawful conduct; to avoid
the full and proper consequences of his illicit actions; or to thwart law
enforcement efforts. The aggravating weight to be placed on this may depend on
the circumstances. Where the offender has successfully disposed of the drugs
in his possession, the sentencing judge must not speculate on the original
quantity of drugs and attempt to sentence the offender as if the drugs had not
been disposed of; but the judge would undoubtedly be entitled to enhance the
sentence having regard to this aggravating factor.

Mitigating factors

70 I turn to consider the mitigating factors that are frequently raised in
drug trafficking cases. These include:

(a) the admission of guilt;

(b) the cooperation accorded to the authorities in their investigation;

(c) the offender’s mental condition; and

(d) the exceptional hardship that the offender’s family would suffer as a
result of the conviction.

(1) Pleading guilty

71 It is well accepted that an admission of guilt that reflects genuine
remorse is a mitigating factor. However, the courts have frequently given
little weight to the offender’s plea of guilty in cases where the offender has
been caught red-handed and has little choice but to plead guilty. In most drug
trafficking cases, given the presumptions in the MDA, an offender caught red-
handed with the drugs in his possession will plead guilty. The courts have
generally been reluctant in such cases to give significant mitigating weight
to the plea of guilty: see, _eg_ , _Ong Nancy_ at [14]; _Koh Bak Kiang_ at
[20]. Mitigating weight should only be given in deserving cases where it is
clear that the admission of guilt was genuinely made out of remorse (see
_Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ [2007] 2 SLR(R)
334 at [54]).

(2) Cooperation with authorities

72 One good way to demonstrate the offender’s remorse, aside from pleading
guilty at the first available opportunity, would be to cooperate fully with
the authorities in their investigations. The relevance and weight that should
be given to the offender’s cooperation with the authorities in their
investigations would depend on the circumstances of the case. Nevertheless,
the past cases do provide some guidance.

73 The courts have generally considered that the offender’s cooperation is not
a strong mitigating factor where there is overwhelming evidence against the
offender: _Chia Kah Boon v Public Prosecutor_ [1999] 2 SLR(R) 1163 at [12];
_Public Prosecutor v Lim Hoon Choo_ [1999] 3 SLR(R) 803 at [16]. As I have
noted above, this applies with even greater force to drug trafficking cases in
the light of the presumption. On the other hand, substantial mitigating weight
may be given in cases where the offender extends his cooperation beyond his
own confession. In _Public Prosecutor v Wong Jia Yi_ [2003] SGDC 53 (“ _Wong
Jia Yi_ ”), the accused pleaded guilty to a drug trafficking charge. In
deciding the appropriate sentence, the district judge took into account the
fact that she “co-operated fully with the police, even to the extent of
providing information as to her drug source”: _Wong Jia Yi_ at [36].
Similarly, the district judge in _Koh Bak Kiang_ at [20] gave substantial
mitigating weight to the fact that the accused had cooperated with the
authorities and was willing to be a witness for the prosecution in the trial
against his accomplice.

(3) Mental condition

74 An offender’s mental condition may operate as a mitigating factor in a drug
trafficking case. But the sentencing judge must guard against the possibility
that offender is seeking in truth to escape the legal consequences of his
offence by pretending to suffer from some form of mental condition (see
_Public Prosecutor v Goh Lee Yin and another appeal_ [2008] 1 SLR(R) 824 at
[2]). Medical evidence must be adduced to prove not only the existence and
nature of the medical condition affecting the offender but also the causal
connection with the offence. If the offender cannot establish that there is a
causal connection between the mental condition and the commission of the
offence, then the offender ought to be sentenced in accordance with the usual
sentencing principles and benchmarks (see _Ng So Kuen Connie v Public
Prosecutor_ [2003] 3 SLR(R) 178 at [58]). In this connection, it has been said
that general deterrence may be accorded full weight in circumstances where the
mental condition is “not serious” or “not causally related to the commission
of the offence” and the offence is a serious one (see _Public Prosecutor v
Chong Hou En_ [2015] 3 SLR 222 at [24]; _Lim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor_
[2014] 4 SLR 1287 at [28]).

(4) Exceptional hardship to offender’s family

75 It is well settled that, except in the most exceptional circumstances,
hardship to the offender’s family has very little, if any, mitigating value:
_Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 (“ _Jenny_ ”) at
[11]; _Public Prosecutor v Yue Mun Yew Gary_ [2013] 1 SLR 39 at [67]–[68].
Each case will have to be decided on its own facts, but the past cases have
shown that the threshold is a very high one.

76 It is oft-said that drug trafficking is a highly rational and calculated
crime (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (12 November
2012) vol 89 (Christopher de Souza, Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit
Timah)), and the motive is no more than “cold calculated greed” (see _Ong Ah
Chuan_ at [39]). An offender who takes this course runs the risk that his
actions might cause severe hardship to his family. But this is the inevitable
result of the offender’s own acts and he must then face those consequences.

The appropriate sentence in the present appeal

77 I now turn to the appropriate sentence in this case. In accordance with the
sentencing framework set out above, the first step is to ascertain the
starting point based on the quantity of diamorphine involved. Since the
present case involves 8.98g of diamorphine, the indicative starting point
would be within the range of 10-13 years’ imprisonment. As the quantity
involved in this case is at the high end of the range, I take as an indicative
starting point a sentence of 12 years’ and 9 months’ imprisonment.

78 The next step is to consider whether it is necessary to adjust the sentence
according to the culpability of the offender. In assessing the culpability of
an offender, a sentencing judge can only proceed on the evidence that is
before him. The sentencing judge may draw inferences based on the
circumstances, but he is not entitled to speculate. It is therefore imperative
for the Prosecution to ensure that the key facts that are necessary to
illustrate the offender’s culpability are included in the statement of facts.

79 In the present case, the evidence suggests that the appellant bore a
relatively low degree of culpability. The Prosecution conceded that there was
no evidence that the appellant was acting as part of a drug syndicate (GD at
[25]). It also appears that there was little sophistication in the appellant’s
operations – she had merely delivered the drugs to the six individuals at
“pre-arranged locations” (GD at [22]). The Prosecution submitted that the
appellant was not coerced into drug trafficking. But that misses the point.
The evidence before me points to the conclusion that the appellant had been
exploited by Muru to act as his peddler. This was shortly after the
appellant’s husband had been arrested when she was heavily pregnant.

80 I am not persuaded by the Prosecution’s contention that the appellant has a
higher degree of culpability just because she had sold or delivered drugs to
six persons prior to her arrest and may have continued to do so if she had not
been apprehended. While I acknowledge that the appellant was tasked to sell or
deliver the drugs that were handed to her by Muru, this cannot be viewed in
isolation. The appellant’s unchallenged position was that she had received no
more than $20 for the drugs that she had sold or delivered. She was also not a
drug addict herself. So there is nothing at all to suggest that she was doing
this in order to finance a drug habit or anything else for that matter.
Indeed, there appears to be no reason why she would have done this except for
Muru’s exploitation of her naivety. In this regard, there was evidence before
me to indicate that she was a person of low intellect. In my judgment, the
appellant’s culpability, having regard to her role, her motives, her
intelligence and her personal circumstances, is relatively low. Indeed, I
regard hers as an exceptional case in this regard. I am therefore satisfied
that the circumstances in this case warrant a significant reduction from the
indicative starting point. In my judgment, the appropriate adjustment would be
to reduce the indicative starting sentence of 12 years and 9 months to a term
of 9 years. The effect of this adjustment is to bring the appellant down a
band (in terms of the table of starting points at [47] above) on account of
the exceptional circumstances. There is no precise formula or science to this.
Rather, it is a matter of judgment as to what the appropriate adjustment
should be.

81 I next consider if there is a need to make adjustments for aggravating or
mitigating factors. In my judgment, there are no relevant aggravating factors
in this case. With respect, I disagree with the District Judge’s finding that
the appellant’s prior involvement in drugs should be considered as a
“significant aggravating factor” (GD at [25]). I have explained at [62] why
such circumstances would not _per se_ constitute an aggravating factor, even
though they may negate the mitigating weight of the offender’s assertion that
he was a first-time offender. In this regard, I agree with the District Judge
that the appellant is a “first offender” only in the sense that she did not
have any antecedents (GD at [22]) and I accordingly give no weight to this.
However, as I have explained earlier, I do not consider that the fact that the
appellant had delivered or sold drugs to six individuals prior to her arrest,
when taken with the totality of the evidence, suggests that the appellant is
of a higher level of culpability. It is important to bear in mind that the
assessment as to the culpability of the offender must be a holistic one and
for the reasons outlined in the previous paragraph, I do not think that is an
aggravating factor in the present context.

82 I move to the mitigating factors. For a start, I would give some weight to
the fact that the appellant had cooperated with the authorities in their
investigations. In particular, I note that the appellant had disclosed that
she had previously sold or delivered drugs to six individuals even though she
need not have mentioned this. In fact, but for her admission of this fact,
there is nothing to indicate that investigations would have uncovered this. In
my judgment, this is an indication of genuine remorse. The Prosecution, I
note, accepted this.

83 However, I find that no weight should be given to the appellant’s
contention that she was suffering from an “adjustment disorder” at the time of
the offence. This contention was not raised before the District Judge. Before
me, the appellant sought to rely on the report of Dr Subhash Gupta from the
Institute of Mental Health dated 14 January 2015 (“the IMH Report”). I observe
that the medical assessment for the report was done more than _two years_
after the commission of the offence. In any case, it is evident from the IMH
Report that the adjustment disorder had _no_ causal connection with the
commission of the offence. In that sense, this case is similar to _Idya
Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ [2014] 1 SLR
756, where I observed at [40]–[41] that the “Adjustment Disorder with
Depressed Mood” had no causal connection with the offence and therefore could
not be considered as a mitigating factor.

84 I am also unpersuaded by the appellant’s argument that the District Judge
failed to give adequate weight to her “unique and exceptional circumstances
and personal mitigating factors”. The appellant’s argument revolved primarily
around the fact that her husband is in prison, and they have three young
children. However, the present case is not different from past cases such as
_Jenny_ at [11]–[12] and _Public Prosecutor v Perumal s/o Suppiah_ [2000] 2
SLR(R) 145 at [23] where the courts have declined to accept similar
circumstances as sufficiently exceptional to be given any mitigating weight. I
agree with those decisions, and on the present facts, I see no reason to
differ.

85 In the circumstances, there is only a need to make a modest adjustment on
account of the additional mitigating factor that I have referred to at [82]
above. In my judgment, this can be given effect by reducing the term of 9
years by a further 3 months to yield a total of 8 years and 9 months.

86 I turn to whether the sentence should take into account the nine months
that the appellant spent in remand. I note that See Kee Oon JC had, in the
recent case of _Public Prosecutor v Sivanantha Danabala_ [2015] SGHC 154,
backdated the sentence to the date of arrest to take into account the period
spent in remand even though there was a “break” in the period of custody. He
considered that it was necessary in that case so as to ensure that the accused
was not excessively punished (at [42]). I agree that the time spent in remand
should not be disregarded simply because the accused was granted bail. To hold
otherwise would disincentivise an accused person from seeking to make bail
once a substantial time has been spent in remand and that seems wrong in
principle. In the present case, the Prosecution accepted that the period in
which the appellant spent in remand could be taken into account and I agree
because it is only fair. I accordingly make a further reduction of 9 months
resulting in a final sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment.

87 Finally, as a check of consistency, I consider the term of 8 years that I
have arrived at in the context of the earlier cases involving similar
quantities of diamorphine, namely _Public Prosecutor v Ayup Khan s/o Muzaffa
Khan_ [2010] SGDC 503 (“ _Ayup Khan_ ”), _Kovalan_ and _Liyakath_
(respectively S/Nos 22, 23 and 24 of the table). The accused in _Ayup Khan_
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for trafficking in
8.17g of diamorphine. Another charge of drug trafficking was taken into
consideration. The accused intended to repack the drugs in straws for the
purpose of sale and he expected to make a profit of $2,000 from it (at [5]).
The accused had also been selling diamorphine for several months prior to his
arrest (at [5]). The district judge found that the accused was a “recalcitrant
offender who had scant regard for the law” in light of the fact that he had
re-offended while he was out on bail (at [15]). After examining the long list
of antecedents, the district judge noted that the accused had “graduated to
trafficking for profit” and reoffended within less than 2 years after he had
been released from 7 years’ preventive detention (at [16]). The district judge
did give weight to the accused’s plea of guilt and cooperation with the
authorities.

88 In _Kovalan_ , the accused was sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment and 10
strokes of the cane for trafficking in 8.23g of diamorphine. Based on the
statement of facts, the accused had agreed to deliver the drugs from Malaysia
into Singapore for a price. He concealed the drugs in the side cover of the
motorcycle and rode it into Singapore. He later removed the drugs and placed
it into a “KFC” box and then in a “KFC” plastic bag, which he then passed to
his co-accused. The district judge considered that the offence was “well-
planned and well-executed” (at [18]), and that there was nothing exceptional
about the accused’s personal mitigating factors (at [30]–[32]). The district
judge noted that while the accused was harassed by “loansharks” for his debts,
the accused had neither been forced nor threatened by them to make the
delivery. Instead, the accused had chosen to do so “in order to clear his
debt” (at [32]). Hence, the district judge did not give this much weight.

89 As for _Liyakath_ , the accused pleaded guilty to five drug-related charges
and consented to having another seven drug-related charges taken into
consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Out of the five proceeded
charges, two of them were for trafficking in diamorphine (9.04g and 7.85g
respectively) and one was for trafficking in buprenorphine, a Class A
controlled drug. The accused was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment and 10
strokes of the cane for trafficking in 9.04g of diamorphine. The district
judge took into account the fact that the accused had re-offended while on
bail which demonstrated his “continuing attitude of disobedience of the law”
(at [17]). Further, the district judge considered the accused’s previous drug-
related antecedents, and the fact that he had re-offended very shortly after
he had been released from prison (at [18]–[19]). The district judge also noted
that there were a substantial number of drug-related charges taken into
consideration for purpose of sentencing (at [20]).

90 The circumstances in the present case are far removed from each of the
three cases that I have examined above. The differences are obvious and
require no further elaboration. I need only say that, in light of the
circumstances, the sentence in the present case should be markedly lower than
those imposed in _Ayup Khan_ , _Kovalan_ and _Liyakath_ because fairness
demands that those who are less culpable are punished less severely. In that
light, I am satisfied that the sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment is fair and
just.

Conclusion

91 For these reasons, I allow the appeal and reduce the sentence of
imprisonment to a term of 8 years.
