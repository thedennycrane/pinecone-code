Ang Cheng Hock J:

Introduction

1 This is a case where the first defendant, who is alleged to have been the
sole nominee director and shareholder of the plaintiff in respect of a company
incorporated in Singapore, faces a claim for the recovery of moneys that had
been transferred out of the company’s bank account to the tune of
approximately US$1m. Despite the advantage of anonymity they can provide, the
risks in such nominee arrangements are quite clear and the trust reposed in
the nominee can often be easily exploited in a variety of ways, especially for
wrongful financial gain. As I will detail, this judgment serves as a
cautionary tale for those who engage such nominees.

Facts

The parties

2 The plaintiff is a British citizen who resides in London, United Kingdom. He

On or about 8 March 2017, the first defendant contacted Mr Thomas Jackson and
offered her services. 8

which provided company incorporation, corporate secretarial, and nominee
director and shareholder services. 11

##### Foot Note 11

TJ’s AEIC at [4]–[6].

Mr Jackson resides in the United Kingdom.

6 Mr Jackson suggested the use of the first defendant as a nominee shareholder
and director to one of DMB’s clients, who wanted to set up a company in Dubai,
United Arab Emirates. Eventually, the first defendant was given the
assignment. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with DMB. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

Defendant’s Bundle (“DB”) 6; Transcript, 25 November 2020, p 27 lines 5–8.

She travelled to Dubai to incorporate the company as instructed. This
assignment was completed in or around June 2018, and the first defendant
ceased being a director and shareholder of the Dubai company. The first
defendant was paid for her nominee services.

7 In early June 2018, the first defendant approached Mr Jackson for a personal
loan of €5,000. 13

##### Foot Note 13

PB 529.

Mr Jackson declined to extend a loan, but offered instead to look out for any
new assignments as a nominee. 14

8 By 2018, the plaintiff had been acquainted with Mr Jackson for a number of
years. While he was working with SafeCharge International Group Limited
(“SafeCharge”), an IT service management company specialising in providing
e-commerce payment solutions, the plaintiff had recommended various clients of
his to DMB for its corporate services, including nominee services. 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

P’s AEIC at [12]–[14].

The plaintiff also provided consultancy services on his own to various clients
who needed advice on setting up e-commerce businesses.

9 At around this time, the plaintiff wanted to set up an e-commerce business
involving an online platform for the direct sale and marketing of health and
beauty products to consumers. It was to be a virtual “market place”, where
products from Europe and the United States were to be sold, mainly targeted at
Asian consumers, particularly from China. The kinds of products sold would
include anti-wrinkle creams, moisturisers, weight-loss supplements and the
like. 16

##### Foot Note 16

×

P’s AEIC at [16].

The plaintiff’s plan was to call the online platform “Eat Pray Shop”. 17

##### Foot Note 17

10 The plaintiff discussed his business plan with Mr Jackson. He wanted Mr
Jackson and DMB to handle the corporate managerial and secretarial aspects of
his new business. 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

P’s AEIC at [19].

He also wanted the use of a nominee shareholder and director for the Eat Pray
Shop companies he was going to set up. This was because he wanted to keep his
involvement with the new business private, so that he would not be seen as
competing with his clients from SafeCharge, other clients for which he was
providing consultancy services, and his business partners. 19

11 Mr Jackson recommended the first defendant’s services to the plaintiff. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

P’s AEIC at [22]–[23].

After reviewing the first defendant’s CV, the plaintiff proceeded to authorise
and instruct Mr Jackson to negotiate the terms of engagement with the first
defendant as the nominee the plaintiff would appoint. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

P’s AEIC at [24]–[26].

According to the plaintiff’s case, the first defendant agreed to act as a
nominee, although she was not told of the identity of the plaintiff until much
later. That the first defendant agreed to act as a nominee for the plaintiff
is disputed by her, but I will get into the specifics of that area of
contention later in this judgment.

12 Pursuant to instructions conveyed by Mr Jackson, the first defendant
travelled to Hong Kong to set up a company in that territory. The company was
called “EPS Worldwide Limited” (“EPS Hong Kong”), which was incorporated on or
about 18 June 2018. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

P’s AEIC at [37]; TJ’s AEIC at p 116.

“EPS” is an abbreviation for “Eat Pray Shop”. 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

P’s AEIC at [18].

The first defendant was registered as the sole shareholder and director of EPS
Hong Kong. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

P’s AEIC at [37]; TJ’s AEIC at [41].

She also acted on Mr Jackson’s instructions to open a bank account for EPS
Hong Kong with DBS Bank. 25

However, there were issues with opening a bank account with DBS Bank for EPS
Hong Kong, 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

P’s AEIC at [44] and [48(c)]; TJ’s AEIC at [49] and [56(c)].

and it seems that this was the reason why a bank account was opened with
Standard Chartered Bank instead.

13 Subsequently, Mr Jackson instructed the first defendant to travel to
Singapore to set up a company here. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

TJ’s AEIC at [56(e)].

The first defendant did so, and that was how the second defendant came to be
incorporated on 27 July 2018, with her as the sole shareholder and a director.
28

##### Foot Note 28

×

TJ’s AEIC at [61]–[62]; D1’s AEIC at p 20.

As in the case of EPS Hong Kong, the first defendant also opened a bank
account with DBS Bank in Singapore for the second defendant. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

TJ’s AEIC at [71] and p 309.

14 The plaintiff’s case is that, for all matters relating to EPS Hong Kong and
the second defendant, the first defendant had agreed to take his instructions,
which were to be conveyed via Mr Jackson.

15 From 9 to 15 October 2018, there were four transfers of funds to the DBS
Bank account of the second defendant, totalling the amount of approximately
US$1,028,455 (see [20] below). 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

PB 481.

According to the plaintiff, these were payments received as a result of sales
of products to the second defendant’s customers. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

P’s AEIC at [74].

From 25 October 2018 to 1 November 2018, these sums were transferred out of
the second defendant’s DBS Bank account without the approval, knowledge or
instructions of the plaintiff or Mr Jackson (see [21] below). 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

P’s AEIC at [113] and pp 152–154, 158.

On 1 November 2018, the first defendant informed Mr Jackson and his associate,
Ms Sophie Flynn (“Ms Flynn”), that all the moneys in the second defendant’s
bank account were lost because they were fraudulently transferred out of the
account by some unknown person. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

P’s AEIC at [92].

16 The plaintiff contends that the first defendant had taken these funds or
had transferred them out to various recipients. In essence, his claim against
the first defendant is that she has to account for these withdrawn sums and
repay them.

The parties’ cases

The plaintiff’s case

17 The plaintiff’s case is factually straightforward. He argues that he
entered into an agreement, through the agency of Mr Jackson, with the first
defendant in the period from 7 June to 16 July 2018, pursuant to which she
agreed to act as his nominee director and shareholder for EPS Hong Kong and
the second defendant. In consideration for her services as a nominee, the
first defendant would be entitled to the sum of US$30,000. She would also be
reimbursed for any sums she expended for the setting up of the companies and
the bank accounts of these companies. 34

18 As part of her role as a nominee, the first defendant was to comply with
all instructions given by the plaintiff in relation to the companies and their
bank accounts, which may be conveyed through Mr Jackson. 35

##### Foot Note 35

19 In accordance with the agreement, the first defendant duly incorporated EPS
Hong Kong and the second defendant in Hong Kong and Singapore respectively.
Bank accounts for both these companies were also set up. The first defendant
admitted that she was remunerated and reimbursed for her expenses in respect
of the setting up of the companies as follows:

20 Between 9 October 2018 and 15 October 2018, a total sum of US$1,028,455.00
was deposited into the second defendant’s DBS account (the “Funds”). These
monies were received by the second defendant for various orders of beauty
products from its customers, and the customers’ payments were processed

24 I highlight, for completeness, that the plaintiff has mis-stated the inward
transfer on 12 November 2018 in Annex A of his closing submissions as
US$178,601.60 rather than US$139,954.00 (by erroneously treating the
US$139,954.00 as GBP, thereby mistakenly converting “GBP” 139,954.00 into
US$178,601.60). Based on the above estimated converted sums in USD, this means
that the net unauthorised transfers out of the second defendant’s DBS bank
account from 9 November 2018 to 12 November 2018 was US$572,617.65
(US$1,070,950.02 minus US$498,332.37) (“Net Unauthorised Transfers”). 55

##### Foot Note 55

See PCS, Annex A.

25 The plaintiff alleges that the first defendant attempted to conceal her
unauthorised transfers of funds by informing the plaintiff and Mr Jackson that
the DBS Bank account had been frozen by the authorities in Singapore and that
she had lost access to the account. She later claimed that the account had
been “hacked” and that all the moneys were lost. As a result, the plaintiff
only discovered the details of the Unauthorised Transfers out of the second
defendant’s DBS Bank account in May 2019, after the relevant documents were
provided by DBS Bank Ltd to the plaintiff pursuant to the latter’s pre-action
disclosure application in HC/OS 1564/2018. 56

The plaintiff also alleges that the first defendant has wrongfully refused to
acknowledge that he is the beneficial owner of the shares in EPS Hong Kong and
the second defendant, and to hand over the share certificates and other
relevant documents relating to the companies that are in her possession.

26 Further, the plaintiff also discovered that, from 12 November 2018 to 15
April 2019, there were various additional unauthorised transfers, aside from
the Unauthorised Transfers, from the second defendant’s DBS account amounting
to a total of US$877,135.16 (collectively referred to as the “Continuous
Unauthorised Transfers” by the plaintiff in his statement of claim, which I
will adopt in this judgment, even though I think that “Continuing Unauthorised
Transfers” is probably more accurate). 57

27 The plaintiff pleaded that, by virtue of the foregoing, the first defendant
was the agent and trustee of the plaintiff, and the first defendant had acted
in breach of her express and/or implied contractual duties as nominee owed to
the plaintiff. Alternatively, the first defendant had acted in breach of her
fiduciary duties owed as nominee to the plaintiff. Consequently, the plaintiff
has suffered loss of control over the shares of the second defendant; loss in
value of the shares of the second defendant; costs and expenses of
approximately S$30,000.00, £64,585.00, and US$5,325.00 incurred in
investigating and uncovering the misappropriation of the above sum; and the
sum of the Funds amounting to US$1,028,455.00. 58

29 The amount in USD highlighted above was made by applying the conversion
rate of US$1: €0.87962 as at 28 November 2018, which is the rate applied by

Unauthorised Transfers would amount to about US$442,068.88 (US$877,135.16
minus US$435,066.28) (“Net Continuous Unauthorised Transfers”). I should add
that the plaintiff has also raised (a) a claim in conspiracy against the first
and second defendants for having conspired wrongfully with intent to injure
him by unlawfully misappropriating funds from the second defendant’s DBS Bank
account, 60

The defendants’ case

shareholder or director in relation to EPS Hong Kong or the second defendant.
Instead, she claims that, in or around September 2017, she entered into an
agreement with Mr Jackson, which she described as an “online outsourcing
agreement”. Under this agreement, Mr Jackson would set up an online “health,
wellness and fashion” business for the first defendant at his own expense, and
also assist her in growing and operating this business. In exchange for his
help in setting up and developing the first defendant’s online business, Mr
Jackson would be entitled to 50% of the profits from the business. 62

[5]–[6].

31 The first defendant’s online business was operated through entities like
EPS Hong Kong and the second defendant, which she claims were owned entirely
by her. As such, she claims that she set up these companies for her own
purposes, and not for the plaintiff.

32 The first defendant’s case is that, after she set up the DBS Bank account
of the second defendant, she handed control of the account over to Mr Jackson
and Ms Flynn, who is an accountant. Because she claimed not to have any
control over the DBS Bank account, the first defendant denied that she was in
any way responsible for the Unauthorised Transfers of funds from the DBS Bank
account. 63

33 Further, the first defendant also raises an alternative defence that the
plaintiff’s claims should not be allowed as a matter of public policy. This is
because it is alleged that the plaintiff, Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn had
incorporated EPS Hong Kong and the second defendant to facilitate money
laundering and the Eat Pray Shop online platform did not carry out any bona
fide business. As such, the first defendant alleges that the funds received
into the DBS Bank account of the second defendant were “suspicious” in nature.

The trial and closing submissions

34 The trial of this matter was heard remotely over the online platform “Zoom”
from 17 to 26 November 2020. This was because the plaintiff, his two factual
witnesses (Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn) and the first defendant were all based
overseas, and would have found difficulty travelling to Singapore because of
the Covid-19 restrictions.

35 At the end of the trial, I gave directions for the parties to file and
exchange their written closing submissions and reply submissions. Just two
days before the closing submissions were due, the defendants’ solicitors and
counsel, Mr Keith Hsu and Mr Edison Tam from Emerald Law, applied to discharge
themselves. An Assistant Registrar made an order granting that application on
the next day. The plaintiff duly filed his closing submissions on time, but
the defendants did not. When contacted by the Registry, the first defendant
then replied by email to state that she did not “wish to hold up the courts
any further and so will not file the written submissions”. As such, I was left
unassisted by the defendants in terms of submissions on the issues that I had
to decide in this matter.

The issues

36 From my review of the parties’ cases, the central issues that I have to
decide in order to resolve the dispute between the parties are as follows.

(a) Had the first defendant agreed to act as the nominee of the plaintiff in
relation to the setting up of the second defendant?

(b) If so, had the first defendant breached her obligations by causing the
Unauthorised Transfers and Continuous Unauthorised Transfers to be transferred
out of the DBS Bank account of the second defendant and refusing to relinquish
control of the second defendant to the plaintiff?

(c) Does the doctrine of illegality bar the plaintiff’s claims against the
defendants?

37 There are also other issues which arise from the alternative claims made by
the plaintiff, namely whether the first defendant has been unjustly enriched
and whether the defendants are liable for unlawful means conspiracy. I will
proceed to determine those issues only if it becomes necessary to do so.

The applicable law

38 The plaintiff pleaded that the first defendant acted as agent and trustee
of the plaintiff and that she breached both her contractual and fiduciary
duties as nominee. It is trite that an agency refers to a relationship, often
undergirded by a contractual agreement, where one party is able to act for
another party: see Tonny Permana v One Tree Capital Management Pte Ltd and
another [2021] SGHC 37 (“Tonny Permana”) at [91], citing Tan Cheng Han SC, The
Law of Agency (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“Tan Cheng Han”) at para
01.008. The issue of whether an agency relationship exists is a matter to be
determined objectively as a matter of law from what the parties said and did.
Thus, the parties will be deemed to have consented to such a relationship even
if they were ignorant of or did not intend the consequences of their action:
Ding Auto Pte Ltd v Yip Kin Lung and others [2019] SGHC 243 (“Ding Auto”) at
[131], citing Tan Cheng Han at para 01.011. Whilst a defining characteristic
of agency is the control exerted by the principal over the scope of the
agent’s authority, an agency relationship can arise even if the agreement
between the parties gives full discretion to the agent in the exercise of the
agent’s authority: Ding Auto at [132], citing Tan Cheng Han at para 01.020.

39 As a result of being able to act for the principal, and thereby affect the
principal’s position and interests, the law imposes various duties on agents
for the protection of the principal, such as fiduciary duties, duties of skill
and care, and any contractual duties stipulated in the agreement between the
agent and principal. Each unique agency relationship will be accompanied by
distinct sets of rights and obligations. For instance, while the relationship
of agent and principal is one of the established categories of fiduciary
relationships, not every agent will owe fiduciary duties, and the presumption
that a fiduciary relationship exists in an agency relationship can be rebutted
by the particular facts of the case: Susilawati v American Express Bank Ltd
[2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 (“Susilawati”) at [40]. The three common features of a
fiduciary relationship are that (Susilawati at [41]):

(a) the fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power;

(b) the fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to
affect the beneficiary’s legal or practical interests; and

(c) the beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the
fiduciary holding the discretion or power.

40 Therefore, the “critical feature” of a fiduciary relationship is that
(Susilawati at [41], quoting Mason J in Hospital Products Ltd v United States
Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 96-97):

… the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the
interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which
will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense.
The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the
fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the
detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the
fiduciary of his position. [emphasis in original omitted]

41 Therefore, in general, the more extensive the agency relationship, ie, the
greater an agent’s authority or ability to affect the principal’s interests,
the more onerous the duties imposed upon the agent will be: Tonny Permana at
[94]. Where an agent is able to unilaterally and significantly affect his
principal’s position or interests and has been conferred such powers in trust
and confidence, extensive fiduciary duties may arise. On the other hand, where
the agent has limited authority and discretion, the agent will owe few, if
any, fiduciary duties: Tonny Permana at [99].

42 An agent may have “actual authority”, either express or implied, or
“apparent authority” (also known as “ostensible authority”) to bind his
principal. The plaintiff has relied on actual authority in this case (see [27]
above). Express actual authority flows from the parties’ explicit agreement on
what the agent is authorised to do on behalf of the principal. The scope of an
agent’s implied authority depends on the circumstances of each case, including
the parties’ words and conduct towards each other. Where authority is implied,
it is usually because it is “necessary to enable the agent to effectively
perform the task for which the agent had been appointed”: Lew, Solomon v
Kaikhushru Shiavax Nargolwala and others and another appeal [2021] SGCA(I) 1
at [47], affirming Alphire Group Pte Ltd v Law Chau Loon and another matter
[2020] SGCA 50 at [7] and Singapore Salvage Engineers Pte Ltd v North Sea
Drilling Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGHC 5 at [14].

43 With these applicable legal principles outlined, I now turn to examine (a)
whether an agency agreement existed between the plaintiff and the first
defendant because the first defendant agreed, whether explicitly or impliedly,
to be a nominee for the plaintiff; and, if so, (b) whether the first defendant
breached any of her duties as agent (contractual or fiduciary) owed to the
plaintiff by making the Unauthorised Transfers and the Continuous Unauthorised
Transfers. The determination of the second question necessarily involves an
examination of what the first defendant, as agent for the plaintiff, was
authorised – expressly or impliedly – to do on behalf of the plaintiff.

Did the first defendant agree to be a nominee for the plaintiff?

44 The plaintiff pleaded and attested that the terms of the plaintiff’s
engagement of the first defendant were set out in WhatsApp messages exchanged
between Mr Jackson, on behalf of the plaintiff, and the first defendant from 7
June 2018 to 16 July 2018 (the “Agency Agreement”), and included but were not
limited to the following. 65

(a) Mr Jackson and the first defendant would share equally the sum of
US$50,000.00, excluding disbursements, payable by the plaintiff.

(b) The first defendant’s share of US$50,000 would be in consideration for the
first defendant’s services as a nominee director and shareholder of a Hong
Kong company; she was to take instructions from the plaintiff on matters
relating to the said company and its bank accounts.

(c) The first defendant would assist, including by travelling to Hong Kong, to
set up a Hong Kong company and open bank account(s) on its behalf.

(d) Mr Jackson and the first defendant would share equally an additional sum
of US$10,000.00 excluding disbursements, payable by the plaintiff.

(e) The first defendant’s share of US$10,000 would be in consideration for the
first defendant’s services as a nominee director and shareholder of a
Singapore company; she was to take instructions from the plaintiff on matters
relating to the said company and its bank accounts.

(f) The first defendant would assist, including by travelling to Singapore, to
set up a Singapore company and open bank account(s) on its behalf.

(g) The first defendant would be the nominee director and shareholder of the
companies incorporated in Hong Kong and Singapore. The share(s) of the
companies were to be held for the absolute benefit of the plaintiff.

45 I find that the plaintiff’s case in relation to the arrangements which Mr
Jackson made with the first defendant concerning the setting up of EPS Hong
Kong and the second defendant is overwhelmingly made out on the evidence
before me. In particular, I find the following pieces of evidence to be the
most illuminating.

The WhatsApp exchanges

46 Mr Jackson, who is based in the United Kingdom, and the first defendant,
who resided in Austria at the material time, communicated mainly through
WhatsApp messages. These electronic messages between Mr Jackson and the first
defendant were adduced in evidence and provided an unambiguous picture of what
transpired. They were entirely consistent with Mr Jackson’s evidence that the
first defendant had agreed to be a nominee for one of his clients on or around
7 June 2018 by setting up EPS Hong Kong. 66

##### Foot Note 66

×

TJ’s AEIC at [30].

47 The WhatsApp messages also set out the terms of the nominee arrangement to
which the parties had agreed. The first defendant would share equally in the
sum of US$50,000 with Mr Jackson that would be paid by the client. She would
also be reimbursed for all her expenses for travelling to Hong Kong to set up
a company and its bank account. The first defendant agreed to serve as a
shareholder and director of the company, as a nominee of Mr Jackson’s
“client”, whose identity was not revealed to her. 67

##### Foot Note 67

×

See TJ’s AEIC at pp 94–97.

Following from this, the messages show that the first defendant then travelled
to Hong Kong to incorporate EPS Hong Kong and open a banking account, and she
kept Mr Jackson updated throughout the process. 68

##### Foot Note 68

×

See TJ’s AEIC at pp 98–116.

48 In her oral evidence, the first defendant appeared to be taking the
position that, since the identity of the plaintiff was not revealed to her,
she could not have agreed to act as his nominee. 69

In my judgment, this was an untenable position to take. It is quite clear from
the WhatsApp messages that the first defendant knew and agreed to be a nominee
for one of Mr Jackson’s “clients”. Critically, she did not ask whom the client
was, nor did she appear to care. That being the case, it does not lie in her
mouth now to rely on her own nonchalance and disinterest in ascertaining the
identity of this client to assert that she did not agree to act as his
nominee. As for the authority of Mr Jackson to agree on terms with the first
defendant on behalf of the plaintiff, that is established by the evidence of
both Mr Jackson and the plaintiff. 70

Transcript, 18 November 2020, p 107 lines 3–12; TJ’s AEIC at [27]–[31].

As such, I find that the first defendant had agreed to act on behalf of the
plaintiff as a nominee in respect of EPS Hong Kong.

49 Then, the WhatsApp messages go on to show that, on or around 16 July 2018,
the first defendant agreed with Mr Jackson to be a nominee for his “client” in
the setting up of the second defendant. She and Mr Jackson agreed to share an
additional sum of US$10,000 to be paid by his “client”. She would have to
travel to Singapore to set up the second defendant and to open a bank account,
and would also serve as a shareholder and director of the second defendant as
a nominee of the “client”. She would be reimbursed for all her expenses. 71

##### Foot Note 71

TJ’s AEIC at pp 137–142.

As in the case for EPS Hong Kong, the WhatsApp exchanges show that the first
defendant travelled to Singapore, and she carried out the instructions to set
up the second defendant and to open a bank account in its name. She was in
constant communication with Mr Jackson. She would seek his instructions when
problems arose and updated him regularly of what she did. 72

50 The first defendant admitted that she was reimbursed for all her expenses

Hong Kong and the second defendant respectively (see [19] above). 73

She also admitted that she received payments of the agreed amounts due to her
for her services. In fact, many of these payments to the first defendant were
referred to in the WhatsApp exchanges.

51 I should point out that, while the defendants disputed the authenticity of
all the WhatsApp messages between her, Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn through a
notice of non-admission of documents dated 18 November 2019, it appeared to me
that she eventually accepted that these messages were authentic. This is
because, first, the defendants’ counsel did not put to Mr Jackson or Ms Flynn
during cross-examination that their WhatsApp exchanges with the first
defendant were fabricated or had been tampered with, despite Mr Jackson and Ms
Flynn giving evidence as to such WhatsApp messages. 74

See Transcript, 20 November 2020, p 173 lines 2–14.

Second, and more significantly, when the first defendant was cross-examined on
her WhatsApp exchanges with Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn, she never once claimed
that the messages that she had sent them, or had received from them, were not
authentic. Instead, the first defendant spent most of her oral evidence
attempting to explain away what she had said in her WhatsApp exchanges and to
give a different “spin” on them, as I will explain below.

52 When referred to her WhatsApp exchange with Mr Jackson, the first defendant
tried to claim initially that she did not know that she was being asked to be
a nominee for a client of Mr Jackson’s. But, when she was pressed further, she
admitted that Mr Jackson was indeed asking her to be a nominee on behalf of
one of his clients. 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

Transcript, 25 November 2020, p 73 line 14–p 76 line 7.

When referred by counsel to particular statements in those exchanges, the
first defendant often asserted that they were discussions about other nominee
arrangements with other potential clients, and not the plaintiff. 76

##### Foot Note 76

Transcript, 25 November 2020, p 74 lines 9–22.

But, simply reading those messages would show that the first defendant could
not have been talking about anything else. It was patently obvious to me that
the first defendant was just trying to obfuscate and confuse matters.

The Mandatory Declaration

53 The plaintiff adduced in evidence a one-page document titled “MANDATORY
DECLARATION” dated 27 July 2018 which was executed by the first defendant, and
where she declares that the sole share that she held in the second defendant
was held as a nominee for “absolute benefit of the Beneficial Owner”. 77

Mr Jackson gave evidence that he had requested this form from the first
defendant by email. 78

##### Foot Note 78

×

TJ’s AEIC at [70] and pp 296–304.

When the form was executed by the first defendant, the name and details of the
“Beneficial Owner”, ie the plaintiff, was not set out in the form. That
portion of the form where the name of the “Beneficial Owner” should appear was
left blank. The first defendant replied by email on 29 August 2018 to ask,
amongst other things: “Who shall I put as BO?”, and the email reply from Mr
Jackson on the same date was that: “you [can] leave BO blank but fill up the
rest – backdate to formation please”. 79

##### Foot Note 79

×

PB 218; TJ’s AEIC at p 296.

This was consistent with the fact that the first defendant was only told that
she would be a nominee for one of Mr Jackson’s clients and she was not told of
the plaintiff’s identity. As already mentioned, the first defendant expressed
no interest in the identity of this client.

54 There was then an email from the first defendant to Mr Jackson dated 29
August 2018 where she attached a scanned copy of the signed Mandatory
Declaration. In that email, she stated: “Here you go! I will fedex the
original.” 80

##### Foot Note 80

Subsequently, Mr Jackson received by courier a set of documents from the first
defendant, which included the signed original copy of the Mandatory
Declaration. However, the signed original copy was not produced by the
plaintiff or Mr Jackson in evidence because it had been misplaced. 81

55 The first defendant’s position is that she never signed the Mandatory

At trial, counsel for the defendants drew my attention to the fact that they
served a notice of non-admission dated 18 November 2019 in relation to the
Mandatory Declaration. The first defendant also claims that the email
exchanges with Mr Jackson about the Mandatory Declaration, and the email
attaching the scanned signed copy of that document, were doctored. 83

##### Foot Note 83

Transcript, 26 November 2020, p 99 line 14–p 101 line 21.

56 I was not able to accept the first defendant’s objections about the
authenticity of the signed Mandatory Declaration or the email exchanges with
Mr Jackson about this document. The plaintiff has produced a copy of the
signed Mandatory Declaration. There has been a reasonable explanation by the
plaintiff and Mr Jackson as to why the original signed version could not be
produced. From a visual comparison of the signature on the copy of the
Mandatory Declaration adduced in evidence with the first defendant’s signature
in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, it would appear that the first
defendant’s signature closely resembles the signature that is on the signed
Mandatory Declaration. In such circumstances, I find that the evidential
burden had shifted to the defendants to adduce evidence to show that the
signature in the disputed document is a forgery. Indeed, this is also
consistent with Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another
appeal [2013] 4 SLR 308 at [157], where the Court of Appeal held that the
burden of proof is on the party alleging forgery to prove the forgery. This
could have been done, for instance, with expert handwriting evidence. For
reasons best known to the defendants, this was not done.

57 In fact, despite such a serious allegation that there has been forgery of
her signature, I find it puzzling that the first defendant did not make a
police report in Singapore. When asked by the plaintiff’s counsel why she did
not do so, I find that the first defendant could not come up with any credible
explanation – the only excuse she could muster was that she “spen[t] all [her]
money and [her] efforts to clear [her] name”. 84

##### Foot Note 84

×

Transcript, 26 November 2020, p 102 line 25–p 103 line 2.

This is not only a convenient excuse but also, more importantly, illogical and
incredible, since filing a police report would not incur much, if any, extra
cost for the first defendant. As such, I was not inclined to believe her
allegation that her signature had been forged on the Mandatory Declaration.

58 Significantly, the defendants’ treatment of the email evidence is more
damaging to their case. The plaintiff gave discovery of the email exchanges of
29 August 2018 between the first defendant and Mr Jackson. The native copies
of the emails have been with Mr Jackson all this while. However, the
defendants did not even bother to inspect the native copies of the emails.
Neither did they call any forensic expert to prove their rather serious
allegations that the emails were doctored. That being the case, it is quite
clear to me that the defendants have utterly failed to prove that the first
defendant did not sign the Mandatory Declaration and email a scanned copy of
the document over to Mr Jackson, as the emails show quite starkly.

59 The terms of the Mandatory Declaration spell out the first defendant’s
acknowledgment that she is a nominee in respect of her shareholding in the
second defendant. It also sets out the obligations she had undertaken as a
nominee, including to comply with all the instructions of the “Beneficial
Owner”, ie the plaintiff. That being so, there can be little doubt that there
is absolutely no merit to the first defendant’s denial that she was not a
nominee. There was similarly no merit to the first defendant’s claim that she
owned the second defendant absolutely.

Communications from Dr Otto C Meier-Boeschenstein

60 By early November 2018, after the loss of the funds from the second
defendant’s DBS Bank account, the first defendant was facing demands from Mr
Jackson to hand over control of the second defendant to the plaintiff by
executing the necessary board resolutions and share transfer forms. 85

##### Foot Note 85

P’s AEIC at [98]–[103]; TJ’s AEIC at [106]–[110] and pp 410–412.

On 9 November 2018, Mr Jackson received an email from one Dr Otto C Meier-
Boeschenstein (“Dr Meier”), an attorney based in Zurich, Switzerland, who
stated that he had been entrusted by the first defendant to represent her in
all matters relating to the second defendant. 86

##### Foot Note 86

×

PB 242–243.

61 Dr Meier then wrote a detailed email on 14 November 2018 to Mr Jackson
setting out the first defendant’s position. 87

##### Foot Note 87

×

PB 245–247.

In essence, Dr Meier stated that the first defendant had agreed to Mr
Jackson’s request to be a nominee shareholder and director in relation to the
second defendant for one of his clients. In exchange, 20% of the sales revenue
of the second defendant would remain in the second defendant and be shared
equally between herself and Mr Jackson. The first defendant was purportedly
unaware of the substantial banking transactions that had taken place in the
DBS Bank account of the second defendant in October 2018 because these were
all effected by Mr Jackson or Ms Flynn. Amongst other things, Dr Meier
demanded, on behalf of the first defendant, proof of the identity of the
“ultimate beneficial owner” and also for her “part of the margin of the
transactions”.

62 In my view, the email of 14 November 2018 from Dr Meier contained clear
admissions on the part of the first defendant that she was merely a nominee in
respect of her shareholding and directorship in the second defendant. When
cross-examined on this email, the first defendant made what can only be
described as an outrageous attempt to explain away its contents. She claimed
that it was not Dr Meier who wrote and sent the email in question. Instead,
she had asked someone to impersonate Dr Meier and to compose and send the
email. When pressed, she could not even name the person she had purportedly
asked to impersonate Dr Meier. She claimed that she did not even know the
imposter’s last name. She claimed that she did not give the imposter
instructions about what exactly to state in the email. She tried to
disassociate herself from the email’s contents by claiming that it was all
thought up by the imposter, and that she did not even read a draft of the
email before he sent it out. 88

that he had with Mr Jackson on 12 November 2018. 89

In my judgment, the first defendant’s evidence in this regard borders on
absurdity.

64 Therefore, needless to say, I have little hesitation in rejecting the first
defendant’s incredible explanations about Dr Meier. As the counsel for the
plaintiff pointed out, it is undisputed that there was a transfer of CHF
10,000 (or £7,882.51) from the second defendant’s DBS Bank account to Dr Meier
on 12 November 2018. 91

##### Foot Note 91

Transcript, 26 November 2020, p 50 line 5–p 51 line 6.

This is clear evidence that the first defendant had instructed Dr Meier around
this period of time to represent her in dealing with the demand made by the
plaintiff and Mr Jackson. That the transfer of funds to Dr Meier was on 12
November 2018, and the dates of Dr Meier’s abovementioned emails to the
plaintiff were on 9 and 14 November 2018, is too much of a coincidence. I thus
reject the first defendant’s claims regarding Dr Meier.

The alleged online outsourcing agreement with Mr Jackson

65 A significant part of the first defendant’s case was that Mr Jackson had
agreed to set up an online business for her, and this was done using, amongst
other companies, EPS Hong Kong and the second defendant. Hence, the first
defendant claimed that the second defendant (and EPS Hong Kong) belonged
entirely to her. In return, the first defendant and Mr Jackson would allegedly
share in the profits generated by the online business. 92

##### Foot Note 92

×

D1’s AEIC at [8]–[12].

66 The difficulty with the first defendant’s evidence about the online
outsourcing agreement with Mr Jackson is that it is completely unsupported by
any written evidence. As already mentioned, the first defendant’s
communications with Mr Jackson were mostly in the form of WhatsApp messages
and emails. But there is nothing in those written communications that even
hinted at the existence of such an agreement between Mr Jackson and the first
defendant that he would set up these companies for her benefit. In fact, quite
the contrary, as I have already found, the written communications are entirely
consistent with Mr Jackson’s evidence that the first defendant was acting as a
nominee for one of his clients. Further, despite the first defendant’s claims
that she was actively running an online business involving the sale of health
and beauty products, she was not able to show any documents at all to
substantiate her claims. In fact, she could not even name any of her suppliers
or service providers that she used, let alone produce any documents from any
of these entities.

67 Not only that, the first defendant’s evidence as to the terms of the
alleged agreement with Mr Jackson fluctuated over time. Dr Meier’s email of 14
November 2018, which I have already referred to above, stated that 20% of the
sales generated by the second defendant’s business would be shared equally
with Mr Jackson. In her email of 5 April 2019 sent to the plaintiff’s
solicitors in response to their letter before action, the first defendant
claimed that Mr Jackson and her had agreed that she would get “10% of GROSS
revenues from the online business”. 93

##### Foot Note 93

read 50%. 95

I reject this explanation as being all too convenient. Further, that might
explain the figure of 10% but it did not explain why there was a reference to
gross revenues instead of profits.

68 Critically, and worst of all, the first defendant’s allegation that she had
an agreement with Mr Jackson for him to set up an online business with her was
not even put to Mr Jackson when he was cross-examined, even though this is an
important part of the first defendant’s case. As such, it ought to have been
put to Mr Jackson for him to be given the opportunity to respond. It is trite
that the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 requires parties to put to a
witness important points of contention about the witness or the evidence given
by the witness in order to give the witness a fair opportunity to meet that
contention. Failure to do this may preclude the party concerned from making
that submission: Michael Vaz Lorrain v Singapore Rifle Association [2021] 1
SLR 513 at [26], citing Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd [2017] 1
SLR 141 at [48]; see also Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East,
Ltd [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [17]. Consequently, I find that it is not open to
the defendants to claim that the first defendant had an agreement with Mr
Jackson for him to set up an online business with her.

69 In summary, for all the above reasons, I find the evidence of the first
defendant to be highly unsatisfactory. On the other hand, the plaintiff’s case
is corroborated by the WhatsApp exchanges, emails and other communications
that emanated from the first defendant or her lawyers. As such, I am left to
conclude that the plaintiff has established his case that the first defendant
was a nominee in relation to her position as a shareholder and director of the
second defendant. This means that, pursuant to the Agency Agreement between
the plaintiff (through Mr Jackson) and the first defendant, the first
defendant acted as agent for the plaintiff on the terms outlined at [44]
above. I now turn to the question of the specific duties owed by the first
defendant to the plaintiff pursuant to the Agency Agreement.

Duties owed by the first defendant as agent of the plaintiff

70 The plaintiff pleaded that the first defendant owed contractual and
fiduciary duties to the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not specify the fiduciary
duties owed by the first defendant. 96

See SOC Amd 2 at [14].

As for the contractual duties, the plaintiff pleaded that, on a “true
construction” of the Agency Agreement, the first defendant owed the following
duties to the plaintiff. 97

##### Foot Note 97

×

SOC Amd 2 at [13].

(a) Notwithstanding that the first defendant would be a nominee director and
the sole shareholder of the second defendant, the first defendant held the
shares of the second defendant on trust for the plaintiff. At all material
times, the plaintiff was and is the beneficial owner of the shares of the
second defendant.

(b) The first defendant was to take instructions from the plaintiff or his
agent on matters relating to the second defendant and its DBS Bank account.
Therefore, whilst the first defendant had exclusive access to the second
defendant’s DBS Bank account, the first defendant was only to use the DBS Bank
account on express instructions from the plaintiff, and to transfer such funds
to the plaintiff or third parties upon its instructions.

(c) The plaintiff would provide outgoing remittance instructions to the first
defendant. The first defendant would remit outgoing remittance(s) upon the
plaintiff’s express instructions. The first defendant would notify the
plaintiff or his agent of any incoming fund remittance as and when received.

(d) Upon the plaintiff’s request, the first defendant was to render a true and
complete account of all funds deposited in the second defendant’s DBS Bank
account, including by providing to the plaintiff true and accurate statements
of outstanding balances in the DBS Bank account as well as the DBS Bank
account’s transaction history.

(e) The first defendant owed a duty to act bona fide in the interest of the
plaintiff.

(f) The first defendant owed a duty to act for the proper purposes of the
plaintiff in relation to its affairs and/or the affairs of the second
defendant.

71 I find the plaintiff’s foregoing list to be a bit unclear. First, while the
foregoing points were framed as “duties” owed by the first defendant to the
plaintiff pursuant to the Agency Agreement, it is evident that not all of them
are “duties” per se. For instance, the proposition in [70(a)] above that the
first defendant held the shares of the second defendant on trust for the
plaintiff is not a “duty”. Instead, it concerns the state of the beneficial
ownership of the shares of the second defendant, and the relationship between
the first defendant (as trustee) and the plaintiff (as beneficiary). If this
relationship exists, then the question arises as to what duties the first
defendant, as trustee, owes to the plaintiff, as beneficiary. Similarly, the
propositions at [70(b)] and [70(c)] are also not duties. Rather, they pertain
to the scope of the first defendant’s authority to act for the plaintiff.

72 Second, while the plaintiff’s pleading gives the impression that these
“duties” are contractual duties arising from the Agency Agreement, it is
apparent that the duties listed at [70(e)] and [70(f)] above are actually
fiduciary duties: see Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and
other matters [2018] 2 SLR 333 (“Ho Yew Kong”) at [134]–[135]; and Ho Kang
Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) [2014] 3 SLR
329 at [40]. The core character of a fiduciary duty is that it is imposed to
exact loyalty from the agent: see Ho Yew Kong at [135]. On the other hand, as
aforementioned, the plaintiff omitted to specify the particular fiduciary
duties owed by the first defendant to the plaintiff; the plaintiff only
pleaded broadly that, “alternatively, the [first defendant] owed fiduciary
duties as an agent and trustee to the [p]laintiff in relation to the shares of
[the second defendant] held by the [first defendant] on trust for the
[p]laintiff”. 98

##### Foot Note 98

×

See SOC Amd 2 at [14].

This is apt to confuse.

73 Third, the duty to account listed at [70(d)] above is not, strictly
speaking, a “duty”. Rather, the taking of an account is merely the first step
of a process that enables the beneficiary to identify and quantify any deficit
in the trust fund and seek the appropriate remedy by which it may be made
good: see UVH and another v UVJ and others [2020] 3 SLR 1329 at [22], citing
Libertarian Investments Ltd v Thomas Alexej Hall [2013] HKCFA 93 (“Libertarian
Investments”) at [167]–[168] (per Lord Millett NPJ).

74 Nevertheless, the plaintiff did at a minimum plead that:

(a) the first defendant held the second defendant’s shares on trust for the
plaintiff;

(b) the scope of the first defendant’s authority to act on behalf of the
plaintiff in relation to the second defendant is limited only to what the
plaintiff expressly authorises the first defendant to do; and

(c) the first defendant owed fiduciary duties to act bona fide in the interest
of the plaintiff and to act for proper purposes.

75 The purpose of pleadings is to ensure that each party is aware of the case
against it, and that the key consideration in this context is the need to
prevent surprises arising at the trial: see Tuitiongenius Pte Ltd v Toh Yew
Keat and another [2021] 1 SLR 231 at [65]. While the plaintiff’s pleadings
were not drafted with precision, it is clear that the defendants were not at
all taken by surprise by the plaintiff’s claims at [74] above because these
were pleaded, attested, and run at trial. The next question is whether these
claims are made out on the evidence.

76 I find that these three propositions at [74] above flow from the terms of
the Agency Agreement, as outlined at [44] above. It also bears clarifying
that, in my view, the first defendant’s fiduciary duties to act bona fide in
the interest of the plaintiff and to act for proper purposes arise not only
from the first defendant’s position as trustee of the second defendant’s
shares vis-à-vis the plaintiff (per [74(a)] above) but also from the Agency
Agreement. I note that it is the plaintiff’s case that the first defendant was
not given any discretion to affect the plaintiff’s position, but instead had
to act according to the strict instructions of the plaintiff. Applying the
considerations at [39] to [41] here, this means that the first defendant had
not been conferred broad powers and discretion in trust and confidence. Thus,
I accept that the first defendant does not owe the plaintiff “extensive”
fiduciary duties.

77 However, this does not mean that the first defendant owes the plaintiff no
fiduciary duties at all; even if granted limited discretion, an agent can owe
a “few” fiduciary duties (see [41] above). In this case, the first defendant
had exclusive access to the second defendant’s bank account. The first
defendant was also travelling to a foreign country to act for the plaintiff as
nominee director and shareholder of the second defendant. Critically, the
first defendant was entrusted with funds in her position as agent. In these
circumstances, the relationship between the plaintiff and the first defendant
is therefore one which gives the first defendant a special opportunity to act
to the detriment of the plaintiff, who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by
the first defendant’s position as the plaintiff’s agent. This is squarely
within the consideration listed at [39(c)] and [40], and, for this reason, I
find that, as the plaintiff’s agent, the first defendant owes, minimally, the
fiduciary duties to act bona fide in the plaintiff’s interest and to act for
proper purposes.

78 I also note, for completeness, that I do not find that the first defendant
was a trustee of the second defendant’s funds in the DBS Bank account. This
will be explained further at [112] below.

79 It is undisputed that the plaintiff did not authorise the first defendant
to effect the Unauthorised Transfers from the second defendant’s bank account.
Therefore, the Unauthorised Transfers would be a breach of the Agency
Agreement (per [74(b)] above) and also the first defendant’s fiduciary duty to
act bona fide in the interest of the plaintiff and to act for proper purposes
of the plaintiff’s (per [74(c)] above), if the Unauthorised Transfers were
indeed effected by the first defendant. This leads me to the next question.

Did the first defendant effect the transfer of funds from the second
defendant’s bank account?

80 The next issue that I have to decide is whether the first defendant was the
person who effected the transfer of the funds from the second defendant’s DBS
Bank account in the period from October 2018 to April 2019. If so, the first
defendant would be liable to the plaintiff for breach of her obligations as a
nominee, since it is undisputed that she did not act on any instructions of
the plaintiff or his agents in effecting such transfers.

81 There can be no dispute between the parties as to the precise inflows and
outflows of moneys to and from the second defendant’s DBS Bank account. This
is because a full set of the bank statements and documents showing the bank
transfers have been obtained by the plaintiff from DBS Bank through the
process of pre-action discovery. As these documents show, from 9 to 15 October
2018, there were four transfers of moneys to the DBS Bank account – viz, the
Funds – totalling the amount of approximately US$1,028,455 (see [20] above).

82 From 25 October to 1 November 2018, there were outflows of funds – viz, the
Unauthorised Transfers – from the second defendant’s DBS Bank account to
various recipients (see [21] above). Some of the transfers were converted into
GBP, EUR and HKD. 101

83 From 31 October 2018 to 12 November 2018, a portion of these funds were
returned by the recipients to the second defendant (see [23] above). During
this period, there were five transfers of funds to the second defendant’s DBS
Bank account totalling the amount of US$498,332.37. 103

84 Then, from 12 November 2018 to 15 April 2019, the funds in the second

above). 104

Continuous Unauthorised Transfers from 12 November 2018 to 15 April 2019

85 At trial, the first defendant broadly admitted that she was the one who

Her evidence as to the reasons for these transfers ranged from the incredible
to the incoherent. She said that she caused moneys to be transferred to EPS
Hong Kong’s Standard Chartered Bank account in Hong Kong because she knew that
she needed to build up a legal fund to defend the case that would be brought
by the plaintiff against her. She claimed that she already knew then that she
was being “set up” by the plaintiff and Mr Jackson. 107

Not long later, the first defendant changed her evidence and claimed that she
transferred the moneys to EPS Hong Kong to secure them, so that she could use
the moneys to pay for the expenses of her online business conducted through
the second defendant. 108

Yet, at the same time, she claimed that the bank account of EPS Hong Kong was
now closed and the moneys are all gone, but she refused to explain how all the
moneys had been expended and, if not fully used, where the balance of the
moneys are now. 109

86 The first defendant did deny though that she was responsible for effecting
the Unauthorised Transfers in the earlier period from 25 October to 1 November
2018 referred to at [82] above. Under cross-examination, the first defendant’s
evidence was that someone had “hacked” the bank account and transferred the
sums out in the period from 25 October to 1 November 2018. 110

However, she claimed that she got the moneys back and “secure[d] those funds”.
By that, she explained that she had transferred out from the bank account the
moneys that had been returned, as I have recounted above. She estimated that
she had transferred out around US$800,000, although the figure was closer to
US$500,000 as is clear from the bank statements. 111

##### Foot Note 111

×

Transcript, 25 November 2020, p 11 lines 3–24.

I should add that the first defendant also claimed that she is entitled to the
amounts that she had transferred out. This is because of the purported
agreement with Mr Jackson concerning the profits of her online business of the
second defendant, which was in operation and doing well. 112

D1’s AEIC at [43]; Transcript, 25 November 2020, p 8 line 21–p 9 line 25.

87 Given my findings above that there was in fact no such agreement with Mr
Jackson, I find that the first defendant was not entitled to effect the
Continuous Unauthorised Transfers out of the DBS Bank account of the second
defendant, which she has admitted to carrying out, in the period from 12
November 2018 to 15 April 2019. Her excuses about needing to set up a fund for
her legal expenses do not provide any legal justification for the withdrawals.

88 The only remaining factual dispute before me concerning these transfers out
of the second defendant’s DBS Bank account is whether the first defendant was
the person who had effected the Unauthorised Transfers out of the account from
25 October to 1 November 2018. It is to this issue that I now turn.

Unauthorised Transfers from 25 October to 1 November 2018

The online operation of the second defendant’s DBS Bank account

89 When the second defendant’s DBS Bank account was set up, the instructions
given by Mr Jackson to the first defendant was that she was to obtain a
separate SIM card and to register that new mobile phone number with DBS Bank.
This is because, when banking transactions are effected online, apart from
requiring the customer to key in the necessary login information on the DBS
Bank online banking platform, the bank would also send a one-time password
(“OTP”) to the mobile phone number that is registered with the bank. This OTP
must then be entered into the online banking platform in order for the banking
transaction to be effected. Also, once the banking transaction is effected, an
SMS notification of that transaction will be sent to the mobile phone number
registered with the bank. 113

##### Foot Note 113

Transcript, 20 November 2020, p 92 lines 3–20.

90 The plan was that the SIM card would be couriered to Mr Jackson in the
United Kingdom, in addition to providing him with the login details for online
banking with DBS Bank. By doing so, Mr Jackson and/or Ms Flynn, who was
assisting him, would be able to carry out banking transactions on DBS Bank’s
online platform without the first defendant’s involvement. The OTP that would
be sent by DBS Bank to the mobile phone number would be accessible by Mr
Jackson and/or Ms Flynn since they would be in possession of the SIM card. 114

Instead, it is undisputed that she registered her personal mobile phone number

details, including her email address. 116

92 On the instructions of Mr Jackson, the first defendant applied for access
to online banking and was provided with the login details, which were an
organisation ID, a user ID and a confidential PIN (collectively referred to as
the “online banking login details”). It is not disputed that the first
defendant passed on the online banking login details to Mr Jackson and Ms
Flynn. With that information, Ms Flynn was able to access the online banking
platform and she then changed the confidential PIN to one that was not known
to the first defendant. Through this online access, Ms Flynn could view the
balances and transactions in relation to the second defendant’s DBS Bank
account on the online banking platform.

93 The WhatsApp group chat among the first defendant, Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn
called “EPS” was then set up. It was to enable Ms Flynn to effect transactions
on the second defendant’s account on the online banking platform with the
assistance of the first defendant, who was supposed to quickly pass on any
OTPs she received. The first defendant would do this by using the WhatsApp
group chat.

94 In her oral evidence, the first defendant adamantly denied that her
assistance was needed to effect transactions on the account through online
banking. Under cross-examination, she claimed for the first time that Mr
Jackson had asked her to install an application on her mobile phone that would
automatically forward any SMS she received to an email address at DMB to which
Mr Jackson and/or Ms Flynn had access. She claimed that she did install such
an application, which was called “SMS forwarder”. 117

##### Foot Note 117

Transcript, 25 November 2020, p 153 lines 16–19; TJ’s AEIC at p 329.

However, the first defendant failed to adduce any evidence at all to show that
“SMS forwarder” was ever installed on her mobile phone. 118

##### Foot Note 118

×

Transcript, 26 November 2020, p 24 lines 3–17.

This is even though this would be easy for her to do given that, according to
her, the application can be found on her mobile phone. I also find this
evidence to be less than credible because this explanation that “SMS
forwarder” had been installed in her mobile phone was not mentioned anywhere
in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief.

95 While it is true that, in the WhatsApp messages between the first defendant
and Mr Jackson, there was a brief discussion about possibly using “SMS
forwarder”, 119

##### Foot Note 119

×

TJ’s AEIC at p 329.

Mr Jackson’s and Ms Flynn’s evidence was that it was never eventually
installed. 120

##### Foot Note 120

Transcript, 20 November 2020, p 147 lines 15–22; Transcript, 24 November 2020,

I find it significant that it was also never put to Mr Jackson or Ms Flynn,
when they were cross-examined, that the SMS messages sent to the first
defendant’s mobile number were also received by them through the use of the
“SMS forwarder” application. Neither was there any reference in the “EPS”
WhatsApp group chat or any WhatsApp exchanges or emails between the first
defendant and Mr Jackson and/or Ms Flynn that “SMS forwarder” or any similar
application had ever been installed or was being used. 121

##### Foot Note 121

×

Transcript, 25 November 2020, p 165 lines 12–25.

Given the state of the evidence before me, I reject the first defendant’s
evidence about the use of “SMS forwarder” as yet another fabricated excuse.

96 I should add that the undisputed facts and the exchanges in the “EPS”
WhatsApp group chat support the conclusion that the first defendant’s
assistance was vital before any transactions could be effected over the online
platform in relation to the second defendant’s DBS Bank account. There were at
least two occasions when Ms Flynn had to urgently contact the first defendant
over the group chat to ask for the OTP so that Ms Flynn could effect a
transaction online for the DBS Bank account. If there was an “SMS forwarder”
application being used, there would have been no need for Ms Flynn to seek the
first defendant’s assistance to effect transactions on the account. 122

Loss of control over the DBS Bank account

97 As already mentioned at [20] above, from 9 to 15 October 2018, the second
defendant’s DBS Bank account was credited, in four separate transfers, with a
total amount of approximately US$1,028,455. Through the “EPS” WhatsApp group
chat, the first defendant was informed of these funds being credited to the
account.

98 On 18 October 2018, Ms Flynn was instructed by the plaintiff to make a
payment of €198,000 from the second defendant’s account to Digimark Inc, a
Canadian-registered company that had provided online advertising services for
Eat Pray Shop. Ms Flynn then contacted the first defendant and told her of the
intended payment, because she needed her assistance by providing the OTP that
she received from the bank. The first defendant sent a WhatsApp message to Ms
Flynn with the OTP that the bank had sent her. She later also sent a message
to the “EPS” WhatsApp group chat that she had received an SMS text from the
bank to notify her that the payment to Digimark Inc had been effected. 123

99 This turned out to be untrue because, on 19 October 2018, Ms Flynn accessed
the online banking platform and it showed that the balance of US$1,028,455 was
intact. There had been no payment to Digimark Inc. 124

100 Then, on 22 October 2018, Ms Flynn found that she could no longer access

to the second defendant’s bank account. The online banking login details were
no longer working. 125

In short, she had been locked out of online access to the second defendant’s
bank account.

101 From the evidence that emerged at the trial, it is now clear what had
transpired. The first defendant gave evidence that, on or prior to 20 October
2018, she had requested DBS Bank for new login details to access online
banking. In fact, since the login details arrived by a letter dated 20 October
2018, the first defendant’s request must have been made prior to that date.
This request caused the bank to automatically invalidate the confidential PIN
that had been set up by Ms Flynn and to reset it with a new confidential PIN.

That explains why Ms Flynn was not able to access the online banking platform
to view the balances and transactions on the second defendant’s bank account
on 22 October 2018 and thereafter.

102 In this regard, the first defendant’s oral evidence that she requested the
bank for a new confidential PIN shows two possibilities. One is that the first
defendant had told a blatant untruth in both her affidavit of evidence-in-
chief and an affidavit sworn by her on 2 December 2019 for an interlocutory
application for summary judgment. In both affidavits, the first defendant had
unequivocally stated: “I did not request a new Organisation ID, User ID and/or
PIN prior to 20 October 2018”. 127

The other possibility is that the first defendant is, for reasons only known
to herself, lying now in her oral evidence. I find the former to be more
likely to be the case. Either way, it is quite clear to me that the first
defendant has no qualms about lying on oath. She is a witness with little to
no credibility at all.

103 According to the first defendant’s claim at the trial, the new
confidential PIN requested by the first defendant was sent to the registered
address of the second defendant. Under cross-examination, the first defendant
further admitted that, once the new confidential PIN was received at the
registered office of the second defendant on 24 October 2018, it would have
been sent to her by In.Corp, which was providing company secretarial services
for the second defendant. She further conceded that, once she was in
possession of the new confidential PIN, she would be able to log in and access
the online banking platform. 128

104 Given these facts, I find that, from 24 October 2018 onwards, it was the
first defendant who was in control of the second defendant’s DBS Bank account,
in that she had free rein to effect transfers out of the account using the
online banking platform. This is because of the indisputable fact that she had
the new login details to carry out online banking on the second defendant’s
bank account and, more significantly, the fact that her mobile phone number
was registered with DBS Bank. She was the one who was able to receive the OTPs
sent by the bank that would have been required for the transactions to be
effected online.

105 It follows from my findings above that the transfers of funds out of the
second defendant’s bank account that took place from 25 October to 1 November
2018 must have been effected by the first defendant. I do not accept her
evidence that the account had been “hacked” as she claimed. If it were true
that the first defendant discovered sometime on or around 31 October 2018 that
the account had been “hacked”, one would expect that the first defendant’s
natural reaction would have been to lodge a police report or, at least, to
raise an alarm to the bank, who would then have frozen the account, so that
the funds in the bank account would not be siphoned off. Yet, nothing of this
sort was done, as there is no evidence at all before me that the first
defendant had lodged a police report or complained to DBS Bank that there had
been any unauthorised access or “hacking” of the second defendant’s bank
account. 129

However, the first defendant claimed that DBS Bank had advised her to file a

police in Vienna that this was a “civil matter”. 131

I find this to be an incredible explanation. If this were true, it is
unbelievable that the first defendant would then leave the matter hanging and
not pursue some recourse to reclaim the dissipated moneys, or inform Mr
Jackson and/or Ms Flynn immediately and ask for their instructions, or, at the
very least, update DBS Bank about what the police in Vienna told her so that
she can be advised on the next steps, since it is the first defendant’s case
that it was DBS Bank who advised her to call the police. In any event, there
is not a shred of evidence to show that the first defendant ever communicated
to DBS Bank that the bank account had been “hacked” and that the second
defendant’s moneys had been “stolen”. The critical point here is that the
first defendant’s evidence that the account had been “hacked” is highly
improbable.

107 In any event, I reject the first defendant’s evidence that she discovered
the transfers out of the second defendant’s bank account only on 1 or 2
November 2018. The first defendant admitted that she would receive SMS
notifications whenever a transaction had been effected in the second
defendant’s bank account. 132

As such, the first defendant would have received SMS notifications for all ten
transfers of funds out of the second defendant that took place from 25 October
to 1 November 2018. It is utterly unbelievable for the first defendant to
claim as she did that she did not check her text messages that time. 133

That cannot be accepted as the truth because, in this very period, she was in
constant communication over the phone with Ms Flynn, who was desperate to find
out why she had been locked out of online access to the second defendant’s
account.

108 An examination of the recipients of the funds transferred out in the
period from 25 October to 1 November 2018 (see [20] above) also leads one to
the conclusion that the first defendant must have been the one behind the
transfers. The first defendant did not dispute that the recipients of the
moneys were “accounts held by the [first defendant] and/or accounts controlled
by the [first defendant]”. 134

See P’s AEIC at [114].

For instance, of the ten transfers, six of them were to EPS Hong Kong, the
Hong Kong company which the first defendant set up and controlled. There was
one transfer of US$95,140.96 to Tasmania Ltd, which is a company that the
first defendant admitted to owning and controlling. There were even transfers
to the second defendant’s separate, German bank account, 135

which clearly were not set up pursuant to either the plaintiff’s or Mr
Jackson’s instructions.

109 The first defendant’s conduct when Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn were
frantically trying to find out what happened to the funds in the second
defendant’s bank account is also telling. She was reluctant to assist them in
obtaining information from the bank as to the alleged “hacking” and where the
funds had been transferred to. She started making accusations against Mr
Jackson and Ms Flynn that they had involved her in criminal activities. She
was often unresponsive to their texts and emails. She refused to execute the
necessary documents for the transfer of ownership and control of the second
defendant to the plaintiff. 136

##### Foot Note 136

See SF’s AEIC at [21]–[29]; TJ’s AEIC at [97]–[110].

It is obvious that all this was done with the devious intent of delaying the
discovery of her dishonest actions and impeding the recovery of the funds.

110 In my judgment, given my assessment of the totality of the evidence before
me, I find that the first defendant had acted to deliberately prevent Ms Flynn
and Mr Jackson from having online access to the second defendant’s DBS Bank
account, so that she could then effect the transfers out of the account. To
put things bluntly, she had schemed to get her hands on the funds in the
second defendant’s account and she succeeded in doing so.

111 Therefore, I find that the Unauthorised Transfers and the Continuous
Unauthorised Transfers were effected by the first defendant out of the second
defendant’s DBS bank account, and that this was done without any actual
authority – whether express or implied – conferred by the plaintiff.
Consequently, the first defendant breached her duty under the Agency
Agreement. I also find that, by effecting the Unauthorised Transfers and the
Continuous Unauthorised Transfers to dissipate the funds from the second
defendant’s DBS bank account to unauthorised recipients (controlled by the
first defendant, no less), the first defendant had clearly breached her
fiduciary duties to act bona fide in the plaintiff’s best interests and to act
for proper purposes.

112 For completeness, I note that, while the plaintiff pleaded that the first
defendant acted as a trustee (of the second defendant’s shares and the second
defendant’s funds), the plaintiff did not plead that the first defendant
committed a breach of trust in relation to the second defendant’s funds (see
[27] above). This is correct because the first defendant is not, strictly
speaking, a trustee of the funds in the second defendant’s DBS bank account.
This is because the first defendant is only the nominee director and
shareholder of the second defendant for the plaintiff. Consequently, title to
the second defendant’s assets is not vested in the first defendant herself,
but rather is vested in the second defendant: see Sim Poh Ping v Winsta
Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals [2020] 1 SLR 1199 (“Sim Poh
Ping”) at [109]. Therefore, the first defendant did not commit any breaches of
trust by misapplying those funds. Instead, she committed custodial breaches of
fiduciary duty.

113 Before I turn to the question of the appropriate relief below, I shall
first consider the question of illegality raised by the first defendant.

Is the plaintiff’s claim barred by illegality or considerations of public
policy?

114 Given my findings above, the first defendant is prima facie liable to the
plaintiff for breach of her obligations as a nominee by (a) making
unauthorised withdrawals from the second defendant’s DBS Bank account, and (b)
refusing to relinquish control of the second defendant to the plaintiff. She
has no claim to ownership of the second defendant or its funds.

115 In the defence, the defendants plead that the plaintiff’s claim should not
be allowed as a matter of public policy. It goes on to aver that the second
defendant did not carry out any bona fide business; that the plaintiff, Mr
Jackson and Ms Flynn were engaged in money laundering; and hence that they
were involved in illegal acts. It was also averred that the first defendant
was unaware of this illegality because she had been misled by Mr Jackson into
thinking that the second defendant was set up for a legitimate online
business. 137

Defence Amd 2 at [22]–[23].

116 The defendants’ submissions on this issue engages the doctrine of
illegality. The principles on the doctrine of illegality have been clarified
and summarised by the Court of Appeal’s decision in Ochroid Trading Ltd and
another v Chua Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import & Export) and another [2018] 1
SLR 363 (“Ochroid Trading”). The Court of Appeal set out a two-stage framework
to determine if an agreement may be unenforceable due to illegality (Ochroid
Trading at [64] and [65]).

117 At the first stage, the court ascertains whether the contract (and not the
conduct) is prohibited either pursuant to a statute (“statutory illegality”)
or an established head of common law public policy (“common law illegality”)
(Ochroid Trading at [22] and [64]). If the contract is so prohibited by
statute, then there can be no recovery whatsoever pursuant to the illegal
contract, as the contract is void and unenforceable. This is not relevant in
this case, as the defendants are not alleging that the Agency Agreement itself
is illegal and prohibited by statute. Rather, the defendants’ argument is that
the Agency Agreement is tainted by illegality as it seeks to commit a crime,
viz, money laundering.

118 Therefore, the relevant issue at hand is not statutory illegality but
common law illegality. If the contract falls foul of established heads of
common law public policy, then that would also render the contract
unenforceable on the basis that it is contrary to public policy. Examples of
the contracts rendered unenforceable under established heads of common law
public policy include contracts prejudicial to the administration of justice
(such as contracts to stifle a prosecution) and contracts to commit a crime,
tort or fraud (Ochroid Trading at [29]).

119 Where the contract is not unlawful per se but is tainted by illegality in
that it nevertheless involves the commission of a legal wrong in their
formation, purpose or manner of performance, the enforcement of such a
contract is subject to the limiting principle of proportionality (Ochroid
Trading at [39] and [64]). This means that the court has to consider if it
would be a proportionate response to the illegality to refuse to enforce the
contract.

120 If the contract is prohibited, the court then moves on to the second stage
of the inquiry to ascertain whether, notwithstanding the fact that there can
be no recovery pursuant to the (illegal) contract, there might, nevertheless,
be restitutionary recovery of the benefits conferred thereunder (as opposed to
recovery of full contractual damages) (Ochroid Trading at [42] and [65]). As
for such other independent causes of action (such as unjust enrichment, tort
and trusts), the guiding principle is stultification. To stultify is to “make
nonsense of”. Thus, the independent cause of action will be precluded where
allowing it will undermine the fundamental policy that rendered the underlying
contract void and unenforceable in the first place (Ochroid Trading at [145]
and [168]).

121 As already mentioned, statutory illegality is irrelevant here. The
potentially applicable head of common law public policy raised by the
defendants is the category of contracts stated at [119] above – contracts
entered into with the object of committing an illegal act: see Ting Siew May v
Boon Lay Choo and another [2014] 3 SLR 609 (“Ting Siew May”) at [42]–[43]. The
application of this principle depends upon “proof of the intent, at the time
the contract was made, to break the law” [emphasis in original omitted;
emphasis added in italics]. If the intent is mutual, the contract is not
enforceable at all. If the intent is unilateral, the contract is unenforceable
at the suit of the party who is proved to have it: Ting Siew May at [43],
citing St John Shipping Corp v Joseph Rank Ltd [1957] 1 QB 267 at 283.

122 Needless to say, it is the defendants who shoulder the burden of proving
their allegations of illegality: specifically, that the plaintiff (if not both
parties) harboured the intent to enter into the Agency Agreement to commit
money laundering. 138

##### Foot Note 138

Defence Amd 2 at [22.1].

This follows from ss 103 and 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), as
it is the defendants who are seeking to persuade this Court that the Agency
Agreement was entered into with the object of committing money laundering,
which are acts prohibited by statute in Singapore (see, for instance, ss 46–47
of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of
Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed)).

123 Bearing this in mind, I was surprised that, at trial, counsel for the
defendants did not even put their case of illegality to the plaintiff, Mr
Jackson or Ms Flynn, save to broadly suggest to the plaintiff that the source
of the funds in the second defendant’s bank account was “potentially illicit”,
139

and to suggest to Mr Jackson that the DBS Bank account was to be used for an
illicit purpose. 140

In fact, all of the plaintiff’s and his witnesses’ evidence as to how the Eat
Pray Shop business operated, how the business was marketed, how the sales took
place, who were the customers, and how the sales revenue was processed and
then paid to the second defendant, were substantially unrebutted at trial.

124 It will also be recalled that it was the first defendant’s evidence that
she was operating the online business set up by Mr Jackson for her, and hence
she was entitled to the moneys in the second defendant’s bank account (see
[65] above). The glaring inconsistency between the first defendant’s evidence
and the pleaded case of illegality, which involved showing that the second
defendant had no legitimate business, was irreconcilable. In this regard, it
bears emphasising that, while a party in civil proceedings in Singapore has a
common law right to plead and advance factually inconsistent claims, the
inconsistency “cannot – particularly in relation to the facts pleaded – offend
common sense”: Ng Chee Weng v Lim Jit Ming Bryan and another [2012] 1 SLR 457
(“Ng Chee Weng”) at [31]–[37]. For instance, while alternative claims of fraud
and negligence are acceptable, it would be impermissible for a party to plead
that the party has actual knowledge of two opposite alternative facts: see Ng
Chee Weng at [36]–[38]. Essentially, therefore, alternative factual claims are
permissible if one claim is the subset of the other alternative claim. On the
other hand, alternative claims are impermissible if they are logical
opposites. This is the case for the first defendant’s claims that (a) the
agreement was that the second defendant was a legitimate online business was
set up for her and that (b) the business of the second defendant was set up
for the plaintiff’s illegal acts. Indeed, at one point of her oral evidence,
the first defendant even unequivocally stated that the second defendant was
“[her] business” and “has nothing to do with [the] plaintiff”. 141

Thus, the plaintiff cannot make the inconsistent claim that the second
defendant was set up for the plaintiff’s illegal acts.

125 The defendants also did not lead any evidence to show that the plaintiff
was involved in any illegal activities. It seemed to me that the defendants
were merely resting their case on vague allegations by the first defendant of
criminal wrongdoing on the part of the plaintiff, Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn,
without any kind of substantiation. While counsel for the defendants made some
suggestion during cross-examination that the plaintiff and Mr Jackson had not
produced enough documents to corroborate their oral evidence that Eat Pray
Shop was a bona fide business, 142

##### Foot Note 142

this was far from sufficient to discharge the defendants’ evidential burden.
The defendants also chose not to file any submissions after trial, which
certainly did not assist me in showing how the defence of illegality or public
policy has been made out on the evidence. There is simply no basis, on the
state of the evidence, for me to find that there was intent on the plaintiff’s
part to enter into the Agency Agreement to commit money laundering, or that
the second defendant had in fact been used by the plaintiff for money
laundering purposes.

126 I should point out that, at the trial, counsel for the defendants did
spend some time cross-examining the plaintiff on his use of “MeikoPay”, 143

##### Foot Note 143

which is a licensed payment processing solutions brand operated by Shenzhen
Hongzhanzheng Trading Co Ltd, a company incorporated in China. The plaintiff
had given evidence that he used MeikoPay as the payment processing solutions
provider for the Eat Pay Shop business. 144

and that the MeikoPay documents disclosed by the plaintiff were not authentic.

In other words, counsel appeared to be suggesting that the payments received
by the second defendant into its bank account were not actually from MeikoPay
or its agents, but from elsewhere.

127 However, as I pointed out to counsel, the defendants had not challenged
the authenticity of several MeikoPay statements issued to the second defendant
that had been discovered by the plaintiff in his list of documents dated 29
October 2019. There was no inspection of these documents. It was only on 16
November 2020, the day before the commencement of the trial, that the
defendants issued a notice of non-admission of the MeikoPay statements. In
this regard, O 27 rr 4(1)–4(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev
Ed) (“ROC”) provide:

Admission and production of documents specified in list of documents (O. 27,
r. 4)

4.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and without prejudice to the right of a party
to object to the admission in evidence of any document, a party on whom a list
of documents is served in pursuance of any provision of Order 24 or any order
made thereunder shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be deemed to admit —

(a) that any document described in the list as an original document is such a
document and was printed, written, signed or executed as it purports
respectively to have been; and

(b) that any document described therein as a copy is a true copy.

This paragraph does not apply to a document the authenticity of which the
party has denied in his pleading.

(2) If before the expiration of 14 days after inspection of the documents
specified in a list of documents or after the time limited for inspection of
those documents expires, whichever is the later, the party to whom the list is
served serves on the party whose list it is a notice stating, in relation to
any documents specified therein, that he does not admit the authenticity of
that document and requires it to be proved at the trial, he shall not be
deemed to make any admission in relation to that document under paragraph (1).

[emphasis added]

128 As explained by the Court of Appeal in Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper
Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals [2006] 3 SLR(R) 769
at [73]:

… O 27 r 4(1) expressly provides that subject to r 4(2), a party is deemed to
admit the authenticity of the documents in his opponent’s lists of documents.
This suggests that the default position under the Rules of Court is that
provided for in r 4(1), namely, that a party is deemed to admit the
authenticity of a document contained in his opponent’s lists. That being the
case, a party is generally deemed to admit authenticity unless he can bring
himself within O 27 r 4(2) by showing that he had actually issued a notice of
non-admission within the requisite window of time. … [emphasis added]

129 Thus, the defendants are deemed to admit to the authenticity of the
MeikoPay documents that are now being objected to since (a) the defendants did
not deny the authenticity of these documents in their pleadings and (b) the
defendants did not issue a notice of non-admission within the requisite 14
days.

130 When I queried the defendants’ counsel as to how he planned to overcome
the fact that, by operation of the ROC, the defendants had already lost their
right to challenge the authenticity of the MeikoPay statements through their
failure to file notices of non-admission within the time permitted by the ROC,
he replied to say that the plaintiff would suffer no prejudice.

131 I am unable to agree. No reasonable explanation has been provided by the
defendants as to why this notice of non-admission was filed so late.
Critically, the first defendant did not even deny the authenticity of the
relevant MeikoPay documents in her AEIC. In these circumstances, it is
certainly far too late to raise objections of authenticity on the eve of the
trial for documents discovered more than a year ago. If such late objections
are allowed, parties might have to scramble to search for an appropriate
witness to prove the authenticity of documents even as the trial is
progressing. This might lead to trial dates being vacated, or trials being
part-heard because a witness that is needed to prove the authenticity of a
documents is not available at short notice. In this case, the plaintiff would
suffer prejudice because he would then have to locate and persuade someone
from Shenzhen Hongzhanzheng Trading Co Ltd to agree to give evidence as to the
provenance of the MeikoPay documents before he would be able to close his
case, and all this while the trial is already ongoing.

132 In any event, I find that the suggestions by the defendants that MeikoPay
was not really used, and that the MeikoPay documents were of doubtful
authenticity, are without basis. Mr Jackson gave evidence that he received
documents directly from MeikoPay. 147

##### Foot Note 147

See P’s AEIC at [73].

He then sent, amongst other things, the first defendant the MeikoPay Credit
Card Online Payment Merchant Agreement (the “MeikoPay agreement”) by WhatsApp.
From her messages in response, she acknowledged receipt of the MeikoPay
agreement, signed it and sent the signed copy back to Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn.

These WhatsApp exchanges took place in the “EPS” WhatsApp group chat.

133 While the defendants, again, attempted a last minute objection to the
authenticity of these WhatsApp exchanges, the forensic expert in information
technology called by the plaintiff, Mr Gino Bello, gave evidence that the
messages, and its attachments, were authentic, and had in fact been
transmitted and had not been tampered with. 149

Mr Bello was not cross-examined on his expert report. Neither was there any
contradictory expert evidence adduced by the defendants. Furthermore, it was
never put to Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn during their cross-examination that these
messages were fabricated or had been doctored with. When she took the stand,
the first defendant also did not deny that these messages were sent by her
during her cross-examination. As such, I accept that the plaintiff has proven
that the MeikoPay documents, including the MeikoPay agreement, are authentic.

134 In sum, the defendants have failed to show that Eat Pray Shop is not a
bona fide business, that there was criminal activity or money laundering
involved, or that the payments received by the second defendant originated
from dubious sources. I also find that the defendants have failed to show that
the plaintiff intended to enter into the Agency Agreement to commit money
laundering or any illegal act for that matter. As such, I find that the
defendants have not established their case that the plaintiff’s claims should
be barred by public policy because of illegality.

Remedies

135 Given my findings that the first defendant, by her actions, was clearly in
breach of the agreement that she would act as a nominee in relation to her
position as a shareholder and director of the second defendant, and that she
had also thereby breached her fiduciary duties, there is no need for me to
deal with the alternative claims in conspiracy and unjust enrichment. These
other claims do not add anything in terms of the remedies to which the first
plaintiff is entitled.

136 I now turn to the appropriate remedies in this case. It is trite that
double recovery is impermissible, so the plaintiff cannot be compensated twice
for the same loss stemming from the breaches of the Agency Agreement and
fiduciary duties: see Tonny Permana at [117]. The plaintiff seeks the
following remedies: 150

##### Foot Note 150

×

SOC Amd 2 at prayers 1–6.

(a) a declaration that the first defendant holds the shares of the second
defendant on trust for the plaintiff;

(b) an order that the first defendant, within 14 days, transfer free from
encumbrances the shares of the second defendant to the plaintiff;

(c) an order that the second defendant, within 14 days, register its shares
held by the first defendant under the name of the plaintiff;

(d) an order that the first defendant, within 14 days, return all bank tokens,
cheques, financial statements, email accounts and documents relating to the
second defendant;

(e) an order that:

… the 1st Defendant does account on a wilful default basis of the Unauthorised
Transfers and return to the Plaintiff for the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers
and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amounting to USD $1,028,455.00, and
any and all profits, benefits, gains and/or assets arising from, relating to
and/or in connection with the Funds and/or the Unauthorised Transfers and/or
the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers (the “Assets”), and an order that all
such Assets be paid over and/or delivered up upon such account to the
Plaintiff. [emphasis added]

(f) and damages to be assessed.

137 I have already found that the true beneficial owner of the shares of the
second defendant is the plaintiff. Therefore, I grant a declaration that all
the shares in the second defendant are held on trust by the first defendant
for the plaintiff. Consequent to this, I order the first defendant to, within
14 days hereof, transfer all the shares in the second defendant to the
plaintiff. The defendants are also to return all bank tokens, cheques,
financial statements, email accounts and all other documents which belong to
the second defendant to the plaintiff.

138 For the breach of the Agency Agreement, the plaintiff is entitled to
damages, and it is trite that this would generally be on an expectation
measure: see Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and
others and another appeal [2018] 2 SLR 655 at [125]. On the other hand, the
appropriate remedy for a breach of fiduciary duty depends on the specific
circumstances of the breach. Breaches of fiduciary duties can be divided into
custodial and non-custodial breaches. A non-custodial breach does not involve
the stewardship of assets already entrusted to the fiduciary, while a
custodial breach results in the misapplication of the principal’s funds: Sim
Poh Ping at [104]–[106]. The usual remedy for a breach of a non-custodial
fiduciary duty would be the compensatory monetary award of equitable
compensation.

139 As for a custodial breach, the Court of Appeal in Sim Poh Ping (at
[108]–[109]) observed that there is “good reason for the remedial principles
targeting the misapplication of funds to apply to a custodial breach”
[emphasis in original omitted], as the wrong is done to the principal’s funds
placed under the fiduciary’s custody. The remedy for a custodial breach is
substitutive in that it seeks to restore the trust fund or the fund of the
principal either in specie or by a monetary sum in lieu. For a custodial
breach, there should be a causal link between the breach and the subject
matter of the breach that is sought to be restored. However, the role which
causation plays in the situation of a custodial breach is a limited one,
meaning that the court will not go further to determine whether the loss would
still have occurred in the absence of the trustee’s or custodial fiduciary’s
breach of duty. On the other hand, equitable compensation and surcharging are
reparative in nature, and thus seek to “repair” the loss that has been caused
to the principal or the trust fund. In particular, the term “equitable
compensation” should be used only by reference to the reparative remedy sought
for non-custodial breaches of fiduciary duty, and not for the remedy sought
for a custodial breaches or for a breach of the management stewardship duty of
a trustee: Sim Poh Ping at [114]–[115] and [124]–[126].

140 It is evident from the reliefs sought by the plaintiff that he has claimed
remedies that flow from the breach of fiduciary duty. As already mentioned,
the remedy of damages that flow from the contractual breach of the Agency
Agreement is allowed, but double recovery will not be permitted. I shall turn
my attention now to the former.

141 It is clear that the present case involves a custodial breach of fiduciary
duty. There is a clear causal link between the breach and the quantum of the
Unauthorised Transfers and Continuous Unauthorised Transfers.

142 However, it is very unclear what exactly was the total quantum of money
that was misapplied by the first defendant. The plaintiff’s pleadings and
closing submissions are very loosely drafted on this issue.

(a) The quantum of the Funds, which were deposited into the second defendant’s
DBS bank account from 9 October 2018 to 15 October 2018, is US$1,028,455.00.
This was stated in the plaintiff’s statement of claim (amendment no. 2) at
paragraphs 15 and 16, closing submissions at paragraph 186, and a letter to
court at paragraph 3(a) dated 4 May 2021 (“the 4 May letter”). The 4 May
letter to court was in response to this Court’s questions for clarification.

(b) The quantum of Unauthorised Transfers from 25 October 2018 to 12 November
2018 is US$1,070,950.02. This was clearly stated in Annex A of the plaintiff’s
closing submissions and at paragraph 3(b) of the 4 May letter.

(c) However, the plaintiff has, at numerous points of his statement of claim
and closing submissions, equated the Unauthorised Transfers with the sum of
US$1,028,455.00.

(i) At paragraph 186 of the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff
confusingly equated the sum of US$1,028,455.00 and the Funds with “the
Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers”:

186\. Further and/or alternatively, the Plaintiff seeks an order that the 1st
Defendant does account on a wilful default basis of the Unauthorised Transfers
and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amounting to the Funds i.e. USD
$1,028,455.00. [emphasis added]

(ii) At paragraph 198(5) of the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff
even more explicitly asked for a return of the Unauthorised Transfers and/or
Continuous Unauthorised Transfers “amounting to USD $1,028,455.00”, even
though neither the Unauthorised Transfers nor the Continuous Unauthorised
Transfers tally with the sum of US$1,028,455.00 (the Unauthorised Transfers
are US$1,070,950.02; the Net Unauthorised Transfers, after deduction of the
various corresponding returns during the same period, are US$572,617.65; the
Continuous Unauthorised Transfers are US$877,135.16; and the Net Continuous
Unauthorised Transfers are US$442,068.88, which means that the total sum
misappropriated from the second defendant’s DBS bank account would be
US$1,014,686.53 (US$572,617.65 plus US$442,068.88)).

198\. The Plaintiff therefore claims: … (5) An order that the 1st Defendant
returns the Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers
amounting to USD $1,028,455.00. [emphasis added]

(iii) Similarly, at paragraph 198(6) of the plaintiff’s closing submissions,
the plaintiff asked for an account of the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers and/or
Continuous Unauthorised Transfers “amounting to USD $1,028,455.00”,

198\. The Plaintiff therefore claims: … (6) An order that the 1st Defendant
does account on a wilful default basis of the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers
and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amounting to USD $1,028,455.00, and
any and all profits, benefits, gains and/or assets arising from, relating to
and/or in connection with the Funds and/or the Unauthorised Transfers and/or
the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers (the “Assets”), and an order that all
such Assets be paid over and/or delivered up upon such account to the
Plaintiff. [emphasis added]

(iv) At page 14, point (5), of the plaintiff’s statement of claim (amendment
no. 2), the plaintiff sought an order that the first defendant “account on a
wilful default basis of the Unauthorised Transfers and return to the Plaintiff
for the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers
amounting to USD $1,028,455.00” (emphasis added; see [136(e)] above). This is,
again, confusing. On one hand, the use of the conjunctive word “and” suggests
that the total quantum of the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers and Continuous
Unauthorised Transfers is US$1,028,455.00. This is inaccurate. The use of the
conjunctive word “or” is equally unhelpful, because that suggests that the
Unauthorised Transfers and/or the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amount to
US$1,028,455.00 (which is also not accurate).

143 Therefore, it is quite unclear what exactly is the total sum that was
misapplied and misappropriated by the first defendant from the second
defendant’s DBS account. If only US$1,028,455.00 was deposited into the
account, then I agree that it seems, logically, that only that amount could
have been misapplied and misappropriated by the first defendant. It is perhaps
for this reason that the plaintiff is only claiming for a return of
US$1,028,455.00. However, as already highlighted, the Unauthorised Transfers
amount to US$1,070,950.02; the Net Unauthorised Transfers amount to
US$572,617.65; the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers are US$877,135.16, and
the Net Continuous Unauthorised Transfers are US$442,068.88. If so, it would
seem that the total sum misappropriated from the second defendant’s DBS bank
account should be about US$1,014,686.53 (US$572,617.65 plus US$442,068.88).
Indeed, there appears to be €9,545.15 (about US$10,851.45) and £122.73 (about
US$156.62), which amount to a total amount of about US$11,008.07, left in the
second defendant’s DBS account. 151

144 Nevertheless, it is clear that at least US$1,028,455.00 has been
misapplied and misappropriated from the second defendant’s DBS bank account,
since the total sum of the Unauthorised Transfers and the Continuous
Unauthorised Transfers amount to more than the sum of the Funds, and the
second defendant’s DBS bank account has been almost completely depleted. While
there is a need for a causal link, the sense in which causation appears in the
situation of a custodial fiduciary breach is a limited one, meaning that the
court does not go further to determine whether the loss would still have
occurred in the absence of the breach of duty. Therefore, subject to what I
will say about the remedy of an account of profits, the plaintiff is entitled
to a claim of substitutive compensation to the plaintiff, as the principal,
for the sum of US$1,028,455.00. This is, in any event, the quantum of the sum
which the plaintiff is seeking to be returned to him.

145 The plaintiff also seeks an account on a wilful default basis by the first
defendant of the Unauthorised Transfers so that all profits arising from the
Unauthorised Transfers can be determined and delivered to the plaintiff (see
[136(e)] above). There appears to be a conflation between an account on a
wilful basis and an account of profits here.

146 An account on a wilful default basis and a common account are procedures
for the accounting of funds. A common account does not depend on wrongdoing,
so the beneficiary is entitled “as of right” to be given a common account of
the trustee’s stewardship of the trust assets (ie, an account for what was
actually received and the trustee’s disbursement and distribution of it). An
account on a wilful default basis is premised on misconduct by the trustee and
is not available to a beneficiary as of right. Thus, the beneficiary must
prove at least one act of wilful neglect or default. The scope of an account
on a wilful default basis is wider than that of a common account, as the
trustee is not only required to account for what he has received, but also for
what he might have received had it not been for the default. Following the
taking of an account, the beneficiary is entitled to ask for an inquiry to
discover what the trustee did with any money that was misappropriated: see UVJ
and others v UVH and others and another appeal [2020] 2 SLR 336 (“UVJ”) at
[23]–[27].

147 The account, once furnished, may by challenged because it discloses
discrepancies. The beneficiary may then decide whether to seek an order for
the falsification of a discrepant entry or for the surcharging of the account.
For the latter order of surcharging, the asset will be treated as if the
trustee had performed his duty and obtained it for the benefit of the trust,
so the trustee will be “ordered to make good the deficiency in the trust by
payment of a monetary award”: see Sim Poh Ping at [120]; UVJ at [24] and [28].

148 As alluded to above, it appears that what the plaintiff is presently
seeking is an account on a wilful default basis, even though he also refers to
an account of the unauthorised profits made by the first defendant (see
[136(e)] above). Unlike the taking of accounts, which is a procedure, an
account of profits is a remedy that arises as an alternative to equitable
compensation, and is available when a fiduciary makes unauthorised profits:
see Sim Poh Ping at [105]. An account of profits is conceptually distinct from
a surcharge, as the former is focused on the gain to the fiduciary while the
latter is focused on the loss to the trust fund: see UVJ at [28]; Sim Poh Ping
at [120]–[121].

149 As the plaintiff’s primary claim is for the return of the sum of
US$1,028,455.00, I shall focus not on the remedy of an account of profits, but
rather on whether an account on a wilful default basis is appropriate. In any
event, the taking of accounts may also reveal breaches of fiduciary duty for
which an inquiry and account of profits may subsequently be ordered: see UVJ
at [27] and [29].

150 Though the cases generally discuss the taking of accounts in the context
of a trustee’s breach, the taking of accounts is also available against a
custodial fiduciary: see UVJ at [29], endorsing Lalwani Shalini Gobind and
another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal [2017] SGHC 90 at [26]. Therefore, the first
defendant, as a custodial fiduciary, is also liable to account. Given the
egregious nature of the first defendant’s conduct, I find that the account by
the first defendant is more appropriately to be conducted on a wilful default
basis rather than on a common basis. The fact that the total sum
misappropriated seems to be larger than the sum deposited into the second
defendant’s DBS bank account (see [143] above) also reinforces my conclusion
that an account on a wilful default basis is clearly necessary.

151 However, I note that there is a potential inconsistency between the
remedies sought by the plaintiff. Substitutive compensation of the sum of
US$1,028,455.00 would require the first defendant to restore those
unauthorised transfers to the plaintiff’s fund either in specie or by a
monetary sum in lieu (see [139] above). However, the plaintiff seeks, through
the account on a wilful default basis, to ultimately disgorge the unauthorised
profits earned by the first defendant as a result of the Unauthorised
Transfers (see [136(e)] above). This is permissible, as explained by Lord
Millet in Libertarian Investments at [169], as endorsed by the Court of Appeal
in UVJ at [27]:

169\. But the plaintiff is not bound to ask for the disbursement to be
disallowed. He is entitled to ask for an inquiry to discover what the
defendant did with the trust money which he misappropriated and whether he
dissipated it or invested it, and if he invested it whether he did so at a
profit or a loss. If he dissipated it or invested it at a loss, the plaintiff
will naturally have the disbursement disallowed and disclaim any interest in
the property in which it was invested by treating it as bought with the
defendant’s own money. If, however, the defendant invested the money at a
profit, the plaintiff is not bound to ask for the disbursement to be
disallowed. He can treat it as an authorised disbursement, treat the property
in which it has been invested as acquired with trust money, and follow or
trace the property and demand that it or its traceable proceeds be restored to
the trust in specie. [Court of Appeal’s emphasis in UVJ in italics; emphasis
added in bold italics]

152 However, therein lies the potential inconsistency which might arise. If it
transpires that the plaintiff recovers the unauthorised disbursement, ie,
US$1,028,455.00, by, eg, the first defendant paying the plaintiff that sum,
then he might no longer be entitled to elect to treat the misapplied
disbursement as an authorised disbursement and demand that it or its traceable
proceeds be restored to the plaintiff’s funds in specie.

153 In this regard, I find Lord Millett’s observations in Libertarian
Investments at [172], which were endorsed by the Court of Appeal in UVJ at
[27], to be instructive:

172\. At every stage the plaintiff can elect whether or not to seek a further
account or inquiry. The amount of any unauthorised disbursement is often
established by evidence at the trial, so that the plaintiff does not need an
account but can ask for an award of the appropriate amount of compensation. Or
he may be content with a monetary award rather than attempt to follow or trace
the money, in which case he will not ask for an inquiry as to what has become
of the trust property. In short, he may elect not to call for an account or
further inquiry if it is unnecessary or unlikely to be fruitful, though the
court will always have the last word. [Court of Appeal’s emphasis in UVJ in
italics; emphasis added in bold italics]

154 The present situation is exactly that as stated at [172] of Libertarian
Investments: the unauthorised disbursement has already been established by
evidence at the trial, and the plaintiff is in fact seeking substitutive
compensation of the full amount of the unauthorised transfers of
US$1,028,455.00, which I will grant. While I will order the first defendant to
account on a wilful default basis, the plaintiff should bear in mind the
foregoing considerations and carefully elect how he wishes to proceed, if and
after such an account is provided.

155 Finally, the plaintiff also submitted that this Court should make a
disclosure order requiring the first defendant to disclose her assets in aid
of tracing and recovery of the misapplied Funds. 152

I find that this is in order and accordingly order so.

Conclusion

156 In conclusion, I grant the following orders.

(a) I grant a declaration that all the shares in the second defendant are held
on trust by the first defendant for the plaintiff.

(b) Consequent to this, I order the first defendant to, within 14 days hereof,
transfer all the shares in the second defendant to the plaintiff. The
defendants are also to return all bank tokens, cheques, financial statements,
email accounts and all other documents which belong to the second defendant to
the plaintiff.

(c) I order the first defendant to return the amount of US$1,028,455.00 to the
plaintiff, with interest at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the writ to the
date of judgment. I order this sum to be paid to the plaintiff rather than the
second defendant’s bank account because the custodial fiduciary breach did not
arise out of the first defendant’s position as director of the second
defendant, but out of her role as agent to the plaintiff, so the funds should
be compensated to him.

(d) I order the first defendant to provide an account of the second
defendant’s funds to the plaintiff on a wilful default basis.

(e) The first defendant is to disclose her assets to the plaintiff by the
filing of an affidavit within 14 days hereof.

(f) The first defendant is to pay the plaintiff damages to be assessed.

157 I will deal with the issue of costs separately.
