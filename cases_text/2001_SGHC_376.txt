working as a stall assistant at a coffeeshop in Sixth Avenue and the Second
Accused was a part-time mover.

THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

_

2 CPL Fazuri Bin Isnin of the CNB posed as a buyer of cannabis. On 1 May 2001,
at about 8.30 pm, his contact informed him that a male Malay named Daud was
looking for a buyer of cannabis in a large quantity. He instructed the contact
to recommend him as a buyer called Man Boy and to give his handphone number
96288793 to Daud. The contact called back a few minutes later to say that Daud
wanted him to telephone him at 4688965 the following night to discuss the
deal. 4688965 was the number of a public telephone at the coffeeshop in Sixth
Avenue.

3 On 2 May 2001 at about 8 pm, CPL Fazuri called Daud at the said number and
asked for 1 kg of cannabis. Daud said he would return the call after checking
the stuff and the price. About ten minutes later, Daud called to say that if
he would buy 3 kg of cannabis, the price would be cheaper. CPL Fazuri told him
that he needed to discuss the matter with his partner first.

4 About 15 minutes later, CPL Fazuri called Daud to say that he would agree to
buy 3 kg if the price was right. Daud told him the price would be $6,000. CPL
Fazuri counter-offered at $5,000. Daud then handed the telephone to one Abu.
After some negotiations, Abu agreed to sell the 3 kg of cannabis for $5,000
and said that he or Daud would telephone CPL Fazuri the next day to confirm
the place and the time for the deal.

5 The next day (3 May 2001), at about 1 pm, Daud called CPL Fazuri. He said
that Abu and he would meet CPL Fazuri at the 7-Eleven store along Sixth Avenue
in the evening and would bring him to another place to collect the cannabis.
CPL Fazuri told him that two of his men would drive a car to the 7-Eleven
store to meet them. Daud agreed and said he or Abu would call again in the
evening to confirm.

6 At about 7 pm, Abu spoke to CPL Fazuri and told him that he had only 2.5 kg
of cannabis which he offered at $4,400. CPL Fazuri accepted the offer and told
Abu that his men would be driving a car with the registration plate SZA 5202
M. Abu told him the meeting time would be about 7.45 pm.

7 At about 7.10 pm, CPL Fazuri conducted a briefing for 11 CNB officers
regarding the coming operation. SGT Noor Aldi and CPL Mohd Nabil would pose as
Man Boy’s men. CPL Fazuri would call CPL Mohd Nabil’s handphone just before
the meeting with the two sellers and would keep the line on so that he could
monitor the conversation in the car. He would then relay the communication to
another CNB officer who would in turn inform the other CNB officers via
handphone. Once the cannabis was handed over, CPL Mohd Nabil was to say
"Barang bagus" or ("good stuff") as the signal for the rest of the officers in
the three other cars to move in to arrest the two sellers.

8 CPL Mohd Nabil was the front seat passenger in the undercover car driven by
SGT Noor Aldi. At about 7.50 pm, when they were parked near the 7-Eleven
store, two male Malays approached the car and asked them if they were Man’s
men. They then introduced themselves as Daud and Abu. Daud sat in the rear
behind the front seat passenger while Abu sat behind the driver. Daud then
instructed them to proceed to Bukit Merah View.

9 When they arrived at Bukit Merah View, Daud instructed them to stop along
the road in front of Blk 117. Abu then alighted on his own accord and crossed
the road towards Blk 123 and disappeared from view.

10 About five minutes later, Abu reappeared carrying a yellow paper bag. Upon
seeing Abu, they did a U-turn to pick him up on the other side of the road.
Daud moved to the seat behind the driver to make room for Abu. Upon entering
the car, Abu handed over the yellow plastic bag to CPL Mohd Nabil. When he saw
that the bag contained some bundles, CPL Mohd Nabil gave the prearranged
signal by saying "Barang bagus".

11 One of the other three cars with CNB officers, waiting in the vicinity,
then drove alongside the undercover car and intercepted it. When the
undercover car stopped, both Daud and Abu ran out. They were caught a short
distance away and put up a violent struggle but were eventually subdued. The
other two cars then arrived at the scene.

12 All the CNB officers then left with Daud and Abu for the carpark near the
Delta Swimming Complex, a short drive away from Bukit Merah View. The yellow
paper bag and its contents were kept by CPL Mohd Nabil until handed over to
ASP Daniel Tan, the Investigating Officer. Inside the yellow paper bag were
two plastic bags tied together at the top. There were five large bundles and
one small bundle of cannabis inside. CPL Mohd Nabil identified the First
Accused as Daud and the Second Accused as Abu.

13 In cross-examination, CPL Mohd Nabil added that while they were waiting for
Abu at Bukit Merah View, Daud told him that the stuff was still wet, meaning
it was good. He also added that it was Daud who asked them if they were Man’s
men. Abu did not say anything in the car. Daud also asked whether he had the
money for the drugs and CPL Mohd Nabil said, yes. Daud did not ask about how
much his commission would be.

14 SGT Noor Aldi’s narration of the events that night was the same as CPL Mohd
Nabil’s. He gave chase to and, with another CNB officer, caught and subdued
Daud.

15 In cross-examination by the Second Accused’s Counsel, SGT Noor Aldi said he
remembered the name given by the Second Accused was Abu and not Rabu but
accepted that he could have been mistaken.

16 At the Delta Swimming Complex carpark, Insp Senthil Kumaran noted down the
particulars of the two Accused persons and then proceeded to record oral
statements from them separately. As they wished to speak in Malay, SSSGT Abdul
Rahman acted as the interpreter.

17 He began with the First Accused, recording the following questions and
answers on a piece of paper:

> "Q: What is your name?
>
> A: Amran Bin Eusuff. I am also known as ‘Daud’.
>
> Q: Whose bag is this (pointing to the yellow bag)?
>
> A: It belongs to ‘Abu’ (referred to B2) who was arrested together with me.
>
> Q: What is inside the bag?
>
> A: Ganja.
>
> Q: How much is the quantity?
>
> A: 2 kilos.
>
> Q: What is it for?
>
> A: It is for ‘Boy’. Yesterday (2/5/01) I introduced ‘Boy’ to ‘Abu’ over the
> phone.
>
> Q: How much is it?
>
> A: ‘Abu’ told me the price was $4400."

The questions and answers were then read back in Malay by SSSGT Abdul Rahman
to the First Accused who confirmed the correctness thereof by signing on the
piece of paper.

18 Insp Senthil Kumaran then moved on to the Second Accused, recording the
following questions and answers through the interpretation of SSSGT Abdul
Rahman:

> "Q: What is your name?
>
> A: Rabu Bin Rahmat.
>
> Q: Whose bag is this (pointing to the yellow bag)?
>
> A: The bag belongs to ‘Daud’. (Recorder’s note: Rabu pointed to Amran)
>
> Q: What is inside the bag?
>
> A: I do not know. I only took from a male Malay known as ‘Ahmad’ at the void
> deck of Blk 123 Bukit Merah View.
>
> Q: What is it for?
>
> A: I do not know what is it for but Daud instructed me to take it from
> ‘Ahmad’.
>
> Q: Who is Ahmad?
>
> A: I do not know his real name.
>
> Q: Do you know his contact number or place of abode?
>
> A: I only know his pager number 95017785."

Similarly, the questions and answers were read back in Malay by SSSGT Abdul
Rahman to the Second Accused who signed on the piece of paper thereafter.
During each recording, the two Accused persons were kept about 15 to 20 metres
apart.

19 The CNB officers together with both Accused persons then went to the First
Accused’s residence at Turf Club Road but were told by a security guard that
the place in question had already been demolished. They then went to the
Second Accused’s flat in Bukit Batok but found nothing incriminating there.
They next proceeded to Jurong Police Regional Headquarters where both Accused
persons’ urine samples were obtained.

20 At about 2.15 am on 4 May 2001, the CNB officers and the two Accused
persons arrived at the Major Investigation Branch (MIB) of the CNB where Insp
Senthil Kumaran briefed the Investigating Officer, ASP Daniel Tan. The drug
exhibits and the personal belongings of the Accused persons were handed over
to the Investigating Officer.

21 In response to questions from the Second Accused’s Counsel, Insp Senthil
Kumaran said he did not try to ascertain who the "Ahmad" mentioned by the
Second Accused was. He did page him using the number given but there was no
response.

22 SGT Andy Lim testified that the First Accused was running towards the
railing next to the road and attempting to climb over it when he pulled him
down. With the help of SGT Noor Aldi, he managed to hold the First Accused
down and handcuff him.

23 SGT Abu Hanafiah and SGT Galistan Gregory, who had a two feet long baton
with him, were the ones who chased and caught the Second Accused who also put
up a violent struggle. As the Second Accused was pinned to the pavement during
the struggle, he suffered some minor injuries to his body. The CNB officers
denied that they assaulted the Second Accused. SGT Galistan Gregory was using
his baton to pin the Second Accused’s head down and was not hitting him with
it. He had the baton ready in case he had to break the windows of the
undercover car should the Accused persons lock themselves in the car.

24 Dr Lui Chi Pang, an analyst attached to the Centre for Forensic Science
(CFS) analysed the five large blocks and one small block of vegetable matter
found in the yellow paper bag seized by the CNB and certified that they
contained a total of 2174.86 grams of cannabis, the amount specified in the
joint charge.

25 Dr Natarajan Srikanth, also an analyst at the CFS, analysed the urine
sample of the Second Accused and found it to be positive for cannabis
consumption.

26 Dr Ann Young, also an analyst at the CFS, analysed the urine samples of the
First and the Second Accused. No cannabis was detected in the First Accused’s
urine sample but the Second Accused’s urine sample again tested positive for
cannabis.

27 Dr John Chiam of the Alexandra Hospital examined the First Accused at 3.39
am on 4 May 2001 and found recent abrasions on the forehead, the nose, the
right cheek and the right lip. He examined the Second Accused at 3.20 am on 4
May 2001 and found a bruise on the forehead, an abrasion on the left shoulder,
a bruise on the right back and on the right hand. The injuries were also of
recent origin. The Second Accused also had a pre-existing skin condition.
These examinations were pre-statement medical examinations.

28 Dr Tan Sing Huang did the post-statement medical examinations on both
Accused persons at 4.45 am (for the Second Accused) and at 5.20 am (for the
First Accused) on 4 May 2001. She noted essentially the same injuries as Dr
John Chiam did in respect of the First Accused. For the Second Accused, she
noted three red patches measuring 2 cm, 2.5 cm and 3 cm on his back. She said
such patches could appear when there was impact of a blunt injury. However,
the Second Accused did not complain of any assault by the CNB officers at the
time of his arrest. She also noted that the Second Accused had a moderate
fever of 37.8 degrees Centigrade and had complained of a mild sore throat. The
normal body temperature of an adult would be about 37 degrees Centigrade. She
prescribed for the Second Accused paracetamol for two days and lozenges for
three days.

29 Ms Chelvi d/o Thirunavukkaraju, a Customer Service Officer at Singtel,
produced the Call Details Statement in respect of handphone number 96288793
(CPL Fazuri’s handphone) for 1 and 2 May 2001. She had been served with a
subpoena by Counsel for the First Accused, who later decided not to call her
to testify. The Prosecution decided to use her evidence in its case.

THE TRIAL WITHIN A TRIAL

_

30 The admissibility of two statements recorded by the Investigating Officer,
ASP Daniel Tan, on 9 May 2001 and on 15 May 2001 from the Second Accused was
challenged on the ground that they had been made as a result of inducement
emanating from the Investigating Officer. A trial within a trial was therefore
conducted to determine their admissibility.

31 The Investigating Officer testified that at about 2.52 am on 4 May 2001, in
the MIB, he weighed the drug exhibits in the presence of both Accused persons
and then instructed that the two Accused persons be sent for pre-statement
medical examinations.

32 At about 3.37 am, he began the process of taking a statement under Section
122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code from the Second Accused, who indicated
that he wished to speak in Malay. Ms Sofia Bte Sufri, an interpreter at the
CNB, was therefore introduced as the interpreter. At about 4 am, the Second
Accused made a statement.

33 At about 4.14 am, the process was repeated in the case of the First Accused
and a statement under Section 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code was made
at about 4.36 am by the First Accused through the interpretation of Ms Sofia.
All subsequent statements of both persons were recorded with the assistance of
Ms Sofia.

34 On 8 May 2001, between 2.50 pm and 4.10 pm, the Investigating Officer
recorded a long statement from the First Accused. On 9 May 2001, between 11 am
and 12.15 pm, he recorded a long statement from the Second Accused.

35 On 15 May 2001, between 11.25 am and 12.10 pm, the Investigating Officer
recorded a further statement from the First Accused after having the earlier
statement of 8 May 2001 read to the First Accused. Between 4 pm and 4.55 pm
that day, he also recorded a further statement from the Second Accused after
the Malay interpreter had read the statement of 9 May 2001 to the Second
Accused.

36 The Investigating Officer asserted that no threat, inducement or promise
was rendered to either of the Accused persons before or during any of the
recording sessions. He added that the pager number mentioned by the Second
Accused in his oral statement at the time of his arrest was traced to one Mohd
Zainin Bin Taib but the pager was apparently used by another person called
Mohd Dawood Bin Johari whom the CNB was unable to locate.

37 Under cross-examination by Counsel for the Second Accused, the
Investigating Officer said the Second Accused did not ask for food or drinks
during the recording of the statement on 9 May 2001. The Second Accused
appeared alert and was able to answer coherently. He did not look sickly and
did not complain about feeling unwell. If he had done so, the Investigating
Officer would have sent him to see a doctor. It was not the practice to send
accused persons for pre-statement and post-statement medical examinations in
the case of long statements.

38 The Investigating Officer agreed that the Second Accused did complain about
not feeling well on 9 May 2001 but that was at about 1.40 pm, way after the
recording concluded at about 12.15 pm. The Investigating Officer received a
call from the CID lockup informing him that the Second Accused complained that
he was not feeling well. Sometime after 2 pm, he proceeded to the lockup to
see the Second Accused and asked him whether he would like to see a doctor but
he refused. He then asked the Investigating Officer for two Panadols. They
were given to him later. As far as the Investigating Officer could recall, the
Second Accused did not mention having a toothache. He only said he was having
a slight fever. There was no further complaint from the Second Accused after
the two Panadols were given to him. The Investigating Officer did not know
whether the Second Accused had some teeth extracted at the Queenstown Remand
Prison a few weeks after 9 May 2001.

39 The Investigating Officer was unable to comment on the conditions and the
situation in the CID lockup where the Second Accused was remanded.

40 The Investigating Officer disagreed that he had told the Second Accused at
the start of the interview that if the Second Accused cooperated with him, he
would be given a lighter sentence. He was satisfied that the 9 May 2001
statement by the Second Accused was truthful as the sequence of events tallied
with the version of the arresting party and that of the First Accused although
there were some discrepancies where the details were concerned.

41 By the time the 15 May 2001 statement was taken from the Second Accused, he
had been transferred to the Police Cantonment Complex lockup. He was not
allowed any visitors as the investigations were still incomplete. At the
recording of that statement, the Second Accused did not appear depressed or
tired or unwell and did not complain to the Investigating Officer about any
illness. One of his hands was handcuffed to the chair he sat in during the
recording. He did not ask for food or water. He did not ask for cigarettes but
that was after the conclusion of the statement.

42 Asked why the 9 May 2001 statement was read to the Second Accused before
the further statement was taken, the Investigating Officer replied that it was
to refresh his memory as well as to confirm the facts in the earlier
statement. The 15 May 2001 statement was primarily to obtain some statistics
required by the CNB, such as the Second Accused’s family background. He
disagreed with the suggestion that the only reason the 15 May 2001 statement
was recorded was because he wanted another positive statement from the Second
Accused. He also disagreed that he had offered the same inducement alleged,
i.e. that the Second Accused would be let off with a lighter sentence if he
cooperated with the Investigating Officer.

43 The Investigating Officer reiterated that the Second Accused did not give
him any reason why he was not in the right frame of mind to give the
statements. There was no urgency in recording the 9 May 2001 and the 15 May
2001 statements at the stated times.

44 Ms Sofia, the Malay interpreter, testified that there was no threat,
inducement or promise made to the Second Accused by her or by the
Investigating Officer in respect of the two statements. The Second Accused
appeared normal on both days and did not say that he was unwell or was having
a toothache or that he had not slept well the night before. It was the
standard procedure to read to an accused person a previous statement made by
him before recording a further statement. She disagreed that the Second
Accused had requested to see a doctor during the recording of the 9 May 2001
statement. She also disagreed that the Second Accused had asked for a
cigarette during the recording of the 15 May 2001 statement. She could not
recall whether one of his hands was handcuffed to the chair during the
recording as the practice of the Investigating Officers differed in this
matter.

45 The Second Accused testified in this trial within a trial, saying that
after his arrest on 3 May 2001, he was kept in custody in the CID lockup until
15 May 2001\. In the CID lockup, he was placed in a cell with five or six men.
On 15 May 2001, after his further statement had been taken that day, he was
moved to the Police Cantonment Complex.

46 The CID lockup was noisy as there was constant movement into and out of the
cells. His cell was near the door of the lockup. The lights were turned on 24
hours a day. His bed was a cement block. It was thus difficult to sleep well.
Further, his family members were not allowed to visit him. He missed his
family.

47 For the statement recorded on 9 May 2001, the Second Accused was seated to
the right of the interpreter with his left hand handcuffed to one of the arm
rests of the chair he was seated in. They sat facing the Investigating
Officer. No one walked into the room during the recording. The Second Accused
was not feeling well as he did not have enough sleep. In addition, he was
suffering from a toothache. He informed the interpreter and the Investigating
Officer about these matters but was told to give a statement first. They would
see what they could do after that. His request to see a doctor was turned
down.

48 The Second Accused said that he was given an inducement before the
recording of the statement. The Investigating Officer told him that if he
cooperated, his sentence for the offence would be reduced. That had an effect
on him as he thought that he might escape hanging. His statement was not
voluntary as some things he said were not recorded by the Investigating
Officer. He also requested a cigarette after the interview, while waiting to
be brought back to the CID lockup.

49 At the CID lockup, he complained about not feeling well to the officer in
charge there and was subsequently given Panadol by the Investigating Officer.
He also complained about his toothache. His tooth was extracted at the
Queenstown Remand Prison sometime after 15 May 2001.

50 On 15 May 2001, the same three persons were in the room where the recording
of the further statement took place. They were seated in the same way as
before. The Second Accused was feeling tired due to lack of sleep and of food.
His tooth also ached. He was longing to see his family. He said so to the
Investigating Officer and the interpreter but the recording proceeded
nonetheless. He was again told that if he cooperated and told them everything,
his charge would be reduced to a non-capital one. Accordingly, he cooperated
with the Investigating Officer.

51 In cross-examination by the Prosecution, the Second Accused said he could
not remember when the toothache started but it was about four days after his
arrest. His tooth was extracted about three weeks after he was moved to the
Queenstown Remand Prison. The ache was severe but everytime he complained
about it, he was given Panadol which would alleviate the pain for a while.
There was also waiting time before his appointment with the dentist. He agreed
with the Prosecution that the extraction took place on 4 July 2001.

52 On 9 May 2001, he did request Panadol from the Investigating Officer during
the recording of the statement but was not given any then. He agreed that the
Investigating Officer attended to him promptly after his complaint in the CID
lockup.

53 He said he did not tell his Counsel that there were other things said by
him during the recording which were not taken down by the Investigating
Officer. It did not occur to him to tell him so.

THE DECISION OF THE COURT IN THE TRIAL WITHIN A TRIAL

_

55 Where voluntariness of a statement is challenged, the burden is on the
Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was made
voluntarily and not on the defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that
it was not made voluntarily. However, the Prosecution does not need to remove
every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear (see the Court of
Appeal’s decision in _Gulam bin Notan & Anor v PP_ [1999] 2 SLR 181).

56 I had no doubt that the Investigating Officer and the interpreter were
telling the truth about the recording of the statements from the Second
Accused on 9 May 2001 and on 15 May 2001. The interpreter had no interest in
ensuring that any statement was recorded. She said what she could remember and
was candid about the fact that she could not recall whether the Second Accused
was handcuffed or not during the two recording sessions. There was no
particular reason why the Investigating Officer should insist on recording a
statement on those two days if the Second Accused was unwell then. Indeed, it
would be foolhardy for the Investigating Officer to do so on 15 May 2001
knowing that the Second Accused had already informed someone at the CID lockup
that he was unwell after the recording session on 9 May 2001. If the Second
Accused was unwell in any way before the recording on those two days, it was
strange that he did not tell the officers at the CID lockup before he was
brought to meet the Investigating Officer.

58 There was nothing sinister in reading a previous statement or statements to
an accused person. I would have thought that was fair play on the part of the
Investigating Officer. If the Investigating Officer wanted to induce "another
positive statement", why bother to even read a previous statement to the
Second Accused? He could just as well have told the Second Accused, "This is
what I want to hear from you and if you will sign such a statement, your
charge will be reduced", thereby saving himself and the interpreter a lot of
time and effort.

59 I rejected the Second Accused’s evidence about the recording of the
statements on those two days. The issues of alleged lack of food and omission
by the Investigating Officer of matters mentioned by him were not even
canvassed in the cross-examination of the Investigating Officer and the
interpreter. What the Second Accused experienced in the CID lockup might not
be the same conditions of home but I was satisfied that he had not been
deprived of food or of sleep, at least not to the extent that he was in no
mental state to comprehend what was going on during the recording of the
statements. Medical attention would have been accorded to him should he have
requested to see a doctor at any time. I accepted the evidence of the
Investigating Officer and the interpreter that the Second Accused did not
appear at all ill at the recording sessions and said nothing about feeling
unwell or being unable to carry on with the statements at any time. His tooth
problems featured only after the recording of the two statements in issue. The
deprivation of family visits was necessary in the circumstances. I was also
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that no inducement or promise of any sort
was extended to the Second Accused in respect of the two statements.

60 Accordingly, I ruled that the two statements were voluntary ones and
admitted them in evidence.

_

  
THE TRIAL PROPER CONTINUES

_

61 The First Accused did not challenge the admissibility of the statements
made by him. His statement made pursuant to Section 122(6) of the Criminal
Procedure Code was as follows:

> "I do not admit. The ganja does not belong to me. It was Rabu who collected
> the ganja while I was in the car. Rabu came into the car with a plastic bag
> and handed it to me. I then handed over the plastic bag to the person
> sitting beside the driver of the car."

62 The First Accused’s statement of 8 May 2001 was as follows:

> "I am known as "Daud" to family and my friends.
>
> 2 On 2nd May 2001 at about 2.45 pm, while I was at my sister’s food stall at
> the coffeeshop in Six Avenue, my friend Bob was talking on the public phone
> (4688965) with Boy. I overheard Bob telling Boy "Cakap sama gua punya
> brother." I knew that Bob was referring to me as he addressed me as Abang
> Daud. I knew Bob when we reported for our urine test at Tanglin Police
> Station. Bob then passed the telephone to me. Boy asked for my name. I told
> him to address me as Abang Daud. I asked Boy what was the matter. Boy told
> me that he wanted a large amount of ganja. He wanted me to look for the
> ganja for him. I told Boy to give me his handphone number. He gave me his
> handphone number as 96288793. I then told Boy that I would contact him at
> about 6.30 to 6.45 pm. I then hang up the phone at about 3.15 pm. At about
> 6.30 pm, I contacted Boy on his handphone. I told him I can get the ganja
> for him. I told him that I would confirm the deal the next day at about the
> same time.
>
> 3 On the next day (3rd May 2001), I contacted Boy at about 6.45 pm on his
> handphone at the coffeeshop. Rabu was also at the coffeeshop with me. I told
> Boy that I would talk to the seller about someone wanting to buy ganja from
> him. I told Boy to call me about 7 to 7.15 pm. I then hang up the phone. I
> then approached Rabu’s table to talk to him. I told him that someone wanted

63 On 15 May 2001, the First Accused added the following:

> "6 The previous statement recorded on 8.5.2001 was read back to me in Malay.
>
> 7 I wished to add that Rabu was the man who was arrested with me. I had only
> came to know him at the coffeeshop for about 2 months. Rabu always hang
> around the coffeeshop with his friends. They always talk about horses and
> Rabu always come down after his working hours at about 5 pm. Rabu would come
> to the coffeeshop about twice a week. I am not close to Rabu. We were just
> casual friends. I did not know that Rabu is selling drugs. I just happened
> to ask him if he had drugs for sale because he was sitting alone. By
> coincidence, Rabu had the drugs for sale.
>
> 8 Boy had promised that he would give me a commission if I can help him get
> the ganja. Boy did not tell me how much commission he was going to give me.
> He only told me that he wanted 5 kilograms of ganja.
>
> 9 In paragraph 2 of my previous statement, I promised Boy to get the ganja
> for him because I wanted the commission badly.
>
> 10 I have 11 or 12 siblings, but only 6 live in Singapore. All of them had
> their own families and I only contact one of my cousins. The rest of my
> family had lost contact with me when I went to prison in August 1997."

64 The Second Accused said the following in his Section 122(6) of the Criminal
Procedure Code statement on 4 May 2001:

> "Amran asked me to follow him to Bukit Merah. At Bukit Merah View, he told
> me to go to a void deck of a block of flat number 123 to meet someone and
> collect a plastic bag from this person. I did as I was told. After that, I
> brought the plastic bag into the car. When the car was intercepted, I
> realised that the driver was actually a CNB officer and that the plastic bag
> contained ganja."

65 The Second Accused’s statement of 9 May 2001 stated:

> "I am known as "Rabu" to family and my friends.
>
> 2 On 3rd May 2001 at about 5 pm, I went to the Joo Heng coffeeshop at Six
> Avenue to chat with my friends about horse racing. I was chatting with a few
> of my friends and drinking coffee. Daud, who worked at a stall in the coffee
> shop, came and approach me at 7 plus pm. Daud said that he had made a deal
> with someone and there is a car coming to pick him up at between 7.45 to
> 7.50 pm in front of the 7-11 store. Daud asked me to come along. I do not
> know the reason why he asked me to come along. I thought Daud was referring
> to something about horse racing, so I followed him. At about 7.40 pm, I left
> the coffeeshop with Daud. We waited in front of the 7-11 store. At about
> 7.50 pm, a grey car arrived. Daud told me to enter the car. There were 2
> male Malay in the car. They also asked Daud and me to enter the car. I sat
> behind the passenger seat of the car while Daud sat behind the driver. The
> car moved off. Daud told the driver to drive to Bukit Merah View. The

>
> 3 We stopped along the road near Blk 123 Bukit Merah View at sometime passed
> 8 pm. We waited in the car for about 10 minutes. During the 10 minutes, the

> Bukit Merah View, to me and asked me to collect the "Barang" from him. I
> understand "Barang" to be ganja, but I did not know how much ganja I am

> went up to the man and he led me to the staircase landing between the second

> were walking up the stairs, I asked the man what did he promise Daud. He
> said to follow him up and nothing else. At the staircase landing, the man
> picked up a yellow plastic bag from behind some rubbish and handed over to
> me. The man asked for his money. I told him that Daud was in the car and
> asked him to follow me to the car. He refused. I then told the man that Daud
> would pass the money to him personally. The man said that he would wait at
> the void deck. I then walked back to the car, opened the door of the car and
> passed the yellow plastic bag to Daud. Daud took the bag from me. The

> statement, I was again sent back to the hospital for another check up and
> then I was sent to CID lock up."

66 His statement of 15 May 2001 continued as follows:

> "5 The previous statement recorded on 9.5.2001 was read back to me in Malay.
>
> 6 Daud was the man who was arrested together with me. I got to know Daud at
> the coffeeshop that I always go to. I always go to the coffeeshop 2 or 3
> times a week to look for horse racing tips among the people there. There are
> a lot of stable boys at the coffeeshop. On the day of arrest, Daud asked me
> if I can get any ganja for him. I told Daud that I can try to get for him.
> At about 7.15 pm, Daud asked me to talk to a male person, Boy, on the phone.
> Boy spoke to me in Malay and asked me if I can get the ganja for him. I said
> I would try to get for him. Boy asked me to try and get 3 kilograms of ganja
> for him at a price of S$5000. I contacted Daud, someone whom I had met on my
> Batam trips, and asked him if he had 3 kilograms of ganja for sale at the
> price of S$5000. He told me that he would check and called me later. Daud
> called and informed me that he only had 2 and a half kilograms of ganja and
> he wanted $4400 for it. I then told Daud and he in turn informed Boy about
> it. Boy agreed and we proceed as arranged. Boy told Daud that he would give
> a commission to him. Daud told me about the commission and promised to share
> with me. I do not know how much is the commission. I was also promised
> commission for introducing the business to the other Daud.
>
> 7 I am now telling the truth as I am having nightmares in the lock up.
>
> 8 I am married with 2 daughters. My wife, Sarai Bte Ali Mohd, is working as
> a production clerk. My elder daughter working as in a 7-11 store. My younger
> daughter is still studying. My parents are both no longer around. I had 7
> siblings. All my siblings are married and staying with their own families. I
> still kept in regular contact with my siblings."

67 Cross-examined by Counsel for the Second Accused, the Investigating Officer
said the Second Accused’s statements were narrative in nature with some
questions asked by the Investigating Officer. He was not conversant in Malay
and recorded whatever the interpreter said to him. He did not omit or add
anything or refuse any amendments requested by the Second Accused.

_

  
THE FIRST ACCUSED’S DEFENCE

_

68 The First Accused used to live in the Bukit Turf Club quarters. At the time
of his arrest, he had no home. He would sleep at void decks or in a lorry.

69 His testimony was essentially the same as his statements of 8 May 2001 and
of 15 May 2001. He added that Boy had promised him a commission for the drug
deal. In the CNB undercover car at Bukit Merah View, while they were waiting
for the Second Accused who had alighted, the First Accused asked the front
seat passenger whether Boy had passed the commission to him. He said he had
and pointed to something in an envelope. He said he did not know how much
money Boy had put in it.

70 When the Second Accused returned, he handed the plastic bag to the First
Accused who in turn handed it to the front seat passenger in the CNB
undercover car. It was only when that person opened the package that the First
Accused knew it contained ganja because of the smell. That person then tied
the plastic bag and said to the Second Accused that the envelope he was
holding contained the $4,400 for the ganja. He also told the First Accused
that his commission was in another envelope. He then asked the First Accused
where he would be going to from Bukit Merah View. The First Accused told him
to return to Sixth Avenue. The envelopes were not handed over.

71 At the Delta Swimming Complex carpark after the arrest had been made, he
told the two CNB undercover officers that they had set him up. After the oral
statement had been taken and before he was brought to the Jurong Police
Station, a CNB officer offered him a piece of tissue paper to wipe the blood
from his face but the First Accused declined it.

72 He said he told the Investigating Officer the truth on 8 May 2001 when his
long statement was recorded. On 15 May 2001, he had nothing to add and so told
the Investigating Officer that his statement was the same as the one made on 8
May 2001. He asked the Investigating Officer whether he could smoke and was
told he could not because the place was air-conditioned.

73 In cross-examination by Counsel for the Second Accused, the First Accused
said he knew the Second Accused for about two months. He saw the Second
Accused at the said coffeeshop where he met the stable boys living at the turf
club’s quarters. He and the Second Accused were casual friends only.

74 The Second Accused did not know Bob. The First Accused met the Second
Accused at the coffeeshop on 2 May 2001 at about 8 pm or later. It was not a
prearranged meeting. There was no one else called Abu. People at the
coffeeshop called the Second Accused Abu.

75 When the First Accused called Boy on 3 May 2001 at about 6.45 pm from the
public telephone at the coffeeshop, the Second Accused was not there. He told
Boy he had the ganja he wanted and to call back between 7 pm to 7.15 pm as he
was then busy collecting and washing the dishes at the coffeeshop.

76 Boy did not call. The First Accused called Boy again at about 7.20 pm and
asked him whether he would be coming to fetch him. Boy asked whether he had
got 5 kg of ganja. The First Accused then told the Second Accused, who had
arrived at the coffeeshop, that Boy wanted 5 kg of ganja. The Second Accused
said he could not get 5 kg. The First Accused relayed the message to Boy and
then suggested that Boy talk to the Second Accused direct. The Second Accused
then spoke to Boy over the telephone.

77 The First Accused maintained that it was the Second Accused who directed
the CNB undercover officers to Bukit Merah View and told them where to stop.
He agreed that when they first met the undercover officers near the 7-Eleven
store, the Second Accused did not speak to them at all. In the car, the Second
Accused told the front seat passenger his name was Abu. While in the car, the
First and the Second Accuseds did not speak to each other..

78 The First Accused then added that Boy had earlier promised him both a
commission and a handphone.

79 In cross-examination by the Prosecution, the First Accused said that when
he approached the Second Accused on 2 May 2001 to tell him that someone wanted
ganja, the Second Accused warned him to be careful about that person. The
Second Accused did not ask the First Accused how much ganja that person
wanted. He only asked that question on 3 May 2001. The First Accused said he
did not speak to Boy on 2 May 2001 at about 8 pm to say that he was able to
obtain the ganja. He did so only on 3 May 2001. On 2 May 2001, he did not
offer Boy 3 kg of ganja for $6,000 and neither was there any bargaining by Boy
to reduce the price to $5,000. He disagreed that he then handed the telephone
to the Second Accused because he could not agree on the price with Boy. By the
time the Second Accused concluded the conversation with Boy over the
telephone, the First Accused had gone to Bukit Batok where he slept at the
void deck. The meeting on 3 May 2001 with Boy’s men was arranged with Boy
specifying the time and the First Accused stipulating the venue. The First
Accused had already confirmed the plan with the Second Accused which was that
they would lead the buyer to another place for the drugs to be delivered.
Before they got into the undercover car, the First Accused asked the Second
Accused how much drugs they had and the Second Accused told him that he had
2.5 kg and the price was $4,400. The First Accused then said that on 2 May
3001, the Second Accused told him that he had got the ganja but asked him
whether it was a genuine customer or not.

80 The First Accused agreed that when the Second Accused got out of the
undercover car at Bukit Merah View, he knew that the Second Accused was going
to collect the ganja. He knew that the plastic bag contained the drugs even
before the CNB officer opened it. He disagreed that while they were waiting
for the Second Accused in the car, he had told the CNB officers that the stuff
was wet and therefore good. When they were intercepted, he knew immediately
that CNB officers were in the other car. He added later that he knew they were
CNB officers when they went after the Second Accused.

81 When asked by the Court later about his 8 May 2001 statement, the First
Accused agreed that he had forgotten he spoke to Boy twice on 2 May 2001. He
added that the stall holder whom he worked for was not his blood sister but
someone whom he regarded as a sister. He was educated up to Primary 6 in a
Malay school here. He worked as a stable boy before. He said he admitted "the
wrongdoing" and "the mistake" he had made but maintained that he was not
involved in drug trafficking or consumption of cannabis.

THE SECOND ACCUSED’S DEFENCE

_

82 The Second Accused lived in Bukit Batok and worked as a part time mover. He
is married with two daughters.

83 He testified that he had never used the name Abu. He went to Batam alone
for the May Day holidays on 30 April 2001 and returned to Singapore on 2 May
2001, arriving at the World Trade Centre at about 8 pm. He had a mistress in
Batam. He then went to the hawker centre at the World Trade Centre to have his
dinner until around 8.35 pm or 8.40 pm. He then walked to the bus interchange
and took a bus home. He did not speak to Boy at all on 2 May 2001.

84 The next day, 3 May 2001, he was at the coffeeshop in Sixth Avenue at
sometime past 5 pm. He would go there two or three times a week to get tips
about horses from the stable boys who gathered there. He received a call
asking for the First Accused and he told the caller to call later as the First
Accused was not there. The First Accused arrived at the coffeeshop at about
7.15 pm and did not speak to the Second Accused until after the First Accused
had answered a telephone call.

85 The First Accused told him that his friend would be coming in a car and
asked him whether he wanted to go along to Bukit Merah View. He did not
mention the purpose of going there. The Second Accused went along as he
thought the First Accused wanted to talk to him about horses. They had talked
about horses before. The First Accused told him the registration number of his
friend’s car. The Second Accused did not ask the First Accused anything else.

86 When the car arrived at the 7-Eleven store, the First Accused went up to
it, introduced himself as Daud and asked the front seat passenger whether he
was Boy’s friend. The Second Accused then told him that he was known as Rabu.
The front seat passenger told them to get into the car and they did, with the
First Accused seated behind the driver and the Second Accused behind the front
seat passenger. The First Accused then gave the directions to Bukit Merah
View. The Second Accused did not speak to the two CNB undercover officers
during the journey there. The First Accused asked them about the handphone
that Boy promised him and the front seat passenger told him to speak to Boy
about it personally. There was no talk about drugs.

87 At Bukit Merah View, The First Accused told the officers to stop and asked
the First Accused to do him a favour by going to the void deck of Blk 123 to
collect a plastic bag. When the Second Accused told him to go and get it
himself, the First Accused said he needed to talk to the front seat passenger.
The Second Accused asked the First Accused and the front seat passenger to go
with him and collect the plastic bag but they did not. Instead, the front seat
passenger told the Second Accused to help the First Accused by collecting the
plastic bag. So the Second Accused went alone to the void deck since the First
Accused was a "normal friend" whom he had known for two or three months. The
Second Accused did not know what was inside the plastic bag. If he had known
it contained drugs, he would not have agreed to take it. He was not offered
any reward for collecting the plastic bag.

88 At the void deck, he met a man whom he had not met before and asked him
what he had promised to Daud. That man said it was not necessary for him to
know and asked him to follow him to the landing between the second and the
third floors. There, he took a paper bag which contained a plastic bag from a
heap of rubbish and handed it to the Second Accused. The plastic bag was tied
up and the Second Accused could not see what was inside.

89 The man then asked him about money. The Second Accused told him he did not
know anything about that as it was not his business. The man then told him to
send the paper bag to the First Accused and then ask the First Accused to meet
him at the void deck.

90 Back at the car, he handed the paper bag to the First Accused. The front
seat passenger told him to get into the car and he did. The car then moved
off. The First Accused handed the paper bag to the front seat passenger who
immediately opened the plastic bag inside. When he did so, the Second Accused
smelled ganja and then realized what the contents were. He also heard the
words "barang bagus" which meant ganja to him. He did not see any envelopes
held up by the CNB undercover officers.

91 When the other car intercepted the undercover car, the Second Accused saw a
man carrying a baton coming out and, suspecting he was from the CNB,
immediately opened the car door and fled. He did so because it was a drug
offence and also because he had smoked ganja while in Batam and his urine
could still have traces of the drug. The CNB officers might not believe his
innocence in the matter if he was arrested.

92 He was pushed from behind and fell onto the road. He saw the baton coming
at him and used his right hand to ward off the baton. It hit his right hand
and because of the pain, he curled up his body and put both hands behind his
head. His hand became swollen subsequently. He was also hit on his shoulder
and at the back of his head.

93 At the Delta Swimming Complex carpark, he told Insp Senthil Kumaran that he
did not know what was inside the paper bag.

94 Later, at the Alexandra Hospital, he told both doctors there that he was
assaulted during the struggle with the CNB officers. He requested an X-ray for
his right hand at the post-statement medical examination.

95 In the 9 May 2001 statement, the Second Accused did not say anything about
"ganja" or "barang". They were inserted by the Investigating Officer. He also
told the Investigating Officer that he had been assaulted but that was not
recorded.

96 In the 15 May 2001 statement, the words in paragraph 6 from "On the day of
arrest, …" until the end of that paragraph were not his. The Investigating
Officer wrote them himself and then had the statement read to him by the Malay
interpreter. The Second Accused objected but the Investigating Officer forced
him to sign the statement.

97 In cross-examination by Counsel for the First Accused, the Second Accused
maintained he knew nothing about the events at the coffeeshop on 2 May 2001 as
he did not go there.

98 He had gone to the Kranji Turf Club with the First Accused before. Put to
him that there was only one such occasion, the Second Accused said there were
more than one. They had also been to night clubs together and to other places
which he could not remember. He agreed that the First Accused did not tell him
what sort of friend was going to pick him up on 3 May 2001 or that the friend
wanted to discuss horses.

99 He added that the First Accused pointed out the man in the void deck while
they were in the undercover car at Bukit Merah View and told him his name was
Ahmad.

100 In cross-examination by the Prosecution, the Second Accused surmised that
the First Accused could have said that he was known as Abu because he wanted
to push the blame to him. He maintained that he had not spoken over the
telephone to Boy.

101 The Second Accused said he knew he arrived at the World Trade Centre from
Batam at about 8 pm because he had boarded the ferry at Batam at 7 pm and the
journey took about 45 minutes. He agreed that he could also have arrived at
about 7.30 pm. The Prosecution then tendered a letter dated 30 October 2001
from the Singapore Immigration and Registration addressed to the CNB
indicating that the Second Accused had left Singapore on 30 April 2001 by sea
and had re-entered by sea at 7.32 pm on 2 May 2001. The Second Accused did not
dispute the facts stated in that letter but said he would have needed to take
two buses from the World Trade Centre to Sixth Avenue and the journey would
take almost an hour altogether.

102 He added that the First Accused had taken him out previously to talk about
horses although he could not recall when. He did not mention this when cross-
examined by Counsel for the First Accused as it did not cross his mind then.
Sometimes, certain people would not like to talk in the open but preferred to
talk in secret in a car.

103 When the Prosecution pointed out the fact that the level of the road at
Bukit Merah View was much higher than the void deck of Blk 123 and therefore
the First Accused could not have pointed out Ahmad at the said void deck to
the Second Accused while the car was stopped there, the Second Accused replied
that the First Accused did so before the car arrived at the spot where it
stopped. Asked how he managed to know Ahmad’s pager number (which he mentioned
in his oral statement to Insp Senthil Kumaran), the Second Accused said that
the First Accused had told him that if Ahmad did not believe that he was sent
by him, he was to tell Ahmad that pager number.

104 The Second Accused was suspicious when he saw Ahmad retrieving the paper
bag from the rubbish heap and that was why he asked Ahmad what was he trying
to do to which Ahmad replied that there was no need for him to know, just give
the paper bag to the First Accused. The Second Accused was in a hurry and
wanted to take the paper bag and leave. He had been told by the CNB undercover
officers to hurry as the car was stopped at the roadside. He added that he did
tell the First Accused when he returned to the car that Ahmad was waiting for
him at the void deck. He forgot to mention this fact in his testimony earlier.

105 He signed the 15 May 2001 statement although it was made up by the
Investigating Officer as he was told it was only a charge and he could explain
further in Court. Being a person under arrest, he had no choice. The
Investigating Officer also told him that if he signed, he could reduce the
charge to a non-capital one. Although he had maintained he was not involved in
drug trafficking, he thought the Investigating Officer wanted to charge him
for drug consumption.

_

  
THE DECISION OF THE COURT

_

106 The First Accused’s version of the events coincided materially with the
Prosecution’s evidence save for his assertions that he was seated behind the
driver in the CNB undercover car and that it was the Second Accused who
directed the undercover officers to Bukit Merah View in the evening of 3 May
2001. In the circumstances of this case, those discrepancies were not material
to the charge. In any event, I accepted the Prosecution’s evidence that the
First Accused did give the directions. His only defence appeared to be that
the cannabis did not belong to him and that it was the Second Accused who knew
the source of the drugs. However, ownership of the cannabis was not a
necessary ingredient in a trafficking charge.

107 It was clear the First Accused knew he was involved in a drugs deal and
that, upon the drugs being delivered successfully to the intended buyer, he
would get a commission in cash or in kind or both. There was no question of
lack of knowledge of what was in the yellow paper bag that the Second Accused
brought back to the undercover car at Bukit Merah View. It was immaterial to
the First Accused whether the said bag was first passed by the Second Accused
to him and then from him to CPL Nabil or it was given directly by the Second
Accused to CPL Nabil. Either way, the First Accused clearly knew the nature of
the transaction and participated in it fully. He was in fact the first link in
the chain between the buyer and the seller of drugs. Even if he had been lured
into the illegal deal by an agent provocateur, the evidence showed that he
played an active role willingly and for good reason. In his own words (in
paragraph 9 of the 15 May 2001 statement), he "wanted the commission badly".

108 The Prosecution’s case against the First Accused was therefore proved
beyond reasonable doubt.

109 I accepted the First Accused’s evidence relating to the involvement of the
Second Accused in the drugs transaction. Even though the First Accused was an
accomplice, his testimony did not seek to push the blame away from himself.
There was also no reason whatsoever for him to implicate the Second Accused if
the latter was not involved in the deal. Clearly, the Second Accused was the
"Abu" in question.

110 As indicated in the trial within a trial, I rejected the Second Accused’s
assertions that his long statements had been given involuntarily. In the trial
proper, the Second Accused sought to exclude the incriminating portions of the
statements by alleging that the Investigating Officer had inserted them into
the statements despite his protests. I had no doubt that these allegations
were spurious. He had not even alluded to this alleged egregious conduct of
the Investigating Officer in the trial within a trial. There, he had only said
that the Investigating Officer refused to include certain things which he had
mentioned and not that the Investigating Officer was forcing words into his
mouth. I had no doubt that the Investigating Officer did no subtraction and/or
addition where the Second Accused’s statements were concerned.

111 The Second Accused sought to dissociate himself from the negotiations of 2
May 2001 by saying that he was not at the coffeeshop that evening and could
not have been there between 8 to 9 pm in any event as he had arrived from
Batam at about 8 pm and was having his dinner near the World Trade Centre
until about 8.40 pm. He had no choice but to agree with the Singapore
Immigration and Registration document that he had disembarked at World Trade
Centre terminal at 7.32 pm on 2 May 2001. That would give him ample time to
travel by taxi to Sixth Avenue and to arrive there at about 8 pm. In any
event, I accepted the First Accused’s evidence that the Second Accused was at
the coffeeshop that evening and that he did talk to Boy over the telephone
there.

112 It was incredible that the Second Accused, a fully grown up man, would
agree to go along with the First Accused to Bukit Merah View with people he
had never met before without even first enquiring about the purpose or the
length of time they intended to stay there. It was even more absurd that he
would then sit silently in the car without knowing what was going on. Why was
there no talk about horses? Obviously, his conduct was much more consistent
with someone who knew the purpose of that trip. He was silent because he
needed no answers from anyone about what the outing was all about.

113 Both the undercover officers and the First Accused said that the Second
Accused had alighted at Bukit Merah View without being told to do so by the
First Accused. Clearly, the Second Accused knew where he was going to, whom he
was going to meet and what he was going to pick up. The Second Accused’s
conduct in bolting from the undercover car immediately upon interception by
the other car also showed quite clearly he knew he was handling drugs. I was
satisfied that the injuries he suffered were the result of his violent
struggle in resisting arrest and not the consequence of assault by the CNB
officers who were doing nothing more than to subdue him and secure his arrest.
In any event, the Second Accused was not relying on the alleged assault as a
factor influencing the admissibility of his statements.

114 The totality of the evidence put it beyond reasonable doubt that the
Second Accused was deeply involved in the cannabis deal and had played a key
role in it after the initial introduction by the First Accused.

115 The First Accused’s statements and oral testimony clearly amounted to
confessions of his guilt. Pursuant to Section 30 of the Evidence Act, as
expounded by _Chin Seow Noi & Ors v PP_ [1994] 1 SLR 135, they could be used
as the basis for convicting the Second Accused. However, there was ample
evidence in any event to support his conviction apart from the First Accused’s
confessions.

116 I therefore found both Accused persons guilty as charged and convicted
them accordingly. As the amount of cannabis involved exceeded 500 grammes, I
passed the mandatory death sentence on both of them.
