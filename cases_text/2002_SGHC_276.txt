quantity of high speed diesel. Judgment was thus entered in JY’s favour. The
only remaining issues left to be resolved were JY’s claim for losses suffered
under their sub-contracts with third parties in the DPRK and SST’s claim in
relation to a set-off. JY opted to claim only the loss under their sub-
contract with Sasan Farm ("Sasan").

**

Held, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claim for consequential losses and dismissing
the first defendants’ claim for set-off:

> **

JY’s claim for consequential losses in relation to their contract with Sasan
did not rest on solid ground. It was not established that JY made known the
special circumstances of their contract with Sasan to SST. It was not
established that SST were aware of JY’s sub-contract with Sasan or of the
terms of that sub-contract. If all the cases on remoteness of damages were
taken into account, there could be no doubt that JY’s loss under their sub-
contract with Sasan was too remote a consequence of SST’s breach of contract
(See [11] – [19]).

In any case, what actually transpired in the investigations in relation to
Sasan’s claim against JY was not known. The DPRK Central Public Prosecutor’s
Authority furnished no grounds for requiring JY to compensate Sasan. Although
a representative from Sasan filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and was
listed as a witness, JY chose to close their case without calling him as a
witness. As such, SST’s counsel was denied the opportunity to question him.
After having taken into account all the circumstances of the case and the
evidence of the witnesses, the court had no hesitation whatsoever in
dismissing JY’s claim for consequential losses (See [19]).

SST was in fact alleging that JY was guilty of fraud and that the DPRK Central
Prosecutors’ Authority was colluding with JY to defraud them. Apart from the
fact that fraud was not pleaded by SST, the officer in the Central Public
Prosecutors’ Authority who took charge of the investigation regarding Danny ‘s
breach of the DPRK’s laws testified that the "apology money" had been paid
into JY’s account because the company had the requisite foreign exchange
account and had prior dealings with SST. He also confirmed that JY had
transferred the sum in question to the relevant government authority. In
_Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A M Luther v James Sagor & Co_ [1921] All ER 138,
146, Warrington LJ said: "It is well settled that the validity of the acts of
an independent sovereign government in relation to property and persons within
its jurisdiction cannot be questioned in the courts of this country." It was
for SST to prove their assertion that they were entitled to a set-off with
respect to the "apology money." As they failed to do so, the said sum could
not be deducted from the damages payable to JY for their breach of contract
(See [24]-[25]).

SST accepted that JY were entitled to damages for breach of contract if they
had no right to set-off the "apology money." JY were entitled to costs as far
as this claim was concerned (See [26]).

Different considerations arose with respect to the costs in relation to JY’s
claim for consequential losses and SST’s alleged set-off. After taking all the
circumstances into account, the court ordered that with respect to JY’s claim
for consequential losses under their sub-contracts and SST’s claim regarding a
set-off, the parties would bear their own costs (See [27]).

**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The plaintiffs, Korea Jonmyong Trading Co ("JY), a Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea ("DPRK") company, claimed damages from the first defendants,
Sea-Shore Transportation Pte Ltd ("SST"), and the second defendant, Mr
Sharafdeen s/o Abdul Rasak ("Deen"), a director of SST, with respect to breach
of a contract for the supply of around 3,000 metric tonnes of Indonesian high
speed diesel. JY also alleged that the defendants were guilty of fraud.  __

Background

__

2\. On 15 February 2001, JY agreed to purchase "3,000 metric tonnes +/- 5%" of
high speed diesel of Indonesian origin from SST at USD215 per metric tonne.
The contract provided for the cargo to be shipped to JY in February 2001 and
Nampo was nominated as the port of discharge.

3\. SST entrusted the task of procuring the Indonesian high speed diesel to
one Mr Danny Moorthy ("Danny"), who did not succeed in obtaining the required
quantity of cargo. Only 400 metric tonnes of high speed diesel were loaded at
Surabaya while slightly more than 900 metric tonnes of the said oil were
loaded at Pulau Kambing. The vessel that carried the cargo to DPRK, namely _MT
Princess Sarah,_ had her share of problems. Time was lost as she had to be
repaired before she sailed from Indonesia. She then deviated to the
Philippines and she finally reached Nampo, the port of discharge, on 17th June
2001.

4\. JY did not expect their cargo to arrive as late as 17th June 2001. They
also did not know that _MT Princess Sarah_ did not have the agreed quantity of
high speed diesel on board because SST had furnished them with bills of lading
which showed that more than 3,000 metric tonnes of the cargo had been shipped.
Apart from being shocked at the shortfall of cargo, they alleged that the
limited quantity of high speed diesel oil that was delivered to them at Nampo
was not of the same quality as that specified in their contract with SST.

5\. SST asserted that the problem of a shortfall in the cargo delivered at
Nampo could have been minimised had Danny, who was on board the _MT Princess
Sarah,_ been allowed to return to Indonesia to load more high speed diesel.
However, Danny could not leave the DPRK as he was accused by the North Koreans
of having committed a number of offences. Among other things, he was accused
of having firearms and satellite phones in his possession without declaring
them to the authorities.

6\. According to JY, Danny, who faced a long term of imprisonment if he was
convicted of the offences in question, offered the DPRK Central Public
Prosecutors’ Authority the sum of USD230,000 as "apology money" if he was
allowed to leave DPRK. SST’s Deen was made aware of Danny’s problems with the
DPRK authorities by Kosa, their agent in Nampo, and by Mr Kwon Chang Hyok
("Kwon"), JY’s manager. Danny also spoke to Deen about his predicament. In due
course, Deen arranged for a total of USD230,000 to be transferred to JY in
late 2001 and early 2002 to secure Danny’s release. JY asserted that after
they received the USD230,000, they transferred the "apology money" to the
relevant government authority.

7\. Subsequently, JY claimed from SST damages in relation to, inter alia,
their loss of profits and sums which they paid to third parties, to whom they
sold the high speed diesel that SST failed to deliver. They asserted that the
total loss to date amounted to USD1,515,494.50. When SST failed to pay the
amount claimed, JY commenced the present action. SST denied liability to JY
and added that if they are liable in damages to JY, the USD230,000 paid by
them to secure Danny’s release must be taken into account as it was in fact a
partial refund of the money which JY paid to them for the high speed diesel
oil ordered in February 2001.

__

Claim against second defendant withdrawn

__

8\. During the trial, JY withdrew their claim against Deen on terms which were
recorded in a consent order dated 10 October 2002. As such, this judgment will
only concern JY’s action against SST.

__

SST admits breaching the contract

__****

9\. SST admitted at the trial that they breached their contract with JY by
failing to deliver the agreed quantity of high speed diesel. It was then
agreed that if the claim for consequential losses under JY’s sub-contracts
with third parties and SST’s alleged set-off of USD230,000 are not taken into
account, SST would pay JY USD600,200 as damages for breach of contract.
Judgment was thus entered in JY’s favour for this amount. Interest at the rate
of 6% per annum is payable with respect to this judgment sum as from the date
of the writ.

10\. As a result of the narrowing of differences between JY and SST, the only
remaining issues left to be resolved were JY’s claim for losses suffered under
their sub-contracts with third parties in the DPRK and SST’s claim in relation
to a set-off. These will be considered below.

__

JY’s claim for losses under their sub-contracts with third parties

__

11\. Although JY initially asserted that they suffered losses under a number
of sub-contracts with third parties in the DPRK, they opted to claim only the
loss under their sub-contract with Sasan Farm ("Sasan"), a large rice farm in
the Pyongyang area. JY’s case is that they breached a contract to deliver
1,000 metric tonnes of high speed diesel to Sasan because of SST’s failure to
deliver the agreed amount of high speed diesel to them. Sasan complained to
the DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority, claiming that JY owed them
USD1,290,800 for the cost of additional manpower and USD1,507,840 for a
shortfall in rice production. The Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority
ordered JY to pay USD620,000 to Sasan. JY sought to recover this sum as well
as legal expenses incurred in relation to Sasan’s claim from SST.

12\. SST asserted that this claim by JY is invalid because of the rule on
remoteness of damage, which was summed up by Alderson B in _Hadley v
Baxendale_ (1854) 9 Exch 341, 354-55 in the following oft-cited words:

_

> > _

Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the
damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of
contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as either
arising naturally, i.e. according to the usual course of things, from such
breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been
in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as
the probable result of the breach of it.

13\. JY’s claim for consequential losses in relation to their contract with
Sasan does not rest on solid ground. For a start, it was not established that
JY made known the special circumstances of their contract with Sasan to SST.
Admittedly, JY’s manager, Kwon, initially claimed that SST’s Deen knew about
JY’s sub-contract with Sasan Farm. In paragraph 28 of his affidavit of
evidence-in-chief, he stated as follows:

> > During the extensive discussions between the Plaintiff and the 1st
> Defendant prior to the execution of the Contract, namely between 15 January
> 2001 to 16 February 2001, Jon and I had long and detailed discussions with
> Deen on various issues and topics relating to the role of the Plaintiff in
> DPRK and its customers including :-
>>

>> ….

>>

>> (c) details of the Plaintiff’s contractual obligations (except price) to
third parties in DPRK, including … [Sasan]

14\. However, Kwon’s position shifted when he was cross-examined. He said as
follows:

> > Q. Did you tell the defendant you had a sub-contract?

> > A. I said I have lots of contracts, one of which was Sasan. I __told him
> in general__ and _sometimes I put in the name of Sasan_ as one of my sub-
> purchasers.

> > Q. You did not tell him every detail?
>>

>> A. __I did not tell him every detail__.

>>

>> Q. What did you tell him about the Sasan contract?

> > A. I said I have a contract with Sasan. I did not mention Sasan every
> time.

15\. In contrast, Deen steadfastly maintained that he was unaware of JY’s sub-
contract with Sasan and the ramifications of this sub-contract. When cross-
examined, he said as follows:

> > Q. Did the plaintiffs discuss who their customers were?
>>

>> A. Never.

> > Q. Did you try to find out more about the sub-sale of oil in North Korea?
>>

>> A. The only thing they said was they can get Russian oil but they want to
try and get oil from this area.

>>

>> Q. Did you discuss the domestic market and who controls the prices?

>>

>> A. No. ….

16\. Mr Ameer Sadique Mohamed Zaheer, a former sales executive of SST, who
said that he was present during most of Deen’s meetings with the North
Koreans, also knew nothing about JY’s sub-contract with Sasan. He impressed me
as a truthful witness. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

> > Q. Did you recall conversations about JY’s sub-sale to a farm?
>>

>> A. No.

> > Q. During the extensive discussions, did you hear any talk about a sale of
> oil to a farm?
>>

>> A. No.

>>

>> Q. Was there any discussion on market conditions and the plaintiffs’
duties?

>>

>> A. In the meetings I attended, none of these was discussed.

17\. I hold that it was not established that SST were aware of JY’s sub-
contract with Sasan or of the terms of that sub-contract. The effect of a
party not knowing the special circumstances surrounding the other contracting
party’s sub-contract with third parties must be viewed in the light of _Hadley
v Baxendale,_ where Alderson B said as follows:

> > Now, if the special circumstances under which the contract was actually
> made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known
> to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract,
> which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which
> would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special
> circumstances so known and communicated. On the other hand, if these special
> circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract he, at
> the most, could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount
> of injury which would arise generally, and in the great multitude of cases
> not affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach of contract.

18\. The principles laid down in _Hadley v Baxendale_ have been restated in
subsequent cases, including _Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd. v Newman
Industries Ltd_[1949] 2 KB 528 and _Koufos v C Czarnikow_[1969] 1 AC 350,
where the House of Lords did not agree on a single reformulation of the rule
on remoteness of damage _._ The combined effect of all the cases on remoteness
of damage was summed up in _Chitty on Contracts,_ 28th ed, p 1291, in the
following terms:__

> > A type or kind of loss is not too remote a consequence of a breach of
> contract if, at the time of contracting (and on the assumption that the
> parties actually foresaw the breach in question), it was within their
> reasonable contemplation as a not unlikely result of that breach.

19\. If all the cases on remoteness of damage are taken into account, there
can be no doubt that JY’s loss under their sub-contract with Sasan is too
remote a consequence of SST’s breach of the contract to supply JY with 3,000
metric tonnes of Indonesian high speed diesel. In any case, what actually
transpired in the investigations in relation to Sasan’s claim against JY is
not known. The DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority furnished no grounds
for requiring JY to compensate Sasan USD620,000. Although a representative
from Sasan, Mr Nam Jong Ok, filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and was
listed as a witness in the present action against SST, JY chose to close their
case without calling him as a witness. As such, SST’s counsel was denied the
opportunity to question Mr Nam, whose answers could have shed more light on
the ramifications of Sasan’s petition to the Central Public Prosecutors’
Authority. After having taken into account all the circumstances of the case
and the evidence of the witnesses, I have no hesitation whatsoever in
dismissing JY’s claim for consequential losses under their sub-contract with
Sasan.

__

SST’s claim regarding a set-off

__

20\. I now turn to SST’s assertion that they are entitled to set-off
USD230,000 from the amount payable by them to JY for breach of contract. As
has been mentioned earlier on, Deen arranged for the transfer of USD230,000 to
JY in late 2001 and early 2002 to secure the release of Danny, who was then
being investigated by the DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority. SST
contended that this sum was actually a partial refund by them of the money
paid by JY for the high speed diesel and that it should be taken into account
for the purpose of computing the damages payable. JY disagreed and asserted
that the question of a set-off of the USD230,000 does not arise because this
sum was Danny’s "apology money" with respect to the criminal charges faced by
him. JY referred to Order No 572 of the DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’
Authority dated 12 November 2001, which is the following terms:

> > The Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority of DPRK have investigated into
> the matters concerning [Danny], the Captain of MT "Princess Sarah" which
> called at Nampo Port on 17th June 2001, … and discovered and confirms the
> following criminal and illegal behaviour committed by [Danny] and his crew.
>>

>> \- Captain has organised illegal international voyage by being involved in
chartering a vessel without Nationality Certificate …

> > \- Captain did not declare weapons, ammunition and satellite phones and
> concealed 3 pistols, ammunition, knives and 2 sets of satellite phones.

> > \- Captain used satellite phones from time to time and without permission
> even shot 1 bullet in the Nampo Port area, thus violating the safety of the
> country and being afraid of his crime, he threw away 1 pistol into the sea
>>

>> \- Captain and his crew violated public order in the Nampo area sea bathing
resorts, insulting ladies and gentlemen there and destroying some of the
resort facilities, thus several protests were made from several diplomats and
the local people.

>>

>> All the above criminal and illegal behaviour have been clearly proved by …
scientific and objective evidence. Therefore, the Central Public Prosecutors’
Authority informed [Danny] that he would be charged for minimum 10 years’
imprisonment under … Article 116 of the Criminal Law of the Republic.

>>

>> [Danny] confessed and recognised his crimes and the correctness of the law
of the Republic but suggested that as he eagerly wished to return to his
family in Singapore, he wished a compound in which he would pay USD230,000.00
for his apology and not … be prosecuted.

>>

>> … [T]he Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority decided to accept his apology
amount … and … orders as follows:

>>

>> 1\. [Danny] to arrange remittance of transfer of apology amount of
USD230,000.00 to the Credit Bank of Korea, Pyongyang in favour of [JY] not
later than end of December 2001.

>>

>> 2\. [JY] to arrange transfer of this amount immediately upon credit to the
national treasury account with the Foreign Trade Bank of DPRK.

21\. Danny, who denied that he had committed many of the offences referred to
in the Order of the DPRK Central Prosecutors’ Authority, admitted that he had
breached the DPRK’s laws in relation to possession of firearms and satellite
phones. Deen accepted that he had been informed about Danny’s predicament by
SST’s Korean agent, Kosa, and that he had been urged to help secure Danny’s
release. Contemporaneous documents with respect to the transfer of the
USD230,000 from Deen’s account indicate that the money was paid to secure
Danny’s release. On 24 December 2001, Danny’s wife, Jenny, wrote to JY as
follows:

> > Please be informed that I am trying my best to look for financial help for
> my husband (Capt. Danny Moorthy) and will be able to remit the balance money
> to you by end December 2001.
>>

>> Please bear with me during this 1 week period and arrange to send my
husband back to Singapore once you receive my remittance.

22\. On 21 January 2002, Deen wrote to JY’s Kwon as follows:

> > The Captain’s wife came to our office this morning crying and desperately
> seeking our help in releasing her husband from your custody. She says that
> so far she had borrowed the money from your relatives and friends to arrange
> for the US$200,000/- and now she needs to settle this amount by Chinese New
> Year. (14/02/2002). She says it would be better for her husband to be
> released earlier (before Chinese New Year) so that he can help her in
> settling the debts.
>>

>> Though the original amount asked by you was US$200,000/- and now you are
asking for further US$30,000/- she says she will try somehow to get the loan
by the end of this week.

>>

>> Please try to arrange to get her husband released by this week as she is
anxious for his safe return.

23\. SST contended that the above-mentioned letters from Danny’s wife, Jenny,
and Deen were written because they were told that Danny would only be released
if the USD230,000 was forwarded to JY on the basis that it was in respect of
Danny’s release from custody. What is strange is that when cross-examined,
Danny admitted that his wife had tried to borrow money to secure his release.
JY’s counsel, Mr Andre Arul, rightly pointed out that if the USD230,000 in
question was intended to be a partial refund of the purchase price paid by JY
to SST, there was no reason for Danny’s wife to try and raise money to secure
his release.

24\. What SST is in fact alleging is that JY is guilty of fraud and that the
DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority is colluding with JY to defraud
them. SST submitted that it should not be overlooked that the "apology money"
was transferred to JY’s account. Apart from the fact that fraud was not
pleaded by SST, it is pertinent to note that Mr Yun Jun Hi, the officer in the
Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority who took charge of the investigation
regarding Danny’s breach of the DPRK’s laws, testified that the "apology
money" had, for convenience, been paid into JY’s account because that company
had the requisite foreign exchange account and had prior dealings with SST. He
also confirmed that JY had transferred the USD230,000 in question to the
relevant government authority. It ought to be borne in mind that in
_Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A M Luther v James Sagor & Co_ [1921] All ER 138,
146, Warrington LJ said:

> > It is well settled that the validity of the acts of an independent
> sovereign government in relation to property and persons within its
> jurisdiction cannot be questioned in the courts of this country:
>>

>>> "Every sovereign State is bound to respect the independence of every other
sovereign State, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the
acts of the government of another done within its own territory"

>>

>> _

>>

>> per

>>

>> _ Clarke J, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United
States of America in _Oetjen v Central Leather Co …_(1917) 246 US Rep at p
303.

25\. It is for SST to prove their assertion that they were entitled to a set-
off with respect to the USD230,000 "apology money". As they failed to do so,
the said sum cannot be deducted from the damages payable to JY for their
breach of contract.

__

Costs

__

26\. As has been mentioned, SST accepted that JY are entitled to the sum of
USD600,200 for breach of contract if they had no right to set-off the
USD230,000 paid by them to JY in late 2001 and early 2002. JY are entitled to
costs as far as their claim for USD 600,200 is concerned.

27\. Different considerations arise with respect to the costs in relation to
JY’s claim for consequential losses and SST’s alleged set-off. JY’s counsel
pointed out that the alleged set-off occupied more time than their claim for
loss suffered under their sub-contract with Sasan. However, it must be borne
in mind that JY started off with three claims for consequential losses and a
number of representatives of those who entered into sub-contracts with JY
filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief. None of these representatives appeared
in court to give evidence. After taking all circumstances into account, I
order that with respect to JY’s claim for consequential loss under their sub-
contracts and SST’s claim regarding a set-off, the parties shall bear their
own costs.
