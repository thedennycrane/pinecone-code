Chan Seng Onn J:

1 The litigation plaguing Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”, also
referred to as “RTC”) and its associated or related parties has entered yet
another stage. In this particular suit, the Plaintiff is suing the Defendants,
namely Peter Lim, Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo, for breaching
their duties as directors of the Plaintiff whilst they were still directors of
the Plaintiff.

2 As the proprietor back in 1996 of the Raffles Town Club (“the Club”), the
Plaintiff had allowed 18,992 individuals to be accepted as members of the
Club. This later spawned much litigation and this suit is but one link in the
chain of litigation that has dogged RTC. The table of contents that follows
would aid in navigating through this somewhat lengthy judgment:

Dramatis Personae

3 The Plaintiff, RTC, is the owner and operator of the Club and was initially
incorporated in Singapore on 11 July 1996 as a public limited company, under
the name “Raffles Town Club Limited”. The following year, on 5 November 1997,
it was converted into a private exempt company and renamed Raffles Town Club
Pte Ltd.

4 Europa Holdings Pte Ltd (“EH”) is another company that was also incorporated
under the laws of Singapore. It was placed under voluntary liquidation on 7
March 2002 and was subsequently wound up on 28 February 2006. Until its
winding up, EH was in the food and beverage business and operated a chain of
pubs and restaurants as well as a now defunct country club, the Europa Country
Club & Resort (“ECCR”) (see [14] below). At all times material for the
purposes of the present action, RTC and EH had the same registered
shareholders and directors.

5 Peter Lim is the 1st defendant in this suit. RTC has alleged that at all
material times, and particularly between September 1996 and April 2001, Peter
Lim had been, contrary to his official title as a “consultant” of RTC, a _de
facto_ and/or shadow director of both RTC and EH. The Plaintiff contends that
during this period, Peter Lim was the person in accordance with whose
directions or instructions the directors of RTC and EH were accustomed to act.
No major decisions as regards EH and RTC were made without his consent and/or
approval. RTC also alleged that at all material times, Peter Lim had been a
shareholder of both EH and RTC, and his shareholdings were held on trust by
the 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants.

6 The 2nd defendant, Lawrence Ang, was a director of RTC from 10 October 1996
to 18 May 2001 and a director of EH from 29 November 1993 to 13 May 2001. He
was also a shareholder of both EH and RTC at all material times.

7 William Tan, the 3rd defendant, was a director of RTC from 18 January 1997
to 1 October 1998 and a director of EH from 27 November 1992 to 1 October
1998. He too was a shareholder of both EH and RTC at all material times.

8 As for Dennis Foo, the 4th defendant, he was a director of RTC from 11 July
1996 to 12 September 2000 and a director of EH from 29 November 1993 to 30
April 2001. Like the other Defendants, he was also a shareholder of both EH
and RTC at all material times.

9 Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei, the 1st and 2nd third parties in this
action, are the current directors and shareholders of RTC. Margaret Tung
became a shareholder of RTC on 12 May 2001 and was appointed to the board of
directors of RTC on 30 April 2001. Lin Jian Wei became a shareholder of RTC on
12 May 2001 and was appointed to the board of directors of RTC on 26 June
2001. Lin Jian Wei’s wife, one Zhang Shi Qing, was a shareholder of RTC from
20 June 2001 to 16 September 2004 and a director of the company from 26 June
2001 to 16 September 2004.

Background facts

10 RTC is no stranger to litigation. The most prominent of these is perhaps
“the members’ suit” of _Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd_
[2002] SGHC 278 (“the members’ suit”). There, disgruntled members of the
Club—having discovered that the general membership of the Club was in excess
of 18,000 members—sued RTC for breach of contract and misrepresentation.
Rajendran J sitting in the High Court dismissed their claims, finding that
there had been no actionable misrepresentation and no breach of the contract
to deliver a premier club. However, the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chin Seng and
others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd_ [2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 (“ _Tan Chin Seng
2003”_) partially reversed his findings. It found that RTC had breached an
implied term of the contract to provide a premier club. In _Raffles Town Club
Pte Ltd v Tan Chin Seng & others_ [2005] 4 SLR(R) 351, the Court of Appeal
ordered that compensation of $3,000 was payable to each plaintiff in the
members’ suit. By then, the new directors of RTC were Margaret Tung and Lin
Jian Wei. RTC claimed that it did not have sufficient funds to pay out the
compensation to all its members and subsequently obtained approval from the
Court for a Scheme of Arrangement (“the Scheme”) under s 210 of the Companies
Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”). RTC itself is now suing Peter
Lim, Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo for breach of trust and/or
fiduciary duties owed by them to RTC between the period of 1996 and April
2001. The 2nd and 3rd defendants, Lawrence Ang and William Tan, have joined
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei as 1st and 2nd third parties to the action. But
there were happier times.

Early days before RTC – Europa

11 As mentioned earlier (at [5] above), RTC alleges that Peter Lim was a
shadow or _de facto_ director at the material time even though he was listed
as a “consultant” on RTC’s books. Some history is necessary to appreciate the
significance of Peter Lim’s role in RTC and EH and how his sphere of influence
grew.

12 Before RTC came into being and well before Peter Lim arrived on the scene,
William Tan was best of friends with one Tan Buck Chye – whom he knew from
National Service. In 1987, Tan Buck Chye introduced William Tan to Lawrence
Ang. Their many common interests such as visiting pubs and discos brought them
close together, and at trial William Tan even testified that the three of them
were in many ways closer than brothers.

13 A pub the trio frequented was Europa Changi, which was owned by Dennis Foo.
Sometime in 1990, the trio approached Dennis Foo with regard to running a pub.
Eventually in July 1990 they purchased a 50% shareholding interest in Europa
Changi from Dennis Foo. A second pub called Europa International Plaza was
opened at International Plaza in October 1990. This was followed by a third
pub, Europa East Coast, in 1991. Under Tan Buck Chye’s leadership, Europa’s
business of running pubs and discos prospered. It was clear to and conceded by
Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo that Tan Buck Chye was indeed the
brains behind Europa’s successful pub business.

14 Around 1994, EH made a maiden foray into the country club business. It was
Tan Buck Chye’s idea to set up a country club, ECCR at the old Chequers Hotel
premises on Thomson Road and Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo went
along with his idea. Lawrence Ang put up about $2 to $3 million as a temporary
loan for the ECCR project. Though more than 12,000 membership applications
were received by ECCR, Tan Buck Chye decided to only accept around 5,000
members. The majority of the cash generated by the membership fees of ECCR
were all transferred out to EH either in the form of management fees or
dividends. By 1997, when the entrance fees collected by ECCR fell to a low of
$1.8 million, no management fees were collected from ECCR by EH. Spurred on by
the maiden success of ECCR, Tan Buck Chye decided that EH should expand
further into the lucrative country club business.

The Club’s beginnings

15 On or about 27 March 1996, EH tendered a $100 million bid for a piece of
land released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (“URA”) for
the purpose of building a private recreation club (“the RTC Project”) which
later turned out to be the Club. EH won the tender but it emerged that the
second highest bid for the land parcel was a distant $46.6 million. The
perception that followed was that EH had bid too much for the land. Lawrence
Ang, Tan Buck Chye, Dennis Foo and William Tan became concerned over whether
they could raise the necessary financing to proceed with the RTC Project. On
27 March 1996, Tan Buck Chye, William Tan and Lawrence Ang discussed their
options late into the night at Tan Buck Chye’s house. Tan Buck Chye explained
that he was still confident of the viability and profitability of the RTC
Project and the possibility of bringing in an investor to assist with the
financing was mooted. The discussions ended the following morning at 5 am.

Entry of Peter Lim

16 Tan Buck Chye eventually suggested approaching Peter Lim who was then known
as the “ _Remisier King_ ” in social circles. Tan Buck Chye informed Lawrence
Ang and William Tan that he had met Peter Lim at a social function sometime at
the end of 1995. He was clearly enamoured by Peter Lim’s reputation. Lawrence
Ang’s evidence in this regard was as follows: [note: 1]

COURT: |  Tell me why you called Peter Lim "Boss".  
---|---  
A: |  Peter Lim is -- actually is the boss.  
COURT: |  Did he ask you to call him "Boss"?  
A: |  He -- he didn't.  
COURT: |  Then why did you invent the name for him?  
A: |  Because he's the one who make the decision. Also, Mr Tan Buck Chye call Mr Peter Lim "god". Not only "boss".  
COURT: |  Are you joking?  
A: |  No, sir. When -- when first time Mr Tan Buck Chye met Mr Peter Lim, he was so happy, he called me, he said, "Hey, Lawrence, we are going to make a lot of money, because we met a god, money god". He say, "We are going to make a lot of money, no worry". He is so happy, that's why -- that is why he called Peter Lim god. Behind, he say, "Hey, the god, god".  
  
  

Tan Buck Chye’s alleged remarks proved to be prescient in more ways than one.

17 In June 1996, Peter Lim made his first investment in the RTC project,
channelling the funds through Lawrence Ang. This gave him a 20% beneficial
shareholding in the RTC project. Then, sometime in June 1996, Tan Buck Chye
suggested that Peter Lim’s participation be enlarged: from Peter Lim’s 20%
stake in the RTC project to 20% of EH, thereby including all of EH’s
businesses as well as the RTC project. Lawrence Ang and William Tan had
reservations about inviting Peter Lim to participate in EH given that they
had, at that time, only known him for less than two months. However, Tan Buck
Chye managed to convince them to allow Peter Lim’s participation in EH. In
return for his 20% stake in EH, Peter Lim would have to pay $15 million (in
addition to a $5 million investor’s capital).

18 By 11 July 1996, Raffles Town Club Limited was incorporated to own the
Club. Raffles Town Club Limited was incorporated with two issued shares
registered in the names of Tan Buck Chye and Dennis Foo. Tan Buck Chye and
Dennis Foo subsequently transferred their shares in Raffles Town Club Limited
to EH. On 24 December 1996, the shares of Raffles Town Club Limited were
transferred by EH to Erasmia Pte Ltd (“Erasmia”). Lawrence Ang, William Tan
and Dennis Foo were the shareholders of Erasmia at the material time. On 20
August 1997, Erasmia was renamed “RTC Holdings Pte Ltd”. Following the
conversion of Raffles Town Club Limited to RTC (a private exempt company) in
November 1997, the shares in RTC, which were then held by RTC Holdings Pte
Ltd, were transferred to Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo in the same
proportion as their shareholding in EH.

Peter Lim versus Tan Buck Chye

19 Cracks started appearing in the relationship between Peter Lim and Tan Buck
Chye. According to Lawrence Ang, the relationship between Peter Lim and Tan
Buck Chye started to sour between August 1996 and October 1996. It will be
recalled that Peter Lim had previously bought into a 20% stake in EH priced at
$20m. This had been based on Tan Buck Chye’s valuation of $100m for EH.
However, sometime in August 1996, Peter Lim started complaining that pub
closures (such as one Xanadu disco) and restricted hours did not make EH worth
$100 million any longer and he contended that Tan Buck Chye’s valuation was
wrong and that he had overpaid for his stake in EH. Peter Lim’s own valuation
of EH was only $60m. Tan Buck Chye argued that Peter Lim had invested at a
$100m valuation and should stick by his bargain. Arguments ensued over the
value of the Europa Group. By September 1996, Peter Lim was urging all of them
to quickly launch the Club. Peter Lim was heavily involved in the discussions
leading up to the membership launch of the Club. While Tan Buck Chye was
producing internal papers showing a pre-launch plan of up to 8,000 members,
Peter Lim was telling Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo that RTC needed
upwards of 10,000 applicants – otherwise the entire RTC project should be
abandoned.

20 Then, in October1996, the staff of EH were informed that Tan Buck
Chye—previously the Chief Executive Officer of EH—would be in charge of only
corporate and strategy planning. To put it crudely, a power struggle had
materialised. It appeared that both Peter Lim and Tan Buck Chye were each
trying to win Lawrence Ang and William Tan over to their side. As for Dennis
Foo, it was clear on the evidence that he had always been partial towards
Peter Lim. From mid-October 1996 to 30 November 1996, the Club conducted, with
much success, the priority membership launch. Around 24,000 applications were
received of which around 18,992 applications were accepted. It was also during
this period that Peter Lim convinced Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo
that EH needed to carry out a rights issue to beef up its balance sheet and to
improve its chances of a possible future listing. He even promised to arrange
the financing for them to take up their rights issue shares. However, he was
clear that he would not help Tan Buck Chye or his wife, Teriya. By this time,
Peter Lim and Tan Buck Chye were hardly on speaking terms with each other.
Eventually, a meeting to approve the rights issue was called with a day’s
notice, and subsequently Tan Buck Chye did not take up his rights issue
shares; nor did his wife. As a result, their stake in EH was halved.

21 In the end, on 16 April 1997, Tan Buck Chye and Teriya sold their shares in
EH for $7 million and their shares in RTC (or more accurately, Erasmia, which
held 100% of RTC then) for $1 million. They probably did not realise how many
members the Club had by that time accepted at $28,000 per member and how much
entrance fees had been received by that time and was still coming in.

22 While appearances suggested that it was Lawrence Ang who had purchased all
of Tan Buck Chye’s and his wife’s shares, in reality, almost half of these
shares were held for Peter Lim’s benefit. This was admitted by Lawrence Ang
during cross-examination by RTC’s counsel, Mr Ang Cheng Hock SC:[note: 2]

Q:You see what is filled up is that the declaration of the beneficial interest
of yourself is for 765,100 shares; right?

A:Yes, sir.

Q:What is stated here is not true, because actually Peter Lim owns—according
to you—at various stages, 32.222 per cent or 39-over per cent; correct?

A:Yes, sir.

Q:What you told the company auditors in this document is not true; right?

A:It’s based on our black-and-white, sir.

…

Q:Your case, Mr Ang, is that all along, you hold these shares on trust for
Peter Lim; correct?

A:Yes, sir.

Q:You signed documents, you told the auditors that you are the beneficial
shareholders of all the shares that are in your name; right?

A:Yes, sir.

…

Q:Are you saying that for all these years while you were a director, you
signed documents put in front of you without realising what the legal effect
is or what it really means? Are you saying that?

A:Sir, all this—is only the first time I hold shares for people---“people”
means Peter Lim. All the time I never hold share for other people.

23 Lawrence Ang conceded that he had effectively assisted Peter Lim in hiding
the latter’s assets from Peter Lim’s ex-wife; Peter Lim had been undergoing
divorce proceedings with his wife (now ex-wife) at the material time, and had
informed Lawrence Ang and the rest that it was not convenient for him to join
the company in his own name:[note: 3]

Q:…Do you know that Mr Peter Lim was hiding his assets from his wife?

A:He—

Q:He told you that, right?

A:Yes, yeah, he say that it is not convenient for him to come in as his own
name,

Q:So you understand that he was hiding his assets from his wife; correct?

A:Yes, can be say that. If you ask me to think now, yes.

Thus, on paper, Lawrence Ang held nearly 80% of the shares in Erasmia/Raffles
Town Club Limited and EH because of the EH rights issue and the purchase of
Tan Buck Chye’s and Teriya’s shares. However, the actual beneficial
shareholding in EH and Erasmia/Raffles Town Club Limited after Tan Buck Chye’s
departure was roughly in the proportion of 40:40:10:10, being Peter Lim’s,
Lawrence Ang’s, William Tan’s and Dennis Foo’s shares respectively.

Subsequent events

24 On 19 June 1997, two days after Tan Buck Chye and Teriya had sold their
shares in Erasmia/Raffles Town Club Limited and EH, RTC decided that EH would
be paid a marketing commission of 10% for each member’s entrance fee of
$28,000. As mentioned above (at [23]), the respective shareholdings of
Lawrence Ang, Peter Lim, William Tan and Dennis Foo after Tan Buck Chye and
Teriya sold their shares stood at approximately 40:40:10:10. Peter Lim was now
a shareholder in RTC and EH and was also appointed a “consultant”. At his
behest, certain key individuals were appointed to RTC as managers,
accountants, and directors. Prior to this, sometime in November 1996, one Chan
Lay Hoon had been appointed upon Peter Lim’s directions, to be RTC’s financial
controller. She would oversee the running of the accounts department of RTC
and was also in charge of supervising the administrative and membership
departments. On 1 July 1998, she was appointed to the Board of Directors of EH
and RTC and also further appointed as one of two cheque signatories (alongside
Lawrence Ang) for RTC and EH on 28 September 1998. This too was presumably on
Peter Lim’s instructions.

25 While it had been agreed in June 1997 that a marketing commission of 10%
would be paid to EH (see [24] above), the Defendants eventually decided
sometime in October 1997 that the commission payable to EH would be increased
to 15% per membership entrance fee. The four Defendants subsequently entered
into a written Management Agreement (“Management Agreement”) with EH for its
marketing services in relation to the hugely successful priority membership
launch of the Club. The Management Agreement was backdated to 28 September
1996.

26 In March 2000, the Club opened its doors to members. For the first three to
six months after the Club opened, it suffered from overcrowding and the staff
struggled to cope with the many members and the members’ families attending at
the Club’s premises. However, the usage level declined subsequently and became
manageable after this initial overcrowding as testified by one Moh Siang King.
Moh Siang King was the finance manager of RTC at the material time, and as a
witness in the trial of this action, I found her to be non-partisan and
reliable and her evidence, credible.

27 In June 2000, Peter Lim finally settled the division of his matrimonial
assets with his wife. He then started asking for his 40% stake in EH and RTC
in August 2000, which apparently had not been disclosed at the matrimonial
proceedings. Specifically, he asked Lawrence Ang to cause RTC and EH to issue
40% of their shares to him and 10.1% shares to Dennis Foo. This was when
Lawrence Ang realised that Peter Lim wanted control of both EH and RTC. Peter
Lim’s demands did not accord with the collective arrangement they had in place
since Tan Buck Chye’s departure in 1997, namely, that Lawrence Ang and William
Tan would own slightly more than 50% of EH and RTC. Acceding to Peter Lim’s
demands would give Peter Lim and Dennis Foo majority ownership and control of
EH and RTC.

Souring of the relationship between Lawrence Ang and Peter Lim

28 Towards the end of August 2000, a board meeting was held where legal
documents were placed before Lawrence Ang. He was told to execute the
documents immediately to grant an option to Peter Lim to officially take up a
shareholding of 40% in RTC and EH. However, having witnessed how Peter Lim had
got rid of Tan Buck Chye and Teriya from EH and RTC, and forced the removal in
late 1998 of William Tan as a director of EH and RTC over a trivial dispute
between William Tan and Chan Lay Hoon, Lawrence Ang understandably demurred
and said that he wanted to seek legal advice. This angered Peter Lim who
allegedly threatened to destroy the Club. Nevertheless, Lawrence Ang
subsequently obtained legal advice and decided that he had to take control of
the board, which was at that time populated with Peter Lim’s nominees.
Lawrence Ang then moved to call an Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) to
sack Peter Lim’s nominees from the board. Peter Lim immediately responded with
an application for an injunction and sued Lawrence Ang and William Tan for
majority control and ownership of EH and RTC. As expected, Dennis Foo took
Peter Lim’s side in this dispute.

29 These legal manoeuvres culminated in a trial, Suit No 742 of 2000 (“S
742/2000”) which took place in March 2001. It was in the course of this trial
that it was revealed to the public for the first time that RTC had taken in
19,048 members, making it the largest social club in Singapore by far. The
members felt they had been deceived and were furious, and this eventually
translated into the members’ suit (see [10] above). For ease of reference, the
19,048 members will be referred to as “the 19,000 members”.

30 In April 2001, Peter Lim, Lawrence Ang, Dennis Foo and William Tan settled
their claims vis-à-vis one another. Peter Lim and Dennis Foo sold their
approximately 50% stake in RTC and EH to Lawrence Ang and William Tan;
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei then acquired their stake in RTC and EH from
Lawrence Ang and William Tan. Meanwhile, the members’ suit was brewing and
commenced by November 2001. I have alluded to Rajendran J’s findings in the
said suit above, at [10]. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found in the members’
favour and subsequently ruled in the assessment of damages hearing that RTC
would have to pay $3,000 to each of the 4,885 plaintiffs in the members’ suit
for breaching an implied term in the contract to provide a premier club. As
mentioned earlier (at [10] above), the Scheme was subsequently entered into by
RTC and all its members wherein RTC was going to compensate all its members
almost $53m in total at $3,000 per member (to be paid either in vouchers, part
cash/part vouchers or by way of reduction of the prevailing transfer fee).

31 The present suit has now been instituted against the Defendants for
breaching their duties as directors of RTC during the period of 1996 to 2000.
The material facts concern the various acts of the Defendants during that
period.

The Plaintiff’s claim

32 The Plaintiff alleges that the four Defendants had each breached
their:[note: 4]

(a)

duty to act in good faith in the best interests of RTC;

(b)

fiduciary duty of loyalty;

(c)

duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in the discharge of their
managerial functions and responsibilities;

(d)

duty to act with due care and diligence; and

(e)

duty to act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of their
duties pursuant to s 157 of the Companies Act

by devising a scheme the purpose and effect of which was to enable them to
“siphon substantial sums of money from RTC for their own benefit.” This
alleged scheme is quite elaborate as seen below.

Acceptance of the 19,000 members

33 First of all, the Plaintiff avers that the scheme had involved the
Defendants’ conducting a founder members’ launch in which the Club was
marketed as an exclusive and premier members’ recreation club. Membership was
deliberately priced at $28,000 to be payable in instalments so as to ensure a
maximum number of applications for membership. The promotional material had
also stated that founder membership at $28,000 was a one-off opportunity and
that future membership of the Club would cost some $40,000. This, the
Plaintiff alleges, was intended to attract and net as many members as possible
so as to maximise the revenue generated by RTC from the membership launch
regardless of its obligations to its members. The Plaintiff further contends
that the Defendants and/or each of them knew and/or ought to have known that
the maximum number of initial members for an exclusive, premier club on the
site with the intended facilities was for around 7,000 members. Any more than
this number would result in serious overcrowding and the Club would cease to
be exclusive and premier. As a result of the acceptance of a large number of
members totalling 18,992 in the priority membership launch, $531,776,000 was
envisaged to be received by RTC over the next 4 years from membership fees.
The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants in accepting the 19,000 members had
breached their director duties and/or were negligent in failing to control the
number of applications and/or had no proper regard to RTC’s interests in
accepting the 19,000 members when the intended facilities were adequate for
only a “maximum initial membership of around 7,000 members.” The Plaintiff
further submits that the Defendants are also liable for the offence of
cheating under s 415 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Penal
Code”) for making representations to the press and in the promotional
materials that gave the impression that there would be 7,000 members and that
the Club would be “exclusive and premier”.

Circumventing s 162 and s 403 of the Companies Act

34 Another prong in the Plaintiff’s claim is its contention that the
Defendants had each wrongfully authorised, sanctioned, claimed and paid
themselves substantial and unreasonable sums in the form of directors’
remuneration, expenses and consultancy fees which were neither reasonable nor
justified nor in the interests of RTC.

The Management Fees

35 This second part of the scheme allegedly involved the Defendants’ attempts
to circumvent ss 162 and 403 of the Companies Act in order to obtain a
substantial portion of the monies received by the Plaintiff by way of
membership fees for their personal benefit. To this end, the Plaintiff alleges
that the Defendants caused RTC to enter into a “sham” Management Agreement
with EH (see [25] above) under which RTC undertook to pay 15% of the
prevailing membership fee per accepted member to EH as commission. The
Management Agreement was backdated to 28 September 1996. In total,
$78,267,723.80 (“$78m”) was paid to EH by RTC between 11 May 1997 and mid
August 1999 as management fees pursuant to the Management Agreement. The
Plaintiff contends that EH never provided the Plaintiff with any of the
services enumerated in the Management Agreement. Rather, it avers, it had been
RTC, not EH which undertook the work pertaining to the membership launches.
Further, the Plaintiff claims that if there had been any work done or services
provided by EH pertaining to the management, sales, marketing and/or
promotional services provided to RTC, they were _de minimis_ and nowhere
sufficient to justify the level of fees paid by RTC to EH. The Management
Agreement was thus a “sham” and, according to the Plaintiff, the $78m was
actually received by the four Defendants as “directors’ loans” and/or
“advances on dividends”.

Directors’ remuneration

36 As for the directors’ remuneration, RTC contends that some $13,142,088.00
(“the $13m”) had been paid to the Defendants as “purported remuneration”. The
Plaintiff claims that the $78m of management fees and the $13m of purported
directors’ remuneration “amounted in substance” to an unauthorised return of
RTC’s capital to its shareholders and that these payments were simply “dressed
up payment of dividends out of capital” under circumstances where RTC could
not lawfully pay dividends as it had no profits by accounting standards. Under
s 403 of the Companies Act, dividends may only be payable “out of profits”.

Conspiracy

37 According to the Plaintiff, _in toto_ , this implementation of the said
scheme had involved conduct which caused injury to RTC wrongfully, negligently
and/or intentionally – inasmuch as RTC was deprived of its property and of its
ability to meet its obligations to members of the Club and rendered liable to
the latter for breach of contract. The breach of duties owed by the Defendants
to the Plaintiff and the circumvention of the provisions in ss 162 and 403 of
the Companies Act meant that the Defendants were liable to RTC in conspiracy
and in breach of s 157 of the Companies Act.

The use of $33m

38 The Plaintiff also pleads that, between February 1997 and April 1997, the
Defendants had, in breach of their fiduciary duties, in breach of trust and
without proper regard for RTC’s interests, caused a sum of $33m to be
transferred from its accounts to an offshore banking account in the name of
Raffles Town Club (International) Ltd (“RTCI”). It contends that the Defendant
had applied these monies as if they were loans to the Defendants for their own
purposes and benefit. Overall, the Plaintiff claims that there had been a
breach of duty and misapplication of RTC’s property pursuant to a conspiracy.
The Plaintiff avers that the $33m was a disguised directors’ loan in breach of
s 162 of the Companies Act. Further, the Plaintiff was deprived of the use of
these monies for its benefit. Hence, the Defendants’ conduct constituted a
misfeasance and misapplication of RTC’s funds in breach of trust and their
fiduciary duties towards RTC.

39 Pursuant to the above allegations raised against the Defendants, the
Plaintiff is claiming:[note: 5]

(a) Damages for conspiracy and/or breach of duty and/or negligence together
with interest at such a rate and for such a period as the Court thinks fit
pursuant to s 12 of the Civil Law Act [(Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Civil Law
Act”)]; and

(b) An indemnity in respect of any and all liability on the part of RTC to
members of the Club arising out of the facts and matters herein complained of;
and

(c) Profits and/or damages pursuant to s 157(3) of the Companies Act (Cap.
50).

(2) Further or alternatively:

(a) A declaration that the Defendants and each of them as former directors of
the Plaintiff in the case of the Second to Fourth Defendants and as former de
facto Managing Director and/or de factor Director and/or shadow director of
the Plaintiff in the case of the First Defendant have been guilty of
misfeasance and breach of trust and/or duty in relation to the Plaintiff by
making or causing to be made the said payment to EH and themselves;

(b) A declaration that the Defendants and each of them are jointly and
severally liable to the Plaintiff for the monies misapplied by them.

(c) An order that the Defendants and each of them repay the Plaintiff the said
sums, together with interest at such a rate and for such a period as the Court
thinks fit pursuant to s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) or under the
equitable jurisdiction of the Court;

(d) Profits and/or damages pursuant to s 157(3) of the Companies Act;

(3) All necessary accounts and enquiries including an account and inquiry as
to what has become of the monies paid out under the Management Agreement and
whether any and if so, what parts thereof remain;

(3A) An order that the Defendants (or each of them as may be appropriate) pay
and/or transfer to the Plaintiff such monies or property or other asset as may
be found to be due to the Plaintiff upon the taking of accounts and conduct of
the inquiry.

(4) Costs.

(5) Further or other relief.

In addition, the Plaintiff remarked that it would give each of the Defendants
credit for what would have constituted reasonable directors’ remuneration and
expenses for the period May 1997 to August 2000.[note: 6]

40 Before I delve into an analysis of the issues enumerated in the Plaintiff’s
claim as set out above, it is necessary for me to examine the veracity of the
Plaintiff’s allegation that the 1st Defendant, Peter Lim, had been either a
shadow or a _de facto_ director of RTC. The result of accepting the
Plaintiff’s submission is that Peter Lim would have the ordinary duties of a
director imposed upon him. I therefore deal with this preliminary matter in
the following section.

The law on shadow and _de facto_ directors

41 The distinction between a “shadow” and “ _de facto_ ” director is not
always an easy one to draw and the two terms have sometimes been used
interchangeably. In a way, both these terms have often been used with ill-
deserved confidence, as if it is apparent from their labels what they mean. In
the following section I will attempt to demystify the law in this area.

Shadow directors

42 It is interesting to note that while the current version of the Companies
Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the 2006 Act”) contains no definition of “shadow
director” or “ _de facto_ ” director, its predecessor, the Companies Act (Cap
50, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the 1994 Act”) had in s 149(8) drawn a distinction between
a “director” and a “shadow director”:

(8) In this section-

…

“director”, in relation to a company, includes a “shadow director”; …

“shadow director”, in relation to a company, means a person _in accordance
with whose directions or instructions the directors of a company are
accustomed to act_ except that a person shall not be deemed to be a shadow
director by reason only that the directors act on advice given by him in a
professional capacity.

[emphasis added]

Meanwhile, s 4 of the 1994 Act which defined “director” provided that:

“director” includes any person occupying the position of director of a
corporation by whatever name called and includes a person _in accordance with
whose directions or instructions the directors of a corporation are accustomed
to act_ and an alternative or substitute director … [emphasis added]

43 In its October 2002 report, the Company Legislation and Regulatory
Framework Committee recommended the repeal of the separate definitions of
“director” and “shadow director”, pointedly remarking that (see _Company
Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee Report_ (October 2002), Chapter
Three – Corporate Governance, at para 2.1.2):

[There is] a drafting anomaly in s 149(8), CA and s 149A, CA, which attempt
separate definitions of “director” and “shadow director” only for these
provisions. The particular definitions of director and shadow director have
the effect of repeating substantive definitions in s 4(1), CA and s 4(2), CA
and are accordingly superfluous and warrant repeal. We also note the reference
to shadow directors in Rule 2 of the Companies (Application of Bankruptcy Act
Provisions) Regulations.

44 Simply put, the Committee was of the view that the definition of “director”
in s 4(1) of the 1994 Act already encompassed that of a “shadow” director. As
is plain from the wording of the respective provisions which both contain the
phrase “in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a
corporation are accustomed to act”, it is hard to resist the logic of this
view and it was given judicial credence in _Heap Huat Rubber Company Sdn Bhd
and Others v Kong Choot Sian and Others_ [2004] SGCA 12 (“ _Heap Huat Rubber
Company_ ”) where the Court of Appeal remarked that (at [66]):

We do not feel that it is helpful to refer to Kong as a “shadow director”.
Instead, we prefer to regard Kong as a “director” under the definition
provided in s 4 of the Singapore Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed).

45 Unsurprisingly, the 2006 Act has dispensed with the distinction between a
“director” and “shadow director” and has simply retained the following
definition in s 4(1):

"director" includes any person occupying the position of director of a
corporation by whatever name called and includes a person in accordance with
whose directions or instructions the directors of a corporation are accustomed
to act and an alternate or substitute director …

It can thus be safely said that a “shadow director” is one “in accordance with
whose instructions and directions the directors are accustomed to act”. By
“accustomed”, this means that there must be a “pattern of behaviour” (per Lord
Millet J in _Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd_ [1994] BCC 161 (“ _Re Hydrodam_ ”) at
163) on the part of the rest of the directors in complying with the shadow
director’s directions or instructions. In her article, Pearlie Koh, “Shadow
Director, Shadow Director, Who Art Thou?” (1994) 14 C&SLJ 340 (“Pearlie Koh”),
the learned author has observed that the word “accustomed” (at p 343):

…suggest[s] some degree of habit. There must be some consistent pattern in the
behaviour of compliance. Occasional instances of compliance would not be
sufficient to satisfy the definition. Equally, in the converse situation where
there is such a pattern of compliance, the occasional exercise of independent
judgment by the board should not excuse the alleged shadow director.

I concur with her views. For the directors of a corporation to be “accustomed
to act” in accordance to the alleged shadow director’s directions and
instructions, a discernable pattern of compliance with the shadow director’s
instructions or directions would suffice. Even though there may be occasional
departure from this pattern for _whatever reason_ , the essence of shadow
directorship may still remain intact. Ultimately, it is a question of fact to
be determined by the court having regard to all the facts and circumstances in
each case.

46 I should add that in _Re Hydrodam_ , apart from requiring that there be a
“pattern of behaviour” in complying with the alleged shadow director’s
directions or instructions, Millet J had also stated that the board of
directors would not have “exercise[ed] any discretion or judgment of its own,
but acted in accordance with the directions of others.” This formulation
imposes an additional element into the definition which as Associate Professor
Pearlie Koh has noted, is “unnecessary” (Pearlie Koh, [45]  _supra_ , at p
344). Indeed, I find that the introduction of an element of “manipulation” or
“puppeteering” into the definition generates more confusion. The rationale for
the concept of a “shadow director” was, in all likelihood, to circumvent the
difficulty of imputing directorship to an individual who had not put himself
out as a director of the company and had not acted as if he was on equal
standing with the _de jure_ directors, yet exerted real influence on the
corporate decisions of the company. To call such an individual a “director”
would create a schism in one’s ordinary understanding of a “director” since,
in most cases, such an individual would have taken the greatest caution not to
come across as being on par with the _de jure_ directors and would not be
perceived as a director at all – whether _de jure_ or _de facto_. Yet, as
someone who was directing the directors in important corporate decisions, the
definition of a director had to be extended so that the law could hold him
responsible for his actions. This is where the concept of a “shadow director”
is helpful.

47 Consequently, if a board of directors exercising independent judgment finds
itself consistently complying with the alleged shadow director’s instructions
or directions, such an individual is as much a shadow director as one whose
instructions or directions are consistently complied with by a board which
does not exercise independent judgment but simply abides by or follows those
instructions or directions. This might be counter-intuitive since the term
“shadow director” has over time, acquired a pejorative meaning – with phrases
such as “lurking in the shadows”, “puppet master”, “cat’s paw” tacked to it.
However, it must be borne in mind that incorporating such additional
requirements into the definition would defeat the rationale of the “shadow
director definition” (which is an extended definition of “director”) as “it
would be all too easy for the [board of] directors to recite that, having
considered the ‘advice’ of the alleged shadow director, they had on their
judgment decided to follow that advice” (N R Campbell, “Liability as a Shadow
Director” [1994] JBL 609 at 613). Indeed, the raison d’être of this concept is
to ensure that those who are responsible for the important corporate decisions
of a company are held to task regardless of what they are called and their
motives or manner in making such corporate decisions.

48 The test is, thus, simple: is there sufficient evidence showing that the
directors of a corporation are accustomed to act on the directions or
instructions of that person? If yes, then the status of a shadow director may
be imputed to him. Whether the board has exercised its decision independently
or otherwise is irrelevant and has to be so: otherwise, the rationale
underpinning the “shadow director” concept would be subverted. It follows,
therefore, that the shadow director is not necessarily a sinister puppeteer
who is manipulating the board from the wings of a stage as our imaginations
would have us believe. Indeed, the “shadow director” epithet is sometimes
exaggerated as Morritt LJ observed in _Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry v Deverell and another_ [2001] Ch 340 (at 354-355):

…[T]he use of epithets or descriptions in place of the statutory definition of
a shadow director… may be very effective in graphically conveying the effect
of the definition in the light of the facts of that case, as shown by their
frequent use in the reported cases to which I have referred. But, it seems to
me, they may be misleading when transposed to the facts of other cases. Thus
to describe the board as the cat's paw, puppet or dancer to the tune of the
shadow director implies a degree of control both of quality and extent over
the corporate field in excess of what the statutory definition requires. What
is needed is that the board is accustomed to act on the directions or
instructions of the shadow director. As I have already indicated such
directions and instructions do not have to extend over all or most of the
corporate activities of the company; nor is it necessary to demonstrate a
degree of compulsion in excess of that implicit in the fact that the board are
accustomed to act in accordance with them. Further, in my view, it is not
necessary to the recognition of a shadow director that he should lurk in the
shadows, though frequently he may, for example, in the case of a person
resident abroad who owns all the shares in a company but chooses to operate it
through a local board of directors. From time to time the owner, to the
knowledge of all to whom it may be of concern, gives directions to the local
board what to do but takes no part in the management of the company himself.
In my view such an owner may be a shadow director notwithstanding that he
takes no steps to hide the part he plays in the affairs of the company.
Lurking in the shadows may occur but is not an essential ingredient to the
recognition of the shadow director.

Morritt LJ’s remarks resonate with my earlier expressed view at [45] above.

49 Before I conclude this section on the concept of the shadow director, I
must address the implications of a finding that a person is a shadow director.
By virtue of s 4(1) of the 2006 Act, a shadow director would be considered a
director and thereby, in my judgment, have the ordinary duties of a director
imposed on him. This is unlike the case in the UK where its company
legislation (including the UK Companies Act 2006) does not equate a shadow
director with a “director” for all statutory purposes. For instance, in
_Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Fielding_ [2006] FSR 17, Lewison J found that the mere
fact that a person fell within the statutory definition of “shadow director”
was not enough to impose upon him the same fiduciary duties as are owed by a
_de jure_ or _de facto_ director, though the learned judge accepted that in a
particular factual matrix a shadow director’s actions may extend beyond the
exertion of indirect influence and thereby subject him to certain fiduciary
duties.

De facto directors

50 So much for shadow directors. As for the term “ _de facto_ ” directors,
there does not appear to be any local judicial pronouncement on its exact
meaning. Perhaps it is clear enough from the description “ _de facto_ ” that a
_de facto_ director is one who is not formally appointed as a director but in
fact acts as a director by exercising the powers and discharging the functions
of a director. He is therefore in substance a director. Whether a person is to
be regarded as a “ _de facto_ ” director because he has acted as a director
though not formally appointed is, as such, very much a question of fact; and,
in any case, previous case law has relied on Millet J’s formulation in _Re
Hydrodam_ where the learned judge defined a _de facto_ director as (at 163):

… a person who assumes to act as a director. He is held out as a director by
the company, and claims and purports to be a director, although not validly
appointed as such. To establish that a person was a de facto director of a
company it is necessary to plead and prove that he undertook functions in
relation to the company which could properly be discharged only by a director.

51 I note, however, that the Australian courts have not applied Millet J’s
requirement that the alleged _de facto_ director himself must claim to be a
director. In _Mistmorn Pty Ltd (in liq) and Hugh Jenner Wily v Michael
Yasseen_ 33 ATR 332 (FCA) (“ _Mistmorn_ ”), the respondent, Mr Yasseen, had
described himself as a “consultant” of Mistmorn Pty Ltd and testified that he
had not intended to be a director and had never claimed to be one.
Nonetheless, the Federal Court of Australia found that he had been a _de
facto_ director, as he (at 341):

… involved himself in the affairs of [the company] as only a director of the
company would have been expected to do. I do not say that he held himself out
to be a director, for, as I have said, I think that he intended not to be a
director, but he dealt with the matters one would expect a director to handle.

52 In another Australian case, _Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Austin_ 39
ATR 485 (FCA) (“ _Austin_ ”), the court observed that even though the
respondent had never believed that “in law, he was … acting as a director”, it
found on the evidence before it that the respondent was nonetheless a _de
facto_ director. It is interesting to note that at the time _Austin_ and
_Mistmorn_ were decided, s 60(1) of Australia’s Corporations Act 1989 (“the
1989 Act”) had defined “directors” as including a reference to:

(a) a person occupying or acting in the position of director of the body, by
whatever name called and whether or not validly appointed to occupy, or duly
authorised to act in, the position;

(b) a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors
of the body are accustomed to act …

53 As can be seen, the wording of ss 60(1)(a) and (b) of the 1989 Act are
substantially similar to s 4(1) of the 1994 Act and the 2006 Act. Since
_Austin_ and _Mistmorn_ , there has been some tweaking of the definition of
“director” in Australian legislation. Sections 60(1)(a) and (b) of the 1989
Act have reappeared as s 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (“the 2001 Act”) which
is currently in force in Australia:

Unless a contrary intention appears: …

director of a company or other means:

(a)a person who:

(i) is appointed to the position of a director; or

(ii) is appointed to the position of an alternate director and is acting in
that capacity;

(b)unless the contrary intention appears, a person who is not validly
appointed as a director if:

(i) they act in the position of a director; or

(ii) the directors of the company are accustomed to act in accordance with the
person’s instructions or wishes.

54 Quite plainly, the essence of ss 60(1)(a) and (b) of the 1989 Act is
retained in s 9 of the 2001 Act notwithstanding the substitution of the word
“directions” with “wishes”. The similarity in wording and essence of these
provisions with s 4(1) of the 1994 Act and 2006 Act is hard to miss. In Martin
Markovic, “When are you a director when you’re not a director? The law of _de
facto_ directors” (2007) 25 C&SLJ 101, the learned author pointed out that
though the words “shadow” and “ _de facto_ ” directors are not mentioned in
the Australian statutory definition, it is “widely accepted” that the
definition in s 9 includes them both. He observes that the words in s 9(b)(ii)
that “the directors of the company are accustomed to act in accordance with
the person’s instructions or wishes” has “attracted the label ‘shadow
directors’”, whilst s 9(b)(i) “act in the position of a director” has
“attracted the label ‘ _de facto_ director’”. By parity of reasoning, it can
be said that our s 4(1) which speaks of a person “occupying the position of
director of a corporation by whatever name” alludes to a _de facto_ director
and the phrase “in accordance with whose directions or instructions the
directors of a corporation are accustomed to act” alludes to “shadow
directors”.

55 In summary, it is not required that a _de facto_ director intends to be a
director or has claimed to be a director. Lending force to the Australian
approach is the fact that recent English authorities have since tinkered a
little with Millet J’s definition. In _Re Kaytech International plc_ [1999]
BCC 390 (“ _Re Kaytech_ ”), the English Court of Appeal endorsed the remarks
of Jacob J in _Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Tjolle_ [1998] BCC
282 (“ _Re Tjolle_ ”) where in declining to formulate a single test for _de
facto_ directorship, Jacob J had opined (at 290):

[I]t may be difficult to postulate any one decisive test. I think what is
involved is very much a question of degree. The court takes into account all
the relevant factors. Those factors include at least whether or not there was
a holding out by the company of the individual as a director, whether the
individual used the title, whether the individual had proper information (_eg_
, management accounts) on which to base decisions, and whether the individual
has to make major decisions and so on. Taking all these factors into account,
one asks, “Was this individual part of the corporate governing structure?”,
answering it as a kind of jury question. In deciding this, one bears very much
in mind why one is asking the question. That is why I think the passage I
quoted from Millett J is important. There would be no justification for the
law making a person liable to misfeasance or disqualification proceedings
unless they were truly in a position to exercise the powers and discharge the
functions of a director. Otherwise they would be made liable for events over
which they had no real control, either in fact or law.

56 Robert Walker LJ, delivering the judgment in _Re Kaytech_ remarked (at
402):

I do not understand Jacob J, in the first part of that passage, to be
enumerating tests which must all be satisfied if de facto directorship is to
be established. He is simply drawing attention to some (but not all) of the
relevant factors, recognising that the crucial issue is whether the individual
in question has assumed the status and functions of a company director so as
to make himself responsible … as if he were a de jure director.

His Lordship also pointed out that:

… the two concepts [of shadow and de facto director] do have at least this
much in common, that an individual who was not a de jure director is alleged
to have exercised real influence (otherwise than as a professional adviser) in
the corporate governance of a company. Sometimes that influence may be
concealed and sometimes it may be open. Sometimes it may be something of a
mixture, as the facts of the present case show.

57 Robert Walker LJ observations are instructive. Indeed, it must be right
that both shadow and _de facto_ directors must have exercised “real influence”
in the corporate governance of the company, otherwise it would not make sense
to impute directorship and its attendant duties to such individuals.

58 In _Gemma Ltd v Davies_ [2008] BCC 812 (“ _Gemma_ ”), Jonathan Gaunt QC
(sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court) eloquently expressed the
principles, rather than an iron-clad test, in inquiring whether there had been
_de facto_ directorship. Drawing together the various threads of analysis
found in the various cases cited to him by counsel including _Re Hydrodam_ (as
well as _Re Richborough Furniture Ltd_ [1996] BCC 155, _Re Tjolle_ ,
_Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Jones_ [1999] BCC 336, _Re
Kaytech, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Hollier_ [2007] BCC 11
and _Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Aviss_ [2007] BCC 288 (“ _Re
Mea Corp_ ”)) the judge observed at [40]:

From those cases I derive the following propositions material to the facts of
this case:

(1) To establish that a person was a _de facto_ director of a company, it is
necessary to plead and prove that he undertook functions in relation to the
company which could properly be discharged only by a director (per Millett J.
in _Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd (in liq.)_ [1994] BCC 161 at 163).

(2) It is not a necessary characteristic of a de facto director that he is
held out as a director; such “holding out” may, however, be important evidence
in support of the conclusion that a person acted as a director in fact (per
Etherton J. in _Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Hollier_ [2006]
EWHC 1804 (Ch); [2007] BCC 11 at [66]).

(3) Holding out is not a sufficient condition either. What matters is not what
he called himself but what he did (per Lewison J. _in Re Mea Corp Ltd_ [2006]
EWHC 1846 (Ch); [2007] BCC 288).

(4) It is necessary for the person alleged to be a de facto director to have
participated in directing the affairs of the company (Hollier (above) at [68])
on an equal footing with the other director(s) and not in a subordinate role
(above at [68] and [69] explaining dicta of Timothy Lloyd Q.C. in _Re
Richborough Furniture Ltd_ [1996] BCC 155 at 169–170).

(5) The person in question must be shown to have assumed the status and
functions of a company director and to have exercised “real influence” in the
corporate governance of the company (per Robert Walker L.J. in _Re Kaytech
International Plc_ [1999] BCC 390).

(6) If it is unclear whether the acts of the person in question are referable
to an assumed directorship or to some other capacity, the person in question
is entitled to the benefit of the doubt (per Timothy Lloyd Q.C. in _Re
Richborough Furniture Ltd_ (above)), but the court must be careful not to
strain the facts in deference to this observation (per Robert Walker L.J. in
_Kaytech_ at 401).

59 These are well-reasoned and sound guidelines which I find most salutary in
clarifying the current legal position. Instead of pointing to specific acts as
indicia of _de facto_ directorship, one must look at the _aggregate_ of the
acts of the controller in question. As can be seen, the English courts do not
regard the “holding out” of a person as a director _per se_ as being
conclusive of his status as a director or otherwise (unlike Millet J’s
formulation). As Jonathan Gaunt QC remarked at [42] (citing Lewison J in _Re
Mea Corp Ltd_ at [82]), “what is important is not what he called himself, but
what he did”.

60 In _Gemma_ ([58] _supra_), Jonathan Gaunt QC found that while there had
been slight evidence of the defendant being held out as a director, the
defendant really had no “real influence” on the corporate decision making
process, being compliant and even subservient towards her husband (who was a
director in the company) in major corporate decisions.

61 Though it may be argued that England, unlike Australia, does not have a
statutory definition of “ _de facto_ directorship”, it is readily apparent
from Jonathan Gaunt QC’s judgment that the subjective intentions of the
controller are of peripheral, if any significance. Indeed, the test is an
objective one: what matters is what he did, not what he called himself.

Summing up

62 To put it simply, _de facto_ directors are those who “act as directors” and
shadow directors are those who “in effect, command the directors how to act”.
Control over the company’s affairs may be exercised directly by those who
perform that role (_de facto_ or _de jure_ director) or indirectly by
controlling those who are nominally in charge (shadow director) (_per_
Chesterman J in _Emanuel Management Pty Ltd v Fosters Brewing Group Ltd_
[2003] QSC 205). While section 4(1) of the 2006 Act provides for both these
scenarios, as a practice note, it would be profitable for lawyers to rely on
the definitions as set out in s 4(1) of the 2006 Act, instead of inventive but
indeterminate interpretations of “shadow directors” and “ _de facto_
directors”.

63 With this legal quagmire out of the way, I now turn to the Plaintiff’s
allegation that Peter Lim was a _de facto_ or shadow director of RTC and EH.

The Plaintiff’s claim that Peter Lim was a shadow or _de facto_ director

64 To enumerate all the facts that the Plaintiff has relied on to prove its
claim that Peter Lim was either a shadow or _de facto_ director would add
unnecessary length to this judgment. I thus highlight below the salient facts
relied upon by the Plaintiff instead of reproducing in their entirety the
evidence on this issue:

(a) Peter Lim had admitted under cross-examination that he was present at
formal and informal meetings at which the other Defendants would be present
and where matters in relation to RTC and EH would be discussed. Minutes of
various such meetings disclosed at trial reflected Peter Lim as one of the
attendees. Chan Lay Hoon testified that where Peter Lim was listed as being in
attendance in the minutes of such meetings, it would generally mean that Peter
Lim had been present at and involved in the meetings;

(b) Peter Lim had conceded that in many areas of key decision making in RTC
and EH, the rest of the Defendants would defer to him. During the time of
Peter Lim’s involvement with RTC and EH, appointments of several key
individuals in EH and RTC were made at his behest. On Peter Lim’s own
evidence, these appointments were key management decisions;

(c) Chan Lay Hoon’s evidence was that whatever Peter Lim recommended would be
implemented. For example, Peter Lim procured RTC to change its company
auditors from Thong & Lim to HT Khoo & Co, which was a firm of auditors that
Peter Lim was accustomed to using. Chan Lay Hoon confirmed that all the
directors of RTC were accustomed to taking directions from Peter Lim on many
areas in relation to RTC and EH such as finance, management and operations;

(d) Peter Lim admitted that he had pressed for the membership launch of the
Club to take place in late 1996 because cash flow was needed for RTC and RTC
did as told;

(e) Peter Lim admitted putting in place a system and arranging for Chan Lay
Hoon to administer and process the membership applications. He had further
arranged for the membership operations to be housed at one of his offices at
Circular Road;

(f) Chan Lay Hoon testified that the acceptance of about 19,000 founder
members by the Club was a major decision which required Peter Lim’s consent.
She also mentioned that the payment of the 15% commission to EH per membership
entrance fee was another major decision which required Peter Lim’s consent;

(g) Peter Lim had conceded that he had a “dominant position” in RTC and EH;
and

(h) Third parties had regarded Peter Lim as a director of RTC and even
addressed him as such.

65 From the above, it is plain that Peter Lim was no ordinary “consultant”. He
had played an active and influential role in the major corporate decisions of
RTC and the other directors had often deferred to him. On cross-examination,
Peter Lim revealed:

Q:What you're saying is that throughout, since you became involved in the club
in 1996, all the way to 1998, you were in a dominant position, but in late
1998 your dominant position was very strong? Is that what you're saying?

A:No. It's just increasing level of dominance.

Q:Am I correct to say that what you are telling the court is that as at late
1998, it's very clear that you have a dominant position in RTC and Europa
Holdings?

A:Yes, I've just say that.

Q:Yes?

A:Yeah, late 1998. Yeah.

Q:So as far as you are concerned, no one can dispute that in late 1998
onwards, you had a clear dominant position in RTC, in Europa Holdings?

A:Oh, yes, sir. [note: 7]

66 Peter Lim’s case however is that the rest of the directors did exercise
independent judgment when he made recommendations to them, and if they had
agreed to his suggestions or taken up his advice, it was because this was good
for the company and not because they were borne out of compulsion. But this is
not borne out in Dennis Foo’s evidence in cross-examination:[note: 8]

Q:Fair enough. Do you agree that Peter Lim is "he who must be obeyed" insofar
as company decisions --

A:Yes.

Q:\-- key appointments --

A:Yes.

Q:\-- major decisions of the company are concerned?

A:Yes.

Q:Really, when you agree that he is "he who must be obeyed" in these areas,
when he made such decisions the directors really had to agree, they didn't
really have a choice?

A:I think -- you see, I mean, I understand it then -- and I definitely
understand it now -- that if Peter Lim wants to do something, he don't need me
to concur. He probably will need Lawrence Ang to concur. And I don't think he
even need William Tan to concur. But he is forceful, he's persuasive in his
ways -- I experienced some of it \-- but most of the time he don't even need
to tell me, you know.

But what I'm trying to say here is -- but, not to be obeyed, in your words,
"obeyed", then it may land up in a situation like this. I mean, there was fear
-- I don't know it will land up this way -- which is the worst, I mean, ever
possible scenario. I think there will be consequences, so I really can't
answer this question exactly. Maybe I take a look at it again.

His word must be obeyed. To most extent, yes, and I must qualify it in this
context.

Q:Yes. When he makes a decision, it's really something which the rest of the
directors would follow? It's not a case of him consulting the other directors,
persuading them to agree; it's a case of him saying, "Okay, look, we should do
this", and everyone just agreed.

A:Let me put it this way. We have to ask him, but he don't have to ask us.

Q:Okay.

A:I think that's a more simple way of putting it.

Q:I think that's very apt. So he decides, but if you all want to do anything,
you have to ask him?

A:Yeah, but I think one other person must concur, it's Lawrence Ang. I think.
I believe so, actually, by now.

Q:So Peter Lim exerted enormous influence in the decision-making process of
Europa Holdings and RTC; correct?

A:Yes.

67 Lawrence Ang, William Tan, Dennis Foo and Chan Lay Hoon all agreed that
Peter Lim had a say in the major decisions of RTC and that they had often
deferred to his decisions. When Chan Lay Hoon was cross-examined on the scope
of Peter Lim’s appointment as a consultant, the following transpired:

Mr Ang: |  You say Mr Peter Lim is a consultant; right, Ms Chan?  
---|---  
A: |  Yes.  
Q: |  The scope of his consultancy work, his advice, what areas he gives consulting advice to the company, RTC, must be in his consultancy agreement; right?  
A: |  As I understand, there is no written agreement.  
Q: |  So we'll never know what exactly is his scope of work; correct?  
A: |  I think from the course of working and observation, I have a rough idea.  
Q: |  His scope of work is such that he's able to say that no major decisions in RTC were made without his consent; right?  
A: |  Yes.  
COURT: |  Do you mean that's a consultant's job? A consultant such that "You do nothing without my consent", that's a consultant? That's your definition of "consultant"?  
|  I thought consultants don't do that. Consultants only present, the
shareholders decide. Now this consultant is such that you cannot do anything
without his approval. That's a consultant?  
A: |  Your Honour, I think maybe in this situation there's a little bit of grey area, if I may say, that --  
COURT: |  Grey in what way?  
A: |  He's a consultant, and he also has a prospective 40 per cent interest when the club open. And \-- and as when -- and as when the year go past, and it's draw nearer, nearer to the club opening date, and obviously, I think, his influence will be greater as it goes. [note: 9]  
  
  

68 Based on the objective evidence before me, the inexorable conclusion is
that Peter Lim was highly influential and had been the dominant influence in
many major corporate decisions of RTC. In fact, he had admitted that important
decisions were undertaken by him and this is buttressed by his remark in his
1st affidavit in S 742/2000 (at para 74), that:

… when [William Tan] resigned his directorships, _inter alia_ , of RTC and EH
on 30 September 1998, he wrote to me to tender his resignation… This was a
clear recognition of my dominant position in RTC and EH… I was already
exercising strong influence even before becoming a 40% shareholder. No major
decisions in EH and RTC were made without my consent.

69 On the facts, therefore, it is clear to me that Peter Lim had been a _de
facto_ director of RTC. He was in direct control of the affairs of the
company; and his presence at meetings, both formal and informal, militate
strongly in favour of a finding of _de facto_ directorship. Peter Lim had not
attempted to indirectly control RTC through the rest of the Defendants.
Rather, he had unabashedly exerted direct control over RTC’s corporate
decisions without apology. This was not the job of a consultant. Whilst the
fact that third parties regarded him as a director of RTC is irrelevant to my
analysis, it may be viewed as reinforcing the notion that Peter Lim was indeed
“occupying the position of director of a corporation” (see s 4(1) of 2006
Act), albeit as a “consultant”. Nonetheless, he would be caught by s 4(1) as
the provision makes it clear that the label attached to the controller is
irrelevant. Consequently, Peter Lim as a _de facto_ director of RTC will be
subject to the duties ordinarily imposed on directors.

Analysis of the Plaintiff’s claim

70 I will now deal with the issues as outlined at [33]-[38] above _in
seriatim_.

Acceptance of the 19,000 members

71 To recapitulate, the promotional materials had stated that RTC would
deliver an exclusive club with first class facilities “without peer in terms
of size, facilities and opulence”. The Plaintiff argues that by late 1996 or
early 1997 at the latest, the Defendants and/or each of them knew and/or ought
to have known that the maximum number of initial members for an exclusive
premier club on the site with the intended facilities was about 7,000 members.
Any more would result in serious overcrowding and the Club would cease to be
exclusive or premier. It alleges that the Defendants had connived to mislead
the public as to the Club’s premier and exclusive status and had also
deliberately concealed the true membership figures from its members. This, the
Plaintiff alleges, amounted to the commission of a “fraud” upon the
applicants.

72 In support of the above allegations, the Plaintiff cited three interviews
given by Dennis Foo to the press in November 1996 and April 1997. In the first
two interviews, he had stated that he “ _hoped_ ” to rope in 5,000-6,000
members. As for the last, he had been quoted as stating that the Club had over
4,500 members from the two membership drives when the total membership figure
was already well known to the Defendants. Furthermore, the Club’s March 1997
newsletter (signed off by Dennis Foo) stated that the Club would be taking in
members periodically bearing in mind that there was an optimal membership
level based on the size of the Club’s facilities.

73 It was also highlighted by the Plaintiff that the Defendants had testified
at trial that RTC had been converted into a private exempt company to keep the
membership size of the Club confidential. Even the staff at RTC, the Plaintiff
submitted, were led to believe that the total membership of the Club had been
between 5,000-6,000 members: an internal information fact sheet that had
purportedly been circulated among the RTC staff expressly stated that the
total membership of the Club was approximately 7,000. Referring to discussions
amongst the Defendants in acquiring additional premises or facilities, the
Plaintiff averred that this surely meant that the Defendants knew that the
Club’s facilities could not cope with 19,000 members. All these actions, the
Plaintiff alleges, were inconsistent with the Defendants’ claims that they had
acted honestly and in good faith towards RTC.

74 The Defendants’ collective response was that they had acted in the best
interests of the Club. They asserted that had they taken in 5,000 to 6,000
members at the entrance fee of $28,000, the Club would have been unable to
survive. Though it was conceded that there had been instances of “active
concealment” of the membership figures after the launch, they contended that
this was done after the Defendants became aware of the 19,000 membership size,
not before, as alleged by the Plaintiff.

Were the representations fraudulent and/or in bad faith?

75 Before the representations can even be _argued_ to be fraudulent and/or in
bad faith, it must first be shown that Dennis Foo had knowledge of the number
of members that had been accepted at the material time the various interviews
were conducted. The objective evidence before me was that it was Peter Lim,
Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Tan Buck Chye who were actively involved in the
sorting out of the membership applications and other matters pertaining to the
priority membership launch. Dennis Foo’s role, it appeared, was to be the
“face” of RTC and/or EH which to his credit, he did well. It appeared to me
that he pretty much adopted a hands-off approach with regard to the membership
applications and was solely focused on raising the profile of the Club and
drumming up publicity for it. I doubt that he had kept tabs on the number of
members that were being accepted progressively during the period of the
membership launch in November 1996 as the other Defendants and Tan Buck Chye
were already in charge of the situation. Dennis Foo also testified that when
he spoke to the press in November 1996, he was unaware of Peter Lim’s break-
even figure of 10,000 members. He submitted that his rationale for stating
that RTC hoped to have 5,000 to 6,000 members was based on his own calculation
of what RTC would require to deliver the Club _, ie_ , pay for the Land ($100
million) and construction costs (estimated $70 million), albeit that he had
failed to take the tax liability into account.

76 On a balance of probabilities, I find that Dennis Foo was indeed unaware of
the actual number of members that had been accepted at the material time.
Hence, it cannot be said that his representations had been fraudulent or made
in bad faith. However, taking the Plaintiff’s case at its highest and assuming
that Dennis Foo did have the requisite knowledge during the relevant periods,
my finding would be the same.

77 Indeed, while Dennis Foo’s supposed representations in the press and
newsletter _plausibly_ created an impression that the Club would be taking in
around 5,000 to 6,000 members, it must be noted that in these representations,
RTC did not, whether through the Defendants or Dennis Foo himself, _lie_ to
the public as to the actual membership size. Nor did it represent that it
would take in _only up to_ 5,000 to 6,000 members. It is pertinent to refer to
the actual press interviews that the Plaintiff cited. The first interview
appeared in the Business Times on 15 November 1996. The journalist had simply
written in the second paragraph of the interview that:

Dennis Foo, director of Europa Holdings, said the Raffles Town Club _hopes to
rope in 5,000-6,000 founder and public members_ in its initial membership
drive.

…

… at the end of 1998, another 1,000 memberships will be open to the public at
$60,000 …

78 The second interview was published on 17 November 1996 in the Straits
Times:

Eventually when the club is ready, Mr Foo expects membership to cost $60,000.
Meanwhile teaser ads have gone on television …

Altogether, the club _hopes to have 5,000-6,000 members_ and is targeted at
the new rich, who want a taste of the “lifestyle of the rich and famous.”

79 The Plaintiff argues that these statements above were “highly misleading
and false”, designed to give the impression that the membership size in the
Club would be very limited and that at the price of $28,000 per member,it
would be a great buy. However, in both interviews, Dennis Foo had merely
stated that the Club “hoped” to get 5,000 to 6,000 members. He had not
represented that membership size would be limited to 5,000 to 7,000 members or
that the membership size was in fact only about 5,000 to 7,000 members.
Further, the questions were not reported. The context in which Dennis Foo made
the above remarks is crucial to understanding the motive and reasons for his
remarks. Reading the extracts, one cannot come to the irrefutable conclusion
that Dennis Foo had unequivocally meant in these statements that RTC was
looking to accept a maximum of 5,000 to 7,000 members. In fact, a very
plausible interpretation of his remarks is that RTC had “ _hoped_ ” to attain
such a membership size as 5,000 to 7,000 was the minimum critical mass
required for RTC to cover its costs – this comports with his submission that
this notion of covering costs was operating in his mind when he gave the
interviews (see [75] above).

80 As such, I would be slow to find that, as the Plaintiff has claimed, Dennis
Foo’s statements, made on behalf of the Defendants or otherwise, were
calculated to and did in fact deceive the public. The interviews say little;
further, it has not been proven that as a result of these interviews, members
of the public had been deceived and therefore applied for membership. Indeed,
for an act of misrepresentation to be actionable, it must be shown that it had
induced a party to enter into a contract (see [83] below).

81 I come now to the third interview dated 19-20 April 1997 in the Business
Times which reported that:

Mr Foo says the club now has more than 4,500 members from two membership
drives—the first priced at $28,000 and the second at $40,000. Europa is so
confident of its product that its third membership drive will see another
price hike to $50,000.

82 According to the Plaintiff, this was designed to “perpetuate the misleading
impression that the membership was limited and exclusive” despite the fact
that by this time the 19,000 members had already been accepted. Dennis Foo’s
evidence is that he did not recall granting such an interview, nor did he
recall making such a statement or seeing the facsimile of 25 November 1997 to
RTC (which enclosed the aforesaid interview). I make no finding on this. But
assuming that Dennis Foo was well aware of the acceptance of 19,000 members, I
do not see how it negates the truth of the representation that the “club [now]
has more than 4,500 members”. 19,000 is indeed more than 4,500 and Dennis Foo,
assuming that he knew about the 19,000 members, was not bound to disclose _how
much more_ than 4,500 the actual figure was. While he may have been economical
with the truth, it would be a stretch to decry his statements as being
fraudulent or having been made in bad faith. In any event, those members who
had applied for membership and had been accepted by RTC as members would have
applied for membership before this third interview was published in the
Business Times in April 1997 – further launches for ordinary memberships at
$40,000 that took place in March and July 1997 only saw a further 83
applications being accepted on top of the 18,992 applications that had been
accepted from the priority membership launch. Hence, even if there had been a
misrepresentation in the aforesaid interview, it could not be relied upon by
members who had been accepted before April 1997 and this alleged
misrepresentation would not be actionable. As for members who had applied
after all the three interviews cited above had been published, it has not been
shown that they had relied on Dennis Foo’s statements or that they had been
defrauded.

83 At [20] of _Tan Chin Seng 2003_ , the Court of Appeal cited from p 237 of
_Anson's Law of Contract_ (OUP, 28th Ed, 2002):

An operative misrepresentation consists in a false statement of _existing or
past fact_ made by one party (the "misrepresentor") before or at the time of
making the contract, which is addressed to the other party (the
"misrepresentee") and which _induces the other party to enter into the
contract_. [emphasis added]

The Court of Appeal further observed that (at [21]):

There is also a need to differentiate between actionable representation and
future promise and this is elucidated in Andrew Phang's _Law of Contract
(Second Singapore and Malaysian Edition)_ (1998) as follows at pp 444 to 445:

A representation, as we have seen, relates to some existing fact or some past
event. It implies a _factum_ , not a _faciendum_ , and since it contains no
element of futurity it must be distinguished from a statement of intention. An
affirmation of the truth of a fact is different from a promise to do something
_in futuro_ , and produces different legal consequences. This distinction is
of practical importance. If a person alters his position on the faith of a
representation, the mere fact of its falsehood entitles him to certain
remedies. If, on the other hand, he sues upon what is in truth a promise, he
must show that this promise forms part of a valid contract. The distinction is
well illustrated by _Maddison v Alderson_ [(1883) 8 App Cas 467], where the
plaintiff, who was prevented by the Statute of Frauds from enforcing an oral
promise to devise a house, contended that the promise to make a will in her
favour should be treated as a representation which would operate by way of
estoppel. The contention, however, was dismissed, for:

The doctrine of estoppel by representation is applicable only to
representations as to some state of facts alleged to be at the time actually
in existence, and not to promises _de futuro_ , which, if binding at all, must
be binding as contracts. [see (1883) 8 App Cas 467 at 473].

84 Suffice to say, I do not find that there had been any _promise_ made by
Dennis Foo and/or the Defendants that only 5,000 to 6,000 members would be
accepted by RTC and even if there had been such a promise, it has not been
shown that members had relied on such a promise to their detriment. Neither
has it been shown that such a promise (if it existed) formed part of the
contract between RTC and the members. While it is indeed the case that there
had been a breach of the implied term that RTC would deliver a premier club,
it must be recognised that there was no specific promise to accept only 5,000
to 6,000 members; neither can one conceivably imply into the contract between
RTC and its members that there had been such an implied term. There was
nothing in what Dennis Foo said that was tantamount to a misrepresentation or
a fraudulent statement. People were attracted to the Club because they
believed (and rightly so) that it would be exclusive and premier, not because
they _thought_ it would have 5,000 to 6,000 members. I would thus roundly
reject the Plaintiff’s claim that the Defendants “never had the intention to
fulfil RTC’s promise to the public and/or potential members that RTC would
deliver a premier and exclusive club” and that “alternatively, when the
Defendants caused RTC to accept 18,992 applications as members of the Club,
they did not have the intention to fulfil RTC’s promise that RTC would deliver
a premier and exclusive club.”[note: 10] The Plaintiff’s analysis is parochial
as it is unduly fixated upon the number of members as determining the
exclusivity of the Club.

Was the desire to maximise the number of applications not bona fide?

85 The Plaintiff submits that the Defendants had wanted potential applicants
to believe that they would form part of an exclusive group of up to 7,000
members belonging to an exclusive and premier club so as to maximize the
number of applications for memberships received. First, there is nothing
objectionable in wanting to maximize the number of applications. Most if not
all clubs would be desirous of this. It must be borne in mind that the Club
was, and still is, a proprietary Club, not a member’s Club. As a business, its
objective would be to maximize revenue and profits. In J F Josling and Lionel
Alexander, _Law of Clubs_ (Oyez Longman, 5th Ed, 1984), it is stated (at p
10):

A proprietary club is in essence a business in which an individual or a
partnership of individuals, or a company, provides the facilities and
amenities of a club for the use of persons who are in reality customers, but
who generally pass under the description of members. These members will have
no interest in the club property or income; they stand in a contractual
relationship, not with each other, but with the proprietor, the incidents of
the contract being construed out of the rules which he lays down for them to
observe...

…

A member’s club is quite different from a proprietary club… Such a club does
not, in its ordinary transactions, carry on a business …

86 Secondly, whilst the Defendants plausibly wanted to maximize the number of
applications, they did have a selection process such that not all and sundry
who applied obtained membership. If their sole purpose had been to defraud the
members there would have been no need for such a selection process. They could
have simply accepted all 24,000 applicants as members and gained an additional
$140,000,000 in entrance fees.

87 Thirdly, simply because the Defendants allowed the Plaintiff to accept the
19,000 members did not mean that they had not acted _bona fide_. A small
membership size _per se_ does not denote exclusivity. Conversely, a large
membership size does not mean a club is not exclusive. At trial, it was
revealed that RTC had rejected applicants who were above a certain age because
it was believed that such applicants would have a decreasing earning capacity
in the future. This is in a sense, an instance of exclusivity. Dictionaries
have defined the term to mean admitting only members of a socially restricted
or very carefully selected group. Exclusivity must thus be referable to some
criteria. It cannot be based on membership size alone. It is not a game of
numbers. Hence a club may have few members but that may not mean that it is
exclusive in the ordinary sense of the word – it might just be unpopular.
Conversely, if the membership size of a club were to stand at say 25,000
members comprising of only millionaires from all over the world including
Singapore, does it necessarily mean that it cannot be deemed “exclusive”
simply because the membership size is larger than that of other clubs in
Singapore (be they proprietary in nature or otherwise)? This cannot be so. As
the Court of Appeal observed in _Tan Chin Seng 2003_ (at [38]):

We accept that the 19,000 people whom the respondent admitted as members does
not _per se_ prove a breach. The real question is whether the Club has, by
admitting so many members, ceased to be an "exclusive" or "premier" club,
having regard to the dimensions of the facilities available.

Further, the Court of Appeal remarked (at [50]):

Bearing in mind that we are here concerned with a "premier" club, it is clear
that its facilities are inadequate to cater for the need of 19,000 members
(plus their spouses, families and guests) in three major areas, the food
outlets, the swimming pool and the gym; and probably also the bowling alley.
The test of a premier club must surely be, besides the physical aspect, the
ease with which members can gain access to facilities. While the occasional
wait, such as on festive seasons, is acceptable, it should not be a regular
feature on weekends and public holidays. It is plain logic that where you have
a large number of members, the pressure on facilities will naturally increase,
even though members may not turn up all at the same time or at the same
regular intervals.

88 The Court of Appeal had found in _Tan Chin Seng 2003_ that RTC had breached
an implied term of providing a premier club (see _Tan Chin Seng 2003_ , at
[37]) because of the overcrowding that had occurred, resulting in the limited
access to the facilities and hence a loss of that “premier” feel. One may
argue that the overcrowding had resulted really from a lack of facilities
rather than the acceptance of the 19,000 members and hence the acceptance of
the 19,000 members did not constitute a breach but such reasoning, I
acknowledge, may be quite artificial. Nonetheless, it must be borne in mind
that it was the overcrowding that had led to the loss of a “premier” feel. In
any case, this issue of accepting the 19,000 members had already been disposed
of in _Tan Chin Seng 2003_ and should not be invoked in this suit for the
reasons in the following section.

Number of applications to be accepted was a commercial decision

89 As I have mentioned above, it must be borne in mind that the overcrowding
was the crux of the members’ suit, not the acceptance of the 19,000 members.
Indeed, it is highly doubtful that the applicants had paid for membership on
the premise that the total membership size would be 5,000 to 7,000 members.
Rather, it was the promise of exclusivity and premier status that drew them to
become members of the Club and the inquiry should not be unduly fixated on
figures. What should be the threshold for a Club to, on one hand, maximise the
number of applications and on the other, ensure that it is “exclusive”? There
is no formula for determining which figure would strike the best compromise.
Simply because the decision to accept the 19,000 members later proved to be,
arguably, imprudent (in that there was overcrowding during the initial few
months immediately following the opening of the Club) does not automatically
mean that the Defendants had been fraudulent or negligent.

90 Eventually, determining how many members to accept was a commercial
decision. The Defendants assert that it was in the best interests of the Club
that they took in the 19,000 members and that the Club would not have survived
had it not accepted this number of applications. The Plaintiff highlights that
the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chin Seng 2003_ at [21]) because of the
overcrowding that had occurred, resulting in the limited access to the
facilities and hence a loss of that “premier” feel. One may argue that the
overcrowding had resulted really from a lack of facilities rather than the
acceptance of the 19,000 members and hence the acceptance of the 19,000
members did not constitute a breach but such reasoning, I acknowledge, may be
quite artificial. Nonetheless, it must be borne in mind that it was the
overcrowding that had led to the loss of a “premier” feel. In any case, this
issue of accepting the 19,000 members had already been disposed of in _Tan
Chin Seng 2003_ and should not be invoked in this suit for the reasons in the
following section.

Number of applications to be accepted was a commercial decision

89 As I have mentioned above, it must be borne in mind that the overcrowding
was the crux of the members’ suit, not the acceptance of the 19,000 members.
Indeed, it is highly doubtful that the applicants had paid for membership on
the premise that the total membership size would be 5,000 to 7,000 members.
Rather, it was the promise of exclusivity and premier status that drew them to
become members of the Club and the inquiry should not be unduly fixated on
figures. What should be the threshold for a Club to, on one hand, maximise the
number of applications and on the other, ensure that it is “exclusive”? There
is no formula for determining which figure would strike the best compromise.
Simply because the decision to accept the 19,000 members later proved to be,
arguably, imprudent (in that there was overcrowding during the initial few
months immediately following the opening of the Club) does not automatically
mean that the Defendants had been fraudulent or negligent.

90 Eventually, determining how many members to accept was a commercial
decision. The Defendants assert that it was in the best interests of the Club
that they took in the 19,000 members and that the Club would not have survived
had it not accepted this number of applications. The Plaintiff highlights that
the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chin Seng 2003_ at [21] had rejected this argument
as being “strange” and “astonishing”. However, read in its context, the
Court’s remarks there were in response to the Court’s view that RTC was
attempting to ignore its contractual obligation to provide a premier club and
to maintain it as such. It stated that “if the Club had made a wrong bargain
or calculation, it had only itself to blame and it should not be allowed to
shift its responsibilities”. The passage should not be read as dismissing the
merits of the Defendants’ own belief that the 19,000 members were needed for
the Club to survive.

91 Much has been made of the fact that additional facilities had been
considered (but not, in the end, procured) for the Club. In this regard the
Plaintiff relied on the testimony of Dennis Foo and Peter Lim as well as the
summary projected cash flows (“the projected cash flows”) prepared by Tan Buck
Chye whilst he was still at RTC. [note: 11] In these projected cash flows
which were contained in a document entitled “Summary Project Evaluation”, Tan
Buck Chye had in this section titled “Summary Projected Flows”, prepared
estimates of the inflows and outflows of cash for membership sizes of 6,000,
8,000, 10,000 and 12,000 members respectively. A footnote entry adverted to
“contingency costs” of $10m in the projections for membership sizes of 8,000
upwards. Dennis Foo also testified that he had felt that additional facilities
would have to be procured owing to potential overcrowding and that he had
shared such concerns with the other Defendants before the Club opened. Peter
Lim on the other hand conceded that meetings had taken place in relation to
the possibility of acquiring further facilities, but he had chosen to adopt a
wait-and-see approach. He said he would wait till 3 to 6 months after the Club
had opened before assessing the situation. All these, the Plaintiff contends,
point to the fact that the Defendants were well aware that 7,000 was the
optimum membership size for the given facilities.

92 First, it is not disputed that the projected cash flows had been prepared
by Tan Buck Chye. However, there was no evidence that the Defendants had been
of the view that a membership size of upwards of 8,000 would require
additional facilities to prevent overcrowding, an inference the Plaintiff
appears to have drawn from Tan Buck Chye’s projections. According to the
projected cash flows, 8,000 members were sufficient for RTC to make a profit
of $15.7m. Yet, Peter Lim was of the view that a minimum, critical mass of
10,000 members was required to break even. Lawrence Ang himself was of the
view that the minimum membership size would be 12,000 to 13,000. Lawrence
Ang’s evidence was that Tan Buck Chye had also suggested at their meetings
that 20,000 members would not be a problem for RTC and that Tan Buck Chye
himself had contemplated that the Club would be very crowded in the first
three to six months regardless of the membership intake. In any case, it is
clear to me that there was no consensus amongst the Defendants that (a) they
would take in only 8,000 members; and (b) an intake of 8,000 members and above
would give rise to overcrowding.

93 Second, it was not evident that a concern that there might be overcrowding
had led to a consideration that additional facilities would have to be
procured. The mere words in the footnote of the projected cash flows had
simply stated “contingency for project cost overrun budgeted at S$10m (excl
interest) for membership intake of 8,000 and above”. In fact, in the Summary
Project Evaluation document, Tan Buck Chye had remarked in a section titled
“Scenario Analysis” that an intake of 10,000 to12,000 members would be:[note:
12]

… profitable but a situation to be managed. With the right approach and
strategies, we should reach an eventual maximum membership base of 15,000
which is comparable to Singapore Swimming Club and Guild House and reasonably
proportionate to other Clubs in terms of size.

It would not be possible to market any significant amount of new members at
the official price but eventual membership can still reach 15,000 through the
alternative channels explained under Option A.

“Option A”, I note, does not mention the procurement of additional facilities.
In fact, such additional facilities were only mentioned in a Summary Project
Evaluation document under a section titled “Longer Term Perspectives” in which
Tan Buck Chye suggested that it would be “profitable” to combine the
operations of Raffles Town Club and Europa Country Club and another club “to
capitalise on synergies and critical mass”. This, he proffered, would allow
them to have a base to “build on a super club membership incorporating a JB
golf club cum weekend retreat and a Singapore Marina”. This actually supports
Lawrence Ang’s evidence at trial that additional facilities were considered to
add value to the Club membership rather than to address potential
overcrowding. On the balance of probabilities, I would thus reject the
Plaintiff’s submissions that the projected cash flows evinced the Defendants’
state of mind that the facilities of the Club could accommodate only 7,000
members.

94 According to Moh Siang King, six months after the Club opened, the usage
level had stabilised so that there was no overcrowding and in March 2001 there
was in fact an underutilisation of the Club’s facilities. The Club membership
has now dwindled to 15,700 (at the time of the Defendant’s closing
submissions) and according to Moh Siang King again, RTC experiences an
attrition rate of 300 members per year. She also agreed that the overcrowding
had occurred due to the pent-up demand arising from the 15-month delay in the
opening of the Club. Further, in the first week of the Club’s opening, free
food had been catered for the members and their families and guests. Though
members were invited in tranches to enjoy the complimentary meals, often they
would return the following day for complimentary food. The coffee house had
also sold its food at competitive prices for the first few weeks. There is no
doubt in my mind that this concatenation of circumstances led to the
overcrowding in the first few months of opening. Indeed, the pent-up
anticipation of visiting Singapore’s presumably most premier club meant that
the members in their excitement would jump at the opportunity to visit the
Club’s premises in the first few weeks following its opening. The free flow of
food for members and their guests only boosted the Club’s popularity with its
members as did the competitively priced food from the coffee house.

95 Novelty takes time to wear off and in this instance, it took about 6 months
(as had been envisaged by Lawrence Ang Tan Buck Chye himself) before the usage
rate stabilised by which time there was no more overcrowding. On cross-
examination, Moh Siang King testified as such:[note: 13]

Mr THIO: |  It’s reasonable for the management of the club to look at it after six months and say, “It’s okay, it’s running well, it’s not overcrowded”; fair?  
---|---  
A: |  Yes.  
… |   
Q: |  …there was a very dramatic drop in utilisation from March 2000 to March 2001; correct?  
A: |  I think when it comes to 2001, you can see the drop.  
Q: |  It’s quite a steep drop?  
A: |  Yes.  
  
  

96 In Kala Anandarajah, _Corporate Governance: Practice and Issues_ (Academy
Publishing, 2010) (“ _Corporate Governance_ ”), the author notes at para
06.023 that:

It is a clear principle of law that where a director is required to act _bona
fide_ in the interest of the company, he must act according to what he
considers, not what a court may consider, is in the interest of the company.
In other words, the director is to act in a manner which he thinks is best
suited for the company. This makes commercial sense in that it is the
directors who know the business of the company best, and so should be the ones
to determine in a reasonable manner what is best for the company. The duty is
evidently subjective, in that the court will not consider it broken merely
because in the court’s opinion, the particular exercise was not in the
company’s interest. In the words of the court in _Pergamon Press Ltd v
Maxwell_ [1970] 1 WLR 1167, the court will not take it upon itself to order
that a particular power vested in the directors should be exercised in a
particular way. In _Idamene v Symbion Health_ [[2007] 64 ACSR 680 at [114]]
Lindgren J held that there “is a well-known line of authority to the general
effect that it is the province of directors, not the courts, to identify where
the interest of a company lie, and that the courts do not exercise a
supervisory function over the business judgments of directors.”

97 As a proprietary club, it was in the interests of the Club and hence RTC to
maximize profits as well as to ensure its long term commercial viability.
However when members of the Club were aggrieved that the Club was not as
premier or exclusive as they had expected it to be due to the overcrowding,
their recourse was to sue the proprietor of the Club, _ie_ , RTC, which they
did. That chapter is now closed as far as this court is concerned. RTC’s
defeat in the members’ suit does not translate into the Defendants having
failed in their duty of good faith towards RTC. It is important to distinguish
between the grievances the members had towards RTC and the Defendant’s duties
towards RTC. In accepting the 19,000 members, the Defendants had made a
commercial decision which raked in healthy profits for RTC. Though the wisdom
of this decision may be questioned on hindsight owing to the members’ suit, it
cannot be that directors are automatically in breach of their duties whenever
a commercial decision generates some undesirable results. For that matter, I
do not believe that when the directors accepted the 19,000 members they had
any inkling that the acceptance of that number would later generate a law suit
from the members. Neither was it the case that knowing or realising the
likelihood of that eventuality, the Defendants nevertheless recklessly
proceeded to put RTC at risk of a law suit by proceeding with accepting the
19,000 members. I find that the Plaintiff has not proven on a balance of
probabilities that the decision to take in the 19,000 members, having regard
to the directors’ assessment of all the relevant business factors including
the financial viability and profitability of the business, was not made in
good faith and in the best interests of RTC at the time the decision was made.
As a proprietary Club, what is good for RTC is also necessarily good for all
the directors and shareholders of RTC. Actions taken by directors with a view
to maximising net profits for RTC both in the long run and short run cannot
_prima facie_ be said to be taken in bad faith, even though events may
subsequently show that a different decision should have been taken. The
relevant factors for evaluating whether the directors’ duties towards the
company have been fulfilled at the time the business decisions were made
should not be considered with the full benefit of hindsight.

98 In _Intraco Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd_ [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064 at
[29], the court held that the test for whether a director had acted _bona
fide_ was whether an honest and intelligent man in the position of the
directors, taking an objective view, could have reasonably concluded that the
transactions were in the interests of the company. In that case, the
management decision taken by the directors turned out on hindsight, to be a
poor decision but nonetheless _bona fide_.

99 There is no compelling evidence in this case that the Defendants had taken
an unreasonable position in accepting the 19,000 members. As I have pointed
out earlier, the acceptance of 19,000 members _per se_ should not in and of
itself amount to negligence or a lack of _bona fides_. Through strategic and
savvy planning, it might have been that overcrowding would never have occurred
and RTC would never have been sued. Indeed, there was unrebutted evidence from
Lawrence Ang and William Tan that the Defendants had meetings with Tan Buck
Chye where it was agreed that the Club would be able to handle up to 20,000
members.

100 The $100 million price tag for the land on which the Club was built meant
that the Defendants needed to net a large amount of membership fees. As a
result, the Defendants argue, a large membership was required. However, the
Plaintiff counter argues that RTC could have charged a much higher membership
fee than $28,000 and accepted fewer members instead. This is a superficially
attractive argument. However, there is no market survey adduced by the
Plaintiff to show that on a balance of probabilities, if a higher membership
fee of say $75,000 per member had been set, RTC would have been likely to get
about 7,000 members, thereby netting RTC about the same total membership fee
of $532 million (as with 18,992 members at $28,000 per member). What if RTC
could only garner 3,500 members because the membership fee had been set far
too high at $75,000 per member, and the total membership fees collected
amounted to only $262 million? Obviously, RTC and the Club could well run into
financial difficulties with the high costs incurred for the land at about $100
million and the expensive building costs which increased from $60-70 million
to $100 million. Further, there would be a shortfall of some $262 million in
membership fees which could otherwise have translated into net profit for RTC
and which shortfall on any account would be disastrous for RTC from the
business and profitability angles. The Plaintiff has not shown me any expert
forecast that RTC would still have been able to secure the same $532 million
in total membership fees if membership numbers were to be set at only 7,000
members, which mathematically must mean charging a minimum of $75,857 per
member. One can harbour all sorts of wishes and set the membership fee at
$75,857 and hope to get at least 7,000 members to achieve a collection target
of $532 million in membership fees. But the market may not have delivered the
number of members to accord with RTC’s expectations if the membership fee had
been set at the very high level of $75,857 per member. Evidently, this is one
area involving business decisions, forecasts and risk taking. In such cases,
the Court should be very slow to step into the shoes of the directors and
substitute its own view for the sort of _bona fide_ business decisions that
should have been made in the best interest of RTC at that time.

101 In my view, it is all too easy for the Plaintiff, with the full benefit of
hindsight, to pontificate on what the Defendants should have done. The law is
clear that commercial decisions will not be lightly interfered with by the
court unless the directors had acted unreasonably or not _bona fide_. I do not
think that pricing the membership competitively, presumably in a bid to
attract more people and thereby maximise the possible return from memberships
for the benefit of RTC, reflected adversely on the Defendants. It was in the
nature and purpose of a proprietary club to do so. In fact, with hindsight the
directors had done their sums quite well and made the right decision to set
the membership fee at $28,000 per member. RTC in fact had benefited from their
decision rather handsomely, even after allowing for the compensation of some
$33 million (partly in kind) to the members as a result of the members’ suit,
which I find could not have been in the directors’ contemplation at the time
they made their decision to accept the 19,000 members. Even if it had been in
the directors’ contemplation, and assuming both that they had estimated a
potential law suit damages claim of $50 million and that they had deliberately
taken a decision to net say $200 million more in net profits for a risk of
paying out only $50 million, one still cannot conclude that that decision is
no longer _bona fide_ and cannot on any account in the best interests of RTC
because regard must be had to the fact that the net result is still a huge
gain of $150 million for the company. Sometimes, the directors of a company
may decide that the cost of potential claims should be regarded as part of the
costs of the business itself if the gain in the future is going to far offset
any such cost. Again, it does not follow that such a decision, taken with full
knowledge of all risks but which nevertheless increases the net profit to the
company, must necessarily be a decision that has been made in breach of their
director’s duties to their company, simply because a risk was taken and the
risk materialised. Business decisions all involve risks and the taking of
calculated risks does not translate _per se_ into an automatic breach of a
director’s duties. It is part of business.

Justification for taking on the 19,000 members

102 There is a sound and credible explanation for why the Defendants had
accepted the applications of the19,000 members. Between the acceptance of the
applications and the Club’s opening, Lawrence Ang had believed that there
would be a fall in the numbers. He explained at trial that people may pass
away, fall ill or simply change their minds. Indeed, by the time the Club had
opened, there were around 18,000 members. Lawrence Ang’s projected attrition
rate was somewhere around 10-20% and he gauged that by the end of club’s life
there might only be 10,000 members left. Also, as mentioned earlier (at [95]
above), Lawrence Ang had expected the usage rate to stabilise within 3 to 6
months and the evidence confirmed that there was indeed no problem with
overcrowding after 6 months. The experience with ECCR was that after the
initial period of 3 to 6 months, many promotions had to be conducted to
encourage members to return to ECCR. As such, a critical mass was important.

103 I am inclined to accept Lawrence Ang’s evidence that the Defendants had
contemplated attrition rates at the time they made their decision to accept
the 19,000 members. The fact that huge costs had been incurred in constructing
the Club and had been weighing on their minds was also undeniable.
Undoubtedly, a large amount of membership fees would be required for RTC to
break even. Lawrence Ang had felt that at least 12,000 members were required
to break even and Peter Lim had also thought that 10,000 members were not
enough. I should mention that 340,000 publicity brochures were mailed out to
the public. The Plaintiff argues that this meant that the Defendants never
meant for the Club to be exclusive. I think this argument goes too far. If
anything, the number of brochures mailed out suggests that the Defendants were
unsure of how successful the launch would be and were simply hoping to
increase the probability of people applying for membership.

104 It is clearly outside the purview of the Court’s jurisdiction to determine
whether the Defendants had made a wise commercial decision. I have found that
there was no fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Defendants. The only
inquiry before me then is whether they are nonetheless liable in negligence as
this was the Plaintiff’s alternative claim. Would the reasonable director have
done what the Defendants did, _ie_ , accept these 19,000 applications and
thereby unwittingly expose RTC to litigation and the need to compensate
aggrieved members of the Club?

105 What I have gathered from the evidence presented to me is that while the
Defendants initially did not have a set figure of the number of membership
applications to accept, they were of the view that 10,000 members would be
insufficient. Bearing in mind too that there was an optimal membership base
required to break even and also to avoid overcrowding, 19,000 was a figure
they eventually settled for. They had considered attrition over the next 3 to
6 months and over the long term based on their experience with ECCR. The
Defendants were eager for the Club to work well and, according to Lawrence
Ang, at no time did they discuss the issue of overcrowding. Their discussions
regarding the acquisition of additional facilities were directed towards
adding value to the Club membership and not so much towards addressing the
issue of overcrowding.

106 There is also no evidence to show that it was blatantly clear that the
acceptance of the19,000 members had caused the Club to cease to be exclusive
or premier and that the Defendants were aware of this. The Defendants had
genuinely believed that they were acting in the best interests of RTC and it
appears to me that it never crossed their minds that by accepting the 19,000
members, the initial overcrowding would result in RTC being sued by its
members (indeed, it was because of the Defendants’ internal legal disputes
that had led to the revelation that the 19,000 members had been accepted).
There was no breach of their duties of honesty and good faith in my opinion.
Nor could one say that, on a balance of probabilities, the reasonable man in
the position of the Defendants exercising due care and diligence would not
have done what the Defendants did. After all, acceptance of the 19,000 members
brought in a lot of money for RTC. There was no reason at that point in time
for the Defendants to contemplate litigation. I do not think that the
reasonable man would have thought or foreseen that overcrowding only at the
initial stages immediately following the launch would lead to a law suit
against RTC. I would add that there was no evidence at trial adduced to show
that a certain number of members would be just right for the Club to maintain
its promise of being exclusive and premier.

107 RTC may have failed the Club’s members because it did not manage the
overcrowding problem effectively in the first few months following its
opening; it thus unwittingly reneged on its implied promise to deliver a
premier and exclusive Club. However, this did not ultimately mean that the
Defendants had breached their duties of good faith towards RTC or had acted
dishonestly at the time they decided to take in the 19,000 members.

108 The Plaintiff next avers that the Defendants had committed an offence of
cheating under s 415 of the Penal Code when the latter instructed the Club’s
staff to misrepresent to the members the true membership size of the Club and
when Dennis Foo made certain remarks to the press. Criminal offences must be
proven beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence relied on by the Plaintiff in
this regard did not satisfy me that the Defendants had cheated the applicants.
However, even if the Defendants had cheated the applicants, this did not
translate into the Defendants committing a fraud on RTC, a separate legal
entity.

109 In summary, there is a distinction to be drawn between acting dishonestly
towards the members and acting dishonestly towards RTC. I reject the claim
that there had been a fraud on the applicants, but even if this had indeed
been the case, it cannot be said that RTC had been defrauded in the process. I
find that the Defendants had not breached its duties of honesty and good faith
towards RTC, nor had they been negligent in accepting the 19,000 members.

The management fees

110 The Plaintiff strenuously argued that the Management Agreement was a
“sham” agreement, conceived in mid-1997 as an afterthought. Its case is that
the Defendants realized in 1997 that they were “sitting on” a goldmine.
However, the Plaintiff was unable to recognise the entrance fees as income
until after the Club had opened. Without income, there could be no profits to
speak of and the Defendants would not be able to draw out the funds legally as
dividends since dividends have to be declared out of profits under s 403 of
the Companies Act. As RTC was not a private exempt company at that point of
time, the Defendants would also be unable to take loans from RTC. According to
the Plaintiff, the Defendants thus hatched a plan to siphon out the monies via
a sham Management Agreement.

111 At the outset, I should mention that this argument that the management
fees were an afterthought actually somewhat weakens the vigour of the
Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendants had breached their duties of
honesty, good faith and care towards RTC in accepting the 19,000 members.
Indeed, if the Plaintiff is right to say that the Management agreement was an
_afterthought_ , then the only plausible reason for the Defendants’ maximizing
of the number of applications must have indeed been for RTC’s benefit since at
that point in time, the Defendants ostensibly had no intention to siphon out
any of the monies for their personal benefit. Accepting the 19,000 members
would not be lacking in _bona fides_ since there was no nefarious intention
then. In fact, on the Plaintiff’s own case, the Defendants only realized in
1997 that they were effectively sitting on a gold mine.

Was the Management Agreement a sham?

112 What constitutes a sham agreement? According to Diplock LJ in _Snook v
London and West Riding Investments Ltd_ [1967] 2 QB 786, at 802:

As regards the contention of the plaintiff that the transactions between
himself, Auto Finance and the defendants were a 'sham,' it is, _I think,
necessary to consider what, if any, legal concept is involved in the use of
this popular and pejorative word. I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in
law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the 'sham'
which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the
appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations
different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the
parties intend to create_. But one thing, I think, is clear in legal
principle, morality and the authorities (see _Yorkshire Railway Wagon Co. v.
Maclure_ (1882) 21 Ch D 309, CA and _Stoneleigh Finance Ltd. v. Phillips_
[1965] 2 QB 537), _that for acts or documents to be a 'sham,' with whatever
legal consequences follow from this, all the parties thereto must have a
common intention that the acts or documents are not to create the legal rights
and obligations which they give the appearance of creating_. [emphasis added]

113 RTC argued that the real purpose of the Management Agreement was to siphon
out monies for the Defendants’ personal benefit and that the management fees
paid under the Management Agreement were “disguised dividends”. Alternatively,
it argued that the work done by EH for RTC was _de minimis_ and hence the $78m
paid in remuneration for work done by EH was excessive.

114 The burden of proof in an allegation of a sham agreement is on the party
alleging the sham (_U H G v Director General of Inland Revenue_ [1974] 2 MLJ
33). In the present instance, I am not convinced that the Management Agreement
was designed to give to “third parties or the court an appearance of creating
between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual
legal rights (if any) which the parties intend[ed] to create”. First, the
Management Agreement was entered into exclusively by RTC and EH which had the
same directors and shareholders. It has not been shown that the Defendants
intended the court and/or third parties to be deceived or that the court and
third parties had in fact been so deceived as a result of this Management
Agreement.

115 Second, there is no evidence to show that the Defendants did not intend
for the Management Agreement to regulate the rights and obligations of RTC and
EH. One of the Plaintiff’s main arguments in contending that the Management
Agreement was a sham is that EH had not done any work for RTC or the Club.
Instead, it submits, it was RTC that had paid for all the costs and expenses
of the launch including the advertising, publicity and promotional costs to
third party service providers amounting to around $2.5m. This, according to
the Plaintiff, was certainly contrary to clause 7.5 of the Management
Agreement which provided that EH would pay for all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the marketing and promotional campaign referred to in
clause 5 of the Management Agreement. Consequently, the Management Agreement
was a sham.

116 If the Management Agreement was indeed a sham as the Plaintiff argues,
then it follows logically that the clauses therein were unlikely to be adhered
to since they were merely to give third parties or the court false
“appearances”. However, the mere fact that the clauses were not given effect
does not necessarily import that the Management Agreement was a sham. It could
simply evince a breach of the Management Agreement. The nature of the
Management Agreement is, logically, a prior question to the issue of whether
the clauses were fulfilled or not. Thus, whether the clauses were adhered to
or not is not conclusive of the genuineness (or lack thereof) of the
Management Agreement.

117 Indeed, as I have mentioned earlier (at [114] above), the inquiry is
whether the Defendants had intended to give “third parties or to the court the
appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations
different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the
parties intend to create”. That EH allegedly did not do work for RTC is not
only not proven, even if it had been the case, it involves a leap of logic to
say that the Management Agreement was thus a sham.

118 That the Management Agreement was presumably conceived in mid-1997 but
backdated to June 1996 was another plank in the Plaintiff’s submission that
the Management Agreement was a sham. The Plaintiff cited the case of _John
Holmes v Alfred McAlpine Homes (Yorkshire) Ltd_ [2006] EWHC 110 (“ _John
Holmes_ ”), where the Court held,at [23], that:

… the back-dating of documents as was done in this case is generally wrong. It
is wrong to seek to give an agreement retrospective effect by back-dating it.
If it is agreed that a written agreement should apply to work done before it
is entered into, it should be correctly dated with the date on which it is
signed and expressed to have retrospective effect, i.e. to apply to work done
before its date. Backdating is liable to lead to the suspicion that it was
done in order to mislead third parties, including a court before which the
agreement is to be placed…Backdating is at best due to incompetence or lack of
thought, and at worst due to dishonesty. It should not be done.

I would not regard that court as laying down a general principle that the
backdating of documents is always objectionable. Sometimes in the interests of
commercial expediency, parties to an agreement may backdate it without stating
that it is to have retrospective effect. In _John Holmes_ , a firm of
solicitors had failed to explain to their client that a conditional fee
agreement entered into by them and the said client had been backdated. The
court nonetheless found that the agreement was enforceable as the solicitors’
failure to inform the client that the agreement had been backdated did not
cause prejudice to the said client. Similarly, there is no prejudice suffered
by either EH or RTC by the backdating of the Management Agreement. I would
also highlight Mr Justice Stanley Burnton’s remarks in _John Holmes_ that (at
[22]):

An allegation that the agreement was deliberately backdated in order to
mislead the defendant or its solicitors or the court into believing that it
was entered into the date it bore, in order for example, to give the
impression that the uplift of 25% had been agreed before there was an
admission of liability, _would be a serious allegation of impropriety (indeed
of dishonesty) which, if established, would certainly lead to the
unenforceability of the agreement_. [emphasis added]

Indeed, dishonesty and fraud must be proven, established before a court finds
that the backdating of a document was actuated by dishonest or fraudulent
motives or was pursuant to a dishonest or fraudulent purpose. It is _apropos_
to note at this juncture the observation of Andrew Phang JA in _Chua Kwee Chen
and others (as Westlake Eating House) v Koh Choon Chin_ [2006] 3 SLR(R) 469 at
[39]:

In summary, the standard of proof in civil proceedings where fraud and/or
dishonesty is alleged is the civil standard of proof on a balance of
probabilities. However, where such an allegation is made (as in the present
proceedings), more evidence is required than would be the situation in an
ordinary civil case. Such an inquiry lies, therefore and in the final
analysis, in the sphere of practical application (rather than theoretical
speculation). In this regard, a distinction ought not, in my view, to be drawn
between civil fraud and criminal fraud.

119 Consequently, I would reject the Plaintiff’s submission that the
backdating of the Management Agreement “shows that they were highly conscious
of the need to create the impression that the idea for RTC to pay [management
fees] had been conceived before the Defendants found out, after the successful
membership launch in November 1996, that RTC would receive a windfall in
membership entrance fees.”[note: 14] The backdating is an equivocal fact. It
was equally probable to me that the Management Agreement was truly conceived
in 1996 before the Defendants knew that the launch would be a success and
hence, they endeavoured to attract as many members as they could so that EH
would receive a larger sum of management fees. As shareholders and directors
of EH, they would also have EH’s interests at heart. In any case, I found the
backdating to be consistent with Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s evidence
that the idea to pay EH management fees was conceived in September 1996 and
that there had been a verbal agreement then to pay management fees of between
10% to 20% of the entrance fees to EH. Nothing had then been formalised,
plausibly because the Club’s success was yet unknown.

120 The Plaintiff has pointed out that the first time the matter of the
management fees was mentioned in the minutes of a meeting was a year later
after the alleged oral agreement, _ie_ , in the minutes of a 19 June 1997
meeting where a “marketing commission of 10%” was stated to be made payable to
EH. There is nothing peculiar about this. Till the Defendants were certain of
the quantum and resolved to pay EH the management fees, there would be little
reason for them to minute this idea in September 1996 when it was first
conceived. That the minutes did not refer back to a prior oral agreement
should not be construed adversely against the Defendants who were dealing
amongst themselves, and moreover, doing so informally as directors and
shareholders of both RTC and EH.

121 Further, it was always open to the Defendants to retroactively ink a
Management Agreement between RTC and EH after the work that EH had done for
RTC. Even if there had been no prior arrangement for EH to be paid management
fees, simply because it was later decided that EH would be remunerated for
work done for RTC did not suggest any bad faith on the Defendants’ part.

122 The Plaintiff also contended that the $78m in management fees was used by
the Defendants to procure shareholdings in ABR Holdings, a public-listed
company. It alleges that the Defendants were keen to acquire shares in ABR and
as EH had run out of funds, the Defendants had to find another way to obtain
monies to acquire the ABR shares. Seeing the “cash pile” sitting in RTC from
the membership fees, they decided to divert the monies to EH through the
payment of the “management fees”.[note: 15] The Defendants then drew from
these management fees to EH as advanced dividends for themselves. Thus
according to the Plaintiff, disguised dividends were paid by RTC to the
Defendants via EH as a conduit at a time when RTC had no profits to declare.
This reinforces its claim that the Management Agreement had been a sham.

123 Once again, the Plaintiff is employing backward reasoning. Because it is
convinced that the Management Agreement is a sham, it assumes that any
transaction related to the $78m must be tainted with bad faith. However,
simply because the management fees might have been used to fund the
acquisition of ABR Holdings did not mean that the $78m were not legitimate
management fees, much less prove that the Management Agreement was a sham. How
the management fees were ultimately used does not affect their legitimacy. I
should also add that there was no concrete evidence that the $78m was drawn
specifically for the purpose of funding the ABR shares. The Plaintiff had
relied on Lawrence Ang’s evidence on cross-examination that the plan to
acquire ABR using the management fees paid by RTC to EH as the source of
funding was conceived in end-1997:[note: 16]

Q:\-- Peter Lim planned the whole process of the [ABR] acquisition; is that
correct?

A:Yes, sir.

Q:He told you how to do it, how to get the fund, etcetera?

A:Yeah. Peter Lim, together with Ms Chan Lay Hoon.

Q:They came up with the idea, “Okay, this is what we are going to do to
acquire ABR, and this is how it’s going to be funded”, etcetera; correct?

A:Yes. Yes, sir.

….

Q:So this idea [or] plan to acquire ABR must have been discussed and agreed
sometime in the second half of 1997?

A:Third half, sir.

…

Q:The last quarter?

A:Yes.

Q:As you said, RTC, no problems; the money could come from the $78 million in
commissions paid by RTC; correct?

A:Yes, sir.

124 This only shows that the Defendants had intended to use the management
fees as their source of funding to acquire the ABR shares and nothing more.
For the Plaintiff to contend that the Management Agreement was devised _in
order that_ the Defendants could acquire the ABR shareholdings is a logical
leap.

125 Another string in the Plaintiff’s bow was its claim that the marketing
commission was raised from 10% to 15% without any convincing reason(s) from
the Defendants and this was evidence that they had intended the management
fees to fund the acquisition of the ABR shares. The Plaintiff avers that a 10%
commission would be insufficient to acquire the ABR shareholdings, whilst a
15% commission would suffice. I find this argument to be somewhat contrived
and I am not satisfied that it has been distinctly proven that the Management
Agreement was conceived in order to acquire the shares in ABR.

126 For the reasons stated above I do not think that the Management Agreement
has been proven to be a sham at all. There must be compelling evidence shown
by the Plaintiff that the Management Agreement was intended to defraud third
parties or the court. Drawing the court’s attention to equivocal facts and
inviting it to draw adverse inferences from them cannot be sufficient to
affirm an allegation of fraud.

127 Given that I have found that the Management Agreement was not a sham, the
inquiry can end here. However, I will nonetheless address RTC’s arguments that
EH did no work for RTC. First, as I have pointed out, simply because EH may
not have done work for RTC does not translate into the Management Agreement
being a sham. It may simply be a contractual breach. What the Plaintiff is
effectively doing is reversing the burden of proof in asking the court to draw
such an adverse inference.

128 Secondly, RTC’s expert witnesses themselves had proffered that based on
the work envisaged by the Management Agreement, the quantum of 1% and 3%
commission would be appropriate for EH’s marketing services. However, the
expert witnesses did not value other aspects of services provided by EH, an
issue which I shall return to later.

129 Thirdly, I note that the Management Agreement itself only states the basis
on which the commission is to be paid, _ie_ , that it was to be 15% of the
membership fee. It did not state what exactly the commission would be for.
Clause 7.1.1 simply provides that:

[The Principal shall pay to [EH] fees on the following basis:]

In respect of each Club membership sale concluded by Europa or its appointed
Agents through the introduction of the purchaser by the same and subject to
the acceptance by [RTC], at its sole discretion, of the said purchaser as a
Club member, a commission equivalent to 15% of the prevailing entrance fees,
to be determined by [RTC] from time to time, per accepted Club member …

From the above clause, it appears that the commission payable was premised on
EH’s efforts in recruiting members to the Club. Although it was not expressly
stated as such, it must be implied that the commission was payable for work EH
did in bringing members into the Club. The question is: exactly what work did
EH have to do to obtain this commission? The Plaintiff submits that EH was to
be remunerated _only_ for work done under clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Management
Agreement and even then, it had clearly not carried out its duties under these
clauses.

130 The 15% commission was not referable to any of the clauses pertaining to
the work meant to be done by EH (_ie_ , clauses 3, 4 and 5). I would thus be
slow to impute to the parties that the 15% commission was intended by them to
be for work done by EH for RTC restricted _only_ to those matters as
contemplated by clauses 3, 4 and 5. These clauses provided that:

_3\. CONSULTANCY SERVICES_

[EH] shall review, advise on and make recommendations as to the sales,
marketing and promotional strategy of [RTC] in respect of the Club only and
the Club memberships offered by [RTC].

_4\. MANAGEMENT SERVICES_

4.1 [EH] shall provide the following management services:-

4.1.1 [EH] shall as it deems fit and subject to the approval of [RTC], in its
sales, marketing and promotional efforts, directly appoint any other person,
firm or company, including but not limited to Banking Corporations, as its
sales and marketing agent (“the Agents”) in the Territory, in respect of the
Club memberships offered by the Principal.

…

_5\. SALES AND MARKETING SERVICES_

5.1 [EH] shall provide the following sales and marketing services:-

5.1.1 Formulate, present to [RTC] and carry out an appropriate promotional and
publicity campaign in the Territory in respect of the Club only and the said
Club memberships offered by [RTC], including a suitable press relations
programme, the holding of exhibitions, the preparations, publication and
distribution of brochures, newsletters, sign boards and other promotional
materials and a proposed time-table and budget covering all advertising,
promotional materials and public relations costs and expenses …

131 I am of the view that EH was entitled to be remunerated for work done
apart from those set out in clauses 3, 4 and 5 because it had indeed done such
work. It was EH that had the expertise and relevant know-how in launching
country clubs (as shown in its experience in running ECCR) and RTC would have
to draw on the resources of EH. Moh Siang King testified that between RTC and
EH, it had to be the latter doing the work because at the material time, RTC
was just a shell company. The Defendants testified that the conceptualisation,
planning and execution of the launch of the Club were the efforts of EH. It
was EH (through the Defendants) which had liaised with various third parties
such as printers and designer for the Club’s brochures and publicity materials
and the media for television advertising. EH also had to liaise with various
banks and credit card companies including American Express, DBS and Standard
Chartered Bank regarding the launch of the club as priority banking customers
had been targeted as potential Club members. When many disgruntled banking
customers had their applications rejected, it was EH that had to field these
complaints. Tele-marketers were also employed as part of the membership
launch, and training had to be provided to these tele-marketers. EH paid these
tele-marketers salaries on behalf of RTC and was subsequently reimbursed for
these expenses. EH was also responsible for mailing out 340,000 publicity
brochures and the processing the 20,000 odd membership applications received
in 1996. It had also made available its ECCR membership database for RTC to
recruit members from.

132 Crucially, it was not disputed that EH had a strong market reputation and
branding for its chain of Europa pubs and entertainment outlets. As far as the
Defendants were concerned it seems, the Club was perceived to be an EH
project: after all, it was EH that first bid for the land on which the Club
stands. Newspaper articles would also mention EH in connection with the Club
and not RTC. Guy Guillemard, an accounting expert witness for the Plaintiff,
agreed that the Europa name was “publicly associated” with the Club[note: 17]
and that it “helped a lot” that the Club was associated with the “well-known
Singapore brand [EH]”.[note: 18] He also agreed on cross-examination that
based on documentary evidence presented to him EH had certainly done work:

Q:Based on the tax correspondence, then, and from the documents that you have
seen, would you agree that [EH ] did carry out some work? Let’s leave the
value of that work aside. Do you agree that they carried out work?

A:[EH] carried out work for the project?

Q:Yes.

A:How would you define “work”? The marketing work?

Q:Absolutely. It appears so. Because it’s not particularly documented—I think
you will agree—it’s hard to determine whether people who came from Europa were
then on the payroll of RTC when they did the work, or whether they were
sitting in Europa’s offices at Europa’s expense doing the work, or a bit of
both. There simply isn’t a trail of information that I’ve seen about who was
providing what services from where and under what hat.

Q:My question was this, and maybe you might want to explain this: based on the
documents you have seen, can we agree that [EH] did carry out work in respect
of the launch?

A:I am sure.

Q:The launch attracted 24,000 applications; are you aware of that?

A:Yes. And 19,000 were accepted, I think.

Q:By that standard, in terms of attracting interest the launch was extremely
successful; would you agree?

A:Defined in those terms, it was. [note: 19]

I am of the view that looking at the aggregate of the work and effort expended
by EH, it had indeed satisfied clauses 3, 4 and 5. However, even if EH had not
done such work, it was beyond peradventure that it had other contributions
which it could be remunerated for. As I have mentioned above, clause 7 does
not state that the 15% commission is referable to and only referable to
clauses 3, 4 and 5. It was open to EH to either subsume other forms of work
done by EH for RTC’s benefit under clauses 3, 4 and 5 or for EH to regard the
15% commission in clause 7 to be referable also to work outside the scope of
clauses 3, 4 and 5. Indeed, clauses 3, 4 and 5 in all probability were not
meant to set out the minutiae of all the work the Defendants envisaged EH to
do for RTC – after all, the shareholders and directors of both EH and RTC were
the Defendants themselves and in all likelihood they did not expect the
Management Agreement to set out in detail the entire gamut of work EH was
contemplated to perform. This mentality is evinced in Lawrence Ang’s evidence
that a lawyer had not been hired to draft the Management Agreement because
after all RTC and Europa were the “same” and there was thus “no need to so
particular, spend more money employ outside lawyer to do the comprehensive,
very detailed agreement”.[note: 20]

133 This brings me to my next point. I have mentioned earlier that expert
witnesses had valued EH’s work for RTC at 1% and 3%. However, these experts
did not value the other less tangible aspects of EH’s contributions towards
RTC. For instance, Lawrence Ang confirmed that it was EH’s idea to bid for the
land. A $7 million deposit or 10%, whichever was higher, was to be paid by EH
as deposit when they won the bid. When Tan Buck Chye won the bid for the land
at $100m, EH needed to get a $60 million loan from HL Bank. The guarantors for
the loan were Dennis Foo, Tan Buck Chye, Lawrence Ang, Teriya and William Tan.
I accepted Lawrence Ang’s evidence that RTC was set up by EH as special
purpose vehicle to hold URA land. Thus, RTC was simply a shell company with no
assets, no expertise, no staff nor branding. EH’s brand name and the goodwill
it had was instrumental to the RTC project.

134 In rejoinder, RTC contended that the “Europa” brand name was not leveraged
upon to sell the Club memberships nor did the “Europa” brand name appear
anywhere in the promotional brochure. While this may be so, it does not mean
that EH was not instrumental in boosting the confidence of the banks and other
third parties whom they dealt with. I accepted the evidence that the banks
were willing to extend the $60 million to EH because of its reputation. If
RTC, a shell company then, had applied for such a huge loan, it might have
been more difficult to secure such a generous amount.

135 Hence, even if the “Europa” brand name was not leveraged upon to market
the memberships, it was clearly pivotal in the formation of the Club. Without
EH’s brand name and goodwill and the access to ECCR’s membership base from
which RTC could draw upon for the recruitment of members for the Club, one can
safely say that the Club would not even have existed. It was in my view open
to the Defendants to factor in such intangible work in determining the amount
of commission or whether it was even payable because the Management Agreement
never set out precisely the ambit of work the commission would be paid for and
EH, in any case, had clearly performed some work and services for RTC pursuant
to the Management Agreement.

136 Was the quantum of commission excessive? Lawrence Ang’s evidence was that
EH was in the practice of collecting management fees from its subsidiaries.
10% to 20% commission was apparently within the range of percentage commission
collected from EH’s other subsidiaries. Besides, as commercial men, the
Defendants were better placed than the court to decide what should be the
valuation of all the services rendered by EH to RTC. As I have iterated, the
Defendants were not constrained by clauses 3, 4 and 5 in arriving at the 15%
commission rate. It was merely assumed by the Plaintiff that such commission
was to be only for the work done as set out in these clauses. Realistically
speaking however, the work done by EH went over and beyond those set out in
the said clauses. Further, interpreting the clauses widely, it could be said
that EH had indeed done the work envisaged in these clauses. I note too that
it was Lawrence Ang’s evidence that the term “management fees” was used
loosely to include all types of help EH rendered to its subsidiaries.

137 To belabour the point, the court is not as well placed as commercial men
such as the Defendants to ascertain what would be the appropriate amount of
remuneration for all of the work done and services provided by EH. I find that
the Management Agreement has not been proven to be a sham. EH had indeed
adhered to the Management Agreement. Even though RTC pointed out that most of
the marketing work had been outsourced to third parties, I am of the view that
overall, judging from the aggregate of the work done by EH, it had done work
both pursuant to the relevant clauses in the Management Agreement and beyond
it. The work done by EH in launching the Club vis-à-vis RTC is difficult to
quantify with exactitude but I find that 15% marketing commission is not an
extortionate sum in the circumstances. Though RTC’s experts valued EH’s work
at 1% and 3%, they had not taken into consideration the other aspects of the
work done for and services provided to RTC by EH as conceded by them. It must
be noted that EH cannot reasonably be expected to provide free work and
services to RTC simply because such work and services do not fall within the
description set out in clauses 3, 4 and 5. The Defendants as directors of EH
also have to ensure that EH is fairly remunerated for all the work and
services EH has done for RTC, and as far as I am aware, this was the only
written contract between EH and RTC under which RTC had made payments to EH.
As such, I would not accord much weight to their evidence that only 1% or 3%
commission was warranted and would defer to the 15% commission (resulting in a
$78m payment to EH) as decided upon by the Defendants.

138 As I have found that the management fees were legitimate expenses, I am
not persuaded that they were disguised dividends paid in breach of s 403 of
the Companies Act.

Director’s remuneration, consultancy fees and purported expenses

139 I turn next to the issue of whether the Defendants had acted in breach of
their duties in using RTC’s funds to pay themselves disproportionate amounts
in directors’ remuneration, consultancy fees and purported expenses.

Private accounts

140 It was revealed in court that the Defendants had maintained a set of
private accounts for which they were accountable to each other. The
Plaintiff’s case is that the Defendants systematically drew monies from RTC
for themselves through these private accounts by making payments under the
private accounts which were not for the purposes of RTC or for its benefit or
interests. Thus, the Plaintiff claims that the directors’ salaries, Peter
Lim’s consultancy fees and expenses charged under the Defendants’ respective
private accounts but paid by RTC were not genuine payments. Instead, according
to the Plaintiff, all these payments were withdrawals of monies by the
Defendants and were disguised dividends paid in contravention of s 403 of the
Companies Act. As a result, the Defendants should be held liable to account
for all the monies paid out under the private accounts.

141 Lawrence Ang and William Tan never denied that they had such a system of
private accounts. They accepted that the private accounts were a mechanism to
ensure parity between the Defendants in terms of the shareholder benefits that
they received from RTC. According to Lawrence Ang and William Tan, the monies
parked under the private accounts were at all times properly authorised,
acknowledged and approved by all the then shareholders and directors of RTC.
In any event, those monies parked under the private accounts were in respect
of expenses connected to RTC, and not entirely for the Defendants’ personal
benefit.

142 Peter Lim, too, knew about the system of private accounts. There is more
than ample evidence to suggest that it was Chan Lay Hoon, Peter Lim’s “trusted
lieutenant” (borrowing the epithet used by the Plaintiff) who moderated the
private accounts to ensure that the drawings on these accounts were
proportionate to the Defendants’ respective beneficial shareholdings in RTC.
On cross-examination, Chan Lay Hoon admitted that the director concerned must
authorise the placing of any item of expense on that particular director’s
private account. Peter Lim was also present at meetings where the private
accounts were discussed. RTC’s records show that he had made several expense
claims which were parked under his private account.

143 In contrast, Dennis Foo claimed not to have any knowledge of such private
accounts. In my judgment, the evidence however suggests that he knew of such
private accounts and knew of the way they operated and of his entitlement
under that system. It was common ground between the Plaintiff, Lawrence Ang
and William Tan that the system of private accounts in RTC was identical to
the system of private accounts employed in the running of EH. Peter Lim, too,
acknowledged that the private accounts had existed since 1993 in EH to ensure
that shareholders drew monies in accordance with their respective
shareholdings. On cross-examination, Dennis Foo’s testimony on the private
accounts seemed to evolve and thus raised doubts as to his credibility on this
issue. He started out by saying that the private accounts in EH and those in
RTC were different. He then added that in respect of RTC’s private accounts,
the Defendants were supposed to reimburse the Plaintiff for the sums parked
thereunder. Subsequently, he stated that sometimes the Defendants were not
required to reimburse RTC, and he then admitted that he had never reimbursed
RTC for sums parked under his private account.

144 For instance, when he was confronted on his written instruction to Chan
Lay Hoon to park expenses concerning the President’s Star Charity under his
private account, he claimed to have been “puzzled” when he saw the written
instruction, then explained that what he meant by that instruction was that
RTC would pay those expenses first but he would reimburse the company. Yet, he
also admitted to not having reimbursed the company at all. He later qualified
that the private account “in [his] mind” was an account that was “apart from
the operating account of the company” and had “to do with either shareholders
or directors” and that that was the practice since the Defendants had
collaborated in EH.

145 To my mind, there was no doubt as to the existence of the private accounts
operating between the Defendants _inter se_. Dennis Foo did know about the
system of private accounts but he did not wish to give trenchant answers for
fear of being implicated in the event that the system of private accounts is
found to have been instituted in breach of their fiduciary duties to the
Plaintiff. In any case, he did give some indication while on the stand that
the private account had something to do with “either shareholders or
directors”. Thus, I did not find that his answers indicated a complete lack of
knowledge and consent to the system of private accounts, nor did his evidence
negate my finding that there was such a system put in place. The real issue is
whether the Defendants are liable to the Plaintiff to account for all the sums
that were parked under the private accounts.

146 The Plaintiff seems to suggest that there were two categories of monies
parked under the private accounts: (a) salaries paid to Lawrence Ang, William
Tan and Dennis and Peter Lim’s consultancy fees; and (b) expenses claimed by
and paid to the Defendants which were not genuine expenses incurred by RTC. In
my view, the expenses claimed by the Defendants under their private accounts
should be differentiated into legitimate payments for expenses incurred on
behalf of or for the benefit of RTC, and payments which had nothing to do with
the RTC.

Directors’ remuneration and consultancy fees

147 In its Closing Submissions, the Plaintiff sought the following sums of
money paid out as salaries or directors’ fees but charged under the private
accounts:[note: 21]

Year  |  Lawrence Ang |  William Tan |  Dennis Foo  
---|---|---|---  
1997 |  $ 4.3m  |  $680,000 |  $680,000  
|  $35,200 (CPF) |  $24,000 (CPF) |  $24,000 (CPF)  
1998 |  $600,000  |  $300,000 |  $360,000  
|  $14,400 (CPF) |  $12,000 (CPF) |  $14,400 (CPF)  
1999 |  NIL  
2000 |  $90,000 |  NIL |  NIL  
Total |  **_$5,039,600_** |  **_$1,016,000_** |  **_$1,078,400_**  
  
  

The Plaintiff seeks a further sum of $5.04m from Peter Lim in respect of
consultancy fees and incentive fees.[note: 22]

148 The Plaintiff alleges that these amounts paid to the Defendants and parked
under the private accounts were not payments for the Defendants’ services to
the company. The Defendants maintain that the payments of remuneration to them
were genuine because they did in fact do work for RTC for which they were
entitled to remuneration. Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo submitted
that they were entitled to remuneration for their assumption of directors’
duties and responsibilities. Peter Lim testified that he was entitled to his
consultancy fees as these were payment for the consultancy services he had
provided to RTC in respect of corporate direction and strategy.

149 It is established law that the mere holding of the office of director, in
itself, does not entitle a director to remuneration: _Heap Huat Rubber
Company_ ([44]  _supra_), at [44]. Thus, the company’s articles of association
usually provide that directors are entitled to some form of remuneration and
any remuneration received by a director must be in accordance with the
articles of association. The courts have generally been slow to interfere with
the quantum of remuneration for directors as this is a commercial decision
best left to be worked out under the relevant provisions in the company’s
articles of association.

150 In _Gower and Davies’ Principles of Modern Company Law_ (Sweet & Maxwell,
8th Ed, 2008), the learned author observed at para 14-14, that:

The courts have been unwilling to scrutinise directors’ remuneration decisions
on grounds of excess or waste, refusing even to prescribe that pay must be set
by reference to market rates, provided the decision on remuneration is a
genuine one and not an attempt, for example, to make distributions to
shareholders/directors where there are no distributable profits. This is
probably a wise decision on the part of the courts, which might otherwise find
themselves saddled with developing a general policy about the remuneration of
directors in large companies.

In a case involving impugned remuneration to husband-and-wife director-
shareholders in a closely held company, _Re Halt Garage (1964) Ltd_ [1982] 3
All ER 1016 (“ _Halt Garage_ ”), Oliver J stated at 1039:

[A]ssuming that the sum is bona fide voted to be paid as remuneration, it
seems to me that the amount, whether it be mean or generous, must be a matter
of management for the company to determine in accordance with its constitution
which expressly authorises payment for directors’ services. Shareholders are
required to be honest but … there is no requirement that they must be wise and
it is not for the court to manage the company.

151 The directors’ remuneration was paid pursuant to resolutions of RTC that
were properly passed from 1997 to 2000. This was in accordance with cl 76(A)
of RTC’s articles of association which read as follows:

The remuneration of the Directors shall from time to time be determined by the
Company in General Meeting. The Directors shall also be paid such travelling
hotel and other expenses as may reasonably be incurred by them in the
execution of their duties including any such expenses incurred in connection
with their attendance at Meetings of the Directors. If by arrangement with the
other Directors any Director shall perform or render any special duties or
services outside his ordinary duties as a Director, the Directors may pay him
special remuneration, in addition to his ordinary remuneration, and such
special remuneration may be by way of salary, commission, participation in
profits or otherwise as may be arranged.

In _Heap Huat Rubber_ , the Court of Appeal dealt with an identical
remuneration clause in the articles of association and explained that (at
[50]):

[A]s a general rule, ordinary remuneration would include directors’ fees and
salaries that are paid to a director in respect of his office. Such payments
are to be determined by the company in general meeting. In turn, special
remuneration constitutes payments made to a director in respect of “special
duties or services outside his ordinary duties as a director”. Such a
situation might arise, for example, where a director who is also a qualified
lawyer assists the company in his capacity as a lawyer; the remuneration he
receives in respect of his professional legal services would be special
remuneration.

152 Clause 76(A) provides for both ordinary and special remuneration for RTC’s
directors. The shareholders of RTC had passed resolutions which approved
ordinary remuneration for the directors. The board of directors had also
agreed on the quantum of remuneration which was reasonable given the work that
had been done by each of the Defendants. This latter type of remuneration
could be classified as “special remuneration”. As the only shareholders and
directors of RTC at all material times, the Defendants had acted in accordance
with its articles of association in reaching agreements on the quantum of
remuneration—whether as ordinary or special remuneration or an amalgamation of
both—for themselves as directors of RTC. I note that Margaret Tung herself
signed the resolution approving directors’ remuneration for 2000 after she
became a shareholder in the Plaintiff. I therefore find that the directors’
remuneration paid out by RTC to the Defendants was open, transparent and
overboard at all times.

153 In its closing submissions, the Plaintiff states that it is absolutely
clear from the evidence that the salaries paid by RTC which are parked under
the private accounts are not actually payments for their services as directors
and thus seeks to claim back those salaries or directors’ fees which were
charged under the private accounts. I do not accept this contention. The
Plaintiff alleged that out of the total amount paid out to each of the
Defendants as “salary”, only the sum described as “actual” was attributable to
their remuneration as directors whereas the sum recorded as “excess to pte
[_ie_ , private] account” was not. However, to illustrate that submission, the
Plaintiff referred to EH salary records which did provide clear delineation
between “actual” and “excess to pte account” components of the salary taken
each month by the Defendants. The salary records of RTC, from which the
Plaintiff derived the sums specifically claimed from the Defendants (at [147]
above) did not provide such clear demarcation between “actual” entitlement and
any “excess” sums. In fact, it is not even absolutely clear that the salary
records exhibited by the Plaintiff to justify the sums specifically claimed as
remuneration in “excess” of what the Defendants were entitled to actually
reflected sums of money which were parked under the private accounts.

154 Since the process by which the Defendants’ remuneration for their work as
directors was approved was transparent, aboveboard and in line with the
procedure provided for in cl 76(A), the quantum of their remuneration is not a
corporate decision that I am minded to disturb on the ground that it was
excessive. There was work done by the Defendants that would warrant the
payment of the directors’ remuneration. This was not a case in which payments
were made to directors of a company in the absence of _any work_ or oversight
on the part of the directors.

155 In their capacity as directors, Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo
had exercised oversight and had ultimate responsibility for the business of
RTC. I find that they had indeed put in the effort and hard work in all areas
of the Plaintiff’s affairs such as overseeing the construction and renovation
of the Club, the marketing of membership and the launch of the Club, as well
as procuring financing for the Plaintiff’s business activities.

156 Peter Lim, whether in his capacity as consultant or _de facto_ director,
had definitely tried to contribute to substantial tax and interest savings for
the Plaintiff by instituting the deferred accounting policy. Amongst other
things, he also advised on corporate governance, assisted in appointing
independent directors and arranged for loan facilities. Thus, I cannot accept
the Plaintiff’s claim that Peter Lim’s consultancy fee was a sham. Whether the
sum of money paid to Peter Lim is seen as consultancy fee or director’s
remuneration, it cannot be gainsaid that he had contributed substantially to
the initial success of RTC’s business.

157 Thus, I find that since all the shareholders of RTC had assented properly
to the Defendants’ remuneration and all the Defendants had contributed in
numerous ways to its business, the decision to pay them remuneration was a
genuine one. The Plaintiff is not entitled to the remuneration paid under the
private accounts to the Defendants for their work as directors simply on the
basis that these sums may have been paid out under the private accounts. The
Defendants had not acted in breach of their duties, either fiduciary or
statutory, to RTC in approving such remuneration for their services to RTC as
directors. It would be unreasonable to hold otherwise as that would deprive
the Defendants of any recognition or acknowledgement of their contributions to
RTC.

Expenses connected to the Plaintiff

158 Apart from the Defendants’ remuneration, the Plaintiff also seeks to claim
back monies paid out to the Defendants under the private accounts as expenses
claimed from it because they were not genuine expenses incurred by, on behalf
of, or for the benefit of RTC.

159 The Defendants maintained their stand that like their remuneration, the
monies paid under the private accounts as expenses claimed from RTC were at
all times properly authorised, acknowledged and approved by all the then
shareholders and directors of RTC and there was no harm caused to RTC. In any
event, the Defendants submit, the monies parked under the private accounts
were not entirely for the Defendants’ personal benefit, but were for RTC’s
benefit.

160 Admittedly, I found this to be one of the more difficult aspects of this
case. At face value, it would seem as though the Defendants were merely using
RTC as a corporate vehicle to satisfy their own avarice. The picture that the
Plaintiff paints is that of the Defendants’ blithely stripping of the company
of its assets and funds, without contributing any effort toward its success.
But taking an objective view of the Defendants’ dealings with and within the
company, I find that this was not so.

161 It is trite law that the Defendants, as directors, owe a duty as
fiduciaries to the company to act honestly and in the best interests of the
company. The first question I asked myself was, “Whose interests are the
company’s interests?” In _Walter Woon on Company Law_ (Tan Cheng Han SC, gen
ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Rev Ed, 2009) (“ _Walter Woon_ ”), the learned
authors write at para 8.23:

A company is not a monolith consisting of bland interchangeable digits.
Rather, it is an entity with many stakeholders. The interests of these
stakeholders, while to some degree are aligned, are often at variance between
themselves. There are the members, whose personal interests are not subsumed
within the corporate structure. There are employees, whose interests are tied
up with the prosperity of the company. Then there are the creditors of the
company, who generally can look only to the company for the payment of the
sums due to them.

162 Certainly, one of the tests used when considering the validity of a
commercial transaction is whether the transaction benefited the company as a
commercial entity. Thus, when a decision is made to plough profits back into
the company rather than pay them out as dividends or bonuses, it reflects a
decision to prefer the interests of the company as a commercial entity over
the interests of the shareholders and employees as individuals. It does not
mean, however, that this is the only possible interest that a company might
have.

163 In a capitalist environment which encourages entrepreneurship such as
ours, the Court should not view every transaction which does not positively
result in profitable returns to the company as a commercial entity with
suspicion. Thus, the learned authors of _Walter Woon_ recognised at para 8.25
that the “collective interests of the members of the company can also be
equated with the interests of the company.” In _Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas
Ltd_ [1951] 1 Ch 286 at 291, Evershed MR held (in a unanimous judgment of the
Court of Appeal) that:

In the first place, I think it is now plain that "bona fide for the benefit of
the company as a whole" means not two things but one thing. It means that the
shareholder must proceed upon what, in his honest opinion, is for the benefit
of the company as a whole. The second thing is that _the phrase, "the company
as a whole", does not (at any rate in such a case as the present) mean the
company as a commercial entity, distinct from the corporators: it means the
corporators as a general body_. That is to say, the case may be taken of an
individual hypothetical member and it may be asked whether what is proposed
is, in the honest opinion of those who voted in its favour, for that person's
benefit. [emphasis added]

164 It was never in dispute that RTC was solvent at all material times. It is
when a company is insolvent that the interests of its creditors become the
dominant factor in what constitutes the benefit of the company as a whole: _W
&P Piling Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Chew Yin What_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 218 at
[73]. Thus, the Plaintiff’s interests here should be equated with the
interests of its shareholders since the Plaintiff has neither shown that the
company was at all near becoming insolvent, nor that there are other creditors
in the picture whose interests have to be protected in the event that the
company becomes insolvent.

165 In _Re Lee, Behrens & Co Ltd_ [1932] 2 Ch 46 at 51, Eve J held that
company funds can only be spent for “purposes reasonably incidental to the
carrying on of the company’s business” and that:

[T]he validity of such grants is to be tested, as is shown in all the
authorities, by the answers to three pertinent questions: (i.) Is the
transaction reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the company's
business? (ii.) Is it a bona fide transaction? and (iii.) Is it done for the
benefit and to promote the prosperity of the company?

166 The impugned expenses have to be considered with these principles in mind.

(1) From Peter Lim

167 In all, the Plaintiff seeks to claim back $665,478.93 in expenses charged
under Peter Lim’s private account. This amount was arrived at by deducting his
consultancy fees of $5,040,000 from the total amount charged to his private
account, $5,705,478.93.[note: 23] It includes expenses that Peter Lim had
claimed from RTC such as donations to the Old Rafflesians’ Association and the
Community Chest, his personal bodyguards’ salaries, bonuses and mobile phone
charges and payments to third parties like Pan Intel Investigations and
Compuworks Pte Ltd (“Compuworks”).

168 Expenses such as mobile phone charges are innocuous items which are
commonly charged to companies as employees’ or directors’ benefits.

169 According to Peter Lim, the payments made to Pan Intel Investigations and
Compuworks were legitimate expenses incurred for their services rendered to
RTC. Pan Intel Investigation was engaged to conduct a security audit at the
Club’s construction site in September 1997. It provided surveillance services
to RTC at the Club worksite by monitoring work site activities to ensure that
the contractors were working overnight in order to prevent further delays in
the construction of the Club facilities. As RTC’s main IT contractor,
Compuworks was consulted in relation to software for the “Birthday Cakes”
project (involving a software system to track complimentary Swensen’s birthday
cakes delivered to members on their birthdays before the Club opened), to
evaluate the membership card system and provide computer maintenance. Even
though Peter Lim’s nephew was a shareholder of Compuworks, this was made known
to all the shareholders. Since these third parties provided valuable services
to RTC, Peter Lim is not liable for these expenses incurred, even though they
were paid under his private account.

170 RTC had sought tax deductions for donations made in its name to the
Community Chest and the Old Rafflesians’ Association. The latter donation was
a contribution towards the Raffles Institution Monument which was unveiled at
a high profile event attended by Lawrence Ang and Chan Lay Hoon. On behalf of
RTC, Lawrence Ang received a token of appreciation from the Old Rafflesians’
Association for the donation. This served to raise the profile of the
Plaintiff in the eyes of the public. Thus, I find that these expenses were
incurred for the benefit of RTC, and not for Peter Lim’s personal benefit to
the exclusion of RTC.

171 As for the salaries and bonuses paid to staff brought into RTC by Peter
Lim, the Plaintiff used these bonuses as illustrations of how additional
bonuses were charged to his private account but, inexplicably, did not
particularise these bonuses or salaries in Schedule 3D to the Statement of
Claim (Amendment No 3) and these are not included in the $665,478.93 worth of
expenses claimed under Peter Lim’s private account. As these expenses have not
been pleaded, the Plaintiff is not entitled to claim them back.

172 Therefore, the Plaintiff is not entitled to claim back any of the expenses
that Peter Lim had charged to his private account as he had not acted in
breach of his fiduciary duties in so charging those expenses.

(2) From Lawrence Ang and William Tan

173 The Plaintiff seeks to claim back $1,286,546.31 and $71,499.14 worth of
expenses charged under Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s private accounts
respectively. The following expenses were highlighted in the Plaintiff’s
closing submissions:

(a)

Expenses for the trip to Los Angeles and Disneyland taken by Lawrence Ang’s
sister;[note: 24]

(b)

Travelling expenses for Lawrence Ang’s father-in-law;[note: 25]

(c)

Medical fees for Ng Hoy Loy;[note: 26]

(d)

Medical fees for Ang Lian Seng;[note: 27]

(e)

Payments made to Consultant Regional Pte Ltd (“Consultant Regional”);[note:
28]

(e)

William Tan’s mother’s salary;[note: 29] and

(f)

Victor Chua’s MBA course fees.[note: 30]

174 Some of the expenses can be considered to be employees’ benefits. These
include the medical fees of Ng Hoy Loy and Ang Lian Seng, and even Victor
Chua’s MBA course fees. With regard to the MBA course fees, the evidence shows
that Lawrence Ang agreed to have them parked under William Tan’s private
account and not charged directly to the company’s account. This did not mean,
however, that Victor Chua’s fees cannot be reasonably incidental to the
business of RTC. In acting in the best interests of the company, it is
reasonable for directors to also consider the interests of the employees of
the company. It is arguable that with an MBA, Victor Chua might be able to be
of even greater value as an employee to the company.

175 The payments to Consultant Regional seem to have formed the bulk of the
impugned expenses claimed under Lawrence Ang’s private account. On cross-
examination, Moh Siang King stated that if “Consultant Regional does the work,
and send the invoice to Raffles Town Club, then, of course Raffles Town Club
has to pay for it”.[note: 31] The Plaintiff does not provide direct evidence
to show that Consultant Regional did no work for RTC. Instead, it makes the
following observations:

(a)

Lawrence Ang’s evidence that Consultant Regional gave advice in relation to
construction was inconsistent with the invoices that described the work as
clerical assistance;

(b)

The shareholders of Consultant Regional who were full-time employees of RTC
were being paid salaries by RTC as well;

(c)

RTC continued to pay fees to Consultant Regional after the Club had opened and
the fees increased; and

(d)

The last invoice issued by Consultant Regional was in August 2000 when
Lawrence Ang’s quarrel with Peter Lim started.

176 To my mind, these observations provided scant evidence for the contention
that Consultant Regional had done no work for RTC. Lawrence Ang’s inconsistent
evidence does not negate the work that Consultant Regional had possibly done
for RTC. In representations to IRAS made by the Plaintiff under Margaret Tung
and Lin Jian Wei’s direction, it was clearly stated that Consultant Regional
had provided services in relation to the processing of members’ applications,
monthly payments, generating of monthly statements of accounts and related
matters. If shareholders of Consultant Regional were also employees of RTC, it
is not surprising that they were being paid salaries by RTC at the same time
that payments were being made to Consultant Regional. That RTC continued to
pay fees to Consultant Regional after the Club had opened and the fees
increased indicated to me that more work was perhaps being done after the Club
had opened. If Consultant Regional was generating monthly statements of
accounts and rendering other services for RTC, it would not be surprising at
all that the operation of the Club would result in more work for Consultant
Regional to do, since a higher volume of operational activity would be
expected. The last observation regarding the correlation between cessation of
payments to Consultant Regional and the purported quarrel between Peter Lim
and Lawrence Ang has little probative value, being merely speculative at best.
I therefore uphold the validity of the payments to Consultant Regional.

177 Even though William Tan’s mother was employed to open envelopes, she was
paid $4,000 a month. William Tan admitted that he had asked RTC to give his
mother a bit more salary as charity from his side. Since his mother did
perform some work for RTC, the amount that the company decides to pay her is
not a matter for this court to decide. William Tan’s admission to “charity”
does not mean that he has acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to the
Plaintiff.

178 I shall address other impugned expenses such as the travelling expenses of
Lawrence Ang’s relatives below.

(3) From Dennis Foo

179 In its Statement of Claim in Schedule 3C, the Plaintiff particularised
$46,078.10 worth of expenses charged to Dennis Foo’s private account which it
seeks to claim back from him. Yet, in its closing submissions, it submits that
Dennis Foo did not know and never agreed to the charging of personal expenses
to the private accounts and uses this submission to show that the true nature
of the private accounts was that the Defendants would be “ultimately
responsible” for expenses under the private accounts which are not for RTC’s
purposes or interests.[note: 32] In the same closing submissions, the
Plaintiff did not give the same detailed treatment to the expenses claimed
under Dennis Foo’s private account as it did with the expenses claimed under
the other Defendants’ private accounts. It is unclear whether all this means
that the Plaintiff is submitting that Dennis Foo has admitted to his liability
to reimburse the Plaintiff for all the expenses charged under his private
account, or alternatively, that the Plaintiff is not pursuing Dennis Foo for
the expenses charged to his private account.

180 Of the expenses particularised in Schedule 3C, $30,000 relates to
donations to charitable causes such as Community Chest, Breast Cancer
Foundation, Singapore Red Cross Charity Dinner and Presidents’ Star Charity
Night. The other expenses are for entertainment such as a banquet at RTC. I
accept Dennis Foo’s explanation that these were all for the Plaintiff’s
benefit. Such charitable donations attract tax deductions for the benefit of
RTC. According to Dennis Foo, the banquet served to raise the profile of RTC
amongst the guests at the banquet who were from the diplomatic corp. Thus,
even if it is still the Plaintiff’s case that Dennis Foo should be liable for
the expenses claimed under his private account, despite his purported lack of
knowledge of and agreement to the workings of the private accounts, I find
that the Plaintiff is not entitled to claim back the expenses claimed under
his private account as they were incurred largely for the benefit and
interests of RTC.

Expenses not directly connected to the Plaintiff

181 Having dealt with most of the impugned expenses and found that they were
in fact reasonably incidental to the business of RTC, I now consider the
expenses that cannot be considered so directly connected to the Plaintiff.
These would be for smaller items such as the holiday expenses for Lawrence
Ang’s sister and father-in-law, and perhaps, for William Tan’s mother’s
salary.

182 To the extent that these expenses are not reasonably incidental to the
business of RTC, the Defendants can be said to have acted in breach of their
duty to act in the best interests of the company. However, I find that the
Defendants, acting in their capacity as shareholders of the company and
collectively embodying the interests of the company, had authorised and
ratified the charging of these expenses to the company via the private
accounts.

183 Even if there was no proper written shareholders’ resolution on the
ratification or authorisation of such expenses, if all the shareholders with
the right to attend and vote at a general meeting had assented to this matter
which a general meeting of the company could carry into effect, the assent was
as binding as a resolution in a general meeting: see _Re Duomatic Ltd_ [1969]
2 Ch 365, at 373.

184 In _Tokuhon (Pte) Ltd v Seow Kang Hong and others_ [2003] 4 SLR(R) 414,
the appellant company had instituted an action against two of its former
directors (“Mr and Mrs Seow”) for breaches of directors’ duties. The appellant
, the sole distributor of a brand of plasters from Japan, had three groups of
shareholders. Mr and Mrs Seow formed one such group. The shareholders did not
have a cordial working relationship and Mrs Seow sent letters to one Michael
Chien (who was responsible for the awarding of the distributorship) conveying
her intention to withdraw from the appellant and mentioning numerous conflicts
among the directors. All her letters were copied to the other directors.
Michael Chien subsequently terminated the distributorship. The Court of Appeal
held (at [38]) that under “ordinary circumstances”, what Mrs Seow did in
communicating with Michael Chien would constitute a breach of her fiduciary
duties as a director. However, by their previous similar conduct of divulging
confidential information to Michael Chien, the other directors and
shareholders “demonstrated that each of the partners regarded such conduct as
being fair game and acceptable”. In the view of the Court of Appeal (at
[40]—[41]):

40 … It must be emphasised that the three directors represented the interests
of all the shareholders of [the appellant]. None of the directors, and thus
the three partners, viewed that there was a separate independent interest of
the company. In their capacities as shareholders, the directors were advancing
the interest of their own families and were talking freely to [Michael] Chien.
That was the norm set by the shareholders of the company, though not minuted
as such in the minutes of the company. The shareholder-partners had impliedly
accepted such conduct.

41 It is in the light of these very exceptional circumstances that we hold,
and thus concur with the trial judge, that in communicating with Chien, Mrs
Seow was not acting out of turn and was not in breach of any duty.

185 In _Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and
Petrochemical Services Ltd and Others_ [1983] Ch 258, the English Court of
Appeal was concerned with an application for leave by a Liberian company (“the
Liberian plaintiff”) to bring an action against its English agent for breaches
of the agent company’s duty of care under the agency agreement in connection
with the information and advice it had supplied to the Liberian plaintiff. It
also sought to claim against the shareholders of the Liberian plaintiff (which
were American, French and Japanese oil companies who had nominated directors
of the Liberian plaintiff). The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the
Liberian plaintiff existed for its shareholders’ benefit and provided they
acted _intra vires_ and in good faith, the shareholders could manage its
affairs as they chose while it was solvent. Lawton LJ reasoned, at 269, that:

… [W]hen the oil companies acting together required the plaintiff’s directors
to make decisions or approve what had already been done, what they did or
approved _became the plaintiff’s acts and were binding on it_ … When approving
whatever their nominee directors had done, the oil companies were not, as the
plaintiff submitted, relinquishing any causes of action which they plaintiff
might have had against its directors. When the oil companies, as shareholders,
approved what the plaintiff’s directors had done there was no cause of action
because at that time there was no damage. _What the oil companies were doing
was adopting the directors’ acts and as shareholders, in agreement with each
other, making those acts the plaintiff’s acts_.

It follows, so it seems to me, that the plaintiff cannot now complain about
what in law were its own acts.

[emphasis added]

The other judgment in the majority was delivered by Dillon LJ who stated, at
288:

An individual trader who is solvent is free to make stupid, but honest
commercial decisions in the conduct of his own business. He owes no duty of
care to future creditors. The same applies to a partnership of individuals.

A company, as it seems to me, likewise owes no duty of care to future
creditors. _The directors indeed stand in a fiduciary relationship to the
company, as they are appointed to manage the affairs of the company and they
owe fiduciary duties to the company though not to the creditors, present or
future, or to individual shareholders_. …

The shareholders, however, owe no such duty to the company. _Indeed, so long
as the company is solvent the shareholders are in substance the company_.

[emphasis added]

186 As I have found that all the Defendants had agreed to the system of
private accounts with full knowledge of how it was supposed to work, I find
that the charging of the impugned expenses to their private accounts for
squaring off later was conduct which they had, as shareholders, viewed as
“fair game and acceptable” (see [184] above). As the Defendants were the only
shareholders of RTC, they collectively represented the interests of the
company and the system of private accounts was a convenient way for them to
advance their own interests by ensuring parity among the shareholders and
minimising conflict due to disagreements as to quantum of expenses to be
claimed. As RTC was solvent at all times when the Defendants charged expenses
to their private accounts, the Defendants were “in substance the company” and
in adopting the acts of charging expenses to their private accounts in
agreement with one another as shareholders, they had made those acts the
Plaintiff’s acts.

187 Thus, the Plaintiff cannot now complain that the expenses charged were
charged in breach of their duties to RTC. As a result, the Plaintiff’s claim
in respect of the directors’ remuneration and expenses must fail.

Disguised dividends

188 The Plaintiff contends that the private accounts were the means through
which the Defendants disguised the dividends paid out to themselves as
shareholders at times when the Plaintiff had no profits to pay dividends out
of. According to the Plaintiff, they were acting in breach of s 403 of the
Companies Act which provides:

Dividends payable from profits only

403.—(1) No dividend shall be payable to the share-holders of any company
except out of profits.

…

(5) In this section, “dividend” includes bonus and payment by way of bonus.

Under s 403(2), it is an offence for any director to pay, or permit to be
paid, any dividend in contravention of this section.

189 As the Club only opened in early 2000, RTC could not be treated under
accounting standards as having “earned” the entrance fees as income as it had
not started providing its members with club facilities. The Plaintiff submits
that since it could not have declared the entrance fees received as income in
the years 1997 through 1999, the items charged under the private accounts were
another way for the Defendants to draw cash out of RTC as disguised dividends
in contravention of s 403.

190 The Plaintiff relies on three cases in particular to justify its position
that the Defendants have in fact paid out dividends to themselves “dressed up”
as directors’ remuneration or expenses claimed from the company or management
fees. I find, however, that the facts of those cases are far removed from the
factual matrix that I am faced with in this case and the principles expounded
in those cases can be used to justify my judgment that there has been no
payment of “disguised” dividends by the Defendants on the present facts.

191 The first case, _Halt Garage_ , involved a liquidator claiming to recover
remuneration from the two director-shareholders of a wound-up company on
ground of misfeasance. The question in that case was whether the drawings of
remuneration by the husband-and-wife sole director-shareholders of the company
in liquidation were genuine. Oliver J held that the husband’s drawings were
genuine awards of remuneration but the wife’s drawings were in excess of what
would have been a reasonable award of remuneration for holding office as a
director and that amounted to a disguised payment of dividends in recognition
of her co-proprietorship of the business and was _ultra vires_ the company.
Oliver J noted that (at 1041):

It was known from, at the latest, December 1967 onwards, that [the wife] could
_never_ return to render any services in the actual conduct of the company’s
business, and she was _never_ thereafter called on, _nor was she ever
expected, to fulfil any function save that of being a director and carrying
out such minimal formal acts as the holding of that office entailed_. … She
was incurably ill and living at a distance of several hundred miles from the
company’s place of business. Yet in each of the years 1968-69 and 1969-70 she
received a sum of some £1,500 and in the year 1970-71 something over £500.
[emphasis added]

It was with those considerations in mind that Oliver J held that the sums paid
to her were so out of proportion to any possible value attributable to her
holding of office that the court is entitled to treat them as not being
genuine payments of remuneration at all but as dressed-up dividends out of
capital. On the present facts, having benefited immensely from the Defendants’
industry in the launch and running of the Club, it cannot lie in the
Plaintiff’s mouth that the Defendants’ level of contribution to the company
was as low as that of the wife in _Halt Garage_ who was not rendering any
services in the actual conduct of the company’s business during the periods
for which payments to her as director’s remuneration were impugned.

192 In _Halt Garage_ , after going through the authorities, Oliver J came to
the conclusion (at 1043) that:

[W]here payments are made under the authority of a general meeting acting
pursuant to an express power, the matter falls to be tested by reference to
the _genuineness and honesty_ of the transaction rather than by reference to
_some abstract standard of benefit_. I do not, however, think that bona fides
(in the sense of absence of fraudulent intention) and genuineness are
necessarily the same thing. … _The real question is, were these payments
genuinely director’s remuneration? If your intention is to make a gift out of
the capital of the company, you do not alter the nature of that by giving it
another label and calling it remuneration_. [emphasis added]

I find that the Defendants, acting as directors, did not act with the
intention to make a gift out of the capital of the company. As regards their
directors’ remuneration proper, I agree with Oliver J’s judgment that if a
director genuinely receives the money as a reward for his directorship, the
question whether the payment is beneficial to the company or not cannot alter
the capacity in which he receives it: _Halt Garage_ , at 1038. Since there is
no presumption that directors’ remuneration is only payable out of divisible
profits, if the sum is bona fide voted to be paid as remuneration, the amount,
whether it is “mean or generous” must be a matter of management for the
company to determine in accordance with its constitution which expressly
authorises payment for directors’ services: _Halt Garage_ , at 1039. I find
that the exercise by the Defendants in their capacity as shareholders of the
power to pay remuneration to themselves for their services as directors was a
genuine one as the payments were not wholly unreasonable or wholly
unjustifiable with reference to the services they had rendered to RTC.
Similarly, the management fees paid pursuant to the Management Agreement were
genuine payments and not gifts out of capital.

193 In order to have a clearer idea of the type of transactions that the
courts have classified as disguised payment of dividends, one need only turn
to the other two cases referred to me by the Plaintiff. In _Ridge Securities
Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners_ [1964] 1 WLR 479 (“ _Ridge Securities_ ”),
the plaintiff had acquired the shares and debentures of other companies and
obtained payments of “interest” considerably greater than the principal sums
advanced. Pennycuick J held that the payments on the debentures, though
expressed to be “interest”, were not in fact interest but represented
gratuitous dispositions of those companies’ assets otherwise than in
furtherance of their objects and were therefore _ultra vires_. In his
judgment, he remarked (at 495):

Indeed, the terms of each debenture indicate on the face of it that the so-
called “interest” represented in fact a gratuitous disposition of an enormous
sum by the company concerned in favour of [the plaintiff]. On these facts and
in the absence of any further material, it seems to me to follow that it was
not within the powers of the company to enter into the covenant or to make the
payment. A company can only lawfully deal with its assets in furtherance of
its objects. The corporators may take assets out of the company by way of
dividend, or, with leave of the court, by way of reduction of capital, or in a
winding up. They may, of course, acquire them for full consideration. They
cannot take assets out of the company by way of voluntary disposition, however
described, and, if they attempt to do so, the disposition is ultra vires the
company.

In _Ridge Securities_ , it was clear that the “interest” purportedly paid was
not at all connected to the debentures because the sums paid as interest were
considerably greater than the principal loan secured by the debentures and
were payable within a short time interval (_eg_ , a few days) after the loan
was advanced. In that sense, the debentures were a “sham” because the
plaintiff never had the intention for the debentures to act as security for
the loan; rather, it was obvious that the plaintiff had every intention to
strip those companies of assets. This is distinct from the Defendants’ actions
in this case: they had every intention for the company to prosper, not to
systematically strip it of its assets. In any event, every single item of
expense claimed was properly recorded for squaring off amongst the
shareholders. Further, in my judgment, most of the expenses claimed under the
private accounts were reasonably incidental to the business of RTC and were
incurred for its interests and benefits. This is unlike the “interest” that
was paid out in _Ridge Securities_ , charged at a rate that was totally
unconnected to the principal loan, and could not be conceivably related to the
business of the borrower-companies.

194 In _Aveling Barford Ltd v Perion Ltd and others_ [1989] BCLC 626, the
company in question had an accumulated deficit on its profit and loss account
of nearly £18m and was “plainly not in a position to make any distributions to
shareholders” (per Hoffmann J, at 628). The company sold a piece of property
to the defendant for £350,000 even though the property was valued at £650,000
by an independent valuer and at £1.15m by the mortgagee which partially
financed the purchase. Within a year the defendant sold the property for more
than £1.5m. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were controlled by one Dr Lee
who had full knowledge of the various transactions, including the valuations
of the property. Looking objectively at the substance of the impugned
transaction, Hoffmann J found, at 632, that:

[T]he sale to [the defendant company] was not a genuine exercise of the
company’s power under its memorandum to sell its assets. It was a sale at a
gross undervalue for the purpose of enabling a profit to be realised by an
entity controlled and put forward by its sole beneficial shareholder. This was
as much a dressed-up distribution as the payment of excessive interest in
_Ridge Securities_ or excessive remuneration in _Halt Garage_. The company had
at the time no distributable reserves and the sale was therefore ultra vires
and incapable of validation by the approval or ratification of the
shareholder.

On the present facts, even though technically from an accounting perspective,
RTC had no “profit” to pay dividends out of, it did not have an accumulated
deficit and could be said to have been in a financial position to pay
dividends as the value of its assets far exceeded its liabilities and expenses
at the material times. The Plaintiff has also not given any solid evidence
that the impugned transactions were worth much less than the amounts it had
paid out for those transactions.

195 To my mind, these cases indicate that there is a rather high threshold to
be crossed before the courts will view transactions as disguised attempts to
distribute dividends. One has to take an objective view of the overall
picture. Generally, commercial decisions are best left to the management of
the company. If the payments out had little or no connection with the objects
of the company or even the purported purpose of the transactions for which
those payments were made, then the courts would find reason to suspect that
the payments were not reasonable or justifiable and were not made in the best
interests of the company. As I have explained above, I find that the
directors’ remuneration were reasonably paid for their services as directors
to RTC and the expenses charged under the private accounts were largely
reasonably incidental to the business of RTC. The expenses that the Plaintiff
seek to impugn were thus not disguised attempts to strip the company of its
assets or capital. The Defendants had no good reason to seek that result to
the detriment of RTC. At all times, the company was a going concern and they
had every intention to keep it as such in order to profit from its business in
the long run. Therefore, I find that the Defendants had not acted in breach of
s 403.

196 In closing this section of the judgment, I note with approval Oliver J’s
observations in _Halt Garage_ at 1033:

… [C]ounsel for the liquidator has not been able to point to any reported case
in which the [_Lee, Behrens & Co_] principle has been applied to the
determination and payment of directors’ remuneration by a company in general
meeting while the company is a going concern, and I was at first rather
startled by his submissions, which appeared to me to have surprising and very
far-reaching consequences. _If it is really the case that such a payment is
ultra vires unless it be, whether viewed subjectively or objectively, for the
benefit of the company and to promote its prosperity as a corporate entity,
then it must logically be ultra vires from whatever funds the payment is made
and whatever be the company’s financial position. But it is a commonplace in
private family companies, where there are substantial profits available for
distribution by way of dividend, for the shareholder directors to distribute
those profits by way of directors’ remuneration rather than by way of
dividend_ , _because the latter course has certain fiscal disadvantages_. But
such a distribution may, and frequently does, bear very little relation to the
true market value of the services rendered by the directors and if one is to
look at it from the point of view of the benefit of the company as a corporate
entity, then it is wholly unjustifiable, because it deprives the company of
funds which might otherwise be used for expansion or investment or contingency
reserves.

Yet, unless it is to be said that the _Lee, Behrens & Co_ test is to be
applied also even to a unanimous exercise of the power of the company in
general meeting to distribute profit by way of dividend (which I should hardly
have thought was arguable) it is very difficult to see why the payment of
directors’ remuneration, on whatever scale the company in general meeting
chooses, out of funds which could perfectly well be distributed by way of
dividend, should be open to attack merely because the shareholders, in their
own interests, choose to attach to it the label of directors’ remuneration. …
_Is it then to be said that subsequently, perhaps years later, the company, by
its liquidator or possibly at the instance of a purchaser of the shares, can
come along and demand back profits paid out as remuneration with the active
assent and concurrence of all the shareholders at the time because their
payment was ultra vires?_

[emphasis added]

The Defendants, as directors, had in my view, acted honestly and with full
authorisation from the general body of shareholders of RTC. Thus, they had not
acted in breach of their fiduciary and statutory duties to the Plaintiff. The
payments as directors’ remuneration or as expenses claimed were not _ultra
vires_ and the company cannot, at the instance of the subsequent purchasers of
its shares, demand back profits paid out with active assent and concurrence of
all the shareholders at the time.

The RTCI loan

197 RTCI (see [38 above) is an investment vehicle set up by the Defendants. It
is a wholly-owned subsidiary company of the Plaintiff. It was incorporated in
the British Virgin Islands and its shareholders and directors are Lawrence
Ang, William Tan and Dennis Foo. The evidence revealed that between February
and April 1997, the Plaintiff made loans totalling $33m to RTCI. The $33m that
was withdrawn in 4 tranches to RTCI were sent by RTCI to Kestel Capital
Partners (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, Abadale Investments Ltd and Kestrel Securities
Sdn Bhd between March and May 1997. It is undisputed that the principal sum of
$33m has been fully returned to the Plaintiff. In fact, after the Plaintiff
was converted into a private exempt company on 5 November 1997, Lawrence Ang,
William Tan and Dennis Foo took over $12.9m of the principal sum as directors’
loan on 30 November 1997. The Plaintiff claims that by their actions, the
Defendants have contravened s 162(4) of the Companies Act and have breached
their fiduciary duties by causing RTC to contravene s 162(1) of the Companies
Act. Thus, the Plaintiff claims that the Defendants are liable to account for
the interest they earned from the $33m and which they caused to be transferred
out of RTC; alternatively, an account should be undertaken to find out where
and how the $33m was applied as the fruits of the $33m belong in trust to the
Plaintiff, having been applied by the Defendants in breach of their fiduciary
duties.

Sections 162 and 163 of the Companies Act

198 The relevant portions of s 162 provide as follows:

**Loans to directors**

**162**. —(1) A company (other than an exempt private company) shall not make
a loan to a director of the company or of a company which by virtue of section
6 is deemed to be related to that company…

...

(4) Where a company contravenes this section any director who authorises the
making of any loan, the entering into of any guarantee or the providing of any
security contrary to this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be
liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding 2 years.

This section prohibits the making of loans by a company to a _director_ of the
company or of a related company. In this case, the loan of $33m was made by
the Plaintiff to RTCI. Since RTCI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Plaintiff, under s 6(_b_) of the Companies Act, the two companies are deemed
to be related to each other. _Walter Woon_ at para 7.122 notes that:

To avoid the possibility of a company’s directors circumventing s 162 by the
simple expedient of making loans to a company which they control, s 163
prohibits the making of loans to certain companies or the giving of guarantees
or security in respect of such loans.

Thus, even though the loan was made from one company to another company, as
opposed to a loan from one company to a _director_ , s 163 would prohibit the
making of such an _inter-company_ loan if the directors of the lending company
are interested in 20% or more of the total number of shares in the borrowing
company:

**Prohibition of loans to persons connected with directors of lending
company**

**163**. —(1) Subject to this section, it shall not be lawful for a company
(other than an exempt private company) —

(a) to make a loan to another company; or

(b) to enter into any guarantee or provide any security in connection with a
loan made to another company by a person other than the first-mentioned
company,

if a director or directors of the first-mentioned company is or together are
interested in 20% or more of the total number of equity shares in the other
company (excluding treasury shares).

199 In this case, the directors of the Plaintiff, the lending company, have an
interest in more than 20% of the shares in RTCI, within the meaning of s 7(4A)
of the Companies Act which states:

**Interests in shares**

**7**. —(1) The following subsections have effect for the purposes of Division
4 of Part IV and sections 163, 164 and 165.

…

(4A) Where a body corporate has, or is by the provisions of this section
(apart from this subsection) deemed to have, an interest in a share and —

(a) a person is;

(b) the associates of a person are; or

(c) a person and his associates are,

entitled to exercise or control the exercise of not less than 20% of the votes
attached to the voting shares in the body corporate, that person shall be
deemed to have an interest in that share.

The Plaintiff (a “body corporate”) owns 100% of RTCI shares. The Defendants
collectively owned 100% of the Plaintiff and were therefore “entitled to
exercise or control the exercise of” more than 20% of the voting shares in
RTC. Under s 7(4A) they are deemed to have had more than 20% interest in RTCI.

200 However, s 163(4) carves out an exception to the s 163(1) prohibition:

(4) This section shall _not_ apply —

(a) to anything done by a company _where the other company (whether that
company is incorporated in Singapore or otherwise) is its subsidiary_ or
holding company or a subsidiary of its holding company; …

[emphasis added]

Therefore, on a plain reading of s 163(4), since RTCI is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of RTC, s 163(1) does not apply to a loan made by the Plaintiff to
RTCI. On this basis, I find that RTC has not contravened s 162 by making the
$33m loan to RTCI. It therefore follows that the Defendants have not breached
their fiduciary duties since they have not caused RTC to contravene s 162.

Authorisation by members of RTC

201 At trial, Lawrence Ang candidly admitted that the $33m was invested for
the Defendants’ personal benefit and not RTC’s. Although this was not
specifically pleaded by the Plaintiff, to my mind, this seemed like an
admission that the Defendants had acted in breach of the rule that a director
may not retain a profit made by reason and in the course of his fiduciary
relationship with the company. In _Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver_ [1967] 2
AC 134 (“ _Regal (Hastings)_ ”), the House of Lords held that the defendant
directors were liable to account for the profit they had made on the sale of
shares that they had subscribed to in a subsidiary company incorporated for
the purpose of acquiring two cinema leases. The suit in that case was brought
by subsequent purchasers of the plaintiff company which the defendants were
directors of, alleging breach of fiduciary duty as the opportunity to make the
profit from the sale had come to them in their capacity as fiduciaries of the
company.

202 The rule against the making of “secret profit” by a director of a company
is subject to the proviso that if such profit or benefit is disclosed by the
director to the members of the company and approved by them, he will not be
held liable to account for that profit. In _Regal (Hastings)_ , Lord Russell
of Killowen suggested, at 150, that:

[The defendants] could, had they wished, have protected themselves by a
resolution (either antecedent or subsequent) of the Regal shareholders in
general meeting. In default of such approval, the liability to account must
remain.

On the present facts, I accept the Defendants’ submission that they, as the
shareholders and directors of RTC had authorised the loan to RTCI and were all
fully aware of the profits from the investment of the $33m loaned to RTCI.
There was some dispute over who had initiated the idea of making the loan to
RTCI for the purpose of investments but that dispute over whether it was Peter
Lim’s or Lawrence Ang’s brainchild was irrelevant for the purposes of my
decision. Dennis Foo on the other hand submits that the loan was handled by
Peter Lim, Chan Lay Hoon and Lawrence Ang and he had no idea as to what was
happening. All he knew apparently was that the loan to RTCI was for investment
purposes and he had left it to Peter Lim _et al_ to prepare the documents. I
find that his knowledge that the loan to RTCI was for investment purposes and
his acquiescence to that loan was sufficient for the purpose of “protecting”
the directors from liability for breach of fiduciary duties. At all times, the
members of the company had knowledge of the loan and that the loan was
intended for investment purposes. When the first tranche of the loan was made
in February 1997, the then shareholders of the Plaintiff, Tan Buck Chye and
Teriya had full knowledge of the loan and authorised it. By the time the
investments yielded profits, the Defendants as the only shareholders of the
Plaintiff had full knowledge of the profits. Even though there was no
resolution at a general meeting specifically authorising the distribution of
such profits to the Defendants as directors, since all the shareholders with
the right to attend and vote at a general meeting had assented to the profits,
that assent was as binding as a resolution in general meeting: _Re Duomatic
Ltd_ at 373.

203 I therefore find that the Defendants had not acted in breach of their
fiduciary duties to the company with regards to the RTCI loan and the profits
they gained from investment of that principal sum.

The Third Party claims and other claims

Lawrence Ang and William v Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei

204 I now turn to the third party proceedings by Lawrence Ang and William Tan
against Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei (the 1st and 2nd third parties
respectively) where it was alleged, _inter alia_ , that -

(a) Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had breached cl 7 of the “Agreement in
respect of the Sale and Purchase of Shares in Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd” (“RTC
S&PA”) dated 6 June 2001;

(b) Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had breached Recital (F) and cl 4.3 of a
deed (“the Deed”) dated 18 February 2002. According to Lawrence Ang and
William Tan, both clauses discharge them from their entire obligations and
liabilities under several agreements relating to RTC and the RTC shares (the
“Discharged Agreements”). This meant that Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had
waived their rights under the Discharged Agreements;

(c) Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had acted in bad faith and/or
unconscionably in causing, directing and/or assisting RTC to commence the
present suit;

(d) Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had conspired with each other and/or
together with RTC with the sole or predominant intention or by unlawful means
to cause injury, loss or damage to Lawrence Ang and William Tan by commencing
the present suit against them; and

(e) By bringing the present suit, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei were using
RTC to unjustly enrich themselves.

205 Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei made a submission of no case to answer. It
is also pertinent to note that as the only directors and shareholders of RTC,
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei chose not to give evidence on behalf of RTC in
the main action.

Clause 7 of the RTC S&PA

206 Clause 7 of the RTC S&PA provides as follows:

7\. _NO REPRESENTATIONS/UNDERTAKING_

(A) The Purchasers hereby irrevocably acknowledge and agree with the Vendors
that (save as provided In Clause 6 above):-

(i) no representations, warranties or undertakings are made as to the Company
and/or the Sale Shares and all and any such representations, warranties and
undertakings (whether express or implied) are hereby excluded by the Vendors;
and

(ii) notwithstanding anything contained In this Agreement, in no circumstances
shall any of the Vendors be liable to any of the Purchasers as a result of or
in connection with this Agreement (whether in contract, tort (including
negligence or breach of statutory duty) or otherwise howsoever, and whatever
the cause thereof) for any loss of profits, business, contracts, revenues, or
anticipated savings, or for any special, indirect or consequential damage of
any nature whatsoever.

The operation of this Clause shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

(B) Without prejudice to sub-Clause (A) above, the Purchasers hereby
irrevocably acknowledge and agree with the Vendors that the Purchasers shall
have no right of recourse and/or claim whatsoever against the Vendors In
respect of any diminution in the value of the Sale Shares and/or claims,
damages, losses, expenses and/or costs incurred or suffered by the Purchasers
in connection with this Agreement and/or the Sale Shares, whether such
diminution and/or claims, damages, losses, expenses and/or costs is
attributable to cause(s) occurring prior to, on or after completion,
including, without limitation, any diminution and/or claims, damages, losses,
expenses and/or costs as a result of any Claim made prior to, on or after
completion attributable to cause(s) occurring prior to, on or after
completion.

(C) The Purchasers undertake to the Vendors not to commence any
action/proceedings or assist any third party to commence or maintain or
proceed with any action/proceedings against the Vendors in relation to the
Company and/or the Sale Shares.

207 Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s position was that under cl 7, Margaret
Tung and Lin Jian Wei had undertaken that they would not hold Lawrence Ang and
William Tan liable for any losses in connection with or as a result of the RTC
S&PA, nor would they have any recourse against Lawrence Ang and William Tan in
respect of _inter alia_ , any claims, damages, losses suffered by Margaret
Tung and Lin Jian Wei in connection with RTC S&PA and/or RTC shares. Since the
RTC S&PA was valid and alive both in law and in fact, by directing, causing
and/or assisting RTC to commence the present suit, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian
Wei had breached cl 7.

208 In turn, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei asserted, _inter alia_ , that cl 7
of the RTC S&PA was void by virtue of s 172(1) of the Companies Act, which
states:

Any provision, whether in the articles or in any contract with a company or
otherwise, for exempting any officer or auditor of the company from, or
indemnifying him against, any liability which by law would otherwise attach to
him in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust
of which he may be guilty in relation to the company, shall be void.

They submitted that Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s construction of cl 7 of
the RTC S&PA would have the effect of precluding Margaret Tung and Lin Jian
Wei from causing RTC to claim against Lawrence Ang and William Tan for their
breaches of duties. This would in turn have the effect of exempting Lawrence
Ang and William Tan as directors from their liability. Clause 7 was therefore
void by virtue of s 172(1).

209 I disagree that pursuant to s 172(1) of the Companies Act, any provision,
be it in the articles, contract or otherwise, purporting to indemnify a
director against any liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or
breach of trust was void and hence unenforceable. The prohibition in s 172(1)
applies only to indemnities given _by the company concerned_ , _ie_ , RTC, and
not those given by third parties.

210 In the English case of _Burgoine and another v London Borough of Waltham
Forest and another_ [1997] BCC 347 (“ _Burgoine_ ”), Neuberger J explained why
this was so (at 358-359):

I have reached the conclusion that the plaintiffs' contention on this point is
correct, and that s 310 [_in pari materia_ with section 172(1) of the
Companies Act] _only applies to indemnities given by the company concerned
(i.e. in this case, the company)_. First, s. 310(1) appears primarily to be
concerned with a ‘provision … exempting any officer’. Given that the sort of
claims contemplated by s. 310 are claims brought by the company, it could only
be the company which granted any such exemption. In those circumstances, I
consider that it would require clearer words before provision relating to
indemnification applied to persons other than the company. Secondly, the
phrase ‘whether contained in a company's articles or in any contract with the
company or otherwise’, while somewhat cumbersome, seems to me to be directing
attention to an arrangement with the company, and not with anyone else.
Thirdly, the words ‘or otherwise’ do not, I think, naturally mean, at least in
the context of s. 310(1) , ‘or anyone else’; to my mind, the words ‘or
otherwise’ are directed more towards covering an arrangement with the company
which may not amount to a contract, but which nonetheless might give rise to
an argument that the company had agreed to exempt the director, or to
indemnify him, in respect of the matters referred to at the end of s. 310(1) :
an example of this might be some sort of an arrangement with the company
amounting to an estoppel…

In effect, I consider that the words ‘or otherwise’ in s. 310(1) are to be
construed _eiusdem generis_ with the preceding words ‘whether contained in a
company's articles or in any contract with the company’. After all, the
company's articles of association are, at least in a sense, contractual
provisions between the company and its members. In those circumstances, it can
be said with force that there is a genus, namely an arrangement between the
company and its officers, which restricts what might otherwise be said to be a
very wide meaning of the words ‘or otherwise’.

[emphasis added]

Section 310(1) of the UK Companies Act 1985 states:

This section applies to any provision, whether contained in a company's
articles or in any contract with the company or otherwise, for exempting any
officer of the company or any person (whether an officer or not) employed by
the company as auditor from, or indemnifying him against. any liability which
auditors by virtue of any rule of law would otherwise attach to him in respect
of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which he may
be guilty in relation to the company.

Section 310(2) further provided, “Except as provided by the following
subsection, any such provision is void.”

211 Accordingly, Margaret Tung’s and Lin Jian Wei’s argument that cl 7 was
void was not tenable because RTC was not a party to the RTC S&PA, and cl 7 was
in fact an indemnity given by Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei in their personal
capacities (and not by RTC). Clause 7 did not fall within the scope of s
172(1) and was accordingly not void.

212 Be that as it may, even though s 172(1) did not apply, with the effect
that cl 7 remained valid, it was still not open to Lawrence Ang and William
Tan to rely on cl 7 as the Deed had superseded the RTC S&PA. Under Recital (F)
of the Deed, Margaret Tung, Lin Jian Wei, Lawrence Ang and William Tan agreed
to:

_[M]utually release and discharge each other from their respective rights and
obligations under_ the Loan Facility, First RTC Agreement, _June Option
Agreement [ie the RTC S &PA]_ and Second RTC Agreement (“Discharged
Agreements”) subject to the terms and conditions of this Deed. [emphasis
added]

This was also the effect of cl 4.3 of the Deed:

Other than obligations and liabilities arising from this Deed (in particular,
[Margaret Tung’s and Lin Jian Wei’s] obligations and liabilities under Clause
2 above), _each party hereto irrevocably releases and discharges absolutely
each of the other parties hereto from its/his entire obligations and
liabilities of whatsoever nature or cause, howsoever arisen from, related or
connected to, or under the Discharged Agreements with effect from the date of
this Deed and each party hereto hereby waives its rights in respect of any
claims or actions it may have (other than claims or actions arising under this
Deed), of whatsoever nature, howsoever framed, in law or in equity, against
each of the other parties hereto under the Discharged Agreements with effect
from the date of this Deed_ Provided that there shall be no release and
discharge nor waiver of rights in respect of claims or actions that [Margaret
Tung and Lin Jian Wei] may have against [Lawrence Ang or William Tan] in
respect of any defect in the rights, title interest in the RTC shares
purchased by [Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei] pursuant to the First RTC
Agreement and the Second RTC Agreement. [emphasis added]

Recital (F) read with Recital (D) of the preamble of the Deed defined
“Discharged Agreements” to include the RTC S&PA. Hence, Lawrence Ang’s and
William Tan’s claim against Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei turned, in part, on
the effect of Recital (F) and cl 4.3 of the Deed, which I now turn to.

Recital (F) and cl 4.3of the Deed

213 On 18 February 2002 after Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had acquired a
100% stake in RTC, the Deed was entered into and executed by Margaret Tung,
Lin Jian Wei, Lawrence Ang and William Tan with the intention that each would
have no claims against the rest in respect of RTC and/or the RTC Shares.
Hence, Recital F and cl 4.3 were included in the Deed.

214 Lawrence Ang and William Tan argued that pursuant to Recital (F) and cl
4.3 of the Deed, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had waived all their rights in
respect of any claims or actions which they may have against Lawrence Ang and
William Tan in relation to RTC or the RTC Shares purchased by Margaret Tung
and Lin Jian Wei, save for any defect in title or rights to the RTC shares.

215 However, I note that the scope of cl 4.3 is confined to claims or actions
that Margaret Tung, Lin Jian Wei, Lawrence Ang and William Tan may have
against each other _under the Discharged Agreements_. The present suit and the
attendant claims brought by RTC against Lawrence Ang and William Tan, however,
were not claims under these Discharged Agreements. Neither did they arise out
of or are connected with the Discharged Agreements; none of the actions
against Lawrence Ang and William Tan concern, however remotely, the sale and
purchase of RTC shares. As such, I agree with Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei
that in causing or directing RTC to commence the present suit against Lawrence
Ang and William Tan, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had not breached cl 4.3 of
the Deed. As for Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s argument that the Discharged
Agreements, which included the RTC S&PA, dealt with claims which Margaret Tung
and Lin Jian Wei may have had against Lawrence Ang and William Tan not only in
relation to the RTC Shares but also in relation to RTC as well, this is
misguided. The RTC S&PA is primarily concerned with the sale of RTC shares to
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei. As such, references to claims in relation to
RTC ought to be read with the subject matter and overall purpose of the RTC
S&PA in mind.

Bad faith and unconscionable conduct

216 Lawrence Ang and William Tan alleged that Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei
had acted in bad faith and/or unconscionably in causing, directing and/or
assisting RTC to commence the present suit. _Inter alia_ , they argued that
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had knowledge of the alleged breaches of the
Defendants and even ratified them, that they had depleted RTC’s assets for
their own benefit, and that they had essentially obtained RTC for “free”. In
response, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei argued that allegations of bad faith
and unconscionable conduct _simpliciter_ do not give rise to any reasonable
cause of action.

217 In my view, the law is not clear as to whether there is a broader doctrine
of unconscionability which may act as an independent cause of action. In _Chua
Chian Ya v Music & Movements (S) Pte Ltd (formerly trading as M & M Music
Publishing)_ [2010] 1 SLR(R) 607 (“ _Chua Chian Ya_ ”), Andrew Phang JA made
it clear that his endorsement of Parker J’s distinction between the common law
jurisdiction to declare a contract unenforceable as a restraint of trade and
the equitable jurisdiction of the court to grant relief in certain
circumstances against unfair and unconscionable bargains in _Panayiotou v Sony
Music Entertainment (UK) Ltd_ [1994] EMLR 229 did not entail the adoption of a
doctrine of unconscionability:

It is important… to emphasise that this does not entail the adoption of a
broader doctrine of unconscionability - the legal status of which is still in
a state of flux in the Commonwealth in general and in Singapore in
particular... [at [24]]

He then said that on the facts of _Chua Chian Ya_ , it was unnecessary to
consider whether there is, or ought to be, a broader doctrine of
unconscionability. Instead, that case did not involve the broader doctrine of
unconscionability but focused instead on some other matter (_viz_ , the
court's common law jurisdiction to declare a contract unenforceable as a
restraint of trade).

218 In the present matter, I think it unnecessary to make a finding of whether
there had been bad faith on Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei’s part in bringing
this action as I am of the view that neither “bad faith” nor
“unconscionability” can constitute a cause of action. These terms merely
describe the “character” of a transaction or an action, but cannot suffice to
become a cause of action in itself. For a cause of action to exist, there must
be sufficient facts upon which a claimant can ask the courts for relief. That
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei may have acted in bad faith does not avail
William Tan and Lawrence Ang of any legal remedy.

219 In any case, the concept of “bad faith” in the present context is hard to
delineate as with the concept of “unconscionability”. In fact, a New Zealand
judge once remarked of the latter that he would prefer “the herald of equity
to be wearing more distinctive clothing (_per_ Tipping J in _Marshall Futures
Ltd v Marshall_ [1992] 1 NZLR 316 at 325). To use these amorphous concepts
which are available in equity as “swords” rather than “shields” would be to
throw the state of law into confusion.

Conspiracy

220 It is Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s case that Margaret Tung and Lin
Jian Wei had by unlawful means and/or with the sole or predominant intention
of injuring Lawrence Ang and William Tan, conspired and combined wrongfully
together with RTC to commence the current claim against them. This is
notwithstanding the completion of the sale and purchase of the shares in RTC
in accordance with, _inter alia_ , the terms of the RTC S&PA and the Deed.

221 Lawrence Ang averred in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that:

Consistent with Lin’s reassurances that he would not cause any harm to me,
[Margaret] Tung and Lin [Jianwei] also caused RTC to defend the members’ suit
without including me as a third party in those proceedings. I verily believe
that if [Margaret] Tung and Lin [Jianwei] really believed that I was liable to
RTC for any of the claims made by RTC in the present proceedings, they would
have caused RTC to commence third party proceedings against me in the members’
suit.

I verily believe that [Margaret] Tung and Lin [Jianwei] are using RTC to sue
me as they are unable to do so personally since this will result in a breach
of the various agreements entered into by [Margaret] Tung and Lin [Jianwei]
and myself in 2001. I have deposed to these agreements earlier.

222 Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei submit that the commencement of the present
suit against Lawrence Ang and William Tan is not an unlawful act, and that the
sole and pre-dominant purpose of RTC in commencing this action was not to
injure Lawrence Ang and William Tan but to recover the loss and damage caused
by them.

223 In _Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others_ [2008] 1 SLR(R)
80, Prakash J summarised the elements that must be satisfied to prove both
conspiracy by unlawful means and conspiracy by lawful means, at [23]:

In order for the claim of conspiracy to succeed, the elements that have to be
satisfied are the following:

(a) a combination of two or more persons and an agreement between and amongst
them to do certain acts;

(b) if the conspiracy involves lawful acts, then the predominant purpose of
the conspirators must be to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff, but if
the conspiracy involves unlawful means, then such predominant intention is not
required;

(c) the acts must actually be performed in furtherance of the agreement; and

(d) damage must be suffered by the plaintiff.

224 Limb (b) is of particular import here. In instituting the suit, Margaret
Tung and Lin Jian Wei had not committed an unlawful act. The breaches of the
Deed were incidental to the institution of the suit, but they would not make
the mounting of this suit unlawful. Lawrence Ang and William Tan have to prove
that the predominant purpose of the conspirators, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian
Wei, was to cause damage or injury to Lawrence Ang and William Tan. I do not
think that has been proven here. On the face of it, the Plaintiff’s purpose of
bringing this suit is, at its best, to recover the loss and damage allegedly
caused by the Defendants, and at its worst, to unjustly enrich Margaret Tung
and Lin Jian Wei (the shareholders of the Plaintiff) should the Defendants be
found liable to RTC for the various alleged breaches. In either case, any
injury caused to Lawrence Ang and William Tan is incidental to the bringing of
this suit; it is a stretch to say that there is a conspiracy to injure them.

Unjust Enrichment

225 Lawrence Ang and William Tan submit that the elements for a claim of
unjust enrichment are :

(a) Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei have obtained an enrichment or a gain;

(b) There is an ‘unjust’ factor indicating that the enrichment is unjustified
and ought to be reversed; and

(c) The gain was at the expense of Lawrence Ang and William Tan.

They submit that since Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei are one and the same
with RTC both in fact and in law, as such Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei would
have obtained an enrichment or gain in the form of any damages payable by
Lawrence Ang and William Tan to RTC, as Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei are the
only shareholders and directors of RTC, a proprietary club.

226 This claim is contingent upon RTC being successful in the present action.
As I have found against RTC, issues of unjust enrichment do not arise.

Peter Lim v Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei

227 Peter Lim has contended that RTC, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei conspired
with the predominant intention to injure him so as to enrich themselves
unjustly. As with Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s conspiracy claim against
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei, I find that evidence is lacking to show that
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had the intention to injure Peter Lim. This was
simply incidental to the suit.

Peter Lim and Dennis Foo v Lawrence Ang & William Tan

228 In a Deed of Settlement (“the Deed of Settlement”) dated 19 April 2001
which was entered into by the Defendants, it was agreed at cl 2.4 that:

(a) Each party agrees that subject to and on Closing, it shall release, waive
or otherwise hold harmless the other Parties from all actions, rights, choses
in actions, remedies, claims, proceedings and demands whatsoever and howsoever
arising which it has or may have against the other Parties in respect of all
subject matters of and/or allegations made in the Suits inclusive of costs and
interest.

(c) Save for the RTC Debt, EH Debt, Sullivan Debt and Goldhurst Debt, to be
novated on closing, it is hereby agreed and acknowledged that:

(i) subject to Closing, [Lawrence Ang and William Tan] shall (and shall
procure that RTC and EH and their respective subsidiaries and associated
companies shall), and [Dennis Foo] and [Peter Lim] shall, release and waive
any and all claims, rights, actions, remedies and demands they may have
(whatsoever and howsoever arising) in respect of any loans or alleged loans by
RTC or EH or any of their respective subsidiary or associated companies to
[Peter Lim] and/or [Dennis Foo], and by [Peter Lim] and/or [Dennis Foo] to
RTC, EH, Sullivan, Goldhurst or any of their respective subsidiary or
associated companies, as the case may be;

(ii)(aa) [Lawrence Ang and William Tan] shall hold [Peter Lim] and [Dennis
Foo] harmless and shall indemnify them for all amounts, expenses, losses and
damages which they may incur or suffer if claims and actions are made or
brought against them in breach of sub-clause (i) above; and

(ii)(bb) [Peter Lim] and [Dennis Foo] shall hold [Lawrence Ang and William
Tan] harmless and shall indemnify them for all amounts, expenses, losses and
damages which they may incur or suffer if claims and actions are made or
brought against them in breach of sub-clause (i) above.

Further, cl 5.3 provided:

Notwithstanding Clause 2.4 but subject to Closing, _[Lawrence Ang and William
Tan] jointly and severally covenant and agree that they shall not bring or
make any claim, action or proceedings against, and (a) shall procure RTC_ , EH
and their respective subsidiary companies (including successors and assigns)
(collectively known as “the Companies”) _not to do so_ , and (b) shall not
procure, instigate or approach ABR and its subsidiary companies (including
successors and assigns) (collectively known herein as the “ABR Companies”), to
do so, the following, save insofar as [Lawrence Ang and William Tan] would be
required by law as a director of any of the ABR Companies to act otherwise,:

1\. [Peter Lim]

2\. [Dennis Foo]

…

in respect of any acts or omissions by such persons (whether by themselves,
individually or together with any other person) in their capacity as officers
or directors of the Companies and the ABR Companies … and as regards [Peter
Lim] insofar as it is alleged by [Lawrence Ang and William Tan] that he is a
shadow director, officer or consultant or otherwise in any other capacity, in
relation to…

_PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT this provision shall not apply_ :

_(a)in respect of any claim by the Companies and ABR Companies in respect of
any fraudulent or dishonest act or in connection with any offence committed by
the abovenamed persons;_ or

(b) to prohibit, in the event of legal proceedings brought against the Raffles
Town Club, EH, RTC, [Lawrence Ang] and/or [William Tan] (i) by any member or
ex-member of the Raffles Town Club, the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd,
United Overseas Bank Ltd, Standard Chartered Bank and/or Ogilvy & Mather
arising from or in relation to the membership launch or drive of the Raffles
Town Club; and (ii) by Tan Buck Chye and/or Teriya Nganthavee in connection
with matters arising within the period from May 1996 to June 1997 in relation
to the affairs of EH and RTC, from joining [Peter Lim], [Dennis Foo] or Chan
Lay Hoon as a party to such legal proceedings.

AND PROVIDED FURTHER ALWAYS THAT nothing in this Clause 5.3 shall be taken as
requiring any act, thing or omission which contravenes, or is restricted or
limited or prohibited in any way whatsoever under any applicable law.

[emphasis added]

229 Peter Lim argued that the commencement and continuation of the present
suit by the Plaintiff gave rise to continuing breaches of the Deed of
Settlement which thus obliged Lawrence Ang and William Tan to indemnify him
for all losses, damages and expenses he may suffer. He relied on cl 2.4 and cl
5.3 for this argument. Dennis Foo contended that by virtue of cl 2.4, Lawrence
Ang and William Tan had also agreed to indemnify him if claims were made on
loans which had been novated to Lawrence Ang. He said that Lawrence Ang and
William Tan had covenanted not to bring or make any claim against him, and
that they would, _inter alia_ , procure RTC not to make any claim against him
in respect of any act or omission which had been committed in his capacity as
RTC’s director. This covenant was breached as RTC had commenced this suit
against him.

230 Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s position however was that cl 2.4(c) was
inapplicable as RTC had not commenced the present action against Peter Lim or
Dennis Foo for loans made by RTC or EH to either of them. Further, Lawrence
Ang and William Tan submitted that their obligations under cl 2.4(c) only
applied for as long as they were the shareholders/directors/in control of RTC
and EH. Since they had both ceased to be involved with RTC by June 2001, they
were discharged from their obligations in respect of the Deed.

231 I decided in favour of Lawrence Ang and William Tan for two reasons.
First, the present suit does not fall within cl 2.4(c). Clause 2.4(c)(i) only
applies to loans made by RTC or EH or any of their respective subsidiary or
associated companies as lender to “[Peter Lim] and/or the Vendors (_inter
alia_ , Dennis Foo)” as borrower, and vice versa. However, the loans in
dispute were made by RTC to RTCI, the latter not falling within the stated
categories of borrowers in cl 2.4(c), rather than to Peter Lim and/or Dennis
Foo. In other words, RTC’s present action against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo
does not involve any loans made by RTC to either of them.

232 Second, while cl 5.3 prohibits Lawrence Ang and William Tan from bringing
or making claims against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo and obliges them (Lawrence
Ang and William Tan) to procure, _inter alia_ , RTC not to make any claim
against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo, cl 5.3 does not apply where the Plaintiff’s
claim is in respect of “fraudulent or dishonest act or in connection with any
offence committed by” Peter Lim and Dennis Foo (see proviso (a) to cl 5.3, at
[228] above). As I have established earlier, RTC’s claims against Peter Lim
and Dennis Foo does include allegations of fraud and dishonest behaviour As
such, and by virtue of proviso (a), Peter Lim and Dennis Foo cannot rely on cl
5.3. I noted that Peter Lim had argued that the Plaintiff would be unable to
establish the ingredients of a conspiracy and therefore its claim amounted to,
at worst, a claim for breaches of duty, and not dishonesty, fraud or any
criminal offence. Dennis Foo had also argued that since he had not committed
any fraudulent or dishonest acts, accordingly, proviso (a) ought not to apply.
However, the wording of proviso (a), read with the rest of cl 5.3 merely
requires _allegations_ of fraud and dishonesty, and not that actual fraud and
dishonesty be made out, before proviso (a) may be invoked. The opening of cl
5.3 provides that Lawrence Ang and William Tan “ _shall not bring or make any_
claim, action or proceeding against”, _inter alia_ , Peter Lim and Dennis Foo,
and proviso (a) then provides that cl 5.3 would not apply “in respect of any
claim by [RTC]… in respect of any fraudulent or dishonest act”.

Lawrence Ang and William Tan v Peter Lim and Dennis Foo (counterclaim)

233 Lawrence Ang and William Tan claimed contribution or indemnity from Peter
Lim and Dennis Foo in respect of all aspects of RTC’s claim. They alleged,
_inter alia_ , that Peter Lim was the controlling mind and will and driving
force behind the businesses of EH and was a beneficial shareholder of RTC and
EH, and had taken loans and dividends from RTC and EH. They also alleged,
_inter alia_ , that Dennis Foo was RTC’s and EH’s registered shareholder and
director, that he was beholden to Peter Lim at all material times and that he
was Peter Lim’s servant and/or agent, and that he colluded or collaborated
with Peter Lim in respect of RTC’s and EH’s business affairs.

234 Peter Lim’s counter-argument was that Lawrence Ang and William Tan had
breached the Deed of Settlement by raising this counterclaim and were thus
liable to him in damages. Lawrence Ang and William Tan countered that it was
Peter Lim and Dennis Foo who had first commenced third party proceedings
against them; Lawrence Ang and William Tan had not commenced the suit in
breach of clause 2.4(c) of the Deed of Settlement. But even if they had been
in breach of clause 2.4(c), Peter Lim and Dennis Foo would similarly have
breached the same.

235 As for Dennis Foo, he said that there was no evidence to support the
allegation that he was indeed Peter Lim’s agent or that he had colluded with
Peter Lim. In fact, he said that the evidence suggested that it was Lawrence
Ang who had various dealings with Peter Lim to his exclusion, and that as
RTC’s largest shareholder Lawrence Ang was in control of RTC. Dennis Foo also
argued that even if there was a conspiracy and he a party to it, Lawrence Ang
and William Tan cannot claim contribution or indemnity from him as their co-
conspirator as the law does not enforce illegal agreements under the maxim _ex
turpi causa non oritur_. Neither does the law allow Lawrence Ang and William
Tan to retain part of the wrongfully acquired benefit.

236 Since I have found that RTC has not made out its claims against Lawrence
Ang and William Tan, and Lawrence Ang’s and William Tan’s counterclaims are
contingent upon RTC’s success in the main suit, the issue of indemnity and/or
contribution does not arise and is hence moot.

Issue of claims being time-barred

237 I should add that the parties had raised arguments and counter-arguments
to the effect that their opponents’ claims were time-barred. It would have
been clear by now that I found these contentions unmeritorious but for the
sake of completeness, I am briefly addressing them in this section.

238 Lawrence Ang and William Tan both contended that the Plaintiff’s claims in
respect of (a) the management fees, (b) the directors’ remuneration or
expenses and (c) the RTCI loan, were time-barred according to s 24A(3) of the
Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Limitation Act”). Section 24A states:

24A. —(1) This section shall apply to any action for damages for negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or
of a provision made by or under any written law or independently of any
contract or any such provision).

(2) An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist
of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any
other person, shall not be brought after the expiration of —

(a) 3 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or

(b) 3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff has the knowledge
required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury,
if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (_a_).

(3) An action to which this section applies, other than one referred to in
subsection (2), shall not be brought after the expiration of the period of —

(a) 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or

(b) 3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff or any person in
whom the cause of action was vested before him first had both the knowledge
required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage
and a right to bring such an action, if that period expires later than the
period mentioned in paragraph (a).

239 Lawrence Ang and William Tan contended that because the last payment of
the management fees occurred in November 1999, the cause of action would have
arisen then. Assuming the damage was patent, they argue that the time period
of 6 years would start running from November 1999. They further submitted that
even if the damage had been latent so that s 24(3)(b) was applicable instead,
the Plaintiff through Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei (when the latter
purchased the second 50% of the Plaintiff) would have had knowledge or at the
very least, suspicion or reasonable belief of the payment of the management
fees at the time. Thus, the Plaintiff had only 3 years from June 2001 to bring
the claim.

240 In rejoinder, the Plaintiff argued that the Defendants had not
established, as required under Section 24A(3)(_b_) of the Limitation Act, that
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had the “ _knowledge required for bringing an
action for damages in respect of the relevant damage_ ” at least 3 years
before 2006, which was when RTC commenced the action. The Plaintiff contended
that the fact that Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei were aware of the management
fees payments in 2001/2002 did not mean that they were aware at that time that
the Defendants had, in purported breach of their duties, caused the Plaintiff,
RTC to pay the management fees under an allegedly sham Management Agreement.
The burden of proof, it contends, lies on the Defendants to establish when
Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had the knowledge required for bringing the
action against the Defendants.

241 I concur with the Plaintiff in this regard. The Plaintiff also relied in
the alternative on s 22(1) of the Limitation Act, where it is provided that:

No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a
beneficiary under a trust, being an action —

(a) in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee
was a party or privy; or

(b) to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the
possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted
to his use.

242 The Plaintiff’s claim under the Management Agreement falls within limbs
(a) and (b) of s 22(1) of the Limitation Act. First, the Plaintiff’s claim
under the Management Agreement included a claim against the Defendants for
fraudulent breach of trust under s 22(1)(a) of the Limitation Act.[note: 33]
Also, the reliefs sought by the Plaintiff under the Management Agreement claim
included the recovery from the trustee (the Defendants) of trust property (the
S$78 million misapplied by the Defendants) under Section 22(1)(b) of the
Limitation Act (see prayer (2) of the SOC). Finally, the relief sought by the
Plaintiff under the Management Agreement claim also included the recovery of
the proceeds of the trust property (the S$78 million) in the possession of the
trustee (the Defendants) or previously received by the trustee and converted
to his use under s 22(1)(_b_) of the Limitation Act. In the premises, pursuant
to s 22(1) of the Limitation Act, no limitation period would apply to RTC’s
claim under the Management Agreement.

243 As for the alleged time bar in relation to the directors’ remuneration and
the private expenses, Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Peter Lim had contended
that the claims were time-barred under s 6 and/or s 24A of the Limitation Act.
The Plaintiff’s claim was premised upon the Defendants’ alleged breach of
fiduciary duties in “misapplying RTC’s property in making payments of
directors’ remuneration and consultancy fees to themselves under the Private
Accounts”. If liable, the Defendants would be constructive trustees of the
Plaintiff’s monies. I agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that its claim for
the recovery of the directors’ remuneration and consultancy fees that were
paid to them falls within the ambit of Section 22(1)(b) of the Limitation Act
and is not time-barred. Similarly, no limitation period applies to the
Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants for the recovery of the expenses
claimed by the Defendants under the Private Accounts.

244 There is another reason why the claim is not time barred. The directors’
remuneration, consultancy fees and expenses paid under the Private Accounts
were alleged to be disguised or dressed-up dividends and paid in contravention
of s 403 of the Companies Act. Pursuant to s 29(1) of the Limitation Act, the
period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered
the fraud or the mistake, as the case may be, or could in reasonable diligence
have discovered it. The earliest RTC could have sued was in mid-2001, when the
Third Parties took over RTC from the Defendants. This means that the 6-year
limitation period would run from mid-2001 at the earliest.

245 Lawrence Ang and William Tan sought to argue that RTC’s claim in relation
to the loan of $33 million was time-barred by virtue of s 24A(3) of the
Limitation Act. The Plaintiff countered that s 22(1)(b) of the Limitation Act
applied. I agreed. The said provision provides that no period of limitation
shall apply to an action by a beneficiary under a trust, being an action to
recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the
possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted
to his use.

246 Peter Lim and Dennis Foo argued that RTC’s claim in respect of the
acceptance of some 19,000 members as part of RTC’s founder membership launch
is time-barred as a matter of law. Lawrence Ang and William Tan did not raise
any argument in this regard. I agreed with the Plaintiff that its cause of
action in breach of fiduciary duty would allow it to invoke s 24A(3) of the
Limitation Act.

Conclusion

247 In the premises, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim in its entirety,
including its claim of conspiracy which I have found to be wholly
unmeritorious. As has been iterated in my judgment, the interests of the
company were synonymous with the interests of the Defendants. They had wanted
the company to do well for itself as that would ultimately even if
incidentally, benefit them. To suggest that they had acted with impunity or
recklessly for their personal benefit even when they knew that a lawsuit was
likely is not conceivable to me. I also dismiss the Defendants’ counterclaims.
I will hear the parties on costs if these cannot be agreed.
