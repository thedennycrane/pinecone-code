Insolvency Law – Bankruptcy – Statutory demand – Notice of Assignment attached
to statutory demand – Whether assignment of rights under guarantee or of
chose-in-action  
  
Insolvency Law – Bankruptcy – Statutory demand – Setting aside – Whether debt
stated in the statutory demand properly accounted for  
  

Orient called upon the guarantee. Eventually, judgment was entered against the
debtor. Orient then executed a deed of assignment in favour of the petitioning
creditors. The petitioning creditors asserted that a Notice of Assignment was
served on the debtor by letter dated 18 October 2001. This was disputed by the
latter who claims that he did not know of the letter. The debtor’s application
to set aside the statutory demand was dismissed by the assistant registrar.
The debtor appealed to a judge in chambers. On appeal, the debtor submitted
that although a copy of the notice of assignment was attached to the statutory
demand, it did not constitute good notice because when the statutory demand
was served, bankruptcy proceedings are deemed to have begun. Next, the debtor
submitted that the assignment by Orient to the petitioning creditors was only
an assignment of the hire purchase agreement and there was no assignment of
their rights under the guarantee. Lastly, the debtor submitted that the notice
was a notice of an assignment of the chose-in-action and was therefore bad
because the chose-in-action had merged with the judgment.

**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. This was an appeal by a debtor against the registrar’s decision in
refusing to strike out the statutory demand of the petitioning creditors dated
7 August 2002. The salient background facts are as follows. A company called
Orient Consumer Credit Pte Ltd entered into a hire purchase agreement with one
Francis Marcel for the purchase of a second hand BMW 320 car. The debtor
signed a separate agreement with Orient Consumer Credit Pte Ltd as the
guarantor for Francis Marcel. Marcel defaulted and Orient Credit Pte Ltd
called upon the guarantee. Eventually, judgment was entered against the debtor
on 24 July 2001. On 18 October 2001 Orient Credit Pte Ltd executed a deed of
assignment in favour of the petitioning creditors.

2\. The petitioning creditors asserted that a Notice of Assignment was served
on the debtor by letter dated 18 October 2001\. This was disputed by the
latter who claims that he did not know of the letter. The debtor’s application
to set aside the statutory demand was dismissed. Mr Peter Pang submitted on
behalf of the debtor that although a copy of the notice of assignment was
attached to the Statutory demand, it does not constitute good notice because
when the statutory demand was served, bankruptcy proceedings are deemed to
have begun. In his view, the notice of assignment must be given before the
commencement of proceedings. He cited the case of _Compania Columbiana De
Seguros v Pacific Steam Navigation Co_ [1965] 1 QB 101 in support. In my view,
I can find nothing in that case that is of assistance to the debtor here. The
service of a statutory demand does not commence any proceedings in court. That
takes place, in the case of bankruptcy proceedings, by the filing of the
petition. The statutory demand is essentially a notice to the debtor. In my
opinion, there is no reason why a notice of assignment cannot be served at the
same time as the statutory demand. The pertinent question, and the primary
purpose of the notice requirement, is whether a debtor had been given adequate
notice of the matters set out in the notice of assignment and the statutory
demand. The debtor was clearly put on proper notice of both events in this
case.

3\. Mr Pang’s second argument was that the assignment by Orient Consumer
Credit Pte Ltd to the petitioning creditors was only an assignment of the hire
purchase agreement. He submitted that there was, therefore, no assignment of
their rights under the guarantee. This argument fails entirely when one
examines the deed of assignment. The relevant provision which I now set out
below sufficiently assigned this rights under the guarantee to the petitioning
creditors:-

> > "In consideration of the sum of Singapore Dollars _NINETY-FIVE THOUSAND
> SEVENTY AND CENTS_ _THIRTY-SEVEN ONLY_ (S$_95,070.37_) now paid by the
> Assignee paid to the Assignor (the receipt whereof the Assignor hereby
> acknowledges) the Assignor as beneficial owner hereby assign to the Assignee
> _all the rights and interest of the Assignor under the Agreement together
> with all the monies now or hereafter to become payable under the Agreement
> and the goods comprised herein and the benefit of our guarantees and
> indemnities_ , if any, taken by the Assignor in connection with the
> Agreement to hold the same unto the Assignee absolutely subject to the
> rights of the Hirer thereunder." (_emphasis mine_).

4\. The next point that Mr Pang submitted was that the notice was a notice of
an assignment of the chose-in-action and is therefore bad because the chose-
in-action had merged with the judgment. Numerous authorities were referred at
length to establish that the chose-in-action had merged with the judgment. I
think that is a point that is not in dispute. The question is whether the
assignment was an assignment only of the chose-in-action. The provisions of
the deed evinced a clear assignment of all rights and monies payable under
guarantees in connection with the Hire Purchase Agreement.

5\. The points above were insufficient to merit setting aside the statutory
demand. However, the debt stated by the petitioning creditors in the statutory
demand did not appear to be properly accounted for. It is important to set out
the undisputed background facts in respect of this point. The subject matter
of the hire-purchase (the BMW car) was wrecked in Malaysia and towed back to
Singapore whereupon, the petitioning creditors de-registered the car and
obtained payment of the car's PARF and COE values from the Land Transport
Authority, amounting to $55,282. The judgment debt was $78,561.69 plus
interest. Instead of stating the sum of $55,282.00, the petitioning creditors
declared it as "the balance of proceeds" from the sale of the car, amounting
to $32,808.70. Counsel for the petitioning creditors explained that the
difference were due to deductions in respect of administrative and other
expenses incurred by them. But this was not explained in the statutory demand
nor the supporting affidavit. In my view, it is important that the amount
deducted must be set out and explained so that if the debtor may challenge
them if he has grounds to do so. He would be unable to challenge them if he
did not know how or why there were deductions from the proceeds from the sale
of the car. This is a sufficiently fatal flaw in the statutory demand to
warrant setting it aside; and on this ground alone I allowed the appeal and
set aside the statutory demand.
