**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1\. In this Originating Summons (OS), the Plaintiff, Mr Wee Soon Kim Anthony,
applied for an order that the Defendant, The Law Society of Singapore (the Law
Society), do apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a Disciplinary Committee
under Section 96 of the Legal Profession Act (LPA) to investigate into Mr Wees
complaint against two solicitors (the Solicitors) dated 18 August 1999. Other
consequential orders were also sought.

2\. By a Summons In Chambers No 604565 of 2000, the Solicitors applied to be
added as Interveners in the action on the ground that they have a real and
substantial interest in the outcome of the OS. On 8 January 2001, the
Assistant Registrar Ms May Loh granted the application. Mr Wee appealed
against that order and on 6 February 2001, I dismissed his appeal with costs.

3\. Mr Wee has appealed against my decision.

The Background

_**

4\. The background to the OS and the Solicitors application is set out in
paras 4 to 10 of the first affidavit of Davinder Singh s/o Amar Singh of which
paras 5 and 6 were derived from the Grounds of Decision of Lai Kew Chai J in
Originating Summons No 37 of 2000\. Paragraphs 4 to 10 state:

> 4\. By a letter dated 18 August 1999, the Plaintiff lodged a complaint with
> the Law Society against HK and me. A copy of the letter is annexed hereto as
> "DS-1".
>
> 5\. In appears from paragraph 9 of the Honourable Justice Lai Kew Chais
> Grounds of Decision that by a letter dated 5 November 1999, the Director of
> the Law Society stated that a meeting of the Council of the Law Society had
> decided that, in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Tang Liang
> Hong v Lee Kuan Yew_ , the Plaintiffs letter of complaint disclosed no
> information of misconduct that must be referred to the Chairman of the
> Inquiry Committee. The Plaintiff asked the Council for the basis upon which
> the Court of Appeal "_empowered the Council to disregard due process of an
> inquiry committee to determine the facts complained of_ ".
>
> 6\. In appears from paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Honourable Justice Lai Kew
> Chais Grounds of Decision that by a letter dated 9 December 1999, the then
> President of the Law Society provided the Plaintiff with an explanation. The
> Plaintiff asserted that the explanation left him "none the wiser".
>
> 7\. The Plaintiff then commenced proceedings against the Law Society in OS
> 37/2000 seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the Law Society should have
> referred the Plaintiffs letter of complaint dated 18 August 1999 against HK
> and I to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel.
>
> 8\. The application was heard before the Honourable Justice Lai Kew Chai.
> The Learned Judge delivered his judgment on 4 August 2000, and found that of
> the four alleged "falsehoods", three were "baseless and frivolous and
> plainly did not and could not fall within" Section 85(1) of the Act. As for
> the fourth alleged "falsehood", His Honour found that it fell within Section
> 85(1) of the Act, but added that "whether there is a prima facie case of
> misconduct against [HK and me] is a matter strictly for the Inquiry
> Committee to be constituted". A copy of the Learned Judges Grounds of
> Decision is annexed hereto as "DS-2".
>
> 9\. An Inquiry Committee was constituted to investigate this complaint.
> Following a hearing of the complaint, the Inquiry Committee recommended the
> dismissal of the complaint. By a letter dated 26 September 2000, the Law
> Society informed HK and me that the Council of the Law Council had
> determined pursuant to Section 87 of the Act that formal investigation of
> our conduct by a Disciplinary Committee was not necessary, and that the
> complaint was dismissed. A copy of this letter is annexed hereto as "DS-3".
>
> 10\. By this Originating Summons, the Plaintiff has now seeks, inter alia,
> an order compelling the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the
> appointment of a Disciplinary Committee to investigate into the Plaintiffs
> complaint dated 18 August 1999.

5\. The Solicitors application to be added as Interveners was made under O 15
r 6(2)(b) which states:

> Misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties (O.15, r.6).
>
> 6(1) .
>
> (2) Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings
> in any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just and
> either of its own motion or on application
>

>> (a) .

>>

>> (b) order any or the following persons to be added as a party, namely:

>>

>>> (i) any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence
before the Court is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or
matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon; or

>>>

>>> (ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there
may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with
any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of
the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that
party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.

Mr Wees arguments

_**

6\. Mr Wee argued that to come within O 15 r 6(2), the Solicitors had to have
some interest which is directly related to or connected with the subject
matter of the OS and not just merely an interest in its outcome. He relied on
_Sanders Lead Co Inc v Entores Metal Brokers Ltd_[1984] WLR 452 at p 460E.

7\. He argued that the Solicitors did not have an interest in the subject
matter of his action if and until a Disciplinary Committee was appointed by
the Judge hearing the OS.

8\. He argued that the OS under s 96 of the LPA was provided by statute and
did not come within the meaning of a cause of action in the contractual sense
under O 15 r 6(2).

9\. As for the case of _Law Society of Singapore v Disciplinary Committee_
[2000] 4 SLR 413, a decision by Lim Teong Qwee JC, as he then was, Mr Wee
pointed out that that was not a case whereby the solicitors concerned applied
to be heard under O 15 r 6(2) but that the right to be heard by the solicitors
concerned was under the rules of natural justice applicable to all judicial or
quasi-judicial proceedings. He accepted that under such rules, the Solicitors
would have a right to be heard at the hearing of the OS.

10\. Mr Wee also argued that it would be impossible if every solicitor is
permitted to intervene in an application made under s 96 of the LPA.

**_

Mr Yims arguments

_**

11\. Mr Jimmy Yim SC, for the Solicitors, rested his arguments primarily on O
15 r 6(2)(b)(i) ie. any person whose presence before the Court is necessary to
ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and
completely determined and adjudicated upon.

12\. He argued that necessary did not mean that the Court could not decide
without the Solicitors being present or that the Law Society was not able to
defend the decision of the Inquiry Committee. It included reference to the
Solicitors who were parties before the Inquiry Committee.

13\. Also, while Mr Yim accepted that there is no direct matter to be
determined between the Solicitors and Mr Wee in the OS, he argued that if O 15
r 6(2)(b)(ii) was not read narrowly, then the Solicitors would come under that
provision as well.

14\. Mr Yim added that the LPA did not exclude the Solicitors right to be
heard, relying on the decision from Lim JC for this proposition.

15\. Mr Yim also referred to the White Book at p 226 para 15/6/10 which
states:

> In addition to the powers contained in this rule or under O.75, r.17(1) the
> Court has an inherent jurisdiction to enable it to do justice in particular
> cases to allow a person not a party to intervene in proceedings if the
> effect of such proceedings has been, or is likely to be, to cause such a
> person serious hardship, difficulty or damage, e.g. a person whose property
> is adversely affected by the presence of an arrested vessel in an Admiralty
> action _in rem_ even though he has no interest in the vessel to entitle him
> to intervene under O.75, r.17(1) (_The Mardina Merchant_ [1975] 1 W.L.R;
> [1974] 3 All E.R. 749).

16\. Mr Yim added that if a Disciplinary Committee was appointed and the
Solicitors succeeded before it, they could not claim costs against Mr Wee.

**_

My reasons

_**

17\. Although the Solicitors are not named in the OS and there is no
requirement under the LPA that they be so named, I was of the view that in any
application under s 76 of the LPA, one of the true substantive parties is the
solicitor against whom the complainant is made.

18\. Although the application to have a Disciplinary Committee appointed is
but the first step for a complainant to pursue his complaint after an
unfavourable report by the Inquiry Committee ie. unfavourable to the
complainant in that he prefers a different outcome, it is nevertheless a step
which is of great significance to the solicitor concerned. If a Disciplinary
Committee is appointed, the solicitor is put to the inconvenience, expense and
anxiety of proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee and the risk of an
adverse outcome against him. These are not factors which can be adequately
compensated by any order that the Disciplinary Committee can make.
Accordingly, if the matter can be nipped in the bud in that the court is not
persuaded to appoint a Disciplinary Committee, the solicitor concerned avoids
the inconvenience, expense, anxiety and risk I have mentioned.

19\. Therefore, the solicitor concerned has, at least, as great an interest as
the complainant in an application under s 96 of the LPA.

20\. It was not necessary for me to decide whether the Solicitors application
came within O 15 r 6(2)(b)(i) or (ii) because I was of the view that the court
has an inherent jurisdiction to allow a party to intervene if the justice of
the case requires and that this jurisdiction is not confined to the
illustration given in the White Book.

21\. For the reasons I have mentioned, I was satisfied that this was a just
case to allow the Solicitors to intervene.

22\. This was not a situation where the Solicitors were interested only in the
outcome of the OS. The case of _Sanders Lead Co_ was on very different facts.

23\. Furthermore, the fact that the OS was filed pursuant to the LPA was
neither here nor there.

24\. As regards the decision of Lim JC, I was aware that the application there
was not under s 96. In that case, a Disciplinary Committee had been appointed
and after its conclusion which was favourable to the solicitors concerned, it
was the Law Society who was applying to court under a different provision ie.
s 97 of the LPA for the solicitors to show cause or directing the Council to
make an application under s 98 for the solicitors to show cause. Also, the Law
Society in that case did not object to the solicitors concerned being heard
and the solicitors there also apparently did not ask to be heard under O 15 r
6.

25\. Be that as it may, I was of the view that solicitors who are or may be
affected by an application under s 97 or 96 have a right to be heard and
should, as a corollary to that, have a right to intervene. There is nothing in
the LPA which excludes either right.

26\. As I have mentioned, Mr Wee accepted that the Solicitors have a right to
be heard at the hearing of the OS under the rules of natural justice but
argued that they did not have a right to intervene under O 15 r 6. I was of
the view that, as regards him, this was a distinction without significance.
There was no real reason for him to object to the Solicitors application since
he had agreed that they have a right to be heard anyway. For the Solicitors,
an order granting them leave to intervene would ensure that they would have a
right to be heard.

27\. I also did not agree that it would be impossible if every solicitor
against whom a complaint is made were to be allowed to intervene in such a
situation.
