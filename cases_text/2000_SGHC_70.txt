: **_Who is who_**  
  
Mr Tan Choon Swee (now deceased) the plaintiff`s father, was a wealthy
businessman. As a mark of his success he maintained three women. The
plaintiff`s counsel referred to them as three `wives`. The defendant was one
of them. She began living with him as his `wife` in 1956 when she was 23 years
old. They did so at 40 Jalan Seaview. Six years later (1962) he purchased the
property known as No 4 Jalan Lada Puteh (`the property`). They cohabited at
the property from the time of purchase. He had no child by the defendant. He
never deserted her. Mr Tan then was married to the plaintiff`s mother. At some
unspecified time he began cohabiting with another woman called Madam Ang. Mr
Tan died in 1988. The plaintiff`s mother died in 1997. The plaintiff is 41
years old. The defendant is 67 years old.  
  
**_The licence_**

****

In 1965 Mr Tan purchased another property - No 75 Ming Teck Park. It was
purchased in the sole name of the defendant. Subsequently, however, a half
interest in Ming Teck Park property was transferred to Mr Tan and they became
tenants-in-common. It was rented out.  
  
In 1983 Mr Tan transferred the property to his son. It was meant to be a
marriage gift to the son. At that time the plaintiff was living in the USA and
continues to do so. The defendant and Mr Tan continued to live in the Jalan
Lada Puteh property even though it had been transferred to the plaintiff.
There was no hiatus in her occupation of the property.  
  
Now I relate three significant events: The first was that in 1987 Mr Tan
transferred his half interest in the Ming Teck Park property to Madam Ang who
then moved into that property with her children by Mr Tan. Second was the
summoning of the plaintiff to Singapore by Mr Tan in 1987. In Singapore, the
plaintiff signed a deed by which he granted a licence to the defendant to live
in the property. The deed is the central feature of his case. Third was the
decease of Madam Ang in 1989. Upon her death her son inherited Madam Ang`s
half share in the Ming Teck Park property.  
  
The plaintiff`s brother, Mr Tan`s lawful son, took charge of the family
business. The defendant continued to reside in the Jalan Lada Puteh property.
The eldest son gave $500 every month to the defendant and made other payments
for her benefit. He did so because that was his father`s wish. Later he
doubled the monthly payment to $1,000. Things moved smoothly until 1996 when
the defendant wanted to sell her half interest in the Ming Teck Park property.
Subsequently it was sold pursuant to an order of court made in 1997. The
defendant received something in excess of $1m cash.  
  
**_The dispute_**

****

In the meantime the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant asking her to quit
the property. The defendant did not oblige. He did not follow that up.  
  
Later the plaintiff ran out of money. About that time the defendant had just
run into money following the sale of the Ming Teck Park property. The
plaintiff wanted the defendant out of the property with the view to selling
it. The defendant refused to comply. The plaintiff gave a second legal notice
on 18 July 1998 demanding possession. The defendant asserted her right to
occupy the property until death. In the meantime the plaintiff`s brother
demanded of the defendant $55,231.71 and filed an action to recover that
amount as `moneys advanced to the defendant consisting of cash payments and
payments made for the medical expenses incurred by the defendant`. This was
the additional monthly payment of $500 I mentioned in [para ] 5. The defendant
paid it without demur. The plaintiff was not so fortunate with his desire.
Such are the vagaries of family relationship when it comes to matters
concerning money - an all too common phenomenon these days. Hence this action.  
  
**_The deed_**

****

The resolution of this case calls for the construction of the true meaning and
effect of the deed made by the parties. The relevant segments of the deed are
as follows:

> _
>
> 1 One Tan Choon Swee holder of Singapore NRIC No 0244387/B of 797
> Mountbatten Road Singapore (hereinafter called `the Donor`) was the
> registered owner of a property erected on Lot 266 of TS 27 known as No 4
> Jalan Lada Puteh Singapore 0922 (hereinafter referred to as `the said
> Property`) more particularly described in the schedule hereto.
>
> 2 By a Deed of Gift dated the 29th day of December 1983 made between the
> Donor and the Owner, the Donor in consideration of the Owner`s marriage to

> rights, title and interest of the said property, such Deed being duly
> registered in the Registry of Deeds as Volume 2300 and Number 27.

**_The notices to quit_ **

****

The first notice to quit dated 28 December 1996 read as follows:

> _We act for Mr Tan Hin Leong, the owner of the property known as No 4, Jalan
> Lada Puteh, Singapore 228916 (hereinafter called the `said property`) which
> you are occupying as licensee._

> _On our client`s instructions, we hereby on his behalf, give you notice to
> vacate and demand and require of you that you do on 31 March 1997 quit and
> deliver possession of the said property to our client._

> _And take notice that in case of any refusal or neglect on your part to
> comply with this notice and demand, an action of ejectment or other legal
> proceedings shall be commenced against you without further notice._

  
  
The second notice to quit read as follows:

> _We act for Mr Tan Hin Leong, the owner of the property known as No 4 Jalan
> Lada Puteh, Singapore 228916 (hereinafter referred to as `the premises`),
> which you are occupying as a mere licensee._

> _On or about 28 October 1996, we on behalf of our client served on you a
> notice to quit to vacate and deliver possession of the premises by 31 March
> 1997. As you have failed to comply with the said notice, you have since been
> in unlawful occupation of the premises._

> _Without prejudice to our clients` rights under the notice to quit dated 28
> December 1996, we are now instructed to give you notice to quit and demand
> and require that you do on 31 July 1998 quit and deliver to our client
> possession of the premises._

> _Take notice that in case of any refusal or neglect on your part to comply
> with this notice and demand an action for ejectment or other legal
> proceedings will be commenced against you without further notice in which
> event you will no doubt be liable for all legal costs thereby incurred._

  
  
**_The plaintiff`s case_ **

****

The plaintiff`s case was this very simple assertion: The defendant was a bare
licensee. The licence was terminated. Accordingly occupation was unlawful.
That was his only case. He did not rely on any breach of the obligations in
the deed. If the notice to quit took effect it turned the defendant into a
trespasser. So there was a claim for damages for trespass.  
  
**_The defendant`s case_**

****

The defendant`s answer was that she was a contractual or equitable licensee.
She was so by reason of the deed. She was entitled to be in occupation of the
property until death provided she was not in breach of the provisions of the
deed. The plaintiff did not allege any breach of the provisions by her. In his
opening the defendant`s counsel attempted to interpolate a case for an
equitable interest, namely proprietary estoppel. For reasons which appear
later this was at once abandoned.  
  
**_The plaintiff`s argument_**

****

Counsel for the plaintiff read this passage from **_The Law of Real
Property_** by Megarry & Wade (5th Ed) at pp 799 and 800.

> _A bare licence is a licence which is not supported by any contract, such as
> a gratuitous permission to enter a house or to cross a field. It can be
> revoked at any time on reasonable notice without rendering the licensor
> liable in damages, but the licensee will not be a trespasser until he has
> had reasonable time to withdraw. Even a licence granted by deed may be
> revocable provided that there is no covenant not to revoke it. A revocable
> licence is automatically determined by the death of the licensor or the
> assignment of the land._

  
  
It is necessary to set out here two observations the textbook makes in the
next paragraph in respect of licences at common law:

> _First, licences were inherently revocable, even though in breach of
> contract;_

> _Secondly, that licences, like other merely personal contracts, could not
> bind third parties._

  
  
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the licence contained in the deed was
a bare licence; it could be revoked at will as there was nothing to avert a
revocation. That submission, in my judgment, begged the question. It ignored
the inquiry before the court: is it a bare licence? Does the deed not
constitute and contain a contractual licence? Is the defendant not entitled to
occupy the property in accordance with the parameters of the deed? To answer
these questions it is necessary to consider the law.  
  
**_The old law_**

****

The expression `licence` in relation to occupation of land was a coinage of
the common law. Interests in land were first created by common law in the form
of estates. A licence was not an estate in that it gave no interest in land.
It made lawful what would be trespass. It was a mere permission or sufferance.
Vaughan CJ said in **Thomas v Sorrell** [1674] 124 ER 1098 at 1109:

> _A dispensation or license properly passeth no interest, nor alters or
> transfers property in any thing, but only makes an action lawful, which
> without it had been unlawful. As a licence to go beyond the seas, to hunt in
> a mans park, to come into his house, are only actions, which without
> licence, had been unlawful._

> _But a licence to hunt in a mans park, and carry away the deer kill`d to his
> own use; to cut down a tree in a mans ground, and to carry it away the next
> day after to his own use, are licences as to the acts of hunting and cutting
> down the tree; but as to the carrying away of the deer kill`d, and tree cut
> down, they are grants._

> _So to licence a man to eat my meat, or to fire the wood in my chimney to
> warm him by, as to the actions of eating, fireing my wood and warming him,
> they are licences; but it is consequent necessarily to those actions that my
> property be destroyed in the meat eaten, and in the wood burnt, so as in
> some cases by consequent and not directly, and as its effect, a dispensation
> or licence may destroy and alter property.`_

  
  
The concept of licence stemmed from the feudal politico-economic system of
land-holding. An interest in land was a right **_in rem_**. Under it the
peasant and pedestrian could step on the land with the permission and
sufferance of the squire who owned it but must step out when the licence was
revoked. They had no interest in it. Under that law women as a rule were in no
better position. Deserted wives and deserted mistresses were in a worse
position. As the common law rigidified it became impossible to change the law.  
  
The concept of a licence in relation to land was well stated and illustrated
in **Wood v Leadbitter** [1845] 153 ER 351. Wood paid a guinea and gained
admission to the Grand Stand of the Racecourse at Doncaster. The Earl of
Eglingtoun, who was the steward of the races, took objection to the
plaintiff`s presence because of a previous incident and directed the defendant
Leadbitter to secure the departure of the plaintiff. When asked to leave the
plaintiff refused. In the event he was forcibly evicted. The plaintiff sued
the defendant for assault and false imprisonment and return of the ticket
price. The claim was dismissed on the ground that it was lawful for Lord
Eglintoun to withdraw the licence without assigning any reason or returning
the price of the ticket because the property belonged to the Lord. The
plaintiff applied to set aside the decision on the ground that as the licence
was given pursuant to the purchase of the ticket as therefore it was
irrevocable and in any event not without returning the price of the ticket.
The report of case states this proposition of law: `A right to come and remain
for a certain time on the land of another can be granted only by deed; and a
parol licence to do so, though money be paid for it, is revocable at any time,
and without paying back the money.  
  
Alderson J, in dismissing the application, said: `A license under seal
(provided it is a mere license) is as revocable as a license by parol; and, on
the other hand, a license by parol, coupled with a grant, is as irrevocable as
a license by deed, provided only that the grant is of a nature capable of
being made by parol. But where there is a license by parol coupled with a
parol grant, or pretended grant, of something which is incapable of being
granted otherwise than by deed, there the license is a mere license; it is not
an incident to a valid grant, and it is therefore revocable.`  
  
It is patent that the contractual right of the plaintiff was entirely ignored.
This has been defended by many on the procedural ground that because the claim
was founded on tort, a claim in assumpsit, that is contract, had to be
ignored. Not everyone agrees with that explanation. It is clear that that
could not be the reason for the decision since it was expressly held that
there was no obligation to refund the price of the ticket. The law that
supported the decision was this: a **_right_** to enter and remain on someone
else`s land could only be founded on some proprietary interest in the land or
a chattel in the land. An interest of the former kind had to be contained in
and evidenced by a deed. A deed without an interest or an interest without a
deed gave a revocable licence and not a right **_in rem_**. Anything short of
a proprietary interest gave no right of occupation at common law. It could
only amount to a mere licence, that is a bare licence. It was revocable at
will even though it would result in a claim for damage for breach of contract
which was a right in personam. If one had no interest in land there could only
be a licence which is a mere permission and not a legal right. Such was the
nature of licence in law.  
  
**_The new law_**

****

That, as the saying goes, was then. That law, to borrow eloquent words of
Watkins J in **Verrall v Great Yarmouth Borough Council** [1981] QB 202 `died
with Queen Victoria. It has no place in the life and times in which we live.`
Now the law is very different. A new development stemmed from the sea change
caused by the fusion of common law and equity by the Judicature Acts in the
Nineteenth Century. A new concept called contractual licence evolved. See
**Winter Garden Theatre (London) Ltd v Millennium Productions Ltd** [1948] AC
173. Denning LJ explained its nature in Errington v Errington and Woods [1952]
1 KB 290 at 298-299:

> _Although the couple had exclusive possession of the house, there was
> clearly no relationship of landlord and tenant. They were not tenants at
> will but licensees. They had a mere personal privilege to remain there, with
> no right to assign or sub-let. They were, however, not bare licensees. They
> were licensees with a contractual right to remain. As such they have no
> right at law to remain, but only in equity, and equitable rights now
> prevail. I confess, however, that it has taken the courts some time to reach
> this position. At common law a licence was always revocable at will,
> notwithstanding a contract to the contrary:**Wood v Leadbitter**. The remedy
> for a breach of the contract was only in damages. That was the view
> generally held until a few years ago: see, for instance, what was said in
> **Booker v Palmer** and **Thompson v Park**. The rule has, however, been
> altered owing to the interposition of equity._

> _Law and equity have been fused for nearly 80 years, and since 1948 it has
> been clear that, as a result of the fusion, a licensor will not be permitted
> to eject a licensee in breach of a contract to allow him to remain:
> see**Winter Garden Theatre, London v Millenium Productions Ld, per Lord
> Greene** , and in the House of Lords **per** Lord Simon; nor in breach of a
> promise on which the licensee has acted, even though he gave no value for
> it: see **Foster v Robinson** , where Sir Raymond Evershed MR said that as a
> result of the oral arrangement to let the man stay, he was entitled as
> licensee to occupy the premises without any payment of rent for the rest of
> his days. This infusion of equity means that contractual licences now have a
> force and validity of their own and cannot be revoked in breach of the
> contract. Neither the licensor nor anyone who claims through him can
> disregard the contract except a purchaser for value without notice._

  
  
A contractual licence is more than a bare licence. It does not give an
interest in land but creates a right of occupation in specie. It is
irrevocable except as contemplated by the terms of the contract. If it is
revoked or if a revocation is threatened the court will decide whether it
should be enforced in specie by granting an order for injunction or specific
performance, or compensated by an award of damages. Under the new regime of
contractual licence, bare licences and licenses coupled with an interest in
land or chattel became effectively irrelevant.  
  
**Verrall v Great Yarmouth Borough Council** [1981] QB 202 illustrates the
concept of contractual licence with poignant clarity. The National Front was a
political party whose principal political philosophy was to keep Britain
exclusively white. It was opposed to all non-European immigration into Britain
and was committed to a programme for the settlement overseas of non-Europeans
already in Britain. It was also implacably opposed to Communism and all other
forms of Marxist Socialism. In 1976 the National Front entered into a contract
with the defendants, Great Yarmouth Borough Council, to hold its annual
conference in the defendants` hall for two days. The Council at that time was
controlled by the Conservative Party. Before the date of the conference, the
Labour Party assumed control of the Council. The new Council resolved to
rescind the approval for the use of the conference hall by the National Front
and return the money (o6,000). The National Front, unable to find an
alternative venue, brought an action for specific performance of the contract.
Watkins J gave the plaintiffs, members of the National Front, judgment for
specific performance of the contract to use the hall. The defendants appealed
to the Court of Appeal which by a collective decision affirmed the judgment of
Watkins J.  
  
Lord Dening MR reasoned his decision in these words:

> _Since the**Winter Garden** case, it is clear that once a man has entered
> under his contract of licence, he cannot be turned out. An injunction can be
> obtained against the licensor to prevent his being turned out. On principle
> it is the same if it happens before he enters. If he has a contractual right
> to enter, and the licensor refuses to let him come in, then he can come to
> the court and in a proper case get an order for specific performance to
> allow him to come in. An illustration was taken in the course of the
> argument. Supposing one of the great political parties - say, the
> Conservative Party - had booked its hall at Brighton for its conference in
> September of this year: it had made all its arrangements accordingly: it had
> all its delegates coming: it had booked its hotels, and so on. Would it be
> open to the local council to repudiate that agreement, and say that the
> Conservative Party could not go there? Would the only remedy be damages?
> Clearly not. The court would order the council in such a case to perform its
> contract. It would be the same in the case of the Labour Party, or whoever
> it may be. When arrangements are made for a licence of this kind of such
> importance and magnitude affecting many people, the licensors cannot be
> allowed to repudiate it and simply pay damages. It must be open to the court
> to grant specific performance in such cases._

  
  
Lord Denning MR found support for his reason in the words of Viscount Simon in
**Winter Garden Theatre (London) Ltd v Millennium Productions Ltd** [1948] AC
173 at 189:

> _A third variant of a licence for value which constant occurs, as in the
> sale of a ticket to enter premises and witness a particular event, such as a
> ticket for a seat at a particular performance at a theatre or for entering
> private ground to witness a day`s sport. In this last class of case, the
> implication of the arrangement, however it may be classified in law, plainly
> is that the ticket entitles the purchaser to enter and, if he behaves
> himself, to remain on the premises until the end of the event which he has
> paid his money to the witness.`_

  
  
Roskill LJ declared that the following statement of Lord Greene MR in **Booker
v Palmer** [1942] 2 All ER 674 at 677 cannot stand alongside the decision of
the House of Lords in the **_Winter Garden Theatre_** case: `If a licence is
revoked in breach of a contract, the remedy is damages and nothing else, the
reason being that the licensee has no estate in the land at all.` Roskill LJ
accepted and applied the following part of Lord Uthwatt`s speech in the
**_Winter Garden Theatre_** case at 202-203:

> _The settled practice of the courts of equity is to do what they can by an
> injunction to preserve the sanctity of a bargain. To my mind, as at present
> advised, a licensee who has refused to accept the wrongful repudiation of
> the bargain which is involved in an unauthorized revocation of the licence
> is as much entitled to the protection of an injunction as a licensee who has
> not received any notice of revocation; and, if the remedy of injunction is
> properly available in the latter case against unauthorized interference by
> the licensor, it is also available in the former case. In a court of equity,
> wrongful acts are no passport to favour._

  
  
It now only remains for me to refer to two cases which has a closer relevance
to the issue at hand. **Hardwick v Johnson** [1978] 2 All ER 935[1978] 1 WLR
683 illustrates the new law. The plaintiff was the defendant`s mother-in-law.
The defendant`s husband had been married once before. When the son became
engaged to the defendant the plaintiff was in a generous mood. She bought a
house for o12,000 in her own name for the couple to live in. The couple were
required to pay o7 per week as `rent`. After they married and moved into the
house they made a few payments as agreed. Within two years the marriage broke
down when the son took up with another woman soon after the defendant became
pregnant. She continued to live in the house with her child. Now the mother-
in-law had a change of heart. She retained solicitors to obtain possession of
the house from the daughter-in-law. The latter refused to move out. So the
mother-in-law took the daughter-in-law to court. The County Court dismissed
the mother-in-law`s claim. The judge treated it as a case on contract even
though everything about the `family arrangement` was vague. The mother-in-law
appealed. The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal. Lord Denning MR did not
think that `it could properly be called a contractual licence because it is
difficult to say that this family arrangement was a contract`. He thought `it
was more in the nature of an equitable licence of which the court has to spell
out the term`. He decided that the defendant could live in the house on
payment of o28 per month. Roskill LJ and Browne LJ preferred to call it `a
contractual licence rather than an equitable licence`. The rights of occupancy
were given both to the son and daughter-in-law who was not in breach of the
conditions of the licence. The question, how long she could live in the house,
did not arise and was not decided.  
  
The next case, **Tanner v Tanner** [1975] 3 All ER 776[1975] 1 WLR 1346, was
about a deserted mistress, the defendant Miss Josephine MacDermott. The
plaintiff was a married man. She took the name `Mrs Tanner` even though she
was not married to the plaintiff in the eyes of the law. She had twin
daughters by him in 1969. The plaintiff bought a house on mortgage in his
name. The defendant moved into the house with the twins. She gave up a rent
controlled flat and moved into the house and spent some money to furnish it.
In the meantime the plaintiff divorced his first wife and married another
woman who became pregnant. The plaintiff`s life entered a phase of financial
difficulties. He commenced an action in the County Court seeking possession of
the house. She resisted the action. Contract was not expressly pleaded. The
county court judge ordered possession. Miss MacDermott appealed. The Court of
Appeal reversed the decision below and implied a contractual licence from the
facts before it. The consideration for the contract was her giving up the rent
controlled flat and looking after the twins.  
  
In the above two cases there was no formal written contract. The contract was
implied by the court. Even so the contractual licences were not held to be
indeterminate and terminable at the whim and will of the owner of the
property. Such is the nature of licence in equity.  
  
**_Rules of construction of contract_**

****

Before examining the opposing contentions of the parties it is fit to comment
on the adjectival aspect of the case. It was begun by way of an originating
summons. That was the correct procedure because the true concern of this case
is the construction of the deed. As to the matrix of material facts necessary
for that exercise there was no disagreement. They were all in the affidavits.
In the event, it was converted into a writ action and came before me for
trial. Witnesses were called but to little avail. The plaintiff had stated in
his evidence in chief that `it was decided that the parties should enter into
a Deed to reflect the real position of the defendant with respect to the
property`. So the resolution of the case depended on what could be discovered
within the four corners of the deed. In this regard the following words of
Lord Wilberforce in **Reardon Smith Line v Hansen-Tangen** [1976] 3 All ER
570[1976] 1 WLR 989 at 996 are salutory:

> _When one speaks of the intention of the parties to the contract, one is
> speaking objectively - the parties cannot themselves give direct evidence of
> what their intention was - and what must be ascertained is what is to be
> taken as the intention which reasonable people would have had if placed in
> the situation of the parties._

  
  
Counsel for the defendant brought to the notice of the court the well-
established rule of construction that when in doubt a deed should be construed
against the grantor and in favour of the grantee. The underlying meaning of
this rule is that he who gives must give completely. However, when the words
of the deed are clear it is unnecessary to invoke the assistance of this rule.  
  
**_The decision_**

****

A careful reading of the deed reveals that the deed created a contractual
licence as it is understood by equity lawyers today. It is not revocable at
the whim and will of the plaintiff. It is not a licence for an indefinite
period but one with inbuilt limitations. It is the kind of licence which a man
would extract from his son to whom he gives the property as a gift but wants
to ensure that his wife has a roof over her head during her life. A court of
equity will not view it as a bare licence terminable at the will of the son
and turn out his mother.  
  
There was a contractual licence because right of occupation was created by a
deed signed, sealed and delivered by the plaintiff and the defendant. It was a
formal document executed with a serious intention. More importantly the
parties acted on the terms of the deed for more than ten years. It provided
for reciprocal rights and obligations. The defendant provided consideration by
foregoing forever her right to make any claim adverse to the interests, rights
and title of the plaintiff; by undertaking to expend money to keep the
property in good repair; and by undertaking to pay a rental of $12 every year.  
  
The licence, however, was not coupled with an interest because the deed
explicitly said so. Even though the defendant was required to pay `rent it was
not a lease. The deed defined the right of occupation as a personal right. It
cannot be an interest in land. It cannot devolve or be transferred to another
party. Accordingly there can be no proprietary estoppel. Express words of the
deed excluded proprietary interest of every kind.  
  
The contractual licence is not revocable at will because there is an implied
irrevocability at will. The implication arises from the fact that the deed
defines the circumstances giving the right to end the right of occupation. If
those circumstances cannot be established it is to last for the life-time of
the defendant.  
  
Karthigesu JA said in **Neo Hock Pheng v Teo Siew Peng** [1999] 2 SLR 45  that
a licence for an indefinite period is terminable at will. That proposition was
clearly established by the **_Winter Garden Theatre_** case. Indefinite
agreements, like contracts for service, partnership and the like are as a rule
terminable at will. Ultimately, however, the question of revocability is one
of construction of the contract. Thus, in **Llanelly Rly and Dock Co v London
and North-Western Rly Co** [1873] LR 8 Ch 942 it was held that a perpetual
licence was not terminable at will. This was principally because the huge
lumpsum consideration of o40,000 went against terminability at will. It was
otherwise in the **_Winter Garden Theatre_** case. This is not the case of a
licence for an indefinite and indeterminate period. It would have been so had
the plaintiff not executed the deed and let the defendant occupy the property
without any specific arrangement. An indefinite and indeterminate licence
would be inconsistent with the contents of the deed which defines the extent
and character of the right of occupation. The latter being real the former
must be false.  
  
In the result, I would settle this case by applying the doctrine of sanctity
of contract. The law must hold a man to the contract he has made. By that
doctrine I hold that the plaintiff cannot revoke the licence he has granted to
the defendant save in accordance with the terms of the deed. The defendant
accordingly is a contractual licence and as such is entitled to a right of
occupation of No 4 Jalan Lada Puteh, Singapore. This is without prejudice to
the rights of the plaintiff to evict her in future if she were in breach of
the terms of the deed. In the result the plaintiff had no entitlement to end
the licence and eject the defendant at his whim and will. The notice to quit
accordingly had no legal effect.  
  
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that if the court decided against him
there should be a further hearing as to the terms that should be imposed. I
cannot accede to that prayer because this is a case of enforcing the terms of
a deed. The court cannot rewrite the clear terms of the contract.  
  
**Outcome:**

Plaintiff`s claim dismissed.
