Background

**

1\. This case arises out of the third phase of the construction of the Seletar
Sewage Treatment Works (the project). The main contractor for the project was
Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd (Hyundai). Hyundai engaged Vatten
International Pte Ltd (Vatten), the defendants, as their painting
subcontractors and Vatten in turn appointed Chan Hong Seng Engrg & Const Pte
Ltd (CHS), the plaintiffs, as their sub-subcontractors for almost the whole of
the painting works. Vatten was, in effect, a one man company. They had no
workers or even much expertise and they relied entirely on sub-sub-contractors
like CHS to carry out their contractual obligations to Hyundai.

2\. In the contract awarded to Vatten, the price of the painting works was
fixed at $1,562,117.62. In the subcontract, the price of the works was fixed
at $1,253,113, a sum amounting to approximately 80% of the price Vatten would
be paid. The subcontract sum was based on a quotation sent by CHS to Vatten
containing its rates for the various items that made up the painting works.

3\. The subcontract was evidenced by the letter of intent dated 11 January
1997 issued by Vatten. This was almost identical to the letter of intent dated
28 December 1996 which Hyundai had issued to Vatten. For the purposes of the
subsequent dispute, the most important term of the subcontract is clause 1
which reads as follows:

> > 1\. TERMS OF PAYMENT
>>

>> The "Cut Off Date for the application for Interim Payment shall be the 13th
of each Calendar Month.

>>

>> Payment shall be based upon CHS Application for Interim Payment for work
done and for cost of materials on Site (suppliers invoices to be submitted)
but will be revised in accordance with the amount of related monies received
by VFI [ie Vatten] from HYUNDAI. Such payment shall be made within Ten (10)
working days of receipt by VFI of such monies.

>>

>> It is a Condition Precedent to the payment of any monies by VFI to CHS that
CHS shall deposit a Performance Bond acceptable to VFI with VFP equivalent to
Five (5) Percent of the Sub-Contract Price.

>>

>> The payments by VFI to CHS shall be subject to Five (5) Percent Retention.

4\. In accordance with the above term, CHS duly furnished Vatten with a
performance bond from ING General Insurance International NV in the sum of
$60,000.

5\. Although the subcontract was entered into in 1997, the painting works only
commenced sometime in January 1999. Work continued until October 2000. At that
stage, there was a dispute between the parties. On or about 14 October 2000,
Vatten called on the bond furnished by CHS and received payment of $60,000
thereunder. On 18 October 2000, Vatten terminated the subcontract on the basis
that CHS had already repudiated it by stopping work. Whether CHS had in fact
stopped work and if so, whether they were justified in doing so, are two of
the issues to be considered in this case.

6\. This action was commenced on 14 December 2000. By it the plaintiffs, CHS,
are claiming:

> (1) the sum of $560,392.24 (or such sum as the court may determine to be
> due) as the unpaid balance due in respect of works done under the
> subcontract; alternatively, the value of the works done on a _quantum
> meruit_ and/or _quantum valebat_ basis;

> (2) the sum of $3,284.11 for loss of profit on the value of the remaining
> works; alternatively, damages to be assessed;

> (3) the sum of $15,035 being the value of plant and materials belonging to
> the plaintiffs which Vatten, the defendants, took possession and control of;
>
> (4) a declaration that Vatten deliver up to CHS the lorry which Vatten took
> possession and control of;
>
> (5) damages to be assessed for the cost of rental of the said lorry from 1
> December 2000 until the lorry is returned to CHS; and
>
> (6) the sum of $60,000 by way of restitution or account being the money
> received by Vatten from the call on the performance bond.

7\. Vatten is both contesting the claim and making a counterclaim. They allege
that CHS did not carry out the subcontract works with reasonable skill and
care and did not complete the works to the extent asserted. Vatten avers that
they suffered loss and damage in order to rectify the breaches of CHS. They
had to engage another contractor to complete and rectify CHS work. They had
also overpaid CHS and are entitled to reimbursement of the amount overpaid.
Vatten claims the return of these monies and damages to be assessed.

**

Issues

**

8\. In their closing submissions, CHS set out a list of the issues to be
determined in this case. Vatten has accepted most of those issues as being the
relevant ones while adding some of their own. In the result, the issues to be
decided are:

> (1) whether there was a change in the rates under the subcontract resulting
> from the change in the paint to be used for the internal plastered walls
> (including beams, columns, staircases, etc) from Super V-Tex Emulsion to
> Aclose AA Emulsion;

(2) whether Vatten had breached their payment obligation to CHS;

(3) was Vattens termination of subcontract on 18 October 2000 wrongful;

(4) what was the value of the works done by CHS as at 18 October 2000;

(5) whether there were defects in CHS works in respect of which Vatten is
entitled to a set-off;

(6) whether Vatten is entitled to charge CHS for the cost of spark tests
carried out by Hyundai;

> (7) whether there was an agreement that CHS was to effect the textural
> painting of the digesters at the rate of $9 per square metre;

(8) whether Vatten seized plant and material belonging to CHS;

> (9) whether CHS is entitled to a restitution of and/or an account of monies
> paid to Vatten under the performance bond; and
>
> (10) if the issues relating to termination of the contract are decided in
> Vattens favour, whether Vatten is entitled to interlocutory judgment for
> damages.

Issues (5), (6), (7) and (10) are issues arising from Vattens defence and
counterclaim.

**

Issue 1 : change of rates for internal walls

**

9\. In the quotation that CHS submitted to Vatten, they had quoted the
following rates for painting internal surfaces:

| _Description of classes_ |  | _Quoted Rates_  
---|---|---|---  
(1) | Prepare and apply one undercoat and two finishing |  | $2.20 per m2  
| coats of acrylic emulsion paint internally, to plastered |  |   
| walls, beams, columns, etc |  |   
|  |  |   
(2) | Ditto, to plastered walls, beams, |  | $1.80 per metre run  
| columns etc of width not exceeding 300mm |  |   
|  |  |   
(3) | Ditto, to plastered walls, beams,  |  | $2.00 per metre run  
| columns etc of width 300mm - 1m  
  
In their final submissions, CHS asserted that these rates had by agreement
been revised to $2.85 per m, $2.34 per metre run and $2.56 per metre run
respectively.

10\. Vattens submission was that CHS was not entitled to claim the higher
rates for their work because first, they had not pleaded an agreed variation
in the rates and, secondly, on the evidence no variation had in fact been
agreed to.

11\. I must first consider the pleadings. The re-re-amended statement of claim
contains two paragraphs that are relevant to this issue. First there is 2
which simply states that "by a contract dated 11 January 1997, the defendants
subcontracted the painting works for the project to the [plaintiffs] at a
contract sum of $1,253,113". This paragraph does not contain any breakdown of
the works or the applicable rates. Subsequently in 15 the plaintiffs state
that as at 18 October 2000 they had carried works to the value of
$1,398,235.88, particulars of which are set out in Appendix 1. In Appendix 1 a
description of all the works done is given and for the internal works the
rates are stated as being $2.85 per m for the ceiling and wall finishes, $2.65
per metre run for the columns, and $2.45 per metre run for the beams. There is
no express statement anywhere in the statement of claim that these rates are
variations of originally agreed rates.

12\. By 2 of the re-re-amended defence, the defendants admit 2 of the
statement of claim except that they assert that CHSs quotation dated 11 June
1996 and the enclosed bill of quantities also form part of the contract. In 25
the defendants go on to state that 15 of the statement of claim is denied and
by 27 (a) the defendants assert that "some of the rates used by the plaintiffs
were not agreed upon". There is no other paragraph in the defence which deals
with the rates or which identifies those rates which were allegedly not agreed
upon.

13\. CHS filed a re-amended reply and defence to counterclaim and by 2 of this
pleading they aver that the rates set out in Appendix 1 of their statement of
claim are the applicable rates.

14\. Although the pleadings are not ideal, in my opinion they sufficiently
disclose to the parties and the Court the dispute over the applicable rates.
CHS had from the beginning indicated clearly what it considered these to be by
specifying each rate in Appendix 1. Vatten had responded to the rates put
forward by CHS by stating that some of these rates were not agreed. Whilst the
defence did not specifically identify the items in dispute or assert what the
correct rates for those items were, that inadequacy in the pleading, which
could have been redressed by a request for further and better particulars, did
not change the fact that issue had been joined as to whether the rates claimed
had been agreed. This issue was made even more clear by the re-amended reply
by which CHS reiterated the applicable rates being those set out in Appendix 1
of the statement of claim. In the premises I consider that Vattens objection
to this issue that the pleadings do not raise the issue is not made out. The
present case is distinguishable on its facts from the cited authority of _Tan
Kia Poh v Hong Leong Finance Ltd_[1994] 1 SLR 270 on which Vatten relied.

15\. I should also point out that Vatten was fully aware of exactly which
rates were in dispute and no surprise was occasioned by the raising of this
issue. Vattens counsel cross-examined the managing director of the plaintiffs,
Mr Tan Geok Chen (GC Tan), at length on this issue. Secondly, the body of
evidence in respect of the change in the rates was let in without objection by
the defendants.

16\. The second question is whether in fact any variation was agreed to and,
if so, the quantum of that variation. As noted above, the original rates for
the three classes of work which involved internal painting were $2.20, $1.80
and $2.00. In Appendix 1 the respective rates for these three items were
claimed to be $2.85, $2.45 and $2.65. In CHSs closing submissions however the
revised rates were claimed to be $2.85, $2.34 and $2.56. The rates in the
submissions were based on the figures found in a Sub-Contract Interim
Certificate issued by Vatten in December 1999. CHS adopted the rates used by
Vatten in this certificate and submitted that those rates were the best
evidence available to prove the agreed revised rates.

17\. The evidence of Mr GC Tan was that when the original quotation for the
painting works was submitted to Vatten, CHS had quoted for the internal works
on the basis that the paint to be used would be Super V-Tex Emulsion. After
the painting works commenced some two years later, the paint for the internal
plastered walls was changed to Aclose AA Emulsion which is a more expensive
paint as it is a weather-shield emulsion paint. Mr Tan stated that when the
change in paint was made he had a discussion with Jimmy Lim Chap Heng, Vattens
alter ego, and the parties agreed to a corresponding change in the rates for
the work. It was agreed that 65 cents would be added to each of the originally
quoted rates to obtain the new rates. That was why CHS had subsequently billed
for the work at the rates of $2.85, $2.45 and $2.65 instead of $2.20, $1.80
and $2.00.

18\. The change in paint did not affect only the rates charged by CHS to
Vatten. Mr Lim admitted during cross examination that Hyundai had agreed to
adjust upwards the rates that Vatten could charge it for the internal paint
works. The interim certificate issued by Hyundai to Vatten for work done up to
January 1999 shows that in respect of painting of the internal walls the rates
applied were $2.73, $2.23 and $2.48. The certificate Hyundai issued for the
work done up to March 1999 shows that these three rates had subsequently been
adjusted to $3.80, $3.10 and $3.45 respectively.

19\. Although admitting that he had been able to obtain a change of rates from
Hyundai to reflect the increase in the cost of paint to be used internally, Mr
Lim denied that he had in turn agreed to an adjustment of CHSs rates for the
same work. His denial that there was any adjustment at all was contradicted by
a Sub-Contract Interim Certificate in respect of the plaintiffs works which Mr
Lim himself prepared for the month of December 1999. In that certificate the
rates applicable for the three classes of internal painting work were stated
to be $2.85, $2.34 and $2.56 respectively. Mr Lim was questioned about the
certificate. Mr Lims explanation for writing the rates this way was that he
had made a mistake in that he had followed the rates inserted in CHSs own
claim dated 29 December 1999. However, as was then demonstrated to the
witness, although CHSs claim of 29 December 1999 did contain the first rate of
$2.85 it did not contain the other two rates of $2.34 and $2.56. When
confronted with that, Mr Lim sought to explain that he had arrived at these
other two rates by calculation. That was an odd explanation since Vattens
stand is that the original rates of $1.80 and $2.00 for these two classes are
the applicable rates. If that was the case there would have been no need of
any recalculation. It is also notable that at an earlier stage in his evidence
Mr Lim had said that he really did not know how he had come up with the rates
of $2.34 and $2.56 and that he may "have keyed in the wrong figures". A simple
mistake in keying in figures seems unlikely since the figures of $2.34 and
$2.56 were not inserted only once but appear many times in Vattens Interim
Certificate of December 1999.

20\. In their closing submissions, Vatten submitted that the CHS claim in
Appendix 1 was not consistent with their closing submission on the applicable
rates. The claim in Appendix 1 was based on Mr Tans assertion as to the agreed
rates whereas the closing submission was based on the certificate issued by
Vatten itself. Vatten also referred to their letter of 24 January 2000 to CHS
wherein Mr Lim had, among other things, informed CHS that they should ensure
that their claimed prices were the same as their offered prices in the June
1996 quotation. Counsel sought to make much of the fact that CHS had not
replied to this assertion and that originally they had had no objections to
this letter being part of the agreed bundle but that just two days before the
trial CHS had objected to admissibility of the letter. It was submitted that
CHS had tried to prevent the letter from being admitted because they knew that
its contents were detrimental to their case as the letter was clear evidence
that Vatten had not agreed to the higher rates claimed by CHS. If there had
been an agreement to vary the rates Vatten would not have reminded CHS to keep
to the original rates.

21\. Having considered the evidence, I think that there was a change in the
agreed rates for the internal painting works. It was not in dispute that the
original paint for the internal works was a cheaper paint than the weather-
shield paint subsequently specified. Hyundai had recognised the extra cost of
materials by adjusting the rates it paid Vatten and it is completely
consistent with this extra cost that CHS should have made a demand on Vatten
for an adjustment of its own rates. I also note that the original rates
applied to the original paint i.e. Super V-Tex Emulsion. CHS was not
contractually obliged to supply Aclose AA Emulsion at those rates. If Vatten
wanted the paint changed it had to negotiate a change in rates as well. It is,
accordingly, more than probable that the parties agreed to new rates for the
new paint. In this regard, Vattens letter of 24 January 2000 is not relevant
since the original quotation did not refer to Acclose AA Emulsion.
Additionally, I was not impressed with Mr Lims evidence relating to the
preparation of his certificate of December 1999. There was no reason for him
to insert any rates other than those originally quoted if there had been no
agreement on new rates. The very fact that the rates he typed in were
different from those quoted showed that he had agreed to changes in rates to
reflect the change in paint.

22\. The only question that remains is what the varied rates were. As pointed
out earlier, in closing CHS adopted the figures in Vattens December 1999
certificate. They had no other evidence apart from their own December 1999
progress claim as to what the agreed rates were since they did not confirm
these rates in writing or even, after the issue of the Vatten December 1999
interim certificate, dispute in writing the rates applied by Vatten. In these
circumstances I think it was correct of them to adopt the Vatten rates.
Vattens certificate is evidence of Vattens agreement to those rates. I do not
accept Mr Lims excuses for the insertion of those rates in the certificate. I
do not think he made any mistakes in inserting those rates. He inserted them
either because they had been agreed or because he believed that he could
persuade CHS to accept them. Accordingly on the issue of the rates for the
internal paint work I find in favour of CHS.

Issue 2: Had Vatten breached their payment obligations to CHS

**

23\. In 14 of the re-re-amended statement of claim the allegation was that in
breach of the subcontract, Vatten had persistently throughout the duration of
the subcontract underpaid CHS in respect of their progress claims or in
respect of the sums due to CHS from monies received by Vatten from Hyundai for
the work carried out by CHS. Particulars of this allegation were given by way
of the following table.

Progress Claims |  Payments From Defendants To Plaintiffs |  Payments From Hyundai To Defendants  
---|---|---  
Date |  Amount |  Date |  Invoice No |  Amount |  Date |  Amount  
- |  $70,299.24 |  23/03/99 Credit Note |  0203 VE01/0599 |  $30,835.73 -$7,419.34 |  06/04/99 |  $23,340.84 $22,259.92

22/04/00 |  $270,665.46 |  30/05/00 |  0322 |  $50,000.00 |  17/02/00 |  $125,101.58

|  |  |  |  |  21/09/00 |  $39,851.48  
|  |  |  |  |  18/10/00 |  $18,977.78  
  
24\. As can be seen from the table, from about July 1999 Vatten had received
much more money from Hyundai than it had paid CHS. By 21 July 1999, CHS had
submitted three progress claims totalling approximately $588,529.56; it had
been paid $133,416.39; and Vatten had received $242,888.47 from Hyundai. There
was a difference of approximately $109,000 between the amount received by
Vatten and the amount paid out by it. A month later, on 16 August 1999, Vatten
received a further $171,884.29 and on the same day it paid CHS $10,000 and a
further $150,000 four days later. By then therefore Vatten had received over
$414,000 and had paid out $293,416.39 increasing the difference to about
$121,000. The gap between payments received and payments made continued and by
the beginning of September 2000 Vatten had paid out something in the region of
$850,000 while having received approximately $1.29 million. This in itself
does not prove the plaintiffs case, however, since there was a difference in
the price that they quoted to Vatten and that which Vatten quoted to Hyundai
and also there were certain parts of the painting works (although minor ones)
which Vatten had not subcontracted to CHS.

25\. The evidence of Mr CG Tan on this part of the claim was that from time to
time the CHS had submitted its progress claims to Vatten for payment. These
claims were evaluated by Mr Tan following measurements of the painting works
carried out or completed from time to time. These measurements were taken by
Mr Tan Ah San, another director of CHS and Mr CG Tans brother. Mr CG Tan
conceded that the progress claims were not always submitted by the 13th day of
the month as had been agreed between the parties (in fact only one of the nine
claims submitted bears a date falling before the 13th day of the month in
question and the claims were not submitted at regular monthly intervals). He
said that the delay in submitting the claims was caused by delay of Mr Lim in
attending the joint measurement session and also by the fact that sometime in
April 1999 the submission date for the claims was changed to the 25th day of
each month at the request of Mr Lim.

26\. Mr Tan went on to assert that Vatten had never objected to nor strictly
insisted that progress claims be submitted by the 13th day of each month.
Vatten continued to make payment to CHS notwithstanding the late submission of
the progress claims. What happened was that after the submission of each
claim, Mr Lim would call Mr Tan and ask that CHS render an invoice for the
progress claim submitted in an amount dictated by Mr Lim. For example the
amount claimed in progress claim No.6 dated 26 November 1999 was $409,874.57
but Mr Tan was asked to render an invoice for $73,000. He was told that if
such an invoice was not rendered no payment would be made to the plaintiffs in
respect of that progress claim.

27\. From November 1999 onwards Vatten did not pay any attention to the
measurements taken by Mr Tan Ah San. Mr Lim would arbitrarily dictate amounts
to be paid to CHS. The amounts were much less than the value of the actual
works carried out but Mr Tan was warned by Mr Lim that if he did not accept
the dictated amounts CHS would not be paid. Mr Tan kept asking Mr Lim for
Hyundais certification of the works done from time to time. Mr Lim refused to
entertain these requests. The gross underpayments by Vatten adversely affected
CHS and caused them many problems in carrying out and completing the painting
works. In substantiating his assertions of gross underpayment, Mr Tan referred
to part of the table set out about ie that portion relating only to the
progress claims and invoices made by CHS and the payments received by them
from Vatten.

28\. When it came to submissions, the plaintiffs case changed. Their new focus
was on the obligation by Vatten under the sub-contract to pay CHS related
monies. It was pointed out that Mr Lim had accepted this as a contractual
obligation and that accordingly Vatten was obliged to pay CHS a proportion of
the monthly payments that Vatten itself received from Hyundai. CHS submitted
that its payment claims were irrelevant for consideration of the amount due to
it as this amount was determined solely by what Hyundai had determined was due
to Vatten based on Hyundais calculation of the work done to date.

29\. CHS submitted that that part of the subcontract dealing with the
submission of progress claims by CHS on a monthly basis became redundant and
had been waived by Vatten as there was already a mechanism in place to
determine the quantity of work done at the end of each month. They relied on
the following evidence:

(1) Mr Lims admission that progress claims were only estimates of the quantity
of work done each month;

(2) His further admission that the purpose of the submission by CHS of
progress claims was to enable Vatten to make similar submissions to Hyundai;

(3) That in fact Hyundai had six quantity surveyors to survey and quantify the
painting works done by CHS and that Vatten had left it to Hyundai to work out
the monthly quantities. Mr Kim Suk Chul, a planning engineer employed by
Hyundai who was engaged in preparing interim certificates for the painting
works for this project, testified that Vatten had left it entirely to Hyundai
to work out the quantities and had thereafter accepted the quantities so
calculated. Mr Lim had never disputed any of these quantities although he was
entitled under the contract to dispute them if he disagreed with the
calculation.

30\. CHS put their case on underpayment in the following way. First they
identified the three areas of additional work which had not been done by them,
namely, the painting works for the chemical store, the digesters and the GRC
fins. Then they noted that since the first evaluation of the work at the GRC
fins was done in September 2000 and it took two months after certification for
Hyundai to pay Vatten, the payments made by Hyundai to Vatten before 18
October 2000 did not include the painting of the fins. Thirdly they relied on
Mr Lims admission that in respect of payments for interim certificates Nos
1-14, the "related monies" received by Vatten from Hyundai were all in respect
of the plaintiffs works.

31\. Using the above points to evaluate the payments made by Hyundai to
Vatten, CHS submitted that the amount of "related monies" received by Vatten
from Hyundai in respect of the plaintiffs works in certificates Nos 10-18 were
as follows :

Certificate No |  Work done up till end |  Date issued |  Date paid |  Cumulative Gross Amount ($) |  Chemical Store |  Digerster |  Cumulative "Related Monies" ($)

32\. CHS then stated that in December 1999 Vatten had worked out the monies
payable to CHS from the monies received from Hyundai and reflected these in a
certificate of sub-contract interim payment. That certificate showed that the
payment due to CHS for works certified up to the end of November 1999 was
$624,877.68. During cross examination, Mr Lim agreed that if this amount of
$624,877.68 were to be divided by the sum of $829,919.45 (the amount received
by Vatten from Hyundai for work up to end November 1999), a factor of 0.7529
would be obtained.

33\. CHS went on to argue that in respect of certificate No 18 and on the
assumption that the revised rates for the three classes of work for the
internal walls applied, Mr Lim had worked out the corresponding value of CHSs
work as being $1,006,099.10. On that basis the "related monies" paid by
Hyundai for certificate No 18 had been worked out by the plaintiffs in the
table at paragraph 33 above to be $1,296,236.83. If the corresponding value of
$1,006,099.10 given by Mr Lim is divided by the "related monies" of
$1,296,236.83 received from Hyundai, a factor of 0.7761 is obtained.

34\. CHS then submitted that the corresponding value of their works from end
November 1999 (certificate No 10) to end July 2000 (certificate No 18) when
divided by the "related monies" received by Vatten from Hyundai must be a
factor within the bounds of 0.7529 and 0.7761. They then stated that if the
lower factor of 0.7529 were to be adopted for certificates Nos 11-17 the value
of the plaintiffs works would be as follows :

> > > > > Cert No |  Cumulative "Related Monies" ($) |  Factor |  Cumulative Value of Plaintiffs Works ($)  
>>>>> ---|---|---|---  
>>>>> 10 |  829,919.49 |  0.7529 |  624,877.68

>>>>> 18 |  1,296,236.83 |  0.7761 |  1,006,099.10  
  
35\. Using this same factor CHS worked out the amount by which they had been
underpaid. The detailed calculations were shown in Appendix 1 of the
plaintiffs submissions and are summarised in the following table:

Certificate No | Date Defendants received payment | Amount of Underpayment by Defendants ($)  
---|---|---  
11 |  29.02.00 |  3,069.10  
12 |  24.03.00 |  8,590.27  
13 |  18.04.00 |  16,115.56  
14 |  19.05.00 |  65,412.18  
15 |  03.07.00 |  93,207.06  
16 |  21.07.00 |  92,487.29  
17 |  24.08.00 |  89,782.39  
18 |  21.09.00 |  118,749.06  
  
36\. CHS concluded their submission on this point by stating that underpayment
by Vatten had increased over time. In May 2000, the under payment was in
excess of $65,000. By July 2000 it was in excess of $90,000 and by September
2000 it was in excess of $118,000. Therefore there had been persistent
underpayment by Vatten.

37\. In response to the above submissions, the defendants drew the courts
attention to the fact that the original claim made by CHS was that Vatten had
breached the contract by failing to pay CHS the amount of $220,666.47
contained in one progress claim, that of 20 July 2000. On the first day of the
hearing, CHS amended their statement of claim and inserted the allegation in
14 that Vatten had underpaid them in respect of ten progress claims. Eight
days later they applied to re-amend 14 so that it averred that the alleged
underpayments related to either the progress claims or the related monies from
Hyundai. By the time of the closing submissions CHS had abandoned the issue of
the progress claims altogether and, as has been indicated earlier, relied only
on the alleged underpayments in respect of the related monies.

38\. Vatten submitted that the two amendments made in the course of the
hearing supported their contention that the plaintiffs allegations were not
based on facts but were motivated by the need to bolster a weak case. They
submitted that the table produced by CHS (reproduced in 36 above) showing the
amount of alleged underpayments by Vatten was untenable as it was based on
projections obtained by using a "factor" of 0.7529 instead of being based on
evidence. Further, the figures in that table had not been adduced in evidence
by any of the plaintiffs witnesses and Vatten had no opportunity to cross
examine those witnesses on the figures. Nor was defence counsel able to put
those figures to the plaintiffs witnesses. In addition, since the figures in
the table were not pleaded and were quite different from the amounts of the
alleged underpayments in fact pleaded by the plaintiffs in the further and
better particulars filed by them on 6 August 2001, the court could not, and
should not, accept them as part of the plaintiffs case.

39\. Before I can decide whether there was persistent underpayment by Vatten,
I have to establish exactly what Vattens payment obligations under the sub-
contract were. The relevant contractual term is cl 1. This provides, in part
that payment shall be based upon CHS application for interim payment for work
done and for cost of materials on site but will be revised in accordance with
the amount of related monies received by Vatten from Hyundai. No direct
submission on the meaning of this provision was made by CHS.

40\. Having considered the clause objectively, it appears to me that the
intention behind it was that CHS would submit a claim for payment at monthly
intervals based on the work done on site during the previous month and on the
materials purchased. Using this as a basis, Vatten would submit their own
claim to Hyundai who would then calculate the amount due based on the rates
which Vatten had quoted it and its own measurement and evaluation of the work
done and materials on site. Hyundai would then pay Vatten in accordance with
such assessment and, it appears to me, the clause contemplated that Vatten
would be able to work out from the payment how the assessment had been made
and revise the amount payable to CHS on the basis of CHSs rates for the work
accepted by Hyundai. Contrary to the submission made on behalf of the
plaintiffs, there was nothing in the sub-contract which obliged Vatten to pay
CHS a certain percentage of each payment received from Hyundai or to calculate
the amount payable to CHS based on any particular factor. The only way that
such an argument could work is if such an obligation was implied by the use of
the term related monies. The term related monies does not however have any
particular legal meaning and no evidence was given by CHS that as between the
parties it was understood to have a particular meaning in terms of the exact
percentage of Hyundais payments that had to be passed on to CHS.

41\. It therefore appears to me that in order to establish a claim for
persistent underpayment, CHS would have to show what exactly it was entitled
to based on the work done as assessed and paid for by Hyundai. It did not do
this. As I stated earlier an examination of the table in 14 of the statement
of claim and reproduced in 23 above, shows that there was at times quite a gap
between what Vatten received and what it paid out. However, as I also stated
earlier, this in itself did not prove the plaintiffs case because of the
difference in prices between the main contract and the sub-contract. In this
regard it was Mr Lims evidence that his profit margin varied depending on the
items of work: in some cases it was 19% and in others it reached as high as
41%. As submitted by Vatten, it was also noteworthy that the basis of the
plaintiffs claim for underpayment in this action changed several times in the
course of the action and ended up being based on a premise which had neither
appeared during the trial nor been pleaded ie that payments from Vatten to CHS
had to be made in accordance with a consistent factor of at least 0.7529.

42\. The change in the plaintiffs case was also evidenced by the affidavit
filed by Mr CG Tan. I have set out his evidence at length above. There he
referred to the progress claims and stressed his complaint that Vatten
insisted on paying arbitary amounts which were much less than the value of the
actual works carried out by CHS on site. He referred to a table showing and
comparing the progress claims submitted by CHS and the payments made by Vatten
and said that it was apparent from this that Vatten had always grossly
underpaid CHS. In court too, Mr Tan reiterated that the allegations of
underpayment were made in relation to the progress claims submitted by CHS to
Vatten because of the comparison as shown in the table. Mr Tan did not base
his complaints on Vattens failure to pay CHS the related monies or any
particular proportion of the payments they received from Hyundai. His evidence
supported a case based on underpayment of the plaintiffs progress claims and
not one based on underpayment of related monies from Hyundai. It is clear
therefore that when his affidavit was prepared the plaintiffs were proceeding
on a different basis to that which they eventually adopted. CHS must, however,
have realised in the course of the trial that it would be difficult to succeed
on the original basis since Mr Tan admitted that all along the CHS progress
claims were not accurate and were submitted simply for show and for Mr Lims
approval. That must have been one of the reasons why the pleadings were
amended and, in the final submissions, the issue of underpayment of progress
claims was dropped altogether.

43\. In my judgment, the plaintiffs have not established their allegation of a
persistent underpayment by the defendants nor any clear basis for such an
allegation.

**

Issue 3: Was Vattens termination of the subcontract on 18 October 2000
wrongful?

**

44\. The plaintiffs submission that Vatten acted wrongfully in terminating the
subcontract on 18 October 2000 is based on the following propositions:

(1) that Vatten had persistently underpaid them; and/or

(2) Vatten had no ground to terminate the subcontract because CHS:

(a) had not abandoned the works; or

(b) had justified to Vatten the reason for not being able to carry out further
works; or

(c) had substantially completed the subcontract works.

I do not need to deal with the first proposition as I have already found that
the plaintiffs have not proved their allegation of persistent underpayment.

45\. On 18 October 2000, Messrs Wee Tay & Lim, Vattens solicitors, wrote to
CHS. The material part of this letter read:

> We have been instructed that you were engaged by our clients as a sub-
> contractor to do the painting works for Seletar Sewage Treatment Works Phase
> III ("the Project").
>
> We have also been instructed that you have acted in breach of your
> obligations under the sub-contract and have stopped work.
>
> Our clients therefore treat your refusal to complete the works as a
> repudiation of the sub-contract. Our clients accept your repudiation. They
> will engage another sub-contractor to rectify your breaches and complete the
> work, and will seek damages against you.

It is common ground that if CHS had indeed stopped work without a sufficient
justification, it would have acted in breach of the subcontract and Vatten
would have been justified in terminating the subcontract. The dispute is over
whether CHS did stop work and secondly, if it did so, whether it could justify
its action as being caused by Vattens default.

46\. According to Mr Lim, on 5 October 2000, the plaintiffs representative on
site, Mr Tan Ah San, informed him that CHS had stopped work. Mr Tan did not
give Mr Lim any reason for the stoppage. The next day, Mr Lim wrote to CHS
stating that he wished to put on record that he had been informed by their
site representative Ah San on 5 October that CHS had stopped work at the
project. Mr Lim said that he could not understand and could not see any reason
for this action. He asked CHS to justify. Vatten sent this letter out by fax
and received two replies both written on the bottom of their own letter which
was faxed back to them. The first one, written on 7 October, stated in
English:

Sir,

> We have to stop work because we had not received the progress payment dued
> _(sic)_ from you in time. Our works and material suppliers are all waiting
> for their payment.

We will resume work once the payment is made.

We wish you to look into this urgent matter closely. Thank you.

The second reply was written in Mandarin and dated 10 October 2000\. It said:

You are the boss.

> Give money, start work straightaway. Because no money to pay wages. (No
> money to buy materials) Make payment everything can, O.K. (No money to buy
> papers to issue invoices.)

In cross-examination, Mr GC Tan was shown both these replies and he confirmed
that by them, CHS had explained to Vatten that they had to stop work because
they had not received the progress payment in time. He also confirmed that in
the second reply, that written on 10 October, there had been no denial that
the plaintiffs had stopped work on the project.

47\. Initially, the plaintiffs position in relation to the work stoppage was
not in conflict with that of the defendants. In the statement of claim
endorsed on the writ, CHS asserted that the refusal by Vatten to make full
payment of their progress claim dated 20 July 2000 for the sum of $220,666.47
had severely affected their ability to carry on work on the project. In the
original 10 CHS stated that they had had to stop work because of this as they
were unable to make corresponding payments to their paint supplier, Messrs DNT
Singapore Pte Ltd and their own workers. This was an admission on the part of
CHS and this admission was repeated in the following paragraph when CHS
averred that by their letter of 7 October 2000 they informed Vatten that they
had to stop work because of Vattens failure to make payment and that they had
assured Vatten that work could resume once payment was received.

48\. Six months later, however, on the first day of the hearing, CHS applied
to amend 10 of the statement of claim. The amendment in effect retracted the
admission that work had been stopped because it stated that the work that was
stopped was work in new areas and did not include touch-up work which the
plaintiffs continued to do until they were forcibly ejected from the site on
18 October 2000.

49\. Along with the amendments to the statement of claim came amendments to
the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of both Mr GC Tan and his brother, Mr Tan
Ah San. In the original version, both men had stated that on 18 October 2000,
although the plaintiffs were hampered in their ability to carry out painting
works on new areas, while three workers of the plaintiffs were on their way to
carry out minor touch-up works on the door frames at Batteries A&B area, the
defendants had forcibly ejected the workers from the site. In the amended
version, the three workers were not on the way to do the touch-up works but
were actually doing touch-up works at a different location, the Inlet Area,
when they were forcibly ejected from the site. In the witness box, Mr GC Tan
explained that when he had made his affidavit he had not asked his workers
what had actually happened. Subsequently, he had clarified the date with them
and found out that on 18 October they were at the Inlet Area whereas they had
been around Batteries A&B on 16 and 17 October 2000. Mr Tan Ah San stated that
the change in the evidence was because of a misunderstanding on his part as to
what he had been told by the workers. He had passed the misinformation on to
his brother and that was why Mr GC Tans first affidavit had the wrong data.
This was only corrected when Mr Tan Ah San asked the workers again as to what
had happened. He confirmed that his evidence was based on what the worker
Ponniah Arumugam had told him.

50\. In support of the amended version of the facts, CHS called their worker,
Mr Ponniah Arumugam. He stated that he was a painter working on the project
from 15 March 1999 to 18 October 2000. He confirmed that in the month of
October 2000, he did painting works at the site everyday (except perhaps on 1
and 6 October 2000 which were Sundays) with two other workers. The painting
works were mainly touch-up works. Specifically, on 15, 16 and 17 October 2000,
the three men had carried out touch-up works at the Inlet Area from about 8 am
in the morning until about 7 pm at night. On 18 October at about 8.30 am while
the three were working at the Inlet Area, they were stopped by security
personnel and asked to leave the site. They were then escorted to the security
post at the entrance to the site. From the post, Mr Ponniah called Mr Lim on
the telephone and told him what had happened. Mr Lim said that the painting
works were finished already and asked Mr Ponniah to leave the site
immediately. Mr Ponniah had no choice but to leave the site.

51\. The oral evidence that CHS had continued work at the site after 5 October
by sending three workers to do touch-up works at various locations was
inconsistent with the two hand-written notes sent by CHS to Vatten on 7 and 10
October. If Vattens allegations were wrong and CHS had not stopped work, the
natural response would have been for CHS to deny the allegation and set the
record straight. However, CHS did the opposite: they confirmed that they had
stopped work.

52\. Secondly, the first two replies were hand-written ones and, perhaps,
could be explained away as having been written or dictated by Mr GC Tan in
ignorance of what was actually happening on site as he did not visit the site
but relied on his brother for information. Surely, however, the true position
would have become known within a reasonable time thereafter especially since
Vatten used the alleged work stoppage as their reason for terminating the
subcontract. It is interesting in this context that CHS did not take the
opportunity to set the record straight until the beginning of the trial some
eight months later.

53\. After the termination letter, many letters were written by CHS to Vatten
on various issues and on their claims against Vatten. The dates of these
letters were 27 October, 3 November, 7 November, 14 November, 17 November, 22
November and 1 December 2000. In none of these letters did CHS deny Vattens
allegation that they had stopped work on the project. In fact in the 1
December letter, CHS referred to their earlier reply of 7 October 2000 and
repeated verbatim the words of that reply. Whilst specifically affirming that
they had stopped work, CHS did not either in this letter or in any other
assert that the stoppage of work was in relation to new areas only and that
they had had three workers doing touch-up work in the old areas until these
workers were forcibly ejected from the site.

54\. I think that the contemporaneous correspondence must be given its due
weight. The letters that CHS wrote after the termination were not prepared by
either of its directors: neither of them were fluent in English. Instead, Mr
GC Tan sought the help of one Francis Teo Teng Siu in the preparation and
presentation of the plaintiffs claim against Vatten. Mr Teo is a quantity
surveyor and also a qualified lawyer. He has been admitted to the Bar in both
England and Singapore. He is the sole proprietor of Messrs Francis Teo &
Associates, a firm engaged in quantity surveying and contractual claims for
construction projects. Mr Teo was called by the plaintiffs as their expert
witness in this action and, on their behalf, reviewed the evaluation of the
plaintiffs works at the project that had been prepared by Vatten. In court, Mr
Teo confirmed that he had written all the letters that I have mentioned in 53
above and had advised Mr GC Tan in general on the plaintiffs claim.
Interestingly, Mr GC Tan in his evidence denied that Francis Teo had assisted
him in drafting those letters. He even went so far as to say that Mr Teo had
not given him any advice in respect of any of the letters and that in late
2000 Mr Teo had not advised CHS on their claim against Vatten.

55\. I do not accept Mr Tans evidence that the letters were written not by Mr
Francis Teo but by some friend of his also with the surname Teo whom he asked
to help because Mr Tan himself did not know how to write in English. Mr Tan
was not able to give the full name of the other Teo or any other details about
him. I find it significant that in these letters written by a quantity
surveyor with legal training who would have appreciated the consequences of an
unjustified stoppage of work by a contractor, it was never asserted that there
was no full stoppage and that work continued in some sort of fashion until the
plaintiffs workers were forcibly removed from the site.

56\. I do not accept the evidence of Mr Ponniah and the two Tan brothers that
Mr Ponniah and his co-workers were on the site until 18 October 2000. Sending
the workers to the site would have been totally inconsistent with the stand
taken by CHS in their letters of 7 and 10 October. Tellingly, CHS did not
protest in writing after their workers were allegedly illegally ejected from
the site. Further there was no independent evidence of the presence of these
workers on the site. On the contrary, such independent evidence as there was
supported Vattens stand that after 5 October none of CHS workers did any work
on the project. A joint site inspection took place on 13 October 2000. It was
attended by one Johnny Choo Seow Meng, a technical inspector for DNT Singapore
(DNT), the paint supplier. Mr Choos evidence was that during the two to three
hours he spent on the site that day, he did not see any workers carrying out
painting work on site. Whilst Mr Choo admitted that he could not have covered
every single part of the site during the inspection, it is likely that if
there had been three men painting, he would have noticed them. Another person
who attended the joint inspection was Mr Choy Wai Kong of Tech 3
International, the contracting firm that was employed by Vatten to take over
the plaintiffs work. Mr Choy also testified that he did not see any painters
during the site inspection.

57\. Tech 3 Internationals workers started work on the project on 17 October
2000. According to Mr Choy, he did not see any other painters on the site
after his workers commenced work. Neither did he receive reports from his
workers of other painters. Further, CHS itself did not complain to Vatten on
either 17 or 18 October that workers from another subcontractor were carrying
out painting works. If CHS was on the site and had not stopped work, it is
likely that they would have complained of someone else trying to muscle in on
their works. The entry of other subcontractors could not but interfere with
the plaintiffs works and affect their claim and thus any such entry would
almost automatically have drawn objections.

58\. I find therefore that on 5 October 2000, CHS had stopped work. The next
question is whether they were justified in doing so or whether the stoppage
constituted a repudiatory breach of the subcontract.

59\. CHS submitted that even if it was found that they had in fact stopped
work altogether on 5 October, they were entitled to rely on the defence that
Vatten had persistently underpaid them to excuse themselves from further
performance of the subcontract on the ground that such underpayments by Vatten
constituted a repudiatory breach of the subcontract by Vatten. They went on to
submit that even if in such circumstances their stoppage was a breach, since
Vattens persistent breaches in the form of underpayment had preceded and
caused the plaintiffs breach, it was the plaintiffs and not Vatten who had the
right to terminate the subcontract. Since Vatten did not have the right to
terminate the subcontract, they were in repudiatory breach when they issued
their termination letter. Since I have found that CHS has not proved
persistent underpayment by Vatten, the arguments based on that allegation must
fail.

60\. The alternative justification that CHS gave for stopping work was that as
stated in their reply of 7 October. They had to stop work because they had not
received the progress payment in time. Their workers and suppliers were
waiting for payment and work would be resumed once payment was made. CHS
asserted that they had not absolutely refused to carry out the work as they
had stated in their reply that they would resume work once payment was made.
By terminating the subcontract without warning and without regard to the
justification given by CHS, Vatten themselves were in repudiatory breach of
the subcontract.

61\. CHS relied on the following proposition of law from _Keating on Building
Contracts_(6th Ed) to support their arguments:

> Where one party has failed to perform a condition of the contract, the other
> party cannot rely on its non-performance if it was caused by his own
> wrongful acts. (at p 168)

62\. CHS had pleaded in 10 of their re-re-amended statement of claim that they
had had to stop work because they were unable to make corresponding payments
to the paint supplier and to their own workers. This pleading was a
reiteration of what was written in CHS reply of 7 October. In their
submissions CHS quoted this reply once again. The question is whether that
position was the true position.

63\. To support the plaintiffs stand that they were not able to pay their
paint supplier due to underpayment by Vatten, they produced a letter from DNT
dated 24 August 2000 referring to the latters account of the same date for the
sum of $449,299.19 out of which $412,884.56 was due for immediate payment. DNT
stated that the account was long overdue and gave CHS notice that unless they
received payment of the amount due within 14 days, they would commence legal
action.

64\. In court, Mr Tan was referred to this statement of account. He confirmed
that many of the items on the statement did not relate to the project. Instead
they were in respect of paint supplied for other projects that CHS had been
working on concurrently in 1999 and 2000. Mr Tan further agreed that despite
the threat in DNTs letter, the latter in fact trusted CHS and allowed them to
accumulate a large outstanding bill. This trust was also shown by the fact
that up to 18 September 2000, CHS was still ordering paint from DNT and DNT
continued to supply the paint ordered. Mr Tan confirmed that DNT had fulfilled
all CHS orders and that their letter of 24 August 2000 had only been a
warning. DNT trusted CHS because CHS ordered paint from them for all their
projects. When it was put to Mr Tan that it was not true that CHS had to stop
work because they could not make payment to DNT, his answer was If you dont
pay me the money, I cant survive. Workers wages, everything, we need to pay.
It would appear that whilst CHS did owe DNT a substantial amount of money,
much of this was for material supplied for other projects and that CHS was
not, as at 5 October 2000, in imminent danger of being sued by DNT for non-
payment.

65\. CHS did not produce any evidence of their inability to pay their workers.
Mr Ponniah Arumugam who was working for them in October 2000 was still
employed in May 2001 when he gave evidence in court. That fact is some
indication of the plaintiffs ability to hold on to their workers and
inconsistent with an inability to pay their workers. Overall, the evidence
does show that CHS was experiencing some cash flow problems around August to
October 2000 but not to the extent that continuing work on the project would
have pushed them over the edge financially. According to a schedule produced
by CHS, between January 1999 and September 2000, they had bought paint costing
some $534,000 from DNT for the project. During that period, they had also been
paid, according to their own calculations, $863,236.23 by Vatten. That sum was
enough to settle, if not all, a substantial part (at least half) of their
paint bill. The outstanding sum of $449,299.19 payable to DNT could not
therefore be attributable entirely or even substantially to underpayment by
Vatten.

66\. In any case, difficulty in settling ones suppliers and workers bills
would not justify breaching the subcontract by stopping work unless that
difficulty was caused by a pre-existing breach in its payment obligations by
Vatten. CHS accepted that one or two failures on the part of Vatten to make
payment of amounts due would not justify a work stoppage. That is why they had
submitted that there had been persistent underpayment and that the cumulative
effect of such underpayment was a breach on the part of Vatten indicating an
intention to repudiate the subcontract. Since that assertion of persistent
underpayment was not established, any difficulty that CHS experienced with
payments to their workers and suppliers could not be laid at Vattens door. I
find that CHS has not justified its work stoppage.

67\. The consequence of my findings up to this stage is that by stopping work
on 5 October 2000, CHS was repudiating the subcontract and therefore Vatten
was entitled to terminate it after CHS failed to resume work. The next point
raised by CHS that in fact their work stoppage could not be considered a
repudiation since by the time it occurred, the works under the subcontract had
been substantially completed, can be conveniently considered in conjunction
with the fourth issue which relates to the value of the plaintiffs works as at
18 October 2000.

**

Issue 4: What was the value of CHS work as at 18 October 2000 and had they by
then substantially completed the subcontract works?

**

68\. As an alternative, CHS asserted that the work stoppage did not constitute
a repudiatory breach of the subcontract because they had already substantially
completed their works. It appears to me from _Keating on Building
Contracts_(6th Ed, pp 78 84) that the doctrine of substantial performance in
building contracts applies to lump sum contracts and usually relates to
whether the contractor can claim payment of the lump sum price although he has
not completed the works or whether he has to make a claim for payment on a
quantum meruit basis. It is not usually applied to the issue of whether the
contractor was entitled to stop work before finishing all that had to be done.
In my view, if the contractor stops work and indicates that he is not prepared
to continue with the work although there is still work to be done, he would be
in breach of contract even if the outstanding work remaining incomplete is
only a small percentage of the total work under the contract, since someone
has to do that work.

69\. In discussing what is meant by substantial completion, Keating states
that One test to be applied is whether the work was "finished" or "done" in
the ordinary sense even though part of the work was defective. Here, it was
the plaintiffs case in their closing submissions that they had completed about
98% of the subcontract works by 18 October 2000. This submission has to be
contrasted with Mr Tans assertion during cross-examination that the amount of
work completed was 95% and the evidence adduced by the defendants on the
amount of outstanding works.

70\. As regards value, it is the plaintiffs case that as at 18 October, they
had carried out painting works in the quantities shown in the table annexed to
their letter of 27 October 2000 to Vattens solicitors. This showed the total
value of work done to be $1,398,235.88. It was worked out on the basis of the
plaintiffs pleaded rates for the internal painting works. Using the revised
rates of $2.85, $2.34 and $2.86, the value of the works was calculated at
$1,395,807.38. The plaintiffs claim for $557,963.74 (without GST) was
calculated as the difference between the value of the works and the sum of
$837,843.64 paid by Vatten (ie $863,236.23 less GST of $25,392.59).

71\. The plaintiffs evaluation of the works was based on their own
measurements of the works done up to 18 October 2000. Mr Tan Ah San confirmed
that he and his foreman, one Ah Chwee, had done the measurements on which the
evaluation was based. After completing the measurements he had passed them to
Mr GC Tan to work out the claim. It was asserted that the accuracy of the
measurements had not been challenged by Vatten save for what they considered
to be the lack of qualifications of Mr Tan Ah San and Ah Chwee. However, Mr
Francis Teo, the plaintiffs expert, had given evidence that to take
measurements of painting, no qualifications are needed it is very simple and
anyone can do it.

72\. The plaintiffs case on this issue faces some difficulties. As stated, the
assessment that 98% (or, alternatively, 95%) of the work had been completed
was based on the measurements taken by Mr Tan Ah San and Ah Chwee. Neither of
these persons had any technical qualifications (and Mr Tan Ah San had only
primary school education) and even Mr GC Tan admitted in the course of cross-
examination that all along the progress claims based on the measurements were
not accurate.

73\. The evidence adduced by the plaintiffs in support of their measurements
has to be balanced against that adduced by the defendants. Mr Kim of Hyundai
gave evidence that as of 30 September 2000, the extent of completion of the
painting works for the architectural items (as opposed to the civil work items
which had already been completed) was as follows:

(a) Inlet works 75.42%

(b) Batteries A&B 78.57%

(c) Sludge Processing Building 84.26%

(d) Power House 68.66%

(e) Digesters 32.14%

(f) Fuel Oil Storage 70.64%

(g) Transformer House 104.34%

(h) Additional Painting 90.51%

The painting works for the digesters and chemical store were not part of the
subcontract. Even taking out those items, the evidence of Mr Kim establishes
that the subcontract works were not 98% complete nor even 95% complete. The
level of completion varied. According to a document produced by Mr Kim,
overall, as at 30 September 2000, the architectural works were 87.72%
complete. In the course of Mr Kims cross-examination, it became clear that the
figure of 87.72% was an estimate and may not have been completely accurate.
What also emerged, however, was that quite a bit of painting works had to be
done after October 2000 and, as at the date of the hearing, there were still
some painting works being carried on.

74\. Another witness, Mr Choo of DNT, estimated that as at 13 October 2000,
about 20% of the architectural painting works for four buildings (Inlet works,
Batteries A&B, Sludge Processing Building and Power House) had not been
completed. Mr Hwang of Hyundai was also adamant that the architectural
painting works had not been completed by October 2000 although he was not able
to give an exact estimate of the amount of work outstanding.

75\. I accept the evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants in preference
to that proferred by the plaintiffs. Hyundai had the backup of a large
professional staff and they had to take measurements for their own progress
claims to the employer. There was no reason for Hyundai to take the part of
either the plaintiffs or the defendants or to lie about the substantial
completion of the work as at October 2000. Whilst the Hyundai certificates may
not have been completely accurate in terms of percentages, I accept the
witnesses testimony that the painting works remained incomplete when the
plaintiffs stopped work. As at that date it was not possible to say they were
finished or done in the ordinary sense.

76\. The plaintiffs have the burden of proving the assertion that the work was
substantially complete as of 18 October 2000 when they say they were forced to
leave the site. They have not discharged this burden. Mr Tan Ah Sans
measurements were not even regarded as completely reliable by his own brother.

77\. In terms of percentage of work completed, I have not been persuaded by
the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs. This finding also impacts on the
plaintiffs valuation of the work that they had done since that valuation was,
like their assessment of percentage of completed works, based on the
measurements of Mr Tan Ah San and Ah Chwee. The plaintiffs original valuation
was $1,395,807.38. An alternative valuation put forward at the trial was that
of Mr Francis Teo. He valued the work as being worth $1,275,000. In court Mr
Teo admitted that his valuation was based on the measurements taken by the
plaintiffs and also on a number of assumptions namely:

(a) that the information given to him by CHS about the quantity of paint was
correct;

(b) that the paint in question had been used for the project; and

(c) that the paint was not used for reapplication for areas that were
rejected.

Mr Teo admitted that he had no personal knowledge whether any of these
assumptions were in fact justified. Since he did no measurements of his own
and could not be sure of the quantities of paint used, it is not safe for me
to rely on Mr Teos valuation as an alternative basis for assessing the value
of the plaintiffs works.

78\. The position put forward by the defendants as to the value of the
plaintiffs works and the amounts due to them was as follows. As at 5 October
2000, Vatten had received payment for work done until 31 July 2000. This
payment was made by Hyundai on 21 September 2000\. Based on the quantities
certified by Hyundai and the original rates quoted by CHS, the sum of
$39,361.05 plus GST was due to CHS as at 5 October 2000. As no work was
carried out by CHS between 5 and 18 October 2000, the same amount was due to
CHS on 18 October. Vatten derived the sum of $39,961.05 from the following
calculation:

Total value of works: | $926,805.09  
---|---  
Less: |   
(a) 5% retention  | $ 46,340.25  
(b) Contra-charges  | _$ 9,613.61_  
| $870,851.23  
Add: 3% GST  | $ 26,125.54  
Less: |   
(c) Payments prior to August 2000 | $780,890.18+  
| GST ($24,926.71)  
(d) Payment on 1 August 2000 | $ 30,000.00 (incl. GST)  
(e) Payment on 1 September 2000  | _$ 20,000.00_ (incl. GST)  
Interim Amount due to Plaintiffs  | _$39,961.05 + GST_  
  
79\. I cannot accept the defendants submission. Whilst in October 2000, CHS
may only have been entitled to receive payment for work done up to the end of
July that year since that was all that Vatten itself had received from
Hyundai, this case was not commenced then. The action was started in mid
December 2000. By then Vatten should have received payment for work up to the
end of September 2000 since Hyundai had issued its status report on those
works on 10 November 2000, and, subject to Vattens rights of set off and
counterclaim, CHS would have been able to claim the monies due for their work
up to the same date, less the agreed retention sums. There is no dispute that
CHS did work on the site in August and September 2000. In these circumstances,
I do not think that it is correct for me to assess the plaintiffs work only up
to the end of July 2000 as contended by Vatten.

80\. Among the documents which CHS managed to obtain from Hyundai were the
latters subcontract interim progress payment status certificates for work done
up to 31 August 2000 and 31 October 2000. Attached to each certificate was a
summary for all works done as of the respective dates. Although I did not see
it, there must be a similar certificate and summary for work done up to 30
September 2000. Using this information and the rates payable to CHS for the
works done by them, Vatten should be able to calculate the value of the
plaintiffs works as of the end of September 2000 if not as of 5 October 2000.
I cannot do so. At this stage, therefore, I can only find that as at 5 October
2000 there was at least $39,961.05 + GST due to CHS on the basis of work
completed till the end of July and additional amounts due for the internal
painting works calculated according to the revised rates and for the extra
work done thereafter which must be separately assessed.

81\. CHS, on the basis that their employment had been wrongfully terminated by
Vatten, also put in a claim for damages for the loss of profit that they would
have earned had they been able to complete the works. CHS estimated that the
value of the remaining works was $21,894.04 and that on the basis of a profit
rate of 15%, they would have earned $3,284.11 on these works. Since I have
found that Vatten was entitled to terminate the plaintiffs employment because
of the latters breach, this claim for damages must fail.

**

Issue 5: Were there defects in CHS works in respect of which Vatten is
entitled to a set-off?

**

82\. The defendants claim a set-off in respect of the amount found to be due
to CHS for their work. They rely on clause 6 of the letter of intent which
provides that Vatten shall have the right to recover all their costs that
arise from non-acceptable work performed by CHS and the re-performing of such
work. I accept that if Vatten were able to prove that CHS had not performed
the work properly and Vatten incurred costs in remedying those defects, they
would be able to recover such costs. The problem here is that Vattens claim at
this stage is inchoate.

83\. In their submissions, the defendants pointed out that throughout the
course of the painting works, they had received many complaints from Hyundai
in relation to defects in the plaintiffs work. They gave a list of complaints
that they had received relating to bad workmanship and unsatisfactory works.
Vatten also stated that on 21 October 2000, after CHS left the site, Hyundai
wrote to Vatten to complain about defects in the work. They made remarks like
Final coat, colour no good and final coat no good in respect of various
buildings painted by CHS. However, they did not give specific details of any
of these defective works for example, the location and extent of the same, or
of the costs that they had incurred or would incur to remedy them.

84\. The plaintiffs response to the allegation of defective works was that
there was no credible evidence to establish the same. It was submitted that
all defects that had been noticed in the course of the work had been rectified
as and when they were pointed out. Mr Lim himself had agreed in cross-
examination that CHS was required to make good all defects to a particular
coating before the next coating was permitted to be applied. Further, the
contract required inspection and approval of each coating before CHS was
allowed to apply the next coat. It is also material that in respect of the
civil works the evidence was that all defects to them would have been
rectified before handover to the employer in October 2000. Even Mr Choy, the
subcontractor who took over after CHS stopped work, testified that he could
not recall seeing any defective works at the site when he inspected it in
October 2000.

85\. There was one specific assertion of damage caused by the plaintiffs
workers and that was in relation what were called the PSB labels on the doors.
In Vattens closing submission, it was stated that this matter was only
discovered after CHS had left the site and it would be taken up if
interlocutory judgment was granted to Vatten. No amount has been specified in
relation to this claim although there was a letter from Hyundai indicating
that they would be holding Vatten responsible for the replacement of the
damaged labels and all expenses incurred by Hyundai in this respect would be
deducted from Vattens price. CHS has responded to this claim by pointing out
that the first notification of it came on 21 October 2000, after they left the
site, and asserting any damage done was caused by the workers of the
replacement contractor.

86\. On the general issue of defects, Vatten has not made out their case. If
indeed there are any defects in the works done by CHS in respect of which
Vatten will have to incur costs in rectification, Vatten is free to bring a
claim for reimbursement as and when such defects materialise and/or the costs
are incurred. At present, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate any
damage caused to Vatten by reason of any inadequacy in the workmanship of CHS.
The same reasoning applies to the claim for damage to the PSB labels. As of
the date of the filing of the counterclaim, no monies had been deducted from
Vatten for this claim. The claim had not crystallised. If monies are
subsequently deducted and if Vatten can show that all or part of those monies
are attributable to damage caused by the plaintiffs workers, they can make a
claim against CHS at that stage.

**

Issue 6: Is Vatten entitled to charge CHS for the cost of spark tests carried
out by Hyundai?

**

87\. Section 3.3.5.3 of the specifications of the main contract between
Hyundai and the Government is entitled Amine Cured Coal Tar Epoxy Protective
Coating. It contains directions as to the type of coating to be used and how
it is to be applied. In sub-section 3.3.5.3.6 it is stated that When
completed, and again just before commissioning, coatings will be spark tested
as directed by the S.O. at a minimum of 2500 volts D.C..

88\. Hyundais position was that by virtue of its subcontract with Vatten,
Vatten was obliged to carry out the spark tests. It should be noted that
clause 11 of that contract provided that Vatten would be responsible for
testing of any materials as required under the [main] contract. Vatten
incorporated a similar clause in their subcontract with CHS and took the stand
that CHS as the back-to-back sub-subcontractor had undertaken this obligation.
They also relied on Mr GC Tans admission under cross-examination that when CHS
was working on the project, they were required to carry out spark tests to
test the thickness of the paint. It was put to him that CHS had failed to
conduct the spark tests as required under the subcontract. Mr Tans answer was:
The problem is they went to do the spark test, they did not tell us. The
consultant did the spark tests with Hyundais men. If he found defects he would
mark the areas and we would do the rectification. He then said that CHS was
not supposed to conduct the tests themselves but that the consultant had to be
present. In the same answer, Mr Tan said that the plaintiffs had conducted
their own tests. It was put to him that Hyundai had no choice but to deploy
their own workers to do the tests because CHS had failed to do them. Mr Tans
response was that DNT, the paint maker, had conducted the tests. This rather
confused testimony left me with the understanding that at some basic level Mr
Tan accepted that spark tests were the plaintiffs responsibility but that he
thought they had good excuses for not carrying out that responsibility
completely.

89\. Mr Hwang Min Ju, a civil engineer employed by Hyundai on the project,
gave evidence that as the plaintiffs had failed to conduct the tests, Hyundai
had had no choice but to do them themselves as otherwise the project would
have been delayed and the penalties for the delay were high. He also testified
that Hyundai may deduct the sum of $70,000 for these works at the end of
project.

90\. As at the date of the hearing, no money had been deducted from Vatten by
Hyundai to cover the costs of spark tests carried out by Hyundai. As such, it
is my judgment that Vattens claim for reimbursement is premature. I accept
that the plaintiffs were contractually obliged to carry out the spark tests
and that they did not carry out all these tests. However, the amount which
Hyundai is entitled to charge for having to carry out the tests themselves has
not been established. The sum of $70,000 appears to be an estimate rather than
an exact calculation of the costs that Hyundai incurred. It is also not
settled whether Hyundai will in fact make a claim against Vatten for the costs
of the spark tests. If it does so in the future, Vatten will be entitled to
reimbursement from CHS for such sum as was actually incurred by Hyundai on
account of work that should have been done by CHS.

**

Issue 7: Was there an agreement for CHS to do the textural painting of the
digesters at the rate of $9 per square metre?

**

91\. The background facts relating to this issue are that in January 1999,
Vatten asked CHS if they would paint the digesters. CHS was interested and
submitted a quotation to do the work at the rate of $12.50 per square metre.
They also prepared a mock-up. Subsequently, Mr Lim asked Mr GC Tan whether he
would reduce the rate to $9 per square metre. Vattens case is that CHS
accepted the counter-offer and a contract came into being on that basis.
According to Mr Lim, however, after Hyundai instructed Vatten to proceed with
the digester works, he asked Mr Tan Ah San when the plaintiffs could do these
works. At that stage Mr Tan stated that the plaintiffs did not want to do any
additional work. Vatten then had to employ another subcontractor for this part
of the works. CHS denies accepting the counter-offer. Mr Tan said that it was
impossible for him to agree to Mr Lims proposal since the rate suggested was
below his cost.

92\. The contract, if any, was an oral one. The issue is whom to believe. I
should point out here that both Mr Lim and Mr GC Tan did not always tell the
truth in their testimony. Submissions have been made that I should regard Mr
Lim as a habitual liar. Although he was forced to admit on several occasions
that he was not telling the truth, this does not mean that everything Mr Lim
said was untrue. In the case of the contract for the digesters, his assertions
were supported by Vattens letter of 24 January 2000 to CHS. This letter
consisted of several paragraphs under various headings. Item (B) was entitled
Texture Coating and it read:

> As per our discussion and your verbal confirmation of S$9.00 per m2
> inclusive of labors and materials for the texture paint to the 6 nos. of
> digester of an area of approximate 6000 sq.m., we like to have your work
> schedule in order for us to arrange with Hyundai the necessary staging. The
> finishes should be similar to the sample done by you.

It was submitted that the above paragraph should be accepted as evidence of
the verbal agreement since CHS had not at the time refuted the assertion of a
contract.

93\. CHS submitted that the letter could not be relied upon as evidence of an
agreement. Counsel pointed out that during cross-examination Mr Lim had
admitted that a statement made by him in the first sentence of the third
paragraph of the same letter to wit We had in fact reminded you several times
that Hyundai will only release payment upon giving them the calculation and
drawing of the completed area was not correct. Counsel asserted that Mr Lim
was capable of writing untruths in his letter and that it must be regarded as
suspect since at that time CHS had made a claim for payment of $400,000 and Mr
Lim would have been looking for grounds on which to resist that claim.

94\. CHS submitted that a contract to paint the digesters at $9 per square
metre could not have come into existence in January 2000 because:

(1) Vatten could not have agreed on a rate with CHS as their own rate for the
works vis--vis Hyundai was not agreed then and in fact was not confirmed until
7 March 2000;

(2) Mr Lim had given evidence that he would not have proceeded with the works
if the rate was not confirmed by Hyundai;

(3) since Hyundai had not asked Vatten to proceed with the works in January
2000, it was completely unnecessary for Mr Lim to require CHS to submit their
work schedule in order to enable him to arrange the necessary staging with
Hyundai;

(4) the evidence of the subcontractor eventually engaged by Vatten for the
textural painting was that Mr Lim did not ask him for a work schedule before
he commenced work nor did Mr Lim or Hyundai give him a time limit for that
work; and

(5) in contrast with their reaction subsequently when CHS stopped work, Vatten
did not complain in writing of the plaintiffs alleged refusal to carry out the
textural painting of the digesters.

95\. Having considered the plaintiffs points carefully, I think that in fact
there was an agreement in the terms contended by Vatten. That agreement was
evidenced by the 24 January letter. It was significant that at the hearing CHS
at first objected to the admissibility of that letter. They did this even
though the letter had been listed in the list of documents and the plaintiffs
solicitors had included it as part of the Agreed Bundle. To counter the
plaintiffs assertion that the letter had never been sent to them, the
defendants adduced the original fax transmission which showed that the
plaintiffs had received the letter. Mr Tan then asserted that he had not seen
the letter even though it may have been received in his office.

96\. The language of the letter is very clear. It states that a verbal
confirmation had been given of the rate. If this was not true, the plaintiffs
would have written to the defendants to rebut it. Mr Tan made much of the fact
that he did not know English and that he had little administrative assistance.
This deficiency did not stop him from replying twice, once in English and once
in Chinese, to the defendants subsequent letter protesting against the work
stoppage. Further, in the years 1999 and 2000, the plaintiffs were involved in
12 projects and they employed a quantity surveyor and two other staff members.
Just a week before the letter of 24 January, the plaintiffs had written to the
defendants demanding payment of an outstanding amount of $400,000 by 20
January 2000. No doubt that was a brief letter but they could have written
equally briefly to say there was no agreement at $9 per square metre.

97\. As regards the argument by CHS that Vatten could not have come to an
agreement with them in January 2000 because Hyundai had not awarded the job to
the defendants then, Mr Lims evidence was that Hyundai had already confirmed
that Vatten was to carry out the job. It was only the rate that had to be
confirmed and the defendants were confident of obtaining a higher rate from
Hyundai. If they had not been able to, they would still have had to pay CHS
the agreed rate. In any case, if the rate of $9 per square metre was below
cost, Vatten had reasonable grounds for believing that the rate awarded by
Hyundai would be at least equal to if not more than that.

98\. Further, when CHS backed out, Vatten employed Toh Hai Cheow to paint the
digesters at the rate of $14.50 per square metre. This rate was higher by $2
than the plaintiffs original quotation. As Vatten submitted, if it was true
that CHS had been prepared to carry out the works at $12.50 per square metre,
it would have made commercial sense for Vatten to engage CHS to do the work at
that rate instead of employing Mr Toh.

99\. The evidence adduced by Vatten was that in respect of the digester work
they had paid Mr Toh $49,564.82 and paid DNT $32,515.04 for the paint. The
total incurred was $82,079.86 for an area of work covering 5,660.68 m. If CHS
had done the same work at the contracted rate of $9 per square metre, Vatten
would only have had to pay them $50,946.12. This means that Vatten incurred an
extra $31,133.34 by reason of the plaintiffs refusal to carry out their
agreement and Vatten is entitled to recover this sum from CHS.

**

Issue 8: Did Vatten seize any plant and material belonging to CHS?

**

100\. CHS contended that Vatten had wrongfully seized their plant and
materials having a value of $15,035 when they were forcibly ejected from the
site on 18 October 2000\. Although by a solicitors letter dated 20 February
2001, Vatten had informed CHS that they could repossess their property, when
CHS personnel actually went to the site to retrieve the same, they were denied
access by the security guards. It was submitted that even if Vatten had not
seized the property, as a matter of law, Vatten had come under a duty to take
reasonable care of the property on Vattens site after they ejected CHS from
it.

101\. I find great difficulty in this part of the plaintiffs case. The site
did not belong to Vatten. Vatten was not in occupation and possession of the
site. The person in occupation was Hyundai and it was Hyundai who controlled
the site and it was Hyundais guards who would have ejected trespassers on the
site. Even assuming that Mr Ponniah was removed from the site on 18 October
2000, this removal was not effected by Vatten but by Hyundai. If any plant and
materials were left on the site, the same would have been within the custody
of Hyundai and not within the custody of Vatten.

102\. Further, the letter from the defendants solicitors which CHS referred to
stated that CHS should let the defendants solicitors know when CHS intended to
remove the items so that Vatten could make arrangements with Hyundai to give
CHS access to the site. The plaintiffs solicitors never responded to this
letter and in court, Mr GC Tan conceded that he had not replied to the offer.
He said that instead of instructing his lawyers to reply to the letter so that
Hyundai could be informed, upon receipt of the letter he simply went straight
to the site to retrieve the items. Thus, CHS have only themselves to blame if
they could not get access to the site.

103\. One of the items claimed was a lorry. The evidence was that it was
parked outside the security post in a public area and the keys were with Mr
Tan Ah San. Mr Tan admitted to me that the keys had been with him since he had
left the site. By November 2001, the lorry was no longer parked outside the
site. Since the keys were with CHS, they must have removed it. In any case,
there was nothing to stop them retrieving the lorry at any time.

104\. The plaintiffs claim in respect of the plant and materials and the lorry
is unfounded and must be dismissed.

**

Issue 9: Was the call on the performance bond wrongful?

**

105\. In regard to this issue, the submission of CHS was that having regard to
Vattens persistent breaches in underpaying CHS and their wrongful termination
of the subcontract, the call on the bond by Vatten on 14 October 2000 and the
receipt of the monies paid thereunder was wrongful. CHS asked for restitution
and/or an account of the sum of $60,000 paid to Vatten. My findings that the
allegation of persistent underpayment was not proved and that the termination
by Vatten was lawful have, accordingly, removed the basis of the argument that
the call on the bond was wrongful. As CHS was in breach of contract by
stopping work before completion, Vatten was entitled to call on the bond. They
will in due course have to account to CHS for the $60,000 received under the
bond but this accounting will be part of the overall accounting for the
project and not something arising out of a breach by CHS. If at the end of the
day the calling of the bond means that Vatten has been over-compensated or CHS
has been underpaid, the amount of the over-compensation or deficiency would
have to be refunded by Vatten.

Issue 10: Is Vatten entitled to interlocutory judgment for damages to be
assessed?

**

106\. Vattens position on this issue was that by stopping work CHS had
repudiated the contract and this repudiation was accepted by Vatten vide their
solicitors letter of 16 October and 18 October 2000. Vatten then had to find
another contractor on an urgent basis as otherwise they would become liable to
Hyundai for damages for delay. Vatten obtained three quotations as follows:

(1) One Teck General Contractors $298,000

(2) SKK (S) Pte Ltd $285,000

(3) Tech 3 International $275,000

The works were awarded to Tech 3 International and it was agreed that Vatten
would purchase the materials needed for the works and deduct the cost from the
contract sum. The contract sum was high because Tech 3 was required to provide
a warranty for all the works including the major portion done by CHS since
Vatten considered that they could not rely on CHS to return to the site to
carry out rectification works.

107\. At the time of the hearing Vatten had purchased paint valued at $52,000
for work done by Tech 3s workers. They had also paid Tech 3 a sum of $84,800
in respect of the labour cost. According to Mr Choy of Tech 3, his company had
been chasing Vatten for the balance due of $138,200 but had been asked by Mr
Lim to wait until the final account was issued by Hyundai when Vatten
themselves would be paid. At the date of the submissions, the final account
had not been issued and the defendants therefore asked for interlocutory
judgment for damages to be assessed to be entered against CHS. They agree that
the bond of $60,000 should be taken into account when the damages are
assessed.

108\. CHS submitted that, even if Vattens termination of the subcontract was
lawful, they were not allowed to claim against CHS for the warranty procured
from Tech 3. There was no reason to obtain such a warranty as Vatten still had
their contractual right to demand that CHS make good any defects that may
arise in the future.

109\. What were the courses of action open to Vatten when CHS stopped work and
Vatten consequently terminated the contract? The first was to employ another
subcontractor simply to complete the uncompleted works and to rectify any
defects in his own works. If that course was chosen and subsequently defects
were discovered in CHS work, Vatten would have had to call on CHS to rectify
their own defects and, in the event of CHS failing to do so, employ yet
another subcontractor to do that work. The other alternative was to take the
course that Vatten actually chose ie to award a lump sum contract for both the
uncompleted work and rectification of all works. This meant not having to rely
on CHS at all but having to pay a larger sum up front to cover defects without
any idea of the extent of defective work that would actually manifest itself.

110\. Was Vatten reasonable in choosing the second course? They had given a
warranty to Hyundai for the painting work and had in turn received a warranty
from CHS. This warranty considerably extended the period of the subcontractors
liability for the works. Although I have found that Vatten has not established
their claim for defective works at this stage, this does not mean that there
is no reasonable likelihood of defects in the work appearing during the
warranty period which will require rectification. Vatten did produce evidence
of many complaints made by Hyundai on the quality of the works. The plaintiffs
response was that any defects seen had been rectified by the time they left
the site. They did not assert that no defects at all had manifested
themselves. Taking into account that there were complaints about the
plaintiffs workmanship and some defects at least manifested themselves while
the plaintiffs were still on the site, there is a likelihood of more defects
surfacing during the warranty period. Further, the circumstances of the
termination made it reasonable for Vatten to judge CHS unlikely to honour
their warranty commitments. In my judgment, it was reasonable for Vatten to
employ Tech 3 to provide not only workers to complete the work but also to
undertake the warranty obligations that should have been undertaken by CHS.

111\. It appears therefore that the damages sustained by Vatten by the
plaintiffs breach of contract would be the sum of $275,000 less what they
would have had to pay CHS had CHS completed the works. These damages cannot be
assessed by me since there is insufficient evidence of exactly how much work
remained to be done when CHS left the site and what would have been payable
for such work. These items will therefore have to go for assessment. As
against the damages recoverable from CHS, there will have to be set off what
was payable to them for work done up to 5 October 2000. As stated therefore,
the assessment will have to include evidence from Hyundai on what was
completed as at end of September 2002 and a calculation of what was due to the
plaintiffs based on the subcontract rates, as amended, and after deducting the
retention amounts and previous payments made and those contra charges which
the plaintiffs have accepted.

**Conclusion**

112\. My findings on the various issues are set out above. Basically, the
plaintiffs have not succeeded on most of their claims, although I have found
in their favour on the issue of the rates for the internal painting works and
have also found that they should be paid for works up to October 2000. The
defendants have succeeded on their claim for $31,133.34 in respect of the
digesters and on the issue of an assessment of damages. They have, however,
failed on other claims.

113\. In the result, the plaintiffs are awarded judgment in respect of the
amount due to them for work done up to 5 October 2000, such amount to be
assessed by the Registrar. The remainder of the plaintiffs claims are
dismissed.

114\. The defendants are awarded judgment in the sum of $31,133.34 and are
also awarded judgment for damages to be assessed in respect of the plaintiffs
breach of contract which caused them to employ Tech 3 International at a lump
sum of $275,000. These damages shall be assessed at the same assessment as
that relating to the work completed by the plaintiffs as at 5 October 2000.
The remainder of the defendants claims are dismissed.

115\. I will see the parties on costs.
