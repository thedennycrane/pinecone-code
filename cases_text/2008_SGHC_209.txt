Choo Han Teck J:

1 The respondent pleaded guilty on 28 August 2008 to four charges under the
Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed). The first charge (DAC 35610/08), under
s 140(1)(d), was for bringing a 17-year old female into Singapore for the
purposes of prostitution. He was fined $8,000 and, in default, eight weeks
imprisonment. The second charge (DAC 36407/08), under s 146(1) was for living
on the earnings of prostitution. He was fined $6,000 and in default, six weeks
imprisonment. The third charge (DAC 36409/08), under s 147(1) was for managing
a coffeeshop on a place of assignation. He was fined $3,000 and in default,
three weeks imprisonment. The fourth charge (DAC 38754/08, recorded as “the
sixth charge” in the court below), under s 376B(1) was for aiding another
person in the procurement of sexual services of a 17-year old female. He was
fined $8,000 and in default, eight weeks imprisonment. Three other charges
under the Women’s Charter were taken into account for the purposes of
sentencing. The respondent did not pay the fines. He had been remanded since 8
August 2008 and, was at the time of this appeal, still serving the 25 weeks
imprisonment in default for non payment of the fines. The public prosecutor
appealed against sentence in respect of the fourth charge which reads:

You,  
Wang Minjiang, M/36 years old  
DOB 18.2.1972  
China Passport No G15890918  
China National

are charged that you, sometime on or about the 4th day of August 2008, at Blk
41 Sims Drive #02-255, Singapore, did abet by intentionally aiding one Tan
Chye Hin, Male/55 years old, to obtain for consideration, to wit, a sum of
S$100/-, the sexual services of one B, Female/17 years old, DOB: xxx, who is
under 18 years of age, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment
and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 376B(1)
read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2004 Rev. Ed.)

Section 376B(1) reads as follows:

**376B.** —(1) Any person who obtains for consideration the sexual services of
a person, who is under 18 years of age, shall be punished with imprisonment
for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.

2 The statement of facts was brief and straightforward. Two young women
including the 17-year old mentioned in the charges, were brought into
Singapore by the respondent with the help of a couple from China. He set up
the girls for prostitution in Singapore. Two of the customers were 55 and 60
years old respectively.

3 The point of interest is the novelty of the sentence under appeal. It was in
respect of a newly created offence under s 376B(1). The learned deputy public
prosecutor (“DPP”) submitted that it was the legislature’s intention that
these sort of offences “be viewed seriously and for such offences to be
enforced strictly.” He submitted that the “learned district judge only paid
lip service to the parliamentary intent and glossed over the vital reason
enunciated by the Senior Minister of State for protecting this vulnerable
group and to enforce the law strictly in this regard.” The learned DPP
submitted that the judge below erred because he took the view that a 17-year
old was capable of consensual sex, he had thereby failed to appreciate
Parliament’s intention of protecting persons below the age of 18. I should
first point out that the criticism apparent in the DPP’s submission was too
harsh and may not be warranted. This instant case was not an easy one to find
the right range of sentence, especially since it was the first under the new
law. It does seem to me, however, that a more rigorous sentence might be
needed to discourage international prostitution involving persons the law
regards as young and vulnerable. A fine might not be an adequate sentence in
the present circumstances. Although Parliament had provided for a fine as the
lowest end of the sentence (and seven years imprisonment as the highest end),
a fine should be reserved for cases of exceptional circumstances, but nothing
in the present case indicated that there were any such factors. Neither were
there any exceptional factors that might suggest that a long term of
imprisonment was necessary. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the
fine of $8,000 should be set aside and a term of imprisonment of 12 months
imposed. The term of imprisonment will take effect from 8 August 2008.
