**

Facts

**On 18 June 2001, the plaintiffs and the defendants arrived at a negotiated
settlement in relation to their claim and counter-claim in DC Suit 1771/98. A
consent order recorded by the court provided inter alia that the defendants
were to pay the plaintiffs the sum of $21,718.92 in 4 equal instalments of
S$5,429.73 each commencing on the 30th day of June 2001 and thereafter on the
30th day of each succeeding month; and in the event of default in any of the
instalment payment on the part of the defendants, the plaintiffs shall be at
liberty to enter judgment on the plaintiffs claimed sum of S$36,343.92 less
any payments received from the defendants together with interest and costs.
The defendants paid and the plaintiffs received the first three instalment
payments in compliance with the terms of the consent order. The fourth and
final instalment fell due on 1 October 2001 (30 September 2001 being a
Sunday). A cheque drawn by the defendants dated 29 September 2001 was
reportedly mailed to the plaintiffs at about 6.30pm on 1 October 2001 and was
received by the plaintiffs only on 3 October 2001. The plaintiffs deemed the
late arrival of the cheque to be in breach of the consent order and entered
judgment against the defendants for the sum claimed originally by them in the
suit less the amount of the three instalment sums. The defendants applied to
set aside the default judgment, submitting that the posting of the cheque at
6.30pm on 1 October 2001 would have constituted compliance with the said
consent order. Their application was dismissed by the Deputy Registrar and the
defendants appealed unsuccessfully to a District Judge. The defendants
appealed again to the High Court. In the course of the appeal, another feature
suddenly surfaced. The High Court was informed that the plaintiffs, after
having received the defendants cheque that was forwarded for the purposes of
meeting the defendants fourth and final instalment obligation, retained
possession of it and without telling the defendants what they were going to do
with the cheque, proceeded to enter default judgment against the defendants
for a sum which did not include the amount of the said cheque. Whilst the
terms of the draft judgment forwarded to defendants counsel for their approval
was still under contest, the cheque was banked in by the plaintiffs and had
the sum stated in the said cheque credited into the plaintiffs account. **

Held

**, allowing the appeal:

(1) The consent order expressly provided for a strict time frame for the
instalment payments and a default clause spelling out the consequences of non-
compliance with the said instalment arrangements. The defendants argument that
the posting of the cheque at 6.30pm on 1 October 2001 would have constituted
compliance with the said consent order, to say the least, was both untenable
and disingenuous. The order was unequivocal and stipulates payment by the 30th
of each succeeding month. In regard to the fourth instalment, the payment
should have been made to the plaintiffs on or before 1 October 2001 but in the
present case the cheque did not reach the plaintiffs until 3 October 2001. The
terms of the consent order imports a clear implication that time is indeed of
the essence in relation to the instalment payments and any default thereof
would trigger the consequences stipulated under cl 4 of the said consent
order. There could be no other interpretation. The consent order did indeed
evidence a contract between the parties and given the factual background thus
far, there was no justification to vary or modify the said order, without the
consent of both the parties (See 11-12).

(2) The plaintiffs holding on to the defendants cheque for the fourth
instalment was no mere accident or inadvertence but a conscious act. They had
misjudged the legal implications of their action in retaining and subsequently
cashing the said cheque. By proceeding to enter judgment for a sum which did
not take into account the amount stated in the fourth instalment cheque was
irregular and ought to be set aside ex debito justitiae (See 21).

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1 The issue in this appeal revolves around a default provision in relation to
instalment payments contained in a consent order made by the court, following
a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants in this suit.

2 The background facts which give rise to the appeal before me are set out by
the Learned District Judge in her grounds of decision and they could be
summarised as follows.

3 On 18 June 2001, the plaintiffs and the defendants arrived at a negotiated
settlement in relation to their claim and counter-claim in the suit herein.
Following the settlement on the same day, a consent order was recorded by the
court as follows:

> 1\. the Defendants to pay the Plaintiffs the sum of $21,718.92 in 4 equal
> instalments of S$5,429.73 each commencing on the 30th day of June 2001 and
> thereafter on the 30th day of each succeeding month;
>
> 2\. each party to bear [its] own cost;
>
> 3\. the Notice of Discontinuance for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants to be
> filed within 14 days from the date of the last payment;
>
> 4\. in the event of default in any of the instalment payment on the part of
> the Defendants, the Plaintiffs shall be at liberty to enter Judgement on the
> Plaintiffs claimed sum of S$36,343.92 less any payments received from the
> Defendants together with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date
> of Writ of Summons to the date of Judgment, costs to be agreed or taxed and
> the Defendants counterclaim shall be deemed to be withdrawn.

4 Following the consent order the defendants paid and the plaintiffs received
the first three instalment payments in compliance with the terms of the
consent order. The fourth and final instalment fell due on 30 September 2001
which was a Sunday. However, since the due date for the last instalment
payment fell on a Sunday, the provisions of O 3 r (3) of the Rules of Court
which stipulate that where the time prescribed by these Rules or by any
Judgment, order or direction for doing any act expires on a day other than a
working day, the act shall be in time if done on the next working day, became
applicable. Consequently, the due date for payment for the last instalment was
1 October 2001. Unhappily for the defendants, a cheque drawn by the defendants
dated 29 September 2001 was reportedly mailed to the plaintiffs at about
6.30pm on 1 October 2001 and was received by the plaintiffs only on 3 October
2001. The plaintiffs deemed the late arrival of the cheque to be in breach of
the consent order. Consequently, they purported to exercise their rights
reserved under clause 4 of the consent order and entered judgment against the
defendants on 11 October 2001 for the sum claimed originally by them in this
suit less the amount of the three instalment sums. Insofar as material, the
relevant segment of the judgment so entered by the plaintiffs against the
defendants on 11 October 2001, following the said breach, reads as follows:

> And default having been made in that the Defendants had failed to pay the
> final instalment of $5,429.73 by the 1st day of October 2001, IT IS THIS DAY
> ADJUDGED that Judgment be entered against the Defendants for:-
>

>> 1\. the sum of $20,054.73 being the balance of the Plaintiffs claimed sum
of $36,343.92 less payments of $16,289.19 received;

>>

>> 2\. interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of Writ of Summons
to the date of Judgment;

>>

>> 3\. costs to be agreed or taxed,

>
> and the Defendants counterclaim shall be deemed to be withdrawn.

5 The defendants applied to the court on 19 October 2001 to set aside the said
default judgment contending that the cheque sent out by them allegedly on 1
October 2001 was in compliance with the consent order. Their application to
set aside the judgment was heard on 13 November 2001 and turned down in the
first instance by the Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts. The
defendants appeal to the District Judge which was heard on 21 December 2001
was equally unsuccessful. It would appear from the grounds delivered that the
main argument advanced by the defendants before her was that inasmuch as the
cheque in relation to the fourth instalment payment was mailed at about 6.30pm
on the 1 October 2001, the defendants should not have been held to have
committed any breach of the terms of the consent order.

6 The learned District Judge in her grounds said:

> The consent order was a compromise agreement reached between the parties
> towards the final settlement of their action. Being a consent order the
> parties were bound by it. The terms of the agreement were clearly set out in
> the consent order. Under the order the defendants shall pay the plaintiffs
> on 30th June 2001 and thereafter on 30th of each succeeding month. The
> consequences for not complying with the orders were also set out in the
> consent order. I did not accept the defendants contention that payment was
> made upon posting the cheque on 1 October 2001. The defendants were not in
> compliance with the terms of the consent order. The plaintiffs were entitled
> to insist on the strict compliance of the terms of the consent order. Hence
> the plaintiffs were entitled to the judgment.

7 In the appeal before me the self-same argument was rehearsed by appellants
counsel, stating that the mailing of the cheque by the defendants at about
6.30pm on 1 October 2001 should have been sufficient compliance with the
consent order so entered.

8 The nature and concept of the phrase by consent had received considerable
judicial attention over the years. Lord Denning MR, in _**Siebe Gorman & Co
Ltd v Pneupac Ltd**_ [1982] 1 All E R 377 (CA), after a brief survey of the
earlier decisions, observed at page 380a-c:

> It should be clearly understood by the profession that, when an order is
> expressed to be made by consent, it is ambiguous. There are two meanings to
> the words by consent. That was observed by Lord Greene MR in _Chandless-
> Chandless v Nicholson_ [1942] 2 All ER 315 at 317, [1942] 2 KB 321 at 324.
> One meaning is this: the words by consent may evidence a real contract
> between the parties. In such a case the court will only interfere with such
> an order on the same grounds as it would with any other contract. The other
> meaning is this: the words by consent may mean the parties hereto not
> objecting. In such a case there is no real contract between the parties. The
> order can be altered or varied by the court in the same circumstances as any
> other order that is made by the court without the consent of the parties. In
> every case it is necessary to discover which meaning is used. Does the order
> evidence a real contract between the parties? Or does it only evidence an
> order made without obligation?
>
> We were referred to several cases. In _Huddersfield Banking Co Ltd v Henry
> Lister & Son Ltd_ [1895] 2 Ch 273, [1895-9] All ER Rep 868 there was a
> consent order dealing with a large amount of machinery and plant. Everyone
> had agreed that it should be sold on certain terms. That was clearly a
> contract between the parties with which the court would not interfere except
> on the same grounds as any other contract. In _Purcell v F C Trigell Ltd_
> [1970] 3 All ER 671, [1971] 1 QB 358 the correspondence (which is set out in
> the facts of the case) showed that there was a real contract agreed between
> the parties that, unless a particular order for interrogatories was complied
> with, the matter should be struck out. In that case I said that the court
> has a discretion to vary or alter the terms of the order for
> interrogatories, even though made by consent. There is a case mentioned in
> _The Supreme Court Practice_ 1982, vol I, p 16, para 3/5/1, namely
> _Australasian Automatic Weighing Machine Co v Walter_ [1891] WN 170\. That
> concerned an order by consent to transfer shares. Again it was a case in
> which there was a real contract between the parties. Equally, in _Intervale
> Group of Companies Ltd v Knighton_ [1976] CA Transcript 302, Bridge LJ,
> after analysing all the facts, came to the conclusion-
>

>> that there was here an unconditional binding contract in law between the
parties that the order of 10 February should be made, as it was.

>
> Scarman LJ added that, in the circumstances of the case, from Bridge LJs
> analysis of the facts, there was here a contract. The most recent case was
> in the same category: see _Chanel Ltd v F W Woolworth & Co Ltd_ [1981] 1 All
> ER 745, [1981] 1 WLR 485\. It seems to me that all those cases can be, and
> should be, explained on the basis that there was a real contract between the
> parties evidenced by the order which was drawn up.

9 It is perhaps instructive at this stage to refer to the case of
_**Australasian Automatic Weighing Machine Company v Walter**_ [1891] WN 170
which was referred to by Lord Denning in _**Siebe Gorman**_. In the
_**Australasian Automatic Weighing Machine**_ case, the plaintiffs applied to
the court to enlarge the time limited for the defendants compliance with an
order dated the 7th day of August, 1891. The order was made in chambers on the
hearing of an application by the plaintiffs, and it was by consent ordered
that the defendant should, on or before the 31st day of August 1891, transfer
to the plaintiff company, or their nominee, certain shares in the company. The
order was passed and entered, but it had not been complied with and not been
served on the defendant.

10 Subsequently, a motion was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs praying that
the time limited by the order for the defendant to transfer the shares be
enlarged to the 2nd day of November 1891, or four days after service of the
order that was to be made on the motion. North J who heard the motion, refused
to make any order on the motion, on the ground that an order made by consent
could not be altered without consent.

11 The consent order recorded with the sanction of the court on 18 June 2001
in the present case expressly provides for a strict time frame for the
instalment payments and a default clause spelling out the consequences of non-
compliance with the said instalment arrangements. The argument advanced on
behalf of the defendants that the posting of the cheque at 6.30pm on 1 October
2001 would have constituted compliance with the said consent order, to say the
least, is both untenable and disingenuous. The order is unequivocal and
stipulates payment by the 30th of each succeeding month. In regard to the
fourth instalment, the payment should have been made to the plaintiffs on or
before 1 October 2001, since the scheduled date of payment ie, 30 September
2001 happened to be a Sunday and the provisions of O 3 r (3) of the Rules of
Court (_supra_) applied. In the case before me the cheque did not reach the
plaintiffs until 3 October 2001.

12 Another aspect which warrants mention at this stage is that the defendants
claim that the cheque in respect of the fourth instalment was mailed at about
6.30pm on 1 October 2001 seemed to have emerged much later when in fact what
was claimed in the very first affidavit of Ong Teck Beng, a director of the
defendants filed on 19 October 2001 was that his wife who had prepared the
cheque on 29 September 2001 did not come to work on 1 October 2001 as she was
ill on that day and consequently the said cheque in respect of the fourth
instalment was mailed only on 2 October 2001. Only when the appeal from the
Deputy Registrar to the District Judge was in train, did the defendants shift
their position and come up with a claim that the said cheque was probably
posted at about 6.30pm on 1 October 2001. Quite apart from this volte face
which did not seem to have impressed the District Judge who heard the appeal,
the terms of the consent order imports a clear implication that time is indeed
of the essence in relation to the instalment payments and any default thereof
would trigger the consequences stipulated under cl 4 of the said consent
order. There could be no other interpretation. In my view, the consent order
does indeed evidence a contract between the parties and given factual
background thus far, there was no justification to vary or modify the said
order, without the consent of both the parties.

13 The matter did not, however, seem to end there. In the course of the appeal
before me, another feature suddenly surfaced. I was informed by counsel that
the plaintiffs who after having received the defendants cheque that was
forwarded for the purposes of meeting the defendants fourth and final
instalment obligation on 3 October 2001, retained possession of it and without
telling the defendants what they were going to do with the cheque, proceeded
to enter default judgment against the defendants on 11 October 2001, for a sum
which did not include the amount of the said cheque.

14 The plaintiffs decision to enter judgment for a sum disregarding the
purported last payment would indeed make sense, if the plaintiffs did not
intend to appropriate the said cheque. But what happened in fact was that the
plaintiffs who were holding on to the cheque, ever since 3 October 2001,
proceeded to bank in the said cheque on 21 November 2001, at the time the
defendants were disputing the validity as well as the regularity of the
judgment entered by the plaintiffs against them on 11 October 2001. Whilst the
terms of the draft judgment forwarded to defendants counsel for their approval
was still under contest, the cheque was banked in by the plaintiffs and had
the sum stated in the said cheque credited into the plaintiffs account. It
would appear that the fact that the said cheque had been banked and cashed out
by the plaintiffs was not placed before the District Judge at the time she
heard the appeal.

15 The fact that the judgment entered by the plaintiffs, purportedly under cl
4 of the consent order did not take into account the amount of the cheque so
received, retained and subsequently appropriated by the plaintiffs, gave a
different perspective to the issues presented to the court for resolution. The
question presently was not so much as to whether the court could or ought to
vary a consent order which was most certainly in the nature of a contract but
whether the plaintiffs by their conduct, however unwitting it might have been,
waived their right to the benefit of cl 4 of the consent order. Additionally,
a subsidiary yet important question was whether the judgment entered by the
plaintiffs on 11 October 2001 could be regarded as regular on the face of it,
when it omitted to take into account the amount of the cheque, consciously
retained and appropriated by the plaintiffs.

16 In _**Hughes v Justin**_ [1894] 1 QB 667, it was held by the Court of
Appeal in England that where judgment is entered for too large a sum, the
defendant in the action is entitled to have it set aside _ex debito justitiae_
and to have all his costs. The cheque sent by the defendants, inasmuch as it
had been retained without communication of any reservation thereto, operated,
in my view, as a conditional acceptance of satisfaction of the debt due and
owing.

17 In _**Bolt & Nut Co (Tipton) Ltd v Rowlands Nicholls & Co Ltd**_ [1964] 2
QB 10 (CA), the facts as appear in the headnotes of the report are as follows.

18 The defendants sold goods supplied to them by the plaintiffs on the terms
of a stocking agreement, and there was a running account between the parties.
In August 1962, the plaintiffs issued a writ for 4,012 12s. 7d. against the
defendants in respect of goods sold and delivered. Shortly afterwards the
defendants paid 1,699 18s. 5d. by cheque, so reducing the plaintiffs claim to
2,312 14s. 2d., but they did not enter an appearance to the writ. On September
11, 1962, there was a meeting between the parties at which the plaintiffs were
given and accepted a cheque for 1,179.19s. 11d., thereby reducing the claim to
1,132 14s. 3d. On September 13, 1962, the plaintiffs signed judgment in
default of appearance for 2,312 14s. 2d., ignoring the cheque for 1,179 19s.
11d. given to them two days earlier, and which subsequently on September 18,
1962, was cashed through the clearing office of the bank _._ On July 29, 1963,
the defendants applied to set aside the judgment as being irregular on the
ground that it was entered for an amount in excess of that which was due when
it was signed. The district registrar set aside the judgment upon the payment
by the defendants of 600 into court; on appeal the judge in chambers set aside
the judgment unconditionally but ordered that the costs of the application to
the district registrar and the costs thrown away be the plaintiffs in any
event, and that the costs of the appeal to the judge be the defendants costs
in the case. Subsequent to his order the defendants obtained leave ex parte
from the judge to appeal against his order as to costs.

19 On appeal, it was held that the ordinary rule that acceptance of a cheque
was a conditional payment of a debt and that it operated to suspend a
creditors remedies in respect of the debt until it was met or dishonoured
applied to the case; that, therefore, the plaintiffs could not ignore the
cheque accepted by them two days before signing judgment and, accordingly, the
judgment being entered for too large a sum was irregular and the defendants
notwithstanding their delay, were entitled to have it set aside _ex debito
justitiae_ and to have the costs of the application to set it aside and the
costs thrown away in any event.

20 Danckwerts LJ observed at pages 21 and 22:

> Now the law is perfectly well settled that, in the absence of some special
> circumstances indicating that the cheque is accepted in absolute
> satisfaction of the debt which I imagine is unusual a cheque is accepted as
> a conditional payment of the debt, that is to say, conditional on the cheque
> not being dishonoured when presented for payment in the ordinary way. This
> cheque was not dishonoured, because it was in fact paid when presented and
> cleared through the proper banking method.
>
> The short point in this case is whether the judgment, being signed for the
> amount for which it was signed, was incorrect and was irregular, so that the
> defendants were entitled to have it set aside as of right. The general rule,
> if applied in this case, would make it irregular, in my view, because the
> law is well settled that the acceptance of a cheque as conditional payment
> suspends the remedies of the creditors. But Mr. Warren claims that a case
> like the present is an exception to the general rule. He makes a distinction
> between a payment, as I understand it, before the action is begun and a
> payment made after the action is on foot, when the plaintiffs would normally
> be in a position to sign judgment in default of appearance or defence. The
> cases on which Mr. Warren relies seem to me to be very technical and special
> cases cases of rent where a landlord has a right of distress, and the right
> of distress is regarded as a better remedy than an action upon a cheque, and
> so it is taken that his acceptance of the cheque is conditional not only
> upon the cheque not being dishonoured, but upon the further condition that
> he should be entitled to pursue his other remedies. The same is said to
> apply in the case of a bond, or possibly in the case where a man has
> security. But those cases, in my opinion, are plainly distinguishable from
> the present case. The plaintiffs had not in fact a better remedy at the
> moment when they accepted the cheque.

21 In my evaluation, the plaintiffs holding on to the defendants cheque was no
mere accident or inadvertence but a conscious act. In my opinion, they had
misjudged the legal implications of their action in retaining and subsequently
cashing the said cheque. In my determination, the plaintiffs proceeding to
enter judgment, as they did, for a sum which did not take into account the
amount stated in the fourth instalment cheque was irregular and ought to be
set aside ex debito justitiae. In my view, the decision below would have been
different if the Deputy Registrar as well as the District Judge were in fact
apprised of the retention and cashing of the cheque by the plaintiffs.

22 For the reasons I have given, I allowed the appeal of the defendants and
set aside the judgment entered against them. Although the defendants had
succeeded on appeal, I ordered that each party shall bear its own costs on
appeal in view of the fact that the aspect of the retention and the subsequent
realisation of the amount of the said cheque was not raised before and
surfaced only mid-way through the appeal hearing before me.

_

Order accordingly.
