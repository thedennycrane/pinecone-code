>

_

Find:

_ _

(1) Breach of

_Contract

2\. Defendant was in breach of the following clauses of the Agreement:

> (a) clause 4, in not removing the electrical wiring;
>
> (b) clause 6, in not paying the November 2000 rent;
>
> (c) clause 6 & implied term of the Agreement, that the Defendant should
> carry out the removal of his equipment, furniture, electrical wiring and
> electrical fittings in a reasonable manner,
>
> (d) the Agreement spells out what the Defendant is entitled to remove and
> does not entitle him to remove what is not specifically set out. Therefore
> the removal of the fire doors, etc is a breach of the Agreement.

_

  
(2) Trespass

_

3\. Defendant had trespassed on the premises on 1 November and caused the
removal of the fire doors, fire rated ceiling and damage to the roller
shutters, etc.

_

  
Damages:

_ __

Breach of clause 6 of Agreement

__

4\. November 2000 rent of _**$15,250**_

__

  
Other breaches of Agreement & Trespass:

__

5\. Re-instatement works: As the Plaintiff’s evidence was that he did not pay
for the re-instatement works pleaded, and evidence of his witness, Pow Boon
Chye was, in effect, that it was the landlord that was liable to him in
respect of the invoice exhibited, I find no loss to the Plaintiff on account
of the re-instatement works pleaded.

6\. Delay in opening: From the evidence, I find that a reasonable period that
was needed to carry out the re-instatement works as well as to obtain the
necessary approval from the Fire Safety Bureau on account of the removal of
fire doors, fire rate ceiling and other fire safety equipment, would be 2
months from 1 November 2000. Since the Plaintiff’s original plan was to open
on 15 November, it follows that the delay caused was 1.5 month.

7\. Loss of profit: From the evidence I am satisfied that the Plaintiff would
have broken even after a few months of operation. Therefore the loss to him in
respect of the 1.5 month delay would have been the cost that he had reasonably
incurred between mid-November and mid-December. In this respect I find that it
was reasonable for him to pay staff to be on standby, but not to pay his
partner, Nassir. In the event the costs are as follows:

> (a) 1.5 month’s rental: $15,250 x 1.5 = $22,875
>
> (b) Staff costs for 1.5 month: $13,400  
>  (Tan, Phua, Catherine, Stephanie)

There being no evidence of any other costs incurred, the total is therefore
_**$36,275**_

_

  
Claim for aggravated damages:

_

8 Find that Plaintiff has not made out his claim for aggravated damages.

_**

  
Judgment

**_

9 Judgment for Plaintiff in the sum of $15,250 + $36,275 = _**$51,525**_ ,
with interest at 6% from date of writ (19 Jan 2001)

10 On costs, as the judgment sum is lower than the High Court threshold, the
Plaintiffs shall have an order for costs against the Defendant on the
Subordinate Courts scale, with disbursements (including court fees) also on
that scale.
