Choo Han Teck J:

1 The appellant is a China national. She is 36 years old. She met her husband,
a Singaporean, in China in 2006 and they married the following year, on June
2007. She is a housewife. Her husband works in an oil refinery in Pulau Bukom.

2 On 20 October 2009 the appellant pleaded guilty to an offence punishable
under s 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed). The punishment
for this offence may be a fine up to $4,000 or imprisonment up to a year or
both fine and imprisonment. The court below sentenced her to four weeks’
imprisonment.

3 The nature of her offence was that she made a false declaration on 3
September 2007 in her application for permanent residence where she stated
that her highest academic qualification was “Senior High” from the “Ruixi
Middle School, Cheng Mai, Hainan, China”. The charge stated that the false
declaration was made in an “attempt to obtain an entry permit granting [the
appellant] permanent residence” in Singapore.

4 The falsehood as stipulated in the admitted statement of facts consisted of
the fact that the appellant produced a forged certificate to the effect that
she graduated with the qualification of “senior high”. In the grounds of
decision the court below stated that “[the appellant] had never attended the
said school”. The appellant showed that the school subsequently confirmed that
she did attend the school but only until 1989 and not 1990. The significance
was that she would have had her senior high certificate had she graduated in
1990. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the forged certificate was
produced by the appellant’s brother after the school had initially refused to
give him a certificate to replace the appellant’s lost junior school
certificate.

5 The appellant was also a first offender and was here not for the purpose of
employment, but to live as a housewife to a Singapore citizen. She had spent
five days in remand. On these facts, I was of the view that _Abu Syeed
Chowdhury v PP_ [2002] 1 SLR(R) 182 was not an appropriate comparison. There,
the offender made a false declaration by stating that he graduated from the
University of Dhaka when he did not attend the university at all. He made the
false declaration in the several renewals of his employment pass. He was also
convicted on three charges under s 57(1)(k) with two others taken into
account.

6 On the facts of the present case, I was of the view that four weeks
imprisonment was too harsh and I therefore set aside the sentence and imposed
a fine of $3,000 instead.
