**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_**

BACKGROUND

**_1\. P.T. Permona (Permona) is an Indonesian company. On 29 January 1996, it
filed an application to register a trade mark in respect of cigarettes and
tobacco products; all included in Class 34. The trade mark was CHUNG HWA
(Permonas trade mark).

2\. The application was accepted with a disclaimer on CHUNG. The acceptance of
the application was advertised in Gazette Notification 12/98 on 3 April 1998.

3\. The application was opposed by Shanghai Tobacco Group (Shanghai Tobacco)
and the China Tobacco Import and Export Shanghai Corporation (CTIESC) although
in the Originating Motion before me, the latter was referred to as China
Import and Export Shanghai Corporation i.e without Tobacco. CTIESC is a state-
owned Chinese corporation. I will refer to both Shanghai Tobacco and CTIESC as
the Opponents.

4\. The Notice of Opposition was lodged on 26 June 1998 after a successful
application for an extension of time to do so.

5\. Pleadings were deemed closed on 11 November 1998. On 26 April 2001, the
parties appeared before Ms Lee Li Choon, Principal Assistant Registrar. She
ordered the Opponents to lodge direct evidence of certain matters and in
particular the evidence of an alleged distributor of the Opponents in
Singapore, one Paradise Trading Pte Ltd (Paradise).

6\. The opposition proceedings resumed on 5 June 2001 wherein the oral
evidence of one Mr Cheng Kwee Kiang, a director of Paradise, was taken and
submissions made.

7\. On 10 August 2001, Ms Lee allowed the opposition on the basis of s 15 of
the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) and the application by Permona was refused.

8\. Permona appealed against this decision and on 22 October 2001, I dismissed
the appeal.

9\. Permona has appealed against my decision.

_**  
ALLEGATIONS**_

10\. The Notice of Opposition stated that the Opponents manufacture and
specialise in the import and export of tobacco since 1985. The Notice
exhibited a brochure of CTIESC which describes itself as having set up its
business on 1 January 1985 specialising in the import and exprt of tobacco.

11\. The Notice of Opposition also stated that the Opponents have been
manufacturing and marketing tobacco products under various brands, one of
which is the CHUNGHWA brand of cigarettes.

12\. It was also alleged that the CHUNGHWA mark was used in China by them for
the last 25 years (from 1998 being the date of the Notice of Opposition).
Bearing in mind that the Opponents only started in this business since 1985,
the 25 years referred to should mean 12 or 13 years instead, at least in so
far as tobacco products are concerned.

13\. It was alleged that their goods were promoted and sold through the use of
(a) the Chinese characters , (b) the English transliteration which is CHUNGHWA
and (c) a pagoda device. The packaging illustrated showed (a) a pagoda device
with two decorative poles on each side of the pagoda (the pagoda device) with
the Chinese characters above the pagoda device and (b) a device showing one
decorative pole (the pole device) with the English words of Chunghwa
(stylised) across the pole device.

14\. Advertisements by Paradise exhibited in the statutory declaration dated
12 April 1999 of Xu Hu Lie showed the use of CHUNGHWA in block letters, the
Chinese characters and the pagoda device on a pack of cigarettes.

15\. The advertisements by Paradise also stated that the cigarettes were
available at airport duty free shops in Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam,
Cambodia and Indonesia.

16\. However, it was not clear exactly when the goods were sold in these
regions and under exactly which mark.

17\. According to the Notice of Opposition, the Opponents began marketing and
selling their goods through their Singapore distributor Paradise to Laos,
Cambodia and Vietnam under the CHUNGHWA mark in 1989. However there was no
concrete evidence of this.

18\. The Notice of Opposition and the statutory declaration of Mr Xu also
alleged that in 1989, the Opponents had applied to register the mark CHUNGHWA
and pagoda device in Singapore. This was done through one of their Hong Kong
distributors.

19\. This attempt purportedly included the Chinese characters. The application
was objected to and the applicant was directed by the Registrar of Trade Marks
to delete the Chinese characters. Eventually registration was granted under
registration no 43247 in respect of the device only which was the pagoda
device.

20\. It was alleged that by virtue of an assignment between the Hong Kong
distributor and the Opponents, the trade mark registration now stands in the
name of CTIESC.

21\. Mr Xus statutory declaration went on to say that the Opponents understood
the basis of the objection and consequent deletion of the Chinese characters
to be that these characters, when translated, mean China and hence
unregistrable in Singapore on the ground that that is a geographical name.
Accordingly, there was no application then to register the English
transliteration CHUNGHWA on the assumption that it would be objected to also.

22\. Permona did not contest the allegations regarding the background as to
how CTIESC obtained the benefit of the registration of the pagoda device,
without the Chinese characters and without CHUNGHWA, in Singapore.

23\. However, the certificate which was exhibited to Mr Xus statutory
declaration stated that it was with effect from 18 January 1968 and not 1989.

24\. The certificate was issued to Messrs Teck Soon Hong Limited which might
well have been a Singapore company. No search was provided of Teck Soon Hong
Limited. Also, the identity of the Hong Kong distributor was not stated in Mr
Xus statutory declaration or in the Notice of Opposition.

25\. Mr Xus statutory declaration also exhibited a trade mark search on 28
June 1998. While showing China Tobacco Import & Export Corporation, Shanghai
branch (slight difference in name from CTIESC) as the applicant/proprietor, it
also showed the application date to be 18 January 1968.

26\. In the next page of the search, the ownership history was stated to be
currently not available. The new proprietor was China Tobacco Import & Export
Corporation, Shanghai Branch and the acquisition date was stated to be 15 May
1989 and the lodgment date 24 May 1989. These dates appeared to pertain to the
date when CTIESC acquired the mark and not the date when the original
application was made.

27\. In the light of the documentary evidence, it appeared that the background
to CTIESC becoming the proprietor of the pagoda device, as alleged, was not
correct. Consequently the allegation about the reason for the Chinese
characters of CHUNGHWA being rejected was probably also not correct.

28\. It might even be that there was no attempt to register the Chinese
characters originally.

29\. In any event the burden was on the Opponents to establish what they
asserted. In my view they failed to discharge that burden on this point.

30\. The Opponents claimed that between 1992 to 1998, they had spent about
US$1m on advertising. However the supporting documents did not confirm this
figure. Some were in Chinese which were not translated. The others added to
about US$144,000 and S$65,000, say S$320,000 (using an exchange rate of US$1 =
S$1.75).

31\. Ms Anjali Iyer, Counsel for the Opponents, provided me with a list of the
amounts spent on advertisements from May 1989 to 29 January 1996. She said it
was based on the supporting documents. The total amount spent for
advertisements during this period i.e up to 29 January 1996 was about
S$160,000 although I had to take into account the fact that, at least in
Singapore, there have been restrictions on advertising cigarettes for sale for
some time.

32\. The dollar value of sales through Singapore to the region till 1996 was
supposed to be S$121,600,000 but there was no supporting document to
substantiate this.

33\. For Singapore, the sales from 1994 to 1998 was also supposedly about
US$4.5m or about S$7.9m (at an exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.75). However, the
supporting documents i.e invoices were only in Singapore currency. Moreover
they added up to about S$2m. From February 1994 to 29 January 1996, the figure
was substantially less i.e about S$340,000.

34\. The sales in Singapore were sales from Paradise to DFS Venture Singapore
(Pte) Limited (DFS Venture) which operates duty-free shops. Ms Iyer said that
one duty-free shop was at Changi Airport and another in the city.

35\. The Opponents also claimed that they had registered trade marks in other
countries. Most of these were after 29 January 1996 and the evidence for some
of them was not clear. I list out the information gleaned from the supporting
documents which were supposed to be certificates of registration of trade
marks:

> (a) There is supposed to be a registration of a mark in Taiwan but the
> document is entirely in the Chinese language and no English translation was
> provided.
>
> (b) 25 March 1994 - There is supposed to be a registration of the pole
> device in Vietnam but the copy of the document before me did not have an
> English translation. Also it was not clear from the copy whether the pole
> device has Chunghwa (stylised) printed across the pole. The proprietor of
> the mark is supposed to be CTIESC.
>
> (c) 17 December 1996 - There is a trade mark registration of the pole device
> with Chunghwa (stylised) printed across the pole. The applicant is CTIESC.
>
> (d) 1997 - There is supposed to be a trade mark registration in Myanmar of
> Chunghwa (stylised) and the pole device but the document appears to be more
> of a statutory declaration.
>
> (e) 20 January 1999 - There is a trade mark registration of the Chinese
> characters used by the Opponents and pagoda device in Canada which corrects
> an earlier registration on 19 November 1998. However the name of the
> proprietor or applicant is not obvious from the documents exhibited.
>
> (f) 25 January 1999 - There is a trade mark registration of the Chinese
> characters used by the Opponents and pagoda device in Australia. The owner
> of the mark is CTIESC.
>
> (g) 2 February 1999 - There is a trade mark registration of the Chinese
> characters used by the Opponents and the pagoda device in the United States
> Patent and Trademark Office. The registrant is CTIESC.

36\. Permonas Counter Statement was very brief consisting mainly of denials.
Its case was based on a statutory declaration by its Export Sales Manager
Ratna Tanuwidjaja declared on 21 August 1999.

37\. The statutory declaration was also rather brief. It did not disclose the
nature of Permonas business. It stated that the application was advertised on
3 April 1998 and that Permona intended to use and apply its trade mark in the
near future in Singapore.

38\. Paragraph 3 thereof stated:

> 3\. The Applicant [i.e Permona] derived the Trade Mark from the idea of
> Chinese Culture where Chinese are known as people who have a high respect to
> their culture, tradition and ancestor. Most of Singaporean (sic) are
> Chinese, it will be a good prospect to our cigarette market if we can create
> a brand name which related to Chinese and market it to Singapore. So we
> choose Chung Hwa as a brand which is given from the pronunciation and
> meaning of
>
> Annexed hereto marked as Exhibit "A" is a certified English translation of
> the Chinese Character .

39\. The certification was from Coleman Commercial & Language Centre dated 17
August 1999.

40\. It certified that the transliteration of the Chinese characters relied on
by Permona can be CHUNG HWA. However if the Hanyu Pinyin system is used, it
would be CHONG HUA.

41\. The certificate went on to give some meanings of each of the two Chinese
characters eg. : high, lofty, sublime, and : change, transform.

42\. However it did not purport to ascribe any meaning to these two Chinese
characters when considered together.

43\. Mr Xus statutory declaration in reply exhibited, inter alia, a
transliteration and translation from a sworn interpreter of the Supreme Court
of Singapore of the Chinese characters relied upon by Permona. The
transliteration was CHONG and HUA. The translation of each of the Chinese
characters used by Permona was given and was similar to that provided by
Coleman Commercial & Language Centre.

44\. However, the last sentence of the translation from the sworn interpreter
stated:

> The combination of the 2 Chinese characters, ( ), when read together,
> conveys no meaning.

45\. Ms Iyer also submitted that the New Century Chinese-English Dictionary
does not have a combination of these two Chinese characters.

_**  
MY DECISION**_

46\. The applicable law was the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) Revised Edition
1992. Ms Iyer relied on various provisions therein to oppose Permona.

_**  
Section 12(1)**_

47\. Section 12(1) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) states:

> 12(1) Any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used or
> proposed to be used by him who is desirous of registering it shall apply in
> writing to the Registrar in the prescribed manner for registration in Part A
> or B of the register.

48\. In Tiffany & Co v Fabriques de Tabac Reunies SA [1999] 3 SLR 147, Chief
Justice Yong Pung How, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal said, at
para 27:

> 27 . In Cornish on Intellectual Property (2nd Ed) which deals with the
> English position, the author comments that while the concept of proprietor
> clearly extends to a person who bona fide intends to use as well as one
> already using, it does not cover a person who copies anothers mark, even if
> the latter mark is not in use in the jurisdiction. The key ingredient in a
> successful opposition under s 12 of the Act is a misappropriation of the
> mark by the applicant.

49\. It was obvious that Permonas CHUNG HWA was very similar, if not
identical, to the Opponents CHUNGHWA. The only difference was that Permonas
mark was in two words whereas the Opponents mark was in one word. Permonas
CHUNG HWA was also similar phonetically and in spelling to the Opponents
Chunghwa in stylised form. For ease of reference, the following parts of my
grounds of decision will refer to the Opponents CHUNGHWA only i.e without the
stylised version.

50\. Permona had not used CHUNG HWA or the Chinese characters it relied on in
any trade prior to its application or since then, even up to the time of the
hearing before me.

51\. I have already alluded to the brief affidavit of Ratna Tanuwidjaja.

52\. What was more significant was that the two Chinese characters from which
Permonas CHUNG HWA was purportedly derived were supposed to mean Chinese
culture. However, although each character has its own meaning, the two
characters have no meaning when considered together.

53\. As for the fact that the Opponents did not apply to register their
CHUNGHWA mark prior to 29 January 1996, two cases were helpful to me.

54\. In _Vitamins Application_ [1951] RPC 1, the opponents had earlier sought
to apply for registration of their mark but decided to withdraw their
application, after the applicants refused to consent to the opponents
registration. The applicants then sought to register their mark.

55\. Mr Justice Lloyd-Jacobs said, at p 12, starting from line 51:

> There (sic) mere fact that the evidence available may not be sufficient to
> establish the right of a party to be entered upon the Registrar, does not of
> itself negative the proprietary right which that party had asserted by
> making his application nor does he necessarily deny such right by the
> withdrawal of the application.

56\. This reasoning was mentioned with approval by Mr Justice Wynn-Parry in
Brown Shoes Application [1959] RPC 29 at p 33 line 29 to 34 who said:

> In this case, the Appellants applied for registration in 1952. They were met
> by an objection by the Registrar under Sec. 9 of the Act, and in the event,
> did not pursue their application: but on the reasoning of Lloyd-Jacob, J.,
> in the Vitamins case I am not prepared to accept that the fact that the
> Appellants did not pursue their original claim can be regarded as complete
> abandonment of their rights.

57\. Although, in these two cases, there was a prior application by the party
opposing the current application, which prior application had been withdrawn,
and in Brown Shoes Application, the prior application was in fact re-
submitted, the legal position of the Opponents before me was no different from
those in the said two cases.

58\. The fact that the Opponents did not apply to register their CHUNGHWA mark
prior to 29 January 1996 did not necessarily mean that they had no proprietary
right to it. Neither did it mean that Permona was a bona fide proprietor of
its mark.

59\. Permona also avoided saying who in its organisation came up with the two
Chinese characters as combined together and the English transliteration.

60\. In my view, the two Chinese characters had been put together by Permona
in a belated and desperate attempt to explain how it had derived the English
transliteration CHUNG HWA. Obviously Permona did not want to rely on the same
Chinese characters as the Opponents did.

61\. It was clear to me that this was a blatant attempt by Permona to copy and
misappropriate the Opponents CHUNGHWA. I also accepted Ms Iyers submission
that Permona was hoping to register its mark so as to extract a payment from
the Opponents.

62\. Accordingly I concluded that Permona was not a bona fide proprietor of
the mark CHUNG HWA.

_**  
Section 15(1)**_

63\. Section 15(1) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) states:

> 15(1) It shall not be lawful to register as a trade mark or part of a trade
> mark any matter the use of which would, by reason of its being likely to
> deceive or cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a
> court of justice, or would be contrary to law or morality, or any scandalous
> design.

64\. Previously, the legal position appeared to be that there would be a
likelihood of deception or confusion if the mark or a similar one was already
enjoying a reputation in Singapore and this reputation could only be
established by use of the mark in Singapore by someone opposing the
application or someone else other than the applicant.

65\. However in Tiffany, Yong Pung How CJ said, at paras 36 and 40:

> 36 We are of the opinion that the views of the New Zealand Court of Appeal,
> and therefore Kan Ting Chiu Js as well, should be preferred in this regard.
> As Lord Upjohn himself commented in Bali, s 15 of the Act was designed not
> so much for the protection of other traders in the use of their marks or
> their reputation, but for the protection of the public. In this case, if
> true likelihood of confusion and deception can be shown, we are unable to
> see why use of the opposing mark is required within the jurisdiction before
> this may be established. Even without the appellants use of the mark Tiffany
> in Singapore at the time of the respondents application, there could be a
> real chance that a substantial number of members of the public would be
> confused into thinking that the respondents goods were somehow connected to
> or originated from the appellants. Furthermore, the Bali case was decided in
> 1969, during a time when tourism and the dissemination of information was
> not quite as widespread. Since then, modern technology and communication
> have improved at such a rapid rate that we in Singapore may be as familiar
> with famous international marks as someone in the country where the mark is
> actually in use. In this day and age, Lord Upjohns assertion that the
> practical likelihood of confusion or deception can only be shown by proving
> the existing user of the mark by someone else in the same jurisdiction can
> no longer hold true. In this respect, the learned judges example of the
> local publics knowledge of the name Viagra before it was launched here is
> especially apt in showing that reputation in Singapore is sufficient for
> confusion and deception to arise amongst members of the Singaporean public
> that would otherwise lead the mark applied for to be disentitled to
> protection in a court of justice.

> 37

> 38

> 39
>
> 40 We have therefore established that there need not be use of the mark
> Tiffany by the appellants or anyone else in Singapore for likelihood of

> previously.

66\. Although it was not necessary for the Opponents to establish that
CHUNGHWA cigarettes had been sold in Singapore, it would strengthen their
opposition if they could do so.

67\. On this point, Permona disputed that the sales through duty-free shops
constituted sales in Singapore.

68\. One of its arguments was that the sales were targeted at foreigners who
were purchasing for consumption outside Singapore.

69\. However, there was no evidence that such sales were in fact confined to
foreigners leaving Singapore.

70\. Mr Xus statutory declaration in reply challenged Permonas assertion. He
pointed out that Singaporeans, who travel frequently, also have access to the
duty-free shops and often purchase items from these shops for personal
consumption or as gifts for consumption in and outside Singapore. That is why
there are limits on duty free goods being brought into Singapore.

71\. I was of the view that Mr Xus position on this point was correct.

72\. Furthermore, even if the purchases were made by foreigners only, this did
not mean that the sales were outside Singapore.

73\. Permona also said that cigarette packets sold at the duty-free shops did
not contain a health warning or comply with local requirements regarding tax
and nicotine levels, unlike those sold in Singapore other than the duty-free
shops. Accordingly, Mr Paul Teo, Counsel for Permona, argued that the sales
were tainted with illegality and hence could not constitute sales in
Singapore.

74\. Mr Xus statutory declaration in reply said that duty-free shops were
required by Singapore law to acquire a licence from the relevant authority to
sell tobacco products in Singapore and he exhibited a copy of a licence
granted to DFS Venture dated 24 August 1998 from the Director of Medical
Services. Each licence is for one year.

75\. Ms Iyer also referred me to the Smoking (Control of Advertisements and
Sale of Tobacco) (Labelling) Regulations.

76\. Regulation 3 provides for health warnings to be printed on every
container of tobacco products. Regulation 2 defines container to include a
box, tin or packet.

77\. Regulation 4 requires the nicotine level to be also printed on each
container of cigarettes.

78\. Regulation 4A(1) prohibits the sale of any tobacco product which fails to
comply with any requirement under Regulation 3 or 4.

79\. However, Regulation 4A(2) permits the import or supply of tobacco
products which do not comply with Regulation 3 or 4 if (a) the tobacco
products are to be exported out of Singapore; (b) the tobacco products are not
to be offered for sale, sold or consumed in Singapore; and (c) the conditions
that the Director or Director-General of Customs and Excise may impose are
satisfied.

80\. Ms Iyer argued that the sales were permitted under Regulation 4A(2) and
were not contrary to law. I agreed. So long as DFS Venture possessed the
requisite licence, the sales were permitted by law, unless the licence was
obtained under false pretences.

81\. However, if the sales were permitted by virtue of Regulation 4A, then
this would appear to lend support to the first argument of Permona i.e that
the sales were not sales in Singapore.

82\. In my view, the intention was for these cigarettes to be consumed outside
Singapore but the fact was that they might be and some were probably consumed
in Singapore. Besides, whether they were consumed in or outside Singapore, the
sales would still have been made in Singapore. The duty-free shops were
located in Singapore territory and were subject to Singapore licensing laws.

83\. It was therefore not necessary for me to decide on Ms Iyers reliance on s
76 of the Trade Marks Act to establish use of the Opponents CHUNGHWA in
Singapore.

84\. I would add that the case of Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v Tong Seng
Produce Pte Ltd [1998] 1 SLR 1012 which Mr Teo relied on was not applicable.
The facts there were different as the coffee products were produced in
Singapore for export to Russia.

85\. The question then was whether the evidence considered as a whole gave
rise to some reputation of the Opponents CHUNGHWA in Singapore.

86\. On this point, Tiffany is also authority for the proposition that in
considering the evidence, regard should be had not only to the evidence as at
the date of the application to register the trade mark but also at the time
when the opposition proceedings were heard.

87\. I considered the evidence as at both cut-off dates.

88\. As at 29 January 1996, being the date of Permonas application, the amount
spent on advertisements was about S$160,000. By 1998, this had increased to
about S$320,000 (see paras 31 and 30 above). By June 2001, it would probably
have increased.

89\. As at 29 January 1996, the sales from Paradise to DFS Venture was about
$340,000. By 1998, it was about S$2m (see para 33 above). Again, by June 2001
such sales would probably have increased.

90\. Also by June 2001, the sales to other countries would probably also have
increased.

91\. On the other hand, I took into account the fact that the sales by DFS
Venture were from duty-free shops and the Opponents goods were not freely
available.

92\. I concluded that, even as at 29 January 1996, CHUNGHWA enjoyed some
reputation in Singapore. That reputation had increased since 29 January 1996.

93\. More importantly, the point was not so much whether the Opponents
business had enjoyed sufficient reputation in Singapore so as to be accorded
protection but the protection of the public (see Tiffany again).

94\. Bearing in mind that the two marks were phonetically identical and
visually very similar, it was obvious to me that there was a likelihood of
deception and confusion among the public between Permonas CHUNG HWA and the
Opponents CHUNGHWA. Duty-free shops are not patronised only by foreigners
leaving Singapore, but also by (a) tourists entering Singapore, (b) travelling
foreigners resident in Singapore and (c) travelling Singaporeans. It was
likely that these persons would be deceived and confused if Permona were to
attempt to sell cigarettes under the CHUNG HWA mark from other outlets in
Singapore.

  
_**Section 10**_

95\. Ms Iyer also made a submission based on s 10(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act
which stipulates that the intended mark must contain a word or words having no
direct reference to the character or quality of the goods and is not a
geographical name.

96\. She submitted that the meaning of the Chinese characters must be taken
into account, even though the mark Permona wanted to register was the English
transliteration.

97\. For this submission, she relied on the assertion that the Chinese
characters relied on by the Opponents means China and for that reason, it was
rejected in the original application by the Opponents alleged Hong Kong
distributor.

98\. This submission was premised on the alleged background as to how the
pagoda device came to be registered in Singapore alone (in the name of Teck
Soon Hong Limited) without the Chinese characters and also without the English
transliteration.

99\. I have dealt above with this alleged background. The Opponents failed to
establish it, even if the Chinese characters they relied on means China, or,
for that matter, Chinese.

100\. In any event, the issue was not so much what the Chinese characters
relied on by the Opponents mean but what the Chinese characters relied on by
Permona mean.

101\. As it was the Opponents case that the latter have no meaning, which I
accepted, it was not open to Ms Iyer to use the meaning of the Chinese
characters used by the Opponents to oppose Permonas application.

_**  
Section 12(2)**_

102\. Ms Iyer also sought to rely on s 12(2) of the Trade Marks Act which
gives the Registrar of Trade Marks a discretion to refuse or accept an
application absolutely or subject to such conditions as he may impose.

103\. Even if this could have been a separate ground of objection in addition
to s 12(1) and s 15(1), it was not necessary for me, in the circumstances, to
make a ruling under s 12(2).

104\. Accordingly, the opposition was successful under s 12(1) and s 15(1) of
the Trade Marks Act._****_
