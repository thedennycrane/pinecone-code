Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):

**Introduction**

1 This judgment relates to an appeal (_viz_ , Civil Appeal No 58 of 2008 (“the
Appeal”)) and a cross-appeal (_viz_ , Civil Appeal No 65 of 2008 (“the Cross-
Appeal”)) against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in
Originating Summons No 2038 of 2006 (“the Originating Summons”) (see _Wing Joo
Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co
Ltd_ [2008] 3 SLR 296 (“the Judgment”)).

2 The appellant in the Appeal was the plaintiff in the Originating Summons
(“the Plaintiff”). The first respondent in the Appeal was the first defendant
in that action (“the First Defendant”); it is also the proprietor of two trade
marks bearing the “rooster flower” (_ie_ , a picture of a rooster within a
stylised flower border). Both trade marks are registered in respect of, _inter
alia_ , cordyceps. One of the trade marks is registered in the Registry of
Trade Marks, Singapore (“the Opposed Mark”). The other trade mark is
registered in the Trade Marks Office of the People’s Republic of China (“the
China Mark”). The second respondent in the Appeal was the second defendant in
the Originating Summons (“the Second Defendant”); it is also the exclusive
licensee of the Opposed Mark in Singapore. As will be seen (at, _inter alia_ ,
[16] below), marks bearing the “rooster flower” have been used in the
cordyceps trade even before the registration of the China Mark and the Opposed
Mark. To avoid confusion, we shall in this judgment use the term “the Rooster
Sign” to refer generically to any sign or mark featuring the “rooster flower”
(whether or not registered as a trade mark) _other than_ the China Mark and
the Opposed Mark.

3 On 29 November 2005, search warrants premised on the First Defendant’s
registration of the Opposed Mark were executed against the Plaintiff. As a
result of the raid, cordyceps in the Plaintiff’s possession bearing marks
identical and/or similar to the Opposed Mark were seized. On 5 May 2006 and 11
May 2006, under the authority of fiats granted by the Attorney-General’s
Chambers, charges under the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the
current TMA”) and the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) were filed against
the Plaintiff and some of its directors (“the Plaintiff’s directors”) via
private summonses (“the Private Summonses”).

4 Approximately six months later, on 1 November 2006, the Plaintiff applied by
way of the Originating Summons for the registration of the Opposed Mark to be
revoked and/or invalidated. The Plaintiff also sought a declaration that any
copyright in various labels relating to the Opposed Mark (“the Labels”) did
not subsist in favour of either the First Defendant or the Second Defendant
and that the Plaintiff had not infringed any such copyright (“the
Declaration”).

5 The Judge dismissed the prayers for revocation and invalidation of the
registration of the Opposed Mark, but granted the Declaration (albeit limited
to the First Defendant). The Plaintiff has appealed to this court (via the
Appeal) against the Judge’s dismissal of the prayers for revocation and
invalidation, while the First Defendant has appealed to this court (via the
Cross-Appeal) against the Judge’s grant of the Declaration. To facilitate the
reading of this judgment, we set out below the schematic arrangement of its

**The factual matrix**

6 The _dramatis personae_ in the Originating Summons are companies involved in
the business of traditional Chinese medicines in general and cordyceps in
particular. The Plaintiff and the Second Defendant are companies registered in
Singapore. The First Defendant is a company registered in the People’s
Republic of China (“the PRC”), and it has described itself as the PRC’s
largest producer and exporter of cordyceps, accounting for 80% of the exports
of the product.

7 The First Defendant is the owner of the Opposed Mark and the China Mark,
which, as mentioned earlier (see [2] above), are registered in Singapore and
the PRC respectively for cordyceps (amongst other products). According to the
First Defendant, this was how it derived proprietorship of the Opposed Mark
and the China Mark:

(a) After trade mark registration was introduced in the PRC on 1 March 1983,
the Qinghai branch of China National Cereals, Oils & Foodstuffs Corp (“Qinghai
Cofco”) applied on 29 October 1984 to register the Rooster Sign as a trade
mark. There was no opposition to the application and the Rooster Sign was
registered in the PRC on 15 June 1985 as Trade Mark No 227740 (_ie_ , the
China Mark). In 1989, the rights in the China Mark were assigned by Qinghai
Cofco to Qinghai Medicines & Health Products Import & Export Corp (“Qinghai
Meheco”); the assignment was subsequently approved and recorded in the Trade
Marks Office of the PRC on 28 September 1995. The rights in the China Mark
were later assigned by Qinghai Meheco to the First Defendant by way of two
agreements dated 10 February 1999 and 14 August 2000 respectively, and the
assignment was approved and recorded by the Trade Marks Office of the PRC on
28 October 2000. On the legitimacy of the registration of the China Mark and
the subsequent assignments of the rights in that trade mark, the First
Defendant has in these proceedings declared that:[note: 1]

Since its registration more than 20 years ago, the China … Mark has never been
challenged by any party on any ground. No allegation has ever been made in
[the PRC] that copyright in the [China Mark] … does not subsist in favour of
the [First Defendant].

(b)  On 6 September 1995, Qinghai Meheco applied to register the Rooster Sign
at the Registry of Trade Marks, Singapore. The registration was opposed by a
partnership, Wing Thye Loong, but the opposition was successfully resisted
(see _Qinghai Medicines & Health Products Import and Export Corp v Wing Thye
Loong_ [2001] SGIPOS 2 (“ _Wing Thye Loong_ ”)) and a certificate recording
the registration of the Rooster Sign in Singapore as Trade Mark No T9508502Z
(_ie_ , the Opposed Mark) was issued on 27 August 2001, with the registration
backdated to take effect from 6 September 1995.

(c)  Subsequently, the Opposed Mark went through two assignments. It was first
assigned on 30 March 2001 by Qinghai Meheco to the First Defendant and another
entity, Qinghai Yixin Medicines Ltd (“Qinghai Yixin”), under a joint
acquisition agreement (“the Joint Acquisition Agreement”). Subsequently, on 28
May 2003, Qinghai Yixin assigned its rights in the Opposed Mark to the First
Defendant. On 12 August 2005, the First Defendant, notwithstanding that it had
become the sole owner of the Opposed Mark by then, and Qinghai Yixin applied
to the Registry of Trade Marks, Singapore, to be registered as the joint
proprietors of the Opposed Mark. Subsequently, on 13 March 2006, the First
Defendant applied to transfer the Opposed Mark to its sole name. A
“Certificate of Subsequent Proprietor” recording the First Defendant’s sole
proprietorship of the Opposed Mark, backdated to 30 May 2003, was issued by
the Registrar of Trade Marks on 8 June 2006.

8 On or about 25 July 2005, the First Defendant granted Yu Ceng Trading Pte
Ltd (“Yu Ceng”) an exclusive licence to use the Opposed Mark. On or around 20
August 2006, Yu Ceng’s licence was novated in favour of a related company,
_viz_ , the Second Defendant. Prior to the novation, the First Defendant
decided in 2005 to take enforcement action against the sale of cordyceps which
were not permitted to bear the Opposed Mark (“unauthorised cordyceps”). On 16
November 2005, the First Defendant issued a letter of authorisation to Yu Ceng
permitting the latter to take “such steps as [might] be necessary to protect
and enforce the [Opposed] Mark”.[note: 2] Before taking any enforcement
action, the First Defendant, through its representatives in Singapore,
cautioned the public at large against buying unauthorised cordyceps by sending
out more than 600 letters dated 6 September 2005 (one of which was received by
the Plaintiff) and placing half-page advertisements in _Shin Min Daily News_
and _Lianhe Wanbao_ on 8 September 2005.

9 On 29 November 2005, Yu Ceng applied for and obtained search warrants to
search the Plaintiff’s premises for unauthorised cordyceps. The search
warrants were executed against the Plaintiff on the same day and, as mentioned
earlier (at [3] above), cordyceps in the Plaintiff’s possession bearing marks
identical and/or similar to the Opposed Mark were seized. The cordyceps which
were seized had an approximate value of $4.8m. Some of the seized cordyceps
were later returned to the Plaintiff; the cordyceps which were returned had an
approximate value of about $1.8m.

10 On 5 May 2006 and 11 May 2006, under the authority of fiats granted by the
Attorney-General’s Chambers, charges under the current TMA and the Copyright
Act were filed against the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s directors via the
Private Summonses. The charges under the Copyright Act concerned the copyright
in the Labels.

11 On 1 November 2006, the Plaintiff applied by way of the Originating Summons
to, _inter alia_ , revoke and/or invalidate the registration of the Opposed
Mark. It also sought a declaration (_ie_ , the Declaration) that the copyright
in the Labels, which was the subject matter of the charges under the Copyright
Act, was not owned by either the First Defendant or the Second Defendant and
that the Plaintiff had not infringed the said copyright. Specifically, the
Plaintiff asked for:[note: 3]

1\. an Order that Trade Mark Registration No. T9508502Z [_ie_ , the Opposed
Mark] … be revoked pursuant to section 22(1) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap. 332)
(“the Act”) [_ie_ , the current TMA] as from 15 November 2005 or such other
date as this Honourable Court may deem fit;

2\. further or alternatively, an Order that Trade Mark Registration No.
T9508502Z … be declared invalid pursuant to section 23(1), (3)(b) and/or (4)
of the Act;

3\. a Declaration that any copyright in each of the [L]abels … or in any
literary or artistic work in each of the said labels does not subsist in
favour of the [First Defendant and the Second Defendant] or any of them and
that the Plaintiff has not infringed the copyright (if any) …

For ease of reference, we shall hereafter use (where appropriate) the terms
“Prayer 1”, “Prayer 2” and “Prayer 3” to denote, respectively, the first, the
second and the third of the prayers reproduced above.

12 One day after filing the Originating Summons, the Plaintiff also filed
Criminal Revision No 17 of 2006 (“the Criminal Revision”) for, _inter alia_ ,
the dismissal of the Private Summonses _._ One of the grounds given by the
Plaintiff was that the charges in the Private Summonses did not disclose the
commission of any offence.

13 On 27 June 2007, a few days before the hearing of the Originating Summons
(which was scheduled to start on 2 July 2007), the First Defendant filed
Summons No 2766 of 2007 (“the Summons”) for, _inter alia_ , Prayer 3 of the
Originating Summons (_ie_ , the prayer for the Declaration) to be struck out.
The Judge, however, refused to grant the application.

**The Plaintiff’s submissions in the High Court**

14 In its submissions before the Judge, the Plaintiff explained that in the
past, when the PRC operated a centrally-controlled economy, cordyceps came
from or were supplied by only a single state-owned company, namely, China
National Native Produce and Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation
(“China Tuhsu”). This company was the PRC’s first comprehensive state-owned
foreign trade company engaged in the trade of, _inter alia_ , native produce,
animal by-products, tea and processed goods. In the 1950s, China Tuhsu
established various provincial branch companies. The main provincial branch
companies dealing in cordyceps included Guangdong Tuhsu, Sichuan Tuhsu and
Qinghai Tuhsu. Of these companies, only Guangdong Tuhsu was authorised by
China Tuhsu to obtain purchase orders from overseas buyers.

15 Sometime in the 1980s, with the liberalisation of the PRC’s economy, China
Tuhsu’s other provincial branch companies, such as Sichuan Tuhsu and Qinghai
Tuhsu, were also allowed to directly sell and export cordyceps to overseas
buyers. Subsequently, other state-owned foreign trade companies, such as the
Foreign Trade Import & Export Corporation of Tibet Autonomous Region, China
National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp (“China Cofco”) and China Medicines
and Health Products Import & Export Corporation (“China Meheco”), as well as
the provincial branch companies of China Cofco and China Meheco (such as
Qinghai Cofco and Qinghai Meheco respectively) were likewise permitted to deal
directly with overseas buyers.

16 According to the Plaintiff, the Rooster Sign had been the mark used in the
PRC since the 1950s (when there was as yet no system for the registration of
trade marks) by all the Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies for their
cordyceps. The cordyceps which were imported from the PRC and sold in
Singapore had labels bearing the Rooster Sign, except for cordyceps sold
unpackaged, which did not have any labels affixed on them. As all the Chinese
cordyceps-exporting companies used the Rooster Sign for their products, they
would compete with each other:[note: 4]

… in other respects, such as price, quality of service and relationship. Each
of the companies would claim that its cordyceps were of a better quality than
those from another company or another province. Hence, in order to distinguish
the cordyceps of one company from those of another, they [_ie_ , the Chinese
cordyceps-exporting companies] would indicate in the labels the particular
provincial company which supplied the cordyceps concerned.

17 The Plaintiff stated that the registration of the Rooster Sign in the PRC
as a trade mark (_ie_ , as the China Mark) came as a surprise to the Chinese
cordyceps-exporting companies (other than Qinghai Cofco and Qinghai Meheco) as
it had been obtained without their prior knowledge or consent. The
registration of the China Mark was announced for the first time in June 1995
in Xining at a meeting of the main Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies (“the
Xining Meeting”). This meeting was organised by the Chamber of Commerce for
Import/Export of Medicine & Health Products (“the China Chamber of Commerce”),
a body set up by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to
regulate the export of cordyceps and address the emergence of disorderly
competition amongst Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies following market
liberalisation.

18 The Plaintiff’s case _vis-à-vis_ revocation of the registration of the
Opposed Mark was, firstly, that the registration should be revoked pursuant to
ss 22(1)(_a_) and 22(1)(_b_) of the current TMA due to lack of use of the
Opposed Mark. Section 22(1) provides that:

The registration of a trade mark may be revoked on any of the following
grounds:

(_a_) that, within the period of 5 years following the date of completion of
the registration procedure, [the trade mark] has not been put to genuine use
in the course of trade in Singapore, by the proprietor or with his consent, in
relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no
proper reasons for non-use;

(_b_) that such use has been suspended for an uninterrupted period of 5 years,
and there are no proper reasons for non-use …

The Plaintiff argued that these provisions entailed that “a registered trade
mark must be used as a _trade mark_ (that is, to indicate the origin or source
of the goods or services in question)”[note: 5] [emphasis in original]. As for
whether the Opposed Mark had been put to such use, the Plaintiff stated:[note:
6]

[T]here was no such use in respect of the [Opposed] Mark for the period of 5
years since the date of completion of the registration procedure (27 August
2001). [The Plaintiff’s] evidence is that the [Rooster Sign] has been used in
Singapore since the 1950s in relation to cordyceps imported from [the PRC] and
has been perceived as such and that the use was not (and was not perceived to
be …) to distinguish the cordyceps of one company or undertaking from another.
Each of the Chinese provincial companies [put] its own name as well as the
name of its [_sic_] on the labels to distinguish its cordyceps from another
company’s. Such use continued during the said 5-year period.

19 The Plaintiff also asserted that the registration of the Opposed Mark
should be revoked under s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA, which provides that
the registration of a trade mark may be revoked if “in consequence of [the]
acts or [the] inactivity of the proprietor, [the trade mark] has become the
common name in the trade for the product or service for which it is
registered”. The Plaintiff elaborated:[note: 7]

26\. … [T]he Rooster [Sign] and Rooster labels [_ie_ , labels featuring the
Rooster Sign] have been openly used in Singapore since at least the 1950s in
relation to cordyceps from the various Chinese provincial companies. Both
Qinghai Meheco and the [First] Defendant … were at all material times well
aware of the use. …

27\. … [T]he Rooster [Sign] was, and still is, commonly associated by
cordyceps traders and customers in Singapore as denoting cordyceps from [the
PRC]. In particular, they do not associate the Rooster [Sign] with any
particular trader or source. They do not consider it to be a mark which
distinguishes the cordyceps of one trader from those of another. Whenever they
see the Rooster [Sign], mention it (verbally or otherwise) or hear it, they
would intuitively have in mind cordyceps imported from [the PRC].

20 As regards invalidation of the registration of the Opposed Mark, the
Plaintiff’s case was presented under four heads. The first was that at the
time of Qinghai Meheco’s application to register the Rooster Sign as a trade
mark in Singapore, it was customary to use that sign to denote cordyceps
imported from the PRC. As such, the registration of the Opposed Mark should be
invalidated under s 23(1) of the current TMA, which allows for the
invalidation of (_inter alia_) “trade marks which consist exclusively of signs
or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the
bona fide and established practices of the trade” (see s 7(1)(_d_) of the
current TMA).

21 The second ground relied on by the Plaintiff was that as a result of the
extensive use of the Rooster Sign since the 1950s, the Opposed Mark (which
featured the Rooster Sign) was not capable of distinguishing the cordyceps of
one supplier from those of another supplier and therefore could not be
considered to be a “trade mark”, which is defined in s 2(1) of the current TMA
as:

… any sign capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of
distinguishing goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade
by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other
person …

For this reason, the Plaintiff submitted, the registration of the Opposed Mark
should be invalidated under s 23(1), which allows the registration of (_inter
alia_) “signs which do not satisfy the definition of a trade mark in section
2(1)” (_per_ s 7(1)(_a_)) to be invalidated.

22 The third limb of the Plaintiff’s case _vis-à-vis_ invalidation of the
registration of the Opposed Mark was that the registration should be
invalidated pursuant to s 23(1) of the current TMA because the application to
register that mark had been “made in bad faith” (see s 7(6) of the current
TMA). In this regard, the Plaintiff contended that Qinghai Meheco’s
application in September 1995 to register the Rooster Sign in Singapore (_ie_
, the application which led to the Rooster Sign being registered in Singapore
as the Opposed Mark) had been made in bad faith because Qinghai Meheco did not
have the exclusive right to use the Rooster Sign then in so far as other
Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies, including Sichuan Meheco, Chongqing
Meheco and Guangdong Meheco, were also supplying cordyceps bearing the Rooster
Sign to Singapore.

23 The fourth head which the Plaintiff relied on was that there had been fraud
and/or misrepresentation in the registration of the Opposed Mark. Pursuant to
s 23(4) of the current TMA:

The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground of
fraud in the registration or [on the ground] that the registration was
obtained by misrepresentation.

The Plaintiff averred that there had been fraud and/or misrepresentation on
the part of the First Defendant in obtaining the registration of
proprietorship of the Opposed Mark in, first, the First Defendant’s and
Qinghai Yixin’s joint names and, subsequently, the First Defendant’s sole
name. According to the Plaintiff (see [25] of the Judgment):

[T]here were indeed untrue statements made by the [First] Defendant to [the
Registrar of Trade Marks]. Specifically, [the First Defendant] misrepresented
and failed to disclose material facts and documents to [the Registrar of Trade
Marks] on 2 occasions:

(1) when the [First] Defendant and Qinghai Yixin applied to be registered as
the proprietors [of the Opposed Mark] in August 2005; and

(2) when [the First Defendant] applied to be registered as the only proprietor
in March 2006.

In particular, [the First Defendant] materially misrepresented and/or failed
to disclose material facts and documents to [the Registrar of Trade Marks]
relating to its proprietorship of the [Opposed Mark] (or, rather, the lack
thereof).

24 With regard to the Declaration, the Plaintiff submitted that there was no
evidence that copyright in the Labels subsisted in Singapore in favour of the
First Defendant and/or the Second Defendant.

**The decision of the Judge**

25 Although the Plaintiff chose to begin the proceedings by way of an
originating summons, the Judge ordered the deponents of the affidavits filed
by the respective parties to be available for cross-examination. Over the
course of nine days, 17 witnesses were called upon to testify.

26 On 9 April 2008, in a reserved judgment (_ie_ , the Judgment), the Judge
dismissed the Plaintiff’s application to revoke and/or invalidate the
registration of Opposed Mark, but granted the Declaration _vis-à-vis_ the
First Defendant. In the main, the Judge held as follows:

(a) The registration of the Opposed Mark could not be revoked under ss
22(1)(_a_) and 22(1)(_b_) of the current TMA. The Plaintiff’s contention,
_viz_ , that the Opposed Mark had not actually functioned as a trade mark
after its registration as it was the common name in the trade, “[could not]
constitute [an argument on] non-use or suspension of use, and relate[d]
[instead] to the _effect_ of the use of the mark, which should be considered
under the application to invalidate the registration” [emphasis in original]
(see [19] of the Judgment).

(b)  The registration of the Opposed Mark could not be revoked under s
22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA as, _inter alia_ (see [16] of the Judgment):

On the [P]laintiff’s case, the [Rooster Sign] was the common name in the trade
for cordyceps as early as the 1950s, and certainly by the 1980s, and it could
not possibly have become the common name as a consequence of [the] acts or
[the] inactivity of the [F]irst [D]efendant or its predecessors in title.

(c)  The registration of the Opposed Mark could not be invalidated under s
7(1)(_d_) read with s 23(1) of the current TMA as the evidence did not show
that the Rooster Sign had become generic or “customary in the current language
or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade” (_per_ s
7(1)(_d_)). This was because the evidence showed that the word “Rooster” by
itself, without reference to cordyceps, was not understood to refer to
cordyceps from the PRC, and “the ‘Rooster’ mark or brand [was] not synonymous
[with] cordyceps in the way ‘thermos’ [was] synonymous [with] vacuum flasks”
(see [33] of the Judgment).

(d) The registration of the Opposed Mark could not be invalidated under s 7(6)
read with s 23(1) of the current TMA. With the registration of the Rooster
Sign in the PRC (as the China Mark) in 1985 in favour of Qinghai Cofco (the
predecessor in title of Qinghai Meheco), other Chinese cordyceps-exporting
companies had no right to use the Rooster Sign (see [53] of the Judgment). The
Judge elaborated (_ibid_):

When Qinghai Meheco applied to register the [Rooster Sign] in Singapore in
1995 on that basis and against that background, the application was open to
opposition by … [other Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies]. It may be that
if a proper opposition [had been] put up, the application might not have been
approved, but that cannot mean that the application was made in bad faith in
the first place.

(e) The registration of the Opposed Mark could not be invalidated under s
23(4) of the current TMA. While the Plaintiff’s application was to have the
registration of _the Opposed Mark_ invalidated, the complaint of fraud and/or
misrepresentation in fact related to the registration of the two _assignments
of the Opposed Mark_ (see sub-para (c) of [7] above), which was a completely
different matter altogether (see [26] of the Judgment). Such a complaint, the
Judge held, was outside the scope of s 23(4) (_ibid_). In any event, on the
available evidence, the Plaintiff had not proved that the applications to
register those assignments were affected by fraud and/or misrepresentation
(see [60] of the Judgment).

(f) The registration of the Opposed Mark could, however, be invalidated
pursuant to s 23(1) read with s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA as the Opposed
Mark was a mark “which [did] not satisfy the definition of a trade mark in
section 2(1)” (_per_ s 7(1)(_a_)). In this regard, the Judge held (at [49] of
the Judgment):

There is unrebutted evidence that at the time of the application [by Qinghai
Meheco] for registration [of the Rooster Sign] in Singapore in 1995, the
[Rooster Sign] was used in Singapore on cordyceps of other suppliers besides
Qinghai Meheco and, therefore, that the [Rooster Sign] was not a trade mark as
it did not distinguish Qinghai Meheco’s cordyceps from that of the other
suppliers which use[d] the same mark [_ie_ , the Rooster Sign].

(g) Although the registration of the Opposed Mark could be invalidated under s
23(1) read with s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA, this did _not_ entail that the
registration _had to be_ invalidated. The Judge was of the view that it would
be “a rather broad proposition” (see [63] of the Judgment) to say that the
court had absolutely no discretion not to revoke or invalidate the
registration of a trade mark which fell within ss 22(1) or 23(1) respectively
of the current TMA. He held that while it was correct that the power to revoke
or invalidate the registration of a trade mark should be exercised when a
proper case for revocation or invalidation arose, “that [could not] exclude
the converse” (see [70] of the Judgment). In other words, “in situations where
the Registrar [of Trade Marks] or [the] Court [found] that there [were] good
reasons for not deregistering a mark, they should not be compelled to
deregister it” (_ibid_). These considerations, amongst others, led the Judge
to conclude that ss 22(1) and 23(1) of the current TMA should be construed so
as to give the court and the Registrar of Trade Marks a discretion not to
revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade mark even though the
requisite conditions for granting relief had been established (see [76] of the
Judgment).

(h) The power to revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade mark should
be exercised with care, bearing in mind that “an important function of a trade
mark registration regime [was] to ensure order in the use of trade marks” (see
[78] of the Judgment). This power, the Judge stated, should only be exercised
“after all the relevant circumstances [were] taken into consideration”
(_ibid_). The relevant circumstances in this regard included “(a) the
triggering factor; (b) the conditions at the time of the application to
revoke; and (c) the balance of the interests involved” (see [79] of the
Judgment) as well as “the conduct of the [party applying for revocation or
invalidation]” (see [80] of the Judgment).

(i) On the facts before him, the Judge found that the Opposed Mark was being
used by only the First Defendant and the Second Defendant as the other users
of the Rooster Sign (which forms the essence of the Opposed Mark) had ceased
using that sign after it was registered in Singapore (as the Opposed Mark).
Accordingly, there was no confusion or deception arising from the First
Defendant’s and the Second Defendant’s use of the Opposed Mark (see [85] of
the Judgment). The Judge noted the Plaintiff’s allegation that the Opposed
Mark was being used by unauthorised parties, but took the view that the remedy
for such improper use was to commence enforcement proceedings and not to
remove the mark itself (_ibid_). The Judge elaborated (_ibid_):

[T]he [First Defendant and the Second Defendant] in taking action to promote
the mark [_ie_ , the Opposed Mark] and protect it from infringement are
exercising their existing legal rights. The [P]laintiff, on the other hand,
has no interest in the mark. It does not claim ownership of the mark. Its case
was that because the mark should not have been registered, the registration
should be set aside now, and conditions [should] be allowed to revert to the
pre-registration state when the same mark [_ie_ , the Rooster Sign] was used
for all Chinese cordyceps.

(j) After reviewing the relevant facts and balancing the different interests,
the Judge held that the _status quo_ should be maintained and the registration
of the Opposed Mark should be allowed to remain (see [86] of the Judgment).

(k) With regard to the Plaintiff’s prayer for the Declaration (_ie_ , Prayer 3
of the Originating Summons), the Judge stated (see [98]–[99] of the Judgment):

98 The process of proof of the [F]irst [D]efendant’s claim to the copyrights
can be broken up into stages. When it claims ownership, the onus of proof is
on it. To discharge the onus, it has to present proper and credible evidence.
If it does that, the evidential burden shifts to the [P]laintiff to rebut the
evidence. But if [the First Defendant] fails to present any proper and
credible evidence, its claim fails even if the [P]laintiff does not put up any
evidence of its own, because there is nothing to rebut.

99 … [T]he [F]irst [D]efendant has failed to prove its claim, and … the
[P]laintiff has made a case for [the] declaration sought in Prayer 3 but
restricted to the [F]irst [D]efendant as the [S]econd [D]efendant has never
claimed to be the owner of the copyrights.

27 In the result, the Judge made the following order (see [100] of the
Judgment):

I dismiss [Prayer] 1 and [Prayer] 2 with costs. With reference to Prayer 3, I
make the [D]eclaration, restricted to the [F]irst [D]efendant. The [F]irst
[D]efendant shall pay the [P]laintiff costs, and the [P]laintiff shall pay the
[S]econd [D]efendant costs on this prayer.

**The issues before this court**

**_The issues raised in the Appeal_**

28 The Plaintiff has appealed against:

(a) firstly, the Judge’s refusal to revoke the registration of the Opposed
Mark on the grounds which it advanced (as set out at [18]–[19] above);

(b) secondly, the Judge’s refusal to invalidate the registration of the
Opposed Mark on the grounds which it advanced (as set out at [20]–[23] above);

(c) thirdly, the Judge’s ruling that ss 22(1) and 23(1) of the current TMA
give the court and the Registrar of Trade Marks a discretion not to revoke or
invalidate the registration of a trade mark even though the grounds for
revocation or the grounds for invalidation specified in the respective
provisions have been made out (see sub-para (g) of [26] above); and

(d) the Judge’s decision, pursuant to the exercise of the aforementioned
discretion, not to invalidate the registration of the Opposed Mark even though
the registration had been effected in breach of s 7(1)(_a_) of the current
TMA.

We should add that the First Defendant has, in its response to the Appeal,
challenged the Judge’s finding that the Opposed Mark had been registered in
breach of s 7(1)(_a_).

29  The Plaintiff has also appealed against the Judge’s order on costs.
According to the Plaintiff, the Judge did not make it clear in the Judgment
that he was referring to only one set of costs for the First Defendant and the
Second Defendant combined when he ordered Prayer 1 and Prayer 2 of the
Originating Summons (_ie_ , the prayers for, respectively, revocation and
invalidation of the registration of the Opposed Mark) to be dismissed with
costs. On the assumption that the correct interpretation of [100] of the
Judgment (which is set out at [27] above) is that the Judge ordered the
Plaintiff to pay a separate set of costs to the Second Defendant in respect of
Prayer 1 and Prayer 2, the Plaintiff has appealed against that order.

**_The issues raised in the Cross-Appeal_**

30 The First Defendant has appealed against the decision of the Judge to grant
the Declaration; it contends that the Plaintiff has not discharged the
requisite legal and evidential burden to justify the grant of the Declaration.

31 In response to the Cross-Appeal, the Plaintiff has raised a preliminary
issue – namely, that the First Defendant is precluded by the doctrine of _res
judicata_ from arguing the issue of whether the court should grant the
Declaration as that issue had already been decided by the Judge when he
refused to grant the application in the Summons (see [13] above).

**_Our approach to the issues raised by the parties_**

32 We will now proceed to examine _seriatim_ the issues raised by the parties.
They can be summarised as follows:

(a)  whether the Judge erred in holding that the registration of the Opposed
Mark could not be revoked under s  22(1)(_a_) of the current TMA;

(b)  whether the Judge erred in holding that the registration of the Opposed
Mark could not be revoked under s  22(1)(_b_) of the current TMA;

(c) whether the Judge erred in holding that the registration of the Opposed
Mark could not be revoked under s  22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA;

(d) whether the Judge erred in holding that the registration of the Opposed
Mark could not be invalidated under s 23(1) read with s  7(1)(_d_) of the
current TMA;

(e) whether the Judge erred in holding that the registration of the Opposed
Mark could be invalidated under s 23(1) read with s  7(1)(_a_) of the current
TMA (although he ultimately decided, in the exercise of his discretion, not to
order invalidation based on this particular ground);

(f) whether the Judge erred in holding that the registration of the Opposed
Mark could not be invalidated under s 23(1) read with s  7(6) of the current
TMA;

(g) whether the Judge erred in holding that the registration of the Opposed
Mark could not be invalidated under s 23(4) of the current TMA;

(h) whether the court has a residual discretion under ss 22(1) and 23(1) of
the current TMA not to revoke or invalidate the registration of a registered
trade mark even though one or more of the grounds for revocation or the
grounds for invalidation set out in those provisions have been made out;

(i) whether the First Defendant is prevented by the doctrine of _res judicata_
from raising in the Cross-Appeal arguments on whether the court should grant
the Declaration;

(j) whether the Judge should have granted the Declaration given the
circumstances of this case;

(k) whether the Plaintiff has discharged the requisite legal and evidential
burden to justify the grant of the Declaration; and

(l) whether a separate set of costs should be paid by the Plaintiff to the
Second Defendant in relation to Prayer 1 and Prayer 2 of the Originating
Summons.

**Revocation and invalidation of the registration of the Opposed Mark**

**_The burden of proof_**

33 It is trite law that the legal burden of proof needed to substantiate an
action for revocation and/or invalidation of the registration of a trade mark
lies throughout on the plaintiff. An exception to this rule, _ie_ , a reversal
of the burden, is provided in s 105 of the current TMA in relation to the use
of a registered trade mark. This provision states:

**Burden of proving use of trade mark**

**105.** If in any civil proceedings under this Act a question arises as to
the use to which a registered trade mark has been put, it is for the
proprietor to show what use has been made of it.

34 The commentary on s 105 in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 13(3)
(LexisNexis, 2007) is germane, and is as follows (see fn 13 to para 160.620):

[T]his section _effectively reverses the burden of proof_. Generally, the
registration [of a trade mark] is prima facie evidence of the validity of the
original registration. However, s 105 places the burden on the proprietor;
this is as it should be as it is difficult to prove a negative fact, ie that
the proprietor has not used the mark. This reversal has a concrete
ramification under the Trade Marks Rules (Cap 332, R 1, 2000 [Rev] Ed) r 58(3)
where the proprietor is required to file, together with the counter-statement,
evidence of use by him of the trade mark. [emphasis added]

**_Revocation of the registration of the Opposed Mark_**

35 The Plaintiff submits that the registration of the Opposed Mark should be
revoked pursuant to ss 22(1)(_a_) and 22(1)(_b_) of the current TMA as the
Opposed Mark was not put to genuine use as a trade mark during the requisite
five-year period stipulated in these provisions. In addition, the Plaintiff
contends that the registration of the Opposed Mark should be revoked pursuant
to s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA as the Opposed Mark has become a “common
name in the trade” (_per_ s 22(1)(_c_)) for cordyceps from the PRC as a
consequence of the acts or the inactivity of the First Defendant or its
predecessor in title (_viz_ , Qinghai Meheco).

_Sections 22(1)(_ a _) and 22(1)(_ b _): Lack of genuine use and non-use of
the impugned trade mark_

36 The Plaintiff’s first ground for revocation, which (as just mentioned) is
premised on ss 22(1)(_a_) and 22(1)(_b_) of the current TMA, requires either a
lack of “genuine use” (_per_ s 22(1)(_a_)) for a period of “5 years following
the date of completion of the registration procedure” (_ibid_) or “non-use”
(_per_ s 22(1)(_b_)) for “an uninterrupted period of 5 years … [with] no
proper reasons for non-use” (_ibid_). At this point, we ought to state that we
agree with the Judge that the Plaintiff’s contention that the Opposed Mark did
not actually _function_ as a trade mark after being registered should not be
considered under these two grounds for revocation as this contention does not
relate to the use or non-use of the Opposed Mark, but pertains instead to the
_effect_ of the use of that mark (see [19] of the Judgment; see also sub-para
(a) of [26] above). In our view, the key question in relation to ss 22(1)(_a_)
and 22(1)(_b_) would be whether there has been _use_ of the Opposed Mark as a
trade mark which can be considered to be _genuine_. Bearing in mind that the
Originating Summons was filed approximately five years after the date of
completion of the registration procedure (_ie_ , 27 August 2001, the date on
which the certificate of registration of the Opposed Mark was issued to
Qinghai Meheco), if there was genuine use of the Opposed Mark anytime during
the five-year period from 27 August 2001 onwards (“the Relevant Period”), it
would mean that the Plaintiff’s allegation of non-use for “an uninterrupted
period of 5 years” (_per_ s 22(1)(_b_)) would not be made out. Thus, proof of
any genuine use of the Opposed Mark during the Relevant Period would
completely undermine the complaint of the Plaintiff under both ss 22(1)(_a_)
and 22(1)(_b_).

(1) The requirement of “genuine use”

37 The concept of “genuine use” in s 22(1)(_a_) of the current TMA was
discussed extensively by V K Rajah JA in _Weir Warman Ltd v Research &
Development Pty Ltd_ [2007] 2 SLR 1073 (“ _Warman_ ”). In that case, Rajah JA
began by observing that the concept of “genuine use” was closely linked to the
function of a trade mark and the purpose of registering a trade mark. He
stated (at [99]):

It must be noted at the outset that this requirement of “genuine use” is
closely intertwined with the function of a trade mark and the purpose of
registration … A trade mark serves to indicate the source of the goods to
which it is affixed and registration facilitates and protects this function of
the trade mark. There must be genuine use of the trade mark before its
function is served and protection by registration is justified. Further, as
the register also serves as a notice to rival traders of trade marks that
[are] already in use, to allow a mark that is not _bona fide_ in use to remain
on the register would be deceptive and could permit the registered proprietor
to unfairly hijack or usurp a mark and/or monopolise it to the exclusion of
other legitimate users.

38 Rajah JA then proceeded to consider (_id_ at [100]) _Ansul BV v Ajax
Brandbeveiliging BV_ [2003] ETMR 85 (“ _Ansul_ ”), where the European Court of
Justice (“the ECJ”) interpreted the concept of “genuine use” under Art 12(1)
of the First Directive 89/104/EEC of the Council, of 21 December 1988, to
Approximate the Laws of the Member States Relating to Trade Marks (“the
European Trade Marks Directive”), which is the European equivalent of s
22(1)(_a_) of the current TMA. It was indicated in _Ansul_ that for use of a
trade mark to be considered genuine, the use in question did not have to be
significant in the _quantitative_ sense provided it was in accordance with the
_essential function_ of a trade mark, which was described by the ECJ as being
“to guarantee the identity of the origin of the goods or services for which it
[was] registered … in order to create or preserve an outlet for those goods or
services” (at [43]). However, “token use for the sole purpose of preserving
the rights conferred by the mark” (_ibid_) or use which was “just internal use
by the [proprietor] concerned” (see _Ansul_ at [37]) should not be considered
to be genuine use. The ECJ stated that in assessing whether use of a trade
mark was genuine (_id_ at [43]):

[R]egard must be had to all the facts and circumstances relevant to
establishing whether the commercial exploitation of the mark is real,
particularly whether such use is viewed as warranted in the economic sector
concerned to maintain or create a share in the market for the goods or
services protected by the mark, the nature of those goods or services, the
characteristics of the market and the scale and frequency of use of the mark.

39 In a case involving the “Laboratoire de La Mer” mark, _viz_ , _Laboratoire
de La Mer Trade Marks_ [2002] FSR 51, the English High Court had the occasion
to consider this point. There, it was stated in respect of s 46 of the Trade
Marks Act 1994 (c 26) (UK) (“the English Trade Marks Act”), which is similar
to s 22 of the current TMA, that there was no rule that _de minimis_ use of a
trade mark could not be “genuine use” for the purposes of that provision.
Jacob J opined (at [28]–[32] of _Laboratoire de La Mer Trade Marks_):

28 I turn to the present, European, legislation, focusing on the adjective
“genuine.” Other languages may not convey quite the same flavour. The
corresponding adjectives used in other language versions of the legislation
are, in French “serieux”, German “ernsthaft”, Italian “effettivo”, Spanish
“efectivo”, Portuguese “serio”, Dutch “normaal”, Danish “reel” and Swedish
“verkligt”. The researches of counsel did not provide the Greek or [the]
Finnish words, but no matter. The flavour of some of the words used may mean
that use must be more than very slight, even where that use has been without
ulterior purpose. “Serious” may mean that insubstantial [use] does not count.
If that is so, a further question would arise: “how do you decide that a use
is too slight to count?” After all what might be “slight” for a large company
might be not insignificant for a small one.

29 … I take the view that _provided there is nothing artificial about a
transaction under a mark, then it will amount to “genuine” use. There is no
lower limit of “negligible.” However, the smaller the amount of use, the more
carefully must it be proved, and the more important will it be for the trade
mark owner to demonstrate that the use was not merely “colourable” or “token”,
that is to say done with the ulterior motive of validating the registration_.
Where the use is not actually on the goods or the packaging (for instance [if
the use] is in advertisement) then one must further inquire whether that
advertisement was really directed at customers here [_ie_ , in the UK]. For
then the place of use is also called into question …

30 … As a matter of commerce small sales are nonetheless sales under and so
uses of the mark. The objective observing trader or consumer would so say. The
absence of any purpose, other than trying to sell goods under the mark, would
lead him to the conclusion that the uses were genuine.

31 Moreover there are real problems if one tries to formulate a _de_ _minimis_
rule. Does the amount of use depend on the size of the trade mark owner’s
enterprise? Does it matter whether he is relying upon use by importation
rather than local sale? How little is too little? Does it matter whether the
use is in the beginning, [the] middle or [the] end of the relevant period? And
so on.

32 Nor do I think that the absence of a _de_ _minimis_ rule significantly
affects the policy behind the legislation. Yes, marks must be used within the
relevant period, but there seems [to be] no reason to make a trader who has
actually made some small, but proper, use of his mark, lose it [_ie_ , the
registration of his mark]. Only if his use is in essence a pretence at trade
should he do so. And of course, if he has only made limited use of his mark it
is likely that the use will be only for a limited part of his specification of
services. If he has a wider specification that can and should be cut back to
just those goods for which he has made use [of the mark]. That would leave him
with just a small umbra and a correspondingly reduced penumbra.

[emphasis added]

40 It should be noted that Jacob J emphasised that the foregoing merely
represented his “own provisional views” (see _Laboratoire de La Mer Trade
Marks_ at [24]). He went on to refer to the ECJ the question of “whether a
very limited amount of use definitely in [the UK could] be regarded as
sufficient to be ‘genuine’” (_id_ at [22]). The ECJ, in its decision on the
matter (_viz_ , _La Mer Technology Inc v Laboratoires Goemar SA_ [2004] FSR
38), appeared to uphold Jacob J’s view that there was no rule barring _de
minimis_ use from being regarded as genuine use, stating that “even minimal
use of the mark or use by only a single importer … [could] be sufficient to
establish genuine use” (_id_ at [27]). Subsequently, the English Court of
Appeal, in further proceedings involving the “Laboratoire de La Mer” mark
(_viz_ ,_Laboratoires Goemar SA v La Mer Technology Inc_ [2005] ETMR 114),
held (at [45]–[46]) that use of a trade mark did not have to be substantial or
significant before it could be considered to be genuine, although “the more
limited the use of the mark in terms of the person or persons to whom it [was]
communicated, the more doubtful any tribunal [might] be as to whether the use
[was] genuine as opposed to token” (at [48]). It is also interesting to note
that under the previous trade mark legislation regime in force in England
(which prescribed _bona fide_ use rather than genuine use as the applicable
criterion), there was likewise no rule barring _de minimis_ use from
constituting _bona fide_ use. As Jacob J observed in _Laboratoire de La Mer
Trade Marks_ (at [24] and [26]–[27]):

24 … [O]ur prior legislation … required that there be “bona fide use” of a
trade mark within a relevant period (see section 26 of the Trade Marks Act
1938 [(c 22) (UK)]).

…

26 … [W]here there was no question of a hidden motive behind the use, the
courts were prepared to regard even small quantities of sales under the mark
as sufficient to constitute bona fide use. _A little use coupled with [a]
genuine intention to establish a market in [the] goods under the mark would
suffice_ (_Bon_ _Matin Trade Mark_ [1989] R.P.C. 537).

27 Thus under our old law there was no rule of _de_ _minimis_. If a use was
only slight, that might, depending on other circumstances, show that the
trader was not genuine in his activities … One would compare the use actually
made with the size of the organisation, how it and similar entities normally
went about marketing and so on. A big trader who had made only limited sales
would particularly have to explain what was going on. If the main or a
principal motive was trade mark protection rather than simply making sales
under the mark, then the use was not “bona fide”.

[emphasis added]

41 Other legal proceedings concerning the “Laboratoire de La Mer” mark have
ensued in recent times. Of late, in _La Mer Technology Inc v Office for
Harmonisation in the Internal Market_ [2008] ETMR 9 (“ _La Mer Technology
(2008)_ ”), the European Court of First Instance dealt with an appeal against
a decision to uphold the opposition by the proprietor of the “Laboratoire de
La Mer” mark to La Mer Technology Inc’s application to register the term “La
Mer” as a trade mark. One of the issues raised on appeal was whether there had
been genuine use of the “Laboratoire de La Mer” mark. The court reiterated
(_id_ at [55]) what the ECJ had stated in _Ansul_ ([38] _supra_) at [43],
_viz_ , that in assessing whether use of a trade mark was genuine, regard
should be given to all the relevant facts and circumstances, including (but
not limited to) whether such use was necessary in the economic sector
concerned to maintain or create a market share in relation to the goods or
services protected by the mark in question, the nature of those goods or
services, the characteristics of the market and the frequency of the use of
the mark. The court elaborated (at [56] of _La Mer Technology (2008)_):

As to the extent of the use to which the … trade mark has been put, account
must be taken, in particular, of the commercial volume of the overall use, as
well as of the length of the period during which the mark was used and the
frequency of use …

The court then proceeded to expand on how an examination of whether a trade
mark had been put to genuine use should be carried out. It stated (_id_ at
[57]):

To examine whether … [a] trade mark has been put to genuine use, an overall
assessment must be carried out, which takes into account all the relevant
factors of the particular case. That assessment entails a degree of
interdependence between the factors taken into account. Thus, the fact that
[the] commercial volume achieved under the mark was not high may be offset by
the fact that use of the mark was extensive or very regular, and vice versa.
In addition, the turnover and the volume of sales of the product under the …
trade mark cannot be assessed in absolute terms but must be looked at in
relation to other relevant factors, such as the volume of business, [the]
production or marketing capacity or the degree of diversification of the
undertaking using the trade mark and the characteristics of the products or
services on the relevant market.

42  The European Court of First Instance also reiterated in _La Mer Technology
(2008)_ that there was no rule that _de minimis_ use could not constitute
genuine use, opining as follows (_id_ at [57]–[58]):

57 … [U]se of the … mark need not always be quantitatively significant in
order to be deemed genuine. Even minimal usecan therefore be sufficient to be
deemed genuine, provided that it is viewed as warranted in the economic sector
concerned to maintain or create a share in the market for the goods or
services protected by the mark …

58 The [ECJ] also added, in [72] of _Sunrider v OHIM_ [2004] E.C.R. II–2811
that it is not possible to determine a priori and in the abstract what
quantitative threshold should be chosen in order to determine whether use is
genuine or not. A de minimis rule, which would not allow OHIM [_ie_ , the
Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)]or,
on appeal, the [European] Court of First Instance, to appraise all the
circumstances of the dispute before it, cannot therefore be laid down. Thus,
the [ECJ] has held that, when it serves a real commercial purpose, even
minimal use can be sufficient to establish genuine use.

43 To summarise, what these authorities show is that for the purposes of
determining whether use of a trade mark is genuine, while there is no rule
barring _de minimis_ use from being regarded as genuine use, no one single
objective formula which applies to all situations can be laid down; much would
depend on the _fact situation_ in each individual case.

(2) Whether there was genuine use of the Opposed Mark during the Relevant
Period

44 Pursuant to s 105 of the current TMA (see [33]–[34] above), it is incumbent
on the First Defendant to show that there was genuine use of the Opposed Mark
during the Relevant Period. In _La Mer Technology (2008)_ ([41] _supra_), the
European Court of First Instance stated, based on its past decisions, that
“genuine use of a trade mark [could not] be proved by means of probabilities
or suppositions” (at [59]), but must instead be “demonstrated by _solid and
objective evidence_ of effective and sufficient use of the trade mark on the
market concerned” [emphasis added] (_ibid_).

45  In the present case, there is clear _objective_ evidence that, during the
Relevant Period, the Second Defendant’s related company, Yu Ceng, sold
cordyceps bearing the Opposed Mark. Yu Ceng, it will be recalled, was the
exclusive licensee of the Opposed Mark in Singapore before it novated its
licence to the Second Defendant (see [8] above). Mr Leow Lay Leng (“Leow”), a
director of Yu Ceng, stated in his affidavit filed on 5 April 2007:[note: 8]

24 After its appointment as [the] authorised distributor of Rooster brand
cordyceps [_ie_ , cordyceps bearing the Opposed Mark] in Singapore, Yu Ceng
made sales in Singapore of cordyceps under the [Opposed] Mark amounting to at
least S$114,132.73 (including GST) during the period February to August 2006.
Annexed hereto and collectively marked “LLL-7” are invoices issued by Yu Ceng
to retailers in Singapore for the sales of Rooster brand cordyceps together
with translations thereof, as well as a table summarising these invoices.

25 I should note that these invoices do not represent **_all_** of Yu Ceng’s
sales of Rooster brand cordyceps, as there were also numerous cash sales for
smaller amounts. The invoices for these sales have not been exhibited in my
Affidavit because they are extremely voluminous, but I will produce them to
the Court if requested to do so.

[emphasis in bold italics in original]

46 The invoices mentioned by Leow recorded numerous sales of “Rooster Brand
Cordyceps”.[note: 9] The invoices show that the Plaintiff’s submission – _viz_
, that “the documents relied upon by the [First Defendant and the Second
Defendant] as indicating use … [did] not support their claim that there was
relevant use of the [Opposed Mark]”[note: 10] and that the said documents “all
mention[ed] ‘cordyceps’ only, except for one which relate[d] to an undated
sale to Poo Hong who … [did] not regard the Rooster mark as a trade
mark”[note: 11] – is clearly incorrect.

47 In _Warman_ ([37] _supra_), the evidence of the use of the “Warman” mark by
the defendant (the registered proprietor of that trade mark) consisted of
“three sales transactions, three e-mail enquiries from Singapore companies to
the defendant regarding ‘Warman’ pump parts, as well as a fax sent by the
defendant to a potential customer for pump parts” (at [101]). Rajah JA was of
the opinion that this evidence was sufficient to establish genuine use of the
“Warman” mark for the purposes of s 22(1) of the current TMA, stating
(_ibid_):

On the basis of what appears to be the settled view of the elements of
“genuine use”, I am of the view that the adduced evidence of use, in
particular, the three sales transactions made by the defendant in relation to
pump parts, is indeed just barely sufficient to constitute “genuine use” for
the purposes of s 22(1) of the [current TMA].

In comparison, the evidence adduced in the present case shows numerous sales
of cordyceps bearing the Opposed Mark. The evidence as to the use of the
Opposed Mark is certainly much more substantial and cogent than the evidence
of the use of the “Warman” mark in _Warman_.

48 Further, and in this regard, we would like to refer to the following
pertinent observation of this court in _Nike International Ltd v Campomar_
_SL_ [2006] 1 SLR 919 (“ _Nike International_ ”) at [15]:

The essential standard of proof required to defeat a revocation application is
to show a genuine use of the mark during the relevant five-year period. _One
single use of the mark could satisfy the test_ _provided that overwhelmingly
convincing proof of the act is adduced_. [emphasis added]

49 In _Nike International_ , the purported use of the trade mark consisted of
a single sale under which products bearing the mark had been shipped to
Singapore. This transaction was rejected as evidence of genuine use of the
mark because “ _not a single piece of evidence_ _from Singapore was produced_
” [emphasis added] (at [19]). Notably, the registered proprietor of the trade
mark did not adduce any evidence of receipt of payment for the goods; nor did
it adduce any documents in relation to the goods’ arrival in Singapore. In
contrast, in the present case, the sales of cordyceps bearing the Opposed Mark
were amply evidenced by documents, with numerous invoices adduced by the First
Defendant showing, _inter alia_ , the purchase orders as well as the shipping
and documentation instructions received, the different locations in Singapore
to which the cordyceps were to be delivered and different billing addresses in
Singapore. These documents constitute clear proof that there were genuine
sales of cordyceps bearing the Opposed Mark during the Relevant Period. Those
sales were _bona fide_ transactions, and not merely transactions concocted
just to preserve the validity of the registration of the Opposed Mark.
Therefore, in our view, there was overwhelming proof of genuine use of the
Opposed Mark by the First Defendant and the Second Defendant.

50 Accordingly, there is no basis whatsoever to revoke the registration of the
Opposed Mark for either lack of genuine use during the Relevant Period (see s
22(1)(_a_) of the current TMA) or non-use for “an uninterrupted period of 5
years … [with] no proper reasons for non-use” (_per_ s 22(1)(_b_)). Thus, in
our view, these two grounds for revocation must fail.

_Section 22(1)(_ c _): The impugned trade mark has become a common name in the
trade due to the registered proprietor’s acts or inactivity_

51 The next ground for revocation advanced by the Plaintiff, which is based on
s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA, is that the Opposed Mark has become a common
name in the trade for cordyceps imported from the PRC as a consequence of the
acts or the inactivity of the First Defendant or its predecessor in title. In
determining whether s 22(1)(_c_) has been made out in the present case, two
main issues have to be considered, namely (and paraphrasing the test set out
by Richard Arnold QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court, in
_Hormel Foods Corp v Antilles Landscape Investments NV_ [2005] RPC 28 (“
_Hormel_ ”) at [163]):

(a) has the Opposed Mark become a common name in the trade for cordyceps
imported from the PRC; and

(b) if (a) is answered in the affirmative, did the Opposed Mark become a
common name in the trade due to the First Defendant’s acts or inactivity?

(1) The requirement that the impugned trade mark has become a “common name in
the trade”

52 David Kitchin _et al_ , _Kerly’s_ _Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names_
(Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2005) (“ _Kerly’s_ ”) describes the question of
whether a trade mark has become a common name in the trade for a product or
service as “a question of fact to be decided in the circumstances” (at para
10-103). The actual _concept_ of “common name in the trade” in trade mark law
is, however, somewhat ambiguous. A trade mark which is considered to have
become a common name in the trade is said to have become – using the term of
art – “generic”. Ng-Loy Wee Loon, in _Law of Intellectual Property in
Singapore_ (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2008) (“Ng-Loy’s _Intellectual Property_ ”),
observes (at para 25.4.1) that the ground for revocation set out in s
22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA “deals with what may be called ‘genericisation’
– where the trade mark becomes the generic term for the product or services
[for which the mark is registered]”. Thus far, there have been few judicial
pronouncements on what the concept of “common name in the trade” entails. As
noted in Christopher Morcom, Ashley Roughton & Simon Malynicz, _The Modern Law
of Trade Marks_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2008) (“Morcom _et al_ ”) at para 7.35,
“there is very little guidance in decisions of the [the English trade marks]
registry or the courts in the application of this provision [_ie_ , the
English equivalent of s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA]”.

53 Some guidance is nevertheless forthcoming from academic works. David I
Bainbridge, _Intellectual Property_ (Pearson Longman, 6th Ed, 2007)
(“Bainbridge’s _Intellectual Property_ ”), for example, describes a trade mark
which has become a common name in the trade as one which is “so well known
that _[it_ _passes] into the language as being the name by which a type of
product is referred to rather than the name by which the product of a
particular undertaking is sold_ ” [emphasis added] (at p 652). Another leading
work, William Cornish & David Llewelyn, _Intellectual Property: Patents,
Copyright, Trade Marks and Allied Rights_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007)
(“Cornish & Llewelyn”), describes a trade mark which has become a common name
in the trade as one which “[has come] to be used as a description of the
product itself” (at para 18-74).

54 In a similar vein, the Plaintiff’s lead counsel, Mr Tan Tee Jim SC (“Mr
Tan”), in _Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore_ (Sweet & Maxwell
Asia, 2nd Ed, 2005) (“Tan’s _Law of Trade Marks_ ”), describes a trade mark
which has become a common name in the trade as one which has “lost the ability
to act as a badge of origin” (at para 7.62). He adds that (_ibid_):

The word ‘common’ suggests that the use of the name must be established or
widespread in the trade for the relevant goods or services. Precisely how
established or widespread the use [must be] in a particular case will depend
on the circumstances of the case.

An example of a mark which has become a common name in the trade would be the
mark “gramophone”. In _In re_ _Gramophone Company’s Application_ [1910] 2 Ch
423, the English High Court stated (at 431):

On the one hand, distinguishing the public from the trade, it is, in my
opinion, clear that to the general public the word “gramophone” now denotes a
talking machine with disc[s] as opposed to cylindrical records, that is, a
particular type of talking machine, and denotes this without any connotation
of the source of manufacture. In this sense the word has found its way into
dictionaries, is used in patent specifications, newspapers, and other current
literature, and can be found even in arguments of counsel and the decisions of
judges of the [English] High Court.

55 Tan’s _Law of Trade Marks_ further emphasises that “it is the _name_ that
must have become common … [and] [i]t must have become common for the goods or
services for which it is _registered_ ” [emphasis in original] (at para 7.63).
The name must also have become common due to the acts or the inactivity of the
proprietor. Thus (_ibid_):

This … overcomes the problem encountered by proprietors under the [Trade Marks
Ordinance 1938 (SS Ord No 38 of 1938)] whereby they could lose their
registration through the use of their mark[s] by third parties on goods or
services other than those covered by the registration and in a way that [they]
could not control.

56 Section 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA specifies that the trade mark in
question must have become common “in the trade”, which expression includes
_consumers_ and _end-users_ of the product or service for which the trade mark
is registered. In _Björnekulla Fruktindustrier AB v Procordia Food AB_ [2004]
RPC 45 (“ _Procordia Food_ ”), which involved a provision similar to s
22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA (_viz_ , Art 12(2)(a) of the European Trade
Marks Directive), the party applying for revocation (“the claimant”) contended
that the word “Bostongurka” had become the common name for chopped pickled
gherkins. In support of its application, the claimant relied primarily on “two
market research surveys of consumers” (_id_ at [7]). The proprietor of the
“Bostongurka” trade mark (“the defendant”) resisted the application for
revocation, citing in particular “a market research survey of leading
operators in the grocery, mass catering and food stall sectors” (_id_ at [8]).
The Swedish court was uncertain as to the class of persons to be considered
for the purposes of the expression “in the trade” and submitted to the ECJ for
a preliminary ruling the question of “the relevant circle or circles for
determining whether a trade mark has become the common name in the trade for a
product in respect of which it is registered” (_id_ at [11]). The ECJ found
that while the English and the Finnish versions of the term “in the trade”
referred to “trade circles alone” (_id_ at [17]), the corresponding terms in
the languages of other countries (such as Spain, Denmark, France and Italy)
were not restricted in such a manner, but instead referred “both to consumers
and end users as well as to the operators who distribute[d] the product”
(_ibid_). Emphasising the essential function of a trade mark (_viz_ , “to
guarantee the identity of the origin of the marked goods or service to the
consumer or end user by enabling him, without any possibility of confusion, to
distinguish the goods or service from others which have another origin” (see
_Procordia Food_ at [20])), the ECJ opined that, in general, the more
significant circles would be “consumers or end users” (_id_ at [24]). The
court added that, depending on the features of the product market concerned,
consideration should also be given to the perception of intermediaries who
could influence decisions to purchase the product concerned (_id_ at [25]).

57 For the condition in s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA to be satisfied, it
suffices (notwithstanding the literal wording of the provision) if the trade
mark in question has become _a_ common name in the trade; it _does not_ have
to be _the only_ common name in the trade. This very issue arose in _Hormel_
([51] _supra_), where one important question was whether s 46(1)(c) of the
English Trade Marks Act (which is _in pari materia_ with s 22(1)(_c_) of the
current TMA) required the impugned trade mark to have become _the only_ common
name in the trade or whether it was sufficient that the trade mark had become
merely _a_ common name in the trade. The English High Court held (at [167]):

The literal wording of s. 46(1)(c) [of the English Trade Marks Act], Art.
12(2)(a) [of the European Trade Marks Directive] and Art. 50(1)(b) [of Council
Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community Trade Mark]
suggests that what must be shown is that the trade mark has become _the_
common name and not merely _a_ common name. It is well-established, however,
that European legislation is to be interpreted teleologically rather than
necessarily in accordance with its literal wording. In my judgment, the
purpose of these provisions, which is to enable marks to be removed from the
register if they cease to fulfil their essential function of enabling
consumers to distinguish the goods or services of one undertaking from those
of others, would be defeated if the provisions were interpreted in this way.
**_If a trade mark has become a common name for goods or services for which it
is registered, then it can no longer perform this essential function even if
there are also other common names for those goods or services._** [emphasis
added in bold italics]

_Hormel_ thus indicates, _vis-à-vis_ s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA, that it
is sufficient if the trade mark in question has become _a_ common name in the
trade. The court in _Hormel_ added that it would not make any difference if
the trade mark concerned “[was] not the word [which had been registered as a
trade mark] … _per se_ but a stylised presentation of it” (at [168]).

(2) Whether the Opposed Mark has become a common name in the cordyceps trade

58 The Plaintiff has the onus of showing that the Opposed Mark has become a
“common name in the trade” (_per_ s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA).
Specifically, the Plaintiff has to show that the word “Rooster” has become
common in the cordyceps trade (_viz_ , it has become common to, _inter alia_ ,
_consumers_ and _end-users_ of cordyceps (see [56] above)) in the following
manner:[note: 12]

It [has become] … _a name commonly used to denote a particular type, kind or
characteristic of goods (namely, cordyceps from [the PRC])_ or is descriptive
of the said type, kind or characteristic. It has also become the _common name
in the cordyceps trade [for denoting] cordyceps from [the PRC]_. Further or
alternatively, it has become _a customary name in the current language or
practices of cordyceps traders in Singapore [for denoting] … cordyceps from
[the PRC]_. [emphasis added]

59 The burden of proof which the Plaintiff must satisfy in this regard can be
described as a heavy burden. As Warren J stated in _Rousselon Freres ET CIE v
Horwood Homewares Limited_ [2008] RPC 30 at [85], “[i]nsofar as it is
suggested that [the impugned trade mark] has become a common name in the
trade, that must be established by _cogent_ evidence” [emphasis added]. It has
likewise been observed in _Kerly’s_ ([52] _supra_) that “[a] tribunal would
expect to see substantial independent evidence relating to the relevant
product or service market” (at para 10-103).

60 Indeed, in general, it would appear that, as far as possible, _objective_
evidence should be adduced to establish that s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA
has been satisfied. That this is the correct principle to apply can be
perceived from the following cases which deal with the issue of whether the
registration of a trade mark should be _invalidated_ on the ground that the
trade mark has become _customary_ in the current language or in the _bona
fide_ and established practices of the trade (see s 23(1) read with s
7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA; see also the European equivalent of these
provisions, _ie_ , Art 51(1)(a) read with Art 7(1)(d) of Council Regulation
(EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community Trade Mark (“EC Council
Regulation 40/94”)). Some general guidance can be drawn from these cases as
there is some conceptual overlap between, on the one hand, _revoking_ the
registration of a trade mark on the ground that the trade mark has become a
_common name in the trade_ for the product or service for which it is
registered and, on the other hand, _invalidating_ the registration of a trade
mark on the basis that the trade mark has become _customary_ in the current
language or in the _bona fide_ and established practices of the trade. This is
in some ways reflected by the fact that, as will be discussed later (at
[71]–[76] below), a trade mark which has become “customary” within the meaning
of s 7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA can, like a trade mark which has become a
“common name in the trade” (_per_ s 22(1)(_c_)), be described as a “generic”
mark.

61 In _Sunonwealth Electric Machine Industry Co Ltd v Siemens
Aktiengesellschaft_ [2007] SGIPOS 3 (“ _Sunonwealth_ ”), an application was
made to register a mark comprising the word “Maglev” for, among other
products, motors for electric machines and motors for cooling fans. The
application was opposed on, _inter alia_ , the ground that the mark had become
customary in the manner delineated in s 7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA. The
Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks upheld the opposition and refused the
application for registration, holding that the word “Maglev” had become
customary within the meaning of s 7(1)(_d_) for the following reasons (at
[4]):

The term maglev is found in the dictionary as a noun referring to a type of
technology, namely magnetic levitation technology. The literature filed by the
[party opposing the application for registration] relating to the use of …
magnetic levitation technology in various products … refers to maglev products
as products employing maglev technology. Therefore, the word maglev has become
customary in the current language and in the established practices of the
trade as designating the type of products which use that technology.

For similar reasons, it was held in _Alcon Inc v Office for Harmonisation in
the Internal Market_ [2004] ETMR 6 (“ _Alcon_ ”) that the acronym “BSS”, which
had been registered as a trade mark for ophthalmic pharmaceutical preparations
and sterile solutions for ophthalmic surgery, was not a valid trade mark as it
had become customary within the meaning of Art 7(1)(d) of EC Council
Regulation 40/94 (_ie_ , the European equivalent of s 7(1)(_d_) of the current
TMA). The European Court of First Instance explained (at [43]):

The evidence submitted by the intervener [_ie_ , the party who sought to have
the “BSS” mark invalidated] … as to the customary character of the acronym BSS
among ophthalmologic specialists indicates that BSS has become the current
generic term for a balanced salt solution. The Court finds that the chemical,
medical and pharmaceutical dictionaries and the scientific articles produced
by the intervener demonstrate that the term BSS is regarded by the relevant
scientific community as a generic term.

62 In our opinion, on the available evidence, the Plaintiff has not discharged
its burden of showing that the Opposed Mark has become a common name in the
cordyceps trade. The Plaintiff has not shown that the word “Rooster” has
become commonly used for denoting cordyceps from the PRC, whether or not such
cordyceps bear the Rooster Sign. Indeed, there was hardly any cogent evidence
to support such a finding. Here, we would quote the testimony of Mr Tan Peng
Seng, a managing director of a Chinese medicinal business and a witness for
the Plaintiff, who, during cross-examination by counsel for the First
Defendant (“Mr Ravindran”), indicated that it would not be possible to refer
to other brands of cordyceps from the PRC as “Rooster” cordyceps:[note: 13]

Q. |  … You say that you have heard of G-Lion cordyceps in Singapore?  
---|---  
A. |  Yes, yes.  
Q. |  Do these G-Lion cordyceps come from [the PRC]?  
A. |  Yes.  
Q. |  Would you refer to G-Lion cordyceps as xiong ji pai [_ie_ , “Rooster” cordyceps]?  
A. |  No.  
Q. |  Similarly you have heard of Xin Sheng cordyceps and Twin Chicken cordyceps, correct?  
A. |  Yes.  
Q. |  And you would not refer to these cordyceps as xiong ji pai as well, correct?  
A. |  They are cordyceps but they do not bear the Rooster Brand.  
  
63 Similar sentiments were expressed by another witness for the Plaintiff, Mr
Ng Sui Teck, who is likewise a managing director of a Chinese medicinal
business, when he was cross-examined by Mr Ravindran as follows:[note: 14]

[Q.] |  The Twin Chicken cordyceps, would you term them as xiong ji pai? The Rooster Brand – would you consider Twin Chicken Brand, Rooster Brand cordyceps?  
---|---  
… |   
A. |  Twin Chicken is Twin Chicken.  
  
64 Indeed, there was no clear evidence to show that the word “Rooster” was
even linked to cordyceps _in general_ (as opposed to cordyceps from the PRC
specifically), as can be seen from the following exchange between the Judge
and Mr Tan Hee Nam (“Tan”), the managing director of the Plaintiff:[note: 15]

COURT: |  Just let me ask you this in the converse, if I were to go to Chinatown after this case and I go into any of those many suppliers and I say, “I want Rooster” would they know what I want? …  
---|---  
A. |  If you were to go into those medical halls selling Chinese medical herbs and you said that you wanted to buy Rooster mark cordyceps then they would know that you wanted to buy that.  
COURT: |  But your answer does not tally with my question. If somebody goes to a medical hall and says, “I want Rooster”, would the operators of the hall be able to identify what it is that I want? Do you understand my question? It is quite a simple question because it is easy to test the connection between the Rooster [_ie_ , the word “Rooster”] and cordyceps, in fact [the test] is exactly this, so if I go into a shop and I say, “Give me $50, or $100 Rooster” do they know what I want?  
A. |  They will connect it with Rooster Brand and if – the word “xiong ji chong cao” is mentioned, so it must be cordyceps –  
… |   
COURT: |  But that is sidestepping the question, if I say “Rooster _Cordyceps_ ”, of course they know I want cordyceps. If that was the case I wouldn’t even ask my question. … If we go to your shop – not your shop, any other shop in Chinatown, there must be what 20 shops that supply these things and somebody goes in and says, “$100 worth of Rooster, please”, would they know what it is that the customer wants?  
A. |  No.  
… |   
A. |  _If only the word “Rooster” is mentioned then I’m afraid they won’t know._  
  
[emphasis added]

65 From the above, it can be seen that the word “Rooster” would at most refer
to cordyceps bearing the Rooster Sign and not to cordyceps from the PRC
generically. But, in order to show that the word “Rooster” has become a
“common name in the trade” within the meaning of s 22(1)(_c_) of the current
TMA, the Plaintiff must show that the word “Rooster” would also refer to
cordyceps from the PRC which _do not bear the Rooster Sign_ (_cf_ the word
“gramophone”, which was considered to be generic in _In_ _re Gramophone
Company’s Application_ ([54] _supra_), and the word “linoleum”, which was
considered to be generic in _Linoleum Manufacturing Company v Nairn_ (1877–78)
7 Ch D 834). As the First Defendant rightly argued in its submissions before
this court, the practice of describing cordyceps from the PRC which are marked
with the Rooster Sign as “Rooster cordyceps” does not make the word “Rooster”
a common name of the product. Yet, this is precisely the requirement which the
Plaintiff must satisfy for the purposes of s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA –
_ie_ , the Plaintiff must show that the word “Rooster” has become a common
name for cordyceps from the PRC. That this is the requirement which must be
satisfied appears to have been admitted by Tan, who stated in his affidavit
filed on 1 November 2006:[note: 16]

[“Rooster”] is ... a name _commonly used_ to denote a particular type, kind or
characteristic of goods (namely, cordyceps _from [the PRC]_) or is descriptive
of the said type, kind or characteristic. It has also become the common name
in the cordyceps trade [for denoting] cordyceps _from [the PRC]_. [emphasis
added]

This, the Plaintiff could not do (see [62]–[63] above). We would add that,
unlike _Sunonwealth_ ([61] _supra_) and _Alcon_ ([61] _supra_), there is a
_lack_ of _objective evidence_ in the present case to show that the word
“Rooster” has indeed become a common name in the trade for cordyceps from the
PRC. The only evidence before the court that indicates thus would be the bare
assertions of Tan (see the passage reproduced in the preceding paragraph) and
a number of other witnesses. This is hardly sufficient to discharge the
Plaintiff’s burden of proof. Indeed, there is undisputed evidence that
cordyceps from the PRC are sold (and are also known) in Singapore under
numerous marks or brands, _eg_ , “Turkey”, “Rabbit”, “Golden Deer”, “Long Ma”,
“Twin Chicken”, “Royal King”, “G-Lion”, “Xin Sheng”, _etc_. Thus, we hold that
the Plaintiff has failed to establish that the Rooster Sign (_ie_ , the word
“Rooster”) has become a common name in the trade for denoting cordyceps from
the PRC and there is accordingly no basis to revoke the registration of the
Opposed Mark on this ground.

66 For completeness, we would add that it would be _insufficient_ for the
Plaintiff to simply show that the Rooster Mark is a _popular_ mark used to
denote cordyceps from the PRC. The mere fact that a mark is popular or even
the only brand used to market a particular product or service does not _ipso
facto_ render that mark a generic name and thus undeserving of protection. In
_Hormel_ ([51] _supra_), it was held that a mark which had become a household
name was not necessarily a mark which had become generic. In response to the
argument that the registration of the trade mark “Spam” should be revoked as
that word had become the common name in the trade for the purposes of s
46(1)(c) of the English Trade Marks Act (_viz_ , the English equivalent of s
22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA), the English High Court stated (at [176]):

[S]ince 1938 the [mark “Spam”] has become a household name. In such
circumstances it is not surprising that occasionally it is used by way of
synecdoche to stand for canned luncheon meat generally in the same way as, for
example, PERRIER is sometimes used to stand for carbonated mineral water
generally (the synecdoche being the use of the species to stand for the
genus). This does not mean that [the mark] has necessarily become truly
generic, still less that this is due to the acts or [the] inactivity of the
[registered proprietor of the mark].

Other examples of trade marks which have become household names would include
marks such as “Xerox”, “Kleenex” and “Kiwi”, all of which remain registered as
trade marks despite the fact that they are commonly used in the generic sense
to refer to photocopiers, tissue paper and shoe polish respectively.

67 In view of our conclusion at [62]–[65] above on the issue of whether the
word “Rooster” has become a “common name in the trade” within the meaning of s
22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA, it is wholly unnecessary for us to consider the
second issue relating to this provision, namely, whether, if the word
“Rooster” has indeed become a common name for cordyceps from the PRC, this
development was brought about by the “acts or inactivity” (_per_ s 22(1)(_c_))
of the First Defendant (see [51] above).

_Our decision on revocation_

68 For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the registration of the Opposed
Mark should not be revoked. None of the grounds for revocation set out in ss
22(1)(_a_), 22(1)(_b_) and 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA have been made out.
As we earlier held, the available evidence indicates that the Opposed Mark was
put to genuine use in the course of trade during the Relevant Period (see
[45]–[49] above) and the word “Rooster” has not become a common name in the
cordyceps trade for referring to cordyceps from the PRC (see [62]–[65] above).

**_Invalidation of the registration of the Opposed Mark_**

69 The Plaintiff’s case for invalidating the registration of the Opposed Mark
was, as mentioned earlier (see [20]–[23] above), presented under four heads in
the court below, namely:

(a) it had become customary to use the Rooster Sign (which forms the essence
of the Opposed Mark) to denote cordyceps from the PRC (see s 7(1)(_d_) of the
current TMA);

(b) at the time of Qinghai Meheco’s application to register the Rooster Sign
as a trade mark in Singapore, that sign was not capable of distinguishing
Qinghai Meheco’s cordyceps from the cordyceps of other suppliers and thus did
not satisfy the definition of a trade mark (see s 7(1)(_a_) of the current
TMA);

(c) Qinghai Meheco’s application to register the Rooster Sign as a trade mark
in Singapore had been made in bad faith (see s 7(6) of the current TMA); and

(d) the First Defendant had obtained the registration of the Opposed Mark in
its name in 2005 (jointly with Qinghai Yixin) and 2006 (in its sole name)
through fraud and/or misrepresentation to the Registrar of Trade Marks (see s
23(4) of the current TMA).

Before the Judge, the Plaintiff succeeded in establishing the second head
(_viz_ , that the Rooster Sign had been registered as a trade mark in
Singapore in breach of s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA (see sub-para (f) of
[26] above)). Nevertheless, the Judge ultimately decided that the registration
should not be invalidated despite the breach of s 7(1)(_a_) (see sub-paras
(g)–(j) of [26] above).

_Section 7(1)(_ d _): The impugned trade mark is a sign which has become
customary in the trade_

70 With regard to s 7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA, the Plaintiff’s argument is
that, at the date of the application by Qinghai Meheco (the First Defendant’s
predecessor in title and the original registrant of the Opposed Mark) to
register the Rooster Sign as a trade mark in Singapore, it was customary in
the cordyceps trade to use the Rooster Sign to denote cordyceps from the PRC.
Accordingly, the registration of the Opposed Mark should be invalidated under
s 23(1), which provides for invalidation of the registration of (_inter alia_)
trade marks “which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have
become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established
practices of the trade” (_per_ s 7(1)(_d_)).

(1) The requirement of customariness

71 There is little authority on what the phrase “customary in the current
language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade” in s
7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA means. Indeed, as the Judge observed, there are
no _binding_ authorities, although there are good _persuasive_ authorities
(see [27] of the Judgment).

72 In _Hormel_ ([51] _supra_), the English High Court, in construing s 3(1)(d)
of the English Trade Marks Act (which is similar to s 7(1)(_d_) of the current
TMA), held that the essence of the objection embodied in the provision was as
follows (at [155]):

Section 3(1)(d) implements Art. 3(1)(d) of the [European Trade Marks]
Directive and corresponds to Art. 7(1)(d) of [EC Council Regulation 40/94].
Article 3(1)(d) was considered by the [ECJ] in Case C-S 17/99 _Merz & Krell
GmbH & Co v Deutsches Patent-und Markenamt_ [2001] E.C.R. 1-6959. The Court
held that [Art 3(1)(d)] was to be interpreted as only precluding registration
of a mark where the signs or indications of which the mark was exclusively
composed had become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and
established practices of the trade [for designating] the goods or services in
respect of which registration of the mark was sought. It also held that it was
immaterial for this purpose whether or not the sign in question was
descriptive. Thus _the essence of the objection is that the sign is generic
either amongst the general public or amongst the trade_. [emphasis added]

73 Similarly, in _Alcon Inc v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market_
[2005] ETMR 69, the ECJ stated (at [29]) that the principle underlying Art
7(1)(d) of EC Council Regulation 40/94 (which is _in pari materia_ with s
7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA) was that:

[S]igns or indications constituting a trade mark which have become customary
in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the
trade [for designating] the goods or services covered by that mark _are not
capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those
of other undertakings and do not therefore fulfil the essential function of a
trade mark_ – unless the use which has been made of those signs or indications
has enabled them to acquire a distinctive character … [emphasis added]

74 Likewise, Lionel Bently & Brad Sherman, _Intellectual Property Law_ (Oxford
University Press, 2nd Ed, 2004) (“Bently & Sherman”) comments on s 3(1)(d) of
the English Trade Marks Act as follows (at p 833):

While the scope of the section has yet to be fully explored, it seems that it
will cover so-called ‘generic’ marks. A mark, particularly a name mark, is
generic if though when it was first adopted it was distinctive, over time it
has come to designate a genus or type of product rather than a particular
product originating from a particular source. … _One of the features of a
generic mark is that it is no longer capable of distinguishing the goods or
services of different traders._ Where a word comes to describe a class of
products, it can no longer be relied upon to separate the products in the
class from each other.

75 In _Merz & Krell GmbH & Co_ [2002] ETMR 21 (“ _Merz & Krell_”), the
applicant’s application to register the word “Bravo” in respect of writing
implements was rejected by the German Patent and Trade Mark Office on the
ground that “the word BRAVO [was], for the class of persons to whom it [was]
addressed … no more than a word of praise and an advertising slogan devoid of
any distinctive character” (at [10]). The issue before the ECJ was whether Art
3(1)(d) of the European Trade Marks Directive (which is similar to s 7(1)(_d_)
of the current TMA) was to be interpreted restrictively such that “only signs
or indications which directly describe[d] the specific goods or services in
respect of which registration [was] sought, or the essential characteristics
or features thereof, [were] affected by the bar to registration” (see _Merz &
Krell_ at [16]). The court opined that Art 3(1)(d) was concerned with
prohibiting registration on the sole condition that the mark had become
customary and it was _immaterial_ whether the mark was descriptive of the
characteristics of the goods or services in question, stating (at [26] and
[28]–[29]):

26 Under Article 3(1)(d) of the [European Trade Marks] Directive, trade marks
which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have become customary
in the current language or [in] trade practices are to be refused
registration.

…

28 _The purpose of Article 3(1)(d) of the [European Trade Marks] Directive is
to prevent the registration of signs or indications that are not capable of
distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other
undertakings and so do not satisfy the criterion laid down in Article 2 of the
Directive_ [_viz_ , the European equivalent of the definition of “trade mark”
in s 2(1) of the current TMA].

29 The question [of] whether particular signs or indications possess
distinctive character cannot, however, be considered in the abstract and
separately from the goods or services [which] those signs or indications are
intended to distinguish.

[emphasis added]

76 Applying a similar approach to the interpretation of s 7(1)(_d_) of the
current TMA in the present case, the Rooster Sign, although not descriptive of
any characteristic of the subject goods (_ie_ , cordyceps), would have become
customary if it has become incapable of distinguishing the cordyceps of one
undertaking from those of other undertakings. We should at this juncture
emphasise that the concept of the capacity of a trade mark to distinguish the
goods or services which it covers (referred to hereafter as a trade mark’s
“capacity to distinguish”) as dealt with under this ground of invalidation
(_viz_ , s 7(1)(_d_)) should not be conflated with the concept of a trade
mark’s capacity to distinguish as dealt with under s 7(1)(_a_), which is
discussed later (see [84]–[99] below). As will be seen, the latter concept of
a trade mark’s capacity to distinguish (_ie_ , the concept embodied in s
7(1)(_a_)) does not take into consideration the use made of the trade mark in
question when determining whether that trade mark possesses the requisite
capacity to distinguish (see [97] below). In contrast, the former concept of a
trade mark’s capacity to distinguish (_ie_ , the concept embodied in s
7(1)(_d_)) allows the use made of the trade mark in question to be taken into
account for the purposes of determining whether that trade mark has become
customary (see, _eg_ , the decision of the English High Court in _West v
Fuller Smith & Turner Plc_ [2002] FSR 55). As stated in Morcom _et al_ ([52]
_supra_), s 3(1)(d) of the English Trade Marks Act (which is _in pari materia_
with s 7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA) “is intended to enable applications … for
signs _which have become generic_ _or [which] have come into general use in
the trade_ … to be refused” [emphasis added] (at para 5.81).

(2) Whether the Rooster Sign has become customary in the cordyceps trade

77 The Plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the Rooster Sign (which
forms the essence of the Opposed Mark) has become “customary in the current
language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade” (_per_ s
7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA) as referring to cordyceps from the PRC. This
burden, like the burden of proof _vis-à-vis_ s 22(1)(_c_) of the current TMA
(see [59] above), has been described as one which is _not easy to discharge_.
For example, _Kerly’s_ ([52] _supra_), in discussing s 3(1)(d) of the English
Trade Marks Act, Art 3(1)(d) of the European Trade Marks Directive and Art
7(1)(d) of EC Council Regulation 40/94 (all of which correspond to s 7(1)(_d_)
of the current TMA), states (at paras 8-101–8-102):

8-101 … These provisions are directed at preventing registration of those
signs or indications which honest traders customarily use in trade – signs
which are generic.

8-102 … The essence of the objection is that the sign is generic, with the
primary focus usually being on the perception of the mark amongst consumers,
although the perception in the trade may be important in certain
circumstances. Each case will turn on its own facts and evidence. _The
challenge with these grounds is to compile a sufficiently convincing body of
evidence_.

[emphasis added]

_Kerly’s_ further states (at para 8-113), in relation to Art 3(1)(d) of the
European Trade Marks Directive and Art 7(1)(d) of EC Council Regulation 40/94,
that these provisions:

… are in the public interest, to ensure that generic terms may be used freely
by all. … Alternatively, the public interest lies in the fact that marks
caught by these provisions are not capable of functioning as trade marks and
therefore do not deserve to be protected. Expressing the underlying public
interest in these terms serves to emphasise that** _these provisions set a
high hurdle_**. Not only must the mark consist _exclusively_ of generic
matter, but the fact of genericism must be established. Bearing in mind [that]
the primary role of [Art] 3(1)(d) [of the European Trade Marks Directive]/
[Art] 7(1)(d) [of EC Council Regulation 40/94] are [_sic_] to prevent traders
seeking to monopolise terms which are already generic, the fact of genericism
can usually be demonstrated. [emphasis added in bold italics]

78 The Plaintiff asserts that the Rooster Sign has become customarily used in
the cordyceps trade to denote cordyceps from the PRC. In support of this
contention, the Plaintiff tendered in the court below various invoices
describing cordyceps sold by other companies as “Rooster cordyceps” and
various documents showing the China Mark (_ie_ , the Rooster Sign as
registered as a trade mark in the PRC) on cordyceps sold by those companies.
Other evidence, however, indicates that such use of the China Mark was likely
to have been pursuant to licence agreements entered into by Qinghai Meheco
with other Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies (see [114] below). Indeed,
there is evidence that the China Chamber of Commerce played a role in
arranging for other Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies to enter into
licence agreements with Qinghai Meheco for the use of the China Mark (see
[114] below). Further, as Mr  Zhang Jianzhong (“Zhang”), the managing director
of the First Defendant, pointed out in his affidavit filed on 5 April 2007 in
response to the Plaintiff’s evidence, if the Rooster Sign had truly become
customary in the current language or in the _bona fide_ and established
practices of the cordyceps trade for denoting cordyceps from the PRC, there
would surely have been opposition to the registration of the Rooster Sign in
the PRC (as the China Mark), but no opposition has been raised since the
registration of the China Mark in 1985.[note: 17] In fact, according to Zhang,
many parties in the PRC have sought to register either “(i) variations of
chicken-themed logos for their cordyceps and other herbs; or (ii) completely
different marks for these goods altogether”.[note: 18] The First Defendant’s
case would also appear to be supported by the evidence of Mr Zhao Jian
(“Zhao”) and Mr Deng Zhong Xiang (“Deng”), who are former employees of Sichuan
Meheco and Chongqing Meheco respectively, both of whom denied during cross-
examination that their former employers had used the Rooster Sign in the
PRC.[note: 19]

79 That aside, there is further evidence in support of the First Defendant’s
case (_viz_ , that the Rooster Sign has not become customary in the cordyceps
trade as denoting cordyceps from the PRC). As mentioned earlier (see sub-para
(b) of [7] above), Qinghai Meheco’s application to register the Rooster Sign
as a trade mark in Singapore was opposed by Wing Thye Loong after it was
advertised. This caused the delay in the issuance of the certificate of
registration to Qinghai Meheco (the certificate was not issued until 27 August
2001, almost six years after the date of Qinghai Meheco’s application for
registration). The opposition by Wing Thye Loong was successfully resisted
(see _Wing Thye Loong_ ([7] _supra_)). It is pertinent that Wing Thye Loong
alleged – unsuccessfully – that there were other parties both within and
outside Singapore dealing in similar goods bearing the Rooster Sign. This
allegation was not substantiated and led the Assistant Registrar of Trade
Marks to doubt its veracity. The Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks eventually
held that “the evidence lodged [by Wing Thye Loong was] insufficient to show
that other traders [were] using similar rooster marks [_ie_ , the Rooster
Sign] on similar goods” (_id_ at [39]). What is even more significant is that
at the time when Qinghai Meheco applied to register the Rooster Sign as a
trade mark in Singapore, the Plaintiff supported the application in a letter
to Qinghai Meheco in the following terms:[note: 20]

Our company [_ie_ , the Plaintiff] … has been importing the “Rooster” brand of
Cordyceps Sinensis for around 40 years since the 1960s.

Around the early 1980s, when your company [_ie_ , Qinghai Meheco] … started to
have the direct export rights [_ie_ , direct rights to export cordyceps from
the PRC], our company and your company directly developed the “Rooster” brand
of Cordyceps Sinensis business and the related products of “Rooster” brand. …

Our company declare[s] that, since the 1980s till now, we have been the …
Singapore agent for [Qinghai Meheco’s] “Rooster” brand of Cordyceps Sinensis
and other related products of “Rooster” brand.

This letter shows that the Rooster Sign, far from being used in Singapore to
denote cordyceps from the PRC generically, was in fact used in respect of
cordyceps supplied by Qinghai Meheco specifically.

80  In the light of the foregoing, there is certainly no “sufficiently
convincing body of evidence” (see _Kerly’s_ ([52] _supra_) at para 8-102
(reproduced at [77] above)) for us to find that the Rooster Sign has become
customary in the current language or in the _bona fide_ and established
practices of the cordyceps trade for denoting cordyceps from the PRC. We thus
hold that the Plaintiff has failed to establish its case under s 23(1) read
with s 7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA.

81  The present case would appear to mirror that of _West v Fuller Smith &
Turner Plc_ ([76] _supra_), where there was likewise little evidence that the
impugned mark had become customary. The plaintiff in that case marketed a
pilsner beer known as “ESP”, which stood for “Eastenders Strong Pils”. He
applied for the revocation of the registration of the defendant’s “E.S.B.”
trade mark, which stood for “Extra Special Bitter”. Christopher Floyd QC
(sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court) held that the evidence
adduced by the plaintiff was insufficient to show that the initials “E.S.B.”
had become customary, stating (at [39]–[43]):

39 I turn to the question of whether the [defendant’s] mark had become
customary in the current language or established practices of the trade. Only
two brewers apart from [the defendant] had used the E.S.B. initials directly:
Mitchell’s and Jennings, although little is known about the latter. If this
were the only use which were relevant it would be clearly inadequate to
support the suggestion that the mark consisted of signs or indications which
were customary.

40 However, in the light of the evidence that Extra Special/Strong Bitter may
sometimes be shortened to E.S.B. it is relevant to consider the use by traders
of the terms Extra Special/Strong Bitter before 1988 [the year in which the
defendant’s mark was registered]. If these terms were customary, and were used
in such a way that they were likely to be abbreviated to E.S.B., then E.S.B.
itself would be a customary term. As [counsel for the plaintiff] pointed out,
even if the brewer is using Extra Special Bitter, his customers may order
E.S.B. If such a use had become customary, it would be wrong to maintain the
registration of the [defendant’s] mark.

41 Of the remaining brewers, Ann Street, Simpkiss and Blue Anchor were all
using Extra Special Bitter and Smiles was using Extra Strong Bitter. However
the evidence about these beers either indicates positively that it is unlikely
that the names were abbreviated to E.S.B., or is silent on the subject. In
these latter cases, in the absence of more evidence about the way the marks
were used, it would, in my judgment, be wrong to infer a likelihood that
abbreviation would take place.

42 Such specialist dictionaries and writings as were produced post-dated 1988,
and most had a North American origin or connection. They do not throw light on
the position in the United Kingdom in 1988.

43 In my judgment the claimant has failed to establish that the initials
E.S.B. were a sign or [an] indication customary in the current language or
established practices of the trade. There is nothing else in the evidence to
establish that the mark is otherwise devoid of distinctive character.

This decision was upheld by the English Court of Appeal on appeal (see _West v
Fuller Smith & Turner Plc_ [2003] FSR 44).

_Section 7(1)(_ a _): The impugned trade mark does not satisfy the definition
of a trade mark_

82 We now turn to the second head under which the Plaintiff claims the
registration of the Opposed Mark should be invalidated. This relates to s
23(1) read with s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA, which (taken together) allow
“signs which do not satisfy the definition of a trade mark in section 2(1)”
(_per_ s 7(1)(_a_)) to be invalidated. In this regard, the Plaintiff submits
that as a result of the extensive use of the Rooster Sign (which forms the
essence of the Opposed Mark) since the 1950s, that sign is not capable of
_distinguishing the cordyceps of one supplier from the cordyceps of other
suppliers_ and thus cannot be registered as a trade mark, which is defined in
s 2(1) of the current TMA as:

… any sign capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of
distinguishing goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade
by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other
person …

83 It should be pointed out at this juncture that the current TMA was not in
force when the Opposed Mark was registered. The application to register the
Rooster Sign as a trade mark in Singapore was made on 6 September 1995. Under
the transitional provisions in the Third Schedule of the current TMA (“the
Third Schedule”), “an application for registration of a mark … which is
pending on 15th January 1999” (see para 10(1) of the Third Schedule) is to be
dealt with under “the old law” (_ibid_), _ie_ , under the Trade Marks Act (Cap
332, 1992 Ed) (“the 1992 TMA”). (The 1992 TMA has since been repealed by s 109
of the Trade Marks Act 1998 (Act 46 of 1998) (“the 1998 TMA”).) Under the 1992
TMA, a trade mark was defined without reference to the capability of the sign
constituting the trade mark to distinguish the goods or services of one
supplier from those of other suppliers. Nevertheless, the Opposed Mark’s
capability (or lack thereof) to distinguish the cordyceps supplied by the
First Defendant from other suppliers’ cordyceps is relevant because para 17(2)
of the Third Schedule provides that for the purposes of proceedings under s 23
of the current TMA, the provisions of the current TMA (save for s 8(3)
thereof, which is immaterial in the Appeal) are deemed to have been in force
at all material times. By virtue of this deeming provision, the current
definition of a trade mark applies to the present application by the Plaintiff
to invalidate the registration of the Opposed Mark under s 23 read with s
7(1)(_a_).

(1) The requirement that a trade mark must have the requisite capacity to
distinguish

84 The cornerstone of a mark or sign which has been registered as a trade mark
is its capacity to distinguish (as defined at [76] above), _ie_ , its ability
to distinguish the goods or services of a particular supplier so as to serve
as a badge of trade origin to the average consumer who encounters the mark. As
stated in _Executrices of the Estate of Diana, Princess of Wales’ Application_
[2001] ETMR 25, “it is clear that the ability to distinguish the goods or
services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings remains the
essential function of a trade mark” (at [11]). It is for this reason that a
mark or sign has to have a certain level of distinctiveness before it can be
registered as a trade mark. According to the learned author of Ng-Loy’s
_Intellectual Property_ ([52] _supra_), there are three thresholds of
distinctiveness _vis-à-vis_ trade marks, as follows (at para 21.3.5):

The interplay between the three thresholds of distinctiveness is as follows.
The **_first threshold_** is found in the statutory definition of ‘trade mark’
itself: a sign must be _capable_ of distinguishing goods or services dealt
with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so
dealt with by any other person. A sign which fails to cross this capacity-to-
distinguish threshold is not a trade mark for the purposes of the Trade Marks
Act [_ie_ , the current TMA], and s 7(1)(a) prohibits its registration. The
**_second threshold_** is found in ss 7(1)(b)–(d) which prohibit the
registration of trade marks which are devoid of distinctive character, for
example, trade marks which are descriptive of the goods or services for which
registration is sought. Such trade marks are the ones which lack inherent
distinctiveness, and as indicated above, they are _prima facie_ not allowed
registration. If the applicant of an inherently non-distinctive trade mark
shows that it has crossed the **_third threshold_** of distinctiveness set out
in s 7(2), that is, the mark has acquired sufficient _de facto_
distinctiveness as a result of the applicant’s use … of the mark before the
date of the application, the mark will be accepted for registration. [emphasis
added in bold italics]

85 Similarly, the learned authors of Cornish & Llewelyn ([53] _supra_) also
recognise that the capacity to distinguish is a base threshold requirement
which must be satisfied before a mark or sign can be registered as a trade
mark. The learned authors state (at paras 18-17–18-18):

18-17 The inclusion of capacity to distinguish in the very definition of a
trade mark ties the system for the most part to its historic basis: that the
law’s purpose is to protect marks as, in a broad sense, indicators of origin.
…

18-18 … _Lack of capacity to distinguish_ – as an element in the initial
definition of what is to count as a trade mark at all – _must pertain to
objections even more fundamental (and therefore less likely to arise) than
“devoid of distinctiveness”_ [see s 3(1)(b) of the English Trade Marks Act,
which is _in pari materia_ with s 7(1)(_b_) of the current TMA; the latter
provision is not, however, in issue in the present appeal] … [emphasis added]

86 The approach taken by the courts towards this fundamental requirement that
a mark or sign must have the requisite capacity to distinguish in order to be
registered as a trade mark has not been exacting. The learned authors of
Morcom _et al_ ([52] _supra_), in discussing the phrase “capable of
distinguishing” in Art 2 of the European Trade Marks Directive (which
corresponds to the definition of “trade mark” in s 2(1) of the current TMA),
opine that that phrase should be interpreted broadly (_id_ at para 5.24):

The ECJ appears to have adopted a _fairly broad interpretation of ‘capable of
distinguishing’_ in art 2, so that the category of signs excluded, as being
‘incapable of distinguishing’, is very narrow. [emphasis added]

87 An example of this relaxed approach on the part of the courts can be found
in _AD2000 Trade Mark_ [1997] RPC 168. In that case, the English High Court
held that a mark is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one
undertaking from those of other undertakings even if it is capable of doing so
only in so far as it is not incapable of fulfilling this distinguishing role.
Geoffrey Hobbs QC (sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court) stated
(at 173):

Section 3(1)(a) [_ie_ , the English equivalent of s 7(1)(_a_) of the current
TMA] prohibits the registrations of _“signs”_ which do not satisfy the
requirements of section 1(1) [_ie_ , the provision in the English Trade Marks
Act which sets out the definition of a “trade mark”] (because they are
incapable of being represented graphically and/or incapable of distinguishing
[the] goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings)
whereas the prohibitions in sections 3(1)(b), 3(1)(c) and 3(1)(d) [_ie_ , the
English equivalent of, respectively, ss 7(1)(_b_), 7(1)(_c_) and 7(1)(_d_) of
the current TMA] are applicable to _“trade marks”_ , _i.e._ signs which
satisfy the requirements of section 1(1). From the proviso to section 3(1)
[which corresponds to s 7(2) of the current TMA] it is apparent that sections
3(1)(b), 3(1)(c) and 3(1)(d) prohibit the registration of signs which satisfy
the requirements of section 1(1), but nonetheless lack a distinctive character
in the absence of appropriate use. This implies that **_the requirements of
section 1(1) are satisfied even in cases where a sign represented graphically
is only “capable” to the limited extent of being “not incapable” of
distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from those of other
undertakings. Such signs are not excluded from registration by section
3(1)(a)_**. Section 3(1)(a) has the more limited effect envisaged by article
3(1)(a) of the [European Trade Marks] Directive of preventing the
registrations of _“signs which cannot constitute a trade mark”_ at the time
when they are put forward for registration. It is clear that signs which are
not objectionable under section 3(1)(a) may nevertheless be objectionable
under other provisions of section 3 including sections 3(1)(b), 3(1)(c) and
3(1)(d). [emphasis added in bold italics]

88 Similarly, in _Premier Luggage and Bags Ltd v The Premier Company (UK) Ltd_
[2001] FSR 29, the English High Court held, citing (_inter alia_) _AD2000
Trade Mark_ , that although “Premier” was an ordinary laudatory word, it was
capable of distinguishing the claimant’s luggage and travel goods as it was
not incapable of distinguishing those products from the luggage and travel
goods of other traders (at [19]). This particular finding was upheld by the
English Court of Appeal in _Premier Luggage and Bags Ltd v Premier Company
(UK) Ltd_ [2003] FSR 5 (although the court ultimately allowed the appeal on
other grounds), where Chadwick LJ stated (at [50]):

I reject the submission, made on behalf of [the first defendant] in this
Court, that the word “Premier” is incapable of being or becoming distinctive
of origin. In particular, I do not accept that the word “Premier”, although
plainly capable of being used in a descriptive or adjectival sense (denoting
primacy or superiority over other members of the class) and so (absent use)
[being] devoid of any inherent distinctive character, cannot become
distinctive of origin as a result of use in relation to particular goods or
services. “Premier” is not a word like “soap” which can only describe the
article to which it is applied …

89 In the present case, two decisions of the English Court of Appeal dealing
with the question of the capacity to distinguish _vis-à-vis_ s 3(1)(a) of the
English Trade Marks Act (which is similar to s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA)
appear to have played a significant part in the Judge’s decision that the
Opposed Mark did not constitute a “trade mark” as defined by s 2(1) of the
current TMA since the Rooster Sign (which forms the essence of the Opposed
Mark) “did not distinguish Qinghai Meheco’s cordyceps from that of the other
suppliers which use[d] the same mark [_ie_ , the Rooster Sign]” (see [49] of
the Judgment). In the opinion of the Judge, each of these English cases set
out a different approach as to how a mark’s capacity to distinguish is to be
assessed, as follows (see [37]–[38] of the Judgment):

37 A mark’s capability to distinguish the goods of one person from the goods
of other persons can be understood and ascertained in two ways. _One way is to
focus on the inherent nature of the mark._ A mark consisting of the word
“cordyceps” or a mark of a picture of a cordycep will not have the capability
to distinguish one trader’s cordyceps from those of other traders. The
[Opposed Mark], looked at on its own in this way, is capable of distinguishing
one trader’s cordyceps from others.

38 _The second way of assessing the capability to distinguish [of a mark] is
to look at the mark and the surrounding circumstances at the time of the
application to register, and decide whether the mark can identify … the goods
of the applicant from the goods of other suppliers in the circumstances._
Employing this method, if the [Opposed Mark] is used by Qinghai Meheco as well
as other provincial suppliers, it is not capable of distinguishing Qinghai
Meheco’s cordyceps from the other suppliers’ cordyceps.

[emphasis added]

90 The case which applied the first approach (_ie_ , the approach set out at
[37] of the Judgment) was _Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer
Products Ltd_ [1999] RPC 809 (“ _Philips (No 1)_ ”). In that case, the
plaintiff (“Philips”), which produced three-headed rotary shavers, registered
a trade mark consisting of a picture of the head of a three-headed rotary
shaver. When the defendant (“Remington”) introduced a three-headed rotary
shaver under its own “Remington” mark, Philips sued Remington for trade mark
infringement while Remington counterclaimed for invalidation of the
registration of Philips’ mark on (_inter alia_) the ground that the
registration of that mark offended s 3(1)(a) of the English Trade Marks Act
(_viz_ , the English equivalent of s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA). On this
particular point, as Morcom _et al_ ([52] _supra_) have succinctly summarised
(at para 5.22), the English Court of Appeal essentially held that “a picture
or a shape of a three-dimensional article [was] not registrable as a trade
mark in respect of [that] article if it [was] purely descriptive of that
article, and no more”. Thus, Philips’ mark featuring the head of a three-
headed rotary shaver was found to be incapable of distinguishing Philips’
three-headed rotary shavers from three-headed rotary shavers that other
companies might have produced. As Aldous LJ, who delivered the judgment of the
court, stated (see _Philips (No 1)_ at 818):

[Philips’] trade mark shows the head of a particular three headed rotary
shaver and it would be recognised by the trade and [the] public as such,
albeit as one made by Philips. Even though there are a number of other designs
of three headed rotary shavers that could be produced, the shape shown in the
trademark is a shape which, absent patent, registered design, copyright or
unfair trading protection, another trader is entitled to make. It is not
capable of distinguishing Philips’ shavers of that shape from those of other
traders who produce shavers with a similar shaped head.

91 Of greater relevance for present purposes would be the fact that Aldous LJ
stated in an earlier part of his judgment that “the capability of
distinguishing _depend[ed] upon the features of the trade mark itself, not on
the result of its use_ ” [emphasis added] (_id_ at 817). Thus, _Philips (No
1)_ would stand for the proposition that a trade mark’s capacity to
distinguish must arise from the inherent features or characteristics of the
mark itself, and not from its use.

92 The case which adopted the second approach (_ie_ , the approach set out at
[38] of the Judgment) was _Bach and Bach Flower Remedies_ _Trade Marks_ [2000]
RPC 513 (“ _Bach_ ”). In that case, the trade marks in contention (“the ‘Bach’
trade marks”) were used in respect of herbal remedies. Those remedies were the
creation of Dr Edward Bach (“Dr Bach”), who had formulated 38 new herbal
remedies between 1928 and 1935. Over time, those remedies gained recognition
and became known as “Bach Flower Remedies”. After Dr Bach’s death, eight trade
marks in respect of Dr Bach’s remedies (_ie_ , the “Bach” trade marks), which
consisted of either the word “Bach” alone or the words “Bach Flower Remedies”,
were registered between 1979 and 1991. Bach Flowers Remedies Ltd was the
proprietor of the “Bach” trade marks. In 1997, another company, Healing Herbs
Ltd, which had been producing the 38 remedies that had been created by Dr
Bach, applied for, _inter alia_ , a declaration that the “Bach” trade marks
had been registered in breach of s 3(1)(a) of the English Trade Marks Act
(which, as mentioned earlier, corresponds to s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA).

93 Bach Flowers Remedies Ltd argued that the word “Bach” was capable of
distinguishing its products, and relied on the decision of Aldous LJ in
_Philips (No 1)_ ([90] _supra_) in support of its argument. It elaborated that
the word “Bach” was not an ordinary English word, and that this therefore
rendered the “Bach” trade marks capable of distinguishing the products in
respect of which the marks had been registered (see _Bach_ at [31]). Healing
Herbs Ltd, on the other hand, submitted that a mark’s capacity to distinguish
would depend on the meaning of the word constituting the mark and that the
meaning of any word would depend in part on its normal use (_id_ at [32]).
Therefore, it would not be correct for the court to altogether ignore the use
of the word “Bach” in the period prior to the registration of the “Bach” trade
marks (_ibid_). Morritt LJ, who delivered the main judgment, found in favour
of Healing Herbs Ltd. He was of the opinion that the use made of the “Bach”
trade marks was relevant in assessing whether they had the requisite capacity
to distinguish, stating (see _Bach_ at [34]–[35]):

34\. I accept the submission that the meaning of a word may depend on its
usage. It is not uncommon for a proper name, by use, to acquire an adjectival
meaning which is descriptive of the article to which it is applied. Examples
given in the course of argument[s] [demonstrate] the point. Thus the terms “a
Bunsen burner” and “a Wellington boot” are wholly descriptive and cannot,
without more, distinguish such burners or boots of one undertaking from those
of another. In accordance with that use the expression has become the common
name in the trade for the product in question. … The question is whether or
not the word “BACH” had, by 1979, acquired such a meaning so as to be
incapable, without more, of affording the requisite distinction. If it had
then [the definition of a “trade mark” in] section 1(1) [of the English Trade
Marks Act] is not satisfied … Accordingly I accept the submission that it is
both permissible and necessary in considering the application of paragraph (a)
[of s 3(1) of the English Trade Marks Act] to determine the meaning of the
word as used at the time of the application for registration. I do not
understand Aldous [LJ] in [_Philips (No 1)_] … to have been considering the
relevance of use to the meaning of the word.

35\. The usage in question must be by those engaged in the relevant trade or
activity. Normally that will be the usage of the average consumer of the goods
in question … Obviously the evidence on that question is not limited to those
who are consumers or end-users but may extend to others concerned in the trade
such [as] manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. But I do not think that
the court is assisted by repetitious evidence from individuals put forward by
the parties, whether expressly or not, as archetypal average consumers or end-
users for, by definition, no one individual is such a consumer or end-user and
the issue cannot be resolved by counting heads. …

94 In the present case, although the Judge referred to _Philips (No 1)_ ([90]
_supra_) and _Bach_ ([92] _supra_), he did not refer to the ECJ case of
_Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer Products Ltd_ [2003]
Ch 159 (“ _Philips (No 2)_ ”). In _Philips (No 1)_ , the English Court of
Appeal, after expressing its provisional opinion (at 818) that Philips’ mark
was not a registrable mark for the purposes of s 3(1)(a) of the English Trade
Marks Act, decided to refer the case to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling on
the interpretation of certain provisions in the European Trade Marks
Directive. One of the questions posed to the ECJ was the following (see
_Philips (No 2)_ at [23]):

[W]hether there is a category of marks which is not excluded from registration
by article[s] 3(1)(b), (c) and (d) and article 3(3) of the [European Trade
Marks] Directive [_ie_ , the European equivalent of, respectively, ss
7(1)(_b_), 7(1)(_c_), 7(1)(_d_) and 7(2) of the current TMA] [but] which is
nonetheless excluded from registration by article 3(1)(a) thereof [_ie_ , the
European equivalent of s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA] on the ground that such
marks are incapable of distinguishing the goods of the proprietor from those
of other undertakings.

On this question, the ECJ held (_id_ at [36]–[40]):

36 It is true that article 3(1)(a) of the [European Trade Marks] Directive
provides that signs which cannot constitute a trade mark are to be refused
registration or if registered are liable to be declared invalid.

37 However, it is clear from the wording of article 3(1)(a) and the structure
of the [European Trade Marks] Directive that that provision is intended
essentially to exclude from registration signs which are not generally capable
of being a trade mark and thus cannot be represented graphically and/or are
not capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from
those of other undertakings.

38 Accordingly, article 3(1)(a) of the [European Trade Marks] Directive, like
the rule laid down by article[s] 3(1)(b), (c) and (d), precludes the
registration of signs or indications which do not meet one of the two
conditions imposed by article 2 of the [European Trade Marks] Directive [which
effectively corresponds to the definition of “trade mark” in s 2(1) of the
current TMA], that is to say, the condition requiring such signs to be capable
of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other
undertakings.

39 It follows that there is no class of marks having a distinctive character
by their nature or by the use made of them which is not capable of
distinguishing goods or services within the meaning of article 2 of the
[European Trade Marks] Directive.

40 In the light of those considerations, the answer to the … question must be
that there is no category of marks which is not excluded from registration by
article[s] 3(1)(b), (c) and (d) and article 3(3) of the [European Trade Marks]
Directive [but] which is [nonetheless] excluded from registration by article
3(1)(a) thereof on the ground that such marks are incapable of distinguishing
the goods of the proprietor of the mark from those of other undertakings.

95 What would be especially relevant for present purposes is that the ECJ
stated that the objective of Art 3(1)(a) of the European Trade Marks Directive
(which, as mentioned earlier, is the European equivalent of s 7(1)(_a_) of the
current TMA) was to preclude the registration of “signs which [were] _not
generally capable of being a trade mark_ ” [emphasis added] (see _Philips (No
2)_ at [37]), _ie_ , signs which “[could not] be represented graphically
and/or [were] not capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one
undertaking from those of other undertakings” (_ibid_). Furthermore, the ECJ
stated expressly (see _Philips (No 2)_ at [40]) that marks which were not
excluded from registration by Arts 3(1)(b), 3(1)(c), 3(1)(d) and 3(3) of the
European Trade Marks Directive (which correspond to, respectively, ss
7(1)(_b_), 7(1)(_c_), 7(1)(_d_) and 7(2) of the current TMA) could not be
excluded from registration under Art 3(1)(a) (_ie_ , the European equivalent
of s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA).

96 The above pronouncements of the ECJ in _Philips (No 2)_ indicate that the
requirement encapsulated in the expression “capable of distinguishing” in the
definition of a “trade mark” in s 2(1) of the current TMA is a _threshold_
requirement, and appear to accord with the view of Andrew Phang Boon Leong J
in _Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd v Oystertec Plc_ [2006] 1 SLR 712 (“ _Nation
Fittings_ ”), where he stated that the “capable of distinguishing” requirement
stipulated in s 2(1) was a “relatively low _threshold criterion_ ” [emphasis
added] (at [136]). Such an analysis is also consistent with the thesis of the
learned author of Ng-Loy’s _Intellectual Property_ ([52] _supra_), who states
(at para 21.3.5) that there are three thresholds of distinctiveness _vis-à-
vis_ trade marks, with the _first threshold_ being found in the statutory
definition of “trade mark” itself (specifically, in the requirement that a
mark or sign must have the requisite capacity to distinguish before it can
constitute a “trade mark” as defined in s 2(1) of the current TMA (see the
passage reproduced at [84] above)). In the light of the above it would not be
incorrect to adopt the approach which the English Court of Appeal took in
_Philips (No 1)_ ([90] _supra_) – _ie_ , that in assessing whether a sign or
mark possesses the requisite capacity to distinguish so as to constitute a
trade mark, one should look only at the inherent features or characteristics
of that sign or mark, and not at its use. It may also be pertinent to point
out that pursuant to s 7(2) of the current TMA, in assessing whether a sign or
mark should be refused registration by virtue of s 7(1), regard may be had to
“the use made of [the sign or mark]” (_per_ s 7(2)) where ss
7(1)(_b_)–7(1)(_d_) are concerned, but _not_ where s 7(1)(_a_) is concerned.
Thus, conceptually, it would appear that there is cogent support for the
approach in _Philips (No 1)_ as opposed to the approach in _Bach_ ([92]
_supra_).

97 Accordingly, and with respect, we are of the view that the Judge erred in
adopting the approach of the English Court of Appeal in _Bach_. Instead, the
approach set out by the English Court of Appeal in _Philips (No 1)_ should be
adopted, _ie_ , for the purposes of assessing whether a sign or mark satisfies
the definition of a “trade mark” as required by s 7(1)(_a_) of the current
TMA, the capacity to distinguish of that sign or mark must arise from the
inherent features or characteristics of the sign or mark itself, and must not
be the result of the use of it. The issue of whether the use of a sign or mark
shows that the sign or mark has the requisite capacity to distinguish so as to
fall within the statutory definition of a “trade mark” would be more
appropriately canvassed under a different limb of s 7(1); for example, it can
be considered in relation to s 7(1)(_d_) (see [76] above), which would fall
under the second threshold of distinctiveness in Ng-Loy’s analysis (see [84]
above). Indeed, the issue raised in _Bach_ on the relevance of the use of a
mark _vis-à-vis_ the mark’s capacity to distinguish might, perhaps, have been
better dealt with under s 3(1)(d) of the English Trade Marks Act (_ie_ , the
English equivalent of s 7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA).

98 Interestingly, Mr Tan, lead counsel for the Plaintiff, in his book, Tan’s
_Law of Trade Marks_ ([54] _supra_), which was published after the release of
the ECJ’s decision in _Philips (No 2)_ ([94] _supra_), appears to share the
above-mentioned view. He states expressly that a sign’s capacity to
distinguish must arise from “the inherent features or characteristics of the
sign itself, [and] not as a result of its use” (see Tan’s _Law of Trade Marks_
at para 5.9). He then adds that the “use of the sign is _not relevant at all_
when considering whether [the sign] is capable of being distinguishable under
this ground” [emphasis added] (_ibid_).

99 In passing, we would acknowledge that there are some writers who have
suggested that the correct interpretation of _Philips (No 2)_ is that it
stands for the proposition that Art 3(1)(a) of the European Trade Marks
Directive (_ie_ , the European equivalent of s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA)
is not a separate ground for invalidating the registration of a trade mark and
has to be read together with Arts 3(1)(b), 3(1)(c) and 3(1)(d) (which
correspond to, respectively, ss 7(1)(_b_), 7(1)(_c_) and 7(1)(_d_) of the
current TMA) (see, _eg_ , Bently & Sherman ([74] _supra_) at p 799). On this
view, the grounds for invalidation set out in Arts 3(1)(b), 3(1)(c) and
3(1)(d) of the European Trade Marks Directive are in essence “elaborations of
the basic requirement of capacity to distinguish” (_ibid_). Thus, “[i]f a mark
is devoid of distinctive character, it lacks capacity to distinguish; if a
sign is descriptive it lacks capacity to distinguish, and so forth” (_ibid_).
In the present case, there is no need for us to give a conclusive opinion on
this interpretation of _Philips (No 2)_ , except to observe that this way of
reading the four grounds enumerated in the sub-paragraphs of s 7(1) of the
current TMA would run counter to the express wording of the Act itself, which
clearly indicates that each of the grounds set out in s 7(1) is a separate
ground for refusing to register a sign or mark as a trade mark. We would also
note that it may well be that a specific fact situation could fall under more
than one limb of s 7(1).

(2) Whether the Rooster Sign has the requisite capacity to distinguish

100 In our view, the Rooster Sign is clearly capable of distinguishing one
trader’s cordyceps from those of other traders. A sign consisting of the word
“cordyceps” or a sign taking the form of a picture of cordyceps is not likely
to have the capacity to distinguish. In contrast, the Rooster Sign, looked at
on its own, is conspicuously capable of distinguishing one trader’s cordyceps
from other traders’ cordyceps because of the distinctive “rooster flower”
which it bears. Bearing in mind the earlier discussion on the need to focus on
the inherent features or characteristics of the sign itself in assessing
whether it has the requisite capacity to distinguish (see [90]–[98] above), it
is clear that the Rooster Sign, at the time of Qinghai Meheco’s application to
register it as a trade mark in Singapore, was capable of distinguishing
Qinghai Meheco’s cordyceps from the cordyceps of other suppliers, and this
sign, since its registration in Singapore as the Opposed Mark, has continued
to serve the same function _vis-à-vis_ the First Defendant’s cordyceps. In
this respect, we have also noted that, presently, cordyceps from the PRC are
being sold in the market under various marks or brands (see [65] above]) and
the Opposed Mark is just one of these marks or brands.

101 For these reasons, we are of the view that the Judge’s ruling that the
registration of the Opposed Mark could be invalidated pursuant to s 23(1) read
with s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA is, with respect, wrong. Furthermore, we
would add that even if the Judge’s approach (_viz_ , the approach in _Bach_
([92] _supra_)) were adopted, the same result would be reached, _ie_ , the
Rooster Sign would still be found to have the requisite capacity to
distinguish so as to constitute a “trade mark” as defined in s 2(1) of the
current TMA. In the court below, the Judge held otherwise, stating (at [44] of
the Judgment):

The issues in _Bach_ … are the same [as the] issues in the present case.
“Bach”, looked at by itself, was capable of distinguishing a [producer’s]
goods, as the [Rooster Sign] was. With time, however, “Bach” became associated
with the remedies created by Dr Bach. The [Rooster Sign] by itself had the
capability to distinguish, but it had become associated with cordyceps from
all Chinese sources.

However, as we have already shown (see [62]–[65] and [78]–[80] above), the
evidence is at best equivocal as to whether the Rooster Sign has become
“associated with cordyceps from all Chinese sources” (see [44] of the
Judgment) as the Judge thought. Furthermore, the fact that more than one party
is entitled to use a particular sign or mark for the same product, which might
have been the position in the present case (see [78] above and [114] below),
does not in itself entail that the sign or mark in question is therefore
incapable of distinguishing the various sources of that product. In such a
situation, the sign or mark still serves its function as a badge of origin
(although it does so _vis-à-vis_ multiple suppliers – _ie_ , all the suppliers
who are entitled to use the sign or mark to market the product concerned – and
not _vis-à-vis_ one particular supplier) as there are other third parties who
are certainly not at liberty to use the sign or mark for the same product. In
this respect, it is also pertinent to note that under s 38 of the current TMA,
a registered trade mark is assignable and transmissible by the proprietor to
another party in the same way as any other personal or movable property. This
is a point which appears not to have been fully appreciated by the Judge when
he highlighted (at [46] of the Judgment) that cordyceps bearing the Rooster
Sign from Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies other than Qinghai Meheco were
being sold in Singapore by 1994.

_Section 7(6): The application to register the impugned trade mark was made in
bad faith_

102 We now turn to the third ground advanced by the Plaintiff to invalidate
the registration of the Opposed Mark, namely, the presence of bad faith in
Qinghai Meheco’s application to register the Rooster Sign as a trade mark in
Singapore. Section 7(6) of the current TMA provides that “[a] trade mark shall
not be registered if or to the extent that the application is made in bad
faith”. In arguing that the registration of the Opposed Mark should be
invalidated on this ground, the Plaintiff submits that the fact that Qinghai
Meheco did not have the exclusive right to use the Rooster Sign at the time
the latter applied to register that sign as a trade mark meant that the
application for registration was made in bad faith.

(1) What constitutes “bad faith” for the purposes of section 7(6)

103 In a number of cases under the English Trade Marks Act, it has been
suggested that conduct can be described as being in bad faith if it involves
dishonesty or at least falls short of acceptable commercial behaviour in the
particular trade concerned. This was the view of Lindsay J in the leading case
of _Gromax Plasticulture Ltd v Don &_  _Low Nonwovens Ltd_ [1999] RPC 367 (“
_Gromax Plasticulture_ ”), where he stated (at 379):

Plainly [bad faith] includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, [it] includes
also some dealings which fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial
behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the particular area
[of trade] being examined.

104 The _concept_ of bad faith under s 7(6) of the current TMA was first
reviewed by the Singapore courts in _Rothmans of Pall Mall Limited v Maycolson
International Ltd_ [2006] 2 SLR 551 (“ _Rothmans_ ”) (that case actually
concerned s 7(6) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the 1999
TMA”), which is identical to s 7(6) of the current TMA). In _Rothmans_ , Lai
Siu Chiu J endorsed (at [32]) Lindsay J’s formulation of the concept of bad
faith in _Gromax Plasticulture_. This approach was also accepted by Rajah JA
in _Warman_ ([37] _supra_), where he stated (at [48]):

It would be fair to say that the term “bad faith” embraces not only actual
dishonesty but also dealings which would be considered as commercially
unacceptable by reasonable and experienced persons in a particular trade, even
though such dealings may otherwise involve “no breach of any duty, obligation,
prohibition or requirement that is legally binding” upon the registrant of the
trade mark: see _Demon Ale Trade Mark_ [2000] RPC 345 at 356; and [Tan’s _Law
of Trade Marks_ ([54] _supra_)] at p 129.

105 The _test_ for determining the presence of bad faith, in the context of
the English Trade Marks Act, was settled by the English Court of Appeal in
_Harrison_ _v Teton Valley_ _Trading Co Ltd_ [2004] 1 WLR 2577, where Sir
William Aldous, with whom Arden and Pill LJJ agreed, expressed the test as
follows (at [26]):

The words “bad faith” suggest a mental state. Clearly when considering the
question of whether an application to register is made in bad faith all the
circumstances will be relevant. However the court must decide whether the
knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision to apply for
registration would be regarded as [being] in bad faith by persons adopting
proper standards.

This test, which was referred to by Sir Aldous (_id_ at [25]) as the
“combined” test of bad faith, contains both a subjective element (_viz_ , what
the particular applicant knows) and an objective element (_viz_ , what
ordinary persons adopting proper standards would think).

106 Recently, this combined test of bad faith was succinctly explained in
_Ajit Weekly Trade Mark_ [2006] RPC 25 as follows (at [35] and [41]):

35 … Bad faith is to be judged according to the combined test of dishonesty
for accessory liability [for] breach of trust set out by the majority of the
House of Lords in _Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley_ [2002] 2 A.C. 164, with _Gromax
Plasticulture_ [([103] _supra_)] … providing the appropriate standard namely,
acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced persons
in the particular commercial area being examined.

…

41 … [T]he upshot of the Privy [Council’s] decision in [_Barlow Clowes
International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd_ [2006] 1 WLR 1476] is: (a) to
confirm the House of Lords’ test for dishonesty applied in _Twinsectra_ , i.e.
the combined test; and (b) to resolve any ambiguity in the majority of their
Lordships’ statement of that test by making it clear that an enquiry into a
defendant’s views as regards normal standards of honesty is not part of the
test. The subjective element of the test means that the tribunal must
ascertain what the defendant knew about the transaction or other matters in
question. It must then be decided whether in the light of that knowledge, the
defendant’s conduct is dishonest judged by ordinary standards of honest
people, the defendant’s own standards of honesty being irrelevant to the
objective element …

107 Hence, to succeed in invalidating the registration of the Opposed Mark on
the basis that the application for registration was made in bad faith, the
Plaintiff must show not only that the conduct of Qinghai Meheco (the First
Defendant’s predecessor in title) in applying for the registration of the
Rooster Sign in Singapore fell short of the normally accepted standards of
commercial behaviour, but also that Qinghai Meheco knew of facts which, to an
ordinary honest person, would have made the latter realise that what Qinghai
Meheco was doing would be regarded as breaching those standards (see also
_Kerly’s_ ([52] _supra_) at para 8-275).

(2) Whether there was bad faith in Qinghai Meheco’s application for
registration

108 The Plaintiff’s case, in summary, is that Qinghai Meheco’s application to
register the Rooster Sign as a trade mark in Singapore was made in bad faith
because Qinghai Meheco did not have the exclusive right to use the Rooster
Sign at the time of its application for registration. According to the
Plaintiff, since the 1980s, besides Qinghai Meheco, other Chinese cordyceps-
exporting companies had also been supplying cordyceps under the Rooster Sign
to Singapore. The Plaintiff asserts that when Qinghai Meheco applied to
register the Rooster Sign as a trade mark in Singapore, the latter knew or
must have known that it was not the first or the only user of the sign in
Singapore. In particular, it knew or must have known that there were other
Chinese state-owned foreign trade companies as well as other Chinese
provincial branch companies which had been using the Rooster Sign (through
their distributors) in Singapore for several decades prior to September 1995.
The Plaintiff contends that Qinghai Meheco also knew or must also have known
that the surreptitious registration of the Rooster Sign in the PRC by its
predecessor in title (_ie_ , Qinghai Cofco) in 1984 had caused consternation
and concerns amongst the other Chinese cordyceps-exporting companies, which
felt that the Rooster Sign was common property and could not be appropriated
by any one person or company. The Plaintiff further highlights that there is
no evidence that Qinghai Meheco or Qinghai Cofco created the Rooster Sign and
was the first party to use it in the PRC and/or Singapore. In the light of
Qinghai Meheco’s knowledge of these matters, Qinghai Meheco’s conduct, the
Plaintiff argues, ought to be construed as dishonest as judged by reasonable
and experienced persons in the particular commercial area being examined (_ie_
, the cordyceps trade in Singapore). Alternatively, the Plaintiff submits that
it ought to be inferred that Qinghai Meheco’s conduct “would be considered as
commercially unacceptable by reasonable and experienced persons” (_per_ Rajah
JA in _Warman_ ([37] _supra_) at [48]) in the cordyceps trade in Singapore.
Specifically, the Plaintiff contends that where a sign or mark has been used
openly and without objection in Singapore for over 40 years by several
producers and distributors in relation to a product, that sign or mark being
the only one which has been used for the product, it would be dishonest for
any one of the producers or distributors to then come forward and claim that
the sign or mark belongs to him exclusively and is distinctive of his product
only.

109 In our view, the Plaintiff’s case is similar to that of the plaintiff in
_Warman_. In that case, the key issue in respect of the plaintiff’s
application to (_inter alia_) invalidate the registration of the defendant’s
“Warman” mark centred on the proprietorship of that mark. Rajah JA observed
that it would be acceptable commercial behaviour for a person to apply to
register a sign or mark as a trade mark if that person had, at the very least,
a _right to register_ that sign or mark. In this regard, he stated the
following (at [49]):

In the present case, it is common ground that the key issue in the
determination of bad faith pivots around the fulcrum of proprietorship of the
“Warman” mark in Singapore. It appears to me to be an incontrovertible
proposition that if a registrant of a trade mark has proprietorship of that
trade mark, or at the very least, the _right to register_ that trade mark,
then such registration of the trade mark should fall well within the standards
of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced
persons in the particular trade. Conversely, where it can be shown that the
applicant [knows] of an _exclusive_ proprietary right of _another_ in relation
to the trade mark [which] it seeks to furtively register, then any such
registration would, almost invariably, quite clearly fall short of the
relevant standards. As such, it is important to first examine and determine
the issue of proprietorship. [emphasis in original]

110 In response to the Plaintiff’s allegation that Qinghai Meheco did not have
the exclusive right to use the Rooster Sign as at 6 September 1995 (the date
of Qinghai Meheco’s application for registration), Zhang, the managing
director of the First Defendant, recounted the history of the China Mark and
emphasised the legitimacy of Qinghai Cofco’s _registration_ of the Rooster
Sign in the PRC (as the China Mark).[note: 21] According to Zhang, the Rooster
Sign was first registered as a trade mark in the PRC by Qinghai Cofco on 15
June 1985. Under Chinese trade mark law, a “first-to-register”[note: 22] rule
applied. So long as a sign or mark had yet to be registered as a trade mark,
any party could apply to register that sign or mark regardless of whether it
had previously been used by any other party. Objections to the application for
registration could be raised within the statutory time frame, but, in the case
of Qinghai Cofco’s application to register the Rooster Sign, no objections
were raised.

111 Zhang also gave an account of the legitimacy of Qinghai Cofco’s _decision
to register_ the Rooster Sign as a trade mark in the PRC. Qinghai, he stated
during cross-examination, was the place of origin of cordyceps. He
elaborated:[note: 23]

In [the PRC], before the 1970s, what existed was a planned economy. Qinghai
Meheco can be regarded as the place of origin [_ie_ , the original source] of
cordyceps; Qinghai Meheco and its predecessor, Qinghai Native Products [_ie_ ,
the Qinghai branch of China Tuhsu (see [14] above)].

Qinghai, Zhang added, was also the largest producer and exporter of cordyceps
under the Rooster Sign at the time that sign was registered as a trade mark in
the PRC. In this regard, he stated during cross-examination:[note: 24]

[E]ven though the witnesses for the [P]laintiff have been saying that …
Qinghai was the exporter and producer of cordyceps since the ‘50s and ‘60s …
in fact Qinghai has all along been the main producer of cordyceps, the largest
[exporter] and [producer] of cordyceps in [the PRC], accounting for about 80
per cent of the total export output.

112**** The First Defendant argued in its submissions in the court below
that:[note: 25]

Since the [First] Defendant’s predecessors were the originators of the
[product] and the largest producers and exporters, it is clear that they
[were] the proprietors of the mark in [the PRC]. Hence, China Cereals Qinghai
Branch [_ie_ , Qinghai Cofco] rightly took steps to register the Rooster
[Sign] as a trade mark in [the PRC] when the PRC Trade Mark Laws first came
into force in 1983.

Indeed, the evidence of one of the Plaintiff’s witnesses, Deng, an ex-employee
of Chongqing Meheco, supports this contention. In his affidavit filed on 1
November 2006, Deng exhibited a letter written by Chongqing Meheco in November
1995 (after the Xining Meeting of June 1995 (see [17] above)) to the China
Chamber of Commerce protesting against, _inter alia_ , Qinghai Meheco’s
registration of the China Mark in its (_ie_ , Qinghai Meheco’s) name (after
that trade mark was assigned by Qinghai Cofco to Qinghai Meheco). The letter
stated that:[note: 26]

It was brought to our attention recently that [Qinghai Meheco] has
successfully registered the [Rooster Sign] as a local trademark under the
company, and has appointed legal counsel to apply for registration in the
Singapore market. All [this was] done without informing the members of the
commission [_ie_ , the commission set up by the China Chamber of Commerce to
stabilise the cordyceps trade] … If [this is] true, the [China] Chamber of
Commerce and members of the commission must experience the same feelings of
regret. At the Xining [M]eeting, all [the] companies were very concerned about
the trademark issue and … specifically studied the problem under the
leadership of the chamber [_ie_ , the China Chamber of Commerce]. The
consensus then was for [Qinghai Meheco] to take the lead in registering the
“Rooster” brand as a local trademark and for all member companies to fully
support its move, and for the [China] Chamber of Commerce to subsequently
arrange for [registration] in foreign markets on a collective basis …

113 During cross-examination, Deng confirmed that Qinghai Meheco was to take
the lead in registering the Rooster Sign as a trade mark as it was the largest
producer and exporter of cordyceps in the PRC at that time. He stated during
cross-examination:[note: 27]

Q. |  Was it the case that Qinghai Meheco was to take the lead in registering the Rooster [Sign] as a trade mark locally because it was the largest exporter of cordyceps amongst various producers in [the PRC]?  
---|---  
… |   
A. |  Yes, by comparison it was the largest exporter.  
Q. |  Certainly, as far as Singapore was concerned, Qinghai [Meheco] was the largest exporter of cordyceps, do you agree?  
A. |  I am not sure, although I think it probably was because it ha[d] the largest export volume.  
  
114 The First Defendant further submits that although there might have been
complaints to the China Chamber of Commerce about the registration by Qinghai
Meheco of the China Mark in its name (after Qinghai Cofco assigned the rights
in the mark to Qinghai Meheco), the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff’s
witnesses shows that the China Chamber of Commerce was of the view that
Qinghai Meheco was the legitimate proprietor of the China Mark. For example,
during cross-examination, Deng admitted that the China Chamber of Commerce,
after receiving Chongqing Meheco’s letter of complaint of November 1995 (_ie_
, the letter mentioned at [112] above) as well as further complaints in 1999
from other Chinese provincial companies, had proposed that Chongqing Meheco
pay Qinghai Meheco a sum of money for the right to use the China Mark. This
would be a clear indication that the China Chamber of Commerce was of the view
that Qinghai Meheco was the legitimate owner of the China Mark and was trying
to negotiate for Qinghai Meheco to grant a licence to Chongqing Meheco to use
that trade mark. As Chongqing Meheco agreed to the China Chamber of Commerce’s
proposal, it appears to have acknowledged the trade mark rights of Qinghai
Meheco _vis-à-vis_ the China Mark. On this, Deng stated the following in his
evidence:[note: 28]

Q. |  Can you look at paragraph 7(6) of your affidavit now. Here you were referring to a further [China] Chamber of Commerce meeting in June 1999 and you said there was no resolution [of] this dispute. …  
---|---  
A. |  Yes.  
Q. |  So is it the case that when there was no resolution of this dispute, Chongqing Meheco and the various provincial companies then decided not to respect [Qinghai Meheco’s] trade mark rights?  
A, |  I shall put it this way, we were waiting for the [China] Chamber of Commerce to resolve this matter.  
Q. |  Between June 1999 and November 2005 did the [China] Chamber of Commerce take any steps to resolve [this] dispute?  
A. |  The [China] Chamber of Commerce co-ordinated and proposed that we pay a fee to use the trade mark [_ie_ , the China Mark].  
Q. |  Was this proposal accepted?  
A. |  Yes, we did accept.  
  
A similar licensing agreement was also entered into between Qinghai Meheco and
Sichuan Meheco _vis-à-vis_ the latter’s use of the China Mark.

115 The First Defendant also submits that it should be noted that the Chinese
cordyceps-exporting companies which the Plaintiff alleged were co-owners of
the Rooster Sign had not claimed to be so. The alleged co-owners were
restricted to the following key provincial companies as identified by Deng in
his affidavit and in his oral evidence in court:[note: 29]

Q. |  … “The ‘Rooster’ trade mark [_ie_ , the Rooster Sign] is maintained jointly by a few key companies through a long history, and thus should not be owned by a single company.” That is your complaint, right? It should not be owned by a single company.  
---|---  
A. |  Yes, that is exactly what I mean.  
Q. |  Now these few key companies that you talk about, when you say that it [_ie_ , the Rooster Sign] should be maintained by these few key companies this would be Qinghai Meheco … Sichuan Meheco, Chongqing Meheco and Chengdu Meheco?  
A. |  Yes.  
Q. |  These are the four companies?  
A. |  Mainly these four companies.  
  
The four companies, _viz_ , Qinghai Meheco, Sichuan Meheco, Chongqing Meheco
and Chengdu Meheco, were aware of the present proceedings, as can be seen from
the evidence of Tan, who stated that he had asked them to file affidavits on
the behalf of the Plaintiff.[note: 30] If these companies had indeed regarded
themselves as co-owners of the Rooster Sign, one would have expected them to
participate in the present proceedings as the outcome of the proceedings could
affect their ownership rights. These companies, however, chose not to
participate in the proceedings, which suggests that they did not regard
themselves as having any ownership rights _vis-à-vis_ the Rooster Sign.

116 All that the Plaintiff managed to obtain were affidavits from Zhao and
Deng (ex-employees of Sichuan Meheco and Chongqing Meheco respectively).
However, these witnesses are no longer representatives of their previous
employers and, as such, their evidence cannot be taken as the views of these
two Chinese provincial companies. This was correctly highlighted by the Judge
during the cross-examination of Tan by the First Defendant’s counsel, Mr
Ravindran, and, significantly, the Plaintiff’s lead counsel, Mr Tan, appeared
to concede the point, as can be seen from the following exchange between the
Judge, Mr Ravindran and Mr Tan:[note: 31]

[MR RAVINDRAN]: |  There is no affidavit in court from Sichuan Meheco, or Chengdu Meheco, or Chongqing Meheco to support [the Plaintiff’s] case, correct?  
---|---  
MR TAN: |  Your Honour, we have affidavits from Sichuan, Zhao … is from Sichuan Meheco, [Deng] is from Chongqing Meheco.  
MR RAVINDRAN: |  Your Honour, I don’t think that is the case. They [_ie_ , Zhao and Deng] are ex-employees and they have new companies, but the companies that were producing it [_ie_ , cordyceps] have not filed any affidavits.  
COURT: |  Are those current representatives of the company?  
MR TAN: |  They are not current representatives but formerly employees of these companies –  
COURT: |  So Mr Ravindran does make a point, if those companies have an interest, the interest exists, they could have filed an affidavit and they did not. Ex-employees file, but _you know those ex-employees do not represent the companies now. They do not say that they are doing it on behalf of the companies, do they?_ They are merely saying, “I was involved”, they were doing it in their own personal capacities.  
MR TAN: |  _Very well_.  
  
[emphasis added]

117 From the above, it is plain that the Plaintiff has failed to establish
that the original registrant of the Rooster Sign in the PRC, Qinghai Cofco,
should not have registered the sign in the PRC or did not have the right to
register it in that country. _Ex hypothesi_ , the Plaintiff has also failed to
establish that the First Defendant’s predecessor in title to the Opposed Mark,
Qinghai Meheco, should not have registered the Rooster Sign in Singapore (as
the Opposed Mark) or did not have the right to register that sign as a trade
mark in Singapore. Indeed, as was observed earlier (see [79] above), the
Plaintiff had in fact given unqualified support to Qinghai Meheco’s
application to register the Rooster Sign in Singapore. It does not reflect
well on the Plaintiff to be blowing both hot and cold _vis-à-vis_ Qinghai
Meheco’s entitlement to register the Rooster Sign as a trade mark in
Singapore. In this regard, we would reiterate that “[a]n allegation of bad
faith is a serious matter and should not be lightly inferred” (see _McDonald’s
Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd_ [2005] 1 SLR 177 at [78]). Clearly, on the
available evidence, the Plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proving
that there was a lack of good faith on the part of Qinghai Meheco when the
latter applied to register the Rooster Sign in Singapore. As Rajah JA stated
in _Warman_ ([37] _supra_) at [49]:

[I]f a registrant of a trade mark has proprietorship of that trade mark, or at
the very least, the _right to register_ that trade mark, then such
registration of the trade mark should fall well within the standards of
acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced persons
in the particular trade. [emphasis in original]

_Section 23(4): The registration of the impugned trade mark was procured by
fraud and/or misrepresentation_

118 We now come to the last head upon which the Plaintiff seeks to invalidate
the registration of the Opposed Mark. Pursuant to s 23(4) of the current TMA,
the registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid “on the ground of
fraud in the registration or [on the ground] that the registration was
obtained by misrepresentation”. The Plaintiff’s case for alleging fraud and/or
misrepresentation against the First Defendant is based on the latter’s acts
and omissions in its application to have its proprietorship of the Opposed
Mark registered.

(1) The requirement of fraud or misrepresentation

119 In _Warman_ , Rajah JA held that in order for a party to succeed in
invalidating the registration of a trade mark on the ground of fraud or
misrepresentation, it must be shown that the registration “[succeeded] only on
the strength of an untrue statement made by the registrant” (at [92]). For
this proposition, he referred to two local cases.

120 The first case was _National Diaries Ltd v Xie Chun Trading Pte Ltd_
[1998] 1 SLR 620, where the High Court held that the proprietor of a trade
mark had obtained the registration of that mark by fraud. The fraud consisted
of the claim by the proprietor that it was the sole proprietor of the trade
mark when, in fact, it was simply the sole agent for products manufactured in
Australia and sold under the mark.

121 The second case was _Yomeishu Seizo Co Ltd v Sinma Medical Products (S)
Pte Ltd_ [1991] SLR 499, where Chan Sek Keong J found that there was a serious
issue of fraud in relation to the registration of the “Yomeishu” mark,
together with the Chinese characters “? ? ?”, in respect of a Japanese
medicated wine. Prior to the registration of the “Yomeishu” mark in Singapore,
there had been an endorsement by way of an advertisement that the characters
“? ? ?” (the transliterated form of “Yomeishu”) had no meaning. Registration
was granted in Singapore mainly on the basis that the word “Yomeishu” in its
transliterated form (_ie_ , “? ? ?”) had already earlier been registered in
the UK as a trade mark with a similar endorsement that “[t]he transliteration
of the … characters of which the mark consists … has no meaning” (at 503,
[12]). However, an expert in the Chinese language subsequently gave evidence
that the Chinese characters depicting the word “Yomeishu” in its
transliterated form meant “the kind of wine that is tonic, nourishing and good
for health” (at 507, [26]), which evidence was not contradicted by the
evidence adduced by the registered proprietor of the “Yomeishu” mark in
Singapore. Chan J concluded (at 508–509, [30]):

… I have no doubt that if the UK registrar had been told that ‘? ? ?’ were
Chinese characters in origin although used by the Japanese as part of their
written language and that they conveyed the meaning [stated by the above-
mentioned Chinese language expert], he would never have accepted the
expression for registration as a mark … It may also be said that in accepting
the endorsement [that the characters comprising the word “Yomeishu” in its
transliterated form had no meaning] as one of the conditions for registration
in Singapore, the [registered proprietor had] similarly allowed the [Registrar
of Trade Marks in Singapore] to think that ‘? ? ?’ were Japanese characters
with no meaning.

122 In so far as the _concept_ of fraud _vis-à-vis_ trade mark legislation was
concerned, Chan J cited with approval (_id_ at 509, [32]) the English case of
_Bentley Motors (1931), Ld v Lagonda, Ld and Walker Owen Bentley_ (1947) 64
RPC 33, which indicated that there must be some form of _deception_ involved.
In that case, Roxburgh J stated (at 35):

I am most anxious to avoid defining “fraud” in the context in which it appears
here, because apparently it has not yet been done, and I am not anxious to be
the first to do it if it is not necessary for me to do it; but when I see in
conjunction the words “obtained by fraud”, I feel bound to hold that it
involves some element of _actual deception_ by the applicant for registration.
_I want to make it plain that in using the phrase “actual deception” I do not
necessarily exclude all omissions, because it is quite possible, and I think
it is a trite saying, that a statement may be in such a form that having
regard to what is omitted it is deceptive, though on the face of it and taken
quite alone it is not deceptive._

But in my judgment a claimant who sets out to say that registration was
obtained by fraud must allege some actual deception by word or deed, or some
omission by word or deed, of the character which I have just indicated …

[emphasis added]

(2) Whether section 23(4) of the current TMA is applicable in the present case

123 There is a preliminary issue which should be addressed at this juncture.
In the court below, the Judge observed (at [26] of the Judgment) that the
thrust and focus of the complaint of fraud was that the registration of the
two _assignments_ mentioned at sub-para (c) of [7] above was tainted with
fraud and/or misrepresentation. However, the Plaintiff’s application in Prayer
1 and Prayer 2 of the Originating Summons was for the registration of _the
Opposed Mark_ (_ie_ , the registration of the Rooster Sign as the Opposed Mark
on 27 August 2001 pursuant to Qinghai Meheco’s application) – and _not_ the
registration of _the assignments_ – to be revoked and/or invalidated. In the
Judge’s opinion, s 23(4) of the current TMA would only apply to the
registration of a sign or mark as a trade mark (such registration will be
referred to in this part of our judgment as the “original registration”), as
opposed to the registration of subsequent transactions involving a trade mark
after its original registration (such as assignments of a registered trade
mark), and, therefore, the complaint of fraud was outside the scope of the
proceedings.

124 The Plaintiff argues, in its submissions to this court, that under the
current TMA, a person may obtain the registration of a trade mark in his name
by two methods, namely:

(a) by filing an application to register a trade mark as set out in s 5 of the
current TMA (“the first method of registration”); or

(b) by registering a subsequent transaction (such as an assignment) involving
a registered trade mark as provided for in s 39 of the current TMA (“the
second method of registration”).

On this view, s 23(4) of the current TMA would apply to the present case even
though the Plaintiff’s complaint is that the registration of the _assignments_
of the Opposed Mark (as opposed to the original registration of that mark) was
tainted with fraud and/or misrepresentation.

125 In our opinion, the Plaintiff’s interpretation of s 23(4) of the current
TMA is erroneous. To begin with, s 23(4) states that the “ _registration of a
trade mark_ ” [emphasis added] may be declared invalid on the ground that
there was fraud in the registration or that the registration was obtained by
misrepresentation. The plain interpretation of the words “registration of a
trade mark” would give the impression that this provision applies only to the
original registration of a trade mark. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff, in support
of its argument that s 23(4) also applies to the registration of subsequent
transactions concerning a registered trade mark, points to s 101 of the
current TMA, which states:

**Registration to be prima facie evidence**

**101.** In all legal proceedings relating to a registered trade mark or any
right thereunder (including proceedings for rectification of the register) —

(_a_) the register shall be prima facie evidence of anything contained
therein;

(_b_) the registration of the prescribed particulars of any registrable
transaction under section 39 shall be prima facie evidence of the transaction;
and

(_c_) the registration of a person as [the] proprietor of a registered trade
mark shall be prima facie evidence of —

(i) the validity of the _original registration_ ; and

(ii) _any subsequent assignment or other transmission of the registration_.

[emphasis added]

According to the Plaintiff, if the Legislature had seen fit to differentiate
between the first method of registration and the second method of registration
for the purposes of s 23(4) (_ie_ , if the Legislature had intended to limit
the application of s 23(4) to only the original registration of trade marks),
the Legislature would have used the phrase “original registration” in s 23(4)
just as it had done _vis-à-vis_ s 101(_c_)(i).

126 However, we do not think that too much should be read into the expression
“original registration” in s 101(_c_)(i) as the Legislature proceeded to use
the phrase “subsequent assignment or other transmission of the registration”
in s 101(_c_)(ii). This would indicate that there can only be _one
registration_ of a mark or sign as a trade mark, _viz_ , the “ _original
registration_ ” [emphasis added] mentioned in s 101(_c_)(i); a subsequent
assignment or transmission of a registered trade mark would merely be an
assignment or a transmission of the rights arising from the original
registration and not another registration of the (already registered) mark.

127 Further support for the view that the Legislature did not intend the
registration of assignments and transmissions of registered trade marks to be
treated as part and parcel of the registration of trade marks can be found in
the wording of s 39 of the current TMA, which (as we noted at [124] above) was
cited by the Plaintiff as the basis for the second method of registration.
Section 39 states:

**Registration of transactions affecting registered trade mark**

**39.** —(1) On application being made to the Registrar by —

(_a_) a person claiming to be entitled to an interest in or under a registered
trade mark by virtue of a registrable transaction; or

(_b_) any other person claiming to be affected by such a transaction,

the prescribed particulars of the transaction shall be entered in the
register.

(2) The following are registrable transactions under subsection (1):

(_a_) an assignment of a registered trade mark or any right in it;

(_b_) the grant of a licence under a registered trade mark;

(_c_) the granting of any security interest (whether fixed or floating) over a
registered trade mark or any right in or under it;

(_d_) the making by personal representatives of an assent in relation to a
registered trade mark or any right in or under it;

(_e_) an order of the Court or other competent authority transferring a
registered trade mark or any right in or under it.

(3) Until an application has been made for the registration of the prescribed
particulars of a registrable transaction referred to in subsection (2)(_a_),
(_c_), (_d_) or (_e_), the transaction is ineffective as against a person
acquiring a conflicting interest in or under the registered trade mark in
ignorance of the transaction.

(4) A person who becomes the proprietor of a registered trade mark by virtue
of any registrable transaction referred to in subsection (2)(_a_), (_c_),
(_d_) or (_e_) is not entitled to damages, an account of profits or statutory
damages under section 31(5)(_c_) in respect of any infringement of the
registered trade mark occurring after the date of the transaction and before
the date of the application for the registration of the prescribed particulars
of the transaction.

These provisions, in our view, show quite clearly that the registration of
subsequent transactions involving a registered trade mark is distinct from the
original registration of the trade mark itself.

128 Next, the Plaintiff argues that if the Judge’s interpretation of s 23(4)
of the current TMA were correct, it would mean that the registration of a
trade mark in a person’s name via the second method of registration (_ie_ , by
registering in that person’s name a subsequent transaction involving a
registered trade mark) would be unimpeachable for fraud or misrepresentation.
We do not see how that follows. The Judge’s interpretation of s 23(4) would
merely preclude the _deregistration_ of an _already registered_ trade mark
where there is fraud or misrepresentation in the registration of a subsequent
transaction involving that mark. In this regard, as a matter of logic, we see
no reason why the fact that a registered trade mark has been transacted under
fraud or misrepresentation should result in the original registration of that
mark being removed. If there is fraud or misrepresentation in relation to the
registration of a subsequent transaction involving a registered trade mark,
the complainant would normally be the person disposing of or granting rights
in the registered trade mark (_eg_ , the assignor, the licensor, _etc_) and
there is nothing to preclude that party from applying to the court to have the
registration of that transaction removed under general law (_ie_ , under the
general principles of law relating to fraud or misrepresentation (as the case
may be)). The proper remedy would be by way of civil proceedings and there is
nothing to prevent such proceedings from being commenced even though the
current TMA does not set out a regime for deregistering subsequent
transactions which are tainted with fraud or misrepresentation.

129 Indeed, the practical consequences of the Plaintiff’s interpretation of s
23(4) of the current TMA may have an adverse and far-reaching impact which the
Plaintiff has not (or may not have) fully appreciated. Bearing in mind the
rule of statutory construction that requires a particular word or phrase to be
given the same meaning whenever it is used in a statute, if the words
“registration of _a trade mark_ ” [emphasis added] in s 23(4) are read to
include the registration of _an assignment of a trade mark_ , it would mean
that a subsequent transaction involving a registered trade mark would be
equally subject to all the provisions of the current TMA which apply to the
original registration of trade marks. Consequently, _inter alia_ , the
Registrar of Trade Marks would have to undertake the procedure set out in ss
12 and 13 of the current TMA whenever there is an application to register a
subsequent transaction involving a registered trade mark, which would include
searching for earlier trade marks (see s 12(2)) and publishing for opposition
purposes the application for registration (see s 13(1)). This certainly could
not have been the intention of the Legislature as it would mean that the
Registrar of Trade Marks would have to repeat the work done previously _vis-à-
vis_ the original registration of a trade mark each time someone seeks to
register a subsequent assignment or transaction involving that trade mark.

130 Thus, it is our opinion that the Plaintiff’s case on fraud and/or
misrepresentation is not within the scope of the proceedings. In the premises,
the issue of whether there was fraud and/or misrepresentation in the
registration of the two assignments concerned is rendered moot. For the sake
of completeness, however, we will nevertheless express our views on this
issue.

(3) The Plaintiff’s case on fraud and/or misrepresentation

131 The Plaintiff’s case for alleging fraud and/or misrepresentation against
the First Defendant is as follows (see [56] of the Judgment):

The Plaintiff’s complaints were:

(a) The [F]irst [D]efendant … had informed the Registrar of Trade Marks of an
assignment of the [China Mark] from Qinghai Meheco on 10 February 1999, before
the [F]irst [D]efendant was incorporated.

(b) The [F]irst [D]efendant … did not inform the Registrar of Trade Marks that
the 10 February 1999 assignment was superseded by another assignment of 14
August 2000, after the [F]irst [D]efendant was incorporated.

(c) The [F]irst [D]efendant … misrepresented to the Registrar of Trade Marks
that under a joint acquisition agreement dated 30 March 2001 … between Qinghai
Meheco and the [F]irst [D]efendant and Qinghai Yixin, the [Opposed Mark] was
transferred from Qinghai Meheco to the [F]irst [D]efendant and Qinghai Yixin,
when the trade mark was not amongst the assets identified to be transferred.

132 Turning to the first two complaints enumerated above (both of which relate
to the China Mark), while it is true that the First Defendant was officially
incorporated and lawfully received its company seal and business licence only
after the assignment agreement of 10 February 1999 (“the February 1999
Assignment Agreement”) was entered into and that the February 1999 Assignment
Agreement was superseded by the assignment agreement dated 14 August 2000
(“the August 2000 Assignment Agreement”), we are not able to discern any
intent on the part of the First Defendant to deceive the Registrar of Trade
Marks _vis-à-vis_ the registration in the PRC of Qinghai Meheco’s assignment
of the China Mark to the First Defendant. The August 2000 Assignment
Agreement, which superseded the February 1999 Assignment Agreement,
essentially reiterated the terms set out in the earlier agreement (_ie_ , the
February 1999 Assignment Agreement) and could therefore have been used in the
same manner to support the application by the First Defendant to register the
assignment of the China Mark to it. More likely than not, the First
Defendant’s failure to inform the Registrar of Trade Marks of the August 2000
Assignment Agreement was due to an oversight by the First Defendant or its
legal advisers, rather than fraud, as, upon its incorporation, the First
Defendant proceeded to affix its company stamp to the February 1999 Assignment
Agreement and ratified the terms stated therein.

133 As for the third complaint enumerated at [131] above (which relates to the
Opposed Mark), again, we are not able to find in favour of the Plaintiff. In
support of its case that it was entitled to apply for the Rooster Sign to be
registered as a trade mark in Singapore, the First Defendant adduced the civil
judgment of the Higher People’s Court of Qinghai Province dated 15 May
2001,[note: 32] which purportedly ordered the _entire property_ of Qinghai
Meheco to be transferred to the First Defendant and Qinghai Yixin in
accordance with the Joint Acquisition Agreement. The Joint Acquisition
Agreement was said to concern the joint acquisition by the First Defendant and
Qinghai Yixin of Qinghai Meheco, which had been declared insolvent on 18
September 2000. The First Defendant also adduced an order from the Qinghai
Supreme People’s Court dated 15 September 2003[note: 33] confirming that the
liquidation of Qinghai Meheco had been completed, which implied that all the
property of the company had been disposed of. The First Defendant further
referred to an explanatory statement issued by the Qinghai Economic Committee
and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of
Qinghai Provincial Government dated 10 January 2006[note: 34] (“the
Explanatory Statement”), which confirmed that the _entire property_ of Qinghai
Meheco, _including the Opposed Mark_ , had been transferred to the First
Defendant and Qinghai Yixin.

134 During the hearing in the court below, lawyers from the PRC were called to
give evidence on the state, the effect and the operation of the PRC’s
corporate and insolvency laws _vis-à-vis_ whether the rights in the Opposed
Mark had in fact been assigned to the First Defendant and Qinghai Yixin along
with the other assets of Qinghai Meheco, as well as evidence on the effect of
the Explanatory Statement. However, neither the lawyers called by the
Plaintiff nor the lawyers called by the First Defendant were particularly
convincing. The most cogent piece of evidence remained, in our view, the
Explanatory Statement. The Plaintiff’s lead counsel, Mr Tan, submitted that
the significance of the Explanatory Statement should not be great as the
statement had been issued by a governmental authority as opposed to a judicial
authority and, thus, no one would know what the legal basis of the statement
was. However, _prima facie_ , the Explanatory Statement is the most cogent
piece of evidence available. Besides, the First Defendant having produced such
evidence, the evidential burden reverted to the Plaintiff. It was for the
Plaintiff to go to the PRC and seek evidence to show that the Explanatory
Statement should be given little credence as it had not been issued by a
court.

135 For the above reasons, in our view, even if the Plaintiff’s complaint of
fraud and/or misrepresentation is within the scope of s 23(4) of the current
TMA, the Plaintiff has not discharged its burden of establishing the presence
of fraud and/or misrepresentation.

_Our decision on invalidation_

136 In the light of the foregoing, it is our opinion that the Plaintiff has
not established its case for invalidating the registration of the Opposed Mark
for the following reasons. First, the ground for invalidation founded on s
23(1) read with s 7(1)(_d_) of the current TMA (_viz_ , the impugned mark has
become “customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established
practices of the trade” (_per_ s 7(1)(_d_)) has not been made out as the
available evidence shows that the Opposed Mark cannot be regarded as having
become customary within the meaning of s 7(1)(_d_). Second, the ground for
invalidation founded on s 23(1) read with s 7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA
(_viz_ , the impugned mark “[does] not satisfy the definition of a trade mark
in section 2(1)” (_per_ s 7(1)(_a_)) has not been made out as the Opposed Mark
is clearly capable of distinguishing the First Defendant’s cordyceps from
other traders’ cordyceps and thus satisfies the statutory definition of a
“trade mark”. Third, the ground for invalidation founded on s 23(1) read with
s 7(6) of the current TMA (_viz_ , the application for registration of the
impugned mark was made in bad faith) has not been made out as, on the evidence
available, the Plaintiff has not discharged its burden of establishing that
the application to register the Opposed Mark was made in bad faith. Fourth,
the ground for invalidation founded on s 23(4) of the current TMA (_viz_ , the
presence of fraud and/or misrepresentation in the registration of the trade
mark concerned) is not relevant as the Plaintiff’s complaint relates to the
registration of subsequent assignments of the Opposed Mark and not the
original registration of that mark. Moreover, even if s 23(4) does apply, the
evidence adduced in the court below is not sufficient for the Plaintiff to
discharge its burden of establishing fraud and/or misrepresentation.

**_Whether the court has a residual discretion not to grant relief where the
grounds for revocation and/or invalidation have been made out_**

137 Following from our decision above, it is quite unnecessary for us to
consider whether the court has a residual discretion to refuse relief if the
grounds for revocation and/or the grounds for invalidation under ss 22 and 23
respectively of the current TMA have been established. The Judge seemed to
think that the court had such a discretion because of the use of the word
“may” in both ss 22(1) and 23(1). For completeness, we will discuss this point
in a general way and proffer our preliminary views on the matter, bearing in
mind that no final appellate court has, as yet, considered this issue. The
House of Lords had the chance to do so in _Scandecor Development AB v
Scandecor Marketing AB_ [2002] FSR 7 with regard to the English equivalent of
our s 22 (_viz_ , s 46 of the English Trade Marks Act), but chose to refer the
issue to the ECJ. The case was eventually settled before the ECJ delivered its
opinion.

_The position under the 1992 TMA_

138 Under the previous trade mark legislation regime (_ie_ , the 1992 TMA), it
was clear that the power to revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade
mark was discretionary. The power to make rectifications to the trade mark
register was governed by s 39(1) of the 1992 TMA, which provided that:

**39.** —(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act —

(_a_) the court _may_ on the application in the prescribed manner of any
person aggrieved by the non-insertion in or [the] omission from the register
of any entry, or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause,
or by any entry wrongfully remaining on the register, or by any error or
defect in any entry in the register, make such order for making, expunging or
varying the entry _as it thinks fit_ ;

(_b_) the court may in any proceeding under this section decide any question
that … may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the
rectification of the register;

(_c_) in case of fraud in the registration, assignment or transmission of a
registered trade mark the Registrar may himself apply to the court under this
section …

[emphasis added]

139 It was held in three local cases that the power to rectify the trade marks
register pursuant to s 39 of the 1992 TMA (or the then applicable statutory
equivalent) was discretionary. In _Davidoff Extension SA v Davidoff Commercio
E Industria Ltda_ [1987] SLR 462, F A Chua J held _vis-à-vis_ s 39 of the
Trade Marks Act (Cap 206, 1970 Rev Ed) (the then equivalent of s 39 of the
1992 TMA) that “[i]t [was] clear from the authorities that the court always
ha[d] a discretion under s 39 [whether] to rectify or not in the light of all
the circumstances of the case” (at 466, [36]). In a similar vein, in _Re
Jaguar Trademark_ [1993] 2 SLR 466, Lai Siu Chiu JC affirmed that “under s 39
of the [1992 TMA], the court ha[d] the discretion whether or not to rectify
the register” (at 477, [15]). Finally, in _Super Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v
Unico Trading Pte Ltd_ [2000] 3 SLR 145, this court stated that “[i]t [seem]ed
… that by the use of the terms such as ‘may’ and ‘as it thinks fit’ in s
39(1)(a) [of the 1992 TMA], the court ha[d] a discretion in the matter” (at
[82]).

_The position under the current TMA_

140 The 1992 TMA was repealed in 1998 by the 1998 TMA (see s 109 of the latter
Act). The new legislation did away with s 39 of the 1992 TMA and enacted what
would later substantially become ss 22 and 23 of the current TMA (see ss 22
and 23 of the 1998 TMA). The first subsections of the current version of these
two provisions, _ie_ , ss 22(1) and 23(1) of the current TMA, state that the
court “may” (respectively) revoke and invalidate the registration of a trade
mark, but do not contain the phrase “as it thinks fit”, which previously
appeared in s 39(1)(_a_) of the 1992 TMA (see [138] above); hence, the
uncertainty as to whether the court still has at present a residual discretion
not to grant relief even though the grounds for either revocation or
invalidation have been made out. _Prima facie_ , of course, the inclusion of
the word “may” suggests that the court still has this discretion. Be that as
it may, the question of whether or not there is indeed such a residual
discretion on the part of the Registrar of Trade Marks and the court is a
matter of statutory interpretation as the word “may”, in some instances, can
also be regarded as creating an _obligation_. In analysing this issue, we will
begin by considering _Parliament’s intention_ , which is “ _generally …_
_decisive_ in any matter concerning statutory interpretation” [emphasis added]
(_per_ Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA in _Seiko Epson Corporation v Sepoms
Technology Pte Ltd_ [2008] 1 SLR 269 at [43]).

(1) Parliament’s intention

141 The long title of the current TMA describes the Act as:

[a]n Act to establish a new law for trade marks, to enable Singapore to give
effect to _certain international conventions on intellectual property_ and for
matters connected therewith. [emphasis added]

This aim was reflected in the speech by the Minister of State for Law, Assoc
Prof Ho Peng Kee, at the second reading of the Trade Marks Bill (Bill 42 of
1998), which was later enacted as the 1998 TMA, where he stated (see
_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (26 November 1998) vol 69
at col 1698):

This Bill … will replace the existing Trade Marks Act [_ie_ , the 1992 TMA].
Besides amending the law to comply with the [Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights], _the Bill also modernises and
simplifies our trade marks law in line with international trends_. [emphasis
added]

From what Assoc Prof Ho stated, it is clear that the 1998 TMA was meant to
give effect to trends in modern trade mark legislation. This is likewise the
objective of the current TMA, as evidenced by its many references to other
trade mark legislative regimes, namely, the English Trade Marks Act, the
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (commonly
known as “TRIPS”), and the (Australian) Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth).

142 Sections 22 and 23 of the current TMA are based on ss 46 and 47 of the
English Trade Marks Act, which read as follows:

**Revocation of registration.**

**46.** —(1) The registration of a trade mark _may_ be revoked on any of the
following grounds —

(a) that within the period of five years following the date of completion of
the registration procedure it has not been put to genuine use in the United
Kingdom, by the proprietor or with his consent, in relation to the goods or
services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-
use;

(b) that such use has been suspended for an uninterrupted period of five
years, and there are no proper reasons for non-use;

(c) that, in consequence of [the] acts or [the] inactivity of the proprietor,
it has become the common name in the trade for a product or service for which
it is registered;

(d) that in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor or with his
consent in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, it is
liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or
geographical origin of those goods or services.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) use of a trade mark includes use in a
form differing in elements which do not alter the distinctive character of the
mark in the form in which it was registered, and use in the United Kingdom
includes affixing the trade mark to goods or to the packaging of goods in the
United Kingdom solely for export purposes.

(3) The registration of a trade mark shall not be revoked on the ground
mentioned in subsection (1)(a) or (b) if such use as is referred to in that
paragraph is commenced or resumed after the expiry of the five year period and
before the application for revocation is made:

Provided that, any such commencement or resumption of use after the expiry of
the five year period but within the period of three months before the making
of the application shall be disregarded unless preparations for the
commencement or resumption began before the proprietor became aware that the
application might be made.

(4) An application for revocation may be made by any person, and may be made
either to the registrar [_ie_ , the Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs
and Trade Marks (_per_ s 62 of the English Trade Marks Act)] or to the court,
except that —

(a) if proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending in the
court, the application must be made to the court; and

(b) if in any other case the application is made to the registrar, he may at
any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the court.

(5) Where grounds for revocation exist in respect of only some of the goods or
services for which the trade mark is registered, revocation shall relate to
those goods or services only.

(6) Where the registration of a trade mark is revoked to any extent, the
rights of the proprietor shall be deemed to have ceased to that extent as from
—

(a) the date of the application for revocation, or

(b) if the registrar or [the] court is satisfied that the grounds for
revocation existed at an earlier date, that date.

**Grounds for invalidity of registration.**

**47.** —(1) The registration of a trade mark _may_ be declared invalid on the
ground that the trade mark was registered in breach of section 3 [_viz_ , the
English equivalent of s 7 of the current TMA] or any of the provisions
referred to in that section (absolute grounds for refusal of registration).

Where the trade mark was registered in breach of subsection (1)(b), (c) or (d)
of that section, it shall not be declared invalid if, in consequence of the
use which has been made of it, it has after registration acquired a
distinctive character in relation to the goods or services for which it is
registered.

(2) The registration of a trade mark _may_ be declared invalid on the ground —

(a) that there is an earlier trade mark in relation to which the conditions
set out in section 5(1), (2) or (3) [_viz_ , the English equivalent of ss
8(1), 8(2) and 8(4) respectively of the current TMA] obtain, or

(b) that there is an earlier right in relation to which the condition set out
in section 5(4) [_viz_ , the English equivalent of s 8(7) of the current TMA]
is satisfied,

unless the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier right has
consented to the registration.

(3) An application for a declaration of invalidity may be made by any person,
and may be made either to the registrar or to the court, except that —

(a) if proceedings concerning the trade mark in question are pending in the
court, the application must be made to the court; and

(b) if in any other case the application is made to the registrar, he may at
any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the court.

(4) In the case of bad faith in the registration of a trade mark, the
registrar himself may apply to the court for a declaration of the invalidity
of the registration.

(5) Where the grounds of invalidity exist in respect of only some of the goods
or services for which the trade mark is registered, the trade mark shall be
declared invalid as regards those goods or services only.

(6) Where the registration of a trade mark is declared invalid to any extent,
the registration shall to that extent be deemed never to have been made:

Provided that this shall not affect transactions past and closed.

[emphasis added]

143 These provisions (_ie_ , ss 46 and 47), which are found in Pt I of the
English Trade Marks Act, are themselves based on the European Trade Marks
Directive. As Viscount Goschen, in introducing the Bill which was later
enacted as the English Trade Marks Act (“the English Trade Marks Bill”),
stated in the House of Lords, that Bill was meant to (_inter alia_)
“[implement] Council Directive No. 89/104/EEC of 21st December 1988 to
approximate the laws of the member states relating to trademarks [_ie_ , the
European Trade Marks Directive]” (see United Kingdom, House of Lords,
_Parliamentary Debates_ (24 November 1993) vol 550 at col 262). Similarly,
Lord Strathclyde, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Department of
Trade and Industry), in his speech at the second reading of the English Trade
Marks Bill, stated (see United Kingdom, House of Lords, _Parliamentary
Debates_ (6 December 1993) vol 550 at cols 749–750):

The cornerstone of the Bill is an EC directive, No. 89/104, to approximate the
laws of the member states relating to trade marks [_ie_ , the European Trade
Marks Directive]. It forms the basis of the substantive provisions in Part I
of the Bill.

144 Section 46 and s 47 (read with s 3) of the English Trade Marks Act are, in
particular, based on Art 12 and Art 3 respectively of the European Trade Marks
Directive. Article 12 (which, as just mentioned, corresponds to s 46 of the
English Trade Marks Act) reads as follows:

_Article 12_**  
Grounds for revocation**

1\. A trade mark _shall_ be liable to revocation if, within a continuous
period of five years, it has not been put to genuine use in the Member State
in connection with the goods or … services in respect of which it is
registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use; however, no person
may claim that the proprietor’s rights in a trade mark should be revoked
where, during the interval between expiry of the five-year period and filing
of the application for revocation, genuine use of the trade mark has been
started or resumed; the commencement or resumption of use within a period of
three months preceding the filing of the application for revocation which
began at the earliest on expiry of the continuous period of five years of non-
use, shall, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or
resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the application
for revocation may be filed.

2\. A trade mark _shall_ also be liable to revocation if, after the date on
which it was registered,

(a) in consequence of [the] acts or [the] inactivity of the proprietor, it has
become the common name in the trade for a product or service in respect of
which it is registered;

(b) in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor of the trade mark
or with his consent in respect of the goods or services [for] which it is
registered, it is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature,
quality or geographical origin of those goods or services.

[emphasis added]

As for Article 3 (which corresponds to s 47 read with s 3 of the English Trade
Marks Act), it states:

_Article 3_**  
Grounds for refusal or invalidity**

1\. The following _shall_ _not_ be registered or if registered _shall_ be
liable to be declared invalid:

(a) signs which cannot constitute a trade mark;

(b) trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character;

(c) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may
serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose,
value, geographical origin, or the time of production of the goods or of
rendering of the service, or other characteristics of the goods or service;

(d) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have
become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established
practices of the trade;

(e) signs which consist exclusively of:

\- the shape which results from the nature of the goods themselves, or

\-  the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result, or

\-  the shape which gives substantial value to the goods;

(f) trade marks which are contrary to public policy or to accepted principles
of morality;

(g) trade marks which are of such a nature as to deceive the public, for
instance as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of the goods or
service;

(h) trade marks which have not been authorized by the competent authorities
and are to be refused or invalidated pursuant to Article 6 _ter_ of the Paris
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, hereinafter referred to
as the ‘Paris Convention’.

2\. Any Member State may provide that a trade mark _shall_ _not_ be registered
or, if registered, _shall_ be liable to be declared invalid where and to the
extent that:

(a) the use of that trade mark may be prohibited pursuant to provisions of law
other than [the] trade mark law of the Member State concerned or of the
[European] Community;

(b) the trade mark covers a sign of high symbolic value, in particular a
religious symbol;

(c) the trade mark includes badges, emblems and escutcheons other than those
covered by Article 6 _ter_ of the Paris Convention and which are of [p]ublic
interest, unless the consent of the appropriate authorities to its
registration has been given in conformity with the legislation of the Member
State;

(d) the application for registration of the trade mark was made in bad faith
by the applicant.

3\. A trade mark shall not be refused registration or be declared invalid in
accordance with paragraph 1(b), (c) or (d) if, before the date of application
for registration and following the use which has been made of it, it has
acquired a distinctive character. Any Member State may in addition provide
that this provision shall also apply where the distinctive character was
acquired after the date of application for registration or after the date of
registration.

4\. Any Member State may provide that, by derogation from the preceding
paragraphs, the grounds of refusal of registration or invalidity in force in
that State prior to the date on which the provisions necessary to comply with
this Directive enter into force, shall apply to trade marks for which
application [for registration] has been made prior to that date.

[emphasis added]

145 The use of the word “shall” in Arts 12 and 3 of the European Trade Marks
Directive _prima facie_ indicates a regime of _compulsory_ revocation or
invalidation with _no residual discretion_ when the grounds for revocation or
the grounds for invalidation are made out. This is likely to be the correct
interpretation for, as stated in Morcom _et al_ ([52] _supra_) at para 7.3:

[T]he idea of some kind of residual discretion … not to do what the law
appears to be saying should be done … is more a creature of common law
jurisdictions and is not a concept that is readily understood [on] the other
side of the English Channel.

Since Art 12 and Art 3 of the European Trade Marks Directive form the basis
of, respectively, s 46 and s 47 (read with s 3) of the English Trade Marks
Act, and since ss 46 and 47 of the English Trade Marks Act in turn form the
basis of ss 22 and 23 respectively of the current TMA, _ex hypothesi_ , it
follows that the operation of Art 12 and Art 3 of the European Trade Marks
Directive would be _prima facie_ indicative of Parliament’s intention _vis-à-
vis_ , respectively, s 22 and s 23 (read with s 7) of the current TMA. Given
the absence of any contradictory material in the records of our local
parliamentary debates, it may be inferred that Parliament’s intention is that
there is to be _no_ residual discretion for the Registrar of Trade Marks and
the court not to grant relief where the grounds for revocation or the grounds
for invalidation have been established.

(2) Case law

146 Turning to the case law, as mentioned earlier (at [137] above), there has
to date been no authoritative ruling on the question of whether there is a
residual discretion not to revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade
mark under either ss 46 and 47 of the English Trade Marks Act or Arts 12 and 3
of the European Trade Marks Directive where the requisite conditions are met.
There have, however, been several decisions on these provisions in the lower
courts which support a finding that there is no such residual discretion (see,
_inter alia_ , _ZIPPO Trade Mark_ [1999] RPC 173 at 184 and _Cabañas Habana
(Device) Trade Mark_ [2000] RPC 26 at 34).

147 The most frequently cited case for the proposition that there is no
residual discretion would be _Premier Brands UK Ltd v Typhoon Europe Ltd_
[2000] FSR 767 (“ _Premier Brands_ ”). In that case, Neuberger J held (at
811):

[I]t does seem to me somewhat odd if the legislature has specifically provided
[via ss 46(1)(a) and 46(1)(b) of the English Trade Marks Act] for no
revocation in the event of there being good reason for the non-use, but
nonetheless has left the Court with a residual discretion, particularly
without giving any indication as to what factors should be taken into account
when exercising that discretion. Further, consideration of the combined effect
of section 46(1)(c) and (d) [which correspond to ss 22(1)(_c_) and 22(1)(_d_)
respectively of the current TMA] suggest[s] to me that it is more likely that
the legislature intended that those two paragraphs were to represent
mandatory, rather than discretionary, grounds for revocation. Section 46(5)
[of the English Trade Marks Act] and Article 13 [of the European Trade Marks
Directive] tend to point in favour of the conclusion I have reached [both s
46(5) of the English Trade Marks Act and Art 13 of the European Trade Marks
Directive are _in pari materia_ with s 22(6) of the current TMA]. The words
“may” in section 46(1) and “liable” in Article 12 [both of which correspond to
s 22(1) of the current TMA] are perfectly consistent with the concept of
revocation being mandatory but only occurring in the event of an application
being made.

148  Locally, _Premier Brands_ has been applied by the High Court in _Reemtsma
Cigarettenfabriken GmbH v Hugo Boss AG (No 2)_ [2003] 4 SLR 155 (“ _Hugo Boss_
”). The registered trade marks in that case were “BOSS” in respect of
cigarettes and “HUGO BOSS” in respect of cigarettes, cigars, tobacco for
cigarettes, pipe tobacco, lighters and matches. Those marks were registered by
the defendant (“Hugo Boss”), which was in the business of the design,
manufacture and sale of high fashion menswear and other luxury goods. The
application for revocation was made by the plaintiff, Reemtsma
Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, which was in the business of the manufacture and sale
of cigarettes. The High Court was satisfied that there had been no genuine use
of the “BOSS” and the “HUGO BOSS” marks during the relevant period. Hugo Boss
argued that the use of the word “may” in s 22(1) of the 1999 TMA, which is _in
pari materia_ with s 22(1) of the current TMA, conferred on the court a
residual discretion to allow the disputed marks to remain on the register.
Belinda Ang Saw Ean J (“Belinda Ang J”) referred to _Premier Brands_ and held
(at [30] of _Hugo Boss_):

[T]he court (or [the] Registrar) _does not_ have a discretion under s 22 to
maintain a mark on the register when grounds for revocation have been
established, whether in relation to all, or some, of the goods for which [the
mark] is registered. Once the requirements are satisfied, the court (or [the]
Registrar) is _obliged_ to exercise the power one way. [emphasis added]

149 Belinda Ang J explained her reasons for the above conclusion as follows
(_id_ at [31]):

There are significant pointers in favour of “may” meaning that, if any of the
grounds specified in … sub-s (1) [of s 22] are satisfied, the power must be
exercised one way. They are:

(a) In this case, the statutory power conferred on the court (or [the]
Registrar) is exhaustive in that registration may be revoked [under] no other
than [the] four specific grounds for revocation.

(b) Subsection (3) [of s 22] expressly covers the situation where there is no
power to revoke even if sub-s (1)(a) or (b) [of s 22] is satisfied. It amounts
to an exhaustive statement of the position so far as relevant. _There is thus
no room for discretion to operate._

(c) There is no “sweeping up” clause to accommodate other grounds.

(d) Subsection (7) [which corresponds to s 22(6) of the current TMA] is
consistent with the absence of discretion. Once the grounds are established in
respect of some goods and not the rest, partial revocation is to be ordered.

[emphasis added]

150 We note that the Judge did not think that the above points were
persuasive. He made the following responses in answer to these four points
(see [67] of the Judgment). First, the fact that there were four specific and
exhaustive grounds for revocation in s 22(1) of the current TMA was not
inconsistent with there being a discretion as to whether or not to revoke the
registration of a trade mark where any of those grounds was established; it
merely meant that in the absence of any of those four grounds, there was no
power of revocation. Second, with regard to the exception to liability to
revocation specified in s 22(3) of the current TMA, that provision did not
necessarily imply that where liability to revocation existed, there was no
discretion in the exercise of the power to revoke. Third, the fact that there
was no “sweeping up” clause _vis-à-vis_ revocation could not thereby mean that
there was no discretion not to revoke the registration of a trade mark where
any of the four specified grounds was made out. Fourth, s 22(7) of the current
TMA related to the consequences of revocation and not to whether there was a
discretion not to revoke. (Parenthetically, we would observe that while the
Judge referred to s 22(7) of the _current_ TMA at [67] of the Judgment, what
Belinda Ang J referred to at sub-para (d) of [31] of _Hugo Boss_ was actually
s 22(7) of the _1999_ TMA. Section 22(7) of the current TMA is _not_ the
present equivalent of s 22(7) of the 1999 TMA; instead, it is s 22(6) of the
current TMA which corresponds to s 22(7) of the 1999 TMA.)

151 In contrast, in _Nation Fittings_ ([96] _supra_) and _Warman_ ([37]
_supra_), Phang J and Rajah JA respectively referred to both _Premier Brands_
([147] _supra_) and _Hugo Boss_ ([148] _supra_) in coming to the conclusion
that the court and the Registrar of Trade Marks did not have any discretion
under s 22(1) of the current TMA to maintain a mark on the register of trade
marks when one or more of the specified grounds for revocation had been
established.

152 While the above cases (_ie_ , the cases discussed at [147]–[151] above)
relate to _revocation_ of the registration of a trade mark, there is no reason
why the views set out therein on the lack of any discretion not to revoke
where the requisite grounds for revocation have been established cannot be
applied to _invalidation_ of the registration of a trade mark. Sections 22 and
23 of the current TMA are somewhat similar in their effect – both operate to
cause the registration of a trade mark to be removed. The only significant
difference between the two provisions is that the latter (_ie_ , s 23) voids a
trade mark _ab initio_ while the former (_ie_ , s 22) does not. As
Bainbridge’s _Intellectual Property_ ([53] _supra_) states (at p 648):

Revocation must be distinguished from invalidity. Revocation is a means of
removing a trade mark from the register because of the presence of one or more
of the above grounds [_ie_ , the grounds set out in Art 12 of the European
Trade Marks Directive and s 46 of the English Trade Marks Act]. The impact of
revocation is that it brings to an end the rights of the proprietor from the
date of the application for revocation (or earlier, if the grounds existed at
an earlier date). A trade mark may be declared invalid if any of the absolute
or relative grounds for refusal of registration are found to exist, in which
case the trade mark will be removed from the register on the basis that it
should never have been registered. The outcome is different [as compared] to
revocation because, with invalidity, it is as if the trade mark never existed.

153 In _Hormel_ ([51] _supra_), an invalidly-registered trade mark was
described as one which “should _never have been registered_ for whatever
reason, and [which] _has wrongly remained on the Register ever since_ ”
[emphasis added] (at [97]). Logically, all the more, no discretion should
subsist with respect to the removal of the registration of such a mark (_ie_ ,
a mark which meets the criteria for its registration as a trade mark to be
invalidated).

(3) Academic works

154 Standard academic works on intellectual property law likewise support the
view that there is no residual discretion in the court and the Registrar of
Trade Marks not to revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade mark where
grounds for the same have been established. In Morcom _et al_ ([52] _supra_),
it is observed (at para 7.5) that “the better view seems to be that of
Neuberger J in [_Premier Brands_], that there is no residual discretion given
to the registrar or the court”. The learned authors of _Kerly’s_ ([52]
_supra_) similarly state that there is no residual discretion available (at
paras 10-021–10-022):

10-021 Both subss. (1) and (2) of s. 47 of the [English Trade Marks Act]
provide that: “The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid ...”.
Equally s. 46(1) [of the English Trade Marks Act] provides [that] “The
registration of a trade mark may be revoked on any of the following grounds
...”. Prior to the last edition [of _Kerly’s_], the use of the word “may” in
s. 46(1) gave rise to debate over whether that word provided a residual
discretion not to revoke even though one of the grounds of invalidity or
revocation ha[d] been made out. The debate arose particularly in cases of non-
use, probably because the equivalent non-use provisions in the [Trade Marks
Act 1938 (c 22) (UK)] did contain a residual discretion.

10-022 There is no residual discretion in proceedings for invalidity or
revocation. With the benefit of hindsight, it is perhaps surprising that this
was considered a serious issue. The fact that it was demonstrates how
difficult it can be to break free of years of conditioning [in] the old law.

155 Support for the same view (_viz_ , that there is no discretion not to
revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade mark where the requisite
grounds for granting relief have been satisfied) can be found in _Halsbury’s
Laws of England_ vol 48 ([86] _supra_), where it is stated (at para 111):

**Absence of discretion.** By contrast with the position under the Trade Marks
Act 1938 [(c 22) (UK)], if an applicant for revocation of a trade mark (or, it
would seem, for a declaration of invalidity or for rectification) establishes
that there are grounds for revocation (or invalidity or rectification) of the
mark in whole or in part, the registrar or the court has no discretion to
refuse the order sought even though the relevant statutory provisions use the
word ‘may’.

156 The learned author of Tan’s _Law of Trade Marks_ ([54] _supra_) likewise
states (at para 7.22):

In the first edition of this book, it was submitted that this reasoning [_ie_
, the reasoning of Neuberger J in _Premier Brands_ ([147] _supra_)] should
also be adopted for sections 22(1) and 23(1) of the 1998 [TMA]. It pointed to
the oddity of the fact that the Act specifically provides for no revocation if
good reasons are shown for non-use but nonetheless leaves the Registrar or the
court with residual discretion if there are no such reasons. If indeed there
is a discretion, there should have been some indications in the 1998 [TMA] as
to how the discretion is to be exercised. Further, the word ‘shall’ in section
22(7) indicates that the Registrar or the court has no discretion but must
revoke a mark in respect of the goods or services in relation to which the
mark was not used. It is curious that there should be a discretion (by virtue
of section 22(1)) as regards a mark which has not been used for any of the
goods or services in the specification but _no_ discretion at all where the
mark has not been used on only some of the goods or services. [emphasis in
original]

(4) Our preliminary opinion on whether there is a residual discretion not to
revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade mark

157  In our opinion, the correct interpretation of the word “may” in ss 22(1)
and 23(1) of the current TMA is that it _does not_ confer any residual
discretion on the part of the court and the Registrar of Trade Marks not to
revoke or invalidate the registration of a trade mark where the specified
grounds for revocation in s 22 or the specified grounds for invalidation in s
23 have been made out. This conclusion is further reinforced if one takes into
consideration the function of a trade mark. As Belinda Ang J stated in _Hugo
Boss_ ([148] _supra_) at [34] with reference to _“Philosophy di Alberta
Ferretti” Trade Mark_ [2003] RPC 15, _Imperial Group Ltd v Philip Morris & Co
Ltd_ [1982] FSR 72 and _Premier Brands_ ([147] _supra_):

[S]ince the function of a trade mark is to give a proprietor a monopoly when
his trade mark is used, there should be no discretion to retain the mark if
the grounds [for revocation or invalidation, as the case may be] are
established.

158 We would add that if our opinion is incorrect (_ie_ , if there is indeed a
residual discretion not to grant relief where the grounds set out in s 22 or s
23 have been made out), the Judge took the correct approach in deciding how
his discretion should be exercised, although (as we stated earlier at [101]
above) he erred in finding that the ground for invalidation set out in s
7(1)(_a_) of the current TMA had been satisfied. In coming to his conclusion
that the registration of the Opposed Mark should not be invalidated, the Judge
took all the relevant facts and circumstances into account. He stated (at
[85]–[86] of the Judgment):

85 At the present, the “Rooster” mark [_ie_ , the Rooster Sign] is being used
only by the [First Defendant and the Second Defendant] as the other users had
ceased using the mark after it was registered in Singapore [as the Opposed
Mark], so there is no confusion or deception arising from the [First
Defendant’s and the Second Defendant’s] use of the mark. There is the
allegation that the [Opposed Mark] is being used by unauthorised parties. The
remedy to such improper use is enforcement proceedings such as [those which]
the [First Defendant and the Second Defendant] have commenced, and not the
removal of the mark itself. In this respect, the [First Defendant and the
Second Defendant] in taking action to promote the [Opposed Mark] and protect
it from infringement are exercising their existing legal rights. The
[P]laintiff, on the other hand, has no interest in the mark. It does not claim
ownership of the mark. Its case was that because the mark should not have been
registered, the registration should be set aside now, and conditions [should]
be allowed to revert to the pre-registration state when the same mark [_ie_ ,
the Rooster Sign] was used for all Chinese cordyceps.

86 I find, on reviewing the facts and balancing the different interests, that
the status quo should be maintained, and the registration of the [Opposed
Mark] should be continued.

Incidentally, the above approach (_ie_ , considering all the relevant facts
and circumstances of the case concerned) appears to be the approach adopted by
Neuberger J in _Premier Brands_ , who set out his views (at 812–813) on how he
would have exercised his discretion under s 46 of the English Trade Marks Act
if that provision did indeed give the court a discretion not to revoke the
registration of a trade mark even though the specified grounds for revocation
had been made out.

**_Our decision on revocation and invalidation of the registration of the
Opposed Mark_**

159 To recapitulate, we hold that the registration of the Opposed Mark should
not be revoked or invalidated because the Plaintiff has failed to establish
any of the specified grounds for either revocation or invalidation.

**The declaratory order sought by the Plaintiff**

160 As mentioned at [4] above, other than applying to revoke and/or invalidate
the registration of the Opposed Mark, the Plaintiff also sought a declaratory
order (_ie_ , the Declaration) via Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons (see
[11] above).

161 The Judge granted the Declaration, but restricted it to the First
Defendant. The First Defendant has appealed (via the Cross-Appeal) against
this aspect of the Judge’s decision on the grounds that the Judge should not
have granted the Declaration and that the Plaintiff has not discharged the
requisite legal and evidential burden to justify the grant of the Declaration.

**_The Plaintiff’s preliminary point:_ Res judicata**

162 The Plaintiff, in its submissions to this court, contends as a preliminary
point that the First Defendant should not be allowed to appeal against the
Judge’s decision to grant the Declaration. This is because the issue of
whether the court should grant the Declaration had already been determined
when the Judge refused the application of the First Defendant in the Summons
to have (_inter alia_) Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons struck out (see
[13] above). Since this issue was decided by the Judge in the Summons and
since there was no appeal against that decision, the issue is, according to
the Plaintiff, _res judicata_.

163 In this regard, it may be useful to recall the pertinent facts. On 27 June
2007, a few days before the hearing of the Originating Summons (which was
scheduled to start on 2 July 2007), the First Defendant filed the Summons to,
_inter alia_ , strike out Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons (_ie_ , the
prayer for the Declaration). The basis of the First Defendant’s striking-out
application was that the issues relating to Prayer 3 should not be adjudicated
by the Judge because:

(a) those issues were substantive issues which had to be proved during the
hearing of the Private Summonses;

(b) those issues involved disputes of fact which were best dealt with at a
trial; and

(c) it would be an abuse of process if those issues were heard twice at first
instance (_viz_ , first at the hearing of the Originating Summons, and again
at the hearing of the Private Summonses).

164 The Summons was dealt with on 2 July 2007, the first day of the hearing of
the Originating Summons. The First Defendant’s arguments in support of the
Summons were, in essence, as follows:

(a) By seeking the Declaration via Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons, the
Plaintiff was effectively seeking to usurp the jurisdiction of the court which
was to hear the criminal proceedings arising from the Private Summonses. The
institution of the Originating Summons for an adjudication on a question which
was substantially the same as that already pending before another court in
another set of proceedings between the same parties (_viz_ , the Private
Summonses) was grossly vexatious.

(b) A declaration ought not to be granted by the court in a civil action
(referred to in this part of our judgment as a “civil court”) concerning a
matter which formed the subject of a criminal charge brought against a party
to that civil action as the making of any declaration would usurp the function
of the court hearing the criminal action (referred to in this part of our
judgment as the “criminal court”) without binding it and would prejudice the
criminal trial.

165 The doctrine of _res judicata_ encompasses cause of action estoppel, issue
estoppel and (where the extended form of the doctrine is concerned) abuse of
process. Issue estoppel, in particular, is the doctrine which prevents re-
litigation of an issue which the court has already determined on the merits in
previous proceedings between the same parties (see _Blair v Curran_ (1939) 62
CLR 464 at 531–532). In _Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation
of Grange Heights Strata Title No 301 (No 2)_ [2005] 3 SLR 157 (“ _Lee Tat
(2005)_ ”), this court held that the following requirements had to be met in
order to establish issue estoppel (at [14]–[15]):

(a) there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits of the issue
which is said to be the subject of an estoppel;

(b) that judgment must be by a court of competent jurisdiction;

(c) the parties in the two actions that are being compared must be identical;
and

(d) there must be identity of subject matter in those two actions.

We should add that some aspects of the merits of the decision in _Lee Tat
(2005)_ were reviewed in the recent judgment of this court in _Lee Tat
Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301_ [2008]
SGCA 47 (“ _Lee Tat (2008)_ ”). However, nothing decided in _Lee Tat (2008)_
affects the principles on issue estoppel enunciated in _Lee Tat (2005)_ at
[14]–[15], which we have just set out in this paragraph.

166 In the present case, it is clear that there has been a judgment on the
merits which is final and conclusive as far as the question of striking out
Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons is concerned. It is also clear that that
decision was given by a court of competent jurisdiction and that the parties
in the two actions being compared (_viz_ , the Summons and the Cross-Appeal)
are identical. The only requirement in issue for the purposes of the doctrine
of _res judicata_ would be whether there is identity of subject matter in
those two proceedings.

167 Sundaresh Menon JC in _Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck_ [2007] 1 SLR 453 (“
_Goh Nellie_ ”) identified several “discrete conceptual strands” (at [34])
which encapsulate the requirement that the subject matter of the two actions
being compared must be identical. First, the issues in the two proceedings
must be identical in the sense that (_ibid_):

[T]he prior decision must traverse the same ground as [that in] the subsequent
proceeding and the facts and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision
must not have changed or should be incapable of change. Where this is not the
case, issue estoppel may not arise.

Second (see _Goh Nellie_ at [35]):

[T]he previous determination in question must have been fundamental and not
merely collateral to the previous decision so that the decision could not
stand without that determination …

Third, the issue which is said to be the subject of an estoppel “should be
shown in fact to have been raised and argued” (_id_ at [38]).

168 Turning to the first conceptual strand (_viz_ , the requirement that the
issues in the two actions being compared must be identical in the sense of
traversing the same ground), it would appear, _ex facie_ , that the issue in
the Summons and the issue in the Cross-Appeal are different. The Plaintiff
argues in its submissions to this court that the issue of whether the Judge
should consider Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons has already been fully
litigated and, thus, the First Defendant is estopped from raising the same
issue in the Cross-Appeal. This is clearly, with respect, a misconceived
argument. The First Defendant is _not_ arguing in the Cross-Appeal that the
Judge should not have considered Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons; rather,
the First Defendant is arguing that the Judge, after considering Prayer 3,
should not have granted the Declaration.

169  The correct approach to identify the issue which was decided in the
Summons is to ask, first, what was litigated and, second, what was decided
(see _Lee Tat (2005)_ ([165] _supra_) at [15]). What was litigated in the
Summons was a striking-out application, specifically, the First Defendant’s
application for (_inter alia_) Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons to be
struck out. What was decided was that Prayer 3 should not be struck out. In
this respect, the Judge stated the following to the First Defendant’s counsel,
Mr Ravindran, when dismissing the Summons:[note: 35]

COURT: |  Mr Ravindran I’m not going to hear you. We have spent exactly 90 minutes of a seven day trial with more witnesses than I think we can comfortably handle and I do not think there are any new matters you can raise. I will dismiss the application.  
---|---  
  
As no detailed reasons were provided by the Judge _vis-à-vis_ his decision to
dismiss the Summons, it can and should only be presumed that the Judge merely
ruled on the application to strike out Prayer 3 of the Originating Summons and
no more. There is no reason to assume, without more, that the Judge also made
a determination as to whether the court should grant the Declaration in view
of the pending criminal proceedings. Furthermore, on the face of the
transcript of the proceedings relating to the Summons, the Plaintiff does not
appear at any time to have asked the Judge to make a determination on the
grant of the Declaration in its favour. In this regard, Geoffrey Lane LJ’s
comments in _Turner v London Transport Executive_ [1977] ICR 952 are
pertinent. He stated (at 966):

A degree of caution should be exercised, perhaps, in the use of the concept of
issue estoppel …

… [A] case of issue estoppel cannot begin to be established unless it can be
ascertained with some degree of precision what it was that the dominant
judgment [_ie_ , the previous judgment which is relied on as the basis of the
estoppel] decided.

170  In the light of the foregoing, it is our opinion that there is no
identity of issue between the Summons and the Cross-Appeal (_ie_ , the
requirement of identity of subject matter has not been made out). Accordingly,
the doctrine of _res judicata_ does not apply and the First Defendant is
entitled to raise before us the question of whether the court should grant the
Declaration.

171 We would add that, in any case, any determination by the Judge as to
whether he should grant the Declaration in view of the pending criminal
proceedings would not have been fundamental (in the manner outlined at [35] of
_Goh Nellie_ ([167] _supra_)) to his decision to dismiss the Summons. The
Judge, in our view, must have been able to decide not to grant the First
Defendant’s striking-out application without making such a determination. This
is because the Judge could only have exercised his power to strike out Prayer
3 of the Originating Summons if the case for striking out had been “ _plain
and obvious_ ” (_per_ L P Thean JA in _The Osprey_ [2000] 1 SLR 281 at [6]).
This principle was stated in a host of earlier cases. For example, in _Tan Eng
Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd_ [1991] SLR 798, G P Selvam JC said (at 803,
[31]):

Courts are reluctant to strike out a claim summarily either under O 18 r 19 of
the [Rules of the Supreme Court 1970] or [under] the inherent jurisdiction.
This is anchored on the judicial policy to afford a litigant the right to
institute a bona fide claim before the courts and to prosecute it in the usual
way. Whenever possible, the courts will let the plaintiff proceed with the
action unless his case is wholly and clearly unarguable: see _Blue Town
Investments Ltd v Higgs & Hill plc_ [1990] 1 WLR 696; [1990] 2 All ER 897 and
_Oxy Electric Ltd v Zainuddin_ [1991] 1 WLR 115; [1990] 2 All ER 902.

172 Similarly, in _Ko Teck Siang v Low Fong Mei_ [1992] 1 SLR 454, this court
endorsed (at 459–460, [15]) the English Court of Appeal case of _Wenlock v
Moloney_ [1965] 1 WLR 1238, where Danckwerts LJ said (at 1243–1244):

The position [in relation to striking out] is very clearly expressed by Lord
Herschell in _Lawrance_ v. _Lord Norreys_ [(1890) 15 App Cas 210 at 219]. He
said: “It cannot be doubted that the court has an inherent jurisdiction to
dismiss an action which is an abuse of the process of the court. _It is a
jurisdiction which ought to be very sparingly exercised, and only in very
exceptional cases. I do not think its exercise would be justified merely
because the story told in the pleadings was highly improbable, and one which
it was difficult to believe could be proved_.” …

The position … has been incorporated in the present [Rules of the Supreme
Court (UK)], Ord. 18, r. 19. There is no doubt that the inherent power of the
court remains. But _this summary jurisdiction of the court was never intended
to be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and
facts of the case, in order to see whether the plaintiff really has a cause of
action. To do that is to usurp the position of the trial judge, and to produce
a trial of the case in chambers, on affidavits only, without discovery and
without oral evidence tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way_. This
seems to me to be an abuse of the inherent power of the court [to strike out a
claim] and not a proper exercise of that power.

[emphasis added]

173 This general rule relating to striking out was reiterated in the later
case of _Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin_ [1998] 1 SLR 374, where
this court held (at [18]):

In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of striking
out should be invoked. This was the view taken by Lindley MR in _Hubbuck &
Sons v Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark_ [1899] 1 QB 86 at p 91. It should not be
exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of
the case in order to see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The
practice of the courts has been that, where an application for striking out
involves a lengthy and serious argument, the court should decline to proceed
with the argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of
the pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate
the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial.

174 In the court below, the case for striking out Prayer 3 of the Originating
Summons would not have been plain and obvious if the Judge had had to delve
into the question of whether the court should grant the Declaration in view of
the pending criminal proceedings. Indeed, the Judge, in his comments in
dismissing the Summons (see [169] above), appears to have refrained from going
into further analysis of this particular point. Therefore, it seems to us
unlikely that the issue which the Plaintiff claims the Judge had ruled upon
was actually determined on its merits.

**_Whether the Judge was right to grant the Declaration_**

_The court’s power to grant declaratory orders_

175 __ The basis for the Declaration sought is that the copyright in the
Labels does not subsist in favour of the First Defendant and that the
Plaintiff has not infringed the said copyright. The _effect_ of the
Declaration, if it is granted, is that the Plaintiff would _not_ be guilty of
the charges under the Copyright Act which were brought against it via the
Private Summonses (see [10] above)_._ Indeed, on the first day of the hearing
in the High Court, the Plaintiff’s lead counsel, Mr Tan, stated:[note: 36]

During the application for [the] search warrant[s] the complainant [_ie_ , Yu
Ceng] failed to give full and frank disclosure of certain material facts and
documents concerning the [F]irst [D]efendant’s trade mark [_ie_ , the Opposed
Mark] and copyright ownership of the mark. This is one of the issues that will
be litigated in the [P]laintiff’s applications in the [Originating Summons]
and the [Criminal Revision]. _If the applications are granted it will have the
effect of dismissing the charges._ [emphasis added]

(1) The discretionary nature of the power

176 The court has the power to grant declarations upon any matter as long as,
in doing so, it does not exceed its general jurisdiction or contravene any
express statutory provision (see Lord Woolf & Jeremy Woolf, _The Declaratory
Judgment_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2002) at para 3.005). The power to make a
binding declaration is a discretionary power (see, _inter alia_ , _Russian
Commercial and Industrial Bank_ _v_ _British Bank for Foreign Trade, Limited_
[1921] 2 AC 438 (“ _Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank_ ”)). The court’s
jurisdiction to grant declarations is founded upon O 15 r 16 of the Rules of
Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), which states:

No action or other proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a
merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make
binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or
could be claimed.

177 The declaratory order has its roots in s 14 of the Court of Chancery Act
1850 (c 35) (UK) (now repealed), which was the first statute in England that
provided for declaratory relief. Discretion has always been a dominant feature
of the declaratory order. As explained in _The Declaratory Judgment_(at para
4.002):

[Section 14 of the Court of Chancery Act 1850] empowered the court to grant a
declaration upon a special case, but it added that “if upon the hearing of
such special case as aforesaid the court shall be of [the] opinion that the
questions raised thereby or any of them cannot properly be decided upon such
case, the said court may refuse to decide the same.” Subsequent statutes and
rules of court expressly or impliedly followed suit.

The learned authors of _The Declaratory Judgment_ quote (at para 4.003) Lord
Sterndale MR’s decision in _Hanson_ _v_ _Radcliffe Urban District Council_
[1922] 2 Ch 490, where his Lordship stated (at 507):

In my opinion … the power of the Court to make a declaration, where it is a
question of defining the rights of two parties, is almost unlimited; I might
say only limited by its own discretion. The discretion should of course be
exercised judicially, but it seems to me that the discretion is very wide.

178 The corollary of the court having such a wide discretionary power to grant
declaratory orders is, as the First Defendant has rightly submitted, that this
power should be exercised with great caution as it could otherwise easily be
abused. As _The Declaratory Judgment_ states (at para 4.015):

lf employed incautiously it [_ie_ , the court’s power to grant declaratory
orders] might encourage people unnecessarily to claim declarations of their
rights, involving unjustifiable, costly litigation and causing excessive
embarrassment to defendants. As Lord Sterndale  M.R., another strong supporter
of a broad scope for declaratory relief, admitted [in _Gray v Spyer_ [1922] 2
Ch 22 at 27]: “I agree that claims for declaration[s] should be carefully
watched. Properly used, they are very useful; improperly used, they almost
amount to a nuisance.”

179 Likewise, in _Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank_ ([176] _supra_),
where a declaration was sought in relation to the construction of a contract
between the parties, the court observed that the discretionary power should be
exercised “sparingly” (at 448), “with great care and jealousy” (_ibid_) and
“with extreme caution” (_ibid_).

(2) The exercise of the power

180 It appears to be well-established law that a civil court (as defined at
sub-para (b) of [164] above) has the jurisdiction to grant a declaration even
if it pertains to criminal proceedings. As Gibbs ACJ stated in _Sankey v
Whitlam_ (1978) 142 CLR 1 (“ _Sankey_ ”), “[i]t is clear enough that the power
of the court is not excluded [merely] because the matter as to which a
declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings” (at 20).

181  It appears to be equally well-established law that a civil court will, in
normal circumstances, be slow to grant a declaration relating to the criminal
consequences of conduct (see, _eg_ , the arguments of Mr Anthony Lester QC and
Mr Pushpinder Saini, acting as _amici curiae_ , in _Airedale NHS Trust v
Bland_ [1993] AC 789 at 854, citing the House of Lords’ decision in _Imperial
Tobacco Ltd v Attorney-General_ [1981] AC 718 (“ _Imperial Tobacco_ ”) at 718,
741–742, 746 and 750–752). The rule is not inflexible, however, and the court
may grant declaratory relief relating to the criminal consequences of conduct
in appropriate cases. The circumstances in which it will be appropriate for a
civil court to do so, however, are likely to be very rare and exceptional (see
P W Young, _Declaratory Orders_ (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1984) at p 152); for
instance, it must be shown that the criminal proceedings have not been
properly brought or are vexatious or constitute an abuse of process in that
the facts alleged do not in law prove the offence charged (see the arguments
of Mr Christopher Brougham QC in _Smith v Braintree District Council_ [1990] 2
AC 215 at 218, citing _Imperial Tobacco_ at, _inter alia_ , 750–752).

182 There are many policy reasons for this approach. One of the reasons, as
succinctly elucidated by Gibbs ACJ in _Sankey_ , is as follows (at 25–26):

[T]he procedure [involved in the grant of declaratory orders] is open to
abuse, particularly in criminal cases, and if wrongly used can cause the very
evils it is designed to avoid. Applications for declarations as to the
admissibility of evidence may in some cases be made by an accused person for
purposes of delay, or by a prosecutor to impose an additional burden on the
accused, but even when such an application is made without any improper motive
it is likely to be dilatory in effect, to fragment the proceedings and to
detract from the efficiency of the criminal process.

183  The seminal case on the question of whether a civil court may make a
declaratory order relating to the criminal consequences of conduct is the
decision of the House of Lords in _Imperial Tobacco_ ([181] _supra_). In that
case, the plaintiff (“Imperial Tobacco”) had launched a sales promotion
campaign involving a “Spot Cash” scheme in which prizes ranging from a packet
of cigarettes to £5,000 could be won. The Director of Public Prosecutions
charged Imperial Tobacco and its senior officers under the Lotteries and
Amusements Act 1976 (c 32) (UK) in respect of the said sales promotion
campaign. Before those charges were tried in the Crown Court, Imperial Tobacco
issued an originating summons in the Commercial Court seeking a declaration
that its sales promotion campaign was lawful. At first instance, Donaldson J
declined to grant the declaration as he was of the view that the “Spot Cash”
scheme was unlawful. Upon appeal to the English Court of Appeal, the scheme
was held to be lawful and the declaration was granted. The Crown then appealed
to the House of Lords. The question of whether a declaration should be granted
given that criminal proceedings were already pending was considered by
Viscount Dilhorne, who described that question as “the most important question
in [the] appeal” (at 740). His Lordship stated (at 741):

That decision [of the English Court of Appeal], if it stands, will form a
precedent for the Commercial Court and other civil courts [to usurp] the
functions of the criminal courts. Publishers may be tempted to seek
declarations that what they propose to publish is not a criminal libel or
blasphemous or obscene. If in this case where the declaration sought was not
in respect of future conduct but in respect of what had already taken place,
it could properly be granted, I see no reason why in such cases a declaration
as to future conduct could not be granted.

184  The main reason given by Viscount Dilhorne as to why a civil court
generally should not exercise its discretion to grant a declaration concerning
the criminal consequences of conduct that is the subject of criminal
proceedings which have already begun is the prejudicial effect which such a
declaratory order would have on the criminal proceedings without binding the
court in those proceedings (_viz_ , the criminal court, as defined at sub-para
(b) of [164] above). His Lordship held (see _Imperial Tobacco_ at 741):

Such a declaration [_ie_ , a declaration made by a civil court as to the
criminal consequences of conduct] is no bar to a criminal prosecution, no
matter the authority of the court which grants it. Such a declaration in a
case such as the present one, made after the commencement of the prosecution,
and in effect a finding of guilt or innocence of the offence charged, cannot
found a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, though it may well
prejudice the criminal proceedings, the result of which will depend on the
facts proved and may not depend solely on admissions made by the accused. If a
civil court of great authority declares on admissions made by the accused that
no crime has been committed, one can foresee the use that might be made of
that at the criminal trial.

185  Viscount Dilhorne then went on to reject the justification proffered by
the English Court of Appeal for granting the declaration (_id_ at 741):

The justification for the Court of Appeal taking this unusual and
unprecedented course – no case was cited to us where a civil court had after
the commencement of a prosecution, granted a declaration that no offence had
been committed – was said to be the length of time it would have taken for the
matter to be determined in the criminal courts. I can well see the advantages
of persons being able to obtain rulings on whether or not certain conduct on
which they propose to embark will be criminal and it may be a defect in our
present system that it does not provide for that. Here, I wish to emphasise,
it was not a question [of] whether future conduct would be permissible but
whether acts done were criminal. It was said that the administration of
justice would belie its name if civil courts refused to answer reasonable
questions on whether certain conduct was or was not lawful. I do not agree. I
think that the administration of justice would become chaotic if, after the
start of a prosecution, declarations of innocence could be obtained from a
civil court.

186 His Lordship concluded (_id_ at 742):

[I]t is not necessary in this case to decide whether a declaration as to the
criminality or otherwise of future conduct can ever properly be made by a
civil court. In my opinion it would be a very exceptional case in which it
would be right to do so. In my opinion it cannot be right to grant a
declaration that an accused is innocent after a prosecution has started.

187 Lord  Lane based his decision on the same grounds, holding (_id_ at 752):

Counsel appearing before your Lordships’ House were unable to find any case in
which a defendant in criminal proceedings already properly and not vexatiously
instituted had applied for a declaration that the criminal proceedings were
unfounded or [were] based on a misapprehension as to the true meaning of the
criminal statute. I do not find that dearth of authority surprising. It would
be strange if a defendant to proper criminal proceedings were able to pre-empt
those proceedings by application to a judge of the High Court whether sitting
in the Commercial Court or elsewhere. What effect in law upon the criminal
proceedings would any pronouncement from the High Court in these circumstances
have? The criminal court would not be bound by the decision. In practical
terms it would simply have the inevitable effect of prejudicing the criminal
trial one way or the other.

Where there are concurrent proceedings in different courts between parties who
for practical purposes are the same in each, and the same issue will have to
be determined in each, the court has [the] jurisdiction to stay one set of
proceedings if it is just and convenient to do so or if the circumstances are
such that one set of proceedings is vexations and an abuse of the process of
the court. Where, however, criminal proceedings have been properly instituted
and are not vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court it is not a
proper exercise of the court’s discretion to grant to the defendant in those
proceedings a declaration that the facts to be alleged by the prosecution do
not in law prove the offence charged.

188 Lord Fraser of Tullybelton similarly held (_id_ at 746):

I am in entire agreement with my noble and learned friends that this is not a
case in which the discretion of the court should have been exercised to make
the declaration. By doing so the civil court, in my opinion, improperly
intruded into the domain of the criminal court, notwithstanding that criminal
proceedings had already been begun. We were not referred to any reported cases
where such intrusion had occurred and in my opinion it ought not to be
permitted except possibly in some very special circumstances which are not
found here.

189 __ The principles enunciated in _Imperial Tobacco_ ([181] _supra_)
regarding the grant by a civil court of a declaration relating to the criminal
consequences of conduct which is the subject of criminal proceedings that have
_already been_ _properly begun_ were either applied or referred to in, _inter
alia_ , _Attorney-General v Able_ [1984] 1 QB 795, _T v T_ [1988] Fam 52 and
_Regina v Attorney General_ [2004] 1 AC 357. The English Court of Appeal went
further in _Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc_ _v The British Phonographic
Industry Limited_ [1986] FSR 159 (“ _Amstrad_ ”) and held that once there was
a _possibility_ of criminal proceedings, a declaration of innocence _vis-à-
vis_ conduct which was the subject matter of the potential criminal
proceedings should not be made. In _Amstrad_ , the British Phonographic
Industry Limited (“BPI”) sent a letter to Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc
(“Amstrad”) alleging that the latter had acted unlawfully in the way in which
it advertised and marketed its tape recorders. In particular, BPI was of the
view that Amstrad had encouraged or had at least enabled purchasers to
infringe copyright in pre-recorded cassette tapes by using Amstrad’s two-deck
tape recorders to duplicate such tapes. Amstrad then sought a declaration that
it had not acted unlawfully. At first instance, Whitford J refrained from
granting the declaration as he was of the view that a criminal offence could
have been committed by Armstrad in that the latter “could be said to [have
been] inciting or procuring or aiding or abetting acts of copyright
infringement by those who used their audio systems for that purpose” (at 160).
On appeal, the English Court of Appeal unanimously agreed with Whitford J’s
decision. Lawton LJ held (_id_ at 209):

I do not find it either necessary or proper to adjudge whether, on the
evidence before the court, Amstrad [has] incited anyone to commit an offence
contrary to section 21(3) of the [Copyright Act 1956 (c 74) (UK)]. In the
event of anyone instituting criminal proceedings in respect of Amstrad’s
advertising activities, a finding by this court would prejudice the trial. In
these circumstances, in my judgment, it would not be right, in the exercise of
the court’s discretion, to grant the declaration requested.

The other two members of the coram, Slade LJ and Glidewell LJ, concurred with
Lawton LJ on this point (see _Amstrad_ at 217 and 219 respectively).

190 As can be seen, _Amstrad_ went further than _Imperial_ _Tobacco_ in
delineating the circumstances in which a civil court should not make a
declaration _vis-à-vis_ what might potentially be criminal conduct _._
_Amstrad_ would stand for the proposition that as long as there is a real
possibility that criminal proceedings may be initiated, a civil court should
be slow to make any declaration which could have the effect of prejudicing the
subsequent criminal proceedings. In the present case, there is no need for us
to speculate on whether or not criminal proceedings may be brought against the
Plaintiff (_cf_ the situation which the English Court of Appeal was faced with
in _Amstrad_) as criminal proceedings against the Plaintiff have already been
commenced via the Private Summonses. In the circumstances, the present appeal
by the First Defendant (_ie_ , the Cross-Appeal) would not turn on the
extension made by _Amstrad_ to the principles enunciated in _Imperial
Tobacco_.

191 The principles laid down in _Imperial Tobacco_ regarding judicial
restraint in granting declaratory orders relating to the criminal consequences
of conduct have been applied in a number of Malaysian and Singapore cases
(see, _eg_ , _Attorney General of Hong Kong v Zauyah Wan Chik_ [1995] 2 MLJ
620, _Dato’ Wan Mustapha bin Haji Ali v Pengurus Pejabat Tempatan, Pertubuhan
Keselamatan Sosial Pekerja, Kota Bharu_ [2000] 1 MLJ 95, _Lee Yee Seng v
Golden Star Video Bhd_ [1981] 2 MLJ 43, _Jeyaretnam JB v Attorney General_
[1990] SLR 610 and _Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs_ [2006] 1 SLR
582).

192 From the analysis above, it appears to be well-established law that while
a civil court has the jurisdiction to grant a declaration as to the criminal
consequences of conduct, it will normally be slow to do so unless the
circumstances are exceptional. Such exceptional circumstances would arise,
_inter alia_ , where the criminal proceedings have not been properly brought
or are vexatious or amount to an abuse of process in that the facts alleged by
the Prosecution do not in law prove the offence charged. As _Singapore Civil
Procedure 2007_ (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2007) states (at
para 15/16/4):

A declaration ought not to be granted by the judge in a civil court to a
defendant in criminal proceedings, which are properly instituted against him
and are not vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court, on the ground
that the facts alleged by the prosecution do not in law prove the offence
charged, because to make such a declaration would be to usurp the function of
the criminal court without binding it and would thus inevitably prejudice the
criminal trial …

193 Exceptional circumstances may also arise in cases where _none_ of the
factors mentioned in the preceding paragraph are present. An example of such a
case would be _Airedale NHS Trust v Bland_ ([181] _supra_), where a
declaration was made that the Airedale National Health Service Trust (“the NHS
Trust”) could lawfully discontinue life-sustaining treatment to a patient who
was in a persistent vegetative state. If the court had not ruled on the
legality or otherwise of withdrawing treatment from the patient concerned, the
NHS Trust would not have been able to stop treatment without facing potential
criminal prosecution for murder. Another example would be _Royal College of
Nursing of the United Kingdom v Department of Health and Social Security_
[1981] AC 800. In that case, the Royal College of Nursing (“the Royal
College”) sought a declaration as to the role which nurses could lawfully play
in the termination of a pregnancy. There had been a dispute between the Royal
College and the Department of Health and Social Security (“the DHSS”) as to
what conduct nurses could lawfully engage in _vis-à-vis_ the termination of a
pregnancy in the light of s 1(1) of the Abortion Act 1967 (c 87) (UK), which
made it lawful in specified circumstances for there to be a termination of a
pregnancy by a “registered medical practitioner”. At first instance, the case
was distinguished from _Imperial Tobacco_ ([181] _supra_) and a declaration
was granted by Woolf J that the nurses’ role as delineated in a circular dated
21 February 1980 issued by the DHSS would not involve the nurses engaging in
any unlawful acts. It was held that the Royal College had appropriately
brought the proceedings in view of the close relationship which it had with
nurses and their work. The English Court of Appeal reversed Woolf J’s
decision, but, on further appeal, the House of Lords restored (by a majority
of 3:2) the declaration granted by Woolf J.

194 In Australia, the courts appear to be guided by a more generic description
(as compared to the more specific description outlined at [192] above) of the
exceptional circumstances in which a civil court may grant a declaration as to
the criminal consequences of conduct. In _Bourke v Hamilton_ [1977] 1 NSWLR
470, for instance, Needham J stated (at 493):

[T]he power to interfere with committal proceedings is a drastic one, to be
exercised only in those cases where the Supreme Court takes the view that a
_failure to exercise it will necessarily result in an injustice being
perpetrated_. [emphasis added]

Expressions of similar views can be found in, _inter alia_ , _Moss v Brown_
[1979] 1 NSWLR 114, _Green v Jones_ (1979) 39 FLR 428, _Perry v Nash_ (1980)
47 FLR 210, _Conwell v Tapfield_ [1981] 1 NSWLR 595, _Coles v Wood_ [1981] 1
NSWLR 723 and _Nichols v State of Queensland_ [1983] 1 Qd R 580.

_The grant of the Declaration in the present case_

195  The substantive issue which we have to consider in the Cross-Appeal is
whether the Judge was right to grant the Declaration. Whether he was correct
or not would, of course, depend on the facts of the case. It should be added
that the discretion as to whether or not to grant declaratory relief is to be
exercised by the trial judge, and an appellate court will ordinarily interfere
with the way in which the trial judge has exercised his discretion only if it
can _clearly_ be shown that such discretion has been exercised wrongly.

196  The legal burden of showing that the Declaration should be granted would
fall squarely on the Plaintiff. It is trite law that the burden of proof
should _prima facie_ be borne by the party who asserts a claim (see, _inter
alia_ , _Amstrad_ ([189] _supra_) at 182 and s 104 of the Evidence Act (Cap
97, 1997 Rev Ed)). As stated in C R Williams, “Burdens and Standards in Civil
Litigation” (2003) 25 Syd LR 165 (at 172):

[T]he basic starting point is that the burden of proof should normally be on
the plaintiff as to all issues. In the absence of reasons to the contrary, the
party who invoked the judicial process and compelled the defendant’s
involvement in that process, should run the risk of having decided against her
or him any issue as to which the tribunal of fact is, at the end of the day,
undecided.

197  Accordingly, the Plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the
present case is an _exceptional_ one warranting the grant of the Declaration.
However, there is really nothing to suggest that the criminal proceedings
against the Plaintiff have not been properly brought or are vexatious or
constitute an abuse of process in that the facts alleged would not in law
prove the offences charged (see [192] above). There is also nothing in the
present case which indicates that the failure to grant the Declaration will
“necessarily result in an injustice being perpetrated” (_per_ Needham J in
_Bourke v Hamilton_ ([194] _supra_) at 493).

**_Our conclusion on the grant of the Declaration_**

198 To summarise, the doctrine of _res judicata_ does not apply to the Cross-
Appeal as there is no identity of subject matter between the issue decided in
the Summons and the issue which the First Defendant seeks to raise in the
Cross-Appeal. As such, the First Defendant is entitled to appeal against the
Judge’s grant of the Declaration. As for whether the Declaration should have
been granted in the court below, our view is that the answer is “no”. As
stated above (at, _inter alia_ , [181] and [192]), it is well-established that
a civil court will in normal circumstances be slow to grant a declaration as
to the criminal consequences of conduct unless the circumstances are
exceptional. In the present case, there were no exceptional circumstances
warranting the grant of the Declaration. The Judge, with respect, erred in
granting the Declaration.

**The costs order made by the Judge**

199  The Judge said (at [100] of the Judgment) that he “dismiss[ed] [Prayer] 1
and [Prayer] 2 [of the Originating Summons] with costs”, but did not make it
clear whether he was referring to only one set of costs for the First
Defendant and the Second Defendant combined. On the assumption that the Judge
ordered the Plaintiff to pay a separate set of costs to the Second Defendant
in respect of Prayer 1 and Prayer 2, the Plaintiff has appealed against the
Judge’s costs order.

200 In general, the principles governing the award of costs are that costs are
in the discretion of the court, and costs should follow the event except when
it appears to the court that some other order should be made in the
circumstances of the case (see O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court).

201 One trite principle that guides the exercise of the court’s discretion as
to costs is that where there are two (or more) co-defendants, _only one set of
costs will normally be payable_ to them if both (or all) of them succeed, even
if they were separately represented (see, _inter alia_ , _Singapore Civil
Procedure 2007_ ([192] _supra_) at para 15/4/17). The court, however, may
allow separate costs where reasonable grounds have been shown for the
severance of defences (see _Singapore Court Practice 2006_ (Jeffery Pinsler
gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2006) at para 59/2/6).

202 In the present case, there were no reasonable grounds for the severance of
defences. There was no need for the First Defendant and the Second Defendant
to file separate defences to the Plaintiff’s prayers for revocation and/or
invalidation of the registration of the Opposed Mark and for the grant of the
Declaration. In our view, the First Defendant and the Second Defendant could
well have instructed one set of lawyers for the entire proceedings as their
positions on the issues in dispute were common. We would add that the Second
Defendant, as the sole and exclusive licensee of the Opposed Mark in
Singapore, was clearly correctly joined as a co-defendant to the proceedings
as, _inter alia_ , its rights would have been directly affected by the orders
sought in the Originating Summons.

203 That said, it seems to us that the proper avenue for the Plaintiff to have
this point on costs clarified would have been by writing to the Judge for
clarification instead of by appealing against the Judge’s costs order. Be that
as it may, we now order that only one set of costs be paid to the First
Defendant and the Second Defendant in respect of the hearing in the court
below _vis-à-vis_ Prayer 1 and Prayer 2 of the Originating Summons.

**Summary of the decision of this court**

204 In the result, the Plaintiff’s appeal against the Judge’s refusal to
revoke or invalidate the registration of the Opposed Mark (_ie_ , the Appeal)
is dismissed. On the other hand, the First Defendant’s cross-appeal against
the grant of the Declaration (_ie_ , the Cross-Appeal) is allowed. Except for
the Judge’s order on costs (which the Plaintiff could easily have clarified
with the Judge), the Plaintiff has failed in the Appeal and the First
Defendant has succeeded in the Cross-Appeal. Accordingly, the First Defendant
and the Second Defendant shall have the costs of the Appeal, _viz_ , one set
of costs, with the usual consequential orders to apply. The First Defendant
shall also have the costs of the Cross-Appeal, likewise with the usual
consequential orders to apply.

**Coda**

205 This appears to be one of those cases in which a party who has been
charged with (_inter alia_) trade mark infringement in the Subordinate Courts
mounts a root-and-branch attack on the _criminal_ proceedings by subsequently
bringing a separate _civil_ action for revocation and/or invalidation of the
disputed trade mark as a “defence” to the _criminal_ prosecution. Applications
for revocation and/or invalidation of the registration of trade marks cannot,
however, be made to the Subordinate Courts, but must instead be made to either
the Registrar of Trade Marks or the High Court (see ss 22(5) and 23(5) of the
current TMA; see also the definition of “Court” in s 2(1) of the same Act).
Counsel for the Plaintiff (the party charged in the criminal proceedings)
therefore had to commence civil proceedings in the High Court (by way of the
Originating Summons) for (_inter alia_) revocation and/or invalidation of the
registration of the Opposed Mark. Both counsel for the First Defendant and
counsel for the Second Defendant have acknowledged that the procedure adopted
by the Plaintiff was correct. Accordingly, proceedings have been instituted
before two different _fora_. Indeed, a third set of proceedings (_viz_ , the
Criminal Revision (see [12] above)) is currently pending.

206 This state of affairs is unsatisfactory as it results in duplication of
proceedings, considerably delays matters and wastes resources. For future
similar cases (and, indeed, counsel for the Plaintiff has informed us that
there are several waiting in the wings), parties ought to agree to consolidate
all concurrent related proceedings in the High Court so that those proceedings
may be heard expeditiously by the same judge. The prosecuting party in such
cases ought to request that the criminal proceedings be moved to the High
Court for the simple reason that the Subordinate Courts are not empowered to
hear applications for revocation and/or invalidation of the registration of
trade marks.
