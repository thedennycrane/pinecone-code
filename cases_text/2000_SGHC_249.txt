**JUDGMENT:**

**Oral Judgment**

__**Charge**__

1\. The Accused was charged and tried on the following amended charge:-

> You, LEE WEE CHENG
>
> are charged that you on the 7th day of June 2000, between 12 a.m. and 4.55
> a.m. at Blk 668-C, Jurong West ST 64 #15-144, Singapore, did commit culpable
> homicide not amounting to murder, by causing the death of one Lee Luan Ku
> (male/68 years), to wit, by punching his head and kicking his body, which
> act was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as was likely
> to cause death and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under
> section 304(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

1\. The Accused killed his own father by kicking and punching him violently
for reprimanding him for sniffing glue in the toilet of his house. The Accused
had earlier consumed a fair amount of alcohol. The prosecution in its facts
conceded that there was some evidence that the Accused was to some extent
intoxicated with alcohol and as a result of glue sniffing.

2\. The Deceased’s death resulted from bleeding internally due to multiple
chest and abdominal injuries as certified by the Pathologist.

3\. It has been drawn to my attention that the Accused has a previous
conviction for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon in 1981
for which he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Although the offence
took place long ago it does appear that the Accused continues to have a
residual propensity for violence.

4\. The fact that the Accused was to some extent intoxicated by alcohol and as
a result of glue sniffing in committing the offence has already been taken
into consideration by the prosecution in reducing the charge from murder to
culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

5\. However in relation to sentencing the Accused on the charge I am of the
opinion that drink constitutes an aggravation, as an assault by an aggressor
under such influence tends to frighten an average person much more.

6\. I accept that the case has some mitigational aspects such as the Accused
having called the police some hours later when he saw his father lying
unconscious on the floor as well as the remorse he has expressed.

7\. Although the Accused will no doubt live in shame and sorrow for the rest
of his life for this patricide I have to view both the circumstances of the
offence and the relationship of the Accused as a son to the Deceased - and at
that an adult - seriously.

8\. In the circumstances I sentence the Accused to 9 years imprisonment. The
sentence is backdated to 7th June 2000.
