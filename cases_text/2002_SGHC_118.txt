_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_

The facts

_****

The appellant, Tan Cheng Kwee (‘Tan’), was the director in charge of Henry
Transport & General Agency Company Pte Ltd (‘the company’), and was the sole
person running the operations of the company. The company transported goods in
containers from warehouses to the Port of Singapore Authority (‘PSA’)
Container Terminal, and vice-versa.

2 The company owned two prime movers, one of which bore the licence plate
number XA 6305 S (‘the prime mover’). At the material time, it had two drivers
under its employ – Selamat bin Sa’man (‘Selamat’) and Yahya bin Noordin
(‘Yahya’).

3 On 13 May 2000, Tan instructed Selamat to drive the prime mover to Admiralty
Road West in order to transport a container to the PSA Container Terminal. At
approximately 12:12 p.m. that day, after loading up the container onto his
trailer, Selamat was driving the prime mover along Hillview Road in the
direction of Hillview Avenue when the top of the container hit a height
restriction gantry. The vehicle proceeded on, but, due to its height,
subsequently found itself wedged beneath the railway bridge that passed over
the road. Selamat managed to free the vehicle. Whilst attempting to continue
along its journey, the top of the container struck and damaged a second height
restriction gantry, causing it to tilt precariously to one side.

4 The police arrived shortly and detained Selamat. Tan was called to the
scene. It was quickly discovered that the company did not possess the licence
to operate a heavy motor vehicle that had an overall height exceeding four
metres. The height of the prime mover with trailer and container was 4.465
metres. Tan appeared to be unaware that such a permit was necessary and
promptly applied for one on behalf of the company. Height restriction permits
are valid for one year and are issued free of charge.

The charge

_

5 Selamat was indicted on a number of charges. Unfortunately, he absconded
whilst on bail. Tan was later charged for the following offence:

> You,
>
> TAN CHENG KWEE, M/47 YRS  
>  NRIC NO. S0126513Z

> are charged that you on the 13th day of May 2000 in Singapore, did cause to
> be driven on public roads, a heavy motor vehicle XA 6305 S that has an
> overall height which exceeds 4 metres, without there being in force a permit
> from Deputy Commissioner of Police and you have thereby committed an offence
> punishable under section 79(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap. 276

6 Section 79 of the Road Traffic Act (‘the Act’) read as follows:

> 79\. – (1) Where the overall height of a heavy motor vehicle exceeds 4
> metres, any person who, without a permit from the Deputy Commissioner of
> Police, is in charge of or drives or causes to be driven the vehicle on a
> road shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction –
>
> (a) for a first offence, to imprisonment for a term of not less than one
> year and not more than 3 years and, in addition, to a fine not exceeding
> $2,000; and
>
> (b) for a second or subsequent offence, to imprisonment for a term of not
> less than 2 years and not more than 5 years and, in addition, to a fine not
> exceeding $5,000.

Decision of the district court

_

7 The district judge held that s 79 of the Act was intended to create a strict
liability offence. He was of the view that the presumption of law that _mens
rea_ was a requirement of criminal liability was displaced by the fact that
the provision was concerned with an issue of social concern and public safety.
It was important for vehicles beyond a certain height to be restricted to
travelling on certain roads due to height restrictions on others. Strict
liability was thus essential for the protection of the public.

8 As such, four elements had to be established in order for the prosecution to
prove its case. These were:

> (a) That the prime mover was a ‘heavy motor vehicle’ within the meaning of s
> 79 (1) of the Act;
>
> (b) That the overall height of the prime mover exceeded 4 metres;

> (c) That no permit was issued in respect of the prime mover;
>
> (d) That Tan had caused this prime mover to be driven on public roads
> without such a permit.

9 The judge found that all four elements were established. In his opinion, Tan
had failed to make out a defence that he had taken reasonable care, since no
attempt had been made by Tan to check the height of the container.

10 The district judge found Tan guilty of the charge and sentenced him to 14
months’ imprisonment. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all
classes of driving licences for a period of one year with effect from Tan’s
date of release from prison. Tan appealed against conviction and sentence but
after hearing counsel’s arguments I dismissed the appeal. The district judge,
in his grounds of decision, realised that he had omitted to impose a fine made
mandatory by s 79(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (RTA), and asked this Court to
exercise its powers of revision in order to correct the error. I therefore
imposed a fine of $1,000 on Tan. However, I revoked that part of the district
judge’s order relating to the disqualification from holding all classes of
driving licences. The grounds for my decision are set out below.

_

  
The appeal

_

11 There were three key thrusts in the appeal against conviction. The first
was that s 79(1) of the Act did not create a strict liability offence. The
second was that, in any event, there was no evidence that suggested that Tan
knew that the prime mover exceeded four metres in height and therefore he did
not ‘cause’ the vehicle to be unlawfully driven. The final point was that,
even if s 79(1) of the Act did create a strict liability offence, Tan’s
failure to know the facts that constituted unlawful user did not amount to
negligence and that therefore the defence of reasonable care was available to
him.

12 As for the appeal against sentence, the submission was that the term of 14
months’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive, and furthermore the judge
seemed to have placed undue weight on the fact that Tan had chosen to claim
trial.

_

  
Did s 79(1) create a strict liability offence?

_

13 There is a presumption of law that _mens rea_ is a necessary ingredient of
any statutory provision that creates an offence: _Sweet v Parsley_ [1970] AC
132; _Lim Chin Aik v R_ [1963] MLJ 50; _PP v Phua Keng Tong_ [1986] 2 MLJ 279.
This presumption, however, can be rebutted by the clear language of the
statute, or by necessary implication, although it is not sufficient if the
provision merely lacks terms that are commonly associated with _mens rea_.
Where an examination of the language of the statute does not assist, the Court
will have to look at all the relevant circumstances to determine the true
intention of Parliament. Such considerations include the nature of the crime,
the punishment prescribed, the absence of social obloquy, the particular
mischief and the field of activity in which the crime occurred.

14 It is well known that the presumption of _mens rea_ is often displaced in
situations where the statutory offence in question pertains to issues of
social concern. This is especially so in cases of public safety where the
prohibited act is not one which the public can easily protect itself against
through its own vigilance. In _Lim Chin Aik v R_ [1963] MLJ 50 at 52, Lord
Evershed made the following observation:

> Where the subject matter of the statute is the regulation for the public
> welfare of a particular activity … it frequently has been inferred that the
> legislature intended that such activities should be carried out under
> conditions of strict liability. The presumption is that the statute or
> statutory instrument can be effectively enforced only if those in charge of
> the relevant activities are made responsible for seeing that they are
> complied with. When such a presumption is to be inferred, it displaces the
> ordinary presumption of mens rea.

15 Even then, it must be shown that the creation of strict liability will be
effective in promoting the objects of the statute by encouraging greater care
to prevent the commission of the prohibited act: _Gammon Ltd v AG of Hong
Kong_ [1984] 3 WLR 437.

16 The question as to whether s 79(1) of the Act was one that imposed strict
liability had been previously dealt with by the Magistrate’s Court in the case
of _PP v Yeo Gim Lam_ TAC No. 844 of 1987 (unreported). In that case, the
accused was charged with driving a cargo crane, with an overall height
exceeding four metres, without the relevant licence. The boom of the loader
had struck the underside of the Change Alley aerial plaza that spanned Collyer
Quay from Clifford Pier to the Singapore Rubber House. The judge held that s
79(1) did create a strict liability offence. He said:

> It is easy to discern the legislative intent on placing upon a person
> driving on the road a heavy motor vehicle which exceeds 4.00 metres, the
> duty of ensuring that there is a permit from the Deputy Commissioner of
> Police. Under subsection 2 of section 79 of the Act, in granting such a
> permit, the Deputy Commissioner of Police may impose such conditions as he
> thinks fit including conditions relating to the overall height of the
> vehicle, the lateral projection of any load carried by the vehicle, the
> maximum speed of the vehicle, the requirement for police or other escort;
> and of particular relevance to the present case, the route the vehicle is
> permitted to travel. In land scarce Singapore, it is to be expected that
> there will be, and as a matter of fact there are, numerous flyovers,
> pedestrian overhead bridges, aerial plazas and other similar overhanging
> structures above the roads which the public uses frequently. It is very
> clear promotion of safety. It performs the social utility of ensuring that
> drivers of heavy motor vehicles above a certain height are in possession of
> and, more importantly, are cognisant of the conditions imposed therein so
> that their vehicles would not pose a potential hazard to these overhanging
> structures and endanger the lives of those using them.

17 It was patently clear to me that s 79(1) of the Act fell within that class
of statutory offences that dealt with public safety. Indeed, such was the
tenor of the speech by the then Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Chua Sian Chin,
during the second reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill in Parliament
on 2 March 1984, at which the Government first sought to make it an offence
for vehicles above the height of 3.2 metres to be driven without a licence. He
said:

> It is clear that some drivers and owners of motor vehicles which carry loads
> of excessive heights are not concerned with the dangers that they pose and
> the damage that they could cause with their irresponsible behaviour. It is
> also evident that the present penalties provided under out existing
> legislations are insufficient to deter such behaviour. It was fortuitous and
> fortunate that no one was hurt in all the four incidents I have recounted.
> However, we cannot rely on such good fortune and allow pedestrians to be
> constantly exposed to such risks until somebody has been hurt … The
> recklessness of some inconsiderate drivers and owners must be curbed without
> delay. It would be too late to punish them after the harm is done. In view
> of grave danger to public safety, it is necessary to provide for strict
> deterrent measures and heavy penalties to prevent the occurrence of another
> incident of a vehicle with a high load hitting a pedestrian overhead bridge.

18 In pressing his case that s 79(1) of the Act was not to be construed as a
strict liability offence, counsel for Tan argued that the district judge had
failed to consider the significance of the mandatory minimum sentence of one
year’s imprisonment. The severity of the penalty, he said, suggested that
Parliament could not have intended this to be a strict liability offence. In
support of this proposition, counsel relied on a passage in _M V Balakrishnan
v PP_ [1998] 1 CLAS News 357, a judgment of mine, which read:

> In his book, "Public Welfare Offences" … Professor Sayre suggested that if
> the penalty is slight, involving, for instance, a fine, particularly if
> adequate enforcement depends upon wholesale prosecution, or if the social
> danger arising from violation is serious, the doctrine of basing liability
> upon mere activity rather than fault is sound.

19 The passage quoted above should not be misconstrued. The severity of the
penal sanction is but one of the many factors that the Court has to take into
account in trying to ascertain Parliamentary intent. While a slight penalty
may be a factor in favour of construing an offence as one based on strict
liability, there is by no means a definitive correlation. Parliament has the
power to prescribe severe penalties for strict liability offences in order to
achieve its legislative purpose. The speech of the then Minister for Home
Affairs, parts of which have been reproduced in 17 above, revealed that the
legislature had strong deterrence on its mind following the numerous
collisions that had taken place, one after another, with pedestrian overhead
bridges and aerial plazas in 1983 alone. In this regard, I found the approach
taken by the Privy Council in _Gammon Ltd v A-G of Hong Kong_[1984] 3 WLR 437
very instructive. Defence counsel in that case had advanced the argument that
the severity of the maximum penalties prescribed in the provision in question
pointed away from a strict liability construction of s40(2A)(b) of the Hong
Kong Building Ordinance. Rejecting this, Lord Scarman remarked:

> … there is nothing inconsistent with the purpose of the Ordinance in
> imposing severe penalties for offences of strict liability. The legislature
> could reasonably have intended severity to be a significant deterrent,
> bearing in mind the risks to public safety arising from some contraventions
> of the Ordinance.

20 Counsel’s next argument was that s 79(1) of the Act should only have been
interpreted as a strict liability offence if that was a matter of necessary
implication. It was not the case if it could only be reasonably implied as
such. He then referred to the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment)
Bill 1984 and pointed out that the then Minister of Home Affairs had not
explicitly indicated that a strict liability offence was intended. On the
contrary, he had said that the "recklessness of some inconsiderate drivers and
owners must be curbed without delay". This, argued Counsel, showed that
knowledge of, or at least recklessness to, the fact of unlawful user was a
necessary ingredient of s 79(1) of the Act.

21 While a provision should only be taken to impose strict liability if it was
a matter of necessary implication from all the circumstances, I disagreed with
the submission that knowledge or recklessness was a requisite ingredient of s
79(1). The aim of the legislation was to curb recklessness. It did not follow
that the prosecution had to prove that an accused person had a mental element
of recklessness or, for that matter, any other mens rea element. A strict
liability reading would rigorously promote the intention of Parliament by
encouraging, or coercing, drivers and owners of heavy motor vehicles to
exercise a fair degree of care and consideration in their activities. On the
contrary, imputing a state of mind as a necessity for every single element of
the offence would not only severely stultify the legislative purpose but would
actually go against its very grain. After all, drivers and owners of heavy
motor vehicles with high loads risked causing serious public harm if they did
not positively take care. Harm might also be done if they were merely passive,
knew nothing or were honestly mistaken about the facts and did not know that
they had to obtain the requisite licences that would immediately tell them
which roads were out of bounds to their vehicles. Therefore, it did not make
sense that a conviction should hinge on proof of positive knowledge or
intention.

22 In the result, I was of the firm opinion that s 79(1) of the Act did create
a strict liability offence.

_

  
Did Tan cause the prime mover to be driven on public roads?

_

23 The district judge had noted in his grounds of decision that "[t]he offence
of ‘causing’ unlawful user requires proof of _mens rea_ in knowledge of the
facts rendering the user unlawful". Counsel for Tan argued that the facts
which Tan must be shown to have had knowledge of were, firstly, that the
overall height of the vehicle exceeded four metres, and secondly, that there
was no permit issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in respect of that
prime mover. He then claimed that Tan did not possess such knowledge because
he had not been told about the height of the container by the company that
wanted the container transported from Admiralty Road to the PSA Container
Terminal.

24 I was of the view that Counsel had misunderstood the district judge’s
decision on this particular issue, which grounds read as follows:

> 24 The offence of "causing" unlawful use requires proof of _mens rea_ in
> knowledge of the facts rendering the user unlawful. In the case of a limited
> company, such knowledge had to be of someone exercising a directing mind
> over the company’s affairs. (see _James & Sons Ltd v Smee _[1955] 1 QBD 78,
> _Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond_ [1974] RTR 279).
>
> 25 "To cause", as pointed out by the defence, involves some express or
> positive mandate from the person "causing to the other person, or some
> authority from the former to the latter arising in the circumstances of the
> case. (see _Mcleod v Buchanan_ [1940] 2 All ER 179). It has also been held
> in English cases that the term "to cause" involves some degree of control
> and direction (see _Shavner v Rosner_ [1954] 2 All ER 280).
>
> 26 In the instant case, it is clear that the accused had knowledge of the

> evidence that it was him who had, on 13 May 2000 [see evidence-in-chief of

>
> 27 It is therefore clear that the accused knew of the facts rendering the
> user unlawful. There is also no doubt that as the person in charge of the
> company’s motor container services, he had some degree of control and
> direction over Selamat, an employee of the company. I was thus of the
> opinion that the accused did cause XA 6305S to be driven on a public road.

25 It was obvious to me from a reading of the text above that the judge had
intended the knowledge of unlawful user to relate _only_ to the fact that Tan
knew that the prime mover was being driven on public roads and that he had
control and direction over that act. This was especially evident from 26,
quoted above, where the only evidence that the judge cited as proof of
knowledge of unlawful user was (i.) that Tan was the director solely in charge
of the company, and (ii.) that Tan had given instructions to his driver,
Selamat, to pick up the container and send it to the PSA Container Terminal.
It was not necessary, and it certainly did not appear to be the judge’s
intention, to require the prosecution to show _further_ that Tan had knowledge
that the vehicle exceeded four metres in height since the user was unlawful
the moment the actus reus of driving without the required permit took place.

26 Having said that, it must also be pointed out that the citation of the
English cases of _Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond_ [1974] RTR 279 and _James & Son Ltd
v Smee_ [1955] 1 QB 78 in the district court’s grounds of decision as support
for the proposition that "[t]he offence of ‘causing’ unlawful user requires
proof of _mens rea_ in knowledge of the facts rendering the user unlawful",
may unfortunately have provided some inspiration for Counsel’s present
submission. These cases, however, appeared unhelpful to the present appeal in
view of the policy considerations behind, as well as the present state of law
relating to strict liability offences in Singapore.

27 In _Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond_ [1974] RTR 279, s 40(5) of the UK Road Traffic
Act 1972 provided that "a person … (b) who uses on a road a motor vehicle …
which does not comply with any such regulations or __causes__ or permits a
vehicle to be so used, shall be guilty of an offence" [emphasis added]. The
defendant, a company owning vehicles, had explicitly warned the drivers under
its employ, via notices in their pay packets and signs displayed at its
premises, to be careful not to overload their vehicles in breach of regulation
121 of the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1969. That
regulation prohibited the overloading of vehicles beyond that stipulated in
the certificate issued to specific vehicles. Notwithstanding the warning, one
of the defendant’s drivers in the course of his employment took an unloaded
lorry out of the premises and overloaded it. The defendant was charged for
causing a breach of the regulation. Distinguishing the earlier case of _Sopp v
Long_ [1969] 1 All ER 855, May J, giving the main judgment of the Court of
Appeal, held that in order to prove that one had "caused" an absolute
liability offence to be committed, the prosecution would have to prove the
_mens rea_ of knowledge of the facts that _rendered_ the user unlawful. The
defendant was thus acquitted because it did not know that its employee had
filled the vehicle beyond the maximum prescribed load; it had also explicitly
forbidden such overloading. Therefore, the defendant did not "cause" the
primary offence to take place.

28 The first observation to be made about this case was that the common law
defence of due diligence or reasonable care, as enunciated in the Canadian
case of _R v City of Sault Ste Marie_ (1978) 85 DLR (3d) 161 and adopted in
our jurisdiction by the case of _M V Balakrishnan v PP_[1998] 1 CLAS News 357,
was not a concept available to the English Court of Appeal at that time. This
was unlike the factual matrix in _Sopp v Long_ [1969] 1 All ER 855, where the
defendant employer had the benefit of statutory exceptions in the UK Weights
and Measures Act 1963 to the offence of ‘causing’ a contravention of the Act.
These exceptions to liability required the defendant to prove that he had
taken all reasonable precautions and exercised all diligence to prevent his
employee from committing the offence. The court in _Ross Hillman’s_ case, on
the other hand, was confronted with the situation where the defendant had
explicitly warned its employees against committing the offence and done
everything in its power to prevent breaches from occurring. To have convicted
the defendant under such circumstances would have invoked the spectre that
Devlin J (as he then was) had raised in _Reynolds v G H Austin & Sons Ltd
_[1951] 2 KB 135 at 149, where he said:

> [I]f a man is punished because of an act done by another, whom he cannot
> reasonably be expected to influence or control, the law is engaged, not in
> punishing thoughtlessness or inefficiency, but in pouncing on the most
> convenient victim.

29 The second observation about _Ross Hillman’s_ case was that it created an
absolute liability offence of unlawful user for which proof of _mens rea_ was
unnecessary, and a diagrammatically-opposite offence of causing unlawful user
that was a ‘true criminal offence’ requiring proof of full _mens rea_ ,
amongst the various limbs of a single statutory provision. In our
jurisdiction, however, it is now recognised that strict liability occupies the
position of a halfway-house between absolute liability and true criminal
liability, in the sense that strict liability is made out on proof of _actus
reus_ but a defence of reasonable care is open to the accused: _M V
Balakrishnan v PP_[1998] 1 CLAS News 357. With regard to the word "cause" in
relation to strict liability offences, Dickson J gave the following
instructive comments in the judgment of _R v City of Sault Ste Marie_ (1978)
85 DLR (3d) 161:

> The present case concerns the interpretation of two troublesome words
> frequently found in public welfare statutes: "cause" and "permit". These two
> words are troublesome because neither denotes clearly either full _mens rea_
> nor absolute liability. It is said that a person could not be said to be
> permitting something unless he knew what he was permitting. This is an over-
> simplification. There is authority both ways, indicating that the Courts are
> uneasy with the traditional dichotomy. Some authorities favour the position
> that "permit" does not import _mens rea_ : see _Millar v The Queen_ (1954) 1
> DLR 148; _R v Royal Canadian Legion_ (1971) 21 DLR (3d); _R v Teperman &
> Sons Ltd_ [1968] 4 CCC 67… For a _mens rea_ construction see _James & Son
> Ltd v Smee_, [1955] 1 QB 78; _Somerset v Hart_ (1884), 12 QBC 360 … The same
> is true of "cause". For a non-_mens rea_ construction, see _R v Peconi_
> (1907), 1 CCC (2d) 213; _Alphacell Ltd v Woodward_ , [1972] AC 824; _Sopp v
> Long_ , [1969] 1 All ER 855; _Laird v Dobell_ , [1906] 1 KB 131; _Korten v
> West Sussex County Council, supra_ ; _Shave v Rosner_ , [1954] 2 WLR 1057.
> Others say that "cause" imports a requirement for a _mens rea_ : see
> _Lovelace v DPP_ , [1954] 3 All ER 481; _Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond_ , [1974] 2
> All ER 287; Smith and Hogan, _Criminal Law_ , pp 89-90…
>
> The conflict in the above authorities, however, shows that in themselves the
> words "cause" and "permit" fit much better into an offence of strict
> liability than either full _mens rea_ or absolute liability …
>
> Proof of the prohibited act _prima facie_ imports the offence, but the
> accused may avoid liability by proving that he took reasonable care.

30 As a final point, Counsel’s proposed approach to proving that one had
‘caused’ unlawful user, in the context of s 79(1) as a strict liability
offence, did not make sense in light of the approach taken towards proving
unlawful user itself. A person who drove a motor vehicle that exceeded four
metres in height without possessing the requisite permit commits the strict
liability offence whether or not he was aware of the actual height of the
vehicle, unless of course he could show that all due care had already been
taken. How could it be, then, that a person who ‘caused’ that same motor
vehicle to be driven on the road without the permit could get away by proving
that he did not know about the height of the vehicle? I could see no rational
basis for allowing such inconsistency in approach. As far as s 79(1) of the
Act was concerned, Parliament’s intention was to cast the burden of taking
care, not only on the drivers of heavy motor vehicles, but also on the owners
of these vehicles.

31 To reiterate, when a strict liability offence involved "causing" an act
that was in itself unlawful, all the prosecution needed to establish was the
causal link, or _actus reus_. This involved showing that the accused had some
form of control, direction and mandate over the person doing the unlawful act
proper which the accused had exercised: _Shavner v Rosner_ [1954] 2 All ER
280; _Mcleod v Buchanan_ [1940] 2 All ER 179. Once this was proved, it would
then become incumbent on the defence to prove on a balance of probabilities
that it had taken all reasonable care.

_

  
Had Tan exercised reasonable care?

_

32 Counsel for Tan submitted that, even if s 79(1) of the Act did create a
strict liability offence, which I ruled that it did, his client had
nonetheless exercised reasonable care and was therefore entitled on that
defence to an acquittal. That there was no unreasonable failure to know the
facts that constituted the offence rested on the following points raised by
Counsel:

> (a) In the 1980’s, PSA required road traffic permits for containers entering
> the PSA Container Terminal. It had since ceased enforcing such a requirement
> and therefore Tan’s company had stopped applying for such permits;
>
> (b) In 1999, one of the company’s prime movers carrying a load of the same
> proportions was stopped, and the company charged for exceeding vehicular
> weight restrictions. The company was not prosecuted for failing to possess a
> height permit;
>
> (c) Tan had only begun to oversee the company’s business shortly before the
> incident that led to the charge, when his father’s health declined. After
> taking over, Tan had merely carried on the practice of not applying for
> permits;
>
> (d) The company did not deal with over-heights, which were situations where
> goods extended out of standard containers. Tan knew that these required
> permits and he would let other companies do the job instead;
>
> (e) Tan’s friends had told him that no permit was required for standard
> containers such as the one that was involved in the present incident;
>
> (f) The container in question did not belong to Tan’s company and Tan did
> not have the opportunity to see the container for himself.

33 Regrettably, none of the reasons put forward could even come close to
showing that Tan had exercised reasonable care. Tan was effectively the
managing director of a company whose primary business was the provision of
transport services for containerised cargo. He has had some 25 years’
experience in the industry. It was Tan’s evidence that containers came in
standard sizes, and he had applied for height permits from PSA in the past. As
a matter of fact, Tan claimed to be rather ignorant of the laws governing
vehicular height limits. This was also not a situation where he had
circumscribed the nature of his business by limiting the size of containers
that he would accept; neither did he expressly warn his drivers not to accept
certain jobs nor ask his clients about the size of their containers.

Appeal against sentence

_

34 When deciding on a suitable penalty to be imposed, the Court should not
take into account the fact that an accused person had chosen to claim trial
instead of pleading guilty. However, taking into account the culpability of
Tan’s conduct, I was unable to accept Counsel’s submission that the sentence
of 14 months’ imprisonment in this instance was manifestly excessive. The
district judge had noted that "the accused failed to take reasonable care, if
at all, to ensure that the vehicle driven by Selamat had a permit … No attempt
was made by the accused to check or confirm the height of the container."
Furthermore, Tan’s neglect had indirectly caused damage to public structures.
A catastrophe could have resulted when his prime mover struck the railway
bridge.

35 The sentence of imprisonment aside, I quashed the order of the district
court disqualifying Tan from holding all classes of driving licence for 12
months. From the grounds of decision, it was apparent that the court had
assumed that such disqualification was mandatory by virtue of s 79(4) of the
Act, which stated that "the driver or person in charge of a heavy motor
vehicle convicted of an offence under subsection (1) or (3) shall, unless the
court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice
to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification – (a)
in the case of a first offence, be disqualified from holding or obtaining a
driving licence for a period of not less than one year." From the face of this
provision, it was clear to me that the mandatory disqualification did not
apply to a charge of "causing" the unlawful user. A power to order
disqualification exists under s 42 of the Act but this is a discretionary
power.

36 Section 79(1)(a) of the Act made a fine of not more than $2,000 mandatory
upon conviction. As the district court had omitted to impose this sentence, I
exercised this Court’s power of revision to impose a fine of $1,000.

_

  
Conclusion

_

37 Having assessed the case in its entirety, I was of the opinion that there
was no merit in the appeal against conviction. Save for the imposition of the
$1,000 mandatory fine and the quashing of the disqualification order, I also
dismissed the appeal against sentence.
