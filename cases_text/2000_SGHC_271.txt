: The plaintiff, Harris Hakim (`HH`), entered into an agreement dated 14 May
1996 for the sale and purchase of a unit in a private housing development
known as Springdale Condominium, with the defendants, Allgreen Properties Ltd
(`Allgreen Properties`) who were the developers of Springdale Condominium. The
agreement was in the prescribed Form E of the Housing Developers Rules 1990
which incorporated within it the Singapore Law Society`s Conditions of Sale
1994. The purchase price of the unit was $1,165,000 which was to be paid in
the various instalments set out in cl 3 of the agreement as the construction
of the development proceeded. Completion was to take place on or before 30
June 2003.  
  
The agreement provided that in the event HH defaulted in the payment of any
instalment for more than 14 days, Allgreen Properties were entitled to charge
interest at the specified rate. The agreement further provided [in cl 5(3)]
that if HH defaulted in payment of any instalment for more than 14 days,
Allgreen Properties were entitled, without prejudice to any other rights
available to Allgreen Properties, on giving not less than 21 days` notice to
HH, to treat the agreement as having been repudiated and upon the expiration
of the 21 days the agreement will be annulled. As the issue in this case
centres around the construction of this provision, I will set it out in full.

> _

> 5(3) If any such unpaid instalments and interest remain unpaid for any
> period in excess of fourteen (14) days after its due date, the Vendor shall

> per cent of the purchase price from the instalments (excluding payment for
> interest) previously paid by the Purchaser_**. [Emphasis added.]
>

Soon after entering into the agreement, HH got into financial difficulties and
found it difficult to keep up with the instalment payments. In a letter dated
28 July 1998, his solicitors requested Allgreen Properties to consider:

> _... serving our client with the relevant notice to repudiate the sale and
> purchase agreement under cl 5 thereof. In such an event your clients may
> forfeit and deduct the sum of $233,000 (ie 20% of the purchase price of
> $1,165,000) from the sum of $699,000 (being the total amount paid by our
> client to date) and refund the balance thereof, ie $466,000to our client._

  
  
By letter dated 30 July 1998, the solicitors for Allgreen Properties replied
that their clients were not agreeable to HH`s request.  
  
HH subsequently defaulted in the payment of further instalments due under the
agreement. On 19 August 1999, the solicitors for Allgreen invoked cl 5(3) of
the agreement and gave notice thereunder to HH that unless HH pays all unpaid
instalments and interest within 21 days thereof, the agreement shall, at the
expiration of the said 21 days be annulled and Allgreen Properties will,
**_without prejudice to any other right available to them at law or in
equity_** , proceed in accordance with cl 5(3) of the agreement.  
  
HH was unable to comply with the notice and by a letter dated 6 December 1999
the solicitors for Allgreen Properties gave notice that `the 21-day period has
expired` and that:

> _In accordance with Condition 29 of the Singapore Law Society`s Conditions
> of Sale 1994, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to
> our clients at law or equity, the deposit paid by your client has been
> forfeited and retained for our client`s own benefit._

  
  
Mr Benedict Peter, counsel for Allgreen Properties, told the court that the
reference in this letter to Condition 29 of the Singapore Law Society`s
Conditions of Sale 1994 was in error. The forfeiture of the 20% was not a
forfeiture under Condition 29 but was a forfeiture under cl 5(3)(c).  
  
Allgreen Properties subsequently re-sold the unit. By a letter dated 23 March
2000, their solicitors informed HH that from the total instalments of $699,000
received from HH, Allgreen Properties would be refunding to HH the sum of
$399,259.87. The computation by which this sum of $399,259.87 was arrived at
was stated in the letter to be as follows:  
  

1 | Original sale price | $ | 1,165,000.00 |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | New sale price | $ | 900,000.00 |  |   
3 | Shortfall | $ | 265,000.00 |  |   
|  |  |  |  |   
Add | Outstanding Interest | $ | 20,896.30 |  |   
| Legal Fees Outstanding | $ | 350.20 |  |   
| Maintenance Charges | $ | 2,532.54 |  |   
| Agent`s Commission | $ | 9,000.00 |  |   
| Outstanding Property Tax | $ | 1,652.09 |  |   
| Auction/Valuation Charges | $ | 309.00 | $ | 299,740.13  
|  |  |  |  |   
4. | Off-set amount paid by original purchaser todate (60%) |  |  | $ | 699,000.00  
5. | Refund Amount | $ | 399,259.87 |  |   
  
  
  
Mr Peter submitted that Allgreen Properties` right to invoke cl 5(3) and
forfeit 20% of the purchase price from the instalments paid by HH, on a plain
reading of cl 5(3), was a right exercisable `without prejudice to any other
rights` available to Allgreen Properties at law or on equity. He submitted
that, that being so, Allgreen Properties were entitled not only to the 20% but
(in the event the 20% was not enough) to hold HH liable for all additional
damages that Allgreen Properties may have suffered as a consequence of HH`s
breach of contract. As the damages suffered in this case, taking into account
the loss and expenses incurred in the re-sale of the property, was in excess
of the 20%, Allgreen Properties were entitled to take these losses into
account in computing the amount that was to be refunded to HH.  
  
Mr Pereira, counsel for HH, disputed the computation by Allgreen on the amount
refundable to HH. Mr Pereira submitted that what cl 5(3) did was to give
Allgreen Properties a contractual right to treat the agreement as having been
repudiated if HH defaulted in payment and failed to comply with a notice
requiring him to remedy the default within a period of 21 days. Mr Pereira
submitted that upon such default occurring, Allgreen Properties were put to an
election. They could re-sell the property as absolute owner **_without
recourse to the agreement_** and pursue a claim at common law for unliquidated
damages for breach. Alternatively, Allgreen Properties could elect to proceed
under cl 5(3) of the agreement. If Allgreen Properties elected to proceed
under cl 5(3), then Allgreen Properties were limited to such compensation as
cl 5(3) allowed. Allgreen Properties, he submitted, cannot recover additional
damages for the breach at common law. Mr Pereira submitted that Allgreen
Properties, having invoked cl 5(3), were not entitled to damages at common law
but entitled only to 20% of the purchase price plus interest. He therefore
sought, on behalf of HH, a further refund from Allgreen Properties of a sum of
$41,659.20.  
  
The premise that has to be established for Mr Pereira to succeed in his
submission is that by invoking their rights to forfeit the 20% under cl 5(3),
Allgreen Properties were forfeiting any other rights and remedies they had
against HH. The difficulty that Mr Pereira faced, in this respect, was the
express preservation of other rights contained in the phrase `without
prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in equity` in cl
5(3). On the face of it, cl 5(3) gave Allgreen Properties the right to forfeit
the 20% as well as pursue other rights they may have against HH for the breach
of contract. And, in the absence of any restrictive words in cl 5(3), these
other rights must include Allgreen Properties` right to damages (by way of
expenses in the re-sale and any drop in the sale price) should those damages
exceed the 20% forfeited by Allgreen Properties under cl 5(3).  
  
Mr Pereira attempted to overcome this difficulty by submitting that the phrase
`without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in equity`
gave Allgreen Properties the right to elect either to claim unliquidated
damages at common law without recourse to cl 5(3) or to claim the (liquidated)
damages as spelt out in cl 5(3), (b) and (c). In support of this submission,
Mr Pereira referred to three English cases that dealt with similar phrases in
Condition 19 of the Law Society`s General Conditions of Sale in England and
Condition 22 of the English National Conditions of Sale. These two conditions
are similar to Condition 29 of the Singapore Law Society` Conditions of Sale
1994. The three cases were **Talley & Anor v Wolsey-Neech** (Unreported) ;
**Wallace Turner v Cole** (Unreported) and **Sakkas & Anor v Donford Ltd**
(Unreported) . The context and content of the conditions being considered in
those cases were, however, materially different from the provisions of cl 5(3)
that we are concerned with here. The courts in those cases held that those
conditions provided for liquidated damages and that the parties, having pre-
agreed on the quantum of damages were (despite the words `without prejudice to
any other rights available to him at law or in equity`) precluded from
claiming additional amounts, not within the scope of the liquidated damages
agreed, as damages.  
  
Clause 5(3) in our present agreement does not appear to be a clause setting
out the liquidated damages payable on breach. Whilst cl 5(3) entitled Allgreen
Properties to forfeit 20% of the purchase price, it does not say, nor can it
readily be inferred from the context, that this 20% is to be treated as
liquidated damages. Indeed, cl 5(3) leaves the question of damages for breach
open because the right to forfeit the 20% is prefaced by the words `without
prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in equity`. These
words appear to have the effect of preserving the right of Allgreen Properties
to recover damages or seek other remedies at common law or in equity should
Allgreen Properties suffer damages in excess of the 20%. The effect of the
words `without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in
equity` in cl 5(3) appears to me to be that should the damages suffered by
Allgreen Properties be less than 20%, Allgreen Properties are entitled to all
of that 20% but should the damages exceed 20%, Allgreen Properties are
entitled to the additional damages.  
  
Mr Pereira also submitted that his construction of cl 5(3) would be consistent
with the legislative intent of protecting purchasers who enter into agreements
with developers. The legislature, he submitted, could not have intended that
developers could extract from purchasers damages over and above what was spelt
out in cll 5(3), (b) and (c). This, he submitted, was evident from the
revision, in 1999, of Form E of the Housing and Developers Rules which made
such legislative intent very clear.  
  
The provision equivalent to cl 5(3) in the 1999 Form E is cl 7. In the new cl
7, the words `without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or
in equity` have been deleted, a time-frame has been specified within which the
developer has to refund any balance due to the purchaser after the forfeiture
of 20% of the purchase price and it is specifically spelt out that after the
balance has been returned to the purchaser `neither party shall have further
claims against each other`.  
  
I agree with Mr Pereira that in the 1999 revision to Form E the legislature
has made it clear that the developer cannot extract from the purchaser damages
over and above 20% of the purchase price. It does not, however, follow from
that that the legislative intent in respect of cl 5(3) was the same.
Legislative intent can only be gathered from the language used in the
legislation. The words used in cl 5(3) do not support the legislative intent
which Mr Pereira seeks to uphold. The very fact that the legislature in its
new Form E made such drastic changes to cl 5(3) appears to indicate that the
legislature had changed its mind about the degree of protection it wanted to
accord to developers and was now removing the right that developers had
enjoyed of not only forfeiting the 20% but being at liberty to claim more than
the 20% if the damages they suffered exceeded the 20%. The amendments, in my
view, do not support HH`s case but support the case of Allgreen Properties
that cl 5(3) did not restrict their right to claim damages in excess of 20%
and that in order to achieve that effect cl 5(3) had to be drastically
amended.  
  
For the above reasons, I find that Allgreen Properties were entitled to make
the deductions that they did from the instalments paid by HH. HH`s claim is
therefore dismissed with costs.  
  
**Outcome:**

Plaintiff`s claim dismissed.
