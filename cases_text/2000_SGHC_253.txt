**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1 The Defendants are the owners and developers of a 7-storey flatted warehouse
at Kallang Pudding Road ("the Project"). The Plaintiffs are the main
contractors for the project.

2 In this action the Plaintiffs claim for monies due under an Architect's
certificate along with certain ancillary reliefs. In SIC 513/2000 the
Plaintiffs applied for summary judgment. The learned Assistant Registrar did
not allow the application and granted the Defendants unconditional leave to
defend the action. The Plaintiffs appealed before me and on 11 October 2000,
after hearing counsel for the parties, I allowed the appeal and made the
following orders:

> (i) Judgment for the Plaintiffs in the sum of $368,205.34 plus interest;
>
> (ii) Such judgment to be stayed pending determination of any counterclaim to
> be filed by the Defendants in respect of defective works. For the avoidance
> of doubt, the Defendants are not precluded from counterclaiming in respect
> of other matters save that the stay shall not operate in relation to those
> matters;
>
> (iii) No order as to costs here and below.

3 The Defendants have appealed against the first order giving judgment against
them in the sum of $368,205.34 plus interest and I now give my grounds of
decision.

4 On 24 June 1996 the parties entered into a contract ("the Contract") in
respect of the Project which incorporated the Singapore Institute of
Architects Conditions of Building Contract for lump sum contracts ("the SIA
Conditions"). The contract sum was $12.7 million and the contract period was
15 months from 19 July 1996. The Contract provided for nominated sub-
contractors to be appointed for certain specialised works and one of them was
Diethelm Industries Pte Ltd ("Diethelm"). They were appointed on 24 September
1996 to supply and install the aluminium cladding for the Project.

5 On 26 January 1998, the Architect issued, pursuant to clause 24(4) of the
Contract, a Completion Certificate which stated that the Project was completed
on 24 January 1998. Attached to the Completion Certificate was a schedule
("the Schedule") entitled "Minor Outstanding Works" which, under the terms of
the Contract, the Plaintiffs were to carry out before the Defendants would
release the retention monies. The certificate also stated that the 15-month
Maintenance Period under the contract would commence from the completion date
and end on 24 March 1999.

6 The dispute between the parties hinged on whether the Plaintiffs had
satisfactorily completed the "Minor Outstanding Works" set out in the
Schedule. In particular, the Defendants had numerous complaints about the
aluminium cladding installed by Diethelm. The Plaintiffs claimed that this was
because Diethelm were not co-operative in attending to the Defendants'
complaints in respect of the cladding. Although there were some other
defective works outstanding, the Defendants had themselves said in their
letter to the Plaintiffs on 8 April 1999 that Diethelm's aluminium cladding
work was the major complaint they had.

7 The Contract required the Plaintiffs to procure an on-demand performance
bond for 10% of the contract sum amounting to $1.27 million. On 8 April 1999
the Defendants called on the bond. However payment was not made pursuant to
this call because the parties agreed, at a meeting on 23 April, to settle the
matter by appointing an independent third party to identify the defects still
outstanding. The Plaintiffs would then be given a reasonable period to rectify
those defects to the satisfaction of that third party. It took another 2
months to resolve the details of this agreement but eventually the parties
agreed on and appointed Mr Chin Cheong of Building Appraisal Pte Ltd ("BAPL").
The terms of this appointment are set out in the Plaintiffs' letter of 18 June
1999 to him, which provides as follows:

> "PROPOSED ERECTION OF A ONE BLOCK OF 7-STOREY FLATTED WAREHOUSE DEVELOPMENT
> ON LOT 3633 MK 24 AT KALLANG PUDDING ROAD FOR M/S SIN YAM HUAT REALTY PTE
> LTD
>
> 1 We refer to the above project.
>
> 2 Various disagreement[s] have arisen between the respective parties on the
> work required to rectify alleged defects related to the above project.
>
> 3 As such, the parties [i.e. the owner of the building, M/s Sin Yam Huat
> Realty Pte Ltd ("Sin Yam Huat") and the main contractor M/s Soil Build Pte
> Ltd ("Soil Build")] have agreed to appoint an independent third party to
> identify and draw up a list of defects for which rectification works are
> required and to make a final assessment as to the costs of carrying out such
> work. You are hereby appointed jointly by Sin Yam Huat and Soil Build to act
> as the said third party expert.
>
> 4 The scope of your work would include the following:
>

>> a Review drawings, specifications and reports prepared by consultants.

>>

>> b Carry out a comprehensive site inspection of the alleged defects.

>>

>> c Work with the parties to prepare a list of defects.

>>

>> d Provide an opinion in respect of the "defects" or "making good" works or
make recommendations, if necessary.

>>

>> e Prepare four (4) copies of a report (including colour photographs)
encompassing the above.

>
> 5 In addition, you will be expected to draw up a reasonable time frame for
> completion of the rectification works. At the end of the stipulated time
> frame, you are to certify that the rectification works have been
> satisfactorily completed. If there are still outstanding or defective works
> at the end of the period stipulated for rectification, you are also to
> assess the cost of rectifying these defects. As third party expert, your
> decision/judgement in respect of the alleged defects will be final,
> conclusive and binding on the parties (without further recourse to court or
> arbitration proceedings).
>
> 6 Although you are jointly appointed [by] Sin Yam Huat and Soil Build,
> please note that Soil Build undertakes to pay your costs in respect of this
> matter.
>
> 7 Please confirm as soon as possible whether you will be accepting the
> appointment as third party."

8 From this letter it can be seen that the parties had agreed for BAPL to act
as a sort of an arbitrator to:

> (a) decide what constituted the defects;
>
> (b) set a reasonable period for the Plaintiffs to rectify those defects;
>
> (c) at the end of this period, determine whether the defects have been
> rectified;
>
> (d) in respect of the defects not satisfactorily rectified, assess the cost
> of rectifying them.

BAPL's decision on these matters was to be final and binding on the parties in
relation to the dispute between them under the Contract. Although it was not
expressly stated in the correspondence between the parties, it was a necessary
consequence of this agreement that the Defendants would be entitled to deduct
from the retention monies the total sum that BAPL assessed was the cost of
rectifying the defects not satisfactorily completed after the time given to
the Plaintiffs to carry out such works. It was also a necessary corollary that
thereafter the Defendants would have no further claim against the Plaintiffs
in respect of the Contract or at least in respect of those defects. I shall
refer to this as "the Settlement Agreement".

9 BAPL accepted the appointment and produced a report in August 1999. The
report contains a list of defects and stated that 4 weeks was a reasonable
period to complete the rectification works. Based on this report the
Plaintiffs undertook certain rectification works and informed BAPL of the
alleged completion of works prior to 11 November, on which date BAPL inspected
the building. In their letter of 11 November, the Plaintiffs requested BAPL to
certify the completion of the rectification works, or assess the cost of the
defects not rectified to their satisfaction in accordance with the terms of
the Settlement Agreement.

10 However the Defendants' solicitors, M/s Salem Ibrahim & Partners ("SIP")
wrote to BAPL on 15 November to say that they did not _"deem"_ the 11 November
inspection to be a _"comprehensive one, satisfactory for the purpose of [BAPL]
certifying all incomplete rectification works"_. They requested BAPL to
conduct urgently a _"comprehensive inspection"_. BAPL replied on 17 November
and, among other matters, confessed to some confusion as regards the scope of
their appointment. On 19 November the Plaintiffs' solicitors, M/s Allen &
Gledhill ("A&G") wrote to SIP and enclosed for the latter's consideration a
draft letter to BAPL to clarify the scope of work. A&G did not receive any
immediate response to this letter and on 7 December they sent the following
letter to BAPL (with a copy forwarded to SIP):

> "PROPOSED 7-STOREY WAREHOUSE AT KALLANG PUDDING ROAD
>
> We act for M/s Soil Build (Pte) Ltd
>
> We refer to your letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to M/s Salem
> Ibrahim & Partners and your letter to Soil Build Pte Ltd dated 30 November
> 1999.
>
> Your scope of work is described in detail in your letter of appointment
> dated 18 June 1999, a copy of which is enclosed for your reference.
>
> In relation to your duties pertaining to the identification of defects, you
> are (as per the letter of appointment) required, inter alia, to do the
> following:
>

>> (a) Carry out a comprehensive site inspection.

>>

>> (b) Draw up a reasonable time frame for completion of the rectification
works.

>>

>> (c) If there are still outstanding works at the end of the stipulated time
frame, assess the cost of rectifying these defects.

>
> We note that you produced a detailed expert [report] in August 1999 pursuant
> to what we had deemed to be a 'comprehensive' site inspection. You have
> therefore satisfactorily carried out your function under paragraphs (a) and
> (b) above.
>
> What remains is for you to inspect the site with a view to assessing the
> cost of rectifying outstanding defects as per (c) above. The letter of
> appointment dated 18 June 1999 is very clear in stipulating your obligation
> to make this assessment at paragraph 5 of the said letter. It is therefore
> not additional or further work as you seem to suggest. Once you have carried
> out this final task, you will be discharged of any further obligations.
>
> Please proceed with the necessary assessment of cost of rectification works
> as per the letter of appointment dated 18 June 1999."

11 In response to that letter to BAPL, SIP wrote to A&G on 8 December 1999 to
protest the manner in which the Plaintiffs had unilaterally instructed BAPL.
SIP stated that they had written an urgent letter to A&G dated 3 December in
which they had suggested convening a meeting of the various actors involved in
order to resolve the impasse. SIP reiterated that such a meeting should be
held. A&G replied to this letter on 13 December to state, among other things,
that their 7 December letter to BAPL did not contain any new instructions but
merely reminded BAPL of the express terms of their appointment. On 22
December, SIP wrote to A&G requesting to know when BAPL would be making a
final inspection of the building as the Defendants wish to have their
representatives present when this was done. This letter was copied to BAPL.
The Plaintiffs sent an urgent fax to BAPL on the same day, making reference to
SIPâ€™s letter, and asked if BAPL would wish to conduct any final inspection.
BAPL replied to the Plaintiffs on 23 December 1999 in the following manner:

> "We are in the midst of preparing a cost estimation for the proposed
> rectification works. We will not require the gondola on site. The gondola
> can be removed, please instruct accordingly."

Implicit in this response is the assertion that they would not be conducting a
final inspection.

12 On 3 January 2000, BAPL submitted their report of the cost estimates in
purported fulfilment of the terms of reference of their appointment. BAPL
assessed that the total cost of rectification was $85,580. However there was
this note appended to the report:

> "We must highlight that these are estimated costs as the only way of
> obtaining an accurate figure is by the preparation of a detailed
> specification and obtaining competitive quotations."

This enigmatic sentence was to become a further bone of contention between the
parties. On 25 January, SIP wrote to A&G and the material paragraph states as
follows:

> "Our clients do not accept the cost estimates of [BAPL] dated 3 January
> 2000. A proper estimate of the costs can only be obtained by the preparation
> of detailed specifications and obtaining quotations from parties willing to
> undertake the rectification works."

SIP stated that the Defendants reserved all their rights on the matter.

13 A&G replied on 28 January and said the following:

> "â€¦ you state that your clients do not accept the cost estimates of [BAPL]
> dated 3 January 2000. You must be aware that your clientsâ€™ position is a
> clear breach of the agreement between our respective clients to appoint an
> independent third party to, inter alia, identify and value the outstanding
> rectification works without interference from any of the parties concerned.
> We wish to remind our clients that all determinations made by the third
> party were, as agreed by our respective clients, final, conclusive and
> binding."

A&G also stated that the Plaintiffs reserved their rights in this matter.

14 On 11 February SIP, on behalf of the Defendants, made a second call on the
bond for the full sum of $1.27 million. In response the Plaintiffs took out
Suit No. 600180/2000 in which the substantive relief sought was a declaration
that the determination by BAPL on 3 January 2000 of the costs of rectification
works was valid and binding on the Defendants. At the same time the Plaintiffs
applied for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the Defendants from
receiving any payment under the bond until trial. This application came up
before me on summons day on 25 February 2000. The parties asked for a special
date to be fixed and I adjourned it accordingly. The matter then came up
before Justice Rubin on 21 March. At that hearing, counsel for the parties
informed the learned judge that the parties were in negotiation and there was
a possibility that the matter could be settled. Justice Rubin accordingly
adjourned the matter. Counsel for the parties next appeared before me on 18
April and reported that they had agreed to settle the matter by appointing a
third party Quantity Surveyor to value the outstanding rectification works. In
view of that, I adjourned the matter for another 2 months. The parties
subsequently agreed to re-appoint BAPL to undertake this work. They agreed to
the exact terms of this appointment and this is set out in A&G's letter to
BAPL dated 12 May 2000 which provides as follows:

> "We refer to your letter dated 3 January 2000 wherein you had enclosed your
> cost estimate of $85,580.00 on the incomplete defective works in respect of
> the above project.
>
> The said letter is silent as to whether your above costs estimate was done
> pursuant to a comprehensive site inspection of the above project in respect
> of outstanding defects. The parties have agreed to jointly instruct you,
> pursuant to your function as an independent third party, to undertake a
> comprehensive site inspection, and provide your final assessment of the
> value of the outstanding works based on your original report of August 1999.
>
> Although you are jointly instructed to prepare the further report by both
> Sim Yam Huat Investment Holding Pte Ltd and our clients, our clients
> undertake to pay your additional costs in respect of this matter. The terms
> of your appointment are otherwise unchanged from Soil Build's letter dated
> 18 June 1999.
>
> Please proceed to do the necessary site inspection as soon as possible. Your
> report should be completed no later than 31 May 2000."

15 BAPL reverted on 19 May and set out their proposal for undertaking the
appointment. According to this letter, this comprised:

> "A) _Scope Of Work_
>
> i) Carry out a further comprehensive site survey of the premises, on the
> 'alleged' defects;
>
> ii) Preparing a cost estimate for the necessary rectification works;
>
> iii) Inviting specialist contractors on cladding work to submit quotations
> for the necessary rectification works;
>
> iv) Providing a detail breakdown of the cost estimate on the rectification
> works;
>
> v) Prepare (4) four copies of our report of the above including all
> necessary photographs."

16 A&G replied to BAPL on 22 May to object to their defining their own scope
of works. A&G pointed out that the terms of their appointment must be strictly
in accordance with the A&G letter to BAPL of 12 May 2000 read with the
Plaintiffs' letter to BAPL of 18 June 1999. A&G also objected to BAPL's
proposal item (iii), i.e. to invite specialist contractors on cladding works
to submit quotations in order to assess the cost of their rectification.

17 BAPL then reverted with a modified proposal in which item (iii) was
omitted. However SIP wrote to A&G on 24 May to protest this "interference" by
A&G of BAPL's functions. SIP reiterated their view that a proper cost estimate
can only be done by obtaining quotations as originally proposed by BAPL and
insisted that the cost estimate be prepared on the basis of their original
proposed scope of works. A&G opposed this and the solicitors then engaged in
an exchange of correspondence which did not end in any agreement. These
letters were copied to BAPL. At one point, the Defendants sent a cheque to
BAPL for $1,700 for the additional work incurred in inviting specialist
contractors to quote for the rectification of the cladding works. However BAPL
did not accept this and on 9 June 2000 wrote to A&G as follows:

> "RE: PROPOSED 7-STOREY FLATTED WAREHOUSE AT KALLANG PUDDING ROAD: ASSESSMENT
> OF RECTIFICATION WORKS OF EXTERNAL CLADDINGS
>
> We refer to the above matter and the various correspondences between
> respective solicitors and noted the contents therein.
>
> We are in receipt of a cheque from M/s Sin Yam Huat Realty, in a sum of S$
> 1,700.00.
>
> We regret that we are unable to accept the cheque payment, as the fee
> payment of our services has been agreed.
>
> In order for our firm to expedite the report, we suggest that parties allow
> us to carry out the assessment independently.
>
> We are in the midst of completing the cost assessment of the rectification
> work and the report will be ready by the 13th June 2000."

18 In the event, BAPL proceeded with their determination of the cost estimate
and sometime in June 2000 submitted a report stating that the cost of
outstanding rectification works was $149,510, which included an estimate of
the diminution of value of a small part of the works which BAPL had concluded
was not practical to rectify. Meanwhile the Architect had, on 22 May 2000,
issued a final certificate in which he determined that the sum payable by the
Defendants to the Plaintiffs was $368,205.34 (inclusive of GST). This sum took
into account a deduction made by the Architect on the basis of his assessment
that the value of the outstanding defective works was $142,890.64. Proceeding
upon the determination by BAPL, the Plaintiffs made a demand on the Defendants
for the sum of $350,861.56 (before GST) by substituting BAPL's determination
of the cost of rectification for the Architect's. When the Defendants refused
to pay, the Plaintiffs commenced Suit 406/2000 on 23 June 2000. On 26 June,
the application in S600180/2000 for an injunction came up before me. At the
end of that hearing I granted the injunction. On 17 July 2000 both suits,
S406/2000/G and S600180/2000, were ordered to be consolidated.

19 The Plaintiffs applied, in SIC 513/2000 for, _inter alia,_ summary judgment
on 2 alternative bases:

> (a) on the valuation of works in the Architectâ€™s final certificate with the
> total sum reduced by the amount determined by BAPL to be the costs of
> rectification, alternatively;
>
> (b) on the Architectâ€™s final certificate which had already deducted a sum
> equivalent to his assessment of the cost of rectification works.

The learned Assistant Registrar heard the application on 29 September and
dismissed the application, granting the Defendants unconditional leave to
defend the action. The Plaintiffs appealed in the present appeal.

20 In respect of basis (a) above, as the Architect's certification is not
disputed, the crux of the matter is whether BAPL's assessment of $149,510 is
determinative of the dispute between the parties. It is not in dispute that
the parties have agreed to appoint BAPL to make this assessment which will be
binding on them. This is akin to an arbitration agreement on that sole issue.
Therefore the only question is whether BAPL had made the assessment in
accordance with the terms of their appointment. This would include considering
whether, in making their assessment, BAPL had been influenced in any manner by
the Plaintiffs. I found that in objecting to BAPLâ€™s proposed scope of works
set out in their letter of 19 May 2000, the Plaintiffs had interfered with the
discretion granted to BAPL to determine the matter. This is because there was
nothing in any of the 3 letters of appointment to BAPL (dated 18 June, 7
December 1999 and 12 May 2000) that constrained them to make the assessment in
a particular manner. Therefore in objecting to BAPLâ€™s proposal to call for
quotes in order for them to arrive at their assessment, the Plaintiffs had
interfered in such determination.

21 However in respect of basis (b), there is no question that the Architectâ€™s
certificate is to be given temporary finality in a Contract which adopts the
SIA Conditions. Clause 31(11) of those conditions provides as follows:

> "No certificate of the Architect under this Contract shall be final and
> binding in any dispute between the Employer and the Contractor, whether
> before an arbitrator or in the Courts, save only that, in the absence of
> fraud or improper pressure or interference by either party, full effect by
> way of Summary Judgement or Interim Award or otherwise shall, in the absence
> of express provision, be given to all decisions and certificates of the
> Architect â€¦ whether for payment or otherwise, until final judgement or
> award, as the case may be, and until such final judgement or award such
> decision or certificates shall (save as aforesaid â€¦) be binding on the
> Employer and the Contractor in relation to any manner [sic] which, under the
> terms of the Contract, the Architect has as a fact taken into account or
> allowed or disallowed, or any disputed matter upon which under the terms of
> the Contract he has as a fact ruled, in his certificates or otherwise. The
> Architect shall in all matters certify strictly in accordance with the terms
> of the Contract. In any case of doubt the Architect shall, at the request of
> either party, state in writing within 28 days whether he has as a fact taken
> account of or allowed or disallowed or ruled upon any matter in his
> certificates, if so identifying any certificate and indicating the amount
> (if any) taken into account or allowed or disallowed, or the nature of any
> ruling made by him, as the case may be."

The Defendants had made no complaints in relation to the Architectâ€™s
certificate. Therefore pending a determination which is final and binding
between the parties of the costs of the rectification works, the Plaintiffs
are entitled to have effect given to the Architectâ€™s final certificate in this
action. Accordingly, I gave judgment for the Plaintiffs in the sum of the
certificate, i.e. $368,205.34. However in view of the Defendantsâ€™ counterclaim
in respect of the rectification works, I ordered a stay of execution of the
judgment pending determination of such counterclaim.
