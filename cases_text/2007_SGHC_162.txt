Choo Han Teck J:

1 This was an application by the plaintiff, for leave to commence legal
proceedings against the defendant pursuant to s 299(2) of the Companies Act
(Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The plaintiff is the Management Corporation of a
condominium known as Carissa Park. The defendant was the main contractor in
the construction of the condominium. The defendant was placed under a
creditors’ voluntary winding up on 10 December 2004.

2 The plaintiff claimed that there were various defects in the condominium
which were caused by poor workmanship and for which it was entitled to sue the
contractor defendant for damages in tort. The defects were first noticed in
2002, but Mr Tan Yeow Hiang (“Mr Tan”), counsel for the plaintiff, submitted
that “the limitation period in respect of certain of the defects will expire
on 30 September 2007”.

3 This application was filed on 5 September 2007 and heard on 11 September
2007. Having considered the affidavits filed on behalf of the plaintiff on 5
September 2007 and 17 September 2007, and the submissions of Mr Tan and Miss
Tan Mingfen (“Miss Tan”), for the defendant (in liquidation), I dismissed the
plaintiff’s application for leave on 20 September 2007.

4 The plaintiff’s claim was estimated at $1.5m. There were no particulars as
to how much would be owing to the other general creditors who had filed their
proofs of debt. If the plaintiff was given leave to proceed, the defendant may
not have the means to defend the action and a judgment in default for $1.5m is
far too unfair, in my view, to the other creditors.

5 If the plaintiff did have a sufficiently strong claim, the application ought
to have been made much sooner. The application was made barely three weeks
before the time bar for suing. The defendant was wound up in December 2004.

6 Furthermore, Mr Tan had not disputed Miss Tan’s submission that many of the
sub-contractors’ indemnities were already assigned to the plaintiff. Many of
the defects were related to specialist sub-contractors’ work, and if there was
any liability in tort, the plaintiff will have recourse against the sub-
contractors.

7 I also formed the view that the lateness in this application was entirely
unjustifiable even though Mr Tan submitted that there was effectively no
Management Council for a great part of this year (after it had sent a letter
of demand on 9 April 2007) until 14 July 2007. The circumstances seemed to me
to indicate that the plaintiff was actuated by a desire to keep too many
options open. That is legitimate, but it must then accept the risk that some
of the options might be closed to it – such as this application, if it is
unable to persuade the court that the merits tilt in its favour for leave to
proceed.
