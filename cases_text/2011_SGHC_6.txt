Choo Han Teck J:

1 The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of tenamfetamine, a
Class A controlled drug. He was a 36-year old Korean who was entering
Singapore from Kuala Lumpur on 13 September 2010. He was given the tablets by
his friend in Kuala Lumpur and he kept them in his trouser pocket. When he was
stopped by immigration officers he readily took out the tablets and admitted
to possessing them.

2 His counsel, Mr S K Kumar, submitted that the appellant had forgotten about
the tablets when he was entering Singapore and only recalled that they were
with him when he was questioned at the immigration checkpoint. He was also a
first offender. However, two other charges were taken into consideration for
sentencing. The first concerned possession of two other Class A drugs, and the
second concerned the possession of utensils for drug consumption. The maximum
penalty for an offence under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008
Rev Ed), under which the appellant was charged, is imprisonment up to 10 years
or fine up to $20,000 or both.

3 For first time offenders on a charge similar to the one before this court, a
sentence of imprisonment may be as low as six months or less, and although the
sentence here of 8 months’ imprisonment might have been a little on the high
side given the circumstances, it was not one which could be said to be
manifestly excessive. For this reason the appeal was dismissed
