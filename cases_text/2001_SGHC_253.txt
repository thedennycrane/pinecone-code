**Judgment**

1\. Khai Wah-Ferco Pte Ltd ("the Company") was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the defendants – L&M Group Investments Ltd ("L&M"). By two Sale and Purchase
Agreements dated 3 October 1997 and 2 December 1997 (referred to together as
"the contract"), L&M sold its entire holding in the Company to the plaintiff –
Tan Hock Keng ("Tan"). The sale was on a net tangible asset ("NTA") basis and
the contract provided for adjustments to be made between the parties in
respect of trade debts not recovered within 12 months from due date (cl 14.2),
and credit notes given or received by the Company for work done, or for
supplies prior to 30 September 1997 (cll 14.3 and 14.4). Clause 16.1, set out
below, limited L&M’s total liability to Tan for all claims of any kind to the
Consideration Sum:

> "The parties hereby agree that the total liability of the Vendor for all
> claims of any kind whether in contract, warranty, indemnity, tort, strict
> liability or otherwise, arising out of the performance or breach of this
> Agreement or any of the terms herein shall not exceed the Consideration Sum
> as determined in accordance with Clause 4.1 …"

The Consideration Sum referred to in cl 16.1 was S$285,900.

2\. At the time of the share transfer the Company owed a considerable sum of
money - an amount in excess of S$5 million - to L&M, its parent company. The
contract, in cl 15.1, required Tan to procure that the Company repaid these
intercompany loans. It will be necessary to consider this clause in detail and
I therefore set it out in full:

"The Purchaser shall procure that the Company repays the Intercompany Loans as
free of interest over 12 instalments commencing on 15 April 1999 and on every
anniversary thereafter (the ‘repayment date’) at a principal sum of thirty
percent (30%) of the Company’s consolidated net profit after tax or
S$220,000.00 per annum, whichever is the higher, and in any event on the
twelfth and final repayment date the Purchaser shall procure that the Company
shall repay all balance outstanding Intercompany Loans to the Vendor in one
lump sum. In consideration of the Vendor agreeing to a repayment of the
Intercompany Loans over 12 annual instalments, the Purchaser shall procure
that THK REALTY PTE LTD shall deliver to the Vendor the duly executed and
stamped Guarantee."

3\. L&M disputed any liability to Tan under the provisions of cl 14\. In the
event L&M was held liable, L&M sought to limit that liability by invoking cl
16.1. Tan, however, disputed the applicability of cl 16.1 to cl 14. It was
submitted on behalf of Tan that it was the intention of the parties, in view
of the Consideration Sum having been arrived at on an NTA basis, that cl 16.1
was only - to use the words of Mr Tan Bar Tien ("Mr BT Tan) who appeared for
Tan - "a reference clause" that was intended by the parties to be operational
only if specifically invoked in the other clauses in the contract.

4\. The claims against L&M under cl 14 related to transactions with various
customers and the documentation relating thereto was voluminous. In the course
of the hearing, counsel for L&M, Mr Chia Chor Leong, at the invitation of the
court, indicated that if the court ruled that cl 16.1 had the effect of
limiting his clients’ liability to the Consideration Sum, his clients would
accept liability up to that sum. I therefore suggested that even though we
were only about mid-way through the trial, the parties make their submission
on the applicability of cl 16.1 to cl 14 and that further evidence relating to
the details of the claims against L&M under cl 14 would be gone into only if
the court rules that cl 16.1 does not affect cl 14. Both parties agreed to
this suggestion.

5\. Mr BT Tan – in support of his submission that cl 16.1 was only a reference
clause and therefore inapplicable to cl 14 because there was nothing in cl 14
that invoked cl 16 – wished to refer to previous drafts of the contract that
had been prepared by M/s Haridass Ho & Partners, the firm of solicitors who
had acted for both parties in this sale and purchase. Mr Chia, relying on ss
94, 95 and 96 of the Evidence Act, objected to any reference to any extrinsic
material in the construction of the contract. Mr BT Tan submitted that such
extrinsic evidence was admissible under s 94(f) of the Evidence Act.

6\. Section 94(f) of the Evidence Act reads as follows:

> "94. When the terms of such contract, grant or other disposition of
> property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a
> document, have been proved according to section 93, _no evidence of any oral
> agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such
> instrument or their representatives in interest for the purpose of
> contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms subject to
> the following provisions_ :

…

(f) any fact may be proved which shows in what matter the language of a
document is related to existing facts."

(Emphasis added.)

The effect of adopting the submission of Mr BT Tan would be that cl 16.1 would
not have the general application which, on its face, it clearly had. Instead,
a proviso would have to be read into cl 16.1 to the effect that cl 16.1 would
apply only if specifically invoked by other clauses in the contract. Evidence
that that was what the parties had agreed to was clearly prohibited under s 94
unless the matter fell into one of the provisos to s 94, in this case (on the
submission of Mr BT Tan) proviso (f). Mr BT Tan did not refer me to any
decided case that supported his contention. He was content merely to read out
the entire commentary on s 94(f) given in _Butterworths’ Annotated Statutes of
Singapore_ (Vol 5; 1997 issue).

7\. Mr Chia, in his submissions, pointed out that that commentary in
_Butterworths_ , far from supporting Mr BT Tan’s submission, in fact negated
it. Mr Chia pointed out that the very first paragraph of the said commentary
on s 94(f) in _Butterworths_ stated:

"This proviso is, strictly speaking, providing for the _interpretation_ of a
contract, grant or other disposition. Although it might have been grouped with
the rules of interpretation which are laid down in the ensuing sections, it
has been treated as a proviso to the principle of conclusiveness set out in s
94. _It seems, therefore, that this proviso enacts that interpretation of the
terms which have been reduced to writing is not varying, contradicting, adding
to or subtracting from the written terms_ and opens the way to the more
elaborate rules of interpretation laid down in the ensuing section."

(Emphasis added.)

This first paragraph itself, Mr Chia submitted, made it clear that s 94(f) of
the Evidence Act comes into play only when a word or phrase is unclear and the
court has to interpret or ascertain what that word or phrase means. The
commentary in _Butterworths_ , he pointed out, was not mandating the wholesale
reference to extrinsic evidence in construing a contract.

8\. Mr Chia pointed out that in the present case, Mr BT Tan had not alleged
that there was doubt about any word or phrase used in cl 16.1. Mr Chia
submitted that the meaning of every word used in cl 16.1 was clear and
unambiguous and that, in that scenario, s 94(f) cannot be invoked to let in
extrinsic evidence. In support of his submission, Mr Chia quoted a number of
English authorities. I need only refer to the following.

9\. In _Great Western Railway and Midland Railway v Bristol Corporation_[1918]
87 Ch.D 414, the court was concerned with the meaning to be attributed to the
word "traffic" in an agreement made between the Bristol Corporation and
railway companies wherein rates were payable on excess traffic. The issue was
whether extrinsic evidence was admissible to explain what the parties intended
by the word "traffic". What Lord Shaw said at page 424 is apposite:

"The question is: What does the word ‘traffic’ or what does the expression
‘traffic taken by or delivered to the companies respectively’ mean?

In the first place, I desire to express my opinion that the word and
expression quoted do not appear to me to be ambiguous. _There being no
ambiguity I am accordingly further of opinion_ , speaking for myself, _that it
was not competent to introduce a reference to facts, history, and
circumstances for the purpose of specialising, modifying, or restricting the
unambiguous terms of the agreement of partie_ s. I assent to the view that, if
from other parts of the contract, it could be shown that a special or
restricted meaning was given to the word ‘traffic’, or if in those other parts
the word ‘traffic’ was so employed as to render it doubtful in what sense the
term was used in clause 6, then the contract read as a whole might make
evidence _dehors_ the contract admissible for light upon interpretation. There
is, however – the term being in clause 6 unambiguous – no obscurity cast upon
it by other parts of the agreement, and, in my view, nothing accordingly for
outside history or facts to clear up."

(Emphasis added.)

and at the same page, in a later paragraph, Lord Shaw said:

"_The simple and familiar rule_ , as Lord Campbell pointed out in _MacDonald v
Longbottom_ … _is that evidence is not admissible to contradict a document but
solely to interpret it_. It may have a special, commercial or mercantile or
technical meaning, and to deny such a meaning to it in the circumstances in
which – or with reference to which – it was used, would be to make it express
something else than the words were set down for. But the rule is used with a
dangerous elasticity in practice whenever by outside evidence it is sought to
introduce some intention of the writer which has been disclosed by any other
than the authorised channel – namely, the words which he himself selected."

(Emphasis added.)

In that same page, Lord Shaw very lucidly states the function of a court in
interpreting a contractual provision. In his words:

"… Courts of law when on the work of interpretation are not engaged upon the
task or study of what parties intended to do, but of what the language which
they employ shows that they did: in other words, they are not constructing a
contract on the lines of what may be thought to have been what the parties
intended, but they are construing the words and expressions used by the
parties themselves. What do these mean? That when ascertained is the meaning
to be given effect to, the meaning of the contract by which the parties are
bound. The suggestion of an intention of parties different from the meaning
conveyed by the words employed is no part of interpretation, but is mere
confusion."

10\. In _Prenn v Simmonds_ [1971] 1 WLR 1381, Lord Wilberforce who dealt with
an attempt to introduce into evidence for the purpose of construing a contract
the previous drafts of that contract, had this to say at page 1384:

> "… the present case illustrates very well the disadvantages and danger of
> departing from established doctrine and the virtue of the latter. There were
> prolonged negotiations between solicitors, with exchanges of draft clauses,
> ultimately emerging in clause 2 of the agreement. The reason for not
> admitting evidence of these exchanges is not a technical one or even mainly
> one of convenience, (though the attempt to admit it did greatly prolong the
> case and add to its expense). It is simply that such evidence is unhelpful.
> By the nature of things, where negotiations are difficult, the parties’
> positions, with each passing letter, are changing and until the final
> agreement, though converging, still divergent. It is only the final document
> which records a consensus. If the previous documents used different
> expressions, how does construction of those expressions, itself a doubtful
> process, help on the construction of the contractual words? If the same
> expressions are used, nothing is gained by looking back; indeed something
> may be lost since the relevant surrounding circumstances may be different.
> And at this stage there is no consensus of the parties to appeal to."

11\. The Evidence Act is an enactment that codifies the Law of Evidence as it
applies to Singapore. The position under the English common law may not
therefore reflect the law of evidence as it applies to Singapore. The
provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, on which Act our Evidence Act is based,
are – in relation to the exclusion of oral evidence by documentary evidence -
in pari materia with the relevant provisions in our Act. It will therefore be
useful to look at how the equivalent provision in the Indian Act has been
dealt with.

12\. The commentary in Sarkar on _Evidence_ (14th Ed) in relation to proviso
(6) of s 92 of the Indian Evidence Act (the equivalent of our s 94(f) reads
(at page 1282) as follows:

> "This is the last of the proviso to this section and is expressed in very
> general terms. This is really a rule regarding the interpretation or
> construction of documents, and it embodies one of its principal canons.
> Wherever a court has to deal with a document which has been proved, its
> object is to endeavour to ascertain its real meaning, and for this purpose
> extrinsic evidence is sometimes necessary. So the proviso says that ‘any
> fact may be proved which shows in what manner the language of a document is
> related to existing facts’. _The object of the admissibility of the evidence
> of surrounding circumstances is to ascertain the real intentions of the
> parties, but those intentions must be gathered from the language of the
> document as explained by the extrinsic evidence. No evidence of any
> intention inconsistent with the plain meaning of the words used will be
> admitted, for the object is not to vary the language used, but merely to
> explain the sense in which the words are used by the parties_. This rule of
> interpretation is not so easy as it may appear, and it is not possible to
> define its precise limits in view of the ever changing facts involved in
> every case. Generally speaking, in case of ambiguity or doubt as to its
> meaning extrinsic evidence of intimately connected existing facts or
> surrounding circumstances may be given in order to find out the real nature
> of the transaction in the document."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

And at page 1283, Sarkar summarises the position as follows:

> "Prov (6) comes into play when there is latent ambiguity in a document, ie
> when its language is not _prima facie_ consistent with the existing facts,
> or in other words, when there is a conflict between the plain meaning of the
> language used and the facts existing or when put together they lead to an
> ambiguity … _If the language employed is ambiguous and admits of a variety
> of meaning, the 6 th proviso can be invoked. The object of admissibility of
> such evidence is to assist the Court to get the real intention of the
> parties and thereby overcome the difficulty caused by the ambiguity_."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

Sarkar at page 1283 adverts to the link between proviso 7 to s 92 (of the
Indian Act) and the subsequent sections of the Act. He states:

> "Its application (ie the application of proviso 6 to s 92) will appear from
> the provisions of ss 93-98. When the language is on the face ambiguous or
> defective, extrinsic evidence is not admissible (s 93), for admission of
> such evidence would not be interpreting a contract, but making a new one.
> Such a course would be upholding a document which is void for uncertainty.
> _When the language is plain in itself or unambiguous and when it applies
> accurately to existing facts, extrinsic evidence is also inadmissible (s
> 94). To do so would be to allow the parties to show that they meant
> something different from what they have plainly expressed, and to alter the
> document_. Parol evidence is in no case admissible to alter or vary the
> terms of a written instrument.
>
> (Emphasis added.)

13\. The s 94 referred to in Sarkar is identical to s 96 of our Act. Section
96 of our Act reads:

> "When language used in a document is plain in itself and when it applies
> accurately to existing facts, evidence may not be given to show that it was
> not meant to apply to such facts."

Clause 16.1 is very clear in its terms. It does not, on the face of it,
purport to be merely a "reference clause". Section 96 would therefore preclude
the admission of any evidence designed to show that cl 16.1 was meant to have
effect only as a reference clause.

14\. On the strength of the above authorities, I was satisfied that the
extrinsic evidence (including the previous drafts of the contract) that Mr BT
Tan was seeking to rely on to establish the underlying intention of cl 16.1 of
the contract was inadmissible in evidence and I so ruled.

15\. The next question that had to be resolved was whether there was any
substance in Mr BT Tan’s submission that cl 16.1 had no application to cl 14
because cl 14 did not, in terms, invoke cl 16. In support of that submission,
Mr BT Tan pointed out other clauses in the contract, such as cll 6, 7 and 10,
which specifically make themselves subject to cl 16. He submitted that it was
because the parties had intended that cl 14 should not be subject to cl 15
that those words were not incorporated into cl 14.

16\. I saw no merit in that submission. Clause 16 clearly and unambiguously
states that the total liability of the vendor (ie L&M) arising out of the
performance or breach of any term of contract shall not exceed the
Consideration Sum. That restriction is worded in such wide language that it
clearly will restrict any liability attaching to L&M under cl 14. The fact
that other clauses may have specifically invoked cl 16 does not detract from
this fact and cannot form a basis for me to conclude that cl 16.1 was to be
only a "reference clause".

17\. Mr BT Tan further submitted that cl 14 was repugnant to cl 16 and the
parties could not have intended cl 16.1 to override cl 14. It would be
relevant, in considering that submission, to refer to what Lord Bingham stated
in _Pagnan SpA v Tradax Ocean Transportation SA_ [1987] 2 All ER 565 at 574b:

> "It is commonplace of documentary construction that an apparently wide and
> absolute provision is subject to limitation, modification or qualification
> by other provisions. That does not make the later provisions inconsistent or
> repugnant."

I saw no repugnancy between cll 14 and 16.1. I therefore ruled that the
limitation of liability provided under cl 16.1 would apply to any liability
that L&M may have under cl 14.

18\. In the light of the above ruling and in the light of the fact that L&M
had agreed to accept liability under cl 14 up to the Consideration Sum (ie
S$285,900), there was no need to hear further evidence relating to such
liability.

19\. L&M had counterclaimed against Tan for the sum of $751,504.13. Included
within this sum was the sum of $440,000 being two instalments of $220,000 each
that were due from the Company to L&M in payment of the outstanding
intercompany loan of some S$5 million.

20\. As noted in paragraph 2 above, Tan had, in cl 15.1 of the contract,
undertaken that he would procure the repayment of that loan. In effect, Tan
had, by cl 15.1, agreed to do the following:

> (a) Procure that the Company repay the intercompany loan in 12 instalments
> commencing 15 April 1999 of $220,000 per annum.
>
> (b) On the last instalment date, procure that the Company repay the entire
> balance of the intercompany loans.
>
> (c) Procure that THK Realty Pte Ltd (which was the family holding company of
> Tan) shall deliver to L&M a guarantee that the intercompany loans will be
> repaid.

Mr BT Tan conceded that, except in respect of the two instalments of the
intercompany loans claimed (totalling $440,000), his client accepted liability
on the balance of the $751,504.13 sought in the counterclaim. Mr BT Tan
disputed liability for the instalments on the grounds that his client’s
obligation under cl 15.1 was only to procure that the Company pay the
instalments: his client had not, by the terms of cl 15.1, undertaken personal
liability to pay the instalments should the Company fail to pay.

21\. The key words in cl 15 were as follows:

> "The Purchaser shall procure that the Company repays the Intercompany Loans
> … "

Both Mr Chia and Mr BT Tan referred to _Black’s Law Dictionary_ for the
meaning of the word "procure". The definition in _Black’s_ was adopted in a
case referred to me by Mr Chia (_The People of the State of New York v Davan
Executive Services Inc_ , 411 NYS 2d 532 at 534 where the judge held:

> " The term ‘procure’, interpreted according to its clear and logical tenor,
> means ‘to cause a thing to do done; to instigate; to contrive, bring about,
> effect or cause’. "

In _Chambers (21 st Century Dictionary)_ the meaning is given as:

> "to manage to obtain something or bring it about"

Mr Chia submitted that by agreeing to cl 15, Tan was under an obligation to
ensure that the Company paid the instalments to L&M. The fact that the Company
did not repay the two instalments meant that Tan had breached his obligations
to L&M to procure these payments and was liable to damages for that breach.
The quantum of damages, Mr Chia submitted, would be the same as the
instalments not paid.

22\. Mr BT Tan submitted that the word "procure" does not connote an
undertaking to pay the money himself. All that Tan had agreed to do in cl 15,
he submitted, was to cause the Company to pay. He submitted that if it was
intended by the parties that there should be a personal liability on Tan to
pay, clearer words would be called for. In support of this submission, Mr BT
Tan relied on the following passage from Phillips and O’Donovan _"The Modern
Contract of Guarantee_ ", 2nd Ed, at page 18:

> "To support a guarantee they (ie the words used) must amount to a firm
> undertaking to pay if the principal debtor defaults."

Mr BT Tan did not dispute that Tan was in breach of cl 15 in failing to
procure that the Company paid the instalments but submitted that as Tan had
not undertaken a personal liability to pay if the Company failed to pay, Tan
would be liable to L&M only in damages for such losses arising from that
breach that L&M could prove. In assessing such damages, he submitted, the
court would have to take into account such amounts as may have been retrieved
by L&M had L&M taken steps to mitigate its loss.

23\. Mr Chia, relying on the House of Lords decision in the case of _Moschi v
Lep Air Services Ltd & Ors _[1973] AC 331, submitted that a personal
undertaking to pay was but one of two possible ways in which the payment of a
debt can be guaranteed. In that case, Lep Air were forwarding agents for goods
imported by a company known as Rolloswin Investments Ltd which was controlled
by one Gabriel Moschi. In a tripartite agreement entered into between Lep Air,
Rolloswin and Mr Moschi for payments by Rolloswin of sums due to Lep Air, Mr
Moschi had (to quote the words used in cl XIII of the agreement):

> "… personally guaranteed the performance by Rolloswin Investments Limited of
> its obligation to make the payments at the rate of 6,000 per week together
> with the final payment of 4,000 as hereinbefore set out so however that Mr
> Moschi’s total obligation under this guarantee shall not exceed the total
> sum of 40,000 …".

Rolloswin failed to pay the instalments agreed upon and on 22 December 1967
Lep Air brought the agreement to pay by instalments to an end on the grounds
of fundamental breach. Rolloswin subsequently went into liquidation and Lep
Air sued Mr Moschi under the guarantee contained in the tripartite agreement.

24\. One of the arguments raised by Mr Moschi was that in cl XIII he merely
guaranteed that each instalment of 6,000 shall be paid. It was Mr Moschi’s
case that, since by reason of Lep Air accepting the repudiation of the
contract by Rolloswin, the contract had been brought to an end, the later
instalments were no longer payable and the only claim that Lep Air had against
Rolloswin was for damages. It was argued for Mr Moschi that he was not liable
for the claim against Rolloswin for damages as that was not a claim guaranteed
by Mr Moschi. It was argued for Mr Moschi that if the creditor chooses or acts
in such a way that future instalments were not payable by the debtor, the
creditor cannot recover these instalments from Mr Moschi.

25\. To meet this argument, it was first necessary for the House of Lords to
determine what exactly Mr Moschi had undertaken to do. It is interesting to
note that Lord Reid prefaced that task by saying:

> "I would not proceed by saying this is a contract of guarantee and there is
> a general rule applicable to all guarantees. Parties are free to make any
> agreement they like and we must I think determine just what this agreement
> means."

Lord Reid then went on to say that in making good to the creditor payments of
instalments by the principal debtor there were at least two possible forms of
agreement. He summarised these two forms (at pages 344 and 345) as follows:

> (a) A person might undertake no more than that if the principal debtor fails
> to pay any instalment he will pay it. That would be a conditional agreement.
> There would be no prestable obligation unless and until the debtor failed to
> pay. There would then on the debtor's failure arise an obligation to pay. If
> for any reason the debtor ceased to have any obligation to pay the
> instalment on the due date then he could not fail to pay it on that date.
> The condition attached to the undertaking would never be purified and the
> subsidiary obligation would never arise.
>
> (b) On the other hand, the guarantor’s obligation might be of a different
> kind. He might _undertake_ that the principal debtor will carry out his
> contract. Then if at any time and for any reason the principal debtor acts
> or fails to act as required by his contract, he not only breaks his own
> contract but he also puts the guarantor in breach of his contract of
> guarantee. Then the creditor can sue the guarantor, not for the unpaid
> instalment but for damages. His contract being that the principal debtor
> would carry out the principal contract, the damages payable by the guarantor
> must then be the loss suffered by the creditor due to the principal debtor
> having failed to do what the guarantor undertook that he would do.

Lord Reid considered the _Moschi_ contract to be one that fell within (b)
above.

26\. Having set out the above classification, Lord Reid went on to say:

> "In my view, the appellant’s contract is of the latter type. He ‘personally
> guaranteed the performance’ by the company ‘of its obligation to make the
> payments at the rate of 6,000 per week.’ The rest of the clause does not
> alter that obligation. So he was in breach of his contract as soon as the
> company fell into arrears with its payment of the instalments. The
> guarantor, the appellant, then became liable to the creditor, the
> respondents, in damages. Those damages were the loss suffered by the
> creditor by reason of the company’s breach. It is not and could not be
> suggested that by accepting the company’s repudiation the creditor in any
> way increased his loss. The creditor lost more than the maximum which the
> appellant guaranteed and it appears to me that the whole loss was caused by
> the debtor having failed to carry out his contract. That being so, the
> appellant became liable to pay as damages for his breach of contract of
> guarantee the whole loss up to the maximum of 40,000."

Having made the above analysis, Lord Reid went on to say that he would not
refer in detail to the authorities on the matter as it never seemed to have
been necessary to make a full analysis of the position of a contract of this
kind – but noted that the cases show that there was no magic in the word
"guarantee" and that most contracts of guarantee fall within (b). He concluded
his judgment by stating:

> "The appellant as guarantor had undertaken that the company would carry out
> its contract so the damages which the company have not paid were part of the
> loss flowing from the appellant’s breach of contract for which the appellant
> is liable."

27\. Lord Diplock, in his speech, took a similar view. He stated at page 348A:

> "By the beginning of the 19th century it appears to have been taken for
> granted, without need for any citation of authority, that the contractual
> promise of a guarantor to guarantee the performance by a debtor of his
> obligations to a creditor arising out of contract gave rise to an obligation
> on the part of the guarantor to _see to it_ that the debtor performed his
> own obligations to the creditor.
>
> …
>
> It is because the obligation of the guarantor is to _see to it_ that the
> debtor performed his own obligations to the creditor that the guarantor is
> not entitled to notice from the creditor of the debtor’s failure to perform
> an obligation which is the subject of the guarantee, and that the creditor’s
> cause of action against the guarantor arises at the moment of the debtor’s
> default and the limitation period then starts to run."
>
> …
>
> It follows from the legal nature of the obligation of the guarantor to which
> a contract of guarantee gives rise that it is not an obligation himself to
> pay a sum of money to the creditor, but an obligation _to see to_ it that
> another person, the debtor, does something; and that the creditor’s remedy
> for the guarantor’s failure to perform it lies in damages for breach of
> contract only."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

And at page 349A he goes on to say:

> "The legal consequence of this is that whenever the debtor has failed
> voluntarily to perform an obligation which is the subject of the guarantee
> the creditor can recover from the guarantor as damages for breach of his
> contract whatever sum the creditor could have recovered from the debtor

28\. When Tan agreed to "procure" that the Company repays the intercompany
loans, he was in effect saying, that he – to use the language used by Lord
Reid – "undertook" that the Company would carry out its contract or – to use
the words of Lord Diplock – Tan had by cl 15 agreed to "see to it" that the
Company would carry out its contract. Mr BT Tan submitted that _Moschi’s_ case
can be distinguished. He submitted that in that case it was not in dispute
that Mr Moschi had, in the tripatrite agreement, in so many words guaranteed
that Rolloswin would perform its obligation. In the present case, however,
there was no reference to any guarantee in cl 15. Mr BT Tan submitted that in
_Moschi’s_ case the fact that the document was in terms a guarantee was
accepted and what the court was concerned with was how to interpret that
guarantee in the light of the facts of that case.

29\. The lack of the word "guarantee" in cl 15 does not, in my view, detract
from the obligation imposed by that clause on Tan. It is relevant, in this
context, to note the statement by Lord Reid (referred to in paragraph 26
above) that there was no magic in the word "guarantee" and that parties are
free to make any agreements that they like and it is for the court to
determine just what the agreement means. The undertaking of Tan that he would
"procure" that the Company paid its intercompany loans imposed an obligation
on Tan to ensure or see to it that the Company paid off the loans. Tan did not
deliver on this obligation. He was therefore in breach of cl 15. The question
therefore arises as to what the measure of damages for that breach of
obligation should be.

30\. Mr Chia, relying on the passages in the _Moschi_ case quoted above
submitted that the damages payable would be the total instalment payments due
to L&M from the Company in respect of the intercompany loans the payment of
which Tan had failed to procure. Mr BT Tan did not dispute that failure by the
Company to pay the instalments agreed to in respect of the intercompany loans
constituted a breach by Tan of his obligation in cl 15 to "procure" that the
Company repaid its intercompany loans but submitted that the measure of
damages would not be the instalments that the Company had defaulted in paying
but would be of an amount that the court would have to assess bearing in mind
the duty of the party claiming compensation to mitigate its loss. Mr BT Tan
pointed out that there was no evidence of L&M having taken any proceedings
against the Company to recover the outstandings.

31\. If that submission by Mr BT Tan is upheld, the effect would be that the
obligation that Tan had taken upon himself in cl 15 to procure that the
intercompany loans are paid to L&M would be shifted from Tan to L&M. Such a
result would be a negation of cl 15 and for that reason I reject it. It is
also established law that a plaintiff need not take steps to recover
compensation for his loss from parties who, in addition to the defendant, are
liable to him (see _McGregor on Damages_ , 16th Ed, paragraph 329). Following
the reasoning of Lord Reid in the _Moschi_ case set out in paragraph 26 above
and the approach taken by Lord Diplock at page 349A of the report (quoted in
paragraph 27 above), I am of the view that the proper basis for the assessment
of damages payable by Tan for the breach of his obligation under cl 15 would
be the amount that was due from the Company to L&M. In this case, at the time
of the writ, two instalments were outstanding and the amount was $440,000.

32\. L&M have, in this case, admitted liability to the plaintiff’s claims
under cl 14 to the sum of $285,900. Tan’s only dispute on L&M’s counterclaim
of $751.504.13 was as to his liability in respect of the instalments
(totalling $440,000) payable by the Company. On this I have ruled that Tan is
liable for the said sum under cl 15 of the Agreement. L&M therefore succeed in
their counterclaim. Giving credit for the $285,900 admitted by L&M the net
result is that there is a sum of $465,604.13 due from Tan to L&M and I grant
judgment in favour of L&M for the said amount with costs (of both claim and
counterclaim).
