Choo Han Teck J:

1 The accused was a 32-year old Malaysian. He drove to Singapore on 12 January
2009 and arrived at the Woodlands Checkpoint about 4.55pm. His car JKQ 7274
was searched and 142.41g of diamorphine were found in ten packets wrapped in
plastic. Five of the packets were found under the driver’s seat and another
five were found in the haversack found on the floorboard behind the driver’s
seat.

2 The prosecution adduced evidence to show that the ten packets contained
142.41g of diamorphine. The accused did not challenge the scientific evidence
and the defence was that the accused thought that he was carrying “ice”, the
colloquial term for methamphetamine, which is a different drug from
diamorphine.

3 The prosecution adduced one contemporaneous statement by the accused and
recorded by Senior Staff Sergeant Koh Yew Fie (“SSSgt Koh”) on 12 January
2009, and six other statements recorded by Woman Inspector Wong Jin Shan Agnes
on 14 January 2009, 15 January 2009, 16 January 2009 (two statements) and 16
September 2009. The accused only challenged the admissibility of the statement
recorded by SSSgt Koh. He claimed that the statement was not voluntarily given
because SSSgt Koh falsely induced him to admit that he knew that he was
carrying diamorphine. The statement referred to the diamorphine as “Beh Hoon”,
the common term for heroin, but the accused denied knowing that. I disbelieved
him and his account of what happened between him and SSSgt Koh because it was
neither convincing nor coherent. Furthermore, the accused claimed that he gave
the statement after he was told by SSSgt Koh “ _if you want to enjoy you must
live with the consequences_ ”. His testimony did not convince me that this led
to a weakening of his resolve such that he gave answers to SSSgt Koh’s
questions which he would not have done so otherwise. He was also inconsistent
as to when this remark by SSSgt Koh was made. The accused’s second assertion
was that SSSgt Koh told him that he (SSSgt Koh) would speak to the judge and
get the court to sentence the accused to “8 to 10” years imprisonment only.
The evidence of the accused on this point was weak, and even if I found that
this was true, he admitted that such a statement was only said once and that
it was made after he had already given the answers. Consequently, I admitted
the statement as I was satisfied that it was not made under any threat,
inducement, or promise.

4 The accused’s defence was that he had no knowledge that the ten packets
contained heroin. He asserted that only one packet was opened and he had no
idea that the other nine contained the same white powdery substance. He
claimed that he believed he was carrying “ice”, a different drug from
diamorphine. He said that he used to smoke “ice” in Malaysia and he had been
enticed into smoking it by his supplier. Counsel for the accused submitted
that he accused was a gullible person. He did not, however, seem so to me. The
evidence given by the accused was very thin and did not raise any doubt in my
mind that he knew that he was carrying diamorphine. Additionally, he failed to
give a reasonable explanation as to why he did not say in his s 122(6)
statement that he thought he was carrying diamorphine. Instead, he said that
he had nothing to say.

5 For the reasons above, I was satisfied that the accused knew that he was
carrying diamorphine in the ten packets seized from him on the day of his
arrest. I therefore found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to suffer
death.
