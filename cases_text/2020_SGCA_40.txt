Court of Appeal — Originating Summons No 12 of 2020  
Judith Prakash JA, Tay Yong Kwang JA and Steven Chong JA

24 April 2020

Steven Chong JA (delivering the judgment of the court):

1 The applicant, Mr Goel Adesh Kumar, filed CA/OS 12/2020 seeking to vary this
court’s orders in CA/CA 21/2018 (“CA 21/2018”) pursuant to its inherent
jurisdiction. The applicant submitted that the costs orders made against him
in CA 21/2018 were in error. Having considered the parties’ submissions, we
find that although the costs orders against the applicant in CA 21/2018 were
in fact premised on two incorrect assumptions, ultimately they would not
affect the basis on which the costs orders were made. We therefore dismiss the
application. We now explain our reasons for doing so.

2 In HC/S 484/2013 (“the Suit”), the applicant brought a claim against the
respondent, Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd, for false imprisonment, assault
and battery. Alleged participants in these torts included auxiliary police
officers employed by SATS Security Services Pte Ltd (“SATS”). As such, the
respondent joined SATS as a third party. In [2015] SGHC 289 (“the Liability
Judgment”), the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) found in favour of the
applicant, and awarded him damages in the sum of $45,915.74. The Judge,
however, rejected the majority of the sums the applicant claimed, which were
for loss of earnings and aggravated and exemplary damages. It should be stated
that the applicant’s aggregate claim was for the sum of $484,196.16. The Judge
found the respondent liable for 80% of the award of damages, and SATS liable
for 20%. However, since the applicant did not bring any claim against SATS, he
could only recover against the respondent for its 80% share of the award,
which amounted to $36,732.59. The applicant’s appeal in CA/CA 215/2015 to
increase the award of damages was dismissed by this court.

3 The Judge set out his decision on costs in [2017] SGHC 43. We allowed the
respondent’s appeal against the Judge’s costs orders in CA/CA 127/2017 and
dismissed the applicant’s appeal against those orders in CA/CA 21/2018. We did
not disturb the costs orders relevant to the present application. They are
(see Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Goel Adesh Kumar and another appeal
[2018] 2 SLR 1070 (“the CA Costs Judgment”) at [38]):

(a) The respondent shall pay the applicant’s costs incurred in the Suit on a
standard basis on the Magistrate’s Court scale up to 2 July 2014.

(b) The applicant shall pay the respondent’s costs incurred in the Suit on an
indemnity basis on the High Court scale from 2 July 2014.

4 The reason for these orders was the offer to settle made to the applicant by
the respondent and SATS jointly on 2 July 2014 (“the First Offer”). The First
Offer was for $62,000 with parties to bear their own costs. Subsequently, on
17 September 2014, the respondent and SATS made another joint offer to settle
for $100,000, but with no provision for costs (“the Second Offer”). The
applicant did not accept either offer, and the Suit proceeded for trial on 30
June 2015.

5 The costs consequences of the applicant’s rejection of the offers to settle
are set out in O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed),
which provides:

(3) Where an offer to settle made by a defendant —

(a) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in
respect of which the offer to settle is made; and

(b) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not
more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,

the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer
was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from
that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.

6 As we explained in the CA Costs Judgment, the costs orders set out at [3]
above followed from the application of O 22A r 9(3) to the facts:

(a) It was undisputed that the applicant had rejected the First Offer, and
that the offer was not withdrawn before the end of the Suit on liability (at
[18]).

(b) The judgment sum of $45,915.74 would not be more favourable than the First
Offer of $62,000, even taken together with the costs incurred by the applicant
up to the date of the First Offer (at [19]).

(i) These costs should be calculated on the Magistrate’s Court scale by virtue
of s 39(1)(b) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed), since the award
in the applicant’s favour was below the Magistrate’s Court limit, and there
were no additional grounds for commencing the Suit in the High Court (at
[19(a)]).

(ii) The relevant costs would be unlikely to exceed $16,084.26 (being the
difference between $62,000 and $45,915.74), since the scale of costs for
completed Magistrates’ Court cases leading to an award of $40,000 to $60,000
was between $5,000 and $18,000, and as of 2 July 2014, the Suit was far from
being close to completion (at [19(b)]).

(c) There was no reason to depart from the general rule in O 22A r 9(3) since
the First Offer was reasonable, serious and genuine (at [20]–[25]).

7 Following the CA Costs Judgment, the costs to be paid by the respondent to
the applicant (ie, the costs at [3(a)] above) were taxed in HC/BC 59/2019 (“BC
59/2019”). On 7 February 2020, the Assistant Registrar awarded the applicant
costs as follows:

(a) Section 1 (legal costs): $15,000

(b) Section 2 (costs of taxation): $2,500

(c) Section 3 (disbursements): $3,882.22

To date, there has been no application to review this decision.

8 The upshot of BC 59/2019 is that the costs incurred by the applicant up to
the date of the First Offer were in fact $18,882.22 (the sum of the legal
costs and disbursements awarded). That this sum should be included in the
calculation of the “judgment” obtained by the plaintiff for the purposes of O
22A r 9(3)(b) of the Rules of Court, in relation to an “all-in” offer to
settle inclusive of costs, was established by this court in NTUC Foodfare Co-
operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another [2018] 2 SLR 1043 (see
[25(c)(i)] and [29(a)]). As such, our earlier assumption that such costs would
not exceed $16,084.26 (see [6(b)(ii)] above) turns out to be inaccurate.

9 This is a potentially significant inaccuracy, owing to the fact that “once
it was shown that the offer was less than the judgment sum no matter how
slightly, O 22A r 9(3) did not apply” (Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan Shwu Leng
[2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [30]). As such, the applicant argues that we should
revisit our decision in CA 21/2018 because its very foundation has been
destroyed, such that the future performance of the court order would lead to
injustice (citing Harmonious Coretrades Pte Ltd v United Integrated Services
Pte Ltd [2020] 1 SLR 206 at [40]).

10 On the other hand, the respondent points out that the actual judgment sum
recovered by the applicant was only $36,732.59, or 80% of $45,915.74, contrary
to the other assumption we made in the CA Costs Judgment (see [6(b)(ii)]
above). Thus, even taking into account the costs recovered by the applicant,
the judgment he obtained within the meaning of O 22A r 9(3)(b) was still
significantly less than the First Offer.

11 Arising from the applicant’s and the respondent’s submissions on the
foregoing points, the correct comparison for the purposes of O 22A r 9(3)(b)
should instead have been as follows:

| First Offer| Judgment obtained by the applicant  
---|---|---  
Calculation in the CA Costs Judgment| The correct calculation  
Judgment sum| –| $45,915.74| $36,732.59  
Costs up to 2 July 2014| not more than $16,084.26| $18,882.22  
Total| $62,000| not more than $62,000| $55,614.81  
  
12 Since the judgment obtained by the applicant remains less favourable than
the First Offer, the foundation of our costs orders in the CA Costs Judgment
is not undermined, and there is no reason to disturb those orders.

13 The applicant also took advantage of the situation and sought to revisit a
number of submissions which had previously been considered and rejected. He
argued, inter alia, that the First Offer should not be taken as a genuine
offer to settle, and that the costs order in his favour at [3(a)] above should
be on the basis of the High Court scale. However, these were the precise
arguments which had been addressed in the CA Costs Judgment at [19]–[25]. We
regard these submissions by the applicant to be an impermissible attempt to
relitigate those issues.

14 We therefore dismiss the application. We award the respondent costs for the
application fixed at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements. There will be the
usual consequential orders for payment out.
