Introduction

1 This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor (“the Prosecution”) against the
District Court’s sentence imposed on Osi Maria Elenora Protacio (“the
Respondent”) for one charge of committing criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) in
respect of cash amounting to $14,089.95 which she was entrusted with dominion
over (see the District Judge’s Grounds of Decision (“the GD”) in [2016] SGDC
5).

2 A fine of $4,000 was imposed on the Respondent for the CBT offence. I am of
the view that the sentence is manifestly inadequate in light of sentencing
precedents. I allow the appeal accordingly, and order the Respondent’s
sentence to be enhanced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

Background and decision below

3 The Respondent is a 41-year-old female working at a dental clinic, Dental
Essence at 127 Tanglin Road (“the Clinic”) as a receptionist. Her job
responsibilities included, among others, collecting payments from customers
and depositing these monies into the Clinic’s bank account.

4 The Respondent pleaded guilty to one charge of CBT under s 406 of the Penal
Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for dishonest misappropriation of S$14,089.95
between 4 January 2014 and 24 December 2014 at the Clinic. Another charge of
CBT under the same provision in respect of dishonest misappropriation of
$12,534.30 between 2 January 2015 and 20 August 2015 was taken into
consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“the TIC charge”) with the
Respondent’s consent. A total of $26,624.25 (“the Misappropriated Funds”) was
misappropriated by the Respondent.

5 The Misappropriated Funds were discovered to be unaccounted for by an
external auditor on 7 September 2015. Thereafter, a director at the Clinic
interviewed the Respondent and the latter admitted that she had dishonestly
misappropriated them. Instead of depositing the Misappropriated Funds into the
Clinic’s bank account, she had used them to settle her personal debts. The
Respondent is untraced, and has since made full restitution.

6 Despite acknowledging that a sentence of imprisonment would usually be
imposed for CBT offences even for first-time offenders unless the property
misappropriated was of a low value (and acknowledging that the amount involved
in this case was not small), the District Judge concluded that a heavy fine
was warranted due to “compassionate grounds” (see [3]–[4] of the GD).

My decision

7 The Prosecution has provided five reported cases with similar facts for my
consideration, and a useful summary in tabular form that encapsulates the
relevant comparators for sentencing:

Table 1: Relevant Sentencing Precedents

Cases| Teo Sor Hwee v PP [2007] SGDC 323| Tham Whye Tong v PP [2001] SGDC 137|
PP v Lim Yew Heng [2013] SGDC 104| PP v Yaw Kee Shen [2012] SGDC 72| PP v Chan
King Wui [2013] SGDC 151| The Present Case  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Amount in proceeded charges| $10,984.29| $13,547.57| $12,332.00| $21,739.00|
$24,527.88| $14,089.95  
Total amount involved| $13,498.96| $13,547.57| $16,482.00| $23,939.00|
$24,527.88| $26,624.25  
Period of offence(s)| About 18 months| About 4 months| About 1.5 months| About

Pleaded guilty| Yes  
Full restitution| Yes  
Clean record| Yes  
Sentence| 8 weeks’ imprisonment| 3 months’ imprisonment| 3 months’
imprisonment| 4 months’ imprisonment| 4 months’ imprisonment| $4,000.00 fine  
  
* * *

8 The Prosecution is submitting that the sentence in the present case should
be enhanced to 4 months’ imprisonment, based on precedents, taking into
account the substantial amount misappropriated and the long period over which
the misappropriation took place. I am of the view that the District Judge had
placed insufficient weight on these two aggravating factors, and too much
weight on the mitigating factors such as the Respondent’s clean record, plea
of guilt, full restitution and difficult financial circumstances. Only in
“rare” and “very exceptional or extreme circumstances” would an accused’s
financial hardship be treated as a mitigating factor (Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [10]). These are not borne out based on the present
facts. One cannot modify a sentence merely because the family will suffer.

9 Furthermore, the existing precedents set out above all also involved accused
persons who pleaded guilty, made full restitution and had clean records (see
Table 1 above). Even after taking into account these mitigating factors, a
more appropriate sentence here would be 15 weeks’ imprisonment (which works
out to be about 3.44 months’ imprisonment based on 1 month being, on average,
the equivalent of 4.36 weeks). A $4,000 fine is a marked and inconsistent
departure from the precedents that is unjustified.

10 Based on the sum of $14,089.95 misappropriated in the proceeded charge, the
present case would be comparable to the figures involved in the proceeded
charges in Tham Whye Tong and Lim Yew Heng. However, taking into account the
TIC charge and the large sum of $26,624.25 that made up the Misappropriated
Funds, as well as the extensive length of time the Respondent was engaged in
dishonest misappropriation (19 months as opposed to just 4 and 1.5 months in
Tham Whye Tong and Lim Yew Heng respectively), the sentence given should be
adjusted upwards to reflect these aggravating factors.

Conclusion

11 Both specific and general deterrence are key sentencing considerations
where CBT offences are concerned (see Tan Kim Hock Anthony v PP [2014] 2 SLR
795 at [43]). The $4,000 fine imposed for an offence involving a large sum of
money is too lenient in light of the precedents, and would also fail to
achieve the sentencing objective of deterrence. I therefore allow the
Prosecution’s appeal on sentence, and order that the Respondent’s sentence be
enhanced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment instead.
