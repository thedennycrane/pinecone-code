: **_Introduction_**  
  
This case concerns, first, the rights and obligations of a mortgagee bank in
relation to its power of sale of its mortgaged security. Next, it concerns the
circumstances under which obligations of joint and several sureties may be
extinguished. The context in which they arise is a claim against two out of
six sureties for the shortfall of money due and payable by the principal
debtor, Tan Chin Mong Holdings (S) Pte Ltd (`the company`). The company
mortgaged a residential property owned by it, 40 Jansen Road, to the
plaintiffs.  
  
The plaintiffs, The Bank of East Asia Ltd, are based in Hong Kong and have a
branch in Singapore. They brought this action against seven defendants. The
first defendant was the company. The second defendant was Tan Chin Mong. The
third defendant was his wife. The other four defendants were his sons. Two of
them have to be named. The sixth defendant was Jeffrey Tan Keok Hng. The
seventh defendant was Andrew Jerry Tan Keok Kiang (`Jerry Tan`). All the
individuals were shareholders in the company.  
  
**_The facilities_**

****

In 1993 the company became a customer of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs
extended an overdraft facility to the company. In addition, at the request of
the company, the plaintiffs issued bank guarantees to Acma Ltd at the request
of a related company, Symbolic Technologies Pte Ltd. The aggregate amount of
the guarantees in February 1998 was $1.5m. The total line of credit available
to the company in 1996 was $6.2m. When granting the facilities, the bank
`reserved its customary overriding right of repayment on demand`.  
  
**_The securities_**

****

The facilities were secured by (a) a joint and several guarantee for $6.2m
signed by the six individual defendants, and (b) the legal mortgage of 40
Jansen Road, Singapore.  
  
**_The guarantee_**

****

The guarantee that was signed on 9 December 1996 by the individual defendants
was an `all money guarantee`. Clauses 16 and 17 of the guarantee read as
follows:

> _
>
> 16 You shall be at liberty to release or discharge any one or more of us
> from the obligations of this guarantee or to accept any composition from or
> make any other arrangements with any one or more of us without thereby
> prejudicing or affecting your rights and remedies against the other or
> others of us.
>
> 17 Our liability hereunder shall be joint and several and all covenants,
> agreements, undertakings and other provisions herein shall be deemed to be
> made by and be binding on us jointly and severally.
>
> _

  
  
**_Cancellation of the credit facilities_ **

****

The unsatisfactory financial position of the company forced the plaintiffs to
cancel the facilities on 27 April 1998. The plaintiffs further asked the
company to seek refinancing by 27 July 1998 to repay the outstanding debt.  
  
On 5 May 1998 the company responded saying that they were unable to effect
refinancing and stated that the plaintiffs `may proceed with the auction sale
at the best price`. On the same day the lawyers for the company wrote to the
plaintiffs, stating that the company would like to place the property for
sale, and seeking the plaintiffs` consent to the sale price of $4.8m. The
plaintiffs were prepared to permit a sale by the company provided that the
price was not less than $5m. That amount was less than what was owing to them
on the overdraft on 22 May 1998. On 7 May 1998, the overdraft account showed a
debit of $4,457,794.64. On 31 May, the company withdrew $34,899.93. This
increased the debit to $4,492,694.57. There was, also, the exposure on the
Acma bank guarantees. The company without raising any objection to the minimum
price of $5m went ahead and appointed Knight Frank, auctioneers, to sell the
property. Knight Frank sent out mailshots and advertised the property in the
press on 3, 10, 12, 15 and 18 June 1998 for an auction sale on 18 June 1998.
The opening price was $4.2m but there was no bid even at that level. So there
was no sale. The market then was in the trough of a recession in the wake of
the Asian financial crisis.  
  
On 17 July 1998 lawyers retained by the plaintiffs issued a demand letter to
the company for payment of $4,542,821.24 being the debit balance on 13 July
1998. The letter further stated that if the bank guarantee issued to Acma Ltd
were called, the plaintiffs would look to the company for indemnity with
interest. The letter was copied to all six guarantors with a covering letter.  
  
The company made proposals to the plaintiffs for restructuring the credit
facilities. On 2 September 1998 the plaintiffs replied that they were not
agreeable to the restructuring and asked for the keys to the property to
enable them to sell it by way of public auction. On 4 November 1998 the
plaintiffs were given the keys. The plaintiffs were thus placed in a position
to exercise their power of sale as mortgagees.  
  
**_Sale of property by the plaintiffs_**

****

The plaintiffs appointed Jones Lang LaSalle to sell the property by public
auction. The property was advertised in the newspapers on some 21 days during
the period of December 1998 to 13 May 1999. The property was put up for
auction three times - on 16 December 1998, 18 March and 15 May 1999. There was
an agreement for sale on 15 May 1999. The sale was completed on 22 July 1999.
The sale price was $3.8m.  
  
**_Judgment against the guarantors_**

****

Meanwhile, on 17 June 1999, Acma Ltd called on the bank guarantees issued by
the plaintiffs. By then, the only amount outstanding on the bank guarantees
was $1.25m. The plaintiffs honoured it on 30 June 1999. Consequently, after
giving credit to the sale proceeds, the balance due to the plaintiffs on 29
July 1999 was $2,423,230.33. In the event, the plaintiffs commenced the
present action. No one filed an appearance. For that reason the plaintiffs
entered default judgment on 26 October 1999. There was a joint judgment
against all seven defendants. The plaintiffs then commenced winding-up
proceedings against the company and bankruptcy proceedings against the
guarantors.  
  
The next relevant event was a settlement between the plaintiffs and Jerry Tan,
the seventh defendant. In that settlement the plaintiffs agreed to accept
$400,000 in settlement of their claim against him and to withdraw the
bankruptcy proceedings against him.  
  
The second and the sixth defendants applied to set aside the judgment against
them and succeeded in doing so. The default judgment against them was set
aside on 17 May 2000, and they were given leave to defend the claims against
them. There is an important implication in the setting aside of the judgment,
in that it demerged the cause of action from the judgment in which it had
merged. More about it later.  
  
**_The defence_**

****

The defence filed by the two defendants made these assertions: The plaintiffs
as mortgagees had a duty to act in good faith and to obtain the best price
when selling the property. They had breached those duties because they
insisted on a sale price of at least $5m for the property in May 1998, when
the amount then outstanding on the facilities was $4,492,694.57. Further, they
asserted that the plaintiffs had failed to obtain the best price when they
sold the property in May 1999, as they had failed to properly or adequately
advertise the sale of the property. When the two defending defendants
discovered the settlement between the plaintiffs and the seventh defendant,
they added another block to the defence against the plaintiffs. They amended
their defence by adding the following paragraph:

> _
>
> 7 Further or in the alternative, the second and sixth defendants will
> contend that they have been released from any liability under the
> **_guarantee_** by virtue of a settlement reached between the plaintiff and
> the seventh defendant. [Emphasis is added.]
>
> _

  
  
**_Limit to mortgagee`s power in exercising power of sale - The law_ **

****

I shall now consider the defence relating to the sale of the mortgaged
property. The falls in property prices in the past decade and a half have
spawned a plethora of reported cases on mortgagee`s power of sale. It would,
therefore, be salutary to take stock and sum up the salient principles of law.  
  
George Jessel MR in **Nash v Eads** [1880] 25 Sol Jo 95 set out the duty of a
mortgagee to a mortgagor in these general terms:

> _Of course there were some limits to the powers of the mortgagee. He, like a
> pledgee, must conduct the sale properly, and must sell at a fair value, and
> he could not sell to himself. But he was not bound to abstain from selling
> because he was not in urgent want of his money, or because he had a spite
> against the mortgagor._

  
  
Pollock CB, referring to the duty of the creditor to the surety in respect of
the security, spoke in terms of a triple duty in **Watts v Shuttleworth**
[1860] 157 ER 1171:

> _The substantial question in the case is, whether the omission to insure
> discharges the defendant, the surety. The rule upon the subject seems to be
> that if the person guaranteed does any act injurious to the surety, or
> inconsistent with his rights, or if he omits to do any act which his duty
> enjoins him to do, and the omission proves injurious to the surety, the
> latter will be discharged:**Story`s Equity Jurisprudence** , sect 325. The
> same principle is enunciated and exemplified by the Master of the Rolls in
> **Pearl v Deacon** 24 Beav 186, 191, where he cited with approbation the
> opinion of Lord Eldon, in **Craythorne v Swinburne** 14 Vesey 164, 169, that
> the rights of a surety depend rather on principles of equity than upon the
> actual contract; that there may be a quasi contract; but that the right of a
> surety arises out of the equitable relation of the parties._

  
  
Lord Moulton in **McHugh v Union Bank of Canada** [1913] AC 299 at p 311
defined the mortgagee`s duty towards the mortgagor in these general terms:

> _It is well settled law that it is the duty of a**mortgagee** when realising
> the mortgaged property by sale to behave in conducting such realisation as a
> reasonable man would behave in the realisation of his own property, so that
> the **mortgagor** may receive credit for the fair value of the property
> sold. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
Finally, the following statement of law by Salmon LJ in **Cuckmere Brick Co v
Mutual Finance** [1971] Ch 949[1971] 2 All ER 633 has become the beacon for
all concerned ([1971] Ch 949, 965-966; [1971] 2 All ER 633, 643:

> _[A] mortgagee is not a trustee of the power of sale for the mortgagor. Once
> the power has accrued, the mortgagee is entitled to exercise it for his own
> purposes whenever he chooses to do so. It matters not that the moment may be
> unpropitious and that by waiting a higher price could be obtained. He has
> the right to realise his security by turning it into money when he likes.
> Nor, in my view, is there anything to prevent a mortgagee from accepting the
> best bid he can get at an auction, even though the auction is badly attended
> and the bidding exceptionally low. Providing none of those adverse factors
> is due to any fault of the mortgagee, he can do as he likes. If the
> mortgagee`s interests, as he sees them, conflict with those of the
> mortgagor, the mortgagee can give preference to his own interests, which of
> course he could not do were he a trustee of the power of sale for the
> mortgagor._

  
  
Salmon LJ went on to expound that the mortgagee must observe two distinct
duties in exercising the power of sale: first he must act in good faith; next,
he must take reasonable care to obtain whatever is the true market value of
the mortgaged property at the moment he chooses to sell it. He added that the
proposition that the mortgagee owes both duties represents the true view of
the law. Acting in good faith alone would not suffice.  
  
**_Duty to surety_**

****

It was thought at one time that the mortgagee did not owe the above duties to
a surety who did not provide any material security to the mortgagee: see
**Barclays Bank v Thienel** [1978] 122 Sol Jo 472. It was, however, held later
that the mortgagee owed the duty not only to the mortgagor but to the surety
as well: see **Standard Chartered Bank v Walker** [1982] 3 All ER 938[1982] 1
WLR 1410 and **American Express International Banking Corp v Hurley** [1985] 3
All ER 564. Lord Denning MR accurately summarised the law in the **_Walker_**
case [1982] 3 All ER 938, 942; [1982] 1 WLR 1410, 1415:

> _If a**mortgagee** enters into possession and realises a mortgaged property,
> it is his duty to use reasonable care to obtain the best possible price
> which the circumstances of the case permit. He owes this duty not only to
> himself (to clear off as much of the debt as he can) but also to **the
> mortgagor** so as to reduce the balance owing as much as possible, and also
> to **the guarantor** so that he is made liable for as little as possible on
> the guarantee. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
Although the duty owed by the mortgagee in realizing the security has been
expressed in differing phraseology, they are all much of a muchness. The
purpose of the pronouncements is to prevent an abuse of the power of sale to
the detriment of the mortgagor and the guarantor. As a general proposition,
the mortgagee is not under a duty to exercise his power of sale over mortgaged
property at any particular time or at all. There are some important exceptions
to this general rule. Once he decides to realize the security, he must apply
due diligence to obtain the best price which the circumstances of the case
permit.  
  
**_No duty of care in tort_**

****

Lord Denning MR in the **_Walker_** case postulated the proposition that the
duty of a mortgagee in exercising his power of sale was only a particular
application of the common law concept of a general duty of care, stated by
Lord Atkin in **Donoghue v Stevenson** [1932] AC 562, and applied in many
cases, such as **Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd** [1970] AC 1004 and **Anns
v Merton London Borough Council** [1978] AC 728. Detractors of Lord Denning
MR, however, said that the principles were evolved by equity over many decades
before the modern development of the law of negligence was evolved. Detractors
also said that where there is a contractual relationship between two parties,
in the absence of fraud or motivated misrepresentation, the law will not
impose a wider duty of care in tort between those parties. The law does not
superimpose duties in tort inconsistent with settled contractual or equitable
duties. The proposition of Lord Denning MR was invoked by the defendant in
**Tan Soon Gin George v China and South Sea Bank** [1988] 2 HKLR 202. George
Tan (aka Tan Soon Gin) was sued in Hong Kong by China and South Sea Bank Ltd
as a guarantor for a loan of HK$30m made to Carrian Holdings Ltd. When the
principal debtor defaulted, shares mortgaged to the bank by a third party,
Filomena Ltd, were worth more than the loan. The bank chose not to sell the
shares. The mortgagor did not ask the bank to sell the shares either. When the
shares became worthless, the bank filed an action against the guarantor and
sought summary judgment. The surety argued for unconditional leave to defend.
The judge who heard the application gave judgment in favour of the bank. The
guarantor appealed to the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal
reversed the decision of the judge and gave unconditional leave to defend. The
Court of Appeal applied the common law negligence theory postulated by Lord
Denning MR and held that it was prima facie unreasonable for the bank to delay
sale for a substantial length of time or in a falling market. The bank,
therefore, was negligent. About that time, New Zealand also accepted Lord
Denning`s theory and acted on it: see **First City Corp v Downsview Nominees**
[1990] 3 NZLR 265. Both decisions were appealed to the Privy Council.  
  
By a tautly worded joint judgment in **China and South Sea Bank v Tan Soon Gin
George** [1990] 1 AC 536[1989] 3 All ER 839 Lord Templeman rejected the
suggestion that the modern law of negligence and its cognate duty of care
applied to a mortgagee`s power of sale. He said ([1990] 1 AC 536, 543-544;
[1989] 3 All ER 839, 841):

> _[T]he tort of negligence has not yet subsumed all torts and does not
> supplant the principles of equity or contradict contractual promises or
> complement the remedy of judicial review or supplement statutory rights._

  
  
**_Equity intervenes to protect a surety_ **

****

In **Downsview Nominees v First City Corp** [1993] AC 295[1993] 3 All ER 626
Lord Templeman delivering the judgment of the Privy Council reiterated the
position ([1993] AC 295, 315; [1993] 3 All ER 626, 637):

> _The general duty of care said to be owed by a mortgagee to subsequent
> encumbrancers and the mortgagor in negligence is inconsistent with the right
> of the mortgagee and the duties which the courts applying equitable
> principles have imposed on the mortgagee. If a mortgagee enters into
> possession he is liable to account for rent on the basis of wilful default;
> he must keep mortgage premises in repair; he is liable for waste. Those
> duties were imposed to ensure that a mortgagee is diligent in discharging
> his mortgage and returning the property to the mortgagor. If a mortgagee
> exercises his power of sale in good faith for the purpose of protecting his
> security, he is not liable to the mortgagor even though he might have
> obtained a higher price and even though the terms might be regarded as
> disadvantageous to the mortgagor._

  
  
In **Parker-Tweedale v Dunbar Bank** [1991] Ch 12[1990] 2 All ER 577 Nourse LJ
stated the position assertively (at [1991] Ch 12, 18; [1990] 2 All ER 577,
582):

> _[I]t is both unnecessary and confusing for the duties owed by a mortgagee
> to the mortgagor and the surety, if there is one, to be expressed in terms
> of the tort of negligence._

  
  
In **AIB Finance v Debtors** [1998] 2 All ER 929 at p 937 Nourse LJ reiterated
the position in these words:

> _It was established by the decisions of this court in**Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd
> v Mutual Finance Ltd** [1971] 2 All ER 633[1971] Ch 949 and **Parker-
> Tweedale v Dunbar Bank plc (No 1)** [1990] 2 All ER 577[1991] Ch 12, first,
> that a mortgagee, although he may exercise his power of sale at any time of
> his own choice, owes the mortgagor a duty to take reasonable care to obtain
> a proper price for the mortgaged property at that time; secondly, that **the
> duty is not tortious in nature but one recognised by equity as arising out
> of the particular relationship between mortgagee and mortgagor**. [Emphasis
> is added.]_

  
  
**_Basis of duty_ **

****

It is settled law that a creditor-mortgagee is not obliged to do anything for
the benefit of a borrower or a surety under established equitable principles
in relation to the recovery of the debt or realization of the security. The
basis of the principle is this: it is the duty of the borrower and the
guarantor to activate themselves and discharge their obligations. If they
don`t then they bear the risk of a falling market. It is not desirable to turn
the right of a mortgagee into a duty. To do so would be baneful to the
business of property financing. The lender is entitled to sit tight and wait
until he feels that he has to act in his interest. Both equity and statute,
however, have intervened to sober the excesses of the mortgagee to the
detriment of his supplicants.  
  
**_Selling in a falling market_**

****

Provided that the mortgagee observes the duties stated above, the courts will
not rule against him even if the price affords but little relief to the
mortgagor and guarantor. Selling in a falling market per se is not wrong, for
more often than not, it is a falling market that triggers a default by the
borrower and the consequent sale of the mortgaged property by the mortgagee.
The law, therefore, does not impose a duty on the mortgagee not to sell in a
falling market. If it did, it would unduly interfere with his right to sit
tight, and also encourage the borrower and guarantor to do nothing. As Lord
Templeman said in the **_China and South Sea Bank_** case at [1990] 1 AC 536,
545; [1989] 3 All ER 839, 842: `No creditor could carry on the business of
lending if he could become liable to a mortgagor and to a surety or to either
of them for a decline in value of mortgaged property, unless the creditor was
personally responsible for the decline.`  
  
**_No absolute power_**

****

The statement, that the mortgagee has the right to decide whether to sell the
mortgaged property and when to sell, must not be understood as an absolute
entitlement or treated akin to strictly worded stipulations of a statute. The
mortgagee`s power is subject to certain limitations.  
  
First, possession of the mortgaged property must not be sought with a hidden
agenda, in disregard of the harm that it might cause to someone with a vested
interest in it. This prohibition applies to the mortgagee as well as a surety
who is subrogated to the power of sale. In **Quennell v Maltby** [1979] 1 All
ER 568[1979] 1 WLR 318 the mortgagee sought possession with the ulterior
motive of assisting her husband to free the property from rent control and to
sell it at a good profit. The Court of Appeal denied possession. Templeman LJ
said (at [1979] 1 All ER 568, 572; [1979] 1 WLR 318, 324):

> _The estate, rights and powers of a mortgagee, however, are only vested in a
> mortgagee to protect his position as a mortgagee and to enable him to obtain
> repayment._

  
  
Secondly, in appropriate circumstances, the court may order sale against the
wishes of the mortgagee. In **Palk v Mortgage Services Funding** [1993] Ch
330[1993] 2 All ER 481, the mortgagee obtained an order for possession of the
property when the property market was in the trough of a recession. The
intention was to let out the property and wait for a recovery. The mortgagor
had found a buyer at a price insufficient to meet what was due to the
mortgagee. The sum due on the mortgage was increasing by about Â£43,000 a
year, that is, at the rate of 12%pa. The rental income of the property was
unlikely to yield more than Â£13,000 or Â£14,000. The mortgagor applied to the
court for approval of the sale at Â£283,000. The application was made under s
91 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). The Court of Appeal allowed the sale
to proceed and denied the mortgagee the right to decide whether to sell and
when to sell. Sir Michael Kerr justified the decision in these words (at
[1993] Ch 330, 344-345; [1993] 2 All ER 481, 492):

> _If a sale is refused, then they are in a situation of financial haemorrhage
> for an indefinite period while the company continues to speculate at their
> expense on an increase in the value of the property. But although a sale
> cannot staunch this outflow entirely, it can greatly reduce it. On the
> assumed present value of about Â£283,000 and expenses of, say, Â£8,000, a
> sale would reduce the plaintiffs` capital debt from Â£300,000 to about
> Â£25,000, and their liability for interest to about one-twelfth of what it
> is now. At the same time, if a sale is ordered, the company can back its
> faith in the future value of the property by acquiring it in the sale, if it
> wishes to do so. So there is fairness to both sides._

  
  
Thirdly, in appropriate cases, the mortgagor should be given a reasonable
opportunity to market the property. Warren LH Khoo J speaking for the Court of
Appeal said in **How Seen Ghee v Development Bank of Singapore** [1994] 1 SLR
526  at p 531:

> _[W]hen the power of sale has arisen, and when it comes to realizing the
> security, there is seldom any divergence of interests between the mortgagee
> and the mortgagor; both are interested in securing the best price from the
> sale of the security. In the vast majority of cases, there is no reason why
> the parties should not co-operate with each other to try to realize as much
> as possible from the sale of the property. An auction is not always the best
> way of securing a good price, as shown in the instant case. It is often
> possible for the mortgagor himself, who has every reason to try to do so, to
> secure a good price by a private treaty sale. There is seldom any harm in
> allowing the mortgagor a reasonable opportunity to do so. While the
> mortgagor is engaged in such efforts, the mortgagee should refrain from
> doing anything which is liable adversely to affect the mortgagor`s efforts._

  
  
Fourthly, the court has no power to decline to make an order for possession
when the mortgagor is in clear default and order instalments of the accrued
debt. The court must give judgment and order possession. The court, however,
has power to postpone possession by ordering stay of execution of the order
for possession and at the same time order payment of the accrued debt by
instalments. See **Hong Leong Finance v Tan Gin Huay** [1999] 2 SLR 153 .  
  
**_Decision on breach of duty defence_**

****

Now I shall decide the issues on the sale of the property. As a prelude, I
shall state the financial exposure of the plaintiffs in May 1998. In an
affidavit made on 31 August 2000 the second defendant swore to the following
facts:

> _In February 1998, 40 Jansen Road was valued at S$6,600,000 for mortgage
> purposes by the plaintiff`s valuers. At around the same time, the
> plaintiff`s exposure on the guarantee in favour of Acma Ltd was reduced to
> $1,250,000 and the outstanding on the overdraft facility was
> S$4,390,087.87._

  
  
The total exposure of the plaintiffs, according to the second defendant, was
$5,640,087.87. As noted above, the closing balance of the overdraft account on
31 May 1998 was $4,492,694.57. The total exposure of the plaintiffs on 31 May
1998, therefore, was $5,742,694.57 and not $4,492,694.57. This was not reduced
until the sale proceeds of the property were given credit. There was,
therefore, a factual error in the defence.  
  
When the bank stipulated the minimum price of $5m, it was not exercising
mortgagee`s power of sale. At that point of time, the power had not even
arisen. The property was in the constructive possession of the company. To be
sure, it yielded no income to the bank. One or more of the shareholders of the
company were in occupation of it. Therefore, the bank was actually granting an
indulgence to the company when it agreed to a sale by the company subject to
the minimum price of $5m. This condition imposed by the bank did not deter the
company from moving ahead with the auction. The auction was held on 18 June
1998. But the property was withdrawn because there was no bid even at $4.2m.
The defendants were not in any way affected by the $5m stipulation. The facts
of the case, therefore, did not make out the point of defence that the
plaintiffs did not act in good faith.  
  
As for the second defendant, it was a disingenuous defence because of his own
admission that the amount due to the plaintiffs at that time exceeded $5m as
stated in the preceding paragraph.  
  
If the company had thought that the sale of the property at any time was
advisable or achievable at a fair price, an application could have been made
by the mortgagor under s 30 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap
61, 1994 Ed). The section provides as follows :

> _
>
> (1) Any person entitled to redeem mortgaged property may have a judgment or
> order for sale instead of for redemption in an action brought by him either
> for redemption alone, or for sale alone, or for sale or redemption, in the
> alternative.

The English equivalent of the above provision is s 91 of the Law of Property
Act 1925. This was the provision the mortgagor relied on in **_Palk v Mortgage
Services Funding_** (supra). The company made no such application. On the
other hand the bank offered reasonable opportunity to the mortgagor to sell
the property and waited to take possession until the mortgagor exhausted his
own efforts. The guarantors had no basis to complain.  
  
Now, the problems relating to the price. The company which gave the mortgage
did not allege any allegation of wrongdoing by the mortgagees. There was no
bid at the auction conducted for the company even at $4.2m. The bank`s
auctioneers attempted three times to auction the property. They advertised the
property more widely than the agents of the company in the newspapers and
other standard methods. In the circumstances the charge that the plaintiffs
did not advertise it properly was without substance or merit.  
  
It was then said that the plaintiffs should have done an owner`s sale. That,
however, would not have been honest because they were effecting a mortgagee`s
sale. In any event, the owners had already tried and failed.  
  
Finally, the defendants before me called valuers who put a higher value than
$3.8m and contended that the plaintiffs sold below market value. This was not
their pleaded case. In any event, as a matter of principle, where the
mortgagees are not in breach of their duties in relation to their power of
sale, their liability cannot be measured on the basis of valuers` opinions.
Expert evidence on value should be admissable against the mortgagees only in
cases where they are at fault as in **_Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance_**
(supra). Even so, when considering expert evidence on property valuation the
following common sense observations must be borne in mind. In **_Cuckmere
Brick Co v Mutual Finance Ltd_** (CA (Eng)), Salmon LJ said (at [1971] Ch 949,
959; [1971] 2 All ER 633, 638):

> _The valuation of a plot of land depends upon the knowledge, experience,
> expertise and ability of the valuer. Valuation is not an exact science.
> Equally careful and competent valuers may differ within fairly wide limits
> about the value of any piece of land._

  
  
In Singapore, the professions of estate agents and property valuers have a
propensity to operate in combination. Given that, when a competent firm of
estate agents and property valuers market a property and conclude a sale, the
price obtained by them is conclusive of the correct market price. On this
basis I would reject the argument of the second and sixth defendants that the
sale price was low.  
  
**_Joint and several liabilities - the law_**

****

The next matter for consideration is the defence based on the settlement
between the plaintiffs and Jerry Tan. This calls for restatement of the
relevant law. There is an interaction of two distinct concepts: the doctrine
of joint liability of joint and several sureties; and the doctrine of merger
of a cause of action in a judgment.  
  
At law, a joint guarantee creates a joint, undivided and indivisible liability
of two or more sureties. A several guarantee creates separate liability of
each guarantor to answer for the entire amount subject to the rule against
excess recovery. Several liability of guarantors is not cumulative. To create
several liability of two or more guarantors there must be words of severance
in the guarantee. Otherwise it will be construed as a joint guarantee. In
practice, one seldom, if ever, encounters a several guarantee. The common form
of guarantee is the joint and several guarantee. A joint and several guarantee
is a hybrid guarantee - it creates both a joint obligation and a number of
separate obligations binding each signatory. The liabilities, however, are
non-cumulative. Performance by one will discharge all. At common law it was
necessary to bring one action against all joint guarantors. Separate actions
had to be brought and separate judgments obtained in respect of a several
guarantee. All that has changed. It is now possible to sue several guarantors
in one action provided that the pleadings make it clear that separate
judgments can be obtained on a joint liability.  
  
**Merger by judgment**

At common law, the general rule was that a judgment against joint guarantors
resulted in a joint judgment. The judgment extinguished the original cause of
action by the doctrine of merger. The act of court transformed the claims into
a superior right empowering the creditor to take execution proceedings. A
judgment against one joint guarantor extinguished the only cause of action
that existed. This was so, even though the judgment remained unsatisified.
Logically, therefore, if an action was brought against joint and several
guarantors, there could be a joint and several judgment. Satisfaction of the
judgment by any one of the judgment debtors would discharge all guarantors,
for the judgment would become extinct by satisfaction.  
  
It has, however, been held that if a single judgment was obtained on a joint
and several guarantee, and a compromise settlement by accord and satisfaction
was reached with one of the guarantors, all guarantors would ipso facto be
discharged. The case of **Re EWA, A Debtor** [1901] 2 KB 642 decided that
point. The creditor in that case obtained a judgment for Â£6,000 against two
guarantors. The judgment was described as `joint and severally for Â£6,000`.
The creditor took out bankruptcy proceedings against one debtor alone. Later
there was a settlement between the creditor and that debtor when it was agreed
that the creditor would be paid Â£3,000 `in full discharge of all claims` by
the creditor against that debtor and `all guarantees given by him ... and in
settlement of any outstanding questions as to the amount due to the
[creditor]`. The creditor undertook to withdraw the bankruptcy petition.
Later, the petition was withdrawn. The creditor then filed a bankruptcy
petition against the other debtor in respect of the alleged balance of
Â£3,000. It was held that the entire cause of action was extinguished by
accord and satisfaction and release. The Court of Appeal, by a majority,
construed the judgment as creating a joint judgment, and that there was a
release of the entire judgment. Collins LJ said at p 648:

> _[U]nder any judgment or other obligation creating a joint liability there
> is only one debt, and, that being so, the rule that the release of one of
> the joint debtors gets rid of the debt applies equally whether the
> obligation arises on a judgment or on any other security. Therefore no
> reliance can be placed upon the fact that the obligation in this case was a
> judgment. It is too late now to question the law - that where the obligation
> is joint and several, the release of one of two joint debtors has the effect
> of releasing the other._

  
  
Logically, where a judgment is joint and several, it should be accepted and
acted upon as such. The reason why it was read as `joint` ignoring the
`several` part, is historical, though not fair or logical. According to
Glanville L Williams` masterpiece, **Joint Liabilities** [1949] at 36 and 63
that has been the law since 1374 and it `has been adopted in the United States
of America, though rejected in the Restatement on grounds of logic and
convenience`. It has also been accepted in Singapore: see **European Asian
Bank v Chia Ngee Thuang** [1995] 3 SLR 171  at p 174 where Warren LH Khoo J
said:

> _The general rule is that in the absence of any contractual stipulations to
> the contrary, the release of one joint surety has the effect of releasing
> all the other joint sureties. This applies to joint and several, as well as
> joint, sureties._

  
  
In modern times, much new law has been made. The Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999
Ed) by s 17 (re-enacting s 3 of the English Civil Liability (Contribution) Act
1978 provides that:

> _Judgment recovered against any person liable in respect of any debt or
> damage shall not be a bar to an action, or to the continuance of an action,
> against any other person who is (apart from any such bar) jointly liable
> with him in respect of the same debt or damage._

  
  
It follows, therefore, that if judgment is entered against many joint and
several guarantors and one or more of them succeeds in setting aside the joint
judgment against them the cause of action is demerged. The original cause of
action is resuscitated against those who are no longer bound by the judgment.
A subsequent judgment against each of them will be a separate judgment. Any
release of any of the other judgment debtors will not affect the separate
subsequent judgment. The subsequent judgment, nonetheless, will be reduced by
the amount paid by the other judgment debtors.  
  
The same result may be reached by another route: Where a joint judgment is
obtained against one or more of joint and several sureties, it is no bar
against proceeding against the others on their several liabilities. See **Re
Davison, ex p Chandler** [1884] 13 QBD 50 which sealed this principle of law:
that where a joint judgment is obtained in respect of a joint and several
liability, the several liability is not extinguished. Cave J explained the
principle at pp 53-54:

> _Take the illustration of a joint and several note against A, B, and C,
> which is usually comprised in one document. The result is the same as if
> three separate notes were given as well as the joint note. If A is sued to
> judgment on his separate note, is the joint note of A, B, and C merged in
> the judgment? On principle why should it be? The object of taking a joint
> and several note is to have the separate liability of each promissor as well
> as the joint liability of all, and why should the fact that the separate
> liability of one promissor has merged in a separate judgment against him
> prove a bar to an action on the joint note? Is there any authority?**King v
> Hoare** 13 M & W 494 is the leading case, and there it was held that a
> judgment without satisfaction recovered against one of two joint debtors was
> a bar to an action against the other, but it was pointed out both at the bar
> and in the judgment that the law is otherwise when the obligation is joint
> and several. This very point was decided as long ago as **Drake v Mitchell**
> 3 East 251. In that case one of three joint covenantors had given a bill of
> exchange for the debt secured by the covenant, on which bill judgment was
> recovered, and it was held that this judgment was no bar to an action of
> covenant against the three._

  
  
The underlying logic of that principle is that several liability spawns
separate causes of action. Action and joint judgment without satisfaction
against one or more is no bar to a subsequent action on several liability. At
common law it was not possible to bring one action against guarantors who were
severally liable. It is no longer necessary to bring several actions in
respect of several liability. One action may be brought against several
guarantors and several judgment obtained against them. That being so, release
of one or more of them will not release the other except when the full amount
has been paid.  
  
**Decision on release point - the legal basis**

Applying the above law, I hold as follows. When the plaintiffs obtained a
judgment against the guarantors it was a joint judgment. However, when the
second and sixth defendants set aside the judgment against them and obtained
leave to defend there was a demerger of the separate cause of action against
them. That made it possible for the plaintiffs to obtain separate judgments
against them. That liability was not affected by the settlement between the
plaintiffs and the seventh defendant, for there was no joint judgment against
the second and sixth defendants. Their liability, however, was reduced by
$400,000 the plaintiffs received from the seventh defendant. The court must
find the parties, their pleadings and evidence as they are before it on the
day of judgment and give its judgment accordingly. Accordingly I pronounce
separate and several judgment against the second and sixth defendants for the
amount that is outstanding with interest.  
  
**Decision on release point - the factual basis**

The above is the legal basis for my rejection of the defendants` argument. In
addition, the plaintiffs had two answers based on facts to the second and
sixth defendant`s assertion of release from liability. One was cl 16 of the
guarantee. The other was the reservation of their rights against the other
guarantors.  
  
The provision in cl 16 was that composition with any of the guarantors will
not prejudice the plaintiffs` right against the others. This is a short answer
to the case of the two defendants before me. The clause is analogous to the
provision in the Bankruptcy Act, that acceptance of a composition by a
creditor from one debtor shall not release the debtor`s joint surety. The
composition with Jerry Tan, therefore, did not prejudice the plaintiffs` right
against the other defendants.  
  
It is settled law that a settlement with one surety will not discharge the
others if the settlement does not discharge the debt but discharges the
surety. The settlement agreement may expressly or impliedly include a
reservation of rights against the other sureties.  
  
The plaintiffs relied on the deed made on 3 August 2000 between the plaintiffs
and Jerry Tan, that is, the deed of settlement. Recital 2 of the deed referred
to cl 16 in the guarantee. Recital 6 stated that a settlement was reached. It
read as follows:

> _
>
> 6 A settlement was subsequently reached between the Guarantor and the Bank
> upon terms that it will not affect the Bank`s rights and remedies against
> the other guarantors under the Guarantee or the said judgment and that all
> further action against the Guarantor will be stayed.
>
> _

  
  
The body of the deed contained three clauses which read as follows:

> _
>
> 1 The Guarantor agreed to pay to the Bank and the Bank agreed to accept the
> sum of $400,000 in settlement of the Bank`s claim against the Guarantor upon
> the terms and conditions herein provided.
>
> 2 The settlement is personal to the Guarantor, and in accordance with the
> terms of the Guarantee will not affect the Bank`s rights and remedies
> against the other guarantors under the Guarantee or the said judgment.
>
> 3 Upon receipt of the said sum the Bank will withdraw the bankruptcy
> proceedings against the Guarantor and will thereafter make no further claims
> against the Guarantor whether arising out of the Guarantee or the said
> judgment or any other dealings heretofore between them.
>
> _

  
  
The provisions of the deed are as plain as they can be. It was the product of
a mind which knew the law on the matter. The defendants said it was a sham
document - an afterthought. According to them, the settlement was reached much
earlier without any reservation of rights as feigned in the deed of
settlement. So it is necessary to trace the origin of the settlement.  
  
On 14 February 2000, Jerry Tan sent a letter to Ms Lorraine Cher, VP of Credit
Marketing of the plaintiffs. It said that he was jobless and `he earnestly
hoped that the plaintiffs` management would kindly consider the proposal` he
had put forward. He did not spell out in his letter what the proposal was. On
15 February 2000 his lawyer, Robert Yu of Low and Robert Yu, did. He wrote a
letter to the plaintiffs` lawyers, Joseph Hoo Morris & Kumar as follows:

> _We have been instructed by our client that your clients have agreed in
> principle to accept our client`s offer to pay your clients a lump sum of
> $400,000 in 2 weeks` time, ie say by 1 March 2000 in full and final
> settlement of all claims whatsoever your clients may have against our
> client. Our client is therefore arranging for the necessary funds to pay
> your clients, upon which your clients will discontinue the above bankruptcy
> proceedings against our client._

> _Given the above, please confirm that you have instructions to adjourn the
> hearing of the above bankruptcy petition against our client which we
> understand has been fixed on Friday, 18 February 2000 for say 3 weeks to
> allow time for our client to effect the settlement._

  
  
Then there was a memorandum dated 14 February 2000, prepared by Lorraine Cher,
and sent to the plaintiffs` Hong Kong head office. It set out the proposal
made by Jerry Tan. It was signed by five members of the Singapore Branch
Credit Committee. The memorandum was captioned as follows:

> _Tan Chin Mong Holdings (S) Pte Ltd_

> _To accept the offer of a one time payment of $400,000 from one of the
> guarantors Mr Tan Keok Kiang, Andrew Jerry, as final settlement**to release
> him** from the joint and several guarantee of the company`s liabilities.
> [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
It contained the following relevant paragraphs:

> _
>
> 4.2 We have been approached by only one of the guarantors, Mr Tan Keok
> Kiang, Andrew Jerry to accept his offer of a one-time payment of $400,000
> **_to release him from the guarantee_**. According to him, he managed to
> raise this money from his friends and wife`s relatives.
>
> 5.3 **_Notwithstanding the release of one of the guarantors_** , Mr Jerry
> Tan Keok Kiang, **_we will still proceed with bankruptcy action against the
> remaining 5 guarantors_**.
>
> 5.4 We have sought the advice of our lawyers Ms Margaret Neo of Joseph Hoo
> Morris & Kumar, who informed us that the release does not prejudice our
> rights of claim against the remaining guarantors. Besides, no consent is
> required from the remaining guarantors for the release of Mr Tan Keok Kiang,
> Andrew Jerry as guarantor. [Emphasis is added.]
>
> _

  
  
The Hong Kong head office approved the proposed settlement on 23 February
2000. The next day, the plaintiffs instructed their lawyers to `inform Messrs
Low & Robert Yu that the bank is agreeable to their client`s offer of $400,000
in full and final settlement of all claims against Tan Keok Kiang Andrew
Jerry`.  
  
On 25 February 2000, the plaintiffs` lawyers wrote to Jerry Tan`s lawyers
stating that `we have our clients` instructions that they are agreeable to
your client`s offer of $400,000 in full and final settlement of our clients`
claim against your client. The said payment must be received by our clients by
9 March 2000.`  
  
On 8 March 2000, Jerry Tan`s lawyers wrote to the plaintiffs as follows:

> _We forward herewith our client`s cheque dated 9 March for $400,000 made
> payable to your clients in full and final settlement of all claims
> whatsoever which your clients may have**against our client**. For the
> avoidance of doubt, this is to confirm that with this payment your clients
> **release our client** fully from all guarantees, which our client has given
> to your clients. Accordingly, as agreed, please apply to discontinue the
> above bankruptcy proceedings against our client at the next hearing date on
> 17 March 2000. [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
On 22 March 2000, Jerry Tan`s lawyers wrote saying that the plaintiffs had
informed their client that they would give him a deed of release and
discharge. They asked for it. The plaintiffs` lawyers replied on 15 May 2000
as follows:

> _If your client wishes to have a Deed of Release and Discharge, kindly let
> us have draft of the same for our approval._

> _Among the terms agreed on our instructions was that such release and
> discharge would be without prejudice to and would not affect our clients`
> rights against the other guarantors. Furthermore, legal costs of our clients
> for such Deed of Release and Discharge will have to be borne by your
> client._

  
  
Jerry Tan`s lawyers wanted to prepare the draft deed. The plaintiffs` lawyers
agreed. Then, for some unrevealed reason the plaintiffs` lawyers sent a draft
to their counterpart on 26 July 2000. In the event, the deed was executed and
dated 3 August 2000.  
  
The plaintiffs` principal witness, Chan Swee Nee, the first vice president, in
his affidavit evidence-in-chief swore to the following statement:

> _In the meantime, the seventh defendant was negotiating a personal
> settlement with the plaintiffs. After discussions, the plaintiffs agreed to
> accept $400,000 from the seventh defendant in settlement of the plaintiffs`
> claim against him on the understanding that it will not release the other
> defendants._

  
  
I find and hold that the contents of the deed was a recreation of what had
been agreed earlier. It was not a sham. It contained nothing new. The
agreement did not extinguish the entire cause of action as such. It merely
released Jerry Tan from his personal liability and not the claim. This was
indicated in the letters and memorandum whose date appear in brackets:

> _`**release him** from the guarantee - **release one of the guarantors** `
> (memorandum 14 February 2000)_

> _`in full and final settlement of all claims whatsoever your clients may
> have against**our client** ` (15 February 2000 letter)_

> _`full and final settlement of all**claims against Tan Keok Kiang Andrew
> Jerry** `(24 February 2000 letter)_

> _`settlement of our clients` claim against**your client** ` (25 February
> 2000 letter)_

> _`**release our client** fully from all guarantees` (8 March 2000 letter).
> [Emphasis is added.]_

  
  
The deed of settlement accurately captured what had been agreed. The second
and sixth defendants were not released from their liability.  
  
The sense and substance of what I have said decrees me to give judgment for
the plaintiffs.  
  
There shall, therefore, be a judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum claimed
less $400,000 received plus interest and costs.  
  
**Outcome:**

Plaintiffs` claim allowed.
