Philip Pillai J:

1 This is an application by the Defendant, Metalform Asia Pte Ltd, for leave
to be granted to appeal to the Court of Appeal against my decision made on 17
September 2010 in Originating Summons No 1679 of 2007 ([2010] SGHC 280). I had
granted leave under s 49(5) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed)
(“AA”) to appeal against certain questions of law arising from an award issued
by the sole Arbitrator in SIA Arbitration No 069/DA17/05.

2 Section 49(7) of the AA provides that an appeal against a court decision to
grant or refuse leave to appeal requires the leave of the court. The Court of
Appeal construed “the court” in s 49 (7) to mean the High Court which granted
or refused the leave to appeal application under s 49(5) of the AA and no
further leave may be sought from the Court of Appeal (See _Ng Chin Siau and
others v How Kin Chuan_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 809, subject possibly to the
exceptional circumstances of _CGU International Insurance plc v AstraZeneca
Insurance Co Ltd_ [2006] EWCA Civ 1340).

3 The underlying policy of the AA is to promote finality of the arbitration
process and awards. The AA recognises party autonomy as parties have decided
to resolve their disputes by arbitration and not court actions. Section 49 of
the AA provides an exceptional recourse to the courts on questions of law only
where the rigorous statutorily prescribed conditions have been met.

4 I would adopt the approach set out in _Motor Image Enterprises Pte Ltd v
SCDA Architects Pte Ltd_ [2010] SGHC 278, _per_ Judith Prakash J at [28]:

The leave stage functions as a time and cost-saving filter against cases which
are not even open to serious doubt. (See _Antaios Compania SA v Salen
Rederierna AB_ (_The Antaios_) [1985] AC 191 (“ _The Antaios_ ”) at 206G–207C,
where Lord Diplock holds up the practice of the House of Lords in dealing with
petitions for leave to appeal from judgment of the Court of Appeal in civil
actions as an example to be followed: “generally a brief oral hearing _inter
partes_ is permitted of which the average duration is ten to fifteen minutes;
the parties are not allowed to use the hearing as an opportunity to argue the
appeal that is the subject of the petition.”). Whilst arguments for leave in
the courts here generally take somewhat longer than 15 minutes, the court
should hear only enough at the leave stage to adopt a provisional view on the
merits which allows it to decide whether a full-dress hearing is warranted. To
ask the court to hear enough at the leave stage to make final and conclusive
determinations would undermine the utility of the leave stage as a filter.

In short, I would be guided by the approach that leave to appeal should only
be granted in exceptional circumstances where there is a wider purpose in
having the Court of Appeal elucidate the statutory criteria of s 49 (5) of the
AA.

5 The applicant did not raise exceptional circumstances relating to the
elucidation of the criteria that would merit a substantive appeal. The
applicant repeated the arguments that had been fully argued and rejected in
the earlier appeal proceedings under s 49 of the AA. The applicant next
submitted that in the absence of any threshold or principles, the Court should
be guided by where the justice lies and obtaining certainty from the Court of
Appeal. No supporting authority was cited in support of this submission but in
any event I was not persuaded that either of these grounds were made out in
this case. To further introduce yet another layer of time and expense in an
appeal against the leave granted to appeal on the questions of law, would be
at variance with the parties’ agreement to resolve their disputes
expeditiously by arbitration within the prescribed framework of the AA.

6 Leave to appeal denied.

7 Costs of this application to be agreed or taxed.
