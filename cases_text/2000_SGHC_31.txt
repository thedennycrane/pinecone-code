_**GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT** **

The facts

**

1\. The plaintiff and her youngest son, the defendant, are the joint owners of
the flat known as Blk 232 Pending Road #08-21. They were allocated the flat in
1987 by the Housing and Development Board (‘HDB’) under its Resettlement
Scheme. At that stage, as all the plaintiff’s other children had grown up and
had their own properties, the defendant (then aged about 23) and she were the
only persons eligible to take up the offer of the flat.

2\. The flat cost $42,600. The only down payment required was the sum of $200,
which the plaintiff paid. The balance of the purchase price was settled by a
loan which the parties took from the HDB and the monthly instalment payable in
respect of this loan was approximately $233. As at July 1998, there was an
outstanding balance of $28,592.25 remaining due under the loan.

3\. The plaintiff and the defendant lived together in the flat from the time
of purchase up till August 1998. In that month, he hit his mother and the
plaintiff made a police report. The plaintiff also sought aid from the Legal
Aid Bureau and an officer from the Bureau went to interview the defendant.
After the interview, the defendant moved out of the flat and did not advise
the plaintiff of his new address. She has not seen him or spoken to him since
he left the flat.

4\. In April 1999, the plaintiff commenced this action whereby she asked for a
declaration that she was absolutely entitled to the flat and to have the title
in the flat transferred entirely to her. She also asked for an order that if
the defendant could not be traced or refused to convey his interest in the
flat to her, the Registrar of the Supreme Court be authorised to execute the
conveyance on his behalf.

5\. As the plaintiff was unaware of the defendant’s address, the originating
summons herein had to be served on him by way of substituted service. Pursuant
to a court order in that behalf, the originating summons was advertised in one
issue of the Lianhe Zaobao and copies were posted on the notice board of the
court. Service was effected in this manner in October 1999. Up to the time the
matter first came on for hearing before me on 31 January 2000, however, the
defendant had not entered an appearance. He did not appear, either, between
that date and my final order on the summons which was made on 22 February
2000.

6\. The plaintiff’s contention was that she was beneficially entitled to an
absolute interest in the flat to the exclusion of any beneficial interest on
the part of the defendant because she had made all the payments due in respect
of the purchase of the flat. Her evidence on affidavit was that until about
1997 she had earned an income as a part time casual worker. In addition, she
had received allowances from some of her nine children including from one son
who was a civil servant. That particular son gave her $600 to $700 a month
with which she supported herself and paid the instalments on the flat, the
conservancy charges and the property tax and other outgoings. The defendant
had never contributed anything towards the instalments for the flat. Nor had
he paid for any of the other expenses of the flat. He had not worked during
the ten years prior to the application and had often borrowed money from her.

7\. My first task was to decide whether to accept the plaintiff’s story that
she had made all the payments for the flat. I was mindful that I was hearing
only one side of the story since the defendant had not appeared and no one
else had given any evidence as to the plaintiff’s circumstances. The
plaintiff’s evidence was not, however, unsubstantiated.

8\. The plaintiff stated that she made payment of the instalments in cash. In
order to do so, she would go down each month to the HDB office at Marsiling
and her payment would be recorded in the receipt book issued by the HDB. In
support of this contention, she was able to produce copies of the relevant
receipt books. The HDB receipt books evidenced regular payment of the housing
loan instalments from July 1987 up to January 1994, from March 1994 up to
March 1998 and from April 1998 up to February 2000. The receipt books issued
by the Bukit Panjang Town Council evidenced payment of service and conservancy
charges from April 1990 up to March 1992 and she also produced a receipt book
from the Sembawang Town Council showing payment of these charges from
September 1999 to February 2000. The plaintiff explained that she had not been
able to find the other books evidencing payment of the service and conservancy
charges.

9\. The fact that the plaintiff had most of the relevant receipt books in her
possession to my mind showed, more probably than not, that she was the one who
had made the payments concerned. I therefore found that the plaintiff had paid
all or substantially all of the monies expended for the acquisition of the
flat up to the date of the application. It was also clear from the receipt
books that she had continued to pay the housing instalments after the filing
of the application and up to the date of the hearing.

10\. I therefore proceeded to consider the rights of the parties to the flat
on the basis that the plaintiff had been the sole contributor to the purchase
price.

**

Legal and beneficial ownership

**

11\. As joint tenants of the flat, the plaintiff and defendant have at law an
identical interest in the whole of the flat. The position is, however,
different in equity because of the way in which they paid for the flat. The
governing principle is that where two or more persons buy a property together
but pay for it in unequal shares, then even if they register themselves as
joint owners of the property, the law will presume that the express joint
tenancy has been severed in equity into an implied tenancy in common in
unequal shares proportioned to the amount of the purchase price contributed by
each co-owner. As Professor Tan Sook Yee puts it in _Principles of Singapore
Land Law_(at pp 91 to 92):

> ‘Equity leans in favour of tenancies in common in given situations because
> of the inherent unfairness of the right of survivorship that obtains where
> there is a joint tenancy. For example, where A and B have contributed to the
> purchase price of property in unequal shares or have lent money on mortgage,
> or are business partners but the conveyance contains no words of severance,
> at law there would be a joint tenancy. If they are also joint tenants in
> equity, on the death of one of the joint tenants, the surviving joint tenant
> will succeed to the ‘share’ of the deceased joint tenant by the right of
> survivorship, so that the estate of the deceased joint tenant will get
> nothing. In the circumstances, this result is manifestly unfair and equity
> will recognise that while A and B are joint tenants at law, they are also
> tenants in common in equity and each should be entitled to a share
> proportionate to his contribution. The net result is that A and B are joint
> tenants in law, holding in trust for themselves as tenants in common in
> shares proportionate to their contributions.’

Professor Tan goes on to state in a footnote that this is a resulting trust
and can be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.

12\. In the present case, if the flat were private property the position would
be free from doubt: the defendant and the plaintiff would be holding the
property in trust for themselves as tenants in common in shares proportionate
to their respective contributions which means that as the defendant
contributed nothing, he would be holding the whole of his legal share on trust
for the plaintiff. Nothing would have stood in the way of granting the
declaration sought by the plaintiff, except perhaps, the doctrine of
advancement. Quite apart from the question as to whether the presumption of
advancement applies when the parent purchasing the property is the mother
(though I myself do not see any objection in principle to its application in
this situation) I was satisfied here that, on the evidence, the presumption
had been rebutted. It was the plaintiff’s evidence that when she and her son
were originally named as co-lessees it had not been her intention to make him
a gift. I did not think it probable that a poor woman who was forced to
relocate from her home of 40 odd years, who could only afford to make a $200
down payment for her new home, and who was taking on a relatively huge
financial burden by borrowing the balance of the purchase price, would by
including her able-bodied and adult son as a co-lessee have been intending to
give him a half share in the flat gratis. It was much more probable that her
expectation at the time was that the defendant would work and contribute to
the loan instalments. She might even have expected him, in due course, to take
over the financial burden entirely. Such would have been the actions of a
filial and responsible son and it would not have been unreasonable on her part
to have contemplated this happening.

13\. Having settled in my mind that at common law the plaintiff was entitled
to the relief she sought, I had to consider, however, whether this common law
position had been affected by the provisions of the Housing and Development
Act, Cap 129 (‘the Act’) since the flat had been built by the HDB. This
question has also been considered in two recent cases: the Court of Appeal
decision of _Cheong Yoke Kuen & ors v Cheong Kwok Kiong _[1999] 2 SLR 476 and
the High Court decision _Hajjah Sitiawah Bee Bte Kader v Rosiyah Bte Abdullah_
(Originating Summons No. 10 of 1999, unreported). Both cases dealt with
situations in which claims were being made to beneficial interests in HDB
flats arising from resulting trusts.

14\. The starting point is s 51 of the Act. To paraphrase it, this provides by
ss (4) that no trust in respect of any flat which has been sold by the HDB
shall be created by the owner of the flat without the HDB’s prior written
approval. Further, ss (5) specifically declares void ‘every trust which
purports to be created’ in respect of any such flat without the prior approval
of the HDB. These provisions are an advance on the previous legislation which
did not even admit the possibility of a trust over an HDB flat being created
with the consent of the HDB. The reason for the change in legislation was that
Parliament recognised that there would be situations in which persons would
have legitimate reasons for creating trusts over HDB flats and that the evil
that the original legislation was intended to deal with (ie to prevent abuse
by persons not eligible for HDB flats from purchasing a flat in the name of a
nominee) could be eliminated without also eliminating all possibility of
creating a trust over an HDB flat.

15\. _Cheong Yoke Kuen’s_ case provides a graphic illustration of the manner
in which the amended s 51 still stamps out abuse of the HDB system. There an
HDB flat (the first flat) had been purchased in 1983 by the respondent and his
mother as joint tenants. The respondent alone paid for the flat. Subsequently,
he wished to purchase a second HDB flat for occupation by his family and
himself, leaving the first flat to be occupied by the mother alone. Under the
Act, the respondent was prohibited from buying a second flat while he remained
a co-owner of the first. He therefore transferred his share in the flat to his
mother and she became its sole legal owner. On her death, he asserted that the
transfer had led to a resulting trust in his favour and that the first flat
belonged to him solely and not to her estate.

16\. The Court of Appeal took the view that the respondent’s contention that
resulting trusts over HDB properties were not prohibited by s 51(4) of the Act
would give rise to a highly unsatisfactory result and would open the way to
abuse by persons who would and could easily purchase HDB properties through
nominees. In any event, the circumstances in which the respondent transferred
his entire interest in the flat to his mother showed that by that transfer he
intended that his mother would hold the flat on trust for him. The resulting
trust which arose was ‘created’ by the respondent and fell within the
prohibition of ss (4) and was void under ss (5) of the Act.

17\. The obvious difference between _Cheong’s_ case and the present is that
the parties here had no intention of circumventing any HDB regulation or
policy. Nor did they do so since the HDB has no interest in the proportions
inter se in which eligible persons hold HDB flats. The respondent in
_Cheong’s_ case, on the other hand, deliberately created the impression that
he no longer had any legal or beneficial interest in the first flat.

18\. Here both plaintiff and defendant were at all times the registered legal
owners of the flat and they were acceptable to the HDB as such. There was no
question of either of them having to get the other to act as the nominee
owner. At the beginning, the situation was unclear as to how the beneficial
interests were divided since the flat had to all intents and purposes not been
paid for. As time went on, each of the parties could have acquired a
substantial beneficial interest in the flat by contribution towards its
purchase price. As it happened, the defendant failed to make any contribution
leaving it to the plaintiff to bear the entire cost. As a result, she gained
an equitable interest in all, rather than a part, of the flat. This interest
was, I considered, implied in her favour by law (to reflect the equities of
the situation) rather than created by her. Although the respondent in
_Cheong’s_ case had not in the literal sense of the word ‘created’ a trust by
executing a trust document, he had taken a deliberate action to misrepresent
the ownership situation and thereby create the appearance of sole ownership in
his mother whilst all along intending to retain his own beneficial interest in
the first flat. In that way, he did, as the Court of Appeal held, in effect
create a trust in the flat in his favour. The Court of Appeal gave a purposive
definition to the word ‘created’ in the section so as to ensure that the
legislative intent to prevent nominee ownership would not be flouted.

19\. Although the type of trust which resulted from the legal implication I
have referred to, is commonly called a ‘resulting trust’, I was of the view
that since it was not created by the plaintiff either literally or in the
sense given to that word by the Court of Appeal it could be given effect to
despite the decision in _Cheong’s_ case. In my judgment, s 51 of the Act did
not render void the resulting trust which arose in favour of the plaintiff in
order to reflect the equitable position on the beneficial interests which she
and the defendant had in the flat. I therefore made a declaration that by
reason of the existence of an imputed trust in favour of the plaintiff, the
plaintiff was beneficially entitled to the whole of the flat and that the
defendant held his joint interest therein on trust for the plaintiff.

20\. Since making that declaration, I have read _Hajjah Sitiawah_ where in a
similar factual situation Rajendran J came to a similar conclusion. In that
case, the plaintiff and the defendant (who were mother and daughter
respectively) were the joint owners under a joint tenancy of an HDB flat in
Ang Mo Kio. Differences arose between them regarding the sale of the flat and
the defendant contended that as she had contributed all or the major portion
of the purchase price, she should be entitled to all or a major part of the
sale proceeds. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that as resulting
trusts were prohibited by s 51(4) of the Act, she and the defendant were
entitled to equal shares of the sale proceeds.

21\. Rajendran J found that the plaintiff had contributed approximately 23% of
the cost of the flat while the defendant had contributed the balance 77%. He
stated that if he were to apply equitable considerations in the case, he would
hold that an equitable tenancy in common existed and that the plaintiff there
held a 23% share in the flat whilst the defendant had a 77% share in it.

22\. In the course of his judgment, His Honour said (at paras 14 and 15):

> ’14. The parties, when they purchased this flat, had purchased it as joint
> tenants. There was no express intention at that time of creating any trusts.
> On one view, as the resulting trust in this case was not ‘created by the
> owners’ of the flat, but rather arose by presumption of law … it was a
> matter outside the scope of s 51 (4). The plaintiff and defendant in this
> case under the said presumption of law held the property in equity as
> tenants-in-common in the proportions of 23% and 77% respectively. As a
> matter of policy, I can see no objection to this result; the parties if they
> so desired could have themselves arranged for it at law by, in the first
> place, purchasing the flat as tenants-in-common in these percentages, or for
> that matter, in whatever percentages they desired. The plaintiff and the
> defendant, being acceptable to the HDB as joint tenants would have been
> equally acceptable as tenants-in-common of the flat.
>
> 15\. Would the position be any different, vis--vis the HDB, if the parties
> were tenants-in-common, not in law, but in equity? I cannot see why it
> should. Such a tenancy would not be a breach of the HDB Act since the
> underlying intent of s 51(4) was to prevent ineligible persons (as opposed
> to eligible persons like the plaintiff and the defendant in this case) from
> using such trusts to acquire interests in HDB flats, and thereby circumvent
> the intention of Parliament to confer the privileges of HDB housing only on
> persons fulfilling certain eligibility criteria.’

23\. The plaintiff in _Hajjah Sitiawah’s_ case relied on the _Cheong Yoke
Kuen_ decision to support her argument that in view of the provisions of s
51(4), a resulting trust could not arise. Rajendran J dealt with _Cheong’s_
case in some detail. He pointed out that there the trust which had attracted
the operation of s 51(4) of the Act was the resulting trust that the
respondent tried to ‘create’ when he divested himself of his legal interest in
the flat. In contrast, in _Hajjah Sitiawah’s_ case the conduct of the parties
remained within the parameters set by the HDB. His Honour then went on to
consider the statement by LP Thean JA in _Cheong’s_ case that in the court’s
view ‘the respondent’s contention that resulting trusts over HDB properties
are not prohibited by s 51(4) of the Act would give rise to a highly
unsatisfactory result and would open the way to abuse by person who would and
could easily purchase HDB properties through nominees’. Rajendran J made the
following comments (at para 20):

> ‘A closer scrutiny of this statement shows, however, that Thean JA was not,
> in this paragraph, making a blanket statement that all resulting trusts
> would be void under s 51(4). All that Thean JA was doing was rejecting the
> somewhat wide claim of the respondent in that case that (all) resulting
> trusts are not prohibited by s 51(4). That clearly could not be so. If a
> party sets about creating a situation where a resulting trust will arise in
> his favour in order to circumvent the provisions of the HDB flat (as was the
> situation in _Cheong Yoke Kuen_) the resulting trust so created would
> prohibited under s 51(4). The example that Thean JA gives in that paragraph
> that it cannot be right that a person who buys an HDB property in the name
> of a nominee and obtains a declaration of trust in his favour executed by
> the nominee would be caught by the provisions of s 51(4) but a person who
> does the same thing but without such declaration would not be caught as his
> interest would be that of a beneficiary under a resulting trust, was, in my
> view intended to do no more than illustrate the absurdity that would result
> if the submission that all resulting trusts are not within the prohibition
> envisaged in s 51(4) is upheld. In my view, paragraph 19 of the judgment of
> the Court of Appeal must be interpreted in the negative to mean simply that
> not all resulting trusts are outside the scope of the section. What Thean JA
> stated in the following sentences of the judgment (at paragraph 20) confirm
> this’.

24\. I respectfully agree with the reasoning in the paragraphs cited above and
adopt it as an additional ground for my finding that the trust in this case
was a valid one enforceable by the plaintiff.
