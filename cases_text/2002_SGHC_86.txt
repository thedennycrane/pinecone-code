**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. The plaintiffs, Mae Engineering Ltd ("Mae"), are a company incorporated in
Singapore carrying out the business of mechanical and electrical ("M&E")
engineering. The defendants, Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd ("Dragages"), are a
company incorporated in Singapore carrying on the business of building
contractors. Dragages was engaged by Precious Treasure Pte Ltd ("the
Employer") for the conservation, fitting out and other related works relating
to the restoration of the Fullerton Building. Dragages entered into a sub-
contract with Mae to carry out certain M&E works for the sum of $22.77 million
subject to variations.

2\. Clause 17 of the sub-contract with Mae laid down the procedure that was to
be followed in making progress payments to Mae:

> "17(3) The Contractor shall after having received the Employer’s/Architect’s
> certificate relative to the Main Contract, issue an Interim Certificate to
> the Sub-Contractor showing the amounts which have been accepted for payment
> by the Contractor taking into account the real progress achieved during the
> month less a deduction of retention money at the rate of ten percent (10%)
> of the value of the Interim Payment up to a maximum retention of five
> percent (5%) of the Sub-Contract Price _and less any back charges due_ by
> the Sub-Contractor to the Contractor.
>
> 17(4) The Sub-Contractor shall raise an invoice in the amount stated on the
> Interim Certificate and forward this to the Contractor for payment together
> with a copy of the Interim Certificate.
>
> 17(5) Within thirty (30) days of his receiving from the Employer on account
> of the Main Works any payment which includes a sum in respect of the Sub-
> Contract Works properly executed, the Contractor shall pay to the Sub-
> Contractor the amount shown on the Interim Certificate providing the Sub-
> Contractor has provide (sic) his invoice as required under 17(4)."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

Pursuant to the sub-contract, Dragages on 17 February 2001 issued to Mae an
Interim Payment Certificate No. 27 certifying the total value of M&E works for
November 2000 to be $2,058,742.73. Mae, on 17 February 2001, in accordance
with cl 17(4), forwarded to Dragages their invoice No. 8150 for payment of
that sum of $2,058,742.73 ($2,120,486.47 inclusive of GST). On 15 March 2001,
Dragages issued to Mae Interim Payment Certificate No. 28 certifying the total
value of M&E works for December 2000 to be $581,479.06. Based on Certificate
No. 28, Mae, on 30 March 2001 in accordance with cl 17(4), forwarded their
invoice No. 8470 for the said sum ($598,923.43 inclusive of GST). By the terms
of cl 17(5), Dragages was obliged to pay Mae, within 30 days of receipt of
amounts stated in the Employer’s/Architect’s Certificate, the amount stated in
the Interim Certificate provided Mae has issued the invoice called for under
cl 17(4).

3\. Despite requests from Mae, Dragages did not pay the sums due under Interim
Certificates No. 27 and 28 to Mae. Instead, Dragages, on 25 April 2001 and 18
May 2001, issued revised Interim Payment Certificates No. 27A and 28 (Revised)
to replace Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28 respectively. In revised Interim
Certificate No. 27A, Dragages deducted $1,191,061.28 from the amount certified
as due and payable to Mae in Interim Certificate No. 27 and tendered to Mae
the (balance) sum of $850,689.74 after such deduction. In Interim Certificate
No. 28 (Revised), Dragages deducted $227,885.91 from the amount certified as
due in Interim Certificate No. 28 and tendered to Mae the (balance) sum of
$347,125.74 after such deduction. Mae accepted, under protest, the two sums
tendered as part-payment of the amounts due to Mae under Interim Certificates
No. 27 and 28\. Based on Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28, there would still
be a sum of $1,461,515.60 due to Mae. No explanation was given to Mae at that
time for the deductions.

4\. The sub-contract with Mae contained, in cl 31, an arbitration clause which
read:

> "31(1) _If any dispute arises between the Contractor and the Sub-Contractor
> in connection with this Sub-Contract, it shall, subject to the provisions of
> this clause, be referred to the arbitration and final decision of a single
> arbitrator_ to be agreed upon between the parties or failing agreement by
> either party within twenty eight (28) days of being requested in writing by
> the other party to be nominated by the President of the Singapore
> International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) _and any such references shall be a
> submission to arbitration in accordance with and subject to the provisions
> of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10)_ or any statutory modification thereof for
> the time being in force in Singapore and the rules of the SIAC."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

Mae, on 24 July 2001, gave notice of arbitration under cl 31. It would be
relevant to note that the disputes in respect of which Mae sought arbitration
were very much broader in scope and involved very much larger sums of money
than the claims Mae had against Dragages for the balance amount of
$1,461,515.60 under Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28. Pursuant to the notice
of arbitration, the parties agreed to the appointment of Mr Alan Thambiah as
arbitrator and Mr Thambiah has given directions in respect of the arbitration.

5\. The obligation, under cl 17(5), for Dragages to pay to Mae the amounts in
respect of the M&E works due under the Interim Certificates would arise only
upon Dragages receiving the said amounts from the Employer. At the time Mae
commenced arbitration proceedings, Mae did not know whether or not Dragages
had received payment of the said amounts. It was only in September 2001 that
Mae learnt that Dragages had received that payment in full from the Employer.

6\. Upon learning that Dragages had in fact been paid by the Employer for
those M&E works, Mae instituted Suit No. 1291/01 in the High Court for the
recovery of the amount of $1,461.515.60 remaining unpaid under Interim
Certificates No. 27 and 28. In its Points of Claim filed thereafter in the
arbitration proceedings, Mae adverted to that suit and stated that its claims
in the arbitration under Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28 were "strictly
without prejudice to [Mae’s] claim in Suit No. 1291 of 2001/E … and is without
prejudice to [Mae’s] contention that the said monies are indisputably due and
owing".

7\. Following the commencement of the suit, Mae, by way of SIC No. 2571/01,
commenced Order 14 proceedings against Dragages for the outstanding amount of
$1,461,515.60 under Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28. Dragages, for its
part, in SIC No. 2822/01 sought, under s 7 of the Arbitration Act (Ch 10), to
have all further proceedings in Suit No. 1291/2001 stayed.

8\. The applications in SIC No. 2571/01 and 2822/01 were heard by the Senior
Assistant Registrar ("SAR") on 7 December 2001. The SAR dismissed Dragages’
application in SIC No. 2822/01 for a stay proceedings and granted Mae’s
application for summary judgment. This is an appeal by Dragages against both
these decisions.

9\. Where parties have, by contract, agreed that any dispute between them is
to be resolved by arbitration, the court will not sanction a departure from
that agreement except for sufficient reason. This is apparent from s 7 of the
Arbitration Act which reads:

> "7(1) If any party to an arbitration agreement, or any person claiming
> through or under him, commenced any legal proceedings against any other
> party to the arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through or under
> him, in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to the legal
> proceedings may at any time after appearance, and before delivering any
> pleadings or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to the court
> to stay the proceedings.
>
> 7(2) The court or a judge thereof, _if satisfied that there is no sufficient
> reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the
> arbitration agreement_ , and that the applicant was, at the time when the
> proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all
> things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, _may make an
> order staying the proceedings_."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

Section 7(2) of the Arbitration Act, in effect puts the burden on the party
applying for a stay to satisfy the court that there is sufficient reason why
the agreement between the parties to refer any dispute between them to
arbitration should not prevail and why the court should, instead, assume
jurisdiction.

10\. The scope of the court’s discretion under s 7(2) of the Arbitration Act
was considered by the Court of Appeal in the case of _Kwan Im Tong Chinese
Temple v Fong Choon Hung Construction Pte Ltd_ [1998] 2 SLR 143. In that case
the trial judge dealing with an application for stay under s 7 of the
Arbitration Act had taken the view that the contractor was prima facie
entitled to summary judgment for the amount stated to be due to the contractor
under an Interim Certificate and that it was for the employer to show that the
employer had a bona fide defence to that claim. In rejecting that approach
Karthigesu JA, delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal, said at page
143:

> "This approach may or may not be consonant with the O 14 principles
> applicable in our courts but it certainly is not consonant with s 7 of the
> Arbitration Act which guides that the burden shall fall on the plaintiffs in
> the action (the contractors) to show cause to the contrary to allowing a
> stay."

11\. The trial judge in the _Kwan Im Tong_ case had gone on to consider in
detail the affidavit evidence before him and had arrived at the conclusion
that the employer had no valid defences to the claim by the contractor. The
trial judge had, on that ground, dismissed the application for stay. The Court
of Appeal took the view that it was not appropriate for a court hearing an
application for stay to embark on such an exercise. In the words of Karthigesu
JA at page 141:

> "The learned judge, in determining whether there was a dispute that fell
> within cl 15 to be referred to arbitration, applied principles used in
> summary judgment proceedings to examine whether the employers’ cross-claim
> had sufficient validity to resist the contractors’ prima facie entitlement
> to the sum certified by the architect. While the learned judge’s application
> of the law was not wrong, applying summary judgment principles should not be
> held to be an exhaustive means of weighing the claims. The learned judge has
> essentially held that prima facie the contractors are entitled to their
> claim for $55,590.42 unless the employers can demonstrate a valid set-off.
> _It is our view that while O 14 summary judgment principles aid the court
> with determining whether a claim should be immediately allowed in very
> obvious cases, applications for a stay such as the present one relate to a
> larger issue of jurisdiction. With respect, it does not appear entirely safe
> to determine whether parties should be bound by their agreement to arbitrate
> according to principles established to deal with very obvious claims to
> which there is no defence_."

> (Emphasis added.)

Karthigesu JA then went on to endorse and adopt the following observation that
Parker LJ made in _Home and Overseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co
(UK) Ltd_ [1990] 1 WLR 153 at pages 158 and 159:

> "The purpose of Order 14 is to enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment
> where there is plainly no defence to the claim. … But Order 14 proceedings
> should not in my view be allowed to become a means for obtaining, in effect,
> an immediate trial of an action, which will be the case if the court lends
> itself to determining on Order 14 applications points of law which may take
> hours or even days and the citation of many authorities before the court is
> in a position to arrive at a final decision.

> _
>
> In cases where there is an arbitration clause it is in my judgment the more
> necessary that full scale argument should not be permitted. The parties have
> agreed on their chosen tribunal and a defendant is entitled prima facie to
> have the dispute decided by that tribunal in the first instance, to be free
> from the intervention of the courts
>
> _ …
>
> … In very clear cases a plaintiff is no doubt entitled to his summary
> judgment notwithstanding the clause …"
>
> (Emphasis added.)

Karthigesu JA described these observations as "a timely reminder that the
basis on which the application for stay is brought is a contract wherein
parties have chosen arbitration over the litigation process as the forum for
the resolution of their disputes."

12\. Although the Court of Appeal in _Kwan Im Tong_ had alluded to an
application for a stay as one that related to the larger issue of
jurisdiction, it nevertheless envisaged that there were circumstances where a
stay ought not to be granted. In this respect the court cited with approval
the decision in _Channel Tunnel Group Ltd & Anor v Balfour Beatty Construction
Ltd & Ors_ [1993] 1 All ER 664, in particular what where Lord Mustill stated
at page 680:

> "If the plaintiff to an action which the defendant has applied to stay can
> show that there is no defence to the claim, the court is enabled at one and
> the same time to refuse the defendant a stay and to give final judgment for
> the plaintiff. … _I believe however that care should be taken not to confuse
> a situation in which the defendant disputes the claim on grounds which the
> plaintiff is very likely indeed to overcome, with the situation in which the
> defendant is not really raising a dispute at all_."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

The Court of Appeal also adopted the following approach which Selvam JC (as he
then was) took in _Uni-Navigation Pte Ltd v Wei Loong Shipping Pte Ltd_ [1993]
1 SLR 876:

> "The common form arbitration agreement provides for disputes to be decided
> by arbitrators. _In such a case the court should, save in obvious cases,
> adopt a holistic and commonsense approach to see if there is a dispute_. The
> justification for this approach is that it is important to hold a party to
> his agreement and avoid double and split hearing of matters. ... If the
> defendant, therefore, makes out a prima facie case of disputes the courts
> should not embark on an examination of the validity of the dispute as though
> it were an application for summary judgment."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

13\. Mr Tan Kok Quan SC, who appeared for Mae, submitted that the court in
this case should assume jurisdiction because there could really be no dispute
between the parties insofar as the payments due to Mae under Interim
Certificates No. 27 and 28 were concerned that ought to be referred for
arbitration. He argued that as all the requirements of cl 17 of the sub-
contract – including the requirement in cl 17(5) that before the obligation to
pay arises, Dragages must have received payment from the Employer for the sub-
contract works in question – had been fulfilled, the contractual obligation of
Dragages to make payment under Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28 had
crystallised and it was not open to Dragages to resile from those obligations
by the issue of fresh revised Interim Certificates.

14\. Mr Wong Meng Meng SC, counsel for Dragages, argued on the other hand that
the fact that Mae had referred their claim arising from Certificates No. 27
and 28 to arbitration was itself evidence of a "dispute". The fact that Mae
rejected Dragages’ right to issue revised Interim Certificates in place of
Interim Certificates already issued, he submitted, was also evidence of a
dispute between the parties.

15\. Mr Wong also referred the court to cl 17(8) of the sub-contract. Clause
17(8) reads:

> "17(8) Nothing in this Clause shall modify or abrogate the Contractor’s
> right to deduct from or set off against any money due to the Sub-Contractor
> under this Sub-Contract (including retention money) any sum or sums which
> the Sub-Contractor is or may be liable to pay to the Contractor in respect
> of any claim or counterclaim against the Sub-Contractor whether or not
> arising out of any default, breach or non-performance of this Sub-Contract."

The effect of cl 17(8), he submitted, was to reserve Dragages’ right to deduct
or set off any claims that Dragages has or may have against Mae from amounts
due to Mae. Dragages, he submitted, had claims against Mae arising from:

> (a) Backcharges ($141,722.80);
>
> (b) Cost of rectifying defects in the sub-contract works ($330,000); and
>
> (c) Adjustments to the final accounts that the Employer may make.

and Dragages, in deducting those claims from the amounts due to Mae under
Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28 was exercising its rights under cl 17(8).
Mae, he submitted, may well dispute these claims but as the parties had agreed
that disputes between them should be submitted to arbitration effect should be
given to that agreement and the court should grant the stay prayed for.

16\. Mr Tan submitted that the Court of Appeal in the _Kwan Im Tong_ case did
not go so far as to say that a bare allegation of a dispute would suffice for
a matter to be stayed pending arbitration. Before a court can decide whether
or not there was a dispute, the court would have to weigh the claims of both
parties. For this purpose, he submitted – quoting from the judgment of Selvam
JC referred to above – that the court should adopt "a holistic and commonsense
approach to see if there is a dispute". How far the courts should delve into
the facts to ascertain whether it was a genuine dispute was a matter, he
submitted, that would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. In
respect of the three heads of claim relied on by Dragages, Mr Tan made the
following points:

_**

  
Claim for backcharges

**_.

17\. Clause 17(3) of the sub-contract specifically allows Dragages to make
deductions in the Interim Certificate for any back payments "due" from Mae. Mr
Tan submitted that the backcharges deducted in this case from Interim
Certificates No. 27 and 28 only became "due" after the dates the Interim
Certificates No. 27 and 28 had been issued. In support, he pointed out that
Dragages had (at page 412 of their first affidavit) admitted that these
backcharges were in fact to be deducted from Interim Certificates No. 29 and
30. Mr Tan submitted that in these circumstances Dragages was not entitled to
deduct the said backcharges from Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28.

_**

  
Cost of rectifying defects

**_.

18\. The relevant clause in the sub-contract dealing with the obligation of
Mae to rectify defects in its works is in cl 16(2) which reads:

> "16(2) After completion of the Main Works or of the last of the sections
> thereof in which the Sub-Contract Works are comprised, as the case maybe,
> _the Sub-Contractor_ shall maintain the Sub-Contract Works and _shall make
> good such defects and imperfections therein as the Contractor is liable to
> make good under the Main Contract_ for the like period and otherwise upon
> the like terms as the Contractor is liable to do under the Main Contract.
>
> _
>
> If the Sub-Contractor shall fail to do any such work as aforesaid required
> by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to carry out such work
> by his own workmen or by
>
> _ other contractors and if such work is work which the Sub-Contractor should
> have carried out at the Sub-Contractor’s own cost _the Contractor shall be
> entitled to recover from the Sub-Contractor the cost thereof or deduct the
> same from any monies due or which may become due to the Sub-Contractor_."
>
> (Emphasis added.)

By the terms of cl 16(2), Dragages can proceed to make good any defects in the
sub-contract works and recover the costs of such works only if Mae fails to
carry out the necessary works. Mr Tan pointed out that Dragages had in fact
requested Mae to rectify certain defects – which were in any event of a minor
nature – and Mae was attending to those rectification works. Dragages, he
pointed out, had not alleged that because Mae refused to carry out the
rectification works Dragages itself had effected the rectification. He
submitted that, in those circumstances, Dragages was not entitled to claim any
monies from Mae in respect of rectification works and could not make any
deductions in respect thereof from the Interim Certificates.

19\. Mr Tan also submitted that Dragages cannot just arbitrarily pick a figure
out of the air and say that that would be the cost of carrying out
rectification works. He pointed out that absolutely no evidence, not even a
quotation, had been produced by Dragages to show the sum of $330,000 deducted
for such works was arrived at.

_**

  
Possible adjustments to final accounts

**_.

20\. Under this head, Dragages was providing for a possible downward
evaluation of Mae’s works in the final accounts. Mr Tan submitted that
Dragages cannot raise a set off or a counterclaim based on a "possible"
revaluation in the future. The amount that Dragages deducted under this head
was, he submitted, picked out of the air. I would note here that Dragages did
not, in so many words, specify the amount deducted under this head. The amount
deducted would presumably be the difference between the total amounts deducted
in the revised Interim Certificates [No. 27A and 28 (Revised)] and amounts
deducted in those revised Interim Certificates for backcharges and
rectification works.

_**

  
Bona fide disputes?

**_

21\. Mr Wong had raised the three claims referred to above as claims that gave
Dragages a right of set off under cl 17(8) of the sub-contract. It is true
that cl 17(8) preserved Dragages’ right of set off but such a right, as Mr Tan
has correctly stated, can exist only in respect of set offs recognised in law
or permitted under the sub-contract.

22\. The sub-contract permits backcharges to be deducted in an Interim
Certificate only if the backcharges are "due" at the time the Interim
Certificate was issued. In the present case, Dragages purported to deduct
backcharges from Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28 that were not due at that
time. They therefore had no mandate to make that deduction.

23\. Deductions in respect of the costs of rectification works, can, by the
terms of the sub-contract, be made by Dragages for the costs of any
rectification works only if Mae failed to carry out such works and Dragages
had stepped in to carry out that rectification works. That did not happen in
this case.

24\. The deductions for possible adjustments were also no more than mere
speculation on the part of Dragages. No rational basis for this speculation
was provided nor was any rational explanation proffered as to how the
deductions were quantified. Clause 17(6) of the sub-contract which deals with
final accounts does not say that progress payments can be withheld pending the
issuance of the final accounts. In this regard, the words of Lawton J in
_Ellis Mechanical Services Ltd v Wates Construction Ltd_ [1978] 1 LLR 33 at
page 36 is apposite:

> "If the main contractor can turn round, as the main contractor has done in
> this case, and say ‘ _Well, I don’t accept your account; therefore there is
> a dispute_ ’, that dispute must be referred to arbitration and the
> arbitration must take its ordinary long and tedious course. _Then the sub-
> contractor is put into considerable difficulties; he is deprived of his
> commercial lifeblood_. It seems to me that the administration of justice in
> our Courts should do all it can to restore that lifeblood as quickly as
> possible."

> (Emphasis added.)

25\. Although Mr Tan’s criticism of the three heads of deduction raised by
Dragages were cogent, the reference by the Court of Appeal in _Kwan Im Tong_
to the larger issue of jurisdiction and the criticism of the trial judge by
the Court of Appeal for having undertaken an extensive appraisal of the
affidavit evidence before him, led me to the initial view that this appeal
should be allowed on the grounds that as there was an arbitration clause in
the sub-contract which Mae had in fact invoked, the parties should seek their
remedies before the arbitrator.

26\. However, having heard further arguments from counsel and bearing in mind
the words of Lawton J in _Ellis v Wates Construction_ that interim payments
are the lifeblood of the sub-contractors and the courts should do all it can
to restore that lifebood as quickly as possible, I formed the view that my
first reading of _Kwan Im Tong_ was overly cautious. The Court of Appeal in
_Kwan Im Tong_ had recognised that there were circumstances when the courts
should, despite the existence of an arbitration clause, assume jurisdiction to
adjudicate the matter. The Court of Appeal had, after all, endorsed the view
expressed by Lord Mustill in the _Channel Tunnel_ case that if a plaintiff can
show that the defendant has no defence to the claim, the court is enabled at
one and the same time to refuse the defendant a stay and give final judgment
for the plaintiff.

27\. In the present case, even though I had to consider in some detail the
evidence adduced before me, I was at the end of it satisfied that there was
really no basis whatsoever for Dragages to make the deductions that it made
from Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28. It could, in my view, safely be said
that there really was no dispute at all between Dragages and Mae in connection
with the amounts that were certified as due to Mae under the Interim
Certificates. By issuing the revised Interim Certificates containing
deductions, Dragages, it seemed to me, was merely trying to delay payment of
the sums so certified. I am satisfied that the rights of set off claimed by
Dragages had no basis whatsoever and that in this case it could, to paraphrase
Lord Mustill, safely be said that Dragages was "not really raising a dispute
at all".

28\. I now turn to consider Mr Wong’s submission that because Mae had already
instituted arbitration proceedings, Mae should be precluded from continuing
with the court proceedings in Suit No. 1291/01. Dragages’ obligation to pay
Mae the amounts certified in the Interim Certificates arises [by virtue of cl
17(5)] only after Dragages has recovered those amounts from the Employer. Mae,
at the time it commenced the arbitration proceedings, did not know that the
Employer had already paid to Dragages in full the amounts certified under
Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28. As soon as Mae realised that Dragages had
been paid those amounts in full and Mae therefore could make an immediate
claim against Dragages for the said, Mae commenced these proceedings. In so
doing, Mae made it clear in the arbitration proceedings that its claim under
Interim Certificates No. 27 and 28 in the arbitration were without prejudice
to its claims in Suit No. 1291/01. In these circumstances, I do not think that
it could be said that Mae was precluded from commencing these proceedings or
that it should be precluded from continuing these proceedings.

29\. There is another and more fundamental reason to arrive at the conclusion
that there was in fact no "dispute" between the parties that ought to be
referred for arbitration. Dragages under its contract with Mae had to make
progress payments to Mae in accordance with the procedures stipulated in cl 17
of the sub-contract. Clause 17(5) makes it mandatory for Dragages to pay Mae
the amount stated in an Interim Certificate within 30 days of receipt from the
Employer of monies relating to that Interim Certificate provided Mae has
rendered its invoice under cl 17(4).

30\. In this case, Mae had rendered its invoice under cl 17(4) and the
Employer had made the relevant payments in full to Dragages. In such a
situation, Dragages was contractually bound to pay the monies over to Mae. If
Dragages had any rights of set off, those rights ought to have been exercised
before the Interim Certificate was issued. Not having done so and the
contractual obligation to pay having crystallised, it was no longer open to
Dragages to unilaterally vary those contractual obligations by issuing revised
Interim Certificates to replace Interim Certificates already issued. There is
in fact no provision in the sub-contract for the unilateral issue of such
revised Interim Certificates.

31\. The only remedy that Dragages had, if indeed it had overlooked a
deduction that it ought to have made in an Interim Certificate it has issued,
is to make that deduction in any subsequent Interim Certificate that it may
issue or in the final accounts. There can, in my view, be no "dispute" on this
matter. This is therefore, in my view, a proper case for the court to refuse
the application under s 7(2) of the Arbitration Act for a stay.

32\. For the above reasons, I dismiss this appeal with costs. The Senior
Assistant Registrar’s decision refusing Dragages’ application for stay and the
Senior Assistant Registrar’s decision granting Mae’s application for summary
judgment is upheld.
