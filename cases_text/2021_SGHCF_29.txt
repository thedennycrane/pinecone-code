Debbie Ong J:

Introduction

1 These are the grounds of my decision on the “Ancillary Matters” following
the divorce of the parties in this case. The main area of dispute concerned
the division of matrimonial assets falling under s 112 of the Women’s Charter
(Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “Women’s Charter”). The issues raised include how
an inter-spousal gift during marriage ought to be treated, and how to
characterise shares existing at the time of divorce in light of claims that
they could be traced to shares gifted before marriage.

Facts

2 The plaintiff (the “Wife”) and the defendant (the “Husband”) were married on
17 September 2001. The Interim Judgment of Divorce (“IJ”) was granted on 26
February 2019. The ancillary matters (the “AM”) were initially fixed for
hearing on 30 November 2020. That hearing was adjourned as the lead counsel
for the Husband had a medical certificate stating that he was unfit for work
and to attend court for 5 days. The AM hearings were re-fixed and heard over
two mornings on 15 and 18 March 2021.

3 This was a marriage that lasted about 17 years. The parties have one child,
[Q], who will be 19 years old in 2021. The Husband has another daughter [R],
aged 22, from a previous relationship; [R] has lived in the parties’ household
during the marriage since 2005. The Wife is 49 years old and a homemaker who
receives about $13,000 per month from rent and investments. The Husband is 68
years old and a retired businessman who earns about $233,530 per year,
inclusive of rental income.

4 I highlighted to both parties’ counsel that the joint summary of relevant
information (“Joint Summary”) that the parties had jointly submitted is a key
document which I would use as a summary of their latest submissions on their
respective positions. I made it clear that the positions stated therein would
represent their final positions which will be relied on in coming to my
decision. In view of some changes to the parties’ positions reflected in the
respective written submissions, the Joint Summary dated 20 November 2020 was
updated at the AM hearing.

Custody, care and control and access

5 The custody, care and control and access of Q were not issues before this
court. Pursuant to the Consent Order dated 5 July 2019, the parties have joint
custody over Q, with the Wife having sole care and control. The Husband has
reasonable access which is arranged directly with Q.

Division of assets

6 As a general position, all matrimonial assets and liabilities should be
identified at the time of the IJ and valued at the time of the AM hearing. It
is noted that the balances in bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts
are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as the matrimonial assets are the
moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves. Thus, in general,
available values as close to the AM hearing date as possible will be used.
Nevertheless, where parties have specifically agreed to use a value for the
asset or liability as at a different date, I will adopt that value instead.
The parties agreed that, in general, the date for ascertaining the pool of
assets is the IJ date and the date for valuing those assets is the date of the
AM hearing (or a date closest to it).

7 In the present case, the parties agreed on the values of all assets as
listed in the Joint Summary save for the two cars, SKE XX18 P and SCM XX83 S.
The parties agreed to the exchange rate of SGD1: RMB4.96. Where “$” is used on
its own, it refers to the Singapore dollar. I have used only whole dollar
values in assigning values; the values in cents are dropped as they are de
minimis in light of the large total value of the assets.

8 The main dispute was over the Husband’s shares in two companies, [LB] and
[J], which the Husband claimed are pre-marital gifts and hence should be
excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife claimed that these
assets should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets.

34\. | Pearl|  15,000   
Total Net Value of Undisputed Matrimonial Assets| 39,249,546  
  
10 In respect of the Raffles Town Club membership, the Husband’s estimated
value as reflected in the Joint Summary is “$8k to $8.5k”. At the AM hearing,
both parties were agreeable to taking its value at $8,250, representing the
mid-point between the range of values which the Husband had suggested. Hence
by the parties’ agreement, the value of $8,250 is used in the table above. In
any case, this is a relatively small sum in light of the total pool of
matrimonial assets.

11 In respect of the valuation of all the parties’ properties (ie, properties
at [Property M], [Property R1], [Property R2], and [Property B]), I adopt the
values agreed upon by both parties in the Joint Summary. These values
($23,000,000; $2,920,000; $2,940,000; and $8,500,000) were obtained in July
2019 from Colliers, which was jointly appointed by parties, and agreed to by
counsel for the parties at the AM hearing.

12 As for Property R1 which is valued at $2,920,000, I found that this
property is a matrimonial asset even though the property was purchased by the
Husband in May 1994 prior to the marriage. At the AM hearing, counsel for the
Husband confirmed that the mortgage was paid off in full in 2004 (after the
marriage). It was hence not disputed that at least part of the property was
paid for during the marriage. It was also not disputed that the parties used
this property for shelter during the course of the marriage for a substantial
period of about five years during their 17-year marriage. As such, this is a
matrimonial asset within the meaning of s 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s
Charter.

Disputed matrimonial assets

13 The parties disputed the status (whether a matrimonial or non-matrimonial
asset) or the valuation of some assets which I address here.

(A) Vehicles SKE XX18 P and SCM XX83 S

14 The Husband owns two Porsche cars in his name, referred to by their
registration numbers here – SKE XX18 P and SCM XX83 S. The parties agreed that
the cars are matrimonial assets. However, they disagreed on the valuation of
the cars.

15 The Wife submitted that the value of both vehicles is $120,000 each.
According to the Wife, these values are based off “ads of cars of a similar
make and model on a resale website. These showed that the value of the cars
was between $120,000 to 130,000.” She also appreciated that the range of
prices are the advertised price and the cars might hence “not be sold at the
listed price”. Taking this into account, the Wife relied on the “lower range
of these values”. At the AM hearing, counsel for the Wife also clarified that
the Husband’s valuation was not based “on the scrap value of the car” but
nevertheless maintained that the Husband’s valuation was inaccurate.

16 The Husband submitted that the value of SKE XX18 P should be $109,052 while
the value of SCM XX83 S is $73,000. According to the Husband, these values are
based on the “Open Market Value” (“OMV”) stated in the Land Transport
Authority (“LTA”) Vehicle Enquiry results. He also submitted that, for SCM
XX83 S, the Husband’s Cayenne model is “much older” than the one that the Wife
referred to in the advertisement.

17 The LTA does not maintain a registry of market prices for vehicles. It is
apparent that the OMV is defined as the price payable when a vehicle is
imported into Singapore, which includes purchase price, freight, insurance and
all other charges incidental to the sale and delivery of the car to Singapore.
Hence LTA’s OMV does not reflect the market sale value of the cars in
Singapore. In any case, the OMV for SKE XX18 P of $109,052 was for January
2012 and the OMV for SCM XX83 S of $73,200 was for May 2004.

18 On the evidence before me, I accepted that the Wife’s estimates are
generally more reflective of the true market value of the cars in Singapore
but I did not take the Wife’s valuations at their face values. It was not
disputed that price listings on sgCarMart are nevertheless not the most
reflective of the cars’ true market value since advertisements tend to be
higher than the market value. I thought that a discount should be applied to
account for this. I applied a 10% discount for SKE XX18 P and thought that
$108,000 would be a fair estimate for the Husband’s Porsche Panamera. I was
mindful that the Husband’s SCM XX83 S is older than those in the
advertisements on sgCarMart and accordingly apply a 20% discount. I found that
$96,000 would be a fair estimate for the Husband’s Porsche Cayenne. I included
SKE XX18 P and SCM XX83 S at the respective values of $108,000 and $96,000
into the pool of matrimonial assets.

(B) [LB] Shares

19 An issue raised by the parties with respect to the [LB] and [J] shares ([J]
shares are discussed in the next section) was whether the Husband’s original
shares in these companies are pre-marital gifts or simply pre-marital assets
acquired before the marriage. The Husband contended that all of his initial
shares were gifts from his father who set up [LB] in 1974. The Wife contended
that the Husband “ha[d] not provided an iota of proof to show how these were
gifts from his Father/Brother and the Husband's claims on these fronts must be
rejected.” In my view, regardless of whether the shares are pre-marital gifts
or assets acquired by effort before marriage, such original shares were prima
facie excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. The significance of
whether a pre-marital asset is also a gift lay with the applicable formula for
the transformation of such assets in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. In the
present case, since it was not disputed that the original shares were not
substantially improved by the Wife or ordinarily used or enjoyed by the family
for shelter (or as a matrimonial home), transportation, household, education,
recreational, social or aesthetic purposes (see s 112(10)(a)(i) and (ii)),
whether they were acquired by effort or by gift was not relevant. The
Husband’s original shares, being pre-marriage assets, were prima facie
excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife’s basis for including
some of the Husband’s current shares into the pool did not rely on the
transformation of the original shares; her case was that they were acquired
during marriage.

20 The more pertinent issue and indeed the main difficulty in respect of the
Husband’s shareholdings in the two companies was the connection between the
Husband’s current shares and the shares that he acquired prior to the marriage
(regardless of whether the acquisition was by effort or gift). In USB v USA
and another appeal [2020] 2 SLR 588 (“USB”), the Court of Appeal held at
[31]–[32] that:

… When a marriage is dissolved, in general all the parties’ assets will be
treated as matrimonial assets unless a party is able to prove that any
particular asset was either not acquired during the marriage or was acquired
through gift or inheritance and is therefore not a matrimonial asset. The
party who asserts that an asset is not a matrimonial asset or that only a part
of its value should be included in the pool bears the burden of proving this
on the balance of probabilities. This rule obviates many difficulties that may
arise in the court’s fact-finding exercise and is consistent with the general
approach to legal burdens in civil matters.

Conversely, we might add, where an asset is prima facie not a matrimonial
asset, the burden would lie on the party asserting that it is a matrimonial
asset to show how it was transformed. For example, in our recent decision in
TQU v TQT [2020] SGCA 8, it was undisputed that a property at Pender Court was
a gift from the husband’s father to the husband prior to the marriage (at
[50]). The burden then fell on the wife to produce evidence that the property
had been used as a matrimonial home and had therefore been transformed into a
matrimonial asset, or that she had made substantial improvements to the
property during the marriage (at [55]).

[emphasis added]

21 Similarly, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) made similar remarks in Ang
Teng Siong v Lee Su Min [2000] 1 SLR(R) 908 at [11]:

… Now, therefore, if one party receives a gift during the marriage from a
third party that gift cannot be divided as a matrimonial asset upon divorce
unless it is the matrimonial home or has been improved by the other party or
both. The owner of the gifted asset would have to show that it originated from
the generosity of a third party in order to prevent it from being divided upon
divorce. For the time being it appears that the matrimonial partnership stops
short of extending to gifts received by either party.

[emphasis added]

22 In the present case, it was not disputed that the Husband had acquired some
shares in [LB] and [J] prior to the marriage. Similarly, it was not disputed
that the Husband’s shareholding in the two companies had changed during the
marriage. It was also not disputed that the Wife did not substantially improve
these shares. The main difficulty was whether the shares transferred during
marriage to the Husband are traceable to the original pre-marital shares
(which are prima facie not matrimonial assets). The burden of proving that the
shares in the two companies currently held by the Husband are traceable to the
original shares acquired by him prior to the marriage (such that the current
shares are to be excluded from the pool) fell on the Husband.

23 It was not disputed that the Husband’s 250,000 shares in [LB] are worth
$8,147,783. There was also no dispute that the Husband’s original shareholding
in [LB] was only in respect of 223,400 shares acquired before marriage. The
Wife’s position was that at least 26,600 new shares were acquired during the
marriage. Nevertheless, the Husband submitted that all of his current 250,000
shares should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets on the basis
that these were pre-marital gifts from his father. According to the Husband,
he did not acquire any new shares as he “never paid any consideration for
these shares” acquired between 2003 and 2007 during the marriage. They were
shares transferred from his brother’s wife and the brother’s daughter. The
Husband submitted that “notwithstanding the transfers that were carried
between 2003 and 2007, at the end of the exercise, the number of shares held
by the two brothers … always totalled to 500,000” [emphasis added]. As such,
the “transfers between the family members were always a paper exercise. There
were [sic] no increase in the number of shares. The number of shares held by
the brothers after the exercise was the same as when they were first given the
shares prior to the Husband’s marriage” [emphasis added].

24 From the foregoing, I gathered that the Husband’s case is that all of his
current 250,000 shares are pre-marital assets since the additional 26,600
shares (representing the increase from 223,400 shares prior to the marriage to
250,000 shares he currently holds) came from a collective pool of 500,000
shares in [LB] which he shared with his brother. I thought his argument is
that since all of the 500,000 shares were acquired by the Husband and his
brother prior to the marriage, all of the 500,000 shares (of which he holds
50% currently) are necessarily non-matrimonial assets.

25 On the Husband’s own evidence of the share transfer forms, I noted that the
Husband himself had acquired 175,000 shares in [LB] in 2007, during the
marriage.

26 Even if it was accepted that the total shareholding of the Husband and his
brother remained constant at 500,000 shares, I could not see how this resulted
in attributing all of the Husband’s current 250,000 shares to his original
223,400 pre-marriage shares. In attempting to avoid confronting the issue, it
was the Husband’s case that he “never paid any consideration for these shares”
and such transfers were merely “a paper exercise” due to a “tax planning
exercise”.

27 The transactions in respect of the [LB] shares are as follows:

(a) sale of 60,900 shares: from the Husband to the Husband’s brother’s
daughter on 11 April 2003;

(b) sale of 87,500 shares: from the Husband to the Wife on 11 April 2003;

(c) purchase of 29,160 shares: by the Husband from the Husband’s brother’s
wife on 15 February 2007;

(d) purchase of 29,170 shares: by the Husband from the Husband’s brother’s
other daughter on 15 February 2007;

(e) purchase of 29,170 shares: by the Husband from the Husband’s brother’s
wife on 15 February 2007; and

(f) purchase of 87,500 shares: by the Husband from the Wife on 15 February
2007.

I noted that in all of the signed share transfer forms of the transactions
listed above, the relevant parties declared that a “consideration” for
ordinary shares in [LB] of $1 per share was paid by the purchaser to the
seller.

28 As highlighted by the Wife, there were “proper share transfer forms, and
payments were made to IRAS. [She] understand[s] that this meant that parties
have represented to the authorities that these were arm-length transactions
with monies being paid for the shares. These were for all intents and purposes
shares transfers with proper consideration paid for the same”. The Wife also
cautioned that the affidavit made by the Husband’s “staff member” in respect
of the tax planning exercise was “not an expert opinion as he is not an
objective witness, and is more of a factual witness”.

29 I agreed that there was an inconsistency between the evidence submitted by
the Husband and the Husband’s submission that no consideration was paid for
the shares acquired by him in 2007. This inconsistency resulted in a
significant dilemma: either all of the respective parties to the share
transfers had falsely declared that consideration was paid in respect of the
share transfers to aid the Husband in respect of tax liabilities, or
consideration had been paid such that title and ownership passed upon the
Husband’s sales in 2003 and his purchases in 2007 respectively. In essence,
the Husband’s case that all of his current 250,000 shares are pre-marital
gifts relied on the fundamental premise that the share transfers in 2003 and
2007 were merely “paper transfers” for “tax planning” purposes (ie, pursuant
to some arrangement in avoiding or even evading some taxes which would
otherwise be liable to be paid) and nothing more. This inconsistency was of
concern – one cannot blow hot and cold – either the shares were properly
transferred with title passing, or they were not and were part of a
questionable scheme not to pay taxes.

30 The Wife submitted that 175,000 of the Husband’s shares should be included
in the pool of matrimonial assets as they were acquired during the marriage on
15 February 2007. Her position was thus that those 175,000 shares (ie, 70% of
the Husband’s shares in [LB]) are matrimonial assets. The value of such 70%
amounts to about $5,703,448. To be clear, the Wife accepted that 75,000 of the
Husband’s current 250,000 shares are not matrimonial assets.

31 Without more, as both parties were relying on the respective share transfer
forms and certificates of stamp duty, I accepted these objective documentary
evidence as reflecting what transpired. It was stated in the transfer
documents that consideration was paid. Thus, as consideration was paid to the
Husband for the sale of his original pre-marital shares in 2003, he had
divested himself of any interest in those shares. Similarly, as declared,
consideration was paid by the Husband for the purchase of some 175,000 shares
in 2007, and these were shares acquired during the marriage. I included the
175,000 shares valued at about $5,703,448 in the pool of matrimonial assets.

(C) [J] Shares

32 According to the Husband, [J] was a company set up by his father in 1972.
The Husband has been one of the directors, and had acquired 191,600 shares
prior to the marriage and currently holds 50,000 shares. The Husband
originally submitted that “no new shares were acquired during the marriage and
whatever shares the Husband holds now were clearly in existent [sic] prior to
the marriage”. It was later explained that the transactions in respect of the
[J] shares are as follows, resulting in the Husband having 50,000 shares
currently:

(a) sale of 60,014 shares: from the Husband to the Husband’s brother’s
daughter in 2003;

(b) sale of 87,500 shares: from the Husband to the Wife in 2003;

(c) purchase of 87,500 shares: from the Wife to the Husband in 2005;

(d) purchase of 29,160 shares: from the Husband’s brother’s wife to the
Husband in 2007;

(e) purchase of 29,170 shares: from the Husband’s brother’s daughter to the
Husband in 2007;

(f) purchase of 29,170 shares: by the Husband from the Husband’s brother’s
other daughter in 2007;

(g) sale of 175,000 shares: from the Husband to [B] Corporation Bhd in 2010;
and

(h) sale of 25,000 shares: from the Husband to [BB] International in 2013.

I noted that unlike the transfers of the [LB] shares, no share certificates
were provided by the Husband for the transfers of [D] shares. Through the
affidavit of one Mr Fok, an accountant employed by [LB] and [J], however, the
Husband tendered the Register of Members and Share Ledger, as well as the
Register of Transfers, which stated the dates of such transactions and how
much consideration was paid in each of the transactions. From what was stated
in these documents, the consideration paid was also $1.00 per share.

33 According to the Wife, the Husband must have acquired at least 58,400 [J]
shares (representing the difference between 250,000 shares which the Husband
held as of 31 March 2008 and the 191,600 shares held prior to the marriage).
Her position was that the “entirety of the Husband's current shareholding in
[J] is a matrimonial asset”. This was because “the Husband's pre-marital
shares in [J] Pte Ltd had all been sold and used primarily to pay for the
mortgage loan of the current matrimonial home” and the “current shareholding
of 50,000 shares is less than the 58,400 shares that were obtained by the
Husband marriage”.

34 The Wife stated, and the Husband did not dispute, that in March 2008, the
Husband had 250,000 shares in [J]. According to the Husband, he “sold part of
his shares in [J] back in 2011, and ploughed the monies into the family and
utilized the proceeds of $11.5 million towards redemption of the mortgage of
[M] Drive”. The Husband’s initial case was that he “already held 191,600
shares” and “now holds 50,000 shares in the company. … therefore no new shares
were acquired during the marriage and whatever shares the Husband holds now
were already in existent [sic] prior to the marriage”. The Husband
subsequently explained that “between 2003 and 2007, [J] similarly underwent a
tax planning exercise (similar to [LB]) and as such, the transfers of shares
were between family members and without consideration”. As such, “any
additional shares the Husband received are not shares that are newly acquired
by him but were gifts from the various family members as part of tax planning
exercise”. The Husband disagreed with the Wife that the 250,000 shares should
be considered “as the bulk of the 250,000 shares were sold off in 2010”.

35 It was not disputed that the “bulk of the 250,000 shares were sold off in
2010” (ie, 200,000 of the 250,000 shares were sold off). The disagreement was
whether the 175,000 shares purchased by the Husband in 2005 and 2007 (ie,
during the marriage) are matrimonial assets.

36 As with the [LB] shares, the difficulty here was that the Husband’s case
was inconsistent. The Husband’s case that “no new shares were acquired during
the marriage” since they were “gifts from the various family members as part
of tax planning exercise” was contradicted by the documentary evidence
tendered before this court. The Register of Transfers showed that
consideration was paid in respect of each of the transfers between the
respective parties. I also did not think that the Husband’s argument that
“between 2001 until 2010, despite the transfers between the family members,
the number of shares always totalled 500,000” helped to support his assertion
that he did not acquire any additional shares during the marriage. The
difficulties with his argument have been addressed at [25]–[26].

37 Having found that the Husband acquired 175,000 shares during the marriage
(which are hence prima facie matrimonial assets), I turned to consider whether
the Husband’s current 50,000 shares are traceable to the Husband’s original
pre-marital 191,600 shares such that they should be excluded from the pool of
matrimonial assets. I accepted that the Husband had 222,514 shares prior to
the marriage, as stated in the Husband’s later rebuttal submissions (and not
191,600 as initially submitted by him). This was supported by the Register of
Members and Share Ledger tendered in Mr Fok’s affidavit. In 2003, the Husband
sold 147,514 shares, leaving him with 75,000 pre-marital shares. In 2005 and
2007, the Husband purchased a total of 175,000 shares during the marriage.
Such shares acquired during marriage are matrimonial assets under s 112(10) of
the Women’s Charter. Given that the Husband had acquired 175,000 [J] shares
during marriage and held 50,000 [J] shares at the time of divorce, he should
prove that the latter 50,000 shares are the shares acquired prior to the
marriage and not those acquired during marriage. On the evidence and
submissions, I did not think that the Husband discharged his burden of proving
that his current 50,000 shares are traceable to his original 75,000 shares
which retained their character as pre-marital assets. Hence, I included the
Husband’s 50,000 shares in [J] valued at $5,408,937 in the pool of matrimonial
assets.

Dissipation of assets

38 The Wife submitted that the Husband has wrongfully dissipated assets. She
alleged that the following transfers were made by the Husband:

(a) to the Husband’s mistress:

(i) $262,097 representing the value of the house some time during the marriage
(which the Husband contended there was “no evidence”);

(ii) $40,323 for course fees at some time during the marriage (which the
Husband contended there was “no evidence”);

(iii) $20,161 sometime in February 2018 (which the Husband contended was a
“loan”);

(b) to the Husband’s brother-in-law:

(i) $18,000 on 3 January 2017 (which the Husband contended was a “gift”);

(ii) $18,000 on 16 January 2017 (which the Husband contended was to “pay for
brother in law’s expenses”); and

(c) $400,000 to the Husband’s former partner (the mother of [R]) (which the
Husband contended was a “gift”) on 21 October 2016.

39 The Court of Appeal in UZN v UZM [2021] 1 SLR 426 (“UZN”) at [68] explained
that where “there are indeed sums expended or given away especially nearer to
the time when divorce is imminent it may be possible to view such acts as
wrongful dissipation carried out with the intention of depleting the
matrimonial pool” and whether there is such wrongful dissipation of assets
“depends on the evidence and facts of the particular case”. Further, the court
affirmed that substantial sums expended when divorce is imminent must be
returned to the pool, referencing this as the “TNL dicta” (see UZN at
[62]–[65]).

40 As a reference point, the divorce writ was filed on 18 July 2018 by the
Wife. The previous two divorce proceedings were discontinued on 20 October
2012 and 2 January 2018 respectively. Thus, I considered the period when
divorce is imminent to be sometime after the Wife had discontinued the
previous divorce proceeding but before 18 July 2018. For context, the Wife
found the Husband in “highly compromising circumstances” on 4 June 2018 with
his mistress.

41 From the Husband’s submissions, it can be seen that the Husband only
contends that the allegations of transfers of $262,097 and $40,323 were
without evidence. The Wife, in turn, relied on certain emails in support of
her contentions. I noted that the emails are dated March to May 2018. Having
looked at the communications between the Husband and his mistress and noting
that the email conversations were dated rather far apart in time, I did not
think there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the Husband had in fact
transferred the respective amounts as alleged by the Wife. With respect to the
course fees for the Cordon Bleu cooking class, there was no reply from the
Husband indicating that he had transferred the said sum. As for the “shell and
core” house referred to by the third party, there is similarly no evidence
that the Husband transferred $262,097 to pay for this house.

42 With respect to the other transfers, which the Husband accepted that he did
in fact make, I noted that the transfers were made before divorce was imminent
and do not fall within the TNL dicta. On the evidence, I did not think that
the respective transfers were made by the Husband intentionally to deplete the
pool of matrimonial assets. It is possible that the Husband may have made the
various gifts and loan on account of his generosity to such third parties,
which is distinct from an intention to deplete the pool of matrimonial assets.

43 Thus, on the evidence, I did not find any alleged dissipation which ought
to be taken into account in this division exercise.

Submissions on the Husband’s gifts to the Wife

44 The Wife submitted that the Husband should be estopped from claiming a
share in the property at [B] Road (“Property B”) as it was a gift by the
Husband to her as part of their settlement to withdraw the divorce suit in
2012. I briefly summarised the applicable principles concerning gifts given by
one spouse to the other spouse which do not originate from a third-party gift
or inheritance (ie, “pure inter-spousal gifts”). In Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng
Guan and another appeal [2012] 4 SLR 785 (“Tan Hwee Lee”) at [30], the Court
of Appeal affirmed its decision in Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee [2012] 4 SLR
405 (“Wan Lai Cheng”) that, as a general position, “interspousal gifts of
assets which do not originate from a third-party gift or inheritance … are not
“gifts” for the purposes of s 112(10) of the [Women’s Charter], and therefore
constitute matrimonial assets for division”. However, the nature and context
of the gift could be taken into consideration when the court decides on a
“just and equitable division” between the parties (Tan Hwee Lee at [39]). The
court said (at [41]):

… In situations when it would be clearly inequitable for a donor spouse to be
awarded a substantial share in the asset constituting the inter-spousal gift
(or in the form of other assets), the court can take such a situation into
consideration under s 112(1) and award the donee spouse a greater percentage
of the overall matrimonial assets …

[emphasis in original]

45 The Court of Appeal had stated earlier in Wan Lai Cheng at [115]:

… where the donor spouse clearly intends to permanently renounce his or her
beneficial interest in the asset transferred (that is to say, when a ‘pure’
interspousal gift is intended to be a true gift), the donor spouse may be
estopped from claiming any share in that asset when the court exercises its
discretion in equitably distributing the pool of matrimonial assets.

46 However, de minimis inter-spousal gifts need not be taken into account.
This is a discretion of the court that may be exercised for practical reasons
as the courts should not be “overly burdened by petty arguments over gifts of
this nature” (see Tan Hwee Lee at [48]–[49]). What is considered de minimis
is, in turn, dependent on not only the value of the assets concerned but also
the assets’ relative value compared to the pool of matrimonial assets as a
whole. For example, in Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal
[2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“Yeo Chong Lin”) at [52], the Court of Appeal was “not
minded to disturb this exercise of discretion by the Judge” in excluding the
jewellery in that case from being taken into account “even if the jewellery
was worth something in the range of a quarter million to half a million
dollars”. The total size of the pool of matrimonial assets in that case was
about $68.9 million.

47 Bearing the principles above in mind, I considered whether in the present
case, the nature and context is such that it would be clearly inequitable for
the Husband to be awarded a substantial share in Property B, the Wife’s
jewellery, and the Wife’s 25% share of the property in China if these were
included in the pool and divided as matrimonial assets. In respect of the
Wife’s jewellery and the 25% share of the property in China, the parties
disputed whether such assets fall within the de minimis exception set out
above.

(1) Wife’s Property B

48 The Wife submitted that the “Husband should be estopped from claiming a
share in the Wife’s Property B as it was intended to be a true gift” which was
“gifted by the Husband to the Wife as part of their settlement to withdraw the
divorce suit in 2012. The Husband is a businessman and is well aware of the
effects of signing a contract/deed”. Clause 3 of the Deed of Arrangement dated
1 October 2012 (the “Deed”) in turn provided that, “the Husband shall make an
absolute gift to the Wife of his share of the property [Property B] … which is
presently owned and registered in the joint names of the Husband and Wife”.
Since the property was to “financially reward her for her efforts made towards
the family as a Wife, Mother and Step-Mother during the past 10 years of
marriage”, the Wife submitted that it was “not fair nor equitable for the
Husband to seek a division of this asset”. Relying on Tan Hwee Lee at [41],
the Wife sought a “greater percentage of the overall matrimonial assets”,
which counsel for the Wife also confirmed at the AM hearing.

49 The Husband relied on Wan Lai Cheng at [41] and Tan Hwee Lee in submitting
that Property B is liable to be divided since it is “clearly a pure inter
spousal gift”. Unlike Property R1 (which is addressed below), Property B
“falls squarely in the definition of an inter spousal gift, which is to be
included in the matrimonial asset pool, pursuant to section 112(10) of the
Women’s Charter” and there “is nothing to say that the Husband clearly
intended to permanently renounce his beneficial interest in property” pursuant
to the Deed. His position that there was no intention to permanently renounce
his interest in the property was supported by Clause 4 of the Deed, which
provided that, “[s]o long as the Husband and Wife are married, the Wife agrees
that she shall not sell, mortgage or otherwise encumber the property, without
the permission of the Husband”.

50 The Deed did not fall within s 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter as it was
made specifically in contemplation of the Wife discontinuing the divorce
proceedings in 2012 and as such was not made in contemplation of divorce.
Paragraph 4 of the Preamble made it clear that the parties “have decided to
privately resolve the issues that have been causing conflict between them, and
to discontinue the present proceedings under Divorce Suit No. 3717 of 2012/X”.
Clauses 1 and 2 of the Deed set out the context of the Deed as that the
Husband “is desirous of immediately ensuring the Wife’s financial security and
wellbeing” and affirms the Wife’s faithfulness and role as a “good mother”
throughout their marriage. It is “[t]o [that] end” that the Husband made the
“absolute gift to the Wife of his share of the property”. The Deed was hence
entered into on the Husband’s part to avoid further divorce proceedings and to
give assurance to the Wife in securing her financial security. The Husband
could perceive the property as remaining within their joint marital
partnership, in contrast with the situation in s 112(2)(e) where one would
contemplate parting with property upon divorce.

51 The present case may have some similarities with the case of Wong Ser Wan v
Ng Cheong Ling [2006] 1 SLR(R) 416 (“Wong Ser Wan”) at [69] but is also
distinguishable from it. In Wong Ser Wan, in the attempt by the husband to
save the marriage after the wife discovered his infidelity, the parties signed
a Financial Agreement (“FA”). The husband made various gifts to the wife in
accordance with the terms of the FA and the wife subsequently discovered that
the husband had not ceased his extra-marital relationship. She filed a fresh
divorce petition and obtained a decree nisi of divorce. Some assets had been
transferred to the wife under the FA before the hearing of the AM. The husband
asked that these gifts be subject to division as matrimonial assets but the
court declined to do so. Instead, the court held that “the express intention
of the husband was to transfer the assets listed in the Financial Agreement
irrevocably to the wife and to give up all his rights in the same” (at [75]).
Furthermore, during the time of negotiating and signing the Financial
Agreement, the husband was legally represented and “would have been advised as
to what the financial consequences of divorce were likely to be” (at [75]).
However, the basis of excluding these assets in the pool has since been
rejected by the Court of Appeal in Tan Hwee Lee (at [56]):

… in the light of the s 112(1) approach, we are of the view that the
"inequity" exception as set out in Wong Ser Wan should, as was the case with
the "proprietary interests" exception in Lee Leh Hua, no longer be followed.
The "inequity" exception in Wong Ser Wan is unnecessary because s 112(1)
itself already permits the court to consider the equity of allowing a donor
spouse to benefit from an inter-spousal gift when apportioning the matrimonial
assets between the parties. To illustrate the point, adding the assets in the
FA back into the pool of matrimonial assets will not lead to an injustice to
the wife in Wong Ser Wan so long as the court is prepared to give her a larger
share of the pool of matrimonial assets at the second stage via s 112(1).
Indeed, in addition to the result arrived at being in effect the same, it
might be argued that the s 112(1) approach and the exception set out in Wong
Ser Wan might well have been, in the final analysis, the same in substance. Be
that as it may, it seems to us that the s 112(1) approach is more principled
in so far as it derives its authority from the (key) provision (viz, s
112(1)). It bears noting that the entire raison d'être underlying s 112 in
general and s 112(1) in particular is to ensure a just and equitable division
of matrimonial assets utilising a broad-brush approach (see, eg, the decision
of this court in NK v NL ([41] supra) at [68]).

[emphasis in original]

52 My first observation in respect of the Property B gift in the present case
was that I did not think that the Husband went so far as to give up all his
rights in respect of the property such that in the event of a divorce, he
would have renounced his entitlement to it. On the contrary, the Deed clearly
provided, at Clause 4, that “[s]o long as the Husband and Wife are married”,
the Wife cannot encumber the property “without the permission of the Husband”.
I accepted that the Husband had no intention to renounce all of his interests
in the property. On the face of Clauses 3 and 4 of the Deed, it would seem
that the Deed ensured that the Wife had a property to reside in and hence gave
her the “financial security and wellbeing” referred to in Clause 1.

53 It is pertinent here that I explain an important aspect of the underlying
philosophy of s 112 of the Women’s Charter. Our legal regime in s 112 can be
described as the “deferred community of property” regime. The Court of Appeal
in Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“Lock Yeng Fun”)
explained (at [40]):

… matrimonial assets are not to be viewed as belonging to the husband or the
wife exclusively, to be dealt with accordingly upon a divorce. On the
contrary, the legislative mandate to the courts is to treat all matrimonial
assets as community property (or, as one writer put it, "deferred community of
property" inasmuch as the concept of community property does not take place
until the marriage is terminated legally) to be divided in accordance with s
112 of the Act…

54 Thus, during marriage, each spouse may own, and deal with assets he or she
owns, to the exclusion of the other spouse. This is also referred to as the
“separation of property” regime. During marriage, a spouse may confer a gift
to the other spouse such that the latter is free to use or dispose of that
gifted asset and enjoy that asset as his or her own. However, upon divorce,
these assets are pooled together as matrimonial assets to be divided as
community property. Indeed, when divorce is imminent, neither spouse is
allowed to expend or transfer away substantial assets, even those in his or
her own name (see TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter [2017] 1 SLR
609 (“TNL”) at [24]). This explains why the regime is described as a
“deferred” community of property regime.

55 For the reasons that I have set out, Property B was included in the pool as
a matrimonial asset. This was consistent with the approach set out in Tan Hwee
Lee. My observations above on the nature and context of the gift will be
relevant in considering whether a greater share of the total pool ought or not
to be awarded to the Wife. I address this later at [‎81].

(2) Wife’s jewellery and 25% share of the property in China

56 It was not disputed that the Wife’s jewellery and bags have a value of
$623,295. Including the Wife’s 25% share in the China property, the total
value of these assets amount to $737,357. The Wife submitted that these assets
“would not add a substantial value to the pool of matrimonial assets” and the
court should “thus exclude the same … when assessing what is a fair and
equitable division of assets”. The Husband, however, submitted that “there is
no reason to exclude these items from the pool from division” and that if the
Wife claimed the “sums are de minimis [sic] in the context of pool of
matrimonial assets, then similarly the sums which the Wife had claimed that
the Husband had wrongfully dissipated is also de minimis [sic] as well as
ought to be disregarded from calculation of the pool.”

57 As a comparison, the High Court and Court of Appeal both found that
jewellery worth “in the range of a quarter million to half a million dollars”
compared to a pool of assets worth about $68.9 million was de minimis (Yeo
Chong Lin at [52]). In this case, the disputed assets are worth $737,357 out
of a total of over $53 million. Although the relative value of the jewellery
and property in China may be described to be de minimis, I was not persuaded
that there was good reason to exercise my discretion in excluding such assets
from the pool in the circumstances of this case. It seemed to me that the Wife
sought to exclude such assets only because of their relatively small values. I
did not think that every pure inter-spousal gift (such as the Wife’s jewellery
and share of the property in China) should be excluded from the pool of
matrimonial assets solely because such assets are small in relative value. I
did not think that the value of more than $700,000 is so small and
insignificant.

58 I held that these gifts to the Wife should be included in the pool of
assets. As with Property B, I will address later (see [‎81]) whether in the
circumstances, a greater share of the total pool ought or not to be awarded to
the Wife.

The total pool of matrimonial assets and liabilities

Proportions of division

Approach: ANJ and TNL

60 In TNL, the Court of Appeal held that the structured approach in ANJ does
not apply to single-income marriages. As the present case involves a single-
income marriage, the approach in ANJ does not apply. In TNL, the Court of
Appeal observed at [48] that in long single-income marriages, the trends of
division leaned towards an equal division of matrimonial assets. This trend
does not apply to single-income marriages which are not long. TNL involved a
35-year marriage. The cases which the court in TNL referred to as relevant
precedents involved marriages of 26 years and longer.

61 The parties did not dispute that the ANJ approach is inapplicable on the
facts of this case. This is a single-income marriage as the Wife has never
worked during the marriage. The Wife submitted that a fair and equitable
division of assets is for “the matrimonial assets to be divided equally
between parties as this is a long single-income marriage where parties have
played their part”, especially since Property B is an “absolute gift that was
given to the Wife” [emphasis added]. The Husband submitted, based on BOR v BOS
[2018] SGCA 78 (“BOR”), the present case falls within the range of 15 to 18
years, which are considered to be “moderately lengthy marriages”.

Wife’s submissions on her contributions

62 According to the Wife, when the Husband “travelled extensively during the
earlier years of the marriage,” she took care of the family on her own in his
absence. The Wife had worked hard to learn the English Language so that she
could “help out with the chores and expenses” by writing cheques. She also
submitted that she had also taken meticulous care of her Husband, ensuring
that his diet consisted of food to his liking and which would improve his
health. When the parties entertained the Husband’s friends, family, and
colleagues for special occasions such as the Chinese New Year celebrations,
the Wife would “buy food, snacks and decorations for the whole house, and
instruct the domestic helpers on what to do as the mistress of the family”. In
2013, the Wife attempted IVF at the age of 41 years old to try to give the
Husband a son.

63 The Wife submitted that she was a loving and dedicated caregiver to both Q
and R. For example, the Wife cared for Q’s physical well-being, supported her
in her studies by attending teacher conferences, and accompanied her to
enrichment classes to nurture her interests in the arts. Although the Wife
could not understand much English, she would record the conferences and take
notes of the materials discussed and receive help from friends to translate
the same. As a stepmother to R, the Wife was deliberate in her interactions
with R to ensure that she would not feel left out and cared for R as if she
was her own daughter. She submitted that as such, she also similarly supported
R in her education and enrichment classes.

Husband’s submissions on his contributions

64 According to the Husband, he had played an active role in the children’s
lives. He submitted that spending more time with the family was the reason
that he went into “semi-retirement” in 2011. For example, he would enrol the
children into “good schools” and “various enrichment activities outside
school, such as painting/ballet and music lessons”. He had purchased the
children’s school materials and advised them when they had to choose their
elective subjects and co-curricular activities. When Q was unhappy at the
School of the Arts, the Husband supported her in enrolling in another school.
Working with an enrolment agency, the Husband successfully enrolled Q at [M]
University. Likewise, the Husband helped R in her university admission
process. The Husband also taught the children skills such as swimming, cycling
and canoeing, and brought them for their regular medical appointments.

65 The Husband also submitted that he contributed to the household. Since Q’s
birth, parties have always had a full-time maid to help with household chores.
The Husband submitted that he cared for the maid’s well-being and ensured that
they attended their regular medical check-ups. He also looked out for the
family’s health. For example, the Husband instructed the maids to prepare
healthy meals for the family and would purchase fruits for the family so that
they would have had fruits to eat every day. Additionally, the Husband took
charge of maintenance works at home.

Observations on the parties’ submissions on contributions

66 I noted that the Husband disagreed with the Wife’s narrative. While the
Husband accepted that the Wife did help with writing cheques, cooking some
dishes, attending some teacher conferences, the Wife only did so “on very rare
occasions” or “sometimes”. The Wife also disagreed with the Husband’s
narrative and submits that the Husband’s list of indirect contributions was an
“afterthought”. I emphasise that the court adopts a broad brush approach to
reach what is in its view a “just and equitable” division of the matrimonial
assets (s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter). Such a broad brush approach is not
based on an exacting arithmetic exercise into the parties’ day-to-day
contributions. As such, I looked at the overall contributions of the parties,
having regard to the respective roles that each party played in the marriage.
In the present case, each discharged largely their main roles in the marriage.

67 It was not disputed that the present case involves a marriage of 17 years
during which the parties have raised a child with the spouses’ roles divided
along more traditional lines. In this case, the Husband was the sole
breadwinner while the Wife was the homemaker. I noted that the Wife had
received some yields from investing moneys. The fact that the Wife had
received some yields from investing moneys did not detract from the fact that
the Wife had not worked during the marriage and this was a single-income
marriage. As clarified in UBM v UBN [2017] 4 SLR 921 at [50], the term
“Single-Income Marriage” includes “a marriage where one party is primarily the
breadwinner and the other is primarily the homemaker” [emphasis in original].

68 Putting aside the quibbles over each party’s contributions in the day-to-
day activities, it was evident from the foregoing that parties worked well
together in safeguarding the interests of the marriage and providing for their
child. It appeared to me that a party’s contributions to the wellbeing of the
family, such as the Husband’s travelling abroad for business purposes, was
mutually supported by the other party’s contributions, such as the Wife’s
caring for the children and looking after the home in Singapore. In any case,
it was not necessary for me to ascribe a specific ratio to the indirect
contributions of the parties since the ANJ approach does not apply to single-
income marriages such as the present case.

69 As a final but related note, the Wife submitted that, if the ANJ approach
was applicable, then Property B is to be recognised as the Wife’s direct
contributions. Relying on UFU v UFV [2017] SGHCF 23 at [25], she submitted
that the Wife (who owns the gifted assets) “must be treated as having made
direct contributions to the same”. Since the ANJ approach was inapplicable to
the present single-income marriage, the Wife’s submissions on this did not
affect the present case.

The applicable principles in the present case

70 In determining what is a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets
in single-income marriages, the court considers factors such as the length of
the marriage (for example, in TNL at [48]) and the size of the pool of
matrimonial assets liable to be divided (for example, in Yeo Chong Lin, which
was cited in TNL), the roles each party carried out in the marriage and
whether children were raised in the marriage.

71 The marriage in TNL was a long one of 35 years. The precedents which the
Court of Appeal considered in that case for “long marriages” was about 26
years or longer (at [48]–[51]). In such long marriages, the trends of division
leaned towards an equal division of matrimonial assets as “the law
acknowledges the equally important contributions of the homemaker to the
partnership of marriage” (Tan Hwee Lee at [85], cited in TNL at [49]). In BOR
at [113], the Court of Appeal highlighted that the trend for “moderately
lengthy marriages” of about 15–18 years was “towards awarding the homemaker
wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets” [emphasis added].

72 As stated at [70], another factor which the court considers is the
exceptionally massive pool of matrimonial assets. In VIG v VIH [2020] SGHCF 16
(“VIG”), which concerned a 12-year marriage, a total of about $36.8 million
was divided 30:70 in favour of the husband, taking into account “that the bulk
of the matrimonial assets was earned by the [h]usband’s efforts at building up
Company [X]” (at [71]). In Yeo Chong Lin, a case concerning a 49-year
marriage, a total of about $68.9 million was divided 35:65 in favour of the
husband.

73 I did not think that the present single-income marriage was a long one in
the sense contended by the Wife. This case did not share the same factual
matrix as that in TNL and the cases discussed in TNL as long marriages.
Neither was this marriage length anywhere close to that in Yeo Chong Lin.

74 The Husband, in contrast, submitted that “a fair and equitable distribution
of the assets would be 80:20 in favour of the Husband”. The Husband submitted
that neither the ANJ approach nor the TNL approach was applicable on the
facts. He invited me to follow the approach adopted in VIG, where the “husband
was largely the sole breadwinner in which most of the assets were acquired by
him as the wife only worked for a few years”. According to the Husband, the
present case was similarly a case where “the matrimonial assets were ALL
accrued by the Husband’s efforts only” and the Husband “despite his job, was
heavily involved in the children's upbringing and his indirect contributions”
[emphasis in original].

75 Several issues must be clarified. First, I did not think that the court in
VIG took an approach that was an alternative to the ANJ and TNL approaches. I
emphasise that the TNL approach is not simply to incline towards the equality
of division in all cases where single-income marriages are concerned. The
Court of Appeal in TNL at [49] expressly reiterated its observations made in
Tan Hwee Lee at [85] that:

… equality in division is not the starting point or the norm in the division
of matrimonial assets between spouses … it also remains true that the ‘courts
would nevertheless not hesitate to award half (or even more than half) of the
matrimonial assets if such a decision is justified on the facts’ … This is
especially so in long marriages where ‘the law acknowledges the equally
important contributions of the homemaker to the partnership of marriage’ …

[emphasis as added by the Court of Appeal in TNL]

It is clear that the Court of Appeal in TNL decided that what was a just and
equitable division of matrimonial assets depends on the surrounding facts of
the case and the trends of division in past cases (at [48]–[52], [54]). The
court observed that the trends in precedent cases reflected equal division in
long single-income marriages. Likewise, the court in VIG also considered the
surrounding facts of that case and trends of division in past cases (at
[70]–[71]).

76 The Husband submitted that as the “bulk of the matrimonial assets” was
earned by the working spouse (at [71]), a division of 80:20 in favour of the
Husband is just. I gathered that in essence, counsel for the Husband sought a
division of 80:20 in the Husband’s favour because he had acquired the
matrimonial assets and was present in the children’s lives. Such an argument
undermines the philosophy of marriage as an equal partnership of different
efforts. In cases of single-income marriages, it is common that all or at
least the majority of matrimonial assets will be acquired by the breadwinner.
To give a greater recognition to breadwinning and lesser recognition to
homemaking, without more, grates against the Court of Appeal’s views in NK v
NL [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (at [20] and [34], citing Lock Yeng Fun):

… The division of matrimonial assets under the Act is founded on the
prevailing ideology of marriage as an equal co-operative partnership of
efforts. The contributions of both spouses are equally recognised whether he
or she concentrates on the economics or homemaking role, as both roles must be
performed equally well if the marriage is to flourish …

…

Our examination of the case law shows that the courts might not have given
sufficient recognition to the value of factors like homemaking, parenting and
husbandry when attributing to them a financial value in the division of
matrimonial assets. This ought not to be the case …

[emphasis in original]

77 While I noted that the Husband was not absent in the children’s lives
despite his work schedule as a successful businessman, this in itself should
not devalue the Wife’s efforts and contributions in homemaking. I emphasise
that in a marriage, both spouses are expected to mutually cooperate with each
other in “safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing
for the children” [emphasis added] (s 46(1) of the Women’s Charter).

Dividing the pool of matrimonial assets

78 In my view, bearing in mind case precedents and the facts of this case, a
just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets is 30:70 in favour of
the Husband. I was mindful that what is a just and equitable division of
matrimonial assets depends on the facts of each case. In the present case
before me, of particular importance are the factors concerning the length of
the marriage (17 years in the present case), the exceptionally large pool of
matrimonial assets (amounting to $53,485,931 in the present case), and the
different roles played by the parties giving rise to various contributions as
set out at [62]–[65].

79 I found that dividing the matrimonial assets in such a proportion was in
line with the trend of cases for marriages which are moderately long and
involve exceptionally substantial pools of matrimonial assets. The case of Yeo
Chong Lin was of particular relevance. Yeo Chong Lin also involved a single
income marriage where the wife’s contributions were largely in the domestic
sphere. The marriage in Yeo Chong Lin lasted 49 years which was almost 3 times
as long as the marriage in the present case. The values of the assets there
and in the present case were exceptionally large ($68m and $53m respectively).
There were other differences from Yeo Chong Lin that I bore in mind, such as
the note that the couple in Yeo Chong Lin “were poor in the early years and
therefore the Wife’s role must have been “more arduous” then” (Yeo Chong Lin
at [73]). I was of the view that awarding the Wife in the present case of
17-year marriage a 30% share of such a massive pool of assets was just and
equitable on the facts and circumstances of this case. The share for the Wife
amounts to $16,045,779 and the share for the Husband amounts to $37,440,151.

80 In reaching this division ratio, I have adopted a broad brush approach. I
have borne in mind the fact that the Husband had made inter-spousal gifts to
the Wife and that Property R1 was partially “acquired” before the marriage. In
respect of the latter, the Husband submitted that “it would be inequitable for
the value of the property to be included in the asset pool as the property was
acquired by the Husband … solely and most of the property was already paid up
prior to marriage”. However, he conceded that payments towards the acquisition
of this property continued to be made during the marriage. Further, it was not
disputed that this property was ordinarily used or enjoyed by the family for
shelter for about 5 years. Thus, even if the property was partially paid for
prior to the marriage and also partially paid for during the marriage, its
usage would transform it into matrimonial asset by virtue of s 112(10)(a)(i)
of the Women’s Charter.

81 As I had explained at [50] above, the gift of Property B to the Wife
appeared to be an assurance of security to the Wife. It was not a transfer
made in contemplation of divorce, for it was made to support the continuance
of the marriage. The Husband did not intend to completely divest all interest
in it during the marriage, as analysed earlier. In these circumstances I was
not persuaded that the Wife ought to have a higher share of a massive pool of
assets purely due to the facts surrounding the transfer of Property B to her.
The less substantial gifts of the China property and the jewellery also do not
significantly affect the proportion awarded in an approach which is “broad
brush”. The Wife will be able to continue to keep these assets given that her
ultimate share of the total assets far exceeds the value of these gifts.

82 Ordering a division of 30% to the Wife and 70% to the Husband, the Wife
will receive assets worth $16,045,779. Property B, the China property and the
jewellery should form part of her share of assets as consequential orders. The
Husband will have $37,440,151 worth of assets. Both parties remain very
wealthy after the termination of the marriage.

83 I directed that the parties should work out all the consequential orders
necessary to carry out my division order, with liberty to apply. As the
parties were unable to agree on all the consequential orders, I heard the
parties on 12 August 2021 and made the necessary consequential orders.

Maintenance for Wife

84 By consent of the parties, I made no order on RAS 4/2020 on the date of the
hearing on 18 March 2021. The Husband has been complying with FC/ORC 972/2020
dated 19 February 2020.

85 The Wife estimated her living expenses to be $24,211 while the Husband
states that a reasonable figure is $3,938. The Wife submitted that the Husband
should pay a lump sum maintenance of about $300,000 (being the total of
$28,000 multiplied by 12, minus a slight discount) so that she “can tide over
the transition period to move out of the current matrimonial home”.

86 The Husband submitted that after the division of matrimonial assets, the
Wife “would have sufficient in her possession to maintain herself moving
forward and there will be no need for further order for maintenance for
herself”.

87 With assets worth $16,045,779, the Wife has more than sufficient to meet
her needs. There will also be financial yields on assets prudently invested
which will be incoming income for her use. There shall be no maintenance for
the Wife.

Maintenance for Q

88 The maintenance for Q was largely not contentious. It was not disputed that
the Husband has been lovingly supporting her and paying for her expenses.
Counsel for both parties at the AM hearing also confirmed that there have been
no issues in the past in respect of any failure of the Husband to sufficiently
maintain Q. As reflected in the Joint Summary, the only dispute was in respect
of the Wife’s position that the Husband should “reimburse the Wife any
expenses paid for the child within 14 days of the production of receipts”.

89 At the AM hearing, counsel for the Wife confirmed that she would like to be
reimbursed for expenses in respect of “anything”, as long as it was for the
child. I thought that the Wife’s position was far too open-ended and such an
order runs the risk of uncertainty.

90 In any case, I highlighted then and reiterate now that the Husband has
shown his love and support for his daughter in respect of maintaining her. On
the facts, the Husband is clearly not neglecting to provide for his daughter.
The current arrangement for maintenance has been working well and I see no
reason or need to make the additional order as submitted by the Wife. As such,
I declined to make an additional order that the Husband is to reimburse for
just “anything” spent on their daughter. The Wife has large financial
resources after the division orders are carried out, and she too can afford to
pay for some of her daughter’s expenses. The Husband is to continue
maintaining the child solely in respect of her reasonable expenses, such as
those listed in the Joint Summary.

Costs

91 I have made the orders on 9 June 2021 for each party to bear their own cost
for the ancillary matters, and for the Husband (appellant in RAS 4/2020) to
pay the Wife cost fixed at $1,500 for RAS 4/2020.
