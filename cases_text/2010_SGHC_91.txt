Choo Han Teck J:

1 This is an appeal by Lim Slott (“the appellant”) for a variation of access
ordered by the court below. Both parties were unrepresented and appeared in
person. Before me, the appellant applied for an order that would allow him a
total of four weeks or more of access to their daughter, now 12 years old,
during the June and December school holidays. The appellant presently has
access on Mondays and Thursdays from 6–9pm, as well as overnight access every
alternate weekend from 2pm on Saturday until 8pm on Sunday. In addition, he
has access every alternate public holiday from 9am – 6pm except on 25
December.

2 The appellant said that he is currently based in Brisbane, Australia and
would remain there until May or June 2011. He was inconsistent and incoherent
in articulating basic facts such as his employment details and was further,
uncertain as to his plans in the near future when asked. He claimed to be
practising law and still in training as a lawyer at the same time. He also
said that he was unable to find a job in Singapore and also claimed that he
has a teaching post at the Singapore Institute of Management. The respondent
informed the court that the daughter was reluctant to stay overnight with the
appellant and thus the appellant should not be allowed extended periods of
overnight access.

3 Since the appellant will not be in Singapore for most of the year, and it
was also uncertain that he will be in Singapore during the June and December
school holidays, I offered an extra day of non-overnight access to the
appellant in lieu of the four weeks of access during the school holidays.
However the appellant refused it.

4 Although I was uncomfortable with the child having any overnight access with
the appellant, I decided that the original order should remain. I therefore
dismissed the appeal.
