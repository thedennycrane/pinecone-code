**JUDGMENT:**

**Cur Adu Vult**

_

The facts

_

1\. The plaintiffs are siblings, the first plaintiff being the older brother.
The plaintiffs have another brother called Ng Chiap Chye. All three (3)
siblings are businessmen involved primarily in the business of manufacturing
and distribution of cakes and other confectionery including snacks and
desserts. At the material time, the brothers were the shareholders and
directors of a company called Changi Tropical Foods Pte Ltd (Changi) which
apparently was one (1) of the biggest and most reputable ‘nonya’ cake
manufacturers in Singapore, having been founded by the plaintiffs’ parents
back in the ‘60s before it was converted into a limited company in 1988.
Changi in turn is/was a shareholder (45%) of a company called Equatorial
Delights Pte Ltd (Equatorial); another company called Four Seasons Food
Manufacturing Pte Ltd (Four Seasons) is the only other shareholder of
Equatorial. Four Seasons had been a customer of Changi since 1970. Four
Seasons is wholly owned by Chiam Swee Hsu (Chiam) who is the plaintiffs’
stepbrother, and his wife. Chiam and his wife are also directors of Four
Seasons.

2\. The plaintiffs were also directors and shareholders of a company called
Ting Ting Snacks & Desserts Pte Ltd (Ting Ting) incorporated by the wife of
one Lim Liang Chye (Lim) and two others in July 1997; Ting Ting’s business was
similar to Changi’s and before its incorporation, it was a sole proprietorship
of Lim. Ting Ting and Equatorial were put into voluntary liquidation on 24
September 1999.

3\. The defendant is a businessman who, at the material time was the sole
proprietor of a business called Teck Shin Food Catering Services (Teck Shin)
and was also a director and majority shareholder (51%) of a company called
Teck Shin Food Manufacturers Pte Ltd (TSF); both Teck Shin and TSF were
suppliers of Ting Ting.

4\. In early 1997, the second plaintiff and Chiam met Lim in order to market
Equatorial’s products; Lim agreed to take supplies from Equatorial. Lim’s
sole-proprietorship subsequently became Ting Ting which started taking
supplies from Four Seasons but, defaulted in payment after a few months. In
early 1998, Lim offered to sell Ting Ting to Chiam and the second plaintiff;
he said the company’s operating costs were too high and it was deeply in debt;
Chiam and the second plaintiff accepted Lim’s offer.

5\. Consequently, on 17 March 1988, a sale and purchase agreement was signed
between Lim’s wife (and her co-shareholders) on the one part and Chiam and the
second plaintiff on the other. Besides taking over the debts ($1.8m) of Ting
Ting, Chiam and the second plaintiff also promised to pay Lim $550,000 for
goodwill but the payment was not spelt out in the agreement. Lim only received
partial payment of the sum; he was also to have received 10% of the issued
shares in Equatorial supposedly worth $350,000 but did not. The second
plaintiff and Chiam had arranged to pay part of the cash consideration to Lim
in instalments but they stopped the instalments after Lim resigned from Ting
Ting’s employment.

6\. Chiam jointly managed Equatorial with the second plaintiff while Chiam
managed Four Seasons and Ting Ting with Lim’s help; Lim was employed as Ting
Ting’s executive consultant. In November/December 1998, the second plaintiff
quarrelled with Chiam, essentially over the issue of management; Chiam had
succeeded the second plaintiff as the managing director of Equatorial. Because
of the resulting friction between Chiam and the second plaintiff, Lim
suggested that a new investor be brought in. Lim also informed Chiam and the
second plaintiff that because of his own financial problems, he had offered to
sell to the defendant 5% of his (Lim’s) stake in Equatorial, for $175,000. The
defendant expressed an interest but felt that 5% share was too little. He
proposed investing substantially in both Equatorial and Ting Ting instead.

7\. At a meeting in January 1999 attended by Lim, the defendant, the second
plaintiff and Chiam, it was agreed that:-

> a. the business of Ting Ting and Equatorial would be merged in order to
> reduce costs;
>
> b. the estimated worth of Equatorial made up of machinery, goodwill etc
> would be fixed at $2m;
>
> c. the defendant would purchase Lim’s (5%) share in Equatorial at the price
> of $175,000;
>
> d. the defendant would invest $500,000 in Equatorial (of which $300,000
> would be cash and $200,000 would be set–off against debts owed to his
> company) and would be given 20% share in Equatorial and Ting Ting;
>
> e. the current chairman and managing-director of Equatorial and Ting Ting
> would resign and new ones would be elected.

8\. Shortly before Chinese New Year 1999, the defendant changed his mind.
Attempts by the second plaintiff and Lim to contact him were unsuccessful. A
few weeks after Chinese New Year however, the defendant again met the second
plaintiff and indicated he would still be interested in investing in
Equatorial if Lim could reduce his price to $100,000 for his 5% stake; Lim
refused.

9\. The friction between Chiam and the second plaintiff resulted in the
plaintiffs’ placing an advertisement on Changi’s behalf in a Chinese newspaper
blaming Chiam’s mismanagement for Changi’s financial difficulties and offering
to buy over Four Season’s 55% interest in Equatorial (and Ting Ting) on terms.
Alternatively, the plaintiffs offered to sell their shares to Chiam; neither
offer was accepted by Chiam. The plaintiffs then decided to sell their shares
instead. The second plaintiff offered Changi’s 45% interest in Equatorial to
the defendant who accepted and requested the plaintiffs to prepare the
necessary resolutions to effect the sale to him. At the defendant’s request,
the plaintiffs also agreed to and did, make the defendant and his brother Ng
Kian Eng (NKE) authorised signatories to both companies’ bank accounts on 6
May 1999, before the sale was even finalised.

10\. According to the plaintiffs, at a meeting held at a coffee-shop on or
about 6 May 1999, the parties agreed on all the terms and conditions for the
defendant’s purchase of shares in Equatorial and Ting Ting. The second
plaintiff contended that the price of Equatorial shares would be based on a
valuation to be conducted by professionals at the defendant’s instruction and
expense; if the defendant was unable to revert on the value within one (1)
month of the date of signing of the sale and purchase agreement, then the
price would be $1.00 per share. Accordingly, for 1,350,000 Equatorial shares,
the price would be $1.35m and for 112,500 Ting Ting shares, the price would be
$112,500. The defendant denied any such meeting took place. However, he did
instruct valuers to conduct a valuation of the assets of Equatorial although
the plaintiffs were not informed of the results nor were they shown a copy of
the valuation report.

11\. According to the plaintiffs, a term of the sale of Ting Ting shares was
that the defendant had to pay them $50,000 immediately upon signing of the
sale and purchase agreement. As he did not have the means to pay the amount in
one lump sum, the defendant requested to which the plaintiffs agreed, to pay
the $50,000 by five (5) monthly instalments, the first instalment being
payable immediately.

12\. The defendant told the plaintiffs he would arrange for his auditor Lim
Lian Soon (LLS) to draw up the sale and purchase agreements for both
Equatorial and Ting Ting. On 8 May 1999, the draft agreements (2) were faxed
to the second plaintiff. He noted therefrom that there was no mention of the
price of the shares. When he queried the defendant, he was informed that it
was difficult to express in words the arrangements reached on 6 May 1999 and,
the parties should trust each other. On 8 May 1999, the parties signed the
sale and purchase agreements (2) at the defendant’s office in the presence of
LLS, one agreement pertained to sale of the plaintiffs’ shares in Equatorial
(the Equatorial agreement) and the other related to the sale of the
plaintiffs’ shares in Ting Ting (the Ting Ting agreement). Although the shares
in Equatorial to be sold to the defendant were held by Changi (see para 1
above), counsel for the defendant informed the court (via his submissions)
that his client no longer took issue with the fact that the plaintiffs were
not the right party to sue, as the defendant had done initially.

13\. The salient terms in the Equatorial agreement were inter alia, as
follows:

> (1). [the defendant] shall arrange and procure the discharge and release of
> the [plaintiffs] as guarantors to Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation
> (hereinafter referred to as the Bank) for an amount of up to $2,600,000 (two
> million six hundred thousand dollars and hereinafter referred to as the
> limit) in respect of a term loan and overdraft facilities granted to
> [Equatorial] and that pending the discharge and release of the said
> guarantee [the defendant] warrants that the term loan and overdraft shall at
> all times not exceed the said limit) in respect of the said term loan and
> overdraft AND THAT [the defendant] shall be liable to [the plaintiffs] for
> any amount in excess of the said limit in the event [the plaintiffs] are
> liable for beyond this limit as guarantors.
>
> (2) [the defendant] shall arrange and procure the discharge and release of
> [the plaintiffs] as guarantors to Keppel TatLee Bank Ltd (hereinafter
> referred to as the Bank) for an amount of up to $300,000 (three hundred
> thousand dollars).
>
> (3) [the plaintiffs] shall procure and irrevocably assign all debts due to
> them by [Equatorial] as at the date of this agreement to [the defendant]
> without any reservation and shall have no further claims against
> [Equatorial] and all post-dated cheques payable to them by [Equatorial]
> shall be void.
>
> (4) [the defendant] shall cause clauses (1) and (2) to be carried out
> expeditiously subject to the said respective banks’ approval and completion
> and that such failure in completion due to any one or both banks’ refusal to
> release [the plaintiffs] as guarantors for reasons beyond the [defendant’s]
> ability to procure shall not invalidate other clauses in this agreement.

There was also a restraint of trade provision against the plaintiffs which is
not relevant to the dispute at hand.

14\. The Ting Ting agreement contained clauses similar to those in the
Equatorial agreement in particular cll (1), (2) and (3) set out above save
that the defendant’s obligation related to releasing the plaintiffs as
guarantors in the sum of $300,000 to Chung Khiaw Bank (CKB) for facilities
granted to Equatorial. The Ting Ting agreement contained the following
additional clause:-

> (4) [the defendant] shall in addition to carrying out his obligations under
> clause 1 make a payment of $50,000 (fifty thousand dollars) to [the
> plaintiffs] at the end of six months after the date of this agreement or
> earlier at the sole discretion of [the defendant] subject to the completion
> and execution of the said sale and purchase agreement as stated in clause 5
> of this agreement.

15\. The plaintiffs complied with the clause relating to assignment of debts
in both agreements and executed the transfer forms relating to the shares in
Equatorial and Ting Ting. Further, on 11 May 1999, the plaintiffs appointed
the defendant and his brother Ng Kian Eng (NKE) as chairman and managing-
director respectively of Equatorial, while a close friend of the defendant one
Ang Boon Giap (Ang) was appointed a director.

16\. The defendant however failed to complete his purchase. Neither did he pay
the $50,000 by the five (5) instalments he had agreed with the plaintiffs –
instead of the first instalment being payable immediately, his cheque was
post-dated to January 2000; the plaintiffs refused to accept. When pressed by
the plaintiffs’ solicitors to complete his purchase, the defendant through his
solicitors claimed that the plaintiffs’ brother Ng Chiap Chye had objected to
the Equatorial agreement and, the necessary resolutions from Changi for
approving the Equatorial agreement had not been effected. These allegations
were refuted by the plaintiffs.

_

The pleadings

_

17\. Thereafter, these proceedings were commenced in June 1999. In the
statement of claim, the plaintiffs prayed for specific performance of both
agreements alternatively damages.

18\. The defendant raised a host of allegations in his lengthy defence.
Firstly, he contended that the consideration for the transfer of 1.35m shares
in Equatorial to him was to be a nominal $1.00; similarly for the transfer of
112,500 shares in Ting Ting. The defendant pleaded that in late 1997 Ting Ting
defaulted in its payment for supplies from TSF. He alleged that the plaintiffs
had represented to him that Ting Ting would be able to discharge its debts
($130,000) to TSF by May 1998 once Equatorial became its shareholder. Relying
on that promise, the defendant alleged he withheld taking action on TSF’s
behalf against Ting Ting but no payment was made to TSF in May 1998 and,
despite a further grace period, no payment was made by August 1998 either.

19\. The defendant further alleged that the plaintiffs and Chiam represented
to him that:-

> a. the businesses of Ting Ting and Equatorial had been merged and were
> viable;
>
> b. the goodwill, machinery and equipment of both businesses were valued at
> more than $2m as they had invested substantially in both companies;
>
> c. Ting Ting and Equatorial suffered from cash-flow problems and some
> suppliers had threatened to discontinue their supplies. The companies were
> also indebted to Central Provident Fund Board, Power Supply, Jurong Town
> Corporation and others as well as for salaries to their workers;
>
> d. if he invested $300,000 in Equatorial and Ting Ting, the defendant would
> be given 20% of the companies’ shares. The defendant accepted the offer on
> condition that the positions of chairman and managing-director of both
> companies were occupied by his nominees. However, Chiam who was then the
> chairman and managing director, refused to resign.

20\. The defendant pleaded that in April 1999, the plaintiffs made a fresh
offer to transfer to him 45% of the issued shares in Equatorial and Ting Ting
in exchange for their release as guarantors to CKB and, his injection of
$300,000 into the businesses. He averred that separately Chiam had agreed that
Four Seasons would transfer 900,000 shares it held (representing 30% of the
issued shares) in Equatorial to his brother NKE and Ang equally, in
consideration for each of them injecting $300,000 into Equatorial. Further, it
was a condition precedent to the Equatorial and Ting Ting agreements that
Chiam and his wife would each transfer 37,500 shares (representing 30%) in
Ting Ting to NKE and Ang. The defendant contended that the Equatorial and Ting
Ting agreements contained only some not all, the terms agreed between the
parties as the agreements were partly oral.

21\. The defendant further alleged that the plaintiffs, Chiam and Chiam’s wife
failed to discharge their contractual obligations and, the various
representations they made to him turned out to be false, including the fact
that both Equatorial and Ting Ting were doing well. In addition, the assets of
Equatorial had been grossly inflated – a number of machines were missing from
Equatorial’s factory or they did not work and, the company’s financial
position was far worse than that reflected in the unaudited accounts given to
him. The defendant asserted he was entitled to rescind both agreements and he
counter-claimed for the loss and damage he allegedly suffered in consequence.

_

The evidence

(i) the plaintiffs’ case

_

22\. The second plaintiff was the main witness for the plaintiffs as the first
plaintiff deposed that he left everything relating to the share transactions
to the former to handle. The second plaintiff gave his views on the
defendant’s counterclaim – he denied that Equatorial and Ting Ting were not
doing well. He contended that the monthly turnover of both companies was in
the region of $800,000. Although their business lacked professional
management, the second plaintiff argued that the companies had potential and
that was why the defendant was attracted to invest in them. He denied he and
the first plaintiff approached the defendant, it was Lim who did.

23\. The second plaintiff said he was not party to what had been agreed
between the defendant and Chiam nor was he told. In any case, whatever
arrangements the defendant had with Chiam or with Four Seasons did not concern
the plaintiffs and did not form conditions precedent to the completion of the
Equatorial or Ting Ting agreements. Neither were the arrangements with Chiam
spelt out as conditions precedent in the two agreements. The second plaintiff
denied he had induced the defendant to invest in the two companies. He further
denied Equatorial had practised false accounting and or he had withheld
material facts from the defendant.

24\. The second plaintiff said he realised subsequently that the defendant had
no intention to invest in either company – the defendant’s motive was to get
himself into the management of Equatorial and Ting Ting in order to learn the
trade secrets, siphon out funds, find out who were Equatorial’s customers and
induce staff to leave to work for companies associated with the defendant. For
these reasons and because of the defendant’s misdeeds as well as those of NKE,
the plaintiffs removed both from their positions as chairman and managing
director respectively of Equatorial, on 17 June 1999. The plaintiffs and Chiam
also changed the authorised bank signatories of Equatorial so that the
defendant could not issue cheques.

25\. Elaborating on the misdeeds, the second plaintiff alleged that the
defendant had, for the period 6 May to 17 June 1999 issued cheques totalling
$913,456 from Equatorial’s account of which $320,118.46 were made out in
favour of the defendant or to TSF. Further, it had been agreed with the
defendant that because of the company’s tight cash-flow, Equatorial would
withhold payments on old debts and pay new suppliers first. These old debts
included $700,000 owed to the second plaintiff/Changi. However, after he
joined the company, the defendant paid the old debts owed to Teck Shin and or
TSF rather then current suppliers. Further, it had been agreed that the
defendant would inject $600,000 into the company. He did pay but changed his
mind subsequently and withdrew the amount.

26\. Equatorial also suffered a spate of resignations in June 1999. The
letters of resignation were all dated 14 June 1999, contained identical
wording and were all addressed to Chiam and not to the then managing-director
NKE. The second plaintiff suspected that the resignations were instigated by
the defendant and or NKE.

27\. The second plaintiff complained that the defendant virtually destroyed
Equatorial and Ting Ting as both companies were put into provisional
liquidation in September 1999. The figures of Ting Ting for production and
sales were $519,287.04 and $385,982.84 respectively for May and June 1999.
After the defendant and his brother joined, the figures dropped to $182,631.53
and $142,346.41 respectively for August and September 1999. In addition,
United Overseas Bank on behalf of CKB set-off the sum of $300,000 pledged by
the plaintiffs (as guarantors) against the outstanding sums owed by Ting Ting,
after the company was put into provisional liquidation.

28\. The second plaintiff said the plaintiffs were still liable as guarantors
(in the sum of $16m) to Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) who are
the mortgagees of Equatorial’s factory, in the event that the sale price of
the factory when realised, is less than what Equatorial owes to OCBC. The
plaintiffs were similarly liable as guarantors for loans granted by Keppel
TatLee Bank (KTL) to Equatorial for the purchase of machinery.

29\. Cross-examined on the two sale and purchase agreements, the second
plaintiff:-

> a. agreed he was keen to procure his release as guarantor to the three (3)
> banks in question but denied that he had offered to assign the debts of
> Equatorial to the defendant because he well knew that the prospects of
> recovery were slim;
>
> b. disagreed that there was no discussion on the price of the shares and
> that was why it was omitted;
>
> c. explained that besides drafting the agreements, the defendant’s auditor
> LLS also prepared the share transfer forms (2) in which the consideration
> was also stated to be $1.00 for _all_ the shares instead of $1.00 _per_
> share. He had in fact queried LLS about the $1.00 consideration and was told
> that was the usual method to avoid ‘trouble’ which turned out to be the
> defendant’s attempt to circumvent payment of stamp duty. In June 1999, he
> was also asked to go to court to sign a statutory declaration for the
> disposal of shares in which the consideration was again stated to be $1.00;
> he did not know who had prepared the same;
>
> d. pointed out that initially the defendant was not agreeable to the
> plaintiffs’ price of $1.00 per share and wanted to pay $1.00 for all the
> shares. However, when the defendant requested the plaintiffs to assign the
> trade debts to him, the second plaintiff said he would agree only if the
> defendant paid $1.00 per share as, the debts to be assigned were worth
> $700,000 and, 45% of Equatorial based on a value of $2m would be worth
> $900,000;
>
> e. explained that the defendant not he, was in a hurry to sign the
> agreements (as the defendant was anxious to join the company);
>
> f. pointed out that he and the first plaintiff remained as guarantors for
> the loan of $2.6m extended by OCBC as OCBC did not agree to their release;
>
> g. explained that the payment of $50,000 was inserted into the Ting Ting
> agreement because it was actually meant to be a loan to Ting Ting;
>
> h. denied counsel’s suggestion that he had shown the defendant an inventory
> list (totalling $2.7m) of Equatorial to induce the latter to buy 45% of the
> company’s shares. The list was prepared for purposes of applying for a 60
> year lease from Jurong Town Corporation and he showed it to the defendant to
> let him know the value of the company;
>
> i. denied he was told that the defendant would invest in the company and
> would assume liability under the bank guarantees only if the defendant had
> majority control; in any case, he could not promise majority control of the
> company to the defendant as he and his brothers jointly held 45% shares only
> through Changi. He was unaware that the defendant was negotiating with Chiam
> to purchase 30% of the shares in Four Seasons although he knew that they
> were having discussions. If indeed that transaction was a condition
> precedent to the plaintiffs’ sale, the defendant would have put it into the
> sale and purchase agreements. Had the condition been inserted in the sale
> and purchase agreements, the plaintiffs would not have agreed.

30\. Questioned on the discrepancy between the inventory figure and a
subsequent valuation ($92,645.00) done by Jones Lang LaSalle (on the
instructions of Equatorial’s liquidators), the second plaintiff explained that
the inventory was based on the company’s investment or purchase prices which
were mainly expended in 1996\. The inventory included the cost of renovations
done to the boiler room and electrical fittings. Furthermore, some items were
custom-made and cost more but when dismantled, they had no commercial value.
In addition, Jones Lang LaSalle’s valuation was done for purposes of an
auction. He disagreed that some of the items were used equipment and others
were not in working condition.

31\. The second plaintiff elaborated on para 29(c) above. The defendant hoped
that the valuation he called for would show the shares to be worth less than
$1.00 each; the defendant said the price would be settled after the valuation
had been obtained. The plaintiffs trusted the defendant. They themselves had
previously signed similar agreements with third parties where the price of the
shares they purchased was not stated but, they abided by their gentlemen’s
agreement to pay what they had orally agreed; they believed the defendant
would do the same but he did not.

32\. The second plaintiff acknowledged that his brother Ng Chiap Chye had
opposed some of the terms of sale to the defendant. However, he had since
resolved the dispute with his brother and the latter no longer opposed the
sale to the defendant or the terms thereof.

33\. Chiam’s testimony corroborated the second plaintiff’s. Chiam is also a
director of Equatorial and a shareholder in Ting Ting. After Equatorial had
purchased a factory for $3.28m in July 1996, the equipment and business of
Changi and Four Seasons were transferred to the former. He deposed he and the
second plaintiff bought over the business of Ting Ting because they saw that
it had potential and had synergy with Equatorial’s business.

34\. Chiam revealed that it was the defendant who advised him not to accept
the plaintiffs’ advertised offer in May 1999 to buy him out saying both
companies’ monthly sales of $800,000 had potential. The defendant also said he
would later offer to buy the plaintiffs’ shares, which he confirmed to Chiam
in April 1999 he had done. However, because he had to pay a substantial sum to
the plaintiffs (which figure he did not disclose), the defendant told Chiam he
was not able to pay Chiam but, he would bring in another investor, which he
did by his close friend Ang.

35\. The terms of investment agreed between Chiam and the defendant/Ang
required the latter to each inject $300,000 into the two (2) companies in
return for which they would each be allotted 15% shares in Four Seasons. In
the defendant’s case, the shares were to be transferred to his brother NKE.
The $600,000 had to be paid within fourteen (14) days of signing of the
agreements/transfer forms. Chiam emphasised that his agreement to transfer 30%
of his Four Seasons shares was separate from and had nothing to do with the
plaintiffs’ agreement to transfer 45% Equatorial shares to the defendant nor,
was his agreement a condition precedent to the plaintiffs’ agreement with the
defendant.

36\. In view of his strained relationship with them, Chiam did not ask the
plaintiffs the amount the defendant had to pay for the plaintiffs’ shares in
Changi. By late May/early June 1999, Chiam’s relationship with Lim (who used
to be his good friend for over 30 years) had also deteriorated. Because of his
poor relationship with the plaintiffs and Lim, Chiam was receptive to the
defendant’s overtures. The defendant did not prepare any documents to evidence
his agreement with Chiam, saying it was a friendly deal and an agreement was
therefore unnecessary. He assured Chiam that once Chiam had signed the
transfer forms, the defendant would immediately inject the required $300,000
into the companies. Accordingly, on or about 8 May 1999, Chiam signed the
share transfer forms prepared by the defendant’s auditor.

37\. In May 1999, the defendant deposited $225,000 into the bank account of
Ting Ting and $50,000 into Equatorial’s account. However, from 18 May 1999
onwards, he issued cheques for substantial sums in favour of his company (TSF)
and stopped depositing funds into the companies’ accounts from 21 May 1999
onwards, despite Chiam’s protests that Ting Ting’s account was already
overdrawn (its overdraft limit with CKB was $500,000). On his part, Ang
withdrew $12,000. Chiam was powerless to stop the defendant because the
defendant, his brother and Ang were authorised bank signatories.

38\. Sometime in June 1999 Chiam discovered that his wife had omitted to co-
sign the share transfer forms (2) he had previously executed on Four Seasons’
behalf. He refused to arrange for her to do so unless an agreement was signed
to ensure that:

> a. the defendant paid the balance $300,000 to Four Seasons;

> b. the authorised bank signatories were changed such that Chiam and his wife
> had to countersign any cheques signed by the defendant, his brother or Ang.
>
> The defendant refused.

39\. In June 1999, Chiam terminated Lim’s services as Lim wanted to dismiss
several staff who were close to Chiam; this resulted in a number of staff
resigning. Chiam suspected (and understood from some of the staff) that they
had been enticed by Lim, the defendant or the defendant’s brother to leave for
better offers from a company called Ling Ling Snacks & Kuehs Pte Ltd (Ling
Ling) which had been incorporated in September 1998. The staff who resigned
included drivers, workers and order clerks as well as Lim’s wife whose monthly
salary was then $6,000 (against Lim’s salary of $3,000). As Lim did not have
the means to set up Ling Ling because of his and his wife’s then financial
difficulties, Chiam suspected that Ling Ling must have been the brainchild of
the defendant/NKE. It was strange that although the defendant was then the
chairman of Equatorial and his brother was the managing director, the letters
of resignation were all addressed to Chiam.

40\. It was then that Chiam and the second plaintiff decided to put aside
their differences to repair the damage done to the companies by the defendant.
Accordingly at a board meeting held on 17 June 1999, they removed the
defendant and his brother as chairman and managing-director respectively and
both were also removed as bank signatories. There were then two groups of
authorised signatories, one group comprising of Chiam and Ang and the other,
the defendant and his brother. Even if Chiam refused to co-sign cheques issued
by Ang, the defendant and his brother could do so. Despite their removal from
Equatorial’s management, the defendant and his brother continued to cause
damage by spreading rumours that Equatorial and Ting Ting were closing down
resulting in the companies’ having difficulties in obtaining supplies of raw
materials. The defendant also instigated suppliers to sue the companies for
outstanding debts. This action, coupled with Lim’s poaching of customers on
Ling Ling’s behalf accelerated the collapse of Equatorial and Ting Ting. Chiam
denied that suppliers lost confidence in the companies because Lim was
dismissed. He said the final straw was when a supplier/judgment creditor
executed a writ of seizure and sale on the office equipment and furniture on
22 September 1999. Chiam called for a directors’ meeting two (2) days later
and it was resolved to voluntarily liquidate both companies.

41\. Cross-examination of Chiam revealed that the cause of his strained
relationship with the second plaintiff was because the latter opposed his
attempts to control the inventory of Equatorial and Ting Ting. Although he
rejected the plaintiffs’ offer to buy him out, Chiam said he himself was
unable to buy out their 45% stake in Equatorial because of financial
constraints. Chiam echoed the second plaintiff’s denial that the defendant had
imposed as a condition for his investment that the defendant must have
majority control of Equatorial. Chiam also denied his relationship with Lim
turned sour because Lim refused to give him access to recipes of Ting Ting
without the consent of the defendant/the defendant’s brother. He blamed the
defendant for causing Lim’s attitude towards him to change. Chiam disagreed
that he refused to obtain his wife’s signature to the transfer forms because
he felt that the defendant and NKE did not treat him with respect.

42\. As for the cheques issued by the defendant, Chiam conceded that one
cheque for $50,000 at least was rightfully issued as it included repayment
($40,000) to the defendant for an advance the defendant made to the company
for payment of salaries; the balance $10,000 was taken by Lim. Chiam admitted
he had co-signed some of the cheques issued by the defendant, pointing out
that even if he had refused, the defendant could have arranged for another
authorised signatory, to sign the cheques.

43\. I need not refer to the evidence of the first plaintiff as essentially he
relied on the testimony of the second plaintiff and, repeated the denials of
the second plaintiff and Chiam that the defendant’s purchase of the
plaintiffs’ shares was conditional upon the defendant’s purchase of 30% shares
from Chiam in Four Seasons. The first plaintiff pointed out that he was in
charge of the factory and the production department while management of the
companies was handled by the second plaintiff. Due to his limited knowledge of
the affairs of the companies, cross-examination of the first plaintiff did not
elicit any useful information.

_

(ii) the defendant’s case

_

43\. In his testimony, the defendant claimed that besides his condition to the
plaintiffs that he must have majority control of both companies, he had also
informed the plaintiffs (who agreed), that all payments due to suppliers must
be paid promptly in order to avoid damage to the reputations of Equatorial and
Ting Ting. Further, meetings relating to his investment in the three companies
were held with the plaintiffs and Chiam separately because of their strained
relationship but, he made known the outcome of the meetings to the absent
party and Lim was present throughout the meetings.

44\. The defendant did not dispute Chiam’s version of the terms for the
latter’s transfer to him/his brother/Ang of 900,000 (equivalent to 30%) shares
in Four Seasons. Neither did he dispute Chiam’s testimony that in return for
those shares, the defendant or his brother and Ang would each inject $300,000
into Equatorial. Where the defendant’s version differed from the second
plaintiff’s and Chiam’s was in relation to his testimony on the alleged
assurances and representations he claimed to have received from the latter two
(2) and which induced him to enter into the agreements.

45\. According to the defendant, the first misrepresentation related to the
unaudited accounts of Equatorial. His auditor (LLS) had advised him to obtain
audited accounts of Ting Ting and Equatorial to verify their financial
position. When he asked the second plaintiff for the same, he was told the
audited accounts would not be ready for several months but that a set of the
unaudited accounts would be made available to him. When he saw the unaudited
balance sheet, the defendant noticed several discrepancies in the quantum of
director’s loans to Equatorial. When he raised the discrepancies with the
plaintiffs, they agreed that the loans they had made (together with Changi’s)
to Equatorial would be assigned to the defendant. The plaintiffs also assured
the defendant that the unaudited accounts were substantially correct.

46\. As to how the agreements (2) came to be signed, the defendant relied on
the testimony of LLS which I shall refer to later. As earlier indicated (see
para 10) the defendant denied a meeting had taken place between himself and
the plaintiffs on 6 May 1999 let alone that it was then agreed that the price
he would pay for shares in Equatorial and Ting Ting would be based on
professional valuation and failing that, the price would be $1.00 a share.
There could not have been such a term as no reference was made to it in the
agreements signed on 8 May 1999.

47\. Cross-examined on the allegations he had levelled against the plaintiffs
(including concealing one bank account with DBS from him), the defendant:-

> a. explained that although he was shown a copy of the inventory list by the
> second plaintiff, he was not given a copy until the discovery stage before
> trial;
>
> b. explained that although there was no agreement between himself and the
> second plaintiff to base the share price on valuation, he had nevertheless
> instructed Colliers Jardine to value the factory in May 1997 on the advice
> of M/s Lee Seng Chan (the company auditors for both Equatorial and Ting
> Ting) who arranged to stamp the share transfers, in which the consideration
> had been stated as $1.00. The company auditors asked for a valuation in case
> there were ‘problems’ with the Stamp Office on the nominal consideration. He
> did not receive a copy of Colliers Jardine’s (Colliers’) valuation report as
> their fees (save for $700) were not paid by Equatorial. However, his
> complaint that the plaintiffs’ inventory list was inaccurate was not based
> on Colliers’ valuation but on his own physical examination of the inventory
> in June 1999 after he joined Equatorial;
>
> c. denied the second plaintiff had called him on 8 May 1999 after receiving
> the draft agreements to inquire why the price of the shares was not stated
> in the agreements, or that he had told the former that it was difficult to
> put into writing all the arrangements reached or said the parties should
> proceed on trust;
>
> d. admitted (after initially denying) that the second plaintiff had
> indicated to him a figure of $800,000 as the debts to be assigned;
>
> e. revealed he had shown the unaudited accounts of Equatorial to LLS who had
> questioned the accuracy of the figures;
>
> f. claimed he did not prepare an agreement for his arrangement with Chiam
> because Chiam had advised it was unnecessary – instead of engaging lawyers
> to prepare an agreement, Chiam said the money saved could be used to pay
> creditors;
>
> g. claimed that the second plaintiff did not want Four Seasons’ name to
> appear in the Equatorial or Ting Ting agreements, which fact he ‘forgot’ to
> mention in his affidavit;
>
> h. testified that Chiam did not affix the common seal of Four Seasons to the
> transfer forms until pressed to do so and Chiam’s wife’s did not sign the
> forms;
>
> i. denied his whole attitude towards the plaintiffs changed after he was
> appointed chairman of Equatorial;
>
> j. contradicted the second plaintiff’s testimony and alleged it was Chiam
> who told him to hold off paying new debts when he joined the company and to
> settle old debts first (including those owed to Teck Shin/TSF);
>
> k. agreed that when the plaintiffs pressed him through their lawyers to
> complete his purchase, his lawyers did not allege there had been
> misrepresentation on the plaintiffs’ part nor did his lawyers allege that
> Chiam’s transfer of shares to him in Four Seasons was a condition precedent
> to his purchase from the plaintiffs; that was because he had no
> actual/written proof;

I should point out that this factor of lack of proof did not stop the
defendant from raising the two (2) allegations (for the first time) in his
affidavit filed on 10 August 1999 to oppose the plaintiffs’ application for
summary judgment.

48\. Re-examined by his counsel, the defendant claimed it was the plaintiffs
not he, who were in a hurry to get him to sign the agreements – they told him
they had issued many cheques but the banks would be freezing the companies’
bank accounts once they saw the audited accounts, this would result in
suppliers not getting their money and in turn they would stop supplying and,
it would spell the end of the companies. Hence the defendant’s investment and
financial assistance was urgently needed.

49\. To buttress his testimony, the defendant called three (3) other
witnesses, including Lim and his auditor (LLS); I shall start first with Lim’s
testimony. Lim who described himself as a ‘food consultant’ currently working
for Ling Ling (which he claimed had no association with the defendant)
testified that Chiam dismissed him without giving him the shares (in
Equatorial) and balance ($84,000) goodwill payment promised to him. He readily
admitted he asked 10-12 employees of Ting Ting and Equatorial to follow him
when he left although he did not assist them to draft their identical letters
of resignation. Lim confirmed the plaintiffs’ testimony that he made the
approach to the defendant after the fallout between the second plaintiff and
Chiam in November 1998; he was worried that the result would be a break-up of
the companies as, monies were owed to a number of suppliers with whom Lim was
in close contact.

50\. Although the defendant claimed Lim attended _all_ the meetings, Lim
deposed that he attended only _some_ meetings in the early stages of
negotiations between the parties; he was ‘not very sure’ when questioned
whether at a particular meeting, the defendant was told by the plaintiffs and
Chiam that Equatorial’s equipment, machines, goodwill and other assets were
worth $2m. He opined that the figure of $2m was very subjective, it had to be
agreed upon or, verified from the books of account.

51\. Lim supported the defendant’s claim that the latter’s agreement with the
plaintiffs was conditional upon Chiam’s transferring to the defendant 30%
shares in Four Seasons and upon the defendant’s gaining majority control of
Equatorial. Cross-examination of this evidence revealed that Lim’s knowledge
came from the defendant who told him sometime in early 1999. He also claimed
that the plaintiffs and Chiam were aware of this condition at an early stage
of the negotiations with the defendant when he was present. There was also a
meeting held at the office of the defendant’s auditor LLS where the number of
shares to be sold were discussed.

52\. Lim explained he was allotted 10% stake in Equatorial which shares were
not registered in his name. He asked for permission to sell 5% of that stake
(150,000) to the defendant. Although Chiam refused to consent, Lim pointed out
that as the shares belonged to him, he could sell them to whosoever he
pleased. As Chiam said he had no funds to buy him out, Lim decided to offer
his shares to the defendant. In fact, Lim (with the plaintiffs) also
approached National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) at one stage when the
defendant did not revert on Lim’s offer. However, when the defendant indicated
he would buy Lim’s shares, the plaintiffs and Lim called off further
negotiations with NTUC. This was then followed by a proposal from the
defendant to take a bigger stake in the companies. The defendant also asked
Lim on the performance of the companies; Lim indicated it was healthy, cash
flow on paper was okay, future prospects ‘were definitely bright’ and ‘it was
a good buy’ after he had checked the profit and loss accounts, as prepared by
the accounts clerk, which figures were 90% accurate. In reality Lim testified,
the company had a tight cash flow due mainly to the fact that a number of
customers (most of whom were handled by Chiam’s wife) did not pay their
outstanding accounts.

53\. LLS confirmed he is/was the auditor of both Teck Shin and TSF and had
recently been appointed auditor of Ling Ling as well. He was first apprised of
the defendant’s proposed investment in April 1999 when the defendant sought
his advice. LLS was told that Teck Shin sold products to Equatorial and Ting
Ting both of which were indebted to Teck Shin for about $200,000. The
defendant wanted to buy into the two (2) companies with a view to possibly
rehabilitating them; if the defendant succeeded, he would be able to recover
Teck Shin’s debt. LLS advised the defendant to look at the companies’ audited
accounts to determine the extent of their assets and liabilities.

54\. According to LLS, he was told by the defendant that audited accounts were
not available whereupon LLS cautioned the defendant and advised that he should
ask to look at the assets and liabilities. LLS pointed out that if a company
could not get its accounts out after a long delay, it meant that the accounts
were messy or, the management had something to hide. The defendant said he
would check with the plaintiffs and Chiam. Despite his warning, LLS said the
defendant was still interested to purchase the plaintiffs’ shares.

55\. LLS testified that at one of the meetings held at his office where the
defendant was present, the plaintiffs told him that 1,350,000 shares in
Equatorial and 112,500 shares in Ting Ting would be transferred to the
defendant for only $1.00 consideration because, the actual consideration would
be the release of the plaintiffs from their personal guarantees given to OCBC,
KTL and CKB totalling $3.2m and payment to them of $50,000 in 6 months’ time.
He recalled that the second plaintiff did most of the talking at meetings,
some of which he did not attend but, the defendant would report on their
outcome to him or, he would be informed at subsequent meetings at his office
at which the plaintiffs were present.

56\. LLS testified that for the sale from Chiam to the defendant, he was told
there was no need for an agreement to be prepared as (according to the
defendant) Chiam was anxious to complete the deal. Neither was he told to
include Chiam as a party to the Equatorial and Ting Ting agreements. As for
those agreements, LLS said the plaintiffs requested for and amendments were
made to, the bank guarantee clause. He had asked the defendant the amount of
debts to be assigned by the plaintiffs but he could not recall whether the
figure told to him was $700,000. He was unable to ascertain and therefore to
insert, a figure for the assigned debts since no audited accounts were shown
to him.

57\. LLS said it was ‘obvious’ to him and to other reasonable person that the
defendant and the plaintiffs intended to treat the transfer of 45% of shares
in Equatorial and Ting Ting from the plaintiffs and 30% shares in Four Seasons
from Chiam ‘as one entire deal’. If any portion of the deal failed to
materialise, then the whole deal would be aborted as the costs involved
totalled $4m. To support his argument, LLS put forward these figures
presumably to show the extent of the defendant’s outlay:

> $2.6m – OCBC plus $300,000 – KTL plus $300,000 – CKB plus $800,000
> –creditors’ claim plus $50,000 payment to the plaintiffs.

Unfortunately, apart from making that statement, LLS was not asked to
elaborate on his figures nor was he cross-examined on the same. One is left to
surmise that his starting figure of $2.6m came from the OCBC guarantee
referred to in clause 1 of the Equatorial agreement (set out in para 13 above)
to which he added the $300,000 cash which the defendant, NKE and Ang were each
supposed to inject into all three (3) companies.

58\. Finally, there is the evidence of the valuer Lui Fook Kee (Lui) who
testified that on the defendant’s instructions (supposedly as chairman of
Equatorial) he carried out the valuation in early August 1999 at Equatorial’s
factory, on a ‘fair market value basis’. I should point out that the
defendant’s testimony that Colliers had done a valuation in May 1999 was not
substantiated by any document; Lui is not from Colliers but from the firm of
Machinery Valuers & Consultants. As very little turns on Lui’s testimony, I
shall not dwell on it save to say that he testified the whole valuation
process took him two (2) days including the taking of photographs, before he
arrived at a figure of $432,000. Lui was told that the equipment and machinery
were for food production but not specifically for the making of ‘nonya kueh’;
he was not shown Equatorial’s inventory list. However he knew that a number
(10) of items were custom-made which factor he took into account in his
valuation (albeit not stated); because that would result in a lesser demand,
it warranted a lower value. Lui explained that his valuation did not take into
account the value of Equatorial’s commercial vehicles because he did not have
the opportunity to inspect them; neither did it take into account the cost of
renovations and fittings as the valuation was for disposal purposes.

_

The decision

_

59\. The crux of the defendant’s case, according to the convoluted defence
filed for him was, he was entitled to rescind the two (2) agreements because
of the plaintiffs’ misrepresentations and, the contracts were conditional upon
his securing 30% shares in Four Seasons from Chiam/Chiam’s wife which he did
not. I propose to first address the numerous other allegations the defendant
raised in his defence before returning to this main issue.

60\. Among the many peripheral allegations raised by either the defendant’s
solicitors before commencement of proceedings or in his defence were the
following:-

> (a) that the plaintiffs’ brother Ng Chiap Chye objected to the sale of
> Changi’s shares to him:
>
> (b) that Chiam had refused to resign as chairman and managing director of
> Equatorial and Ting Ting respectively;
>
> (c) that the necessary resolutions to effect the transfer of shares to him
> were not passed;
>
> (d) that Chiam and Chiam’s wife failed to execute the transfer forms for
> Four Seasons.

On the evidence, I find that the above allegations were either not
substantiated or were rebutted; some elaboration is called for. On item (a),
the second plaintiff had testified that after Ng Chiap Chye had voiced his
objections to the sale to the defendant in his solicitors’ letter dated 24 May
1999, the latter changed his mind subsequently, prior to commencement of these
proceedings. It should also be noted that Ng Chiap Chye’s objections were
raised _after_ Changi had passed the requisite board resolution (on 18 May
1999) to sell its 45% stake in Equatorial to the defendant, with his consent.
Item (b) is clearly untrue since Chiam did step down as chairman and managing
director and was replaced by the defendant and NKE. Similarly, item (c) is
untrue as I note that exhibit NCB-10 (p 81) in the second plaintiff’s
affidavit shows a fax transmission dated 16 June 1999 from the company
secretary (Allied Corporate Services Pte Ltd) to the defendant requesting
payment for their services in effecting the transfer of 1.35m shares in
Equatorial to him. It is also common ground that Chiam did execute the
transfer forms and also affixed the common seal of Four Seasons thereon. What
he did not do was to obtain his wife’s signature (which earlier omission was
inadvertent) because he wanted the defendant to keep to his side of the
bargain first – inject $300,000 into Four Seasons. There was no indication
from Chiam that his wife had refused or would refuse, to sign the transfer
forms once the defendant had complied with his request. In any event it is my
view that Chiam’s agreement with the defendant has nothing to do with the
plaintiffs (see para 63 below).

61\. On the main issue, I had earlier pointed out (para 47) that the
defendant’s allegation of misrepresentation first surfaced in his O 14
affidavit (see para 59 of that affidavit). Prior to commencement of this
action (on 28 June 1999), the plaintiffs and their solicitors had written to
the defendant to demand that he comply with the terms of the agreements since
the plaintiffs had discharged their obligations In responding to those
demands, the defendant at no time complained that the plaintiffs had
misrepresented to him. On the contrary, his stand (as reflected in his
solicitors’ letter dated 4 June 1999 to the plaintiffs’ solicitors) was, that
he was not prepared to invest further funds because he required _‘sight of
satisfactory evidence that [the plaintiffs] are ready willing and able to
proceed with the sale and purchase of shares in view of objections raised_[_by
Ng Chiap Chye_]. I have no hesitation in finding that the plea of
misrepresentation was an afterthought and a ploy used by the defendant to
renege on his obligations; it is clearly unmeritorious and a fabrication;
accordingly I dismiss it. I should add that I did not find the defendant a
credible witness; I disbelieve his denial no meeting was held at all on 6 May
1999 let alone at a coffee-shop.

62\. Even if there is any truth in the defendant’s complaint of
misrepresentation, it could not have influenced the defendant let alone
induced him to enter into the agreements. This is apparent from the testimony
of LLS who said he cautioned the defendant against accepting the unaudited
accounts of Equatorial despite which, the defendant chose to go ahead with his
investment. One should also bear in mind that by his own testimony, he was
shown but not given, a copy of Equatorial’s inventory list until the trial;
how could he then have been influenced by the list? The defendant must
therefore bear the consequence of the risk he took. Further as part of the
‘due diligence’ he conducted, the defendant sought Lim’s views on the
performance of Equatorial and Ting Ting and the latter painted a rosy picture.
If the defendant chose to rely on Lim’s representations to his detriment, his
recourse if any is against Lim, not the plaintiffs.

63\. Next, I turn to the issue of condition precedent. The defendant had
pleaded that the agreements reached with the plaintiffs were partly oral and
partly in writing. No evidence was adduced by him on the oral aspects of the
agreements apart from his allegation that he had told the plaintiffs his
agreements with them were conditional upon his reaching agreement with
Chiam/Chiam’s wife and the undisputed testimony that the defendant or his
nominees had to inject $300,000 into each of the two companies. Again, this
defence did not surface in the correspondence from the defendant’s solicitors
to the plaintiffs’ solicitors before trial. What is more significant is the
fact that the defendant could have easily instructed his auditor LLS to
include such a condition in either the Equatorial or Ting Ting agreements but
he did not, notwithstanding its importance to him. He did not give any let
alone, a satisfactory explanation for the omission. As the second plaintiff
and Chiam both denied there was such a condition precedent and the defendant’s
only corroborative evidence was pure hearsay (Lim said the defendant told him
there was such a condition), I again reject this defence as wholly without
merit.

64\. There is one other important issue which I need to address before I give
my decision. What was the price for the shares to be transferred to the
defendant? Was it $1.00 for 1.35m Equatorial shares and $1.00 for 112,500 Ting
Ting shares (as asserted by the defendant) or, $1.00 per share as the
plaintiffs contended? In this regard, I need to revert to the figures LLS put
forward to support the defendant’s stand, set out in para 57 above.

65\. I do not accept LLS’ figures because the reasoning is flawed as can be
seen shortly. Clause 1 of the Equatorial agreement required the defendant to
procure the plaintiffs’ discharge from their personal guarantees to OCBC for
an amount up to $2.6m; clause 2 contained a similar obligation as regards the
plaintiffs’ personal guarantee to KTL in the sum of $300,000. Both clauses
_did not_ require the defendant to come up with cash of $2.6m or $300,000. As
no evidence was tendered by the defendant to show that the two (2) banks
refused his request to discharge the plaintiffs from their personal
guarantees, the conclusion must be that he did not perform either clauses 1 or
2 as the plaintiffs alleged. The plaintiffs remained liable to OCBC, according
to the letter of demand from the said bank’s solicitors dated 13 October 1999,
where the sum outstanding and demanded was said to be $2,623,048.40 under the
guarantee. Consequently, $2.9m should be removed from the equation of LLS.
Under the Ting Ting agreement, the defendant was required to procure the
plaintiffs’ discharge from the personal guarantee they furnished to CKB in the
sum of $300,000. The defendant did not, as can be seen from the letter dated 5
October 1999 to the Receiver of Ting Ting from United Overseas Bank (on behalf
of CKB) stating that it would set-off the outstanding sum of $500,000 against
the fixed deposit(s) inter alia of the second plaintiff and against the monies
in the current account of the first plaintiff. The figure $300,000 for CKB
should similarly be removed from LLS’ equation for the same reason.

66\. Once that is done, what remained of the defendant’s obligation was to pay
$50,000 to the plaintiffs (under the Ting Ting agreement) which he failed to
do, according to the second plaintiff and which the defendant did not deny.
Under the Equatorial agreement, no monies were payable by the defendant at all
in addition to which the plaintiffs were required to assign to him (and which
they did) all debts owed to them by Equatorial. According to a letter (dated 1
November 1999) he wrote to the company’s Receiver which the second plaintiff
tendered to court, Equatorial owed him $164,818, $92,000 to the first
plaintiff and $275,000 to Changi, totalling $531,818.

67\. The net result of the defendant’s investment (according to his version)
was, he would receive 1.35m and 112,500 shares in Equatorial and Ting Ting
respectively and would be assigned debts worth at least $500,000 in exchange
for his payment of $2.00 (plus $50,000). Further, through his 45% shares, he
would have an interest in the assets of Equatorial including its factory. Even
if one were to discount the figure ($2.7m) in Equatorial’s inventory list
which I would emphasise is an inventory value and not a valuation, Lui’s
valuation in August 1999 showed the factory’s assets were worth $432,000,
still a substantial sum.

68\. According to the second plaintiff, the defendant deposited $275,000 into
the bank accounts of Equatorial and Ting Ting. The defendant on his part said
he (or his brother) and Ang invested $300,000 in the companies. However, what
the defendant omitted to mention was, after he or his brother and Ang had
deposited the monies, the defendant made withdrawals totalling $310,118.46
over a six (6) week interval from those accounts (see exhibit NCB-11 of the
second plaintiff’s affidavit) either to pay himself or his own businesses (TSF
and Teck Shin). In this regard I totally reject the defendant’s incredible
claim that he was told by Chiam to settle old debts first. Assuming one
accepts that the defendant with Ang did inject $300,000 into the two
companies, the defendant’s investment was free added to which he benefited by
at least $10,118.46 ($310,118.46- $300,000 = $10,118.46). No evidence was
adduced that he paid $2.00 (for the shares in Equatorial and Ting Ting to be
transferred to him) nor the $50,000 due to the plaintiffs after they rejected
his post-dated cheques. I have excluded from the $310,118.46 Ang’s withdrawal
of $12,000 even though Ang was in the defendant’s ‘camp’. Otherwise the
$10,118.46 would be increased to $22,118.46. The defendant had secured for
himself a very good bargain indeed. I find there is more than a grain of truth
in the plaintiffs’ complaint that he had an ulterior motive behind his
purported investment. It is telling that neither Teck Shin nor TSF were listed
in the list of unsecured creditors of Equatorial after the company went into
provisional liquidation. Yet in his evidence in chief, the defendant had the
gall to complain that he had suffered loss and damage by spending five (5)
weeks in the office/factory of Equatorial to solve the day to day problems and
having to pay ($2,500) for Lui’s valuation report!

69\. The defendant’s benefits outlined above are to be contrasted with the
consequences which resulted from the plaintiffs’ compliance with their
obligations under the two (2) agreements:-

> a. they allowed the defendant, his brother and Ang to become authorised
> signatories of cheques before the agreements were signed, causing them
> personal detriment and the companies’ cash-flow to worsen;
>
> b. they appointed the defendant and his brother chairman and managing
> director respectively;
>
> c. they assigned to the defendant the debts owed to them personally by
> Equatorial;
>
> d. they accepted a restraint of trade provision;
>
> e. CKB forfeited their fixed deposits and other monies to set-off Ting
> Ting’s outstanding overdraft of $500,000; OCBC has a pending action against
> them as guarantors for the outstanding sums owed on facilities granted to
> Equatorial;
>
> f. both companies are now in receivership.

70\. Something must now be said on the applicable law. Both parties prayed for
equitable relief in their pleadings – specific performance by the plaintiffs
and rescission by the defendant. Although neither counsel addressed me on this
mode of relief in their closing submissions, there are certain maxims which
need to be borne in mind when litigants apply for equitable relief. One of
these oft-quoted maxims is, he who comes to equity must approach the court
with clean hands. Put in another way, it means no court of equity will aid a
man to derive advantage from his own wrong. Another maxim is, he who seeks
equity must do equity. Applying those maxims to this case, it is my view that
the defendant’s conduct precludes him from being granted any equitable or
other reliefs. His conduct is to be contrasted with that of the plaintiffs who
are in their present unenviable predicament because of their naivete and trust
in him.

71\. One other point I need to address before giving my decision touches on
the submission made by the parties on the parol evidence rule set out in s 94
of the Evidence Act Cap 97 (the Act). Counsel for the defendant relied on the
section to submit that the plaintiffs were precluded from adducing any
testimony that the defendant had agreed to pay $1.00 per share, as it was not
stated in and contradicted, the two (2) agreements. To reinforce his
contention that the plaintiffs had fabricated (as an afterthought) their
testimony that the agreed price for the shares was $1.00 each, counsel
referred to the statutory declaration sworn by the second plaintiff for
purposes of stamping the transfer deeds as well as the transfer deeds. On the
other hand, counsel for the plaintiffs relied on proviso (b) of the same
section for his opposing submission. Section 94 of the Act states:

> When the terms of any such contract, grant or other disposition of property
> or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have
> been proved according to section 93, no evidence of any oral agreement or
> statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument or
> their representatives in interest for the purpose of contradicting, varying,
> adding to or subtracting from its terms subject to the following provisions:
>

>> (a) any fact may be proved which would invalidate any document or which
would entitle any person to any decree or order relating thereto; such as
fraud, intimidation, illegality, want of due execution, want of capacity in
any contracting party, the fact that it is wrongly dated, want or failure of
consideration, or mistake in fact or law;

>>

>> (b) the existence of any separate oral agreement, as to any matter on which
a document is silent and which is not inconsistent with its terms, may be
proved; in considering whether or not this proviso applies, the court shall
have regard to the degree of formality of the document;

>>

>> (c) the existence of any separate oral agreement constituting a condition
precedent to the attaching of any obligation under any such contract, grant or
disposition of property, may be proved….

72\. While it is true that the plaintiffs cannot adduce any oral testimony to
contradict the two (2) agreements, exceptions are provided by provisos (b) and
(c) to section 94 as set out above. In this regard it bears mentioning that
although it was not stated in either agreement, it was common ground that the
defendant (or his nominee) was to inject $300,000 into the two companies. That
undisputed term although oral, formed part of the agreement between the
parties; it did not contradict any term in the agreements. I am mindful that
the defendant would argue that if this oral term is accepted, then similarly
the court should also accept the defendant’s testimony that there was an oral
condition precedent to the two (2 ) agreements, on his requirement for
majority control for Equatorial and that Chiam must also sell Four Seasons’
stake to him. My rejection of this alleged oral term was not because of
section 94 of the Act but because I disbelieved that it existed.

73\. Consequently, the price of the shares not having been stated _at all_ in
the two (2) agreements, the plaintiffs are not precluded from testifying that
the defendant had orally agreed it would be $1.00 per share. This finding is
consistent with the defendant’s own testimony that he called for a valuation
from Colliers subsequently (although the valuation report was not produced).
Why would the defendant do that unless it was pursuant to his agreement with
the plaintiffs to pay $1.00 per share? Further, why would Lim ask for $175,000
from the defendant for his 5% stake in Equatorial if the shares really had no
value and refuse to reduce the asking price to $100,000? Finally the
agreements (2) and the statutory declaration were all prepared on the
defendant’s instructions, the plaintiffs were not the maker.

74\. I therefore find that there was an oral agreement between the parties
that defendant would pay the plaintiffs $1.00 per share or a total
consideration of $1.35m for shares in Equatorial and $112,500 for shares in
Ting Ting. Accordingly, I find for the plaintiffs on their claim. However, as
both Equatorial and Ting Ting are in provisional liquidation, I will not order
specific performance of the agreements but award interlocutory judgment to the
plaintiffs and costs with damages to be assessed by the Registrar; the costs
of such assessment are reserved to the Registrar. In assessing the damages,
the Registrar should take into consideration the cash injected by the
defendant or NKE and Ang into Equatorial and Ting Ting which should however be
set-off against the withdrawals which the defendant subsequently effected to
pay the debts owed to Teck Shin and or TSF. Correspondingly, I dismiss the
defendant’s counterclaim with costs.
