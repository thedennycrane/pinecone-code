Lee Seiu Kin J:

1 There are nine defendants in this suit. On 3 November 2014 I allowed most of
the plaintiff’s claims against the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and
ninth defendants. I dismissed the plaintiff’s claims against the sixth,
seventh and eighth defendants. On 6 March 2015, after hearing counsel for the
parties, I awarded joint costs to the seventh and eighth defendants in the sum
of $270,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed between the parties.
The plaintiff applied for further arguments. On 7 September 2015, I heard the
further arguments but declined to alter my original costs order. The plaintiff
has appealed and I now give my grounds of decision.

2 I adopt below the plaintiff’s description of the scope of the trial, found
in para 39 of the “Plaintiff’s Costs Submissions”:

The trial took a total of 49 days. There were a total of 35 factual witnesses,
including subpoenaed witnesses … and 2 expert witnesses … The Bundle of
Affidavits … comprised 12 volumes. …

3 The plaintiff’s case against the seventh and eighth defendants was, firstly,
for breach of confidence in relation to information obtained by them from the
plaintiff. The plaintiff also alleged that the seventh and eighth defendants
had conspired with the first defendant to steal confidential information from
the plaintiff for use by the fifth defendant and a further conspiracy to sell
machines to the fifth defendant that contained the plaintiff’s confidential
information. These claims against the seventh and eighth defendants were so
intertwined with the plaintiff’s claims against the remaining defendants that
their counsel, Mr Chan and his assistant, Mr Pang, were required to be present
in court for most of the trial. Indeed, they were present in court for 32
days.

4 Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Lok, submitted that counsel need not have
attended in court for all 32 days. However I did not see how any responsible
counsel could have done this given the issues in the trial and the nature of
the claims against the seventh and eighth defendants. I found that the
attendance of Mr Chan and Mr Pang in 32 out of the 49 days to be eminently
reasonable in the circumstances.

5 Therefore what remained to be determined was the costs that a court would
award for attendance of counsel in a trial in the High Court for 32 days. This
sum would include the pre-trial work. Counsel tendered to me precedents of
costs awarded in similar cases. These ranged from $16,000 to $25,000 per day
of trial. I took into account the fact that the low end of the range would be
appropriate for a longer trial. I also took into account the fact that the
seventh and eighth defendants were not the main defendants in this suit.
Taking all relevant factors into account, I was of the view that an
appropriate order of costs would be $270,000, an average of about $8,500 per
day.
