**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_

The parties

_

1\. The plaintiff is a bank. The first defendant was a customer of the
plaintiff with credit facilities in the form of a revolving credit facility
and an overdraft facility. The second defendant was the guarantor for the
facilities.

_

The action

_

2\. The plaintiff claimed against the second defendant as guarantor sums due
under the facilities. The plaintiff obtained summary judgment in the first
instance that the second defendant was to pay it

> 1\. the aggregate of the sums of US$3,102,254.71 and S$1,990,311.67;
>
> 2\. interest on the sums of US$3,102,254.71 and S$1,990,311.67 at the rates
> of 3.5% p.a. above the Plaintiff’s prevailing US$ Cost of Funds and 5% p.a.
> above the Plaintiff’s S$ Prime Rate respectively from 1 December 2000 to
> judgment.

3\. The second defendant appealed to a judge in chambers and succeeded to the
extent that it was ordered on 29 June that the judgment sums were reduced to
US$3,100,937.72 and S$1,957,756.05 with interest thereon as previously
ordered.

4\. The second defendant appealed further to the Court of Appeal. The appeal
was allowed in part when the Court ordered that interlocutory judgment be
entered against the second defendant for principal and simple interest to be
assessed by the Registrar, and that unconditional leave be given to the second
defendant to defend the plaintiff’s claims for compound interest and default
interest.

5\. The matter then went before an Assistant Registrar for the assessment of
the sums payable. On 19 April 2002 after hearing witnesses and counsel the
Assistant Registrar ordered that

> 1\. Final judgment for the Plaintiff against the 2nd Defendant as follows:
>

>> a. in relation to the revolving credit facility for the principal sum
assessed at US$2,935,250.24. for simple interest from 9 May 2000 to 30
November 2000 assessed at US$115,518.31 and for further simple interest on the
sum of US$2,935,250.24 at 6% per annum from 1 December 2000 to date of
judgment; and

>>

>> b. in relation to the overdraft facility for the principal sum assessed at
S$1,609,688.51, for simple interest from 7 November 1995 to 30 November 2000
assessed at S$256,866.81 and for further simple interest on the sum of
S$1,609,688.51 at 6% per annum from 1 December 2000 to date of judgment;

>
> 2\. Nothing in this order shall preclude the Plaintiff from expressly
> claiming as against the 2nd Defendant any charges or commission or expenses,
> howsoever described, after amending its Statement of claim to identify such
> sums as may be claimed, or to apply for summary judgment on such claims;
>
> 3\. Nothing in this order shall preclude the Plaintiff from pursuing the
> claims that have not been allowed in this assessment at the trial of the
> action.

6\. The second defendant was dissatisfied with the order and brought the
present appeal before me.

_

The appeal

_

7\. There were two matters under appeal. The first related to a 1.5% spread in
the revolving credit facility. Counsel for the second defendant argued that
"(i)n the computation furnished by the Plaintiffs’ lawyers in respect of the
Revolving Credit Facility … the Plaintiffs had charged "All-in interest rates"
at Cost of Funds ("COF") plus 1.5% spread …" and that "(i)t is to be noted
that the Facility Letter makes no reference whatsoever to the Spread of 1.5%.
All that the Plaintiffs can show in support of their claim are _the letters
from the Borrower who had agreed to an "aggregate" rate of interest_ or the
total sum of interest for the period from 9 May 2000 to 2 August 2000."
(Emphasis added)

8\. Counsel contended that the spread should not be permitted because

> (1) there is no specific agreement by Borrowers for Spread; and
>
> (2) the Second Order which sets out the parameters for the assessment makes
> no reference to this Spread of 1.5%;
>
> (3) notwithstanding the fact that the Borrower has agreed to pay an
> aggregate rate of interest, the Court has excluded default interest, from
> the computation. Similarly the 1.5% Spread should be removed as it is not
> simple interest.

9\. The second matter under appeal is order 3 of 19 April 2002. The second
defendant’s grievance was that "(a)lthough the [order] may appear to accord
with approach of the Assistant Registrar that he proceeded with the assessment
on the basis that it is a Order 14 hearing, nevertheless there is a
significant difference. In the assessment witnesses were called gave evidence
and cross-examined under oath. In the premises there is no reason for the
Plaintiffs to have a second bite at the trial to claim for COF."

_

The entitlement to the spread

_

10\. The 1.5% spread arose in the interest charged in the revolving credit
facility. The plaintiff charged interest based on the cost of funds plus 1.5%.

11\. The second defendant was correct in its contention that there was no
reference to the spread in the facility letter offering the facilities. The
facility letter had provided that "Advances for periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months
at your option on a rollover basis at mutually agreed rates to be determined
on the date of drawdown, subject to availability of funds."

12\. However it was not the plaintiff’s case that the spread was specifically
referred to and agreed upon. Its case was that the spread was a component of
the interest charged. This was explained by its solicitors to the second
defendant’s solicitors on 25 March 2002 that "the spread of 1.5% per annum
that was charged was part of what was agreed with the borrower and was rightly
charged to and paid by the borrower." This was also reflected in the
plaintiff’s Statement of Principal and Simple Interest, which referred to the
"All-in interest at COF + 1.5%." Furthermore the plaintiff’s Head of Corporate
Banking deposed in an affidavit that the all-in interest rates charged by the
plaintiff were agreed to by the first defendant. Letters evidencing the
borrower’s confirmation of the rates for the period for which interest on the
all-in interest rates was awarded were exhibited thereto.

13\. On the evidence, it was clear that the interest rates were agreed to. It
was not open to the borrower or the guarantor to object to them now, whether
in full or to any component thereof. There is no merit in the second
defendant’s argument that the 1.5% spread should be removed from the agreed
interest rates.

_

The right to proceed with the claim for cost of funds

_

14\. The order under appeal was in broad terms with no reference to the cost
of funds -

> Nothing in this order shall preclude the Plaintiff from pursuing the claims
> that have not been allowed in this assessment at the trial of the action.

15\. The Assistant Registrar was directed by the Court of Appeal to assess the
principal sums and simple interest owing and payable by the second defendant.
It really did not need saying that his assessment of those two sums cannot
affect any other claims the plaintiff may have. The assessment was
consequential to a summary judgment obtained by the plaintiff. A summary
judgment does not shut out any part of a plaintiff’s claims; what it does is
to obviate trials of those claims for which judgments are given. Any other
claim that the plaintiff wishes to pursue shall go for trial, and its success
or failure will be determined there.

16\. The Assistant Registrar was stating the obvious. The only matters that
had been conclusively determined were the principal sums owing and the simple
interest accruing on them. The plaintiff having made its claim for costs of
funds as an element of the interest it charged is not allowed to revisit this
at the trial. There was no indication of any further claims for cost of funds.
To the contrary, counsel for the plaintiff confirmed in the appeal before me
that the plaintiff will not claim for cost of funds at the trial.

17\. On the basis of the foregoing, the second defendant’s appeal was
dismissed. The Court of Appeal will rule on these issues when it hears the
second defendant’s appeal against my decision.
