Kan Ting Chiu J:

1 Tan Tye, a trader and timber merchant, died on 22 July 1898. He left a will
dated 13 May 1896 which was probably prepared by a solicitor as it was
executed in the presence of a solicitor and a solicitor’s clerk. In the will,
he set up a trust whereby members of his family would benefit from the income
from his estate, and he directed that the distribution of the _corpus_ of his
estate be deferred till 21 years from the death of the survivor of his
children, grandchildren and nephews living at the time of his death.

2 On 30 June 1994, on the application of the applicants who are the trustees
of the will, Warren L H Khoo J ruled that the trusts created in the will
expired on 11 January 2003, and that the _corpus_ of the estate was
distributable on that day.

3 Khoo J deferred deciding on the second part of the application to determine
the true meaning of the words “male issue (not including adopted male) as
shall then be living” when Tan Tye directed his trustees:

to apply my property and the income thereof upon the trusts aforesaid, until
the expiration of the period of twenty one years from the decease of the
survivor of such of my children and grandchildren, and my abovenamed nephews,
as shall be living at my decease. At the expiration of which period, subject
to the trusts aforesaid I direct my trustees or trustee to divide the whole of
any property, among all such of my male issue (not including adopted male) as
shall then be living, in equal shares, per capita.

4 The trustees applied for a determination on whether the following classes of
people:

(a) grandsons and remoter male issue in the exclusively male line for the time
being living of the testator;

(b) male issue of adopted sons of the testator;

(c) adopted sons of the natural male issue of the testator;

(d) grandsons and/or remoter male issue of the testator claiming through
daughters or remoter female issue of the testator; and

(e) persons _en ventre sa mere_ on the distribution date;

are entitled to share in the _corpus_ of Tan Tye’s estate, and the application
came before me after Khoo J had ruled on the date of distribution.

5 Tan Tye had five sons. Three of them, Tan Lian Swee, Tan Cha Boh and Tan
Lian Chye were natural sons. The other two, Tan Seng Chong and Tan Lian Kwee
were adopted sons.

6 The claimants to the _corpus_ fall into four classes:

(a) male persons in the exclusively male line,

(b) male persons of the exclusively male line tracing from Tan Kiok Poh, an
adopted son of Tan Lian Swee,

(c) male persons claiming through the daughters of Tan Lian Chye, and

(d) the estate of the said Tan Lian Chye, who died before the date of
distribution.

7 It is useful to start by ascertaining the meaning of the term “male issue”.
Counsel did not produce authorities on the meaning of the term existing when
Tan Tye made his will in 1896.

8 Assistance was available from other cases. In _Lywood v Kimber_ (1860) 29
Beav 38; 54 ER 539, Sir John Romilly MR held that “issue male” means issue
male claiming through males. “Male issue” was considered in a Singapore
decision, _Re Alkaff’s Settlements_ [1928] SSLR 188, where Sproule ACJ held
that it refers to the male descendants of males. The same term was considered
by the High Court of Australia in _Allen v Crane_ (1953) 89 CLR 152 where
Dixon CJ found at 161 that:

[I]n common with analogous expressions like “male descendants”, “issue male”,
“heirs male”, and “male heirs”, the words “male issue” are to be understood,
unless the contrary appears from the context or circumstances, as referring to
descendants in the male line.

In England, Pennycuick J held in _In re du Cros’ Settlement Trusts_ [1961] 1
WLR 1252 at 1256 that:

[T]he expression “issue male” has a recognised meaning as a term of art, and
means male descendants through the exclusively male line. I do not think that
it would be legitimate to make any distinction for this purpose between the
expression “issue male” and the expression contained in this settlement “male
issue”.

9 There is nothing in the last three cases to suggest that the state of the
law described in them had changed between 1896 and the date of the decisions.
Equally significantly, no cases decided either before or after 1896, or
authorities which gave “male issue” and “issue male” different meanings, were
cited. I accept that male issue are the male descendants of males.

10 None of the claimants disputed that Tan Tye’s male descendants in the
exclusively male line are his male issue, and are entitled to share in the
_corpus_ if they are living on the date of distribution.

11 I shall now refer to the claims from parties outside of the definition.

12 The first class are parties claiming through the daughters of Tan Lian
Chye. Ms Joan Lim Pheck Hoon who acts for them submitted that:

[T]he testator, by not using the words “issue male” which was (by 1896) a term
of art to describe the male descendants to benefit from the corpus of his
estate, had meant all his issue who are male, irrespective of whether they
trace their relation to the testator through the male or female line. In 1896
there were no clear legal authorities that ‘male issue’ had by then become a
term of art;

and:

[I]f the court is inclined to hold that the words ‘male issue’ is a term of
art, then in the context of the will of Tan Tye, the words ‘male issue’ would
yield to the meaning of male descendants through both the male line and the
female line. The testator chose not to use the legal term of art ‘issue male’,
which words would clearly mean male descendants of the exclusively male line
and excluded adopted male children. Instead he took the effort to avoid
legalistic English terms which are difficult to interpret to Chinese and set
out what he really meant by using the words “male issue (not including adopted
male)”, which is all his male descendants related to him by blood, whether by
their father or their mother.

13 The arguments supposed that the person who prepared the will intended the
term “male issue” to bear a meaning different from “issue male” as defined in
_Lywood v Kimber_ , but that person did not define the term, or distinguish it
from “issue male”. The arguments also supposed that Tan Tye, a Chinese
patriarch of the 19th century who differentiated between his male and female
descendants, and his natural and adopted descendants, would ignore the male
descendants’ positions in his family tree, whether they carry his surname or
not. I do not accept these arguments and I find that the term “male issue” in
the will bears the same meaning as “issue male”, which is the male descendants
in the male line.

14 The next claim is from the estate of Tan Lian Chye who died on 22 September
1971, after Tan Tye’s death but before the date of distribution. Ms Lim
submitted that:

The class of male issue begins from the date of death of the testator and
closes on 11 January 2003. Tan Lian Chye is a male issue (not including
adopted male) of the testator. He takes an immediate vested interest upon the
death of the testator. His vested share cannot be divested and passes to his
personal representatives.

15 Ms Lim cited _In re Philps’ Will_ (1869) LR 7 Eq 151 as authority. In that
case the testator provided that on his death his widow should have the use of
the interest of £1,400, and upon her death the money was to be divided between
“my children than [_sic_] living, or there [_sic_] heirs”. The testator had
seven children. Two had died before the will, one leaving a son and the other
without issue.

16 The question to be determined there was whether the heirs of the deceased
were included and, if so, whether the heirs of all the children were let in to
the _corpus_ when the widow died. Lord Romilly MR held at 153:

[T]he word “or” is to be taken conjunctively, and that, therefore, the gift
includes the _heirs_ _of deceased children_. That being so, I think it
includes the heirs of all deceased children, and that it is impossible to make
a distinction with reference to those who died in the lifetime of the
testator. I think he intended all to take, or he would have made some
distinction. [emphasis added]

17 Ms Lim submitted:

[T]he words “then living” are words of limitation. The class must necessarily
include those who are living as at the date of distribution, but does not
include those who are not born as at the date of distribution. The words do
not import a meaning that the beneficiary must survive the perpetuity period.

18 _In re Philp’s Will_ does not support the submission. The judge did not
deal with the words “then living”. He found that there were two classes of
beneficiaries, the children and their heirs, and that not all the heirs would
benefit but only those of deceased children, whether the children died before
or after the testator. His ruling did not touch on the term “then living”
which referred to the time of the death of the testator’s widow, and not the
testator’s death. After the two classes of beneficiaries were determined, I
think the limiting words “then living” would be applied so that only those
children and heirs of the deceased children living at the time of the death of
the widow shared in the estate.

19 Tan Tye’s gift was to his “male issue (not including adopted male) as shall
then be living”. There is only one class, the male issue then living on the
date of distribution. Any issue who was not then living does not get any share
of the _corpus_ , and nothing vested in Tan Lian Chye’s estate.

20 The third class of claimants are male persons of the exclusively male line
tracing from Tan Kiok Poh, the adopted son of Tan Lian Swee (a natural son of
Tan Tye). Mr Kenneth Tan SC, who acts for these claimants, argued that Tan Tye
had intended that his adopted male issue receive shares in the distribution of
the _corpus_ of his estate. He submitted that a critical distinction be made
between the male issue, natural or adopted, of Tan Tye’s natural sons, and the
male issue, natural or adopted, of Tan Tye’s adopted sons.

21 The basis of the argument is that the term “male issue” as understood in
1896, before the enactment of adoption legislation in Singapore, would have
excluded male issue who are adopted, and therefore the words “not including
adopted male” after the term “male issue” were superfluous if Tan Tye wanted
to exclude all male issue who are adopted.  

22 The argument continues, that:

Tan Tye, in the critical sentence says “among all _such_ of my male issue as
shall then be living”. The word “such” is recognized as a device for securing
economy of words. Shortly before the critical sentence to be construed, Tan
Tye had for the purposes of distributing shares in the income from his estate,
listed the names of his five sons – two adopted sons and three natural sons.
Tan Tye used the word “such” to obviate the need of repeating the names of his
five sons whom he had listed shortly before. By using “such”, the Testator was
referring to the male issue of his five sons, ie his two adopted and three
natural sons.” [emphasis in original]

23 He then moved to the interaction between those words and the limiting words
“not including adopted male”. He argued that those words excluded the male
issue of the two adopted sons, so that “the full phrase is a reference to the
male issue of Tan Tye’s sons whether adopted or natural, except for the male
issue of his adopted sons whether adopted or natural” and that “the
parenthesis read in context, selectively excludes only the male issue of Tan
Tye’s two adopted sons”.

24 Tan Tye wanted to exclude adopted males from the male issue who would
inherit the _corpus_ of his estate. The will was specific in stating “not
including adopted male”. It did not limit the classes of adopted males to be
excluded, and it clearly did not point only to the male issue of the adopted
sons. The words used excluded all adopted males. Anyone who is adopted as well
as his issue, natural or adopted, are excluded. There is no reason to restrict
the exclusion in the way counsel submitted.

25 Having examined the positions taken by the trustees and the claimants, I
rule on the question raised in [4] herein that the male issue of Tan Tye in
the exclusively male line living on the date of distribution in class (a) are
entitled to share in the _corpus_ (but not his grandsons as they would be dead
for at least 21 years on the date of distribution), but not the persons in
classes (b), (c) and (d), nor the estate of Tan Lian Chye, nor the male
descendants of Tan Kiok Poh.

26 With regard to class (e), persons _en ventre sa mere_ on the distribution
date, the trustees have ascertained that there are no such persons, and no
claims have been made by anyone on this basis. The question can be treated as
being withdrawn by the applicants, or to have lapsed in so far as it assumed
that there are such persons when in fact there are no such persons.

27 Nevertheless, as it was raised, I shall respond to it by referring to the
decision of the House of Lords in _Elliot v Lord Joicey_ [1935] AC 209 where
Lord Russell of Killowen set out at 233–234 the following rules which are to
be applied, subject to the special context of the document to be construed:

First, words referring to children or issue “born” before, or “living” at, or
(as I think we must add) “surviving,” a particular point of time or event,
will not in their ordinary or natural meaning include a child en ventre sa
mère at the relevant date.

Secondly, the ordinary or natural meaning of the words may be departed from,
and a fictional construction applied to them so as to include therein a child
en ventre sa mère at the relevant date and subsequently born alive if, but
only if, that fictional construction will secure to the child a benefit to
which it would have been entitled if it had been actually born at the relevant
date.

Thirdly, the only reason and the only justification for applying such a
fictional construction is that where a person makes a gift to a class of
children or issue described as “born” before or “living” at or “surviving” a
particular point of time or event, a child en ventre sa mère must necessarily
be within the reason and motive of the gift.

Fourthly, that being the only reason and the only justification for applying
the fictional construction, it follows that, if the person who uses the words
under consideration confers no gift on the children or issue described as
above mentioned, but confers the gift on some one else, it is impossible
(except in the light of subsequent events) to affirm either that the fictional
construction will secure to the child en ventre sa mère a benefit to which if
born it would be entitled, or that the child en ventre sa mère must
necessarily be within the reason and motive of the gift made. In these
circumstances the words used must bear their ordinary or natural meaning.

28 According to the second and third rules, any person coming within class (e)
is entitled to a share of the distribution of the _corpus_.

29 There is another matter I should refer to. There is a judgment dated 7
April 1926 by Sir James William Murison CJ in _Tan Lian Boh v Yap Lian Neo_
(Suit No 147 of 1925) on several issues arising from Tan Tye’s will, _inter
alia_ , that:

[T]he words “All such of my male issue” in the ultimate gifts of the corpus of
the residue of the estate of the said Tan Tye deceased contained in his said
Will means male issue claiming through males in the male line of descent only.

30 At first sight the judgment may prevent further determination of this issue
on the ground of issue estoppel or _res judicata_. When further thought is
given to the matter, the judgment does not have that effect.

31 One of the issues before Murison CJ was the effect of the death of an
income beneficiary, Tan Kye Teng, who died before Tan Tye. When Murison CJ
decided on the issue, there was an earlier judgment on the same question in
Suit No 456 of 1909, and the two judgments were in conflict.

32 In 1935, the trustees took the matter to court again in Originating Summons
No 174 of 1935, reported as _In the Matter of the Trusts of the Will of Tan
Tye deceased_ [1936] MLJ 141; [1936] MLJ Rep 113 for a determination on which
of the two judgments was binding on them.

33 The matter came before Adrian Clark J who ruled at [56] and [57] that “if a
question has been decided as between the trustees and beneficiaries _that
issue_ no longer exists between them”, and “once it is established before me
that _the issue_ between the parties was then non-existent, the judgment of
1926 on that issue must, in my opinion, be treated as being null and non-
existent” [emphasis added].

34 Two points are to be noted. First, Clark J was referring to an issue that
was adjudicated on the 1909 and 1925 actions, not the entire actions. He found
that the effect of Tan Kye Teng’s death on the distribution of the income from
the estate was dealt with in the 1909 and 1925 actions. There was no reference
to the duplication of the “male issue” question in the actions. There was
nothing to suggest that it was dealt with in the 1909 action.

35 Secondly, the 1909 and 1925 actions dealt with the income of the trust.
That must have been raised between the trustees and parties who were, or
claimed to be, the income beneficiaries. The issue before me now relates to
the distribution of the _corpus_ , and the claimants are the _corpus_
beneficiaries or those who claim to be _corpus_ beneficiaries. They are not
bound by decisions relating to the income which is separate and distinct from
their interests or claimed interests in the _corpus_.

36 For these reasons the issue can be raised and considered without
restriction from the 1926 judgment.

37 Having so decided, I will hear counsel on costs.
