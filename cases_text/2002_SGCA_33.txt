**Judgment** __

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. The first appellant, Thongthot Yordsa-Art (‘Thongthot’), and the second
appellant, Dornchinnamat Yingyos (‘Dornchinnamat’), who are both Thai
nationals, were jointly tried and convicted of the following charge:

> > You, Thongthot Yordsa-Art and Dornchinnamat Yingyos, are charged that you,
> on or about the 2nd day of June 2001, between 10.00 p.m. and 12.00 midnight,
> at a vacant lot of land off Pioneer Road North, Singapore, together with 4
> other unknown males were members of an unlawful assembly whose joint common
> object was to cause grievous hurt to one Saenphan Thawan (male/23 years),
> and while you were a member of the said assembly, you and/or one or more of
> the members committed murder by causing the death of the said Saenphan
> Thawan, an offence which you knew to be likely to be committed in the
> prosecution of the common object of the assembly and you have by virtue of
> section 149 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) committed an offence punishable
> under section 302 of the Penal Code.

2\. The trial judge imposed the death sentence on both the appellants.

**A. BACKGROUND**

3\. The deceased, Saenphan Thawan (‘Yaou’), apparently wielded a measure of
influence in an area off Pioneer Road, not far from Kian Teck Road, where a
small community of Thai workers lived. He was in control of gambling,
prostitution and the sale of drugs in the area, which is referred to by Thai
workers as ‘Kian Teck’, a name which will, for convenience, be used in this
judgment.

4\. Ten days before Yaou was killed, Thongthot’s girlfriend, Wena Awaburt
(‘Wena’), went to Kian Teck with a female friend, a Thai prostitute. While
Wena was seated on a discarded bed in Kian Teck, Yaou approached her. He was
not pleased to find her at Kian Teck and showed his displeasure by telling her
‘not to do a man’s job’. He then pointed a knife at her and warned her that he
would arrange to have her raped and silenced if she was seen in the area
again. Wena left in tears and reported the incident to Thongthot, who lived
with a number of other Thai workers in a squatter settlement in a forested
area off Jalan Bahar.

5\. Thongthot was angered by Yaou’s treatment of Wena. Within a few days, he
went with six other men to Kian Teck to look for Yaou. According to him, the
purpose of this trip to Kian Teck was to ask Yaou to apologise to Wena.
However, they did not manage to find Yaou.

6\. A few days later, Thongthot was informed that Yaou was sighted in Kian
Teck. On 2 June 2001, he assembled another group of men to confront Yaou. This
group included the second appellant, Dornchinnamat, and four other Thai men.
The six men gathered at Jalan Bahar for drinks from 6 pm onwards and left for
Kian Teck by taxi at around 10 pm. They were armed and their deadly arsenal of
weapons, which were concealed in umbrellas, included knives, parangs, a long
sword and a variety of metal chains.

7\. After arriving at Kian Teck, Thongthot and his men managed to locate Yaou,
who was with his girlfriend, Namphakdee Thapanee (‘Nam’). During the
confrontation, Yaou tried to flee from Thongthot and his gang but he was soon
cornered and killed by them.

8\. A pathologist, Dr Paul Chui, gave evidence that the injuries inflicted on
Yaou were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause his death. He
pointed out that there were at least three injuries, each of which was
sufficient to result in Yaou’s death. An injury at the back of Yaou’s head was
particularly gruesome. The wound was so deep that Yaou’s brain and spinal cord
were cut.

  2. THE TRIAL

**

9\. At the trial, the prosecution asserted that Thongthot, Dornchinnamat and
their gang went to Kian Teck on 2 June 2001 with the common object of causing
grievous hurt to Yaou. As such, it was submitted that they and the other four
men in their gang were members of an unlawful assembly by virtue of section
141 of the Penal Code, which provides, inter alia, as follows:

> An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an ‘unlawful assembly’ if the
> common object of the persons composing that assembly is –
>
> …
>
> (c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence.

10\. The prosecution also asserted that the members of the unlawful assembly
knew that if their common object was to be achieved, it was likely that Yaou
would be killed. In view of this, it was submitted that Thongthot and
Dornchinnamat were guilty of murder because of section 149 of the Penal Code,
which provides as follows:

> If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in
> prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of
> that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that
> object, every person who, at the time of committing that offence, is a
> member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence.

11\. Both Thongthot and Dornchinnamat admitted that they were part of the gang
which confronted Yaou and killed him on the evening of 2 June 2001. However,
they denied that the common object of their gang was to cause grievous hurt to
Yaou. Thongthot, who admitted that he stabbed Yaou, said that his object was
merely to teach Yaou a lesson by getting him to apologise to his girlfriend,
Wena. As for Dornchinnamat, who admitted in his statements to the police that
he participated in the attack on Yaou, he asserted that the incriminating
parts in the said statements were not interpreted to him by the Thai
interpreter and did not reflect what he had told the police. He also said that
when the statements were read to him before he signed them, he did not pay
attention as he was under physical and mental stress.

__

The trial judge’s decision

__

12\. The trial judge said that the main issues before him were whether or not
Thongthot and Dornchinnamat and their gang went to Kian Teck on 2 June 2001
with the common object of causing Yaou grievous hurt and whether or not the
members of the gang knew that Yaou’s death would be a likely result of what
they would do in pursuit of their common object. He did not believe that
Thongthot and his gang merely wanted Yaou to apologise to Wena. He was
convinced that Yaou’s assailants went to Kian Teck fully and dangerously armed
to cause serious and grievous harm to Yaou. He thus accepted that Thongthot
and Dornchinnamat were members of an unlawful assembly and proceeded to
consider the effect of section 149 of the Penal Code.

13\. The trial judge noted that Thongthot admitted in court that he stabbed
Yaou with a knife although he claimed that this was done to ‘stop Yaou from
running’, a claim which could not be believed. He also took into account the
fact that Dornchinnamat had confessed to having played a role in the killing
of Yaou and rejected his assertion that he did not incriminate himself in his
statements to the police. The trial judge said that it was unnecessary for him
to re-enact every blow struck during the murder ‘for it does not matter who
struck first, or who struck most or who struck the hardest’. What was
important was that the unlawful assembly had the common object of causing
grievous hurt to Yaou and that its members knew that the pursuit of their
common object was likely to result in Yaou’s death. As Yaou was killed, he
held that it was evident from section 149 of the Penal Code that Thongthot and
Dornchinnamat had committed murder, an offence punishable under section 302 of
the Penal Code.

**

C. THE APPEAL

**

14\. The main thrust of the appellants’ case was that the trial judge erred
when he held that they wanted to exact revenge on Yaou and that they carried
weapons to Kian Teck so that grievous hurt could be caused to Yaou. Thongthot
reiterated that he and the other members of his gang only intended to extract
an apology from Yaou and not to kill him.

15\. It cannot be disputed that Thongthot and Dornchinnamat and the other
members of their gang were, by virtue of section 141 of the Penal Code,
members of an unlawful assembly as there was ample evidence at the trial that
their common object was to cause grievous hurt to Yaou. The remaining issue
before us concerns the application of section 149 of the Penal Code to the
circumstances of this case.

16\. The meaning of the term ‘common object’ has been considered by the courts
on innumerable occasions. In _Chandran v Public Prosecutor,_[1992] 2 SLR 265,
269, this court noted as follows:

> Section 149 does not require proof of a pre-arranged plan and a common
> intention which a prosecution involving s 34 of the Code would require. The
> ‘common object’ under s 149 of the Code must not be confused with the
> ‘common intention’ under s 34 of the Code. Though they both deal with what
> may be called ‘constructive liability’ for crime, it is important to see the
> distinction and the way both sections operate.
>
> In _Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor_ , Lord Sumner at p 7 said:
>
> There is a difference between object and intention, for though their object
> is common, the intentions of several members may differ and indeed may be
> similar only in the respect that they are all unlawful while the element of
> participation in action which is the leading feature of s 34, is replaced in
> s 149, by membership of the assembly at the time of the committing of the
> offence. Both sections deal with combinations of persons who become
> punishable as sharers in an offence.

17\. In our view, the trial judge cannot be faulted for holding that the
appellants and the other members of the unlawful assembly knew that it was
likely that Yaou would be killed when they acted in pursuit of their common
intention to cause him grievous hurt. The appellants tried to downplay the
significance of their deadly arsenal of weapons by asserting that the weapons
were only intended for self-defence. However, it is evident from the
circumstances of the case and the ferocity of the attack on Yaou that this
could not have been the case. If the weapons had indeed been carried by the
appellants and the other members of the unlawful assembly for self-defence,
Yaou would not have been killed. After all, Thongthot testified that Yaou was
unarmed and outnumbered and that he was running away when he was savagely
attacked. When questioned, he said as follows:

Q. So when he got up to run away, he ran away alone?

A.…. __[H]e was alone__.

Q. And he was not carrying any weapons?

A. When he got up, __I don’t see him carry anything__.

Q. You were at [Yaou’s] side. That means Yaou was not attacking you when you
stabbed him?

A. No, __he was running__.

18\. Thongthot also shed some light on the common object of the unlawful
assembly. When cross-examined, he said as follows:

Q. Wouldn’t [it] have been better to just let Yaou run away?

__

_ A. _You think it’s better if he runs and the others chase after him and kill
him_?_

Don’t you think that I … better … stop him?

Q. … you think they would have killed him?

A. The thing happened was Rang carried a long sword and I can’t tell what was
going to happen when Rang chased after Yaou at the dark area.

__

_ Q. _But you were worried he could have killed Yaou__? __

___A.___Yes, your Honour_ …_ __

Q. …. You could have stopped two people who were your friends. Why did you not
tell them to stop?

> A. … __even I can stop [them], there were three more that I do not know
> where they were. They might_ _attack_ _Yaou as well__.

19\. When considering the effect of section 149 of the Penal Code in relation
to ‘an offence committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution
of the common object of that assembly’, it did not escape our attention that
all the members of the unlawful assembly played a part in killing Yaou.
Thongthot testified that after he stabbed Yaou twice, the other members of the
unlawful assembly surrounded Yaou and Dornchinnamat slashed Yaou’s head with
great force. Another member of the unlawful assembly then slashed Yaou on the
neck. Dornchinnamat corroborated this evidence when he said that the other
members of his group continued to attack Yaou after he had slashed Yaou on the
head. In these circumstances, there can be no doubt that the assailants knew
that it was likely that their actions in furtherance of their common object of
causing Yaou grievous hurt would result in his death. We thus saw no reason to
interfere with the findings and verdict of the trial judge.

 __The second appellant’s other grounds of appeal__

20\. Before concluding, reference will be made to the second appellant’s other
grounds of appeal, which, in our view, had no merit whatsoever. Dornchinnamat
asserted that portions of his own statements to the police and the confession
of his co-accused, Thongthot, who implicated him in the murder of Yaou, should
not have been relied upon by the trial judge.

21\. Dornchinnamat’s statements to the police will first be considered. As has
been mentioned, he retracted substantial portions of these statements during
the trial. He claimed that the retracted portions of the statements in
question did not reflect what he actually said and that he did not pay
attention when his statements were read to him by the Thai interpreter,
Tasneeporn.

22\. It is trite law that the retraction by an accused of his confession of
guilt does not prevent the confession from being relied on if the judge
believes that it is the truth. (See, for instance, _Yap Sow Keong v Public
Prosecutor_[1947] MLJ 90 and _Ismail bin UK Abdul Rahman v Public
Prosecutor_[1972-1974] SLR 232). The trial judge had reason to believe that
Dornchinnamat was telling the truth when he confessed that he had played a
part in the killing of Yaou. Dornchinnamat’s two long statements were made
nearly two weeks after he was arrested and each of the two-day sessions ended
by around 2.15 pm. Both SSgt Daniel Teo, who recorded the statements, and the
Thai interpreter, Tasneeporn, testified that the recorded statements were made
by Dornchinnamat and that he was invited to amend any part of the statements
before acknowledging that they were correct. The interpreter is an independent
party and has no reason to fabricate evidence. Furthermore, as Dornchinnamat
knew that he was facing a capital charge, it is most unlikely that he was not
paying attention when his statements were read to him. We thus agreed with the
trial judge that Dornchinnamat’s confession may be relied upon as evidence of
his guilt.

23\. As for Dornchinnamat’s assertion that the confession of his co-accused,
Thongthot, should not have been given any weight by the trial judge, the
courts have, on numerous occasions, considered whether or not a confession of
an accused may be used against a co-accused. In _Chin Seow Noi v Public
Prosecutor_[1994] 1 SLR 135, this court reiterated that the conviction of an
accused can be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his co-accused
if the confession establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is
guilty. In the present case, there was no incentive for Thongthot to lie about
Dornchinnamat’s role in the murder of Yaou. He had already admitted that he
was part of the gang that took Yaou’s life and his account of the events at
Kian Teck on the evening of 2 June 2001, including the fact that Dornchinnamat
slashed Yaou on the head, is consistent with Dornchinnamat’s own admission in
his statements to the police and with the eye-witness account by Yaou’s
girlfriend, Nam. As such, the trial judge was entitled to take into account
Thongthot’s evidence that Dornchinnamat played a role in the killing of Yaou.

**

D. CONCLUSION

**

24\. As Thongthot and Dornchinnamat did not establish that the trial judge
erred in finding them guilty of the charge faced by them, their appeals were
dismissed.
