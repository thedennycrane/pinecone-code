High Court — HC/RAS No 18 of 2017 (DC Suit No 556 of 2016)  
Choo Han Teck J  
25 September 2017

9 October 2017 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff is the treasurer in the Executive Committee of the Singapore
Chess Federation (“SCF”). He is suing 39 members of the SCF for libel. The
plaintiff alleges that the libel is found in a letter of requisition for an
extraordinary general meeting (“EOGM”) signed by the signatories. The
defendant sent the requisition to the Executive Committee to seek a vote of no
confidence in the president of the SCF as well as the members of the Executive
Committee. The letter of requisition is dated 6 January 2016.

2 The reasons for the request are found in an undated letter attached as part
of the letter of requisition. This undated letter referred to the resignation
of Miss Anjela Khegay (“Anjela”), who was employed by SCF as a trainer from
January 2014 and resigned on 31 August 2015.

3 The plaintiff’s case is that the attached letter is defamatory because it
claimed that Anjela resigned because of an incident which took place on 30
August 2015 in the SCF’s office, involving “two Council members” and “sexual
misconduct in the premises of SCF”. The letter goes on to say that two vice-
presidents of the SCF had been asked to interview “Anjela and the two Council
members implicated (Tony Tan and Nisban Jasmin [the plaintiff])”.

4 All 39 defendants are part of the group of 51 signatories to the letter
requesting an EOGM, but not all 51 had been named as defendants. 15 defendants
are not involved because they are separately represented and are not parties
to the application to strike out and this appeal. The other 24 defendants
applied to strike out the plaintiff’s suit under Order 18 r 19(1)(a) and (d)
of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed). That order provides as
follows —

19.—(1) The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out
or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or
anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —

(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;

…

(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,

and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered
accordingly, as the case may be.

The application was struck out by a deputy registrar of the State Courts. The
plaintiff appealed to District Judge David Lim who allowed his appeal and
restored the action. The defendants then appealed before me against District
Judge Lim’s order.

5 Mr Wong Tjen Wee (“Mr Wong”) represented the appellants here and relies on
an English Court of Appeal case, Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005]
QB 946 (“Jameel”) to justify an order that this action be struck out. Mr Wong
submitted that Jameel is authority for the proposition that where a defamation
action is so trivial or pointless such that it would be disproportionate to
permit it to proceed it any further, such an action would be struck out for an
abuse of process of the Court as the action does not amount to a ‘real and
substantial tort’”. This statement must be understood in the context of the
Jameel case itself.

6 Jameel involved the publication of the alleged libel through the internet
and read worldwide. The plaintiff chose England as the forum to sue even
though only five persons in the UK read it; three of the five were associates
of the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal there was of the view that the plaintiff
was forum shopping; and that the question of jurisdiction was another issue
the plaintiff had to properly establish. Furthermore, the idea of striking out
a libel action in England was more readily acceptable because of two
developments there. The first was the then new Civil Procedure Rules and the
second was the Human Rights Act of 1998. Lord Philips held that English courts
must thus balance the freedom of expression with the protection of individual
reputation. It was in the above context that the court considered whether “the
game was worth the candle”. Improving on the comment at first instance, Lord
Philips held that it was not only “not have been worth the candle, it will not
have been worth the wick”.

7 The crux of the matter is that although the court’s resources ought not to
be used for the pursuit of trivial or pointless claims, each case must be
determined on its own facts. Counsel referred to the Jameel case as espousing
the “Jameel Doctrine”, as if it were an exception in law or a law unto itself.
It is, for the reasons I set out above, not entirely so. The law that
ultimately governs the striking out of an action is under O 18 r 19(d), as the
words there express: “it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court”.
Each case must turn on its own facts.

8 In the present case before me, the defamatory words are found in a letter
circulated among members of the SCF seeking signatures in support of an EOGM
with the view of expelling the sitting executive committee. This letter was
signed by 51 members. We do not know how many others read it but did not sign.
The defamatory words are in item 2 of the letter under the heading
“Resignation of SCF Trainer Ms Anjela Khegay”.

9 When a letter refers to the resignation of a female staff and states that it
involved sexual misconduct “and the two Council members implicated (Tony Tan
and Nisban Jasmin)”, it is prima facie defamatory. Whether the letter can be
justified, and whether there is substantial or minimal damage are matters for
trial. This is a case that cannot be regarded as an abuse of the process of
court. Where else can the plaintiff seek redress and justice if his claim is
struck out?

10 Mr Wong raised a further argument that the only recipients of the
defamatory letter, were the executive committee members and the administrative
staff. Mr Wong contended that these recipients would not have believed the
libel against the plaintiff. That argument is generally speculative and is in
any case more relevant at the assessment of damages when liability is
established.

11 For the reasons above, the appeal is dismissed with costs to be taxed if
not agreed.
