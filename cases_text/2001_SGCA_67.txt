**__**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

**(Consequential Orders and Costs)**

1\. In our judgment delivered on 26 September 2001, we invited the parties in
Civil Appeal No. 164 of 2000 to submit written arguments on what further
consequential orders we should make to give effect to what we have decided,
and the parties in Civil Appeal No. 167 of 2000 to submit written arguments on
the issue of costs here and below. In response, the solicitors for the
respective parties submitted their written arguments which we have now
considered.

_**

  
Civil Appeal No 164 of 2000

**_

2\. We deal first with the question of the further consequential orders we
should make in Civil Appeal No. 164 of 2000.

_**

  
Transfer of plot 3

**_

3\. In their written submissions, the solicitors for Madam Ho ask for an order
that RHB, as the mortgagee in possession, apply at their own costs and expense
to the relevant authorities for approval for subdivision of the property into
three subdivided lots as contemplated in the sale agreement made between Madam
Ho and Ms Lim, and upon such approval being granted, at their own costs and
expense, to transfer the subdivided lot marked as plot 3 to Madam Ho without
any payment and free from encumbrances. We are unable to accede to this
request. There is no justification for such an order. While RHB, in taking the
mortgage of the property, recognised Madam Hos interest in the property and
agreed to be bound by that interest, they did not agree to be bound by what Ms
Lim had agreed to perform under the sale agreement. To direct RHB to take such
steps would, in effect, require them to perform in part the obligations of Ms
Lim under the sale agreement, to which RHB had never agreed either in the
mortgage or in the Regulating Agreement. It may be that, at the end of the
day, notwithstanding the realization of her interest in the property, Madam Ho
would not be able to recoup the loss she has sustained, but she is not without
remedy and is at liberty to have recourse against the relevant party or
parties for recovery of her loss or any part of it, as she may be advised.

_**

  
Costs to WLAW

**_

4\. The solicitors for Madam Ho also make lengthy submissions on the costs
which the court below ordered Madam Ho to pay to WLAW upon dismissal of her
claim against them. Although Madam Ho in the notice of appeal joined WLAW as
the second respondents in Civil Appeal No. 164 of 2000, she did not in the
Case for the Appellant appeal against the order below dismissing her claim
against WLAW. Notwithstanding that, her solicitors in their written
submissions raise an extraordinary argument that WLAW should now be deprived
of the costs below, or in the alternative a Sanderson order or a Bullock order
should now be made in her favour. We are unable to entertain such an
application at this stage. The insurmountable obstacle in the way is that
Madam Ho did not appeal against the order below dismissing her claim against
WLAW with costs, and that order stands. It is not in any way affected by the
judgment we have delivered.

5\. We now come to the costs of WLAW in Civil Appeal No. 164 of 2000\.
Apparently they were not aware that Madam Ho was not pursuing her appeal
against the dismissal of her claim against them until on or about 18 June
2001, when Madam Hos solicitors served on their solicitors the Case for the
Appellant. It is now submitted by the solicitors for WLAW that Madam Ho should
bear and pay their costs incurred in the appeal up 18 June 2001. We agree with
this argument. WLAW are entitled to such costs in the appeal, and we so order.

_**

  
Claim of RHB

**_

6\. The solicitors for RHB in their written submissions also advance an
extraordinary argument. They submit that, having regard to what we have
decided, RHB now have a claim against WLAW for breach of duty and/or
negligence on the part of Ms Leong, and that they propose to initiate an
action against WLAW. By reason of this action or proposed action, RHB now seek
a stay of the order for costs made against them. This argument is totally
unsustainable. If RHB wish to clutch on what we have decided to found their
cause of action against Ms Leong, they are of course at liberty to do so; no
doubt they would take adequate and proper legal advice before so deciding. But
whatever proceedings they wish to take, or are presently taking, is not a
ground for a stay of the order made against them, whether in respect of costs
or otherwise. We can find no reason for a stay.

7\. Next, RHB request that the costs awarded against them and Ms Lim be
apportioned in equal proportions so that each of them will bear only 50% of
the costs. We are unable to accede to this request. The order we made against
them in 55 of our judgment is against the two parties jointly and severally.
Under that order, either or both of them will have to bear and pay the costs
here and below of Madam Ho and the party who has paid the costs will be
entitled to seek a contribution from the other. In this case, the fact that Ms
Lim is a bankrupt and therefore is not in a position to make any contribution
is not a ground for this Court to vary the order made. The order made is the
usual order against two or more unsuccessful parties to an action or
proceeding, whether as plaintiffs or defendants.

_**

  
Outgoings of the property

**_

8\. RHB seek a further consequential order that that Madam Ho should bear one
third of the outgoings reasonably incurred in maintaining the property as from
the date they took possession, including the property tax paid in respect
thereof. We agree, and a consequential order to that effect should be made.

_**

  
Consequential order

**_

9\. Further to what we have ordered on 26 September 2000, we now make the
following consequential orders:

> (1) that the property be sold at such time, in such manner and at such price
> as RHB and Madam Ho may agree, and in default of agreement as the court may
> direct; but nothing in this direction is deemed to relieve RHB from their
> obligations as mortgagee in exercising the power of sale;
>
> (2) that for the purpose of giving effect to the above, RHB and/or Madam Ho
> be at liberty to apply to the High Court for all necessary directions in
> connection with the sale of the property; and
>
> (3) that pending the sale of the property, the outgoings of the property
> reasonably incurred by RHB, including the payment of property tax thereon,
> shall be apportioned in the proportions of two-thirds thereof to RHB and one
> third thereof to Madam Ho, and in this connection an account be taken of the
> outgoings reasonably incurred by RHB.

Civil Appeal No 167 of 2000

**_

10\. We now turn to the question of costs in Civil Appeal No. 167 of 2000. The
solicitors for Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah in their written submissions argue that,
in so far as the proceedings under O 59 r 8 and this appeal are concerned,
their clients should be considered as the successful parties, and that WLAW
and RHB the unsuccessful parties, and accordingly costs should follow the
event. They further submit that the appellants have not misconducted
themselves in any way and there are no particular circumstances or reasons
which call for the court to make any other order as to costs.

11\. On the other hand, the solicitors for RHB in their written submissions
argue that there are in this case special circumstances which call for a
departure from the normal rule that costs follow the event. They draw our
attention to the conduct of Mr Wong in handling the transaction for Madam Ho,
which gave rise to the litigation and also the conduct of Mr Ponniah in
prosecuting the claim which was certainly not beyond reproach, and that having
regard to such conduct no order as to costs both here and below should be
made.

12\. The general principles are that costs are in the discretion of the court,
and that costs should follow the event, except when it appears to the court
that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made: _Re
Elgindata (No. 2)_ [1993] 1 All ER 232, _Tullio v Maoro_ [1994] 2 SLR 489. In
considering such an issue the court is entitled to look at all the
circumstances of the case including any matters that led to the litigation.
Thus, in _Bostock v Ramsey Urban District Council_ [1900] 2 QB 616, the
successful defendant was deprived of its costs and in coming to this
conclusion the court took into account conduct of the defendant prior to the
litigation, which led the plaintiff reasonably to suppose that he had a cause
of action against the defendant and thus induced him to commence the action. A
L Smith LJ said at p 622:

> It seems to me that the Lord Chief Justice was right when on general
> principles he came to the conclusion that "the judge is not confined to the
> consideration of the defendants conduct in the actual litigation itself, but
> may also take into consideration matters which led up to and were the
> occasion of that litigation." I say on general principles, because his
> attention does not appear to have been called to the case of _Harnett v
> Vise_ 5 Ex D 307, in which it was distinctly held by the Court of Appeal
> that the judge is not confined, in considering the question whether there is
> good cause for depriving the successful party of costs, to the conduct of
> the parties in the litigation itself, but must consider the whole
> circumstances of the case and everything which led to the action. I think
> that in this case there was evidence of conduct on the part of the
> defendants such as to lead the plaintiff reasonably to think that he had a
> good cause of action against them, and which the judge was entitled to take
> into consideration as constituting good cause for depriving the defendants
> of costs.

13\. In _Lee Seng Choon Ronnie v Singapore Island Country Club_ [1993] 2 SLR
456, although the appellant there successfully obtained the declaration sought
by him pertaining to the retention of his club membership, the Court of Appeal
nevertheless deprived him of the costs of the appeal and the hearing below
after taking into account the appellants conduct. The Court said at p 465:

> For the reasons we have given in this judgment this appeal succeeds, but the
> appellants conduct has not commended itself to us. His denial of having
> received the notices sent to him by the club and yet being able to produce
> to the court the third and final reminder [effectively the second notice
> under r 47(e)] claiming it was a file copy obtained for him by an unnamed
> friend, when the club did not keep copies of the second and subsequent
> reminders, was deplorable. The sending of an unsigned cheque might be
> excused but failure to pay relatively small amounts of his clubs bills under
> the pretext of frequent travelling abroad and the unauthorized signing of
> chits by his son are really inexcusable and show a cavalier attitude and
> disregard of the clubs rules.
>
> Although the appellant has succeeded in his appeal and he is entitled to a
> declaration that he was at all material times a member of the club, which we
> duly grant him, he is not entitled to an order for the assessment of damages
> or to the other two declarations sought. We further record our
> disapprobation of the appellants conduct by denying him the costs of this
> appeal as well as the costs before the learned judicial commissioner.

14\. Similarly, in _Universal Westech (S) Pte Ltd v Ng Thiam Kiat & Ors_
[1997] 2 SLR 139, Kan Ting Chiu J found that although the plaintiff in that
case failed in its claim against the first defendant, the latters conduct
towards the plaintiff was not beyond reproach as he had probably used a
business plan to compete with his ex-employers and had led the second
defendant into breaching his fiduciary duty as an employee of the plaintiff.
The learned judge then deprived the first defendant of half of his costs. The
learned judges decision on costs was subsequently upheld by the Court of
Appeal: see _Ng Thiam Kiat & Ors v Universal Westech (S) Pte Ltd and another
appeal_ [1997] 3 SLR 419.

15\. We now revert to the facts of this case. First, it is quite apparent to
us that the manner in which Mr Wong had handled the transaction for Madam Ho
had, to a considerable extent, contributed to the present litigation.
Secondly, there was a serious objection to Mr Ponniah acting for Madam Ho and
also the objectionable manner in which he had conducted the litigation below.
The judge below dealt with the conduct of both Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah in some
detail and was extremely critical of Mr Wong on the tardy manner in which he
sought to protect Madam Hos interest in the property, and the manner in which
Mr Ponniah conducted the litigation. While we allowed the appeal, we did not
disapprove of what the judge said with reference to their conduct, which we
find is relevant in deciding the question of costs. Having regard to these
matters, we decide not to award any costs to Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah here and
below. We therefore make no order as to costs. The deposit in court, with
interest, if any, is to be refunded to them.
