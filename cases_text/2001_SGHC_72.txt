Companies – Schemes of arrangement – Approval by the court – Whether scheme
can discharge liabilities of guarantors of debtors – Position when one
creditor objects to scheme – s 210 Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Ed)  
  

: The application before the court was made by CEL Tractors Pte Ltd (`the
company`) to approve the scheme of arrangement under s 210 of the Companies
Act (Cap 50, 1994 Ed).  
  
Section 210(1) and (3) provide that:

> _
>
> (1) Where a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a company and its
> creditors or any class of them or between the company and its members or any
> class of them, the Court may, on the application in a summary way of the

and

> creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members present and
> voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting or the adjourned meeting
> agrees to any compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement
> shall, if approved by order of the Court, be binding on all the creditors or
> class of creditors or on the members or class of members, as the case may
> be, and also on the company or, in the case of a company in the course of
> being wound up, on the liquidator and contributories of the company.
>
> _

  
  
The scheme had been considered at a meeting between the company and some of
its creditors when it was accepted by a majority of 88.89% of the creditors (8
of 9 creditors) holding 95.62% of the debt ($16,328,825 of $17,076,274).  
  
The sole objecting creditor was Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd (`Daewoo`). Daewoo
claimed against the company the sum of $747,449. Daewoo also had a claim
against Lim Chee Seng, a director of the company under a guarantee he gave to
Daewoo in connection with the company`s indebtedness to Daewoo. All the other
creditors also held guarantees for the debts owing to them.  
  
Daewoo opposed the scheme because it would discharge the guarantee. Clause
4.3.1 of the scheme provides that

> _Upon the Company fulfilling its obligations under Clause 4.1.1.1 and Clause
> 4.1.1.2, (a) the Bank Creditors shall fully and completely discharge all and
> any of its rights under the Deed of Debenture and the Creditors` Mortgage,
> and save for Keppel TatLee Bank Limited, shall fully and completely release
> each and every Bank Guarantor from his obligations under any and each Bank
> Guarantee, and (b) Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd shall fully and completely
> release the Daewoo Guarantor from his obligations under the Daewoo
> Guarantee._

  
  
At the hearing counsel for Daewoo stated that his clients were not against the
whole scheme, but they wanted it to be approved with a proviso that the
arrangement shall not affect the Daewoo guarantee.  
  
He submitted that a scheme cannot affect the rights of parties other than the
creditors and the debtor company. He cited several Australian authorities in
support of the proposition. The cases dealt with arrangements under s 181 of
the Companies Act 1961 and other Australian provisions which are similar to s
210(1) and (3).  
  
Most of the cases cited traced back to **Hill v Anderson Meat Industries**
[1971] NSWLR 868. The brief facts of this case are that five subsidiaries of
the defendant company (hereinafter referred to as `Anderson`) were affected by
schemes of arrangement whereby their creditors discharged the subsidiaries
from their debts in consideration of Anderson making a payment to the scheme
trustee. There were no express provisions in the schemes which discharged the
guarantees. Some of the subsidiaries` debts were guaranteed by Anderson. The
plaintiff Mrs Hill was a creditor who voted against the scheme, and she
contended that Anderson was liable to pay her under the guarantee.  
  
The matter came on before Street J. The judge referred with approval to Dixon
J`s pronouncement in **McDonald v Dennys Lascelles** [1933] 48 CLR 457that
although as a general principle, the extinction of a principal obligation
necessarily induces the extinction of the surety`s obligation, the principle
does not extend to a discharge of the principal debtor`s personal liability by
operation of law when the discharge is for the purpose of liquidating his
affairs or transforming the rights of the creditor against him into rights
against or in respect of his assets.  
  
Street J went on to find for Mrs Hill on the basis that

> _Where ... a scheme of arrangement is propounded in connection with the
> affairs of an insolvent company, then the court`s approval under s. 181 will
> give to the scheme a statutory operation upon the relationship between the
> debtor company and its creditors, and so far as concerns a guarantor, in the
> absence of any special provision in the guarantee agreement, the guarantor`s
> liability subsists ..._

  
  
When the matter went on appeal ([1972] 2 NSWLR 704) the Court of Appeal
affirmed it. Jacobs P and Hope JA in their judgments stated that the guarantee
would remain in force even if Mrs Hill had voted in favour of the scheme.  
  
In another case **Re Glendale Land Development** [1982] 7 ACLR 171, McLelland
J came to a similar conclusion by another approach. He held that an
arrangement cannot affect third party rights and liabilities because

> _(t)he only effect of approval by the court of an arrangement ... is to
> render the arrangement binding as between the creditors or relevant class
> thereof or members or relevant class thereof on the one hand, and the
> company (and if in the course of being wound up, the liquidator and
> contributories) on the other hand. A scheme of arrangement cannot thereby be
> rendered binding as between, eg, the members on the one hand and an outsider
> on the other. In**Isles v Daily Mail Newspaper** [1912] 14 CLR 193 at 204-5,
> Isaacs J made a similar point in an analogous context: "The only
> arrangements which it (ie the court) has jurisdiction to sanction are those
> between the debtor and the creditor; putting it shortly, none others are
> stated to be bound, and therefore there are no others with whom by force of
> the statute operating on the curial order, the minority can be brought into
> compulsory contractual relation."_

  
  
In England matters were in a similar position until the enactment of the
Insolvency Act 1986. In **Re Garner`s Motors** [1937] Ch 594, the High Court
considered a scheme of arrangement sanctioned under s 153 of the Companies Act
1929 (which is now s 425 of the Companies Act 1985, and is similar to s 181
and s 210). Garner`s Motors Ltd was in voluntary liquidation. Temple Press Ld
claimed that Garner`s Motors was jointly and severally liable with Sentinel
Waggon Works, Ld to pay it Â£379 5s. Garner`s Motor`s liquidators rejected
Temple Press`s proof of debt on the ground that the company was discharged
from its liability under a scheme of arrangement between Sentinel Waggon Works
and its creditors whereby Sentinel`s liabilities were discharged.  
  
Crossman J overruled the liquidators and explained that

> _It is settled law that accord and satisfaction between a creditor and one
> of several debtors, who are jointly and severally liable to the creditor,
> discharges the other debtors unless it appears from the terms of the
> agreement or the surrounding circumstances that the creditor intended to
> reserve his rights against them. The law is in my opinion correctly stated
> in**Halsbury`s Laws of England** (second edition), vol. 7, p. 237, para.
> 324. But in my judgment a discharge of one of several joint debtors by
> operation of law does not discharge the other debtors. In my judgment the
> effect of s. 153 of the Companies Act, 1929, is to give to a scheme when
> sanctioned by the Court under the section a statutory operation. The scheme
> when sanctioned by the Court becomes something quite different from a mere
> agreement signed by the parties. It becomes a statutory scheme. In my
> judgment, therefore, the discharge of Sentinel Waggon Works, Ld., from the
> debt to Temple Press, Ld., which was effected under clause 15 of the scheme
> sanctioned by the Court on March 23, 1936, did not have the effect of
> discharging Garner`s Motors, Ld., from its liability in respect of the
> debt._

  
  
The Insolvency Act 1986 provides new and simplified procedures for voluntary
arrangements for companies and individuals which do not require the approval
of court. Section 5(2) which deals with arrangements of companies states that

> _The approved voluntary arrangement -_

> _
>
> (a) takes effect as if made by the company at the creditors` meeting, and
>
> (b) binds every person who in accordance with the rules had notice of, and
> was entitled to vote at, that meeting (whether or not he was present or
> represented at the meeting) as if he were a party to the voluntary
> arrangement.
>
> _

  
  
and s 260(2) which relates to arrangements of individual persons states that

> _The approved arrangement -_

> _
>
> (a) takes effect as if made by the debtor at the meeting, and
>
> (b) binds every person who in accordance with the rules had notice of, and
> was entitled to vote at, the meeting (whether or not he was present or
> represented at it) as if he were a party to the arrangement.
>
> _

  
  
The passage of the Insolvency Act did not bring an immediate change in the
liabilities of third parties, as demonstrated in **RA Securities v Mercantile
Credit Co** [1994] 2 BCLC 721[1995] 3 All ER 581. The plaintiffs in this case
were landlords who granted a lease to the defendants. The lease was then
assigned to a bank which in turn assigned it to another company. That company
subsequently entered a voluntary arrangement under the Insolvency Act whereby
it was to surrender the lease. The plaintiffs did not support the arrangement
but were deemed to be bound by it under s 5(2). In fact the lease was not
surrendered, and the plaintiffs sued the original lessees for pre-arrangement
and post-arrangement rent.  
  
Jacob J held that a voluntary company arrangement does not release a co-
debtor. He stated ([1994] 2 BCLC 721 at 723; [1995] 3 All ER 581 at 584):

> _I prefer to consider the matter as a question of principle first. The
> purpose of voluntary arrangements is to enable a company (or individual, for
> which case provision is made in Pt VIII) to come to a composition with
> creditors so that the more drastic step of liquidation or bankruptcy can be
> avoided, if possible. It is better to keep the show on the road than close
> it down even if creditors have to accept less than their nominal (but not
> achievable) entitlement. The whole scheme is not for the benefit of solvent
> parties who happen to owe debts also owed by the debtor. It would in my
> judgment be unfair if a solvent debtor escaped liability as a side-wind of
> the voluntary arrangement system._

  
  
The judge was not persuaded that the plaintiffs were bound by the arrangement.
He said ([1994] 2 BCLC 721 at 724; [1995] 3 All ER 581 at 585):

> _Turning back to s 5, does `binds every person` have any effect outside the
> voluntary arrangement? I think not. The effect of the binding is solely as
> between the parties bound - those entitled to vote, whether they did or not.
> An outsider ... can get no assistance from the terms of the voluntary
> arrangement as such._

  
  
He then went on to add ([1994] 2 BCLC 721 at 725-726; [1995] 3 All ER 581 at
586):

> _True it is that the landlords are bound by the voluntary arrangement. But
> they did not in fact voluntarily accept some other performance. There was no
> `accord` in truth - just a statutory binding. I do not regard failure to
> exercise the option to turn up at the creditors meeting and argue for some
> other arrangement as amounting to an `accord` - a true `acceptance`._

  
  
and concluded ([1994] 2 BCLC 721 at 726; [1995] 3 All ER 581 at 587) that it
is an error to turn a statutory binding into a consent.  
  
A change came with the Court of Appeal`s decision in **Johnson v Davies**
[1998] 2 BCLC 252[1998] 2 All ER 649. In this decision the court rejected the
notion that in principle a voluntary arrangement made under the Insolvency Act
cannot release a co-debtor or surety, and ruled that the effect of any
arrangement should be determined by construing its terms - see the judgment of
Chadwick LJ ([1998] 2 BCLC 252 at 270; [1998] 2 All ER 649 at 666).  
  
Before coming to that conclusion, the learned judge reviewed the case law and
the statutory provisions on voluntary arrangements.  
  
Chadwick LJ referred to **Deanplan v Mahmoud** [1993] Ch 151[1992] 3 All ER
945 where Judge Paul Baker QC ruled that where one joint and several
covenantor is released by accord and satisfaction, all are released. Chadwick
LJ agreed with Judge Baker`s analysis that unless the co-covenantors are also
released, they remain liable to the creditor, and when the creditor enforces
its rights against them, they have a right of contribution or indemnity
against the released covenantor. If this happened, the creditor would be
committing a breach of the contract with the released covenantor because the
latter would not be fully released from his liabilities inasmuch as he is
still under a liability to contribute to or indemnify the co-covenantors.  
  
The learned judge also referred to **_RA Securities_** (supra). The
distinction Jacob J made between actual consent and the statutory binding did
not find favour with him. He referred to s 260(2) and found ([1998] 2 BCLC 252
at 261; [1998] 2 All ER 649 at 658):

> _There is nothing in that subsection, or elsewhere, which saves a party who
> is bound `as if he were a party to the arrangement` from the consequences
> which would follow as a matter of law if he were indeed a party to the
> arrangement. The statutory hypothesis is that the person who has notice of
> and was entitled to vote at the meeting is party to an arrangement to which
> he has given his consent._

  
  
Upon the completion of the review, Chadwick LJ concluded ([1998] 2 BCLC 252 at
270; [1998] 2 All ER 649 at 665) that fundamentally:

> _Whether or not to exclude co-debtors and sureties from the operation, under
> the general law, of the terms of a composition or arrangement between a
> debtor and his creditors is a matter of policy. There are, plainly,
> arguments of policy which point towards exclusion; in particular, that it is
> in the interest of the debtor and his other creditors that a creditor should
> not be dissuaded from voting in favour of a voluntary arrangement out of
> concern that he will lose his rights against co-debtors and sureties. But,
> equally, there are arguments which point towards allowing the general law to
> have effect; in particular, that it is in the interests of the debtor that
> he should be able to propose a scheme under which he will obtain a complete
> release from his liabilities, including the rights of contribution of co-
> debtors. It is also in the interests of other creditors, bound by the
> scheme, that it should not be frustrated by action by a co-debtor (not so
> bound) in enforcing rights of contribution._

  
  
I agree fully with that view. I have the advantage of being able to consider
the matter without being bound by any decisions on s 210 and its effect on
schemes of arrangements and existing guarantees. I considered the Australian
and English decisions referred to, and treated them as persuasive authority.  
  
In my view s 210(3) should be given its plain meaning, ie that an approved
arrangement binds all the creditors. It cannot matter that an objecting
creditor has not consented to be bound because he is nevertheless bound by the
operation of law. I do not see any reason why the arrangement has to have his
support for the provision to take effect and for the arrangement to bind him.  
  
I do not agree that an arrangement cannot discharge the liability of a party
who is not a party to it. That view ignores the commercial framework of such
arrangements. It is not unusual for the creditors of a company to hold
guarantees from the major shareholders and directors of the company. It is not
uncommon for these shareholders and directors to be the main players in
seeking an arrangement with the creditors by offering their own assets in
satisfaction of the debts owed by the company in return for the release of
their guarantees. In such situation the creditors cannot be permitted to take
the benefits offered by the arrangement and also retain the benefit of the
guarantees.  
  
The better policy is to allow the release of guarantors when that has been
expressly provided for, than to refuse it. It should be remembered that a
scheme of arrangement must have the support of the majority of the creditors
and approved by court before it takes effect. After a scheme is accepted by
the creditors, an objecting creditor can persuade the court to withhold its
approval, or to approve it subject to such alternatives or conditions as it
thinks fit (see s 210(4)). The objecting creditor would succeed if he can show
that the creditors did not vote bona fide for the benefit of the creditors or
the company as a whole (see **Re Wedgwood Coal and Iron Co** [1877] 6 Ch D
627), or that the scheme is not fair and reasonable (see **Re Dorman, Long &
Co** [1934] Ch 635). I find it difficult to agree that as a matter of policy
or principle an arrangement cannot be allowed to release guarantors,
regardless of its terms.  
  
Reverting to the present case, Daewoo`s objection was purely on a point of
law. No argument was made that the other creditors had not voted in good
faith, or that the scheme was unfair or unreasonable towards Daewoo. The case
was simply that the Daewoo guarantee cannot be released because Daewoo had not
agreed to it.  
  
Daewoo failed to make out a case for the court`s approval to be withheld or
that the approval be subject to the preservation of the guarantee.
Consequently, the scheme was approved.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application allowed.
