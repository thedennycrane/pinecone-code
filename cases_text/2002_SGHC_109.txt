_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_**

**__**Introduction**_

1\. Overseas Union Insurance Limited (‘OUI’) is the Plaintiff in DC Suit No
51197 of 1999. It is an insurance company incorporated in Singapore and at all
material times was engaged in business as general insurers and reinsurers.

2\. Home And Overseas Insurance Company Limited (‘Home’) is the Defendant. It
is an insurance company incorporated in the United Kingdom and is engaged also
in business as general insurers and reinsurers.

3\. Between 1980 and 1984, OUI entered into various insurance and/or
reinsurance contracts with C.J. Warrilow (‘CJW’) Syndicate No 553. One of
these contracts was NM 8100270 dated 18 August 1981 and was for Excess of Loss
(or ‘XOL’) Reinsurance in respect of So-Called ‘Casualty Account’ (‘the XOL
contract’). OUI’s liability under this contract was in turn reinsured with or
retroceded to Home (‘the Retrocession contract’).

4\. Although para 4 of OUI’s Statement of Claim stated that part of the risk
in the XOL contract was retroceded to Home, it was common ground that 100% of
the risk was retroceded to Home subject to a qualification from Andrew Tang
Ming Leung (PW1) at NE 41 which is not important for present purposes.

5\. From 1984, OUI suffered losses and began to run-off its XOL reinsurance
business.

6\. In 1995, OUI commenced negotiations with CJW to commute all reinsurance
claims under various contracts between them and on or about 5 December 1995, a
commutation agreement was achieved in respect of ten such contracts. Under the
commutation agreement, OUI was to pay CJW US$625,650 and OUI would be released
from all claims by CJW.

7\. Pursuant to this commutation agreement and OUI’s payment to CJW, OUI then
sought payment of US$74,773 from Home under OUI’s contract with Home. The
US$74,773 was derived purely from a mathematical formula of apportionment used
by OUI.

8\. Home disclaimed liability on the basis that the sum claimed represented
loss in respect of which liability had not attached yet and for which the loss
had not crystallised and that it was not liable to indemnify OUI for Home’s
share of the aggregate commutation sum ‘as such sums do not fall within the
risks covered’ by the Retrocession contract or the XOL contract. Home also
said it did not participate in the commutation negotiations.

9\. OUI’s claim was dismissed by the District Court after trial. OUI then
appealed to the High Court.

_**  
Basis of OUI’s claim**_

10\. Before the trial judge Mr Zainol Abeedin Bin Hussin and before me, OUI
had sought to rely on Article XVIII of the XOL contract to bind Home to the
commutation agreement OUI had reached with CJW. Article XVIII states:

‘ _ARTICLE XVIII_

> _NOTICE OF LOSS CLAUSE_
>
> All loss settlements made by the Reinsured, including compromise
> settlements, shall be unconditionally binding upon Reinsurers provided such
> settlement are within the conditions of the original policies and/or
> contracts (other than as provided for in Article V hereof) and within the
> terms of this reinsurance, and amounts falling to the share of the
> Reinsurers shall be payable by them upon reasonable evidence of the amount
> paid being given by the Reinsured.
>
> In the event of a claim arising hereunder notice shall be given to the
> Reinsurers through Butcher, Robinson and Staples Limited, London House, 6
> London Street, London EC3R 7LQ, as soon as practicable, and all papers in
> connection therewith shall be at the command of the Reinsurers on this
> reinsurance or parties designated by them for inspection.’

  
_**Trial Judge’s Reasons**_

11\. The trial judge decided that OUI was not entitled to rely on Article
XVIII of the XOL contract because Article XVIII was not pleaded. In any event,
Article XVIII did not apply to a commutation agreement.

  
_**Whether OUI might take the position that Article XVIII was applicable**_

12\. OUI had a number of difficulties in seeking to establish that Article
XVIII was applicable.

13\. First, in para 4 of its Statement of Claim, it pleaded that the terms of
the Retrocession contract were set out in the reinsurance slip executed by OUI
and acknowledged by Butcher Robinson & Staples Ltd (‘BRS’) for and on behalf
of Home. This plea was repeated in para 2 of its Reply which stated that the
Retrocession contract ‘was contained and/or (sic) in a evidenced by and/or to
be inferred from the slip issued by’ BRS.

14\. The reinsurance slip referred to by OUI is dated 24 March 1981. It does
not contain or refer specifically to the XOL contract, let alone Article XVIII
thereof. OUI sought to rely on the sentence, ‘All other terms and conditions
as Original’ in the reinsurance slip to incorporate Article XVIII of the XOL
contract. I will refer to this as ‘the Sentence’.

15\. However, it had not pleaded that Article XVIII of the XOL contract had
been incorporated by the Sentence.

16\. Mr Liew Teck Huat, for OUI, sought to avoid this obstacle by relying on a
number of cases.

17\. In The Geo W McKnight [1947] 80 Lloyd’s Rep 419, Lord Normand said, at p
423 to 424:

> ‘Counsel for Geo W McKnight naturally founded on this evidence and on the
> rule that a party is not to be allowed to contradict his preliminary act.
> Yet the court is not bound by the pleadings of parties and must proceed upon
> the evidence which it deems to be most accurate and trustworthy, and Mr
> Justice Pilcher has found that there is no evidence more accurate and
> trustworthy than the letter written by the master of the Geo W McKnight to
> her owners…’  
>  [Emphasis added.]

18\. This passage was cited with approval by K S Rajah JC in Thai Kenaf Co Ltd
v Keck Seng (S) Pte Ltd [1993] 1 SLR 92 at p 105.

19\. Mr Liew also relied on K.E.P. Mohamed Ali v K.E.P. Mohamed Ismail [1981]
2 MLJ 10. In that case, Rajah Azlan Shah CJ said, at p 11 and 12:

> ‘…. Since the material facts and circumstances were not pleaded in the
> statement of claim, it should have been pleaded in the reply. Be that as it
> may, this aspect of the case has been satisfactorily presented and developed
> in the proceedings before the High Court and we think there are materials on
> the record from which a decision to that effect could be arrived at. As one
> of the objects of modern pleadings is to prevent surprise, we cannot for one
> moment think that the defendant was taken by surprise. To condemn a party on
> a ground of which no material facts have been pleaded may be as great a
> denial of justice as to condemn him on a ground on which his evidence has
> been improperly excluded.’

20\. Mr P Jeya Putra, Counsel for Home, in turn cited The Ohm Mariana [1993] 2
SLR 698. In that case, L P Thean J, delivering the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, said at p 714 to 715:

> ‘There is yet another objection to the finding made by the learned judicial
> commissioner. On the pleadings no issue was raised whether the management
> agreement had been tampered with or fabricated and also no issue was raised
> as to malice in the arrest of the vessel based on the tampering or
> fabrication of the management agreement. The learned judicial commissioner,
> as stated above, found malice on the ground that the appellants had
> fabricated the first four pages of the management agreement.

> The issue of the authenticity of the management agreement produced by the
> appellants had been raised in the trial, but that was in the context of the
> case that had been pleaded, ie the claim for reimbursement of the expenses
> and the counterclaim for an account. The allegation of wrongful arrest was
> made on the basis that there was no sum due to the appellants. The issue of
> malice in the arrest was never raised, either in the pleadings or in
> evidence. In finding that the appellants had fabricated the management
> agreement in order to sustain the arrest, the learned judicial commissioner
> had decided an issue not raised in the pleadings. Under O 18 r 12(1) of the
> Rules of the Supreme Court particulars of fraud and malice relied upon by a
> party are required to be specifically pleaded.

> In Blay v Pollard and Morris, the trial judge decided the case on issues not
> raised in the pleadings and on appeal the Court of Appeal held that he was
> not entitled to do that. Scrutton LJ said, at p 534:

> > … Cases must be decided on the issues on the record; and if it is desired
> to raise other issues they must be placed on the record by amendment. In the
> present case the issue on which the judge decided was raised by himself
> without amending the pleadings, and in my opinion he was not entitled to
> take such a course.

> In Kiaw Aik Hang Co Ltd v Tan Tien Choy, this court held that the trial
> judge had decided on issues not raised in the pleadings and ordered a new
> trial. Buttrose J in his judgement (with whom Wee Chong Jin CJ and Tan Ah
> Tah J concurred) said, at p 101:

> > While one can appreciate the dilemma in which the learned trial judge
> found himself as the result of his findings he has, with the greatest
> respect, in my opinion, decided the case on issues not raised by the
> pleadings and against the admissions contained in them and the evidence.
>>

>> The case, in my view, must be decided on issues raised by the pleadings
which bind the parties. If other issues are desired to be raised or come to
light during the trial they must be pleaded by way of amendment.

>>

>> For these reasons alone, in my judgment, this decision cannot be allowed to
stand and in the circumstances of this case I have come to the conclusion that
in order to do justice between the parties a new trial must be ordered.

> More recently, Lord Edmund-Davis in Farrell v Secretary of State, at p 180
> said:

> > … pleadings continue to play an essential part in civil actions, and
> although there has been since the Civil Procedure Act 1833 a wide power to
> permit amendments, circumstances may arise when the grant of permission
> would work injustice or, at least, necessitate an adjournment which may
> prove particularly unfortunate in trials with a jury. To shrug off a
> criticism as ‘a mere pleading point’ is therefore bad law and bad practice.
> For the primary purpose of pleadings remains, and it can still prove of
> vital importance. That purpose is to define the issues and thereby to inform
> the parties in advance of the case they have to meet and so enable them to
> take steps to deal with it.’

21\. Mr Jeya also relied on an unreported judgment in 2001 by Judith Prakash J
in Leefon Corporation (Pte) Ltd v Stone Tec Material Supplies Pte Ltd, DCA No
600003 of 2001. She said, at para 47:

> ‘47. Whilst I have pointed out the deficiencies in Stone Tec’s evidence, the
> basic problem with their counterclaim was that it was not properly pleaded.
> As every litigation lawyer should know, what you do not plead you cannot
> prove and thus cannot successfully claim.’

22\. In my view, the general rule is that a party is bound by his pleadings
even if evidence has been given in a trial which touches on a matter which is
not pleaded. If he wishes to rely on the matter raised in the trial, then he
has to amend his pleadings. Moreover, according to paragraph 8 of the Grounds
of Decision of the trial judge, the Opening Statement for Home had highlighted
that the relevant provision in the XOL contract had not been pleaded by OUI.
Yet, OUI still did not apply to amend its Statement of Claim or Reply.
Accordingly, I am of the view that it was not open to OUI to take the position
that Article XVIII was applicable.

23\. Secondly, para 3 of OUI’s Reply stated that OUI had concluded a
commutation with CJW and as such ‘all outstanding losses between [OUI and CJW]
became crystallised and the underlying reinsurance contract itself ceased to
have any further effect’ [emphasis added]. Mr Jeya submitted that this meant
that OUI could not rely on Article XVIII of the XOL contract as it was the
underlying reinsurance contract.

24\. Mr Liew’s position was that ‘ceased to have any effect’ did not mean that
the XOL contract had been thrown out but that all liabilities of OUI under it
had been extinguished.

25\. While I accept that para 3 of OUI’s Reply could be read to mean what Mr
Liew had advocated, the question is whether that was the correct
interpretation.

26\. I note that para 3 of OUI’s Reply was to deny para 6 of Home’s Defence
which asserted, inter alia, that the losses which were commuted did not fall
within the risks covered by the Retrocession contract or the XOL contract.

27\. Bearing that in mind and the words used in para 3 of OUI’s Reply, I am of
the view that para 3 was intended to assert and did assert that the XOL
contract was no longer applicable. In my view, such a position is not correct
in law. Just because no further claim can be made against OUI under the XOL
contract does not mean that all the contractual terms under the XOL contract
cease to have effect. However, that was the position that OUI had adopted and
it was too late for Mr Liew to try and advocate the correct position through
submission especially since the incorporation or application of Article XVIII
was not specifically mentioned anywhere else in OUI’s pleadings.

28\. Thirdly, the Sentence (in the reinsurance slip) cannot possibly
incorporate Article XVIII of the XOL contract because the latter was not in
existence as at the date of the reinsurance slip. The XOL contract is dated 18
August 1981 whereas the insurance slip is dated 24 March 1981.

29\. Fourthly, the reinsurance slip was not the correct document to be
construed as it had been replaced by the policy of reinsurance dated 14
September 1981. In Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v Turegum Insurance Co [2001]
3 SLR 330, Judith Prakash J provided a very useful account as to how such
contracts come about. She said, at p 350 to 351:

> ‘THE BACKGROUND
>
> 69 There are four reinsurance contracts which are now in issue between OUI
> and Turegum. ….
>
> 70 Before I go on to discuss the issues relating to these contracts, it
> would be helpful to give a brief account of how such contracts usually come
> about. An insurance contract placed in the London market is initiated when
> an insurance broker presents a proposal for insurance or reinsurance to
> underwriters at Lloyds or to insurance companies. The procedure is described
> by Lord Diplock in American Airlines Inc v Hope [1974] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 301 at
> 304-305. What happens is that the broker acting for the assured prepares the
> slip (a folded card) and indicates in brief terms the cover the assured
> requires. Thereafter, as Lord Diplock says:

> > … He takes the slip … to an underwriter whom he has selected to deal with
> as leading underwriter, i.e., one who has a reputation in the market as an
> expert in the kind of cover required and whose lead is likely to be followed
> by other insurers in the market. If it is the first contract of insurance
> covering that risk in which a particular underwriter has acted as leading
> underwriter it is treated as an original insurance. The broker and the
> leading underwriter go through the slip together. They agree on any
> amendments to the broker’s draft and fix the premium. When agreement has
> been reached the leading underwriter initials the slip for his proportion of
> the cover and the broker then takes the initialled slip round the market to
> other insurers who initial it for such proportion of the cover as each is
> willing to accept. For practical purposes, all the negotiations about the
> terms of the insurance and the rate of premium are carried on between the
> broker and the leading underwriter alone …

> > …

> > After the slip has been initialled by all the insurers it is retained by
> the broker. In due course, often after several months, he prepares the
> policy from the slip. In the case of an original insurance he generally
> agrees the wording of the policy with the leading underwriter before taking
> it to Lloyd’s Policy Signing Office for signature.

> 71 When the slip is signed, it constitutes a binding contract. At that
> stage, the whole of the contract is found in the slip. It has been described
> as ‘free-standing’. See Insurance Co of the State of Pennsylvania v Grand
> Union Insurance Co [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 208 and The Zephyr [1984] 1 Lloyd’s
> Rep 58. OUI relies on these principles in relation to the two slips (for
> contracts 3TD70 and 3TG71) which it has in its possession and argues that
> since these slips do not contain arbitration clauses or any reference to any
> arbitration clause in any other document, the contracts of insurance do not
> contain any agreement to submit disputes to arbitration.

> 72 The slip is usually only the first stage in the process. Following its

> the terms of that contract when the slip is lost.
>

> (see 10.5.1.3). This statement was based on the holding in Youell v Bland
> Welch & Co [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 423 (HC); [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 127 (CA)
> which discussed the ranking of the slip versus the wording and ruled that if
> formal wording was subsequently issued, the slip would be inadmissible as an
> aid to construction of the policy. The judge at first instance, Philips J,
> also stated (at p 429):

> > An insurance slip customarily sets out a shorthand version of the contract

> here, the slip provides for the formal wording to be agreed by the leading

> of the slip and that of the formal contract which is embodied in the policy
> give rise to the possibility that the natural meaning of the slip differs
> from that of the policy, the natural assumption is and should be that the
> wording of the policy has been designed the better to reflect the agreement
> between the parties. To refer to the slip as an aid to construction of the
> policy runs counter to one of the objects of replacing the slip with the
> policy.’

30\. I would add that on the facts before me, the cover note appears to have
been issued before the slip but that is not material as the policy of
reinsurance was issued after the slip.

31\. As for the policy of reinsurance, it is true that it has, under the Other
Conditions, the words ‘All other terms and Conditions as Original, as far as
applicable’. In another page, there is also the sentence, ‘This Reinsurance is
subject to the same terms and conditions as the original contract as far as
they may be applicable hereto ….’. However, the Statement of Claim and the
Reply did not assert that the policy of reinsurance was the contract.
Accordingly, it was not open to OUI to rely on the policy of reinsurance to
incorporate Article XVIII.

32\. A fifth obstacle faced by OUI is that when Home applied for a stay of
proceedings in reliance on an arbitration provision in the XOL contract, i.e
Article XXI, OUI took the position that Article XXI did not apply because OUI
had only sighted the retrocession slip and it was only the slip which
evidenced the contract between OUI and Home. Accordingly, although Home
succeeded in its application at first instance, OUI’s appeal to resist the
stay was successful. In the light of this, I am of the view that OUI cannot
approbate and reprobate. It was too late for OUI to say that the rest of the
XOL contract, except Article XXI, applies.

33\. A sixth obstacle faced by OUI was that it did not produce the original of
the XOL contract despite repeated requests for it during discovery. I am of
the view that this omission would also preclude it from raising Article XVIII
of the XOL contract.

34\. A seventh obstacle faced by OUI was an argument raised by Mr Jeya. He
said that there was an Ultimate Net Loss clause in the policy of reinsurance
and that this was different from and inconsistent with the Notice of Loss
clause that is Article XVIII. Accordingly the two cannot apply together.

35\. On the other hand, Mr Liew pointed out that Article XVIII was not
necessarily inconsistent with an Ultimate Net Loss clause because even in the
XOL contract, there was an Ultimate Net Loss clause. This was Article VII of
the XOL contract. Accordingly, Article XVIII could co-exist with an Ultimate
Net Loss provision. I agree with this argument of Mr Liew.

36\. However, in the light of the other obstacles, I am of the view that the
trial judge was correct in concluding that OUI was not entitled to take the
position that Article XVIII was applicable.

  
_**Meaning of ‘as Original’ or ‘as Original, as far as applicable’ etc.**_

37\. The Sentence (in the retrocession slip) has the words ‘as Original’. The
policy of insurance has the words ‘as Original, as far as applicable’ and ‘as
the original contract as far as they may be applicable hereto …’.

38\. One question was whether the Sentence or the words in the policy of
reinsurance would be sufficient to incorporate Article XVIII of the XOL
contract, leaving aside for the time being the obstacles I have mentioned.

39\. Mr Jeya submitted that such words would not have incorporated Article
XVIII on the authority of Pine Top Insurance Co Ltd [1987] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 476.
In that case, the words were ‘All terms clauses and conditions as original’.
Gatehouse J said, at p 480, that such words were used to ensure that ‘the risk
undertaken by reinsurers was identical, as to period, geographical limits and
nature of the risk, with the risk undertaken by the primary insurers. They
therefore used this catch-all phrase, even though it was repetitive, and
therefore strictly unnecessary’. Accordingly he concluded that such words did
not incorporate an arbitration clause which was found in the second layer of
documents i.e between Home and the reinsurers in that case but not found in
the contract between the reinsurer defendants and the retrocessionaire
plaintiffs.

40\. Apparently this question is not a new one. The ambiguity which arises
from the use of such words was already raised in Reinsurance Practice and The
Law 1993 by the Reinsurance Division of Barlow, Lyde and Gilbert at paras
10.6.1 to 10.6.1.6.

41\. However, in the light of the obstacles I have mentioned above and the
rest of my judgment below, it is not necessary for me to decide whether I
agree with Gatehouse J’s conclusion and, if so, whether it should be confined
to the facts in that case.

  
**_If Article XVIII was applicable, was the commutation agreement binding on
Home?_**

42\. Assuming that Article XVIII had been incorporated into the Retrocession
contract, the question then was whether the commutation agreement was binding
on Home. I set out again, for convenience, the first limb of the first
paragraph of Article XVIII:

> ‘All loss settlements made by the Reinsured, including compromise
> settlements, shall be unconditionally binding upon Reinsurers’  
>  [Emphasis added]

43\. Mr Liew submitted that the commutation agreement was based only on Known
Outstanding Losses (‘KOL’) which were in turn based on an actuarial report.
Accordingly, it was not based on claims which had been incurred but not
reported (‘IBNR’). He also submitted that commutation agreements were common.
Hence Article XVIII should be construed as binding Home to pay on the
commutation agreement.

44\. Mr Jeya submitted that the actuarial report was prepared for CJW and not
for Home. While he accepted that the claims which were settled under the
commutation agreement did not include IBNR claims, he submitted that KOL
claims were fluctuating. He relied on the evidence of Andrew Tang (PW1) at NE
36 where Mr Tang said that such claims have already been notified but have not
been settled or quantified due to pending litigation or settlement. The KOL
figure could increase or decrease.

45\. Mr Jeya also referred to two textbooks. The first was Reinsurance
Practice and The Law 1993 by The Reinsurance Division of Barlow, Lyde and
Gilbert. At p 22-6, it states:

‘ 22.5 COMMUTATIONS

> We have mentioned already that one of the business objectives of reinsurance
> companies which are in run-offs is to try and reduce administrative costs to
> the minimum by cutting their claims handling costs. This objective can be
> achieved by commuting as many inwards contracts as possible with reinsureds.
> A commutation is an arrangement between a reinsurer and a reinsured under
> which in consideration of the payment of an amount by the reinsurerer to the
> reinsured the latter releases the former from future ongoing liabilities
> under the reinsurance policy.’  
>  [Emphasis added.]

46\. At p 22-9 and 22-10, it states:

‘ 22.6 RETROCESSIONS

> It has already been mentioned that an important consideration before a
> reinsurer enters into a commutation agreement is to evaluate the effect of
> the proposed agreement upon its retrocessional collections. Most
> retrocession agreements will contain either a "follow the settlements" or a
> "follow the fortunes" clause. Under English law, a retrocessionaire will
> usually be bound to indemnify a reinsurer in respect of a commutation agreed
> by the reinsurer under a contract containing one of the above clauses
> provided:

> > (a) the losses fall within the risks covered by the retrocession
> agreement; and
>>

>> (b) the reinsurer commuted or settled the reinsurance contract honestly and
in a businesslike fashion taking reasonable steps to ascertain the amount of
the reinsured’s loss.

> 22.6.1 The first condition raises a different legal question in connection
> with commutations which include a compromise settlement in respect of
> outstanding and IBNR claims. The retrocessionaire may argue that the
> settlement of such claims is not recoverable under the retrocession contract
> because it is not a loss settlement because such claims have been
> artificially quantified by virtue of the commutation. Although there has, at
> present, been no court decision which has given authoritative guidance about
> this question, some assistance can be gleaned from the recent case of In Re
> a Company No. 0013734 of 1991 [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 415. The case arose from
> an application by an unidentified insurance/reinsurance company ("the
> Company") to strike out a winding-up petition which was presented by
> Cambridge Re (which is now in liquidation, having been ordered to be wound
> up in Bermuda in May 1985). One of the principal difficulties faced by
> liquidators of insurance or reinsurance companies is that the winding-up of
> such companies can take many years because of the need to run off the
> portfolio of business written by the insolvent company. In a novel and
> imaginative response to this problem, the liquidators of Cambridge Re
> applied to the Bermudan court to obtain its approval to actuarial valuations
> of contingent claims and claims of uncertain value. These actuarial
> valuations were approved by the court. The Company submitted that the order
> of the Bermudan court was not binding on it as it valuations were not "loss
> settlements" under the reinsurance agreements concerned.

> The judge commented on this issue in the following terms: "… I have
> considerable sympathy with the liquidators. Their argument has the undoubted
> merit of good common sense and is in keeping with the view of Stirling and
> Hirst JJ" (i.e., the case of Eddystone Marine and Mentor v. Home and

> which might affect the insurance and reinsurance market.  
>  [Emphasis added.]

47\. The second textbook referred to by Mr Jeya was The Law of Reinsurance in
England and Bermuda by P T O’Neill and J.W. Woloniecki, 1998. It states at p
163 to 164:

> ‘Commutations
>
> Under commutation agreements an insurer/reinsurer will typically obtain a
> release from the insured/reinsured in respect of all present and future
> liability, whether known or unknown at the date of the commutation in
> consideration for a single payment. The recovery from
> reinsurers/retrocessionaires in respect of such a commutation payment may be
> problematic. To the extent that the commutation represents a bona fide
> compromise of known claims for which there is arguably coverage under the
> insurance/reinsurance contracts which are the subject of the commutation, in
> principle reinsurers/retrocessionaires will be bound. However, commutations
> typically do not apportion the amount payable between particular claims made
> or between claims made and claims outstanding, or between claims outstanding

48\. It seems to me that both textbooks suggest that if the commutation
agreement does not include IBNR claims, then it should bind the
retrocessionaire if there is a ‘follow the settlement’ clause, leaving aside
for the time being questions as to whether the claim is within the reinsurance
policy and whether the reinsurer acted honestly and in a businesslike fashion.
However if IBNR claims are included, then the commutation agreement is not
binding.

49\. However, no case-law authority was cited in The Reinsurance Practice and
The Law 1993 for these propositions. Also, in The Law of Reinsurance in
England and Bermuda, the cases which were cited in the footnotes were not on
point.

50\. According to Mr Jeya, there is no English or local decision so far on the
point.

51\. In my view, the compromise settlements referred to in Article XVIII must
be in the nature of loss settlements even though the first limb of the first
paragraph of Article XVIII may be interpreted in one of two ways.

52\. The first interpretation is that ‘compromise settlements’ refers to a
settlement of a loss by way of compromise whereas ‘loss settlements’ refers to
a settlement of a loss which is not by way of a compromise.

53\. The second interpretation is that ‘loss settlements’ refers to a
settlement of a loss whether by way of compromise or not and it is unnecessary
to state that it includes ‘compromise settlements’, although the inclusion is
to avoid any doubt that ‘loss settlements’ includes compromises.

54\. In either interpretation, ‘compromise settlements’ must also be in the
nature of loss settlements. The question then is whether ‘loss settlements’
would include commutation agreements.

55\. No expert evidence was given for OUI. The expert witness for Home was Mr
Kenneth Vivian Louw (PW3). He was the Managing Director of Reinsurance
Evaluations Ltd, a reinsurance consultancy specialising, among other things,
in giving expert advice to the London reinsurance market. His evidence was
that a commutation agreement is a separate agreement from the reinsurance
agreement (NE 131). It is not a loss settlement but an agreement to terminate
a contract (NE 133).

56\. I am of the view that a loss settlement is one where a loss is being
settled whether by a court order or an arbitration award or via a compromise.
The nature of a commutation agreement is different. While, in a sense, it does
include the settlement of losses, the reasons for settlement are quite
different because the reinsurer has another priority besides merely settling
the losses. The reinsurer wishes to run-off its business or, as Mr Louw put
it, to terminate its contract. It is a separate agreement over and above a
reinsurance contract whereas a loss settlement on which the reinsurer seeks
payment by a retrocessionaire comes under the reinsurance contract.

57\. The nature of a commutation agreement is to release the reinsurer from
future ongoing liabilities under the reinsurance contract (see again p 22-6 of
Reinsurance Practice and The Law 1993 cited above). I am of the view that
whether it includes IBNR or not, the nature of a commutation agreement remains
the same. Accordingly a reinsurer like OUI may well be prepared to pay a
premium over and above what it would otherwise have agreed to in the usual
settlement of a loss.

58\. If the reinsurer takes the position that it did not take into account any
consideration other than the settlement of a loss, then it should make its
claim against the retrocessionaire not on the basis of a commutation agreement
but on the basis that it had settled a loss. However, this will be easier said
than done because, as in the present case before me, the ‘losses’ which were
settled included claims for which the amounts to be paid by CJW were still
uncertain as at the date of the commutation agreement.

59\. While I sympathise with a reinsurer who wishes to enter into a
commutation agreement, I am of the view that if it had wished to bind the
retrocessionaire by such an agreement, it should have provided for such an
eventuality in the retrocessionaire contract in the first place. After all,
commutation agreements are supposed to be not that uncommon. If it cannot
obtain the retrocessionaire’s agreement at the time the retrocession contract
is entered into, then it should involve the retrocessionaire in its
negotiations with the insurer for a commutation agreement and try and obtain
the retrocessionaire’s agreement. Thus, The Law of Reinsurance in England and
Bermuda states, at p 685:

> ‘A commutation between a reinsurer and his reinsured may well involve the
> reinsurer’s retrocessionaire. We have discussed above commutations in the
> context of "follow the settlements" clauses and the problem of allocation.
> The only practical solution to the legal difficulties which a reinsurer who
> commutes inwards reinsurance will face in collecting under outwards
> reinsurance is to involve his outwards reinsurers in the commutation
> discussions and persuade his outwards reinsurers to pay an appropriate
> amount to be released from liability to reflect the release which he has
> negotiated under the inwards contracts.

60\. It is common ground that OUI did not involve Home in its negotiations for
the commutation agreement. I am mindful that where there are several
retrocessionaires, it may be very difficult to include all of them in the
negotiations. However that is a difficulty a reinsurer must face and not
ignore.

61\. As the commutation agreement is at the behest of the reinsurer or at
least to serve its own purpose, the reinsurer cannot impose such an agreement
on the retrocessionaire unilaterally. It may well be that the industry should
come up with a dispute resolution mechanism if retrocessionaires refuse to be
bound by commutation agreements. However, that is another matter.

62\. There is another assertion. In paragraph 5 of its Reply, OUI also alleged
that it was market practice that a commutation agreement entered into by a
reinsurer with a reinsured would be binding on the retrocessionaire. However
OUI produced no evidence of such a market practice whereas Home’s witness Mr
Louw denied such a practice.

63\. As regards Mr Liew’s argument that the commutation agreement is binding
on Home because the policy of reinsurance is a contract of indemnity, even
though it does not say so explicitly, I am of the view that the question is
not so much whether it is a contract of indemnity but what it purports to
indemnify OUI for. For the reasons I have given, it does not indemnify OUI
against OUI’s liability under the commutation agreement.

64\. In the circumstances, I am of the view that even if Article XVIII
applied, Home was not bound by the commutation agreement.

  
_**If Article XVIII was applicable, must OUI establish that the claims which
were settled with CJW were within the terms of the XOL contract and the
Retrocession contract?**_

65\. Mr Jeya submitted that even if Article XVIII is applicable, OUI must
still establish that the claims which it settled with CJW fall under the XOL
contract and the Retrocession contract in view of the provisos to the first
paragraph of Article XVIII which state, ‘… provided such settlement are within
the conditions of the original policies and/or contracts … and within the
terms of this reinsurance ….’

66\. On the other hand, Mr Liew submitted that so long as there was a
settlement of the claims, the burden was on Home to establish that the claims
did not fall under these two contracts. Mr Liew relied on three cases which I
shall now come to.

67\. In The Insurance Co of Africa v Scor (U.K.) Reinsurance Co Ltd [1985] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 312 (‘Scor’), the plaintiffs issued a fire insurance policy. The
policy was issued in respect of a building called the Old Customs Building in
Monrovia, Liberia. On 7 February 1982, the building was totally destroyed by
fire, together with its contents. African Trading Co (Liberia) Ltd (‘ATC’) was
in possession of the building as lessees. ATC made a claim on the policy
against the insurers who failed to pay. ATC then sued the insurers and
obtained judgment against the insurers in Liberia. The insurers appealed but
abandoned their appeal. They then paid ATC and claimed against the defendants
who were the lead reinsurers. In the policy of reinsurance, there was a
‘follow settlements’ clause which provided:

> ‘Being a Reinsurance of and warranted same … terms and conditions as and to
> follow the settlements of the Insurance Company of Africa.’

68\. The reinsurers refused to pay because they alleged that the fire was
deliberately caused by a Mr Ali. He was described as ‘in effect the sole
proprietor of ATC’.

69\. There were several issues, one of which concerned the interpretation of
the ‘follow settlements’ clause. Three interpretations were suggested by
counsel for the insurers. I cite from p 554 of the law report:

> ‘Upon Mr. Hunter’s [the insurers’ Counsel] helpful analysis of this clause
> it may be interpreted or applied in one of three possible ways. (1) In the
> absence of lack of good faith or collusion by the ceding company the
> reinsurers are bound to follow the settlement of the ceding company; (2) the
> reinsurers are bound to follow any settlement of the ceding company unless
> the reinsurers can show lack of good faith or collusion or failure on the
> part of the ceding company to take all proper and business-like steps to
> have the amount of the loss fairly and carefully ascertained; or (3) the
> reinsurers are bound to follow any settlement of the ceding company unless
> they can show lack of good faith or collusion or failure by the ceding
> company carefully and fairly to ascertain the loss.’

70\. Apparently, the dispute was whether the insurers’ duty was as set out in
the third interpretation or the second interpretation and Counsel for the
disputing parties appeared to have proceeded on the basis that the onus was on
the reinsurers to establish that the insurers had failed to carry out their
duty.

71\. Furthermore, while Leggatt J and Stephenson LJ did express the view that
the onus was on the reinsurers, Robert Goff LJ did not say so explicitly. The
oft cited passages from Goff LJ’s judgment bear this out, see p 330:

> ‘… The intention must, in my judgment, have been to bind insurers to follow
> settlements, even where the effect was that they could not dispute that
> there was in fact liability on the insurers under their policy with the
> assured.
>
> In my judgment, the effect of a clause binding reinsurers to follow

> falls within the risks covered by the policy of reinsurance as a matter of

> rights of subrogation, arising upon payment of the claim under the policy of
> reinsurance, in order to seek to rescind the settlement with the assured and
> to recover the money paid by the insurers under that settlement.’

72\. The above points about Scor are neatly summarised by Hunter JA of the
Hong Kong Court of Appeal in Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania v
Grand Union Insurance Co and Lowndes Lambert Construction Ltd [1990] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 208 (‘ICSP v Grand Union’). At p 223 to 224, Hunter JA said:

> ‘The principal authority is again the case of Scor. At first instance,
> [1983] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 541, it is plain that Mr. Hunter, Counsel for the
> equivalent of the insurer, was then arguing that the onus lay upon the

73\. However, I accept that in ICSP v Grand Union, one of the issues under the
quantum issue was whether ICSP, the reinsurer, had to prove that certain
claims settled by them fell within the risks covered by the retrocessionaire.
The Hong Kong court of first instance and the Hong Kong Court of Appeal
decided that the onus was on Grand Union, the retrocessionaire, to prove that
the claims settled did not fall within the risks covered.

74\. In that case, the ‘follow settlements’ clause provided that the
reinsurance is subject in all respects to the same terms and conditions
excluding rate and retention as and to follow, the settlements of the
Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania and to bear its proportion of
any expenses incurred whether legal or otherwise in the investigation and
defence of any claim thereunder.

75\. I have already cited a part of the judgment of Hunter JA of the Hong Kong
Court of Appeal. I now cite from the judgment of Justice Martimer in the court
of first instance where, after referring to the ‘follow settlements’ clause,
as well as a simultaneous payment clause, he said (at p 210):

> ‘The aims of such conditions are these. (1) To avoid the expense of multiple
> claims enquiries by different insurers and reinsurers in the chain. (2) To
> simplify and hasten the claims procedures. (3) To reduce or avoid the
> possibility of disputes arising between reinsurers in the chain, and (4) to
> have an immediate flow of funds through the chain when a claim is agreed to
> be settled. If a reinsureer wishes to be involved in the claim procedure, he
> will require a claims co-operation clause to be inserted. Neither slip in
> this case has one. Whether a prudent underwriter asks for such a clause
> depends upon many factors and at one stage those factors were relevant to my
> consideration of this case. They are no longer relevant and I do not refer
> to the matter again.’

76\. At p 216, Justice Mortimes concludes:

> ‘As it effects this case the law is as follows: a reinsurer bound by the
> follow the settlement clause agrees to indemnify the insurer in
> circumstances in which the insurer agrees to compromise a claim by its
> insured whether on liability or quantum provided that [a] the claim falls
> within the risks covered by the policy of reinsurance and [b] in making the

77\. The third case relied upon by Mr Liew was John Robert Charman v Guardian
Royal Exchange Assurance Plc & another [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 607 (‘Charman’).
In that case, the ‘follow settlements’ clause read:

> ‘Subject to the same terms, conditions, definitions, warranties as … the
> original policy and to follow … insofar as applicable, including loss
> settlements, liable or not liable.’

78\. In dealing with the issue of onus of proof as the third issue in that
case, Webster J said, at p 612 to 614:

> ‘The third point of law is whether, as Mr. Sumption submits, the burden of
> proof lies upon a reinsurer to displace his reassured’s right to rely as
> against him upon the follow settlements clause.

79\. In my view, Charman does not help OUI. While Webster J did say that the
burden was on the reinsurer to prove lack of good faith or that the reinsured
did not act in a business-like fashion, he also said that it was for the
reinsured to prove that his claim against the reinsurer falls within the
reinsurance policy.

80\. I would also add that Home is not suggesting that OUI has to prove the
loss of the original assured but rather that the claim of the original assured
comes within the XOL contract and the Retrocession contract.

81\. I turn now to the two cases relied on by Mr Jeya to counter Mr Liew’s
authorities.

82\. The first is Hill v The Mercantile & General Reinsurance Co Plc [1996]
Lloyd’s Reinsurance LR 341 (‘Hill’).

83\. In that case, the ‘follow settlements’ clause stated:

> ‘All loss settlements by the Reassured including compromise settlements and
> the establishment of funds for the settlement of losses shall be binding
> upon the Reinsurers, providing such settlements are within the terms and
> conditions of the original policies and/or contracts … and within the terms
> and conditions of this Reinsurance.’

84\. Lord Mustill divided the clause as follows at p 347:

> ‘It is convenient once more to give the terms of the follow settlements
> clause, on this occasion dividing it into lettered paragraphs:

> > [a] All loss settlements by the Reassured including compromise settlements
> and the establishment of funds for the settlement of losses shall be binding
> upon the Reinsurers,

> > [b] providing such settlements are within the terms and conditions of the
> original policies and/or contracts
>>

>> [c] and within the terms and conditions of this Reinsurance.

> Paragraphs [b] and [c] of this clause have been called the first and second
> provisos.’

85\. After referring quite extensively to the judgment of Justice Rix (at
first instance) and Lord Justice Hirst (from the Court of Appeal), Lord
Mustill said, at p 350 to 351:

> ‘My Lords, these quotations, long as they are, do less than justice to the
> care taken by the Courts below to analyse the various forms of settlement
> clause, the decisions upon them, and the propositions of Lord Justice Robert
> Goff in the Scor case [1985] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 312. Acknowledging this, I shall

86\. It seems to me that the provisos in Article XVIII are similar to the
first and second provisos in Hill. These provisos were absent from the ‘follow
settlement’ provisions in the three cases which Mr Liew relied on. On the
other hand, I note that the judgment of Lord Mustill in Hill was in the
context of an application for summary judgment and the House of Lords decided
only that there was an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried
(see p 352 of the report).

87\. The second case relied on by Mr Jeya was Commercial Union Assurance Co
Plc v NGR Victory Reinsurance Ltd [1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 600 (‘NGR’). There the
‘follow settlements’ clause stated:

> ‘All loss settlements by the Re-assured including compromise settlements and
> the establishment of funds for the settlement of losses shall be binding
> upon the Re-insurers, providing such settlements are within the terms and
> conditions of the original policies and/or contracts … and within the terms
> and conditions of this Re-assurance’

88\. In NGR, Potter LJ said in the first column at p 612:

> ‘As to the decision of the insurers to settle in the light of Mr. Reasoner’s
> prediction, as Mr. Sumption in my view rightly submitted, it was not enough
> for the plaintiffs to establish that the settlement was business-like and
> sensible. They were required to demonstrate liability to Exxon, and could
> only be entitled to recover on some wider basis if they could show some kind
> of "follow settlements" clause binding the reinsurers to the plaintiffs’
> settlement. However, as already noted, of the 16 contracts making up the GCE
> policy, five contained no follow settlements clause at all and 11 contained
> clauses in substantially the same form as in Hill v. Mercantile. None bound
> the reinsurers to reasonable or business-like settlements regardless of the
> scope of the direct insurance. All provided that settlements should be
> binding upon the reinsurers only "providing such settlements are within the
> terms and conditions of the original policies and/or contracts".’

89\. In the second column at p 612, he also said:

> ‘… The matter did not proceed to judgment and payment was made pursuant to a
> settlement in which the insurers (no doubt for good and business-like
> reasons) decided that they would not submit the points available to them to
> the decision of the Court, but would rather reach a compromise. It is in
> just such a position, that the reinsurer, in response to the reinsured’s
> claim for indemnity has the right to require the reinsured to show that he
> was legally liable to the original assured, unless there is in the
> reinsurance contract an effective "follow the settlements" provision which
> precludes such right: see Insurance Co. of Africa v. Scor (U.K.) Reinsurance
> Co. Ltd., [1985] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 312.’

90\. However, in that case, it was common ground that the insurer must
establish that it was liable under its cover before succeeding in its claim
against the reinsurer (see page 605). The question there was whether the
insurer had discharged its burden. Furthermore NGR was also a case involving
an application for summary judgment and the Court of Appeal decided only that
the insurer was not entitled to such judgment.

91\. I would adopt the observations of Lord Mustill in Hill. It was and is
open to parties in the industry to provide who should have the burden of
proving any aspect of a claim. In my view, the provisos in the first paragraph
of Article XVIII, if applicable to the Retrocession contract mutatis mutandis,
require OUI to establish that the claim of the original insured was within the
original insurance policy and within the terms of the XOL contract and the
Retrocession contract. OUI did not attempt to establish this as its position
was that the burden was on Home to prove otherwise. Accordingly, this is
another reason why OUI’s claim must fail.

_**  
If Article XVIII applied, who had the burden of proof with regard to the
requirement to act bona fide and in a proper and businesslike manner?**_

92\. The three cases relied on by Mr Liew, which I have referred to above, are
authorities for the proposition that a reinsured who seeks to rely on a
‘follow settlements’ clause must nevertheless act in good faith and in a
businesslike manner. Furthermore, the burden of proof is on the reinsurer to
prove that the reinsured did not act in the manner required.

93\. I am of the view that even though the ‘follow settlements’ clause in
Article XVIII is differently worded from those in the three cases relied upon
by Mr Liew, there is nothing in Article XVIII or Hill or NGR which would
require or persuade me to reach a different conclusion. For the reasons
mentioned by Justice Mortimer and Hunter JA in ICPS v Grand Union, I am of the
view that the burden of proof would be on Home to establish that OUI had
failed to act in the manner required.

94\. However, the conduct of OUI would have to be examined in the light of its
attempting to reach a commutation agreement and not the usual settlement of a
claim. Accordingly, it is not meaningful for me to investigate whether Home
has discharged this burden especially in view of my other conclusions.

_**  
Notice provision in Article XVIII**_

95\. Mr Jeya submitted that even if Article XVIII applied, Home must still be
notified first before the commutation agreement was concluded. He did not
elaborate whether this argument was based on general principles or the Notice
of Loss Clause that is Article XVIII.

96\. In Home’s Case, i.e written submission, reliance seemed to be placed on
general principles. Halsbury’s Laws of England, Fourth Edition, Vol 20 at para
313 was cited for the proposition that Home is entitled to impugn the
commutation agreement if it was not notified of the negotiations leading to
such an agreement.

97\. I am of the view that while Home is not bound by the commutation
agreement, it does not follow that the omission by OUI to give notice to Home
of claims would necessarily mean that OUI is precluded from claiming payment
from Home, leaving aside any contractual provision requiring such notice to be
given.

98\. As regards a contractual provision, the second paragraph of Article XVIII
states:

> ‘In the event of a claim arising hereunder notice shall be given to the
> Reinsurers through Butcher, Robinson and Staples Limited, London House, 6
> London Street, London EC3R 7LQ, as soon as practicable, and all papers in
> connection therewith shall be at the command of the Reinsurers on this
> reinsurance or parties designated by them for inspection.’

99\. However, Mr Jeya did not draw my attention to any provision in Article
XVIII itself which spells out the consequence of a failure by OUI to give
notice of the claim to Home. Nor did he identify any such provision in the XOL
contract or in the policy of insurance. In the absence of any contractual
provision spelling out the consequence of a failure to give notice, I am
disinclined to conclude that such an omission would be fatal to OUI making a
claim.

_**  
Summary**_

100\. In summary, I dismiss the appeal with costs to be paid by OUI to
Home._****_
