**Judgment:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

**_

BACKGROUND  
  

_**1\. The Plaintiff Hendrawan Setiadi is an Indonesian businessman. He was a
client of the first defendant OCBC Securities Private Limited (OCBC
Securities), a stockbroking company incorporated in Singapore.**_

_** 2\. At all material times, the second defendant Ng Haw Hua was a dealers
representative and an associate director employed by OCBC Securities.**_

_** 3\. At all material times, the third defendant Tang Boon Hai was also a
dealers representative employed by OCBC Securities.**_

_** 4\. The additional background information below is based on Mr Setiadis
allegations.**_

_** 5\. Sometime in July 1995, Mr Setiadi opened an account with OCBC
Securities and traded in securities through Mr Ng and Mr Tan. For the purpose
of that account, Mr Setiadi deposited the sum of $5m. In respect of the
trading under this account, about $4.13m was returned by OCBC Securities
leaving a balance of about $587,000 (Singapore transactions).**_

_** 6\. Sometime in May 1996, at the request/advice of Mr Ng, Mr Setiadi
deposited US$10m with OCBC Securities for investment in the shares of
Megaworld Properties and Holdings Inc., a company in the Philippines
(Megaworld shares).**_

_** 7\. Mr Setiadis case is that Mr Ng had represented to him that in return
for his investment of US$10m, there would be a guaranteed gross return of 20%
of that investment by OCBC Securities. In consideration of a guarantee being
given to him by OCBC Securities, he agreed to invest about US$10m in Megaworld
shares. The guarantee (the Guarantee) was faxed over by Mr Ng to Mr Setiadi at
his offices in Jakarta. Upon receipt of the Guarantee, Mr Setiadi remitted the
sum of US$10m which was then used to purchase Megaworld shares. The value of
Megaworld shares subsequently plummeted and he suffered a loss.**_

_** 8\. To mitigate his loss, Mr Setiadi sold off the Megaworld shares. He
then commenced an earlier action in Suit No 559 of 1998 (the Firs Action)
against OCBC Securities and Mr Ng to recover the losses suffered under the
Singapore transactions and in respect of the Megaworld shares.**_

_** 9\. Under the Singapore transactions, Mr Setiadi claimed that the losses
were suffered as a result of various unauthorised transactions effected by Mr
Ng. Consequently, OCBC Securities was also vicariously liable to him for the
losses._**

**_ 10\. In respect of the Megaworld shares, Mr Setiadis claim against OCBC
Securities was based on the Guarantee. Alternatively, his claim was that the
terms in the Guarantee were representations made by Mr Ng as a servant/agent
of OCBC Securities to induce him to purchase the Megaworld shares which he
did. As the representations were made fraudulently, he was entitled to rescind
the contract or to claim damages for the loss suffered. As an alternative, he
also claimed that his loss and damage was occasioned by the negligence of Mr
Ng as servant/agent of OCBC Securities._**

**_ 11\. The writ in the First Action was filed on 15 April 1998 and fixed for
trial in November 1998 before Justice Rajendran.**_

_** 12\. On 12 November 1998 (Day 1), on the application of Counsel for OCBC
Securities and for Mr Setiadi, the hearing was adjourned to Monday, 16
November 1998 on the ground that parties needed some time to prepare the
various trial bundles.

13\. On 16 November 1998 (Day 2), the then Counsel for Mr Setiadi in his
opening statement informed the court that Mr Ng had still not been served with
the Writ. Mr Setiadis solicitors were still trying to serve Mr Ng with the
Writ and believed he was away in the Philippines.

14\. On Day 2 of the hearing, Counsel for OCBC Securities also applied for
security for costs, further discovery etc against Mr Setiadi.

15\. On Day 4 of the trial, Mr Setiadis Counsel applied to amend his Statement
of Claim in respect of some of the Singapore transactions. The trial was then
adjourned to 5 April 1999.

16\. At the adjourned hearing on 5 April 1999, OCBC Securities Counsel applied
for leave to amend the Defence to include the point that the Guarantee was
fabricated. OCBC Securities claimed that based on its document experts report,
the Guarantee was a cut and paste job.

17\. For that reason, the trial was then adjourned again and was fixed for
hearing from 13 July 1999 to 26 July 1999.

18\. In the course of the adjournment, Mr Setiadi engaged a document expert
from Australia to deal with the issue as to whether the Guarantee was a cut
and paste job.

19\. On 13 July 1999, Mr Setiadi was re-called to the stand for continued
cross-examination. By then, he was represented by a new Counsel i.e Ms Molly
Lim SC, who also appeared before me.**__**

20\. On 16 July 1999, Ms Lim applied under O 21 r 3 for leave to discontinue
the action. At that stage, the cross examination of Mr Setiadi had not yet
been completed.

21\. It was alleged for Mr Setiadi that during the resumed trial of the First
Action on 13 July 1999, it had became clear that the evidence of Mr Ng was
crucial. Before the amended Defence of OCBC Securities, its pleaded case was a
denial of any liability on the Guarantee and they alleged that Mr Ng had no
authority to issue the Guarantee. Mr Setiadis then solicitors inability to
serve the Writ on Mr Ng was therefore thought not to be crucial and his case
could be proceeded with against OCBC Securities in the absence of Mr Ng.

22\. After the defence was amended to include the point that the Guarantee was
fabricated and during the continuation of the trial from 13 July 1999, Mr
Setiadi learnt from his own document expert that there were at least two
different versions of the Guarantee. The copy in the possession of OCBC
Securities was different from that in the possession of Mr Setiadi

23\. Mr Setiadi alleged that it then became clear that the participation and
evidence of Mr Ng was crucial.

24\. It is important to bear in mind what transpired then before Rajendran J
on 16 July 1999 in respect of the application on behalf of Mr Setiadi to
discontinue the action. I set out below the notes as recorded by the judge:

> _16.7.99 (FRIDAY) (DAY 10)_
>
> _In Chambers._
>
> _2.45pm_
>
> _Miss Lim:_

> > My instructions are to discontinue the action with costs to be taxed. I so
> apply.

> _Shanmugam:_

> > I would ask for action to be discussed (sic) [dismissed] rather than leave
> to discontinue be given.

> > Order 21, rule 3, is for leave. Under that rule court has discretion. My
> reasons for application are:
>>

>> (1) Most horrendous allegations made against OCBC. OCBC is a major
institution in Singapore and prides itself on its reputation. In this context,
it is important for world to know that allegations are frivolous. The best way
to achieve this is to have action struck out.

>>

>> (2) Court has seen the plaintiff on stand. It does not fit within
parameters of what we may see as acceptable behaviour in Singapore. If leave
is granted, nothing to stop him from starting fresh action in Singapore or in
Indonesia on some issues.

>>

>> If Court dismisses the action, then there would be serious difficulties in
him commencing fresh proceedings in Singapore. He may not find difficulties in
Indonesia but he will find any judgment entered difficult to enforce outside
of Indonesia.

>>

>> (3) There is no prejudice to the plaintiff. What the plaintiffs solicitor
is saying is: "I cant go on". That being so, ask that the court dismisses the
claim.

> _Miss Lim:_

> > I ask for leave to discontinue. I spoke and obtained instructions from my
> client on that basis.
>>

>> If court is inclined to dismiss the claim and not grant leave to
discontinue, I would have to take further instructions as to whether I wish to
pursue with this application for leave to discontinue.

>>

>> On the rules, it is courts discretion and I am asking court to exercise
discretion in favour of my client.

> _Shanmugam:_

> > What they really are saying is that the client may not be happy if court
> orders claim to be struck off.

> _Miss Lim:_

> > I have a choice of withdrawing my application.

> _Shanmugam:_

> > If she is withdrawing the application, then she should say so.

> _Court:_ This is a case which I may well, in the exercise of my discretion,
> order that the claims be dismissed.

> _Miss Lim:_

> > I have to take instructions.

> _Court:_ Adjourned 10 minutes for Miss Lim to take instructions.

> > > > > > > > Intld: SR

_Court resumes._

_4 pm_

> _Miss Lim:_

> > We are proceeding with our application for leave to discontinue against
> the 1st defendants. Leave it to court. Discontinuance is only against the
> 1st defendants and not 2nd defendant.

> _Shanmugam:_

> > That makes it all the more imperative that the action against the 1st
> defendants be struck out.

> _Court:_

> > (1) Leave to discontinue denied.
>>

>> (2) Order that the plaintiffs claim against the 1st defendants be struck
out.

>>

>> (3) Costs to be taxed and paid to the 1st defendants.

25\. Mr Setiadi alleged that after the order of 16 July 1999 (the Order), he
tried to locate Mr Ng. When Mr Ng was located, Mr Setiadi commenced the
present action in October 2000 (the Second Action). He also added Mr Tan as a
party to the Second Action.

26\. Mr Ng entered an appearance to the writ on 29 March 2001 and the writ was
served on OCBC Securities on 16 April 2001. If Mr Ng could not be located, the
Second Action would not have been proceeded with since nothing had changed
from the date of the Order.

27\. OCBC Securities then applied for Mr Setiadis claim in the Second Action
to be struck out.

28\. On 18 July 2001, the Deputy Registrar struck out the Second Action.

29\. Mr Setiadi appealed and on 22 August 2001, I dismissed his appeal.

30\. Mr Setiadi has appealed against my decision.

  
_**ARGUMENTS**_

31\. Mr Muthu Arusu for OCBC Securities based his submission on res judicata,
in its original and extended form as enunciated in Henderson v Henderson
[1843-1860] All ER 378 and abuse of the process of the court.

32\. Ms Lim accepted that Mr Setiadi's claim against OCBC Securities in the
Second Action is the same as the claim in the First Action, save for an
additional claim for negligence against OCBC Securities directly rather than
vicariously as in the First Action.

33\. Ms Lim stressed that the judge had not dismissed the claim in the First
Action but had instead ordered that it be struck out.

34\. She sought to rely on a passage in the judgment of Kirby P in Linprint
Pty Ltd v Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd [1991] 23 NSWLR 508 at p 520. However that
passage was based on a clear distinction in the Victorian County Court Rules
between orders of dismissal and striking out. Furthermore, Ms Lim did not
suggest that there was such a clear distinction under the Singapore Rules of
Court.

35\. Ms Lim submitted that the judge could have imposed an express term to the
effect that Mr Setiadi was precluded from commencing a fresh action but the
judge did not. Accordingly, Mr Setiadi was not so precluded.

36\. While it was true that the judge did not impose such a term expressly,
the question was whether that was the meaning of the Order in any event.
Having regard to Ms Lims attempt to discontinue the First Action and the
insistence by Mr Shanmugam SC, who appeared for OCBC Securities, that the
action or claim be dismissed/struck out, and the submissions before the judge,
there was no doubt in my mind that the Order made was to preclude any fresh
action by Mr Setiadi against OCBC Securities.

37\. Ms Lim also submitted that if the intention was to shut out Mr Setiadi
from commencing a fresh action, then he would have withdrawn his application
to discontinue the action.

38\. However, the judges notes show clearly that Ms Lim did not have any doubt
then that that was what Mr Shanmugam was insisting on. Indeed, she herself
said she had the choice of withdrawing the application if such an order was to
be made. After the judge intimated that he might well make such an order, she
then said that she would take instructions. The matter was then adjourned.

39\. Subsequently, Ms Lim returned and said she was proceeding with the
application to discontinue. She also pointed out that the discontinuance was
only as regards the claim against OCBC Securities and not against Mr Ng
whereupon Mr Shanmugam said that this made it all the more imperative that the
First Action be struck out.

40\. In those circumstances, the judge denied leave to discontinue the action
and ordered that the claim against OCBC Securities be struck out.

41\. It really was not open to Ms Lim to argue that Mr Setiadi would have
withdrawn his application to discontinue if he might be precluded from
commencing a fresh action against OCBC Securities.

42\. Ms Lim also submitted that because Mr Shanmugam had submitted that there
would be no prejudice to Mr Setiadi, Mr Setiadi was led to believe that he
would not be precluded from commencing a fresh action against OCBC Securities.

43\. I was of the view that Ms Lims reliance on the argument of no prejudice
was an attempt to take the argument out of context. Seen in the context of
what had transpired, there was no doubt in her mind and Mr Setiadis mind that
if the claim was dismissed or struck out, as opposed to being discontinued, he
would be precluded from commencing a fresh action against OCBC Securities.

44\. Ms Lims next argument was that no irreparable harm was caused to OCBC
Securities if Mr Setiadi was allowed to proceed with his present claim as OCBC
Securities could even apply for costs on a full indemnity basis if Mr Setiadi
fails in the present claim.

45\. I was of the view that this was a disingenuous argument. The point is
that OCBC Securities would have to defend a claim which it was not obliged to
defend as Mr Setiadi was precluded from making the claim against it.

46\. Ms Lim then argued that the judge would prohibit Mr Setiadi from
commencing a fresh action only if it was just to do so, relying on as it
thinks just in O 21 r 3, and it was not just to do so.

47\. Again, this was not the point. Whether it was just to do so or not was
for the judge to decide. He had made the Order. If Mr Setiadi was not
satisfied, he should have appealed against the Order. He did not.

48\. I also did not agree with Ms Lim that to accept the contentions for OCBC
Securities would be tantamount to interfering with the judges order as I have
concluded that the Order means what OCBC Securities contends and not what Mr
Setiadi contends.

49\. In Linprint Pty Ltd v Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd [1991] 23 NSWLR 508,
Linprint Pty Ltd (Linprint) had sued Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd (Hexham) in the
Supreme Court of Victoria. In its defence, Hexham included a counterclaim.
Subsequently, the action was ordered to be tried in the County Court of
Victoria.

50\. On 22 July 1982, the case came on for trial before Murdoch CCJ. Hexham
applied for an adjournment and the case was adjourned to 26 July 1982.

51\. On 26 July 1982, another application for an adjournment was made on
behalf of Hexham. The application was refused and the case was adjourned to
the next day to be heard after the conclusion of a part-heard case. Counsel
for Hexham then announced that he was withdrawing from the case.

52\. On the next day, 27 July 1982, the case was heard. There was no
appearance for Hexham. Linprint proceeded to present its claim, after which
judgment for a sum was entered for it. The counterclaim was dismissed.

53\. More than six months later, Hexham brought an action against Linprint in
the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The statement of claim was equivalent to
the counterclaim previously filed by Hexham.

54\. Linprint pleaded, inter alia, issue estoppel and res judicata.

55\. Linprint applied for these issues to be dealt with as a separate question
pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules 1970 Pt 31. The question came before
Loveday J who answered it adversely to Linprint.

56\. Linprint then appealed to the Court of Appeal of New South Wales.

57\. The argument before the Court of Appeal took an entirely different course
from that adopted by Hexham before Loveday J. Before the judge, Hexham had
based its arguments upon a construction of the County Court Rules in Victoria
but conceded before the Court of Appeal that the argument based on such Rules
could not be relied upon. Instead Hexham, as the respondent, argued that it
had never had a hearing on the merits of its counterclaim.

58\. The Court of Appeal decided that Hexham was precluded from making a fresh
claim, Kirby P deciding on both the grounds of res judicata and issue
estoppel.

59\. At p 519, he said:

> In England, however, in litigation between private litigants the courts have
> not been in doubt. At least so far as the doctrine of issue estoppel is
> concerned, it has been held in the English Court of Appeal that a party
> which has put forward a positive case to a court and then at trial declines
> to proceed, will not be permitted later to pursue the same case and this,
> even though there has been no determination on the matter "on the merits".
> In Khan v Golechha International ltd [1980] 1 WLR 1482; [1980] 2 All ER 259,
> the Court of Appeal held that a party was estopped from asserting the
> contrary of what had been raised in earlier proceedings and there conceded
> by counsel then appearing for that party.
>
> [Emphasis added.]

60\. At p 520, he said:

> .
>
> The English Court of Appeal applied the decision in Khan in SCF Finance Co
> Ltd v Masri (No 3) [1987] QB 1028 at 1048. Whilst the decisions are not
> binding on this Court, the reasoning in them is persuasive. Whilst that
> reasoning is confined to the application of the law of issue estoppel (where
> a matter has not been specifically judicially determined) it applies with
> even greater force where the issue has been so determined and is thus res
> judicata. It should be remembered that res judicata has lately been
> described as "cause of action estoppel": see, eg, Thoday v Thoday [1964] P
> 181 at 197 per Diplock LJ; and see also Lord Wilberforce in Carl Zeiss (No
> 2) (at 966). The genus dealt with by these two branches of law is the same.
> The public policy upon which each rests is that of the finality of judicial
> determinations in respect of which a litigant should not be vexed for a
> second time. If the reasoning in Khan and SCF Finance are applied to the
> present case, there can likewise be but one answer to the rhetorical
> question.

> > "Would it not be a case of the [appellant] company being vexed a second
> time in relation to an issue which it was open to the plaintiff to have
> determined in the previous proceedings?"

> That answer is that it would. If, as it is contended, the respondent did not
> have a trial "on the merits" this was solely by virtue of its own conduct.
> It instructed its counsel to withdraw. Once the adjournment was refused, no
> endeavour was made (for example by subpoena of witnesses, the evidence of
> experts or otherwise) to prove the respondents case. It was simply
> abandoned. The respondent walked away from it.

61\. At p 521, he continued:

> Issue estoppel: a wider principle:
>
> If, contrary to the foregoing conclusions, a proper interpretation of the
> proceedings in the County Court of Victoria is that there was no judicial
> adjudication of the matters involved in the counter-claim by virtue of the
> withdrawal of the respondent, and therefore that res judicata does not
> apply, the same result nonetheless follows from the application of the law
> of issue estoppel. The issues which the respondent now wishes to litigate in
> the Supreme Court of this State were either (a) necessarily inherent in the
> issues raised by the counter-claim and defence in the County Court of
> Victoria or (b) so intimately connected with those issues that the Court
> would require that the party to the litigation should have pleaded them in
> such a way as to have them resolved in the Victorian proceedings. It would
> have been unreasonable not to have pleaded them in those proceedings and, to
> the extent that they were not pleaded, they should not now be allowed to be
> pleaded again.

62\. Another member of the Court of Appeal Clarke JA said, at p 525:

> The second question which then arises is whether that order founds a plea of
> res judicata. According to counsel for the respondent it does not for there
> had been no hearing of the counter-claim and in these circumstances, the
> dismissal should be regarded as having the same effect as a discontinuance.
> I cannot accept this proposition for the rules prescribe procedures which
> must be followed in order to enable a party to discontinue. Unless a party
> complies with those procedures it cannot be said to have discontinued nor is
> it entitled to the benefits, if any, which flow from such discontinuance.
> The case must, therefore, be judged solely upon the basis that the counter-
> claim was dismissed for want of appearance of the counter-claimant at the
> trial.

63\. At p 526, Clarke JA said:

> I take it that these authorities establish that if a plaintiff withdraws
> from the trial and an order is made in its absence dismissing its claim then
> that order will, unless set aside or successfully appealed from, ground a
> later plea of res judicata in the event that a later attempt is made to
> litigate the same case. The position is no different than that which arises
> under a default judgment.

64\. On the facts before me, the Order was made in the presence of Counsel for
Mr Setiadi after some argument on the nature of the order to be made and after
she had taken instructions from him with full knowledge of the possible
consequence of his application.

65\. In my view, the principle of res judicata and issue estoppel would apply
a fortiori.

66\. The judgment in Linprint and the two English cases cited therein also
dispose of Ms Lims other argument that there can be no issue estoppel unless
there is a decision on the merits of the case.

67\. As for the argument that Mr Setiadis fresh claim was an abuse of the
process of the court, Ms Lim submitted that this was not so because mere re-
litigation, in circumstances falling short of cause of action estoppel or
issue estoppel, did not necessarily give rise to such an abuse.

68\. The short answer to that was that the circumstances before me did give
rise to res judicata and issue estoppel.

69\. The two cases which Ms Lim cited to support her argument were Bradford &
Bingley Building Society v Seddon (Hancock and others, t/a Hancocks (a firm),
third parties) [1999] 4 All ER 217 and Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate
of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit & another [2000] 1 SLR 517.

70\. However the facts in those two cases and in the case before me were
different. In those two cases, the party who was relying on res judicata or
issue estoppel was not a party in the earlier proceedings.

71\. Accordingly, if Mr Tan, as the third defendant in the Second Action, was
raising the issue of res judicata or issue estoppel against Mr Setiadi, Mr Tan
would probably not succeed because he was not even a party in the First
Action.

72\. Likewise, Mr Ng would probably also not succeed on such an argument for a
different reason i.e the claim against him was not struck out.

73\. Ms Lim also submitted that an order made pursuant to an application under
O 21 r 3 is similar to one made under O 13 r 9 and is not capable of giving
rise to res judicata. She cited Mullen & Conoco Ltd [1998] QBD 382.

74\. However, again, the facts in Mullen were different from those before me.

75\. In that case, Conoco Ltd sued Mr Mullen in the High Court for the price
of petrol delivered to him and obtained judgment in default of defence. Mr
Mullen applied to set aside the judgment under O 13 r 9 RSC on the grounds
that the petrol supply agreement between Conoco Ltd and him was so one-sided,
unfair and unreasonable as to be unenforceable against him. His application
was dismissed by the deputy master.

76\. Two months later, he issued a county court summons against Conoco Ltd for
trading losses arising out of the enforcement of an improper and unreasonable
supply agreement.

77\. Conoco Ltd then applied to strike out the claim. One of their grounds was
cause of action or issue estoppel.

78\. The application was heard by a District Judge who struck out the claim
for damages but allowed an implicit claim for rescission of the agreement to
stand.

79\. On appeal to Judge Urquhart, the claim in both respects was struck out.

80\. Mr Mullen then appealed to the Court of Appeal which concluded that an
application under O 13 r 9 to set aside a default judgment involved a
discretionary jurisdiction. If the courts power was exercised on a
discretionary basis, eg for delay, then it was difficult to say that any issue
had been decided by the court.

81\. Evans LJ said, at p 391E, that the question was whether the earlier
ruling in Conocos High Court Action, which he considered to be an
interlocutory one, was so clear and so specific as regards a particular
defence of Mr Mullen and were there no special factors so that an estoppel may
arise.

82\. On those facts and bearing in mind that Mr Mullen was not represented
prior to the default judgment obtained in the High Court, Evans LJ allowed Mr
Mullens appeal in respect of Conocos application to strike out.

83\. However the Court of Appeal did not say that a decision based on O 13 r 9
could never constitute an estoppel. Indeed this possibility was accepted by
Evans LJ at p 391D.

84\. Moreover, the Court of Appeal also did not say that a decision based on
the exercise of a discretion under any of the rules of court would never
amount to res judicata or issue estoppel. Obviously each case must depend on
its facts.

_**Additional claim by Mr Setiadi  
**_  
85\. As for the additional claim by Mr Setiadi against OCBC Securities on the
ground that OCBC Securities was directly, as opposed to vicariously, liable
for negligence, Mr Setiadi appeared to be precluded from maintaining the claim
under the extended doctrine of res judicata as propounded in the oft-cited
judgment of Wigram VC in Henderson v Henderson [1843-1860] All ER 378:

> where a given matter becomes the subject to litigation in, and of
> adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires that
> the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will
> not, except in special circumstances, permit the same parties to open the
> same subject of litigation in respect of matter (sic) which might have been
> brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought
> forward only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even
> accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies,
> except in special cases, not only to points on which the court was actually
> required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to
> every point which probably belonged to the subject to litigation and which
> the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at
> the time.

86\. However, Ms Lim submitted that the rule in Henderson has been explained
by Goulding J in Jelson (Estates) Ltd v Harvey [1984] 1 All ER 12 at p 16
where he said:

> That seems to me a misconception of the doctrine put forward in such cases
> as Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100, [1843-60] All ER Rep 378 and Yat
> Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd [1975] AC 581. Where there is
> litigation of a certain question or issue before the court resulting in a
> final or substantial order which decides it, then it is well established
> that it is too late (save in exceptional cases) for a party to adduce in
> subsequent litigation against the same opponent, or one privy to him, a fact
> that might well have been brought forward on the previous occasion. That
> doctrine, however, does not apply where there is a mere procedural defect
> and the court has never gone into the merits, though both parties were
> before it.

87\. I noted that the facts in Jelson were quite different from those before
me.

88\. In that case, a plaintiff had obtained interlocutory injunctions
restraining the defendant from doing certain acts on the plaintiffs land. The
plaintiff then applied by a notice of motion seeking the defendants committal
for alleged disobedience of the order. The notice of motion did not set out on
its face the grounds of the plaintiffs application as required by the English
Rules of the Supreme Court and accordingly the motion was dismissed for
irregularity without the hearing of evidence or the consideration of merits.

89\. The plaintiff then filed a fresh motion. The defendant contended, by
analogy with criminal proceedings, that he was entitled to the defence of
autrefois acquit

90\. Hence, the procedural defect that Goulding J was referring to was the
defect in the notice of motion.

91\. Mr Setiadis application to discontinue the First Action against OCBC
Securities could not be said to be a mere procedural defect.

92\. In so far as Goulding J had suggested that the court must have gone into
the merits before res judicata can apply, that is not the law as I have
elaborated above.

93\. The additional claim against OCBC Securities was so intimately connected
with the claim against it in the First Action that it should have been pleaded
then.

94\. As for the alleged reason for discontinuing the First Action, I did not
accept the reason.

95\. In April 1999, Mr Setiadi and his then Counsel knew that OCBC Securities
were relying on the argument that the Guarantee had been fabricated. They must
have realised by then that Mr Ngs evidence was crucial.

96\. It was not necessary to wait until Mr Setiadis expert had advised that
there were different versions of the Guarantee to realise that Mr Ngs evidence
was crucial. Besides, on 16 July 1999, Ms Lim did not even apply for an
adjournment to try and locate Mr Ng before applying for leave to discontinue.

97\. The fact that Mr Setiadi would pay costs if he lost in the Second Action
or that Mr Setiadi would otherwise be shut out was also not a special
circumstance. Otherwise, the extended doctrine of res judicata would be
rendered nugatory.

98\. In summary, there was no special circumstance to allow Mr Setiadi to re-
litigate against OCBC Securities even in respect of his additional
claim.**__**
