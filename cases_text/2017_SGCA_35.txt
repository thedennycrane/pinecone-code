Court of Appeal — Civil Appeal No 144 of 2016  
Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA and Tay Yong Kwang JA  
3 May 2017

Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the court ex tempore):

1 This appeal arises out of a road traffic accident which led to the
commencement of District Court Suit No 1738 of 2013. By consent, interlocutory
judgment was entered on 4 February 2015, although it was only extracted some
time later on 28 August 2015. In a subsequent summons filed on 28 March 2016,
the preliminary issue was raised as to whether the suit was deemed
discontinued pursuant to O 21 r 2(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014
Rev Ed) (“O 21 r 2(6)”). O 21 r 2(6) reads as follows:

(6) Subject to paragraph (6A), if no party to an action or a cause or matter
has, for more than one year (or such extended period as the Court may allow
under paragraph (6B)), taken any step or proceeding in the action, cause or
matter that appears from records maintained by the Court, the action, cause or
matter is deemed to have been discontinued.

2 The Deputy Registrar held that the suit was deemed discontinued on 4
February 2016 as the extraction of the interlocutory judgment did not
constitute a step in the proceedings. This was reversed on appeal to the
District Judge (“the DJ”), who ruled (in Saravanan a/l Subramaniam as
dependent of the Estate of Lingaswari a/p Koushanan (Deceased) and also for
the benefit of the other dependents of the Estate of Lingaswari a/p Koushanan
(Deceased) v Chua Peng Ho and another [2016] SGDC 195 (“the District Court
Judgment”)) that the extraction of the interlocutory judgment qualified as
such a step. The further appeal to the High Court was dismissed by the Judge,
who found himself in entire agreement with the DJ. The Judge subsequently
granted leave to appeal to this court.

3 The sole issue before this court is whether the extraction of the
interlocutory judgment amounted to a “step or proceeding” for the purposes of
O 21 r 2(6). This, in turn, gives rise to the following sub-issues:

(a) whether a “step or proceeding” for the purposes of O 21 r 2(6) has to be
one that moves the action forward towards resolution; and

(b) if a “step or proceeding” for the purposes of O 21 r 2(6) has to be one
that moves the action forward towards resolution, whether the extraction of
the interlocutory judgment moved the action forward towards resolution.

4 Having considered the submissions by counsel for the parties, we hold that a
“step or proceeding” for the purposes of O 21 r 2(6) does not have to be one
that moves the action forward towards resolution. The Appellant had relied on
the decision of this court in The “Melati” [2004] 4 SLR(R) 7 (“The Melati”)
(at [17]) for the proposition to the contrary. However, a close perusal of the
judgment in The Melati (especially at [17]−[24]) will demonstrate that this
court had been merely referring to the precise step taken in that case (viz,
the filing and serving of a statement of claim (albeit out of time)) and how,
on the facts, that step had moved the action forward towards resolution. It
was not laying down a general normative proposition that, in order to
constitute a “step or proceeding” pursuant to O 21 r 2(6), the act concerned
had to be one that moved the action forward towards resolution. In our view,
what O 21 r 2(6) proscribes is total inaction or inactivity and/or an act that
is not part of the “records maintained by the Court” (see also The Melati at
[24], citing the views of Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in Moguntia-Est
Epices SA v Sea-Hawk Freight Pte Ltd [2003] 4 SLR(R) 429).

5 Indeed, as Chao Hick Tin JA, delivering the judgment of the court,
pertinently observed in The Melati (at [24]), “[t]he court has sufficient
arsenal to deal with a party who abuses its process” (a point also noted by
the DJ in the District Court Judgment at [30] as well as at [51]). Chao JA
proceeded to note as follows (at [24]):

… We seriously doubt there would be many litigants who would deliberately take
such a risk and put the court’s patience to the test.

6 In the circumstances, the extraction of the interlocutory judgment amounted
to a “step or proceeding” for the purposes of O 21 r 2(6) in the context of
the present case. It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the second
sub-issue (above at [3(b)]), although we would also endorse the DJ’s reasoning
on this point as well as her conclusion that the extraction of the
interlocutory judgment was, in any event, a “step” which moved the case
forward towards resolution (see the District Court Judgment at [47]−[50]).

7 The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs

8 As we have already noted, the High Court Judge was in entire agreement with
the District Court Judgment and did not see the need to issue a separate
judgment. We are also in entire agreement with the District Court Judgment and
would like to take this opportunity to commend the DJ for her comprehensive
and well-reasoned judgment.
