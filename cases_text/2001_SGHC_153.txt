> committed an offence punishable under section 304(a) of the Penal Code,
> Chapter 224._

  
  
The statement of facts set out the circumstances leading to the discovery of
the deceased`s body in the ground floor flat, the fateful events in the
morning of 8 December 2000 as told by the accused in his statements to the
police, the postmortem findings of Dr Teo Eng Swee, a Consultant Forensic
Pathologist from the Department of Scientific Services and the opinion of Dr
Stephen Phang, an Associate Consultant from the Woodbridge Hospital/Institute
of Mental Health, contained in his report dated 30 December 2000. The
statement of facts read:

> _
>
> 1 The accused is Ong Wee Teck, NRIC No. S1493815-Z, male, 39 years of age.
> He was unemployed and residing at Block 767 Yishun Ave 3 [num ]01-315 at the
> time of the offence.
>
> 2 The deceased is Ong Wee Cheong, NRIC No. S0180305-J, male 46 years of age.
> He worked as a hawker helper. He was the accused`s elder brother.
>
> 3 At the time of the offence, the accused was residing at Block 767 Yishun
> Ave 3 [num ]01-315 (hereinafter referred to as "the flat") with his 15-year-
> old son, Ong Keng Peang, and the deceased. The deceased was providing for
> the accused and his son since the accused was not gainfully employed.
>
> _

> _**The Incident** _

> _
>
> 4 Ong Keng Peang last saw the deceased alive on 7 December 2000. After
> having dinner with the accused and the deceased, Ong Keng Peang left the
> flat at about 9pm. Ong Keng Peang returned to the flat on 8 December 2000 at
> about 12:30pm but could not gain entry as he did not have the keys and no
> one answered the door. He then left.
>
> 5 Later that day at about 11:30pm, Ong Keng Peang returned to the flat
> again. This time, the accused opened the door. Seeing that the accused was
> alone in the flat, Ong Keng Peang asked where the deceased was. The accused
> told Ong Keng Peang that he had killed the deceased because the deceased
> wanted to poison him. Ong Keng Peang saw masking tape all around the door
> frame of the rear utility room, which was the deceased`s bedroom. Ong Keng
> Peang then asked the accused why there was masking tape on the door frame
> and the accused said that it was to prevent the stench from coming out of
> the room.
>
> 6 Feeling frightened, Ong Keng Peang left the flat and tried to look for the
> deceased at the coffeeshop where he worked. When Ong Keng Peang could not
> find the deceased, he sought help from his friend, Lim Wei Jian. Together
> with Lim Wei Jian, Ong Keng Peang eventually went to look for his
> grandmother (the accused`s mother) at about 3:45am on 9 December 2000. He
> related to his grandmother what had happened and she told him to go to sleep
> first and report the matter to the police later in the morning.
>
> 7 On 9 December 2000 at about 12:30pm, Ong Keng Peang and Lim Wei Jian went
> to a Neighbourhood Police Post and reported to the police that the accused
> had said that he had killed the deceased. Ong Keng Peang also informed the
> police that his father was insane and his grandmother had gone to look for
> his father at Block 767 Yishun Ave 3 [num ]01-315. The police then told him
> to proceed to the flat to wait for them.
>
> 8 The police arrived at the flat at about 1:05pm on 9 December 2000. The
> iron grille was padlocked and the accused answered the door. The accused
> later opened the door to let the police in, and told them that there was
> someone at the rear and asked them to go and take a look. The police found
> masking tape sealing the entire door frame of the rear utility room. The
> police saw blood all over in the rear utility room and called for
> reinforcement.
>
> 9 The police had to use force to push open the door to the rear utility
> [**_sic_**] fully as it was blocked by an unused refrigerator placed behind
> the door inside the room. The police found the deceased lying naked on the
> floor in the rear utility room next to the window and there was a lot of
> blood on the floor and on the walls around him. The body was in a crouching
> position. The head was on the floor (face down), the forearms and hands were
> to either side of the head. There was a pool of blood around the region of
> the head. The thighs were folded under the abdomen. The deceased was
> pronounced dead at about 1:50pm on 9 December 2000, and the accused was
> placed under arrest.
>
> _

> _**The Accused`s Statements** _

> _
>
> 10 The accused said in his statements to the police that on 8 December 2000
> at about 8:00 a.m., the deceased came home after having breakfast. He gave
> the accused $10 and told the accused to go and have his coffee. The deceased
> then went to the bathroom in the kitchen to take a shower. Suddenly, the
> thought of killing the deceased came into the accused`s mind and the accused
> went to the kitchen to take a chopper from the wash basin. He then pushed
> open the bathroom door with force and saw the deceased standing there naked.
> The accused then slashed the deceased`s head with the chopper. The deceased
> was shocked and asked him "How can you slash me?" and asked the accused to
> send him to the hospital. The deceased struggled with the accused and tried
> to grab the chopper from the accused. The accused continued to slash the
> deceased with the chopper. The deceased asked the accused why he was
> attacking him and who would take care of their mother and the accused`s son.
> After a while, the accused stopped the attack. The deceased was bleeding
> profusely.
>
> 11 The accused then came out of the bathroom and placed the chopper on the
> kitchen wash basin. He sat down at the kitchen table to smoke a cigarette.
> The deceased, who was lying on the bathroom floor, got up and went to the
> rear utility room and closed the door. The accused heard him falling down to
> the ground in the room. The accused then went to take a bath and used the
> deceased`s shirt and water to clean the bloodstains in the bathroom and the
> kitchen. Later, he used masking tape to seal up the door of the utility
> room.

> _**Post-mortem Findings** _

> _
>
> 12 Dr Teo Eng Swee, the Consultant Forensic Pathologist from the Department
> of Scientific Services, examined the body at the scene on 9 December 2000 at
> about 5:45pm and found that the body was cold and rigor mortis was
> dissipating. Dr Teo conducted an autopsy on 11 December 2000 at about 9:30am
> and found 25 slash or incised wounds on the deceased`s head, neck and
> various parts of the body. The left side of the mandible was fractured,
> related to the incised wound on the left mandibular region of the face.
> There were also incised wounds of the skull. Dr Teo certified that the cause
> of death was **_positional asphyxia_** , which was contributed to by the
> head injury (intracranial haemorrhage) as well as blood loss (haemorrhage
> due to incised wounds). Dr Teo is of the opinion that it would be difficult
> for a person to breathe in the position in which the body was found, and the
> deceased was probably unable to move himself out of that position because of
> the injuries he sustained. A copy of the post-mortem report A2039/2000 is
> annexed at **_Tab A_**.

> _**Psychiatric Assessment** _

> _
>
> 13 The accused was arrested on 9 December 2000 and remanded at Changi Prison
> Hospital for psychiatric observation from 11 December 2000 to 2 January
> 2001.
>
> 14 Dr Phang is of the opinion that the accused suffered from an acute
> relapse of **_schizophrenia_** , a major form of mental illness, at the time
> of the incident. He was labouring under **_florid paranoid delusions of a
> persecutory and bizarre nature_** , in that he was convinced that
> governments desired to harm him and frame him up, via the employment of
> computers. At the time of the offence, the accused was convinced that the
> deceased had the intention to poison him, which then elicited the violent
> response from him, with fatal consequence. Dr Phang also elicited
> **_passivity phenomena_** which are feelings of no longer being in control
> of one`s own thoughts, feelings or will, and that an external (frequently
> mysterious) force has superceded the volitional capacity of the individual
> not to perform certain actions. In this case, the accused felt that the
> `computers` were controlling his actions at the material time of the
> killing, as part of an overall scheme by the `government` to frame him for
> murdering his brother. The accused also felt that people around him knew
> what he was thinking, or could read his mind, a classic schizophrenic
> phenomenon known as **_thought broadcast_**.
>
> 15 Nonetheless, Dr Phang is of the opinion that, at the time of the killing,
> the accused remained aware of the nature of his actions and he knew that it
> was wrong and contrary to law. The accused was therefore **_not of unsound
> mind at the time of the offence_**. Dr Phang is also of the opinion that the
> accused was very likely to have intended to cause death, the fact that such
> an intention was delusion-driven notwithstanding, and was also sufficiently
> lucid to know that his act was likely to have resulted in death. However,
> his act of killing was a product of his relapsed mental illness, which
> constitutes an abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental
> responsibility for his act in killing his brother. The accused should
> qualify for the defence of **_diminished responsibility_**. A copy of the
> psychiatric report MR 2379/2000 is annexed at **_Tab B_**.

The accused had two previous convictions. On 9 January 1992, he was fined $200
for disorderly behaviour (under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public
Order and Nuisance) Act) and $1,000 for committing mischief (under s 427 of
the Penal Code).  
  
**_The sentence_**

****

Section 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides for mandatory imprisonment
for life or for a term of up to ten years. The section also provides for a
discretionary fine or caning.  
  
On the basis of Dr Phang`s psychiatric report on the accused, the prosecution
submitted that life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence here. The
prosecution said it was looking beyond retribution to the need for protection
of the public.  
  
On the other hand, defence counsel submitted that life imprisonment would be
too harsh for this accused who did not choose to suffer from mental illness
and who was a danger only if he did not take his medication.  
  
The accused is a divorcee with a 15-year-old son. His mother is 68 years old.
His father passed away many years ago. He has nine other siblings. He deeply
regretted taking his elder brother`s life and could not understand why he had
done so.  
  
Defence counsel further argued that while the accused`s family members were
less than enthusiastic about taking care of him, they could apply under the
Mental Disorders and Treatment Act at the appropriate time for the accused to
be placed in an institution. Although they were not people of means, they
could make such an application with the assistance of the Legal Aid Bureau.  
  
**Neo Man Lee v PP** [1991] SLR 146  [1991] 2 MLJ 369  was a case involving a
schizophrenic man convicted under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for having
stabbed a woman to death in the changing room of a condominium. The accused
there was arrested on 27 September 1984 and after a trial which stretched from
3 October 1988 to 25 May 1989, he was convicted and sentenced by FA Chua J to
life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest. The judge there
said:

> _The doctors have reported that you are suffering from a chronic
> schizophrenic illness which requires a long-term maintenance drug treatment
> for an indefinite period and that is to minimize relapses and if you have a
> relapse, you may pose a danger to yourself and to society. Now, the public
> must be protected against you and the detention, in my view, should be as
> long as it is permissible under the law. A long-term imprisonment would also
> be for your own good because whilst in prison, you will get proper medical
> care and attention. I will be failing in my duty if I do not sentence you to
> a long term of imprisonment. You are sentenced to imprisonment for life._

  
  
On appeal to the then Court of Criminal Appeal, Yong Pung How CJ said:

> _Section 304(a) is, on the face of it, rather curiously drafted, because in
> addition to the sentence to imprisonment for life, there is the alternative
> possibility of a much lighter custodial sentence up to a maximum of ten
> years. The only question in the present case was whether the sentence to
> imprisonment for life was justified._

> _The deputy public prosecutor referred us to a report on sentencing from the
> Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in England in the case of**R v
> Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson** [1968] 52 Cr App R 113 which carried the
> following statement by MacKenna J, with which we are in broad agreement:_

> _`When the following conditions are satisfied, a sentence of life
> imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences
> are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it
> appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant`s history that
> he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the
> future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the consequences to
> others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or
> crimes of violence.`_

> _In the present case, the appellant has been suffering from schizophrenia, a
> major mental illness, since 1975. Both the psychiatrists` reports, which
> were considered by the court before sentence was passed, were to the effect
> that he would require a long term drug treatment for an indefinite period to
> minimize relapses during which he might pose a danger to society and
> himself. In fact, the appellant had two relapses in 1980, one in 1983, and
> one in 1984 when he committed the present offence; and, while he was in
> remand in 1987 and 1988 he had two more relapses lasting one week and one
> month respectively._

> _We were of the opinion that the conditions for sentence to imprisonment for
> life were clearly satisfied in the present case and justified a life
> sentence. The appellant is clearly a continuing danger not only to himself
> but also to the public. The trial judge was of the view, which we shared,
> that he should be detained as long as it was permissible under the law. We
> might add that, with remissions, life imprisonment in Singapore may be
> reduced in practice to no more than 14 years, and the appellant may in fact
> be out of prison in another seven years._

  
  
Subsequently, in **Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v PP** [1997] 3 SLR 643 , the
Court of Appeal held that a sentence of life imprisonment meant imprisonment
for the remaining natural life of the prisoner. After that decision, r 119A of
the Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, Rg 2, 1990 Ed) was passed. Under this rule,
a Life Imprisonment Review Board reviews the suitability for release of
prisoners who have served 20 years of their sentence of life imprisonment at
intervals not exceeding 12 months. The Board then submits a written report to
the Minister who may, in his discretion, remit, with or without conditions,
any part of the sentence of imprisonment to which the prisoners have been
sentenced.  
  
**_Neo Man Lee, Abdul Nasir_** and the said r 119A were re-visited in the
Court of Appeal`s decision in **PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan** [1999] 2 SLR 288 .
There, an 18-year-old male pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(a) of the
Penal Code for causing the death of another male by stabbing him with a knife.
He was sentenced to seven years` imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane.
The prosecution, which had urged the trial judge to impose the maximum
permissible sentence of life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane,
appealed. The Court of Appeal enhanced the sentence to ten years` imprisonment
and 15 strokes of the cane. Commenting on **_Neo Man Lee_** `s case, Lai Kew
Chai J (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) said (at [para ]20):

> _Yong Pung How CJ noted specifically, however, that `with remissions, life
> imprisonment in Singapore may be reduced in practice to no more than 14
> years, and the appellant may in fact be out of prison in another seven
> years`. That logic is now obviously negated in light of our decision
> in**Abdul Nasir** , and all the cases in which the life sentence was imposed
> must be viewed in that context._

  
  
The prosecution pointed out five other cases where accused persons suffering
from one form of mental disorder or another were sentenced to life
imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code by the High Court. Three of
these were pre-**_Abdul Nasir_** and two were post-**_Abdul Nasir_**. Of these
two cases, both involving schizophrenic accused persons, one was convicted
after trial and the other was convicted upon his plea of guilt. In the former
case (**_PP v Carilman Aloysius Joshi_** \- CC 43/99) Chan Seng Onn JC said
(at [para ]32 of the judgment):

> _The accused never accepted that he had any mental illness. It necessarily
> followed that he would not take his medication voluntarily. I agreed with
> the submission of the DPP that the accused must be sentenced to life
> imprisonment so that he would not become a danger to himself and to society.
> Whilst under confinement in prison, he would receive proper treatment which
> would be for his own good._

  
  
The accused`s appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 22 November 1999.
Defence counsel pointed out to me that the accused in that case had been
admitted to Woodbridge Hospital some 17 times since 1986 and that he was given
to consuming alcohol which would make his mental state worse.  
  
I do not consider the comments made in **_Tan Kei Loon Allan_** as having
negated or qualified the principles set out in **_Neo Man Lee_**. The earlier
Court of Appeal decision made it clear that when the stated conditions were
satisfied, a sentence of imprisonment for life would be justified. There, the
Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the accused, who was
suffering from chronic schizophrenia, should be detained for as long as it was
permissible under the law and the maximum permissible was life imprisonment.
The concluding comment of the Court of Appeal that Neo Man Lee could in fact
be released in seven years was no more than a passing remark alluding to the
fact that the prisoner had already been in custody for almost seven years at
the time of his appeal. I do not think the Court of Appeal would have
sentenced the accused there any differently even if the court was of the view
that life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remaining natural life of
the accused. I am fortified in this belief by the dismissal of Carilman`s
appeal. I therefore applied the principles in **_Neo Man Lee_** to the facts
of the present case.  
  
Here, the accused`s psychiatric history went back to 1986 when he was first
treated at a psychiatric outpatient clinic. He defaulted in his treatment and,
while in a state of relapse, jumped from a height in 1988, injuring his spine
in the process which resulted in partial paralysis of his lower limbs. He
resumed psychiatric treatment until July 1991 when he defaulted again. He was
admitted to Woodbridge Hospital for two periods of time - from 3 November 1991
to 9 December 1991 and from 14 May 1992 to 4 June 1992 - because of his
violent behaviour. He had broken some furniture and assaulted his former wife
with a knife.  
  
The psychiatrist was of the opinion that the accused required `ongoing
treatment, probably on a lifelong basis` and that the act of killing `was a
product of his relapsed mental illness`. The psychiatrist concluded his
assessment with the following words:

> _I would add that the future of dangerousness remains significant, and he
> should be held in a secure setting, possibly by subsequently invoking the
> Mental Disorders and Treatment Act._

  
  
The accused has shown what he could do in a state of relapse - inflicting 25
incised wounds on another adult male with a chopper. He had also previously
attacked his ex-wife with a knife. He had defaulted at least twice in his
treatment. He was clearly a continuing danger not only to himself but also to
the public.  
  
In the circumstances, I imposed a sentence of imprisonment for life on the
accused deemed to commence on 9 December 2000, the date of his arrest.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
