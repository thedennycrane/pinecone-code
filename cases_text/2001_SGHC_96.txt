**_The claim and the appeal_**

****

This is an application for leave to appeal against the decision of the
district judge ordering the plaintiff to furnish security for costs in the sum
of $5,000. This is a personal injury case.  
  
The plaintiff is an Indian national and a construction worker. On 2 January
1999 he suffered injuries to his spine and knee. He says that at that time he
was engaged in work relating to the construction of a road within Changi
Airport. On that date he was indisputably working for the defendants.  
  
He brought this action in the subordinate courts seeking damages. Before this
he had made a claim under the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 354, 1998 Ed).
The Commissioner of Labour issued a notice of assessment on 21 January 2000.
Later the plaintiff changed his mind and withdrew his claim under the
Workmen`s Compensation Act and filed this action.  
  
The statement of claim asserted that the plaintiff and another worker, while
at work, were standing on a staging. The legs of the staging were fitted with
casters (swivel wheels). Two other co-workers pushed the staging to the next
work spot while the plaintiff and his co-worker remained on the staging. While
the staging was being pushed one of the casters hit a snag in the floor. The
caster came off and the staging tilted to one side. In the result the
plaintiff lost his balance and fell to the ground. The staging toppled on him.
Consequently he suffered injuries. He says that the defendants were negligent.
He made the alternative or additive assertion that the defendants were in
breach of the Factories Act (Cap 104, 1998 Ed) and the Factories (Building
Operations and Works of Engineering Construction) Regulations (Cap 104, Rg 8,
1999 Ed).  
  
At this point I must advert to the `Detailed Description of Accident` set out
in the `Notice of Accident` submitted by the defendant under the Workmen`s
Compensation Act and the Workmen`s Compensation Regulations (Cap 354, Rg 1,
1990 Ed). I reproduce it in an edited form to correct the grammar:

> _The said worker was deploy [**sic**] to open the formwork at mechanical
> room to erect the scaffolding for access to work. While climbing up the
> scaffolding to working platform, he slipped and fell and his right leg was
> injured._

  
  
The notice further said that the plaintiff `Carried out general construction
work **_as instructed by site foreman_** ` (emphasis is added). At the end of
the Notice of Accident, a director of the defendants certified that the
information given in the notice `is correct to the best of my knowledge`.  
  
In the defence filed in this action the defendants pleaded allegations
incongruent with the contents of the Notice of Accident. The defence admitted
that the stage was moved while the plaintiff was on the stage. The following
admission in the notice is omitted from the defence: `While climbing up the
scaffolding to working platform, he slipped and fell`. Furthermore, there is
no positive case in respect of the staging hitting the snag on the floor.  
  
The discrepancy in the notice and the defence augurs ill for the defendants.
Prima facie, the plaintiff is likely to recover substantial damages even as a
division of liability. There is no defence to the cause of action. The
likelihood of the plaintiff succeeding is very strong. Such being the case,
the question of security for costs becomes an unjust exercise intended to
stifle a strong prima facie claim simply because the plaintiff is a foreigner
without an address within the jurisdiction. Its purpose effectively is to deny
justice to the plaintiff.  
  
When the order for security was made the plaintiff wanted to appeal against
the order. However, he was advised that he required leave to appeal. He then
applied for leave. He was denied leave. He has appealed against the refusal.  
  
**_The law on appeal_**

****

It is necessary to interpose at this stage an important point as to whether
leave was required to appeal against the order for security for costs. This
concerns s 21(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed).
This provides as follows:

> _Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other written law, an appeal
> shall lie to the High Court from a decision of a District Court or
> Magistrate`s Court in any suit or action for the recovery of immovable
> property or in any civil cause or matter where the amount in dispute or the
> value of the subject-matter exceeds $50,000 or such other amount as may be
> specified by an order made under subsection (3) or with the leave of a
> District Court, a Magistrate`s Court or the High Court if under that
> amount._

  
  
It was thought that `the amount in dispute` was the amount of security which
was ordered. This was patently wrong. The amount relates to `the cause or
matter`. The court`s power to order security for costs is in respect of the
plaintiff`s claim and not the defendant`s application for security for costs.
That is the amount of the substantive claim that is in dispute. The
application for costs had no relation to the amount in dispute in the case.
The application for security involved a question of procedural and
interlocutory matter. It is a question of whether the plaintiff should be
allowed to prosecute his claim unconditionally. The ceiling of $50,000 relates
to the substantive claim which in this case clearly exceeds $50,000. The
special damages alone exceeds $85,000. The plaintiff, accordingly, was
entitled to appeal as of right. That is not the point of appeal which is
before me. The subject matter of appeal is whether leave to appeal ought to
have been granted. I will therefore proceed to decide the point before me.  
  
**_Leave to appeal - the principles_**

****

The guiding principle for granting leave is whether the appeal is likely to
succeed and whether, if leave is not granted, there is a likelihood of
substantial injustice. In **Smith v Cosworth Casting Processes** [1997] 4 All
ER 840[1997] 1 WLR 1538, the English Court of Appeal stated that: `The Court
will only **_refuse_** leave if satisfied that the applicant has no realistic
prospect of succeeding on the appeal.` That was said in relation to proposed
appeals to the Court of Appeal. The same principle must apply with equal force
to appeals from the subordinate court to the High Court.  
  
**_The principles governing ordering security for costs_**

****

That compels me to consider the merits of the appeal. This in turn compels me
to state the principles which govern the exercise of the power to order
security. They are as follows:

(1) Security will not be ordered based on the mere fact that the plaintiff is
a foreigner with no address or assets within the jurisdiction. The applicant
must establish that in all the circumstances of the case it would be just to
grant the application.

(2) In considering the application, the court should be mindful of the
underlying principle on which security is ordered - that is, the plaintiff
should not be permitted to litigate on an unlikely claim and leave the
defendant with a paper judgment for costs. This means that there must be an
appreciable degree of certainty that there will a judgment for costs in favour
of the defendant. Otherwise the order for security will be purposeless and
will defeat the ends of essential justice when the plaintiff is disabled or
unable to secure the security.

(3) The court should be circumspect to ensure that the defendant`s purpose of
seeking security for costs is not to quell the plaintiff`s quest for justice.

(4) Ultimately the court should, on a broad view, weigh the merits of the
claim and defence and decide whether it would be just to order security.

**_English White Book_ ** **_Hong Kong White Book_ ** **_The decision_ **

****

Applying the principles and having regard to the facts and circumstances set
out earlier I am of the view that the plaintiff`s claim stands a high
probability of success. The defendants` application has the clear marks of an
attempt to stifle a bona fide claim.  
  
Accordingly, having regard to all the circumstances of the case it would not
be just to order security for costs. In the result, the intended appeal
against the order for security for costs has good merits. The plaintiff should
be given leave to appeal and so I do. The plaintiff in this case should have
combined the appeal against the order so that the former could be heard at
once if leave is granted. He has not done so. In the circumstances, I am
constrained to give leave and let the appeal against the order for security be
heard separately.  
  
The defendant shall pay the costs of the appeal to the district court and the
High Court.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
