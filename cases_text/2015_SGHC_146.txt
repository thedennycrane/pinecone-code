Introduction

1 These suits concern the plaintiff’s attempt to acquire an interest in a coal
mine (“the Mine”) located in Sungai Cuka in Kalimantan, Indonesia (“the
Transaction”). The Transaction was beset with difficulties and it eventually
failed despite the plaintiff having paid out more than US$3m. In Suit No 847
of 2011 (“S 847/2011”), the plaintiff is suing the counterparty to the
Transaction and his solicitor. In Suit No 846 of 2011 (“S 846/2011”), the
plaintiff is suing the solicitor and the firm that had acted for it in the
Transaction. In a nutshell, the plaintiff’s case is that it was defrauded by
the counterparty and his lawyer, and its own lawyers had failed to safeguard
its interest.

2 The trial for both suits, which were heard together, spanned a period of
slightly over a year, with three tranches and a total of 41 hearing days. It
was a deeply contentious matter with not only many disputes of facts but also
a number of legal issues, some of which have not been addressed by the
Singapore courts. At the end of the hearing, I reserved judgment. Having
considered the matter, I conclude that the plaintiff’s claims in both S
846/2011 and S 847/2011 should be dismissed in their entirety. I will set out
the factual background and issues before I give the reasons for my decision.
The table of contents that follows would hopefully aid the reader in

Factual background

The parties

3 The plaintiff in both suits is Nava Bharat (Singapore) Pte Limited (“Nava
Bharat”), a company incorporated in Singapore. It is in the business of power
generation, ferro alloys, mining and agri-business, among others.[note: 1] It
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nava Bharat Ventures Limited (“NBVL”), a
company incorporated in India[note: 2] and listed on the Indian stock
exchanges. Ashwin Devineni (“Ashwin”) is the managing director of Nava Bharat
and he was the main representative for Nava Bharat in the Transaction.[note:
3]

4 The first defendant in S 846/2011 is Straits Law Practice LLC (“SLP”), a
limited liability law corporation carrying on the practice as advocates and
solicitors in Singapore.[note: 4] The second defendant in S 846/2011 is M
Rajaram (“Rajaram”), an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of
Singapore and a senior director of SLP.[note: 5] Rajaram was appointed as Nava
Bharat’s lawyer for the Transaction.[note: 6]

5 The first defendant in S 847/2011 is Tan Beng Phiau Dicky (“Dicky Tan”), an
Indonesian businessman.[note: 7] At the time of the Transaction, Dicky Tan was
the president director and majority shareholder of PT Indoasia Cemerlang
(“PTIC”), which was the Indonesian company with the requisite mining
concessions to mine coal in the Mine.[note: 8] A mining concession is called
“Kuasa Pertambangan” in Indonesia and I shall refer to Dicky Tan’s mining
concessions in the Mine as the “KP Concessions”. Dicky Tan was served the writ
of summons on 8 March 2012,[note: 9] but he did not enter into appearance. The
plaintiff obtained default judgment against him on 26 August 2013. The second
defendant in S 847/2011 is Chidambaram Chandrasegar (“Chandra”), an advocate
and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore and a senior director of Tan
Peng Chin LLC (“TPC”).[note: 10] Chandra was appointed by Dicky Tan to act as
his lawyer in respect of the Transaction.[note: 11]

6 Given the large number of persons and entities involved in this case, I
have, for convenience, compiled a list of the names of the key persons and
entities as well as the abbreviations (if any) used in this judgment. The list
is annexed hereto as Annex A.

The chronology of events

Nava Bharat’s search for coal

7 In 2008, Nava Bharat was actively seeking to secure a regular supply of coal
for NBVL’s power generation business in India. This was because the the power
generation business in India of NBVL was expanding and there was a need to
source for coal from other countries.[note: 12]

8 Shortly prior to the Transaction, Nava Bharat had sought to acquire an
interest in another coal mine from a different party. On or about 27 September
2008, Nava Bharat entered into a memorandum of understanding for the
participatory interest in a coal mine in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia (“the
Multi Guna Transaction”).[note: 13] A sum of US$2m was paid. However the Multi
Guna Transaction was eventually called off as a result of a dispute between
the parties.[note: 14]

9 Ashwin then found out about the Mine from Bhushan Rao (“Bhushan”).[note: 15]
Bhushan was then the managing director of Agora International Trading Pte Ltd
(“Agora”), a Singapore-based trading company, whose principal activity is,
_inter alia_ , to trade in commodities.[note: 16] On or around 16 September
2008, Bhushan and N Lakshman (“Lakshman”), the then financial director of
Agora, entered into discussions with G R K Prasad (“Prasad”), the director of
financial and corporate affairs of NBVL, in relation to the Mine.[note: 17] At
that time, NBVL conducted a feasibility study on the Mine.[note: 18] There
were also preliminary discussions on the general methodology and structure for
the Transaction.[note: 19]

10 Chandra had a role in linking up Dicky Tan with Agora, a fact that was
unknown to Ashwin until after the Transaction fell through. Chandra was (and
still is) a non-executive director of Agora,[note: 20] and it was he who put
Dicky Tan, for whom he had acted in an earlier transaction, in touch with
Agora for the purpose of finding a buyer for the Mine.[note: 21] Dicky Tan
instructed Chandra around August 2008 to act for him in the Transaction.[note:
22]

11 As mentioned in [5] above, Dicky Tan was the majority shareholder of PTIC
holding 80% of the shares (with the other 20% held by Ridwan Halim as his
nominee). PTIC received the KP Concessions from another Indonesian company, PT
Batu Hitam Mulia (“PTBHM”). The KP Concessions comprised the following:

(a) A KP exploitasi licence (“KP Exploitasi Licence”) for 191.014 hectares,
expiring on 29 September 2010.

(b) A KP transportation and sale licence (“KP Transport and Sale Licence”)
relating to the KP Exploitasi Licence, expiring on 29 September 2009.

(c) A KP explorasi licence (“KP Explorasi Licence”) for 936.02 hectares, which
has expired on 20 October 2006.

12 The KP Exploitasi Licence allowed the holder to “mine and remove the coal”,
while the KP Explorasi Licence only entitled the holder to explore for coal in
the specified area.[note: 23] As the KP Concessions holder, PTIC had the
authority to conduct mining operations in the Mine. Therefore, Nava Bharat had
to negotiate with Dicky Tan in order to acquire an interest in the Mine.

13 On 18 September 2008, Chandra wrote to Agora setting out the proposed
method of the acquisition for the Mine.[note: 24] The structure envisaged by
the parties and set out in Chandra’s letter was as follows:[note: 25]

**B**. **Structure of the Shareholding and Manner of Acquisition**

1\. Coal concession is in the form of a KP Concession. Under Indonesia law,
only an Indonesian entity can own the KP Concession.

2\. However a mine operating company can be owned by a foreign entity. The
equity participation will be in this Company.

3\. Proposed Structure which is typical in a foreign participation of a KP

14 To discuss the proposed structure set out in Chandra’s letter, Chandra and
Lakshman arranged for Nava Bharat, Agora and Dicky Tan to meet on 25 September
2008 at the office of TPC.[note: 26] At the meeting, Nava Bharat was
represented by Ashwin and his father, Ashok Devineni (“Ashok”), the chairman
of the board of directors of NBVL, and Prasad, while Agora was represented by
Bhushan and Lakshman.[note: 27] It is undisputed that Nava Bharat did not have
legal representation at the meeting.[note: 28] Dicky Tan was accompanied by
his brother, Jason Tan, and his solicitor, Chandra.[note: 29]

15 Nava Bharat was informed at the meeting that a foreign company like Nava
Bharat could not own shares in the company with the KP Concessions for the
Mine.[note: 30] Instead, it was proposed that Nava Bharat hold the shares in
that company through an Indonesian nominee.[note: 31] Apart from the idea of a
nominee arrangement, the parties also discussed the commercial aspects of the
Transaction. Specifically, Ashwin was informed that the value of the company
could be fixed at US$20m based on a coal reserve of 10m metric tonnes.[note:
32] Ashwin claimed that Dicky Tan had stated categorically that “the Mine was
operational and was ready to be operated as soon as the investors moved
in”.[note: 33] Further, he alleged that Chandra, although appointed to
represent Dicky Tan, was in fact actively advising _all_ parties present at
the meeting.[note: 34] This is a major point of contention between the
parties, and I will address it later.

Appointment of Rajaram and ABNR

16 Having discussed the key commercial terms of the Transaction, Nava Bharat
decided to proceed with the Transaction and, after the meeting on 25 September
2008, indicated that it would have to appoint its own lawyers to obtain legal
advice and prepare the necessary documents to execute the Transaction.[note:
35] To this end, Nava Bharat approached Chew Chin of Baker & McKenzie.[note:
36] Chew Chin attended the meeting on 29 September 2008 with Ashwin and
Bhushan.[note: 37] At this meeting, the parties discussed the possible
structures that could be put in place for the Transaction.[note: 38]

17 Notwithstanding that, Nava Bharat eventually appointed Rajaram instead of
Chew Chin as its lawyer for the Transaction. There is no dispute that Rajaram
was recommended by Chandra.[note: 39] However, the parties do not agree on the
facts which led to Chandra’s recommendation of Rajaram. According to Nava
Bharat, Chandra told Ashwin and Bhushan immediately after the meeting that the
deal was “unlikely to progress very far” if they continued with Baker &
McKenzie, and recommended that Nava Bharat appoint Rajaram instead.[note: 40]
Chandra, on the other hand, said that Bhushan had asked him to recommend
another Singapore law firm because Nava Bharat wanted a comparison,[note: 41]
and it was in those circumstances that he recommended Rajaram to
Bhushan.[note: 42]

18 Bhushan, who was acquainted with Rajaram,[note: 43] then called the latter
to brief him on the Transaction.[note: 44] Among other things, it was made
known to Rajaram that Nava Bharat was already considering Baker &
McKenzie.[note: 45] Following the call from Bhushan, Rajaram attended the
meeting on 3 October 2008 and was introduced to Ashwin.[note: 46]

19 At around the same time, Nava Bharat was also considering which Indonesian
law firm to appoint for the Transaction. On 6 October 2008, Ashwin sent an
email to Rajaram stating that it is “important” that Indonesian lawyers would
be engaged to do the legal due diligence.[note: 47] Rajaram agreed and
provided a list of five Indonesian law firms, including Ali Budiardjo,
Nugroho, Reksodiputro (“ABNR”).[note: 48] While the parties agree that ABNR
was appointed on or about 9 October 2008,[note: 49] they disagree on _who_
appointed ABNR. Nava Bharat says it was Rajaram, while Rajaram points to Nava
Bharat.

The Heads of Agreement

20 The negotiations between Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan were already in progress
when Rajaram and ABNR were appointed.[note: 50] As mentioned earlier, Nava
Bharat and Dicky Tan met up on 25 September 2008 to discuss the proposed
structure set out in Chandra’s letter dated 18 September 2008 (see [20]
above). Following that, on 2 October 2008, Chandra sent an email to Ashwin and
Bhushan attaching the clean and marked copies of a draft document entitled
“Heads of Agreement”.[note: 51] The draft Heads of Agreement was sent to
Prasad, and he replied with his “corrections” on the same day.[note: 52]

21 A meeting was scheduled and held at ABNR’s office in Jakarta on 13 October
2008.[note: 53] Rajaram met with Woody Pananto (“Woody”) and Nafis Adwani
(“Nafis”) of ABNR, and Chandra joined them about an hour later, followed by
Dicky Tan and Ashwin later in the day.[note: 54] The Heads of Agreement was
signed by Nava Bharat, Dicky Tan and PTIC on the same day.[note: 55] As agreed
under the Heads of Agreement, Nava Bharat paid US$100,000 into the
stakeholding account of TPC.[note: 56]

22 The structure contemplated under the Heads of Agreement can be summarised
as follows:[note: 57]

(a) PTBHM, the original holder of the KP Concessions for the Mine, will
transfer the KP Concessions to PTIC.

(b) Nava Bharat, Dicky Tan and PTIC were required to procure the incorporation
of a holding company (“the Holding Company”), which would wholly own a
foreign-owned Indonesian company, also known as a Penanaman Modal Asing
company (“the PMA Company”).

(c) In the first phase of the acquisition, Nava Bharat was to acquire 15% of
the equity and effective economic interest in the Holding Company by payment
of US$3m (less deposit of US$100,000 held by TPC as stakeholders) to Dicky
Tan. Nava Bharat had the right to acquire up to 90% of the equity and
effective economic interest in the Holding Company.

(d) The PMA Company would enter into a mine operating service agreement with
PTIC. This would entitle the PMA Company to operate the Mine and extract,
transport and sell the coal to any customer.

(e) The PMA Company would enter into an off-take agreement with the Holding
Company for the supply of coal extracted from the Mine. This would oblige the
PMA Company to supply the coal extracted to the Holding Company.

(f) Nava Bharat would enter into a back-to-back off-take agreement with the
Holding Company for the supply of coal. This would oblige the Holding Company
to supply the coal extracted to Nava Bharat (which would be obtained by the
Holding Company pursuant to the off-take agreement that it was to enter into
with the PMA Company as set out above).

(g) Nava Bharat was entitled to withdraw its participation at any time within
ten months of the initial completion date stipulated in the Heads of
Agreement.

23 The 15% of the Holding Company was valued at US$3m in the following
manner:[note: 58]

(a) The only subsisting licences within the KP Concessions were the KP
Exploitasi License and the KP Transportation and Sale Licence (see [11]
above).

(b) Nava Bharat, Dicky Tan and PTIC agreed that valuation of the KP Exploitasi
License and the KP Transportation and Sale Licence was US$20m, based on Dicky
Tan’s representation that the Mine had a coal reserve of 10m metric tonnes
(cll 4.1 and 4.2 of the Heads of Agreement).

(c) 15% of the valuation of US$20m amounted to US$3m.

Due diligence and change in Indonesian mining laws

24 On 14 October 2008, the day after the Heads of Agreement was signed, Ashwin
received an email from Prasad with his comments on the Heads of
Agreement.[note: 59] Ashwin forwarded the email to Rajaram and Lakshman for
their advice.[note: 60] In Rajaram’s reply on 15 October 2008, he emphasised
that the Heads of Agreement was an “interim agreement”, and was “not intended
to encompass all the legal rights and obligations of the parties”.[note: 61]
He further listed a series of separate agreements would have to be prepared by
SLP and ABNR, and informed Ashwin that SLP would be “obtaining the inputs of
Indonesian Lawyers at all stages.”[note: 62] Ashwin responded with a short
email which simply stated “Ok ... sounds good”.[note: 63] This was conveyed to
Woody and Nafis of ABNR in Rajaram’s email which was sent on the same
day.[note: 64]

25 In the meantime, Rajaram worked on the draft agreements for the
Transaction. On 20 October 2008, Rajaram sent an email to Ashwin and Chandra
with the first draft of the agreements for their comments.[note: 65] Rajaram
also sent a separate email with the draft agreements to Woody for his
comments.[note: 66]

26 At about the same time, ABNR embarked on the due diligence checks. On 16
October 2008, Vincent Ariesta Lie (“Vincent”) of ABNR sent a list of issues
and required documents for the purpose of the due diligence exercise to Dicky
Tan and Tanakorn Pitisatien (“Tanakorn”).[note: 67] Tanakorn is Dicky Tan’s
assistant who handled his day-to-day affairs in Indonesia, including matters
related to the Mine.[note: 68] Chandra informed Vincent on the next day that
the list was sent to the wrong emails, and stated that “[a]ll emails to the
seller” should be sent to Tanakorn and Chandra.[note: 69] This led to
Rajaram’s two emails on 17 October 2008 stating that ABNR should correspond
only with him and not Chandra.[note: 70] This was acknowledged by Chandra and
ABNR.[note: 71]

27 On 26 October 2008, Woody sent an email attaching a copy of the draft due
diligence report (“ABNR’s First Draft Report”) to Rajaram.[note: 72] It was
stated in the ABNR’s First Draft Report that Dicky Tan and Ridwan Halim were
the shareholders of PTIC.[note: 73] Woody also highlighted several issues in
his email, including the fact that a lend-use permit from the Ministry of
Forestry (“Forestry Licence”) would have to be obtained before mining
operations could be carried out.[note: 74] Woody also explained the procedure
to obtain the Forestry Licence in its email.[note: 75] Despite the earlier
reminder from Rajaram (see [26] above), Chandra’s secretary was copied in
Woody’s email dated 26 October 2008. Rajaram pointed this out, and Woody
explained that the email was inadvertently copied to Chandra’s secretary on
the mistaken belief that she was one of Rajaram’s colleagues.[note: 76]

28 Rajaram forwarded the ABNR’s First Draft Report to Ashwin on 28 October
2008.[note: 77] Rajaram explained in his email that he plans to meet ABNR (and
subsequently Dicky Tan and Chandra) to discuss the matters raised in the
ABNR’s First Draft Report the next day or the day after that, and then leave
it to Ashwin to make a “commercial call”.[note: 78] The proposed meeting did
not occur as Chandra informed Rajaram that Dicky Tan would “have to make a
commercial call” on whether he wishes to proceed with the deal.[note: 79]

29 On 31 October 2008, Prasad sent an email to Rajaram requesting for a legal
opinion to confirm that the proposed structure for the Transaction was
enforceable under Indonesian law in order to satisfy the Indian banks
financing the Transaction.[note: 80] The opinion was sent to Prasad on 7
November 2008, stating that the Transaction was valid and enforceable under
Indonesian law.[note: 81]

30 On 2 December 2008, Rajaram received an email from Vincent attaching a
revised due diligence report (“ABNR’s Second Draft Report”).[note: 82]

31 Another meeting was held on 12 December 2008. Ashwin, Bhushan, Lakshman,
Rajaram, Dicky Tan and Chandra met to discuss, _inter alia_ , the transfer of
the KP Concessions, which were originally held by PTBHM, to PTIC as required
under the Heads of Agreement (see [22] above).[note: 83] Upon receiving a copy
of the transfer on 17 December 2008, Rajaram forwarded it to Woody for
verification with the relevant authorities in Indonesia.[note: 84] In the same
email, Rajaram informed Woody that Nava Bharat was “in a position to complete
the matter” and wanted a confirmation that “the title documents and all other
required permits [a]re valid and that there are no other issues that needs to
be resolved”.[note: 85]

32 On or about 16 December 2008, a new mining law was passed in Indonesia. The
next day, Prasad wrote to ABNR and Rajaram asking them to check on the impact
of the new mining law on the proposed structure for the Transaction.[note: 86]
Nafis replied on the same day pointing out that the new mining law was passed
by the House of Representatives and had not been enacted yet (since the law
will only be enacted within 30 days from the date on which the law was
passed).[note: 87] This change in the mining law essentially introduced a new
type of licence, namely, the mining business licence, also known as the Izin
Usaha Pertambangan (“IUP Licence”), but it was silent on the status of the KP
Concessions which were issued earlier.[note: 88]

33 A meeting was held on 19 December 2008. The meeting was attended by Ashwin,
Rajaram, Chandra and others.[note: 89] At this meeting, Ashwin arranged for
Mohana Sundaram Paranjothy (“Bob Sundaram”) to address the meeting _via_ tele-
conference on the issue of the Forestry Licence.[note: 90] Bob Sundaram was,
at the material time, the director of two subsidiaries of Nava Bharat (namely,
PT Nava Bharat Sungai Cuka (“NBSC”) and PT Nava Bharat Indonesia) and he was
acting as Nava Bharat’s “focal point on the ground in Indonesia”.[note: 91]
Bob Sundaram reported that the Mine had a KP Exploitasi Licence for 191.014
hectares but since the Mine was located in a convertible production forest,
also known as Hutan Produksi Konversi (“HPK Forest”), it was necessary to have
a Forestry Licence in order to operate the Mine.[note: 92] Dicky Tan and Jason
Tan then joined in the meeting _via_ tele-conference.[note: 93] At the
meeting, Dicky Tan took the position that the Forestry Licence was not
required.[note: 94] According to Rajaram, Dicky Tan threatened to “walk away
from the deal” due to Ashwin’s insistence for him to obtain the Forestry
Licence, but Ashwin eventually agreed, after some discussion, to proceed with
initial completion on the basis that Dicky Tan gave his undertaking to obtain
the Forestry Licence if it was required.[note: 95] Nava Bharat denies this.
This is a major factual dispute between the parties, and I will discuss this
point later.

34 After the meeting on 19 December 2008, Rajaram sent an email to Nafis for
ABNR’s approval on the amended draft agreements (which were attached to the
email), and for an update on the due diligence exercise.[note: 96] Shortly
after the email was sent, Nafis and Rajaram arranged to discuss the matter
over the telephone.[note: 97]

35 On the same day, Bob Sundaram sent an email to Ashwin discussing the issue
of Forestry Licence.[note: 98] This was forwarded to Rajaram.[note: 99] Ashwin
also forwarded to Rajaram a “Newsalert” prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers
Indonesia on the new mining law.[note: 100] Bob Sundaram sent another email to
Ashwin on the next day, 20 December 2008, to reiterate that the Mine is
located within the HPK Forest (such that the Forestry Licence is necessary),
and in this email, he attached a due diligence report prepared by Thamotharhan
Karupiah (“Karupiah”) to support his position.[note: 101] Karupiah was, at the
material time, the operations manager of Nava Bharat in Indonesia.[note: 102]
Bob Sundaram’s email dated 20 December 2008 with the report by Karupiah
attached was also forwarded to Rajaram.[note: 103] A few days later, on 23
December 2008, Ashwin and Prasad communicated over email on the issue of
Forestry Licence.[note: 104]

36 On 22 December 2008, ABNR sent an email to Rajaram, copied to Ashwin and
Prasad, attaching the draft due diligence report (“ABNR’s Third Draft
Report”).[note: 105] In the same email, ABNR advised on, _inter alia_ , the
possible implications of the new mining law.[note: 106] Prasad, having read
the ABNR’s Third Draft Report, raised several points and said that it is
“advisable to prepare a roadmap and indemnities before [Nava Bharat] conclude
the Agreements”.[note: 107]

37 Also on 22 December 2008, Chandra informed Rajaram that Jason Tan wanted
the agreements to be executed before Christmas, _ie_ , 25 December 2008.[note:
108] Rajaram forwarded the email to Ashwin on 24 December 2008,[note: 109] and
stated that Nava Bharat’s interest might be affected if the issues on the
validity of the structure raised by ABNR in view of the new mining law were
not resolved.[note: 110] At the same time, Rajaram wrote to Woody for his
opinion on whether a new structure was required to protect Nava Bharat’s
interest in light of the new mining law.[note: 111] Woody replied on 29
December 2008 to say that it was difficult to give a clear opinion due to the
uncertainties in the new mining law and suggested that a meeting might be
useful to discuss the issues and explore any possible alternative
structures.[note: 112] Rajaram wrote back on 30 December 2008 and proposed to
have the meeting on 5 January 2009.[note: 113] On the same day, Rajaram and
Ashwin met to discuss on the possibility of using an alternative structure for
the Transaction.[note: 114]

Changes to the structure for the Transaction

38 Notwithstanding that there was mention of calling off the deal in early
January 2009, Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan decided to go back to negotiations. On
12 January 2009, the parties met.[note: 115] At the meeting, Ashwin requested
to “keep the communication lines open” so that they can resolve any problems
“by discussion rather than by coming to unilateral decisions”.[note: 116] In
particular, it was noted in the minutes of the meeting that Rajaram and
Chandra would work on the agreements to “meet the new revised circumstances”
and the new completion date would be determined upon receiving ABNR’s
approval.[note: 117]

39 Dicky Tan also informed the meeting that the jetty facilities were owned by
PTBHM and he was in the process of procuring the transfer of the ownership
over to another one of his companies, namely, PT Adiperkasa Ekabakti Industry
(“PTAEI”).[note: 118] Later that day, Prasad sent an email to Ashwin stating
that Rajaram should ask Dicky Tan to include the jetty facilities as an
integral element to the Mine and give a revised legal opinion in light of the
new mining law.[note: 119]

40 On 15 January 2009, Chandra wrote to Lakshman and copied to Bhushan, Ashwin
and Rajaram, to inform them that “the deal is on”, and that Dicky Tan was
“bending backwards to make the deal happen”.[note: 120] Chandra also
emphasised in the same email that the deal must be closed by the following
week with “a definite date given to all parties”.[note: 121] Rajaram responded
to Chandra’s email stating that it was Nava Bharat that was bending backwards
to accommodate Dicky Tan, and that he would be sending out the proposed new
structure later that day.[note: 122] The proposed new structure in Rajaram’s
email dated 15 January 2009 can be summarised as follows:[note: 123]

(a) There would be a loan agreement between Nava Bharat and PTIC/PTAEI for the
sum of US$4.5m. All the shares in PTIC and PTAEI would be pledged to Nava
Bharat as security for the loan.

(b) The ownership of the jetty facilities will be transferred from PTBHM to
PTAEI within four weeks of the initial completion date.

(c) PTAEI would be converted to a PMA company within four weeks of the
acquisition of the jetty facilities.

(d) The failure to acquire the jetty facilities or convert PTAEI into a PMA
company within the stipulated time would constitute an event of default.

(e) If the new mining law permits foreign ownership of the Mine, then Nava
Bharat shall have the option of converting its entire loan into an equity
interest in PTIC.

(f) In the event of default, Nava Bharat would have the option of recovering
its loan by way of an off-take agreement at an agreed price to be determined.

41 The next day, Rajaram wrote to Woody to ask for advice on the legality of
the proposed new structure and the due diligence in respect of the jetty
facilities which were due to be submitted.[note: 124] Rajaram also asked for
the final due diligence report and ABNR’s advice on the final documentation to
be in place for the proposed new structure.[note: 125] On the same day,
Rajaram wrote to Chandra objecting to Dicky Tan’s demand for the Transaction
to be completed before the Chinese New Year, _ie_ , 26 January 2009.[note:
126]

42 On 18 January 2009, Woody wrote to Rajaram and Chandra stating, in essence,
that while the proposed new structure in Rajaram’s email dated 15 January 2009
was generally feasible, it might be difficult for PTBHM to transfer the jetty
facilities to PTAEI because the primary business of PTAEI was in the field of
“industry” and not coal mining.[note: 127] Rajaram noticed that Woody’s email
was sent to Chandra despite his previous instructions not to do so (see [26]
above), and he sent an email to remind ABNR that all correspondence should be
addressed only to him (and not Chandra).[note: 128] Woody’s email on 18
January 2009 was forwarded by Ashwin to Bob Sundaram.[note: 129] In response,
Bob Sundaram said that they are also preparing a “comprehensive due diligence
report” and asked Ashwin to review the reports separately so that the report
by ABNR can be “scrutinized”.[note: 130] On 20 January 2009, Bob Sundaram sent
the due diligence report prepared by Karupiah to Ashwin and copied to
Rajaram.[note: 131] As a result of the uncertainty in relation to the transfer
of the jetty facilities to PTAEI, Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan decided to proceed
with a loan amount of US$3m as opposed to the original sum of US$4.5m (of
which US$1.5m was meant to be consideration for the transfer of the jetty
facilities).[note: 132] Accordingly, the pledge for the loan would only cover
the shares of PTIC and not PTAEI.[note: 133]

43 Sometime in January 2009, Rajaram, Chandra and ABNR worked on the draft
agreements for the Transaction. On 19 January 2009, Chandra sent an email to
Rajaram with a series of agreements attached to it.[note: 134] On 20 January
2009, Woody sent an email to Rajaram, attaching templates for the pledge of
shares agreements, the power of attorney to sell the shares in PTIC and the
power of attorney to vote in PTIC (“the Pledge Documents”).[note: 135] Rajaram
then sent a copy of the draft master agreement (“Master Agreement”) and draft
Loan Agreement for ABNR’s input.[note: 136] To ensure that everyone was “on
the same page”, Rajaram sent a schematic diagram of the proposed new structure
for the Transaction to Woody for his input on the legality of the structure in
the context of Indonesian law,[note: 137] and to Prasad and Ashwin for their
comments in the context of the financing scheme.[note: 138] A copy was sent to

44 Woody, in his reply on the same day, expressed the view that, subject to
certain assumptions and qualifications mainly in relation to the new mining
law, the “transaction structure would work”.[note: 141] He also pointed out
that the schematic diagram by Rajaram showed that the debtor for the Loan
Agreement should have been PTIC, instead of Dicky Tan as stated in the draft
Loan Agreement which was sent.[note: 142]

45 On 21 January 2009, Rajaram met with Chandra to finalise the draft
agreements for the Transaction.[note: 143] After the meeting, Rajaram sent the
draft agreements to Ashwin and Prasad for their review and input.[note: 144]
Both Ashwin and Prasad gave their comments on the draft agreements on the same
day.[note: 145] At the same time, Rajaram sent the draft agreements to ABNR
for their review and liaised with Chandra on the outstanding issues.[note:
146] In Rajaram’s email to Chandra, he stated that:[note: 147]

Gopalan, leela and shiny are scrubbing the agreements and would let you have
[the] finalised versions later tonight.

I will also be sending the documents to my clients and ABNR. Assuming that
there are no further amendments the signing could probably be done tom.

The other option will be for the clients to execute the agreement and hope
that ABNR is prepared to sign off a decent opinion.

Whilst my clients and I have bent backwards to accommodate your clients’ time
frame, I cannot advise release until ABNR issues their opinion. I will be
talking to them again later and tom morning.

46 On the same day, at 11.20pm, Rajaram sent the draft agreements for the
Transaction to Chandra, Ashwin and ABNR.[note: 148] These include the draft
agreements that were supposed to be signed the next day, namely, the Master
Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the Pledge Documents.[note: 149] In the
email, Rajaram had also asked ABNR to check that the “Indonesian Documents”
were in accordance with Indonesian law.[note: 150]

Indonesian leg of the initial completion

47 On the morning of 22 January 2009, at 7.22am, Woody sent an email to
Rajaram stating that ABNR was still “not fully clear” about the structure for
the Transaction.[note: 151] In particular, ABNR’s email highlighted the issue
with the identity of the debtor for the Loan Agreement (which it had raised
previously, see [44] above):[note: 152]

1 In the chart provided earlier and based [on] our discussion last week, we
understand that the debtor of the loan from NB should be PT IC, not Dicky.

2 We note from the draft loan provided that the debtor is Dicky. We believe it
is more appropriate if the debtor is PT IC, not Dicky, and Dicky will create
pledge over its shares in PT IC or personal guarantee to secure the loan to PT
IC. The loan of NB to PT IC can be converted into shares. This conversion
right of loan into shares in PT IC may not work if the debtor is Dicky. Would
you please urgently confirm the agreed structure so that we can provide our
comments soon this morning?

...

48 At 8.30am, Rajaram responded to the queries raised by Woody in his earlier
emails (see [44] and [47] above):[note: 153]

Apologies for not alerting you on change.

Let me explain. The original transaction was to purchase Dicky’s share through
a designated party. Due to the changes in the Mining Laws and advised by you,
this would not be possible. We therefore structured a pledged loan in place.
DT is pledging his shares to obtain the loan and he is personally liable for
the loan. He is not guaranteeing this loan. He is only guaranteeing the off
take performance of PTIC.

DT needs the money for the expenses incurred in getting the transfer and to
pay for jetty and the road works, the jetty has to be completed within 5
months on pain of LD agreed at USD 33,000 per day f [_sic_] delay. If monies
are paid to PTIC, he cannot use it for the purposes stated. This was very much
discussed and deliberated wit [_sic_] DT’s lawyers before we decided on the
change.

In terms of conversion, this is provided for in the Master Agreement.

...

Trust that your queries have been answered and look forward to an urgent
response. As explained in this morning’s earlier email, the deal will be
jeopardized if we do not complete by tomorrow. Whist [_sic_] the documents are
been [_sic_] notarized today, I will only advise clients to realize after
receipt of your opinion.

The parties are contemplating executing the agreement today at 11 in Jakarta
and have made arrangements with a Notary public. Could you please let me have
the amended documents urgently before that? Again, sorry for the rush but both
parties have decided on commercial basis to proceed.

49 On 22 January 2009, at about 12.00pm (Jakarta time), the following
agreements (“the Security Documents”), which were governed by Indonesian law,
were executed by the parties, with Bob Sundaram signing on behalf of Nava
Bharat:[note: 154]

(a) The loan agreement between Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan, which recorded Nava
Bharat’s loan of US$3m to Dicky Tan (“the Loan Agreement”).

(b) The pledge of shares agreement between Nava Bharat, Ridwan Halim and PTIC,
in which Ridwan Halim agreed to pledge all of his shares in PTIC to Nava
Bharat as security for the due performance of Dicky Tan’s obligations and
liabilities under, _inter alia_ , the Loan Agreement.

(c) The pledge of shares agreement between Nava Bharat, Dicky Tan and PTIC, in
which Dicky Tan agreed to pledge all of his shares in PTIC to Nava Bharat as
security for the due performance of Dicky Tan’s obligations and liabilities
under, _inter alia_ , the Loan Agreement.

(d) The irrevocable power of attorney to vote shares between Nava Bharat and
Ridwan Halim, which conferred upon Nava Bharat the right to vote in PTIC (with
respect to Ridwan Halim’s shares).

(e) The irrevocable power of attorney to vote shares between Nava Bharat and
Dicky Tan, which conferred upon Nava Bharat the right to vote in PTIC (with
respect to Dicky Tan’s shares).

(f) The irrevocable power of attorney to sell shares between Nava Bharat and
Ridwan Halim, which conferred upon Nava Bharat the right to sell Ridwan
Halim’s shares in PTIC in the event that Dicky Tan defaulted on his
obligations under, _inter alia_ , the Loan Agreement.

(g) The irrevocable power of attorney to sell shares between Nava Bharat and
Dicky Tan, which conferred upon Nava Bharat the right to sell Dicky Tan’s
shares in PTIC in the event that Dicky Tan defaulted on his obligations under,
_inter alia_ , the Loan Agreement.

50 The next day, Woody sent Rajaram a copy of ABNR’s draft opinion on the
agreements, and stated that he will send the draft opinion on the structure
later.[note: 155] Prasad wrote to ABNR on the same day stating that the
opinion should cover the issue of whether Nava Bharat or its nominee has the
authority to mine, sell and export coal from Indonesia.[note: 156] This was to
satisfy Nava Bharat’s lender for the Transaction.[note: 157] Rajaram assured
Prasad that he would look into it.[note: 158] This was followed by an exchange
of emails between Rajaram and ABNR on the requirement of Nava Bharat’s
lender.[note: 159]

Singapore leg of the initial completion

51 On 28 January 2009, ABNR issued its opinion on the structure of the
Transaction and its opinion on the Loan Agreement together with the pledge of
shares agreements and powers of attorney (“ABNR’s Advice on Structure” and
“ABNR’s Advice on Loan Agreement” respectively).[note: 160]

52 It was originally agreed that the documents for the Singapore leg of the
initial completion would be signed at 4.00pm,[note: 161] but Rajaram asked for
an extension of time because ABNR’s opinions were not ready yet.[note: 162]
After receiving the ABNR’s Advice on Structure and the ABNR’s Advice on Loan
Agreement (see [51] above), Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan executed the following
documents at SLP’s office:[note: 163]

(a) The master agreement, which sets out the framework for Nava Bharat’s
participation in the Holding Company (_ie_ , Indo Coal Ventures Pte Ltd[note:
164]) and the PMA Company (_ie_ , NBSC[note: 165]) (“the Master Agreement”).

(b) The mine operating service agreement, which provides for the appointment
of the PMA Company as PTIC’s mining operator (“the Mine Operating Service
Agreement”).

(c) The personal guarantee of Dicky Tan, under which Dicky Tan guaranteed to
pay and satisfy Nava Bharat on demand as principal debtor all amounts due and
owing under the Loan Agreement.

(d) The corporate guarantee of Saraburi Resources Pte Ltd (“Saraburi”) (_ie_ ,
one of Dicky Tan’s companies), under which Saraburi guaranteed to pay and
satisfy Nava Bharat on demand as principal debtor all amounts due and owing
under the Loan Agreement.

(e) The option to purchase shares agreement dated 28 January 2009, which
granted Nava Bharat an option to purchase the shares in PTAEI.

(f) The Holding Company off-take agreement, under which PTIC agreed to sell
and the Holding Company agreed to buy all of the coal extracted from the Mine
for a period of ten years (“the Holding Company Off-take Agreement”).

(g) The Nava Bharat off-take agreement, under which Nava Bharat agreed to buy
all coal supplied to the Holding Company under the Holding Company Off-take
Agreement for a period of ten years.

53 Thereafter, pursuant to cl 14.1 of the Master Agreement, Ashwin made
arrangements for US$2.9m to be released to Dicky Tan.[note: 166] Dicky Tan
authorised the payment to be made by way of two cheques: a cheque of US$1.7m
in the name of Jason Tan and a cheque of US$1.2m in the name of
Saraburi.[note: 167] The remaining US$100,000, which was held by TPC as
stakeholders (see [21] above), was also released to Dicky Tan.[note: 168]

After initial completion

54 On 29 January 2009, a day after the initial completion, Ashwin sent an
email to various parties, including Chandra and Rajaram, in which he stated
that even though the process took “longer than expected”, it was “much needed
for us to feel safe and secure, and run our operations without fear”.[note:
169] On the same day, Rajaram wrote to Ashwin and Prasad:[note: 170]

As you know, the transaction was completed yesterday on an Initial Completion
Date basis. This was after much modification to the documentations as a result
of the New Mining Laws, the uncertainties caused by the laws and the way the
provisions are going to be implemented and the various reservations we
received from our Indonesian Lawyers – ABNR.

There was also pressure to meet the deadline. Some of the documents were not
ready but the sellers (Dicky Tan) was not prepared to consider the inadequacy
of his own documentation and still insisted on completion on dates dictated by
him. To meet the deadline, we had to complete even though the documentations
were not complete. We got a Solicitor’s undertaking from TPC to let us have
the documents within 7 days.

I will let you have the complete set of documents soon. ...

I will also let you have my legal opinion, incorporating the opinion of ABNR
but targeted to meet the needs of [Prasad], who is negotiating the financial
package from the Bankers.

55 On the same day, Rajaram circulated a closing agenda in respect of the
Transaction to the parties, including Ashwin.[note: 171] At around the same
time, Rajaram also worked towards finalising a legal opinion which was meant
for the lender that was financing the Transaction.[note: 172] The arrangement
was that NBVL would borrow from the lender and then channel the funds for the
Transaction to Nava Bharat.[note: 173] Prasad requested that the legal opinion
cover, _inter alia_ , the structure of the Transaction, the enforceability of
the structure under Indonesian law and whether Nava Bharat could hypothecate
its rights to the lender as security.[note: 174] A draft opinion was sent to
Ashwin and Prasad in the evening on 29 January 2009.[note: 175] Rajaram
continued to work on the opinion that he had sent to Ashwin and Prasad on 29
January 2009.[note: 176] On 6 February 2009, Rajaram issued a legal opinion on
the validity of the structure of the Transaction (“SLP’s Advice on
Structure”).[note: 177]

Delay in obtaining the Forestry Licence

56 On 2 February 2009, Rajaram sent an email to Chandra requesting for an
update on the issue regarding the Forestry Licence.[note: 178] Chandra replied
a day later stating that the Forestry Licence was a condition subsequent that
would be obtained if it was required.[note: 179]

57 On 3 Feburary 2009, Ashwin received news from Lakshman, who visited the
Mine with Bob Sundaram, that the equipment of a contractor of an adjoining
mine was confiscated because they did not have the Forestry Licence.[note:
180] Lakshman also stated that Tanakorn had maintained that the Forestry
Licence was not required.[note: 181] Having received this email from Lakshman
as well, Rajaram wrote to Chandra asking him to “impress upon Dicky that he
has represented that all approvals for mining are in place”.[note: 182]
Chandra acknowledged.[note: 183]

58 A few days later, on 6 February 2009, Ashwin met with Dicky Tan.[note: 184]
Following the meeting, Ashwin sent an email to Chandra and Rajaram to inform
them that he had instructed Nava Bharat’s Indonesian team to “do the upmost to
start extracting coal ASAP” and that he hoped to start by “mid to end of
March”.[note: 185]

59 In anticipation of commencing mining operations, Nava Bharat’s Indonesian
team took steps to engage mining contractors.[note: 186] On 11 February 2009,
Bob Sundaram sent a draft coal mining agreement to Ashwin (“the draft Coal
Mining Agreement”).[note: 187] For this, Bob Sundaram sought the advice of
Rajaram.[note: 188] Bob Sundaram also approached Susanto, Rajasa & Associates,
an Indonesian law firm, to advise on the enforceability of the draft Coal
Mining Agreement.[note: 189]

60 To ensure that Nava Bharat would be extracting coal from the Mine by early
April 2009 (instead of the original plan for “mid to end of March” (see [58]
above)), Ashwin wrote to Nava Bharat’s Indonesian team (headed by Bob
Sundaram) on 2 March 2009 to request for a weekly update and tele-
conference.[note: 190] Ashwin received the first weekly update on 10 March
2009, which highlighted, _inter alia_ , that the Forestry Licence was required
before the mining operations can commence.[note: 191] Ashwin forwarded the
first weekly report to Rajaram and said that they need to clarify the issue
with Dicky Tan as soon as possible.[note: 192] Ashwin proposed a meeting
before the end of the week to address the issue.[note: 193] Rajaram wrote to
Chandra on the next day asking for a meeting to be convened.[note: 194] Later
in the day, Rajaram sent another email to Chandra stating, _inter alia_ , that
“an urgent meeting [was] imperative”.[note: 195] Ashwin wanted to meet on the
same week, while Dicky Tan was only able to meet on Friday (_ie_ , 13 March
2009) in Jakarta or the following Monday (_ie_ , 16 March 2009) in
Singapore.[note: 196] On 12 March 2009, Rajaram wrote to Chandra (not copied
to Ashwin) to reiterate the issue of the Forestry Licence and to ask Chandra
to urge Dicky Tan to remedy the situation as soon as possible.[note: 197]
Chandra replied that a meeting was being arranged.[note: 198] Rajaram then
explained that he was aware that a meeting was being arranged but wrote the
email so that Dicky Tan would know about the issue and attend to it, if
possible, before the meeting with Ashwin.[note: 199] Even though Dicky Tan
could not make it, a meeting (attended by Ashwin, Chandra, Rajaram, Bhushan
and Lakshman) was convened on 12 March 2009.[note: 200] During the meeting, it
was agreed that a Forestry Licence had to be obtained.[note: 201] It was
disclosed that an application for the Forestry Licence was made in the name of
PTBHM and the application was still being processed.[note: 202] It was also
recorded in the minutes of the meeting that Dicky Tan had made arrangements
for the Forestry Licence to be transferred to PTIC once it has been
issued.[note: 203]

61 The next meeting was fixed on 16 March 2009. This was attended by Ashwin,
Bhushan, Dicky Tan, Chandra, Rajaram and Tanakorn.[note: 204] At the meeting,
Dicky Tan explained that the delay in obtaining the Forestry Licence was
because he was “out of funds”, but assured Ashwin that the Forestry Licence
would be obtained soon.[note: 205] To resolve the issue, Nava Bharat expressed
that it was willing to provide an advance of the monies required to procure
the Forestry Licence, subject to the approval of its board of directors.[note:
206] The handwritten minutes of the meeting was typed out and sent to Ashwin
and Bhushan by way of email dated 20 March 2009.[note: 207]

62 To follow up, on 23 March 2009, Chandra sent an email to Rajaram
elaborating on the timing and fees involved for obtaining the Forestry
Licence:[note: 208]

Option A

Forestry Licence Fee: US$500,000

Advance: US$250,000

Timing: 1 to 2 months. Possibility of 1 month is great if the 50 per cent is
disbursed expeditiously

Option B

Dicky feels that the officials may be taking advantage of the situation as
Tanakorn is pressing them too hard. The impression given to the officials is
that Dicky is desperate and therefore the fee has been somewhat inflated.

Dicky’s suggestion is to let him start work on the mine immediately for a
period of 4 months. He will finance the cost of the forestry licence fee
himself from the income from the mines. He has indicated that the licence
would be obtained by the end of the 4 month period.

During the 4 month period, profits will be shared 85% to 15%. At the end of
the 4 month period, NB can take over the mine or continue with the existing
contractor and NB will enjoy 100% of the profits with Dicky’s entitlement
restricted to 85% of US$12, that is, the SPK Arrangements will fall in place
at the end of the 4 month period.

Please let me know how we may proceed further on this.

63 Rajaram and Chandra arranged for a meeting at SLP’s office on the next day
to discuss the issue of the Forestry Licence.[note: 209] During the meeting on
24 March 2009, Dicky Tan explained that with sufficient funds he should be
able to obtain the Forestry Licence within two to three months.[note: 210] It
was eventually agreed that Dicky Tan would start mining immediately (without
the Forestry Licence) for a period of four months.[note: 211] In addition,
Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan would share profits during the four-month period and
Dicky Tan would obtain the Forestry Licence (through the profits he would
receive throughout the period) by the end of the four-month period.[note: 212]
Dicky Tan would not be entitled to the profits during the four-month period if
he failed to obtain the Forestry Licence within four months.[note: 213]

64 After the meeting, Chandra sent an email to Rajaram setting out the points
that were discussed and, in particular, the plan to have an agreement to vary
the Master Agreement (“the Variation Agreement”) in order to reflect the
arrangement agreed upon during the meeting.[note: 214]

65 The parties met again on 25 March 2009. Rajaram was not able to attend but
arranged for Narayanan Sreenivasan (“Sreenivasan”), the managing director of
SLP, to assist on the matter in his absence.[note: 215] At the meeting, it was
reiterated that the parties have agreed to enter into the Variation
Agreement.[note: 216] It was further agreed that the mining operations during
the four-month period would be conducted in accordance with the plan drafted
by Nava Bharat’s staff, Vishvanathan (“the Mining Plan”).[note: 217] Chandra
sent a first draft of the Variation Agreement in the evening and Sreenivasan
responded with his comments which were expressly subject to the approval of
Rajaram and Nava Bharat.[note: 218]

66 The Variation Agreement was executed by the parties on 26 March 2009.[note:
219] The key terms of the Variation Agreement are as follows:[note: 220]

**3**. **PERMIT TO USE FORESTRY AREA**

3.1 [PTIC] shall on or before [four calendar months after the date of this
Agreement, _ie_ , 26 July 2009] procure the issue of a valid and subsisting
[Forestry Licence] in the name of [PTIC].

...

3.3 If [PTIC] fails to obtain the [Forestry Licence] on or before [26 July
2009], [PTIC]’s profit entitlement as set out in _clause 5_ shall cease with
effect from [four calendar months after the date of this Agreement, _ie_ , 26
July 2009] and Nava Bharat shall be entitled to 100% of the Coal Net Profits
from the sale of Coal produced from the Agreed Area.

...

**5**. **SALE OF COAL AND PROFIT SHARING**

5.7 The Coal Net Profits in respect of each metric ton of Coal sold shall be
shared in the manner set out below:

[PTIC] = 50%

Nava Bharat = 50%

...

67 On 26 March 2009, Bob Sundaram informed Ashwin that he had found a contact
who claimed that he could assist in obtaining the Forestry Licence within two
to three weeks with a total cost of US$100,000.[note: 221] On Ashwin’s
instructions _via_ an email dated 27 March 2009, Rajaram forwarded this
message to Dicky Tan (through Chandra).[note: 222] Chandra replied on 2 April
2009 informing that Dicky Tan had decided that he would “use [his] own
contacts” and did not require the help of Bob Sundaram.[note: 223] Following
that, Rajaram sent an email to Chandra stating that it was Dicky Tan’s “sole
obligation to procure the [Forestry Licence].[note: 224] Shortly before that,
Ashwin had sent an email to Bob Sundaram asking him not to get involved in the
procurement of the Forestry Licence.[note: 225]

68 On 21 April 2009, Dicky Tan on behalf of PTIC took up a loan of US$200,000
from Belfield International (Hong Kong) Limited (“Belfield”) for “working
capital requirements” (“the Belfield Loan”).[note: 226] According to Chandra,
Dicky Tan had told him that the sum was used to procure the Forestry
Licence,[note: 227] and that the loan was eventually repaid in full.[note:
228]

69 On 12 May 2009, Rajaram wrote to Chandra pointing out that the Variation
Agreement was concluded to enable Dicky Tan to obtain the Forestry Licence,
“an issue that was not deliberated and attended to at the Initial Completion
Date”, and requesting that Dicky Tan provide a “detailed progress
report”.[note: 229] At that time, Dicky Tan had commenced mining operations at
the Mine, and Rajaram emphasised in his email that Ashwin needed the progress
report to facilitate his planning and mobilisation of resources for the mining
operations.[note: 230] Chandra’s response came on 20 May 2009.[note: 231] In
his email, Chandra assured Rajaram that the Forestry Licence was “well on
track” and that Dicky Tan was “very confident that he [would] be able to swing
it by the first week of July or thereabouts”.[note: 232] Chandra’s response
was forwarded to Ashwin.[note: 233]

70 As mentioned earlier (see [65] above), Dicky Tan was supposed to extract
coal from the Mine in accordance with the Mining Plan. However, Bob Sundaram
visited the site on 19 and 20 May 2009 and discovered that Dicky Tan had not
acted in accordance with the Mining Plan.[note: 234] Nava Bharat’s Indonesian
team then prepared a site visit report and an incident report which was sent
to Rajaram on 26 May 2009.[note: 235] Ashwin, through Rajaram, requested for a
meeting with Dicky Tan and Chandra to resolve the matter.[note: 236]
Accordingly, Rajaram sent an email to Chandra to inform him of Ashwin’s
concerns and asked for a meeting to be arranged.[note: 237] This led to the
meeting on 4 June 2009.[note: 238]

71 The meeting of 4 June 2009 was attended by Ashwin, Bob Sundaram and Dicky
Tan, among others.[note: 239] Dicky Tan explained that the delay was because
“the guy they used earlier could not deliver”, but added that he had found a
“direct contact” who could get the Forestry Licence within a month even though
it will “cost more”.[note: 240] Ashwin proposed that Nava Bharat could
reimburse the cost of procuring the Forestry Licence and have the reimbursed
amount credited towards equity contribution to the Mine.[note: 241] Dicky Tan
agreed and asked for a contract to be drafted to reflect this
arrangement.[note: 242] However, Dicky Tan later said that he would obtain the
“in [principle] approval letter from the Forest Ministry rather than the final
licence”, and indicated that mining work could commence legally after the
approval-in-principle (“AIP”).[note: 243] Nava Bharat’s Indonesian team
disagreed and said that they would have to verify the information provided by
Dicky Tan.[note: 244]

72 One day after the meeting, Ashwin wrote to inform Chandra, Rajaram,
Lakshman and Jason Tan of Nava Bharat’s findings on the AIP.[note: 245] A
check was done with the Forestry Minister’s office and it was confirmed that
the AIP is a letter containing a list of obligations which must be fulfilled
before the Forestry Licence could be issued, and that it would not be possible
to commence mining legally with just the AIP.[note: 246] As such, Ashwin
insisted that they stick to the arrangement under the Variation Agreement,
_ie_ , for Dicky Tan to obtain the Forestry Licence by the end of the four-
month period.[note: 247]

73 On 12 June 2009, Ashwin, having been briefed by Bob Sundaram, wrote to
Rajaram to ask for a meeting with Dicky Tan as the situation was “going from
bad to worse”.[note: 248] Rajaram then wrote to Chandra expressing Ashwin’s
concerns and requesting for an urgent meeting to resolve the matter.[note:
249] As a result, Dicky Tan, Chandra, Ashwin and Rajaram met on 23 June
2009.[note: 250] Rajaram asked Dicky Tan to provide a firm deadline by which
he would obtain the Forestry Licence, and Nava Bharat would not hesitate to
exercise its right to exit from the Transaction if the deadline was not
met.[note: 251] Dicky Tan assured that he would obtain the AIP by 30 July
2009.[note: 252] In response, Ashwin stated that Nava Bharat would exercise
the exit option if the Forestry Licence was not obtained by 30 July
2009.[note: 253]

74 The next day, Chandra wrote to Rajaram suggesting several modifications to
the proposals made during the 23 June 2009 meeting.[note: 254] According to
the email, Dicky Tan would obtain the AIP by 30 July 2009, and following, that
Nava Bharat will pay to PTIC a sum of US$1m which would be credited as an
equity contribution.[note: 255] After that, Dicky Tan would continue to take
steps to obtain the Forestry Licence, and Nava Bharat shall have the right to
exercise its exit option if the Forestry Licence was not obtained within six
months from the issue date of the AIP.[note: 256]

75 On 29 June 2009, Dicky Tan met with Ashwin and others to discuss the issue
of the Forestry Licence.[note: 257] Ashwin refused to take control of the Mine
until the Forestry Licence has been obtained.[note: 258] Dicky Tan then
assured that the Forestry Licence would be obtained by the end of July
2009.[note: 259] It was again stated that if the Forestry Licence was not
obtained by the end of July 2009 as Dicky Tan had promised, then Nava Bharat
would seriously consider exercising its exit option.[note: 260] The next day,
Chandra sent an email to Rajaram setting out the issues that were discussed
during the meeting and the proposals arising from those discussions.[note:
261] Rajaram responded with the comments from Ashwin and Bhushan.[note: 262]
Following this, Ashwin met Rajaram, Chandra, Bhushan and Lakshman on 1 July
2009 to discuss the points listed in Chandra’s email.[note: 263]

76 On 15 July 2009, Chandra provided Rajaram with an update on the status of
the various licences and approvals that had to be obtained or renewed, such as
the KP Transportation and Sale Licence (see [11] above) and the AIP.[note:
264] In his response, Rajaram asked for acknowledgement from the government
bodies that they have received the letters which were attached to Chandra’s
email.[note: 265] As requested, Chandra sent an email to Rajaram on 28 July
2009 attaching the various letters from Dicky Tan to the government bodies and
their responses.[note: 266]

77 Rajaram further requested that Chandra send him a draft supplemental
agreement to vary the Master Agreement as soon as possible because Ashwin
wanted to sign it before 17 July 2009.[note: 267] On 21 July 2009, Chandra
sent a copy of the draft supplemental agreement to Rajaram.[note: 268] This
was forwarded to Ashwin who replied with his comments on 24 July 2009.[note:
269]

78 Four months after the Variation Agreement was signed (see [66] above),
there was no sign of the Forestry Licence or the AIP.

First Notice of Default

79 On 31 July 2009, Rajaram wrote to Chandra on the various defaults by Dicky
Tan (“the First Notice of Default”).[note: 270]

80 On 3 August 2009, Chandra wrote to Rajaram to ask for an extension of one
month to obtain the AIP.[note: 271] Rajaram responded, stating that Nava
Bharat was agreeable to the extension of time on certain conditions:[note:
272]

...

In spite of al [_sic_] these defaults and in an effort to try and save the
transaction without the need to litigate, our clients are prepared to give the
requested one month extension on the following terms and conditions:

1 This is the final extension and all required licenses will be obtained
before 31st August 2009;

2 The obligation to produce coal set out in the 1st Variation Agreement
continues;

3 All of our client’s rights in the matter, including rights under the Master
Agreement, the 1st Variation Agreement, the oral and written representations
in the various meetings and exchange of emails are expressly reserved.

We trust that your client’s [_sic_] will fulfill [_sic_] their commitment to
obtain the licenses by the end of this month, 31st August 2009.

81 In an email from Bhushan to Ashwin dated 13 August 2009, which was
forwarded to Rajaram, it was stated that Dicky Tan had suggested, with a view
to resolving the issues, certain changes to the arrangement in return for a
reduction in the overall valuation of the Mine by US$1m.[note: 273]

82 On 19 August 2009, Chandra forwarded a “copy of the AIP” to Rajaram, and
explained that the original will be issued “within 3 weeks from release of
moneys”.[note: 274] The representatives of Nava Bharat and PTIC, including Bob
Sundaram and Tanakorn, met on the next day to discuss, _inter alia_ , the
AIP.[note: 275] Tanakorn explained that the AIP was “in place and waiting for
the Minister to sign”.[note: 276] He also added that the Minister will be back
on 4 September 2009 and PTIC had fulfilled all of the requirements for the
issuance of the AIP.[note: 277]

Addendum Agreement and Supplemental Master Agreement

83 Between 25 and 27 August 2009, Rajaram and Chandra worked on the drafts for
the agreements to reflect the arrangement discussed between Ashwin and Dicky
Tan (see [80]-[81] above).[note: 278] On 25 August 2009, Ashwin sent an email
to Rajaram setting out his comments on the draft agreements.[note: 279] On 28
August 2009, Nava Bharat, Dicky Tan and PTIC executed the agreements, namely
the supplemental master agreement (“Supplemental Master Agreement”) and the
addendum agreement (“Addendum Agreement”).[note: 280]

84 The key terms of the Supplemental Master Agreement, which varied the Master
Agreement, are as follows:[note: 281]

**2** **REDUCTION OF VALUATION OF KP CONCESSIONS**

2.1 With effect from the date hereof, [PTIC] and [Dicky Tan] hereby agree that
the valuation of the KP Concessions shall be reduced from US$20,000,000 to
US$19,000,000.

...

4 Waiver OF CLAIMS

4.1 In consideration of [PTIC] and [Dicky Tan] agreeing to the reduction of
the valuation of KP Concession from US$20,000,000 to US$19,000,000, Nava
Bharat agrees not to make any claim or institute any proceedings (legal or
otherwise) against [PTIC] and [Dicky Tan] for any breaches under the Master
Agreement and the Variation Agreement relating to the failure of [PTIC] and
[Dicky Tan] to obtain the [Forestry Licence] and failure to deliver the Coal
in accordance with the Master Agreement and the Variation Agreement PROVIDED
THAT the [Forestry Licence] is issued in form and substance acceptable to Nava
Bharat on or before the Final Deadline [_ie_ , the date falling 4 months after
the date of issue of the AIP].

4.2 In consideration of [PTIC] and [Dicky Tan] agreeing to the reduction of
the valuation of the KP Concession from US$20,000,000 to US$19,000,000, Nava
Bharat shall waive in full all claims (including claims for loss of profits),
losses, expenses and damages whatsoever and howsoever incurred by Nava Bharat
as a result of breaches committed by [PTIC] and [Dicky Tan] under the Master
Agreement and Variation Agreement relating to the failure to obtain the
[Forestry Licence] and the failure to deliver coal in accordance with the
Master Agreement and the Variation Agreement PROVIDED THAT the [Forestry
Licence] is issued in form and substance acceptable to Nava Bharat on or
before the Final Deadline [_ie_ , the date falling 4 months after the date of
issue of the AIP]. Nava Bharat expressly secures its rights in respect to all
other breaches

...

85 The key terms of the Addendum Agreement, which varied the Variation
Agreement, are as follows:[note: 282]

**3**. **ESCROW ACCOUNT**

3.1 Following appointment by [PTIC] of a reputable mining contractor
acceptable to Nava Bharat for a period not exceeding 6 months from the date
thereof, Nava Bharat shall:

(i) pay a sum of US$250,000 to [PTIC] to part finance the costs of obtaining
the AIP; and

(ii) deposit the Security Deposit [_ie_ , the sum of US$500,000] in the Escrow

...

**4**. **ISSUE OF AIP**

4.1 [PTIC] shall on or before the AIP Final Issue Date [_ie_ , the date
falling 3 weeks after the payment of the sum of US$250,000 to PTIC pursuant to
Cl 3.1(i)] procure the issue of a valid and subsisting AIP in the name of
[PTIC].

Bharat] shall immediately procure the release to [PTIC] of the Security
Deposit from the Escrow Account.

Nava Bharat has the right to exercise its exit option in accordance with the
Master Agreement and the Master Agreement shall be modified to allow Nava
Bharat the right to demand the return of all monies paid pursuant to the

86 On 2 September 2009, Jason Tan sent an email informing Chandra that he was
in the process of converting the KP Concessions which, under the new mining
law, would be merged into the IUP Licence.[note: 283] On 5 September 2009,
Jason Tan sent an email to Chandra with a copy of the IUP Licence.[note: 284]
This was forwarded to Rajaram on 7 September 2009.[note: 285]

Concerns over Dicky Tan’s mining contractors

87 Under cl 3.1 of the Addendum Agreement (see [85] above), PTIC was obliged
to appoint a mining contractor that was “acceptable to Nava Bharat”, and the
payment of the sum of US$250,000 by Nava Bharat was contingent on the
appointment of an acceptable mining contractor. In this regard, PTIC proposed
the use of mining equipment from two mining contractors.[note: 286]

88 On 5 September 2009, Ashwin received the due diligence report by
Thangarajan Paranjoti (“Paranjoti”), a member of Nava Bharat’s Indonesian
team, which stated that there were problems with the equipment of Dicky Tan’s
mining contractors.[note: 287] The report was forwarded to Rajaram on 7
September 2009.[note: 288] Rajaram then sent an email to Chandra to request
for Dicky Tan’s urgent input on the situation as well as an update on the
status of the application for the AIP.[note: 289] Chandra replied on the same
day stating that the AIP should be out by next week, and that Dicky Tan would
produce the requisite tonnage as required.[note: 290]

89 Notwithstanding Paranjoti’s due diligence report, Ashwin sent an email to
Rajaram on 7 September 2009 stating that Nava Bharat is willing to accept
Dicky Tan’s mining contractors.[note: 291] Accordingly, Rajaram replied to
Chandra’s email on the same day with Ashwin’s instructions and highlighted to
Chandra that Nava Bharat would look to Dicky Tan if he fell short in terms of
the coal production.[note: 292]

Delays in obtaining AIP

90 Under cl 4.1 of the Addendum Agreement (see [85] above), the AIP was due on
18 September 2009.[note: 293] One day before the deadline, at a meeting
between Nava Bharat and PTIC in Indonesia, Hariman of PTIC informed Nava
Bharat’s Indonesian team that “they [would] receive a letter confirming the in
principle forestry license status”. He added that the letter would be given to
the management of Nava Bharat.[note: 294] On the same day, Jason Tan wrote to
Chandra stating that the application for the AIP was in process but “delayed
due to the bureaucracy” and the “long Ramadhan festive holiday”.[note: 295] In
this regard, Jason Tan attached a letter from the director of forestry area
usage to PTIC as proof to Nava Bharat that the application was “really under
process”.[note: 296] Chandra forwarded the email to Rajaram who in turn
forwarded it to Ashwin.[note: 297] Bob Sundaram, who translated the letter
into English, confirmed that the letter was “only a technical consideration”,
and not the AIP.[note: 298] Ashwin informed Rajaram about this.[note: 299]

91 At this point in time, Rajaram advised Ashwin of Nava Bharat’s rights under
the Addendum Agreement and suggested that a notice of default be issued.[note:
300] After consulting with Bhushan, Ashwin decided not to follow Rajaram’s
recommendation.[note: 301] Instead, he chose to negotiate an off-take
agreement under which PTIC will be responsible for “supplying/exporting” coal
from the Mine.[note: 302]

92 On 16 October 2009, Jason Tan informed Chandra that, notwithstanding the
difficulties in procuring the AIP, he hoped that it would be signed no later
than the next working day, _ie_ , 19 October 2009 (which was the last working
day for the Minister).[note: 303] There was no sign of the AIP on 19 October
2009.

93 One week later, on 26 October 2009, Rajaram received an email from Chandra
explaining that there was further delay to the AIP because “there has been a
change in the cabinet” and Dicky Tan proposed for 50% of the funds in escrow
to be released “upon production of copy of a duly executed AIP by the relevant
Minister” and the balance to be released upon receipt of the original.[note:
304] Bob Sundaram then wrote an email to Rajaram on 27 October 2009, copied to
Ashwin, suggesting that Dicky Tan was lying when he said that the AIP would be
obtained soon.[note: 305] Rajaram replied to Bob Sundaram, copied to Ashwin,
stating that “Ashwin [would] have to make the call” and in the meantime Nava
Bharat should extract as much coal as possible to minimise their
exposure.[note: 306]

94 At around this time, Ashwin got Bill Sullivan (“Bill”) of Christian Teo &
Associates into the picture. On 23 October 2009, Ashwin received an email from
Bill with a write up on the new mining law in Indonesia.[note: 307]
Subsequently, on 29 October 2009, Bob Sundaram met Bill.[note: 308] Ashwin
forwarded the write up and the minutes of the meeting to Rajaram.[note: 309]

95 On 6 November 2009, Bob Sundaram informed Ashwin that there was an ongoing
“power struggle between the Indonesian Police and the Anti-Corruption
agencies” which involved the Forestry Ministry and that it was likely to cause
further delays to the grant of the AIP.[note: 310] This was forwarded to
Rajaram on the same day.[note: 311] Rajaram then arranged for a meeting with
Ashwin and Bhushan to discuss Dicky Tan’s repeated defaults. The meeting took
place in SLP’s office on 9 November 2009.[note: 312] The next day, Ashwin
instructed Rajaram to go ahead with the issuance of the second notice of
default, stating that Nava Bharat could “use this to [Nava Bharat’s] advantage
while negotiating” with Dicky Tan.[note: 313]

Second Notice of Default

96 With Ashwin’s go-ahead, Rajaram wrote to Chandra on 10 November 2009 to
give notice of the various defaults by Dicky Tan and PTIC (“Second Notice of
Default”).[note: 314]

97 After the Second Notice of Default was issued, there was a series of emails
arranging for a meeting between the parties.[note: 315] Dicky Tan could not
make it for the meeting, and Rajaram suggested that Chandra could attend and
bring back the proposal for Dicky Tan to decide.[note: 316] Bhushan, who was
copied in the email, then wrote to Rajaram to suggest that they should meet
before the meeting with Chandra to work out their position:[note: 317]

I suggest we meet 30 minutes before this meeting with Chandra to exchange
views on ‘financial concessions’ that we may consider asking or tabling, and
also timing of the same, ie we may decide to convey to Chandra or hold it, but
in any case we should broadly work out amongst ourselves.

Rajaram agreed.[note: 318] Ashwin was copied in both emails.

The “without prejudice” proposal and draft Tripartite Agreement

98 On 16 November 2009, Rajaram wrote to Chandra with a “without prejudice”
proposal as an attempt to salvage the Transaction, and asked for a meeting on
the next day.[note: 319] The material terms of Nava Bharat’s “without
prejudice” proposal are as follows:[note: 320]

(a) that all agreements, including supplemental agreements and addendum
agreements, be terminated in consideration of the parties entering into a
fresh agreement; and

(b) that the fresh agreement would have the following pertinent
agreements/arrangements:

(i) the Mine valuation was to be revisited taking into consideration present
market conditions and valuations;

(ii) the royalty for coal that was agreed between parties would be
renegotiated;

(iii) PTIC would be converted into a PMA Company, and Nava Bharat to be issued
shares in it as consideration for payments; and

(iv) all penalties and price reductions agreed to in the previous agreements
would remain effective in the fresh agreement.

99 The “without prejudice” proposal also specified that the agreement should
be finalised and signed by 20 November 2009.[note: 321]

100 The meeting eventually took place on 16 December 2009, and it was attended
by Jason Tan, Bhushan, Ashwin and Rajaram.[note: 322] The parties agreed at
the meeting that, _inter alia_ , a different class of shares in PTIC with
exclusive rights over the KP Exploitasi Licence should be created and held by
TPC as stakeholders to be released to Nava Bharat upon payment (this would
later form the core of the draft Tripartite Agreement).[note: 323]

101 Ashwin received some materials on the new mining law from Bill on 5 and 12
January 2010, and he forwarded them to Rajaram.[note: 324] Sometime in
December 2009 to January 2010, Rajaram had also been in communication with
John Dick (“John”) of Freehills (now known as Hebert Smith Freehills) over the
issue of converting PTIC into a PMA Company.[note: 325] Ashwin and Rajaram met
with John on 21 January 2010,[note: 326] and on the next day, John provided a
preliminary advice stating, _inter alia_ , that:[note: 327]

In conclusion, we believe that the difficulties in converting a PT Biasa to a
PMA Company is more of an administrative matter (which would be solved once
implementing regulations are issued) rather than a fundamental legal matters
[_sic_] as was experienced under the old mining regime.

102 A meeting with Dicky Tan was fixed on 27 January 2010. At this meeting,
which was attended by Dicky Tan, Ashwin, Rajaram, Chandra and Bhushan, the
issue of converting PTIC into a PMA Company and the status of the AIP and
Forestry Licence were discussed.[note: 328]

103 On 11 February 2010, in an email to Rajaram and Bill, Ashwin informed
Rajaram that Nava Bharat had decided to engage Bill as its “Indonesian legal
counsel for the PTIC deal”, and introduced Rajaram to Bill as Nava Bharat’s
“Singapore legal counsel”.[note: 329] Bill sent his preliminary advice to
Rajaram, copied to Ashwin, on 15 February 2010.[note: 330] On 26 February
2010, Chandra sent an email to Rajaram attaching the draft Tripartite
Agreement (reflecting the arrangement discussed above at [100]).[note: 331]
Rajaram forwarded the draft to Bill for his inputs on 1 March 2010,[note: 332]
and Bill responded with his comments on the same day.[note: 333] In essence,
Bill proposed for the KP Explorasi Licence to be transferred to another of
Dicky Tan’s company (since the Transaction only concerned the KP Exploitasi
Licence), and to convert PTIC into a PMA Company (so that Nava Bharat can own
shares in it).[note: 334] In the meantime, Bill suggested that the shares of
PTIC, to the extent that it had been paid by Nava Bharat, should be
transferred to Nava Bharat’s Indonesian nominee, Gunawan Sukardis Subur
(“Gunawan”).[note: 335]

104 As a result of Bill’s input, there was another round of discussion in
March 2010 and the structure contemplated under the “without prejudice”
proposal (see [98] above) and draft Tripartite Agreement (see [103] above) was
abandoned.[note: 336] The agreements necessary to transfer the PTIC shares
from Dicky Tan to Gunawan were signed between 24 and 26 March 2010.[note: 337]
However, the transfer did not occur as the shareholders’ resolution and
spousal consent, which were necessary for the transfer, were not signed.[note:
338]

105 The AIP was finally obtained on 23 March 2010.[note: 339] Bill confirmed
on the next day that the AIP had been “issued and recorded” by the Ministry of
Forestry, and added that the Forestry Licence would be issued if PTIC carried
out its obligations under the AIP.[note: 340]

106 On 23 March 2010, unknown to Nava Bharat, Jason Tan obtained an order from
the Central Jakarta District Court to revert Dicky Tan’s shares in PTIC to the
previous shareholders, _ie_ , Sofwan Rahman and Suhendra on the basis that
Dicky Tan did not pay for the shares (see [124] below). Sofwan Rahman and
Suhendra each held 50% of the shares in PTIC before the shares were
transferred to Dicky Tan and Ridwan Halim around 2008.[note: 341]

107 On 9 April 2009, Rajaram sent an email to Chandra stating, _inter alia_ ,
that the PTIC shares had not been transferred to Gunawan and that he should
confirm that it would be “done immediately”.[note: 342]

The Settlement Agreement

108 On 4 June 2010, Ashwin sent an email to Rajaram setting out the points of
agreement that were reached by the parties on the way forward.[note: 343]
Shortly after Ashwin’s email, Rajaram received an email from Chandra with
essentially the same points. The arrangement, in essence, was that:[note: 344]

(a) Nava Bharat would release a sum of US$6m against compliance with the
following conditions (within 14 days of receipt of written evidence):

(i) issue of the Forestry Licence;

(ii) split and transfer the 745.006 hectares of non-exploitable land (with the
KP Explorasi Licence) to another company owned by Dicky Tan and associates;

(iii) terminate the existing contractor that was appointed by PTIC;

(iv) transfer the shares in PTIC to Nava Bharat’s Indonesian nominee to
reflect an equity payment of US$9.25m (_ie_ , US$6m to be paid out against
compliance with the aforesaid items and US$3.25m as the sum paid to date);

(b) Nava Bharat would increase its equity stake in PTIC up to 90% within one
month from the date of issue of the Forestry Licence and all other conditions
being fulfilled, including the conversion to IUP Licence.

(c) PTIC would give up its claims over the 150,000 metric tonnes of exposed
coal upon payment of a sum of US$650,000 by Nava Bharat.

(d) PTIC would not insist on the payment of US$500,000 for the AIP and the
payment of US$310,000 for the split and transfer of the KP Explorasi Licence,
which would be fully financed by PTIC.

109 On 11 June 2010, Rajaram sent an email to Ashwin attaching the term sheet
setting out the proposal for discussion.[note: 345] On the same day, Rajaram
also replied to Chandra informing him that Nava Bharat was agreeable in
principle to the proposal.[note: 346] Later, on 18 June 2010, Rajaram sent a
draft settlement agreement to Chandra for Dicky Tan’s comments.[note: 347]

110 On 6 July 2010, Ashwin was informed by Bhushan that he was told by Jason
Tan and Chandra that the Forestry Licence was “on the table of the minister”
and they were “very hopeful of the signature” even though they anticipated
some delay due to “political issues”.[note: 348] Bhushan added that Dicky Tan
had applied for the KP Exploitasi Licence and KP Explorasi Licence to be
split, and was ready and willing to transfer the PTIC shares to Gunawan.[note:
349] At around the same time, Chandra wrote to inform Rajaram of the
same.[note: 350] Despite that, the Forestry Licence was only obtained some
time later, in October 2010 (see [121] below).

111 Rajaram sent another copy of the draft settlement agreement, together with
the other documents, to Chandra on 27 July 2010 for his comments.[note: 351]
Chandra responded on 10 August 2010 and stated that there was no issue with
the document but requested for the transfer of the PTIC shares to be effected
after the execution of the settlement agreement.[note: 352]

112 Towards the end of August 2010, Ashwin decided to ask Bob Sundaram to try
and secure the Forestry Licence. On 24 August 2010, Rajaram wrote to inform
Chandra of Ashwin’s decision.[note: 353] Chandra replied on the same day
explaining that he had not been able to contact Dicky Tan or Jason Tan.[note:
354] On 1 September 2010, Bob Sundaram informed Ashwin that he had been
assured that the Forestry Licence would be issued by 18 September 2010.[note:
355] He sent another email to Ashwin on 7 September 2010 to confirm the
same.[note: 356] At this point, Bhushan repeated Rajaram’s suggestion for Nava
Bharat to take over the Mine “as is where is”, now that the Forestry Licence
is assured, and ask for a discount on the price.[note: 357]

113 On 16 September 2010, Chandra sent the draft settlement agreement,
together with the other documents, to Rajaram.[note: 358] The next day, the
documents, except for the draft settlement agreement, were signed and
returned.[note: 359]

114 Rajaram wrote to Chandra on 23 September 2010 pointing out that Dicky Tan
had failed to transfer the PTIC shares to Gunawan even though he had agreed to
do so.[note: 360] To resolve this, a meeting was arranged on 1 October
2010.[note: 361] At the meeting, Jason Tan explained that Dicky Tan (who was
not present) had been stripped of his powers in PTIC and was therefore unable
to act on behalf of PTIC.[note: 362] He added that Dicky Tan owed money to the
previous shareholders of PTIC (_ie_ , Sofwan Rahman and Suhendra), and
suggested that any outstanding money due to Dicky Tan could be paid to them to
resolve the matter.[note: 363] Ashwin suggested that Nava Bharat is ready to
pay,[note: 364] and Rajaram then proposed that an escrow account be created
for the payment to the previous shareholders, subject to Dicky Tan executing
the share transfer.[note: 365]

115 The settlement agreement was never concluded by the parties.[note: 366]

116 Sometime in early October 2010, Tansree Tjandra (“Tansree”) announced that
he would be taking over the negotiations with respect to the Mine because
Dicky Tan owed money to Tansree and the rest of the family.[note: 367] A
meeting was held between Tansree and Ashwin on 13 October 2010.[note: 368]
After the meeting, Jason Tan sent an email to Chandra stating that Tansree
wanted to have the negotiations after the Forestry Licence was issued.[note:
369] However, Tansree passed away shortly thereafter.[note: 370]

Third Notice of Default and exercise of the share pledges

117 Sometime in October 2010, Nava Bharat decided to exercise its rights under
the Loan Agreement and the share pledges. As Rajaram was out of Singapore
working on another matter, Sreenivasan was asked to assist in getting advice
from Indonesian lawyers on exercising the share pledges.[note: 371]

118 On or about 4 October 2010, Muralli Rajaram (“Muralli”), a senior
associate from SLP who was assisting Sreenivasan, wrote to Suria Nataadmadja
(“Suria”) of Suria Nataadmadja & Associates, a law firm in Indonesia, to
enquire on the exercise of the share pledges.[note: 372] Suria replied on 7
October 2010 with the view that it was possible but “a bit complicated since
the documents have no exact amount of money guaranteed by the pledge”.[note:
373] Muralli then wrote to Rajaram and Sreenivasan to inform them that Suria
had suggested for Nava Bharat to go back to ABNR to assist in the exercise of
rights under the Loan Agreement and the share pledges.[note: 374] On the same
day, Sreenivasan wrote to Ashwin stating that Nava Bharat should exercise the
share pledges and “talk from a position of strength”.[note: 375] Sreenivasan
also pointed out that this would spark off a civil suit if there was no
“commercial settlement”, but Nava Bharat should go ahead as it would “tie up
their shares”.[note: 376]

119 Muralli also wrote to Nafis, copied to Woody, on 8 October 2010 to enquire
on the exercise of the share pledges.[note: 377] Woody replied on 12 October
2010 stating that even though the “creation of pledge of shares and the
related powers of attorney to sell and to vote to support the pledge of shares
[is] very common”, the exercise of the pledge without the cooperation of the
pledgors is “not really common” and “may always be subject to challenge by the
pledgors”.[note: 378] On the same day, Rajaram responded to Woody stating that
another law firm had a different interpretation of the situation and would be
appointed to assist on the exercise of the share pledges.[note: 379] Rajaram
also added that “[their] mutual client is unhappy at the turn of events and
[ABNR’s] present stand”.[note: 380] Woody responded on 13 October 2010 and
stated that there was no basis for Nava Bharat to be unhappy with ABNR’s stand
given that it had “very clearly stated some qualifications on the
enforceability of the pledge and powers of attorney”.[note: 381]

120 On 18 October 2010, Rajaram on behalf of Nava Bharat issued another notice
of default to PTIC and Dicky Tan (“Third Notice of Default”).[note: 382] One
of the defaults identified in the Third Notice of Default was that Dicky Tan
had failed to obtain the Forestry Licence on time.[note: 383] Dicky Tan and
PTIC did not respond to the Third Notice of Default.[note: 384]

121 One day later, on 19 October 2010, the Forestry Licence was signed by the
Minister.[note: 385]

122 A few days later, on 26 October 2010, Rajaram wrote to Chandra to notify
Dicky Tan that Nava Bharat had exercised its rights pursuant to the Loan
Agreement and share pledges.[note: 386] After exercising the share pledges,
Nava Bharat transferred the PTIC shares to its Indonesian nominees Gunawan and
Debora Viseka (“Debora”) in the respective shareholding of 80% and 20%.[note:
387]

123 Sometime in April 2011, Nava Bharat entered into negotiations with various
parties on the sale of the shares in PTIC.[note: 388] Rajaram assisted in
preparing the drafts of the various agreements to facilitate Nava Bharat’s
sale of the PTIC shares.[note: 389] On or about June 2011, the 80% of PTIC
shares held by Gunawan was sold to Indra Sulisto (“Indra”) for US$8m.[note:
390] There is some dispute over whether Nava Bharat was actually paid the full
sum of US$8m. Ashwin claimed that Nava Bharat had only received US$150,000 as
the deal fell through eventually.[note: 391]

Loss of the PTIC shares

124 Sometime in late November 2010, Bob Sundaram received a copy of Deed No 8
which stated that Dicky Tan’s 80% share in PTIC (obtained pursuant to Deed No
42) had reverted to the previous shareholders, _ie_ , Sofwan Rahman and
Suhendra, by an order made by the Central Jakarta District Court on 23 March
2010 because Dicky Tan did not pay for the shares.[note: 392] Deed No 8 also
stated that as Dicky Tan did not have any interest in the PTIC shares, the
transfer of the shares to Gunawan and Debora under Deed Nos 23, 24 and 25
(which was relied on to exercise the share pledges) was invalid.[note: 393]

125 On 30 November 2010, Bob Sundaram reported to Ashwin _via_ email that his
initial investigation at the “Justice and Law Ministry” (also referred to as
the “Ministry of Law and Human Rights”) revealed that Deed No 8 was
“fabricated”.[note: 394] According to Bob Sundaram, the senior manager of the
Ministry explained that Deed No 8 stated that Gunawan and Debora appeared
before a Notary Public on 3 November 2010 and agreed to surrender all the PTIC
shares in their possession to Dicky Tan.[note: 395] Jason Tan then allegedly
created Deed No 14 on 11 November 2010 under which the PTIC shares were
transferred to two of Jason Tan’s children and Sofwan Rahman.[note: 396]

Other transactions involving the Mine

The Lanna Transaction

126 On 7 October 2010, shortly before the share pledges were exercised,
Sreenivasan came across the case of _Lanna Resources Public Co Ltd v Tan Beng
Phiau Dick and another_ [2011] 1 SLR 543 (“ _Lanna v Tan_ ”) and forwarded it
to Ashwin.[note: 397] It was only then that Nava Bharat found out Dicky Tan
had some form of arrangement with another party in relation to the Mine at
around the same time as the Transaction.

127 The arrangement was for Lanna Resources Public Co Ltd, a company
incorporated in Thailand (“Lanna Resources”) to provide a loan of US$4m to
Saraburi in return for the supply of coal (“the Lanna Transaction”).[note:
398] In or about March 2008, Dicky Tan approached Chandra to assist in respect
of the Lanna Transaction.[note: 399] This was the second time Dicky Tan had
approached Chandra for his services. Chandra was first appointed by Dicky Tan
in 2004 to assist him with the private placement of shares in a company listed
on the Singapore stock exchange.[note: 400]

128 Under memorandum of agreement dated 25 April 2008 for the Lanna
Transaction, it was agreed that Lanna Resources would provide a loan of US$4m
to Saraburi in two tranches of US$2m each.[note: 401] The first tranche was
payable on 5 May 2008, and the second tranche was payable within 30 days of 5
May 2008, subject to satisfactory performance by Saraburi of its obligations
under the coal supply agreements.[note: 402] These obligations included
providing a plan, programme and budget to describe and set out how the loan
would be used towards the intended purpose, that is, infrastructural upgrade
for the mines.[note: 403]

129 Lanna Resources paid out the first tranche as stipulated but did not pay
out the second tranche within 30 days of 5 May 2008.[note: 404] Dicky Tan and
Lanna Resources could not agree on whether the obligations on the part of
Saraburi were met.[note: 405] As a result, Dicky Tan purportedly accepted
Lanna Resources’ repudiatory breach and terminated the Lanna
Transaction.[note: 406] After the Lanna Transaction fell through, Dicky Tan
proceeded to look for a new investor for the Mine; he was then introduced to
Nava Bharat by Bhushan (see [9] above).[note: 407]

130 Lanna Resources subsequently obtained an arbitral award against Saraburi
for the sum of US$2m paid out in the first tranche of the loan.[note: 408]
Lanna Resources had also sought to enforce the personal guarantees against
Dicky Tan and Tanakorn through court proceedings in Singapore (see _Lanna v
Tan_ at [6]–[8]).[note: 409] Bhargavan Sujatha (“Sujatha”) of Toh Tan &
Partners, who is Chandra’s sister-in-law, represented Dicky Tan in both
proceedings.[note: 410]

131 According to Nava Bharat, the documents in the Lanna Transaction will show
Chandra’s conspiratorial involvement in the present case.[note: 411] This will
be explored in greater detail below.

The Belfield Loan

132 Nava Bharat also discovered subsequently that Dicky Tan had obtained a
loan from Belfield. The brief facts have been set out above at [68]. Like the
Lanna Transaction, Nava Bharat claimed that the Belfield Loan and the
circumstances surrounding it would reveal that Chandra was involved in a
conspiracy with Jason Tan and Dicky Tan to defraud Nava Bharat. This will,
likewise, be examined below.

The STX Transaction

133 Nava Bharat also found out a few months after the PTIC shares were
transferred to Jason Tan’s children and Sofwan Rahman (see [124]–[125] above)
that Jason Tan had tried to sell the shares in PTIC to STX Corporation
(“STX”), a company incorporated in Korea. As early as January 2011, Nava
Bharat had tried to inform STX of its rights in PTIC (by virtue of the share
pledges and prior to the reversal of the share transfer).[note: 412]
Nevertheless, STX decided to proceed with the transaction. In or around May
2011, STX acquired 40% of the shares in PTIC (“STX Transaction”).[note: 413]
STX then commenced mining operations at the Mine.[note: 414] Consequently,
Nava Bharat commenced proceedings against STX for inducing Dicky Tan to breach
his contract with Nava Bharat by entering into a contract with Dicky Tan
and/or PTIC in relation to the Mine.[note: 415] Nava Bharat’s claim against
STX was withdrawn on 25 July 2014.

134 Sometime in 2012, STX was prevented from operating the Mine,[note: 416]
and it commenced proceedings in Singapore against Dicky Tan and others for the
breach of the coal and off-take agreement concluded between STX and
PTIC.[note: 417] At the same time, STX also commenced proceedings against
Dicky Tan and Jason Tan based on the guarantee and indemnity issued by them
for the losses suffered by STX as a result of the breach by PTIC.[note: 418]

Nava Bharat’s claims

Claim against Dicky Tan and Jason Tan in Indonesia

135 On 9 September 2011, Nava Bharat commenced proceedings in Indonesia
against Dicky Tan, Jason Tan and others for conspiring to remove Nava Bharat’s
ownership rights in PTIC (Case No 623/PDT.6/2011/PN.JKT.BAR (“Case No
623”)).[note: 419] In Case No 623, Nava Bharat sought, _inter alia_ , a
declaration that the exercise of the share pledges by Nava Bharat is valid,
and that its nominees are the lawful owners of the shares in PTIC.[note: 420]
The West Jakarta District Court handed down its judgment on or about 29
October 2012 (with written judgment released in December 2012).[note: 421] The
Court found, _inter alia_ , that the documents in relation to the Transaction,
including the pledge of shares agreements, were valid and enforceable.[note:
422]

136 Notwithstanding the judgment in favour of Nava Bharat, Dicky Tan and Jason
Tan continued to operate the Mine.[note: 423] In the meantime, Dicky Tan and
Jason Tan have appealed against the judgment of the Western Jakarta District
Court.[note: 424]

Claim against SLP and Rajaram in Singapore

137 On 26 September 2011, Nava Bharat informed Rajaram that it had appointed
Global Law Alliance LLC (“GLA”) to take over conduct of the matter.[note: 425]
A few days later, on 5 October 2011, GLA on behalf of Nava Bharat issued a
letter of demand to SLP and Rajaram, claiming, _inter alia_ , that Rajaram was
negligent.[note: 426] The writ of summons for S 846/2011 was filed on 22
November 2011.

138 Nava Bharat avers that the cumulative conduct of SLP and Rajaram in
relation to the Transaction would constitute breach of contract, negligence
and breach of fiduciary duty.[note: 427] As a result, Nava Bharat claims that
it had suffered loss and damage and is seeking to recover from SLP and
Rajaram:[note: 428]

(a) damages for pre-trial loss of profits from April 2009 to April 2013 in the
sum of US$44.83m, and future continuing loss of profits to be assessed, or
alternatively, repayment of US$3.1m being payment made by Nava Bharat for the
equity participation in PTIC;

(b) damages for wasted costs and costs of cure totalling US$2,442,220.35;

(c) damages for opportunity costs; and

(d) interest and costs.

Claim against Dicky Tan and Chandra in Singapore

139 On 5 October 2011, GLA on behalf of Nava Bharat issued a letter of demand
to Dicky Tan and Chandra.[note: 429] Chandra responded on 20 October
2011.[note: 430] Nava Bharat filed its writ of summons for S 847/2011 on 22
November 2011. As mentioned earlier (see [5] above), Dicky Tan was served with
the writ of summons, but had failed to enter into appearance. As a result,
default judgment was entered against Dicky Tan.

140 Nava Bharat’s pleaded case against Chandra is essentially two-fold. First,
Chandra has conspired with Jason Tan and Dicky Tan to injure Nava Bharat by
unlawful means, namely “by selling/disposing of the Mine and/or interests in
the Mine to [Nava Bharat] for valuable consideration” even though Dicky Tan
did not have the rights to the Mine.[note: 431] Second, Chandra held himself
out as a lawyer who would look after Nava Bharat’s interests, which Nava
Bharat relied on, but he failed to do so.[note: 432] Nava Bharat claims that
it had suffered loss and damage as a result of Chandra’s acts, and seeks to
recover the following:[note: 433]

(a) general damages for conspiracy to be assessed;

(b) damages for pre-trial loss of profits from April 2009 to April 2013 in the
sum of US$44.83m, and future continuing loss of profits to be assessed, or
alternatively, repayment of US$3.1m being payment made by Nava Bharat for the
equity participation in PTIC;

(c) amages for wasted costs and costs of cure totalling US$2,442,220.35; and

(d) interest and costs.

Claim against STX in Singapore

141 Nava Bharat had also, on 17 December 2011, commenced legal proceedings
against STX. In Suit No 917 of 2011 (“S 917/2011”), Nava Bharat claimed,
_inter alia_ , that STX had deprived Nava Bharat of its rights to the PTIC
shares and to conduct mining operations to extract coal from the Mine.[note:
434] There was a dispute over whether the factual basis for Nava Bharat’s
claims in S 847/2011 and S 917/2011 were, as Chandra put it, completely
contradictory such that it suggests Nava Bharat’s claims were not genuine and
_bona fide_.[note: 435] On 25 July 2014, Nava Bharat withdrew its claim
against STX.

The witnesses

142 To support their respective cases, the parties called a total of five
factual witnesses and three expert witnesses. I will briefly set out their
evidence as well as, where necessary, my general assessment of their demeanour
during the hearing.

Factual witnesses

Ashwin

143 Ashwin is one of the two factual witnesses called by Nava Bharat to
testify at the trial. As the main representative of Nava Bharat in the
Transaction, Ashwin’s evidence covers almost all aspects of the Transaction.
In this regard, he filed two affidavits evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) – one on
the issue of liability and the other on the issue of quantum of the alleged
losses suffered by Nava Bharat.

144 I find him to be a bright, young man but unreasonably persistent when it
comes to certain points (apparently crucial for his case) which, in my view,
were _clearly_ not in his favour. To illustrate this, I need only to give a
few examples. The first relates to Ashwin’s testimony that he did not read
ABNR’s Third Draft Report, which was not only forwarded to him but also
highlighted by Prasad’s email which said that it “raises pertinent
questions”.[note: 436] Notwithstanding that, Ashwin insists that he did not
read ABNR’s Third Draft Report.[note: 437] Another example is Ashwin’s
repeated assertion that he believed that Nava Bharat was going to acquire
equity interest in PTIC. This was clearly contradictory to NBVL’s
clarification issued on 31 January 2009 that it was _not_ going to acquire
equity stake in PTIC, but in “the Company which has exclusive off-take
agreement with the Coal Concession Company”.[note: 438] Even after having been
shown the clarification by NBVL, which Ashwin accepts must have been confirmed
by him,[note: 439] he continues to take the position that he did not know that
Nava Bharat was not acquiring an equity interest in the Mine.[note: 440]
Ashwin also appears to hold a very strong view that ABNR was _not_ Nava
Bharat’s Indonesian lawyers,[note: 441] even though this was inconsistent with
the position taken by Nava Bharat (this will be examined in detail at [233]
below). On the whole, Ashwin gave me the impression that he might have been
trying to salvage himself from a bad decision in entering into the
Transaction.

145 As a matter of general observation (and I will elaborate in some detail at
the appropriate points below), I also find that some of the crucial
allegations that Ashwin is making against Chandra and Rajaram are _not_
supported by documents. In addition, I observed that a number of the
explanations offered by Ashwin are illogical and appear to be contrived to
avoid contradiction. In fact, several of his explanations contradict the
contemporaneous documentary evidence. One clear example is his evidence on
whether he knew that the Forestry Licence was required in order to commence
operations at the Mine. He said in his AEIC that he wrote to Prasad, Rajaram
and Bhushan on 23 December 2008 and attached documents which “show that it was
_clear_ that the [Forestry Licence] was mandatory” (with the email exhibited
in his AEIC).[note: 442] Pertinently, Ashwin felt that it was clear that the
Forestry Licence was mandatory because he and Prasad noticed that PTBHM had
earlier applied for the Forestry Licence (albeit unclear if it was eventually
obtained).[note: 443] At the hearing, however, Ashwin did a _volte-face_ and
said that it was _not clear_ to him on 23 December 2008 that a Forestry
Licence was mandatory.[note: 444] I find his explanation to be contrived and
contradictory to the objective documentary evidence.[note: 445]

146 I should also mention that Ashwin had also taken a very strong position on
the point that Rajaram was not involved in the Multi Guna Transaction except
for the drafting of the settlement agreement,[note: 446] but conceded, after
being shown contradictory documentary evidence, that he was wrong and appeared
to be saying that he had forgotten about it.[note: 447] Given the number of
correspondence (reflecting the extent of Rajaram’s involvement in the Multi
Guna Transaction), I do not think that it was something that could have been
easily forgotten.[note: 448] Even if Ashwin was telling the truth (that he had
forgotten about Rajaram’s involvement in the Multi Guna Transaction except for
the drafting of the settlement agreement), it would appear that he was prone
to exaggeration. Indeed, he went so far as to say, when questioned, that he
was “under oath” and would “stand by [his] word” that Rajaram was _only_
involved for the settlement agreement.[note: 449] To some extent, this
suggests that Ashwin has a tendency to embellish and his evidence might be
unreliable. I therefore approached his evidence with caution.

Bob Sundaram

147 Bob Sundaram is the other factual witness that was called by Nava Bharat.
As I have mentioned earlier, Bob Sundaram was, at the material time, the
director of Nava Bharat’s Indonesian subsidiaries, and acted as Nava Bharat’s
“focal point on the ground in Indonesia”.[note: 450] He was also substantially
involved in the Transaction, and his evidence reflects that. Like Ashwin, Bob
Sundaram filed two AEICs, with one for the issue of liability and the other
for the issue of quantum of the alleged losses suffered by Nava Bharat.

148 I find his evidence to be generally reasonable, except when it comes to
the issue of the Forestry Licence. For instance, Bob Sundaram agreed during
cross-examination that he would have asked about the Forestry Licence (which
he knew was mandatory) when he was asked to sign the Security Documents on
behalf of Nava Bharat at the Indonesian leg of the initial completion (see
[49] above).[note: 451] He explained that he called Ashwin to ask about the
Forestry Licence and was told that it was “Rajaram’s responsibility”.[note:
452] He added that he also called Rajaram and was told that the Forestry
Licence had been “taken care of”.[note: 453] This was a crucial piece of fact.
However, it did not feature at all in Bob Sundaram’s AEIC. This indicates that
it was conjured up to explain why he was willing to go ahead with signing the
Security Documents on behalf of Nava Bharat even though he knew that the
Forestry Licence was outstanding.

149 I should also mention one other example where Bob Sundaram’s evidence in
relation to the Forestry Licence was inconsistent and illogical. Nava Bharat
takes the position that Rajaram had, at the meeting on 19 December 2008,
echoed Dicky Tan’s view that there was no need for the Forestry Licence. Bob
Sundaram said in his AEIC that Rajaram said that “the sellers had said that it
was an operational mine and there was no need for such a licence”.[note: 454]
However, when asked during cross-examination, Bob Sundaram said that he did
not know _who_ said it.[note: 455] In an attempt to explain for the
inconsistency, Bob Sundaram answered the questions in an illogical
fashion:[note: 456]

Q:... Yesterday you did not say the statement was made repeatedly; correct?

A:Yes.

Q:And yesterday, when you were asked who made the statement, you were unable
to name anyone, right?

A:That is true.

...

Q:So you’re very sure Mr Rajaram said it, right?

A:Yes, of course.

...

Q:Then why is it yesterday, when asked specifically and directly who said it,
you said you didn’t know? Why?

A:Well, I said -- my interpretation is there is somebody else within that
group did mention, I heard about it, I don’t know who it is. That is my
interpretation, because Rajaram and Ashwin is somebody whom I know.

...

Q:You have now told the court that this is something you remember very, very
well, that Mr Rajaram is one of the people who made this statement. ... why is
it yesterday, when asked directly and pointedly, who made that statement, you
did not say Mr Rajaram’s name? Why?

A:Because, for me, Rajaram is already part of that discussion. I didn’t go
very specific about it.

150 Bob Sundaram eventually agreed to withdraw the allegation in his AEIC that
Rajaram had said that “the sellers had said that it was an operational mine
and there was no need for such a licence”.[note: 457]

151 I also observe that Bob Sundaram appears to be making allegations against
Rajaram which do not form part of the plaintiff’s pleadings.[note: 458] In
addition, as I will elaborate below (at [285]–[286]), Bob Sundaram appears to
have changed his evidence to suit Nava Bharat’s case.

Rajaram

152 Rajaram, the second defendant in S 846/2011, is one of the two factual
witnesses called by the defendants in S 846/2011 to give evidence at trial. As
one of the main protagonists in this case, Rajaram’s evidence covers the
entire Transaction.

153 I find Rajaram to be a generally honest witness. The only problem with him
is that it was not his habit to make written records of his oral communication
with his clients. Hence there were very few written records of his meetings
and phone discussions with Ashwin. While this appears to me to be a risky
manner of conducting a law practice, as the fact that he is embroiled in this
suit would confirm, there is nothing in the evidence nor the circumstances
that suggest that he has not disclosed any written record. This meant that we
only have his word for it as to what he had advised Nava Bharat. However, I
find Rajaram’s evidence to be, in general, reasonable and truthful.

Sreenivasan

154 The defendants in S 846/2011 also called Sreenivasan as a witness. This is
because he was tangentially involved in the Transaction. Specifically, he took
over the conduct of the matter for a short period of time on two separate
occasions, namely, when Rajaram was undergoing some urgent medical
tests,[note: 459] and when he was away for an arbitration matter.[note: 460]
Accordingly, his evidence concerns primarily with the Variation Agreement as
well as the exercise of the share pledges, the two areas that he was involved
in. I found Sreenivasan to be a cautious witness in that he thinks carefully
about the question before answering them. I find his evidence to be logical
and consistent with the documents.

Chandra

155 Chandra, the second defendant in S 847/2011, is the only witness to give
evidence in his defence. Like Ashwin and Rajaram, Chandra is the other main
protagonist in this case. His evidence covers not only the entire course of
the Transaction, but also the Lanna Transaction which preceded the
Transaction.[note: 461]

156 In the course of the hearing, it was revealed that there were some
indications in the contemporaneous documents that payments had to be made to
certain officials in Indonesia in order to facilitate the procurement of the
Forestry Licence.[note: 462] It was suggested to Chandra that these payments
were illicit and that he was complicit in the endeavour. He claimed that it
did not occur to him that such payments were illicit. He repeatedly said that
he took Dicky Tan’s words in good faith,[note: 463] but it appears to me that
he is trying to hide behind the label of good faith. I could observe that he
was uncomfortable and evasive in his answers to questions related to those
payments. He is either naïve or, being put in the conundrum, had chosen to be
parsimonius with the truth. I do not think that he is naïve. Nevertheless I
make no finding on this because it is not necessary to do so to determine the
issues before me.

157 Even ignoring the foregoing, Chandra’s main problem as a witness was his
inability to answer to the point. He has a tendency to meander, backpedal and
give weak, often irrelevant, explanations. For instance, Chandra said in his
AEIC that Dicky Tan was the owner of the Mine.[note: 464] In cross-
examination, however, Chandra said that Dicky Tan was _not_ the owner of the
Mine.[note: 465] When he was further questioned on the following day, Chandra
explained that he meant that Dicky Tan was not the _legal_ owner but was the
_equitable_ owner.[note: 466] To give another example, Chandra said that the
Transaction was the first time he dealt with something involving equity
participation in an Indonesian coal mine.[note: 467] However, he had earlier
dealt with the Lanna Transaction, which also envisaged (albeit only initially)
equity participation of Lanna Resources in an Indonesian coal mine.[note: 468]
When this was pointed out to Chandra, his response (which, in my view, was a
weak one) was that the Lanna Transaction collapsed immediately.[note: 469]

158 Overall, Chandra was a poor witness. He often could not give a direct
answer to the question posed but would rush into an explanation to the answer
he did not give, or talk about some peripheral matter. He had to be reminded
on many occasions to get to the point and not go off on a tangent.[note: 470].
I must say that his performance on the witness stand totally belies the fact
that he is an experienced legal professional (albeit not a litigation
practitioner) – he seemed unable to get a grip on the question and answer to
the point. It was obvious to me that he was nervous, but this could be due
either to his personality _or_ the fact that he was trying to conceal
something. However, I take into account the possibility that his dismal
performance as a witness may be due to his personality and the fact that he
was being personally sued for a large sum of money. As such, I do not think
that it is appropriate to dismiss all of Chandra’s evidence as unreliable, but
have to treat it with considerable caution.

Expert witnesses

Michael Scott Carl

159 To bolster its case against SLP and Rajaram, Nava Bharat called Michael
Scott Carl (“Carl”) to “give expert evidence in relation to the
[T]ransaction”.[note: 471] Rajaram objected and argued that the evidence of
Carl should be rejected in its entirety because:[note: 472]

(a) Carl lacked the proper qualifications and experience to give expert
evidence in relation to the Transaction;

(b) Carl raised issues in relation to the _structure_ of the Transaction that
were not pleaded; and

(c) Carl had not complied with the standards expected of an independent expert
witness.

160 I will address these objections below, but before that, I shall first
address what I believe to be the crux of the problem with Carl’s evidence,
_ie_ , his view on his role as an expert witness in these proceedings.

(1) Role of an expert witness

161 It appears to me that Carl is of the view that he was _not_ called as an
expert on Indonesian law (and in particular, Indonesian mining law), but to
evaluate the work done by Rajaram in the course of the Transaction. This is
reflected in his expert report, where he said that:[note: 473]

I understand that ... I am to provide my views, _as to the appropriateness of
the advice and counsel provided by Rajaram_ in structuring the Transaction and
reviewing due diligence and other inputs received from Ali Budiardjo, Nugroho,
Reksodiputro (ABNR), which acted as Nava Bharat’s Indonesian counsel in the
Transaction. [emphasis added]

162 In the midst of the hearing, Mr Cavinder Bull SC (“Mr Bull”), counsel for
Rajaram, sought to challenge the evidence of Carl on a number of
grounds.[note: 474] They are essentially the same as the objections that I
have listed above (at [159]). In response to Mr Bull’s point that Carl is not
qualified to be an expert witness, Carl filed an affidavit on 9 May 2013, in
which he explained that:[note: 475]

... I was engaged to give expert opinion as a cross-border transactional
lawyer dealing with a matter involving the failed acquisition of an asset in
Indonesia. _I was not engaged to give expert opinion on Indonesian law_ ,
although it is true that my practice has its particular focus on Indonesia and
I rely on the knowledge and expertise that I have developed concerning
Indonesia law in working with Indonesian lawyers on Indonesian transactions
over these many years in expressing my views in my expert opinion, where
relevant. [emphasis added]

Later in the affidavit, he went on to say that:[note: 476]

_I have been engaged to give expert opinion on the transaction_ , some aspects
of which incidentally requires me to address my understanding of Indonesian
law. [emphasis added]

163 As a result of Carl’s view on his role in these proceedings, he went on in
his expert report to draw inferences and proffered his opinion based on
them.[note: 477] It is unclear how Carl arrived at some of these conclusions.
One example would be Carl’s view that Rajaram was representing Nava Bharat as
“international or Singapore counsel” [note: 478] even though the phrase
“international counsel” does not appear in the correspondence (see [103]
above, where Ashwin referred to Rajaram as Nava Bharat’s “Singapore legal
counsel”). Carl included in his expert report what he would have done if he
was in the position of Rajaram. He said that:[note: 479]

... As a legal practitioner, I would have understood this information to be
very important in the context of Nava Bharat’s requirement that the Mine be
fully operational on completion of the Transaction. Indeed, I would have
assumed that the information was sufficiently important that it may
potentially have affected Nava Bharat’s “commercial call” whether to make a
US$3,000,000 up-front payment to Dicky Tan for the Mine. I would have ensured
that the information was fully and clearly conveyed to Nava Bharat for its
consideration.

164 Furthermore, Carl expressed his views of what Rajaram’s duty ought to be
in the circumstances. For instance, he said that:[note: 480]

I believe that ABNR accurately described the risks inherent in the Transaction
structure. My only concern is that the Documents do not indicate whether these
risks were conveyed to Nava Bharat, _as they should have been_ , before Nava
Bharat made a decision to proceed with the Transaction. [emphasis added]

165 In _Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd and another v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp (a firm)_
[1979] Ch 384 (“ _Midland Bank_ ”), which was endorsed by the English Court of
Appeal in _Bown v Gould & Swayne_ [1996] PNLR 130, Oliver J said at 402C that:

The extent of the legal duty in any given situation must, I think, be a
question of law for the court. Clearly, if there is some practice in a
particular profession, some accepted standard of conduct which is laid down by
a professional institute or sanctioned by common usage, evidence of that can
and ought to be received. But evidence which really amounts to no more than an
expression of opinion by a particular practitioner of what he thinks that he
would have done had he been placed, hypothetically and without the benefit of
hindsight, in the position of the defendants, is of little assistance to the
court; whilst evidence of the witnesses’ view of what, as a matter of law, the
solicitor’s duty was in the particular circumstances of the case is, I should
have thought, inadmissible, for that is the very question which it is the
court's function to decide.

166 This passage was cited with approval in _Fong Maun Yee and another v Yoong
Weng Ho Robert_ [1997] 1 SLR(R) 751 at [47] and _Su Ah Tee and others v
Allister Lim and Thrumurgan (sued as a firm) and another (William Cheng and
others, third parties)_ [2014] SGHC 159 (“ _Su Ah Tee_ ”) at [83] (decision on
liability upheld on appeal; see _Cheng William v Allister Lim & Thrumurgan and
another and another appeal_ [2015] SGCA 15 at [12]).

167 In my view, the evidence of Carl falls within the second and third
categories of _Midland Bank_ , namely:

(a) the evidence of the expert’s opinion of what he would have done if he was
placed, hypothetically and without the benefit of hindsight, in the position
of the defendant; and

(b) the evidence of the expert’s view on what the defendant’s duty in the
particular circumstances of the case is.

168 It follows that Carl’s evidence is of little assistance to the court and,
to the extent that it dealt with the scope of Rajaram’s duty, inadmissible.

169 I note that Steven Chong J had, in _The “Chem Orchid”_ [2015] 2 SLR 1020
(“ _Chem Orchid_ ”), helpfully included a _coda_ on the use of expert evidence
in the proof of foreign law. While the case dealt primarily with the role of
an expert on foreign law in the construction of private documents, I find his
observations in relation to the role of an expert on foreign law in general
(at [160]–[163]) to be a concise summary of the law. In that case, Chong J was
of the view that the expert opinions filed on the issue of Korean law were
“ultimately indistinguishable from submissions which offered the court no
substantive assistance in terms of proof of foreign law” (at [135]). I share
the same frustration with Carl’s evidence. It behoves me to emphasise that
this case (as well as _Chem Orchid_) should serve as a timely reminder to
lawyers instructing expert witnesses (including, and perhaps more so, foreign
law experts) to give clearer guidance to those witnesses on their role as an
expert in legal proceedings.

170 I proceed to consider the other objections against Carl’s evidence.

(2) Qualification as expert witness

171 The confusion over the role of Carl in these proceedings has resulted in
other difficulties. Pertinently, Carl does _not_ appear to be saying that he
is an expert on Indonesian law (see [162] above), but that he is competent to
give his opinion on such a transaction. In any case, I find that Nava Bharat
had not proven that Carl is an expert on Indonesian mining law.

172 The admissibility of expert evidence is governed by s 47 of the Evidence
Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”). The relevant parts of s 47 of the EA reads:

47.—(1) Subject to subsection (4), when the court is likely to derive
assistance from an opinion upon a point of scientific, technical or other
specialised knowledge, the opinions of experts upon that point are relevant
facts.

(2) An expert is a person with such scientific, technical or other specialised
knowledge based on training, study or experience.

173 In _Leong Wing Kong v Public Prosecutor_ [1994] 1 SLR(R) 681 at [16], the
Court of Appeal accepted the observation in _Public Prosecutor v Muhamed bin
Sulaiman_ [1982] 2 MLJ 320 that “while the expert must be ‘skilled’, he need
not be so by special study, he may be so by _experience_ , and the fact that
he has not acquired his knowledge professionally goes merely to the weight and
not admissibility” [emphasis in original].

174 One of Rajaram’s reasons for saying that Carl is not an expert on
Indonesian law is because he is “not licensed as an Indonesian advocate”, and
that he is “required to work with licensed Indonesian lawyers in advising
clients” on matters pertaining to Indonesian law.[note: 481] In response, Nava
Bharat claims that Indonesian law stipulates that only Indonesian citizens can
be licensed to practice Indonesian law and it is “no more than a regulatory
issue” that Carl had to work with licensed Indonesian lawyers in advising
clients.[note: 482] I do not agree that a person cannot be an expert witness
on the laws of a country simply because he is not qualified to practice as an
advocate in that country. A professor of law who may not have been called to
the bar, assuming the other prerequisites are met, would certainly be
considered as an expert. I therefore do not accept Rajaram’s contention that
Carl is not an expert because he is not licensed as an Indonesian advocate.

175 In my view, the question turns on whether Carl is a person with
specialised knowledge of Indonesian law, in relation to mining, “based on
training, study or experience” (s 47(2) of the EA). I do not think that Nava
Bharat is suggesting that Carl is an expert on Indonesian mining law because
of training or study. In particular, I note that Carl appears to have no
_formal_ training or study in Indonesian law except for a one-year exchange
program at the Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta in the 1990s and more
recently when he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from Atma Jaya University
in Jakarta in October 2012.[note: 483] No documents have been produced to show
the core modules or electives that were taken. If this was the sole basis for
Nava Bharat’s claim that Carl is an expert in Indonesian mining law, then I
would have no qualms about rejecting it. However, that is not the case. Nava
Bharat contends primarily that Carl has acquired substantial experience and
expertise in Indonesian mining law through his practice.[note: 484] I
therefore turn to consider Carl’s experience.

176 Nava Bharat’s case is that Carl had a “varied international corporate
practice” before joining Soewito Suhardiman Eddymurthy Kardono (“SSEK”) in
2004, and “[s]ince then”, he has been involved as a foreign adviser acting in
the role of a “transactional lawyer with a significant practice in mining
transactions”.[note: 485] In other words, Carl would only have, at best, nine
years of practice in relation to Indonesian mining law at the time when his
report was prepared. This appears consistent with the curriculum vitae of
Carl.[note: 486] While I accept that nine years appear to be a fairly short
period of time, I do not think that it is determinative of the issue. It would
also depend on the extent of Carl’s practice in this period of time.

177 I do not doubt that Carl had advised on several mining transactions in
Indonesia since 2004. It is, however, not his sole or primary area of
practice. Indeed, his practice at SSEK is “fairly wide ranging” and
“comprehensive”,[note: 487] and it includes mining, mergers and acquisitions,
bank and project financing, litigation, competition law and compliance
advice.[note: 488] Carl purports to be an expert in mining transactions
because he had “done a larger proportion of [his] practice in mining than
others”.[note: 489] Yet, out of the 35 items that Carl has described as
“indicative representations” of his practice at SSEK, only 11 related to
mining.[note: 490] Nava Bharat contends that it is not a “numbers game”,[note:
491] and that the nature and extent of the involvement would make a
difference.[note: 492] Nava Bharat says that Carl was involved substantively
in advising on Indonesian mining transaction which is “ _prima facie_ evidence
that he was competent and experienced enough _to give opinion on such a
transaction_ ” [emphasis added].[note: 493] It is apparent that Nava Bharat is
focused on whether Carl is sufficiently competent to advise on a mining
transaction. This is an unfortunate consequence of the misconception as to
Carl’s role in these proceedings. In my view, the mere fact that a lawyer is
capable of advising on mining transactions in Indonesia does not translate to
mean that he is an expert on Indonesian mining law. In any case, no evidence
has been adduced as to the nature and extent of Carl’s involvement in those
matters concerning Indonesian mining law. In this regard, Carl’s evidence was
that he would _always_ have to advise together with his Indonesian
colleagues.[note: 494] The same applies for the expert report.[note: 495] Carl
says that he works with Indonesian counsel because he cannot advise alone for
“only citizens of Indonesia may be admitted to practice law in
Indonesia”.[note: 496] However, that does not address my concern which is that
there is no way to ascertain the nature and extent of Carl’s involvement in
those matters. Carl had not said that his Indonesian colleagues were merely
placed on the files so as to allow him to skirt around the restrictions, and I
do not think that it is fair to draw such an inference.

178 I note that Carl had gone through the Bachelor of Laws programme between
2004 and 2012.[note: 497] This suggests that he did not have the requisite
expertise in Indonesian law, at least in the first few years when he first
started at SSEK.

179 Carl, in his affidavit, also pointed out that he has been acknowledged by
several “prestigious industry publications” as “a leading foreign lawyer in
Indonesia”.[note: 498] More specifically, Carl said that he had been “cited
for both corporate M&A transactions and projects & natural resources
transaction (which also includes mining)”.[note: 499] I note that Carl was
described by Chambers and Partners, around early 2013, as follows:[note: 500]

Michael Carl has been particularly active _in the past year_ , with highlights
including advising Intrepid Mines on its joint venture regarding an East Javan
gold mine. [emphasis added]

Upon closer scrutiny, and apart from the sole mention in relation to Intrepid
Mines which occurred very shortly before the present proceedings, it appears
that Carl has _not_ been specifically recognised for his expertise in mining
law. Instead, he was acknowledged for other areas of law, such as
telecommunications, securities and debt restructuring.[note: 501]

180 Accordingly, I find that, on the evidence before me, Nava Bharat had not
shown that Carl is an expert on Indonesian mining law for the purpose of s 47
of the EA.

(3) Matters not pleaded

181 Apart from the above, Rajaram also argues that a substantial part of
Carl’s report relates to matters that were not pleaded.[note: 502]
Specifically, Rajaram objects to sections 7, 10 and 11.1(g) of the expert
report where Carl dealt with the adequacy of the structure for the Transaction
as set out in the Master Agreement.[note: 503] Rajaram claims that these
constitute new arguments that took him by surprise at trial.[note: 504]

182 By way of background, Nava Bharat had on 11 April 2013 applied to amend
its statement of claim to, _inter alia_ , include the alleged failure of
Rajaram to properly advise it on how the Transaction should be structured to
best protect its interests. This was eight days after Nava Bharat filed Carl’s
AEIC attaching his expert report, and 11 days before the start of the first
tranche of the hearing. I disallowed the proposed amendments in relation to
the alleged failure to advise on structure on 12 April 2013. In the middle of
the trial, on 16 January 2014, Nava Bharat again attempted to introduce the
allegation by an amendment to the statement of claim. Again, I disallowed the
proposed amendments in relation to the alleged failure to advise on structure
on 30 April 2014.

183 It is trite law that parties are not permitted to rely on facts which have
not been pleaded: _The “Ohm Mariana” ex “Peony”_ [1993] 2 SLR(R) 113 at
[49]–[54]; _PT Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia and another v Kristle Trading Ltd and
another appeal_ [2009] 3 SLR(R) 689 at [30]. The rationale behind the rule is
the need to ensure, in the interest of fairness, that parties to a dispute are
informed of the case that they have to meet and are not caught by surprise. In
_Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd_ [2014] 3 SLR
524, the Court of Appeal said at [94] that:

We did not agree with Ms Foo's suggestion that she was at liberty to depart
from her pleaded case. In an adversarial system such as ours, the general rule
is that the parties, and for that matter the court, are bound by the
pleadings:  _Hadmor Productions_  _Ltd_  _v Hamilton_ [1983] 1 AC 191 at 233.
_The pleadings serve the important function of upholding the rules of natural
justice. They require a party to give his opponent notice of the case he has
to meet to avoid his opponent being taken by surprise at trial. They also
define the matters to be decided by the court_. [emphasis added]

184 In _Singapore Civil Procedure 2015_ vol I (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet and
Maxwell, 2015) (“ _Singapore Civil Procedure 2015_ ”) at para 18/7/12, the
learned editor pointed out that:

It is essential that a pleading, if it is not to be embarrassing, should state
those facts which will put those against whom it is directed on their guard,
and tell them what is the case which they will have to meet ... Further, each
party must plead all the material facts on which he means to rely at the
trial, otherwise he is not entitled to give any evidence of them at the trial.
... Where the evidence at the trial establishes facts different from those
pleaded, _e.g._ by the plaintiff as constituting negligence, which are not
just a variation, modification or development of what has been alleged but
which constitute a radical departure from the case as pleaded, the action will
be dismissed. ...

185 Further, the learned editor said at para 18/12/30 that:

Particulars must always be given in the pleading, showing in what respects the
defendant was negligent. The statement of claim “ought to state the facts,
upon which the supposed duty is founded, and the duty to the plaintiff with
the breach of which the defendant is charged” (_per_ Willes J. in _Gautret v
Egerton_ (1867) L.R. 2 C.P. 371, cited with approval by Lord Alverstone C.J.
in _West Rand Central Gold Mining Co. v. R._ [1905] 2 K.B. 391 at 400; _The
Kanawha_ (1913) 108 L.T. 433). Then should follow an allegation of the precise
breach of that duty, of which the plaintiff complains, and lastly, particulars
of the injury and damage sustained.

186 The question before me now is whether the alleged failure of Rajaram to
advise on the structure of the Transaction has been pleaded in the statement
of claim.

187 Looking at the statement of claim, I do not think that the alleged failure
to advise on structure has been specifically pleaded. It is most telling that
Nava Bharat had listed down 14 alleged breaches by Rajaram,[note: 505] but
failed to include the allegation that Rajaram had failed to properly advise on
the structure of the Transaction. Accordingly, I find that Nava Bharat should
not be allowed to adduce evidence to prove Rajaram’s alleged failure to advise
on the structure of the Transaction.

(4) Standards expected of expert witness

188 Rajaram contends, as an alternative basis, that no weight should be given
to Carl’s evidence as he has failed to comply with the standards expected of
an independent expert witness. This objection comprises of three points,
namely:

(a) Carl’s report did not comply with the provisions stipulated in the Rules
of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed).

(b) Carl did not understand the role that he was supposed to play as an expert
witness in these proceedings.

(c) Carl is biased and evasive when being cross-examined, and is not an
independent expert witness.

189 I have dealt with the second point above (see [161]–[168] above) and I
will deal with the remaining two points below.

(a) Requirements of expert evidence

190 Order 40A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court states that an expert’s report
must, _inter alia_ , “give details of any literature or other material which
the expert witness has relied on in making the report” and “contain a
statement setting out the issues which he has been asked to consider and the
basis upon which the evidence was given”. Specifically, the Court of Appeal in
_Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal_ [2008] 2
SLR(R) 491 (“ _Pacific Recreation_ ”) considered at [74]–[75] that:

74 It is a requirement under O 40A r 3(2)(_c_) of the Rules that the expert’s
report contains “a statement setting out the issues which he has been asked to
consider and the basis upon which the evidence was given”. Form 58 [of the
Subordinate Courts Practice Direction (2006 Ed)] fleshes out the details that
should be provided, as follows:

(a) the complete instructions which were given to the expert;

(b) a statement of facts leading to the expert’s opinion;

(c) the facts known by the expert to be true;

(d) the facts which the expert was instructed to assume; and

(e) the facts which the expert had assumed.

75 If these details are not present in the expert’s report, the court is
entitled to reject the opinion (see, for instance,  _[Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim
Lie Hoa [2003] SGHC 126 at [39]–[43]]_. It should be evident from the
requirements of Form 58 that the party engaging the expert itself needs to be
crystal clear about its instructions; in particular, solicitors should pay
special attention to the proper categorisation of “true” and “assumed” facts.

191 The requirements set out in O 40A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court are
important as they inform the court of the materials consulted by the expert
and enable the court to meaningfully evaluate the expert’s opinion. Thus, the
Court of Appeal in _Pacific Recreation_ observed at [65] that the requirements
under O 40A r 3(2) are mandatory except where the court directs otherwise.

192 Here, Carl did not, in his AEIC or report, set out the documents that he
reviewed,[note: 506] or the oral instructions that he received from Nava
Bharat.[note: 507] Carl referred repeatedly in his report to “the Documents”
but did not identify what constitutes them.[note: 508] In my view, the factual
basis for Carl’s opinion is unclear. One clear example would be the use of the
phrase “international or Singapore counsel” in the expert report. At the
hearing, Carl said that the use of the phrase was something that he
inferred:[note: 509]

Q:So you were told that Rajaram was the counsel for Nava Bharat, is that
right? And then you [looked] at the rest of the documents and you drew this
inference; is that right?

A:The use of the exact phrase “international or Singapore counsel”, yes, that
is what I infer. Raja roles [_sic_] as a counsel, however, was told to me, was
conveyed to me as a fact.

Q:That Mr Rajaram was the counsel for Nava Bharat?

A:Correct, that part was conveyed to me. The exact phrasing, and my apologies,
I didn’t realise -- this is the first time I have been on the stand, I didn’t
realise the exact language would be put to this level of scrutiny -- but the
phrasing “international or Singapore” is of my own device.

193 However, as I have alluded to earlier, the use of the phrase
“international or Singapore counsel” is inconsistent with Ashwin’s email to
Bill where he introduced Rajaram simply as Nava Bharat’s “Singapore legal
counsel” (see [103] above). As Carl had not indicated the documents that he
had reviewed for his report, it is unclear if he had taken the email into
consideration.

194 With no knowledge of the documents that Carl had reviewed, the
instructions that he was given, and the facts which he had assumed, it would
be impossible to assess the reliability of his opinion. The failure to set out
the documents that he has reviewed, among others, is significant given that
Carl had made certain conclusions “[b]ased on the Documents”.[note: 510] In
fact, Carl admitted that the quality of his opinion is affected by the
documents that he had reviewed.[note: 511] Accordingly, I would reject Carl’s
expert report on the basis that it had failed to comply with the requirements
under O 40A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court.

(b) Lack of independence

195 Rajaram also contends that, as a result of the confusion over Carl’s role
in the present proceedings, he had displayed signs that would suggest his lack
of independence. Specifically, Carl was said to be biased and evasive in his
oral testimony.

196 In _Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd
and another_ [2007] SGHC 50 at [207], Lai Siu Chiu J set out some guidelines
that are applicable when an expert witness exhibits a lack of independence,
including:

(a) an allegation of lack of independence goes to weight and not admissibility
of the evidence; and

(b) where there is a lack of independence or the potential for it, the court
has to evaluate the expert’s evidence with care and to accept any conflicting
opinion only if it is “reasonable, measured and backed by authority”.

197 The courts will not hesitate, in an appropriate case, to disregard or even
draw an adverse inference against expert evidence that “exceeds the judicially
determined boundaries of coherence, rationality and impartiality”: _JSI
Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm)_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 (“
_JSI Shipping_ ”) at [63].

198 What then constitutes partiality? The cases below offer some illustration.
In _Pacific Recreation_ , the Court of Appeal made observations at [71] on the
examples of partiality in the case of _JSI Shipping_ :

Examples of partiality in an expert’s evidence can be found in _JSI Shipping
(S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 at [58]-[62], where
this court commented (at [58]) that the expert evidence for both sides was
“rather partisan”. The respondent’s expert in that case made “sweeping
generalisation[s] redolent of a predisposition to shore up the respondent’s
stance” (at [59]), leapt to baseless conclusions adverse to the other party
and left out crucial portions of a quotation which cast an entirely different
light on the materials which he reproduced. ...

199 To further illustrate the point, I find it useful to refer to Lai J’s
decision in _Wong Meng Cheong and another v Ling Ai Wah and another_ [2012] 1
SLR 549 at [63], where she said:

... I found that both of the plaintiffs’ experts did display instances of
partiality to the plaintiffs’ case. They were selective in the presentation of
the relevant medical evidence as they had highlighted only material which
supported the plaintiffs’ case and omitted to mention matters adverse to it.

200 In the present case, Rajaram identified three aspects in which Carl has
displayed signs of partiality. The first is Carl’s use of the label
“international counsel”, which implies a broader scope of duties, to describe
Rajaram in his report even when there were no documents that have actually
described Rajaram as such.[note: 512] While Carl started with using the phrase
“Singapore or international counsel”,[note: 513] he eventually decided go with
“international counsel” when he was discussing on the role of Rajaram in the
Transaction.[note: 514] Secondly, Carl refused to provide a straightforward
answer to a simple question as to whether it would be easier for Nava Bharat
to seek repayment of the funds if it was structured as a loan as opposed to an
outright payment.[note: 515] This was notwithstanding that he had, in his own
expert report, stated that:[note: 516]

... the use of a loan rather than an outright payment provided a potential
advantage in that Nava Bharat would have a clearer right to seek repayment of
the funds if the Transaction did not succeed on the terms eventually agreed in
final documentation. ...

201 Rajaram suggests that this was because Carl did not want to give an answer
which he knew would benefit Rajaram’s case.[note: 517] Thirdly, Carl refused
to provide a straight answer to a simple question about whether the share
pledges offered a layer of protection for Nava Bharat.[note: 518] He initially
refused to agree,[note: 519] and even went so far as to consider that the
share pledges had no protective value,[note: 520] but eventually conceded that
“the structure is better with the share pledge than without the share
pledge”.[note: 521] Again, Rajaram claims that this was because Carl did not
want to give an answer which he knew would benefit Rajaram’s case.[note: 522]
Based on these points, Rajaram contends that Carl is not an independent expert
witness and his evidence should therefore be discounted.[note: 523]

202 I agree that Carl had displayed signs of partiality both in his expert
report and in the course of the hearing. Apart from the three points that were
raised by Rajaram, I also notice that Carl had taken the liberty to raise
points in his report even though they did not turn on Indonesian law. The
first relates to Carl’s view that Nava Bharat relied on Rajaram to represent
and protect its interests in the Transaction.[note: 524] This was a conclusion
that did not turn on Indonesian law. Notwithstanding that, Carl was willing to
discuss it substantially in his expert report. The second concerns a point of
Singapore law. Carl had expressly stated in his report that he would not deal
with matters of Singapore law.[note: 525] He was not qualified to do so.
Notwithstanding that, he went on to discuss the adequacy of SLP’s Advice on
Structure which was based on Singapore law.[note: 526] This is clearly beyond
his role as an expert witness, and he was aware of it. He therefore framed it
in the manner of a cursory remark. However, I do not think that it can mask
the obvious point, that is, Carl went out of his way in an attempt to advance
Nava Bharat’s case. I also find that Carl had taken a defensive stance at the
hearing, and was less than forthcoming with his answers, when it was one that
might be adverse to Nava Bharat’s case, even though the questions were fairly
straightforward. I would therefore give little weight to the evidence of Carl.

Dipesh Kumar Dipu

203 Dipesh Kumar Dipu (“Dipu”) is Nava Bharat’s expert witness on the issue of
the quantum of the alleged losses suffered by Nava Bharat. He is the founding
partner of Jenissi Management Consultants, an energy and resource industry-
focused consulting firm that advises clients on transformation, transaction
and strategic issues.[note: 527]

204 It was revealed at the hearing that Dipu had failed to disclose
information with regard to his connections with Ashwin, Nava Bharat and NBVL.
Dipu was the chief executive officer (“CEO”) of Maamba Collieries Limited
(“Maamba”), the largest coal-mining company in Zambia, from February to July
2010.[note: 528] However, he failed to disclose that Maamba was 65% owned by
Nava Bharat and, as CEO of Maamba, he reported to Ashwin and Prasad.[note:
529] He explained that he had disclosed that he was the CEO of Maamba and
therefore it was not necessary to specify that he used to report to
Ashwin.[note: 530] I find the explanation to be unsatisfactory.

205 Furthermore, Dipu was named in NBVL’s annual report of 2009/2010 as the
vice president (mining projects) of NBVL.[note: 531] This was not disclosed in
his curriculum vitae attached to his AEIC. However, he explains that his
appointment in NBVL was simply a matter of administrative convenience.[note:
532] Since it was “not really an employment”, he did not think it was right to
include it in his curriculum vitae.[note: 533] However, if that were true,
then it does not really cohere with the fact that he had included his position
as vice president (mining projects) of NBVL in his curriculum vitae uploaded
on a website called LinkedIn.[note: 534] Dipu sought to explain the difference
between the curriculum vitae attached to his AEIC and the curriculum vitae
uploaded on LinkedIn on the basis of the need to be “factually correct” for
the “purpose of the court”,[note: 535] but I have my doubts with regard to his
explanation. Indeed, Dipu accepted that he could have stated in his curriculum
vitae attached to his AEIC that he was the vice president (mining projects) of
NBVL but only as a matter of administrative convenience.[note: 536]

206 In my view, the circumstances taken as a whole would suggest that Dipu was
not being completely forthright about his connections with Ashwin, Nava Bharat
and NBVL.

Ken Pendergast

207 Ken Pendergast is the expert witness for Rajaram, SLP and Chandra on the
issue of quantum of alleged losses suffered by Nava Bharat. He is a partner
with the transaction advisory services practice of Ernst & Young and lead the
valuations and business modelling sub-service line in the Perth office. His
evidence pertains to the assessment of the loss and damage allegedly suffered
by Nava Bharat.[note: 537] I find him to be a generally good witness.

Issues

208 A number of issues arise for determination in this case. In S 846/2011,
the issues are as follows:

(a) Whether SLP and Rajaram owed concurrent duties in contract and in tort to
Nava Bharat.

(b) Whether the scope of the duty owed by SLP and Rajaram to Nava Bharat
includes advising on Indonesian law and commercial matters.

(c) Whether SLP and Rajaram had breached the duty owed to Nava Bharat.

(d) Whether the alleged breach of duty by SLP and Rajaram caused the alleged
losses suffered by Nava Bharat.

(e) Whether SLP and Rajaram had breached the fiduciary duty to Nava Bharat in
failing to disclose Rajaram’s relationship with Chandra.

209 In S 847/2011, the issues are as follows:

(a) Whether Chandra was involved with Jason Tan and Dicky Tan in a conspiracy
to defraud Nava Bharat.

(b) Whether Chandra owed a duty of care to Nava Bharat.

(c) Whether the alleged breaches by Chandra caused the alleged losses suffered
by Nava Bharat.

(d) Whether Chandra ought to have disclosed his relationship with Rajaram to
Nava Bharat.

210 I will deal first with the issues in S 846/2011 and then with those in S
847/2011.

Claim against SLP and Rajaram for breach of contract and negligence

Duties in contract and in tort

Concurrent duties in contract and in tort

211 The starting point is that a solicitor may, and would more often than not,
owe to his client concurrent duties in tort and in contract. This is the
position in Singapore (see, _eg_ , _Chew Kim Kee v Kertar and Co_ [2004] SGHC
95 (“ _Chew Kim Kee_ ”) at [15]; _Su Ah Tee_ at [72]) as well as other
jurisdictions such as England, Australia and Canada (see _Jackson & Powell on
Professional Liability_ (John Powell QC, Roger Stewart QC, Sir Rupert Jackson
gen eds) (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2012) (“ _Jackson & Powell_”) at paras
11-014 and 11-015). The rationale, as observed by Oliver J in _Midland Bank_
at 411 and accepted by Lord Goff of Chieveley in _Henderson and others v
Merrett Syndicates Ltd and others_ [1995] 2 AC 145 at 193C, is that the
assumption of responsibility, together with its concomitant reliance, would
often be found in a contractual context and, subject to any exclusion by the
contract, that would be sufficient to give rise to a tortious duty. Likewise,
Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in _Chew Kim Kee_ at [15] accepted that a relationship
of proximity brought about by a retainer may be sufficient to give rise to a
duty of care in negligence. It is also accepted in Singapore that a tortious
duty may co-exist with a contractual duty, to the extent that the contract
does not limit or exclude the tortious duty: _Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria
Creditanstalt AG_ [2011] 4 SLR 559 (“ _Go Dante Yap_ ”) at [20]. This is
subject to any countervailing policy considerations that might militate
against the imposition of a duty of care: _Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v
Defence Science & Technology Agency_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“ _Spandeck_ ”) at
[83].

212 In my view, there is no doubt that Rajaram owes concurrent duties to his
client, Nava Bharat, in contract and in tort. Rajaram had entered into a
solicitor-client relationship with Nava Bharat and this is evinced by, _inter
alia_ , the email from Rajaram to Ashwin dated 6 October 2008 which sets out
Rajaram’s scope of work for the Transaction. The relationship arising out of
the retainer, which reflects the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of
responsibility and reliance, satisfies the proximity limb of the _Spandeck_
test (see _Spandeck_ at [81]). There also appears to be no policy
considerations which might operate to negate a duty of care between solicitor
and client. Neither is there anything in the retainer that might limit or
exclude the tortious duty. The real issue lies with the scope of the duties.

Scope of the duties

213 The scope of a solicitor’s duty, in contract and in tort would depend on
the circumstances of the case. The duty must relate to the work undertaken by
the solicitor. As such, a key step in the inquiry would be to examine the
retainer with the client. In _Anwar Patrick Adrian and another v Ng Chong &
Hue LLC and another_ [2014] 3 SLR 761 (“ _Anwar_ ”) at [122], the Court of
Appeal observed that the scope of the solicitor’s _contractual_ duties to his
client is “informed by the terms of the retainer” and the retainer, in turn,
must be “defined by reference to what the solicitor is instructed to do by the
client and how he is expected to discharge his responsibilities in accordance
with the notion of a reasonably competent solicitor” (citing V K Rajah JC (in
_Lie Hendri Rusli v Wong Tan & Molly Lim (a firm)_ [2004] 4 SLR(R) 594 (“ _Lie
Hendri_ ”) at [45]). I should add that _Anwar_ concerned the solicitor’s
tortious duty to a third party, and the observation was made in light of the
Court of Appeal’s view that the scope of the tortious duty owed by a solicitor
to a third party must, in the absence of a retainer, necessarily be
ascertained by reference to the duty of care which the solicitor owes to the
client itself (at [119]–[120]). Following the footsteps of _Anwar_ , Chan Seng
Onn J in _AEL and others v Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC and another_ [2014] 3
SLR 1231 (“ _AEL_ ”) (no appeal against decision on negligence; see _Cheo Yeoh
& Associates LLC and another v AEL and others_ [2015] SGCA 26 at [12] and
[14]), at [32]–[33], accepted that the scope of a solicitor’s _tortious_ duty
would also have to be determined by reference to the scope of the retainer
with his client. In addition, Chan J considered at [39] that the contents of
the invoice rendered by the solicitor can be helpful in determining the scope
of the retainer.

214 It is not uncommon for Singapore courts to treat a solicitor’s duty in
contract and in tort as not only concurrent but also co-extensive in scope:
see, _eg_ , _Chew Kim Kee_ at [15]; _Su Ah Tee_ at [72]. Nevertheless, it
would ultimately depend on the facts of each case. Where a solicitor
undertakes work beyond the scope set out in the retainer, then the duty of
care in tort might be broader than the contractual obligation to exercise
reasonable care and skill. As the learned editors of _Jackson & Powell_
explain at paras 2-117 to 2-119:

(iv) _The Scope of the Concurrent Duty_

The tortious duty arises from the relationship between the parties and the
function which the professional person/firm is performing. ... Although
concurrent, these duties are not necessarily co-extensive. ...

(v) _Can the Concurrent Duty in Tort be More Extensive than the Contractual
Obligations?_

As a matter of principle, if the contract of retainer governs the whole of the
parties’ relationship, the answer should be no. If, however, the contract
governs only part of the parties’ dealings, in other aspects of the parties’
mutual activities there may be a tortious duty of care but no parallel
contractual obligation. ... In any particular case, it will be important to
establish whether the professional in effect undertook some further task or
gave some advice beyond that which he had contracted to give.

(vi) _Further Significance of the Contract_

Absent some act or advice beyond the scope of his contract, it is in the
contract between the professional and his client that the extent of his
tortious duty will be found. His tortious duty of care will be no greater in
scope than the implied contractual promise to exercise reasonable skill and
care. Moreover, the contract can have greater significance: by defining what
the professional is to do, it may explain the scope of his responsibility and
the extent to which responsibility or risk is to rest with his client or is to
be borne by others.

215 In the present case, the parties have proceeded on the basis that Nava
Bharat’s claims in contract and in tort overlapped completely. In particular,
Nava Bharat takes the position that the concurrent duties in contract and in
tort are co-extensive.[note: 538] The parties agree that the duty would be in
relation to Rajaram’s scope of work for the Transaction set out in his email
to Ashwin dated 6 October 2008.[note: 539] The relevant part of the email
states:[note: 540]

The scope of work will be:

1 We represent your interest in the negotiation, drafting and execution of the
Sale and Purchase Agreement, Joint Venture Agreements, Shareholder Agreements,
Leasing Agreement in respect of the Lease and all other Agreements and
documentation required to complete the matter;

2 We put into place the required corporate vehicle to facilitate the
transaction;

3 We liaise with the Indonesian counsel on the legal due diligence;

4 We liaise with Stanchart’s lawyers on the loan and security documentation.

216 In addition, the invoice issued by SLP on 19 February 2009 states
that:[note: 541]

To our professional charges for services rendered in connection with the above
mentioned matter, including :-

Our costs for preparing, drafting and engrossing the following document[s]:

1\. Shareholders Agreement;

2\. Nava Bharat Offtake Agreement;

3\. HC Offtake Agreement;

4\. Nava Bharat Loan Agreement;

5\. HC Loan Agreement;

217 Nava Bharat contends that Rajaram was supposed to “do everything”,[note:
542] including advising on matters involving Indonesian law as well as the
commercial risks and implications of entering, continuing and/or completing
the Transaction.[note: 543] As such, Rajaram would owe Nava Bharat a duty to
ensure that the due diligence exercise, especially for the Forestry Licence,
was properly done, and to advise on the structure of the Transaction.[note:
544] Rajaram, on the other hand, takes the view that he owes no duty to advise
on the structure of the Transaction (because, _inter alia_ , it involves
Indonesian law) or to provide commercial advice.[note: 545] At this juncture,
I note that counsel have sought to frame Rajaram’s duties in some detail, and
in this respect, I appreciate that the Court of Appeal in _Go Dante Yap_ at
[19]–[20] had cautioned against the framing of a duty narrowly to reflect the
specific act or omission in question such as to render the question of breach
nugatory.

218 At the end of the day, the scope of the duty must be determined with
reference to the work undertaken by Rajaram (see [213] above). The key
question, therefore, must be: what is the work undertaken by Rajaram in
relation to the Transaction, with regard to the retainer between him and Nava
Bharat and the circumstances of the case.

219 The scope of a solicitor’s duty cannot be viewed in isolation, and must be
considered in the context of the particular characteristics of the client. The
courts have routinely observed that there is a distinction between the scope
of duty owed to a sophisticated businessman and the proverbial layperson. In
_Satinder Singh Garcha v Uthayasurian Sidambaram and another_ [2009] SGHC 240
(“ _Satinder Singh_ ”) at [92], Quentin Loh JC held that:

[A lawyer’s duty to his client] is a duty that is not helpful to describe in
the abstract and it may vary depending on the characteristics of the client. A
youthful client, unversed in business affairs, might need explanation and
advice from his solicitor before entering into a commercial transaction that
would be pointless or even impertinent if given to an experienced businessman.

Likewise, Rajah JC in _Lie Hendri_ at [55] held that:

There is obviously an appreciable difference between the level of explanation
and circumspection required in dealing with a sophisticated or shrewd
businessman as compared with the proverbial layman. It might be said that an
impoverished explanation to a client with an impoverished knowledge about
worldly matters may in itself be evidence of negligence. This is to be
contrasted with the situation of the sophisticated or shrewd businessman who
can usually be assumed to have a measure of knowledge pertaining to the
purpose and purport of legal documentation coupled with an innate ability to
quickly size up and grasp the gist of his responsibilities. Donaldson LJ (as
he then was) accurately observed in  _Carradine Properties Ltd v D J Freeman &
Co_ (1982) 126 SJ 157; [1982] CA Transcript 8260, in relation to the
solicitor's duty of care to his client that:

[T]he precise scope of that duty will depend inter alia upon the extent to
which the client appears to need advice. An inexperienced client will need and
will be entitled to expect the solicitor to take a much broader view of the
scope of his retainer and of his duties than will be the case with an
experienced client.

The crux of the matter is that it can usually be assumed that a businessman
will not hesitate in raising queries to resolve any doubts. Language will
seldom be an issue with such individuals; by dint of their business background
they will employ the necessary measures or take steps to ensure they have a
grasp of any responsibilities they are undertaking.

220 I agree that, for the purpose of ascertaining the proper scope of duty
owed by the lawyer to his client, a distinction ought to be drawn between a
sophisticated businessman and the proverbial layperson. The law should not
require a lawyer to do what is plainly redundant; to do so would benefit
neither the lawyer nor the client. However, it is important to bear in mind
the cautionary remarks of V K Rajah JA in _Law Society of Singapore v
Uthayasurian Sidambaram_ [2009] 4 SLR(R) 674 at [79] that the duty to advise
remains even when dealing with a sophisticated businessman:

The second point that merited consideration was that the complainant is
certainly not the proverbial layman but a sophisticated businessman with some
measure of knowledge. As discussed previously … where the client is
_inexperienced_ , the scope of the solicitor's duty will naturally  _broaden_
as he will require and expect the solicitor to take a much broader
perspective. The scope of the duty of the solicitor depends on the _extent_ to
which the client appears to need advice:  _Carradine Properties Ltd v D J
Freeman & Co_ (1982) 126 SJ 157 (“ _Carradine_ ”) at 158. In  _Carradine_ ,
the solicitor successfully demonstrated at trial that his client did not
require him to advise upon the importance of checking the scope of his
insurance coverage. We agreed broadly with the proposition of the English
Court of Appeal in  _Carradine_ , except to emphasise that **_solicitors
should not rely on this to shirk their responsibilities even when dealing with
a sophisticated client - the duty to advise the client still remains and the
sole difference lies in deftly tailoring the advice to best suit the needs
(and abilities) of the individual_**. ... [emphasis in italics in original,
emphasis in bold italics added]

The law is clear, as Ang J puts it in _Su Ah Tee_ at [89], that even an
experienced client would still require some information and advice.

221 In the present case, I find that Ashwin, as the representative of Nava
Bharat, is commercially savvy and well-versed in the ways of business who
would not hesitate in raising queries to resolve any doubts. One example would
be his email to Rajaram on 23 December 2008 (see [35] above). Rajaram’s
evidence is that Ashwin is an intelligent man[note: 546] and this is borne out
from the latter’s performance before me on the witness stand. In addition,
Ashwin had a business team in Indonesia, headed by Bob Sundaram who has
experience in the coal procurement and power generation industry,[note: 547]
to advise him (see, _eg_ , [33], [42], [71]–[72], [90], [95] and [125] above).
Ashwin had also earlier dealt with the acquisition of the KP Concessions in
the Multi Guna Transaction (see [8] above) which, although it did not require
a forestry licence or encounter issues with the new mining law, would have
given him some idea as to what takes place in similar transactions. He would
no doubt have gained something from it. All in all, I find that Rajaram’s
scope of duty owed to Nava Bharat would be narrower than that owed to the
proverbial layperson.

222 In addition, I find that Rajaram had not undertaken to advise on matters
involving Indonesian law or commercial matters under the retainer. Neither has
Rajaram held himself out, over and above the scope of work under the retainer,
to do so. It follows that the duty owed by Rajaram to Nava Bharat would not
extend to cover any advice on Indonesian law or commercial aspects of the
Transaction. Let me elaborate.

(1) Advice on Indonesian law

223 I begin with the issue of whether Rajaram had undertaken to advise Nava
Bharat on the Indonesian law aspects of the Transaction.

(a) Case law

224 Nava Bharat contends that where a Singapore lawyer is involved in a cross-
border transaction with both Singapore and foreign law components, he is
obliged to determine and advise on the impact of the foreign law on the
transaction.[note: 548] In support of its contention, Nava Bharat cites the
case of _Elinoil-Hellenic Petroleum Co SA v Wee Ramayah & Partners_ [1999] 1
SLR(R) 977 (“ _Elinoil-Hellenic_ ”),[note: 549] and refers in particular to
[61], which reads:

Fifth, in their defence WRP also relied upon the fact that they were advising
a professional client, namely, SLO. I am afraid I do not think it right for
WRP to try to shift the blame to SLO, the Greek lawyers of Elinoil. On the
evidence before me, the Greek position and the Singapore position are
different. Mr Papadopoulos (PW1) was asked about a diploma course in shipping
law which he had undergone at the University of London some 26 years ago. In
my view, WRP cannot shift their responsibility as a Singapore solicitor to SLO
merely because PW1 had 26 years ago received some training in shipping law in
England. How could he be expected to know the position prevailing in
Singapore? From the questions which PW1 asked of WRP, he was clearly
unfamiliar. _The matter in hand involved shipping law and practice here. It is
incumbent upon a Singapore solicitor to advise his foreign clients, whether
professional or otherwise, on all relevant aspects relating to the retainer
which, in this case, was to secure Elinoil's claim_. [emphasis added]

225 I do not agree that _Elinoil-Hellenic_ stands for the proposition that
Nava Bharat seeks to advance. At [61], Chao Hick Tin J merely held that a
Singapore lawyer cannot rely on the fact that his client is a foreign lawyer
as a defence where the Singapore lawyer was negligent in providing advice on
Singapore law. More generally, I do not think that _Elinoil-Hellenic_
addressed the question of whether a Singapore lawyer is obliged to provide
advice on foreign law even though he may not be qualified to do so. Nava
Bharat’s reliance on _Elinoil-Hellenic_ is, therefore, misconceived.

226 Nava Bharat also cites the English case of _Gregory v Shepherds (a firm)_
[2000] PNLR 769 (“ _Gregory_ ”) to support its proposition that Rajaram’s
obligations to Nava Bharat extend to cover advice on Indonesian law even
though Rajaram may not be qualified to practice Indonesian law.[note: 550] In
_Gregory_ , the plaintiffs wanted to buy a property in Spain. They instructed
the defendants, who were English solicitors, to act for them. On the
defendants’ recommendation, a Spanish lawyer was instructed to carry out
searches on prior encumbrances on the property. He failed to do so. As a
result, the plaintiffs suffered loss. The English Court of Appeal found that
the English solicitors had “held themselves out as having a Spanish
conveyancing service” (at [29]) and were therefore obliged to confirm that the
searches that they had instructed the Spanish lawyer to carry out had been
satisfactorily completed before paying over the purchase money to the seller.

227 However, _Gregory_ can be distinguished from the present case. Rajaram had
never represented that he was qualified to provide advice on Indonesian law.
On the contrary, the facts show that Rajaram had made it clear to Nava Bharat
that he was unable to do so. As stated earlier (see [24] above), Ashwin knew
and accepted that Rajaram would be “obtaining the inputs of [ABNR] at all
stages”. Hence, _Gregory_ does not help Nava Bharat’s case in any way.

228 I do not think that there can be a general rule mandating that a lawyer
who is involved in a cross-border transaction, with both Singapore and foreign
law components, is obliged, in all cases, to advise on the impact of the
foreign law on the transaction. Neither do I consider it accurate to say that
a lawyer’s obligations to his client would necessarily extend to cover the
aspects of the transaction governed by foreign law even if he may not be
qualified to do so. At the end of the day, the question of whether a lawyer
has undertaken to advise on foreign law, either in his retainer or by his
conduct, must be decided based on the circumstances of the case. In this
regard, it would be pertinent to consider, _inter alia_ , whether it was
contemplated in the retainer that a foreign lawyer would be appointed to
advice on the transaction, and if so, whether the lawyer nevertheless advised
on foreign law.

229 I now proceed to consider the circumstances of the present case.

(b) Circumstances of the present case

230 Nava Bharat submits that Rajaram’s email dated 6 October 2008 which sets
out the scope of work undertaken in relation to the Transaction and the
invoice dated 19 February 2009 do not confine Rajaram’s work to Singapore
law.[note: 551] According to Nava Bharat, Rajaram was required to “liaise
with” ABNR on the legal due diligence, and this meant that Rajaram had to
ensure that the legal due diligence was in order.[note: 552] In addition, Nava
Bharat relies on the invoice to support its contention that Rajaram’s scope of
work included advising on Indonesian law.[note: 553] I do not agree with Nava
Bharat’s conclusion that Rajaram had undertaken to advise on Indonesian law
for the following reasons.

231 Even though Rajaram’s email dated 6 October 2008 states that he was to
“represent [Nava Bharat’s] interest in the negotiation, drafting and execution
of ... all other Agreements and documentation required to complete the
matter”[note: 554], it does not mean that Rajaram was required to advise on
Indonesian law. It is pertinent that the scope of work set out in Rajaram’s
email clearly states that Indonesian lawyers would be appointed to carry out
“legal due diligence”. This can only mean that the parties had envisaged that
ABNR, the Indonesian counsel in the present case, would advise on the aspects
of the Transaction that involve Indonesian law. It naturally follows that
Rajaram could not have been expected to advise on the same. In my view,
Rajaram is only required to provide ABNR with the necessary instructions and
information for it to conduct the “legal due diligence”, and at the end of it,
to convey the results to Nava Bharat. The use of the words “liaise with”
certainly does not mean that Rajaram was supposed to engage personally in
rendering legal advice on Indonesian law. This is underscored by the fact that
Rajaram is not qualified to give such advice, and as a result, ABNR was
appointed to advise on the Indonesian law aspects of the Transaction. While
Ashwin claimed that Rajaram was supposed to “read [the advice from ABNR] and
flag issues”,[note: 555] he agreed that Rajaram was not supposed to add or
take away anything from ABNR’s advice to Nava Bharat insofar as it involved
with Indonesian law.[note: 556]

232 I will first address Nava Bharat’s argument that Rajaram is not merely a
“post-box” such that he is only required to convey ABNR’s advice to Nava
Bharat.[note: 557] Nava Bharat claims that Rajaram undertook to advise Nava
Bharat on the Indonesian law aspects of the Transaction with input from ABNR
and this is clear from the circumstances, namely:[note: 558]

(a) Rajaram appointed ABNR and decided on its scope of work;[note: 559]

(b) Rajaram’s invoice to Nava Bharat included ABNR’s professional fees

(c) there was no direct correspondence between Nava Bharat and ABNR.[note:
560]

233 Based on the evidence before me, I find that ABNR was appointed by Nava
Bharat to act as its Indonesian lawyers for the Transaction. It was purely out
of convenience that Nava Bharat chose to communicate with ABNR through
Rajaram. This did not detract in any way from the fact that ABNR was engaged
by Nava Bharat as its Indonesian lawyers for the purpose of the Transaction.
While I appreciate that there may be cases where the lawyers (as opposed to
clients) appoint foreign counsel to advise them on a foreign law component of
a transaction, and those set of facts might potentially lead to a different
outcome, this was not such a case. The facts leading up to the appointment of
ABNR were undisputed. On Ashwin’s request, Rajaram provided a list of five
Indonesian law firms (see [19] above). Rajaram also told Ashwin that he could
approach other Indonesian law firms.[note: 561] ABNR was selected and one of
the reasons was because it was on the panel of lawyers for Standard Chartered
Bank, the intended financier for the Transaction.[note: 562] Nava Bharat had
not put forward, in its pleadings or through its witnesses’ evidence, the
point that ABNR were not its lawyers. On the contrary, Nava Bharat explicitly
refers to ABNR as its Indonesian lawyers in its opening statement,[note: 563]
Ashwin’s affidavit filed in support of an interlocutory application for S
847/2011,[note: 564] Bob Sundaram’s AEIC,[note: 565] as well as its statement
of claim in both suits.[note: 566] This coheres with ABNR’s understanding that
Nava Bharat was its client. In ABNR’s First Draft Report, it was stated
explicitly that ABNR had been “requested by [Nava Bharat] to conduct a legal
due diligence on [PTIC]” and the report was “prepared for Nava Bharat”.[note:
567] Likewise, in the ABNR’s Advice on Structure and the ABNR’s Advice on Loan
Agreement, it was stated that ABNR had “acted as the legal advisor in
Indonesia to Nava Bharat (Singapore) Pte Ltd”.[note: 568] While Ashwin stated
categorically at the start that ABNR was “acting for [SLP] who engaged
them”,[note: 569] he subsequently accepted that ABNR was representing “the
buyer”, that is, Nava Bharat.[note: 570] I find that Ashwin was evasive and
inconsistent in his evidence on the role of ABNR in the Transaction. He also
sought to cast doubts on the solicitor-client relationship between Nava Bharat
and ABNR by insisting that Nava Bharat had not paid ABNR’s fees directly and
that there was no direct communication between them (see [232(b)]–[232(c)]
above). However, it cannot be disputed that Nava Bharat had reimbursed SLP for
the fees paid to ABNR,[note: 571] and that emails from ABNR to Rajaram had
been copied to Ashwin.[note: 572] As such, I do not agree with Nava Bharat
that Rajaram had undertaken to advise on the Indonesian law aspects of the
Transaction with input from ABNR. I find that Rajaram was required under the
retainer to provide ABNR with the necessary instructions and information for
it to conduct the “legal due diligence”, and at the end of it, to convey the
results to Nava Bharat. This was exactly what Rajaram had done.

234 Nava Bharat refers to the case of _Yeo Yoke Mui v Ng Liang Poh_ [1999] 2
SLR(R) 701 for the proposition that it is not sufficient for a lawyer to
merely pass documents to a client without advice.[note: 573] However, I do not
think that the proposition can be extended to require a lawyer to advise on
the legal opinion of the client’s foreign lawyer. This is particularly so
given that (a) Rajaram was not trained in Indonesian law and ABNR was engaged
precisely for that reason, and (b) Ashwin is a smart individual who is capable
of understanding the advice from ABNR and would, in any case, be more than
capable of voicing his concerns with ABNR (either directly or through Rajaram)
if he had any.

235 I should also address Nava Bharat’s contention that Rajaram’s work must
commensurate with his fees. According to Nava Bharat, Rajaram’s fees would
indicate the extent of his duty and responsibility within his scope of
work.[note: 574] Nava Bharat suggests that Rajaram’s fees of S$100,000 (for
the conduct of the Transaction up to initial completion, excluding ABNR’s
fees[note: 575]) were manifestly excessive if it did not include advising on
ABNR’s input but merely conveying the same.[note: 576] As such, Nava Bharat
submits that Rajaram’s scope of work must have included liaising with ABNR on
the Indonesian law aspects of the Transaction _and_ advising Nava Bharat on
the same.[note: 577] I pause here to note that this appears inconsistent with
Ashwin’s evidence that Rajaram was not supposed to add or take away anything
from ABNR’s advice to Nava Bharat insofar as it involved with Indonesian
law.[note: 578] I further note that Nava Bharat had not objected to Rajaram’s
fees when it received SLP’s invoice for S$100,000. It appears to be an
afterthought on the part of Nava Bharat. In any case, I do not think that Nava
Bharat had shown that the fees would not commensurate with Rajaram’s scope of
work if it did not include advising on the Indonesian law aspects of the
Transaction with ABNR’s input. Even if that were to be the case (and I _do
not_ think it is), it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that
Rajaram’s scope of work must have included advice on Indonesian law.

236 Furthermore, the invoice (reproduced above at [216]) does not say anything
different from the scope of work set out in Rajaram’s email dated 6 October
2008. I note that the invoice did not use the words “preparing” and “drafting”
for the documents governed by Indonesian law, _eg_ , the Loan Agreement
between Dicky Tan and Nava Bharat. On the evidence, it was clear that the
templates for the agreements governed by Indonesian law were drafted by
ABNR.[note: 579] There is also nothing to suggest that Rajaram had undertaken
to advise on Indonesian law or that he had actually done so. Contrary to Nava
Bharat’s submission, it was more likely that Rajaram was reviewing the
documents to ensure that they do not run contrary to Nava Bharat’s
instructions as well as the agreements governed by Singapore law. This is
supported by the contemporaneous evidence which shows that Rajaram had sought
ABNR’s advice on the aspects of the Transaction which involved Indonesian law
(see [242] below).

237 At this juncture, it would be apposite for me to consider Nava Bharat’s
contention that Rajaram had advised on the Indonesian law aspects of the
Transaction and therefore Rajaram’s assertion that the scope of work did not
cover Indonesian advice was simply a “fabrication”.[note: 580] I understand
Nava Bharat to mean that Rajaram’s conduct shows that the scope of work set
out in the email dated 6 October 2008 includes advising on Indonesian law (as
opposed to Rajaram acting beyond the scope of work in the retainer (see [214]
above)).[note: 581] This must follow from Nava Bharat’s position that
Rajaram’s duties in contract and in tort are co-extensive (see [215] above).
Put simply, Nava Bharat is saying that Rajaram’s subsequent conduct revealed
that the scope of work in the retainer includes advice on Indonesian law.
However, Nava Bharat had not explained why it would be appropriate in this
case to have regard to the subsequent conduct of Rajaram in the interpretation
of the terms of the retainer which is, in essence, a contract. This is similar
to the case of _Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and
another appeal_ [2013] 4 SLR 193, where the Court of Appeal at [109] refused
to allow the parties to use extrinsic evidence including subsequent conduct to
justify their respective contentions as to the proper interpretation of the
terms in the contract because the parties did not submit on “the precise
nature or limits of the extrinsic evidence which they were relying on” and
“whether or why [the Court of Appeal] should have recourse to such extrinsic
evidence”. In the same manner, I would reject Nava Bharat’s attempt to rely on
subsequent conduct to advance its contentions as to the scope of work in the
retainer.

238 In any event, I find that Rajaram had not advised Nava Bharat on the
Indonesian law aspects of the Transaction. In this respect, Rajaram had acted
in accordance with the scope of work set out in his email dated 6 October 2008
(see [231] above). In its submissions, Nava Bharat highlighted several
instances where Rajaram had allegedly advised Nava Bharat on Indonesian law,
namely:

(a) Rajaram spoke with Ashwin on Indonesian law when they first met on 3
October 2008 (see [18] above);[note: 582]

(b) Rajaram’s email to Ashwin on 15 October 2008 (see [24] above), after the
Heads of Agreement was executed, mentioned that one of the agreements to be
drafted was a nominee arrangement;[note: 583]

(c) Rajaram’s opinion dated 7 November 2008 (see [29] above) allegedly
included advice on Indonesian law;[note: 584]

(d) Rajaram prepared the SLP’s Advice on Structure (see [55] above) which
allegedly included advice on Indonesian law;[note: 585]

(e) Rajaram’s involvement in the restructuring of the Transaction in light of
the new mining law (see [37] above);

(f) Rajaram’s email to Ashwin on 15 January 2009 (see [40] above) on the
intended acquisition of the jetty facilities which is governed by Indonesian
law;[note: 586]

(g) Rajaram’s opinion on the Mine Operating Service Agreement which was
governed by Indonesian law;[note: 587]

(h) Rajaram allegedly prepared the Loan Agreement and said that the loan
should be given to Dicky Tan instead of PTIC (see [43]–[46] above);[note: 588]

(i) Rajaram suggested that certain amendments be made to the draft Coal Mining
Agreement (see [59] above) which is governed by Indonesian law;[note: 589] and

(j) Rajaram advised on the Variation Agreement and the Addendum
Agreement.[note: 590]

However, I do not think that they support Nava Bharat’s contention.

239 The brief discussion between Rajaram and Ashwin during their first meeting
on 3 October 2008 (see [238(a)] above), before Rajaram was appointed as Nava
Bharat’s counsel, was merely a “beauty parade” to impress,[note: 591] and
would not in any way constitute a representation to Ashwin that Rajaram would
be advising Nava Bharat on Indonesian law if he was appointed. Ashwin
understood this because he told Rajaram shortly thereafter, on 6 October 2008,
that it was important to engage Indonesian counsel for the Transaction (see
[19] above). This had led to the appointment of ABNR.

240 In addition, I do not agree that Rajaram could have advised Nava Bharat on
the nominee arrangement (see [238(b)] above) given that it had been decided
_before_ Rajaram was appointed to act for Nava Bharat.[note: 592] All that
Rajaram had done was merely to inform Ashwin that an agreement would be
required to reflect the nominee arrangement which was previously agreed upon
between Ashwin and Dicky Tan. Indeed, Rajaram could not have advised Nava
Bharat _against_ the use of a nominee arrangement since he was not qualified
to do so (see [231] above).

241 As for Rajaram’s opinion dated 7 November 2008 as well as the SLP’s Advice
on Structure (see [238(c)]-[238(d)] above), Rajaram was merely conveying the
advice from ABNR to Nava Bharat. Rajaram stated in the opinion dated 7
November 2008 and the SLP’s Advice on Structure that they were specifically
restricted to Singapore law:[note: 593]

This opinion is limited to Singapore law of general application at the date of
this opinion as currently applied by the Singapore courts, and is given on the
basis that it will be governed by and construed in accordance with Singapore
law. We have made no investigation of, and do not express or imply any views
on, the laws of any country other than Singapore.

This is consistent with the rest of the opinion, where Rajaram addressed
issues concerning Indonesian law by either referring to ABNR’s advice (which
was attached to the SLP’s Advice on Structure[note: 594]) or reiterating
it.[note: 595] Apart from Nava Bharat’s bald assertion, there was nothing to
show that Rajaram did anything more.[note: 596] In any case, Ashwin knew that
ABNR, and not Rajaram, was advising on the legality of the structure of the
Transaction.[note: 597]

242 I also do not consider Rajaram to be advising on Indonesian law when he
made certain proposals and suggestions which were subject to the advice and
approval of ABNR. I do not see how, logically speaking, a proposal or
suggestion that is _subject_ to advice on Indonesian law can itself be an
advice on Indonesian law. This would address Nava Bharat’s allegations in
relation to Rajaram’s involvement on the restructuring of the Transaction in
light of the new mining law (see [238(e)] above),[note: 598] and the intended
acquisition of the jetty facilities (see [238(f)] above).[note: 599] Also, I
do not think that it is accurate to say that Rajaram was advising on
Indonesian law when he proposed certain amendments to the draft Coal Mining
Agreement (see [238(i)] above).[note: 600] In particular, I note that the
draft Coal Mining Agreement was subsequently sent to the Indonesian law firm,
Susanto, Rajasa & Associates, for advice on its enforceability under
Indonesian law (see [59] above).

243 Nava Bharat’s contention that Rajaram had advised on the Mine Operating
Service Agreement (see [238(g)] above) is also unmeritorious.[note: 601] It is
pertinent to note that the alleged “opinion” on Indonesian law arose in the
course of discussion between Rajaram and ABNR. Nava Bharat was _not_ privy to
the correspondence at the material time. It follows that Rajaram could not
possibly have been advising Nava Bharat on Indonesian law. Instead, I find
that Rajaram was checking with ABNR if he was right to think that cl 18, the
“severability” clause, would save the other parts of the agreement even if any
part was rendered illegal by the new mining law.[note: 602] Woody confirmed
that to be his understanding.

244 Nava Bharat also contends that Rajaram had prepared the Loan Agreement and
advised that the loan to be given to Dicky Tan rather than PTIC (see [238(h)]
above).[note: 603] However, I accept that Rajaram did not draft the Loan
Agreement but merely filled in the particulars for Nava Bharat based on the
template provided by ABNR.[note: 604] This, alone, cannot constitute advice on
Indonesian law. Moreover, it would be wrong to say that Rajaram was advising
on Indonesian law when he was informing ABNR about the practical restraints
faced by Nava Bharat, _ie_ , Dicky Tan needed the US$3m to be paid to
him,[note: 605] and there was a risk that PTIC would not be able to repay the
loan if the KP Concessions (which were PTIC’s only assets) were not renewed
under the new mining law.[note: 606]

245 Further, Nava Bharat’s allegation that Rajaram advised on the Indonesian
aspects of the Transaction, including the Variation Agreement and the Addendum
Agreement is misplaced given that they are not governed by Indonesian
law.[note: 607]

246 As such, I do not agree with Nava Bharat that Rajaram had advised Nava
Bharat on Indonesian law. Even if Rajaram had done so, I do not think that
Nava Bharat had in fact relied on it or, for that matter, that it was
reasonable for Nava Bharat to do so (given that it knew Rajaram was not
trained in Indonesian law and had appointed ABNR). Indeed, I find that Nava
Bharat was relying on ABNR as well as Bob Sundaram and Nava Bharat’s
Indonesian team instead.

247 Accordingly, I find that Rajaram’s scope of work in the retainer does not
extend to advice on Indonesian law.

(2) Commercial advice

248 I move on next to the issue of whether Rajaram’s scope of work includes
advising Nava Bharat on the commercial aspects of the Transaction. Nava Bharat
contends that Rajaram is obliged to advise on the commercial risks and
implications of entering, continuing and/or completing the Transaction.[note:
608] Rajaram takes the opposite view. In my view, Rajaram’s scope of work did
not extend to commercial advice.

249 The general rule is that a solicitor is not obliged to provide his client
with commercial advice. In _Su Ah Tee_ , Ang J commented that “it is not
necessary for a solicitor to explain to his client matters of a commercial or
economic nature” (at [87]), and that “a solicitor has no general duty to
advise a client on matters of business since it is for the client to make his
own commercial decision” (at [98]). She referred to _Jackson & Powell_ at para
11-177, which states:

**Advice on matters of business**. A solicitor is not a general adviser on
matters of business, unless he specifically agrees to act in that capacity.
Thus he is not generally under a duty to advise whether, legal considerations
apart, the transaction which he is instructed to carry out is a prudent one,
or whether the other party is solvent and whether guarantees should be sought.
...

250 The scope of a solicitor’s duty to his client would not, generally
speaking, include commercial advice. A solicitor cannot be expected to be
responsible for the commercial viability or wisdom of entering into a
transaction; that is something that the client is solely responsible for.
Moreover, a solicitor is not required to go beyond the scope of the retainer
to advise his client on the commercial aspects of the transaction (see _Anwar_
at [129]). In a similar vein, Loh JC in _Satinder Singh_ at [100] rejected the
allegations of professional negligence made against a solicitor because they
related to the commercial aspects of the transaction which the client was best
placed to assess.

251 As shown above, the authorities are clear that a solicitor is not
generally obliged to provide his client with commercial advice. The rationale
is clear. A solicitor is not, and should not be, the insurer of commercial
misjudgements and a legal advice is not a warranty that the transaction will
be free of risks and problems: _Lie Hendri_ at [43]. However, there could, in
some cases, be difficulty in drawing a distinction between legal and
commercial advice. The learned editors of _Jackson & Powell_ explain at para
11-180 that:

**Difficulty of drawing a distinction.** The distinction between legal and
business matters is a question of degree. Thus in _County Personnel Ltd v Alan
R Pulver Co_ the plaintiffs took an underlease which had an unusual rent
review lease whereby the rent was increased at the same percentage as the
headlease. The defendant solicitors were found to be negligent in failing to
advise the plaintiffs of the risks they faced unless the initial rents were
known, because the mesne lessor might, as happened, have no reason to hold out
for as low a rent as possible, for his lease was cheaper than the underlease
which was at a considerably inflated value. They should have advised that both
rents should be ascertained, and that the market level of rents should be
investigated. Bingham L.J. said:

“I cannot accept the distinction drawn between legal consequences and
financial implications, because in this case the significance of the legal
consequences lay in the financial implications.”

The case should be contrasted with _Reeves v Thrings Long_. The plaintiff, who
was a businessman, wished to purchase a hotel. His solicitors, the defendants,
advised him that the access to the hotel car park was by licence only, with no
guarantee of renewal were the licence to be brought to an end. _A majority of
the Court of Appeal considered that there was no duty on the solicitor to
advise his client upon the commercial implications or risks of the access
provisions. Unlike the clause in County Personnel Ltd v Alan R Pulver Co, the
implications of this clause were obvious_.

[emphasis added]

252 In this regard, the discussion by Rajah JC in _Lie Hendri_ at [62] is also
pertinent:

A solicitor’s role, in the absence of specific instructions and special
circumstances, is plainly to give legal as opposed to commercial or financial
advice. There could, however, be unusual cases where there is some difficulty
in drawing a distinct line between legal advice, financial consequences and
the wisdom of the transaction. _In determining whether such a duty arises,
several imponderables figure in the assessment. Particular regard ought to be
given to the client’s background and to the context in which the retainer is
to be defined and deciphered_. [emphasis added]

253 In the present case, it is clear from the retainer (reproduced above at
[215]) that Rajaram’s scope of work extends only to legal and not commercial
advice. There is nothing to suggest that Rajaram had held himself out to be
Nava Bharat’s commercial adviser. Also, I do not think that Nava Bharat had
relied on Rajaram to advise on the commercial aspects of the Transaction or
that it would be reasonable for Nava Bharat to do so. As mentioned earlier,
Ashwin, the representative of Nava Bharat, is commercially savvy and well
assisted by, _inter alia_ , his business team in Indonesia headed by Bob
Sundaram. Indeed, there is no evidence before me that Ashwin had relied on any
commercial advice from Rajaram.

(3) Summary on the scope of the duties

254 For the reasons set out above, I find that Rajaram has a duty to exercise
reasonable care and skill in relation to the work undertaken for the
Transaction as set out in the retainer, which does _not_ include advice on
Indonesian law or commercial aspects of the Transaction.

Alleged breaches

255 I shall now consider the alleged breaches by Rajaram.

256 I start with considering the requisite standard of care to be applied when
determining whether there has been a breach of duty. It is trite law that the
standard of care owed by a solicitor to his client is that of a reasonably
competent solicitor. The question to ask is whether it was an error that no
reasonably competent solicitor would have made. In asking this question, one
must take into account all of the relevant surrounding circumstances. In the
words of Rajah JC in _Lie Hendri_ at [42]:

It is hornbook law that a solicitor is expected to exercise the care and skill
of a reasonably competent solicitor in discharging his duties under the
retainer. _In assessing the standard of care to be reasonably expected of a
solicitor, the factual backdrop is of paramount importance._ Abstract notions
of skill and competence often add little to resolving the situation and have
to be applied with vigilance when meandering through the undergrowth of facts.
It must be appreciated that there is no magic formula that can reconcile the
myriad of case law principles and any attempt to distil such principles must
be tinged with pragmatism. In other words, no single touchstone will suffice
to illuminate or unravel the existence and extent of a duty in any given
matrix. [emphasis added]

257 Judith Prakash J in _Tan & Au LLP v Goh Teh Lee_ [2012] 4 SLR 1 (“ _Tan &
Au_”) agreed with the observations of Rajah JC in _Lie Hendri_ (which was
affirmed in _Zhou Tong and others v Public Prosecutor_ [2010] 4 SLR 534 at
[15]). In this regard, Prakash J held that a solicitor should be judged in
light of the circumstances at the time and without the benefit of hindsight
(at [63]–[66]), as well as taking into account the “pressing time constraints”
that he was facing (at [67]). In the present case there were various instances
where extreme tight deadlines were unilaterally imposed by the parties (see,
_eg_ , [37] and [41] above). Furthermore the events spanned a relatively long
period of time with a number of twists and turns along the way. As such, I do
not think it is fair to say that Rajaram was or was not under time pressure
over the entire period. I would, accordingly, take into account, where
appropriate, the effects of those tight deadlines on the standard of care for
which Rajaram’s conduct ought to be measured against.

258 With that, I proceed to examine the specific allegations made by Nava
Bharat against Rajaram. For convenience, the alleged breaches are as follows:

(a) failing to advise on the implications of not having the Forestry Licence;

(b) failing to advise against completion without Forestry Licence;

(c) failing to advise for the loan of US$3m to be held in escrow;

(d) restructuring the Transaction as a loan to Dicky Tan (instead of PTIC);

(e) failing to provide for an effective mechanism to convert the debt into
shares in PTIC;

(f) failing to advise on the implications of the new mining law on the Mine
Operating Service Agreement;

(g) failing to safeguard interest by putting in place a defective pledge; and

(h) failing to advise on the right to exercise the exit option.

259 The first three alleged breaches (see [258(a)]–[258(c)] above) relate to
the Forestry Licence and the next three alleged breaches concern the new
mining law (see [258(d)]–[258(f)] above). The last two alleged breaches (see
[258(g)]–[258(h)] above) pertains to the share pledges and exit option. I will
deal with each alleged breach in turn.

Alleged breaches relating to the Forestry Licence

(1) Failure to advise on implications of not having Forestry Licence

260 Nava Bharat contends that Rajaram failed to advise it on the implications
of the absence of the Forestry Licence.[note: 609] Nava Bharat claims that
Rajaram knew about the importance of the Forestry Licence but did not advise
Nava Bharat on it.[note: 610] According to Nava Bharat, Rajaram should have
sought input from ABNR and advised Nava Bharat on all the implications and
potential pitfalls of proceeding with the Transaction without the Forestry
Licence.[note: 611] In particular, it was important for Nava Bharat to
understand how the absence of the Forestry Licence would have affected the
Transaction, _eg_ , total prohibition on operations or mere fine.[note: 612]

261 I do not agree with Nava Bharat that Rajaram had breached his duty. I
accept that Rajaram did not advise on the implications of not having the
Forestry Licence. But I also find the omission unsurprising (and immaterial)
because he was neither obliged nor qualified to do so. It was a task that lies
squarely within the purview of Nava Bharat’s Indonesian lawyers, ABNR.

262 It was evident from Rajaram’s email to Ashwin on 6 October 2008 that both
of them knew that Indonesian counsel would have to be appointed “for due
diligence and advice on Indonesian law” as well as to “assist in documentation
to comply with Indonesian legal requirements”.[note: 613] This is corroborated
by Ashwin’s evidence that “it was clear in [his] mind on 6 October that [Nava
Bharat] would have an Indonesian law firm doing due diligence on the
Indonesian aspects of the transaction”.[note: 614] As I have earlier found,
Rajaram’s duty did not extend to cover advice on Indonesian law. To be clear,
it is undisputed that the issue of whether a Forestry Licence was required was
an issue governed by Indonesian law for which Nava Bharat had to look to the
Indonesian lawyers, ABNR, for advice.[note: 615]

263 Nava Bharat appears to be alluding that Rajaram knew about the need for
the Forestry Licence but had omitted to inform Nava Bharat about it.[note:
616] I do not think that such a characterisation of what happened was
accurate. The issue of the Forestry Licence was first raised in ABNR’s First
Draft Report.[note: 617] While there were earlier indications that certain
searches with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources would have to be
conducted,[note: 618] they did not identify the need for the Forestry Licence
as a potential concern. Rajaram received the ABNR’s First Draft Report on 26
October 2008 and forwarded it, together with ABNR’s email, to Ashwin two days
later.[note: 619]

264 Ashwin claimed that Rajaram was supposed to “read [the advice from ABNR]
and flag issues”.[note: 620] I find this argument contrived. The ABNR’s First
Draft Report was an 18-page report inclusive of a 4-page executive summary.
The language was clear. It was accepted that Rajaram was not supposed to add
or take away anything from ABNR’s advice to Nava Bharat insofar as it involved
Indonesian law.[note: 621] I do not think that Ashwin, given his abilities,
would have appreciated, much less required, any assistance in understanding
the advice from ABNR. More importantly, ABNR specifically highlighted in its
email, to which the ABNR’s First Draft Report was attached, that a Forestry
Licence might be required.[note: 622] The relevant parts read:[note: 623]

5\. The Exploitation KP of BHM is located in the Convertible Production Forest
... Convertible Production Forest means forest which is planned to be used for
transportation, transmigration, residences, agriculture, plantation, industry,
etc. ... Convertible Production Forest cannot be converted into mining area.
...

However, _BHM may still conduct the mining activity in the Convertible
Production Forest by obtaining the lend-use permit from the Minister of
Forestry_ ...

[emphasis added]

265 The email was forwarded to Ashwin as well.[note: 624] Rajaram’s duty with
respect to Indonesian law was only to convey the advice of ABNR to Nava Bharat
for its consideration, and this was precisely what he did. It is also apparent
that ABNR’s advice covered the implications of going ahead with the
Transaction without the Forestry Licence. At the hearing, Ashwin accepted that
ABNR’s email dated 26 October 2008 “provided advice that [Nava Bharat] would
need a forestry licence before it could mine”.[note: 625]

266 Ashwin insisted that he did not read ABNR’s email _or_ the ABNR’s First
Draft Report.[note: 626] However, I find this incredible. The Transaction was
an important deal for Nava Bharat,[note: 627] and Ashwin knew that it was
important to get Indonesian counsel to perform due diligence.[note: 628] The
first line of Rajaram’s email to Ashwin reads “[t]he interim due diligence
report is annexed”.[note: 629] This must have piqued his interest. Ashwin
conceded that he was curious but nevertheless persisted that he did not look
at either the ABNR’s First Draft Report or ABNR’s email.[note: 630] I also
note that Ashwin had not mentioned this in his AEIC.[note: 631] Ashwin
explained that he was waiting for Rajaram to advise him on it.[note: 632] This
is most unusual given his knowledge that Rajaram could not advise on
Indonesian law.[note: 633] In any case, it was not within Rajaram’s duty to do
so. Rajaram discharged his duty to convey ABNR’s advice to Nava Bharat, and it
does not matter that Ashwin failed to read ABNR’s email or the ABNR’s First
Draft Report.

267 The parties also dispute over whether Rajaram spoke to Ashwin over the
phone on the issue of the Forestry Licence after it was surfaced in the ABNR’s
First Draft Report. Nava Bharat vehemently denies that any such tele-
conversation took place,[note: 634] while Rajaram testifies otherwise.[note:
635] Since Rajaram was not obliged to advice Ashwin on the Forestry Licence
which is a matter of Indonesian law, nothing turns on this. Nevertheless, I
find that there would, in all likelihood, be a call between Rajaram and Ashwin
on the issue of the Forestry Licence shortly after the ABNR’s First Draft
Report. Nava Bharat’s sole point is that there was no attendance notes to
support Rajaram’s evidence.[note: 636] However, the proper inference to be
drawn in light of the lack of attendance notes must be one based on the
circumstances of the case. In the present case, I do not think that an adverse
inference is justified on the facts. Ashwin’s evidence was that he did not
read ABNR’s email or the ABNR’s First Draft Report attached thereto because he
understood Rajaram to be saying that he would “get back to [him]”.[note: 637]
In particular, he went on to say that a lot of his dealings with Rajaram were
“over the phone”.[note: 638] If this was true, and bearing in mind that Ashwin
was concerned with the results of the due diligence done by ABNR over what he
considered to be an important deal for Nava Bharat (see [266] above), I do not
think that Ashwin would have simply ignored or forgotten about it. Ashwin
would likely have taken the initiative to call Rajaram even if Rajaram had not
done so.[note: 639]

268 Apart from the ABNR’s First Draft Report and the email which was forwarded
to Ashwin on 28 October 2008, there were three other instances on which Ashwin
was informed, _before_ the initial completion, that a Forestry Licence was
necessary for mining, namely:

(a) minutes of the meeting on 19 December 2008 (see [33] above), which was
attended by Ashwin, where it was recorded that “... before mining could start
a licence from Federal Government has to be obtained”.[note: 640]

(b) Bob Sundaram’s email to Ashwin on 19 December 2008 (see [35] above), which
stated that the Mine was located in a HPK Forest and “the approval letter from
Federal Forestry Dept” was required.[note: 641]

(c) Karupiah’s due diligence report (see [35] above), which stated that the
Mine was in a HPK Forest and there is a “need to procure approval from
Forestry Minister before mining”.[note: 642]

269 Ashwin confirmed at the hearing that he was told at least three, if not
four times, before initial completion that there was a requirement for the
Forestry Licence to be obtained if he wanted to start mining.[note: 643]
Further, Rajaram was aware that Ashwin had been “warned about these
issues”.[note: 644] It is clear that, in these circumstances, there was
nothing else that Rajaram could have done with regard to the issue on the
Forestry Licence. In this connection, Nava Bharat suggests that Rajaram should
have advised against completion and I will turn to address that allegation
later (see [271] below).

270 Before I proceed to the next alleged breach, I should address Nava
Bharat’s contention, brought up as a secondary point, that Rajaram failed to
advice on the intricacies of the application procedure, the costs involved and
the estimated time for the approval.[note: 645] This, again, is a task that
lies within the purview of ABNR (see [261]–[262] above). It follows that the
omission on the part of Rajaram would not constitute a breach. In any event, I
note that Nava Bharat was in fact advised on these points. The procedure for
the application was set out in detail in ABNR’s email dated 26 October
2008.[note: 646] This is the same email which first identified the issue with
the Forestry Licence. In addition, Nava Bharat’s Indonesian team conducted the
due diligence on the costs involved and time necessary to secure the
approval.[note: 647]

(2) Failure to advise against completion without Forestry Licence

271 As I have alluded to earlier at [269], the next alleged breach is that
Rajaram failed to advise Nava Bharat that (a) if the Forestry Licence was not
available, there should be no completion and (b) if there was to be
completion, it had to be on very stringent conditions.[note: 648]

272 At the outset, I should point out three observations. First, the lack of
the Forestry Licence does not _per se_ prevent the acquisition of the Mine,
but renders the Mine inoperable legally until the Forestry Licence is
obtained. Put differently, there is no reason _in law_ why there cannot be
completion without the Forestry Licence. Second, Nava Bharat asserts that
Rajaram was supposed to ensure that the Mine was operational upon
acquisition,[note: 649] but it went ahead with the initial completion with the
knowledge that the Forestry Licence must be obtained _before_ mining could
take place (see [264]–[269] above) and that there was no Forestry Licence.
Third, the Mine was strictly speaking operational, albeit illegally, when
Dicky Tan was in charge. It will become apparent later why this is an
important distinction.

273 Nava Bharat’s position is that Ashwin was unfamiliar with the issue of
Forestry Licence and was therefore “swayed by [Dicky Tan’s] statement that he
had already been producing and exporting coal”.[note: 650] According to Nava
Bharat, ABNR and Bob Sundaram advised that the Forestry Licence was necessary,
but this was disputed by Dicky Tan who insisted that he had been producing and
exporting coal from the Mine.[note: 651] Nava Bharat claims that Rajaram’s
silence and failure to offer specific advice on the risks of completing
without the Forestry Licence, when taken in light of Dicky Tan’s assertion
that he had been producing and exporting coal from the Mine, amounted to “(a)
concealment of the risks, and therefore (b) positive advice that it was safe
to complete without the [Forestry Licence]”.[note: 652] Nava Bharat adds that
Rajaram had aligned himself with Chandra and took the position that the
Forestry Licence was not required.[note: 653] As an alternative, Nava Bharat
claims that Rajaram should have advised Nava Bharat against completion because
of the uncertainty surrounding the issue of Forestry Licence.[note: 654] The
“uncertainty” refers to the inconsistency between ABNR’s advice that the
Forestry Licence was necessary for mining and Dicky Tan’s assertion that he
had been operating the Mine without the Forestry Licence.[note: 655]

274 Rajaram’s response is that Nava Bharat decided to proceed with the
Transaction on the basis of Dicky Tan’s undertaking that he would procure the
Forestry Licence if it was necessary.[note: 656] Nava Bharat challenges the
existence as well as the adequacy of such an undertaking.[note: 657]

275 The differences in the positions taken by Nava Bharat and Rajaram
necessitate an examination of the events that led to Nava Bharat’s decision to
proceed with initial completion despite the advice from ABNR and Bob Sundaram
that the Forestry Licence must be obtained before mining can commence. At the
heart of this inquiry is the question of whether Nava Bharat, having had the
benefit of legal advice, made a commercial decision on the basis of Dicky
Tan’s undertaking to proceed without the Forestry Licence.

276 For the following reasons, I find that Nava Bharat was advised and
therefore knew that the Forestry Licence was required but made a commercial
decision to go ahead without the Forestry Licence on the basis of Dicky Tan’s
undertaking.

(a) Nava Bharat knew Forestry Licence was required under Indonesian law

277 I start from the prelude to the meeting of 19 December 2008 where Dicky
Tan was said to have first agreed to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was
required. As mentioned earlier, ABNR’s email on 26 October 2008 raised the
issue of the Forestry Licence. The email ended with a suggestion that the
issue “may need to be further discussed with the counter-party”,[note: 658]
and this was precisely what Rajaram had planned to do. He sought to arrange
for a meeting with Woody and Chandra,[note: 659] but the meeting was
eventually called off as Dicky Tan wanted to make a “commercial call”.[note:
660] This was because Dicky Tan was of the view that the Forestry Licence was
not required.[note: 661] In other words, Dicky Tan did not dispute that there
was no Forestry Licence, but was saying that it was not necessary to have one
in order to mine.

278 The issue of the Forestry Licence was raised again at the meeting held on
19 December 2008 (see [33] above). At this point in time, Nava Bharat would
have known that the Forestry Licence was required to mine _legally_ and that
Dicky Tan did _not_ have the Forestry Licence. This was further reinforced
when Bob Sundaram reported at the meeting that it was necessary to have a
Forestry Licence in order to operate the mine.[note: 662] In fact, it was
Ashwin who arranged for Bob Sundaram to call in and address the issue of
Forestry Licence.[note: 663] The purpose for doing so must have been to convey
to Dicky Tan what Ashwin believed to be the position, that is, the Forestry
Licence was required under Indonesian law. It would also have been clear to
Nava Bharat that Dicky Tan had previously wanted to call off the Transaction
because of the Forestry Licence (see [277] above). In this regard, I accept
Rajaram’s evidence that Dicky Tan threatened to “walk away from the deal” in
face of Ashwin’s insistence for him to obtain the Forestry Licence.[note: 664]
This led to an impasse, which was eventually resolved on the basis of Dicky
Tan’s undertaking to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was required.

279 On the evidence before me, I find that Ashwin could not have proceeded
with the Transaction under the impression that the Forestry Licence was not
necessary under Indonesian law. He knew that it was. Instead, it must have
crossed Ashwin’s mind that Dicky Tan was operating the Mine notwithstanding
that he did not have the Forestry Licence. The implication must have been that
it was possible to flout the law and operate the Mine without the Forestry
Licence. Nava Bharat contends that there was a conflict between the advice
from ABNR and Bob Sundaram on the one hand and the assertion of Dicky Tan on
the other hand.[note: 665] However, it was apparent from both Nava Bharat’s
submissions and Ashwin’s evidence that Dicky Tan did _not_ actually say that
the Forestry Licence was not required under Indonesian law, but simply that he
had been “producing and exporting coal from the [Mine]” without a Forestry
Licence.[note: 666] I do not think that Ashwin can genuinely claim that he was
confused as to whether Indonesian law required a Forestry Licence for the
operation of the Mine. He knew that it was necessary under Indonesian law from
the advice that he received from ABNR and Bob Sundaram. In any event, even if
Dicky Tan did claim that the Forestry Licence was not required under
Indonesian law, I find it unbelievable that Ashwin would prefer the view
proffered by Dicky Tan over the advice from ABNR and Bob Sundaram. This is so
even if Rajaram aligned with the view of Dicky Tan (on the evidence I do not
find that he did). It is highly unlikely that Ashwin would disregard the
advice of ABNR, Nava Bharat’s Indonesian counsel, and Bob Sundaram, its “focal
point on the ground in Indonesia”, and prefer the view of Dicky Tan, the
counterparty to the Transaction. It is also pertinent that Ashwin knew that
Rajaram was not qualified to advise on Indonesian law. In these circumstances,
I am of the view that Ashwin knew that the Forestry Licence was required under
Indonesian law. He could not have been misled by Dicky Tan to think that the
Forestry Licence was not required under Indonesian law.

280 The fact that Ashwin knew that the Forestry Licence was necessary under
Indonesian law points in favour of the existence of the undertaking by Dicky
Tan. It shows that his decision to proceed with the Transaction without the
Forestry Licence was made in full cognisance of the requirement under
Indonesian law. It further suggests that his decision must have been premised
on some reason other than that he was “swayed by [Dicky Tan’s] statement that
he had already been procuring and exporting coal” in light of Rajaram’s
alleged failure to advise against completion. In my view, it was more likely
than not that he was willing to break the impasse with Dicky Tan by proceeding
with the Transaction based on Dicky Tan’s undertaking that he would obtain the
Forestry Licence if it was required. Given that Ashwin knew, at that point in
time, that the Forestry Licence was required under Indonesian law, it is clear
he made the commercial call to accept Dicky Tan’s undertaking.

(b) Dicky Tan agreed to obtain Forestry Licence if it was required

281 Contrary to Nava Bharat’s contention, the finding that Dicky Tan had
agreed to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was required is well supported by
evidence, including:

(a) the notes taken at the meeting on 19 December 2008 and Chandra’s email
sent shortly thereafter

(b) the emails from Bob Sundaram to Ashwin shortly after the meeting on 19
December 2008;

(c) Bob Sundaram’s evidence on his understanding as to why Nava Bharat
proceeded with the Transaction; and

(d) the correspondence between Rajaram and Chandra shortly after the initial
completion.

282 I begin with the contemporaneous evidence. At the meeting on 19 December
2008, Leela Velayuthan (“Leela”), one of SLP’s staff, and Rajaram each had a
printed copy of a checklist for the outstanding items for completion. On both
copies, there were handwritten annotations. On Leela’s copy, it was stated
“Forestry application (Utaking letter from Dicky)”.[note: 667] On Rajaram’s
copy, it was stated “Forestry application Letter of undertaking”.[note: 668]
In my view, these handwritten annotations suggest that Dicky Tan had agreed to
apply for the Forestry Licence if it was required. In addition, Chandra’s
email on 23 December 2008, four days after the meeting, acknowledged the same,
albeit using different words:[note: 669]

**ASSETS AND LAND RIGHT**

11\. All documents evidencing the arrangement on the utilization of land in
the mining area, e.g. _Use-Lease Agreement with the Department of Forestry_ or
other third party ...

TPC LLC Comments: We are instructed that our clients have been operating the
mine since December 2007 and have been exporting to Thailand without such a
license. _As discussed between the various parties, if the Mining Department
in Banjarmarsin confirms in writing that the KP owned by PT IC requires a
Forestry Licence, this will be effected as a condition subsequent prior to any
further acquisitions by Nava Bharat_.

[emphasis added]

283 I will address the point about the inconsistency in the use of words to
describe the undertaking from Dicky Tan later (see [293] below). Leaving that
aside for the moment, Chandra’s email shows that it was discussed and agreed
that the parties would go ahead with the Transaction despite the differences
over whether the Forestry Licence was required, and if Nava Bharat can show
that the Forestry Licence was required, by way of a written confirmation from
the relevant authority, then Dicky Tan would obtain it. Chandra testified at
the hearing that he could not recall if Dicky Tan had said at the meeting that
he would apply for the Forestry Licence if it was required,[note: 670] but I
did not think it should be held against him given that the meeting occurred
almost five years ago. Notably, Chandra had not, in any way, contradicted what
is written in his email sent on 23 December 2008. I note the contemporaneity
of Chandra’s email dated 23 December 2008, as well as the fact that it was
written long before these actions were brought. I should also add that the
written confirmation from the “Mining Department in Banjarmarsin” was never
obtained because Dicky Tan eventually accepted that the Forestry Licence was
required (see [287] below).[note: 671]

284 After the meeting on 19 December 2008 (see [33] above), Nava Bharat
continued to deal with the issue of Forestry Licence. Bob Sundaram sent an
email to Ashwin immediately after the meeting reiterating his findings on the
Forestry Licence and concluded by stating that he would “try to get as much
information as possible on this forestry issue so that [there is] no conflict
of information”.[note: 672] On the next day, he forwarded Karupiah’s due
diligence report to Ashwin, and in the report, it was stated that there is a
“need to procure approval from Forestry Minister before mining”.[note: 673]
Both confirmed that the Forestry Licence was required. Nava Bharat argues that
there would have been no need for Bob Sundaram to deal with any “conflict of
information” or for Karupiah’s due diligence report, which dealt with the
issue of Forestry Licence, if the issue had been resolved at the meeting on 19
December 2008 by way of Dicky Tan’s undertaking.[note: 674] I do not agree.
Contrary to Nava Bharat’s argument, I find that these acts were necessitated
by the fact that Nava Bharat was trying to confirm its earlier view (and hold
Dicky Tan to his undertaking) that the Forestry Licence was required under
Indonesian law. This view is supported by the correspondence between Ashwin
and Prasad which were sent a few days later. On 23 December 2008, Ashwin sent
an email to Prasad. In his email, Ashwin attached, _inter alia_ , a letter of
recommendation dated 13 December 2006 issued by the “bupati” for PTBHM (one of
the prerequisites for the Forestry Licence application) and asked rhetorically
why did PTBHM apply for the Forestry Licence in 2006 “if it [was] not
required”.[note: 675] Prasad replied on the same day saying that it clearly
shows that the Forestry Licence was required and applied for, and asked Ashwin
to check if PTBHM might have already obtained the Forestry Licence.[note: 676]
The manner in which the email was written indicates that Ashwin did not
actually believe Dicky Tan’s assertion that the Forestry Licence was not
required. As mentioned earlier, this weighs in favour of the existence of an
undertaking from Dicky Tan.

285 Bob Sundaram’s understanding as to why Nava Bharat proceeded with the
Transaction further supports the finding that Dicky Tan had agreed to obtain
the Forestry Licence if it was required. In Bob Sundaram’s AEIC, he said
that:[note: 677]

On or about 22.1.09, Ashwin called to tell me that the documents for the coal
mine transactions were ready and had to be notarised in Indonesia. I was
nominated to sign on behalf of NBS in Indonesia. I understood that the
documents were to be signed _with Dicky Tan giving his undertaking to obtain
the license and complying with all other requirements to ensure that the mine
was operational_. [emphasis added]

286 Nava Bharat asserts that Bob Sundaram had no personal knowledge of the
discussions at the meeting on 19 December 2008 and had simply assumed that
Dicky Tan had given an undertaking.[note: 678] I do not agree that Bob
Sundaram’s evidence in his AEIC was based on his “assumption”. Bob Sundaram
initially testified that he signed the documents on behalf of Nava Bharat with
the “understanding” that there was an arrangement where Dicky Tan would obtain
the Forestry Licence if it was necessary to mine,[note: 679] but later changed
his evidence to say that it was merely his “assumption”.[note: 680] Bob
Sundaram’s explanation was that he assumed that the issue must have been
resolved since he was asked to sign the documents on behalf of Nava
Bharat.[note: 681] The troubling part, however, is that he could not
adequately explain why he assumed that the issue must have been resolved on
the basis of an undertaking from Dicky Tan.[note: 682] Even if Bob Sundaram
knew that the Forestry Licence was required and that it was supposed to be the
responsibility of Dicky Tan as the seller,[note: 683] it still would not lead
him to assume that the issue was resolved on the basis of an “undertaking” by
Dicky Tan. It was equally possible that Dicky Tan managed to obtain the
Forestry Licence in the meantime or had it all along; or that Nava Bharat
decided to secure a discount on the price instead. There is simply
insufficient basis for Bob Sundaram to have assumed that there was an
undertaking by Dicky Tan. The use of the word “undertaking”, which corresponds
with the handwritten annotation by Leela and Rajaram (see [282] above), to
describe what Bob Sundaram understood to be the arrangement is also
indicative. Since Bob Sundaram was not present at the meeting on 19 December
2008 (except _via_ tele-conference to report on the Forestry Licence issue),
it follows that his understanding that the issue was resolved by way of an
undertaking from Dicky Tan must have come from Ashwin.

287 It also appears from the correspondence between Rajaram and Chandra
shortly after the initial completion that Dicky Tan had agreed to obtain the
Forestry Licence if it was required. On 2 February 2009, Rajaram sent an email
to Chandra stating that the application and approval of the Forestry Licence
was something that “your clients and you” had confirmed will be done.[note:
684] He further added that “[_m_]_y clients_ are anxious to commence
operations _soon_ and want a confirmation on _when_ the approval can be
expected”.[note: 685] Chandra responded the next day and confirmed that “it
was agreed” that the procurement of the Forestry Licence “will be treated as a
condition subsequent” and reiterated that Dicky Tan would obtain the Forestry
Licence if it was required.[note: 686] Ashwin was copied in this exchange of
emails,[note: 687] but there was no evidence to suggest that he had objected
to the accuracy of the emails apart from Ashwin’s bald assertions in
court.[note: 688]

288 Nava Bharat contends that there was no undertaking given by Dicky Tan
before the initial completion. Ashwin’s evidence at the hearing was that the
undertaking was only given a few days after initial completion.[note: 689]
This was neither pleaded in the statement of claim nor raised in his
AEIC.[note: 690] Nevertheless, Nava Bharat raises a host of apparent
inconsistencies to support its contention, including:

(a) Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 2 February 2009 which stated that the
Forestry Licence was something that Dicky Tan had “confirmed” will be
done;[note: 691]

(b) Chandra’s email to Rajaram on 3 February 2009 which stated that the
Forestry Licence was a “condition subsequent” and that Dicky Tan would obtain
the Forestry Licence if it was required;[note: 692]

(c) Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 3 February 2009 which stated that Dicky Tan
had “represented that all approvals for mining are in place”;[note: 693]

(d) Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 11 March 2009 which stated that the initial
completion was based on the undertaking from Dicky Tan _and_ a letter
authorising the extraction of 50,000 metric tonnes of coal by end of March
2009;[note: 694]

(e) Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 12 March 2009 which stated that Dicky Tan
acknowledged, before the “Initial Completion Date”, that the Forestry Licence
was a “mandatory requirement”;[note: 695]

(f) The typewritten minutes of the meeting on 16 March 2009 stated that the
condition subsequent regarding the Forestry Licence was agreed between Rajaram
and Chandra by an exchange of emails, and Nava Bharat claims that it refers to
the emails between Rajaram and Chandra on 2 and 3 February 2009 which occurred
_after_ initial completion;[note: 696]

(g) The handwritten minutes of the meeting on 24 March 2009 stated that the
Forestry Licence was a “condition precedent” and Tanakorn would provide it
within two weeks after completion, while the typewritten minutes made no
reference to any undertaking by Dicky Tan.[note: 697]

(h) Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 12 May 2009 which stated that the Variation
Agreement was concluded to facilitate Dicky Tan to obtain the Forestry
Licence, “an issue that was not deliberated and attended to at the Initial
Completion Date”.[note: 698]

(i) The First Notice of Default which stated that there were “express and oral
representations” that all approvals and licences required for the production
of coal from the Mine had been obtained but made no reference to the
undertaking by Dicky Tan.[note: 699]

(j) Rajaram’s email to Chandra dated 3 August 2009 which stated that there
were “express and oral representations” that all approvals and licences
required for the production of coal from the Mine had been obtained but made
no reference to the undertaking by Dicky Tan.[note: 700]

(k) The Second Notice of Default which stated that Dicky Tan had
misrepresented that the Mine was an “operating mine” and that all necessary
approvals to operate the Mine were “in hand” but made no reference to the
undertaking by Dicky Tan.[note: 701]

(l) Rajaram’s email to Bill on 11 February 2010 which, according to Nava
Bharat, should be understood to mean that the absence of the Forestry Licence
was discovered _after_ initial completion and at that point Dicky Tan promised
to secure the Forestry Licence.[note: 702]

(m) Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 9 April 2010 which stated that Dicky Tan
misrepresented that the Mine was operational but made no reference to the
undertaking by Dicky Tan.[note: 703]

(n) The Third Notice of Default which stated that Dicky Tan fraudulently
misrepresented that the Forestry Licence was not required but made no
reference to the undertaking by Dicky Tan.[note: 704]

(o) The executive summary dated 4 November 2010, prepared by Rajaram, which
stated that Dicky Tan misrepresented that it was an operational mine but made
no reference to the undertaking by Dicky Tan.[note: 705]

289 The main thrust of Nava Bharat’s contention appears to be that there was a
conspicuous lack of reference to the undertaking by Dicky Tan in the
correspondence after initial completion.[note: 706] As a secondary point, Nava
Bharat highlights that Rajaram had repeatedly insisted in the correspondence
that Dicky Tan represented that the Mine was operational and/or all requisite
approvals had been obtained and this is inconsistent with his case that that
there was an undertaking from Dicky Tan.[note: 707] I do not think that they
support Nava Bharat’s contention that there was no undertaking by Dicky Tan.

290 As a preliminary point, I should say that, as shown earlier, the evidence
supports the finding that Dicky Tan had agreed at the meeting on 19 December
2008 to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was required. This was evidenced in
writing by Chandra’s email on 23 December 2008 (see [282] above), and repeated
again by Dicky Tan shortly before the Singapore leg of the initial completion
on 28 January 2009 (see [52] above).[note: 708] They are not, contrary to Nava
Bharat’s suggestion, three different undertakings. [note: 709]

291 I go back to addressing Nava Bharat’s contention. The undertaking from
Dicky Tan, as demonstrated earlier, was conditional in the sense that Dicky
Tan would apply for the Forestry Licence only _if_ it was required. The
undertaking was framed in such a manner because Dicky Tan insisted that he had
been mining and exporting coal despite not having the Forestry Licence. Put
simply, Dicky Tan represented that the Forestry Licence was not required for
the mining and exporting of coal (_ie_ , the representation), and if it was
required, then he would obtain it (_ie_ , the conditional undertaking). The
representation and the conditional undertaking are not mutually exclusive. It
follows that the reference to Dicky Tan’s representation (or
misrepresentation) that the Mine was operational and/or all requisite
approvals had been obtained is not inconsistent with the fact that he had
agreed to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was required.

292 Nava Bharat argues that a reasonable solicitor would have pointed out that
there was a breach of the undertaking when issuing a formal notice (_eg_ , the
notice of default) such that the failure to do so indicate that there is no
such undertaking.[note: 710] I do not agree that a breach of the undertaking
must invariably have been, in the words of Nava Bharat, the “first salvo” to
be fired.[note: 711] In fact, I do not think that it would have been
appropriate to allege that there was a breach of the undertaking at all. After
the initial completion, Dicky Tan acknowledged that he was obliged to secure
the Forestry Licence and did not in any way attempt to resile from his
undertaking to obtain the Forestry Licence. The problem was that Dicky Tan had
not been able to secure the Forestry Licence with sufficient expediency. In
these circumstances, I find that the fact that Rajaram had not alleged that
there was a breach of undertaking by Dicky Tan is not, in any way, indicative
that there was no such undertaking.

293 While I appreciate that there have been several ways in which the
undertaking by Dicky Tan had been characterised (see [288(a)], [288(b)] and
[288(g)] above) and variations in the facts surrounding the undertaking (see
[288(d)] above), I do not think that these differences are material for the
present purpose. Pertinently, and Nava Bharat completely misses this point, I
note that, notwithstanding the differences, those correspondence and documents
suggest, in essence, that Dicky Tan had represented that the Forestry Licence
is not required in order to mine and/or that if it was required, he would
obtain it. In other words, they support or are at least consistent with the
finding that Dicky Tan had agreed that he would obtain the Forestry Licence if
it was required. The _ex post facto_ characterisation by Rajaram and Chandra,
whether as a condition subsequent or otherwise, would not change what has
actually transpired. In this regard, Nava Bharat’s contentions are entirely
misplaced.

294 Similarly, Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 12 March 2009 (see [288(e)]
above) does not support Nava Bharat’s claim that there was no undertaking by
Dicky Tan.[note: 712] Indeed, if Dicky Tan had _accepted_ that the Forestry
Licence was a mandatory requirement before the initial completion (and Nava
Bharat _knew_ that it was required under Indonesian law), then it is unlikely
that Nava Bharat would complete without an undertaking from Dicky Tan to
obtain the Forestry Licence.

295 I do not agree with Nava Bharat’s suggestion that there was no undertaking
from Dicky Tan before the initial completion because the typewritten minutes
of the meeting on 16 March 2009 (see [288(f)] above) showed that the
“condition subsequent” was only agreed between Rajaram and Chandra _after_ the
initial completion, by way of the exchange of emails on 2 and 3 February 2009.
While I accept that the “exchange of emails” probably referred to the emails
dated 2 and 3 February 2009, I do not think that it necessarily follows that
there is no undertaking by Dicky Tan at the meeting on 19 December 2008.
Indeed, the emails dated 2 and 3 February 2009 themselves referred to a prior
arrangement in which Dicky Tan would obtain the Forestry Licence if it was
required. These emails, when read together with Chandra’s email on 23 December
2008 as well as Leela and Rajaram’s handwritten annotations (see [282] above),
would show that Dicky Tan had agreed to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was
required prior to the initial completion. It is in this context that the
typewritten minutes of the meeting on 16 March 2009 must be read and
understood.

296 Likewise, I find that Nava Bharat’s reliance on Rajaram’s email to Bill on
11 February 2010 (see [288(l)] above) does not assist its case. Rajaram
informed Bill in his email that Nava Bharat was “surprised, when contrary to
all representations that all approvals/permits are in place, they were
informed by Dicky Tan that they did not have a Forestry Approval and hence
Mining Operations could not be commenced”.[note: 713] Nava Bharat suggests
that this email shows the completion occurred before it was discovered that
there was no Forestry Licence and it was then that Dicky Tan promised to
secure the Forestry Licence.[note: 714] For the reasons stated earlier, this
cannot be right. Nava Bharat and Rajaram knew before the initial completion
that there was no Forestry Licence and that was the cause of the impasse which
the meeting on 19 December 2008 was supposed to resolve. In my view, Rajaram
was simply trying to convey that Dicky Tan had represented that the Forestry
Licence was not required for mining to commence but it turned out to be
untrue.

297 I come finally to Rajaram’s email to Chandra on 12 May 2009 which appears
on its face to be a “smoking gun” that the issue of Forestry Licence was not
addressed at the meeting on 19 December 2008. For accuracy, I should reproduce
the relevant part of the email:

You will recall that the [Variation Agreement] was entered to facilitate your
client to obtain the forestry licence, an issue that was _not deliberated and
attended to at the Initial Completion Date_. [emphasis added]

298 Nava Bharat claims that this shows that the issue of Forestry Licence was
not deliberated and attended to at initial completion.[note: 715] However, I
cannot agree with Nava Bharat’s interpretation. The email cannot be read in
isolation and must be understood in the proper context. In this regard, the
circumstances surrounding the Variation Agreement would be relevant. It is
clear from the facts that I have set out earlier (see [61]–[66] above) that
the Variation Agreement was meant to encapsulate the arrangement reached
between Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan to resolve the delay in obtaining the
Forestry Licence. I also note that the issue of Forestry Licence was clearly
deliberated upon by Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan _before_ the initial completion
– the meeting on 19 December 2008 being an obvious example. Nava Bharat may
disagree as to how the issue was finally resolved, but it cannot deny that the
issue of Forestry Licence was deliberated upon and addressed before the
initial completion. What was _not_ deliberated and addressed was in fact the
_deadline_ for Dicky Tan to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was required.
This was also the issue that the Variation Agreement sought to resolve. In
light of these circumstances, I find Nava Bharat’s interpretation to be
completely untenable. I accept Rajaram’s evidence that what he meant in the
email was that there was no deadline prescribed for Dicky Tan to obtain the
Forestry Licence before initial completion.[note: 716] Nava Bharat claims that
Rajaram’s evidence is contradicted by Chandra’s email dated 23 December 2008
as well as the minutes for the meetings held on 16 and 24 March 2009, but I do
not agree. Chandra’s email does not provide a date on which Dicky Tan was
obliged to obtain the Forestry Licence; it merely states that the Forestry
Licence should be obtained “prior to any further acquisitions”.[note: 717]
Even though the minutes appear to provide that Dicky Tan must obtain the
Forestry Licence within a specific time frame,[note: 718] they do not state
whether it was decided before or after the initial completion date. It follows
that, contrary to Nava Bharat’s contention, Rajaram’s email does not show that
there was no undertaking given by Dicky Tan on 19 December 2008.

299 Accordingly, I find that Dicky Tan represented to Nava Bharat at the
meeting on 19 December 2008 that the Forestry Licence was not required for the
mining and exporting of coal, and if it was required, then he would obtain it.

(c) Commercial decision by Nava Bharat to complete without Forestry Licence

300 My findings on this point can be summarised as follows: Nava Bharat knew
that the Forestry Licence was required to mine _legally_ and that Dicky Tan
did _not_ have the Forestry Licence. At that point in time, Dicky Tan
threatened to call off the Transaction. However, Nava Bharat decided that it
was willing to take the risk and go ahead with the Transaction in light of
Dicky Tan’s claim that it was possible to mine without the Forestry Licence
and that he would undertake to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was
necessary.

301 A client is fully entitled to ignore the advice of his lawyer and enter
into risky deals. The client may well have a bigger appetite for risks and
considers that the deal is worth entering into, but that has nothing to do
with the lawyer. It is ultimately a commercial decision that has to be made by
the client. To impose a duty on the lawyer in these circumstances would be
akin to making him the underwriter for the commercial call of the client. As I
have mentioned earlier (see [249]–[251] above), there is generally no
obligation on the part of a solicitor to advise his client on the commercial
wisdom of a transaction. This, of course, would not apply to a lawyer who goes
beyond the usual scope of work of a lawyer to offer commercial advice, but
that is not the case here (see [253] above).

302 On these facts, I do not think that Rajaram is obliged to advise Nava
Bharat against completion in light of the absence of the Forestry Licence or
the uncertainty surrounding the issue of Forestry Licence. Nava Bharat was
advised by ABNR and Bob Sundaram that the Forestry Licence must be obtained
before mining can commence legally. It nevertheless made a commercial decision
to proceed without the Forestry Licence on the basis of Dicky Tan’s
undertaking. It was an informed decision by Nava Bharat to go ahead with the
Transaction and Nava Bharat must therefore bear the consequences.

(d) Inadequacy of an oral undertaking

303 I move on to consider if Rajaram is in breach of his duty in failing to
advise Nava Bharat that the completion must be on “stringent conditions” in
light of the absence of the Forestry Licence. I have earlier found that Dicky
Tan represented that the Forestry Licence was not required but if it was, then
he would obtain it. I also said that the _ex post facto_ characterisation does
not affect the inquiry as to what has actually transpired. However, I find
that this interchangeable use of terms by Rajaram and Chandra to be a
manifestation of a deeper problem, namely the inadequacy of the oral
undertaking by Dicky Tan.

304 Rajaram contends, in essence, that there is no need to include it in the
contractual documents as (a) the undertaking was evidenced in writing and (b)
Dicky Tan had never denied it.[note: 719] The fact that Dicky Tan had never
denied that he was obliged to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was required
is completely irrelevant to the question of breach. This leaves us with the
question of whether Rajaram ought to have advised Nava Bharat that the
completion can only proceed if the undertaking by Dicky Tan is incorporated
into the contractual documents or otherwise put into writing.

305 In my view, and I have dealt with this earlier (see [300]–[302] above),
Rajaram is not obliged to dictate the commercial terms on which Nava Bharat
should proceed with the Transaction. Nava Bharat is perfectly entitled to
proceed with the Transaction on the basis of the oral undertaking by Dicky Tan
if it, having been duly advised, deems fit. However, Rajaram ought to have
advised Nava Bharat on the legal implications that might follow if it were to
complete on the basis of an _oral_ undertaking by Dicky Tan to obtain the
Forestry Licence if it was required. He failed to do so. Rajaram appeared to
have appreciated that there is a need to get a letter of undertaking from
Dicky Tan. The handwritten annotations of Leela and Rajaram (see [282] above)
would suggest so. However, it was not done. Rajaram referred to Chandra’s
email on 23 December 2008, but as I have found earlier, it was a written
confirmation of Dicky Tan’s oral undertaking on 19 December 2008 and not a
separate written undertaking (see [290] above).

306 Hence, I find that Rajaram was in breach of his duty by failing to advise
Nava Bharat on the legal implications of proceeding with the Transaction based
on Dicky Tan’s _oral_ undertaking to obtain the Forestry Licence if one was
required.

(3) Failure to advise for the loan of US$3m to be held in escrow

307 Nava Bharat’s next contention is that Rajaram failed to advise that the
loan should be paid into an escrow account and to be released only after the
Forestry Licence was obtained.[note: 720]

308 Nava Bharat claims that a reasonably competent solicitor would have
“considered other options to achieve [Nava Bharat’s] objectives with minimum
exposure to risks of loss or damage”, and one of the options would be for the
money to be held in an escrow account pending the Forestry Licence.[note: 721]
Rajaram’s primary response is that there was no basis for him to advise for
the money to be held in escrow as it was not discussed or contemplated by the
parties and to propose such an arrangement would result in Dicky Tan walking
away from the deal and the deal being aborted.[note: 722] Rajaram contends, in
the alternative, that the money, which was a loan to Dicky Tan, could not have
been put in escrow as that would defeat the intent of the loan.[note: 723]

309 In my view, a reasonably competent solicitor in the position of Rajaram
would not necessarily have advised Nava Bharat that the money should be placed
into an escrow account pending the Forestry Licence. The standard of care must
be analysed in light of the nature of the specific risk that has eventuated,
and this requires consideration of the magnitude of the risk, the seriousness
of the harm if the risk eventuates, the cost and practicability of steps to
eliminate or mitigate that risk: _BNJ (suing by her lawful father and
litigation representative, B) v SMRT Trains Ltd and another_ [2014] 2 SLR 7 at
[55]. Here, the risk in question would be the delay in obtaining the Forestry
Licence. The harm that would follow if the risk in question materialises was
not a particularly serious one. It would simply have been the losses flowing
from the delay in obtaining the Forestry Licence for which Nava Bharat had the
means to put an end to (_ie_ , by applying for the Forestry Licence
personally). Nava Bharat contends that if the money was placed in escrow
pending the Forestry Licence, then it might have been saved.[note: 724] I do
not think that this is a fair characterisation of the harm that would follow
if the risk in question materialises.

310 It appears that Nava Bharat had taken into account the occurrence of
subsequent events, such as the loss of the PTIC shares, when determining if
Rajaram ought to have advised for the money to be placed into an escrow
account pending the Forestry Licence. This must be rejected. The issue of
standard of care must be judged in light of the circumstances at the time and
not with the benefit of hindsight: _Tan & Au_ at [64]–[65], citing _Jackson &
Powell_ at para 11-092 and _PlanAssure PAC (formerly known as Patrick Lee PAC)
v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 513 at [54]. Nava Bharat claims that
the argument was not made with the benefit of hindsight as Rajaram had advised
for money to be put into escrow in the course of the Transaction after the
initial completion.[note: 725] However, the fact that Rajaram subsequently
took additional precautions in those instances does not in itself show that he
was negligent in failing to advise for the money to be placed into an escrow
account (see _Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence_ (Christopher Walton, gen ed)
(Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2010) at para 7-49, citing _Philpott v British
Railways Board_ [1968] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 495 at 502). The instances in which
Rajaram recommended payment into the escrow account occurred _after_
completion, and as such, the circumstances were different because Dicky Tan
had, by then, failed to obtain the Forestry Licence in an expeditious fashion.

311 It would also have been impractical, in light of the circumstances, for
Rajaram to advise Nava Bharat to place the money into an escrow account as a
means of reducing the risk of delay in obtaining of the Forestry Licence. The
Transaction was structured as a loan to Dicky Tan. It would have been
unreasonable to expect Rajaram to advise that the money should be held in
escrow despite the fact that it was a loan for which security (in the form of
the share pledges and guarantees) was obtained. More importantly, the
contemporaneous evidence shows that Dicky Tan’s position was that he required
the money to be paid to him upfront upon initial completion. This was recorded
in Rajaram’s email to Woody on 22 January 2009:[note: 726]

[Dicky Tan] needs the money for the expenses incurred in getting the transfer
and to pay for jetty and the road works, the jetty has to be completed within
5 months on pain of LD agreed at USD 33,000 per day f [_sic_] delay. ...

At the hearing, Ashwin accepted that a stakeholding arrangement would not have
been acceptable to Dicky Tan because he needed the money to pay for the
expenses incurred in getting the transfer and to pay for the jetty and road
works.[note: 727] It certainly could not have been reasonable to expect
Rajaram to advise on the use of an escrow account when it runs contrary to the
intentions of the parties to make upfront payment at the initial completion.

312 Accordingly, I find that Rajaram was not in breach in not advising Nava
Bharat that the money should be placed into an escrow account pending the
Forestry Licence.

Alleged breaches relating to the new mining law

(1) Restructuring the Transaction as a loan to Dicky Tan

313 In light of the new mining law, the Transaction had to be restructured.
Nava Bharat claims that it wanted to acquire an equity interest in the Mine
and the new mining law, which would allow it to own shares in PTIC, presented
an excellent opportunity for it to do so.[note: 728] According to Nava Bharat,
Rajaram breached his duty when he acted contrary to ABNR’s advice and
structured the Transaction as a loan to Dicky Tan instead of PTIC.[note: 729]
In addition, Nava Bharat argues that Rajaram had failed to advise Nava Bharat
on the implications of not heeding ABNR’s advice to give the loan to PTIC and
not Dicky Tan.[note: 730]

314 I find that Nava Bharat’s contentions are without merit.

315 The Loan Agreement is governed by Indonesian law,[note: 731] and it
follows that the implications of naming Dicky Tan as the debtor (such as the
possibility of converting the loan into shares in PTIC) is a matter of
Indonesian law. As I have found earlier, Rajaram is not under a duty to advise
on Indonesian law. Hence, Nava Bharat’s contention that Rajaram ought to have
advised it on the implications of not heeding ABNR’s advice on Indonesian law
is untenable. Rajaram was not in the position to doubt the advice of ABNR or
veto the commercial decision of Nava Bharat. The proper questions to ask
should, therefore, be whether ABNR’s advice was conveyed to Nava Bharat and if
so, whether Nava Bharat made the commercial decision to proceed with Dicky Tan
as the debtor in the Loan Agreement in spite of ABNR’s advice.

316 In my view, Nava Bharat was advised by ABNR on the implications of having
Dicky Tan instead of PTIC as the debtor named in the Loan Agreement. In
particular, ABNR commented on 22 January 2009 that “the conversion of loan
into shares under [Article 6 of the Loan Agreement] may only work if the
debtor is PTIC, not [Dicky Tan]”.[note: 732] The email was sent to Ashwin and
copied to Prasad.[note: 733] Nava Bharat was therefore aware of ABNR’s advice
on this issue.

317 With the advice from ABNR, Nava Bharat then made the commercial decision
to proceed with Dicky Tan as the debtor of the loan. Nava Bharat claims that
it was Rajaram who disregarded the advice of ABNR.[note: 734] I do not agree.
In Rajaram’s reply to ABNR before the Indonesian leg of the initial completion
on 22 January 2009, he explained that Dicky Tan was made the debtor because he
needed the money “for the expenses incurred in getting the transfer and to pay
for jetty and the road works”, and concluded by pointing out to ABNR that
“both parties have decided on commercial basis to proceed”.[note: 735]
Pertinently, Ashwin was copied to the email, and there is no evidence to
suggest that he took issue with the contents of Rajaram’s email to ABNR.[note:
736] In view of my assessment of Ashwin, I do not accept that he was one who
would have been led by the nose and simply agree with Rajaram. I find that
Ashwin would most certainly have objected if he thought, at that point in
time, that Rajaram was misrepresenting the position to ABNR. He did not. It is
also pertinent to note that Nava Bharat had averred in its statement of claim
that it was “prepared to take a commercial risk on the implications [of] the
new mining laws”.[note: 737] To my mind, the logical conclusion from the
totality of the circumstances must be that Rajaram was acting in accordance
with the instructions of Ashwin.

318 Nava Bharat further argues that Rajaram’s negligent conduct in this
respect was “manifest on the face of it”, and that he was rushing through the
documentation.[note: 738] I agree that there was a rush to complete. This is
apparent from the record. However, I find that it was Ashwin who wanted to
meet Dicky Tan’s demand to complete on an expedited basis. Dicky Tan had
threatened to walk away if the money was not paid directly to him,[note: 739]
and Nava Bharat was eager to close the deal. On the latter point, I accept
Chandra’s evidence that “both parties were in a haste to sign the
documents”.[note: 740] I also accept Rajaram’s evidence that “Ashwin was also
anxious to complete the deal”.[note: 741] They are not only supported by
contemporaneous documents,[note: 742] but more importantly, consistent with
the evidence of Ashwin. The reason for Nava Bharat’s strong desire for the
Transaction to proceed at a brisk pace stems from the pressure which Ashwin
faced from NBVL. Ashwin testified at the hearing that NBVL was “yelling at
[him] to get coal” because there was a power plant that was coming up which
was “[dependent] on Indonesian coal”.[note: 743] According to Ashwin, NBVL was
“determined to get coal from [the Mine]”, and “eager to get coal for the power
plant”.[note: 744]

319 I pause to note that it was not the first time that Dicky Tan had
threatened to walk away. Dicky Tan had previously threatened to walk away when
the issue of Forestry Licence surfaced (see [33] and [278] above). Nava Bharat
decided to take the risk and proceeded on the basis of Dicky Tan’s undertaking
despite having being advised by ABNR and Bob Sundaram on the requirement under
Indonesian law.

320 Furthermore, contrary to Nava Bharat’s assertion, Rajaram was warning Nava
Bharat against proceeding with such haste. This is most clearly demonstrated
in Rajaram’s email on 16 January 2009, where he informed Chandra that he would
“not be able to meet [Dicky Tan’s] unilateral imposition of timelines” unless
ABNR approves of the proposed structure, and that “setting datelines [_sic_]
when the documentation is far from complete is neither fair nor
practical”.[note: 745] Ashwin conceded under cross-examination that he
received this email and he knew that Rajaram was advising against meeting
Chandra’s timelines.[note: 746] It appears that Ashwin was not really
concerned at that time that the rush to complete would not be in the interest
of Nava Bharat. He observed that there was a “flurry of activities”
immediately before the Indonesian leg of the initial completion,[note: 747]
and Rajaram had cautioned against haste.[note: 748] In fact, the circumstances
would suggest that Ashwin wanted to complete before Dicky Tan could change his
mind and walk away from the deal. It is only with the benefit of hindsight
that Nava Bharat is now blaming Rajaram.

321 Hence, I find that Rajaram was acting on Nava Bharat’s instructions to
complete the deal on the terms (_ie_ , Dicky Tan as debtor) and within the
deadline imposed by Dicky Tan. Rajaram tried to warn against haste, and ABNR
advised on the implications of having Dicky Tan as the debtor. However, it
would appear that Nava Bharat wanted to meet its commercial objectives set out
by NBVL and decided to proceed with the Transaction due to Dicky Tan’s threats
to walk away. It cannot now turn around and blame Rajaram for not having
vetoed what turned out to be an unwise commercial decision.

(2) Failure to provide for an effective mechanism to convert the loan into
shares in PTIC

322 Nava Bharat further alleges that Rajaram had breached his duty in failing
to provide an effective mechanism to allow Nava Bharat to convert the loan
into shares in PTIC.[note: 749] This is closely connected with the issue of
whether the loan should have been given to PTIC or Dicky Tan. As mentioned
earlier, ABNR’s advice was that the conversion of loan into shares in PTIC may
not work if the loan was given to Dicky Tan.

323 I am unable to agree with Nava Bharat. For a start, I note that this
allegation does not appear anywhere in the pleadings. Since it is an
allegation that has not been pleaded, I do not think that it ought to have
been made in submission: _Chow Kwok Ching v Chow Kwok Chi and others and other
suits_ [2008] 4 SLR(R) 577 at [29]. As I have mentioned earlier (see [182]
above), Nava Bharat had previously filed two applications to amend its
statement of claim to include allegations relating to this issue, and it was
rejected on both occasions. Rajaram proceeded on the basis that this
allegation was not in issue, and did not adduce evidence on Indonesian law to
rebut the allegation. Hence, Rajaram would be prejudiced if Nava Bharat was
allowed to submit on the issue despite not having raised it in the pleadings.

324 Moreover, Nava Bharat had not proven that a loan to PTIC could have been
converted into shares in PTIC under Indonesian law. Nava Bharat’s claim in
relation to the alleged failure is premised on the fact that the loan to PTIC
_could_ have been converted into shares in PTIC. However, I have earlier
rejected the evidence of Carl. Even if I had not, I do not think that Carl
had, in his expert report, identified the relevant sources of Indonesian law
which would allow for such a conversion.[note: 750] Accordingly, there is no
evidence to show whether Indonesian law would have allowed for such a
conversion.

325 In any case, I am of the view that Nava Bharat’s contention is misplaced.
The crux of the matter lies with the change in the debtor named in the Loan
Agreement from PTIC to Dicky Tan. Nava Bharat’s contention is premised on
ABNR’s advice that the loan should be given to PTIC because the conversion of
loan into shares “may not work if the debtor is [Dicky Tan]”.[note: 751] I
found earlier that Nava Bharat had made the commercial decision to go ahead
with naming Dicky Tan as the debtor in the Loan Agreement despite the advice
of ABNR. By proceeding with Dicky Tan instead of PTIC named as the debtor in
the Loan Agreement despite ABNR’s advice, Nava Bharat must be taken to have
abandoned the possibility of having a convertible loan issued to PTIC. As
such, I do not see how Nava Bharat can possibly contend that Rajaram had
failed to put in place an effective mechanism to ensure that the loan can be
converted into shares in PTIC.

326 Notwithstanding Nava Bharat’s decision to give the loan to Dicky Tan and
the uncertainty surrounding the new mining law, Rajaram took steps to ensure
that there are contractual terms in, _inter alia_ , the Loan Agreement which
would allow Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan to re-negotiate in the event that the
new mining law permits foreigners to own a direct interest in a company which
holds the KP Concessions for the Mine.[note: 752] This, in my view, would
suffice to meet the standard of care required of him.

327 Nava Bharat claims that the optional conversion clause in the Loan
Agreement is illusory because it can only work with Dicky Tan’s
assistance.[note: 753] No evidence was adduced to support this. Even if this
was true, I find that it was an inevitable result of Nava Bharat’s decision to
give the loan to Dicky Tan instead of PTIC. Moreover, the Loan Agreement was
drafted based on a template provided by ABNR,[note: 754] and the effectiveness
of the optional conversion clause is a matter of Indonesian law on which
Rajaram would have neither duty nor capacity to advise.

328 Nava Bharat further claims that the optional conversion clause in the Loan
Agreement would not prevent Dicky Tan from transferring the shares to other
parties before Nava Bharat could take steps to convert.[note: 755] In my view,
this is a red herring. The risk that Dicky Tan might transfer the shares to
other parties exists even if, as Nava Bharat submits, a clause was included in
the Master Agreement to allow the conversion of the loan into shares in
PTIC.[note: 756] More importantly, the Transaction was structured such that
Nava Bharat would still be entitled to the coal in the Mine for a period of
ten years at a stipulated base quantity and price under the Holding Company
Off-take Agreement even if Dicky Tan chose to transfer the shares in PTIC to
other parties.[note: 757] This would, in essence, achieve Nava Bharat’s
objective of securing the coal in the Mine.

329 Nava Bharat also highlighted the list of alleged problems that was
identified by Carl to have afflicted the optional conversion clause in the
Loan Agreement.[note: 758] However, this is immaterial for the present
inquiry. The Loan Agreement, which is governed by Indonesian law,[note: 759]
was drafted by ABNR. Rajaram has no duty to advise on the validity and
effectiveness of the optional conversion clause which are matters of
Indonesian law. Therefore, even if I accept Carl’s evidence (and I do not), it
would have no impact on the issue of whether Rajaram was in breach.

330 In light of the foregoing, I find that Nava Bharat’s allegation that
Rajaram had failed to provide for an effective mechanism to convert the loan
into shares in PTIC to be without merit. Nava Bharat’s decision to give the
loan to Dicky Tan instead of PTIC essentially destroyed the basis for an
effective mechanism to convert the loan to shares in PTIC (according to ABNR’s
view (see [316] above)). There can be no convertible loan given to PTIC since
Nava Bharat decided to give the loan to Dicky Tan instead. Notwithstanding
that, Rajaram had put in place provisions to give Nava Bharat the opportunity
to re-negotiate for equity participation if the new mining law turned out to
be favourable. Even if the optional conversion clause was, as Nava Bharat
seems to suggest, invalid or ineffective, it would have been a matter of
Indonesian law which was not within the purview of Rajaram. It follows that
there can be no breach on the part of Rajaram.

(3) Failure to advise on the implications of the new mining law on the Mine
Operating Service Agreement

331 Nava Bharat claims that Rajaram failed to advise Nava Bharat on the
possible implications that the new mining law might have on the validity of
the Mine Operating Service Agreement.[note: 760]

332 By way of background, the Mine Operating Service Agreement is an agreement
that was concluded between PTIC (as the holder of the KP Concessions of the
Mine) and NBSC (as the PMA Company chosen by Nava Bharat).[note: 761] It was
first contemplated as part of the initial structure under the Heads of
Agreement (see [22(d)] above). Under the Mine Operating Service Agreement,
NBSC was appointed as the mining operator entitled to extract, transport and
sell the coal from the Mine to any customer.[note: 762]

333 Under the new mining law, there was a possibility that a mining operator
(such as NBSC) could no longer be owned by foreigners.[note: 763] This issue
was identified and raised by ABNR at least three times. ABNR first highlighted
the issue in its email on 22 December 2008 to Rajaram, and copied to
Ashwin.[note: 764] In the email, ABNR stated that:

_New Mining Law_

...

We would also like to raise an issue on the appointment of a mining services
company. In the new mining law, Article 124 (1) stipulates that the holder of
an IUP shall use local/national mining services company. Further Articles
[_sic_] 124(2) regulates that in the event there is no mining services company
as mentioned in paragraph (1), the holder of the IUP may use other mining
services company which is Indonesian legal entity (_berbadan hukum
Indonesia_). _There is no definition or explanation of ‘local/national mining
services company’ under the new mining law._

Based on the above, we are afraid that the authority will interpret
‘local/national mining services company’ as a mining services company 100%
owned by Indonesian; therefore, a PMA company does not fall into this
definition. The holder of IUP may only use a PMA mining services company (as
an Indonesian legal entity) in the event there is no ‘local/national mining
services company’. _We are of the view that this provision and un-clarities_
[_sic_] _in provisions of the new mining law may cause a problem to the
proposed cooperation agreement._

...

Before we move forward with the completion of this transaction under the
existing structure, we believe that it is important for us to analyze further
the impact of the new mining law, conduct research with the relevant
Government offices and discuss with the local Government of Tanah Laut
Regency.

[emphasis added]

334 I pause here to note that ABNR merely highlighted that the uncertainty
with the new mining law _may_ cause problems. Rajaram then conveyed the
message to Ashwin, and stated that he was “particularly concerned with the
observation made on the new Mining laws that appear to question the validity
of even the [Mine Operating Service Agreement]”.[note: 765] In other words,
Nava Bharat knew that the Mine Operating Service Agreement might be adversely
affected by the new mining law.

335 ABNR raised the issue again on 18 January 2009, and pointed out that “the
new mining law creates _uncertainty_ on the validity and enforceability of
[the] Mine Operating [Service] Agreement”.[note: 766] As such, it specifically
stated that its opinion on the validity of the Mine Operating Service
Agreement will be “highly qualified”.[note: 767] Again, Ashwin was privy to
the advice.[note: 768]

336 On 23 January 2009, shortly _after_ the Indonesian leg of the initial
completion, Prasad wrote to ABNR asking for an opinion stating that Nava
Bharat had the “authority to conduct the mine operations, sale and export of
the coal from Indonesia freely”.[note: 769] ABNR then sent an email to Rajaram
stating that “the rights of a mining services company to conduct the mine
operation _may be limited_ by the enactment of the new mining law” [emphasis
added], and referred to its earlier email on 18 January 2009.[note: 770] In
response, Rajaram said that the Mine Operating Service Agreement was left
intact because cl 18, the “severability” clause, would save the other parts of
the agreement even if any part is rendered illegal.[note: 771] ABNR replied
with “[t]hat is my understanding”.[note: 772]

337 Nava Bharat contends that any reasonably competent solicitor in these
circumstances would have assessed the implications of the new mining law
before proceeding further in the Transaction.[note: 773] I understand this to
mean that Rajaram ought to have advised Nava Bharat to “wait and see” in light
of the uncertainty in the new mining law. In this regard, I do not think that
Nava Bharat’s contention has any merit. Nava Bharat’s contention rightly
presumes that the implications of the new mining law on the Mine Operating
Service Agreement can only be made clear with the passing of time. At that
point in time, even ABNR could not say for sure what the impact of the new
mining law might have on the Mine Operating Service Agreement. However, Nava
Bharat could not wait. As I have explained earlier (see [318]–[320] above),
Nava Bharat was eager to proceed with the Transaction. I accept Rajaram’s
evidence (which, I note, is consistent with the circumstances) that the issue
was brought to Ashwin’s attention but he nevertheless decided to “go ahead”
with the initial completion.[note: 774] Nava Bharat was repeatedly advised by
ABNR and was therefore fully aware that there is uncertainty as to the
validity of the Mine Operating Service Agreement by virtue of the new mining
law. In my view, there is no need for Rajaram to state the obvious. Nava
Bharat knew of the risks but chose nevertheless to proceed with the
Transaction.

338 Nava Bharat also took objection to the fact that Rajaram pointed out to
ABNR (and _not_ Nava Bharat) and sought its confirmation on the effects of cl
18 of the Mine Operating Service Agreement (_ie_ , the “severability” clause)
in light of the uncertainty caused by the new mining law. According to Nava
Bharat, Rajaram “acted expressly against the advice of ABNR” and “did not
advice Ashwin when he took the position contrary to ABNR’s advice”.[note: 775]
I do not agree. For a start, I note that Rajaram’s email was sent to ABNR, and
it was clearly _not_ an advice to Nava Bharat. Moreover, it did not contradict
ABNR’s advice which was that the implications of the new mining law were
unclear. Rajaram’s point was to clarify that the implications of the new
mining law would not _necessarily_ nullify the entire Mine Operating Service
Agreement but only the parts that were rendered illegal. This does not detract
from but merely clarifies ABNR’s advice. Rajaram was not saying that the new
mining law would have no effect on the Mine Operating Service Agreement or
that it was safe to proceed. It certainly could not have been what Ashwin
would have understood if he had read the emails in their proper context. At
the end of the day, Nava Bharat made a commercial decision to proceed. Rajaram
was not under a duty to advise Nava Bharat on the commercial wisdom of the
Transaction.

Alleged breach relating to share pledges

339 Nava Bharat contends that Rajaram had failed to safeguard its interest
when he put in place the share pledges which were “afflicted by a litany of
defects upon defects”.[note: 776] According to Nava Bharat, these alleged
defects rendered the share pledges “defective” and “doomed to fail”.[note:
777]

340 I note at the outset that the share pledges and the powers of attorney are
governed by Indonesian law.[note: 778] As such, they fall within the
responsibilities of ABNR and not Rajaram. The share pledges and the powers of
attorney were based on templates prepared by ABNR. ABNR also reviewed and
approved the final drafts before execution. Specifically, it was opined in
ABNR’s Advice on the Loan Agreement that the share pledges constitute “legal,
valid and binding obligations” on the part of Dicky Tan and Ridwan
Halim.[note: 779] Rajaram had no reason to doubt or question ABNR’s advice on
the validity of the share pledges and powers of attorney.

341 One of Nava Bharat’s allegations is that Rajaram failed to have regard to
ABNR’s qualifications in respect of the share pledges and did not advise Nava
Bharat on the qualifications.[note: 780] The specific points identified by
Nava Bharat were: (a) that the powers of attorney to sell the shares in PTIC,
albeit “customary” in Indonesian legal practice, may not be upheld by the
Indonesian courts,[note: 781] and (b) that the share pledges could only be
exercised if there was no objection from other creditors.[note: 782] In my
view, this allegation is unfounded. This is a matter of Indonesian law, and
ABNR’s qualifications on the share pledges and powers of attorney were made
known to Ashwin. This is evident from the contemporaneous documents. ABNR’s
qualifications were raised in its draft and final opinions which were sent
_via_ three emails on 23 and 28 January 2009.[note: 783] Ashwin and Prasad
were copied in all three emails.[note: 784] As I have earlier found at [221],
Ashwin is not the proverbial layperson and would certainly have been able to
read and understand the contents of ABNR’s emails. Even if he could not, I am
convinced that he would have raised his concerns with ABNR through
Rajaram.[note: 785] He did not do so. Indeed, Mr Niru Pillai, counsel for Nava
Bharat, acknowledged, rightly in my view, that Rajaram was not expected to
“take a highlighter and highlight” the ABNR’s opinion for Ashwin.[note: 786]
In my view, Nava Bharat was duly advised and would have known about the
qualifications on the share pledges and powers of attorney.

342 Nava Bharat also raised a series of alleged defects in relation to the
share pledges, including:

(a) The share pledges covered the 20% shares in PTIC held by Ridwan Halim even
though he did not receive any part of the loan.[note: 787]

(b) The share pledges covered both the KP Exploitasi Licence and the KP
Explorasi Licence when Nava Bharat was only entitled to the former and not the
latter.[note: 788]

(c) The share pledges did not specify the exact amount of money that was
guaranteed by them.[note: 789]

343 As the share pledges were governed by Indonesian law, the validity and
enforceability of the share pledges would therefore not be something that
Rajaram was obliged to advise on. This would suffice to deal with all of the
alleged defects with the share pledges. In any case, ABNR gave its stamp of
approval for the share pledges, subject to the qualifications which Nava
Bharat was aware of, and there was no reason for Rajaram to doubt the accuracy
of the advice given by ABNR.

344 One of the difficulties with Nava Bharat’s case is that the allegations of
defects with the share pledges are not supported by evidence on Indonesian
law. This is because I have earlier rejected Carl’s evidence. Moreover, ABNR
appeared to have accepted the share pledges as good under Indonesian law.

345 Nava Bharat also appears to be suggesting that there were issues with the
enforceability of the share pledges because Rajaram (and SLP) started seeking
advice from Indonesian lawyers (_ie_ , Suria and ABNR) when it was time to
exercise the share pledges.[note: 790] Nava Bharat claims that the response of
Suria and ABNR showed that the share pledges were “dead in the water from the
outset” and that they were “illusory” as they did not constitute security for
the loan given to Dicky Tan.[note: 791] I find this statement to be factually
inaccurate and misleading as Nava Bharat did successfully exercise the share
pledges (see [122] above). Moreover, I do not agree with Nava Bharat’s
characterisation of the events that transpired. I have set out the brief facts
preceding the exercise of the share pledges at [118]–[119]. In my view,
Rajaram (and SLP) was not seeking advice on the enforceability of the share
pledges, but on whether the share pledges could be exercised in light of the
circumstances and if so, how to do it. This is clear from Muralli’s email to
Suria, which reads:[note: 792]

As set out in the attached Chronology, a notice of default was sent to PTIC
and DT for not obtaining a forestry licence within the stipulated time (this
being an Event of Default which would result in the termination of the Loan
Agreement). Following from this, we would be grateful if we can have your
views on the following:

1) Can client now exercise its right under the Pledge of Shares Agreement?

2) If so, how would client go about exercising its rights under the same (is
there a need to give any notice etc.)?

3) If client cannot now exercise its rights under the Pledge of Shares
Agreement, what else has to be done to enable client to exercise those rights?

...

These are questions that have to be answered by an Indonesian lawyer, and I do
not see any basis for Nava Bharat to object.

346 Suria informed Muralli that there may be some complications in exercising
the share pledges because of the way in which they were drafted, and asked
Nava Bharat to go back to ABNR for assistance (see [118] above). Muralli did
so, and ABNR said that the exercise of the share pledges unilaterally was
subject to challenge by the pledgors (see [119] above). When Rajaram pointed
out that Nava Bharat was unhappy with ABNR’s present stand, ABNR explained
that Nava Bharat had no reason to be dissatisfied given that it had “very
clearly stated some qualifications on the enforceability of the pledge and
powers of attorney” (see [119] above). Ashwin was privy to the advice from
ABNR (see [341] above) and must be taken to have agreed to proceed
notwithstanding the qualifications.

347 To be complete, I should address Nava Bharat’s contention that Rajaram was
negligent by sending to Chandra the “wrong drafts for the pledge” on 21
January 2009.[note: 793] I find that there is no merit to this contention. Not
all mistakes or oversight would invariably constitute a breach of duty. On the
circumstances of the present case, I do not think that it was an error that no
reasonably competent solicitor in the same circumstances would have made.

348 Accordingly, I find that Rajaram had no duty to ensure that the share
pledges and powers of attorney were valid and effective under Indonesian law.
ABNR gave its advice on the share pledges and powers of attorney, including
the qualifications thereto, and Ashwin was copied in the emails. Ashwin would
have read and understood ABNR’s advice, and there was nothing more for Rajaram
to do. With the benefit of ABNR’s advice, Nava Bharat had decided to proceed
with the Transaction.

Alleged breach relating to exit option

349 Nava Bharat also alleges that Rajaram had failed to advise it to exercise
the exit option throughout the Transaction.[note: 794] Nava Bharat’s case is
that the contemporaneous evidence shows that Rajaram did not advise Ashwin to
exercise the exit option,[note: 795] but instead went ahead to put in place
alternative arrangements which benefited Dicky Tan at the expense of Nava
Bharat.[note: 796] I disagree.

350 Rajaram’s evidence was that he had advised Ashwin that Nava Bharat had the
option to exit, if it wanted to, as early as March 2009 and continuously
thereafter.[note: 797] At the hearing, Ashwin conceded that Rajaram had
reminded him of Nava Bharat’s right to exit the Transaction “numerous
times”.[note: 798]

351 More importantly, contrary to Nava Bharat’s contention, there is clear
documentary evidence to show that Rajaram had advised Nava Bharat of its right
to exit. This advice was documented in at least two emails from Rajaram to
Nava Bharat. The first email was sent on 18 September 2009, around the time
when Dicky Tan failed to meet the deadlines under the Addendum Agreement. In
the email, Rajaram stated:[note: 799]

Dear Ashwin

We had signed the Addendum Agreement (AA) on the 28th of August 2009.

It is an express term of the AA that the AIP will be issued within 3 weeks
form [_sic_] the date of the AA; the AIP will therefore have to be obtained by
the 18th of September 2009.

The mail quite clearly indicates that this cannot be done. _The AA also
provides for the right to demand the return of all monies paid, pursuant to
the various agreements, with an interest rate of 12% per annum till the monies
are repaid. There is a clear default and we are not obliged to continue with
the Agreement._

[emphasis added]

Even though Rajaram went on to explore with Nava Bharat the possibility of
issuing a notice of default to trigger negotiations with Dicky Tan,[note: 800]
it does not detract from the fact that Rajaram had advised Nava Bharat on its
right to exit.

352 The second email was sent on 27 October 2009. Bob Sundaram informed
Rajaram that it would take a few months before the issue of the Forestry
Licence can be resolved. In response, Rajaram wrote that Ashwin “will have to
make the call”.[note: 801] Even though Rajaram also suggested that Nava Bharat
can continue allowing Dicky Tan to “lift” as much coal as possible while
waiting for the Forestry Licence to materialise, I think that the email, read
as a whole in its proper context, would be understood to mean that Ashwin must
decide if he wants to continue with the deal. As such, I accept Rajaram’s
evidence that this was an advice for Nava Bharat to consider if it wishes to
exercise the exit option.[note: 802]

353 Apart from the two emails to ABNR, there are further contemporaneous
evidence which supports the finding that Nava Bharat was fully aware of the
right to exit the deal. A meeting was held on 23 June 2009 between Ashwin,
Rajaram, Chandra and Dicky Tan to discuss the issue of the Forestry
Licence.[note: 803] The minutes of the meeting recorded that Rajaram informed
Chandra and Dicky Tan that if the Forestry Licence was not obtained within a
specific time frame, then Nava Bharat “can exercise the exit options
[_sic_]”.[note: 804] Another meeting was held on 29 June 2009.[note: 805] This
meeting was attended by, _inter alia_ , Ashwin, Rajaram, Chandra and Dicky
Tan.[note: 806] One day after the meeting, Chandra wrote to Rajaram setting
out the issues that were discussed and one of the items was that Nava Bharat
“shall have the right to exercise its exit option” if the Forestry Licence
cannot be obtained within six months.[note: 807] This was forwarded to Ashwin
on the same day.[note: 808]

354 The documentary evidence reveals that Rajaram had, in fact, advised Nava
Bharat of its exit option. Having done so, it was entirely up to Nava Bharat
to decide if it wanted to continue or not. This brings me to the next point,
that is, Nava Bharat’s contention that Rajaram went ahead to put in place
alternative arrangements that favoured Dicky Tan at the expense of Nava
Bharat.[note: 809] Again, I find Nava Bharat’s contention to be unsupported by
evidence. Rather, the evidence shows that Ashwin was the one who wanted to
press ahead and use Dicky Tan’s breaches as bargaining chips to extract more
favourable commercial terms. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that it was
Bhushan and _not_ Rajaram who proposed to use Dicky Tan’s defaults to ask for
“financial concessions” (see [97] above).

355 Ashwin accepted that he found out that mining could not commence without
the Forestry Licence around five days after initial completion but he “ma[d]e
the conscious decision not to exit the deal”.[note: 810] This was around
February 2009.

356 This decision led to the discussions between the relevant parties to try
and resolve the issue of Forestry Licence (see [60]–[65] above). The
discussions culminated in the execution of the Variation Agreement on 26 March
2009 which imposed an obligation on PTIC to secure the Forestry Licence for
the Mine within four months.[note: 811] Ashwin admitted that by entering into
the Variation Agreement, he made a commercial decision to proceed with the
deal rather than to terminate it.[note: 812]

357 At around June 2009, when the four-month deadline was up, Dicky Tan
informed that he needed more money to obtain the Forestry Licence. Nava Bharat
nevertheless decided to proceed. This is evident from the minutes of the
meeting on 4 June 2009, which was not attended by lawyers. The minutes of the
meeting recorded that Ashwin offered to “expedite the process” by suggesting
that Nava Bharat “reimburse the cost of procuring [the] forestry licence
[provided that] Dicky Tan can confirm the licence within 1 month”.[note: 813]
At the hearing, Ashwin explained that it was not advantageous to exit the deal
and so he “took a decision to proceed”.[note: 814] It was, in his words, a
“commercial decision”.[note: 815]

358 By the end of July 2009, Dicky Tan still had not obtained the Forestry
Licence and was in continuing default. Nava Bharat continued to be willing to
provide Dicky Tan with a further extension of time. Rajaram, in his email to
Chandra dated 3 August 2009, granted Dicky Tan an extension of one month to
obtain the Forestry Licence. The email, which was copied to Ashwin,
reads:[note: 816]

In spite of al [_sic_] these defaults and in an effort to try and save the
transaction without the need to litigate, our clients are prepared to give the
requested one month extension ...

359 Despite the one-month extension, Dicky Tan was still unable to obtain the
Forestry Licence. Nava Bharat then made the commercial decision to enter into
the Addendum Agreement dated 28 August 2009, under which Dicky Tan was
provided with a further three-week extension to obtain the Forestry
Licence.[note: 817]

360 Notably, it was Ashwin’s evidence that Nava Bharat was willing to proceed
with the Transaction despite Dicky Tan’s defaults even in February 2010.[note:
818] In fact, Ashwin testified that Nava Bharat was “willing to abide by the
agreements [Nava Bharat] got into” and make payment for the shares even in
October 2010 when the share pledges were exercised.[note: 819]

361 The evidence shows that it was a commercial decision made by Ashwin not to
exit the Transaction despite having been duly advised by Rajaram as to its
right to exit. Nava Bharat claims that the alternative arrangements (such as
the Variation Agreement and Addendum Agreement) were put in place by Rajaram
to benefit Dicky Tan at the expense of Nava Bharat. I cannot agree. Nava
Bharat had repeatedly made the commercial decision to proceed with the
Transaction despite having been advised of its exit option (as well as other
contractual safeguards) because it was satisfied with using Dicky Tan’s
breaches as leverage to extract more favourable commercial terms. This is
apparent from the face of the various agreements (see, for instance, cl 3.3 of
the Variation Agreement (see [66] above) and cll 2.1 and 4 of the Supplemental
Master Agreement (see [84] above)). Moreover, I accept Bob Sundaram’s evidence
that Ashwin had told him that the lack of the Forestry Licence resulted in
“variations to the contracts which he believed to be in [Nava Bharat’s]
favour”.[note: 820] Significantly, even Ashwin accepted under cross-
examination that that Nava Bharat reached a “commercial deal” with Dicky Tan
to lower the price of the Mine due to the delay in obtaining the Forestry
Licence.[note: 821] All these evidence contradict Nava Bharat’s belated
assertion that the alternative arrangements only benefited Dicky Tan.

362 At the end of the day, Dicky Tan repeatedly breached his obligations and
Rajaram pointed out to Nava Bharat that it was entitled to exit the
Transaction. However Nava Bharat chose to continue and used Dicky Tan’s
continuing breaches as leverage to obtain favourable commercial terms. In
these circumstances, I find that Rajaram had met the standard of care that is
required of him. There is no duty on his part to persuade Nava Bharat to exit
the Transaction. Nava Bharat chose to continue with the Transaction despite
knowing that it was entitled to exit, in the process obtaining more favourable
commercial terms from Dicky Tan. It cannot now attempt to pin the blame on
Rajaram.

363 I should briefly address one ancillary point raised by Nava Bharat, which
is that Rajaram had advised Nava Bharat to continue negotiating and “lift” as
much coal as possible even though there was no Forestry Licence. Nava Bharat
claims that this constitutes illegal mining, and Rajaram did not advice on the
implications of such illegality on the enforceability of the agreement in
Singapore.[note: 822] This point has not been pleaded by Nava Bharat and thus,
I need say no further on it except to note that the mining was supposed to be
conducted by Dicky Tan, and not Nava Bharat, on an _ad hoc_ basis while the
parties negotiate on the way to move the matter forward.[note: 823]

Summary on the alleged breaches by Rajaram

364 My findings on the alleged breaches are that Rajaram had not breached his
duty as alleged by Nava Bharat except for one, namely, the failure to advise
Nava Bharat on the legal implications of proceeding with the Transaction based
on Dicky Tan’s _oral_ undertaking to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was
required. Hence, Nava Bharat’s claim must fail insofar as they relate to the
other alleged breaches of Rajaram.

365 I move on to consider the issue of causation.

Causation in contract and in tort

366 I begin by pointing out that Nava Bharat had addressed the issue of
causation in a haphazard manner. In its submissions, Nava Bharat appeared to
have been satisfied dealing only with the issue of causation with respect to
Rajaram’s alleged negligence and breach of fiduciary duty,[note: 824] and have
conspicuously failed to address on the issue of causation in relation to the
alleged breach of contract.

Burden of proof

367 Nava Bharat accepts that it bears the _legal_ burden to prove causation,
but contends that the _evidential_ burden lies with Rajaram since he asserts
that “the loss and damage to [Nava Bharat] would have occurred anyway”.[note:
825] I do not agree with Nava Bharat insofar as it is contending that, as a
starting point, the burden lies with the defendant to prove that the losses
allegedly suffered by the plaintiff would have occurred notwithstanding the
alleged breaches by Rajaram. I find the contention to be unsupported in law.

368 The plaintiff bears the burden of proving causation, and it would not be
entitled to recover damages if, on the balance of probabilities, the loss
would have been suffered even if the defendant had not acted negligently:
_Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“
_Sunny Metal_ ”) at [71]. The Court of Appeal in _Sunny Metal_ at [71]
accepted the view of Christopher Lau JC in _Guan Ming Hardware & Engineering
Pte Ltd v Chong Yeo & Partners_ [1996] 2 SLR(R) 382 at [99] that:

... [The lack of causation] is a direct attack on the plaintiff’s case, for it
indicates that the plaintiff’s case is defective in one of its elements. From
this it must follow that it must be part of the plaintiff's assertions that
there is sufficient causation, and therefore the burden must lie on him.

369 As for the distinction between legal and evidential burden of proof, the
discussion by the Court of Appeal in _Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-
Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v
Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd_ [2011] 2 SLR 63 (“ _Rabobank_ ”) at [30] is
instructive. The evidential burden is a “tactical onus to contradict, weaken
or explain away the evidence that has been led”: _Rabobank_ at [30], citing
_Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East, Ltd_ [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 (“
_Britestone_ ”) at [58]. In other words, the evidential burden only shifts to
the defendant where the plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to support
its case. The illustration in _Britestone_ at [60] makes this very clear:

To contextualise the above principles, at the start of the plaintiff's case,
the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact that the
plaintiff must prove and the evidential burden of adducing some (not
inherently incredible) evidence of the existence of such fact coincide. Upon
adduction of that evidence, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant, as
the case may be, to adduce some evidence in rebuttal. If no evidence in
rebuttal is adduced, the court may conclude from the evidence of the plaintiff
that the legal burden is also discharged and making a finding on the fact
against the defendant. If, on the other hand, evidence in rebuttal is adduced,
the evidential burden shifts back to the plaintiff. If, ultimately, the
evidential burden comes to rest on the defendant, the legal burden of proof of
that relevant fact would have been discharged by the plaintiff. The legal
burden of proof - a permanent and enduring burden - does not shift. A party
who has the legal burden of proof on any issue must discharge it throughout.
...

370 Nava Bharat cites two Singapore cases to support its contention, namely,
_Wai Wing Properties Pte Ltd v Lim, Ganesh & Liu (a firm)_ [1994] 1 SLR(R)
1004 (“ _Wai Wing_ ”) and _Tan Hock Tee v C S Tan and Co_ [1996] 2 SLR(R) 578
(“ _Tan Hock Tee_ ”). It is important to bear in mind that these cases were
High Court decisions that preceded the Court of Appeal decisions in _Rabobank_
and _Britestone_. In any event, I do not think that they stand for the
proposition that, as a starting point, the burden lies with the defendant to
prove that the losses allegedly suffered by the plaintiff would have occurred
in any event. In _Wai Wing_ , Chao J said at [65]–[66] that:

65 The failure to reply to the statutory notice would convey to Lee and his
solicitor the impression that the plaintiffs had no defence to the notice and
that the plaintiffs were just being difficult or unreasonable in refusing to
pay the sum claimed. In those circumstances, I cannot see what other
conclusion any reasonable person or solicitor could have drawn. It was really
inevitable that Lee, on the advice of his solicitor, decided to file the
petition. There was simply no reason for him not to proceed.

66 Liu has suggested in his evidence that even if a reply had been given there
was no guarantee that Lee would not file his petition. In answer to that I
would make these observations. ... Secondly, having been negligent in
discharging his duties as a solicitor, _which negligence I have found caused
Lee to file the petition_ , I think the burden shifts to the defendants to
show that even if there was no failure, Lee would still have proceeded to file
the petition. ...

[emphasis added]

371 In my view, Chao J was not saying anything different from what the Court
of Appeal has said in _Rabobank_ and _Britestone_. He found that the
negligence “caused Lee to file the petition” and the _evidential_ burden
shifts to the defendants to show otherwise. Lai J in _Tan Hock Tee_ does not
purport to take a different stance, but “fully endorse[d]” (at [37]) the
comments of Chao J in _Wai Wing_.

372 Based on the foregoing, I am unable to agree with Nava Bharat that the
evidential burden lies with Rajaram because he asserts that “the loss and
damage to [Nava Bharat] would have occurred anyway”. Nava Bharat must adduce
some evidence to show that the losses suffered were caused by Rajaram’s breach
before the _evidential_ burden shifts over to Rajaram.

373 With this in mind, I proceed to consider whether causation can be
established on the evidence.

Alleged breaches by Rajaram

374 Nava Bharat had not clearly addressed how each of the alleged breaches by
Rajaram caused the losses allegedly suffered by Nava Bharat. Instead, Nava
Bharat dealt with the issue in its submissions under three categories, namely,
Forestry Licence, new mining law and the escrow arrangement. Nava Bharat also
proceeded on the basis that all of the alleged losses were caused by the
alleged breaches of Rajaram. To my mind, the lack of clarity in the manner
which Nava Bharat addressed the issue of causation exposes the weakness of its
case. In addition, Nava Bharat had not addressed the issue of causation in
relation to the alleged failure to advise on the implications of the new
mining law on the Mine Operating Service Agreement as well as the alleged
failure to advise on the right to exercise the exit option.

375 Notwithstanding that, I will address the points that were raised by Nava
Bharat. Even so, I do not think that Nava Bharat can prove that the losses
suffered were caused by the alleged breaches of Rajaram (even if they were
established).

376 Millett LJ in _Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew_ [1998] Ch 1 (“
_Mothew_ ”) at 11C-11E said that:

_Where a client sues his solicitor for having negligently failed to give him
proper advice, he must show what advice should have been given and (on a
balance of probabilities) that if such advice had been given he would not have
entered into the relevant transaction or would not have entered into it on the
terms he did_.

...

Where, however, a client sues his solicitor for having negligently given him
incorrect advice or for having negligently given him incorrect information,
the position appears to be different. _In such a case it is sufficient for the
plaintiff to prove that he relied on the advice or information_ , that is to
say, that he would not have acted as he did if he had not been given such
advice or information. It is not necessary for him to prove that he would not
have acted as he did if he had been given the proper advice or the correct
information.

[emphasis added]

377 The passage was cited with approval by Rajah JC in _Lie Hendri_ at [65]
and Ang J in _Su Ah Tee_ at [118]. I agree. In my view, this is no more than
the “but for” test for causation in fact which is applicable in _both_ tort
and contract (see _Sunny Metal_ at [63]).

(1) Forestry Licence

378 Nava Bharat appears to be contending that it would not have suffered the
losses but for Rajaram’s failure to advise on the implications of not having
the Forestry Licence as well as advise against completion without the Forestry
Licence.[note: 826] In essence, Nava Bharat is suggesting that it would not
have proceeded with the Transaction (or on such terms), and hence, would not
have incurred the alleged losses, if it was duly advised by Rajaram. However,
Nava Bharat has not adduced any evidence to show that it would not have
proceeded with the Transaction if it was duly advised. In fact, the evidence
indicates otherwise. I have earlier found that Nava Bharat was eager to
proceed with the Transaction (see [318]–[320] above). The desire to complete
the Transaction led Nava Bharat to accept Dicky Tan’s oral undertaking despite
knowing that the Forestry Licence was required under Indonesian law (see
[260]–[306] above). The logical inference, in light of the entirety of the
evidence, is that Nava Bharat would have proceeded with the Transaction even
if it had been duly advised by Rajaram. I find, accordingly, that Nava Bharat
had not proven that it would not have proceeded with the Transaction (or on
such terms) but for Rajaram’s alleged failure to advice.

(2) New mining law

379 Nava Bharat also argues that it would not have suffered the losses but for
Rajaram’s failure to give the loan to PTIC and provide for an effective
mechanism to allow for conversion of the loan into shares in PTIC.[note: 827]
However, this argument is premised on the basis that Nava Bharat would have
been able to convert the loan into shares in PTIC. Again, this is not
supported by the evidence. Nava Bharat had not shown that the convertible loan
would have worked under Indonesian law. In addition, even if I accept that
Rajaram had advised Nava Bharat to give the loan to Dicky Tan and not PTIC, I
do not accept that Nava Bharat had acted upon that advice. The circumstances
were such that Nava Bharat could not have been able to conclude the
Transaction if the loan was not given to Dicky Tan. Further, the evidence
shows that Nava Bharat was eager to complete the Transaction. In my view, Nava
Bharat had not shown that it would not have given the loan to Dicky Tan but
for Rajaram’s alleged advice. Accordingly, I find that Nava Bharat had not
proven that the losses that it had allegedly suffered were caused by Rajaram’s
alleged advice for the loan to be given to Dicky Tan instead of PTIC.

380 Notably, Nava Bharat concedes that the “defective pledge did not directly
result in any specific item of loss suffered by [Nava Bharat]”.[note: 828]
Instead, Nava Bharat claims that it was “part of the cumulative breach” which
ultimately caused loss to Nava Bharat.[note: 829] To that end, Nava Bharat
alleges that the sharepledges were “doomed to fail from the beginning” and was
“useless”.[note: 830] Nevertheless, Nava Bharat managed to exercise the share
pledges (see [122] above), and the West Jakarta District Court found that the
pledge of shares agreement were valid and enforceable (see [135] above). In my
view, Nava Bharat’s contention is not only oddly framed but also plainly
misconceived.

(3) Escrow arrangement

381 Nava Bharat further contends that “the loss caused by the failed
[T]ransaction could have been substantially saved” but for Rajaram’s failure
to “[employ] the escrow procedure”.[note: 831] I do not see how this
contention assists Nava Bharat’s case. It is undisputed that the Forestry
Licence was eventually obtained on 19 October 2010. In other words, even if
Nava Bharat was right that Rajaram was in breach of his duty by failing to
advise for the US$3m to be put into an escrow account pending the Forestry
Licence, it would only have delayed but not stopped Nava Bharat from paying
US$3m to Dicky Tan. Moreover, Nava Bharat had not adduced any evidence to show
that if such advice had been given it would not have entered into the
Transaction (or on such terms) as it did. In fact, the evidence before me
suggests that Dicky Tan would not have agreed to any escrow arrangement as the
whole purpose of the Transaction was to put him in funds to pay expenses
related to the transfer and to pay for the jetty and road works (see [311]
above). I therefore find that Nava Bharat had not proven that the losses that
it had allegedly suffered were caused by Rajaram’s alleged failure to advise
for the US$3m to be placed into an escrow account.

Commercial decisions and alleged fraud

382 Having regard to all of the evidence before me, I find that the losses
allegedly suffered by Nava Bharat were caused by the alleged fraud perpetrated
by Dicky Tan and others to deny Nava Bharat of the PTIC shares.

383 As I have earlier mentioned, the evidence supports the view that the
losses allegedly suffered by Nava Bharat were not caused by the alleged
breaches of Rajaram because Nava Bharat would in any event have proceeded with
the Transaction on such terms. In light of the delay in obtaining the Forestry
Licence, Nava Bharat chose to harness the opportunity to press Dicky Tan for
concessions in return for extensions of time. Having done so, and eventually
obtaining the Forestry Licence, Nava Bharat decided to exercise the share
pledges. This allowed Nava Bharat to secure the shares in PTIC and transfer
them to its nominees (see [122] above).

384 Nava Bharat would not have suffered the alleged losses _but for_ the
subsequent acts of Jason Tan and others. These acts can be categorised into
two groups.

385 The first was the series of Deeds in relation to the PTIC shares which
were said to have been fabricated by Jason Tan. The facts are set out above at
[124]–[125], but to summarise, the shares in PTIC secured by Nava Bharat
through the exercise of the share pledges were invalidated by Deed No 8, which
was allegedly fabricated. Pursuant to Deed No 14, the PTIC shares were then
transferred to two of Jason Tan’s children and Sofwan Rahman, and Jason Tan
was made the president director of PTIC.[note: 832] At the hearing, Ashwin
accepted that Deed No 14 was the reason why Nava Bharat could not take control
of PTIC, and believed that it was a “scam” by Jason Tan and Dicky Tan.[note:
833]

386 The second was the series of court actions in Indonesia which essentially
resulted in the reversal of the PTIC shares from Dicky Tan to Sofwan Rahman
and Suhendra. It began with Case No 01/PDT.G/2010/PN.JKT.PST (“Case No 1”),
where Sofwan Rahman and Suhendra, as the previous shareholders of PTIC, sued
Dicky Tan to invalidate his rights in the PTIC shares on the basis that he did
not pay for them.[note: 834] On 23 March 2010, the Central Jakarta District
Court ruled in favour of Sofwan Rahman and Suhendra. Pertinently, ABNR’s due
diligence revealed Dicky Tan as the shareholder of PTIC and did not raise any
issues on the validity of his shareholding.[note: 835] Dicky Tan and Ridwan
Halim then commenced Case No 98/PDT.G/2011 (“Case No 98”) against Nava Bharat
in an attempt to void the Transaction on the basis that he did not understand
the contractual documents which were in English and that he had not paid
Sofwan Rahman and Suhendra as he was awaiting payment from Nava Bharat.[note:
836] They claimed that Nava Bharat had not paid the sum of US$3m and asked for
the Transaction to be declared null and void.[note: 837] It is not in dispute
that Nava Bharat did pay Dicky Tan the sum of US$3m. On 22 March 2012, the
Central Jakarta District Court allowed the claim and declared the Transaction
null and void.[note: 838] Nava Bharat lost on appeal to the High Court, and
has appealed to the Supreme Court.[note: 839] At the time of the hearing, the
Supreme Court had not delivered its judgment.[note: 840] It is important to
note that Bob Sundaram accepted at the hearing that Nava Bharat would still
“be holding the [PTIC] shares” if not for the order of court which he felt was
a “scam” by Jason Tan and Dicky Tan.[note: 841] After that, Jason Tan sued
Dicky Tan in Case No 72/PDT/G/2012 (“Case No 72”) and sought to invalidate
_all_ of the transactions carried out by Dicky Tan under the name Tan Beng
Phiau Dick from 29 November 2000 onwards because his lawful name was Tansri
Bengawan.[note: 842] Dicky Tan did not appear in court, and default judgment
was entered against him on 15 August 2012.[note: 843]

387 None of these acts can be attributed to Rajaram. They did not result from
Rajaram’s alleged breaches. Nava Bharat claims that the Indonesian suits (see
[386] above) might not have been commenced or would not have been resolved the
way that they were _if_ Nava Bharat had the Forestry Licence and was able to
carry out the mining operations.[note: 844] This is nothing but an unjustified
assertion. No evidence was adduced. Nava Bharat says that the “but for” test
must be applied “flexibly and with common sense”.[note: 845] Even so, they are
not magic words that one can utter when evidence to prove causation is
lacking. I find Nava Bharat’s allegations to be clearly without foundation. To
be clear, I do _not_ consider that Rajaram was obliged to identify whether
Dicky Tan and Jason Tan were perpetrating a fraud against Nava Bharat. It was
not Nava Bharat’s pleaded case that Rajaram was required to safeguard against
fraud but failed to do so. Bob Sundaram accepts this.[note: 846] It is
understandable why Nava Bharat chose not to take that position. The law
generally frowns upon imposing liability on a solicitor who has acted with
reasonable care for the losses caused by the fraud of a third party (see _Su
Ah Tee_ at [117] citing _Platform Funding Ltd v Bank of Scotland plc (formerly
Halifax plc)_ [2009] QB 426 at [52]). To overcome the difficulty, Nava Bharat
re-characterised its case against Rajaram essentially as one of failure to
advise it against completing the Transaction or hand over the money to Dicky
Tan for reasons other than fraud, _eg_ , the absence of the Forestry Licence
and the new mining law. However, the action, as it was eventually
characterised, was plagued with other difficulties (which I have discussed
earlier), including the fact that Nava Bharat would have proceeded with the
Transaction on the same terms even if Rajaram had not allegedly breached his
duty.

Summary on causation in contract and in tort

388 On the evidence before me, I find that Nava Bharat had failed to prove
that it would not have proceeded with the Transaction on the same terms if
Rajaram had not allegedly breached his duty. Nava Bharat chose to proceed
because of commercial reasons, and the losses allegedly suffered by Nava
Bharat were caused by the alleged fraud perpetrated by Jason Tan and Dicky
Tan. It follows that Nava Bharat’s claim against Rajaram and SLP in contract
and in tort must fail.

389 I turn to consider Nava Bharat’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty.

Claim against SLP and Rajaram for breach of fiduciary duty

Duty of loyalty

390 Nava Bharat contends that Rajaram, as the lawyer representing Nava Bharat
in the Transaction, owed a duty of “unflinching loyalty” to Nava Bharat.[note:
847] According to Nava Bharat, Rajaram breached his duty by failing to
disclose his relationship with Chandra and the circumstances surrounding his
appointment, and this allowed Rajaram to “show preference to Chandra and his
client [Dicky Tan]”.[note: 848] I understand Nava Bharat to be arguing that
there is some form of conflict for which Rajaram ought to have sought its
consent by disclosing the material facts. To be precise, the alleged conflict
arose out of Rajaram’s relationship with Chandra – they are brothers-in-law
and were former partners in the law firm Raja, Loo and Chandra.[note: 849]
However, I am of the view that Nava Bharat’s claim against Rajaram for breach
of fiduciary duty must fail for the following reasons.

391 To support its claim against Rajaram for breach of fiduciary duty, Nava
Bharat relies mainly on _Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang_ [2007] 3
SLR(R) 477 (“ _Tan Phuay Khiang_ ”), as well as _Hurlingham Estates Ltd v
Wilde & Partners_ [1997] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 525 (“ _Hurlingham Estates_ ”).
However, the cases offer little assistance. _Tan Phuay Khiang_ was a case that
discussed the duty of “unflinching loyalty” of a lawyer in the context of
professional misconduct and the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules
(Cap 161, R1, 2000 Rev Ed). _Hurlingham Estates_ was a case where the
plaintiff was claiming against its former solicitors for breach of contract
and negligence. The plaintiff applied for leave to amend to add a claim based
on conflict of interest, but this was refused by Lightman J.

Two categories of conflict rules

392 Lawyers generally owe fiduciary duties to their clients: _Law Society of
Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James_ [2013] 3 SLR 221 (“ _Wan Hui Hong James_ ”) at
[7]–[8]; _Snell’s Equity_ (John McGhee QC, gen ed) (Thomson Reuters (Legal)
Limited, 32nd Ed, 2010) (“ _Snell’s Equity_ ”) at para 7-004. That, however,
does not take us very far. The questions that remain unanswered include the
obligations that he owes as a fiduciary, the manner in which he has allegedly
failed to discharge those obligations, and the consequences of those alleged
breaches.

393 The starting point would have to be the authoritative statement on the
duty of loyalty of a fiduciary laid down by Millett LJ in _Mothew_ at 18 (and
cited with approval by the Court of Appeal (albeit not in the context of a
solicitor-client relationship) in _Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev
Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal_
[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (“ _Ng Eng Ghee_ ”) at [135]) that:

The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The
principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core
liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not
make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where
his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or
the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal.
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to
indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining
characteristics of the fiduciary. As Dr. Finn pointed out in his classic work
[P D Finn, _Fiduciary Obligations_ (The Law Book Company Limited, 1977) at p
2], he is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it
is because he is subject to them that he is a fiduciary.

...

The nature of the obligation determines the nature of the breach. The various
obligations of a fiduciary merely reflect different aspects of his core duties
of loyalty and fidelity. Breach of fiduciary obligation, therefore, connotes
disloyalty or infidelity. Mere incompetence is not enough. A servant who
loyally does his incompetent best for his master is not unfaithful and is not
guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty.

394 The cases on conflict can be divided into two broad categories, namely,
conflict of duty and interest and conflict of duty and duty (also referred to
as the “double employment rule” (see _Mothew_ at 19)): P D Finn, _Fiduciary
Obligations_ (The Law Book Company Limited, 1977) (“ _Fiduciary Obligations_
”) at pp 199–200 and 252–254; _Snell’s Equity_ at paras 7-018 and 7-036.

395 The rule against conflict of duty and interest is best described by the
oft-cited statement of Lord Herschell in _George Bray v John Rawlinson Ford_
[1896] AC 44 at 51 (which has been cited with approval in _Ng Eng Ghee_ at
[137]) where he said:

… It is an inflexible rule of a Court of Equity that a person in a fiduciary
position ... is not, unless otherwise expressly provided, entitled to make a
profit; he is not allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and
duty conflict. …

396 This begs the question: what constitutes a fiduciary’s “interest”? I do
not think that it is capable of a comprehensive definition (see _Fiduciary
Obligations_ at pp 203-204). Neither do I consider it necessary to do so.
However, the case law as it stands can be broadly categorised into the
following:

(a) cases where a fiduciary, in performance of his duties, obtains financial
benefits for himself beyond his authorised remunerations (also commonly
referred to as “unauthorised remunerations”);

(b) cases where a fiduciary, in the same transaction, acts both in that
capacity on one side and as an undisclosed principal on the other (also
commonly referred to as “self-dealing”); and

(c) cases where a fiduciary, within the scope of his undertaking, takes on his
own account a benefit to the exclusion of his beneficiary (also commonly
referred to as “fair-dealing”).

397 These are not exhaustive categories, but they do provide an indication as
to what would constitute a fiduciary’s “interest” for the purpose of the rule
against conflict of duty and interest (see _Fiduciary Obligations_ at pp
204–205). Prof Finn observed in _Fiduciary Obligations_ at p 203 that:

The sheer variety of transactions to which the conflict rule applies makes it
impossible to give anything like a comprehensive definition of an “interest”
for its purposes. In rudimentary terms it signifies _the presence of some
personal concern of possible significant pecuniary value in a decision taken,
or transaction effected, by a fiduciary_. ... [emphasis added]

398 This not only explains the existing case law, but also coheres with the
_raison d'être_ of the rule (see _Fiduciary Obligations_ at p 200; John
Glover, _Commercial Equity: Fiduciary Relationships_ (Butterworths, 1995) (“
_Commercial Equity_ ”) at para 5.45). Prof Finn’s observation was cited with
approval by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Eng Ghee_ at [147]. More recently, the
Court of Appeal in _N K Rajarh and others v Tan Eng Chuan and others_ [2014] 1
SLR 694 (“ _N K Rajarh_ ”) at [43] also accepted Prof Finn’s views on what
constitutes a fiduciary’s “interest”.

399 The double employment rule covers different ground from the rule against
conflict of duty and interest. It deals with situations where the fiduciary
acts for two principals with potentially conflicting interests or, in other
words, “he puts himself in a position where his duty to one principal _may_
conflict with his duty to the other”: _Mothew_ at 18. Like the rule against
conflict of duty and interest, there is no absolute bar against a fiduciary
acting for more than one client in a transaction. It depends on whether there
is “a real risk of potential conflict of interests or actual conflict between
different clients in a transaction”, and this is because a balance must be
struck between principle and expediency: _Lie Hendri_ at [47].

400 In both cases, the conflicting duty or interest must be properly
identified. In this regard, I find _Pilmer and others v Duke Group Limited (in
liquidation) and others_ (2001) 207 CLR 165 to be instructive. In that case,
the majority of the High Court of Australia held at [83] that:

The conflicting duty or interests must be identified. Conflict is not shown by
simply pointing to the fact that there had been past dealings between the
appellants and interests associated with the Kia Ora directors. The fact that
dealings are completed will ordinarily demonstrate that any interest or duty
associated with those dealings is at an end and no continuing duty or interest
was identified here. Nor is it sufficient to say generally that there was a
hope or expectation of future dealings. That will often be so. Most
professional advisers would hope that the proper performance of the task at
hand will lead the client to retain them again. No real or substantial
possibility of conflict was demonstrated.

401 In my view, the onus of identifying the conflicting duty or interest lies
with the plaintiff. A mere allegation that there is a conflict, without more,
is not sufficient.

No personal interest in the Transaction

402 As I have alluded to earlier, Nava Bharat alleges that there is a conflict
of interest because Chandra, who represented Dicky Tan in the Transaction, is
Rajaram’s brother-in-law as well as former partner in a law firm. At the
hearing, however, Ashwin was unable to identify the conflicting duty or
interest.[note: 850] Ashwin’s objection appears to be one that relates
primarily to the fact that they are brothers-in-law.[note: 851] I find it
difficult to see how the present circumstances would fit into either the rule
against conflict of duty and interest _or_ the double employment rule. This is
not a case where Rajaram is acting for both Nava Bharat _and_ Dicky Tan. I
also do not see how any of the recognised categories of the rule against
conflict of duty and interest (which I have set out at [396] above) can
possibly apply. This leaves us with the question of whether the rule against
conflict of duty and interest should be extended to apply to familial
relationships.

403 In my view, the fact that a family member is involved as a solicitor in a
transaction should not, without more, constitute a fiduciary’s “interest” for
the purpose of the rule against conflict of duty and interest. I find it hard
to accept as a general proposition that a solicitor acting for a client would
necessarily align himself with the interest of his family member who is acting
as the solicitor for the counterparty. Such a view is supported by the
Canadian case of _R v Clarke_ [2012] NSSC 406. In that case, the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court was asked to remove a lawyer, Tyler Hodgson and/or the law firm
from acting as counsel for Colpitts in a criminal matter. Colpitts was
previously involved in the civil matter (arising from the same facts) in which
the lawyer’s father, James Hodgson represented NBFL, the party suing Colpitts.
One of the allegations was that there may be a breach of Tyler Hodgson’s duty
of loyalty to Colpitts because of his father’s representation in the civil
matter (at [71]). The Court rejected the allegation and held at [97]–[98]
that:

97 ... Tyler Hodgson has no interest, personal or financial, in his father’s
client, NBFL, and, specifically, has no interest, personal or financial, in
the outcome of NBFL’s civil litigation in the KHI matter. His interests
[_sic_] in representing Colpitts is a professional interest.

98 The fact that NBFL is the client of Tyler Hodgson’s father does not result
in Tyler Hodgson having a personal interest which is in conflict with the
interests of his client, Colpitts, or which could have a material adverse
effect upon Tyler Hodgson’s representation of Colpitts. Tyler Hodgson is able
to give Colpitts his undivided loyalty. There is no reason to think that his
duty of loyalty to Colpitts would be impaired.

404 Nava Bharat asserts that there is a “parasitic symbiotic relationship”
between Rajaram and Chandra because of Rajaram’s alleged incompetence.[note:
852] It further claims that Rajaram was beholden to and influenced by Chandra
throughout the Transaction, and thus acted in such a way that subordinated
Nava Bharat’s interests.[note: 853] Notwithstanding that, Ashwin accepted at
the hearing that brothers-in-law do _not_ always agree with each other.[note:
854] I understand Nava Bharat to be saying that Rajaram is influenced by
Chandra because of the familial relationship _and_ Rajaram’s incompetence. I
disagree.

405 As mentioned earlier, I do not think that there can be a conflict of duty
and interest arising out of the fact that Chandra is the brother-in-law of
Rajaram. Rajaram’s relationship with Chandra, in itself, does not give rise to
a personal “interest” in the Transaction which would conflict with his duty to
Nava Bharat. It does not follow from the fact that Chandra was Rajaram’s
brother-in-law that Rajaram was influenced by Chandra. Neither does the
evidence supports such an allegation. On the contrary, I noticed that there
were various instances where Rajaram spoke up against Chandra on behalf of
Nava Bharat (see, _eg_ , [40]–[41] and [45] above). To illustrate the point, I
only need to raise two examples. On 16 January 2009, Rajaram made it clear in
his email to Chandra that even though Dicky Tan was pushing for completion, he
was unable to comply with Dicky Tan’s “unilateral imposition of timelines”
unless ABNR ensured that Nava Bharat’s interests in the Transaction was
protected by approving the proposed structure.[note: 855] At the hearing,
Ashwin conceded under cross-examination that the email showed that Rajaram did
not blindly comply with Chandra’s requests.[note: 856] Similarly, on 21
January 2009, Rajaram informed Chandra that, regardless of Dicky Tan’s
timelines for initial completion, he would not advise Nava Bharat to proceed
with the Transaction until ABNR’s legal opinion was issued.

406 In addition, the question of competence (or lack thereof) is separate from
whether a fiduciary has acted in accordance with its duty of loyalty (see
_Snell’s Equity_ at para 7-009), and in any case, Nava Bharat has not proven
that Rajaram was influenced by Chandra due to his alleged incompetence. In any
event, Nava Bharat’s allegations cannot stand in light of my findings above
(in relation to the claims in contract and tort).

407 Moreover, and this has not been addressed earlier, I find Nava Bharat’s
allegation that Chandra had exercised influence over the appointment of
Rajaram to be baseless. The background facts are set out above at [16]–[18],
and I will not repeat them here. Chandra’s evidence was that he had
recommended Rajaram after having been asked by Bhushan (who was acting on
behalf of Nava Bharat) to recommend another Singapore law firm for the purpose
of obtaining a competing bid against Baker & McKenzie.[note: 857] The fact
that SLP’s fees turned out to be higher than the quoted fees of Baker &
McKenzie does not mean that Bhushan could not have asked for a competing bid.
Even though Chandra had recommended Rajaram, Nava Bharat was free to choose
its own lawyers. This is clear from Ashwin’s email to Chandra dated 7 October
2008, which reads:[note: 858]

_We are still in the process of deciding our law firm_. We will have a
confirmation by tomorrow afternoon, and will be accompanied by the respective
law firm during our meeting. ... [emphasis added]

408 Nava Bharat also alleges that Chandra had “substantive discussions” with
Rajaram before the first meeting on 3 October 2008, and that it is reasonable
to infer that the discussions related to the substantive issues surrounding
the Transaction and his role as Nava Bharat’s counsel.[note: 859] Nava Bharat
goes further to allege that Chandra and Rajaram must have been working on a
strategy to undermine the appointment of Baker & McKenzie.[note: 860] However,
all these are mere speculations as Nava Bharat has not produced _any_ evidence
to support them.

409 Accordingly, Nava Bharat had not shown, on the evidence, that Rajaram was
influenced by Chandra because of the familial relationship or Rajaram’s
alleged incompetence such as to give rise to a situation of conflict.

Duty to disclose

410 Since there is no actual or potential conflict, there is no need for
Rajaram to disclose his relationship with Chandra to Nava Bharat. The informed
consent of the principal(s), which necessitates full disclosure by the
fiduciary, is a “mechanism by which the fiduciary can avoid liability” if he
wishes to act in a conflict situation: _Snell’s Equity_ at paras 7-019 and
7-038. It follows that the obligation to obtain the informed consent of the
principal(s) only arises when there is actual or potential conflict. While the
Court of Appeal in _N K Rajarh_ at [43] said that there is a “duty of
disclosure and openness”, this must be read in the proper context. In
particular, the Court of Appeal reiterated its views in _Ng Eng Ghee_ at [147]
that “[a] fiduciary must disclose a personal interest as soon as a _possible
conflict arises_ , or as soon after as practicable” [emphasis added].
Furthermore, the learned author in _Commercial Equity_ argues persuasively
against a “duty to disclose” at para 5.50–5.51 that:

Disclosure serves as an exception to the conflicts rule ... Sufficient
disclosure may enable the fiduciary to ‘shake off the character’ of fiduciary
office and deal with the beneficiary on a plane of equality. But can it be
said that there is ever a fiduciary ‘duty to disclose’? There is much dicta in
the authorities to suggest that there is such a duty. ...

The ‘duty of disclosure’ idea seems to be gathering strength. ...

Writers on this subject, however, mostly do not share this view. Paul Finn and
Len Sealy are two who are of the opinion that there is no disclosure duty.
This seems to be the academically orthodox position.

It is submitted here, too, that there is no duty to disclose. Such a duty
would be inconsistent with the general fiduciaries jurisdiction of equity ...
Equity forbids things rather than commands them. What may be happening in some
authorities is that the conflicts rule is conceived as a double negative. That
is, the conflicts rule is treated as a rule to avoid breach of a rule which
requires that there be no conflicts. To the extent that the disclosure
exception avoids breach of the rule, there is said to be a duty to disclose. A
duty to attract the exception to the rule is implied. This is given the same
form as the duty to obey the rule itself: not to allow conflicts of interest
and duty to occur. This can be seen in _Moore v Regents of the University of
California_. It was said there that:

The duty of disclosure ... is a fiduciary duty intended to prevent personal
interests from affecting the physician’s judgment.

Certainly the virtue of free judgment is a strong rationalisation of the
conflicts rule. But it does not directly bear on the disclosure exemption.
Disclosure has more to do with honesty than freeing the discloser’s judgment.

411 I agree, and I do not think the Court of Appeal is on a different page in
_Ng Eng Ghee_ and _N K Rajarh_. It is noteworthy that the Court of Appeal in
both cases cited Prof Finn’s views in _Fiduciary Obligations_ on the conflict
rules with approval (see _Ng Eng Ghee_ at [146]–[147]; _N K Rajarh_ at [43]),
and that Prof Finn had, in _Fiduciary Obligations_ (at pp 227–228 and 242) and
elsewhere (see _Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts_ (T G Youdan ed) (Toronto:
Carswell, 1989) at pp 28–29), taken the position that the obligation to
disclose is not a stand-alone duty. In my view, there can be no obligation to
disclose unless the fiduciary has a personal interest or duty that may
potentially conflict with the duty owed to the principal. Since Nava Bharat
cannot show that there is an actual or potential conflict, there can be no
obligation on the part of Rajaram to disclose his relationship with Chandra to
Nava Bharat.

412 In any case, there is some evidence that Nava Bharat was aware of the
relationship between Chandra and Rajaram. Bhushan had, as early as 1999, been
made aware of the relationship between Chandra and Rajaram[note: 861] and
Bhushan and Lakshman knew that Rajaram was Chandra’s brother-in-law because
Chandra mentioned it to them over dinner.[note: 862] As directors of Agora
(see [9] above), it would not have been unusual for Chandra to have dinner
together with Bhushan and Lakshman. In addition, Ashwin had been informed
casually, at least twice, by Rajaram in 2009 about his relationship with
Chandra.[note: 863]

413 Having addressed the claims against SLP and Rajaram, I now proceed to
consider the claims brought against Chandra, starting with the claim for
unlawful means conspiracy.

Claim against Chandra for unlawful means conspiracy

414 Nava Bharat’s first claim against Chandra is in conspiracy by unlawful
means. It alleges that there is a combination between Chandra, Jason Tan and
Dicky Tan to defraud Nava Bharat by selling it a “legally non-operational
mine” which caused Nava Bharat to pay US$3m for which they received nothing,
as well as other losses.[note: 864] According to Nava Bharat, the
circumstances of this case are peculiar because it involves “a continuing
series of agreements” in the conduct of the Transaction to commit acts to
cause loss to Nava Bharat.[note: 865] The sole objective, however, was to get
money from Nava Bharat.[note: 866] It relies essentially on the following
points to prove its claim in unlawful means conspiracy against Chandra:

(a) Chandra engineered the appointment of Rajaram as Nava Bharat’s solicitor
so that Chandra can use Rajaram as a “tool” to defraud Nava Bharat.[note: 867]

(b) Dicky Tan and Jason Tan were dealing with other parties in relation to the
same interest in the Mine (_ie_ , the Lanna Transaction and the Belfield
Loan), and Chandra was aware and actively involved in them.[note: 868]

(c) Chandra worked with Dicky Tan and Jason Tan to sell the Mine to Nava
Bharat by representing that it was legally operational when he knew that it
was not because there was no Forestry Licence.[note: 869]

(d) Chandra worked with Dicky Tan and Jason Tan to drive the Transaction
towards completion to obtain the substantial upfront payment, even though the
Forestry Licence was outstanding.[note: 870]

(e) Chandra fabricated the existence of the undertaking by Dicky Tan to obtain
the Forestry Licence if it was required, in order to perpetrate the fraud and
“mask the conspiracy”.[note: 871]

(f) Chandra falsely represented to Nava Bharat that efforts were being made to
procure the Forestry Licence so as to string Nava Bharat along and extract
more money from it.[note: 872]

(g) Chandra requested Nava Bharat to exercise its exit option under the Master
Agreement as a “false front to hide the conspiracy”.[note: 873]

(h) Chandra knew of Jason Tan’s plan to reverse the ownership of the shares in
PTIC.[note: 874]

(i) Chandra structured the loan to be given to Dicky Tan instead of PTIC as
part of the conspiracy to obtain payment from Nava Bharat.[note: 875]

415 Nava Bharat concedes that there is no direct evidence of the conspiracy,
but claims that conspiracy can be inferred from the objective facts (citing
_Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore
Branch)_ [2006] 1 SLR(R) 901).

416 In response, Chandra contends that Nava Bharat’s claim must fail for two
broad reasons, namely:[note: 876]

(a) first, there was no “agreement” between Chandra and Dicky Tan or Jason Tan
to defraud Nava Bharat; and

(b) second, even if there was a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat, the chain
of causation was broken by Nava Bharat’s own subsequent actions.

417 For the reasons that follow, I find that Nava Bharat’s claim in unlawful
means conspiracy must fail.

Conspiracy to defraud

Law on unlawful means conspiracy

418 The legal elements necessary for the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means
were clearly outlined by the Court of Appeal in _EFT Holdings, Inc and another
v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another_ [2014] 1 SLR 860 (“ _EFT
Holdings (CA)_ ”) at [112]:

... To succeed in a claim for conspiracy by unlawful means of conspiracy, the
appellants must show that:

(a) there was a combination of two or more persons to do certain acts;

(b) the alleged conspirators had the intention to cause damage or injury to
the plaintiff by those acts;

(c) the acts were unlawful;

(d) the acts were performed in furtherance of the agreement; and

(e) the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy ...

(1) Combination

419 On the first element (_ie_ , a combination of two or more persons to do
certain acts), the Court of Appeal in _Seagate Technology Pte Ltd and another
v Goh Han Kim_ [1994] 3 SLR(R) 836 (“ _Seagate (CA)_ ”) at [15] said that the
“essence of conspiracy is an agreement”. The question is whether there is in
existence an agreement or at least some arrangement between the alleged
conspirators to defraud the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal in _EFT Holdings
(CA)_ accepted at [113] that the parties must be “sufficiently aware of the
surrounding circumstances _and_ share the object for it properly to be said
that they were acting in concert at the time of the acts complained of”
[emphasis added]. In other words, the alleged conspirator must not only have
the requisite knowledge but also share the common objective.

420 In _EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd
and others_ [2013] 1 SLR 1254 (“ _EFT Holdings (HC)_ ”) at [125], Ang J
observed “for the sake of argument” that a person who _knew_ that unlawful
acts were being committed but did nothing to stop those acts was not _ipso
facto_ a party to a conspiracy to carry out those acts. The Court of Appeal in
_EFT Holdings (CA)_ did not expressly consider Ang J’s observation, but found
at [114] that there was no agreement or combination because there was an
“absence of a common understanding of the material facts being shared by all
the alleged conspirators”. In my view, Ang J’s observation in _EFT Holdings
(HC)_ is consistent with the general rule laid down in _EFT Holdings (CA)_.
Put simply, the mere knowledge of the commission of an unlawful act, without
more, is not sufficient to find that there is an agreement or combination.
However, the court may infer from the circumstances that a defendant with such
knowledge had agreed to participate in the conspiracy.

(2) Unlawful acts

421 As for the “unlawful acts” in question, Nava Bharat is relying on fraud or
the tort of deceit. The essential elements of the tort of deceit were set out
in _Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders_ [1941] 2 All
ER 205, and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Panatron Pte Ltd and another v
Lee Cheow Lee and another_ [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 (“ _Panatron_ ”) at [14]. The
elements are as follows:

(a) first, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct;

(b) second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should
be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the
plaintiff;

(c) third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the false
statement;

(d) fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing;
and

(e) fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it
must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief
that it is true.

422 The Court of Appeal in _Panatron_ at [13] accepted _William Derry, J C
Wakefield, M M Moore, J Pethick and S J Wilde v Sir Henry William Peek,
Baronet_ (1889) 14 App Cas 337 (more commonly cited as _Derry v Peek_) where
it was held that the plaintiff “must prove actual fraud” and that fraud is
proven only when it is shown that (a) a false representation has been made
knowingly, or (b) without belief in its truth, or (c) recklessly, without
caring whether it be true or false. In _Trans-World (Aluminium) Ltd v
Cornelder China (Singapore)_ [2003] 3 SLR(R) 501 at [84]–[85], Ang J held that
the question was whether the party making the representation genuinely and
honestly believed it to be true, even if such a belief was legally wrong.

(3) Standard of proof

423 The standard of proof that a party has to meet in order to succeed on a
claim for fraud is the civil standard of proof on a balance of probabilities.
The courts have nevertheless been more willing to scrutinise the evidence in
such cases. In _Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict
and others_ [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263, the Court of Appeal was faced with the
question of the standard of proof required in civil fraud cases. It reiterated
that the standard of proof in such cases is that based on a balance of
probabilities but added that “the more serious the allegation, the more the
party, on whose shoulders the burden of proof falls, may have to do if he
hopes to establish his case” (at [14]). Shortly thereafter, in _Chua Kwee Chen
and others (as Westlake Eating House) and another v Koh Choon Chin_ [2006] 3
SLR(R) 469 at [39], Andrew Phang Boon Leong J, after having carefully reviewed
the authorities, said that:

In summary, the standard of proof in civil proceedings where fraud and/or
dishonesty is alleged is the civil standard of proof on a balance of
probabilities. However, where such an allegation is made (as in the present
proceedings),  _more_ evidence is required than would be the situation in an
ordinary civil case. Such an inquiry lies, therefore and in the final
analysis, in the sphere of practical application (rather than theoretical
speculation). In this regard, a distinction ought not, in my view, to be drawn
between civil fraud and criminal fraud. [emphasis in original]

424 The same applies to a claim in conspiracy to defraud. In _Interschiff
Schiffahrtsagentur GmbH v Southern Star Shipping & Trading Pte Ltd_
[1981–1982] SLR(R) 601 (“ _Interschiff_ ”) at [32], Lai Kew Chai J said that:

... in view of the high degree of proof required to make good any allegation
of fraud as stated by  _Phipson on Evidence_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 1976)
in para 123, the owners of the vessel would not, on the facts disclosed in
this case, be able to prove any conspiracy to defraud or any fraudulent
misrepresentation against the plaintiffs.

425 _Interschiff_ was cited with approval by the High Court in _Seagate
Technology (S) Pte Ltd and another v Heng Eng Li and another_ [1994] 1 SLR(R)
1 at [54], and endorsed on appeal in _Seagate (CA)_ at [15].

Application to the facts

426 As I have alluded to earlier (see [414] above), Nava Bharat relies on a
number of points to support its case against Chandra in unlawful means
conspiracy. I do not agree that the evidence would support an inference that
there was an agreement between Chandra, Dicky Tan and Jason Tan to defraud
Nava Bharat. I set out my reasons below.

(1) Appointment of Rajaram

427 One of Nava Bharat’s allegations is that Chandra had engineered the
appointment of Rajaram as Nava Bharat’s solicitor so that Chandra can use
Rajaram as a “tool” to defraud Nava Bharat. This consists of two parts. The
first is that Chandra engineered the appointment of Rajaram, and the second is
that Chandra influenced Rajaram in the course of the Transaction to further
the conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. I find that the facts do not support
Nava Bharat’s allegation.

428 I have earlier found at [407] that Chandra had not exercised any influence
over the appointment of Rajaram. In light of Ashwin’s email to Chandra on 7
October 2008 (see [407] above), I find it hard to accept Nava Bharat’s
allegation that Chandra had engineered the appointment of Rajaram. To my mind,
the evidence shows that Ashwin exercised his own judgment over the appointment
of solicitors.

429 It is equally baseless to assert that Chandra had exerted influence over
Rajaram in order to manipulate Nava Bharat’s decisions in the Transaction.
Nava Bharat relies on two examples to show that Chandra had actual influence
over Rajaram in the course of the Transaction.[note: 877] The first was the
change of the loan of US$3m from PTIC to Dicky Tan. The second was the
completion of the Transaction without the Forestry Licence. I have earlier
found that these decisions were made by Nava Bharat having received legal
advice from ABNR. As such, I do not see any merit in the assertion. Moreover,
as I have explained earlier at [405], I am unpersuaded by Nava Bharat’s
suggestion that the relationship between Chandra and Rajaram _per se_ allowed
Rajaram to be influenced by Chandra.[note: 878] I do not see how it
necessarily follows. In any case, the relationship cannot be looked at in
isolation and must be considered in light of their respective age and
experience. As Chandra explained at the hearing, Rajaram was a “senior lawyer”
of 30 years practice and was older than Chandra.[note: 879] I should state
that from the demeanour of each of them on the witness stand, I find that
Rajaram is the more dominant personality. These factors militate against a
finding that Rajaram would have been easily influenced by Chandra. In
addition, I have explained earlier at [405] that Nava Bharat’s allegation is
also inconsistent with the documentary evidence. I should add that it would be
artificial to expect transactional lawyers on opposing sides to have an
antagonistic relationship since they are, after all, working towards a common
goal (in the sense that their clients would no doubt have some degree of
overlapping interests in the completion of the transaction).

(2) Lanna Transaction and Belfield Loan

430 Nava Bharat also alleges that Chandra was aware that Dicky Tan and Jason
Tan were dealing with other parties in relation to the same interest in the
Mine (_ie_ , the Lanna Transaction and the Belfield Loan) and was involved in
those transactions.[note: 880] In my view, the evidence does not support this
allegation.

(a) Lanna Transaction

431 Nava Bharat claims that the structure envisaged under the Lanna
Transaction was such that Lanna Resources would give a loan to Dicky Tan to be
repaid with coal and underlying it was the right given to Lanna Resources to
operate the mine through its Indonesian subsidiary.[note: 881] It says that
Dicky Tan received the US$2m and simply “took the money and ran”.[note: 882]
Nava Bharat asserts that Chandra and Dicky Tan knew that the Lanna Transaction
“had not been resolved” when they approached Nava Bharat.[note: 883]

432 The facts surrounding the Lanna Transaction have been set out above at
[126]–[130]. Prior to the Lanna Transaction, around 2007, Dicky Tan was
already selling coal to Lanna Resources _via_ Saraburi (one of Dicky Tan’s
companies) under two coal supply agreements in 2007 (the “2007 Coal
Arrangements”).[note: 884] Chandra was not involved in this.[note: 885] The
2007 Coal Arrangements did not require Saraburi to supply Lanna Resources with
coal specifically from the Mine; it would suffice as long as the coal meets
the agreed specifications and originates from “South Kalimantan,
Indonesia”.[note: 886] Later, Dicky Tan wanted to upgrade the coal mining
infrastructure and needed funds to do so.[note: 887] Lanna Resources was
willing to fund Dicky Tan in exchange for supply of additional coal.[note:
888] This eventually manifested in the form of two coal supply agreements (the
“2008 Coal Arrangements”). At the same time, a memorandum of agreement (“MOA”)
was concluded between Saraburi, PT Saraburi Batu Hitam (“SBH”) (another of
Dicky Tan’s companies) and Lanna Resources on 25 April 2008.[note: 889] The
principal terms of the MOA were as follows:[note: 890]

(a) In return for Saraburi’s sale of coal to Lanna Resources under the 2008
Coal Arrangements, Lanna Resources would provide a loan of US$4m to Saraburi
payable in two tranches of US$2m each;

(b) The first tranche was payable on 5 May 2008.

(c) The second tranche was payable within 30 days from 5 May 2008, and subject
to satisfactory performance by Saraburi of its obligations under the 2008 Coal
Arrangements, which included providing a plan, programme and budget (“PP&B”)
the purpose of which is to describe and set out how the loans would be
utilised in respect of the infrastructure upgrading at the Mine.

433 The loan by Lanna Resources was documented by the loan agreement dated 29
May 2008,[note: 891] and the forms of security provided for the Lanna Loan
included personal guarantees from Dicky Tan and Tanakorn, the share charges
over the shares in Saraburi and SBH, and a deed of assignment (“Deed of
Assignment”) which assigned to Lanna Resources all of Dicky Tan’s present and
future rights, title and interest in and to the agreement between Dicky Tan
and PTBHM under which PTBHM agreed to sell the KP Concessions to Dicky Tan
(“PTBHM Sale and Purchase Agreement”).[note: 892] I should clarify that the KP
Concessions were _not_ transferred to Dicky Tan.[note: 893] The KP Concessions
were later transferred to PTIC in the course of the Transaction (see [31]
above).

434 Under the Lanna Transaction, Lanna Resources’s interest was only in the
coal (as opposed to an economic participatory interest in the Mine and/or its
KP Concessions) to be supplied under the 2008 Coal Arrangements. Further, the
security for the loan by Lanna Resources did not provide it with an economic
participatory interest in the Mine and/or its KP Concessions. The Deed of
Assignment purported to assign Dicky Tan’s interest in the PTBHM Sale and
Purchase Agreement to Lanna Resources. However, the Deed of Assignment was
concluded between Lanna Resources and SBH (as opposed to Dicky Tan). In other
words, the Deed of Assignment could not have assigned Dicky Tan’s interests to
Lanna Resources. I should add that Lanna Resources appears to be, at the
material time, represented by its own solicitors in the Lanna
Transaction.[note: 894] Contrary to Nava Bharat’s assertion, I find that the
Lanna Transaction was not similar to the Transaction between Nava Bharat and
Dicky Tan. The Lanna Transaction does not provide that Lanna Resources was
entitled to share the profits generated from the sale of the coal in the Mine.
The right of Lanna Resources to manage the mining operations under the MOA
only extended to the coal that Saraburi had undertaken to sell to Lanna
Resources (at a pre-determined quantity and price).[note: 895] Indeed, it is
telling that Lanna Resources had taken the position in subsequent litigation
and arbitration arising out of the dispute between them that Dicky Tan had
committed a breach of contract for the supply of coal.[note: 896]

435 By August 2008, and _before_ the commencement of the Transaction, all of
the contracts under the Lanna Transaction (which did _not_ include the 2007
Coal Arrangements) had been purportedly terminated by Dicky Tan. Lanna
Resources disbursed the first tranche of the loan on 5 May 2008, but refused
to disburse the second tranche of the loan on the basis that Dicky Tan had
allegedly failed to provide a full account and statement demonstrating the
usage of the first tranche of the loan (the “Statement of Usage”).[note: 897]
This was conveyed to Dicky Tan by way of an email dated 19 June 2008.[note:
898] In response, Chandra on behalf of Dicky Tan wrote to Lanna Resources on
25 June 2008 stating that Dicky Tan was “surprised” by the request for the
Statement of Usage which is not required under the MOA.[note: 899] Dicky Tan’s
position, which was apparent from the email, was that the conditions for the
disbursement of the second tranche have been fulfilled.[note: 900] It is also
pertinent to note that the email highlighted the fact that the refusal to
disburse the second tranche of the loan “impeded and delayed [Dicky Tan’s]
construction plans for the coal port and jetty” and if Lanna Resources was
unwilling to disburse the second tranche then Dicky Tan would have to “make
other alternative financing arrangements”.[note: 901] While cl 1.4 of the MOA
states that the PP&B must be approved by Lanna Resources, Dicky Tan was of the
view that he had done all that he could to complete the PP&B and Lanna
Resources was acting unreasonably in refusing to disburse the second tranche
of the loan.[note: 902] Notwithstanding the email dated 25 June 2008, Lanna
Resources did not disburse the second tranche of the loan.[note: 903] Dicky
Tan took the position that this amounted to a repudiatory breach of the MOA
and the loan agreement, and thus, purported to terminate the Lanna
Transaction.[note: 904] This was in August 2008.[note: 905] There was no
reason for Chandra to issue a formal letter of termination after having been
instructed by Dicky Tan that the Lanna Transaction was “dead in the
water”.[note: 906] There also appears to be no basis for Chandra to doubt
Dicky Tan’s consistent instructions. I pause to note that Dicky Tan maintained
the same position in the court and arbitration proceedings which took place
subsequently.[note: 907] Consequently, no coal was supplied to Lanna Resources
under the 2008 Coal Arrangements,[note: 908] and Dicky Tan had to look for a
new investor to provide him with funds necessary for the infrastructure
upgrading at the Mine.[note: 909] It was only _after_ the Lanna Transaction
had been purportedly terminated that Chandra was asked by Dicky Tan to assist
in the Transaction. Subsequently, Nava Bharat came into the picture in
September 2008 (see [9] above).

436 Nava Bharat contends that Chandra would have known that the Lanna
Transaction had not, in fact, been terminated.[note: 910] This appears to be
based on four points, namely:

(a) Dicky Tan was still communicating with Lanna Resources around August
2008.[note: 911]

(b) Chandra was unable to state a specific date on which the termination
occurred.[note: 912]

(c) The termination of the Lanna Transaction was not raised with Lanna
Resources after August 2008 or as a defence in the course of the
arbitration.[note: 913]

(d) The representative of Lanna Resources remained stationed at the site of
the Mine from June to November 2008.[note: 914]

437 I find Nava Bharat’s contention to be unmeritorious. Taking Nava Bharat’s
case at its highest, it would only demonstrate that the parties to the Lanna
Transaction were in dispute over the purported termination. Dicky Tan informed
Chandra that he “told [Lanna Resources] that the deal was off”.[note: 915]
There was no apparent reason for Chandra to doubt the instructions of Dicky
Tan. Moreover, I do not think that the evidence supports all of the points
that Nava Bharat had raised.

438 As I have alluded to earlier, the evidence shows that Dicky Tan had, in
substance, raised the issue of termination in the court and arbitration
proceedings arising out of the Lanna Transaction.

439 In addition, neither of the other two points that were raised by Nava
Bharat (see [436(a)] and [436(b)] above) is necessarily inconsistent with the
fact that the Lanna Transaction was in fact terminated. The mere fact that
Chandra accepted the instructions of Dicky Tan notwithstanding that Lanna
Resources was taking a contrary position is _not_ evidence that he knew that
Dicky Tan was not entitled to terminate the Lanna Transaction _or_ that the
Lanna Transaction was not actually terminated. Nava Bharat refers to a series
of communication between Lanna Resources and Saraburi to prove that Chandra
was acting with Dicky Tan (and Jason Tan) to cheat Lanna Resources of US$2m
with the hollow promise that it would get coal from the Mine.[note: 916] These
include (a) a series of emails from Lanna Resources to Saraburi complaining
that the PP&B was deficient and asking for the return of the US$2m to which
Chandra did not reply,[note: 917] and (b) a draft email prepared by Chandra on
23 January 2009 which appears to show that Dicky Tan was willing to offer
certain concessions to Lanna Resources.[note: 918] In my view, there was no
need for Chandra to respond to Lanna Resources after Dicky Tan had informed
him that he would take care of the issue personally.[note: 919] This is
consistent with the fact that Chandra was asked to prepare the email on 23
January 2009 which was never eventually sent to Lanna Resources.[note: 920] It
is not uncommon for parties to choose to negotiate with each other directly
without the involvement of lawyers, and the fact that Dicky Tan was taking a
hard stance against Lanna Resource did not appear to be out of the ordinary.
Taken in the proper context, I am of the view that the draft email on 23
January 2009 was nothing more than a “without prejudice” offer by Dicky Tan to
reach an “amicable settlement” with Lanna Resources “in relation to the first
tranche of US$2 million” which had been disbursed.[note: 921] Pertinently, it
did _not_ involve Dicky Tan offering Lanna Resources an interest in the
Mine.[note: 922]

440 As for the representative of Lanna Resources who was stationed at the site
of the Mine (see [436(d)] above), I find that it does not show that the Lanna
Transaction had not been terminated or that Chandra must have known about it.
Nava Bharat essentially relies on the AEIC of Prasert Promdech, an employee of
Lanna Resources, filed in the suit brought against Dicky Tan and Tanakorn. He
explained that Lanna Resources stationed one Khun Samran at the site of the
Mine between June and November 2008.[note: 923] There is nothing to indicate
that Dicky Tan invited Lanna Resources to send a representative or if Dicky
Tan even consented to it. I do not think that the fact that Khun Samran was
stationed at the Mine would suggest that Chandra fabricated his evidence as to
the termination of the Lanna Transaction in August 2008. On the contrary, I
think that it is consistent with Chandra’s evidence. Khun Samran was
instructed to monitor the Mine’s operations and report on the progress and
records of any shipments or deliveries made by Saraburi or SBH.[note: 924]
This could have been necessary because Lanna Resources had received no coal
under the 2008 Coal Arrangements. It is noteworthy that Khun Samran had
reported that the Mine continued to be operational in August 2008 but Lanna
Resources did not receive any coal.[note: 925] This is consistent with
Chandra’s evidence that the Lanna Transaction had been purportedly terminated
by Dicky Tan around August 2008.

441 Nava Bharat also argues that the alleged termination of the Lanna
Transaction in August 2008 was a fabrication because Chandra had only raised
it for the first time in his supplemental AEIC on 29 April 2013.[note: 926]
Having considered the sequence of events preceding the filing of Chandra’s
supplemental AEIC,[note: 927] as well as the evidence available before me, I
do not think that it was wrong for Chandra to adduce further evidence as Nava
Bharat amended its pleadings to introduce new matters that were not previously
raised.

442 Since the 2007 Coal Arrangements had not been terminated, Dicky Tan sought
to honour his obligations thereunder. It was in this respect that Chandra
wrote to Lanna Resources on 9 December 2008 informing it that Saraburi and
PTBHM shall “honour the commitment they have made to you under the 2 contracts
to supply 300,000 tons of coal to you”.[note: 928] While the letter from
Chandra did not specify if he was referring to the 2007 or 2008 Coal
Arrangements, it was clear that only the former and not the latter concerned
300,000 tons of coal.[note: 929] Even though it appears that the parties must
have intended for the coal to come from the Mine, I have earlier mentioned
that there appears to be no such specification under the 2007 Coal
Arrangements (see [432] above). In other words, it was possible that Dicky Tan
had some other plans to fulfil those obligations to Lanna Resources
notwithstanding the Transaction. Moreover, Nava Bharat was aware of Dicky
Tan’s commitment to supply coal from the Mine to Lanna Resources. On 16
September 2008, Bhushan had informed Prasad _via_ a conference call that the
“[c]urrent production level is 30,000mt pm and this volume is committed to
Thailand till dec. 08”.[note: 930] On 23 December 2008, in the course of the
due diligence exercise, Chandra also pointed out to Nava Bharat that his
instructions were that Dicky Tan had been “operating the mine since December
2007 and have been exporting to Thailand”.[note: 931] Bob Sundaram also
testified during the hearing that he and Ashwin knew that Dicky Tan was
shipping coal to Lanna Resources in 2008 when Tanakorn was providing them with
coal samples from the Mine around April 2009.[note: 932] I find that Nava
Bharat was fully aware that Dicky Tan was shipping coal to Lanna Resources in
Thailand between 2007 and 2008.

443 After the Lanna Transaction was purportedly terminated by Dicky Tan, Lanna
Resources commenced (a) an action in the Singapore High Court against Dicky
Tan and Tanakorn based on the guarantees and (b) an arbitration against
Saraburi and SBH based on cl 7.2 of the MOA. Chandra was not involved in the
proceedings except to recommend his sister-in-law, Bhargavan Sujatha
(“Sujatha”) of Toh Tan & Partners, to Dicky Tan.[note: 933] He did so because
Dicky Tan wanted a cheaper alternative to TPC.[note: 934] It is pertinent to
note that the communications between Chandra, Dicky Tan and Jason Tan had _no_
specific references to the proceedings involving Lanna Resources.[note: 935]
This was conceded by Nava Bharat.[note: 936] Nava Bharat asks for an inference
to be drawn that Chandra knew and was involved in the proceedings involving
Lanna Resources simply because he was involved in the Lanna Transaction,[note:
937] but I see no basis to do so. On the contrary, it is consistent with the
fact that Sujatha had taken over both the suit as well as the arbitration.

444 To be complete, I should add that Lanna Resources had not relied on the
Deed of Assignment to assert any rights in the nature of an “economic
interest” in the Mine (leaving aside the question of whether it would have
been entitled to do so; see [434] above). It appears from the records that
Lanna Resources had only sued for breach of contract and asked for the
repayment of the first tranche of the loan as well as interest.[note: 938]

445 Nava Bharat contends that Dicky Tan’s alleged mode of operation in
perpetrating fraud was to take money from investors and then renege on his end
of the bargain.[note: 939] However, this is not supported by the evidence. The
purpose of the loan from Lanna Resources was clear to both parties, namely, to
provide financing for the intended infrastructure improvements at the Mine. By
claiming that Dicky Tan “took the money and ran”, Nava Bharat is insinuating
that the first tranche of the loan was never used for the intended purpose.
This is contrary to the evidence which shows that Saraburi was in fact facing
claims from contractors after Lanna Resources defaulted on the second tranche
of the loan. Apart from Chandra’s evidence,[note: 940] there is also evidence
from the arbitration arising out of the Lanna Transaction which shows that
Saraburi had to halt the construction of the infrastructure improvements at
the Mine due to shortage of funds.[note: 941] Indeed, it would be odd for
Dicky Tan to supply substantial amount of coal (approximately 127,000 tons) to
Lanna Resources under the 2007 Coal Arrangement,[note: 942]_or_ consider
making a “without prejudice” offer (see [439] above), if he was intending to
defraud Lanna Resources. I also note that there is a complete dearth of
evidence supporting Nava Bharat’s assertion. Dicky Tan may or may not be
_legally_ entitled to terminate the Lanna Transaction, but that is not
pertinent for the present case. The crucial point is whether the evidence
supports Nava Bharat’s assertion that Chandra knew and was involved in the
alleged conspiracy with Dicky Tan and Jason Tan to defraud Nava Bharat. There
is no temporal overlap between the Lanna Transaction and the Transaction.
Chandra understood Dicky Tan to have taken the position that the Lanna
Transaction was terminated and wanted to find an alternative arrangement for
financing the infrastructure upgrading. All that was left was the 2007 Coal
Arrangements, and Nava Bharat knew about it. In these circumstances, I find it
difficult to accept that Dicky Tan’s conduct in relation to the Lanna
Transaction supports Nava Bharat’s allegation that Chandra is part of a
conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat.

(b) Belfield Loan

446 Nava Bharat also contends that Chandra’s involvement in the “shady
dealings” with Jason Tan and Dicky Tan is exemplified by the Belfield
Loan.[note: 943] Nava Bharat claims that Chandra did not question the need for
the Belfield Loan despite knowing that Dicky Tan had earlier received US$3m as
upfront payment from Nava Bharat,[note: 944] and went on to say that Chandra
deliberately kept information about the Belfield Loan from Nava Bharat and
secured a further US$250,000 as upfront payment from Nava Bharat for the same
purpose (_ie_ , to obtain the Forestry Licence).[note: 945] Nava Bharat
suggests that Chandra knew that the Mine was used as security for the Belfield
Loan but did not disclose to Nava Bharat because he was involved in the
conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat.[note: 946]

447 The Belfield Loan, which concerned a relatively small sum of
US$200,000,[note: 947] was purportedly meant to finance the procurement of the
Forestry Licence. It was repaid in full.[note: 948] PTIC was never subject to
any claims from Belfield and the Mine was not exposed to enforcement
proceedings. On this set of facts alone, it is difficult to see how the
Belfield Loan supports the allegation that there is a conspiracy to defraud
Nava Bharat or Chandra’s involvement in it. This is true even if it might have
been wrong for Dicky Tan to have used PTIC to obtain a loan without informing
Nava Bharat about it.[note: 949] In fact, it militates against Nava Bharat’s
case that there was a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. If there was any such
a conspiracy, Dicky Tan would not have tried to procure the Forestry Licence
_or_ repay the Belfield Loan.

448 In any case, Nava Bharat could not show that Chandra was actually involved
in the Belfield Loan. Chandra’s evidence was that he had nothing to do with
the Belfield Loan other than to introduce Dicky Tan to Belfield and witnessing
the signing of the documents. The communications between Chandra, Dicky Tan
and Jason Tan do not make any reference to the Belfield Loan. The _sole_ piece
of evidence that Nava Bharat seeks to rely on to prove that Chandra was
involved in the Belfield Loan is the similarities between the guarantee
prepared by Chandra in the Lanna Transaction and the guarantee in the Belfield
Loan.[note: 950] Nava Bharat asserts that the similarities must lead to the
conclusion that the documents were prepared “by the same person”.[note: 951]
On this basis, Nava Bharat claims that Chandra had used Sujatha as a front and
had personally conducted the transactions.[note: 952] However, there appears
to be a reasonable explanation for the similarities. Chandra explained on
cross-examination that both guarantees are similar because they are based on
the “DBS small and medium enterprise guarantee format”.[note: 953] I am not
persuaded by Nava Bharat’s response that Sujatha is a general litigation
practitioner and therefore could not possibly have handled a simple task such
as the drafting of a guarantee based on a standard template.[note: 954]

(3) Completion without Forestry Licence

449 Nava Bharat raises several points in attempt to show that the completion
of the Transaction without a Forestry Licence was actually part of a
conspiracy to defraud it (see [414(c)]–[414(g)] above). Nava Bharat claims
that the conspiracy was to “sell [it] a mine that was not readily
operational”, and more specifically, to induce Nava Bharat to pay for the
rights to a mine which they knew Nava Bharat would never receive.[note: 955] I
note that the conspiracy, as alleged by Nava Bharat, is inherently
inconsistent. If the conspiracy was to deprive Nava Bharat of its rights to
the Mine from the start, then it does not appear to cohere well with the fact
that, among other things, Dicky Tan tried and eventually obtained the AIP and
the Forestry Licence for Nava Bharat.

450 Nevertheless, I will deal with Nava Bharat’s arguments below and show why
I am not persuaded by them.

(a) Falsely representing that Mine was legally operational

451 Nava Bharat asserts that, as part of the alleged conspiracy, Chandra
represented to Nava Bharat that the Mine was legally operational when he knew
that it was not because there was no Forestry Licence. There are two parts to
the assertion, namely, that Chandra had represented (as opposed to conveying
the position of Dicky Tan) that the Mine was legally operational and that
Chandra knew that the Mine was _not_ legally operational because there was no
Forestry Licence.

452 Nava Bharat relies on Chandra’s involvement in the Lanna Transaction in
its attempt to show that Chandra knew that the Forestry Licence was necessary
for mining operations to commence legally.[note: 956] In particular, Nava
Bharat says that the Deed of Assignment, which assigned the rights of Dicky
Tan under the PTBHM Sale and Purchase Agreement to Lanna Resources, was
drafted by Chandra and that one of the items in the list of assets in the
PTBHM Sale and Purchase Agreement was the Forestry Licence for the Mine.[note:
957] Chandra’s evidence was that he did not know that a Forestry Licence was
required at the outset of the Transaction.[note: 958] He explained that he did
not read the PTBHM Sale and Purchase Agreement given to him because it was in
“Bahasa Indonesia”,[note: 959] and he was not proficient in it.[note: 960]
Apart from the language, it appears that there is no real need for Chandra to
refer to the PTBHM Sale and Purchase Agreement. The Deed of Assignment that
Chandra prepared was a short five-page document which comprised mostly of
boilerplate clauses.[note: 961] Chandra’s evidence was that the Deed of
Assignment was meant to assign the chose in action and _not_ the list of
assets,[note: 962] such that there was no need for him to undertake an
analysis of the list of assets under the PTBHM Sale and Purchase Agreement. He
also testified that he verified the content and authenticity of the PTBHM Sale
and Purchase Agreement with his client, Dicky Tan as well as the letter from
Wira Yustitia Law Office, an Indonesian law firm, on 27 March 2008 confirmed
that the PTBHM Sale and Purchase Agreement was “binding and valid”.[note: 963]
In addition, I note that Chandra is not trained in Indonesian law.[note: 964]
Even if it was true that Chandra had read the PTBHM Sale and Purchase
Agreement _and_ found out that the Forestry Licence was one of the items on
the list of assets, I do not think that he would have necessarily known that
it was a legal prerequisite for PTIC to operate the Mine.

453 At this juncture, it is apposite to refer to the Court of Appeal’s
observations in _Bachoo Mohan Singh v Public Prosecutor and another matter_
[2010] 4 SLR 137 at [119] in relation to a solicitor’s duty to verify his
client’s instructions:

Where ... the client’s instructions are consistent and unwavering, the answer
must surely be that there is no peculiar requirement to take extraordinary
steps to assess the veracity of the client’s story. …

I find that, in light of Dicky Tan’s consistent instructions as well as the
view of Jason Tan (who Chandra understands to be an Indonesian lawyer), there
was no reason for Chandra to doubt the truth or veracity of Dicky Tan’s
instructions.

454 Chandra became aware of the possibility that a Forestry Licence might be
required when ABNR stated in its email dated 7 October 2008 to Chandra that “a
search with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is made to ensure
that the mine location is not overlapping with the forest area”.[note: 965]
Notwithstanding that, Dicky Tan’s instructions to Chandra had consistently
been that the Forestry Licence was _not_ required to operate the Mine.[note:
966] Dicky Tan claims that he has always been extracting and shipping coal
from the Mine without a Forestry Licence, and this was corroborated by Jason
Tan, who was an Indonesian lawyer.[note: 967] Chandra, who was not trained in
Indonesian law, had no basis to doubt the instructions of Dicky Tan as well as
the view taken by Jason Tan. As such, he acted in accordance with Dicky Tan’s
instructions and conveyed the same to Rajaram.[note: 968] In doing so, I find
that Chandra had _not_ made such representations with knowledge that it was
false, without belief in its truth, or recklessly without regard to whether it
was true or false.

455 In any case, I have earlier found that Nava Bharat was fully aware that
the Forestry Licence was required before the initial completion. In fact, Bob
Sundaram had informed Ashwin on 24 December 2008 that it was not proper to
continue mining without a Forestry Licence simply because it had been done
previously by Dicky Tan.[note: 969] The relevant part of the email reads:

Mines located on Production Forest with conversion status can be issued with a
[_sic_] exploitation as well as transport and export license ... It is the
obligation of the mine owner to obtain the approval letter from the Minister
of Forestry prior to start [of] mining.

The new mine owner may not be aware about it or the original owner may have
kept the information hidden so as to negotiate a better deal (only
assumption), we don’t know

One cannot just claim that, “this is a producing mine where the coal has been
exported out so there is no problem”. ...

456 Despite that, Nava Bharat was willing to proceed with the undertaking from
Dicky Tan that he would obtain the Forestry Licence if it was required. I
should add that Dicky Tan eventually accepted that the Forestry Licence was
necessary.[note: 970]

(b) Rushing towards completion despite lack of Forestry Licence

457 Nava Bharat also argues that Chandra worked with Dicky Tan and Jason Tan
to drive the Transaction towards completion in order to obtain the substantial
upfront payment, even though the Forestry Licence was outstanding.

458 Contrary to Nava Bharat’s allegation, I find that Chandra was only acting
in accordance with Dicky Tan’s instructions and conveying the same to Rajaram
when he expressed Dicky Tan’s desires to push for completion of the
Transaction. I accept Chandra’s evidence that it was Dicky Tan who was setting
the deadlines and pressing for the completion of the Transaction.[note: 971]
This is corroborated by documentary evidence. On 18 December 2008, Jason Tan
wrote, on behalf of Dicky Tan, to Chandra stating that he would “wish [for]
the Agreement [to] be executed before Christmas”.[note: 972] One day later,
Jason Tan again wrote to convey Dicky Tan’s instructions to push for initial
completion within tight deadlines. The relevant part of the email reads:[note:
973]

Dear Chandra,

_Dicky just called me few minutes ago and asking me to convey_ his
disappointment for the delay of the execution of the Agreement due to the end
of the year’s holiday of Nava Bharat’s Jakarta lawyers. As what have been
agreed during the last meeting in Raja’s office, Raja has confirmed with Dicky
to obtain the transfer of KP Eksplolitasi Licence before 19 December 2008 in
order to execute the Agreement as scheduled on 19 December 2008 in Nava
Bharat’s Jakarta lawyers office.

...

PT. Indoasia Cemerlang are really exhausted to pursue all the documentations
to be deemed for the execution but it is very disappointed to learn that the
execution has to be halted after the documentations are in order for
execution. In this respect, _Dicky and I have decided and confirmed to call
off the Agreement if the Agreement is not executed by today_ , 19 December
2008 at 17:00 hours of Jakarta time = 18:00 hours Singapore time ...

[emphasis added]

459 Chandra was acting on Dicky Tan’s instructions when he wrote to Lakshman
on 15 January 2009 stating that “[w]e must close [the Transaction] next week
with a definite date given to all parties”.[note: 974] This is supported by
Rajaram’s response on 16 January 2009 where he said to Chandra that “[y]ou had
indicated to me that your client’s [_sic_] want the transaction to be
completed before the Chinese New Year or the deal will be called off”.[note:
975]

460 It appears from the evidence that there were no representations made
independently by Chandra that did not emanate from Dicky Tan or Jason Tan.
Nava Bharat was unable to point to any evidence in the correspondence between
Chandra and Jason Tan or Dicky Tan to show that Chandra had taken the
initiative to push for completion. In fact, Ashwin agreed at the hearing that
Chandra had sought to facilitate meetings between Dicky Tan and Nava Bharat to
resolve any outstanding issues prior to the initial completion.[note: 976]
Therefore, contrary to the allegation by Nava Bharat, I find that Chandra was
acting on the instructions of Dicky Tan or Jason Tan.

461 Nava Bharat appears to be suggesting that Chandra ought to have advised
against haste in light of the absence of the Forestry Licence and the
uncertainty in the new mining law,[note: 977] and in this regard, Nava Bharat
alleges that Chandra must have been acting in concert with Dicky Tan and Jason
Tan because there was “not one single email showing that Chandra had commented
that parties should perhaps slow down and reflect”.[note: 978] In the same
vein, Nava Bharat claims that there was no email between Chandra and Jason Tan
in which he addressed the issue of Forestry Licence with Jason Tan, because it
did not matter to him.[note: 979] Nava Bharat asserts that Chandra had aligned
himself with Dicky Tan and Jason Tan, and that they represented that the
Forestry Licence was not required in order to induce Nava Bharat to complete
the Transaction.[note: 980] However, I do not see how any of these allegations
would advance Nava Bharat’s case. As I have mentioned earlier, Chandra was
acting on the instructions of his client, Dicky Tan. Nava Bharat also alleges
that Chandra was part of a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat because he came
up with a “defensive posture” for Dicky Tan to deal with Nava Bharat.[note:
981] In this respect, Nava Bharat refers to Dicky Tan’s email dated 6 January
2009.[note: 982] The email, however, relates to advice by Chandra to Dicky Tan
on how to “walk away” from the Transaction. It is farfetched to say that the
email shows that Chandra is part of a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. In
fact, Chandra was advising Dicky Tan as to his obligations under the
Transaction (see [490] below).

(c) Fabricating undertaking by Dicky Tan

462 I turn to Nava Bharat’s next point, namely, that Chandra fabricated the
existence of the undertaking by Dicky Tan to obtain the Forestry Licence if it
was required, in order to perpetrate the fraud and “mask the
conspiracy”.[note: 983] I have earlier found that Nava Bharat knew that there
was a need for the Forestry Licence and that it had decided to proceed with
the undertaking from Dicky Tan to obtain the Forestry Licence if it was
required. There is, therefore, no basis for Nava Bharat’s allegation that the
undertaking was a “smoke screen” to perpetrate the fraud.[note: 984]

(d) Falsely representing that efforts were made to obtain Forestry Licence

463 Nava Bharat also contends that after the initial completion, Jason Tan,
Dicky Tan and Chandra adopted a “different strategy to further their
conspiracy”.[note: 985] In particular, Chandra falsely represented to Nava
Bharat that efforts were being made to procure the Forestry Licence so as to
string Nava Bharat along and extract more money from it.[note: 986]

464 Before I address the contention, I should first deal with the “letter of
authority” which allegedly authorised the extraction of 50,000 tons of coal by
March 2009. Nava Bharat claims that Chandra ignored Rajaram’s reference to the
letter of authority in his emails on 11 and 12 March 2009 after the initial
completion because he knew that it was part of a ruse to influence Rajaram to
get Nava Bharat to complete without the Forestry Licence.[note: 987] On the
other hand, Chandra’s evidence was that he did not know about the “letter of
authority” at the time of the completion.[note: 988] He was only informed that
Tanakorn had a “temporary licence” in March 2009.[note: 989] As for the emails
from Rajaram, Chandra explained that he spoke to Rajaram over the phone and
agreed that there was no need to be concerned with the “letter of authority”
because Dicky Tan had, at that point in time, acknowledged that the Forestry
Licence was required.[note: 990] Again, I fail to see how Nava Bharat can
possibly suggest that, on these facts, Chandra knew and was involved in some
alleged conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. In my view, the fact that Rajaram
had stopped asking about the letter of authorisation after the two emails in
March 2009 suggests that Chandra had addressed the concerns of Rajaram as well
as Nava Bharat. This is more in line with Chandra’s explanation. It simply
does not make sense that Rajaram (and more importantly, Nava Bharat) would
stop raising the issue because Chandra had ignored his emails.[note: 991]

465 I return to the issue of whether Chandra had represented to Nava Bharat
that efforts were being made to obtain the Forestry Licence, even though he
knew that it was not true, in order to string Nava Bharat along and to extract
more money. Nava Bharat points to three instances where Chandra informed that
Dicky Tan was out of funds and needed further financing to obtain the Forestry
Licence, namely, the meeting on 16 March 2009 followed by the email dated 23
March 2009 (see [61]–[62] above), the Variation Agreement and the Addendum
Agreement.[note: 992] In particular, Nava Bharat emphasises that US$250,000
was paid upfront to Dicky Tan under the Addendum Agreement.[note: 993]

466 At this juncture, I pause to note that Nava Bharat was advised _before_
the initial completion by Bob Sundaram on the possible difficulties and issues
that could arise in the course of applying for the Forestry Licence. On 19
December 2008, Bob Sundaram wrote an email to Ashwin in which he said:

The procedure to get the approval letter from Federal Forestry Dept

\- Recommendation letter from Bupati required (already available)

\- Recommendation letter from state forestry dept is required

\- Recommendation letter from the Governor is required

According to forestry officer once all the recommendation papers are in place
then it is not a problem to issue this approval from Federal Forestry dept.
_Money need to be spent to get this entire recommendation letter both at state
and federal level. This situation has been quite normal in the mining
industry._

[emphasis added]

467 At the hearing, Bob Sundaram clarified that there are other steps that had
to be completed _after_ receiving the recommendation letters in order to
obtain the Forestry Licence.[note: 994] He also explained that the money to be
spent to get the recommendation letters were payments to expedite the process
for the Forestry Licence:[note: 995]

Q:... can you tell the court why it is stated here that money needs to be
spent to get this entire recommendation letter both at the state and federal
levels?

A:Yes, because if we need to get the letter from the – say, for example, the
head of the province, the governor, we have to go through different channels,
and in Indonesia the bureaucracy is such -- the bureaucracy is such and it
will take very, very long time. Mainly to expedite, it is normal that money is
spent. That’s what I meant.

468 Even if such payments were made, Bob Sundaram acknowledged that the time
required for the procurement of the Forestry Licence was uncertain because of
the many variables involved.[note: 996] He accepted that if the application
was not properly managed, then there is a possibility that the process may
take a long time even if payments had been made.[note: 997]

469 In the circumstances, I find that Nava Bharat was clearly aware of the
potential issues that could arise in the procurement of the Forestry Licence.
Nevertheless, despite knowing that there was no Forestry Licence _and_ the
potential issues that might arise when applying for it, Nava Bharat was minded
to push forward with the Transaction. It is in this light that I now turn to
consider the allegation that Chandra was, as part of a conspiracy, trying to
string Nava Bharat along.

470 True to Bob Sundaram’s warning in his email of 19 December 2008, the
application process for the Forestry Licence turned out to be slow and
expensive. I accept Chandra’s evidence that he was not personally involved in
the procurement of the Forestry Licence.[note: 998] As I have earlier
mentioned, he was not trained in Indonesian law. His role was therefore only
to convey instructions that he received from Dicky Tan (or Jason Tan
purportedly on behalf of Dicky Tan) to Rajaram. As he explained at the
hearing, he was given periodic updates by Dicky Tan and Jason Tan on the
progress of the application.[note: 999] This is corroborated by the
correspondence which show that Jason Tan wrote to Chandra to update him on the
procurement of the AIP and the Forestry Licence:

(a) On 5 September 2009, Jason sent an email to update Chandra on the status
of the AIP. He said that Dicky Tan was “in full speed to obtain the AIP and
hopefully it could be issued on time”.[note: 1000] He also said that he would
keep Chandra “informed and updated on the issuance of AIP”.[note: 1001]

(b) On 17 September 2009, Jason sent an email to inform Chandra that PTIC had
obtained an explanation letter from the Forestry Ministry to “prove to Nava
Bharat that the application of [the Forestry Licence] [was] really under
process”.[note: 1002] He also asked Chandra to convey his regrets and “ask the
understanding from Nava Bharat in due course as [Dicky Tan and Jason Tan]
[were] also very exhausted by this unforeseen bureaucracy”.[note: 1003]

(c) On 16 October 2009, Jason sent an email to inform Chandra that the
approval process was “very tiring ... and fund consuming due to the
inefficient bureacracy”, which he felt was more aptly termed as “bureaucrazy
for money”.[note: 1004]

471 Notwithstanding the delays, and having been advised on the exit option,
Nava Bharat made the commercial decision to continue and press for better
commercial terms from Dicky Tan (see [349]–[362] above). This is evident from,
_inter alia_ , the “without prejudice” discussions which led to the draft
Tripartite Agreement which would have required the valuation of the Mine to be
revisited based on “present market conditions” (see [98]–[99] above). Notably,
the valuation of the Mine would have been further reduced from US$19m (as
agreed in the Supplemental Master Agreement) to US$17.5m.[note: 1005] Even
though the draft Tripartite Agreement was never concluded, it was clear
evidence demonstrating Nava Bharat’s desire to capitalise on the delay in
obtaining the Forestry Licence.

472 Pertinently, and contrary to Nava Bharat’s allegation of a conspiracy to
defraud, Dicky Tan eventually obtained the Forestry Licence on 19 October
2010.[note: 1006] After obtaining the Forestry Licence, there is no dispute
that PTIC was able to commence mining operations legally at the Mine.[note:
1007]

(e) Requested Nava Bharat exercise exit option to “hide the conspiracy”

473 As a result of the delay in obtaining the Forestry Licence, Chandra
informed Nava Bharat on 21 December 2009 that it may exercise its exit option
under the Master Agreement.[note: 1008] Nava Bharat claims that it was a
“false front to hide the conspiracy”.[note: 1009]

474 To put things in their proper context, I should note that the evidence
shows that Nava Bharat was aware of its right to exercise the exit option and
terminate the Transaction in light of the difficulties in the procurement of
the Forestry Licence. I have earlier discussed a number of instances where
Rajaram had advised Nava Bharat about the exit option _before_ Chandra’s email
dated 21 December 2009 (see [351]–[354] above).

475 In that email, Chandra proposed that Nava Bharat could exit in return for
repayment of the investment in coal. Nava Bharat claims that the email
illustrates Chandra’s involvement in the conspiracy as he was apparently
acting without instructions from Dicky Tan or Jason Tan and he could not have
honestly believed in the offer given that no coal had been produced since
initial completion.[note: 1010] I do not agree. For a start, I find it strange
that Nava Bharat is suggesting that the proposal was so absurd that Chandra
could not have honestly believed that it was possible. If this was true, then
it would have been an outrageous offer that Nava Bharat, fully aware of the
circumstances, would most certainly reject. I find this to be unlikely. The
simple answer, in my view, appears to be that the proposal was nothing more
than an invitation for parties to negotiate over the terms if Nava Bharat was
keen on exercising the exit option. The terms of the offer shows that Dicky
Tan was trying to cut a better deal but this is common in business. I do not
think that it is necessarily an indication of fraud _or_ a conspiracy to
defraud Nava Bharat. Indeed, I note that this was not the first time that
Chandra had conveyed Dicky Tan’s message for Nava Bharat to reconsider the
Transaction – on 30 October 2008, before the initial completion (and the
payment of the US$3m), Chandra had on instructions of Dicky Tan told Nava
Bharat to consider deferring equity injection if it “does not feel comfortable
or has concerns about Dicky”.[note: 1011]

476 In any case, I have earlier found that Chandra was not trained in
Indonesian law (see [452] above) and not involved in the application process
for the Forestry Licence (see [470] above). He conveyed the instructions of
his client, Dicky Tan, to Nava Bharat for its consideration.[note: 1012] While
it may be easy to criticise with the benefit of hindsight, I do not think that
it is appropriate to do so. Taking the circumstances as they were at that
point in time, I find that there is insufficient evidence to show that Chandra
was not acting with honest belief that the proposal might have been feasible
under Indonesian law.

(4) Loan to Dicky Tan instead of PTIC

477 Nava Bharat also alleges that Chandra structured the loan to be given to
Dicky Tan instead of PTIC as part of the conspiracy to obtain payment from
Nava Bharat,[note: 1013] and at the same time deprive Nava Bharat of the
shares of PTIC. Specifically, the allegation is that Chandra exerted influence
over Rajaram to act against the advice of ABNR.[note: 1014] To recapitulate,
ABNR had advised Nava Bharat that the conversion of the loan to shares in PTIC
may not be possible if the debtor was Dicky Tan instead of PTIC (see [316]
above).

478 I do not think that there is any basis for Nava Bharat’s allegation that
Chandra had worked towards changing of the debtor from PTIC to Dicky Tan as
part of a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. I have earlier found that Nava
Bharat and Dicky Tan agreed, notwithstanding their earlier intentions, to make
Dicky Tan the debtor to the loan (see [317] above). It appears that Dicky Tan
needed the money for the expenses incurred in getting the transfer and to pay
for jetty and the road works. Pertinently, Chandra did _not_ represent on the
impact of the change in the debtor to the loan from PTIC to Dicky Tan.
Instead, he made the suggestion to Nava Bharat based on his client’s
instruction.[note: 1015] The instructions appeared in the circumstances to be
wholly reasonable. ABNR’s advice for the loan to be given to PTIC instead of
Dicky Tan appears to be based on the impression that the loan would be
converted into shares through the issuance of _new_ shares by PTIC.[note:
1016] However, as Chandra explained, the Transaction was meant to be a “sale”
of the shares in PTIC held by Dicky Tan to Nava Bharat, and Chandra understood
that, as a result, the money ought to have been paid to Dicky Tan instead of
PTIC.[note: 1017] I do not think that there is anything inherently sinister
about it. After having been advised by ABNR on the implications of the change
in the debtor from PTIC to Dicky Tan (see [316] above), Nava Bharat agreed to
Dicky Tan’s request. To be very clear, I should say that I am unconvinced by
Nava Bharat’s attempt to blame Chandra (and Rajaram) for the change of the
debtor from PTIC to Dicky Tan. If Nava Bharat was prepared to act against the
advice of ABNR (assuming, for the sake of argument, that ABNR advised against
giving the loan to Dicky Tan), then there was nothing that Chandra or Rajaram
could have done. I do not think that the evidence would demonstrate that there
was a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat _or_ that Chandra was a part of it.

479 In any case, I note that the change of the debtor from PTIC to Dicky Tan
did not prevent Nava Bharat from exercising the share pledges and acquiring
the shares in PTIC (see [122] above).

(5) Indonesian legal proceedings

480 By way of background, I should point out that the Transaction had led to a
series of legal proceedings in Indonesia, and the ones that are relevant for
the present purposes are Case No 1, Case No 72 and Case No 98 (see [386]
above). The key focus of Nava Bharat’s case is on Case No 1, which involves
the Central Jakarta District Court invalidating the transfer of the shares in
PTIC to Dicky Tan and thereby effectively rendering void the transfer of the
PTIC shares, by virtue of the share pledges, to Nava Bharat’s Indonesian
nominees.

481 Before I go into my analysis, it would be helpful to set out the key facts
that Nava Bharat seeks to rely on for its allegation. On 4 January 2010,
Bhushan informed Ashwin through email that there was a family dispute brewing
between Dicky Tan and his brothers over the ownership of the PTIC
shares.[note: 1018] The material parts of the email read:

Background – he claims his middle brother holding 50pct of equity in this mine
has now given POA to Jason hence dicky is helpless with jason also having put
in separate moneys.

...

With the above, he can discuss with his middle brother and get the POA and get
going with us.

At around the same time, in January 2010, Case No 1 was commenced in
Indonesia.[note: 1019] On 23 March 2010, the Central Jakarta District Court
decided against Dicky Tan and in favour of the previous shareholders of PTIC.
On 1 October 2010, a meeting was held between Ashwin and Jason Tan to resolve
issues arising out of the draft settlement agreement. The relevant parts of
the minutes of the meeting read:[note: 1020]

**Agenda: To understand from CC and Jason reasons for delay in signing the
documents for transfer of shares in P.T. Indoasia Cemerlang (PTIC) to Nava
Bharat Singapore Pte Ltd (NBS) and to resolve any issues which might
impediment obtaining of the Forestry Licence by NBS.**

MR brought forward pertinent issues which need to be resolved by Dicky Tan
(DT), and requested CC to enlighten AD and BR on the reason for delay in
signing the Settlement Agreement and the documents for transfer of shares in
PTIC.

MR furthered [_sic_] stated that CC had on various occasions from 7 August
till date informed MR that DT was waiting for Jason’s consent to sign the
documents, therefore requested Jason to explain the delay.

CC represented that DT will not be able to execute any document with respect
to PTIC as he has been stripped of his powers in PTIC by the other
shareholders of PTIC.

MR highlighted that as per the shareholders register of PTIC, DT holds 90% of
shares in PTIC therefore it is difficult to understand how he has been striped
[_sic_] of his powers to act on behalf of PTIC.

Jason explained that there are some agreements between the prior shareholders
and DT under which DT owes them money and DT is in breach of those agreements.
It was further informed by Jason that the prior shareholders have threatened
to take legal action against DT if the monies owed to them are not paid by DT.

...

482 Nava Bharat’s allegation comprises a number of parts which are difficult
to comprehend. To my understanding, they are as follows:

(a) Chandra knew or would have known that Dicky Tan’s rights in PTIC had been
compromised as a result of a “family dispute”, before it was first revealed by
Bhushan on 4 January 2010, because of his close association with Jason Tan and
Dicky Tan and failure to “[ask] questions” when the situation arose.[note:
1021]

(b) Chandra knew about Jason Tan’s plan to deprive Nava Bharat of the shares
in PTIC because he was neither concerned nor surprised with the adverse claim
to the PTIC shares by Jason Tan.[note: 1022]

(c) Chandra knew about the alleged fraud perpetrated through Case No 1 because
of his close association with Jason Tan and Dicky Tan, his knowledge of the
family dispute, and the failure to seek clarification.[note: 1023]

(d) Dicky Tan and Jason Tan chose January 2010 to reverse the ownership of the
shares in PTIC because Nava Bharat was taking steps to exercise the share
pledges, and they knew about it because Chandra found out about it through
Rajaram.[note: 1024]

(e) The circumstances were indicative of a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat,
including Jason Tan’s involvement in both the family dispute as well as Case
No 1.[note: 1025]

483 I find that Nava Bharat’s allegation must fail. There is no evidence to
show that Chandra was in any way involved in the alleged fraud perpetrated
through Case No 1. Even though Chandra knew about the family dispute, I do not
think that it follows that he must have known about or was involved in the
alleged fraud perpetrated through Case No 1. Even if Chandra came to know
about Case No 1 subsequently (as Nava Bharat did), it did not mean that he
must have known that it was a fraudulent manoeuvre by Dicky Tan and/or Jason
Tan, or that he was part of a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. I will
elaborate below.

484 Nava Bharat submits that Chandra must have known about the alleged fraud
perpetrated through Case No 1.[note: 1026] However, I do not think that the
allegation is supported by evidence. I accept Chandra’s evidence that he had
no knowledge of Case No 1 in March or April 2010.[note: 1027] Significantly,
Chandra’s evidence is consistent with the communications between Chandra,
Dicky Tan and Jason Tan which shows that Chandra did not know and was not
involved in Case No 1.

485 I begin with the ABNR’s Third Draft Report dated 22 December 2008, where
it was stated that:[note: 1028]

H SHARE CERTIFICATE AND COLLECTIVE SHARE CERTIFICATE

Based on Article 5 of the Articles of Association, _as the evidence of the
ownership of shares_ , the Company may issue share certificate or collective
share certificate. Share certificate or collective share certificate shall be
signed by the Board of Directors.

The Company has issued share certificates, _i.e._ :-

a. Shares Certificate No.001/IAC/2008 – No. 080/IAC/2008 under the name of Mr.
Tan Beng Phiau Dick.

b. Shares Certificate No.081/IAC/2008 – N[o.] 100/IAC/2008 under the name of
Mr. Ridwan Halim.

[emphasis added]

486 The ABNR’s Third Draft Report clearly stated that Dicky Tan was the legal
owner of the PTIC shares. It is undisputed that Ridwan Halim was holding the
shares as Dicky Tan’s nominee. Indeed, Nava Bharat agrees that there is no
reason to doubt the accuracy of the due diligence findings.[note: 1029]

487 I go on to consider the correspondence exchanged between the parties from
the date of the ABNR’s Third Draft Report to January 2010 (when Case No 1 was
commenced in Indonesia). I find that the correspondence indicate that Chandra
genuinely believed that Dicky Tan was the legal owner of the PTIC shares. On
28 November 2008, Jason Tan sent an email to Chandra. The email was sent
around the time when the Master Agreement was being finalised by the parties
for execution. After having reviewed the draft Master Agreement, Jason Tan
informed Chandra to remove his name from it as he is not listed as a
shareholder or official of PTIC or PTAEI.[note: 1030] After the Master
Agreement was executed in January 2009, PTIC had to engage a mining
contractor. As such, Jason Tan sent an email to Chandra on 24 February 2009
informing him that Dicky Tan would be signing the Master Agreement on behalf
of PTIC.[note: 1031] These emails would have confirmed Chandra’s belief, in
accordance with the ABNR’s Third Draft Report, that Dicky Tan was the legal
owner of the PTIC shares. In light of the First Notice of Default, Jason Tan
sent an email to Chandra on 29 July 2009 in which Jason Tan was adamant that
control of PTIC should not be ceded over to Nava Bharat.[note: 1032] However,
I do not think that Chandra would have known or suspected that something was
amiss based on the email alone. Subsequently, on 12 August 2009, Chandra sent
an email to Jason Tan to explain that PTIC was in default.[note: 1033] He
highlighted that Nava Bharat was entitled to exercise its security rights if
PTIC failed to obtain the AIP on time.[note: 1034] Significantly, he pointed
out that PTIC had “no defence in view of the series of default”.[note: 1035]
In my view, there was no need for Chandra to advise PTIC and Dicky Tan on
their legal rights in or around August 2009 if he knew about or was part of
the conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat.

488 The correspondence between the parties in and after January 2010 (when
Case No 1 was commenced) would also reveal that Chandra was unaware of the
alleged fraud perpetrated through Case No 1. This is notwithstanding that he
might have known about the family dispute. Chandra’s evidence was that having
read Bhushan’s email on 4 January 2010, he approached Dicky Tan for a
clarification on the matter.[note: 1036] This contradicts Nava Bharat’s
allegation that Chandra had failed to “[ask] questions” on the family dispute.
Chandra’s explanation on the family dispute is pertinent, and I set it out
below:[note: 1037]

Q:What was the basis that you came to know that Jason Tan’s approval must be
obtained by Dicky Tan for Dicky Tan to sign the share transfer forms?

A:He told me that he needed Jason’s approval. Then I call Jason up
subsequently. Jason said, yes, there is a dispute going on, so the middle
brother and the family decided that Dicky is not allowed to sign, unless
Jason’s – who is the family lawyer -- consent was obtained, your Honour.

...

Q:So if Dicky Tan had no capacity to transfer the shares, any transfer he
makes to Nava Bharat can easily be cancelled, right?

A:What is your definition of capacity? He has the capacity, your Honour,
except that procedurally, because of the family issues, procedurally he had to
obtain Jason’s consent.

...

Q:... [D]id you or did you not know that Dicky Tan no longer could deal with
his shares ...

A:No, your Honour. Dicky wasn’t deprived of his shares. All he needed was to
have a consent of Jason.

...

A:... I did not at any point, you know, state that he has been stripped of all
his powers, he has been stripped of his shares. I never said that. In the
context of execution of documents.

Q:So as far as execution of documents are concerned, he needs Jason Tan’s
approval?

A:Yeah, to that extent he had lost his power, your Honour.

489 Chandra did not, at that point in time, find the explanation to be
suspicious.[note: 1038] He further explained that he had advised Dicky Tan
that he could choose not to seek Jason Tan’s approval before exercising his
rights as a shareholder of PTIC.[note: 1039] However, Dicky Tan felt that it
was a family dispute and he did not want to “rock the boat” so he would go
through the procedure of getting Jason Tan’s consent notwithstanding the legal
position.[note: 1040] I find his explanation to be a reasonable one. I note,
for completeness, that Nava Bharat probably came to know about the family
dispute but nevertheless decided during a meeting in or around February 2010
for the Transaction to proceed as before since Dicky Tan remained the owner of
PTIC on record.[note: 1041] This is likely in light of Bhushan’s email on 4
January 2010 informing Nava Bharat of the family dispute (see [481] above) as
well as the parties’ conduct after February 2010. At around that point in
time, the parties were in “without prejudice” discussions (which eventually
culminated in the draft Tripartite Agreement).

490 On 6 January 2009, Chandra sent an email to Jason Tan, and the material
part of the email reads:[note: 1042]

I think it is important that you, Dicky and I meet NB ... at the earliest
possible date. Reason is there is an existing legal agreement which does not
allow either NB or [PTIC] to walk away from the deal without a valid legal
reason. ...

For [PTIC] to walk away from the deal in circumstances where NB is ready and
willing to complete would tantamount to a breach of the Agreement of 13
October 2008. It is my legal duty to advise Dicky and [PTIC] of the
consequences of the breach. ...

491 Chandra’s evidence at the hearing was that Dicky Tan was upset about the
lack of progress in the Transaction and wanted to “walk away” from it.[note:
1043] Chandra therefore wrote to advise Dicky Tan that it would be a breach of
his obligations if he chose to do so.[note: 1044] Leaving aside the question
of whether it was appropriate for Chandra to advise Dicky Tan to take a
“defensive posture” against Nava Bharat and essentially lie about his
motivations for wanting to “walk away” from the Transaction, I think it is too
far a stretch to say that the email is evidence that Chandra is involved in a
conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. In fact, I am of the view that the email,
read as a whole, would suggest that there was, at least on 6 January 2009, no
conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. At that point in time, notably, Dicky Tan
had wanted to “walk away” from the Transaction despite _not_ having received
the US$3m which, as Chandra said in the email, Nava Bharat was _ready and
willing_ to pay.

492 Following that, Chandra continued to act on the basis that Dicky Tan is
the legal owner of the shares in PTIC. On 9 February 2010, Chandra sent an
email to Dicky Tan enclosing an English translation of the minutes of PTIC’s
extraordinary general meeting of shareholders.[note: 1045] The minutes
recorded that Dicky Tan and Ridwan Halim were still the legal shareholders of
PTIC.[note: 1046] There is no indication that Chandra knew about Case No 1.

493 Significantly, the correspondence between Chandra and Jason Tan after Case
No 1 was decided (on 23 March 2010 (see [386] above)) indicate that Chandra
did not know about the alleged fraud perpetrated through Case No 1 and
genuinely believed, at that point in time, that Dicky Tan still owned the
shares in PTIC. On 24 March 2010, Jason Tan sent an email to Chandra enclosing
the share certificates of PTIC and stated that “there are 100 shares and 80
shares owned by Dicky and another 20 shares owned by Ridwan Halim”.[note:
1047] This reaffirmed Chandra’s belief that Dicky Tan was the legal owner of
the PTIC shares, and the family dispute did not affect that. On 26 March 2010,
Chandra sent an email to Jason Tan enclosing a number of documents, including
the draft share transfer form for Dicky Tan to transfer the shares to the
nominee of Nava Bharat.[note: 1048] In my view, this is evidence that Chandra
was acting on his belief that Dicky Tan was still the owner of the PTIC
shares. It also implies that Chandra did not know about the alleged fraud
perpetrated through Case No 1. Pertinently, pursuant to the draft Tripartite
Agreement, Chandra requested for the original share certificates of PTIC to be
surrendered to him. Jason Tan replied on 29 March 2010, and the email
reads:[note: 1049]

I was surprised when informed by Dicky that _you are expecting the original
share certificates of_ [_PTIC_] _to be surrendered to you_ before receiving
the confirmation from NB on our latest proposal but on the contrary, I was
expecting the confirmation from NB prior the surrender of original
certificates of [PTIC] to you ... There should be no point for me to surrender
the original share certificates as long as NB does not confirm their
acceptance. [emphasis added]

494 I find the email dated 29 March 2010 to be highly indicative that Chandra
was not part of a conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. If, as Nava Bharat
claims, Chandra was aware of Case No 1 which was decided on 23 March 2010,
then there would be no reason for him to ask for the share certificates.
Indeed, he would have refrained from doing so. Chandra’s email to Jason Tan on
8 June 2010 is also telling. In that email, Chandra said that:[note: 1050]

As you are aware we need to transfer a portion of the equity interest in PTIC
to the nominee of NB at the time of the [disbursement] of the US$6 million.
For these purposes we need to execute transfer forms and the certificates. The
idea now is to execute these transfer forms and these togehter [_sic_] with
the certificates will be kept by me under escrow arrangement until
disbursement of the US$6 million

Could you kindly forward these certificates to me as part of the escrow
arrangement upon signing of the new agreement to document the latest proposals
...

495 In my view, the correspondence shows that Chandra was not part of a
conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. He was acting with the honest belief that
the family dispute was nothing more than a procedural arrangement between
family members. This is also evident from the email dated 17 September 2010 in
which Chandra reminded Jason Tan to give Dicky Tan the necessary approval for
him to sign the proposed settlement agreement that had been finalised between
the parties.[note: 1051]

496 I turn now to the minutes of the meeting on 1 October 2010 (see [114] and
[481] above) which recorded that Chandra had informed that Dicky Tan would not
be able to execute any documents in relation to PTIC as he had been “stripped
of his powers in PTIC by the other shareholders of PTIC”.[note: 1052] This
follows after Rajaram’s point that Chandra had on various occasions since 7
August 2010 informed that Dicky Tan required the consent of Jason Tan to sign
documents relating to PTIC.[note: 1053] Nava Bharat claims that this shows
that Chandra knew and was involved in Case No 1 as part of a conspiracy to
defraud Nava Bharat.[note: 1054] I do not agree. Chandra’s position is that
Nava Bharat had conflated two different matters in issue, _ie_ , the family
dispute and Case No 1.[note: 1055] Chandra knew about the family dispute. He
also knew that Dicky Tan and Ridwan Halim were the only shareholders of PTIC.
His evidence is that when Jason Tan informed him about the dispute involving
“other shareholders”, he took it at “face value” and understood him to mean
the family dispute involving the brothers.[note: 1056] Chandra further
explained that the email dated 17 September 2010, in which he asked for Jason
Tan’s approval for Dicky Tan to sign certain documents on behalf of PTIC,
stemmed from the family dispute which did not affect Dicky Tan’s shareholding
in PTIC.[note: 1057] Crucially, Chandra understood it to be a family dispute
which did not alter Dicky Tan’s legal right as a shareholder of PTIC.[note:
1058] I accept Chandra’s evidence.

497 Nevertheless, even if I assume that Nava Bharat was right and that the
minutes show that Chandra knew about Case No 1, I do not think that it would
have advanced Nava Bharat’s case. Nava Bharat must show that Chandra knew
about and was involved in Case No 1 which, it alleges, is a fraud perpetrated
by Jason Tan and/or Dicky Tan. Taken at its highest, and in light of the other
evidence (which suggests that Chandra did not know about Case No 1), the
minutes would only show that Chandra might have known about Case No 1 shortly
before 1 October 2010. At the point in time, the alleged fraud had already
been perpetrated. Furthermore, it does not show that Chandra knew that Case No
1 was a fraudulent manoeuvre by Dicky Tan and/or Jason Tan. Neither does it
show that Chandra was involved in it.

498 On the whole, it appears that Chandra understood the situation to be a
family dispute. In this regard, I do not think that Chandra knew about or was
involved in the alleged fraud perpetrated through Case No 1 just because he
was aware that there was a family dispute between the brothers. Such a view is
consistent with the correspondence.

499 For completeness, I find that there is insufficient evidence to show that
Chandra knew about or was involved in Case No 72 or Case No 98. For Case No
98, the evidence shows that Chandra was not involved in it. Nava Bharat had
not adduced any evidence to suggest otherwise. Instead, Bob Sundaram’s
evidence was that it did not look like Chandra was involved in the alleged
fraud perpetrated in Case No 98 by Dicky Tan and/or Jason Tan.[note: 1059] The
same applies to Case No 72.[note: 1060]

500 In light of the foregoing, I find that Nava Bharat has failed to establish
that Chandra knew about the alleged fraud that Dicky Tan and/or Jason Tan was
perpetrating in Indonesia _or_ that he was in any way involved in them.

(6) Privileged communications between Chandra, Dicky Tan and Jason Tan

501 At the start of the hearing, Ashwin stated under cross-examination that he
was of the belief that Chandra was aware of and hence a party to the alleged
fraud committed by Dicky Tan and/or Jason Tan by commencing Case No 1 to
deprive Nava Bharat of the shares in PTIC.[note: 1061] He added that he had no
evidence as privileged communications between Chandra, Dicky Tan and Jason Tan
were not disclosed.[note: 1062] Chandra was subsequently ordered on 2 October
2013 to disclose the privileged communications, and did so on 4 October
2013.[note: 1063] Notwithstanding the disclosure of the privileged
communications, Nava Bharat has been unable to point to any evidence to show
an agreement between the parties or a common intention between the parties to
defraud Nava Bharat. Not only is there no proverbial smoking gun, the evidence
appears to contradict Nava Bharat’s case that Chandra was a party to a
conspiracy to defraud it.

502 Nava Bharat further alleges that Chandra had not given full disclosure of
the privileged communications, and an adverse inference should be drawn
against Chandra.[note: 1064] Nava Bharat highlights that there are
“significant gaps in terms of time period” in the disclosed privileged
communications, and there is no reasonable explanation for the gaps.[note:
1065]

503 In response, Chandra’s position is that his style of practice did not
involve the keeping of attendance notes for meetings and telephone
calls.[note: 1066] He explained that his primary mode of communication with
Dicky Tan and Jason Tan was through telephone calls and face-to-face
meetings.[note: 1067] He would communicate with Jason Tan through emails
whenever he was not in Singapore.[note: 1068] He also testified that Dicky Tan
would seldom communicate with him by way of email because he was not tech-
savvy.[note: 1069] According to Chandra, this explains for the limited number
of emails.

504 I accept Chandra’s explanation. As I have mentioned earlier, the disclosed
privileged communications suggest that there is no conspiracy involving
Chandra to defraud Nava Bharat. There is nothing to suggest that the emails
were used as a front for the alleged conspiracy. If the emails were meant to
act as a veil of propriety, then there would not have been gaps in the
communications. In any case, Nava Bharat’s case is simply that Chandra had not
made full disclosure. I find it most unusual, if Nava Bharat is right, that
Chandra would have disclosed emails that _appear_ to be detrimental to his
case, _eg_ , the “defensive posture” email dated 6 January 2009 (see [461]
above) and the minutes dated 1 October 2010 (see [481] and [496] above). This
goes against Nava Bharat’s contention that Chandra had failed to give full
disclosure.

(7) Summary on Nava Bharat’s claim in unlawful means conspiracy

505 Nava Bharat’s case is that, notwithstanding the lack of direct evidence,
the objective facts would suffice to support an inference that Chandra knew
about and was involved in a conspiracy with Jason Tan and Dicky Tan to defraud
Nava Bharat. I do not find this to be the case. The evidence does not show
that Chandra knew or was involved in a conspiracy with Jason Tan and Dicky Tan
to defraud Nava Bharat. Neither do I consider it appropriate to draw an
adverse inference from the gaps in the disclosed privileged communications.
Accordingly, I find that Nava Bharat’s claim against Chandra for unlawful
means conspiracy must fail. Notwithstanding that, I shall proceed to consider
briefly the arguments raised by the parties on the issue of causation.

Causation

506 Chandra argues, as an alternative, that the losses suffered by Nava
Bharat, if any, were the result of the unilateral subsequent actions of Dicky
Tan and/or Jason Tan and thus not directly caused by the alleged
conspiracy.[note: 1070] The crux of the argument is that it was Case No 1 and
the consequences flowing therefrom that caused the losses allegedly suffered
by Nava Bharat. This is apparent from the line of questioning adopted by the
counsel for Chandra, Mr Ang Cheng Hock SC, when he was cross-examining Bob
Sundaram.[note: 1071] Not surprisingly, Bob Sundaram was reluctant to admit
that Case No 1 was the _sole_ cause, but eventually accepted that Nava Bharat
would have had control of the PTIC shares if not for the court order obtained
in Case No 1.[note: 1072]

507 I have some difficulties with Chandra’s alternative argument on causation.
The argument is based on the premise that Case No 1 is _not_ part of the
conspiracy. Nava Bharat’s case is that Case No 1 forms part of the conspiracy.
I have found against Nava Bharat on this point, but if I had agreed with Nava
Bharat, then Chandra’s alternative argument would have failed as well. In this
sense, it is not exactly an _alternative_ argument. In addition, some of the
alleged losses suffered by Nava Bharat do not result from Case No 1. For
instance, Nava Bharat had sought to recover, _inter alia_ , expenses incurred
in anticipation of commencing mining operations at the Mine.[note: 1073] Even
if I assume that there is a conspiracy but Case No 1 does not form part of it,
it does not mean that Nava Bharat would not be entitled to recover _any_ of
the alleged losses (if proven). Nevertheless, since I have found that Chandra
is not part of an alleged conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat, I need not decide
on this issue.

508 I will now turn to address the next claim against Chandra.

Claim against Chandra for negligence

509 Nava Bharat’s alternative claim is that Chandra has breached his duty of
care in negligence owed to Nava Bharat. It claims that Chandra owes a duty of
care because he had held himself out as looking after Nava Bharat’s interest
throughout his conduct of the Transaction.[note: 1074] According to Nava
Bharat, the duty of care was breached by Chandra because he allowed the
Transaction to proceed without the Forestry Licence and shut his eyes to the
risk that Jason Tan and Dicky Tan were perpetrating a fraud on Nava
Bharat.[note: 1075]

510 Chandra, on the other hand, denies that there was a duty of care owed to
Nava Bharat, and that in any case the alleged losses were neither caused by
Chandra nor foreseeable by him.[note: 1076]

Solicitor’s duty of care owed to a counterparty in a transaction

511 The present claim gives rise to the issue of whether a lawyer representing
a party to a transaction owes a duty of care to the counterparty in a
transaction. I will approach this issue in two parts, starting with proximity
followed by the policy considerations.

Proximity

512 While the Singapore courts have, on several occasions, examined the issue
of whether a lawyer owes a duty of care in negligence to a third party (see,
_eg_ , _AEL_ and _Anwar_), the circumstances in those cases are starkly
different from the facts of the present case.

513 The case of _Anwar_ involves the children of one Agus Anwar (“Agus”) suing
his solicitors for negligence. One of the issues was whether the solicitors
owed a duty of care to Agus’ children. In that case, Agus owed money to the
bank. After negotiations, the bank agreed to forbear from suing Agus if he
procured, _inter alia_ , further collateral including mortgages of properties
owned by his children. A forbearance agreement and related security documents
were signed. The bank initially wanted Agus’ children to be personally liable
for the loans but this was eventually dropped. Nevertheless, the personal
guarantee clause found its way into the security documents. Agus’ solicitors
did not point this out to Agus or his children. The bank eventually relied on
the personal guarantee clause to claim against Agus’ children. They settled
the claim with the bank and sued Agus’ solicitors for, _inter alia_ ,
negligence.

514 Having found that there was an _implied retainer_ between Agus’ solicitors
and his children, the Court of Appeal held at [145] that there is sufficient
proximity necessary to impose a duty of care. For the sake of argument,
however, the Court considered that there was sufficient proximity even if
there was _no_ implied retainer. It explained at [146] that:

… Where a solicitor's instructions from a client include or has as its
_effect_ the conferment of a benefit or negativing a detriment to a third
party, and the solicitor undertakes  _to the client_ to fulfil that
instruction, he would have brought himself into a direct relationship with the
third party, even if the latter may not have personal knowledge of the
transaction or the solicitor. [emphasis in original]

The Court found at [147]–[150] that there were “two levels of proximity at
play”, namely, the relational or circumstantial proximity and the causal
proximity. Furthermore, it appeared to have accepted at [154] that the
elements of control _and_ vulnerability were sufficient to satisfy the
proximity limb under the _Spandeck_ test. Notably, the Court of Appeal was
clearly reluctant to use the language of assumption of responsibility and
reliance to find proximity between the lawyer and the third party (at [155]
and [157]).

515 In _AEL_ , the plaintiffs were the intended beneficiaries of the
testator’s new will. The second defendant was the lawyer who drafted the new
will, which was intended to replace an earlier will. The new will turned out
to be defective, and the plaintiffs sued for negligence. Chan J allowed the
plaintiffs’ claim. The “nub of the dispute” was whether the second defendant
owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs. Guided by the Court of Appeal’s
decision in _Anwar_ (where the Court expressed its view on _White and another
v Jones v another_ [1995] 2 AC 207 in light of the _Spandeck_ test), Chan J
found that the plaintiffs and the second defendant were in a sufficiently
proximate relationship. He accepted at [84] that there was relational or
circumstantial proximity between the plaintiffs and the second defendant
because the latter knew that if the instructions from the testator were not
properly carried out, the economic well-being of the plaintiffs would be
adversely affected. In addition, like in _Anwar_ , Chan J found that there was
causal proximity between the plaintiffs and the second defendant on the basis
that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to the testator’s estate (which the testator
intended for them to receive) was wholly dependent on the effectiveness of the
new will. This was a task entrusted to the second defendant, and he knew that
if the new will was defective, then the plaintiffs would suffer loss.
Furthermore, Chan J found that the proximity between the plaintiffs and the
second defendant can also be established on the proximity factors of control
and vulnerability. In this respect, he said at [90] that:

... In that vein, I note that, as the solicitor responsible for preparing the
New Will, [the second defendant] is in complete control over whether the
plaintiffs do or do not receive their respective shares in the Testator’s
estate. This, in turn, means that the plaintiffs are wholly and inescapably
dependent on [the second defendant’s] proper discharge of his obligations to
the Testator to receive their respective entitlements. In my view, the
presence of “control” on the part of [the second defendant] and
“vulnerability” on the part of the plaintiffs serve to increase and strengthen
the links between them. This buttresses my earlier finding that there is
sufficient proximity in the present case.

516 Neither _Anwar_ nor _AEL_ address the issue that is before me, namely,
whether a lawyer acting for a party to the transaction owes a duty of care to
the counterparty to the transaction, as opposed to a “third-party associate of
the client” (see _Anwar_ at [71]) such as an intended beneficiary of a
testator (as in _AEL_) or a guarantor of a debtor (as in _Anwar_). In the
latter cases, the third party in question was not, figuratively speaking, on
the _other_ side of the fence. Neither was the third party represented by his
own lawyers and other advisers. In light of these crucial differences, I do
not think that it would be appropriate to say that the reasoning in _Anwar_ or
_AEL_ can be extended to apply to the facts of the present case.

517 In my view, there is and should be no rule that a lawyer owes or does not
owe a duty of care to third parties. It should ultimately depend on the facts
of the case. The question is whether there is sufficient proximity between the
lawyer and the third party for a duty of care to exist (assuming that there is
no policy consideration militating against the imposition of such a duty).

518 Before I turn to consider the facts, I would set out the general
observation that it may well be easier for proximity to be established in a
case where there is a commonality (as opposed to conflict) of interests
between the client and the third party in question. As I have mentioned
earlier, some of the local examples include the testator and the intended
beneficiaries of his will (see _AEL_) as well as the debtor and his guarantors
(see _Anwar_). The English cases provide some support for this view (see, _eg_
, _Clarke v Bruce Lance & Co (a firm) and others_ [1988] 1 WLR 881 (“ _Clarke_
”) at 888–890 and _Dean v Allin & Watts (a firm)_ [2001] PNLR 39 at [31]–[33]
and [38]–[40]).

519 I would also discuss two English cases which I have found to be
instructive. The first is _Memery Crystal v O’Higgins_ [1998] ECC 299 (“
_Memery Crystal_ ”). It concerned the funding for the production of a film.
The second defendant, Mr O’Halloran, was seeking to persuade the first
defendant, Mr O’Higgins, to fund the endeavour. Mr O’Halloran was represented
by Mr Westaway, a lawyer from the plaintiff law firm and Mr O’Higgins was
represented by the third defendant, Mr Snelling. Mr Westaway was “a lawyer who
for most of his professional life has specialised in the field of
entertainment and who was very familiar with the film industry” (at [6]). On
the other hand, Mr Snelling had “no expertise in this field” (at [9]) and this
was made known to Mr Westaway. For the present purposes, I am only concerned
with the counterclaim by the first defendant against the plaintiff for
negligence. Bathurst-Norman, sitting as a High Court Judge, opined (at [26])
that “under normal circumstances a solicitor is bound to do all that he
properly can for his client and does not owe a duty of care to anyone who is
not his client”, but noted (at [27]) the exception “where a solicitor
voluntarily assumes a duty of care towards a third party, for instance, by
answering a question or tendering advice where he knows that that answer or
advice will be relied upon by the third party”. On the facts, the judge found
(at [29]) that:

… Mr Westaway’s sole duty was to Mr O’Halloran. A solicitor in these
circumstances, where he could be held to owe a duty to a third party, would be
in an impossible position. He would have to risk either complying with his
client’s instructions if they did not accord with the agreement or breaching
his client's privilege if the client decided that he did not want the other
side informed of anything by informing them of the precise nature of his
instructions by revealing those instructions to the third party.

He also considered (at [33]) that:

… I believe, however, the true principle applicable to this case, where each
of the principals, Mr O’Higgins and Mr O’Halloran, has a solicitor acting for
him, is to be found in the judgment in _Allied Finance v Haddow_ where Cooke
J. puts the matter in this way:

Applying the principles to the present case, I agree with Pritchard J. that
the relationship between two solicitors acting for their respective clients
does not normally of itself impose a duty of care on one solicitor to the
client of the other. _Normally the relationship is not sufficiently proximate.
Each solicitor is entitled to expect the other party will look to his own
solicitor for advice and protection_. Lord Roskill says in _Junior Brooks_ at
page 214. ‘The concept of proximity must always involve, at least in most
cases, some degree of reliance.’ Lord Roskill illustrates this by citing
observations in the Hedley Byrne case [1964] A.C. 465, and he attaches
importance to where ‘the real reliance was placed’. And even if prima facie
there were sufficient proximity for a duty of care, the consideration that the
other party has a solicitor to protect his interests would normally negative a
duty. That is to say, the second of Lord Wilberforce’s questions in _Anns v.
Merton London Borough Council_ [1978] A.C. 728, at page 752, would have to be
answered against the duty even if the first was not.

In circumstances such as these I believe that the law is slow to import a duty
of care on a solicitor to a third party _where the third party has his own
solicitor acting for him and where the matter concerned is potentially a
contentious matter_. ...

[emphasis added]

520 The next case is _BDG Roof-Bond Ltd (in liquidation) v Douglas and others_
[2000] BCC 770. The plaintiff was a company with two equal shareholders, one
of whom was the first defendant, Mr Douglas. The relationship between the
shareholders soured and Mr Douglas decided to sell his shares to the other
shareholder, Mr Bailey. It was decided that the transaction would take the
form of an own-shares purchase (_ie_ , where the company buys its own shares),
but the transaction failed to take place due to the non-compliance with
statutory requirements. One of the questions was whether the second defendant,
Dunn & Baker, the law firm representing Mr Douglas in the transaction, owed a
duty of care to the plaintiff. Park J held that it did not. He made the
preliminary observation at 785 that there is an extensive body of case law in
England which has developed around “situations in which someone who has
suffered loss in a transaction seeks to recover his loss by suing a
professional adviser who was not his own (the claimant’s) adviser but rather
was the adviser of another party”, and noted that the “general trend of the
cases is to be reluctant to find that a professional adviser owes a common law
duty to someone who is not his own client” (at 786). On the question of
proximity, he was of the view that there was no sufficient proximate
relationship between the plaintiff company and the second defendant because
the plaintiff was on the _opposite side of the transaction_ from the second
defendant’s client (_ie_ , the first defendant). It is noteworthy that Park J
found at 787 that the second defendant had not assumed responsibility to the
plaintiff and the plaintiff had _not_ relied on the advice of the second
defendant.

521 Having considered the above authorities, and bearing in mind the universal
two-stage test laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Spandeck_ , I am of the
view that the commonality of interests between the client of the lawyer and
the third party in question is not _per se_ a determinative factor as to
whether there is sufficient proximity between the lawyer to the third party
for the imposition of a duty of care. However, the fact that there is a
conflict of interest between the client and the third party, especially in
cases where they are on opposite sides of a transaction, would generally
indicate a lack of proximity. This is because in cases where the client and
the third party are on _opposite_ sides of the transaction (in the sense that
their interests may conflict), it would ordinarily be difficult to find that
there has been voluntarily assumption of responsibility and reliance or
control and vulnerability such as to satisfy the proximity limb of the
_Spandeck_ test. In this regard, I find the view expressed in Hugh Evans,
_Lawyers’ Liabilities_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2002) at para 2-05 to be
helpful:

As a result of the potential conflict of interest in most cases, it will be
uncommon for a solicitor to wish or intend to assume any general
responsibility to the other side, and rare for the other side to be able to
consider reasonably that he has done so. In general, it may only be reasonable
to conclude that there has been an assumption of responsibility if:

(1) the circumstances suggest that the words or acts of the solicitor are
intended to benefit the other side; and

(2) there is no or no obvious conflict with his duties to his client; or

(3) the circumstances make it apparent that the solicitor’s client has
expressly or impliedly waived any obligation to himself where there may be a
conflict.

Notably, this view appears to be consistent with the position taken in _Anwar_
at [146] (see [514] above).

522 I come back to the question of whether there is sufficient proximity
between Nava Bharat and Chandra in the present case.

523 At this juncture, I find it appropriate to consider Nava Bharat’s
reference to _Lee Siew Chun v Sourgrapes Packaging Products Trading Pte Ltd
and others_ [1992] 3 SLR(R) 855 (“ _Lee Siew Chun_ ”). In that case, Michael
Hwang JC observed at [85] that he preferred the New Zealand case of _Allied
Finance and Investments Ltd v Haddow & Co_ [1983] NZLR 22 (“ _Allied Finance_
”) over the English case of _Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff (Group) Ltd and
others_ [1992] Ch 560 (“ _Gran Gelato_ ”). Nava Bharat cites _Lee Siew Chun_
presumably because _Gran Gelato_ is generally referred to as the leading
English case for the proposition that no duty is owed to the counterparty in a
non-contentious transaction (see _Jackson & Powell_ at para 11-061). In that
case, the first defendant sold an underlease to the plaintiff. Both parties
were separately represented by lawyers for the transaction. The plaintiff’s
lawyer sent enquiries before the contract was concluded, and this included an
enquiry on whether there were any rights affecting the superior leases which
would inhibit the enjoyment of the underlease. The first defendant’s lawyer
(also the second defendant) replied “[n]ot to the lessor’s knowledge” (at
565). This turned out to be untrue. Sir Donald Nicholls VC found that the
second defendant was not liable for misrepresentation. He considered at 570
that:

In my view, in normal conveyancing transactions solicitors who are acting for
a seller do not in general owe to the would-be buyer a duty of care when
answering inquiries before contract or the like. ...

He considered that the answers were given on behalf of the seller, and that
the law provides the buyer with a remedy against the seller in respect of any
misrepresentation in the answers given on his behalf. In this respect, he
found that there is no good reason for the law to impose a duty of care “when
the agent already owes to his principal a duty which covers the same ground
and the principal is responsible to the third party for his agent’s
shortcomings” (at 571).

524 The case of _Allied Finance_ appears, at least to Hwang JC, to be
inconsistent with _Gran Gelato_. The plaintiffs in _Allied Finance_ lent money
to Hill on the security of a yacht which he was buying. The yacht was in fact
bought by a company owned and controlled by Hill. Hill’s lawyers wrote to the
plaintiffs before the transaction and stated that they certify “that the
Instrument by way of Security is fully binding on Roger Kenneth Hill” and “on
behalf of our client, that there are no other charges whatsoever on the yacht”
(at 23). The letter did not disclose that Hill was not buying the yacht in his
own name. The English Court of Appeal accepted that the lawyers owed a duty of
care to the plaintiffs. Cooke J considered at 24 that:

… I agree ... that the relationship between two solicitors acting for their
respective clients does not normally of itself impose a duty of care on one
solicitor to the client of the other ...

But surely the result of the established principles is different when on
request a solicitor gives a certificate on which the other party must
naturally be expected to act. That is a classic duty of care situation ...

525 The learned editors of _Jackson & Powell_ at paras 11-063-11-064
distinguish _Gran Gelato_ and _Allied Finance_ on the basis that the latter is
an exception to the general rule in _Gran Gelato_ given that there was
reasonable reliance in _Allied Finance._

526 It is not necessary for me to decide if _Gran Gelato_ or _Allied Finance_
should be preferred, for both cases must now be considered in light of the
universal test laid down in _Spandeck_. I would only observe that the Court of
Appeal in _Spandeck_ accepted at [81] that the twin criteria of voluntary
assumption of responsibility _and_ reliance are “two different (yet
inextricably connected) sides of the same coin”.

527 As I have alluded to earlier (see [509] above), Nava Bharat contends that
Chandra had “held himself out” as looking after Nava Bharat’s interest
throughout his conduct of the Transaction. In this regard, it alleges that:

(a) Chandra was the person who “brought the deal to the table” as he put the
potential deal to Bhushan who, in turn, approached Nava Bharat.[note: 1077]

(b) Chandra presented the potential deal to Nava Bharat (before Rajaram and
ABNR were appointed), including advising it on the relevant features of the
Transaction _and_ vouching for Dicky Tan “as a client, a friend and a
reputable businessman”.[note: 1078]

(c) Chandra represented to Nava Bharat that it could obtain equity interest in
the Mine _via_ a nominee arrangement.[note: 1079]

(d) Chandra was involved in the appointment of Rajaram and ABNR as the lawyers
for Nava Bharat.[note: 1080]

(e) Chandra was running the Transaction as a whole, and Rajaram and ABNR were
merely assisting him.[note: 1081]

(f) Chandra engaged in direct communication with Bhushan and Ashwin on various
matters relating to the Transaction.[note: 1082]

528 In my view, the facts do not support Nava Bharat’s contention that there
is a sufficiently proximate relationship between Chandra and Nava Bharat.

529 I have earlier mentioned the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of
responsibility and reliance which are well recognised as “essential factors in
meeting the test of proximity” (_Spandeck_ at [81]). It is also useful to
recall that the Court of Appeal in _Anwar_ had accepted that control and
vulnerability may, where the facts support them, form the essential factors in
meeting the test of proximity. These proximity factors assist the court in
determining whether there is sufficient proximity between the parties such
that a duty of care ought to be imposed. How then should one decide which
proximity factors would be relevant in any particular case? The answer, I
think, is simple: it depends on the facts (see _Spandeck_ at [81], where the
Court of Appeal referred to the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of
responsibility and reliance as capable of meeting the test of proximity “where
the facts support them”). I would only observe that in relying on these
factors in finding proximity, one should not lose sight of the purpose of the
inquiry, _ie_ , whether there is sufficient proximity for a duty of care to
arise on the part of one party _vis-à-vis_ the other (see _Spandeck_ at [77]).

530 For a start, I am not persuaded that a lawyer acting for a party to the
transaction should, without more, be considered as having assumed
responsibility to the other party to the transaction simply because that other
party is unrepresented. On the facts of the present case, I find that Chandra
was _not_ advising Nava Bharat prior to the appointment of Rajaram and ABNR.
It was apparent that Chandra was putting forward his client’s proposal to Nava
Bharat and it was fully entitled to take it back and consult its own lawyers
(which it did). It would be a complete and disingenuous mischaracterisation of
the facts to claim that Chandra was _advising_ all parties (including Nava
Bharat) on the way to proceed with the Transaction. It may well be open to
Nava Bharat to consider and agree with Dicky Tan’s proposal (which was
conveyed through Chandra) but that does not make it an advice upon which Nava
Bharat was expected to rely on. This brings us to the next point, that is,
Nava Bharat could not be said to have relied on Chandra for advice on matters
of Indonesian law. At that point in time, Ashwin knew that legal advice as
regards the structure of the Transaction and due diligence must be done by an
Indonesian law firm. This is apparent from his email to Rajaram on 6 October
2008 (see [19] above) where he acknowledged the importance of engaging
Indonesian counsel to perform legal due diligence. Indeed, it would have been
most unusual for Nava Bharat to engage Rajaram and ABNR to represent it for
the purpose of the Transaction if it had genuinely considered that Chandra was
acting on behalf of all parties (and thus relied on him).

531 The position became even clearer after Rajaram and ABNR were appointed to
represent Nava Bharat for the purpose of the Transaction. There is nothing on
the evidence to show that Chandra had given any advice which was intended to
be relied on by Nava Bharat. The matters which Chandra had to convey to Nava
Bharat on behalf of his client, Dicky Tan, as well as any communication
between the lawyers for the purpose of the Transaction cannot reasonably be
considered as advice. Indeed the nature and context of the communication
between Chandra and Nava Bharat clearly revealed that there was no assumption
of responsibility on the part of Chandra or reliance on the part of Nava
Bharat.

532 It was also pertinent that Ashwin knew all along that Chandra was acting
for Dicky Tan, the counterparty to the Transaction and could not therefore
rely on him for advice. This was acknowledged during the cross-
examination:[note: 1083]

Q:Right. So you knew from the start that Dicky Tan’s lawyers will be acting
for Dicky Tan, right?

A:Yes, your Honour, they would be acting for Dicky Tan, that’s the definition,
yes.

Q:Yes. And Dicky Tan’s lawyers, you can’t rely on them because whatever they
come up with has to be reviewed by your own legal experts, correct?

A:I cannot rely solely on them, your Honour, yes.

...

Q:Whatever Dicky Tan’s lawyers say as to the structure or how the deal would
proceed, you’ve got to double-check that with your own lawyers, correct?

A:Yes, your Honour.

533 In this regard, I find the Canadian case of _Patriquin v Laurentian Trust
of Canada Inc_ (2002) 96 BCLR (3d) 318 (“ _Patriquin_ ”) to be instructive.
The case involves a mortgage transaction as a result of which Mr Patriquin,
the plaintiff, suffered losses. Mr Patriquin sued the counterparty’s lawyer,
Mr Jackie. Mr Patriquin was represented by his own lawyer, Mr Hara. One of the
issues that the British Columbia Court of Appeal had to decide was whether Mr
Jackie owed a duty of care to Mr Patriquin. It held that there was no duty of
care owed by Mr Jackie to Mr Patriquin. The Court of appeal agreed with the
trial judge that no relationship of proximity existed between Mr Jackie and Mr
Patriquin because it was “clear to everyone” that Mr Jackie was _not_ assuming
any responsibility for the plaintiff. The critical fact was that Mr Patriquin
had retained Mr Hara in connection with the transaction. As such, it would
have been Mr Hara’s responsibility to advice Mr Patriquin.

534 In the same vein, I find the English decision of _Memery Crystal_ , which
I have discussed earlier at [519] above, to be pertinent. As in _Patriquin_ ,
the judge accepted the view of Cooke J in _Allied Finance_ where he said that
“[e]ach solicitor is entitled to expect that the other party will look to his
own solicitor for advice and protection” (at 24).

535 On the facts of the present case, I find that it was undoubtedly clear to
everyone, including Ashwin (see [532] above), that both parties to the
Transaction (_ie_ , Nava Bharat and Dicky Tan) were represented by their
respective lawyers. Chandra was entitled to expect that Nava Bharat would look
to Rajaram and ABNR for advice and to protect its interests in the
Transaction.

536 It is noteworthy that the Court of Appeal in _Anwar_ was reluctant to find
that the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance
were present between a lawyer and the third party (at [71] and [155]–[162]).
The Court of Appeal succinctly observed at [71] that:

... it would be pushing the boundaries of sensible argument to suggest that a
solicitor in advising his client, with such advice potentially being of
benefit to a third-party associate of the client, had undertaken to  _that
third party_ a responsibility to take care in the giving of his advice.
Similarly, it would strain the realm of reasonableness to argue that such a
third party who might have been ignorant of the solicitor’s existence (as was
the case in  _White_) had  _in fact_ relied on the solicitor’s exercise of due
care and skill in advising his client. … [emphasis in original]

537 In my opinion, it would be equally preposterous to suggest, in a case
where both parties to a transaction are represented by their own lawyers, that
there can ordinarily be assumption of responsibility and reliance between the
lawyer and the _other_ party to the transaction.

538 I turn next to the question of whether Nava Bharat has shown that the
proximity limb of the _Spandeck_ test has been satisfied on the basis of
control and vulnerability. As I have mentioned earlier, both control and
vulnerability have been considered in _Anwar_ and _AEL_ as essential factors
for finding proximity under the _Spandeck_ test.

539 In David Tan and Goh Yihan, “The Promise of Universality - the Spandeck
Formulation Half a Decade on” (2013) 25 SAcLJ 510 (“ _Tan & Goh_”) at para 33,
the learned authors explained that:

Control is often discussed in relation to the defendant’s control over the
source of the risk of harm to the claimant or a class of individuals of which
the claimant is a member. ... The _capacity_ of the defendant to control the
situation that might give risk to the risk of harm is a critical
consideration. ... Nonetheless, the capacity of the defendant to control or
the actual control exercised by the defendant over the risk of harm of the
claimant may not of itself be sufficient to establish a _prima facie_ duty,
and control has to be assessed in the light of other proximity factors. For
example, the greater the degree of exclusive control over the risk of harm by
the defendant may indicate a corresponding increased vulnerability on the part
of the claimant. ...

[emphasis in original]

540 They also considered at paras 34–35 that:

... It is important to note that vulnerability is usually considered with the
element of control. ...

In _Woolcock Street Investments v CDG Pty Ltd_ (“ _Woolcock_ ”), a case
involving economic loss as a consequence of structural distress to a building,
the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ held that
vulnerability is “to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff’s inability
to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant’s want of reasonable
care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences
of loss on the defendant”. ...

541 The decision of the High Court of Australia in _Woolcock Street
Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd and another_ (2004) 216 CLR 515 is
instructive on the meaning of “vulnerability” in the context of determining if
there is sufficient proximity to impose a duty of care. In that case, the
plaintiff was a purchaser of a commercial building that had latent defects.
The plaintiff could have appointed experts to inspect the building for
defects, but did not do so. The High Court of Australia took the view that a
party who is ordinarily in a position to protect itself but chooses not to do
so should not be treated as vulnerable. The observations of the Court at
[31]–[32] and [110] are pertinent and I set them out below:

31 Neither the facts alleged in the statement of claim nor those set out in
the case stated show that the appellant was, in any relevant sense, vulnerable
to the economic consequences of any negligence of the respondents in their
design of the foundations for the building. _Those facts do not show that the
appellant could not have protected itself against the economic loss it alleges
it has suffered_. ...

32 It may be accepted that the appellant bought the building not knowing that
the foundations were inadequate. It is not alleged or agreed, however, that
the defects of which complaint now is made could not have been discovered. ...
That the defects now alleged were not discovered by a local authority asked to
certify whether the building was “a ruin or so far dilapidated as to be unfit
for use or occupation or [was] ... in a structural condition prejudicial to
the inhabitants of or to property in the neighbourhood” says nothing about
what other investigations might have been undertaken or might have revealed.

...

110 But the most powerful reason for rejecting the proposed duty is that _the
first owners and purchasers of commercial buildings are ordinarily in a
position to protect themselves from most losses that are likely to occur from
defects in the construction of such buildings_. Occasionally, a commercial
building may be built or bought for an emotional rather than an economic
reason. But in the overwhelming number of cases, commercial buildings are
constructed or bought to make money. A commercial building is constructed or
bought because it is perceived to be a suitable vehicle for investment. The
prudent first owner or purchaser of such a building will compare the likely
return on the capital investment with the potential risks including falls in
the value of the building that may result from various factors, economic,
social and physical. And no prudent purchaser would contemplate buying a
building without determining whether it has existing or potential construction
defects. Knowledge of its defects, actual or potential, is central to any
evaluation of its worth as an investment. _In so far as risks are uncertain or
unknown, the prudent purchaser will factor the risk into the price or obtain
contractual protections or, if necessary, walk away from the negotiations._

[emphasis added]

542 On the present facts, I find that Nava Bharat had not shown that Chandra
was in control over the _source_ of the risk of harm to Nava Bharat. For the
present claim, Nava Bharat’s allegations relate primarily to the alleged fraud
perpetrated by Dicky Tan and Jason Tan.[note: 1084] In other words, the source
of the risk of harm to Nava Bharat must have been the fraudulent conduct of
Dicky Tan and Jason Tan. In this regard, there certainly can be no control on
the part of Chandra given that I have earlier found that he neither knew nor
was involved in any alleged conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. To be complete,
I should mention that I do not accept that Chandra was in control of the
manner in which the Transaction was structured – insofar as Nava Bharat is
_also_ suggesting that it was the source of the risk of harm.[note: 1085] This
is not a case where Chandra was, on his own, dictating the terms or the
structure of the Transaction. On the contrary, Nava Bharat was fully involved
(with the advice from its own lawyers and other advisors) throughout the
entire period and _consented_ to the terms and structure of the Transaction.
In this regard, and this is an example of how control and vulnerability are
often intertwined and can likewise be fairly said to be “two different (yet
inextricably connected) sides of the same coin” (Andrew Phang, Saw Cheng Lim &
Gary Chan, “Of Precedent, Theory and Practice - The Case for a Return to Anns”
[2006] SJLS 1 at 47, cited in approval in _Spandeck_ at [81]), I find that
there is no vulnerability on the part of Nava Bharat. Indeed, it can hardly be
considered as a party who could not have protected itself against the losses
that it has allegedly suffered. Like most parties to a commercial transaction,
Nava Bharat was well-placed to protect itself from losses that are likely to
occur if the Transaction went awry. Not surprisingly, Nava Bharat had taken
steps to protect itself against the risks involved in the Transaction,
including the appointment of legal counsel (_ie_ , Rajaram and ABNR) as well
as consultations with Bob Sundaram and Nava Bharat’s Indonesian team. It
follows that there can be neither control on the part of Chandra nor
vulnerability on the part of Nava Bharat.

543 At this point, I pause to note that while the Court of Appeal in _Anwar_
relied primarily on relational or circumstantial proximity and causal
proximity in determining if the proximity limb of the _Spandeck_ test has been
satisfied (and this has been followed by Chan J in _AEL_), this approach has
drawn some criticisms (see David Tan, “Debunking a Myth: A Rejection of the
‘Assumption of Responsibility’ Test for Duty of Care” (2014) 22 Torts Law
Journal 183 at 192. In particular, Assoc Prof Tan opines at 192 and 194 that:

The reference to ‘physical, circumstantial and causal proximity’ as a
yardstick for determining legal proximity can be confusing and perhaps courts
should avoid using these terms but focus instead on five factual situational
factors. Circumstantial proximity requires an examination of the relationship
between the parties in dispute, which further entails a closer analysis of the
presence or absence of certain elements in that relationship. The phrase
appears to be used interchangeably with ‘relational proximity’. Causal
proximity tends to be broadly defined and seems to overlap with notions of
factual foreseeability of ‘knock-on effects’ and causation. In many novel
situations, the content of proximity can be elucidated by a set of non-
exhaustive enumerated factors which can have _universal_ application to
different factual scenarios, without the need to invoke the terms
‘circumstantial proximity’ or ‘causal proximity’.

...

... the repeated invocation of the notion of ‘physical, circumstantial and
causal proximity’ as _factors_ can be confusing. **_With respect, these are
concepts rather than factors._** For example, the presence of factors like
assumption of responsibility, reliance, control and vulnerability in the
interaction between doctor and patient results in a relational closeness or
circumstantial proximity. In a defective will scenario, a solicitor knows of
the consequences of an improperly executed will, has control over the valid
execution of a will and the inability of the intended beneficiaries to take
precautions renders them vulnerable; thus there is causal proximity in the
sense that a defective will would inevitably lead to the economic loss
suffered by the intended beneficiaries. _The notion of ‘physical,
circumstantial and causal proximity’ is an indeterminate reference_ , and it
is unsurprising that the High Court of Australia has unequivocally renounced
it in favour of the salient features approach. While this methodology of
commingling of factual and normative features has been criticised, it obviates
the use of labels like ‘circumstantial’, ‘relational’ and ‘causal’ proximity
and more transparently presents a list of factual factors for judicial
examination.

[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold italics added]

544 In this regard, it is apposite to note that the Court of Appeal in _Anwar_
, having expressed its views in relation to circumstantial proximity and
causal proximity, observed that the learned authors in _Tan & Goh_ have in
mind the “same idea, albeit under a different label” when they discuss
“control” and “vulnerability” as essential factors for satisfying proximity
(see _Anwar_ at [147]–[154]). Similarly, the discussion by Chan J in _AEL_ at
[84]–[85] on circumstantial proximity and causal proximity, in essence,
reflects the proximity factors of control and vulnerability (as well as the
knowledge thereof (see also _Anwar_ at [148])):

84 First, I find that there is relational or circumstantial proximity between
the plaintiffs and Cheo. This is not merely because of the nature of the
Testator's instructions but also because Cheo  _knew_ full well at that time
that _if those instructions were not properly carried out, the economic well-
being of the plaintiffs would be adversely affected_. The plaintiffs are
therefore clearly in Cheo's direct contemplation even though he has no direct
interaction with them (save for AEL). In this connection, I note that Megarry
VC has also stated in  _[Ross v Caunters [1980] Ch 297 at 308F-H]_ that the
question of whether a negligent solicitor “ought” to have had the disappointed
beneficiaries in his contemplation does not even arise in cases such as this.
This is because the solicitor’s contemplation of the beneficiaries is of such
a close and immediate nature; it is “ _contemplation by contract_ ” [emphasis
added] though that contract was with the testator client. Therefore, it is
this degree of knowledge which Cheo has of the plaintiffs and the surrounding
circumstances which leaves me in no doubt that there is relational or
circumstantial proximity between the parties.

85 I also find that there is causal proximity between Cheo and the plaintiffs.
_The plaintiffs’ entitlement to the Testator’s estate, in the shares which the
Testator intended for them to receive, is wholly dependent on the New Will
being effective_. That task of making an effective will, in turn, was
entrusted by the Testator to Cheo. It must thus have been plain to Cheo that
if the New Will was defective, then that will lead inevitably, upon the death
of the Testator, to economic loss suffered by the plaintiffs. Accordingly,
causal proximity between the plaintiffs and Cheo is clearly evident.

[emphasis added]

545 On the facts of the present case, it suffices for me to say that, having
found that there is neither assumption of responsibility and reliance nor
control and vulnerability between Chandra and Nava Bharat, there is likewise
insufficient relational, circumstantial or causal proximity.

546 In light of the finding that there is insufficient proximity, Nava
Bharat’s claim against Chandra in negligence must fail. Nevertheless, I
proceed to consider if there are any policy considerations that would militate
against the imposition of a duty of care.

Policy considerations

547 Chandra contends, as an alternative, that there are strong reasons against
the imposition of a duty of care on the present circumstances. He raises three
main points, namely, that there would be an “indeterminate extension of third
party liability in cross-border transaction with a Singapore element”,[note:
1086] that it is “unfair and unjust” for a lawyer to owe a duty of care to a
third party in a case where the third party had failed to take reasonable care
of itself,[note: 1087] and that there is adequate alternative remedy available
to the third party (or in other words, there might be double recovery by the
third party).[note: 1088] In response, Nava Bharat claims that there is no
concern with indeterminacy of liability given the “peculiar facts” of the
present case.[note: 1089]

548 The Court of Appeal in _Spandeck_ explained at [85] that the second stage
of the test concerns the consideration of pertinent and relevant policy
considerations which involve “value judgments which reflect differential
weighing and balancing of competing moral claims and broad social welfare
goals”. As observed by the learned authors in _Tan & Goh_ at para 37:

At this stage, the court is expected to evaluate the anticipated impact of a
holding of a duty of care upon a diverse range of legal persons, including
persons who will, in future, occupy positions similar to the claimant and
defendant, and those who will be indirectly affected by the rule applicable as
between the present parties in dispute.

549 The focus of the policy limb under the _Spandeck_ test is therefore
predominantly concerned with the _potential_ individuals (as opposed to the
actual parties before it) who might be affected by the court’s decision in the
future. This is also explained in Christian Witting, “Duty of Care: An
Analytical Approach” (2005) 25 OJLS 33 at 38:

The policy ‘test’ is concerned with the imposition of appropriate norms rather
than with the evaluation of factual states ... the focus of the policy test
_need not_ be upon the claimant and the defendant. Indeed, courts ordinarily
are not concerned with the policy implications of recognizing a duty of care
as between any particular claimant and defendant. Their concern is with the
potential impact that the recognition of a duty might have upon a number (if
not innumerable) parties who are _not before the court_. The courts might
consider the potential impact upon parties who will, in the future, occupy
positions similar to those of the claimant and/or defendant. … [emphasis in
original]

550 With this in mind, I turn to consider the specific arguments raised by the
parties.

551 The concern with indeterminate liability has been acknowledged in
Singapore as a relevant policy consideration that might negate the imposition
of a duty of care by the Court of Appeal in _Spandeck_ at [73]. The question,
however, is whether such a concern is a valid one on the present
circumstances.

552 In _Clarke_ , the English Court of Appeal was reluctant to impose a duty
of care on the defendant solicitor on the basis that doing so might impose
indeterminate liability on other solicitors in similar position in the future.
Balcombe LJ said at 889 that:

If the defendants were under a liability to a potential beneficiary of the
property, it cannot have been to the plaintiff alone. As a matter of logic,
the plaintiff, at the time of the grant of the option, was in no different a
position _vis-à-vis_ the defendants than anyone to whom the testator might
have given the property during his lifetime, or to whom it might pass under
his will or intestacy. So if the defendants owed a duty to anyone other than
their client, the testator, it must have been to the whole of this
indeterminate class of potential donees or beneficiaries. It would indeed have
exposed them “to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate
time to an indeterminate class”.

553 In the present case, I understand Chandra to be saying that _if_ proximity
can be established between a lawyer and a counterparty in the transaction on
the present circumstances, then there would be a risk that there might be an
indeterminate extension of third party liability in future similar cases. I
have earlier found that Nava Bharat had failed to establish proximity. For the
sake of argument, however, I would assume that Chandra did hold himself out as
working towards a win-win situation for the mutual benefit of all parties
(albeit without _any_ specific representation or advice upon which Nava Bharat
relied upon), and at the same time bear in mind that Nava Bharat is on the
other side of the Transaction and represented by its own lawyers. If a lawyer
owes a duty of care to anyone who has an interest in the transaction, other
than his client, simply because the lawyer demonstrates that he is moving the
transaction towards completion, then it would be near impossible to limit
liability from extending indiscriminately to any _other_ third party whose
interest might potentially be affected by the transaction. Accordingly, I am
of the view that the policy consideration against indeterminate liability must
operate to militate against the imposition of a duty of care.

554 Chandra also argues that it is unfair and unjust to impose a duty of care
on him _vis-à-vis_ Nava Bharat where it had the primary duty or responsibility
of verifying or checking all aspects of the Transaction.[note: 1090] In this
respect, Chandra cites the English Court of Appeal decision of _Philcox v
Civil Aviation Authority_ , The Times, 8 June 1995 (transcript available on
LexisNexis).[note: 1091] The case concerned a claim in negligence brought
against the Civil Aviation Authority for the failure to inspect an aircraft
properly and in issuing a Certificate of Airworthiness. The Civil Aviation
Authority was required under statute to issue a Certificate of Airworthiness
(which is a mandatory requirement before an aircraft can fly) if it is
satisfied that the aircraft is “fit to fly” having regard to a list of
matters. A certificate was issued for an aircraft, but the aircraft which was
piloted by the plaintiff crashed. Staughton LJ held, _inter alia_ , that it
would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty of care on the Civil
Aviation Authority “to inform [the plaintiff] if it were the case that he had
not carried out his _primary duty_ of maintaining his own aircraft properly”
[emphasis added]. Similarly, Millett LJ considered that:

The owners and operators of the aircraft are not within the class of persons
for whose protection the scheme has been established; they are the persons
against whose imprudent activities the scheme is designed to protect the
public. They are not entitled to rely on the issue of the certificate to
exonerate them from their own responsibility to ensure that their aircraft are
fit to fly.

It follows that the test of proximity is not satisfied. It would also follow
that it would be unjust and unreasonable to impose a duty of care on the
defendant to protect the owner of the aircraft for his _own failure to
maintain it and protect it from unworthy condition._ But I prefer to rest my
decision on the fact that the statutory scheme brings into existence a
relationship which does not satisfy the proximity test for the purposes of the
test of negligence.

[emphasis added]

555 Chandra submits that it would not be fair or just to impose a duty of care
when the alleged losses resulted entirely from Nava Bharat’s own failure to
ensure that the Transaction was genuine and legitimate.[note: 1092] On my
part, and bearing in mind the distinction between the nature of the proximity
and policy limbs of the _Spandeck_ test (see [548]–[549] above), I agree with
Millett LJ that the better view is to consider that there is insufficient
proximity to justify the imposition of a duty of care.

556 Chandra further argues that there is adequate alternative remedy available
to the third party or, put differently, a risk of double recovery. The concern
with double recovery often features in cases relating to defective wills – the
question is whether the estate _or_ the disappointed beneficiaries should be
entitled to sue for the wrongdoing of the lawyer in relation to the defective
will (see _Jackson & Powell_ at paras 11-056 to 11-057). It was also one of
the factors expressed by the Court of Appeal in _Clarke_ in support of its
conclusion that there should be no duty of care owed by the lawyer of the
testator to the potential beneficiary to advise that the testator was acting
in a manner which might be adverse to his interest. Specifically, Balcombe LJ
explained at 889 that:

This is not a case where, if the plaintiff has no cause of action in
negligence, there is no other effective remedy. If the defendants were
negligent in failing to advise the testator that the grant of the option was
an improvident act, then he during his lifetime had, and his personal
representatives after his death have (subject to any limitation period), a
cause of action against them. (If the personal representatives are unwilling
to institute proceedings against the defendants the plaintiff, as a
beneficiary under the will, has his remedy.) If the plaintiff has also a cause
of action in tort, then the defendants are at risk of having to pay damages
twice over, since any damages awarded to the estate would not enure to the
benefit of the plaintiff as a specific devisee, unless he were also the
general residuary beneficiary. ...

557 On the present facts, I appreciate that, for the alleged losses that it
had suffered as a result of the Transaction, Nava Bharat is not only suing its
own lawyer, Rajaram but also the counterparty to the Transaction, Dicky Tan
(in Singapore and Indonesia (see [135]–[136] above)) as well as his lawyer,
Chandra. However, I do not think that the mere fact that Nava Bharat is suing
multiple parties for the same alleged losses would, _per se_ , suffice as a
reason for refusing to impose a duty of care on one or more of those parties.
Unlike the situation discussed in _Jackson & Powell_ as well as _Clarke_
(namely, that the _same_ wrongdoing by the lawyer led to losses suffered by
two possible parties – the estate of the testator _and_ the intended
beneficiaries – for which the losses may not always coincide), the present
case involves _distinct_ wrongdoings by various alleged wrongdoers (including
lawyers acting for both parties and Dicky Tan) which led to the same alleged
losses suffered by Nava Bharat. In my view, there is no good policy reason why
Nava Bharat should be prevented from suing for each and every wrongdoing,
albeit recovering no more than the losses that it had suffered.

Causation

558 For completeness, I shall proceed to consider the issue of causation.

559 Like in S 846/2011, Nava Bharat contends that the evidential burden is on
Chandra insofar as he is arguing that Nava Bharat’s losses arose independently
of the alleged conspiracy or negligence.[note: 1093] For the reasons that I
have stated earlier (see [367]–[372] above), I find that Nava Bharat must
adduce some evidence to show that the losses suffered were caused by the
alleged conspiracy or negligence before the _evidential_ burden shifts over to
Chandra.

560 Chandra submits that even if he was negligent, his negligence was _not_
the effective cause of the losses alleged suffered by Nava Bharat.[note: 1094]
Instead, Chandra claims that the losses were the result of Dicky Tan and/or
Jason Tan’s “unilateral subsequent actions in Jakarta” (_ie_ , the
commencement of Case No 1 to reverse the shares in PTIC).[note: 1095] In the
alternative, Chandra submits that Case No 1 was a _novus actus interveniens_
which broke the chain of causation.[note: 1096]

561 Nava Bharat’s response is that Chandra’s contention is misconceived
because it had “suffered the loss even before the reversal [of the PTIC
shares]”.[note: 1097] As for the argument on _novus actus interveniens_ , Nava
Bharat’s reply is similarly that its loss “had already crystallised” when
Chandra pressed for the completion of the Transaction without the Forestry
Licence.[note: 1098] In particular, Nava Bharat claims that Case No 1 should
not be considered as a _novus actus interveniens_ because it was “part of
Chandra’s conspiracy with [Dicky Tan] and [Jason Tan]”.[note: 1099]

562 I start by expressing my difficulty with Nava Bharat’s response. I
understand Nava Bharat to be saying that it was bound to suffer the alleged
losses because the entire chain of events (including Chandra’s alleged
breaches and Case No 1) was part of a conspiracy by Chandra, Dicky Tan and
Jason Tan to defraud Nava Bharat.[note: 1100] This explains why Nava Bharat
claims that it had suffered the loss even _before_ the reversal of the PTIC
shares (even though it had full ownership of the shares as a result of the
share pledges), and why it says that the loss was “crystallised” once the
Transaction was completed without the Forestry Licence. Nava Bharat
presupposes that the acts of Chandra throughout the entire course of the
Transaction and the acts of Jason Tan and/or Dicky Tan in Case No 1 (which
effectively deprived Nava Bharat of the shares in PTIC) were part of a
conspiracy. Since I have earlier found that Chandra neither knew nor was
involved in any alleged conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat, it follows that
Nava Bharat’s argument in this respect must fail.

563 I turn now to address Chandra’s submission. I find that the cause of the
alleged losses suffered by Nava Bharat was the acts of Dicky Tan and/or Jason
Tan in Jakarta, and in particular, the procurement of the reversal of the
shares in PTIC by virtue of Deed No 8 (see [124]–[125] above) and Case No 1
(see [386] above) which Chandra was not involved in. This was accepted by
Ashwin[note: 1101] and Bob Sundaram[note: 1102] at the hearing. Furthermore, I
accept Bob Sundaram’s evidence that Nava Bharat would still be holding on to
the shares in PTIC _but for_ the order made in Case No 1.[note: 1103]

564 In any event, I find that the reversal of the shares in PTIC was a _novus
actus interveniens_ which broke the chain of causation. In _Lamb and another v
Camden London Borough Council and another_ [1981] QB 625, which was cited with
approval by the Court of Appeal in _Chong Yeo and Partners and another v Guan
Ming Hardware and Engineering Pte Ltd_ [1997] 2 SLR(R) 30 at [58], Oliver LJ
at 640 said that:

… What is referred to as the “chain of causation” may be broken and the most
common example of a break in the chain is the intervening act of a third
person over whom the tortfeasor can exercise no control. Such an intervention
does not always break the chain and, in particular, it will not do so where
the very breach of duty relied on is the duty of the defendant to prevent the
sort of intervention which has occurred ...

565 I also find the observations of Carnwath J in _British Racing Drivers’
Club Ltd and another v Hextall Erskine & Co (a firm)_ [1996] 3 All ER 667 at
681 to be pertinent:

The question is whether the negligence of Hextall Erskine was ‘an effective
cause’ of the loss which is claimed. It needs of course to be borne in mind
that, in cases of solicitor’s negligence, it is unlikely that the conduct of
the solicitor will itself be the direct cause of the damage which is suffered.
More usually the basis of the claim is the solicitor’s failure to protect the
client against some other effective cause. The question, therefore, is whether
the particular loss was within the reasonable scope of the dangers against
which it was the solicitor’s duty to provide protection (see eg _Barnes v Hay_
(1988) 12 NSWLR 337). In _Roe v Ministry of Health, Woolley v Ministry of
Health_ [1954] 2 All ER 131 at 138, [1954] 2 QB 66 at 85 Denning LJ put the
question thus: ‘Is the consequence fairly to be regarded as within the risk
created by the negligence?’ Earlier he had said ([1954] 2 All ER 131 at 138,
[1954] 2 QB 66 at 84–85):

‘… causation, as well as duty, often depends on what you should foresee. The
chain of causation is broken when there is an intervening action which you
could not reasonably be expected to foresee …’

Similar statements as to the relevance of foreseeability are made in _Banque
Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd_ [1995] 2 All ER 769 at
855, [1995] QB 375 at 420.

566 On the evidence before me, I find that the acts of Jason Tan and Dicky Tan
in reversing the shares in PTIC were _not_ reasonably foreseeable by Chandra.
As I have mentioned earlier, Chandra neither knew nor was involved in the
alleged conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. In addition, he could not have
reasonably foreseen that Sofwan Rahman and Suhendra would have commenced Case
No 1 in Indonesia. Furthermore, Chandra was _not_ under a duty to protect Nava
Bharat from fraud. This was conceded by Nava Bharat.[note: 1104]

567 Accordingly, even if Chandra was negligent, I find that his negligence was
_not_ the effective cause of the losses alleged suffered by Nava Bharat or
alternatively, that the acts of Jason Tan and Dicky Tan in reversing the
shares in PTIC broke the chain of causation.

Familial relationship

568 Nava Bharat asserts that Chandra ought to have disclosed his relationship
with Rajaram when he advised Nava Bharat and recommended Rajaram to it.[note:
1105] In particular, Nava Bharat claims that it was not just a potential
conflict of interests but Nava Bharat was in fact prejudiced by the
appointment of Rajaram (which Nava Bharat insists was part of the strategy to
further the conspiracy to defraud).[note: 1106]

569 It is difficult to understand the gist of Nava Bharat’s contention.
Insofar as Nava Bharat is suggesting that Chandra had engineered the
appointment of Rajaram and used him as a tool to perpetrate the conspiracy to
defraud Nava Bharat, I have dealt with it (see [407]–[409], [414(a)],
[427]–[429] above). Indeed, I have found that Chandra neither knew nor was
involved in any alleged conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat. In light of this,
Nava Bharat appears to be contending that Chandra had breached his fiduciary
duty owed to Nava Bharat in failing to disclose his relationship with Rajaram
to Nava Bharat. However, it is difficult to see how such a contention can be
sustained. Nava Bharat claims that there is a conflict of interest but
abjectly fails to identify the conflicting interests (see [400]–[401] above).
It appears from the submissions that Nava Bharat’s objection lies with
Chandra’s relationship with Rajaram and Rajaram’s alleged incompetence.[note:
1107] Yet, there is no general duty to disclose (see [410]–[411] above).
Unless Nava Bharat can show that there is a conflict of interest, there is no
obligation for Chandra to disclose his relationship with Rajaram to Nava
Bharat. It is apparent that the present circumstances do not fall within the
rule against conflict of duty and interest _or_ the double employment rule.
Hence, I find that Nava Bharat’s allegation that Chandra ought to have
disclosed his relationship with Rajaram is not supported by the law.

570 For completeness, I should also explain why Nava Bharat’s contention is
not supported on the facts. I have earlier found that Chandra had not
engineered the appointment of Rajaram as Nava Bharat’s lawyer (see [407]–[408]
and [428] above). Nava Bharat asserts that Chandra had gained access to email
correspondence between Ashwin and Baker & Mckenzie in order to engineer
Rajaram’s appointment.[note: 1108] The _sole_ basis for this assertion is
Chandra’s evidence that he had perused emails which showed that Ashwin had
sought a quote for legal services in relation to the Transaction from Chew
Chin of Baker & McKenzie.[note: 1109] According to Nava Bharat, Chandra must
have accessed the email correspondence at the material time because “Chandra
had functions to perform for Agora” and must have used it to help him engineer
Rajaram’s appointment.[note: 1110] This is purely speculative, and it is
inconsistent with the fact that Chandra was a _non-executive_ director of
Agora.[note: 1111] In addition, Chandra explained during the hearing that he
had not perused the emails at the material time but only _after_ the present
suit was commenced so as to defend the claim against him.[note: 1112] In any
case, Nava Bharat had not justified its assertion that Chandra had
surreptitiously accessed the email correspondence to engineer Rajaram’s
appointment. It is also difficult to see how the information in the emails
(which comprises of work scope and fee quote) could have been used to engineer
the appointment of Rajaram.[note: 1113] Indeed, the fact that the fee quote of
SLP was higher than the fee quote by Baker & McKenzie would, to some extent,
suggest that Chandra neither accessed the email correspondence nor attempted
to engineer Rajaram’s appointment.[note: 1114] Indeed, it appears from
Ashwin’s email to Chandra dated 7 October 2008 (see [407] above) that the
decision was made by Nava Bharat after deliberation. On the whole, I am not
prepared to accept that Chandra had surreptitiously accessed Agora’s email to
retrieve information from the communications between Ashwin and Baker &
McKenzie to help him engineer Rajaram’s appointment.

571 Nava Bharat also alleges that Chandra had exercised his influence over
Rajaram in order to advance the conspiracy to defraud Nava Bharat.[note: 1115]
The allegation encompasses the completion of the Transaction despite the
absence of the Forestry Licence and the uncertainty arising out of the new
mining law, the structure of the loan such that it was given to Dicky Tan
instead of PTIC in spite of ABNR’s advice, the various alternative
arrangements, the failure to take “any concerted action to terminate the deal
and/or enforce [Nava Bharat’s] rights”, as well as the failure to object even
when Dicky Tan’s interest in the PTIC shares were compromised.[note: 1116]
Nava Bharat suggests that Rajaram would not have acted as he did unless he was
influenced by Chandra.[note: 1117] Nevertheless, I find that such an inference
is unjustified on the evidence, which shows that Rajaram and Chandra had on
various occasions taken different views on the manner in which the Transaction
was to move forward. I have earlier mentioned two instances which showed that
Rajaram was _not_ influenced by Chandra but, on the contrary, was acting to
protect Nava Bharat’s interest (see [405] above). Moreover, Rajaram had also,
on 12 March 2009, wrote to Chandra to demand that he provide “on an urgent
basis, the course of action that [Dicky Tan] intends to take to remedy the
situation” due to the delay in obtaining the Forestry Licence.[note: 1118] I
should add that it would be unreasonable to expect lawyers representing
opposite sides to a non-contentious transaction to be constantly at odds with
each other, and in many cases, it might well be in the interests of the client
for the lawyer to act in a cooperative manner. In my view, the circumstances,
on the whole, do not show that Chandra had exercised influence over Rajaram in
the course of the Transaction.

572 I accordingly find Nava Bharat’s allegation that Chandra ought to have
disclosed its relationship with Rajaram to Nava Bharat to be wholly without
merit. Perhaps the lesson to be learnt from this episode is that solicitors
ought to be careful in instances involving relatives acting for counterparties
to avoid the kind of allegations by clients when the transaction sours.

Conclusion

573 For the reasons above, I dismiss Nava Bharat’s claims in S 846/2011 and S
847/2011. I will hear counsel on the issue of costs.
