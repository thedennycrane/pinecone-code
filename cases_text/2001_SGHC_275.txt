**Judgment:**

This was an appeal from the decision of district judge Wong Choon Ning ("the
judge"), when she convicted the appellant of an offence under s 146 of the
Penal Code (Cap 224) and acquitted him of another offence under the same
section. The appellant was sentenced to 54 months imprisonment and 12 strokes
of the cane. The appellant appealed against conviction and sentence.

The charge

2 The first charge against the appellant was irrelevant for the purposes of
this appeal and references thereto will be omitted here. The second charge,
DAC 38920/2000, read as follows:

_The evidence of the prosecution_

3 The story that emerged from the prosecution witnesses was as follows. On 6
March 1999, the victim, Rajandran Balasundram ("PW5"), who was a police
officer, and his friends, Vailthilingam Mani Vannan ("PW1") and Shanmugam s/o
Ganesan ("PW2") went to Dunlop Street for a late supper, but parked their cars
at Madras Street. About 2.30 am on 7 March 1999, they walked back to Madras
Street. The Back Alley Pub ("the pub") had just closed and its clientele had
spilled out onto the street.

4 Outside the pub, PW1 and PW2 were confronted by a large group of Indian men.
One of them slapped PW1. On seeing this, PW5 told his friends to leave and he
stayed behind to try to defuse the situation. While speaking to this group of
men, PW5 was set upon by another group of Indian men. The first group left.
PW5 was kicked by the second group, punched and hit with motorcycle helmets.
This was the first incident of assault on PW5, but it was not pertinent to the
appeal.

5 When someone shouted that the police were coming, three of PW5s assailants
fled, taking him with them. PW5 said that he was too weak to resist. They took
him to an isolated area behind Sim Lim Tower. On the way, they passed
pedestrians and vehicles, but PW5 did not attempt to escape because he knew he
could not outrun the men; nor did he shout for help, for fear of reprisals.

6 A few minutes later, four or five Indian men (including the appellant)
joined them. They took PW5s wallet, and hence were able to ascertain where he
lived and worked. They slapped and interrogated him. They also threatened to
harm his family should he report the incident to the police. This continued
for about an hour. During this time, PW5 was bleeding profusely from the
injuries he had suffered in the first assault. One of the men guarded PW5 to
ensure that he did not see their faces, but PW5 said he managed to steal
several glances at three men, including the appellant. Finally, one of the men
drove PW5s car from Madras Street to Sim Lim Tower and PW5 was allowed to
leave in his car.

7 PW5 went home immediately to ensure that his family was safe. He then went
to the hospital for treatment. He initially did not want to report the matter
to the police because the threats were fresh on his mind. However, after
speaking to his superior, DSP Sugumaran Bala ("PS9"), he decided otherwise. He
lodged a report the same day at 9.25 pm.

8 The incident at Sim Lim Tower ("the second incident") was the subject of the
present appeal. PW1 and PW2 corroborated PW5s account up to the point of the
first incident. PW1 added that he too was assaulted and, as a result, lost
consciousness. When he came round, everyone had left. PW2s recount of the
subsequent events was that he fled before the first assault occurred. When he
returned a while later, no one was at the scene.

9 During the trial, ASP Avadiar ("PW3") described the raid at the pub
conducted on 3 April 1999, which led to the arrest of nine Indian men,
including the appellant. Sgt Wong Lip Wing ("PW4") testified on the identity
parade conducted on the same day, in which PW5 decisively picked out the
appellant. The defence did not suggest that the identity parade was improperly
conducted.

_

The evidence of the defence

_

10 The defence case was essentially that the appellant was not present at the
scene of either incident and hence was not a member of the unlawful assembly.
The appellant said that he and Vasuthevan s/o Armuthelingam ("DW2") left their
fathers restaurant for the pub at about 11.30 pm on 6 March 1999. At the pub,
he met some acquaintances. They left at closing time, which was about 2 am.
DW2 went to the washroom, so the appellant went outside the pub to wait for
him. He saw a white Mercedes speeding down the road, and a crowd clamouring
for its registration number. When DW2 emerged from the pub, they left for
home.

11 DW2s evidence was essentially the same. He stressed that the appellant was
not involved in any fight that night.

__

The district judges decision

12 The judge delivered her very detailed grounds of decision on 31 May 2001.
She first set out the prosecution evidence and the defence evidence.

13 The judge then set out the law on identification evidence, and proceeded to
examine the quality of PW5s identification evidence in relation to the second
incident. She found that the quality of such evidence was good.

14 She held that the appellants credit had not been impeached. Having said
that, she was of the impression that he was not a credible witness. She also
ruled that PW2s credit and PW5s credit had also not been impeached. While the
defence did not seek to impeach PW7s credit, the judge nonetheless noted that
he was an evasive witness. The judge considered the law relating to
discrepancies in witnesses evidence, and held that the discrepancies in the
evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW5 were minor and could be disregarded.

15 The judge then set out the law on s 116 Illustration (g) of the Evidence
Act (Cap 97). She declined to draw an adverse inference against the
prosecution for failing to call PW5s friend, as the prosecution had not been
shown to have withheld evidence from the appellant or the court.

16 The judge found that the evidence of the defence witnesses was
inconsistent. She also did not give DW2s evidence much weight.

17 The judge then set out the ingredients of the offence in s 146 of the Penal
Code. She found that the appellant was a member of an unlawful assembly, the
common object of which was to hurt PW5, and that force had been used in
prosecution of that common object.

18 Finally, the judge considered a few precedents on sentencing in rioting
cases. In sentencing the appellant, she bore in mind the aggravating factors,
which were:

> > a PW5 was subject to physical abuse and gruelling interrogation for about
> an hour.
>>

>> b PW5 was not allowed to seek medical attention for his injuries, for about
an hour.

>>

>> c The persons comprising the unlawful assembly knew that PW5 was a police,
yet continued with their behaviour regardless.

>>

>> d In conducting his defence, the appellant made serious allegations about
PW5s integrity.

The only mitigating factors were that the appellant himself did not physically
harm PW5; and the members of the unlawful assembly did not go beyond slapping
PW5.

19 Finally, the judge considered whether this was a case which warranted the
imposition of the maximum sentence of five years and caning prescribed under s
147 of the Penal Code. She concluded that it did not, but that it merited a
sentence close to it.

_

The issues

_

20 The issues in the appeal were:

> > a Did the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
> was present at the scene of the second incident?
>>

>> b If so, was the appellant guilty of the offence of rioting?

>>

>> c Whether the following witnesses were credible:

>>

>>> i PW2 and PW5, against both of whom impeachment exercises were conducted;

>>>

>>> ii PW5 and S/Sgt Abdul Halim b Haji Mohd ("PW7"), in relation to a
statement contained in the Full Incident Report, allegedly made at 5.38 am on
7 March 1999;

>>>

>>> iii PW1, PW2 and PW5 _inter se_ ; and

>>>

>>> iv the appellant and DW2 _inter se_.

>>

>> d Whether the judge should have drawn an adverse inference under s 116
Illustration (g) of the Evidence Act against the prosecution for failing to
call PW5s friend, to whom he claimed to have spoken on Madras Street, before
the first incident occurred.

>>

>> e Whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

21 In dealing with this appeal, the court bore in mind certain well-
established principles. Determinations by trial judges often involve an
assessment of both the facts and the witnesses demeanour. The relationship
between objective evidence and the trial judges findings on the veracity of a
witness was set out in _PP v Yeo Choon Poh_ [1994] 2 SLR 867:

> As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in _Tara Singh & Ors v PP _[1949] MLJ 88
> at p 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the
> witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against
> the whole of his evidence.

In the present case, the judge was careful to state, in relation to every
witness, that her conclusions were based on both objective evidence and the
witness demeanour.

22 What then, is the role of the appellate court in relation to the trial
judges findings based on fact and those based on demeanour? The starting point
was _Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP_[1998] 3 SLR 656:

> It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial
> judges findings of fact, _especially where they hinge on the trial judges
> assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses_ , unless they can
> be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence
>
> Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual
> findings an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any
> necessary inferences of fact (_emphasis added_)

23 It has however to be recognised that this dichotomy cannot be too strictly
applied. The appellate court only sees the record of proceedings, which are
words on a printed page. The same words can be coloured differently by
different types of demeanour. The result of the interaction between the
witness demeanour and his or her words cannot be overlooked. As I said in _PP
v Julia Elizabeth Tubbs_ MA 42/2001:

> In the normal case, a judge sitting on appeal should be sensitive to _the
> impressionistic nuances which invariably contribute to the inferences drawn_
> by the trial judge, who had the opportunity of observing and evaluating the
> evidence first-hand. (_emphasis added_)
>

>> _

The first issue: identification evidence

_

__

24 The starting point was _Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP_[1998] 3 SLR 465, which
adapted the _Turnbull_ guidelines to the Singapore legal system. In dealing
with identification evidence, the principles to be applied were:

> a Does the prosecutions case depend wholly or substantially on the
> correctness of the identification evidence?
>
> b If so, is the identification evidence of good quality, considering the
> circumstances in which the identification was made?
>
> c If the identification evidence is of poor quality, is there any other
> evidence which supports the correctness of the identification?

25 Under part (b) above, a non-exhaustive list of factors includes:

> a The length of time that the witness observed the accused: in this case,
> PW5 glanced at the appellant for five to eight seconds each time.
>
> b The distance at which the observation was made: in this case, the
> appellant was never more than seven metres away from PW5. PW5 could see the
> appellants entire body.
>
> c The number of times the witness had seen the accused: in this case, PW5
> stole several glances at the appellant during the second incident.
>
> d Any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused: in this case,
> PW5 was put through a harrowing experience. As was pointed out in _PP v L (a
> minor)_[1999] 3 SLR 219, this was likely to carve the assailants image
> indelibly into the victims mind:
>
> It seemed to me that it was _precisely the fact that_ she had been molested
> which would have caused [the witness] to take a really good look at her
> molester and commit his face to her memory. (_emphasis added_)
>
> e the length of time between the original observation and the identification
> to the police: in this case, it was less than a month.

26 Moreover, there was sufficient lighting at Sim Lim Tower for PW5 to see the
appellant clearly. There were three fluorescent lights to PW5s right, and a
light from the carpark driveway above. Although there was blood in PW5s eyes,
he was given some water to wash the blood off his face. The judge found that,
despite his fear, PW5 was lucid enough to reason through his chances of escape
and to try to look at his assailants so that he could identify them if need
be.

27 There was no reason to overturn the judges finding that the quality of the
identification evidence was good.

_

The second issue: the offence of rioting

_

28 The offence of rioting is defined in s 146 as:

> 146\. Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or by any
> member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, every
> member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting.
>

>> 29 The first element of the offence is that the appellant was a member of
an unlawful assembly. The meaning of "unlawful assembly" most relevant to this
case was in s 141(c):

> 141\. An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an "unlawful assembly",
> if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is
>
> (c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence
>

>> > > 30 The first requirement under this element is that the common object
of the assembly was, for example, to commit an offence. _Lim Thian Hor v
PP_[1996] 2 SLR 258 drew a distinction between "common object" and "similar or
same object". For the former, "it is essential that the object should be
common to the persons who constitute the assembly and they should be aware of
it and concur in it." In the present case, there was no doubt that the group
of men knew of and concurred in the plan to cause hurt to PW5. They had
gathered at Sim Lim Tower for that purpose. The common object, causing hurt to
a person, obviously fell within the definition of an "offence".

31 The second requirement under this element is that there must have been at
least five members of the assembly. A "member of an unlawful assembly" is also
defined in the statute:

> 142\. Whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful
> assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in it, is said to
> be a member of an unlawful assembly.

This requirement was satisfied in the present case.

32 The second element is that violence or force was used in carrying out the
common object. This need only be used by any one or more members of the
unlawful assembly. This element was also present in the present case, as some
of the men had slapped PW5. It was irrelevant for issues of liability that the
appellant did not use force against PW5.

_

The third issue: the credibility of the witnesses

_

33 As for point (i) in paragraph 20(c) above, only PW5s credibility was dealt
with in the appeal, as PW2s evidence did not extend to the second incident.
Point (iii) was not dealt with, because that part of PW5s evidence which PW1
and PW2 corroborated also did not relate to the second incident.

34 Point (i) will be discussed first. The key charge which could be levelled
at PW5s credibility was that he had lied to the doctors at the hospital that
he had sustained his injuries from a fall. This should not greatly affect his
credibility for two reasons:

> a The judge found that he was genuinely afraid of reprisals from his
> assailants, should the police come to know of the incident. This was not an
> irrational fear, for his assailants knew his address, and that he had a wife
> and young children.
>
> b In any case, he told the police the truth on the same day.

35 Point (ii) was also related to PW5s credibility. The defence sought to show
that PW5s testimony was inconsistent with a statement he had made to PW7,
which was reflected in the Full Incident Report. The entry at 5.38 am stated:

> SIO Halim informed that according to SIO Rajan, earlier he had a drinking
> session at the said pub and had a fall, resulting in some slight injuries on
> the forehead. No dispute or fight took place. Anyway, SIO Rajan is safe and
> sound at home.

Both PW5 and PW7 denied that PW5 had said that: one, he had been drinking at
the pub; and two, he was at home at 5.38 am. The judge reasoned that, if PW5
did not want the police to find out about the assaults, he would have avoided
mentioning the pub. The evidence also showed that PW5 had registered himself
at the hospital at 5.03 am, and hence it was very unlikely that he was home by
5.38 am. There was no reason to doubt such logic. As for PW5s lie about his
sustaining injuries from a fall, the discussion in paragraph 34 above applies.

36 The Full Incident Report showed that PW7 was more involved in the case than
he would admit. Apparently he had instructed his officers to go to the pub
when he heard that PW5 was missing. These were unilateral actions on his part,
and there was no evidence that PW5 knew about them.

37 As regards point (iv), the defence opined that insufficient weight was
given to DW2s evidence. I think the judge was correct in not placing much
weight on his evidence because:

> a DW2 had been to the same pub with the appellant on several occasions, and
> there was nothing special about that occasion. In fact, it was the appellant
> who informed DW2, after he was released from the police station, that there
> had been an assault that night.
>
> b DW2s evidence was inconsistent with that of the appellant, PW1, PW2 and
> PW5. DW2 said that the scene outside the pub after closing time was calm,
> with people milling around. According to the others, there was a rather
> agitated crowd outside the pub.

__

The fourth issue: the prosecutions failure to call a witness

38 Section 116 Illustration (g) of the Evidence Act provides:

> > The court may presume
>>

>> (g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced by
unfavourable to the person who withholds it.

39 The general principle is that a presumption will only arise if it
constitutes a withholding of evidence from the accused or the court (_Yeo
Choon Huat v PP_[1998] 1 SLR 217). In determining whether evidence has been
withheld, the factors which should be considered include:

> > a How material was the evidence of the witness who was not produced?
> (_Chua Keem Long v PP_[1996] 1 SLR 510)
>>

>> b Did the prosecution intend to hinder or hamper the defence? (_Chua Keem
Long v PP_)

>>

>> c Was the witness absence from court brought about by the inaction of the
defence? (_Tan Ah Lay v PP_ Criminal Appeal 14/93, Unreported)

40 In the present case, PW5s friend was not a material witness, as his
evidence would pertain only to matters even before the first incident. The
prosecution could not be said to have hindered the defence because they made
the defence aware of the existence of and role played by PW5s friend. Hence
the defence could have called this witness, but chose not to.

__

The fifth issue: sentencing

41 The punishment prescribed for this offence is set out in s 147:

> > 147\. Whoever is guilty of rioting shall be punished with imprisonment for
> a term which may extend to 5 years and shall also be liable to caning.

42 According to _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ , the
sentencing range for non-secret society related cases is 18 to 24 months
imprisonment. However, there were many aggravating factors and relatively few
mitigating ones. The former include:

> > a The second incident was premeditated. Three of the assailants took PW5
> to Sim Lim Tower, and must have informed the rest to join them there.
>>

>> b PW5 was subject to terror for an hour, in a deserted location. There was
both mental and physical abuse.

>>

>> c While PW5s injuries were due to the first, not the second, assault, the
members of the second unlawful assembly persisted despite the fact that PW5
was already injured.

>>

>> d The appellant had criminal records, including a similar antecedent. He
was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempted theft in 1995, but breached
probation by committing an offence of rioting. He was sentenced to 18 months
imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for that offence, and a further six
months imprisonment for breaching probation.

43 The mitigating factors were those stated by the judge (see paragraph 18
above). These were far outweighed by the aggravating factors. I did not think
the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

_

Motion to adduce fresh evidence: Criminal Motion 29 of 2001

_

44 On 14 September 2001, the appellant filed a notice of motion that the
defence would seek to admit fresh evidence at the hearing. One Kesavan s/o
Seenivasan ("Kesavan"), who was convicted of criminal intimidation and rioting
in respect of the second incident, was willing to testify that the appellant
was not present at the scene.

45 The High Courts power to receive additional evidence is found in s 257(1)
of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68):

> > In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks
> additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or
> direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrates Court.

46 The principles which apply to the exercise of this power were enunciated in
_Ladd v Marshall_[1954] 3 All ER 745 and adopted in _Jumaat b Samad v
PP_[1993] SLR 338. The court would exercise its power only if:

> > a The evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for
> use at the trial;
>>

>> b The evidence is such that, if given, it would probably have an important
influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; and

>>

>> c The evidence is credible.

47 As for the first condition, it was true that Kesavan turned himself in to
the police only after the conclusion of the appellants trial. But it was the
defences case that Kesavan and the appellant were childhood friends, and were
still acquainted at the time of the assaults. That being so, the appellant was
in a better position than any other party in this case to obtain Kesevans
evidence. However, the defence could not produce evidence of any attempts
which the appellant had made to contact Kesavan before the appellant was
tried. I was of the opinion that the evidence could have been obtained for use
at the trial, had reasonable diligence been used.

48 With regards to the second condition, it was difficult to see how Kesavans
evidence could have an important influence on the result of the case. The crux
of the judges decision was based on PW5s identification evidence, which was
found to be reliable. Kesavans evidence would not challenge that finding.
Indeed, it is rather odd for the defence to attempt to prove that the
appellant was _not_ at Sim Lim Tower, rather than that he _was_ somewhere
else.

49 The third hurdle, too, was not cleared. It was sufficient to refer to
_Chung Tuck Kwai v PP_[1998] 2 SLR 693, which disposed of the matter:

> > At this stage of appeal, the prosecution would not have the opportunity of
> cross-examining [the witness] to determine his credibility. _The additional
> evidence was of such a nature that it ought not to be accepted as credible
> without [him] being put to cross-examination_. (_emphasis added_)

Hence I dismissed the motion to adduce fresh evidence.

_

Conclusion

_

50 In view of the above, I dismissed the appeal.
