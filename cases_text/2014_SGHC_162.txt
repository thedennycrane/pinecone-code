Chan Seng Onn J:

1 In 2013, DBS Bank Ltd (the “plaintiffs”) provided banking facilities with a
limit of S$1,700,000 to M.U. Industrial Pte Ltd (the “defendants”). Pursuant
to the utilisation of these facilities, the defendants became indebted to the
plaintiffs in the sum of S$1,603,373.19 inclusive of accrued interest (“the
Debt”) as at 4 May 2014. When the defendants did not pay the Debt, the
plaintiffs served a statutory demand on the defendants on 6 May 2014.

2 The Debt was not paid although more than 21 days had elapsed since the date
of service of the statutory demand.

3 After setting off the fixed deposits amounting to S$200,500 placed by the
defendants with the plaintiffs as security for the facilities, the outstanding
debt of the defendants inclusive of accrued interest as at 30 May 2014 was
S$1,407,243.50.

4 As the defendants were deemed to be insolvent and unable to pay their debt
within the meaning of s 254(1)(_e_) read with s 254(2)(_a_) of the Companies
Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), the plaintiffs applied for a winding up order on 10
June 2014 against the defendants with the Official Receiver to be appointed as
the liquidator of the defendants. The hearing for the winding up application
was fixed on 4 July 2014. Notice of the winding up application and the hearing
date was published in the Government Gazette and advertised in The Straits
Times and Lianhe ZaoBao on 20 June 2014.

5 The defendants were also served with the winding up application and
supporting affidavit on 11 June 2014. These documents were left with the
defendants’ receptionist at the defendants’ registered office at 8 Joo Koon
Road Singapore 628972.

6 The consent of Mr Chee Yoh Chuang and Mr Abuthahir Abdul Gafoor, both of
Stone Forest Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd (the “approved liquidators”), to act
jointly and severally as liquidators if so appointed by the Court, was
subsequently obtained and filed in court on 1 July 2014.

7 At the hearing before me on 4 July 2014, the plaintiffs’ counsel applied to
amend the Originating Summons to substitute the Official Receiver with the
approved liquidators. I granted the plaintiffs leave to amend.

8 Mr Christopher Eng, representing the Official Receiver, confirmed that all
the papers for the winding up application were in order. I was satisfied that
the relevant provisions of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 50, R 1, 2006
Rev Ed) were complied with.

9 As the defendants did not send anyone to represent them at the hearing to
oppose the application, and with the papers being in order, I made an order
for the defendants to be wound up on the basis that the company was unable to
pay its debts. I further appointed Mr Chee Yoh Chuang and Mr Abuthahir Abdul
Gafoor as the liquidators of the defendants. The costs of the proceedings were
also ordered to be agreed or taxed and paid to the plaintiffs out of the
assets of the defendants.

10 The defendants have since appealed against my decision.
