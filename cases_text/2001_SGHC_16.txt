**JUDGMENT:**

**Grounds of Decision**

1 This is an appeal by the Defendant arising out of his application (SIC 789
of 2000) made under Order 18 rule 19(b) and (d) and under the inherent
jurisdiction of the Court seeking the following:

> (1) the Plaintiffs Statement of Claim be struck out and the action
> dismissed;
>
> (2) the Defendants costs incurred in defending this action, the costs of
> this application and the costs of the application in SIC 643 of 2000 filed
> on 29 August 2000 be borne by the Plaintiffs on an indemnity basis.

2 The Senior Assistant Registrar dismissed the Defendants application with
costs fixed at $1,500.

3 I allowed the Defendants appeal and ordered the Plaintiffs to pay the
Defendant $3,500 as the costs of the entire action.

4 The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiffs present action was frivolous,
vexations and an abuse of process of Court as it was nothing more than an
attempt to re-litigate the causes of actions and the issues in five earlier
actions by the Defendant and that there were no merits in the Plaintiffs
allegations.

_

THE BACKGROUND AND THE ARGUMENTS

_

5 The Plaintiffs commenced the present action on 26 June 2000. Their Statement
of Claim was in the following terms:

> "1. The Plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore and having its
> office at 27 Apex Tower #27-00 Singapore 079905.
>
> 2\. At the request of the Defendant from time to time between the period of
> 1995 to 1998 the Defendant delivered a number of shipments of various
> Chinese antiques, (purported to have been exported out of the People
> Republic of China) to the Plaintiff. As acknowledgement of the estimated
> value the said goods (antiques) delivered, the Plaintiff issued a number of
> cheques and some from their chairman, Mr Tong Djoe at the material time. The
> total value of these cheques amounted to $649,000.00 in 1998.
>
> 3\. The Defendant subsequent commenced action in late 1998 against the
> Plaintiff and their chairman claiming the sale of the Chinese antiques and
> instituted actions for the value of these antiques delivered based on the
> cheques received and presented for payment but were dishonoured on
> presentation. The Plaintiff maintained that the goods (antiques) were held
> by them as bailor and therefore disputed that the cheques were meant to be
> presented for payment.
>
> 4, The Defendant in his actions in Suit 2037 of 1998 was for $565,000.00 and
> in DC Suit No. 6583 of 1998 for $64,000.00 against Mr Tong Djoe for the
> proceeds of sale of antiques based on the cheques issued by them.
>
> 5\. By an agreement and in settlement of the Defendants actions in Suit No.
> 2037 of 1998 and DC 6583 of 1998, the terms of the settlement were described
> in the Plaintiffs solicitors letter dated 15th December 1998, which was duly
> accepted by the Defendant through his solicitor on the 17th December 1998.
> The settlement were meant for all the antiques delivered to the Plaintiff
> which were agreed at $324,500.00 subject to the following terms:
>

>> (i) $32,450.00 being 10% to be paid within 7 days

>>

>> (ii) Thereafter 18 monthly instalments of $16,225.00

>>

>> in exchange the Defendant was to deliver

>>

>>> (a) all the cheques concerned

>>>

>>> (b) a letter of indemnity for any claim arising from the cheques concerned

>>>

>>> (c) To file the Notice of Discontinuance of both action on settlement or
agreement of terms

>>>

>>> (d) all shipping documents, invoices, custom clearance documents as
inspected and accepted and be exchanged on receipt of 1st instalment payment.

>>

>> Pursuant to the agreement, inspection took place where various invoices and
shipping documents were inspected but the actual exchange did not take place
at all despite attempts to carry out the exchange on 25th March and 30th March
1998.

>
> 6\. In fact, the cheques concerned were handed over to the Defendants
> solicitors as stakeholders pending the exchange. Further the notices of
> discontinuance of both actions and the letter of indemnity were also
> similarly handed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff solicitors.
>
> 7\. (a) Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the sum of $10,000.00,
> $8,000.00 and $8,000.00 were paid by the Plaintiff prior to the intended
> exchange to demonstrate the Plaintiff intention to pay under the terms of
> settlement. The exchange of the balance of the documents described in
> paragraph 5(d) above were to be exchanged and furnished by the Defendant.
>
> (b) Subsequently, without providing all the documents to be exchanged
> described in paragraph 5(d) above under the terms of settlement, the
> Defendant commenced numerous actions for the payments due under the terms of
> the agreement. They are:

> 8 (a) The Plaintiff solicitors were instructed to enter appearance to all
> the above actions referred to in paragraph 7(b) above but were instructed
> not to reply to the Order 14 applications for summary judgment as the
> Plaintiff intended at all times to make payment under the terms of
> settlement. All the judgment entered in paragraph 7 above were satisfied
> except for the 21/2000G where the sum of $68,309.02 is being held by the

> (b) By the payment of $136,300.00 described in paragraph 7 above, the
> Plaintiff have made payment under the terms of settlement beyond the 1st

> 9\. In addition, the Plaintiff was laboring under the believe at the

> especially the custom clearance papers, to confirm the country of origin of

>
> 10\. On the 23rd March 2000, the Plaintiff through their solicitors objected
> to the judgment entered in default of appearance when the Memorandum of
> Appearance submitted to be filed electronically on the 14th day of March was
> rejected and thereafter the Plaintiff Memorandum of Appearance filed was
> minutes late before judgment was entered on the 15th March 2000. The
> Plaintiff also intimated that the agreed documents under the terms of
> settlement were still outstanding and have not yet been furnished by the
> Defendant. The Defendant failed or refused to furnish the documents
> concerned or reply on the matter.
>
> 11\. On the 12th June 2000 the Plaintiff demanded the production of the
> documents to be delivered by the Defendant under the term of the settlement
> in particular those described under paragraph 5(d) above.
>
> 12\. However, the Defendant in reply refused to provide any of the documents
> and thereby breached the fundamental term of the settlement. As a result the
> Plaintiff is unable to provide proof that the antiques were from the Peoples
> Republic of China and put to suffer loss and damages by the Defendant.
>
> 13\. And the Plaintiff claims
>

>> (i) Specific performance by the Defendant to deliver the said documents
described in paragraphs 5(d) above.

>>

>> (ii) Damages for the detention of the documents concerned.

>>

>> (iii) Further and other relief as the Court deems fit.

>>

>> (iv) costs

>> (i) Damages;

>>

>> (ii) Loss from the sale of the antiques without the certification of
origin;

>>

>> (iii) Further and other relief as the Court thinks fit

>>

>> (iv) Costs

>
> 15\. In addition, the Plaintiff pray for an order that pending the decision
> of the Court the sum of $68,309.02 in the solicitors accounts of the
> Defendant, M/s Drew & Napier, which may be payable to the Defendant be
> restrained from being dealt with by the Defendant in any way or pay to the
> Defendant or remit by the Defendant out of jurisdiction."

6 The settlement agreement referred to in the Statement of Claim was contained
in the Plaintiffs solicitors letter dated 15 December 1998 and the Defendants
solicitors letter dated 17 December 1998. The 15 December 1998 letter read:

> "**_SUIT NO 2037 OF 1998 and DC Suit 6583 of 1998_**
>
> 1\. Our clients, the company accepts that their Chairman, Mr Tong Djoes
> cheques were drawn to pay on behalf of the company and therefore
> acknowledges that the cheques in the 2nd action above were part of the
> additional cheques to be paid by them.
>
> 2\. Upon satisfactory conclusion of the terms of settlement our clients
> shall issue payment of 10% of the settlement sum within 7 days.
>
> 3\. Therefore our clients shall issue the 18 monthly installments and it
> would be convenient if the addresses were given for the sending of the
> cheque for each month.
>
> 4\. The terms of settlement to be accepted by the parties are subject to the
> following:
>

>> a) Inspection of all the original cheques concerned with the total of
$649,000-00 and the settlement sum is $324,500-00. 10% would be $32,450-00 and
each equal monthly installment is $16,225-00 for 18 months.

>>

>> b) All original cheques are handed to our clients upon receipt of the 10%
payment and your client or his solicitor is entitled to cancel all the cheques
handed over.

>>

>> c) an indemnity in the terms acceptable by our clients against all the
cheques for any claim arising thereof should be handed to our clients in
exchange for the first payment.

>>

>> d) All shipping documents, invoices, custom clearance documents to be
inspected and accepted and be exchanged on receipt of the 1st installment
payment of 10%.

>>

>> e) That on acceptance of the terms of settlement your client shall
forthwith file the Notice of Discontinuance for the above actions.

>
> 5\. Please confirm the above are the terms agreed by the parties so that we
> can proceed with inspection and drafting of the terms of indemnity for the
> acceptance.
>
> 6\. The payment made in exchange of the cheques and the documents described
> in paragraph 4 (d) above should take place within this week.
>
> 7\. Could you confirm the above as in order and acceptable? We would be able
> tomorrow to inspect the items in 4(a) and 4(d)."

The 17 December 1998 letter accepted the above in the following terms:

> "We refer to your "Without Prejudice" letter addressed to us dated 15
> December 1998 and the subsequent telephone conversation between your Mr
> Peter Pang and our Diana The today.
>
> We confirm that the terms contained therein have been accepted by our
> clients. We undertake to forward the original copy of the duly executed
> Indemnity Agreement within 14 days of the exchange."

7 The Defendant conceded that a formal exchange of payment against documents
did not take place but averred in paragraph 16 of the Amended Defence (with 14
paragraphs of particulars) that it was due to the Plaintiffs fault. The
Defendant also averred in paragraph 26 of the Amended Defence that the
Plaintiffs were estopped from alleging that they were entitled to any
documents or that the said exchange was incomplete. Reliance was placed on the
particulars given in paragraph 16 of the Amended Defence as well as 12 more
paragraphs of particulars. It was further averred that the Plaintiffs had
waived strict compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement and the
requirement of an exchange and that the Plaintiffs had affirmed the settlement
agreement. In any case, the Defendant said, the Plaintiffs were estopped from
alleging breach by the Defendant as a result of the five judgments obtained by
the Defendant against the Plaintiffs in the five earlier suits.

8 Paragraph 16 of the Amended Defence averred as follows ("GPP" refers to the
Defendants then solicitors and "PP&Co" refers to the Plaintiffs solicitors):

> "16. The Defendant was ready, able and willing to carry out the Exchange.
> The Exchange did not take place on 25 and 30 March 1999, or at all, at the
> fault of the Plaintiffs.
>

> were in Indonesia;
>
> b. By a letter dated 21 January 1999 from GPP to PP&Co, GPP required PP&Co

> g. By a letter dated 19 March 1999 from PP&Co to GPP, PP&Co proposed that

> forwarded;
>
> h. By a letter dated 23 March 1999 from GPP to PP&Co, GPP denied that a

> March 1999 at 2.58 pm, PP&Co insisted that a further sum of S$8,000.090 had

> concluded the letter by saying that "We need in return the indemnity

>
> l. By a letter inadvertently dated 29 January 1999 and faxed to GPP on 30

9 Paragraph 26 of the Amended Defence was in the following terms:

10 Before the commencement of the present action, the Defendant had instituted
five suits in the Subordinate Courts for the recovery of the instalments that
had fallen due under the settlement agreement and had obtained judgment in
four of them. The fifth judgment was obtained shortly after the commencement
of the present action. In each of those five suits, it was pleaded by the
present Defendant that the first of the 18 instalments was due and payable on
29 May 1999 and that the remaining 17 were due and payable on the 29th day of
each subsequent month.

11 The Defendant argued that the two judgments under Order 14 and the three
judgments under Order 13 and Order 19 in the said five suits precluded the
Plaintiffs here from asserting there had been a breach. Further, the
Plaintiffs present allegations could and should have been raised in any of the
said five suits. However, the Plaintiffs decided not to contest those actions
and allowed judgment to be entered in each of them. After judgment in default
of appearance had been obtained in DC Suit 21 of 2000, the present Plaintiffs
applied to have the judgment set aside. The application was heard by a Deputy
Registrar of the Subordinate Courts on 27 July 2000 and was dismissed on 11
August 2000. The present Plaintiffs appealed. The appeal was dismissed by a
District Judge on 11 November 2000. The issues in DC Suit 21 of 2000 and those
in the present action were the same. The Plaintiffs have applied for leave to
appeal to the High Court.

12 The Defendant further submitted there were no merits in the Plaintiffs
present allegations as it was plain from the various correspondence pleaded
and exhibited that the exchange did not take place in the manner provided in
the settlement agreement because of the Plaintiffs own fault.

13 The Plaintiffs argued that the customs clearance documents were never
handed over to them or their solicitors. Their solicitors letters dated 16
June 2000 and 21 June 2000 to the Defendants present solicitors read:

> (16 June 2000)
>
> "**RE: TERMS OF SETTLEMENT ACCEPTED 17 TH DECEMBER 1998**
>
> BETWEEN TUNAS PTE LTD AND MR NG MAN-LEONG
>
> 1\. We have your letter of 15th June 2000.
>
> 2\. In view of your clients refusal to furnish any of the outstanding
> documents agreed under the terms of settlement and even made no attempt to
> mitigate the situation by furnishing some of the outstanding documents
> agreed in exchange, our client has no option but to hold your client in

>
> 3\. Our client therefore reserves their rights to seek specific performance

>
> 4\. In the event we are seeking the recovery of the losses, it would include

>

>
> "1. We refer to the above matter and our letter of 16th June 2000.
>

>
> 6\. We appreciate your reply within 7 days from date hereof."

14 The Defendants solicitors replied on 27 June 2000 as follows:

> "1. We refer to your letter dated 16 June 2000 and 21 June 2000.
>
> 2\. In view of your clients conduct and all the correspondence, the

15 Before me, Mr Peter Pang stated that if the said customs clearance
documents were handed over to him, he would withdraw the present action. He
was compelled to commence this suit because of the Defendants solicitors
insistence that they had been handed over when they were not.

16 He argued that the Plaintiffs allowed the five judgments to be entered in
the Subordinate Courts because the Plaintiffs wished to affirm the settlement
agreement despite the Defendants breach. Since they were so affirming, they
were obliged to pay and their right to sue for damages had not been waived or
abandoned in any way.

17 The Defendant responded by stating that although no inventory list of all
the documents was prepared, the Plaintiffs had not complained about the
customs clearance documents being missing until March 2000 when a Writ of
Seizure and Sale was taken out in DC Suit 21 of 2000.

_

THE DECISION OF THE COURT

_

18 Comparing the documents in the five actions in the Subordinate Courts and
those in the present suit, it was clear to me that the Plaintiffs present suit
was nothing more than a repetition of the same issues which had been put to
rest by the Plaintiffs decision to allow judgment to be entered in any of the
five suits.

19 By submitting to judgment and paying the instalments, the Plaintiffs had
acknowledged that the instalments were due under the settlement agreement.
They could not have been due if the exchange of documents was not done or was
not completed satisfactorily. They were therefore estopped in all the
circumstances of this case from alleging that the exchange was incomplete. In
any event, the formal exchange was not carried out due to the Plaintiffs
fault.

20 The Plaintiffs could not decide when and where they would raise matters
when those matters had already been put in issue in earlier proceedings and,
in this instance, many times over. If they chose not to contest the Defendants
actions or to allow the summary judgments therein to stand, they could not now
attempt to shake the factual foundation on which those judgments rest. The
instalments stage was premised upon the exchange stage having been completed
satisfactorily. If the exchange stage had not been so, it was incumbent on the
Plaintiffs to challenge that the instalments were due at all or at least to
insist that any judgment entered reflect the status of the exchange. By
electing not to do so, they could not now be permitted to rake up what had
been interred with their consent or knowledge.

21 If any breach of the settlement agreement had taken place, it was on the
part of the Plaintiffs. It was their lackadaisical attitude in carrying out
the terms that threw everything out of the order intended. They could not now
be permitted to sue on what was essentially their own wrongdoing. The present
claim was therefore devoid of merit in any case.

22 I therefore allowed the appeal and granted the Defendant the orders sought.
I fixed the costs of the entire action payable by the Plaintiffs to the
Defendant at $3,500.
