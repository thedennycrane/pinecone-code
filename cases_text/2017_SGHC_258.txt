Lai Siu Chiu SJ:

Introduction

1 This was a sad case involving a fatal road accident that took place on the
night of 21 May 2015 (“the accident”) between a motorcycle no. FBD 3809U (“the
motorcycle”) ridden by Muhammad Mundzir bin Ithnin (“the deceased”) and a
motorcar no. SJL 3321Y (“the car”) driven by Toh Hwee Hong Freddy (“the
defendant”). The defendant was making a right turn at a traffic light
controlled junction at Woodlands when the car collided with the motorcycle and
the deceased was flung some 5m from the motorcycle. 1

2 The deceased’s elder brother Muhammad Hamdi bin Ithnin (“the plaintiff”), as
the administrator of the deceased’s estate, commenced proceedings in Suit No
165 of 2016 against the defendant in negligence arising out of the demise of
the deceased, making claims on behalf of the estate and the dependants who
were his parents.

3 On 15 September 2016, interlocutory judgment by consent was entered against
the defendant on the basis of his bearing 90% liability, with damages to be
assessed by, and the costs, interest and disbursements reserved to, the
Registrar. The assessment of damages was conducted by this court.

4 The plaintiff’s claims for special and general damages with the defendant’s
counterproposals are shown in the following table: 3

evidence adduced at the trial, the plaintiff accepted the defendant’s figure
of $13,714 for item 2. 4

The plaintiff’s case

6 Besides giving evidence himself, the plaintiff called as witnesses his
parents, his sibling Muhammad Fitri bin Ithnin (“Fitri”), a doctor from KTPH,
an eye-witness to the accident and a motor appraiser.

7 At the time of his untimely demise, the deceased was a sergeant in the
Traffic Police department earning an average monthly salary of $3,680. 5

##### Foot Note 5

According to a statement from the Singapore Police Force at AB127.

In the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“the AEIC”) of the deceased’s father
Ithnin bin Taib (“Taib”), it was said that the deceased supported his parents
with a total monthly sum of $500, of which $200 was given to Taib and $300
(including $100 for groceries) to the deceased’s mother, Norianah binte Khair
(“Norianah”). 6

Taib’s AEIC at para 15.

In addition, the deceased would have serviced the monthly mortgage instalment
of the family’s new Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat had he not
died.

8 Taib deposed that in 2014, his family was residing in a 5-room HDB flat at
Block 802, Woodlands Street 81 #07-85 (“the Block 802 flat”). Taib reached 55
years of age on 25 May 2014 and this resulted in the Central Provident Fund
Board (“the CPF Board”) transferring $64,985 from his CPF Ordinary and Special
Accounts to his Retirement Account. As the CPF contributions from his employer
were also reduced, Taib encountered difficulties in meeting the monthly
mortgage instalments of about $895 on his HDB mortgage from his CPF monthly
contributions of about $350–$450. He fell into arrears on his mortgage
instalments. 7

Taib’s AEIC at paras 22–25.

9 Taib deposed that after discussing with Norianah, he decided to down-size to
a smaller flat. He and Norianah sold the Block 802 flat for $410,000 on or
about 18 February 2015. Completion of the sale was scheduled for 12 June 2015.

Taib’s AEIC at paras 31 and 33.

10 As Taib and Norianah faced difficulties in obtaining another housing loan
to buy a smaller HDB flat because of their age and limited earning capacity,
they decided that either the deceased or their second son Fitri would step in
as the co-owner of the new HDB flat in view of their sons’ higher earning
capacity and younger ages. However, as Fitri was then in between jobs, the
family decided that the deceased was the best person to purchase the new flat.

Taib’s AEIC at paras 27–30.

11 Consequently, when Taib and Norianah entered into an option to purchase a
flat at Block 708, Woodlands Drive 70 #02-19 (“the Block 708 flat”) on or
about 23 March 2015 for $355,000 (“the Option”), the deceased was named as the
third purchaser in the Option. Completion of the purchase was scheduled for 3
July 2015. 10

##### Foot Note 10

Taib’s AEIC at paras 31 and 34.

12 On or about 17 March 2015, Taib, Norianah and the deceased obtained an HDB
loan of $222,000 (“the deceased’s loan”) from Hong Leong Finance (“Hong
Leong”) to fund the purchase of the Block 708 flat. As the deceased would be
drawing upon his CPF contributions to service the monthly mortgage instalments
due to Hong Leong, he was obliged to and did participate in the CPF Home
Protection Scheme. 11

##### Foot Note 11

Taib’s AEIC at paras 35 and 36.

13 After the demise of the deceased, the family notified the HDB as well as
Hong Leong, who cancelled the deceased’s loan. In view of the pending
completion of the Block 708 flat, the family had to obtain an alternative
loan. Fitri agreed to be the borrower. He applied to and obtained from Hong
Leong a smaller loan in the sum of $177,500 (“Fitri’s loan”) but at a higher
interest rate than what was offered to the deceased and for a shorter period
of 20 years instead of 25 years. 12

##### Foot Note 12

Taib’s AEIC at paras 38 and 39.

14 In addition, as Fitri’s loan was $44,500 less than the deceased’s loan, the
family had to provide a cash top-up of $28,150 as against the lower top-up
figure of $15,250 under the deceased’s loan. In addition, had the deceased not
passed away, the monthly mortgage instalment for the Block 708 flat would have
been lower, as can be seen from the table below: 13

| Taib| The deceased | Fitri

Monthly instalment via CPF had the deceased survived | $350.00| $543.08| $0.00  
Current monthly instalment via CPF | $456.69| $0.00| $500.00  
  
15 Further, due to the demise of the deceased, the family was unable to
complete the purchase of the Block 708 flat on 3 July 2015 as scheduled. They
had to apply for an extension of time from the HDB as well as rent alternative
accommodation in August 2015 at Block 782E Woodlands Crescent #11-367 (“the
Woodlands Crescent flat”), thereby incurring one month’s rent of $1,600. In
addition, the family had to incur moving expenses of $500 to the Woodlands
Crescent flat. 14

Taib’s AEIC at para 41.

16 Taib and Norianah are now 58 and 54 years of age respectively. With regard
to the dependency claim (items 8 and 9 in [4(b)] above), Taib (whose testimony
was supported by confirmatory AEICs filed by Norianah and Fitri) deposed that
every month the deceased gave him and Norianah an allowance of $200 each from
the time the deceased started working. In addition, the deceased gave Norianah
another $100 per month for groceries for the family. It was Taib’s view that
over time, had he lived, the deceased’s salary would have increased and in
turn, the deceased would have increased his allowance to his parents to $500
each. 15

##### Foot Note 15

Taib’s AEIC at para 17.

17 Taking 25 years as his and his wife’s life expectancy, Taib made the
following dependency claims on their behalf:

(a) $30,000 for 5 years (@ $500 per month x 60 months); and

(b) $240,000 for 20 years (@ $1,000 per month x 240 months).

18 As for the cost of applying for and extracting letters of administration
for the deceased’s estate, the plaintiff exhibited in his AEIC (and also at
AB131–135) a statement of charges dated 4 November 2015 from the estate’s
solicitors evidencing the amount. 16

##### Foot Note 16

Plaintiff’s AEIC at pp 72–76.

19 The only other items in the estate’s claim at [4(a)] that were disputed
were items 3 and 6, pertaining to storage charges for the motorcycle and the
pain and suffering of the deceased respectively.

20 With regard to the storage charges of $2,895, it was the plaintiff’s
evidence that the damaged motorcycle was towed to a workshop at United Cycles
LLP (“the workshop”) in Changi and stored there from 1 June 2015 to 31
December 2016 @ $5 per day for 579 days. Initially, the workshop had agreed to
store the motorcycle without charge. Subsequently, the workshop became
concerned about the motorcycle remaining with the workshop for over a year.
The workshop demanded that the motorcycle be removed or disposed of by 31 May
2016 failing which it would start charging for its storage. The plaintiff’s
solicitors wrote to the defendant’s solicitors on 16 May 2016 offering two
proposals:

(a) that the motorcycle be scrapped; or

(b) that the defendant bear the storage charges.

21 The defendant’s solicitors replied that the plaintiff “should act according
to what a reasonable man would do in order to mitigate any loss”. At the
material time, another firm of solicitors (“S & Co”) was acting for the
defendant in criminal proceedings (wherein the defendant was charged on 15
October 2015 under s 304A(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for
causing death by a negligent act). S & Co on 16 May 2016 objected to the
disposal of the motorcycle on the ground that the vehicle could be crucial
evidence in the then ongoing criminal proceedings against the defendant for
which there was a possibility of the defendant’s insurance company hiring an
accident reconstruction expert. S & Co therefore proposed that the motorcycle
be scrapped only after the determination of the criminal proceedings against
the defendant. 17

In the result, the motorcycle was left in storage with the workshop until end
2016.

22 The independent eye-witness to the accident, Mohamad Farid bin Salleh, was
riding a motorcycle at the material time. He testified that he went to the
scene of the accident when he was riding past the Woodlands junction. He found
the deceased lying on the ground and when he inquired, the deceased said he
was in great pain. However, it was the evidence of Dr Goo Tiong Thye (“Dr
Goo”) that the deceased was unconscious by the time he arrived at KTPH at 2043
hours on 21 May 2015. In his AEIC, Dr Goo deposed that the deceased went into
cardiac arrest at 2050 hours and he opined that the deceased would not have
experienced any pain after he became unconscious. 18

The defendant’s case

23 The defendant did not appear at the assessment hearing nor did he call any
witnesses.

24 As shown in the table at [4(a)], the defendant disputed the quantum of the
plaintiff’s estate claims for (i) the cost of application for letters of
administration and (ii) pain and suffering. The defendant disputed in
principle the claim for storage charges of the motorcycle on the basis that
the claim was never pleaded. 19

##### Foot Note 19

×

Defendant’s written submissions at para 16.

He further disputed the rental claim and the moving fee.

25 With regards to the dependency claims, the defendant objected to (i) the
quantum of the claims of Taib and Norianah; (ii) the loss of the loan of
$222,000; (iii) the interest thereon of $88,725; (iv) the housing rental of
$1,600; and (v) the moving expenses of $500.

26 In regard to item 10 at [4(b)], the defendant pointed out that under cross-
examination, Taib had admitted that the deceased was not to be solely
responsible for repaying the entire loan as pleaded at para 14(d) of the
statement of claim. 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

Defendant’s written submissions at para 35.

Taib’s own AEIC (at para 43) deposed that he was to help service the loan by a
monthly sum of $350 from his CPF contributions. This was stated in (i) the
application form to use CPF savings to purchase HDB flat dated 8 May 2015 21

and (ii) the completion account for the purchase attached to the conveyancing

. Hence, the defendant contended that this item of claim was a nonstarter, as
was the claim under the Home Protection Scheme of the deceased – Fitri had
obtained the exact same protection scheme through his CPF for servicing
Fitri’s loan through his CPF contributions.

27 The defendant conceded that Taib’s monthly CPF contributions to service
Fitri’s loan were $456.69, $106.69 more than $350.00. Consequently, the
defendant accepted that for the 20 years for Fitri’s loan, Taib would have to
pay more than under the deceased’s loan. 23

Defendant’s written submissions at paras 36 and 37.

28 The defendant objected to both the multiplier and the multiplicand for
Taib’s claim and objected to the multiplier for Norianah’s claim for the loss
of support from the deceased (items 8 and 9 of the table at [4(b)]). The
defendant pointed out that both the plaintiff and Fitri testified that they
gave their mother (Norianah) a monthly allowance but not their father,
probably because Taib is still working whereas Norianah is a homemaker. The
defendant reasoned that it was likely that the deceased likewise gave an
allowance only to Norianah and not to Taib. In para 21 of his AEIC, Taib
deposed that he earned $3,121.50 per month in 2014 inclusive of commission and
bonus. As at the date of affirmation of his AEIC (27 March 2017), Taib was
working as a sales executive with JAE Auto Pte Ltd. 24

It was also noted that the deceased would have had to pay $543.08 per month
from his CPF contributions to service the loan. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

Taib’s AEIC at para 43.

The deceased’s then average monthly salary at the material time was $3,680,
which was not very much higher than what Taib earned in 2014. It was highly
unlikely that the deceased would have given $200 to Taib over and above what
he gave to Norianah.

29 It was the defendant’s case that based on the evidence of the plaintiff and
Fitri, Taib did not receive any allowance from either son. Therefore, it was
highly unlikely that the deceased gave Taib any allowance either while the
deceased was alive. Unlike Norianah, who is a homemaker, Taib worked and
continues to work and indeed earns a higher salary than Fitri.

30 In the defendant’s opening statement, he had counter-proposed $28,600.50
for Taib’s claim with the following breakdown:

Pre-trial loss: 15 months x $306.69 ($200 + $106.69) | $4,600.35  
---|---  
Post-trial loss: 10 years x $200 per month (due to possibility of the deceased’s marrying and reducing his support) | $24,000.00  
Total| $28,600.35  
  
31 In his closing submissions, the defendant revised the above multiplicand
downwards to $200 per month inclusive of the additional $106.69 per month
payable on Fitri’s loan. He then used a multiplier of 11 years for Taib
instead of 25 years as Taib had requested.

32 Under s 4 of the Retirement and Re-employment Act (Cap 274A, 2012 Rev Ed),
the retirement age has been raised from 62 to 67. The defendant acknowledged
the possibility that the deceased would have supported his father more upon
his father’s retirement. However, when Taib reaches 67 years of age in nine
years’ time, the deceased (had he lived) would have been 30 years of age. The
defendant submitted that it was likely that the deceased would have been
married by 30, based on the fact that the plaintiff married at 28–29 years of
age. The deceased would then have decreased rather than increased his monthly
allowance to Taib. 26

##### Foot Note 26

Defendant’s written submissions at para 57.

Cases cited by the defendant in support of a reduced multiplier of 11 years
due to the possibility of the deceased’s marriage included the Court of
Appeal’s decision in Ho Yeow Kim v Lai Hai Kuen [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1068.

33 Based on [32] above and case law, the defendant arrived at a figure of
$19,681.68 for Taib’s claim with the following breakdown:

5 years x $200.00 per month | $12,000.00  
---|---  
6 years x $106.69 per month| $7,681.68  
Total| $19,681.68  
  
34 As for Norianah, the defendant submitted that there should be a reduced
multiplier of 15 years instead of 25 years. He accepted that a multiplicand of
$200 per month was correct but submitted there was no evidence to support the
additional $100 per month that the deceased allegedly gave to Norianah for
groceries. Nevertheless, the defendant was prepared to add half thereof (ie,
$50) to the $200 per month that the deceased gave to Norianah so that her
multiplicand was increased to $250 for 5 years but reduced to $200 thereafter.
The defendant submitted that Norianah should be awarded $39,000 based on the
following breakdown:

5 years x $250.00 per month| $15,000.00  
---|---  
10 years x $200.00 per month| $24,000.00  
Total| $39,000.00  
  
The issue

35 The issue before the court is whether the plaintiff’s dependency claim for
“loss” of the housing loan in items 10 and 11 at [4(b)] above is proven.

36 Harvey McGregor, McGregor on Damages (Sweet & Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) had
this to say (at pp 114–115, para 8-006):

For the determination of whether a defendant’s wrongful conduct is a cause in
fact of the damage to a claimant the test, which has almost universal
acceptance, is the so-called “but for” test. The defendant’s wrongful conduct
is a cause of the claimant’s harm if such harm would not have occurred without
it; “but for” it. This is the threshold which claimants must cross if their
claim for damages is going to get anywhere. Satisfying the cause in fact test
is in the vast multitude of cases a necessary condition of the imposition of
liability; it is by no means a sufficient condition because the all important
cause in law tests … must be satisfied as well.

The decision

The dependency claim

37 I shall deal first with the larger of the plaintiff’s claims, namely the
dependency claim. The dependency claim was made under s 20 of the Civil Law
Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), of which the relevant extracts state:

(1) If death is caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which is such
as would (if death has not ensued) have entitled the person injured to
maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the person who
would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action
for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured.

(2) Subject to section 21(2), every such action shall be for the benefit of
the dependants of the person (referred to in this section and in sections 21
and 22 as the deceased) whose death has been so caused.

(3) Every action brought under this section shall be brought by and in the
name of the executor or administrator of the deceased.

38 “Dependant” is defined under s 20(8) of the Act to include:

(b) any parent, grandparent or great-grandparent of the deceased.

39 Section 22 of the Act states:

Assessment of damages

22.—(1) In every action brought under section 20, the court may award such
damages as are proportioned to the losses resulting from the death to the
dependants respectively except that in assessing the damages there shall not
be taken into account —

(a) any sum paid or payable on the death of the deceased under any contract of
assurance or insurance;

(b) any sum payable as a result of the death under the Central Provident Fund
Act (Cap. 36); or

(c) any pension or gratuity which has been or will or may be paid as a result
of the death.

(1A) In assessing the damages under subsection (1), the court shall take into
account any moneys or other benefits which the deceased would be likely to
have given to the dependants by way of maintenance, gift, bequest or devise or
which the dependants would likely to have received by way of succession from
the deceased had the deceased lived beyond the date of the wrongful death.

…

Undoubtedly, Taib and Norianah as the deceased’s parents and his dependants
under s 20(8) of the Act are entitled to make this claim. The only issue is
determining the appropriate multiplier and multiplicand to be applied.

40 I note that the loss of the loan ($222,000) in the table at [4(b)] was the
largest sum claimed. The defendant’s closing submissions (at para 33) argued
that there was no “loss” within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Act for the
reason that Taib and Norianah were able to secure Fitri’s loan from the same
financier (Hong Leong) on 6 July 2015, one day before the deceased’s loan was
cancelled. Nor does a housing loan fall within the ambit of s 22(1A) of the
Act as it is not “any moneys or other benefits which the deceased would be
likely to have given to the dependants by way of maintenance, gift, bequest or
devise or which the dependants would likely to have received by way of
succession from the deceased had the deceased lived beyond the date of the
wrongful death”. Further, Taib and Norianah were able to purchase the Block
708 flat as they had planned and are currently occupying it. In actual fact
the loan was a debt and not a benefit as it created a legal liability to repay
the debt by monthly instalments.

41 Bearing in mind the extract from McGregor on Damages at [36] above and
applying the “but for” test, the dependency claim of $222,000 is not proven.
There was no “loss” within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Act due to the
cancellation of the deceased’s loan by Hong Leong as the same was replaced by
Fitri’s loan. I acknowledge that Fitri’s loan was for a shorter period, a
lesser amount and on less favourable terms. Even so, there was no “loss” as
the fact sheets for both loans 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

At AB30 and AB83 dated 9 March 2015 and 3 July 2015 respectively.

showed that the deceased’s loan would have incurred interest due to Hong Leong
totalling $88,725 as against $56,641 payable on Fitri’s loan. Additionally,
how can the interest saved of $88,725 be a “loss”? The “loss” of that interest
would have been suffered by Hong Leong.

42 As for Taib’s claim for loss of support of $108,000, the defendant’s
submission that it was unsubstantiated was never put to either Taib or
Norianah in the course of cross-examination. Indeed, cross-examination of the
couple 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

Notes of Evidence, 4 July 2017, pp 15–16.

by counsel for the defendant was premised on the basis that the deceased gave
them a total sum of $500 every month. Consequently, based on the principle in
Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 HL, the court accepts that the deceased gave $200
to Taib and $300 per month to Norianah.

43 Using a multiplier of 10 instead of 11 years and a multiplicand of $200
(inclusive of the extra $106.69 he has to pay every month to help service
Fitri’s loan), Taib is awarded the sum of $24,000 ($200 x 10 years x 12
months).

44 In the case of Norianah, the applicable multiplicand would be $300 per
month ($500 less $200 for Taib). The defendant’s proposal of a multiplier of
15 years (see [34] above) is not unreasonable. Accordingly, I award her
$54,000 ($300 x 15 years x 12 months).

45 The claims for housing rental and moving fees of $1,600 and $500
respectively are disallowed. The defendant rightly pointed out that there was
no justification for either claim. In relation to the housing rental, Taib’s
AEIC exhibited a letter dated 11 May 2015 which stated that the HDB had
acceded to Taib’s request and granted him a temporary extension of stay of
three months from the date of completion of the sale (3 July 2015) of the
Block 708 flat. 29

That meant that Taib and his family could have stayed at the flat until 3
October 2015. Yet Taib purportedly rented the Woodlands Crescent flat for one
month (8 August to 7 September 2015). 30

Why? Neither the plaintiff nor Taib provided any explanation or reason.

The estate’s claim

46 As for the table at [4(a)], the court upholds the objection of the
defendant to the plaintiff’s claim in item 3 of $2,895 for storage charges of
the motorcycle as it was neither pleaded nor claimed in the statement of
claim. For the same reason, other claims made in the plaintiff’s closing
submissions such as loss of stamp duty and legal expenses are also rejected.
Factually and legally, such items are not claimable.

47 In regard to pain and suffering in item 6, I accept the defendant’s figure
of $2,500 as the deceased’s pain and suffering was short-lived. Based on the
testimony of Dr Goo, the deceased was unconscious by the time he arrived at
KTPH, about 28 minutes after the accident. Dr Goo testified that the deceased
did not regain consciousness before his demise the following morning.

48 The defendant objected to the quantum of the bill of the estate’s
solicitors in obtaining letters of administration. As the sum claimed of
$5,745.60 was substantiated by the bill produced in exhibit MHBI-5 of the
plaintiff’s AEIC, the defendant’s counter-proposal of $3,500 is rejected. The
full sum claimed is allowed.

Conclusion

49 Consequently, the plaintiff’s claims which are allowed total $104,291.64
(based on 90% liability) as shown in the following breakdown:

1| Towage fee for motorcycle| $70.00  
---|---|---  
2| Total loss of motorcycle | $13,714.00  
3| Funeral expenses| $850.00  
4| Cost of extracting letters of administration | $5,745.60  
5| Pain & suffering| $2,500.00  
6| Bereavement | $15,000.00  
7| Taib’s loss of support | $24,000.00  
8| Norianah’s loss of support| $54,000.00  
Total | $115,879.60 x 90% = $104,291.64  
  
50 The plaintiff is awarded statutory interest at 5.33% on items 1 to 6 of the
estate’s claim, namely $34,091.64 (90% x $37,879.60).

51 The award of $104,291.64 to the plaintiff is far below the jurisdiction of
the High Court. The court shall hear parties on the issue before determining
the costs to be awarded to the plaintiff.
