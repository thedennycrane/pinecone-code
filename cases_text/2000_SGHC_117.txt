Banking – Letters of credit – Negotiable credit – Deferred payment credit –

disposed off summarily  
  

: The question that I had to decide in this originating summons was whether a
particular letter of credit issued by the defendant bank and negotiated by the
plaintiff bank was, on its true construction, a deferred payment credit or a
negotiation credit.  
  
The matter arose in the following way. On 21 March 1999, the Dubai branch of
the defendant sent a telex to the plaintiff`s Singapore branch stating that
the defendant had opened an irrevocable letter of credit for up to
US$1,333,600 in favour of a Singapore company, Amerorient Pte Ltd
(`Amerorient`) on the instructions of Solo Industries Ltd of Sharjah, in the
United Arab Emirates.

**_The course of events_ **

****

On 26 March 1999, the plaintiff sent the defendant a letter stating that it
had advised the content of the credit to the beneficiary, Amerorient, and had
added its confirmation to the credit. In the same letter, the plaintiff gave
particulars of the credit and stated that it was for an amount of US$1,333,600
which was `available by def payment`.  
  
On the same day, 26 March 1999, the plaintiff negotiated the letter of credit
and made payment to Amerorient of the amount of US$1,333,466.64.
Contemporaneously it sent to the defendant two documents each entitled
`Covering Schedule - Export Bills`. Under cover of each of these schedules,
the plaintiff forwarded to the defendant all the documents called for under
the letter of credit including two drafts. Each draft was for the sum of
US$654,264.16. There was a box at the top of each covering schedule. This box
was divided into four compartments bearing the following headings, viz `Our
reference`, `L/C Number`, `Amount` and `Tenor`. In each box entitled `Tenor`,
the plaintiff inserted the words `180 days fr Date of nego- due on 21 Sept
99`. The plaintiff had obtained the due date of each payment by the defendant
by taking 180 days from 26 March 1999. Each schedule also requested the
defendant to please confirm the maturity date as soon as possible by tested
telex or SWIFT.  
  
On 31 March 1999, the defendant sent the plaintiff two telexes, one referring
to each of the two sets of documents forwarded to it by the plaintiff. The two
telexes were in practically identical terms and after giving the relevant
reference numbers each stated `Documents for USD654,264.16 accepted to mature
for payment on 21 Sept 99 ... On the said date, we will remit proceed as per
your instructions`.  
  
On 22 April 1999, the defendant sent the plaintiff a telex requesting copies
of the bills of lading and invoices for its internal audit purposes, by fax as
well as by courier. The plaintiff complied with this request by faxing out
copies on 26 April and couriering the hard copies of the documents on 27
April.  
  
Nothing further happened until 25 May 1999 when the defendant sent the
plaintiff a telex advising the plaintiff that `by reason of a serious fraud
suspicion, [the plaintiff] would not be in a position to effect ... payment`
under the letter of credit. The defendant went on to say that the plaintiff
should retain and refuse any payment to any beneficiary under the credit until
further notice from the defendant and that any payment that had been effected
by the plaintiff would be deemed by the defendant to have been done by the
plaintiff `under [its] own and exclusive responsibility only`. The plaintiff
responded the next day and asserted that it had confirmed and negotiated
documents in strict compliance with the terms of the credit and that on the
due date the defendant was to effect payment according to the plaintiff`s
instructions as the defendant had itself confirmed by its tested telexes in
March.  
  
The defendant did not pay the plaintiff on 21 September 1999 or thereafter.
The basis of this refusal was that there had been fraud by the beneficiary and
as such fraud was discovered before the maturity date no payment was due. This
action was commenced by the plaintiff in January this year to enforce
recovery.  
  
**_The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (`UCP`)_**

****

The letter of credit was subject to the UCP (1993 Revision ICC No 500). For
the purposes of this case, the relevant articles are arts 9 and 10. These
reflect the four types of letters of credit recognised in the UCP. I am
concerned with only two of these types: the negotiation credit and the
deferred payment credit. The portions of arts 9 and 10 which are relevant to
these types of credit are set out below:

> _Article 9_

> _Liability of Issuing and Confirming Banks_

> _
>
> a An irrevocable Credit constitutes a definite undertaking of the Issuing
> Bank, provided that the stipulated documents are presented to the Nominated

> ii If the Credit provides for deferred payment - to pay on the maturity
> date(s) determinable in accordance with stipulations of the Credit;
>

**_Distinction between deferred payment credit and negotiable credit_ **

****

As can be seen from the articles of the UCP quoted above, a deferred payment
letter of credit is one whereunder the beneficiary of the credit only receives
payment at the maturity of the credit. Thus, it is the obligation of the
issuing bank and the confirming bank (in the case of a confirmed credit, as is
the case here) to pay the beneficiary at maturity. This position was accepted
by Langley J in the English case of **Banco Santander SA v Bayfern Ltd & Ors**
(Unreported) , decided in the Queen`s Bench Division of the High Court on 9
June 1999) whose decision was subsequently upheld on appeal.  
  
The **_Banco Santander_** case also confirmed that a bank which confirms a
deferred payment letter of credit has no authority from the issuing bank to
make payment to the beneficiary by way of a discount or an advance ahead of
the maturity of the credit. It may do so but such an arrangement is strictly
between itself and the beneficiary and does not bind the issuing bank. Where
there is fraud on the beneficiary`s part therefore, a confirming bank which
has discounted or advanced money prior to the maturity date of the credit
bears the risk of the fraud. It cannot seek reimbursement from the issuing
bank. Langley J stated the proposition as follows:

> _The basic authority given by the issuing bank to the confirming bank in a
> deferred payment letter of credit is to pay at maturity. The consequent
> obligation to reimburse is to reimburse on payment being made at maturity.
> If at that time there is established fraud, there is no obligation on the
> confirming bank to pay nor on the issuing bank to reimburse._

  
  
A negotiable letter of credit on the other hand entitles the negotiating bank
to buy over or otherwise give value for the documents and drafts drawn by the
beneficiary and present these under the credit in its own name to the issuing
bank, for payment at maturity. See **_Documentary Credits_** by Raymond Jack
at p 135. Unlike in the situation of a deferred payment credit, a negotiating
bank is permitted to make payment to the beneficiary without waiting for
maturity of the credit. It buys over the documents on presentation and that is
the essence of negotiation. Fraud on the beneficiary`s part does not affect a
negotiating bank unless the negotiating bank is itself a party to or has
knowledge of the fraud.  
  
**_The defendant`s stand_**

****

The defendant took two approaches to the action. Its first approach was to
contend that the credit in question had to be construed as a deferred payment
credit rather than a negotiation credit and since there was a suspicion of
fraud on the part of the beneficiary, there would have to be a trial before it
could be established whether it was liable to reimburse the plaintiff.
Secondly, the defendant contended that there were various questions of fact
which arose in this case which could not be resolved by way of an originating
summons and that the matter must go to trial.  
  
**_What kind of credit did the defendant issue?_**

****

In **Sinotani Pacific Pte Ltd v Agricultural Bank of China** [1999] 4 SLR 34 ,
the Court of Appeal had to decide whether the letter of credit involved in
that case was a negotiation credit. It held that this issue had to be decided
by construing the credit. In finding that the credit in that case was not a
negotiation credit, Goh Joon Seng J, who delivered the judgment of the court
stated (at [para ] 17):

> _We also found that the credit was a straight, as opposed to a negotiation,
> credit. Whether or not a letter of credit allows for negotiation is a matter
> of construing the credit. See**Documentary Credits** (supra), para 2.25. A
> typical example of the wording used in a negotiation credit would be as
> follows:_

> _`We [the issuing bank] hereby engage with drawers and/or bona fide holders
> that drafts drawn and negotiated in conformity with the terms of the credit
> will be honoured by us and that drafts accepted with[in] the terms of this
> credit will be duly honoured at maturity.`**(Chinsim Trading (Pte) Ltd v
> Indian Bank** [1993] 2 SLR 144  at 146.)_

> _If the words used in a letter of credit are unclear, the courts are
> generally reluctant to treat it as a negotiation credit. See**Southern Ocean
> Shipbuilding Co Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG** [1993] 3 SLR 686 . In the
> present case, although Condition 47A.5 as well as the evidence of the
> respondent`s witnesses in their affidavits of evidence-in-chief suggested
> that the parties did intend negotiation to be available under the credit,
> albeit only with RBC, we noted that the respondent`s payment undertaking in
> Condition 78 ([para ] 4, supra) did not expressly extend to bona fide
> holders of drafts drawn under the credit, contrary to the wording usually
> used in negotiation credits (supra). Furthermore, the application form for
> the letter of credit did not state that the credit was to be available by
> negotiation, even though this could easily have been done. Instead, the form
> simply provided that the credit was to be available by acceptance of
> drafts._

  
  
I noted from the above that in my task of construing the credit here I should
be reluctant to treat it as a negotiation credit if the words in it were
unclear.  
  
In my view, the proper construction of this credit showed it to be a
negotiation credit. In construing a letter of credit, as in the construction
of any other contract, one must look at the document as a whole and not at
certain phrases in isolation. In this connection, the most important sentence
in the credit was the one near its beginning which stated `Available against
presentation of drafts at 180 days from the date of negotiation by deferred
credit`. The fact that the words `deferred credit` appeared in that sentence
did not in my mind detract from the vital points that in order to obtain
payment under the credit, drafts would have to be presented for payment to be
made 180 days from the time those drafts had been negotiated. Drafts in
themselves are negotiable instruments and the inference to be drawn from the
use of the word `drafts` instead of documents was reinforced by the use of the
word `negotiation` in the same sentence. It appeared to me that the words
`deferred payment` were a reflection of the fact that the drafts would not be
payable at sight but only after 180 days. They were surplusage but could not
detract from the main meaning of the sentence. This interpretation was
supported by the further references to negotiation which appeared in special
condition 4 and special condition 7. In the latter case, the confirming bank
(ie the plaintiff) was expressly instructed that it was not to negotiate under
reserve without prior reference to the consent of the issuing bank (ie the
defendant). There would have been no need for this instruction had it not been
anticipated that negotiation would take place.  
  
Counsel for the defendant argued that the words of the credit were ambiguous
and that the plaintiff should have asked for clarification before seeking to
negotiate the credit. I did not agree that the addition of the words `deferred
payment` at the end of the sentence which dealt with how the credit could be
drawn on made the credit ambiguous when the weight of the credit when
construed as a whole showed it to be a negotiation credit. I was also not
impressed with the argument that it could not be a negotiation credit because
of the absence of the undertaking to engage with drawers that the drafts drawn
and negotiated in conformity with the credit would be duly honoured at
maturity. No doubt the absence of that undertaking influenced the Court of
Appeal in Sinotani`s case but the provision there which dealt with the
availability of the credit did not refer to negotiation at all but simply
stated that the credit was available `by acceptance` and drafts drawn would be
honoured on presentation at the bank and drafts accepted within the terms of
the credit would be honoured at maturity. The only reference to negotiation
there was in the context of negotiation by a specific bank, the Royal Bank of
Canada, and the dispute in the Sinotani case did not involve negotiation. It
was a dispute between a beneficiary and an issuing bank. In the present case,
the wording of the credit was clear enough to indicate its negotiability even
without the presence of the undertaking.  
  
It should also be noted that after the plaintiff had negotiated the documents
against two drafts, each for US$654,264.16, it sent each draft accompanied by
the relevant documents to the defendant under cover of a schedule which stated
that the tenor of the drafts was `180 days fr date of nego- due on 21 Sept
99`. That was clear notice to the defendant that the plaintiff had negotiated
the drafts. It was also clear that the date of maturity had been determined by
counting 180 days from the date of negotiation. Yet the defendant did not
respond in any way to notify the plaintiff that the credit was not a
negotiation credit or to say that the 180 days should be counted from the date
of presentation of the documents rather than from negotiation even if
negotiation had taken place. Instead, the defendant replied about a week later
to say that the documents had been accepted to mature for payment on 21
September thereby accepting the manner in which the maturity date had been
calculated and indicating no objection to that manner.  
  
Counsel for the defendant did argue that the word `negotiation` in the opening
part of the letter of credit should be read as `presentation`. His only basis
to support this argument was that as it was uncertain whether the letter of
credit would be negotiated, the word `negotiation` must mean `presentation`
otherwise the date of payment could not be determined. I considered this
argument a non-starter. Even where a letter of credit is admittedly negotiable
and the maturity date is determined from the date of negotiation, such an
uncertainty would be present, but such uncertainty could not and would not
change the nature of the letter of credit. If the defendant`s argument was
correct, it would mean that all letters of credit must stipulate that the date
of payment is to be calculated solely from the date of presentation of
documents. This proposition is not supported by authority.  
  
In **_Sinotani_** , the court considered that the single reference to drafts
being accepted was not sufficient to make the credit available for negotiation
although drafts are negotiable instruments. In that case, however, the point
was not raised as to what would have happened if a draft had been accepted by
the issuing bank vis-Ã -vis a holder in due course for example the negotiating
bank, and fraud by the beneficiary was subsequently discovered. This question
was not raised because the dispute in **_Sinotani_** was not between the
negotiating bank and the issuing bank. It was, however, mentioned by Justice
Langley in **_Banco Santander SA_** and he opined that a holder in due course
would be entitled to payment irrespective of any fraud subsequently being
discovered. This principle was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.  
  
In dealing with the construction of the credit, counsel for the defendant
referred me to the application form submitted to the defendant for the letter
of credit. This stated that the applicant required a deferred payment credit
and did not mention anything about negotiability. In **_Sinotani_** , the
Court of Appeal referred to the application form for the letter of credit and
used that form to bolster its construction of the credit in that case. In the
present case, it was not suggested that the plaintiff was aware of the terms
of the application form and as such I saw no reason to use it as an aid in
construing the credit when the terms of the credit were clear enough. In any
case, it is not the practice to forward to an advising or confirming bank the
application for the letter of credit together with the credit. The credit is
intended to, and must, stand alone as the contractual document between the
issuing bank and the beneficiary or the confirming bank as the case may be. As
such, the credit must be construed on its own without reference to documents
which are not part of it. No doubt courts can and do take into account
surrounding circumstances in the construction of contracts. This principle has
a very limited application however, in my view, to the situation of a letter
of credit as it has to be applied in the light of the other well established
principle that letters of credit are independent of the underlying contractual
arrangements which they are intended to support. In my opinion, as between the
issuing bank and a confirming/negotiating bank, the only circumstances that
are relevant to the construction of a credit are the terms of the credit and
the correspondence between the banks, if any, in relation to that credit.  
  
The defendant`s own conduct appeared to indicate that before May 1999, it
either took the view that the credit was a negotiation credit or was content
for the plaintiff to act according to such a notion without feeling any
necessity to set the plaintiff straight. Quite apart from the reference to
negotiation on the schedules, the original invoices sent to the defendant by
the plaintiff indicated that payment terms were 180 days from negotiation.
These documents were among those that the defendant accepted without demur on
31 March 1999. Even in April 1999 when it was sent further copies of the
documents by the plaintiff, no hue and cry was raised on the various
indications that the credit was treated as a negotiation credit.  
  
**_Were there questions of fact to be tried?_**

****

The plaintiff exhibited a credit advice of its payment to Amerorient. Counsel
for the defendant submitted that this was not sufficient evidence of payment.
To support his argument, he referred to copies of other credit advices from
the plaintiff which the defendant had obtained from the records of Amerorient.
His point was that each of these other credit advices contained two signatures
whereas the one exhibited in the plaintiff`s affidavit did not have those
signatures.  
  
Yet counsel for the defendant stopped short of stating what the defendant`s
position was. While he insinuated that the credit advice exhibited by the
plaintiff was a forgery, he did not go so far as to assert this. The plaintiff
submitted in reply that it was not sufficient for the defendant`s counsel to
point to documents here and there without stating what the defendant`s
position was. If the defendant did not have enough evidence to assert a
position then there was no dispute. I agreed. Further, the defendant itself
did not cast any aspersion on the authenticity of the evidence produced by the
plaintiff. It could have done so through the affidavits filed on its behalf.
Whilst counsel is entitled to present arguments to advance his client`s case,
it is not open to him to try and advance a position which is not taken by his
client.  
  
In any case, I accepted that the exhibited credit advice read together with
the affirmations made in the affidavits filed on behalf of the plaintiff could
be and were sufficient evidence of payment by the plaintiff to Amerorient if
the document was authentic. There was no evidence before me which was capable
of casting any doubt on the authenticity of that credit advice. Further, the
credit advices which were exhibited by the defendant were copies of the
original documents found in Amerorient`s records whereas the one exhibited by
the plaintiff was the file copy retained by the plaintiff for its own records.
It is not necessary for the file copy to be signed. Other issues on payment
raised by the defence, I found to be quibbles.  
  
Another issue raised by the counsel for the defence was in relation to a
scrutiny note which the plaintiff had sent to Amerorient on 26 March 1999
after Amerorient had presented the documents for negotiation under the credit.
That document shows that the plaintiff returned the documents to Amerorient
and asked for some amendments to be made to them. The point made by counsel
was that the documents were in fact negotiated on 26 March itself and he was
querying whether such amendments could actually have been effected on the same
day as negotiation took place. This seemed to me to be a non-issue. If parties
act fast enough (and in the case of negotiation of a letter of credit they
have full incentive to do so) they can amend their documents within a few
hours. It is simply a question of logistics and determination. In this case
the amendments required were not even substantial ones.  
  
Counsel for the defence also pointed out an alleged discrepancy between the
documents as presented and the requirements of the credit. This arose, he
submitted, because item 7 under the heading `Documents Required` on the
credit, required the shipping marks on the bill of lading to be ? SIL SHJ? and
though the marks SIL SHJ did in fact appear on the bills of lading they
appeared without the question marks indicated in the credit. This was the
discrepancy that was not corrected and still existed.  
  
I did not find much substance in this argument. In the first place, the
alleged discrepancy seemed to me to be deminimis in that the original
insertion of the question marks in the credit itself was probably a
typographical error. One does not really expect to see a bill of lading with
question marks beside the shipping marks. As counsel for the plaintiff
submitted, that would cast serious doubts on the bill of lading.  
  
Secondly, the shipping documents as well as the bills of exchange had been
forwarded by the plaintiff to the defendant in March 1999. If there was a
discrepancy, it was for the defendant to say so. It never made such an
allegation. On the contrary, by its two telex responses of 31 March 1999, the
defendant accepted the documents as forwarded. By the time the matter came
before me, it was really too late for the defendant to attempt to reject the
documents at this stage. See **_Southern Ocean Shipbuilding Co Pte Ltd v
Deutsche Bank AG_**. In any case, the defendant itself did not put forward
such a position in its affidavit.  
  
The scrutiny note itself showed that at the relevant time, the plaintiff had
considered the payment terms to be 180 days of negotiation. One of the
amendments requested by, and effected pursuant to, the scrutiny note, was that
the invoices were amended to state the payment terms as being `180 days from
the date of negotiation`. These invoices were sent to the defendant together
with the schedules and as noted earlier, were accepted in toto by the
defendant. It did not appear to me that the scrutiny note indicated any
factual issues that had to be tried.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

After hearing the arguments I was satisfied that the credit was a negotiation
credit and that the defendant was legally obliged to reimburse the plaintiff
at maturity the amounts paid out by the plaintiff when it negotiated the
credit. I did not find any reason why the issues could not be disposed of
summarily and should instead be sent for trial. I accordingly gave judgment in
favour of the plaintiff. I should add that I did not find it necessary to
consider the plaintiff`s alternative arguments on the defendant`s liability to
pay it as holder in due course of the drafts since I was satisfied that
liability under the credit had been established.  
  
**Outcome:**

Plaintiff`s claim allowed.
