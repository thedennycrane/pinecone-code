High Court — HCF/Divorce (Transferred) No 793 of 2015

15 November 2018 Judgment reserved

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The plaintiff married the defendant on 6 March 1990 and they have three
children, a daughter who is 25 years old, a son who is 21 and another son who
will be 21 on 29 January next year. The plaintiff is 55 years old, and the
defendant is 56. After two unsuccessful attempts, the plaintiff finally
obtained a divorce on 24 March 2016, on the ground that she and the defendant
had separated and lived apart since 28 June 2010.

2 The defendant was practising as a doctor in his own clinic during the
marriage. The plaintiff is an accountant by training but she worked in the
defendant’s clinic after she married him. Both of them are now unemployed,
after the defendant closed his clinic when divorce proceedings began. The
present proceedings before me concerns the division of their matrimonial
assets and the custody of the younger son. All three children have been living
with the defendant since custody was granted to him. They are happy with this
arrangement. Having interviewed the daughter and the younger son, I am of the
view that the interim custody order should continue so far as the youngest
child is concerned since he is the only one below the age of 21, and even he
will be 21 in about three months’ time. There will be no custody orders for
the adult children.

3 The issue of division of assets is the more difficult one. The main problem
is that the defendant claims that much of the assets acquired were from money
left to him by his parents, but there is no evidence of what his inheritance
was. His father died in 1989 and his mother 2000. The defendant’s mother’s
estate thus might have included inheritance from his father, but the defendant
had produced no evidence of the value of either his father’s estate or his
mother’s. His counsel, Mr Ong, stated that it was a long time ago and no
evidence of the precise amount was available. Mr Ong submitted that the
defendant received 45% of his mother’s estate, but no evidence of the value of
that 45% was adduced. Despite attempts by the court to investigate, counsel
says that it would be an impossible task as the defendant is unable to provide
the specific figures. Mr Ong submitted that the defendant received $315,000 in
1985 as a gift; $49,635.96 worth of shares in the HSBC Bank, $44,526 in shares
in Straits Trading; $9,300 in OCBC shares.

4 Several properties were purchased in the course of the marriage. The initial
matrimonial home was in Pender Court, a property purchased in March 1986 for
$315,000. They then bought a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) shop at
Bukit Batok for $850,099.88 which they used as a clinic for the defendant as
well as a shop selling bubble tea (managed by the plaintiff). They moved to 74
Eng Kong Place in October 1995, a house bought for $1,820,000. When the
marriage broke up, the defendant and the children moved to 39 Lorong Pisang
Raja, purchased for $3,260,000. There were several properties overseas:

(a) The following was purchased in joint names:

(i) Liang Feng Mansion, Unit 26F in Shanghai, China.

(b) The following were purchased in plaintiff’s sole name:

(i) Bukit OUG, Unit A1-5-8 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and

(ii) Sun Island Club, Unit B#119D1 in Shanghai, China.

(c) The following were purchased in defendant’s sole name:

(i) Wadihana, Unit #15-08 in Johor Bahru, Malaysia;

(ii) Regalia, Unit B-18-E in Shanghai, China;

(iii) Hai Hong Plaza, Unit 15G in Shanghai, China; and

(iv) Sun Island Club, Units B#117-D1 and B#118-D1 in Shanghai, China.

Mr Ong conceded that there is no dispute that these properties were purchased
but he submitted that they were largely purchased from the defendant’s
inherited money. The plaintiff says that she has no details of the foreign
properties save that the defendant bought them. She does not have details even
of those properties in her name because they were acquired by the defendant,
and all documents were sent to him. The husband has been singularly unhelpful
in denying that he still has any of the properties previously bought in his
own name, and at the same time, refusing to provide any account beyond the
bare assertion that he no longer owns any of them. For convenience, I will set
out the assets in a consolidated table.

6 The plaintiff contributed little financially from her own income for the
purchase of the matrimonial assets for the simple reason that she had not
worked anywhere except at the defendant’s clinic. She worked there as the
clinic manager, doing the administration as well as running the bubble tea
shop that the defendant set up in the clinic itself.

7 In terms of non-financial contribution for looking after the home, it seems
to me that both the plaintiff and defendant looked after the children equally.
The children were sufficiently bonded with the defendant to be willing to live
with him when he separated from the plaintiff, though they do not speak ill of
the plaintiff at all. I will therefore find that both shared equally in the
non-financial contributions to the home and children.

8 The plaintiff says that she was paid only $6,000 working for the defendant.
I am of the view that she worked not just as an employee, but also as a
spouse, working jointly with the other, and that being the case, it is my view
that proceeds from all matrimonial ventures, such as this, ought to be shared
equally. Couples walk jointly into a marriage as equals, work at it as equals,
and if the marriage fails, they should not be heard to claim more than the
other. Marriage is for the better or the worse. That vow should not be turned
merely into a business account upon divorce.

9 The undisputed fact is that Pender Court was the first property owned by the
couple. The defendant claims that it was purchased from the money he inherited
from his parents. I have tremendous difficulty finding how much he inherited
because he offered no evidence save the grim fact that his father died a year
before the defendant married the plaintiff and that ten years into the
marriage, the defendant’s mother died. What is clear is that the plaintiff
contributed little towards the purchase price of Pender Court, and so I will
assume that the defendant contributed the bulk of it. In the absence of
evidence from the defendant, I will round off his financial contribution of
this property to an equivalent of 65% (or 70%). Since the defendant had been
helping the defendant in his clinic, in addition to her non-financial
contribution towards the running of the home, I would award her a 50% of
Pender Court. Pender Court has since been sold in a collective sale in
November 2010, and the defendant received proceeds of S$1,893,541.97. The
proceeds are no longer identifiable.

10 As to the other assets subsequently acquired, again, in the absence of
evidence from the defendant, it seems to me that the assets could reasonably
have been paid for through the income from the clinic and bubble tea shop run
by the plaintiff and the defendant. I accept the plaintiff’s claim that the
defendant was wholly in charge of the finances and all documentation of the
income earned. I also find that the defendant incorporated TCAPL purely to
hold his interests in the shares in the two companies, TBL and TTL. I am of
the view that the defendant had managed his tax liability sufficiently well so
that his income tax liability does not accurately reflect his financial
ability to acquire the real properties in and outside Singapore. For
completeness, given the timing, I accept that the defendant’s shares in TBL
and TLL were gifts from his late father, and are therefore not marital assets.

11 In sum, it seems to me that much of the assets owned by the plaintiff and
the defendant today comes from the clinic, and that was a joint matrimonial
venture. Ordinarily, it would follow that the plaintiff should be entitled to
50% of the pool of marital assets. In respect of Pender Court, although it
pre-dated the clinic, I would also have awarded the plaintiff 50% of its value
for the reason stated above. An adjustment must be made in view of the severe
difficulties in identifying, and ascertaining the true value, of these assets.
These are matters which the defendant could have shed light on, yet he has not
done so. I am, therefore, compelled to draw an adverse inference against him.
To compensate for the absence of information as to the full extent of assets
held by the defendant, I am of the view that a fair order is for all
ascertainable assets to be sold and divided in the ratio of 75% to the
plaintiff, and 25% to the defendant. There will be no order as to costs.
