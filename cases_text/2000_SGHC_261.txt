Prosecution Case

2\. The Prosecution adduced evidence showing that on the evening of 14th
January 2000, the owner residents of 25 Jalan Ketumbit a semi-detached house
left Singapore for an overseas trip. The only person remaining in the house
were their infant son Wong Shi Hao (‘Shi Hao’) and their maid Fredelina
Evangelista Manuel (‘the Complainant’). Shi Hao after watching television at
night, went to sleep in his parents’ master-bedroom. The Complainant said she
slept in the maid’s room as usual that night.

The Complainant testified that at about 4.00 am she was awakened by a tap on
her shoulder. She then felt something poking into her neck. A man spoke in
Malay to her and told her not to scream or run away and if she does he will
kill her. He then asked her to take off her clothes and to do what was asked
of her. As she was scared, she removed her clothing, a long-sleeved shirt and
a pair of yellow pants and panties pleading with the Accused not to do it and
she identified the man to be the Accused, both in Court and earlier at an
identification parade. She stated that when the Accused was about to leave her
room through a window she saw his features against the light coming through
her window from a neighbouring house as there were some lights on in the
house. The owner of the neighbouring house later testified to say that they
normally left the lights on at night to light up their compound.

3\. The Accused then took off his clothes went on top of her body and told her
to open her legs. The rest of the account may best be put in her own words:-

> ‘….And he go and hold my legs to open up my legs wider and he inserted his
> penis into my vagina and he dig it in and out. After he did it, after he get
> exhausted, he lay down on the bed and asked me to go on top of him and he
> even told me that I will put his penis into my mouth. He asked me to sit
> down beside him while he was lying down and he told me he was going to put
> his penis into my mouth. I did it because I am very, very frightened. After
> I did the oral sex, he asked me again to lie down on the bed. Then he went
> on top of me again and inserted his penis into my vagina. After the second
> time of going on top of me, when he get exhausted again, he asked me again
> to lie down. He lie down on the bed and he asked me to do the oral sex
> again, second time ….
>
> …..After the second oral sex, he asked me to lie down again. He got up and
> went on top of me again and he thrust in and out his penis into my vagina.
> After the third time of ---he went on top of me and thrust in and out, he
> got up and lay down again on bed and asked me---and told me that he want to
> lick my vagina and asked me to sit down, put my vagina on his mouth. After
> he was licking my vagina, after that performance, I get up, I stand up and I
> wanted to take a rubber band for my hair, ponytail for my hair and I was
> having thoughts that I wanted to run away form him but he did follow me.
>
> ….After that he lie down again on the bed and asked me that I will put his
> penis into my mouth and perform oral sex on him the third time. When he did
> ask me to perform oral sex, I was still sitting beside him. I was reluctant
> to do it again on him and he told me if I don’t do it on him, he again
> threatened me that he would kill me and he did place the knife on my back. I
> was frightened. So I complied to his instructions to perform the oral sex
> the third time. After that he asked me to sit down beside him and he started
> masturbating. When I sit beside him, he asked me to---and he started
> masturbating, he even told me that when he is going to ejaculate and the
> sperm will come out, he asked me to put my mouth into his penis and suck the
> sperm but I refused to open my mouth. When he ejaculated, he forced my head
> on to his---my mouth on to his penis and I did not open my mouth until the
> sperm rubbed on my face. I used my hand to wipe it out and I cleaned it on
> my legs and on the bedsheets or pillow, on my pillows.
>
> ….After he ejaculated, he asked me about my wallet. I told him, "Why? I
> don’t have any money" and he told me "Just take your wallet". And after that
> I noticed that my neighbours on the light, I sensed that my neighbours’
> light was on.
>
> ……….He put on his clothes and he asked me again to take my wallet. I took my
> wallet and he asked me to put it on my bed.
>
> …….After that, after I took my wallet from my cabinet, I placed my wallet on
> my bed and I sit on my bed as well. When I was sitting on my bed and he was
> still putting on his clothes, I can see his face and his built. And when he
> finished putting on his clothes, he told me to open the window. When I
> opened the window, he told me to sit down on my bed and face the wall. He
> told me to face the wall so that I won’t see him if he goes off.
>
> …..So I sat down on my bed and just faced the wall because that’s his
> instructions.
>
> …..After he gave me instructions to face the wall---sit down on my bed and
> face the wall, I sensed that he took money from my wallet and I felt that he
> went out from the window.
>
> …..Before I went out of my room, I checked my wallet and the money was gone.
>
> ….It was $50 of $10 notes; five $10 notes.
>
> ….After checking my wallet, I went out from my room and went to my
> employer’s son’s room to check whether he’s still sleeping. I went into my
> employer’s master bedroom and I went to check all the windows and the doors
> are all closed.
>
> …It was all closed. After checking all the doors and windows, I went in
> again to my employer’s son’s room, into the master bedroom, and wake him up
> because I do not know what to do. When I went to the master bedroom and wake
> up my employer’s son, I thought of checking the master bedroom toilet, and I
> saw the master bedroom toilet window open. I saw the master bedroom toilet
> open.
>
> ……….Yes, your Honour. After I have checked the window, the master bedroom
> toilet window was opened, I went back to wake up Shi Hao. I wake him up, at
> the same time I was really crying."

3.1 Apart from the above evidence, the Complainant stated that she always kept
a brush with a long handle and a shampoo tube and other such objects for use
in the bathroom on the bathroom’s window sill.

3.2 Defence Counsel put to the Complainant that the Accused had been
introduced to her by one Colin in December 1999 and they knew each other and
thereafter had consensual sexual intercourse before and after the 15th January
2000 at 4.00 am on which occasion Colin had taken her to the said residence.
He also put to her that consensual sexual intercourse had taken place apart
from 15th January 2000:

> (i) in December 1999 just after Christmas in her room at the Ketumbit
> residence when he accompanied Colin there for the first time;
>
> (ii)` in early January 2000 at the same place and
>
> (iii) on 17th March 2000 at about past 3.00 am at the Balestier Hotel after
> they had a drink at Ipanema bar on the 16th night.

The Complainant denied that the Accused had come with Colin on any occasion to
her room or that she had sexual intercourse with him on any of the other
occasions as put. The Complainant also denied that the Accused ejaculated in
her vagina as she did not feel the ejaculation. She did not feel a condom
being used. The Accused, according to her, masturbated and ejaculated outside
in her face. She denied that the Accused had thrown the condom in the waste
paper basket. She denied she had washed up before the police came save that
she had brushed her teeth and washed around the mouth region. When it was put
to her that she had told a police officer that she had showered, she stated
that she had only told him that she had changed her clothing. She also denied
that a cap found in the room had been previously given to her by the Accused.
Importantly she denied she had requested $5,000/- from him after the sexual
intercourse as a loan because she needed the money back home. She also denied
when it was put to her that the Accused did not commit robbery of $50/- from
her wallet. When asked how she could identify him in the darkness of the room,
she re-stressed that she saw him in the light coming in from the neighbouring
house through her window where the Accused stood and his built was slightly
small. She agreed she was shown five photographs by the police before and she
identified him by a photograph before picking him out at the identification
parade through a one way mirror.

4\. The Complainant stated that after that she telephoned Diana Yee Yuet Wah
(‘Diana Yee’), PW10, a previous employee of her employers whom she had known
for some years and told her that someone had come into the house and she cried
as she talked and she was told by Diana Yee that she would be coming over to
the house. Upon Diana Yee’s arrival, she told her a man had come into the
house and raped her. Diana Yee called the police. Later, the parents of the
employers also came down. The Complainant’s evidence was that she did not
shower or clean up as it was not on her mind.

4.1 Diana Yee, a Sales Manager with Challenge Systems Components Pte Ltd
stated that she had know the Complainant 5 or 6 years as she was previously
employed by the Complainant’s employers and also because the Complainant used
to work for her auntie. She stated that about 6.00 something am on 15 January
2000, she was woken to answer a telephone call from the Complainant. She heard
the Complainant crying on the other side of the line and was asked to go
straightaway to the Complainant’s house as a man had come into the house.
Diana Yee drove to the Complainant’s house. On arrival, Diana Yee saw the
Complainant crying at the doorway and when she asked her what had happened,
the Complainant replied that she had been raped by a man who had a knife
pointing at her. She appeared to be crying and in a state of shock but settled
down after a while. Diana Yee called the police as evidenced by the First
Information Report **Exh. P50** received at about 7.32 am:

> "Case of rape reported. Further facts refer to NP104."

The evidence of police officers showed that the first police officer arrived
within 15 – 20 minutes. The Complainant was questioned. Diana Yee further
stated that she went round the house including the master bedroom and the
toilet of the master bedroom and saw a window panel opened as shown in **Exh.
P8** (from inside) and **Exh. P11** (from outside). Diana Yee also said that
she saw a cap **Exh P66** in the Complainant’s bedroom. She could not remember
whether she had asked the Complainant whether she had secured all the windows
and doors to the house before she had retired for the night.

5\. Lee Wei Fong (‘Wei Fong’), PW21, a tuition teacher staying in the
neighbouring 2 storey semi-detached house stated that the compound of her
house was usually lit brightly as there had then been a few robberies in the
area. There were 3 house lights according to her which shined on to the
compound of her house bordering the side where the maid’s room was in the
Ketumbit residence.

5.1 Testifying, Shi Hao, 12 years old, a Secondary I pupil, gave evidence that
he was woken up by the Complainant early in the morning. She was crying. He
later saw the left glass window of the bathroom which is attached to the
master bedroom open to about 90 upwards. He explained that the window appeared
to be open at about 45 in the Photographic **Exh. P8** because his grandfather
had gone to look at the window and had shifted the window from the outside
after he arrived. He said the bathroom windows were normally left ajar for
ventilation.

6\. The police party had found the body brush and the tube of shampoo lying on
the grass just outside the window as shown in **Photographic Exhs. P11 and
P12**. Chin Lee Lian (‘Lee Lian), PW13, the Complainant’s employer and mother
of Shi Hao explained that the window in question could open to a maximum of 90
when it was put to her that a police witness had stated that it could open to
45 and the window as shown in the **Photographic Exh. P8** was open at 45, She
went on to identify the brush with the handle as her body scrub brush. She saw
the said brush and the shampoo tube lying on the grass in **Photographic Exhs.
P11 and P12** were normally left on the window sill of the open window in
**Photographic Exh. P8**.

7\. The Investigating party seized various exhibits such as the Complainant’s
clothing and bed linen and pillow cases and submitted them for examined to the
Department of Scientific Services, Singapore. Also seized were two slightly
moist tissue papers from a waste paper basket near to the Complainant’s bed.
Asst Supt of Police Amy Ting stated that the waste paper basket was
photographed before she took out the 2 moist tissue papers but she left two
other small white crumpled pieces of paper and two pieces of facial cotton in
the basket. The contents are shown in Exh. P18. It was not put to Amy Ting
that there was anything else in the waste paper basket of significance.

8\. Dr Sadhana Nadarajah, PW4, a Registrar with the Reproduction Unit of the
Kandang Kerbau Women’s and Children’s Hospital testified that she examined the
Complainant at 7.15 pm on 15 January 2000. She stated that the Complainant
gave her a history of a dark complexioned man breaking into her employers’
house, entering her room and threatening her with a knife and making her
undress and thereafter making her perform oral sex on him and subsequently to
have sexual intercourse with her and that he withdrew his penis from her
vagina and ejaculated on her upper thigh and face. He then took all her money
in her wallet and left. Dr Sadhana stated that on examination, the Complainant
was calm and there were no external bruising seen over the face and body. On
inspection, she noted that the Complainant had old hymenal tears consistent
with her history of having been sexually active previously. There were 2
superficial lacerations over the perineum (space between opening of vaginal
and anus) consistent with some form of recent trauma to the genital area.
Investigations did not reveal spermatozoa in the vaginal and urethral swabs.
She disagreed with Defence Counsel that if there was forced sexual intercourse
against the wishes of the Complainant, the chances of there being hymenal tear
was high, because the hymen had already been torn previously and unlikely to
be torn again.

9\. Dr Renuka Sornarajah, Scientific Officer, examined the seized bedlinen and
clothing of the Complainant for DNA and submitted a Report.. In her report she
stated that she had examined the DNA profile of a bedsheet **Exh. P61** (FEM
6/00) and **Exh P62** a pillow case (FEM 7/00).

Her evidence was that in the report of the **Exh P61** a bedsheet, the genetic
loci of the profile of the semen stain matched that of the blood sample taken
from the Accused namely that each had the identical pairs of allele in the
genetic loci as appear below:

> HUMTHOi 6, 8
>
> HUMfes 11, 13
>
> HUMvWA 18, 8
>
> HUMF13A 5, 5

She further stated that she found the same main pairs of genetic loci on the
semen stains on the **Exh P62** a pillow case but however had also found a
secondary or minor base pair or allele of genetic loci as follows (which she
bracketed):

> HUMTHOi (7, 9)
>
> HUMfes (12)
>
> HUMvWA (14, 17)
>
> HUMF13A (6)

She stated that the secondary pair or allele arose because the sample was of
mixed origin i.e. that there was other genetic material in the sperm sample
belonging to someone else. Most but not all of the secondary base pair of the
genetic locii were the same as that of the Complainant Fredelina Evangelista
Manuel whose genetic locii was as follows:

> HUMTHOi _**7, 9**_
>
> HUMfes _11_ , **12**
>
> HUMvWA **14, 17**
>
> HUMF13A **_3.2_ ,** **6**

However, she concluded that as the genetic locii **11** and **3.2** was
missing from her analysis as the secondary material was not sufficient amount
she was unable to categorically state that the secondary genetic locii was
that of the Complainant. However, she explained that the secondary allele
could appear as a result of the presence of the skin cells of the Complainant,
her saliva or her vaginal fluids mixing on the seminal area of the seminal
stain. She agreed that such a situation of mixed sample could possibly arise
if for instance the Complainant after oral sex spat out or wiped her mouth
with her hand and then wiped the hand on the bed linen. When cross-examined by
Defence Counsel if the secondary allele could be that of another male, she
replied that while it not possible, there was little chance of that as there
was a three locii match with the Complainant’s profile.

Trial-Within-A-Trial

10\. The Prosecution had sought to admit in evidence two police statements
made by the Accused as follows:-

> (i) an _oral statement_ made to Insp Halim at about 5.10 pm at his office in
> the CID on 29th March 2000 and reduced by him into writing in his field book
> (**Exh. P49(id)**)**.**
>
> (ii) extracts of a _written statement_ being paragraphs 17 – 29 (**Exh.
> P54(id)**) recorded under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) by
> S/S/Sgt Lai on 4th April 2000 at about 2.30 pm.

10.1 The Accused challenged the admissibility of the statements, amongst other
things, on the ground that they were extracted from him under repeated threats
from the recording officers Insp Halim and S/S/Sgt Lai and to the effect that
unless he co-operated, his family members were liable to arrest for harbouring
him as a fugitive deserter and exhortations that he should admit to what he
had done. The two officers denied they had made such threats or exhortations
to the Accused or his family members.

10.2 I ruled that the statements were inadmissible. I shall now briefly
outline and evaluate the evidence resulting in the ruling I made in respect of
the non-admissibility of the two statements and the reasons therefore.

____

The Evidence

(i)**** The Oral Statement dated 30th March 2000 at 5.10 pm

11\. It was Insp Halim’s evidence that he sat facing the Accused from his
table in his office at the CID which he shared with S/S/Sgt Lai. Both were
seated on chairs. The Accused had one of his hands cuffed to the chair. This
was soon after the Accused’s arrest in his house. Insp Halim said he asked the
Accused what he had done. Insp Halim said he himself was not very well-versed
with the case. He decided to question the Accused although he was not told by
anyone to do so and he did not tell the Accused what charges he faced and nor
was any charge registered against the Accused at that stage in the charge book
at the station. He had just wanted the Accused to tell what he knew. The
Accused then narrated certain incidents without him asking any questions.
After the Accused had finished he went to his table and told the Accused he
intended to write down what he had said if the Accused had no objection. The
Accused then started to recount the events which Insp Halim said he wrote down
in his field book. Thereafter, the Accused signed the account he had given
after having read to the Accused what he had written. The accused made no
amendments though invited to do so. Insp Halim denied that the Accused had not
uttered the statement made to him by the Accused.

11.1 It is pertinent to mention the earlier train of events resulting in the
arrest of the Accused. Insp Halim testified that he was one of the arresting
officers of the Accused at his house, the others being Insp Soh and S/S/Sgt
Lai. Insp Halim testified that the Accused who was in the hall had seen the
police party outside the main door of the house but had refused to come out
when invited by the Accused’s elder brother Netto Gerard George who was
accompanying them. Instead the Accused took some steps back and started to
‘dash’ into the house. He was chased, lost his balance and was caught and
handcuffed but refused to get up. He only got up and accompanied the officers
back to the station when his father who had then arrived, advised him to go
with the police officers to the station. Whilst Insp Halim did not state if
the Accused was told the reasons for his arrest. Insp Soh testified that they
told the Accused that he was wanted by Civil Defence for being a deserter and
also for other serious offences. These were not specified. S/S/Sgt Lai further
stated that Insp Halim had told him at the station that the Accused had
volunteered a statement.

11.2 The account of the Accused and that of the members of his family was very
different. It was that the family was entertaining some visitors, including
visitors from London when the police party of three arrived at the front door
of the house with Gerard whose flat in Woodlands the police officers had
raided earlier. Gerard testified that outside the house, he was told to
restraint the dog, that one Patrick should not get involved and the Accused
should not run and if any of these things happened, the police would open
fire. Gerard called out to the Accused who was then on the telephone to come
out as the police wanted to talk to him. Gerard had his hand across Insp
Halim’s chest to prevent him from going into the house and to await the
Accused. There was some confusion and commotion thereafter. The Accused’s
mother testified that she told the Accused to go into the bedroom and she
would talk to the police. It was the Accused’s evidernce that he saw Insp
Halim push Gerard and his mother aside and make a dash for him, grab him by
his neck and force him to the floor after he had taken a few steps towards the
bedroom. He had not run. He had a previous injury to his ankle which was
bandaged and he was in pain as his leg assumed an awkward position when he
fell. He struggled with Insp Halim because of the pain. He stopped struggling
when he had moved his leg. Upon asking Insp Halim as to who he was he was told
by Insp Halim not to struggle or he will shoot him. Insp Halim had then put
his hands into his pocket gesturing as if to shoot. The mother Mary d/o J P
Pereira testified that she had retorted that for desertion, the Provost would
come or civil defence officer would come to arrest the Accused. The Accused
said his arrest had all happened very quickly in about 3 seconds. He had no
intention of running away. He agreed to accompany the police to the station
when his father told him to go. The Accused said his family members were
threatened in the house when S/S/Sgt Lai upon being asked by the Accused (who
was doing National Service) as to why he was being arrested stated that the
Accused was a deserter and that he could arrest all his family members. The
same threat was repeated to the Accused’s father Netto George Gerard by
S/S/Sgt Lai namely that he was harbouring a fugitive and he can be arrested
when he arrived at the house. The Accused’s mother Mary d/o J P Pereira (Mary)
stated that S/S/Sgt Lai had stated to her that unless the Accused co-operated
they would take all of them away. She told them not to do so.

11.3 The Accused narrated subsequent threats both on the way to the C.I.D. in
a police car and in the interview room by Insp Halim soon after his arrival at
the C.I.D. as well as threats that were uttered by S/S/Sgt Lai.

11.4 The Accused testified that Insp Soh, S/S/Sgt Lai and Insp Halim kept on
asking him to admit what he had done when travelling in the car. He had not
been told of any other offences he had committed save the assertion that he
was a deserter which he did not deny. All the police officers in the car
denied the allegations made against them when they were travelling in the car
asserting that they did not even speak to the Accused in the car. However,
Gerard, who was also taken in the same car for questioning (although not
arrested) stated that in the car, S/S/Sgt Lai was angry with the Accused and
used vulgar words. Insp Halim told the Accused: "to come out with it" in
English. However, Insp Soh and S/S/Sgt Lai spoke in Hokkien and he could not
make out what they were saying.

11.5 __ The Accused stated that Sgt Lai had brought him to a room at the CID
and he was made to squat down and later he was allowed to sit on a chair to
which he was handcuffed. He was told that if he wanted to be treated like a
human being he should behave like one and if he co-operated with them they
would co-operate with him. In the room Insp Halim was left alone with him.
Insp Halim asked him whether he had committed any offences. He denied if he
committed any offences. Rape was mentioned. He denied committing such an
offence. However, Insp Halim went on to write a statement. He was looking at a
brown file on the table as he did so. He was then asked to sign the statement.
He had refused to sign it because he had not made it. He was threatened by
Insp Halim that he was going to arrest his family members and his brother was
already arrested. The Accused stated that he had seen his brother in the same
room a little earlier as he had also accompanied them to the station. He was
shocked when Insp Halim told him about wanting to arrest his family. Later
S/S/Sgt Lai came into the room and Insp Halim told him that he had refused to
sign the statement he had made for him. S/S/Sgt Lai told the Accused that his
investigations showed that it was the Accused who had committed rape and he
had better sign the statement. The Accused said he did not know what
investigations they had done but because of the threats to arrest his family
although they had nothing to do with the matter, he signed the statement. He
also signed the statement because he was scared for the safety of his parents
as Insp Halim had repeated the threats relating to the arrest of his family 3
times. He had believed his brother was under arrest because he saw him in the
same room earlier.

11.6 Insp Soh, Insp Halim and S/S/sgt Lai denied all the allegations made by
the Accused and his family relating to the threats to arrest members of the
family and stated that they had only asserted that the Accused was a deserter
and he was wanted as such.

(ii) Written Statement dated 4th April.2000 at 2.30 pm

11.7 __ Before the above statement was made, the Accused had on 30th March
2000 made two statements (**Exhs. D6 and D7**) one at 12.01am (rape) and the
other at 12.40 am (robbery) under s 122(6) after the notice under the said
section had been read to him. The Defence admitted these statements through
the Investigating Officer. S/S/Sgt Lai had recorded the statements. In the
statements, the Accused had stated that he had nothing to say.

At 1.15 am on 30.3.2000 S/S/Sgt Lai had proceeded to record the s 121
statement (the long statement) from the Accused and completed it at 2.40 am
The Prosecution did not seek to admit this statement.

In seeking to admit only paragraphs 17 – 29 of the long statement made on
4.4.2000 at 2.30 pm, S/S/Sgt Lai who recorded it, stated that he had brought
the Accused to his room where the Accused after telling him that he wished to
speak in English volunteered the statement in question. S/S/Sgt Lai stated
that he simultaneously recorded what the Accused said. After the completion of
the statement, it was read out to the Accused. The Accused signed it after
some corrections were made. The statement made was free from threats,
inducements or promises.

In his _cross-examination_ , S/S/Sgt Lai admitted that paragraphs 17 – 29 of
the statement of the Accused made on 4.4.2000 which the Prosecution sought to
admit, covered the same ground as the earlier long statement made by the
Accused on 30 March 2000 at 1.15 am. He agreed that essentially it was the
same save the date on which the rape and robbery had taken place had been
mistakenly put down by him as 15.3.2000 when it should have been 15.1.2000.
The Accused had correctly referred to the date as 15.1.2000 in his statement
dated 4.4.2000. The mix-up of the dates was the subject matter of only one
small paragraph. When asked why did he wish to cover the same grounds on
4.4.2000 in respect of all the paragraphs, S/S/Sgt Lai stated that he could
not give any reason.

The Accused, on the other hand, in his statement stated that he had sat in
front of S/S/Sgt Lai while S/S/Sgt Lai typed the whole statement. Before
giving it to him to sign it, S/S/sgt Lai had told him to "sign it and forget
about it". He had resisted signing it but eventually he signed it as he had no
choice because of the insistence of S/S/Sgt Lai telling him you have already
admitted it and just to project that he would get 10 – 15 years imprisonment.

Ruling

12\. Having considered and assessed all the evidence, it appeared to me that
the two statements sought to be admitted by the Prosecution had been caused by
threats as a result of the Accused believing that his family members would be
spared if he made the statements as required by the two officers i.e. that he
would thereby gain an advantage by making the statements as required by the
officers. I found the evidence of Insp Halim questionable when he stated that
he did not have much knowledge of the facts of the case and that he simply let
the Accused tell him about what he had done and the Accused had as such
volunteered the statement. Insp Halim’s admission that he did not even tell
the Accused what the charges were against him was unconvincing. He was a
senior officer. He took part in the arrest of the Accused. He must have known
what the Accused was being arrested for and he must have told what the charges
were against him. The Accused was also rushed to Insp Halim’s room without
even his arrest being registered in the charge book or the lock up. It
appeared to me the pressure was put on him to admit the charges and to make
the statement **Exh P49(id)**. I was equally disdainful if the evidence of
S/S/Sgt Lai concerning the making of the statement **Exh. P54(id)**. I was
satisfied, having heard and observed the versions of the evidence given by the
Accused and his family that threats had been made by the two said police
officers to the Accused at the CID and in his house to him and members of his
family that they could be arrested for harbouring the Accused as a deserter.
Their evidence had a ring of truth and remained intact during the
Prosecution’s cross-examination The Prosecution had therefore not discharged
its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were
voluntarily made. In _**Poh Kay Keng v P P**_ (CA) [1996] 1SLR pg 209 threats
against the Accused’s family members to have them charged or have their
property confiscated were held to be an inducement vitiating the Accused’s
statement. In this case as in the above case, I similarly held on the evidence
that the Accused was induced by the threats made against his family to make
the statements he made. As such, I rejected the statements **Exhs. P49 (id)
and P 54(id)** and returned them to the Prosecution.

Prima Facie Case

13\. Defence Counsel did not make a ‘no case’ submission.

In the light of the Complainant’s identification of the Accused as the one who
had forcibly committed the offence after putting her in fear of death at knife
point and in view of the Accused’s identity being further established as a
result of the DNA results of semen stains which matched his blood group, I was
satisfied that a _prima facie_ case against the Accused had been made out in
respect of the offences of rape and the other charges which if unrebutted
would warrant his conviction. The Complainant’s evidence of the open window in
the bathroom circumstantially showed that the Accused had climbed in through
the window to break into the house as he was not there at her invitation. The
other doors and windows according to the Complainant were all closed. There
was nothing inherently incredible about her evidence on these matters and on
the other offences relating to unnatural sex (oral sex), the criminal force
used on her as stated in the charge and robbery of the $50/- in her wallet
although the police had omitted to recover the wallet from her. She had indeed
withdrawn $300/- on 10th and 12th January 2000 from her bank and as she had
said, remitted most of the monies to the Philippines leaving the $50/- as her
change in her wallet.

In the circumstances, I called for the Accused to enter his defence.

The Accused elected to give evidence on oath.

__****__

Defence

14\. The Accused’s defence was that he had been introduced to the Complainant,
a Lina, by Colin in a coffee shop along Jalan Selaseh in Seletar. A few days
after Christmas in December 1999, Colin took him to Lina’s house at 1.00 am
The Complainant allowed them through the front gate and front door of the
house and went to the kitchen where the Complainant made coffee for them.
Colin then went into her room and came out 5 – 10 minutes later and after that
left the house. She thereafter took the Complainant to her room saying she
wanted to speak to him and there they had sexual intercourse after she undid
his pants. He had used a condom. On this occasion the Complaint had told them
not to make noise because her employers might wake up. He did not ask her if
the owners were in. He next met her at the same coffee shop in early January
2000 when he saw the Complainant using a phone at the provision store. He made
an arrangement to see her that night. On arrival at the place where she
stayed, he was again allowed in by the front entrance and they had sexual
intercourse. He had noticed a car parked in the porch of the house and he had
suspected the owners were in and because of that she did not go to the dining
area.

14.1 He went a third time to see the Complainant in the house on 15th January
2000 at about 3.00 am after leaving a bar art Chijmes accompanied by Colin who
said Lina was free that night. They were again allowed in by the front door.
They chatted in the kitchen where the light was on. The Complainant then said
she wanted to talk to him and took him to the room where he had sexual
intercourse with her again for two to three minutes with a condom which he
threw into the waste paper basket after using it. As for conversation with her
before the intercourse, she had not said anything but after intercourse she
asked him for a loan of $5,000/- as she had problems at home in the
Philippines. He said he didn’t have that kind of money and offered her $50/-
which she refused. He went back to the kitchen and told Colin about it and he
told him to help her if he could. The Complainant then came out and to put in
the Accused words ‘everything was normal. She didn’t mention about money ….’.
And half an hour later he left leaving Colin behind.

14.2 As for the black cap found in the Complainant’s room, he had given it to
her as a present on the second occasion they met in her house as he had
received several caps as gifts at about that time.

14.3 After 15th January 2000 he met her again on 16 March 2000 at Selaseh Park
along Jalan Selaseh at about 4.00 pm. The park was about 150 metres form his
house. The house in which the Complainant worked was a few houses away from
his own. He made an appointment to meet her outside her house at 10.30 pm. He
met her as scheduled and they then went to the Ipanema Bar in Orchard Towers
where she ordered a Budweiser Beer and he a jog of Tiger. He produced a
receipt of his expenses at the bar **Exh. D4**. After the drinks he picked up
some condoms from a 7-Eleven Store nearby (receipt – **Exh. D5**) and he then
took her to Balestier Hotel at after midnight on 17th March 2000 where they
had sexual intercourse. Only his name was registered there. The Complainant
left the hotel at about 6.00 am saying she had to go back in case her
employers woke up. He took her back in a cab and got down near her house as
his house was only 50 metres away. The Complainant knew where he lived. They
parted company.

14.4 Thereafter to the date of his arrest on 30th March 2000 in his house, he
had not met up with her.

14.5 Asked by his Counsel if he was facing any problems at about during this
one or two months, the Accused stated that he was away without leave (AWOL)
for more than 2 months from National Service and was going through a kind of
depression. He agreed he had not been paid for 2 months as a National
Serviceman but that he works as a deejay. On the night of 15th January, he
still at about $150/-. When asked if he had heard the evidence of Colin and
that Colin had denied introducing him to Lina or ever going into the house
where the Complainant worked on the 2 occasions they met. He disagreed. Asked
why Colin would testify in that manner, the Accused said he had come up with
his own ideas as to why he was doing this. He had eavesdropped on a
conversation at Peyton Place bar which Colin was having with a male Chinese.
The Accused said:-

> " …..I heard Colin mentioned to this male Chinese something about drugs. So
> when I heard this, I knew Colin was dealing in some kind of drugs. I left
> Peyton Place straightaway. ……….
>
> And then after I walked out, I went to 7-Eleven. I bought a drink. I was
> walking back when Colin ---I saw Colin outside. Then he asked me, "Eh, you
> haven’t finished your work." So I brought up the matter to him. I confronted
> him with it and I told him, "I overheard what you were telling that guy. You
> are dealing in some kind of drugs here." I got into a heated conversation
> with him and he told me to mind my own business and to do the job that I was
> paid for. So I didn’t say anything to him.  
>  ………………..  
>  **THIS IS THE REASON WHY COLIN MAY HAVE ASKED THE VICTIM TO DO THIS TO ME
> BECAUSE** \----  
>  Because I have knowledge that he is not only dealing with these drugs but I
> have been on other occasions with him to Peyton Place where I have seen him
> collecting a lot of money.  
>  …..  
>  He collected money on a few occasions when I went with him. And he
> collected it from a Filipino girl. I don’t know who this girl is. Because
> there are a lot of Filipino girls that patronise this pub called Peyton
> Place.  
>  …..  
>  I don’t know the figure, Sir, but I saw a stack of $50 notes, Sir.  
>  ………  
>  About half an inch, Sir.  
>  …………  
>  So he must be doing something behind the scenes, for a Filipino to give him
> the money. "

14.6 Asked in _Cross-Examination_ what he had in mind when he saw the Accused
having the cash transactions with a Filipino girl, the Accused replied:

> "A: I didn’t know about it. Didn’t look illegal. I didn’t have any proof
> that it was illegal also so I didn’t think anything of it."

14.7 The Accused also stated that he asked Colin what were the transactions
about and Colin replied it was for some work and he had to take his word for
it.

14.8 As for the incident concerning the drugs, it had taken place somewhere
around the 2nd or 3rd January 2000. When they parted company after a heated
conversation their relationship was tense. However, he added Colin met him a
few days again and did some work for him and was paid. Asked if he didn’t feel
uncomfortable being in Colin’s presence, he replied, ‘Not really. After the
15th January 2000 when he and Colin were at the Complainant’s house after
going to Chijmes, everything was back to normal with them.

14.9 Asked what the Complainant’s reaction was when he refused her a $5,000/-
loan and offered only $50/-, which she refused to take, she did not say
anything to him. Subsequently he had not asked Colin if he had given her
$5,000/-.

14.10 As for the risk he was taking in going to the Ketumbit house on various
occasions in the event that the owners were in, his answer was that he ‘didn’t
make anything out of it’. He did not also think he was doing anything wrong
seeing the maid late at night without the knowledge of the houseowner.

14.11 As for the Notice Statement made by the Accused under s 122(6) of the
CPC the Accused replied to questions that whilst he was informed of the
charges, the Notice of Warning was not read to him by the Investigating
Officer nor did he read it when he made the statement ‘I have nothing to say’.
He merely said this because he was ‘very confused’ at the time and he did not
want to ‘provoke’ the Investigating Officer.

14.12 The Accused agreed with the Prosecution that the Complainant had not
given to him her telephone number and he knew nothing of her person.

14.13 In _Re-Examination_ , the Accused explained that at that point of time
he ‘didn’t want to say anything’.

14.14 In clarification, when asked by the Court why the Defence had not put to
Colin that he had asked the Complainant to make the allegation of rape and the
other sexual allegations against him as charged because the Accused had
discovered Colin to be dealing in drugs and stacks of currency bills and had
confronted him and that Colin had therefore ill-will against him for that
reason, the Accused’s answer was:

> "A: I cannot explain, Sir"

He went on to say he had instructed his Counsel on this matter so it was up to
Counsel to ask or not to ask.

14.15 Asked by the Court why the Complainant would go out with him or have
sexual intercourse again with him on 16th/17th March 2000 when she had already
made a police report of rape, his answer was:

> "I cannot explain."

__**

Evaluation and Finding

**__

15\. The applicable law in a sexual offence which I had to bear in mind in
coming to my findings was that there was no legal necessity that I had to warn
myself expressly of the danger of convicting the Accused assuming that the
Complainant’s evidence was uncorroborated. I though bore in mind the principle
that it was dangerous to convict on the words of the Complainant alone unless
her evidence was ‘unusually compelling or convincing’. That phrase was
explained in _**Kwan Peng Hong v P P**_ [2000] 4SLR 96 where Yong C.J. stated:

> "The phrase ‘unusually compelling or convincing’ simply means that the
> complainant’s evidence was so convincing that the prosecution’s case was
> proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of that evidence.
>
> …….what is important is for the trial judge to analyse the evidence for the
> prosecution and for the defence with a view to deciding whether a conviction
> based solely on the complainant’s evidence is not unsafe. If it is not
> unsafe to so convict, the trial judge need not go further, except to explain
> clearly the reasoning behind the findings of fact.
>
> ….if it is unsafe to convict, the trial judge should identify which aspect
> of the evidence is not so convincing. The trial judge should then look for
> supporting evidence and ask whether in taking the weak evidence, together
> with the supporting evidence, the trial judge is convinced that the
> prosecution case is proven beyond reasonable doubt."

The learned Chief Justice also went on in that case to explain the nature of
corroborative evidence as follows:

> "Finally, in analysing the evidence, the trial judge must weigh it
> carefully, always bearing in mind the relevant aspects of human nature and
> behaviour. But it would be wrong to be bogged down by technicalities,
> especially when they have no logical bearing to the case in hand. Our
> approach is clear. We have left behind a technical and inflexible approach
> to corroboration and its definition. ……….
>
> Instead, our approach is liberal, ensuring that the trial judge has the
> necessary flexibility in treating relevant evidence as corroborative. This
> is in line with the approach of other jurisdictions. What is important is
> the substance and the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is
> supportive or confirmative of the other weak evidence.
>
> Essential qualities of corroborative evidence are its independence,
> admissibility and whether it implicates the accused in a material
> particular.
>
> Even if the evidence is capable of corroboration, whether it does supply
> corroboration still depends on all the circumstances of the case. The trial
> judge must pay particular consideration to the extent to which the evidence
> that is capable of corroboration does provide the corroborative evidence to
> satisfactorily dispel any doubt on the guilt of the accused. This flexible
> approach to corroboration ensures that proper weight is given to the right
> evidence and no undue weight is assigned to some evidence merely because it
> is called ‘corroboration’."

16\. The main issue raised in the case was whether the sexual intercourse was
consensual. In this regard, the Accused’s case was that he had been introduced
to the Complainant some time before Christmas 1999 at a coffee shop at Jalan
Selaseh in Seletar by Colin for whom he did contract work off and on and then
subsequently he had consensual intercourse with the Complainant at her
employer’s house in the early hours of the morning by visiting her on three
occasions there. The three occasions were when he went there with Colin just
after Christmas 1999, again when he went there alone in early January 2000 and
then again when he went there with Colin **on 15 th January 2000, the date
relevant to the charges on which he was being tried **and finally again on
17th March 2000 when he met her alone on 16th March 2000 and took her for a
drink to the Ipanema Bar in Orchard Tower and thereafter to Balestier Hotel.
He produced two receipts. He had a receipt for drink purchases (Budweiser beer
for the Complainant and a jug of beer for himself) together with a receipt for
purchase of condoms at a 7-Eleven Store nearby before leaving for the Hotel
with the Complainant. The Prosecution did not dispute that he went to the
Hotel. The Prosecution case was that it was not the Complainant he went there
with. The Accused’s evidence was that on each occasion when he visited the
Complainant at her employer’s house, he was allowed by the Complainant to
enter into her employer’s house through the front gate and front door and
would then be led to either the kitchen and/or into the maid’s room
thereafter. On the first occasion when he went with Colin, the Complainant
invited Colin first into the maid’s room and when he came out to the kitchen
where the Accused waited, he was led to the maid’s room next. Colin left the
house when he went into the maid’s room with the Complainant. She had also
earlier made coffee for them. The kitchen lights were on. On the second
occasion on 15th January 2000 when he went with Colin again, he had gone into
the maid’s room first and after he had sexual intercourse, the Complainant had
asked him for $5,000/- as she had financial difficulties in the Philippines.
He told her he could not afford to pay her and offered her $50/- which she
declined to accept. In the event he paid nothing to her. He had conveyed this
request for the money to Colin who was waiting in the kitchen when he came out
and Colin merely told him to help her if he could. As for the Complainant she
did not say anything more about the $5,000/- then or subsequently when they
met again.

17\. I found that all considered, the Accused’s defence of consensual sexual
intercourse on 15 January 2000 or on the other dates consisted of only his
bare word. It was plain to see that the two receipts did not at all connect
the Complainant with an outing with him on 16th/ 17th March 2000 leave alone
her accompanying him and having sexual intercourse with him on that day at the
Balestier Hotel. Nevertheless, I bore in mind that a ‘bare word’ defence where
circumstances permit is capable of raising a reasonable doubt on the
Prosecution case.

17.1 As for the Complainant, she had denied that she had ever been introduced
to the Accused before or had ever met him otherwise or had sexual intercourse
with him save that as she slept in the maid’s room of her employers’ house,
she was suddenly awakened by him on 15th January 2000 with a knife pointing at
her neck. He then raped her and narrated the commission of the other offences
as set out in the charges. She denied knowing Colin or such a person ever
accompanied the Accused into her employers’ house or had sexual intercourse
with her.

18\. The Complainant was _cross-examined_ intensively by Defence Counsel. She
withstood the _cross-examination_ and the credibility of her complaints as
charged against the Accused remained without blemish and intact.

19\. I found that there were significant aspects of both the Prosecution and
Defence case which convinced me that the Complainant’s evidence was unusually
compelling and hence convincing. Soon after the Accused had left the
Complainant in the early hours of that morning, the Complainant had telephoned
Diana Yee who was a former employee of her employer as her employer and her
husband had left for China the previous evening. It was Diana Yee’s evidence
that the Complainant was crying and she had told her that a man had come into
the house whereupon Diana Yee had driven immediately off to see the
Complainant and on her arrival saw her crying and in a state of shock although
she settled down later. She was told a man had come into the house and raped
her. Diana Yee made a 999 call to the police and the recorded time of that
call is 7.32 am (**Exh. P50** : ‘Case of Rape reported’). The Complainant had
therefore reported the matter promptly and she was also seen in a distressed
state when Diana Yee came and saw her. Independent evidence of a distressed
condition after an alleged offence can amount to corroborating evidence of the
offence: _**R v Redpath**_ [1962] 46 Cr App Rep 319. I found the fact that the
Complainant had made a contemporaneous report to Diana Yee and she had
conveyed the information to the police soon thereafter as corroborative
evidence of her complaint that she had been raped, robbed and other
indignities as charged committed on her. The proviso under s 159 of the
Evidence Act provides that former statements of a witness may be proved to
corroborate later testimony as to the same fact. It was not necessary for her
in the distressed condition she was, to immediately have narrated all the
other indignities she charged the Accused with and robbery of $50/- from her.
It was sufficient that she told the police of these in recorded statements
later as she did. Her distressed state further constituted corroboration of
her complaint against the Accused. I found it improbable in the light of the
evidence and the inferences I drew therefrom that her complaint and her
distress was feigned.

19.1 As for no medical injuries being found on her neck and back area where
the Complainant said the Accused had pointed his knife, the Complainant’s
explanation which I found plausible was that the Accused had not pressed the
knife hard on her body. I also accepted as plausible the Complainant’s
explanation that the cap found in the Complainant’s room was not given to her
by the Accused. I was satisfied that the Accused had inadvertently left the
cap behind when he left the Complainant’s room.

20\. Defence Counsel had submitted that if the Complainant’s story was true
that she did not know him previously and the Accused had broken into the
Complainant’s employer’s house and raped her in the maid’s room which was then
dark as it was in the early hours of the morning, she could not have seen his
face and identified him at the identification parade and in any case the
Accused was not aware that he had been identified by the Complainant as the
Complainant never appeared in the presence of the Accused to identify him at
the parade and as such the identification was flawed.

20.1 The Defence Counsel’s submission ignored the evidence of the Complainant
that she was able to see the ‘face’ and ‘built’ of the Accused because of the
light coming in through the window of her room from the neighbouring house as
he had stood near the window ‘putting on his clothes’ and had asked her also
to open the window before leaving the room through the window. When she was
told that the Accused had a moustache and a beard at that time, she said she
had not noticed it. In this regard, Wei Fong, PW21, the neighbour testified
that she normally left all her garden lights on and her compound was always
brightly lit as there had been a few robberies in the area. There were three
lights according to her which shone into the compound bordering the side where
the maid’s room was. Her evidence was not diminished by Defence Counsel’s
_cross-examination_. From the photographs, I noticed that the two houses were
very close. I was satisfied that the Complainant was able to see the Accused’s
face, recognise it and later identify it from a set of photographs of several
persons shown to her by the police and thereafter identify the Accused at an
identification parade. As for the Accused’s defence that he was unaware that
he had been identified, the explanation lay in the fact that the
identification was done in the CID from an adjoining room through the glass
panel through which only a one way view could be had of the parade. This
procedure was used for the protection of witnesses in certain cases, for
example, the Complainant in this case and I found nothing improper in the
procedure.

21\. The Accused’s version of the events and the manner his case was conducted
begged many pertinent questions which went unanswered. In all, I was satisfied
that against the backdrop of the Complainant’s evidence, the Accused’s defence
of the Complainant being a friend with whom he previously had sexual
intercourse and again after the 15th January 2000 notwithstanding that she had
already made a police report concerning the incident of the 15th January 2000
were all, in my opinion, a desperate and elaborate lie to establish his
defence. I had asked the Accused in clarification as to why the Complainant
would go out with him to have sexual intercourse with him on 17th March 2000
in view of a report of rape committed on her on 15 January 2000. His answer
was: ‘I cannot explain’.

21.1 I found the Accused’s defence of consensual intercourse on 15th January
2000 and the other incidents of consensual sexual intercourse with the
Complainant, incapable of standing up to scrutiny for compelling reasons:

(i) _the Accused’s defence was refuted by Colin, PW20_

Accused’s Counsel had indicated to me early during the trial that the Defence
was intending to call Colin as a defence witness. Later during the Prosecution
case, I was informed that the Accused was not calling him as a witness. In the
event, he was called by the Prosecution as a witness pursuant to the usual
notice being served, Counsel for the Accused not objecting. Colin denied he
knew the Complainant or had ever been to her employer’s house alone or with
the Accused as alleged by the Accused. He though admitted that he knew the
Accused and the Accused had been doing some contract work for him. He stated
that as far as he could recollect, he had only seen the Complainant passing by
on an occasion at or near a coffee shop in Jalan Selaseh which is a close-by
shopping area for the estate where the Complainant lived. Defence Counsel in
his _cross-examination_ was unable to impugn the evidence of Colin.

(ii) _the Accused’s allegation that Colin had an ulterior motive for giving
evidence unfavourable to him entirely lacked credibility_

22\. The Accused in his defence from the witness stand, alleged that Colin did
not tell the truth about his involvement with the Complainant. He attributed a
sinister motive to Colin in giving unfavourable evidence against him namely
that they had fallen apart because the Accused had eavesdropped and heard a
conversation between Colin and another that Colin was involved in dealing in
drugs. He had also seen Colin being given a stack of $50/- notes. He had also
stated he believed Colin was doing something behind the scene although he
didn’t have proof that anything was illegal about it. The Accused had
confronted him with what he had overheard and seen. As a result, there was a
heated argument between Colin and himself. The Accused then stated in
evidence:

> ‘This is the reason why Colin may have asked the victim to do this to me’.

22.1 The Accused’s brother as a witness for the defence, further alleged
against Colin that Colin was involved in prostitution and that he had on one
occasion seen Colin at the Jalan Selaseh coffee shop nodding in the direction
of the Complainant when she approached the coffee shop. The net value of all
this evidence was to discredit Colin’s denial that he knew the Complainant and
that both he and the Accused were involved in consensual sexual trysts with
the Complainant.

22.2 I found the Accused’s allegations of ulterior motive against Colin
completely lacked credibility and this finding by me was accentuated by his
Counsel in not attributing or **putting** such a motive to Colin.

22.3 If the Complainant was doing the bidding of Colin in a situation where
Colin stage-managed for the Complainant and the Accused to have sexual
intercourse on 15th January 2000, then the Complainant having made a police
report, would have informed the police to arrest him soon after the 15th
January 2000 as the evidence was undisputed that the Accused lived in the same
estate as the Complainant and his house was only a few doors away from that of
the Complainant’s employer’s house as he had got down from a taxi near her
employer’s house to walk to his house on one occasion. If the Complainant had
not seen exactly which house he lived in, she would know the precise vicinity
in which he lived. The Complainant would have tipped off the police as to the
vicinity he lived in after the matter was reported to the police. Again, she
could have arranged for the police to arrest him on 16th March 2000 when the
Accused made arrangements to meet her that night and allegedly took her out
for another sexual escapade. As the evidence turned out, the police spent more
than 2 months to track down the Accused and arrest him from a description
given of the Accused by the Complainant.

22.4 Though the Accused claimed that he had informed Defence Counsel of the
Accused’s ulterior motive, the same was never _put_ to Colin although Defence
Counsel had ample opportunity to do so and Defence Counsel had repeatedly
consulted with the Accused in the dock throughout the trial. I was satisfied
that the Accused had not informed Defence Counsel of these allegations he
uttered in his evidence from the witness stand as in my opinion he made them
up as he went along giving his evidence. Otherwise, Defence Counsel would have
put the Accused’s allegations of what he had overheard and seen to Colin as
well as the allegations made by the Accused’s brother i.e. that of
prostitution and his noticing Colin acknowledging the Complainant one day at
the coffee shop in Jalan Selaseh. They would have been the central planks of
his defence to demolish the credibility of Colin. Further, if it was the
belief of the Accused that there was collusion between Colin and the
Complainant for whatever reason be that one the quarrel between Colin and the
Accused or the Accused not paying the Complainant $5,000/-, such collusion was
not put to the Complainant and her response tested.

22.5 I held that the Defence could not, in the circumstances, rely on all
these allegations of the Accused and his brother to discredit the evidence of
Colin. It is sufficient in this regard for me to refer to the rule as
enunciated in _**Brown & Dunn**_:

> "it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause,
> where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on
> a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions
> put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made
> and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether
> unchallenged, and the, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps
> he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the
> circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought
> not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit. …it
> will not do to impeach the credibility of a witness upon a matter on which
> he has not had any opportunity of giving an explanation by reason of there
> having been no suggestion whatever in the course of the case that his story
> is not accepted."

The above rule was endorsed in the case of _**Arts Niche Cyber Distribution
Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor**_ :

> "[a]ny matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief
> given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an
> opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be
> held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief."

(iii) _the highly questionable nature of the Accused’s alleged relationship
with Complainant_

23\. The Accused’s evidence was to the effect that he was close to the
Complainant and could see her at his will and have sexual intercourse with her
either at her employer’s house or outside. Yet, he had not exchanged any
contact telephone numbers with the Complainant although the Complainant had a
personal cellular phone in her possession. Then again, I failed to understand
why the Complainant who was in need of money and had asked the Accused for
$5,000/- on 15th January 2000 would continue to have sexual intercourse with
him as he had told her he had no such amount to pay her and had offered her
instead $50/- which payment she had rejected. The Accused’s evidence was also
very strange when he stated that notwithstanding him not paying her the
$5,000/- or any other sum, his relationship with her was normal and she had
never raised the question of asking money from him again. The Accused had also
stated that he had other girlfriends younger than the Accused. Yet, curiously
he had to go each time to the Complainant’s employer’s house to meet the
Complainant who was 43 years old in the dead of night being completely averse
to the risk that the owners of the house may be in and they may wake up and
find him there as their master bedroom was on the ground floor not far from
the maid’s room. The Accused’s explanation that there was nothing wrong with
going to the employer’s house to see the Complainant in the early hours of the
morning shows his daring and disregard for consequences. I agree with the
Prosecution that the logical explanation was that the Accused was not a
truthful witness when he said that the Complainant and he knew each other at
all.

(iv) _that the Accused used a condom before having sexual intercourse on 15 th
January 2000_

24\. The Accused’s evidence was that he had used a condom to have sexual
intercourse and then discarded it in the waste-paper basket next to the bed.
This showed that the sexual intercourse was consensual as the Complainant
allowed him to wear the condom. Whilst I did not quite understand this piece
of evidence, it was obvious that in this regard the Accused was untruthful.
The police had searched the waste-paper basket and had not recovered any
condom, only 2 pieces of tiny crumbled white papers and the pieces of damp
tissues (**Exh. P65**) which proved negative for any DNA. The Accused then
explained that the Complainant would have thrown away the condom before
calling the police. This again did not make sense because the Accused had
testified he believed Colin had set him up or framed him by conniving with the
Complainant though this had never been put to the Complainant. As such, there
was all the more reason to keep the incriminating condom for DNA testing to
nail the Accused. I therefore accepted the Complainant’s version that the
Accused had masturbated and ejaculated outside her after having sexual
intercourse with her. This is also consistent with her evidence that she had
not washed her bottom and was consistent with the DSS evidence that no DNA
profile was yielded on vaginal smears taken from her. She had, she explained,
only brushed her teeth and washed around the mouth area as was her daily
morning habit.

(v) _the damming circumstancial evidence of the Accused’s entry into the house
through the bathroom window of the master bedroom_

25\. The evidence of the Complainant was that the Accused left her room after
raping her by opening her bedroom window and climbing out. She had thereafter
gone to inspect all the doors and windows and had found the window of the
master bedroom toilet open. She believed the Accused would have come into the
house through the said window. She showed the open window to Shi Hao, PW14,
after she woke him, who confirmed that the said window was wide open. There
was some minor discrepancy as to how wide the window was open but the
important consideration was that I was satisfied that its opening was large
enough in view of the dimensions given by the Investigating Officer, for the
Accused to enter through it as he was slim and that he did enter through this
window to gain access into the house. The entry is confirmed by a body brush
with a long handle and a shampoo tube which lay at the bottom of the window on
the grass verge outside the house. The evidence of the Complainant and her
employer was that normally these were placed on the window sill. The only
reasonable inference for me to draw, which I drew was that the Accused in
order to climb through the window picked up the brush and shampoo tube and
threw them out to gain an unimpeded entry through the window and into the
house. He had thus committed housebreaking by night as charged.

(vi) _the unrealistic return to normality of the relationship of the Accused
with Colin_

26\. In this regard, the Accused’s evidence was that notwithstanding the
heated quarrel Colin had with the Accused upon accusing him of drug dealings
and collecting money under dubious circumstances, ‘everything was back to
normal’ between Colin and him so much so that they were beginning to go to
nightspots and Colin also took him to the Complainant’s employer’s house on
15th January 2000. I disbelieved the Accused’s evidence that their
relationship would have mended so speedily, if at all in view of the various
serious accusations he alleged he made against Colin. I also noticed that the
Accused had a habit when giving evidence of explaining away uncomfortable
questions with phrases such as ‘I didn’t make anything of it’, ‘everything was
back to normal’, ‘I didn’t think anything was wrong’ and ‘it did not occur to
me’. He did not strike me as a credible witness.

(vii) _the Accused’s failure to mention his defence in his Notice Statements
under s 122(6) of the CPC_

27\. The Defence admitted two statements **Exh. D6** (Rape) and
**D7**(Robbery) by the Accused on 30th March 2000. The Defence admitted these
statements through the Investigating Officer. I accepted these were
voluntarily made otherwise the Defence would not have admitted then. In both
statements the Accused had stated:

> "I have nothing to say’

Asked in _cross-examination_ why he had not stated in his defence after the
Notice of Warning had been read to him, he stated he was in a confused state
and he did not wish to state matters which would prejudice his case. I
rejected the Accused’s explanation as the statements were admitted by the
Defence. The purpose of giving the Notice of Warning to an accused under s
122(6) is to enable him, upon being charged, to raise his defences then and to
guard against an accused raising defences at his trial which are merely
afterthoughts. The Accused could have simply mentioned that he knew the
Complainant and he had consensual sexual intercourse with her. There was
nothing complicating in stating this. The Accused’s failure to mention this
showed that his defence was an afterthought of his.

28\. The Accused had totally denied that he had had unnatural sex (oral) with
the Complainant or that he had outraged her modesty by licking her vagina or
robbed her of $50/-. Counsel for the Defence pointed out that the police had
not seized the Complainant’s wallet in which she said she kept the $50/-. I
found that the police had not seized the wallet as a result of inadvertence
and the Complainant had taken back the wallet and left it in the Philippines
when she went home for a visit there. The important fact was that the
Complainant had withdrawn a total of $300/- on the 10th and 12th January 2000
from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and evidence of the same was furnished
in Court. Some of the money had been remitted to the Philippines according to
the Complainant and some lent to her Filipino friends. There was no reason in
the circumstances for the Complainant to concoct the charge of robbery
concerning a small sum of $50/- which in all probability she had in her
wallet.

29\. There was also no reason advanced by the Defence why the Complainant
would exaggerate and add the offences of unnatural sex and outraging modesty
as stated above to the charge of rape. She had given her evidence quietly and
had sobbed on one or two occasions. I found her narration of the events that
night orderly, precise and clear and unusually convincing in the light of all
the circumstances I have raised and discussed. I was also satisfied that no
reasonable doubt had been thrown on the Prosecution case by the Defence.

As such, I found the Accused guilty as charged and convicted him on all the
charges.

__****__

Sentence

30\. I was informed by the Prosecution that the Accused had previous
convictions. He was convicted on 6th October 1994 under s 456 read with s 511
of the Penal Code – attempted housebreaking by night with common intention
together with other offences under s 457, 454 and 380 which were taken into
consideration - and sentenced to 2 years probation for the said offences.

30.1 Subsequently, the Accused was also convicted on 8th May 1995 and 6th June
1995 under s 448 of the Penal Code for house trespass and sentenced to 3
months imprisonment for the former offence and under s 9(1) of the Probation
of Offenders Act Cap 252 for having committed further offences during
probation from which he had been sentenced to the Reformative Training Centre
(RTC).

30.2 I took all these offences into consideration as they were recent offences
and bearing in mind at the same time the totality principle that the sentence
should not be a crushing one as all the offences occurred in one transaction,
I sentenced the Accused who had little to say by way of mitigation as follows:

> (i) 1st Charge – Housebreaking under s 458: 2 years imprisonment plus 3
> strokes
>
> (ii) 2nd Charge – Rape under s 376(2)(b): 11 years imprisonment plus 12
> strokes
>
> (iii) 3rd Charge – Unnatural Sex under s 377: 1 year imprisonment
>
> (iv) 7th Charge – Outraging Modesty under s 354A: 2 years imprisonment plus
> 3 strokes of the cane
>
> (v) 9th Charge -
>

>> (a) Robbery under s 392: 3 years imprisonment plus 12 strokes of the cane.

>>

>> (b) Committing Robbery when armed under s 397: 12 strokes of the cane.

>
> Sentences in respect of the 2nd charge of rape and that of robbery i.e. 9th
> charge to run consecutively. The other 3 sentences of imprisonment to run
> concurrently with the 2nd and 9th charges. The maximum number of strokes to
> be imposed shall not exceed 24.
>
> The total sentence of 14 years imprisonment is backdated to 30th March 2000
> being the date of Accused’s arrest and remand.
