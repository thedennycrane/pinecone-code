**_Introduction_**

****

The appellant, Tay Chin Wah, was convicted by the High Court on one charge of
using an arm, namely a .38mm Smith and Wesson revolver, by discharging four
bullets from the said revolver with intent to cause physical injury to one Lee
Yang Ping (`Lee`) and one Soh Keng Ho (`Soh`), at Block 642, Rowell Road,
Singapore, on 22 January 1995 at around 1.10am, an offence punishable with
death under s 4(1) of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14, 1998 Ed) (`the Act`). We
dismissed his appeal against conviction and sentence. We now give our reasons.  
  
**_Facts_**

****

The background of the case can be stated briefly. The appellant`s girlfriend,
Ms Susan Lee Ah Kai (`Susan`) had borrowed $1,000 from Lee, who was an illegal
moneylender. Her loan was guaranteed by Soh. Susan defaulted on the repayment.
On 21 January 1995, at about 11.30pm, Soh spotted Susan and the appellant
along Desker Road, beside Block 642, Rowell Road. Soh called Lee and informed
him of the matter. Soh then confronted Susan at the footpath behind Block 642,
Rowell Road. At around 1.10am of 22 January 1995, Lee arrived at the scene,
and, together with Soh, confronted Susan and the appellant at the void deck of
Block 642, Rowell Road. Lee and Soh demanded repayment of the loan from Susan,
who was unable to pay up. A quarrel then broke out in which the appellant
became involved. It was not disputed that in the course of the quarrel, the
appellant whipped out his revolver, and fired four bullets. Lee was hit in the
left buttock by one of the bullets.  
  
**THE APPELLANT`S STATEMENTS TO THE POLICE**

The appellant gave three pre-trial statements to the Singapore police, in
compliance with s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). All three
statements were admitted as evidence in the trial without challenge from the
defence counsel. The appellant told the police that he had fired the first
shot upwards towards the ceiling of the void deck, because Soh was holding
Susan by the neck and choking her. Soh, who was six or seven feet away from
him, immediately released Susan and fled with Lee. As they were fleeing, he
had fired another three shots in the direction where they ran.  
  
In his first statement, dated 5 June 2000, he stated, inter alia:

> _... All of a sudden [Soh] forced Susan to the wall and squeezed her neck
> with his right hand. Susan appeared to be struggling hard for breath. Both
> the loanshark and [Soh]`s backs were facing me. At that time I was about 20
> feet away from them. I then approached [Soh] and the loanshark. [Soh] had
> already released his grip against Susan`s neck when I approached them. I
> told them not to behave in such a manner as we could always talk things
> over. The said loanshark then pointed his centre finger at me and then
> scolded me ... He appeared aggressive when he was talking to me. I recalled
> that I drew my revolver with my right hand from my right front trousers
> pocket and pointed the gun towards the ceiling. I subsequently fired one
> shot. I could not recall the position of the loanshark, [Soh] and Susan at
> that time. I am unable to recall whether [Soh] and the loanshark were facing
> me or their backs were towards me when I fire the first shot. I also could
> not tell if my first shot hit the ceiling of the void deck of Blk 642 Rowell
> Road. I am currently 67 years old and my memory is failing._

  
  
In a further statement recorded on 6 June 2000, he stated, inter alia:

> _After I fired the first shot, both [Soh] and the loanshark ran towards the
> old shop houses situated along Rowell Road. I did not pay attention exactly
> if anyone of them took cover at the nearest pillar. The place was quite
> dark. I got fed up and I subsequently fired another 3 shots towards the
> direction where [Soh] and the loanshark ran. I was not aware if [Soh] and
> the loanshark were hit by my bullets. Susan was shocked and stunned and she
> remained where she was._

  
  
In a further statement, also recorded on 6 June 2000, he gave the following
responses to questions put to him by the investigating officer:

> _
>
> Q10: During the incident at the void deck of Blk 642 Rowell Road on 22 Jan
> 1995 at about 1 a.m, did [Soh] or the loan shark attack you or assault you?
>
> A10: No. I exchanged vulgar words with [Soh] and the loanshark. There was no
> fight.
>
> Q11: How far were you from [Soh] and the loanshark when you fire your first
> shot from your revolver?
>
> A11: About 20 feet away.
>
> _

  
  
**_The proceedings below_ **

****

The prosecution`s case was that the appellant had fired all four shots at Soh
and Lee, with the intention to cause physical injury to them. The defence`s
case was that the appellant had fired the first shot at the ceiling, without
any intention of causing injury to Soh or Lee. He only wanted to scare them
and to save Susan from being strangled. When they ran off, he was angry and
got carried away and fired three shots in their direction. Although he had
fired the three subsequent shots continuously in the direction of Lee and Soh,
the place was dimly lit and he could not really see them and was not really
aiming at them. He was angry when he fired the last three shots, but he had
not intended to cause physical injury to either Soh or Lee. It was also
submitted by the defence that the bullet which hit Lee was the first shot,
which had ricocheted off the ceiling of the void deck.  
  
No closing submissions were made by the defence counsel at the trial. The
judge found that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant and
convicted him under s 4(1) of the Act.

Under s 4(2) of the Act, any person who uses or attempts to use any firearm is
presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have intended to cause physical
injury to a person or to property. The evidential burden is on the offender.
To rebut the statutory presumption, he must produce sufficient evidence to
prove that he did not intend to cause injury to anyone. In the present case,
we found that the statutory presumption in s 4(2) of the Act had not been
rebutted. It was not disputed that, apart from the first shot, which the
appellant claimed was fired at the ceiling, three consecutive shots were fired
in immediate succession in the direction of Lee and Soh`s retreating figures
as they were fleeing from him. This was not disputed. Yet, the appellant told
the court that he was not actually aiming at Lee and Soh, and had no intention
of causing any physical injury to them. His bare denial of possessing the
requisite intention, however, was far from being sufficient to rebut the
statutory presumption. Indeed, the evidence before the court reinforced the
presumption that he had intended to cause physical injury to Soh and Lee. Even
though, according to him, the area was `very dark` and he could not see them
clearly, he managed to hit Lee in the left buttock. The scientific and medical
evidence debunked the defence`s theory that the bullet which hit Lee was the
first shot, which had ricocheted off the ceiling. Dr Teo Teng Poh (`Dr Teo`),
a Principal Scientific Officer of the Department of Scientific Services, had
examined the bullet which had hit Lee, and he testified in court that the
bullet was slightly distorted, in that its nose was not smooth, but the nose
was still rounded. He opined that it was unlikely that the bullet had
ricocheted off the ceiling, because such a bullet would have a side of its
nose flattened. Moreover, the evidence revealed that Lee`s hand phone, which
was in his rear trouser pocket at the material time, had been hit squarely by
the bullet, instead of at an angle. This was evident from the location of two
craters in the hand phone, stained with lead from a bullet discharged from the
appellant`s revolver. Thus, in Dr Teo`s opinion, it was more likely that the
bullet which had hit Lee was not a ricochet bullet, but had hit the hand phone
squarely and then lodged itself into Lee`s left buttock. Dr Teo did concede
that if the first bullet had ricocheted at a very shallow angle, it was
possible that it would not be flattened on one side. However, as the trial
judge had pointed out, it was unlikely that the bullet could have ricocheted
off the ceiling and hit Lee`s hand phone squarely, instead of at an angle,
when Lee was six to seven feet away, with no ricochet damage to the bullet.  
  
Furthermore, the appellant himself admitted that he had fired the last three
shots out of anger. Those last three shots were clearly not fired in defence
of Susan, for the first shot had been enough to send Soh and Lee fleeing for
their lives, and she was in no mortal danger when he fired the subsequent
three shots. A single shot from his revolver would have been enough to cause
grave physical injury to Soh or Lee, and being aware of that fact, he had
fired not one, but four bullets (which were all the bullets in his revolver),
while in close proximity with Soh and Lee. All this negated his evidence that
he had only intended to scare Soh and Lee, and that he had no intention to
cause them physical injury. The evidence supported, if not an inference, then
the presumption in s 4(2) of the Act, that he had intended to cause physical
injury to Lee and Soh.  
  
Counsel for the appellant made neither written nor oral submissions before us
at the appeal. There was nothing to exculpate the appellant, who was clearly
guilty of the charge against him. In the event, we dismissed his appeal
against conviction and upheld the mandatory death sentence under s 4(1) of the
Act.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
