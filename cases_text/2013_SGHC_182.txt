Choo Han Teck J:

1 The only issue in these two appeals was whether a custodial sentence was
warranted. If it were, there was little room to argue that the 8 and 9 weeks
respectively were manifestly excessive.

2 There were some mitigating factors that were personal to each of the
appellants but in my view, the courts below had already taken those factors
into account and that was why their sentences were among the lowest in the
group of charges that involved the prostitute who went by the professional
name of “Chantelle”.

3 There were three factors that might have an impact on the decision to be
made regarding the appropriateness of custodial sentence for these two
appellants. First, the prostitute concerned was almost of full age; secondly
there was some degree of misrepresentation by her of her age; and thirdly,
that the seriousness of the offence had not been made sufficiently explicit to
the public generally and to the appellants in particular. That was the initial
weakness of Mr Kannan’s argument – that people who skate on thin ice cannot
complain should they fall through the ice. The problem was the absence of a
danger sign then. However, the prospect of this case becoming the danger sign
that was hitherto missing vanished against the stream of new cases.

4 The factors I mentioned had elicited some sympathy from this court. However,
after adjourning to consider the oral submissions of the appellants’ counsel
and perusing the 156 pages of technical arguments of Ng’s counsel, the warmth
of sympathy had turned cold. It turned cold as a result of the many new
offences committed after the appellants’ cases. This court cannot ignore the
continued flow of such cases. It shows that any danger sign would have been of
marginal utility.

5 The circumstances require a strong general deterrence. For such deterrence
to achieve its purpose these appellants cannot be exceptions. They must be
part of the deterrence. For these reasons the appeals are dismissed.
