Introduction

1 The plaintiff filed Suit No 1017 of 2020 on 22 October 2020, claiming
against the defendant for damages (including punitive damages) for losses
suffered as a result of the defendant’s conduct and/or inappropriate behaviour
and/or breach of his implied contractual duties and/or breach of his duty of
care. The plaintiff also claims damages for losses suffered as a result of the
defendant’s breaches of a non-disclosure agreement (the “NDA”) and/or his duty
of confidentiality. 1

Background to the dispute

Mr Chin’s engagement with Writers Studio

6 As mentioned at [4], Mr Chin started working as a tutor with Writers Studio
in early 2018. At that time, no written contract was provided to Mr Chin for
him to sign 7

##### Foot Note 7

and he only conducted English lessons on two days a week. 8

##### Foot Note 8

On 1 March 2018, Mr Chin received his first pay cheque from Writers Studio for
the sum of $1,223.20. 9

##### Foot Note 9

4DE (Writers Studio’s Cheque to Mr Chin dated 1 March 2018).

7 As early as 30 October 2019, Mr Chin requested to “sit down and have a
[formal] talk on [his] future with Writers [S]tudio”. He further offered to
“find a legal firm” if Ms Oh needed him to “draft a contract for [his] service
with Writers [S]tudio”. Ms Oh replied that she already “[had] a contract”
under “teacher mode” and “[n]ot partnership”. 10

7–16.

Nevertheless, parties did not come to any agreement on a written contract. In
early 2020, the parties’ relationship soured.

8 On 25 April 2020, Mr Chin signed a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”). At
10.31am, Ms Oh messaged Mr Chin over WhatsApp stating that Writers Studio
“requests all staff to sign a contract or non-disclosure today within the next
3 hours. Signing on WhatsApp or digitally is fine”. 11

##### Foot Note 11

×

CKYA at para 10; p 69 (Screenshot of WhatsApp Correspondence dated 25 April
2020).

In that same message, Ms Oh further elaborated that it was “due to a security
breach”. Mr Chin eventually signed the document “without seeking legal
advice”. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

CKYA at para 11.

9 For completeness, I note that parties disagree on the reason for the urgent
request to sign the NDA. At trial, Ms Oh consistently stated that the reason
for the urgent request was due to a security breach. 13

##### Foot Note 13

×

Transcript dated 2 November 2021 at p 95, lines 9–13.

Mr Chin, however, believes that Writers Studio “was aware of [his] hectic
schedule and deliberately chose 25 April 2020 to demand the signing of the
NDA” as he “had back-to-back classes” on Saturdays. 14

##### Foot Note 14

×

CKYA at para 11.

However, I emphasise at this juncture that such disagreement on the factual
circumstances surrounding the signing of the NDA is ultimately irrelevant to
the dispute as it is not the defendant’s case that the NDA was not binding on
him.

10 The NDA contained the following salient terms, including a definition for
“Confidential Information”: 15

##### Foot Note 15

Agreed Bundle of Documents (“AB”) at pp 14–16.

Article II: Confidential Information

A. Definitions. Confidential Information is any material, knowledge,

…

Article V: Nature of Relationship

11 On 29 April 2020, Mr Chin asked Ms Oh if she could “hire [him] full time”
as he was working “6 days for Writers [S]tudio and 1 day for [his private
students]” by then. Ms Oh merely replied with a winking face emoji: “😉”. 16

12 On 2 June 2020, Ms Oh and Mr Chin negotiated various terms of Mr Chin’s
engagement by way of emails sent at 1.40am (by Ms Oh) and 10.37am (by Mr
Chin). Mr Chin thereafter sent a WhatsApp message to Ms Oh to inform her of
the same at 10.46am, to which Ms Oh replied that she would “check the email”.

AB at pp 164–166 (Email Correspondence dated 2 June 2020).

13 Following their correspondence over email and WhatsApp, on the same day, Ms

by way of an email chain (the “Agreement”). 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

AB at pp 164–166 (Email Correspondence dated 2 June 2020).

The terms offered by Ms Oh included the following:

(1) Rate per student per lesson : 45% of tuition fee …

(2a) Existing private students will be taxed at $20 rental for 2h slot. New
private students will not be able to take lessons at our premises unless it is
on your off days and the rate is $30 per 2h slot.

2b) payment will be made for make up classes taught by you regardless of
tutor. If your students go to other tutor for make up, we will pay that tutor.

2c) remedial cases: % based on $30 remedial fee if they pay. …

3) Do inform us in advance should you decide to quit teaching at our centre
and should teach the classes under you until the end of term.

(3) The tutor’s teaching hours is according to current tuition timetable. …

(4a) … Payment for tutor’s fees is to be remitted within 5 working days for

up of a rival tuition centre or for other tuition centres. The Science/Math
logo remains as company property unless the company and tutor enters into a
separate contract to release such logo. The avatars for Science and Math
designed by the tutor remain his creative property. Science and Math materials
that are produced by the tutor himself shall not be the property of the
company.

…

(7) This contract is implemented for 12 months.

8) This email represents a draft agreement until both parties have reached
amicable and agreeable terms which which [sic] a black and white document will
be drawn and signed.

14 In the end, no “black and white document” was drawn up under cl 8. 21

##### Foot Note 21

Nevertheless, it is undisputed that Mr Chin replied to Ms Oh, later in the day
at 3.53pm, agreeing to various terms: 22

##### Foot Note 22

CKYA at para 18.3; AB at pp 164–166 (Email Correspondence dated 2 June 2020).

1) fair and agree

2a) private students condition – agree …

2b) pay rate only for current day headcount, make up students will not be
included in my headcount – agree …

2c) remedial students rate - agree

3) extra charges to students upon my approval.

Will give a month notice or until end term if I am to discontinue my service

4a) group payment salary to be done by 7th of every month.

4b) admin fee/rental fee for private students … - agree

5) previous material prepared by typist for math and sci materials will be
Writers [S]tudio’s property and will not be used for new tuition centre.
Current new materials to remain as personal materials.

…

7) agree for 12 months period.

8) await your confirmation

15 Significantly, there were no further replies from Ms Oh to that email on
that day. Ms Oh and Mr Chin did correspond over WhatsApp thereafter, which I
elaborate upon in the next paragraph. However, for completeness, I highlight
at this juncture that it was only on 18 September 2020 that Ms Oh replied to
the same email chain. In that reply, she stated, “Here [are] the contractual
terms we agreed on by email”.

16 Later that day (ie, on 2 June 2020), from 9.06pm to 9.20pm, Ms Oh and Mr
Chin corresponded by way of WhatsApp concerning potential contributions to Mr
Chin’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account: 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

3 PE at p 4 (Screenshot of WhatsApp Correspondence dated 2 June 2020).

[Ms Oh] I need to add a clause on CPF. Freelance – no need to incur CPF.
Contract – have to. Pls advise

[Mr Chin] I worked private previously so no cpf contribution for many years.
I’m open to that idea but I will not insist.

[Ms Oh] I am not sure about your reply actually

[Mr Chin] If Writers [S]tudio gives, I will contribute mine. If Writers
[S]tudio don’t, back to square one with no cpf.

It is not disputed that at all material times, Writers Studio did not make any
contributions to Mr Chin’s CPF account.

The souring of relationship between Mr Chin and Writers Studio

17 Apart from the late payment of Mr Chin’s remuneration and the dispute over
Writers Studio’s lack of provision of materials for the Science class which
led to Mr Chin’s breaking point on 16 September 2020 (on which I elaborate
below), two points of contention relating to communications that soured the
relationship between Ms Oh and Mr Chin were the request by Writers Studio for
Mr Chin to transfer his personal phone number ending with “4599” to Writers
Studio and Mr Chin’s subsequent communication with Writers Studio’s clients
privately.

18 As to the former, Mr Chin explained at the trial that his second number
ending “4599” (the “4599 Number”) was of sentimental value as he had received
it on his “18th birthday” to commemorate the birth of his sister’s child. Mr
Chin explains that a variation of the phrase “I am an uncle” in Chinese,
spoken as “shi wo jiu jiu” sounds like “4599”. 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

Transcript dated 12 November 2021 at p 116, lines 23–31 and p 124, lines 4–29.

For some reason, the 4599 Number was never transferred to Writers Studio
despite the agreement to attend at an M1 outlet to effect transference. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

AB at pp 220–221 (WhatsApp Correspondence dated 13 November 2019).

Ms Oh’s position on the matter is that, despite the number not being
registered under Writers Studio, it still belonged to Writers Studio because
Mr Chin “has said that it belongs to the company”. 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

Transcript dated 2 November 2021 at p 116, lines 14–31.

On 3 November 2020, Mr Chin gave an undertaking to the Court (the
“Undertaking”) that he would, inter alia, terminate the 4599 Number within
five days in summons no 4627 of 2020 (“SUM 4627”). 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

OYYCA at p 533 (Certified Transcript for SUM 4627 dated 3 November 2020 at p
2).

That Undertaking put an end to the matter (ie, the failure to effect
transference) and is therefore not an issue before me. I need not say more on
the matter.

19 The latter point of contention, however, remains before me. Mr Chin sought
Writers Studio’s permission to contact his students privately. This is in
contrast with Writers Studio’s policy that “the teachers have to contact the
parents using a landline located in our office”. 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

Transcript dated 2 November 2021 at p 123, lines 2–6.

Mr Chin likewise knew that Writers Studio had “quite a strict policy against
using a personal or private line to contact the clients or the clients’
parents”. 29

##### Foot Note 29

×

Transcript dated 12 November 2021 at p 1, lines 29–32.

Pursuant to such a policy, Mr Chin was to contact the students through Writers
Studio’s landline before there was any agreement to use the 4599 Number. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

Transcript dated 12 November 2021 at p 106, line 27 to p 107, line 3.

Writers Studio eventually ceded to Mr Chin’s multiple requests to contact his
students privately on 13 November 2019, on the condition that Ms Oh was to be
included in group chats. It was in that context that he had agreed to transfer
his 4599 Number to Writers Studio for it to be used as a company number. In
that way, Mr Chin could protect his own personal interests (by mitigating the
risk of being backstabbed or having words put in his mouth) and Writers Studio
could include that company number on their brochures promoting Innova Studio
and/or Writers Studio. 31

20 What is in dispute is whether Mr Chin was given the latitude to contact
students and/or their parents (the “Clients”) using the 4599 Number only, or
whether he could do so using either of his personal numbers. While Writers
Studio takes the former position, Mr Chin takes the latter. Nevertheless, Mr
Chin admitted that there is no evidence that he was allowed to use his other
personal number to contact the Clients (the “9693 Number”). 32

Mr Chin’s ceasing to work at Writers Studio

21 On 16 September 2020, Mr Chin ceased to work at Writers Studio. However,
parties disagree on whether Mr Chin had resigned (as Ms Oh contends) 33

##### Foot Note 33

Transcript dated 3 November 2021 at p 131, lines 2–3.

or whether he had been terminated by Writers Studio (as Mr Chin contends).
Writer’s Studio’s position is somewhat inconsistent – as counsel confirmed at
the trial, Writers Studio’s claim is not even that Mr Chin had resigned. 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

Transcript dated 3 November 2021 at p 134, lines 6–14.

None of Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin turns on this factual dispute
and I thus need not say any more on the issue.

22 Two issues that led to the parties parting ways was Writers Studio’s late
payment of his fees and failure to share certain teaching materials with him.
In respect of the first issue, it is not disputed that Writers Studio had paid
Mr Chin late on more than one occasion. 35

23 On 12 September 2020, Writers Studio suspected that Mr Chin was taking some
worksheets as his own. Ms Oh received messages from Writers Studio’s typist,
Michelle Phu (“Ms Phu”), informing her that “[n]ormally, Travis don’t want to
put the header on the doc” and asked confirmation from Ms Oh that they were to
“use [I]nnova [S]tudio as header right?” [emphasis added]. Based on the
WhatsApp messages between Ms Oh and Ms Phu, Mr Chin had been requesting the
typist to send him the Microsoft Word versions of the worksheets that Ms Phu
had prepared for him, and to remove Innova Studio’s header from the documents.
Ms Oh instructed the typist not to send Mr Chin the materials that he had
requested as the documents belonged to Writer’s Studio and was confidential
information under the NDA. 41

Mr Chin: No, actually ah (Inaudible). Please tell your parents about that,

“there [were] no classes” that day. Mr Chin thereafter asked for confirmation
of his termination on 17 September 2020, for which no further correspondence
was forthcoming from Writers Studio. 50

51

##### Foot Note 51

×

AB at pp 54–55 (Writers Studio’s Termination Letter dated 19 September 2020).

While this may have led to the disagreement as to whether Mr Chin had resigned
or had his employment terminated by Writers Studio, as mentioned at [21],
nothing turns on this.

30 In summary, on 16 September 2020, Mr Chin had:

(a) informed his students that he had not been paid his remuneration;

(b) encouraged his students to inform their parents that Writers Studio had
not paid him his remuneration;

(c) ended his 3.00pm class early;

(d) cancelled his 5.00pm and 7.00pm classes on short notice; and

(e) declared to the students that he was resigning.

In this judgment, I refer to these acts as his “Conduct”. Mr Chin agreed that
he had “behaved unprofessionally on 16th September 2020” and such behaviour
had caused Writers Studio “to suffer damage”. 52

31 Three further disputes arose after Mr Chin had resigned. The first relates
to teaching materials generated by the parties such as worksheets, PowerPoint
slides and notes for Mr Chin’s classes. Writers Studio also engaged a typist
to help Mr Chin convert his handwritten notes into typed documents. 53

33 The second dispute relates to Mr Chin’s continued teaching of one student,
[B], in breach of his Undertaking to the Court. This issue was raised at the
trial and is not pleaded in the statement of claim. The Undertaking was for Mr
Chin to “not initiate contact with any of [Writers Studio’s Clients] whom [he]
taught whilst he was employed by [Writers Studio] except for the six students
identified in para 4 of the 2nd affidavit of [Ms Oh] dated 12 October 2020”

However, according to Writers Studio, since that student was not named as one

Undertaking.

34 The third dispute relates to Mr Chin’s inappropriate behaviour with Writers
Studio’s students. Sometime in October 2020, another mathematics tutor with
Writers Studio who took over Mr Chin’s mathematics classes, Ting Kwai Meng
(“Mr Ting”), was “very alarmed” by what the students had told him about Mr
Chin’s classes. In that regard, Mr Ting recorded a conversation with himself,
the students and other employees of Writers Studio: 62

Issues over CPF contributions and impact on Writers Studio’s case

35 As mentioned at [16] above, parties did not agree for Mr Chin to be
considered a contracted employee for whom Writers Studio had to make CPF
contributions. Nor did Mr Chin negotiate to be considered as such. Both
parties understood that Writers Studio did not have to pay CPF contributions
to a freelancer and Mr Chin was at all material times engaged “privately”. Mr
Chin also agrees that he ultimately gave Writers Studio the “choice” to
contribute to his CPF. 64

The parties’ cases

Writers Studio’s pleaded case

38 Writers Studio claims for: 69

##### Foot Note 69

×

SDB at pp 36–37 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2)).

(a) Damages (to be assessed) for losses suffered as a result of Mr Chin’s
Conduct and/or Inappropriate Behaviour and/or breach of his implied
contractual duties.

(b) Punitive damages (to be assessed) for Mr Chin’s Conduct and/or his
Inappropriate Behaviour and/or breach of his duty of care owed to Writers
Studio.

(c) Damages (to be assessed) for the losses suffered as a result of Mr Chin’s
breaches of the NDA and/or duty of confidentiality.

I elaborate on each of the duties as pleaded by Writers Studio in turn.

39 Writers Studio pleads that there is “no written contract” between the
parties. Nevertheless, the “following terms were implied into [Mr Chin’s]
engagement”: (a) a duty of obedience “to comply with [Writers Studio’s]
orders” (namely, to “comply with the schedule of classes set out” and teach
such classes); and (b) a duty of fidelity and good faith (namely, to be
“professional in the carrying out of his duties, to and to [sic] ensure that
[Writers Studio’s] confidential information is not abused by him during his
engagement and after his termination”). 70

##### Foot Note 70

×

SDB at pp 20–21 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 6).

It was only in its later pleading that Writers Studio avers that Mr Chin
breached such duty of fidelity and good faith by his “usage of social media
platforms and mobile gaming applications to contact and/or interact with the
Clients” in that it is “wholly unprofessional for [Mr Chin] to do so”. 71

##### Foot Note 71

×

SDB at pp 62 (Reply (Amendment No 1) at para 11).

Writers Studio made no averments as to whether the duty of obedience was
breached by Mr Chin, save that he had ended his 3.00pm class prematurely and
refused to teach the 5.00pm and 7.00pm classes on short notice on 16 September
2020. 72

##### Foot Note 72

×

SDB at pp 29–30 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 17.4–17.5).

Nevertheless, Writers Studio does not plead that Mr Chin breached the implied
duty of obedience as such.

40 Writers Studio also avers that Mr Chin owed it a duty of care “by virtue of
the fact that [Mr Chin] was engaged to provide tutoring services” to its
Clients. That duty of care entailed Mr Chin “conduct[ing] himself n [sic] a
manner which could be expected of a reasonable tutor to young children”. 73

##### Foot Note 73

×

SDB at p 21 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 6A).

41 As for Mr Chin’s duty of confidentiality, Writers Studio avers that Mr Chin
was “well aware of his confidentiality obligations”. Such confidentiality
obligations include Mr Chin refraining from contacting Writers Studio’s
Clients privately (save for in certain situations such as that elaborated at
[19] above). This is because Writers Studio considers its Clients’ contact
details as confidential information. 74

##### Foot Note 74

×

SDB at pp 24–25 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at paras 10–12).

Writers Studio avers that Mr Chin breached such duty by his “habitually
[giving] out his mobile number” to Writers Studio’s Clients in his classes and
“encouraged them to contact him privately”. Writers Studio’s Clients did so
and “communicate[d] with [Mr Chin] privately”. Mr Chin also “had been
contacting [the] Clients through social media platform(s)”. 75

##### Foot Note 75

×

SDB at pp 28–29 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 16).

These alleged breaches were discovered on 12 September 2020. Furthermore, by
“failing to return” the 4599 Number to Writers Studio, Mr Chin “had been in
breach of the NDA as he had accessed and/or used the Confidential Information”
through the 4599 Number. 76

##### Foot Note 76

×

SDB at pp 61 (Reply (Amendment No 1) at para 8.9).

42 However, as against the conditions under which Mr Chin was allowed to
communicate with Writers Studio’s Clients privately, Writers Studio’s
averments are inconsistent. In the earlier part of its pleadings, Writers
Studio avers that Ms Oh “had to be added into a WhatsApp group chat with the
Client and/or be made aware of the communications”. 77

##### Foot Note 77

×

SDB at p 25 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 12).

In the later part of its pleadings, Writers Studio avers that the “only form
of client communication [it] had approved for [Mr Chin’s] usage was via
WhatsApp group chats with the Clients and Ms Oh”. 78

##### Foot Note 78

×

SDB at pp 61–62 (Reply (Amendment No 1) at para 10).

43 Writers Studio also pleads that it had discovered “further breaches” by Mr
Chin from 23–29 September 2020. In particular, Writers Studio found that Mr
Chin had visited five addresses (ie, the six addresses, save for the the
second student’s address) which correspond with the addresses of Writers
Studio’s Clients who had withdrawn following Mr Chin’s termination. Writers
Studio “strongly believe[s] that [Mr Chin] has been conducting tuition” at
those addresses and “would have only gotten these addresses and/or contact
information through his employment with [Writers Studio]”. As such, Writers
Studio applied for an injunction vide SUM 4627. 79

##### Foot Note 79

×

SDB at pp 33–35 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at paras 28–30).

44 Mr Chin’s confidentiality obligations also extended to “the materials
created by [Writers Studio], and/or materials used in teaching at [Writers
Studio’s] premises”. The materials provided to Mr Chin “bore [Writers
Studio’s] letterhead”. 80

##### Foot Note 80

×

SDB at pp 24–25 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 10).

Also on 12 September 2020, Writers Studio discovered that Mr Chin “had been
requesting for the typist to send him the Microsoft Word versions of the
worksheets” and to “remove” Writers Studio’s and Innova Studio’s header from
such documents. Writers Studio’s typist was thus informed to not send such
materials to Mr Chin as the documents “belonged to [Writers Studio]” and is
“confidential information under the NDA”. 81

##### Foot Note 81

×

SDB at p 28 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 15).

45 To clarify, Writers Studio adopts a slightly different meaning for the
abbreviation “Conduct”. Writers Studio’s definition of “Conduct” includes Mr
Chin’s statement that Writers Studio did “not provide him with any materials
despite the fact that [it] provide[d] the materials to [Mr Chin] on a weekly
basis” as well as Mr Chin’s declaration to “relief teachers present that he
was resigning” [emphasis added] in addition to only his students. 82

##### Foot Note 82

×

SDB at pp 29–30 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 17).

For completeness, Writers Studio avers that it terminated Mr Chin on 19
September 2020 “due to his Conduct”. 83

##### Foot Note 83

×

SDB at p 30 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 20).

Nevertheless, as Writers Studio did not address those specific sub-points as
such (ie, these specific statements made to specific persons and how such
statements to such individuals caused any loss to Writers Studio), I gather
that Writers Studio’s true contention is in respect of Mr Chin’s other acts
which I abbreviated at [30] above.

46 Writers Studio pleads that it suffered loss of goodwill and/or reduction in
business due to Mr Chin’s Conduct and/or Inappropriate Behaviour and/or breach
of duty of care. It avers that its business is “based firmly on their
reputation and goodwill with their clients”. Mr Chin’s conduct in “defaming”
Writers Studio and/or “poaching” and/or “approaching [Writers Studio’s
Clients]” and/or Conduct and/or Inappropriate Behaviour and/or breach of duty
of care damaged Writers Studio’s reputation “and caused them to suffer
irreparable financial harm”. Writers Studio avers that 39 students “including
the Primary 6 students who would have engaged [it] to prepare for Secondary 1”
had withdrawn since Mr Chin’s termination on 19 September 2020, as compared to
11 students who had withdrawn in 2019. Such an “unprecedented” rate of
withdrawal is “due solely to [Mr Chin’s] [c]onduct”. 84

47 Mr Chin denies Writers Studio’s amendment to the statement of claim that he
is not an employee but was instead engaged as a contractor. 85

##### Foot Note 85

×

SDB at p 41 (Defence at para 3).

Rather, Mr Chin pleads that there is an “implied contract of service” between
the parties pursuant to which he was employed as an employee. However, the
terms of employment were “deliberately not put into writing” as Writers Studio
“wanted to keep [Mr Chin’s] contractual relationship with [it] vague” so as to
enable it to “unilaterally change terms of [his] employment”. 86

##### Foot Note 86

×

SDB at pp 41–42 (Defence at para 3).

48 According to Mr Chin, the parties’ “agreement and arrangement” was that he
“had the right not to attend, not to extend and/or reject classes”. 87

##### Foot Note 87

×

SDB at p 43 (Defence at para 5).

It was also “an implied term” of his employment that “salary was to be paid on
the 7th of each month”. As such, by failing to pay his salary on time on
multiple occasions, Writers Studio “is in breach of its implied employment
contract”. 88

##### Foot Note 88

Mr Chin’s employment was eventually terminated on 19 September 2020. 89

Mr Chin’s pleading, however, goes no further to particularise the denial of
the “implied contractual duties” which Writers Studio pleaded (see [39]
above). Nor does it particularise the denial of a duty of care owed to Writers
Studio (or any breach of such duty). 90

##### Foot Note 90

SDB at p 47 (Defence at para 17).

In respect of those classes, Mr Chin avers that he did so as he “was feeling
unwell and thus had to end his lessons early and cancel the rest of his
scheduled classes for the day”. 92

##### Foot Note 92

SDB at p 47 (Defence at para 18).

Mr Chin also denies any Inappropriate Behaviour and avers that he “did not
molest, touch[,] [interact] and/or [communicate] with [Writers Studio’s]
Clients inappropriately”. In particular, Mr Chin avers that he has “never made
sexual comments and/or describe[d] sexual matters to the students while
teaching in class and/or touch[ed] the students inappropriately”. 93

##### Foot Note 93

SDB at p 51 (Defence at para 30).

50 Mr Chin denies that he owed a duty of confidentiality and that he breached
such duty. Mr Chin avers that Ms Oh was “inconsistent on her position on what
was confidential information and whether [he] could use” such information. In
particular, Writers Studio told Mr Chin that he could “contact the clients on
his own”, “take all the clients” and “even added [his] private [numbers]
together in WhatsApp group chat with parents”. The 4599 Number had also been
printed on brochures and “circulated to the public” by Writers Studio. Writers
Studio’s clients’ contact details “lost its quality of confidentiality” when
they “reached out to contact [Mr Chin] voluntarily disclosing and making
available their contact details”. Therefore, once the Clients “initiated
contact” in such a manner, Mr Chin “would not be in breach of the NDA in
maintaining contact” with the Clients. 94

Substantive issues to be determined

52 As mentioned at the outset, the trial before me is bifurcated and I only
need to determine liability. The following issues arise for my determination:

(a) Whether Mr Chin was engaged by Writers Studio pursuant to an implied
employment contract at the material time and, consequently, whether Mr Chin
was an employee of Writers Studio (“Issue 1”).

(b) Whether Mr Chin caused loss by breaching implied terms containing the duty
of obedience and duty of fidelity and good faith (“Issue 2”).

(c) Whether Mr Chin caused loss by breaching a general duty of care (“Issue
3”).

(d) Whether Mr Chin caused loss by breaching the NDA and/or duty of
confidentiality (“Issue 4”).

53 I address each issue in turn.

Issue 1: the parties’ contractual relationship and the nature of Mr Chin’s
engagement with Writers Studio

The parties’ contractual relationship

54 It is not in dispute that Mr Chin had entered into an engagement of some
form with Writers Studio; it is also not disputed that this engagement has not
been captured in writing. However, before I can proceed to determine the exact
nature of this engagement, I note that Mr Chin has pleaded the presence of an
implied contract between the parties. There are two points of concern arising
from this. The first is that the fact that the contract is not put into
writing does not automatically militate against the existence of an express
contract. The second is that the pleadings confusingly flit between references
to implied contracts and implied contractual duties and terms, which are
distinct concepts. The former is concerned with making out the existence of a
contractual relationship; the latter is concerned with making out the terms of
an existing contract. In light of the looseness with which the descriptor
“implied” has been used in Mr Chin’s pleadings, I think it appropriate to
briefly allude to the legal principles governing the concept of an implied
contract.

The applicable legal principles

55 In the law of contract, contracts can be implied from a course of conduct;
dealings between the parties; from their correspondence or from all other
circumstances. However, “all the requirements for the formation of a contract,
viz, offer and acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations,
and certainty of terms must be satisfied before the court will imply the
existence of a contract”: Cooperatiehahahave Centrale Raiffeisen-
Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v
Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd [2011] 2 SLR 63 at [46] citing Modahl v British
Athletic Federation Ltd [2002] 1 WLR 1192 at [49]–[51]. Such an implied
contract could also, conceptually, take the form of a collateral contract: Eng
Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal [2016]
4 SLR 728 (“Eng Chiet Shoong”) at [29]. That being said, an implied contract
will only be found in very limited circumstances, based on necessity and
having regard to the intentions of the parties. The precise facts and
circumstances of each case will therefore be important: Eng Chiet Shoong at
[29].

56 The policy consideration behind such a high threshold is clear – that
commercial certainty must be ensured in the business context. As the Court of
Appeal observed in Ang Sin Hock v Khoo Eng Lim [2010] 3 SLR 179 at [76]:

There is, admittedly, the danger of too much commercial uncertainty being
generated. However, this danger can be met by the court requiring clear proof
that the legal requirements of a binding contract have, indeed, been satisfied
on the facts … as well as (from an attitudinal perspective) being generally
reluctant to find a collateral contract which ought to remain a finding of
last resort.

Analysis and findings

57 Notably, neither party made any submissions as to the subsisting contract
between parties at the material time although they both agree that there was
no written contract governing their relationship. In any event, I did not
think it necessary to consider whether a contract needs to be implied. It is
clear that there was an oral contract in existence because Mr Chin had been
teaching in Writers Studio and the latter had been paying him for the work.

58 In my judgment, it is sufficiently clear that at the material time, Mr Chin
was engaged by Writers Studio pursuant to their Agreement which is recorded in
the email chain between Ms Oh and Mr Chin (see [13]–[16] above). Ms Oh’s
initial email constituted the terms of engagement offered by Writers Studio,
while Mr Chin’s reply constituted an acceptance to some of those terms (by
expressly indicating “agree”) and a counteroffer to others (by proposing
slightly different terms). Even though no reply to Mr Chin’s counteroffers
were immediately forthcoming, I take that Ms Oh accepted Mr Chin’s
counteroffers for two reasons.

59 First, Ms Oh replied to that same email thread on 18 September 2020 that
those were the “contractual terms [they] agreed on by email”. Secondly,
parties also conducted themselves in accordance with the terms which Mr Chin
had set out in his email. For example, Mr Chin and Ms Oh proceeded on the
basis that Mr Chin was to be paid 45% of the tuition fees collected (see cl 1
which Mr Chin agreed to). 97

##### Foot Note 97

×

AB at p 243 (Screenshot of WhatsApp Correspondence dated 16 August 2020).

Furthermore, and in accordance with cl 4a of Mr Chin’s email, parties operated
on the understanding that Mr Chin was to be paid by the 7th of every month. At
trial, Ms Oh also accepted that if Mr Chin did not receive his pay by the 7th
of every month, then such payment would be considered “late”. 98

##### Foot Note 98

×

Transcript dated 2 November 2021 at p 85, lines 19–31.

On the evidence before me, it is sufficiently clear that such a term (ie, the
date by which Mr Chin was to be paid) is an express term and not an implied
term in an implied contract as Mr Chin pleads. 99

##### Foot Note 99

×

SDB at p 47 (Defence (Amendment No 2) at para 19).

60 In light of my finding that an express oral contract existed between the
parties, the next question is whether under this contract, Mr Chin had been
engaged as an employee or as a freelancer.

Employment relationships

61 Whether a person is an employee (as opposed to a freelancer) depends on the
totality of the factual matrix of any given case. In contractual terms, the
issue is whether a person is engaged under a contract of service (in which
case a person would be considered an employee) or only a contract for service
(in which case that person would be considered an independent contractor).
There is no single test or factor which is decisive of the issue (Kureoka
Enterprise Pte Ltd v Central Provident Fund Board [1992] SGHC 113
(“Kureoka”)). In Kureoka, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) found the
following factors relevant in the case before him:

(a) the factor of control over the worker’s services;

(b) the rendering of services personally without being able to use a
substitute;

(c) the worker’s responsibility for investment in, or management of, the
business or financial risk in it;

(d) the worker’s right to price the value of services to clients;

(e) the worker’s opportunity to deploy individual skill and personality;

(f) the contractual right to terminate the worker’s services;

(g) whether the worker is performing services as a person of business on
his/her own account; and

(h) the mutuality of obligation between the parties.

62 The Court of Appeal in BNM (administratrix of the estate of B, deceased) on
her own behalf and on behalf of others v National University of Singapore and
others and another appeal [2014] 4 SLR 931 (“BNM”) also confirmed that the
control test is “not the only test for determining whether a contractor is an
independent contractor, nor is it even necessarily the decisive factor” (at
[28]). In BNM, the Court of Appeal found the following factors relevant in
finding that a company provided a contract for services to the respondent (at
[31]–[32]):

(a) that the company bore the responsibility for paying the worker’s wages;

(b) that the company had the responsibility for scheduling the worker’s
roster;

(c) that the company had the power to dismiss worker from employment;

(d) the company’s supervision and oversight of the worker in his/her duties;

(e) the company’s responsibility for training the worker in the use of
equipment;

(f) the company’s power and authority to dictate how the worker discharged
his/her duties;

(g) the company’s responsibility for providing the worker’s equipment;

(h) the company’s undertaking of the financial risks of running its business;

(i) the company selected the worker for deployment at the respondent’s
premises;

(j) the company provided services to other institutions apart from the
respondent’s; and

(k) the company retained the profits from its business and took out its own
insurance.

The parties’ submissions

63 Writers Studio takes the position that Mr Chin was, at all material times,
not an employee and makes two points in that regard. First, it submits that
the following facts show that Mr Chin was an independent contractor: 100

Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at paras 10–13.

(a) Mr Chin had the freedom to: (i) set his own teaching schedule and/or
working hours, (ii) set the fees to be charged for each student and/or class
taught and (iii) continue teaching private lessons to his own clients outside
of Writers Studio’s premises.

(b) Mr Chin’s remuneration was based on the number of students and/or classes
taught at Writers Studio (including earning a percentage of the revenue earned
from his group classes).

(c) Mr Chin did not receive a basic salary or any leave benefits.

(d) Mr Chin left open the issue of whether he should receive CPF from Writers
Studio.

64 Second, Writers Studio submits that the use of the word “employment” in its
pleadings was, as Ms Oh had testified, intended to refer to “employment” in a
colloquial sense. Writers Studio relies on Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore vol 9

In common parlance, the term ‘employment’ may be used to indicate a variety of
distinct relationships, including the relationship between a principal and his
agent as well as the relationship between an independent contractor and the
person seeking his services.

65 Mr Chin submits that he was nevertheless an employee, based on the
following factors:

(a) Mr Chin drew a “salary” and had to teach the classes which Writers Studio
had given to him.

(b) The email negotiations on 2 June 2020 (see [13]–[14] above) “allude to the
terms which one can expect of typical employer-employee relationships”.

(c) Writers Studio maintained that Mr Chin is an employee in “various
correspondences, pleadings and even on affidavit up until the CPF Board
commenced investigations”.

(d) The non-payment of CPF is a neutral factor which was part of Writers
Studio’s intention to keep Mr Chin’s status as an employee “ambiguous”. 102

Analysis and findings

66 While the determination of an employee-employer relationship is informed by
the totality of the factual matrix of the case, one reasonable starting point
is to consider the contractual relationship between the worker and the entity
that engaged that worker.

67 Considering the terms of the parties’ Agreement, I find that Mr Chin was
engaged as an independent contractor under an employment for service. Contrary
to Mr Chin’s submissions, whether the parties used the word “salary” instead
of “remuneration” is not indicative of an employee-employer relationship. The
terms in the Agreement likewise do not indicate a contract of service but
rather, a contract for service:

(a) Mr Chin did not earn a fixed salary but was remunerated with 45% of the
tuition fees of the students whom he taught at Writers Studio.

(b) Mr Chin paid rent for the rooms at Writers Studio’s premises when he
taught private students.

(c) There was no term conferring Writers Studio the right to terminate Mr
Chin’s engagement (and, to the contrary, Mr Chin could simply quit teaching if
he wished to do so).

(d) Teaching materials prepared by Mr Chin remained his own property (and not
Writers Studio’s property).

(e) Mr Chin received no benefits from Writers Studio (such as paid leave,
medical benefits and dental benefits unlike Writers Studio’s other employees

).

68 Furthermore, Mr Chin set his own teaching schedule subject to Writers
Studio’s approval. In particular, Mr Chin could give Writers Studio a schedule
which he could commit to, and parties would mutually agree on such timings
which worked for both of them. 104

The degree of control which Writers Studio exercised over Mr Chin’s services
was, at best, limited.

69 My conclusion is also supported by the parties’ correspondence at the time
they were confirming Mr Chin’s contract. The contemporaneous evidence between
the parties (see [16] above) clearly demonstrate that both Ms Oh and Mr Chin
appreciated that Writers Studio need not contribute to a freelancer’s (ie,
independent contractor’s) CPF. When asked specifically about that, Mr Chin was
happy to let Writers Studio decide whether to keep engaging him as a
freelancer without the need to make any CPF contributions. In this regard, Mr
Chin had “left the CPF issue” to Writer’s Studio and their arrangement was not
changed. 105

70 For completeness, I make one final point on Writers Studio’s pleadings and
Ms Oh’s testimony regarding the use of the word “employment”. I agree with Mr
Chin’s position that Writers Studio initially pleaded that Mr Chin was an
employee only to support its own case that he owed certain duties (such as the
duty of obedience, fidelity and good faith). 106

Such litigation tactics also explain why Writers Studio made such changes so
late in the day to delete most references to an “employment” contract (save
for one reference 107

) – by then, it simply was no longer to Writers Studio’s advantage to plead
that Mr Chin was its employee due to the CPF Board’s investigations.

71 However, after changing its pleaded case, Writers Studio did not bother to
make any consequential amendments to its pleadings. In particular, despite now
pleading that Mr Chin is not an employee, it pleaded that he nevertheless owed
duties of obedience, fidelity and good faith without further particulars of
how such duties arose in the circumstances of the present case. I consider
this point further below.

Issue 2: whether Mr Chin caused loss to Writers Studio by breaching a duty of
obedience and duty of fidelity and good faith

72 The duties of obedience, fidelity and good faith are not implied in law
into contracts for services. Any such duties may only be implied in fact.

The parties’ case

73 Writers Studio submits that it pleaded the following terms “should be
implied into [Mr Chin’s] engagement”: a duty of obedience (ie, to “comply”
with Writers Studio’s “professional standards and client contact protocol”);
and a duty of fidelity and good faith (ie, to be “professional in the carrying
out of his duties” and “ensure” that Writers Studio’s “confidential
information is not abused by him during his engagement and after his
termination”) 108

##### Foot Note 108

. Even though Writers Studio appreciates that the “implied duties typically
apply to employment contracts”, they are “necessary for the business efficacy
of the contract for service” between parties. In particular, if Mr Chin was
“allowed to flout” Writers Studio’s professional standards, it would suffer
“damage, and the quality of the teaching services provided by [Mr Chin] would
be poor and unacceptable”. 109

The applicable legal principles

75 It is common ground that there is no implied term for a duty of obedience
and duty of fidelity and good faith in law since there is no employer-employee
relationship in the present case. Such duties are implied terms in law in
employment contracts (Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D & F Man
International (S) Pte Ltd v Wong Bark Chuan David [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“Man
Financial”) at [193]). As such, the applicable legal principles for an implied
term in fact are relevant.

76 The Court of Appeal in Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and
another and another appeal [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“Sembcorp”) set out a three-step
test for implying a term in fact (at [101]):

(a) Step 1. Ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be
considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties
did not contemplate the gap (ie, there is a “true” gap).

(b) Step 2. Determine whether it is necessary in the business or commercial
sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy.

(c) Step 3. Consider whether the specific term to be implied is one to which
the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have
responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of
the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the
gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.

77 In Sembcorp, the Court of Appeal explained that “not all gaps in a contract
are “true” gaps in the sense that they can be remedied by the implication of a
term” and in that respect, there are at least three ways in which a gap could
arise (at [94]):

(a) The parties did not contemplate the issue at all and so left a gap.

(b) The parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide a term for it
because they mistakenly thought that the express terms of the contract had
adequately addressed it.

(c) The parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide any term for
it because they could not agree on a solution.

However, it is only in scenario (a) where it would be “appropriate for the
court to even consider if it will imply a term into the parties’ contract” (at
[95]).

78 Bearing the foregoing principles in mind, I turn to consider whether the
alleged duties of fidelity, obedience and good faith may be implied in fact in
the present case.

Analysis and findings

79 I begin with two preliminary observations on Writers Studio’s pleaded case.
From the outset, I find Writers Studio’s submissions to be somewhat
disingenuous. In particular, Writers Studio gives the impression that it had
pleaded that a duty of “obedience” meant the duty to “comply” with Writers
Studio’s professional standards and client contact protocol (see [73] above).
That is a deviation from its pleaded case that a duty of “obedience” meant
compliance with “the schedule of classes set out” and to teach such classes
(see [39] above). This demonstrates to me that Writers Studio is not even
clear of its own case and shifted the goal posts as part of its own litigation
strategy.

80 My second observation is that Writers Studio does not even plead the
contract into which such alleged terms are to be implied in fact. The three-
step test summarised above assumes and necessarily hinges on the existence of
some subsisting contract between the parties before the first step can even be
considered. Without the proper identification of any contract (such as an oral
contract) between the parties, the three-step test is simply inapplicable. In
my judgment, this is fatal, and sufficient to dispose of Writers Studio’s
claim for breach of such implied terms.

81 For completeness, I consider whether the duties of obedience, fidelity and
good faith are implied terms in the parties’ Agreement. In my judgment, this
issue must be answered in the negative. Based on the parties’ contemporaneous
correspondence, I accept that there is a “true” gap in relation to the alleged
duties. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded by Writers Studio’s argument that the
alleged duties to be implied pass the business efficacy test. Writers Studio’s
argument that such duty must be implied to prevent Writers Studio from
suffering damage and to ensure the “quality” of teaching services were
acceptable to it is not the test to determine business efficacy. I am also of
the view that the alleged duties to be implied flatly fail the officious
bystander test. These alleged implied terms are not entirely clear.
Consequently, I am of the view that had such unclear terms been put to parties
at the time of contracting, the response would not have been an emphatic “Oh,
of course!”.

82 Even if such duties were implied in fact, the facts upon which Writers
Studio seeks to substantiate its claim for breach of the same (ie, the Conduct
and Inappropriate Behaviour) are insufficient to make out its case. I
elaborate on this at [115] below. As for the breach by failing to comply with
Writers Studio’s client contact protocol, Writers Studio made its submissions
in relation to the NDA, which I consider at Issue 4 below.

Issue 3: whether Mr Chin caused loss to Writers Studio by breaching a duty of
care

83 Apart from its claim in contract, Writers Studio also claims against Mr
Chin in the tort of negligence. The specific acts complained of are Mr Chin’s
alleged Conduct and Inappropriate Behaviour – which also found Writers
Studio’s claim for punitive damages against Mr Chin.

The applicable legal principles

84 Where Singapore is concerned, the locus classicus remains the Court of
Appeal decision in Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &
Technology Agency [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“Spandeck”). In the present case,
applying the Spandeck framework, I was satisfied that there was legal
proximity between the parties which justified the imposition of a prima facie
duty of care. Further, there were no policy reasons which militated against
the imposition of a duty of care. I explain.

85 In Spandeck, the Court of Appeal set out a two-stage test to determine
whether a defendant owes a plaintiff a duty of care. The two-stage test is
preceded by the threshold requirement of factual foreseeability which is
concerned with the “requirement of reasonable foreseeability from a factual
perspective” [emphasis in original] (Spandeck at [75]–[76] citing Sunny Metal
& Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric (practising under the name and style
of W P Architects [2007] 1 SLR(R) 853 at [55], AYW v AYX [2016] 1 SLR 1183
(“AYW”) at [51]).

86 The threshold question of factual or reasonable foreseeability, ie, whether
the defendant ought to have known that the claimant would suffer from the
defendant’s carelessness, is a requirement which would be fulfilled in almost
all cases as the two parties are likely to be in some degree of physical
relationship (Spandeck at [75]–[76]). In the present case, I was satisfied
that this threshold requirement of factual foreseeability was crossed. I
therefore move on to consider the first stage of the Spandeck framework. Here,
the key question is whether there is sufficient legal proximity between the
plaintiff and the defendant. The focus of the inquiry at this stage is the
closeness of the relationship between the parties which includes physical,
circumstantial and causal proximity, supported by the twin criteria of
voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance (Spandeck at [77] and
[81]; Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG [2011] 4 SLR 559 (“Go Dante
Yap”) at [19]–[20], Animal Concerns Research & Education Society v Tan Boon
Kwee [2011] 2 SLR 146 (“Animal Concerns”) at [29]–[74]),

87 In the present case, Writers Studio submits that Mr Chin “should be found
to owe a duty of care” to them since it had “entrusted” the “young and
impressionable” students to Mr Chin 114

##### Foot Note 114

Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 15.

. Writers Studio argues, citing Spandeck, that there is a “clear proximity”
between the parties and there are “strong policy considerations that support
the imposition of a duty of care”. 115

##### Foot Note 115

×

Plaintiff’s Opening Statement at para 11.

I make one observation about the manner in which Writers Studio has presented
this argument in its written submissions. While it is perfectly fine to state
the elements of the Spandeck framework, more attention should be paid to the
facts of the cases adduced in support of one’s argument that the court should
find that a duty of care is owed in the present case. The Spandeck framework
is not a magic spell, the mere invocation of which, without more, will
automatically compel the court to find that a duty of care is owed.

88 That much is clear from Spandeck itself. In that case, the Government of
Singapore (the “Government”) had awarded the appellant a contract to redevelop
a medical facility at an army camp. Pursuant to the contract, the respondent
was appointed as the superintending officer of the project and was responsible
for certifying interim payments in respect of the appellant’s work done. While
the contract precluded the appellant from claiming against the Government
damages for the failure or delay of the respondent in certification, the
contract did provide that the appellant had the right to claim the amounts
which were under-certified and interest thereon by commencing arbitration
proceedings against the Government.

89 Because of this, the appellant chose not to continue with the revision of
the summary of tender and the cost breakdown for the contract, and
subsequently novated the contract to another contractor, suffering losses in
the process. The appellant claimed against the respondent, arguing that the
respondent owed it a duty of care. The Court of Appeal was satisfied that no
duty of care was owed because the requirement of legal proximity was not met
(Spandeck at [108]). In arriving at this conclusion, the Court of Appeal took
the view that the salient facts in Pacific Associates Inc v Baxter [1990] 1 QB
993 (“Pacific Associates”) were materially the same as the facts before it
(Spandeck at [97] – [98]):

[97] Adopting an incremental approach with respect to the requirement of
proximity, we found the salient facts in Pacific Associates to be materially
the same as those in the present case. The claimant in Pacific Associates was
a contractor engaged in dredging work under the supervision of the defendant
engineer who was retained by the employer. The claimant’s contract with the
employer contained clauses providing that the engineer would not be personally
liable for acts under the contract and providing for the arbitration of
disputes between the contractor and the employer. The contractor claimed that
the geological information in the tender document issued by the engineer had
under-estimated the amount of hard materials to be dredged and that the
engineer had acted negligently in rejecting the contractor’s claims for extra
payment for removal of unforeseen hard materials. The contractor recovered
some of its alleged losses from the employer following an arbitration
settlement and then sought to recover the balance through a negligence action
against the employer.

[98] The Court of Appeal held (at 1032) that it would not be reasonable to
impose a Hedley Byrne … duty on the engineer because it “would cut across and
be inconsistent with the structure of relationships created by the contracts,
into which the parties had entered”.

90 To unpack this a little, the Court of Appeal in Spandeck arrived at its
decision in the following manner: in Pacific Associates, the court there made
a finding that there was no legal proximity based on certain material facts.
The same material facts were also present in Spandeck, and so this justified a
finding that there was no legal proximity and thus no prima facie duty of care
owed.

91 Here, the facts are slightly different from that in Spandeck – in that
case, the appellant and respondent had no direct contractual relationship,
whereas in the present case, Writers Studio had engaged Mr Chin as an
independent contractor under an employment for service (above at [67]). The
more appropriate decision for comparison, in my view, would be the decision in
Go Dante Yap. In that case, the appellant had opened two accounts with the
respondent bank. Both accounts were handled by one Ms Ching, who was employed
by the respondent. In opening the accounts, the appellant executed three sets
of contractual documents which, amongst other things, gave the appellant the
final say in deciding what securities to purchase or sell. Ms Ching entered
into 16 investments on the appellant’s behalf, and met the appellant on a
monthly basis to review the performance of the investments and their projected
returns. The investments were subsequently liquidated, but the appellant
suffered significant losses on three of the investments as a result of the
Asian Financial Crisis. The appellant sued the respondent, alleging, amongst
other things, that the respondent owed him a duty of care to advise him on his
investments.

92 The Court of Appeal found, when it heard the appeal, that there was clearly
legal proximity between the parties: Go Dante Yap at [31]. As the court
reasoned (at [34]–[35]):

[34] As we alluded at [20] above, the implied contractual duty of skill and
care owed by the Respondent to the Appellant under the Account-opening
Documents was sufficient to create the necessary proximity required by a duty
of care in tort. Indeed, it was difficult to imagine a clearer example of “an
assumption by one party of a responsibility to take care to avoid or prevent
injury, loss or damage” to another party (see [31] above) than a contractual
duty to exercise care and skill, and it was plain that Lord Goff had just such
a possibility in mind in Henderson v Merrett (at 180 (see [33] above) and
187), a conclusion which was also reached by Lord Devlin with specific
reference to banks and their customers in Hedley Byrne (see [32] above).

[35] However, even leaving aside the contractual framework established by the
Account-opening Documents, by analogy with Lord Goff’s reasoning, there was
unmistakeably an assumption of responsibility in the relevant sense by the
Respondent towards the Appellant. The Respondent accepted the Appellant as
someone whose money and assets were under its control, and on whose behalf it
could and was expected to expend considerable sums in order to acquire various
investments. It could hardly be denied that the Respondent, in offering
private banking and wealth-management facilities, held itself out as
possessing special skill or expertise (a concept that was to be understood
broadly (see Henderson v Merrett at 180)) to manage investments and transact
in emerging market securities, or to search for and recommend such investments
(which Ms Ching in fact did (see [100] of the Judgment)). The Appellant, as Ms
Ching well knew, placed implicit reliance upon that expertise, in that he gave
her (and therefore the Respondent) authority to bind him to purchases of the
Bakrie bonds and the Rossiyskiy notes, as well as other securities. Given that
Ms Ching was so placed that the Appellant could reasonably rely upon her
judgment, skill or her ability to make careful inquiry, and given also that
she was actively giving information or advice to the Appellant (in the form of
recommending suitable investments to him and, by her own evidence, advising
him of the pros and cons of those investments), who, as she should have known,
would place reliance on her judgment, skill and ability to take care (see Lord
Morris’s statement of principle at [32] above), it was difficult to resist the
conclusion that, in line with Hedley Byrne and Henderson v Merrett, there was
sufficient proximity between the parties to give rise to a prima facie duty of
care in the tort of negligence on the part of the Respondent. The point was
reinforced in Jackson & Powell ([24] supra), where it was stated at para
15-032 (albeit without any authority being cited) that “[a] financial
practitioner will generally owe a duty of care in tort to his client quite
apart from any contract that exists between them” [emphasis added].

[emphasis in original]

93 In my view, Go Dante Yap can be sufficiently analogised to the present
case. In Go Dante Yap, the court ruled (at [24], citing Lister v Romford Ice
and Cold Storage Co Ltd [1957] AC 555 (“Lister”) at 572–573) that “in
contracts under which a skilled or professional person agrees to render
certain services to his client in return for a specified or reasonable fee,
there is at common law an implied term in law that he will exercise reasonable
skill and care in rendering those services”. The court further noted that “it
is trite law that a bank in carrying out the instructions of its customer is
under an implied contractual duty to exercise skill and care”. This implied
contractual duty to exercise skill and care therefore meant that, as the court
reasoned (at [34]), there was an assumption of responsibility by the
respondent to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the
appellant.

94 In the present case, I would take the view that there was an implied term
in the contract that Mr Chin would exercise reasonable skill and care in
rendering services to Writers Studio. In Lister, the court reasoned (at
572–573) that it was an implied term of the contract that the appellant would
perform his duties with the proper care because:

The proposition of law stated by Willes J in Harmer v Cornelius has never been
questioned: “When a skilled labourer,” he said, “artizan, or artist is
employed, there is on his part an “implied warranty that he is of skill
reasonably competent to “the task he undertakes, —Spondes peritiam artis.
Thus, if an “apothecary, a watch-maker, or an attorney be employed for
“reward, they each impliedly undertake to possess and exercise “reasonable
skill in their several arts. … An express promise “or express representation
in the particular case is not necessary.” I see no ground for excluding from,
and every ground for including in, this category a servant who is employed to
drive a lorry which, driven without care, may become an engine of destruction
and involve his master in very grave liability. Nor can I see any valid reason
for saying that a distinction is to be made between possessing skill and
exercising it. No such distinction is made in the cited case: on the contrary,
“possess” and “exercise” are there conjoined. Of what advantage to the
employer is his servant’s undertaking that he possesses skill unless he
undertakes also to use it? I have spoken of using skill rather than using
care, for “skill” is the word used in the cited case, but this embraces care.
For even in so-called unskilled operations an exercise of care is necessary to
the proper performance of duty.

[emphasis added]

95 It was therefore apparent to me, from the passage above, that the court in
Lister had found that there was an implied contractual term of a skilled
person to exercise reasonable skill and care in the context of an employer-
employee relationship. Where employees are concerned, it is trite law that
there is an implied term “in the employer’s favour that the employee will
serve the employer with good faith and fidelity, and that he or she (the
employee) will also use reasonable skill and care in the performance of his or
her duties pursuant to the employment contract: Man Financial at [193]. In the
present case, while I have found that Writers Studio had engaged Mr Chin qua
independent contractor, I am of the view that such a term should also be
implied in law where independent contractors are concerned. Terms implied by
law reflect considerations of fairness and policy (Chua Choon Cheng and ors v
Allgreen Properties Ltd and another appeal [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 at [68]). To
hold that there is no such term of reasonable skill and care implied in law
where the tutor is hired qua independent contractor would be to draw a fine
and unsustainable distinction. In my view, where a tutor is hired by a tuition
centre to teach young children, there must be an implied term of reasonable
skill and care in the contract between the tutor and the tuition centre
regardless of the nature of the tutor’s engagement.

96 I would also observe that the role in which Mr Chin was engaged by Writers
Studio was akin to that of a professional providing services to a client such
that a term of reasonable skill and care should be implied. While structured
as a business arrangement (see [67] above), the reality was that Mr Chin was
hired as a tutor who specialised in teaching English, Mathematics and Science,
to teach classes.

97 In any event, even if I was wrong, and there was no implied contractual
term at law to exercise reasonable skill and care on the part of Mr Chin, I am
of the view that he had voluntarily assumed responsibility on his part, and
that Writers Studio had placed reliance on his expertise. In Go Dante Yap, the
respondent bank had held itself out as possessing special skill or expertise
to manage investments and transact in emerging market securities, or to search
for and recommend such investments. The respondent had, in accepting the
appellant as someone whose money and assets were under its control and on
whose behalf it could and was expected to expend considerable sums in order to
acquire various investments, voluntarily assumed responsibility. Further, the
appellant had placed implicit reliance upon that expertise by giving the
respondent the authority to enter into investments on his behalf. It was on
this basis which the Court of Appeal concluded that there was “sufficient
proximity between the parties to give rise to a prima facie duty of care”: Go
Dante Yap at [35]. The facts in that case allowed the Court of Appeal to find
that there was both an implied contractual term to exercise reasonable skill
and care, as well as legal proximity between the parties.

98 In the present case, I would similarly hold that Mr Chin had voluntarily
assumed responsibility in the relevant sense by accepting the appointment from
Writers Studio to teach its students. Similarly, Writers Studio had placed
reliance on Mr Chin’s expertise – they had placed their students under his
tutelage and let him run his classes as he saw fit.

99 For the reasons above, I therefore find that there was sufficient legal
proximity to found a prima facie duty of care in the present case. I turn now
to consider the second stage of the Spandeck test. Here, the court considers
whether any policy considerations which are applicable to the factual matrix
negate that prima facie duty of care, and must be careful to differentiate
“such considerations from the requirement of proximity in the first stage” of
the Spandeck framework: Spandeck at [83] and [85]. The rationale for this, as
explained by the Court of Appeal in See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement
(Pte) Ltd and others [2013] 3 SLR 284 at [89]–[90], was that the raison d’être
of the tort of negligence is to render interpersonal justice – cogent policy
considerations must therefore be adduced to “displace the prima facie”
position that interpersonal wrongs should be remedied.

100 In essence, what this means is that while the law of tort deals with
interpersonal wrongs, in certain situations, policy reasons may militate
against the imposition of a duty of care, and that these interpersonal wrongs
be dealt with by other means. For example, the availability of alternative
statutory remedies and processes is a policy reason militating against the
imposition of a duty of care (The Law of Torts in Singapore at
[05.077]–[05.078]). The reason for this is that the plaintiff can seek relief
for interpersonal wrongs through statutory remedies and processes. Another
example of a policy reason militating against the imposition of a duty of care
would be the existence of a contractual relationship. In Spandeck (at
[111]–[113]), the court ruled that even if there was proximity between the
parties, the policy reason weighing against imposing a duty of care was the
existence of a contract which clearly defined the rights between parties.

101 In the present case, while there was a contractual relationship between
Writers Studio and Mr Chin, I did not think that this negated the imposition
of the prima facie duty of care. The situation here was quite different from
that in Spandeck. The court in that case took the view that “a duty of care
should not be superimposed on a contractual framework” (Spandeck at [114]).
The reason for this, however, was because the appellant had freely entered
into the contract which provided that claims against the Government had to be
brought in arbitration. The court therefore held that because parties sought
to regulate their relationship via contract which stipulated that in the event
of under-certification, that would be dealt with through arbitration, there
should not be imposed on the respondent a duty which the appellant had chosen
not to make a contractual one: Spandeck at [96], [101] and [114].

102 In the present case, while Mr Chin was engaged by Writers Studio pursuant
to a contract, it is evident that parties had not clearly sought to define the
boundaries of their contractual relationship. The contract was silent as to
what was expected of Mr Chin when it came to the delivery of his lessons and
his conduct as a tutor. For this reason, I find that the existence of a
contractual relationship between the parties did not negate the imposition of
a prima facie duty of care. Unlike Spandeck, where parties had clearly
regulated and defined the boundaries of their contractual relationship to
exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care (see Animal Concerns at
[71]), parties here had not done so.

103 I would further hold that there were also policy reasons leaning in favour
of the imposition of a duty of care (Animal Concerns at [86]). It is important
that tutors engaged to teach young children are not only held accountable to
the students whom they teach, but also the tuition agencies who have hired
them to conduct the classes.

104 For the reasons above, I find that Mr Chin owed Writers Studio a duty of
care.

Breach of a Duty Owed

105 While I have found that Mr Chin owed a duty of care to Writers Studio, I
do not find that Mr Chin had breached that duty of care owed. The standard of
care is the objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and
skill. As stated in Blyth v The Company of Proprietors of The Birmingham
Waterworks (1856) 11 Exch 781 at 784:

Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon
those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs,
would do; or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.

106 The reasonable person’s conduct, in turn, depends on certain factors which
are relevant to the particular circumstances of the particular case such as
the likelihood and risks of harm, the extent of harm, costs of avoiding harm,
and the industry standards and common practice (Management Corporation Strata
Title Plan No 2668 v Rott George Hugo [2013] 3 SLR 787 at [27].

The parties’ submissions

107 Writers Studio argued that Mr Chin breached such a duty of care by virtue
of his Conduct on 16 September 2021 and by his Inappropriate Behaviour. This,
in turn, caused them to suffer financial losses because students withdrew, and
they were drawn into a criminal investigation arising out of Mr Chin’s
Inappropriate Behaviour. As a consequence, Writers Studio’s reputation and
standing as a tuition centre suffered. 116

108 Mr Chin, however, in his submissions, does not directly deal with the

As such, according to Mr Chin, it can only be shown that he had only told the
students that he was not being paid, and as a result of which (together with
his “mental state at the time”), he wanted to end the classes slightly
earlier. Mr Chin submits that it was Writers Studio’s “unprofessional and poor
treatment” that caused him to “act out” on 16 September 2020. 120

Analysis and findings

109 I am, however not persuaded that Writers Studio had proved that Mr Chin
breached such a duty of care. Regardless of Mr Chin’s admission at trial, the
determination for any breach is ultimately to be made by this Court. I
consider each of the alleged complaints in turn.

110 In relation to Mr Chin’s alleged Inappropriate Behaviour (see [34] above),
Writers Studio seeks to rely on what his former students were recorded to have
said. While the recording and Mr Ting’s testimony supports the finding that Mr
Chin’s former students had made those statements, neither the recording nor Mr
Ting’s testimony could support a finding as to the truth of those statements.
In my judgment, such evidence is a classic form of hearsay evidence which is
inadmissible unless one of the limbs under s 32 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97,
1997 Rev Ed) can be invoked. For example, in Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings
Business Ltd and others and another appeal [2015] 2 SLR 686 (‘Gimpex’), the
Court of Appeal held (at [84]) that a report, the admissibility of which was
disputed, was hearsay evidence. The defendants in that case sought to have the
report admitted on the basis that one Nonot, who was allegedly the maker of
the report, had testified at trial (Gimpex at [80]). The court, however, took
the view that the report was hearsay evidence as it was factually unclear
whether Nonot had signed the report. Moreover, even if Nonot was the maker of
the report, he had not been personally involved in the entire process of
sampling, testing and loading the coal. He hence could not testify as to
whether the statements in the report about the quality of the coal were true
as he had no first-hand knowledge of the facts (Gimpex at [83]–[84]). In a
similar vein, Mr Ting here was, by his own admission, not the one who
conducted the recording and did not know if any prior discussions had not been
captured by the recording. 121

##### Foot Note 121

He also had no first-hand knowledge of the facts contained in the recording,
and thus could not have testified as to the truth of those facts. The
recording is hence hearsay evidence. I also do not see how any of the limbs in
s 32(1) of the Evidence Act apply such that the recording may be admitted into
evidence.

111 Even if I am wrong on this, I did not think that this recording, even if
admitted, could have been given any weight. In Gimpex, the report had been
found to be admissible under s 32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act but the court
then exercised its discretion to exclude the report in the interests of
justice under s 32(2) of the Evidence Act, as the report was not shown to have
a minimal degree of reliability (at [120]). Similarly, while Mr Ting claims
that he had conducted the recorded discussion in an “appropriate” manner, 122

##### Foot Note 122

he responds to the children’s allegations in recording with lines such as “why
he like [sic] your nipple so much” and “then ask him go back and squeeze the
wife lah.” 123

Counsel for Mr Chin has also highlighted that Mr Ting also made references to
sexual remarks allegedly made by Mr Chin, before the same remarks were raised
by the children in the recording. 124

##### Foot Note 124

Owing to the manner in which the recorded discussion had been conducted, its
reliability as a record of the children’s recollection of Mr Chin’s
Inappropriate Behaviour towards them is hence highly suspect.

112 I would further note that the reports filed with the Singapore Police
Force, which were alluded to by Writers Studio, are also not before me. Even
if they were, they do not necessarily prove the truth of the statements
alleged.

113 As to Mr Chin’s Conduct on 16 September 2020 (see [30] above), I did not
think that he had breached any duty of care owed to Writers Studio. In
determining whether Mr Chin had acted below the objective standard of a
reasonable person using ordinary care and skill, the Conduct must be
understood in its proper context. In particular, the undisputed fact that
Writers Studio paid Mr Chin late on multiple occasions up to 16 September 2020
is relevant and cannot be ignored. 125

##### Foot Note 125

Transcript dated 2 November 2021 at p 86, lines 20–31.

Stated thus, as of 16 September 2020, Writers Studio was in a continued breach
of its contractual obligation to pay Mr Chin. In view of Writers Studio’s
continuing breach, it is not unreasonable for Mr Chin feel frustrated to the
point that he dismissed his 3.00pm class early and cancelled the later 5.00pm
and 7.00pm classes. Bearing this in mind, and taking into account the fact
that his students saw him packing up and ending class early, and those
students asking him what had happened, it can hardly be said that it was
unreasonable of Mr Chin to have explained to his students that he was
“quitting” because he was not being paid. It cannot – in these circumstances –
be for Writers Studio to push Mr Chin over the edge by its own conduct and
then turn around to claim that he had breached his duty of care.

114 In my judgment, it would be a travesty of justice if Mr Chin, being made
to work without his remuneration under financial pressures, cracks under such
pressure by his Conduct and be held liable in negligence.

115 For the same foregoing reasons, even if Writers Studio could show that
there is an implied term of a duty of fidelity and good faith (see Issue 2
above), I would have held that there would not have been a breach of the same.

Issue 4: whether Mr Chin caused loss by breaching the NDA and/or duty of
confidentiality

I summarise the parties’ submissions on each issue and consider them in turn.

117 As against that mentioned at [20] above, what is in dispute is whether Mr
Chin was given the latitude to contact Writers Studio’s Clients using either
his 4599 Number and his 9693 Number and the conditions under which he could do
so. Writers Studio submits that Ms Oh “had to be added into a WhatsApp group
chat with the Client and/or be made aware of the communications”. 130

However, on 12 September 2020, Writers Studio discovered that (a) its Clients

“and/or” his 9693 Number; and (b) Mr Chin contacted its Clients through social
media platforms. 131

118 Mr Chin’s position is that Writers Studio has been “inconsistent” on

The matter was resolved by Mr Chin’s Undertaking. However, Writers Studio now
argues that Mr Chin had breached the Undertaking by his continued teaching of
[B] (see [33] above). In that regard, if [B] is a “7th student outside of the
scope of the [U]ndertaking”, then Mr Chin should have informed Senior Judge
Andrew Ang. 135

Mr Chin denies the allegation of breach as [B] has been Mr Chin’s “private
student since 2018 for Math”. It was Mr Chin who had introduced [B] to join
Writers Studio for group tuition. As such, after Mr Chin’s resignation, [B]’s
parent requested Mr Chin to continue teaching [B]. 136

120 On the second matter (ie, the teaching materials), Writers Studio raises
two arguments in support of its claim for breach of the NDA and/or duty of
confidentiality. First, Ms Oh was informed by Ms Phu on 12 September 2020 that
Mr Chin instructed her to remove the “header” of the teaching materials which
included Writers Studio’s or Innova Studio’s logo. As against Mr Chin’s
position that he had requested for the header to be removed for formatting
issues (and not the logo), Writers Studio submits that Mr Chin “did not
clarify” that or “correct” Writers Studio when the issue was raised. 137

Analysis and findings

122 I dismiss Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin for breach of the NDA
and/or duty of confidentiality. I am not persuaded that Writers Studio has
proved its case on a balance of probabilities.

The law on confidentiality

123 In I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others [2020] 1 SLR
1130 (“I-Admin”) at [64], the Court of Appeal noted that the breach of an NDA
and the breach of an equitable obligation of confidentiality are distinct
causes of action. Writers Studio, however, has not drawn a distinction between
either in their written submissions, despite having claimed damages for Mr
Chin’s breach of the NDA and/or the duty of confidentiality. Given the
differences between the breach of an NDA, and the breach of the duty of
confidentiality, it is important that such a distinction be drawn. For one, an
action for the breach of an NDA is rooted in contract – here, the terms of the
NDA must be interpreted to determine whether there has been a breach.

124 The duty of confidentiality, however, is an equitable obligation. The
traditional approach to an action for breach of confidence, laid down in Coco
v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 (“Coco”) (see also X Pte Ltd v CDE
[1992] 2 SLR(R) 575) requires that the plaintiff establish the following
elements:

(a) That the information in question has the necessary quality of confidence
about it.

(b) The information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an
obligation of confidence.

(c) There must be an unauthorised use of the information, and in appropriate
cases, this use must be to the detriment of the party who originally
communicated it.

125 This obligation of confidence may arise by way of a contractual
relationship – this usually occurs in cases such as the present one where
there was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant which contained
express or implied terms which prohibit the defendant from using or disclosing
the confidential information (see Total English Learning Global Pte Ltd and
another v Kids Counsel Pte Ltd and another suit [2014] SGHC 258 at [82];
Invenpro (M) Sdn Bhd v JCS Automation Pte Ltd and another [2014] 2 SLR 1045 at
[155]–[158]). It is this obligation of confidence which is the “raison d’etre
of the law of confidence – the defendant must honour, or be made to honour,
this obligation of confidence”: Ng-Loy Wee Loon, Law of Intellectual Property
of Singapore at [40.1.1] – [40.1.4] (“Law of Intellectual Property of
Singapore”). In this regard, it is perhaps useful to canvass the fresh
developments as to how the Singapore courts have exercised their equitable
jurisdiction.

126 The first decision of interest is that in LVM Law Chambers LLC v Wan Hoe
Keet and another and another matter [2020] 1 SLR 1083 (“LVM Law Chambers”).
There, the respondents had applied for an injunction to restrain the appellant
law firm from acting in suit no 806 of 2018 (“Suit 806”), which was a
proceeding commenced against them for their alleged roles in a Ponzi scheme.
Prior to the commencement of Suit 806, the appellant had acted for the
plaintiff in suit no 315 of 2016 (“Suit 315”), which involved similar
proceedings brought against the respondent. Suit 315 was resolved on the first
day of trial – the settlement agreement, which the appellant was not expressly
made party to, contained a confidentiality clause. The respondents contended
that the appellant owed them an obligation of confidentiality by virtue of
having participated in the settlement negotiations in Suit 315, and that there
was a real risk that it would misuse or disclose confidential information if
the injunction was not granted. At first instance, the injunction was granted,
and the appellant law firm appealed against that decision.

127 The primary issue on appeal concerned the applicable legal principles in
deciding whether a lawyer or law firm should be restrained from acting for a
plaintiff against the same counterparty in a previous set of proceedings
resolved by means of a settlement or mediation (LVM Law Chambers at [12(a)]).
In this regard, the Court of Appeal noted (LVM Law Chambers at [13]–[15]):

[13] It is clear that if the lawyer has contractually agreed to be bound by a
duty of confidentiality, then that agreement will operate accordingly and
whether or not he can act for a subsequent party against the same counterparty
in a previous set of proceedings will depend on the precise scope of the duty
embodied in the contract itself. However, this was not the situation in this
appeal as the Appellant never entered into such an agreement, although one did
exist between the parties to the previous proceedings (see [5] above). Indeed,
this particular point distinguishes this case from that of the New Zealand
Court of Appeal in Carter Holt Harvey Forests Ltd v Sunnex Logging Ltd [2001]
3 NZLR 343 (“Carter Holt”), where the lawyers in question had signed
confidentiality agreements in their personal capacity prior to taking part in
the mediation. We also note that in this last-mentioned case, the
confidentiality agreements which the lawyers signed were “sufficiently wide to
encompass everything which occurred as part of the mediation process” (see
Carter Holt at [23]).

14 However, even if (as is the situation in this appeal) the lawyer concerned
has not entered into a contractual agreement of confidentiality, that is not
necessarily an end to the matter. In limited circumstances, an equitable duty
of confidence may be imposed by the court, such that it may be inappropriate
for the lawyer (or law firm) concerned to act for a party against the same
counterparty in a previous set of proceedings. What, then, might these
circumstances be?

15 In our view, a good starting point would be the test for breach of
confidence laid down by Megarry J in the seminal English High Court decision
in Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 (which has been cited and
applied by the Singapore courts (see, eg, the decision of this court in ANB v
ANC and another and another matter [2015] 5 SLR 522 at [17])) – albeit
modified slightly having regard to the nature of the precise issue before this
court and the relevant case law which will be considered briefly below. In
this connection, we also gratefully draw (in part) from the learned judgment
of Gummow J in the Australian Federal Court decision of Smith Kline & French
Laboratories (Aust) Limited v Secretary, Department of Community Services and
Health (1990) 22 FCR 73 (at 87). Put simply, the counterparty in the previous
set of proceedings must establish that:

(a) the information concerned must have the necessary quality of confidence
about it;

(b) that information must have been received by the lawyer (or law firm)
concerned in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and

(c) there is a real and sensible possibility of the information being misused.

[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]

128 Just three days later, the Court of Appeal handed down the judgment in
I-Admin, where the court observed that the equity-based action for breach of
confidence protected two interests:

(a) Wrongful gain interest: where the defendant has made unauthorised use or
disclosure of confidential information and thereby gained a benefit; and

(b) Wrongful loss interest: where the plaintiff is seeking protection for the
confidentiality of the information per se, which is loss suffered so long as a
defendant’s conscience has been impacted in the breach of the obligation of
confidentiality.

129 The court in I-Admin further laid down, what has been termed the “modified
approach” (I-Admin at [61]). Under the “modified approach”, if the relevant
information had the necessary quality of confidence about it and if it was
imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence, an action for
the breach of confidence would be presumed. This presumption could be rebutted
if the defendant could adduce proof that his/her conscience was not affected
in the circumstances in which the plaintiff’s wrongful loss interest had been
harmed or undermined.

130 If there was any doubt as to the scope of the decision in I-Admin, and the
extent to which it had changed the law on breach of confidence, that was
subsequently clarified by the Court of Appeal in Lim Oon Kuin and others v
Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal [2022] SGCA 29. There, the Court
of Appeal stated that the decision in I-Admin did not set out to turn the law
on breach of confidence on its head by replacing the traditional Coco approach
in its entirety (Lim Oon Kuin at [39]). The I-Admin approach was intended to
specifically fill the lacuna in the law in so far as the legitimate objective
of protecting the wrongful loss interest was concerned. Here, a legal burden
was imposed on the defendant to show that his/her conscience was not affected
– an evidential burden would be simply insufficient to protect the plaintiff’s
interest in the confidential information.

131 The court in Lim Oon Kuin further cited, with approval (at [41]), the
following passages from the Law of Intellectual Property (at
[41.3.10]–[41.3.11]):

It is also likely that the Court of Appeal intended to further limit the
application of the ‘modified approach’ to cases involving unauthorised
acquisition of the confidential information, that is, the ‘taker’ cases. This
conjecture is based on the fact that the court placed a fair amount of
emphasis on the defendants’ acquisition (via [the former employees]) of the
confidential information without the plaintiff’s knowledge, and more
generally, how technology had made it much easier for a person to access and
download confidential information without consent.

There is another reason for this conjecture. Three days before the issuance of
the judgment in I-Admin, the Court of Appeal issued a judgment in LVM Law
Chambers LLC v Wan Hoe Keet, where breach of confidence was raised as a cause
of action. The defendant in this case was not a ‘taker’ of confidential
information. The defendant was a lawyer who had acted for a party in a dispute
against the plaintiffs arising out of a Ponzi scheme. After negotiations
conducted by the parties’ solicitors, this dispute was eventually settled.
When the defendant was engaged to act for another party ABC in a suit against
the plaintiffs in relation to the same Ponzi scheme, the plaintiffs sought an
injunction to prevent the defendant from acting for ABC in this second suit.
The plaintiffs claimed that there was confidential information arising out of
the circumstances surrounding the settlement of the first dispute, and that
the defendant being privy to this confidential information was bound by an
equitable obligation of confidence. On the third element (misuse of the
confidential information), the Court of Appeal held that this element would be
satisfied if there was a ‘serious and reasonable possibility’ of misuse of the
confidential information by the defendant. Significantly, the appellate court
placed the burden of proving the existence of such possibility of misuse
squarely on the plaintiffs. In this case, the plaintiffs failed to discharge
this burden and, accordingly, the Court of Appeal refused to grant the
injunction sought by the plaintiffs.

[emphasis in original]

132 Therefore, if one looks at the decision in Lim Oon Kuin, and the court’s
discussion of its previous decisions, it would appear that there are at least
two broad approaches to the law of confidence in Singapore. Here, the
“modified approach” would apply to what Prof Ng-Loy terms “taker” cases –
these are cases where the defendant has acquired the plaintiff’s confidential
information without their knowledge. In such cases, it was the “wrongful loss”
interest that would be at stake. Because the traditional approach to the law
of confidence imposed a requirement of unauthorised use and detriment, the
wrongful gain interest had been overemphasised at the expense of the wrongful
loss interest: I-Admin at [58]. This necessitated the “modified approach” and
the shifting of the legal burden onto the defendant to prove that their
conscience was unaffected – this serves to protect the plaintiff’s right to
preserve the confidentiality of its information, which was the substance of
the wrongful loss interest: Lim Oon Kuin at [38].

133 The traditional approach in Coco, however, would continue to apply in
cases where the “wrongful gain” interest was at stake: Lim Oon Kuin at [39]
and [41]. Here, the Writers Studio would bear the burden of proof in showing
that there had been an unauthorised use of the information, to Writers
Studio’s detriment.

134 Writers Studio, however, did not appear to be aware of the development in
I-Admin despite the fact that the present claim was commenced after the Court
of Appeal had handed down its decision in that case. This was evident from the
manner in which Writers Studio had framed their pleadings which were based on
the requirements set forth in Coco. Subsequent amendments made to the
statement of claim in September 2021 also did not affect Writers Studio’s
pleadings on the confidentiality point insofar as the equitable obligation of
confidence was concerned. Writers Studio, therefore, appeared to have
proceeded on the basis that the law was as it stood prior to I-Admin (ie, the
traditional approach under Coco).

135 This, to my mind, means that it is now not open to Writers Studio to rely
on the “modified approach” in I-Admin and assert that Mr Chin bears the legal
burden of proof of showing that his confidence was not affected. While there
may have been some uncertainty as to whether the burden imposed on Mr Chin in
the “modified approach” was an evidential or legal one (see Saw Cheng Lim,
Chan Zheng Wen Samuel and Chai Wen Min, “Revisiting the Law of Confidence in
Singapore and a Proposal for a New Tort of Misuse of Private Information”
(2020) 32 Singapore Academy of Law Journal 891 at [22]), it was always open to
Writers Studio to have pleaded the point. After all, pleadings are meant to
give the other party notice of one’s case. Writers Studio, having not pleaded
whether it was the wrongful loss or wrongful gain interest that was at stake,
must now let the chips lie where they have fallen. I would add that in future
cases, now that Lim Oon Kuin has provided clarity on the “modified approach”
in I-Admin, counsel should take care to plead with specificity, whether they
are proceeding on the basis of the “wrongful loss” or “wrongful gain”
interest.

136 In any event, I would further hold that the wrongful loss interest was not
engaged in the present case. That interest is only engaged in cases where the
defendant has ‘taken’ the confidential information – for instance, in I-Admin
itself, the appellant’s source code was copied by the first and second
respondents, who were former employees which later left to set up their own
rival company (the third respondent). The present case is quite different.
Unlike the situation in I-Admin, where the respondent had acquired the
confidential information without the appellant’s knowledge or consent,
whatever confidential information Mr Chin possessed was passed to him by
Writers Studio.

137 I therefore proceed on the basis that it was the wrongful gain interest
that was at stake in the present case, and the traditional formulation in Coco
applied. As I explain below, the Writers Studio’s claims for breach of the NDA
and the duty of confidentiality fail because they have been unable to prove
their case on a balance of probabilities.

The Confidential Information

138 As regards Mr Chin’s private contacting of Writers Studio’s Clients, I
make one preliminary observation. Writers Studio seems to be itself unclear as
to the condition upon which Mr Chin could do so. For example, the
contemporaneous evidence upon which Writers Studio relies shows that Ms Oh
acceded to Mr Chin’s request on the condition that the “liaising is uniform
and done in a group with me”. Ms Oh also explained that group chats are
“safer” and expressed her concern of legal suits against Writers Studio. 140

Nevertheless, Writers Studio’s case is that Mr Chin could contact its Clients
privately if Ms Oh was “made aware of the communications”. If so, then it is
for Writers Studio to show that Mr Chin communicated with its Clients without
Ms Oh being made aware of any such communications.

139 More pertinently, Writers Studio did not even cite the evidence upon which
it seeks to rely in support of its alleged discovery of Mr Chin’s breaches on
12 September 2020 (see [117] above) in either the body of its submissions or
in the footnotes. That particular part of its submissions appears to me a mere
repetition of its pleadings. 142

SDB at pp 28–29 (Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) at para 16).

Quite apart from the allegation of Writers Studio’s discovery of the alleged
breach, Writers Studio also did not point me to the specific evidence which
proves its allegation that Mr Chin “encouraged” Writers Studio’s Clients to
“contact him privately” in breach of the NDA – whether through the 4599
Number, the 9693 Number or social media platforms. I am satisfied that the
Clients could have received Mr Chin’s number by another way – that is, by Ms
Oh adding the 9693 Number to group chats on her own initiative 143

and the publication of the 4599 Number on Writers Studio’s brochures. 144

140 In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that Writers Studio has proved
the alleged breaches of the NDA and/or duty of confidentiality by Mr Chin. I
thus need not consider whether the Confidential Information had lost its
quality as confidential when Clients had reached out to Mr Chin and
“voluntarily disclosed and made available their contact details” to him. Even
if Mr Chin did contact Writers Studio’s Clients privately without making the
same known to Ms Oh, Writers Studio has not demonstrated the loss or detriment
suffered as a result of such private communication.

141 As to the continued teaching of [B], I am likewise of the view that
Writers Studio did not prove that Mr Chin gave an undertaking not to continue
teaching [B] in particular. Indeed, taking its case at its very highest,
Writers Studio merely argued that Mr Chin should have expressly indicated the
teaching of [B] to be excluded from the Undertaking. With respect, I cannot
agree with Writers Studio’s submission. The Undertaking expressly excludes Mr
Chin’s “students whom he taught before he joined” Writers Studio. 145

I am thus unable to agree that it is then for Mr Chin to expressly name [B] to
be excluded from the Undertaking. On the evidence before me, I find that Mr
Chin had taught [B] prior to [B] even joining Writers Studio and Mr Chin did
not thereby breach the Undertaking. 146

The teaching materials

142 I begin by addressing the teaching materials which Mr Chin allegedly
failed to return. On 21 and 22 September 2022, Mr Chin did return some
teaching materials. The only issue is whether Mr Chin failed to return all of
the teaching materials in his possession during that handover. In my judgment,
Writers Studio failed to prove its case that Mr Chin had indeed failed to do
so. I agree with Mr Chin’s position that it is for Writers Studio to
particularise and show precisely what documents Mr Chin had failed to return
which he had in his possession. It is not enough to simply list generic types
of documents such as “worksheets”, “holiday programme materials” and “trial
lesson materials” (see [31] above) as they do not indicate the documents which
Mr Chin has yet to return (see Risk-X Sdn Bhd v Capital Market Risk Advisor
Sdn Bhd & Ors [2017] 8 MLJ 475 at [40]–[43]).

143 For completeness, I note that Mr Chin submits that not all of the teaching
materials are confidential as it copies questions from common assessment books
available for sale to the public. 147

Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 25.

Given my findings, there is no need for me to determine whether the teaching
materials are confidential for the reason that Mr Chin raises. That is because
even if all of the teaching materials are confidential, I find that Writers
Studio fails to prove its case on a balance of probabilities.

144 In respect of Mr Chin’s alleged request to remove the headers of certain
teaching materials, I find two difficulties with Writers Studio’s case. First,
Writers Studio does not dispute that there might have been a misunderstanding
between parties as to what header Mr Chin sought to remove. Writers Studio
only emphasises that Mr Chin failed to raise such misunderstanding
contemporaneously. However, I find that Mr Chin had sufficiently explained
that he was unable to clear the misunderstanding as he was “kicked out” of the
WhatsApp group chat shortly after the issue was brought to his attention. 148

Mr Chin also did not wish to clarify with Ms Oh separately thereafter because
she was unavailable and he did not want to “pester” her about it. 149

I accept Mr Chin’s consistent testimony that he had sought to remove the
worksheet header for formatting issues and not specifically Writers Studio’s
logo. 150

Ms Oh’s testimony as to what Ms Phu had informed her was Mr Chin’s intention
(ie, removal of Writers Studio’s or Innova Studio’s logo) is insufficient to
found Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin in this regard.

145 The second – and insurmountable – difficulty is that Writers Studio fails
to establish any loss and/or detriment suffered. Taking Writers Studio’s
position at its highest and even if it could prove that Mr Chin asked Ms Phu
to remove its logo, it is unclear to me how such a request could have caused
Writers Studio to suffer loss and/or detriment. Even though this is a
bifurcated trial and Writers Studio need not tender evidence on the quantum of
losses suffered, it must – for the purposes of liability – nevertheless
demonstrate that it did suffer loss or detriment.

146 I am thus not persuaded that Writers Studio proved its case on a balance
of probabilities in this regard.

Conclusion

147 The present dispute should have been fairly straightforward. But the
manner in which parties pleaded their cases and framed their submissions
resulted in this case being both longer and more complicated than it should
have been. The haphazard manner in which parties pleaded their cases
obfuscated the true issues at the core of Writers Studio’s claim against Mr
Chin. It was only at the trial that counsel for Writers Studio indicated that
it would like this Court to make a finding as to whether Mr Chin was an
employee of Writers Studio so as to assist with the CPF Board investigations
(even though this was not strictly necessary to determine Writers Studio’s
claim against Mr Chin). Time was also wasted at the trial when counsel spent
time pursuing lines of inquiry that were immaterial to the determination of
the present dispute.

148 Having regard to the parties’ arguments and the evidence before me, I
dismiss Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin for the reasons above. I shall
hear the parties on costs.
