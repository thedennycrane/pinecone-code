_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_**

The Charge

**_

The appellant was charged that he, together with nine others, on or about 2
September 2001, at about 4.00 am at barbecue pit ‘O’, Pasir Ris Park, were
members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to the
following four persons:

> > Syaiful Ridhuan Bin Wahid (‘Syaiful’), 17 year old male,

> > Mohamed Ridzuan Bin Abdul Talib (‘Ridzuan’), 16 year old male,
>>

>> Toh Sunny Bin Faud (‘Sunny’), 17 year old male and

>>

>> Muhammad Nursamfauzie Bin Samat (‘Fauzie’), 16 year old male

,

and in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, violence was used
and he had thereby committed the offence of rioting under s 146 of the Penal
Code, Cap 224, ("PC"). Under s 147, the offender shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and shall also be
liable to caning.

2 The appellant was jointly tried with the following persons who were within
the same unlawful assembly, namely, Mohamed Noor Bin Abdul Rahman (‘Mohd
Noor’), Zulkeplee Bin Abdullah (‘Zulkeplee’), Mohd Hardian Bin Mohd Yassin
(‘Mohd Hardian’). At the end of the trial, the appellant was convicted and
sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The
appellant appealed only against conviction and not against sentence.

3 I heard his appeal on 13 August 2002 and dismissed it. I now give my
reasons.

_**

Background facts

**

(a) The birthday party and the fight

_

4 On 1 September 2001, Siti Noraini Bte Abdul Jalil invited several of her
friends, including the four victims in the present case, to her birthday party
at barbecue pit ‘N’, Pasir Ris Park. A lamppost illuminated each barbecue pit.

5 The four victims arrived at the above-mentioned pit at about 9.00 pm. At
about 11.00 pm, they proceeded to a neighbouring pit, pit ‘O’, to play cards.
Pit ‘N’ and pit ‘O’ are about ten metres apart.

6 At about 3.00 am, while playing cards at pit ‘O’, the victims noticed a
group of about 15-20 male Malays walking briskly towards them. Ridzuan gave
evidence that the appellant was part of the group and that he was holding a
belt in his hand. As the group approached, Sunny stood up to ascertain what
they wanted. According to the prosecution witnesses, Mohd Noor confronted
Sunny and asked him which secret society he belonged to. Sunny denied any such
involvement rudely after Mohd Noor asked him the same question repeatedly.
Thereupon, Mohd Noor threw a bottle to the ground smashing it. Mohd Hardian
then rushed forward and punched Sunny on the left jaw. Mohd Noor pushed Sunny
and Zulkeplee punched Sunny on the forehead.

7 A fight broke out and the remaining members of the group attacked the four
victims by punching and kicking them. During his examination-in-chief, Ridzuan
testified that the appellant had hit him on the back and on the chest with a
leather belt.

_

(b) The arrest

_

8 The victims eventually managed to break away from their assailants and
called the police. At about 4.12 am, Sergeant Mazli, of Bedok Police Division,
arrived at the scene. Sergeant Mazli questioned the victims and upon being
informed that the assailants were wearing dark clothes and had fled in a blue
lorry, informed his Operations Room of what he had learned and instructions
were issued to look out for a group of Malay persons in a blue lorry.

9 At about 5.00 am, a blue lorry was spotted at Pasir Ris Drive 6, in front of
Block 442. There were 15 male and 5 female persons inside the lorry. Corporal
Patrick Lim stopped the lorry and detained the group. The appellant was among
those detained.

10 Sergeant Mazli, upon being informed of the detention, drove the four
victims to the lorry and told them to identify members of the group who
assaulted them. During the identification process, the victims remained in the
police car. Both Sunny and Ridzuan identified Mohd Noor. Syaiful pointed out
Mohd Noor and Mohd Hardian. According to Ridzuan, he did not identify the
appellant then because he could not see the appellant’s face clearly from the
police car.

_

(c) The medical examination

_

11 At about 5.59 am the same morning, the victims were medically examined by
Dr Wang Shi Tah (‘Dr Wang’) at the Changi General Hospital. Ridzuan, upon
cross-examination, insisted that he did tell Dr Wang that someone had
assaulted him with a belt. However, Dr Wang’s medical report on Ridzuan
indicated that "no weapons were used".

_

(d) The identification parade

_

12 Later on the same day between 1.00 pm and 1.30 pm at Bedok Police Station,
an identification parade of 15 male Malays was conducted for the four victims.
It was not disputed that the identification parade was properly conducted.
During the parade, all four victims identified Mohd Noor. Sunny also
identified both Zulkeplee and Mohd Hardian. Only Ridzuan identified the
appellant. The victims were not specifically asked what roles the identified
persons had played in the group.

_**

The prosecution’s case

**_

13 The prosecution’s case relied entirely on Ridzuan’s identification of the
appellant. None of the other prosecution witnesses identified the appellant as
part of the group. Ridzuan testified as follows:

> (i) The appellant was part of the group that approached the victims and was
> holding a belt in his hand.
>
> (ii) Further, the appellant remained in the group when Mohd Noor confronted
> Sunny and when Mohd Hardian punched Sunny on the jaw.
>
> (iii) Once the fight began, the appellant hit Ridzuan first on the back, and
> then on the chest, with his belt.

14 Based on Ridzuan’s testimony, the prosecution submitted that on 2 September
2002 the appellant had been a member of an unlawful assembly with the common
object of causing hurt to the victims under s 141(c) of the PC. Since force or
violence was used by the assembly or by any member thereof in prosecution of
their common object, the appellant was guilty of the offence of rioting, as
provided for under s 146 of the PC.

_**

The defence

**_

15 The appellant’s defence was that he never took part in the riot and was
mistakenly identified by Ridzuan as being part of the group assaulting the
victims that night. The appellant testified as follows: he had spent that
evening in a pub at Boat Quay, together with his wife, Ridiawati Bte Mohd
Reduan (‘Ridiawati’), at a party celebrating the birthday of ‘Baby’, the wife
of the third accused, Zulkeplee. The other three co-accused were also present
at the party.

16 At about 3.00 am, the appellant and his wife left the party. They accepted
one Abdul Faisal’s offer to take them home in his lorry. The second accused
Mohd Noor, the third accused Zulkeplee and his wife ‘Baby’, the fourth accused
Mohd Hardian and his wife, were also in the same lorry. Besides the persons
named above, there were also other persons in the lorry.

17 The group decided to detour to Pasir Ris Park where Abdul Faisal parked the
lorry at car park ‘E’, Pasir Ris Park. As ‘Baby’ wanted to vomit at that time,
Ridiawati, Zulkeplee, the appellant and ‘two other couples’ took ‘Baby’ to a
toilet located beside the car park. When they reached the toilet, all the
ladies used the toilet first, leaving ‘Baby’ seated outside on a bench.
Zulkeplee, the appellant and two other male persons attended to her. The
ladies came out and took ‘Baby’ into the toilet. The appellant and the others
then used the toilet.

18 About ten minutes later, the appellant stated that he saw a group of Malay
males running towards the car park. Someone shouted for everyone to board the
lorry. The appellant and the others who were with him previously at the toilet
complied. Abdul Faisal then drove off. Subsequently, a police car stopped the
lorry and everyone onboard was taken to the police station.

19 Hence, the main plank of the appellant’s defence was that he had been at
the toilet attending to ‘Baby’ when the incidents took place. He had not been
part of the group which approached and assaulted the victims. The testimonies
of the appellant’s wife (Ridiawati) and two of the co-accused (Zulkeplee and
Mohd Hardian) supported this version of events.

_**

The decision below

**_

20 The trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s testimony that he was at the
toilet when the incidents took place for two main reasons. First, there were
material discrepancies between the appellant’s statement recorded under s
122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC’) and his long statement recorded
under s 121 of the CPC. In the appellant’s s 122(6) statement, he stated that
he had been at the lorry; while in his long statement, he stated that he had
accompanied his wife to the toilet.

21 Secondly, the testimonies of the defence witnesses were not credible.
Ridiawati, being the appellant’s wife, was an interested witness. Zulkeplee
and Mohd Hardian, being jointly tried as co-accused, also stood to gain by a
unified defence of an alibi, namely, that they were not present during the
riot but were at the toilet attending to ‘Baby’ at that time. In any case,
Mohd Hardian’s evidence was also full of inconsistencies. In one police
statement, he stated that he never saw the fight. However, he testified
subsequently in court that he had gone to the scene and tried to stop the
fight after Mohd Noor shouted for him. Lastly, Sunny, as a prosecution
witness, had also identified Mohd Hardian and Zulkeplee as being part of the
group which approached the victims, thus bringing into question the veracity
of their evidence that the appellant had been with them at the toilet. Sunny’s
evidence here was entitled to significant weight because he had a special
reason to remember Mohd Hardian and Zulkeplee, they being the ones who punched
him on the left jaw and forehead.

22 The trial judge further accepted Ridzuan’s testimony that the appellant was
part of the group. However, given that Ridzuan had upon cross-examination
admitted that he could not see clearly the person who had assaulted him with a
belt, it might be that the assailant was not the appellant. Nevertheless, he
held that the appellant’s presence or ‘active role’ in the group was
sufficient to render him a member of the unlawful assembly, whether or not he
had actually assaulted Ridzuan with a belt.

_**

Issues arising on appeal

**_

23 Given that conviction depended solely on Ridzuan’s identification of the
appellant as a member of the group which had approached the victims, much of
the appeal was focused on attacking his testimony. The appellant appealed
against his conviction on two main grounds:

> (i) The trial judge erred in law in considering the appellant’s mere
> presence in the group as sufficient to render him a member of an unlawful
> assembly. It must be shown that the appellant was an "active participant";
> and
>
> (ii) Even if mere presence was sufficient to render the appellant a member
> of an unlawful assembly, the trial judge should not have found him to be
> present based solely on Ridzuan’s testimony for the following reasons:

> > (a) Ridzuan was not a credible witness;
>>

>> (b) Ridzuan’s evidence was inconsistent with the evidence of the other
prosecution witnesses;

>>

>> (c) The quality of Ridzuan’s identification evidence was poor and should be
rejected by the trial judge; and

>>

>> (d) It was unsafe to convict the appellant solely on the uncorroborated
evidence of Ridzuan as he was a minor prone to giving ‘whimsical evidence’.

_**

First ground of appeal: whether mere presence was sufficient to constitute
membership of an unlawful assembly

**_

24 Unlawful assembly’ and ‘rioting’ are defined in s 141 and s 146 of the PC
respectively which provide as follows:

> > 141\. An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an "unlawful
> assembly", if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is —
>>

>> …

>>

>> (c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence;

>>

>> …

>>

>> 146\. Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly _**or by
any member thereof**_ , in prosecution of the common object of such assembly,
_**every**_ member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting
[Emphases added].

25 It was not in dispute that the group of 15-20 Malay males which approached
the victims shared the common object of causing hurt to the victims, hence
constituting an unlawful assembly under s 141(c) of the PC. Further, since
violence was clearly used by some members of that assembly, in prosecution of
the common object of such assembly, _every_ member of such assembly at the
time when violence was used was guilty of rioting under s 146. The only issue
in the present case was whether the appellant had been a member of that
assembly when violence was used.

26 The test of membership in an unlawful assembly is set out in s 142 of the
PC which reads as follows:

> > 142\. Whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful
> assembly, _**intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in it**_ , is
> said to be a member of an unlawful assembly [Emphasis added].

Section 142 emphasises the point that anyone who voluntarily associates
himself with an assembly after he is aware of facts rendering that assembly
unlawful, is deemed to share the common object of that assembly, and hence
becomes a member of that assembly. This was confirmed by _Lim Thian Hor & Anor
v PP_ [1996] 2 SLR 258 where I stated the following opinion at p 264:

> > It is of course well settled law that a mere presence in an assembly of
> persons did not make the accused a member of an unlawful assembly, unless
> there was direct or circumstantial evidence to show that the accused shared
> the common object of the assembly. **_In my opinion, however, a person
> present at the assembly can be said to be a member of the assembly even if
> no overt act is proved against him. Provided the circumstances are such as
> to justify an inference that he associated himself with the offending
> members, it may be inferred that he is a member of such an assembly._ **In
> every case, this question is one of fact as to whether he happens to be
> innocently present at the place of occurrence or was actually a member of
> the unlawful assembly: see _Bishambar v State of Bihar_ AIR 1971 SC 2381.
> [Emphasis added]

Therefore, mere passive presence in an unlawful assembly _may or may not_
constitute membership of that assembly: it depends on whether in all the
circumstances of the case, the Court can draw the inference even from a
person’s mere presence that he shared the common object of that assembly.
There is no rigid rule that mere presence can never constitute membership of
an unlawful assembly. Similarly, there is no requirement that a member of an
unlawful assembly must be an ‘active participant’ or that some ‘overt act’
must be proven against him.

27 On the facts of the present case, a group of 15-20 males walked towards and
surrounded four greatly outnumbered victims in a public park at 4.00 am in the
morning. One person within the group repeatedly asked Sunny threatening
questions about which secret society he belonged to. Someone then smashed a
glass bottle and a fight broke out soon after. In such circumstances, it would
have been clear to the appellant that the common object of the assembly was to
cause hurt to others, at least from the point when the threatening questions
were asked. If he chose to continue to remain present in the assembly beyond
that point, the inference would be irresistible that he shared the common
object of that assembly, unless he could convince the court that he had some
special reason for doing so. However, no such reason was tendered. Although
the entire event happened in a matter of minutes, there was still sufficient
time for the appellant to dissociate himself from the group if he had wanted
to do so.

28 It was hence clear that, on the facts of the case, the trial judge was
justified in holding that continued presence by the appellant in the unlawful
assembly when threatening questions were asked and when the fight broke out
was sufficient to render him a member of that assembly. Particularly, there
was no need for the prosecution to prove that the appellant had actually
assaulted Ridzuan with a belt. It must be emphasised that I do not mean to say
that presence in an unlawful assembly is always or usually sufficient to
constitute membership. Each case must be decided on its own facts.

_**

Second ground of appeal: whether the appellant was present in the unlawful
assembly when the threatening questions were asked and when the fight broke
out

**

(a) Ridzuan’s credibility

_

29 The appellant tried to impeach Ridzuan’s credibility by pointing out
numerous discrepancies in his evidence. Before I examine the alleged
discrepancies, three general principles with respect to impeaching witnesses’
credibility shall be reiterated.

30 First, ‘innocent’ discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies.
I have expressed the following opinion in _Lewis Christina v PP_[2001] 3 SLR
165 at 170:

> > … a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness. The trial
> judge is entitled to determine which part of the witness’s testimony remains
> credible despite its discrepancies.

Therefore, if the discrepancies are innocent, the judge is entitled to rely on
those parts of the evidence which are untainted by the discrepancies. However,
if the witness has deliberately lied to the court, it is clear that he is not
a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest of his evidence must
be scrutinised with great care and indeed with suspicion. To say, however,
that because a witness has been proved a liar on one or two points then the
whole of his evidence "must in law be rejected" is to go too far and is wrong:
per Thomson CJ in _Khoo Chye Hin v PP_ [1961] MLJ 105 at 107.

31 Secondly, the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached unless there are
serious discrepancies or material contradictions in his evidence: _Mohammed
Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP_ [2002] 1 SLR 344 at 33. ‘Serious discrepancies’
or ‘material discrepancies’ are those that go to the crux of the charge
against the appellant: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ [1998] 2 SLR 592 at 26.

32 Thirdly, even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it does not automatically
lead to a total rejection of his evidence. The court must carefully scrutinise
the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which
aspect should be disregarded: _PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng_ [1992] 1 SLR 138
at 148 _; Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP_ [1998] 2 SLR 592 at 24; and _Loganatha
Venkatesan v PP_ [2000] 3 SLR 677 at 56.

33 I will now apply the foregoing principles to the facts of this case. The
alleged discrepancies in this case were as follows:

> > (a) Ridzuan, under cross-examination, stated that Sunny was wearing a
> long-sleeved dark-coloured sweater throughout the incident. Upon further
> questioning, he said that Sunny was shirtless instead.
>>

>> (b) Ridzuan stated in his examination-in-chief that the appellant smacked
him with a belt but admitted under cross-examination that he did not see his
assailant clearly.

>

>> (c) Ridzuan, under cross-examination, stated that when the group approached
barbecue pit ‘O’, the appellant’s belt was untidily rolled up and he held it
in his hands. Upon further questioning, Ridzuan said that the belt was
‘dangling’ instead.

>>

>> (d) Under cross-examination, Ridzuan stated that he had told Dr Wang that
he had been assaulted with a belt. However, Dr Wang’s medical report indicated
that "no weapons were used".

It was apparent that none of the alleged discrepancies were material because
they did not go to the crux of the charge against the appellant. As discussed
in 26-28 above, the crux of the charge in this case was whether the appellant
voluntarily remained as part of the group before and during the riot.
Particularly, (b) and (d) were not crucial to the appellant’s charge because
in order to constitute rioting under s 146 of the PC, the prosecution need not
go further to prove that the appellant had actually assaulted Ridzuan with a
belt. Hence, Ridzuan’s credibility as a witness was not successfully
impeached: _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP._

_

(b) Inconsistencies between the evidence of Ridzuan and the other prosecution
witnesses

_

34 In _Ng Kwee Leong v PP_ [1998] 3 SLR 942, inconsistencies between the
evidence of different witnesses were classified into three main categories:

> > (a) The first category is where the discrepancies relied on are immaterial
> discrepancies, which have no direct bearing on the facts in issue. In such
> instances, the trial judge should find that these discrepancies do not
> detract from the general veracity of the witnesses on the material issues
> and accept their evidence on those issues.
>>

>> (b) The second category is where the discrepancy, while not relating
directly to the crux of the prosecution’s or defence’s case, as the case may
be, may be viewed as deliberate concoction of the witness and affect the
credibility of the witness. A cautionary note was sounded in that, even if a
witness is found to have lied on a matter, it does not necessarily affect his
credibility as a whole.

>>

>> (c) The third category concerns discrepancies where two persons give
separate accounts as to short periods of time. Adequate allowance must be
given to human fallibility in the precise assessment of short spans of time.
Accordingly, discrepancies are to be expected where two persons give separate
accounts as to short passages of time. Accordingly, the court in weighing the
testimony of witnesses must recognise human fallibility in observation,
retention and recollection.

35 The inconsistency alleged in the present case related to the fact that the
prosecution witnesses gave differing accounts as to how Ridzuan came to be
assaulted with a belt. Their conflicting evidence was as follows:

> > (i) Ridzuan testified that the appellant was holding a belt in his hand
> before the assault began and, when the fight started, he hit Ridzuan with
> the belt.
>>

>> (ii) Syarifa Farhana Bte Syed Hamdan (‘Syarifa’) testified that she saw a
person pull a belt out of his trousers and begin to attack Ridzuan.

>>

>> (iii) Siti Nuraini Bte Abdul Jalil (‘Siti’) gave evidence that she never
saw anyone using a belt as a weapon during the fight.

>>

>> (iv) Nur Zakiah Bte Jafar (‘Zakiah’) gave evidence that the person who
assaulted Ridzuan with a belt was wearing a baseball cap. No evidence was led
to the effect that the appellant was wearing a cap at the particular time.
Defence witnesses also stated that the appellant was not wearing any headgear.

36 Applying the classification adopted in _Ng Kwee Leong_ to the present case,
there were two reasons why these inconsistencies did not affect the charge
against the appellant. First, these discrepancies were not material since it
was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the appellant had actually
used the belt to assault Ridzuan (see 26-28 and 33 above), hence falling under
the first category. Secondly, the discrepancies might be due to people giving
separate accounts as to short periods of time, hence falling under the third
category. There was only a two to three minute interval between the time when
the group confronted the victims and when Ridzuan was assaulted with a belt.
Given the chaotic situation at that time, it would not be unusual for
witnesses to come up with different accounts of the same event. Further,
Syarifa, Siti and Zakiah were at another barbecue pit ‘N’ which was some ten
metres away from the confrontation and, given that the park was dimly lit,
might have affected the accuracy of their observations _vis--vis_ Ridzuan’s
observations.

37 The trial judge was therefore entitled to prefer the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses. It should also be highlighted at this point that
failure by the other victims to identify the appellant was of little weight
considering that the group was very large and it was only inevitable that the
victims remembered different persons in the group.

_

(c) The quality of Ridzuan’s identification evidence was poor and should be
rejected by the trial judge

_

38 The judge followed the guidelines laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Heng
Aik Ren Thomas v PP_ [1998] 3 SLR 465 in assessing the weight of
identification evidence. Essentially, there are three stages to the test.

39 The first stage involves the trial judge asking himself whether the case
against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the
identification evidence that is alleged by the defence as being mistaken. If
the first stage is answered in the affirmative, the second question should be
whether the identification evidence is of good quality, taking into account
the circumstances in which the identification was made. If the quality of the
identification evidence is poor, the judge should go on to the third stage
which involves the question of whether there is any other evidence that goes
to support the correctness of the identification. At the third stage, if the
judge is unable to find other supporting evidence for the identification
evidence, he should be mindful that a conviction based on such poor evidence
would be unsafe.

40 It was not in dispute that the conviction depended wholly on Ridzuan’s
identification evidence. The appellant contended under the second stage of the
_Heng Aik Ren Thomas_ test that the identification evidence was of poor
quality and the trial judge should have gone on to look for supporting
evidence. However, on the facts of the case, the judge was certainly entitled
to conclude that the identification evidence was of good quality, considering
that Ridzuan was able to observe the appellant at close range, the area around
the barbecue pit was illuminated by lamp-posts, no obstruction obscured
Ridzuan’s observations, the identification parade was conducted just eight
hours after the incident and there was a special reason for Ridzuan to
remember the appellant because the appellant was holding a belt in his hands
when the assembly approached the victims.

_

(d) Whether Ridzuan’s evidence required corroboration

_

41 There is no mandatory requirement of independent corroborating evidence
before a trial judge can convict an accused based solely on the testimony of a
minor: _Lee Kwang Peng v PP_ [1997] 3 SLR 278. It is a matter for the
discretion of the judge as to whether a witness is mature and reliable enough
such that his testimony is considered reliable without the need for
independent corroborating evidence.

42 A trial judge who has had the benefit of observing the demeanour and
conduct of the child witness would be in a far better position to decide if
corroboration is required in the circumstances of the case. An appellate court
would not readily interfere with such a finding: _Chen Jian Wei v PP_ [2002] 2
SLR 255 at 34. In the present case, the trial judge had specifically
considered carefully whether corroboration evidence was required before
concluding that none was required. At 60 of his judgment, he stated as
follows:

> > …Ridzuan is a student who had passed his ‘N’ levels and awaiting his ‘O’
> level results…he was aware of the implications of giving evidence on oath.
> Having heard his testimony and observed his demeanour I was satisfied that
> he has given a truthful account of the events as they occurred. He was a
> victim of an assault and not a bystander who would have been able to
> [remember] everything that happened. There were no material discrepancies or
> whimsical changes in his testimony indicating that he was unaware of the
> implications and consequences of lying on oath…There was no need for
> corroborative evidence in view of the totality of the evidence.

43 In my opinion, there were no grounds to overturn the exercise of the
judge’s discretion. As discussed in 33 above, any discrepancy in Ridzuan’s
evidence was immaterial to the charge. Ridzuan was consistent on the material
point all throughout the trial, namely, that he saw the appellant, with a belt
in his hand, walking towards barbecue pit ‘O’ in a group and remaining there
before and during the fight. This was in marked contrast to the child witness
in _Chen Jian Wei v PP_ who changed his testimony on a most material point
upon knowing that the accused was actually being charged with a more serious
offence. The witness in _Chen Jian Wei v PP_ was clearly not mature enough to
understand the solemnity of giving evidence in court. Ridzuan’s evidence might
have contained some immaterial discrepancies, but it would be going too far to
say that he was a ‘whimsical’ witness whose evidence could not be relied upon
without independent corroborating evidence.

_**

Conclusion

**_

44 In my opinion, both grounds of appeal were unsustainable. On the totality
of the evidence, the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable
doubt. For the foregoing reasons, I ordered the appeal to be dismissed.
