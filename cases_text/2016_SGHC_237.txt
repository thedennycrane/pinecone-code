High Court — Criminal Case No 52 of 2016  
Choo Han Teck J  
11–12, 19 October 2016

20 October 2016

Choo Han Teck J:

1 Tan Kim Hup (“the accused”) faced 19 charges for various offences under the
Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). At the trial before me, the
prosecution applied to stand down 18 of the charges and proceeded on a single
charge that the accused:

…on 23rd September 2014, at or about 9.00 p.m., at unit #06-11 of Grandlink
Square, Geylang Lorong 44, Singapore, did traffic in a Class ‘A’ Controlled
Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008
Rev Ed), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking
twenty seven packets containing 4456.6 grams of granular/powdery substance
which was analysed and found to contain not less than 126.4 grams of
diamorphine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made
thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a)
read with section 5(2) of the said Act, which offence is punishable under
section 33(1) of the said Act, and further, upon your conviction for the said
offence, you may be alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B
of the said Act.

2 The accused indicated that he wished to plead guilty. I did not accept his
plea and asked the prosecution to adduce evidence to prove its case pursuant
to s 227(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). Section
227(3) stated that:

(3) The High Court shall not record a plea of guilty in a case where the
accused pleads guilty to an offence punishable with death unless the accused
has been committed to stand trial in the High Court under Division 2 of Part X
for the offence, and evidence is led by the prosecution to prove its case at
the trial.

3 The prosecution called 38 witnesses. The accused did not challenge any of
the evidence and declined to cross-examine any of them. At the close of the
prosecution’s case, I found that there was sufficient evidence to call the
accused to give his defence. The accused elected to remain silent. At the end
of the trial, I found that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the charge and convicted him
accordingly. The 18 charges that were stood down previously were withdrawn by
the prosecution following the conviction of the accused.

4 The arrests, seizures of exhibits, chain of custody, as well as the analysis
of the exhibits in the charge before me were undisputed. On 23 September 2014,
the accused and one Lim Kee Wan (“Lim”) were arrested in the car-park of
Grandlink Square, Geylang Lorong 44, Singapore, by officers from the Central
Narcotics Bureau (CNB) on suspicion of them having committed offences under
the Misuse of Drugs Act. The accused and Lim were escorted to the rented
apartment of the accused at Grandlink Square (“the Apartment”). There, the CNB
officers recovered 27 packets containing diamorphine which formed the subject
matter of the charge against the accused. The 27 packets of diamorphine were
subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for analysis. The
results are listed on the table below.

Marking| Location| Description  
---|---|---  
E1A| Location ‘E’Top left drawer of a wardrobe| One packet containing 14.38g
(net) of diamorphine  
E2A1| One packet containing 6.04g (net) of diamorphine  
E3A1| 17 packets containing a total of 0.77g (net) of diamorphine  
K1C1| Location ‘K’Under a sink in the toilet of the unit’s bedroom
(collectively, the “K exhibits”)| One packet containing 13.61g (net) of
diamorphine  
K1D1| One packet containing 14.67g (net) of diamorphine  
K1E1| One packet containing 13.29g (net) of diamorphine  
K1F1| One packet containing 12.98g (net) of diamorphine  
K1G1| One packet containing 13.75g (net) of diamorphine  
K1H1| One packet containing 12.88g (net) of diamorphine  
K1J1| One packet containing 11.90g (net) of diamorphine  
K1K1| One packet containing 12.13g (net) of diamorphine  
  
5 Section 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act provided that a person caught in
possession of more than 2g of diamorphine was “presumed to have had that drug
in possession for the purpose of trafficking”. Section 17(c) stated that:

Presumption concerning trafficking

17\. Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than —

…

(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine;

whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture
shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of
trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for
that purpose.

6 The accused admitted that he was in possession of the 27 packets of
diamorphine. The accused’s story from his statements adduced through the
prosecution witnesses was that he was a drug trafficker who collected, stored,
and delivered drugs on the instructions of a person known as ‘MK’. In exchange
for his services, the accused would be paid and given drugs for his
consumption. The accused rented the Apartment approximately 10 days prior to
his arrest and used it to store drugs.

7 According to the statements of the accused, most of the diamorphine forming
the subject matter of the charge were from a consignment collected by him on
23 September 2014. On 23 September 2014, the accused was driven by Lim to a
Chinese temple near his house. There, he met a male Indian drug courier who
passed him a brown paper bag (marked “K1”) containing diamorphine. The accused
knew that “K1” contained diamorphine. The accused and Lim then returned to the
Apartment where the accused opened up “K1” and counted the number of packets.
The accused found “K1” to contain 10 packets each containing one pound (gross
weight) of heroin. From the ten packets of heroin contained in “K1”, the
accused removed two packets and placed them in other locations within the
unit, where they were recovered. The remaining eight packets were left in the
bag “K1” in the toilet where they were eventually recovered by the CNB
officers. The rest of the diamorphine, namely, the 17 packets of diamorphine
marked “E3A1” was from an earlier consignment. These 17 packets were packed by
Lim on 22 September 2014 on the directions of the accused.

8 The DNA evidence corroborated the accused’s story. The accused’s DNA was
found on various parts of the drug exhibits recovered from the accused’s
apartment. The accused’s DNA was found on the inside and outside of the
exhibit marked “E1”, which was the white plastic bag found to contain the
packet of diamorphine marked “E1A”. This was consistent with the accused’s
account of placing “E1A” into the white plastic bag. The accused’s DNA was
also found on the string handles of the brown paper bag marked “K1” which was
passed to the accused. On the basis of the evidence before me, I found that
the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
possessed the 27 packets of diamorphine that contained not less than 126.4g
(net) of diamorphine.

9 I also found that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
the 27 packets of diamorphine were meant for the purpose of trafficking.
Having elected to remain silent, the presumption of trafficking against him
under s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act was not discharged. Beyond the
operation of the presumption, the accused had also admitted in his statements
that the drugs seized from the Apartment were meant to be delivered to
customers at the instructions of ‘MK’.

10 Accordingly, I convicted the accused of the charge. As the alternative
sentencing regime under s 33B of the Misuse of Drugs Act did not apply, I
imposed the mandatory sentence of death on him.
