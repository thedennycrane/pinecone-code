Lee Seiu Kin J:

1 The first accused, Hamidah Binte Awang, was tried before me on various dates
between 10 September and 6 November 2014. On 5 November 2014 I found her
guilty of attempting to export not less than 1,963.3 g of methamphetamine, an
offence under s 7 read with s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev
Ed) (“the Act”). Full details of the trial and my findings are in my grounds
of decision in _Public Prosecutor v Hamidah Binte Awang and another_ [2015]
SGHC 4 dated 8 January 2015.

2 On 8 October 2015, the first accused was brought before me for sentencing.
The learned Deputy produced a memorandum in which the Public Prosecutor
certified that she had substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in
disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore, under s
33B(2)(_b_) of the Act. I was satisfied from the evidence before me in the
trial that the involvement of the first accused was restricted to the
activities set out in s 33B(2)(_a_). The accused therefore satisfied the
requirements of s 33B(2).

3 In view of the circumstances of the case, I exercised my discretion under s
33B(1)(_a_) of the Act to sentence the first accused to imprisonment for life
instead of the death penalty. As she is a female, she is not liable to be
caned. I also exercised my discretion to backdate the sentence to the date of
her arrest on 13 November 2011. That is the minimum sentence that I am able to
impose for her conviction.

4 The accused has appealed against her sentence on 14 October 2015.
