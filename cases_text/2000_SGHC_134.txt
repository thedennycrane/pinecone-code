: The three plaintiffs were former employees of Barclays Capital Securities
Asia Ltd (`Barclays`). The first plaintiff was employed at Barclays` office in
Singapore as the Director of Derivatives. The second and third plaintiffs were
employed by Barclays` Hong Kong office as the Assistant Director of
Derivatives, and Associate Director of Equity Derivative Sales respectively.
The defendants are an off-shore bank operating in Singapore. Initially, two
separate suits were commenced by the plaintiffs against the defendants, but
the suits were subsequently consolidated. The claim by the plaintiffs is for
damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and alternatively under s 2(1) of the
Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390) (innocent misrepresentation). The defendants
applied to strike out the consolidated statement of claim under O 18 r 19 of
the Rules of Court. Mr Ashok Kumar appearing for the defendants relied on all
four grounds of this rule, namely, that the claim:

(a) discloses no reasonable cause of action;

(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;

(c) may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; and

(d) is an abuse of the process of the court.  
  
The consolidated statement of claim is 64 pages long, much of which was
devoted to the recital of representations allegedly made by or on behalf of
the defendants. The plaintiffs say that all those representations were false
and made with the knowledge that they were false or without a reasonable
belief that they were true.  
  
The plaintiffs` claim is that sometime in November 1997 the defendants
intimated to them that they (the defendants) have taken steps to establish an
investment banking business in the Asia-Pacific region and the expertise of
the plaintiffs were required to participate in this business. The plaintiffs
say that in order to induce them to leave their jobs at Barclays the
defendants made the representations set out in the statement of claim. It is
only necessary to set out a few of them to appreciate the nature and character
of the representations. For convenience I shall only refer to the first five
representations as pleaded at page three of the amended consolidated statement
of claim:

> _
>
> (1) that the defendants had decided and had begun implementing a plan to
> establish in the immediate future in Asia, including Japan and Australasia,
> ie Australia and New Zealand (`the Asia-Pacific Region`), and investment
> banking business in the true and commonly understood sense of the word
> within the banking and financial industry, ie the engagement in capital
> markets business in equities and/or fixed income securities, with sales and
> trading in these securities and their derivatives supporting these capital
> market activities (`True Investment Banking Business`);
>
> (2) that a credit and equity derivatives sales and trading business
> including arbitrage trading would be an important component of the
> defendants` aforesaid True Investment Banking Business in the Asia-Pacific
> Region;
>
> (3) that the credit and equity derivatives sales and trading business,
> including arbitrage trading, of the defendants in the Asia-Pacific Region
> would be conducted and coordinated through a formal consolidated desk of
> traders, marketers and support staff (`the Desk`);
>
> (4) that the Desk would have ultimate and exclusive authority, management
> and control over all of the Defendants` sales and trading of equity and
> credit derivatives, including arbitrage trading, in the Asia-Pacific Region;
>
> (5) that the defendants were fully committed to the plan of establishing in
> the Asia-Pacific Region a True Investment Banking Business in general, and a
> credit and equity derivatives sales and trading business, including
> arbitrage trading, and hence the Desk, in particular; and had, as an
> indication of their commitment to this plan, already budgeted and allocated
> a sum of United States Dollars (`USD`) 80 million over three years for
> systems development and staff recruitment for the Asia-Pacific Region to
> establish the Desk along with the other investment banking lines of
> businesses;
>
> _

  
  
Mr Kumar`s first complaint was that the statement of claim fails to set out
particulars of the fraudulent intention on the part of the defendants. He drew
my attention to the unreported case of **_Tan Boon Hock v Aero Supplies
Systems Engineering Pte Ltd_** (Suit 2151/90) in which the elements necessary
to maintain an action in the tort of deceit were enumerated by the learned
judge LP Thean JA; one of the said elements being the requirement to set out
particulars of the alleged fraudulent intent. The gist of Mr Kumar`s argument
was that it is a weak voice that cries fraud without uttering details of the
fraudulent design. As a matter of principle I agree with him entirely. A false
statement is not necessarily a fraudulent statement in the context of
fraudulent misrepresentation. There are innocuous reasons why a person might
have made a statement that turns out to be untrue. A fraudulent
misrepresentation is a representation made by a person knowing that it was
false or so recklessly uncaring as to whether it was true or not. So Mr Kumar
submitted that the plaintiffs ought to state the details and basis sufficient
to pin the tag of fraud on the representations alleged to have been made by or
on the defendants` behalf.  
  
The plaintiffs` case was argued by Miss Yeo (assisted by Mr Lim), and, on the
second day of arguments, by Mr Woo. Miss Yeo submitted that the statement of
claim adequately provided all necessary details. The only relevant part reads
as follows:

> _
>
> 7 All the representations to the first plaintiff were made by the
> defendants, their aforementioned servants and/or agents:
>
> (a) knowing that they were false,
>
> (b) without any belief in their truth,
>
> (c) recklessly, without care as to whether they were true or false.
>
> _

  
  
The question that must be asked is this: Would the defendants know what case
it is that they have to meet from this pleading? They may be fully aware that
the allegations must be challenged, but what would they say to the crucial
part that accuses them of having made those representations fraudulently? If
they are to be given a fair chance of refuting that element details of the
alleged fraudulent intent must be provided. In the context of this case, I
would expect, for example, a statement setting out the defendants` knowledge
of some specific fact or facts, or the existence of some specific fact or
circumstances which were clearly contradictory and inconsistent with the
representations made by them. Otherwise, the pleading is no more than a bare
accusation that the defendants intended to deceive. The pleading of a cause of
action founded on the tort of deceit must give full particulars of the basis
for the averment or else it must be struck out. The requirement of full
particulars is not an invitation to the plaintiffs to plead evidence. Counsel
settling the pleadings must exercise their professional expertise in
separating facts which found the action and evidence proving those facts.  
  
Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that even if they did not set out the
particulars of fraud, it was sufficient if they prove that the representations
made by the defendants were untrue and that they (the defendants) had no
reasonable ground to believe that they were true. Counsel presented this
argument on the basis that the plaintiffs are relying on s 2(1) of the
Misrepresentation Act as their alternative claim. This provision provides a
remedy in a contractual claim and must not be confused with a cause of action
in tort. A claim founded on the Misrepresentation Act is an action in
contract. In that regard, the plaintiffs need only plead the facts
establishing the contract, the representations that induced them into
contracting with the defendants, and that the representations were not true,
but this approach cannot be applied to the pleading of an action in deceit
which is an entirely different cause of action. Thus, if they do not provide
sufficient particulars to support a claim based on deceit or negligence (they
have not pleaded negligence as a cause of action here), that part of their
claim must be struck out, but they may still proceed with their alternative
claim under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act if their pleading adequately
sets out that claim. Therefore, I think that counsel for the plaintiffs was
wrong in submitting that the inadequate pleading in tort is saved by the
alternative plea under s 2(1).  
  
For the reasons above, I am of the view that the plaintiffs have not set out
sufficient particulars of the fraudulent intention and their claim based on
this cause of action must be struck out on this ground alone. There is another
ground upon which this cause of action ought to be struck out, namely, that
the pleadings were frivolous and vexatious. That is also the ground which Mr
Kumar relies on in respect of the plaintiffs` alternative cause of action
under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act, and I shall therefore deal with
them together.  
  
In determining whether the action is frivolous or vexatious, the court is
obliged to look at the pleadings and evidence but it is not the objective of
the court to conduct a mini-trial based on the affidavits, or embark upon `a
minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case, to
see if the plaintiffs have a cause of action` (see **Wenlock v Moloney**
[1965] 2 All ER 871[1965] 1 WLR 1238. In this case, I need only consider some
brief and simple undisputed facts.  
  
All three plaintiffs signed contracts of employment with the defendants. The
contracts were signed at different dates and, apart from some individual
differences, the terms were essentially the same. The first and third
plaintiffs signed their contracts with the defendants on 9 February and 28
April 1998 respectively. They resigned from Barclays on 11 February and 11 May
1998 respectively. It is not known when the second defendant resigned from
Barclays, but his contract with the defendants was also signed on 28 April
1998. All three contracts provide the following term:

> _Should the [defendants] decide to withdraw from active involvement in
> Investment Banking or should your employment be terminated by the Bank other
> than by reason of your resignation or gross misconduct within the first
> three years of your commencing employment with the Bank then you shall be
> compensated for the outstanding portion of your first three years` salary
> and guaranteed bonus payments._

  
  
In the case of the first plaintiff, his salary was $290,000. Under his
contract he was given $800,000 as a `joining bonus`, and $875,000 guaranteed
bonus. He conceded that upon termination he was paid off in full as
contractually stipulated, including the balance of his first three years`
salary. However, he claimed in his affidavit that these payments were `in
mitigation of [his] damages`. He further averred that he was `advised that his
claims based on fraud and the tort of deceit exceed any damages based on any
contractual claim`. The second and third plaintiffs received similar payments
although in lesser amounts as their salaries were lower than that of the first
plaintiff. The third plaintiff was also paid compensation for unused annual
leave, and a special payment for two months of housing after his termination.  
  
The following termination clause is provided in the contracts: `Either [the
defendants] or you may terminate employment for any reason (apart from gross
misconduct in which case no notice is required) by giving the other party
three months` notice in writing. The [defendants] reserves the right to pay
you three months` salary-in-lieu of notice`. It is not disputed that proper
notices of termination were issued to all three plaintiffs.  
  
The plaintiffs were recruited by the defendants to help them set up, operate
and carry on the business of investment banking. Mr Woo conceded that the job
descriptions in the respective contracts are accurate descriptions. I turn now
to the nature of the alleged representations. It can hardly be disputed that
the alleged representations such as those that I have set out above are
subsidiary to the scope of the employment. If the investment business does not
exist or cease to exist, the matters set out in the representations will have
no meaningful existence. That being the case, one need only look at the term
concerning the cessation of business. It was plainly and clearly written that
the defendants could and might withdraw from active involvement in Investment
Banking so long as they compensate the plaintiffs by payment of the money
agreed under the respective contracts. The plaintiffs` misunderstanding of
this critical term of the contract as reflected in the first plaintiff`s
affidavit of 4 July 2000 explains why this action is so utterly misconceived.
I refer to para 24 of the said affidavit:

> _To our mind and in the light of all the representations made by [the
> defendants], the clause meant exactly that - that [the defendants] may later
> decide to withdraw from its Investment Banking in the Asia-Pacific region.
> Surely this clause envisages that [the defendants] had already begun its
> Investment Banking business and had set up the Desk for Structured Products
> on Securities. The clause was entirely consistent with the various
> representations made to us and therefore did not alarm us.`_

  
  
Furthermore, the contracts provided that either party was at liberty to
terminate the employment with three months` notice. It must be patently clear
to the plaintiffs that whether the representations were true or false the core
of the matter is the commitment of the defendants to the investment banking
business. It is not the plaintiffs` case that the defendants had misled the
plaintiffs into believing that they (the defendants) would keep the business
going for any specific length of time. Under the terms, they were entitled to
change their minds the day after the contract if they wished, so long as the
plaintiffs are fully compensated as agreed in the contracts. The plaintiffs`
apparent failure to appreciate the express and unambiguous terms of the
contract is reflected in para 21 of the first plaintiff`s affidavit of 4 July
2000 where he sets out why the plaintiffs were induced into signing the
contracts:

> _If not for [the defendants`] representations that they were committed and
> had begun implementing plans for the establishment of an Investment Banking
> business in Asia-Pacific with the Structured Products on Securities being an
> important component and we would head and form the Desk trading in the
> Structured Products on Securities, we would not have left our successful
> careers in Barclays to join [the defendants] with its uncertain future._

  
  
Indeed, the plaintiffs themselves were entitled to terminate the contract if
they felt that the defendants had done nothing from the very start to get the
investment banking business going (or if they themselves wished to leave for
better things), but they did not do so. It was not stated in the affidavits,
but counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Lim, explained that the reason was that if
the plaintiffs resigned within the first three years of employment they would
not be entitled to the bonus payments. If that is so, they have affirmed the
contracts. But this is not a crucial point. The fundamental question is,
whether the plaintiffs read, understood and signed their respective contracts
of employment? The answer, by concession, is in the affirmative. Then it must
be asked, would anyone be induced by promises that great things lay in store
for him in the proposed employment if the employer is contractually entitled
to cease business and/or terminate his employment? I think that this question
must be answered objectively, and the answer in this case must be that
although they find the representations sufficiently attractive to engender the
hope that they will be true, the plaintiffs entered into the contracts fully
aware that those representations were not promises, and that any expectation
founded on those representations may be dashed by the stroke of a pen; as it
so transpired. Therefore, the plaintiffs` case that they were induced by those
representations is, in my view, unsustainable. I find it mildly surprising
therefore, to learn from Mr Woo that the plaintiffs have asked for six weeks
for trial, with an estimated 54 witnesses.  
  
In the course of his arguments Mr Woo referred to the affidavit of the first
plaintiff of 4 July 2000 in which he sets out an electronic mail message dated
16 June 1998 from Mr Theo Kocken, a senior executive in the defendants` head
office in Holland to the managing director of the defendants` Asian business.
Mr Woo submitted that this message shows that the defendants had no intention
of setting up the `Structure Finance and Arbitrage Desk` (which under his
contract the first plaintiff was to be the managing director). Reading the
message (set out in para 27 of the affidavit) the obvious point was that it
acknowledged that a group of skilled and experienced traders have joined the
defendants and will be focussing on a new kind of business that may bring
value and profits to the company. But Mr Kocken went on to say, essentially,
that the defendants were not ready for this business. He accepted that the
`front office might be hired in large quantities, but the back office is far
from fit for the job`. Mr Kocken`s note which the plaintiffs rely on shows
that the decision not to carry on with the investment business was a
commercial one. But I must add that under the terms of the contract, the
defendants could have made that decision on a whim and a fancy, and would
still be entitled to terminate the plaintiffs` employment so long as they pay
up what the contracts have provided.  
  
Having explored the matters above, I revert to the key issue, namely, ought
the plaintiffs` claim be struck out as being frivolous and vexatious. The
general principle is that however weak a plaintiff`s case may appear, he is
entitled to his day in court. He pays for any misplaced confidence in his case
by the award of costs. Thus, generally, the courts may permit seemingly weak
cases to proceed to trial so that a plaintiff is not unfairly treated by being
shut out before he has presented his evidence. By the same token, it is also
unfair to compel a defendant to expend not only money but time and effort in
defending an obviously unmeritorious case. Thus, before a court strikes out a
claim on the ground that it is frivolous or vexatious it must satisfy itself
that the claim is obviously unsustainable, or that it amounts to an abuse of
the process of court; of the latter, it has long been recognised that hopeless
litigation or claims that are `doomed to fail` fall into the category.  
  
Having regard to the incontrovertible fact that the plaintiffs signed their
employment contracts fully aware of the term that the contract may be
terminated with three months` notice and that the defendants were not obliged
to pursue the investment banking business, it is difficult to appreciate how
the plaintiffs could be induced by the pleaded representations. It seems to me
that the plaintiffs` case is so intrinsically weak that it must be condemned
as a hopeless case. The following description by Nathan J in **_Connell v
NCSC_** 15 ACLR 75, aptly applies to the instant case: `The forlorn nature of
the plaintiff`s claim is apparent on the documents. Nothing could breathe life
into it`. Mr Woo referred me to the case of **Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the
estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit** [2000] 1 SLR 517  for the
proposition that a court should not strike out a case if the defect or
deficiency in pleading could be cured by way of amendment. This proposition
has no relevance here as the plaintiffs stand by their pleadings and counsel
have not indicated that any amendment is required. For these reasons, I am of
the view that the plaintiffs` case must be struck out as frivolous and
vexatious.  
  
Accordingly, I allow the defendants` appeal and order that the plaintiffs`
claims be struck out. I will hear the question of costs on a later date.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal allowed.
