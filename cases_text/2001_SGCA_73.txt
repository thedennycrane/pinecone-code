**Judgment**

**(Costs)**

1\. In our judgment delivered on 26 October 2001, we invited parties to submit
written arguments on the question of costs. We have since been informed by the
solicitors for Dr Yeo that parties have come to an amicable settlement on the
question of costs. We accordingly make no order as to costs. The only order
that is now required is one for the refund of the deposit in court, with
interest, if any, to Dr Yeo or his solicitors. That order we now make.
