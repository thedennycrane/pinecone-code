** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

_**

Introductory **_

1 This was an interlocutory appeal against the decision of the district judge
ordering that certain prayers in the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim be
struck out. In brief, the appeal before me was concerned mainly with the
plaintiff’s contention that he had been prevented from seeking a declaration
that his dismissal by the defendants was contrary to the principles of natural
justice as he was dismissed without a hearing although his contract of
employment obligated his employers to give him a hearing. I allowed the
plaintiff’s appeal insofar as the said prayer was concerned, holding that the
said issue be best determined at the main trial. There were two other prayers
under appeal. In relation to the plaintiff’s second prayer for an order for
reinstatement in his former employment, I upheld the decision below without
prejudice to whatever reliefs the trial court may deem fit to order under
prayer 7. As regards prayer 3, I allowed the appeal. The facts which gave rise
to this appeal and my grounds are as follows.

_**

Background facts **_

2 The plaintiff had been in the employment of Singapore Airlines Limited
(SIA), the defendants herein, from 1973 until his services were terminated in
March 1997.

3 Admittedly, sometime in the course of 1996, the plaintiff was investigated
by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau; arrested on 18 February 1997
and charged in court. As he was unable to raise the bail amount, he was
remanded in Queenstown Remand Prison until the conclusion of his trial and
subsequent acquittal.

4 As it happened, whilst the plaintiff was in remand, he received a letter
from the defendants dated 5 March 1997. The relevant part therein reads:

> Dear Mr Clement,
>
> You have not reported for work since 21 February 1997 nor have you given the
> Company any reason for your unauthorised absence. You have therefore broken
> your contract of service with the Company and your employment is terminated
> with effect from 21 February 1997. Your last day of service was, therefore,
> 20 February 1997.
>
> 2\. Consequent on your termination, you will be paid your salary up to and
> including 20 February 1997.

5 Following his acquittal of the charges in June 1997, the plaintiff sought
reinstatement with the defendants but to no avail. Furthermore no agreement
was reached between the parties on the compensation package. The plaintiffs
then took out a suit - D C Suit 4989 of 1997 in November 1997 - against the
defendants claiming damages for his alleged wrongful dismissal. However, about
six months later, he sought the intervention of the Singapore Airlines Staff
Union (SIASU) to bring his grievance before the Industrial Arbitration Court.
SIASU declined his request stating that they could not justify an appeal under
s 35(1) of the Industrial Relations Act.

6 The plaintiff’s application to the court for a declaration and an order to
compel SIASU to act pursuant to his request, was unsuccessful in the first
instance as well as on appeal to the Court of Appeal.

7 The Court of Appeal, in dismissing his appeal, observed at para 14 of its
judgment that ‘… while it may well be the case that a contract exists between
the SIASU and the appellant that the rules of a trade union form the terms of
such contract between the parties, the judge was correct to hold that article
3.2(iii) is not a term in the constitution capable of being enforced by a
court of law.’

8 The Court of Appeal further commented at para 28: ‘While we sympathise
somewhat with the appellant’s position given the circumstances under which he
lost his job, we cannot find a legal basis on which to make the declarations
he applied for which compel the SIASU to make arrangement such that his case
may be brought before the IAC. If at all, the proper party against whom the
appellant should pursue his redress, if he feels that he has been done wrong
by, is Singapore Airlines. In the premises, we dismiss the appeal with costs
to be taxed.’

9 The upshot was the resuscitation of the plaintiff’s action against the
defendants and by Summons-In-Chambers No 612285 of 2000 dated 1 September
2000, the plaintiff applied to court for leave to amend his statement of
claim. Insofar as is material, the proposed amendments included the following
segments:

> 6\. Further and/or in alternative the said termination letter dated 05th
> March 1997, was unfair, in breach of the principles of rules natural justice
> and was actuated by malice and/or made in bad faith by the Defendants and/or
> its servants, and that the Defendants were not in accordance with and in
> breach of the Conditions of Service on Confirmation as provided for in the
> Defendants Personnel Procedures Manual 01st December 1992.
>

>> > > _Particulars_

>

>> (I) Conduct and discipline 8-3 Disciplinary inquires.

>

>> Disciplinary inquiries for unionised staff.

>

>> > (1) If a Divisional Director considers that an employee in his division
has committed an offence which, if proven, does not warrant severe
disciplinary action such as dismissal, demotion, or forfeiture of service
increments, he may initiate actions for a departmental inquiry.

>

>> > (2) If an offence warrants dismissal, demotion, or forfeiture of service
increments, the Divisional Director shall write to the Director of Personnel
or to the Personnel Manager, requesting for a Company inquiry to be convened.
His memo shall contain full details of the alleged offence or act of
misconduct and shall also contain the names of any witnesses to the incident
and all other relevant information.

>

>> (J) Section 8-4 Procedures for Disciplinary Inquiries.

>

>> Procedures.

>

>> (1) The Procedures for disciplinary inquiries for all staff expect
technical crew and managers and above are set out below. For technical crew,
the procedures set out in their Collective Agreement will apply. The
procedures for managers and above are set out separately.

>>

>> (10). For the reasons stated above the Plaintiff contends that he was and
is still in the employment of the Defendants as shown in the Defendants letter
addressed and dated 28th February 1997, to the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff by
way of his appeal letters sent to the Defendants on 24th June 1997, 23rd July
1997 and 29th July 1997. The Defendants were in breach, non-observance, and
not in accordance with the express and implied terms of the following:-

>

>> > > (a) Collective Agreement.

>>>>

>>>> (b) Conditions of Service on Confirmation.

>>>>

>>>> (c) Defendants Personnel Procedures Manual 01st December 1992.

>>>>

>>>> (d) Not in accordance with section 13 (2) (a) and (b) of the Employment
Act.

>
> 11\. The Plaintiff for the reasons stated above has suffered loss and
> damages. And the Plaintiff claims:-
>

>> (1) **A declaration that the purported dismissal/termination of the
Plaintiff with effect from 21 st February 1997 as stated by way of the
Defendants letter dated 05th March 1997, as null and void, unlawful,
inoperative and of no effect on the following grounds:-**

>

>> > (a) Unfair. (b) Likelihood of Bias. (c) Discrimination and Victimisation
(d) Unfair Labour Practices. (e) **Breach of rules of Natural Justice**. (f)

>

>> (2) **An order that the Plaintiff be reinstated to his position as an
Inflight Services Officer with the Defendants.**

>>

>> (3) **An order to pay the loss of salary from 24 th June 1997 at $2,071.88
per month and continuing, and loss of annual bonuses, increments, employers
CPF contributions and all travel benefits from 24th June 1997 and
continuing.**

>>

>> (4) Damages for unfair dismissal/termination.

>>

>> (5) Costs.

>>

>> (6) Interest.

>>

>> (7) Further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.

>>

>> Dated this 21st day of September 2000.

10 The defendants would not let the application go uncontested. They for their
part took out a cross application (SIC No. 612790 of 2000) to strike out the
plaintiff’s action as well as the plaintiff’s proposed amendments on grounds
of want of prosecution and that the plaintiff’s claim disclosed no reasonable
cause of action, was frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of
court.

11 The result was on 24 November 2000, both applications were heard by the
Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts, Terence Chua, who after dismissing
the defendants’ application to strike out the plaintiff’s claim, granted leave
to the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim as prayed for by him. The
duly amended statement of claim was filed by the plaintiff on 4 December 2000.

12 Approximately a year later, on 15 November 2001, the defendants required
further and better particulars of the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim
which the plaintiff provided on 23 November 2001.

13 Thereafter, the defendants filed their re-amended defence on 21 February
2001. The defence was originally filed on 12 December 1997 and was previously
amended on 19 December 2000. Insofar as is material, paras 5 to 15 of the re-
amended statement of claim read as follows:

> > 5\. Save that no admission is made with regard to the Collective Agreement
> being an award certified by a Court and as to the terms of and parties to
> the Collective Agreement paragraph 5 of the Amended Statement of Claim and
> the particulars under paragraph 5(i) are denied.
>>

>> 6\. Paragraph 5 (ii) of the Amended Statement of Claim is denied.

>>

>> 7\. No admission is made with regard to the provisions set out in paragraph
5(iii) of the Amended Statement of Claim.

>>

>> 8\. Save that no admission is made with regard to the provisions of Section
26 of the Industrial Relations Act paragraph 5(iv) of the Amended Statement of
Claim is denied.

>

>> 9\. Save that no admission is made with regard to whether the Collective
Agreement is an award certified by a Court paragraph 5(v) of the Amended
Statement of Claim is denied.

>>

>> 10\. Save that no admission is made with regard to the provisions of the
Personnel Procedures Manual as set out in the Particulars I to L under
paragraph 6 of the Amended Statement of Claim paragraph 6 of the Amended
Statement of Claim is denied. The Defendants further aver that the said
provisions of the Personnel Procedures Manual are irrelevant and/or cannot be
relied on by the Plaintiff. The Defendants repeat paragraph 3 above.

>>

>> 11\. Paragraph 6(K) of the Amended Statement of Claim is denied and the
Defendants aver that the Disciplinary Inquiry Procedure is not available to
the Plaintiff. The Defendants repeat paragraph 10 above.

>>

>> 12\. Save that the provisions of Section 13(2) (a) and (b) of the
Employment Act are admitted, paragraph 6 (L) of the Amended Statement of Claim
is denied.

>>

>> 13\. Paragraph 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim is denied and the
Defendants repeat paragraph 1 above.

>>

>> 14\. Paragraph 11 of the Amended Statement of Claim is denied and the
Defendants aver that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the declaration and/or
orders sought and/or damages as alleged or at all.

>>

>> 15\. Save as hereinbefore expressly admitted, the Defendants denies (sic)
each and every allegation contained in the Amended Statement of Claim as
though the same were herein set out and traversed seriatim.

14 Nearly nine months later, on 27 November 2001, the defendants applied to
the court by way of a Summons-For-Directions (SIC No. 603604 of 2001), amongst
other things for the determination of certain questions of law pursuant to O
14 r 12 of the Rules of Court as well as for striking out prayers 11(1)(e),
(2), (3) (see para 9 herein - highlighted parts) and such corresponding
pleadings in the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim filed two years ago on
1 September 2000.

15 In the said summons for directions, the defendants applied for the
following prayers:

> > 5\. **The determination of the Court pursuant to Rules of Court, Order 14
> Rule 12 of the following questions of law, namely:**
>>

>>> (1) **Whether the contract of employment between the Plaintiff and the
Defendants gives rise to the principle of audi alteram partem and/or to
principles of natural justice; and**

>>>

>>> (2) Whether any relief for an order for reinstatement may be claimed by
the Plaintiff arising from the non-conduct by the Defendants of an inquiry
prior to termination of the Plaintiff’s employment.

>>

>> 6\. Further or in the alternative, that the following parts of the Amended
Statement of Claim be struck out

>>

>>> **

>>>

>>> (1) Amended Statement of Claim Prayer (1)(e);

>>>

>>> (2) Amended Statement of Claim Prayer (2);

>>>

>>> (3) Amended Statement of Claim Prayer (3);

>>>

>>> **(4) and such corresponding pleadings in the Amended Statement of Claim
as the Court thinks fit. [Highlight added]****

>>

>> and the Plaintiff’s claim thereunder be dismissed with costs under Rules of
Court Order 18 rule 19 (1)(a), (b), (d) and/or under the inherent jurisdiction
of the Court on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action,
is frivolous or vexatious, and/or it is otherwise an abuse of the process of
Court.

>>

>> The grounds for the application herein are:-

>>

>> (a) The Defendants wish to give further discovery of documents relating to
instances in which the contracts of employment of employees of the Defendants
were terminated without prior inquiry, and further discovery of documents
relating to the issues in the action herein.

>>

>> (b) Time is required by the Defendants to study the Further and Better
Particulars served on 23 November 2001.

>>

>> (c) The Defendants have applied herein for a summary determination of
questions of law under Order 14 rule 12 of the Rules of Court and it would
save time and costs for the affidavits of evidence in chief of the witnesses
to be exchanged after the determination of the questions of law as framed
herein.

16 The plaintiff for his part on 9 January 2002 applied to the court (SIC No
600037/2002) for the dismissal of the defendants’ summons for directions (SIC
No. 603604 of 2001) on the ground that it was an abuse of process of court. In
an affidavit filed by the plaintiff to support his application (SIC No
600037/2002), he said:

> > 3\. Based on the Chronology of Events, your Honour will note that I had
> applied for leave to amend my Statement of Claim on the 1st of September
> 2000, and the Defendants took out a cross application on the 22nd of
> September 2000, to dismiss my application.

4\. Both application (sic) was (sic) heard on the 26th of September 2000, and
at that hearing, the Defendants’ solicitors requested for an adjournment to
file their clients’ affidavit.

5\. The matter was then heard on the 10th of October 2000. An Order was made
in the Plaintiff’s favour as the Defendants’ solicitors failed to turn up for
the hearing.

> 6\. The Defendants’ solicitors then took out an SIC to set aside the Orders
> made on the 10th of October 2000.
>
> 7\. The matter was finally heard on the 24th day of November 2000, and the
> Plaintiff was given leave to amend his Statement of Claim.
>
> 8\. As such, the Defendants’ paragraphs 6 (1) to (4), of the said
> application of the Defendants filed on the 27th of November 2001, is an
> abuse of the process of Court.
>
> 9\. Furthermore the grounds for the application as stated by the Defendants
> on page 3 (a) (b) and (c), are totally irrelevant and are not connected with
> the two affidavits filed on the 31st of December 2001, and on the 3rd of
> January 2002.
>
> 10\. As for paragraph 5 (1) and (2), of the Defendants said application, the
> matter should be decided at the trial.

17 The defendants’ application (SIC No 603604) and the plaintiff’s application
(SIC No 600037/2002), were heard by the Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate
Courts, Ng Peng Hong on 18 January 2002. Upon answering the questions of law
framed in paras 5(1) and 5(2) of the defendants’ application (see para 15
herein - highlighted parts) in the negative, the Deputy Registrar ordered that
prayers 11 (1)(e), (2) and (3) of the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim
be struck out. At the same time, the Deputy Registrar also dismissed the
application of the plaintiff (SIC No 600037 of 2002).

18 The effect of the decisions of the Deputy Registrar was that the plaintiff
could not contend at the trial that his dismissal was in breach of the rules
of natural justice; (prayer 11(1)(e)); he could not claim an order for
reinstatement in his former employment (prayer 11(2)); and that he could not
claim loss of salary and other emoluments from 24 June 1997.

19 The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal against the decision of the Deputy
Registrar on 31 January 2002 (RAS 600003/2002). His notice of appeal stated
that he intended to appeal against the decision given on 18 January 2002,
dismissing his application (SIC No 6000037 of 2002).

20 This appeal was heard by District Judge Tan Peck Cheng on 18 February 2002.
She dismissed the plaintiff’s application. In her grounds delivered on 11
April 2002, she dealt with both SIC No. 600037 of 2002 taken out by the
plaintiff and the defendants’ Summons-For- Directions No 603604 of 2001, and
concluded at para 11 of her grounds that having regard to the facts of the
case, she was in agreement with the earlier decision, that the questions of
law submitted to the court were ‘appropriate for determination under O14 r 12
of the Rules of Court’.

21 After reciting the law enunciated by the Privy Council in _**Ridge v
Baldwin And Others**_ [1964] AC 40, _**Vasudevan Pillai & Anor v The City
Council of Singapore**_ [1968] 2 MLJ 16, _**Lim Tow Peng & Anor v Singapore
Bus Services Ltd**_ [1976] 1 MLJ 254, she observed at para 15 of her grounds:

> 15\. On the authority of the above-mentioned cases there is no requirement
> of natural justice in the contract of employment and reinstatement is not a
> remedy available to the plaintiff here. In view of that I agree with the
> learned Deputy Registrar that the answers to 5(1) and (2) must be in the
> negative and consequently order in terms should be given for prayer 6. I am
> also of the view that the directions given by the learned Deputy Registrar
> in prayers 1 to 4 are in order. In the result I dismissed the plaintiff’s
> appeal.

22 The plaintiff then appealed to the High Court. In his notice of appeal (RAS
600005/2002) he prayed that the decision of the district judge made on 18
February 2002 – grounds of which were delivered on 11 April 2002 - be
reversed.

23 He later applied to the court to amend the notice of appeal in the
following terms:

> > …
>

>> 1\. The Order of Court of the District Judge Ms Tan Peck Cheng, given on 18
Feb 2002, pursuant to Registrar’s Appeal No. 600003 of 2002 (affirming the
Order of Court made by the District Judge Mr Ng Peng Hong sitting as a Deputy
Registrar, in respect of:-

>>

>>> i) the Defendants’ adjourned application for Further Directions (Entered
No. 603604 of 2001), filed on 27 Nov 2001; and

>>>

>>> ii) the Plaintiff’s application (Entered No. 6000037 of 2002, filed on 9
Jan 2002

>>>

>>> having heard and determined both applications as one and the same), be set
aside.

>>

>> 2\. The Orders made by the District Judge in respect of the Defendants’
application for Further Directions Entered No. 603604 of 2002 be set aside.

>>

>> 3\. The determination of the following questions of law, posed by the
Defendants (in the application Entered No. 603604 of 2001 filed on 27 Nov
2001), in prayers numbered 5, namely:-

>>

>>> a. Whether the contract of employment between the Plaintiff and the
Defendants give rise to the principle of "audi alteram partem" and/or to
principles of Natural Justice; and

>>>

>>> b. Whether any relief for an order of reinstatement may be claimed by the
Plaintiff arising from the non-conduct by the Defendants of an inquiry prior
to termination of the Plaintiff’s employment.

>>>

>>> and/or consequently Prayer 6 of the said application, be left for
determination by the judge at the trial of this action.

>>

>> 4\. The costs of:-

>>

>>> a. this Appeal (RAS No. 600005 of 2002); and

>>>

>>> b. the Defendants’ application for Directions Entered No. 603604 of 2001
filed on 27 Nov 2001; and

>>>

>>> c. the Plaintiff’s application Entered No. 6000037 of 2002 filed on 9 Jan
2002; and

>>>

>>> d. the Plaintiff’s Appeal (RAS 600003 of 2002 filed on 31 Jan 2002);

>>

>>> be taxed and paid by the Defendants to the Plaintiff.

>>

>> 5\. Such further and/or other relief(s) as may appear just and equitable
and/or expedient to this Honourable Court.

24 The plaintiff’s application for the amendment was objected to by
defendants’ counsel. I found the objection unmeritorious since it was plain
that his notice of appeal was comprehensive to cover the whole of the district
judge’s decision which dealt with the plaintiff’s as well as the defendants’
earlier applications. In any event, in my view, the plaintiff could have
argued his appeal even without an order to amend his notice of appeal since I
found his earlier notice of appeal to be all embracing. Consequently, I ruled
that the plaintiff be allowed to canvass the points contained in his
application for amendment. In this milieu, the appeal was argued before me.

_**

Arguments

**_

25 On appeal, the point of contention by the plaintiff was that the principles
extracted from _**Ridge v Baldwin**_ (_supra_), _**Vasudevan Pillai**_
(_supra_) and _**Lim Tow Peng**_ (_supra_) should not be viewed in isolation.
He suggested that the facts and circumstances of the cases referred to bore
little resemblance to his case and that the provisions of the personnel
procedure manual which required the defendants to conduct a hearing before an
employee’s services could be terminated, took the case out of the ambit of the
principles cited to the court. He further suggested that the terms of his
contract obligated his employers to give him a hearing; their failure and the
implications arising therefrom could not be appreciated without him being able
to canvass the breach of one of the important terms of his contract of
employment. Implicit in his contention was the aspect that had his employers
given him a hearing he would have been able to demonstrate to them that his
absence from work was not unauthorised and that he had broken none of his
contractual obligations.

26 Counsel for the defendants contended otherwise. He submitted that the law
had already been well-settled and that there was no room for the principles of
natural justice in a pure master and servant relationship.

_**

Law and conclusion

**_

27 As I said earlier, the appeal before me revolved around the rulings
contained in an order made by the learned district judge on 11 April 2002 in
relation to two questions of law, submitted to the court by the defendant’s
counsel, and the consequential striking out of certain prayers for relief ie,
prayers 11(1)(e); (2) and (3) of the plaintiff’s statement of claim (see para
9 herein – highlighted parts).

28 The first question submitted to the court below by counsel for the
defendants was: whether the contract of employment between the plaintiff and
the defendants gave rise to the principle of _audi alteram partem_ or the
principles of natural justice. Simply stated, the question was whether the
plaintiff should have been accorded a hearing by his employers before his
services were terminated. The plaintiff’s contention before me was that this
issue could not be decided in a vacuum, without determining first whether the
personnel procedure manual of SIA (adverted to by the plaintiff in his
statement of claim) which seemed to require a hearing before termination,
applied to the plaintiff’s employment contract. He said that he intended to
call witnesses to support his contention that the said personnel procedure
manual was part and parcel of the plaintiff’s employment contract as had been
applied by the defendants over the years to many of their employees.

29 It would be useful at this stage to revisit the principles of law relied on
by the defendants in the courts below.

30 In _**Ridge v Baldwin**_ (_supra_), the facts as they appear in the
headnotes are as follows:

31 In 1956 the appellant was appointed chief constable of a borough police
force, the appointment being subject to the Police Acts and Regulations. On
October 25 1957, he was arrested and charged, together with other persons,
with conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice. On October 28 1957, he was
suspended from duty by the borough watch committee. On February 28 1958, he
was acquitted by the jury on the criminal charges against him but Donovan J,
in passing sentence on two police officers who were convicted, said that the
facts admitted in the course of the trial established that neither of them had
that professional and moral leadership which they should have had and were
entitled to expect from the chief ‘constable.’

32 On March 6 1958, on a charge alleging corruption against the appellant, on
which no evidence was offered, the judge referred to the borough’s police
force and remarked on its need for a leader who would be a new influence and
who would set a different example from that which had lately obtained.

33 After his acquittal, the appellant applied to be reinstated. However, on
March 7 1958, the watch committee (constituted under s 191 of the Municipal
Corporations Act and had certain powers to hire and fire borough consultants)
at a meeting decided that he had been negligent in the discharge of his duties
as chief constable and in purported exercise of the powers conferred on them
by s 191 (4) of the Act of 1882, dismissed him from that office. Section 191
of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882 provided: (1) "The watch committee
shall from time to time appoint a sufficient number of fit men to be borough
constables … (4) The watch committee … may at any time suspend, and … dismiss,
any borough constable whom they think negligent in the discharge of his duty,
or otherwise unfit for the same."

34 It must be observed at this stage that no specific charge was formulated
against the appellant either at that meeting or at another on March 18, when
the appellant’s solicitor addressed the committee, but the watch committee, in
arriving at their decision, considered (inter alia) his own statements in
evidence and the observations made by Donovan J on February 28 and March 6.

35 On the appellant’s appeal to the Home Secretary, the decision given was
that there was sufficient material on which the watch committee could properly
exercise their power of dismissal under section 191 (4). The appellant then
brought an action against members of the watch committee for a declaration
that his dismissal was illegal, ultra vires and void, and payment of salary
from March 7 1958, or alternatively, payment of pension from that date and
damages.

36 On appeal, the House of Lords (per Lord Reid, Lord Evershed, Lord Morris of
Borth-Y-Gest, Lord Hodson and Lord Devlin - with Lord Evershed dissenting)
held that the decision of the respondents to dismiss the appellant was null
and void; and that, accordingly, notwithstanding that the decision of the Home
Secretary was ‘final and binding on the parties’ by s 2 (3) of the Police
Appeals Act 1927, that decision could not give validity to the decision of the
respondents.

37 It was further held by Lord Reid, Lord Morris and Lord Hodson at page 42
that:

> > As the appellant was not the servant of the respondents and they could
> dismiss him only on grounds stated in section 191 (4) of the Act of 1882,
> and they dismissed him on the ground of neglect of duty, they were bound to
> observe the principles of natural justice (post, pp. 66, 79, 121, 124, 127,

39 The principles of law propounded in _**Ridge v Baldwin**_ were followed in
_**Vasudevan Pillai**_(_supra_)_****_ a Singapore case.

40 In that case, the appellants who were daily rated unskilled employees of
the respondent council, had been dismissed without due notice for refusing to
obey an order given to them by a _serang_ (headman) on behalf of the
respondents. Before their dismissal, an inquiry into the incident was held by
an officer of the respondents. The appellants appealed against their dismissal
to a sub-committee of the establishments committee of the respondents which
dismissed their appeal.

41 Following this, the appellants sought a declaration that their dismissal
had been wrongful and that they were still in the employ of the respondents.

42 At the trial, the appellants had put in evidence, with consent, some of the
rules formulated by the respondents with regard to the recruitment, engagement
and discipline of the staff. The appellants contended first, that the rules
were expressly or by implication part of the terms of employment, or that they
were so made by the operation of statute or some statutory instrument having
the like effect. Alternatively they contended that they were entitled to the
benefit of the statutory instrument and entitled to sue for its breach.
Secondly, upon the construction of the rules, before they were dismissed they
were entitled to an inquiry to which the rules of natural justice applied.
Thirdly, that these rules of natural justice had not been observed.

43 The plaintiff’s case was dismissed by the High Court as well as by the
Federal Court. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Privy Council.

44 In dismissing the plaintiff’s appeal, the Privy Council held at page 16:

> > (1) _the appellants must rely on the rules to establish their case. On the
> evidence the rules were not expressly or by implication incorporated into
> their contracts of service. The onus of establishing that the rules, being
> made under and by virtue of section 17 of the Municipal Ordinance, had
> statutory force and that they were entitled at law to their benefit, lay
> upon the appellants but they had not discharged that onus_. Accordingly the
> appellants failed to establish a ground upon which they could pray in aid
> the relevant provisions of the rules to support their case that the
> principles of natural justice applied before they could be validly
> dismissed; [Emphasis added.]

45 Lord Upjohn in affirming the decision of the courts below, commented at
page 20:

> > The matter stands thus. Assuming that contrary to their Lordships’ opinion
> the appellants can rely upon the rules either as part of the contract of
> employment or as a statutory instrument on which they are entitled to rely
> how far does this assist them?

__

Their Lordships have already pointed out that the relationship of master and
servant or employer and employee gives rise to no application of the principle
of audi alteram partem on dismissal. _Therefore the court, in construing the
rules (for it is purely a matter of construction) must consider in the first
place whether those rules were introduced to give rights to the employee or
only to provide a scheme or code for the general administration by the staff
of the respondent council and their officers and to provide guidance for the
heads of departments_. Even the second construction would no doubt provide
substantial protection for the employees in the security of their employment
particularly against possibly petty-minded immediate superiors who might
otherwise take an ill advised and presumptuous course to discipline or even
dismiss their immediate inferiors, but would not necessarily give them any
rights under the rules. [Emphasis added]

46 This brings me to the Singapore Court of Appeal decision in _**Lim Tow
Peng**_ (_supra_). The facts in this case are as follows.

47 The appellants were informed that their services had been terminated after
due investigation into their misconduct. In fact no enquiry was made on the
appellants of any alleged misconduct on their part; nor were they told of the
nature of any alleged misconduct on their part. They were not given any
opportunity to be heard concerning any alleged misconduct on their part. The
appellants claimed a declaration that their purported dismissal by the
respondents was inoperative, null and void and alternatively for damages. At
the trial it was conceded that the dismissal of the appellants was wrongful
and that the respondents were liable to pay such damages as the court may
assess. The learned trial judge held that the appellants were entitled to
damages but declined to make the declaratory order sought by the appellants.
The appellants appealed.

48 In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held:

> > (1) the provisions of section 14 of the Employment Act are not mandatory.
> An employer is not obliged to comply with section 14 but if he disregards
> section 14 and dismisses an employee without an enquiry, as in this case,
> the dismissal can be enquired into and reinstatement with full pay ordered
> by the Minister. But no other right is given by section 14. The effect of
> the section is that a dismissal without notice before due enquiry is
> wrongful and not that it is ineffective or null and void.

49 In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Choor Singh J said at
page 257:

> > The appellants’ case was based mainly on the provisions of section 14 of
> the Employment Act. Put shortly, it was this: that the respondents having
> failed to comply with section 14, their breach of that section entitled the
> appellants to a Declaratory Order on the authority of _Vine’s_ case.
>>

>> Section 14 in its present form came into effect on September 1, 1973 and it
is quite obviously based, to some extent, on the "unfair dismissal" provisions
of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 of England, which has placed a statutory
limitation on the employer’s common law right to dismiss, whether by notice or
for cause, which limitation has been described as the right of an employee to
object to an "unfair dismissal." The provisions of the Industrial Relations
Act 1971 are much more comprehensive than Part II of our Employment Act and it
is unnecessary to consider them save to point out that even under that Act, an
employee who considers that he has been unfairly dismissed has no right to go
to court and ask for reinstatement but may present a complaint to an
industrial tribunal. If the tribunal finds that the complaint is well founded
and considers that it would be practicable and in accordance with equity for
the complainant to be re-engaged by the employer, the tribunal may make a
recommendation to that effect, stating the terms on which it considers that it
would be reasonable for the complainant to be so engaged. Otherwise, if it
thinks the claim well founded but does not make such a recommendation, or if
the recommendation so made is not complied with, the tribunal makes an award
of compensation. (Section 106 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971).

>>

>> It will be seen that the refusal of the ordinary courts under the common
law specifically to enforce a contract of employment where the employment has
been wrongfully terminated has been dealt with in England by the legislature
in the remedies available for unfair dismissal under the Industrial Relations
Act, 1971. And this refusal has also been dealt with by our legislature in the
remedies now available in Singapore for unfair dismissal from employment under
section 14 of the Employment Act. Under section 14, an employee who considers
that he has been unfairly dismissed, may present a complaint to the Minister
who has the power to direct the employer to reinstate the employee in his
former employment. The section gives a dissatisfied employee the right to
complain to the Minister. It is a right to object to an unfair dismissal. The
section does not give him any other right. It does not confer on an employee
any status. It does, of course, indirectly restrict the employer’s right to
dismiss in that the dismissal can be enquired into and overruled by the
Minister if a complaint is made to him. And it gives the Minister, not the
courts, the power to order reinstatement of the employee. In our judgment the
provisions of section 14 are not mandatory. An employer is not obliged to
comply with section 14 but if he disregards section 14 and dismisses an
employee without an enquiry, as in this case, the dismissal can be enquired
into and reinstatement with full pay ordered by the Minister whose decision
cannot be challenged in any court. The effect of section 14 is that a
dismissal without notice before due enquiry is wrongful and not that it is
ineffective or null and void.

50 The principles that can be gathered from the foregoing cases are these:
Firstly, there cannot be any specific performance of a contract of service; an
employer can terminate the contract with his servant at any time for any
reason or for none but if he does in a manner not warranted by the contract he
must pay damages for the breach of contract (see Lord Reid’s speech in
_**Ridge v Baldwin**_ at page 65, _supra_); secondly, the onus would be on the
claimant to establish that the relevant rules support his case that the
principles of natural justice applied before he could be validly dismissed
(see _**Vasudevan Pillai**_ – headnote held No. 1 and the comments of Lord
Upjohn at page 19, _supra_); and thirdly if an employer were to dismiss an
employee in breach of s 14 of the employment, only the Minister has the power
to reinstate the employee in his former employment; and the effect of the said
s 14 is that a dismissal without notice before enquiry is wrongful and not
that it is ineffective or null and void (see _**Lim Tow Peng**_ – per Choor
Singh J at page 257, _supra_).

51 I must also mention at this stage that the principles articulated by Lord
Reid in _**Ridge v Baldwin**_ came up for consideration before the House of
Lords in _**Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation**_ [1971] 1 WLR 1578 (the appeal
committee comprising Lord Reid, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest, Lord Guest, Lord
Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale). In that case, a Scottish teacher
whose terms of employment were set out mainly in statute, appealed to the
House of Lords against the decision of the education committee dismissing him
without a hearing. In allowing his appeal, Lord Wilberforce in his speech at
page 1597B-E observed:

> _**
>
> **_In _Ridge_ v. _Baldwin_ my noble and learned friend, Lord Reid, said
> [1964] A.C. 40, 65: "It has always been held, I think rightly, that such an
> officer" (sc. one holding at pleasure) "has no right to be heard before
> being dismissed." As a general principle, I respectfully agree: and I think
> it is important not to weaken a principle which, for reasons of public
> policy, applies, at least as a starting point, to so wide a range of the
> public service. The difficulty arises when, as here, there are other
> incidents of the employment laid down by statute, or regulations, or code of

> necessary implication, and how far these extend. The present case is, in my
> opinion, just such a case where there are strong indications that a right to
> be heard, in appropriate circumstances, should not be denied.

52 Further, it seems that at present, the common law, moving in step with the
statutory unfair dismissal jurisdiction and modern ideas of personnel
management, has indicated a somewhat wider scope to the need for an unbiased
hearing. In **_Stevenson_ _v_ _United Road Transport Union_ **[1977] 2 All ER
941 (CA), the plaintiff, a full-time employee of the defendant trade union,
was dismissed by its executive after disciplinary proceedings. His claim that
his dismissal was invalid because he was not given an adequate opportunity to
defend himself, was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Buckley LJ reformulated the
principle after a full review of the authorities, in the following terms, at
pages 948 and 949:

> Counsel for the union has contended that the principles applicable here are
> those applicable to the dismissal of a servant by his master, where, as Lord
> Reid pointed out in _Ridge v Baldwin_ , the master is under no obligation to
> hear the servant in his own defence (and see _Malloch v Aberdeen Corpn_ ,
> per Lord Reid). Counsel for the union contends that there is no circumstance
> in this case which elevates the plaintiff’s position to that of an officer
> whose tenure of his office or whose status as an officer cannot be
> terminated without his being given an opportunity to answer any charges made
> against him or any criticisms of him or of his conduct. In our opinion, it
> does not much help to solve the problem to try to place the plaintiff in the
> category of a servant, on the one hand, or of an officer, on the other. It
> is true that in _Ridge v Baldwin_ Lord Reid divided cases of dismissal into
> three classes: (1) dismissal of a servant by his master; (2) dismissal from
> an office held during pleasure, and (3) dismissal from an office when there
> must be something against a man to warrant his dismissal; but he goes _on in
> the next paragraph to point out that, although in ‘a pure master and servant
> case’ the master need not hear the servant in his own defence, dismissal of
> a servant by a master can resemble dismissal from an office where the body
> employing the man is under some statutory or other restriction as to the
> grounds on which it can dismiss its servants._ Moreover, the problem is not
> confined to termination of contracts of employment. It may arise in relation
> to the termination or denial of a privilege, as in _Russell v Duke of
> Norfolk_ , or of an office which does not involve any contract of

> after the other party has been given a fair opportunity of being heard or of
> giving his explanation or putting his case, the power will not have been
> well exercised. [Emphasis added]

53 Reverting to the appeal at hand, the issue that is to be decided in the
main trial of the present case would be, whether it was the defendants who had
committed a breach of their contract of employment as is being alleged by the
plaintiff or it was the plaintiff who had broken his terms of employment as is
being claimed by the defendants in their letter of dismissal dated 5 March
1977. The plaintiff’s averments in his various affidavits and pleadings
suggest that he had not breached any of the terms of his employment, his
employers knew the reasons for his absence from work and had they given him a
hearing – which he maintains ought to have given him under the provisions of
the personnel procedure manual that forms part of his contract of service – he
would have proven to them that his absence was not unauthorized, not improper
and not in breach of his terms of employment.

54 In my view, a judicial evaluation of the contestants’ mutual obligations
and breaches could not be satisfactorily undertaken by the court at the main
trial without considering whether in the first instance there was an
obligation on the part of the defendants to provide the plaintiff a hearing –
since this aspect would most certainly have a bearing on the relief to be
granted. Conversely, the allegation of the defendants that it was the
plaintiff who had broken his terms of employment could not be adjudged without
the court enquiring into whether the plaintiff was given the opportunity to
explain his absence. Given this backdrop, the application by the defendants
for the determination of the first question to the court below was found by me
to be premature, since it neither purports to dispose of the entire cause or
matter nor does it fully determine – I emphasize the word ‘fully’ \- even a
single issue as envisaged under O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court (see _**Payna
Chettiar v Maimoon bte Ismail & Ors**_ [1997] 3 SLR 387 at 397).

55 Having reviewed all the authorities, and considered all the arguments, I am
of the view that the question whether the principles of natural justice apply
to the plaintiff’s contract of employment, would depend upon the question
whether the provisions in the personnel procedure manual applied to the
plaintiff’s contract of employment. These inter-linked questions could not be
disposed of without regard to the attendant facts and in my view, ought to be
decided at the trial of the action in the context of available evidence.
However, in relation to the second question submitted to the court below, ie,
whether any relief for reinstatement may be claimed by the plaintiff, the law
in this regard seems to have been conclusively settled by the Singapore Court
of Appeal in _**Lim Tow Peng**_ ,_****_ that power to reinstate a dismissed
employee resides only with the Minister under s 14 of the Employment Act. As
regards ancillary prayer (3), the relief as to loss of salary, this matter
also, in my view cannot be disposed of summarily without hearing evidence.

56 For the reasons I have given, I allowed the plaintiff’s appeal and ordered:

> > (a) That the first question be determined by the trial judge at the
> hearing of the case and consequently the order below to strike out prayer
> 11(1) be set aside;
>>

>> (b) The order by the court below as regards prayer 11(2) to remain, without
prejudice to whatever reliefs the trial court may order under prayer 11(7) of
the statement of claim;

>>

>> (c) The order by the court below to strike out prayer 11(3) is set aside;
and

>>

>> (d) The costs of this appeal and costs below be costs in the cause.

> Order accordingly
