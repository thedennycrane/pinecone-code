Civil Procedure – Vacation of trial dates – Relevance of pending appeal from
interlocutory application for security for costs – Whether to vacate trial
dates pending outcome of such appeal  
  

: This was an urgent appeal by the plaintiffs against the directions made by
the Registrar at a pre-trial conference (`PTC`) held on 12 September 2001, the
day before this appeal.  
  
**_Registrar`s directions_**

****

  
  
The Registrar made the following directions:

(1) Leave be granted for affidavits of evidence-in-chief to be exchanged on or
before 19 September 2001. Objections to the said affidavits to be taken and
the plaintiffs to set down the action for trial on or before 26 September
2001.

(2) The action be fixed for trial from 1 to 12 October 2001.

(3) For failure to comply with any direction given herein, the action be
dismissed with judgment for the defendants in the counterclaim with costs or
the defence be struck out and the counterclaim be dismissed with judgment for
the plaintiffs with costs.

  
  
Essentially, the plaintiffs in this appeal were seeking an order that the
above trial dates be vacated in the circumstances stated below.  
  
**_Chronology of events_**

Counsel for the defendants prepared a very helpful synopsis of the salient
events in these proceedings and I reproduce it below:

This action concerned construction work at a project called Hilltops
Apartments. The plaintiffs were the main contractors and the defendants were
their sub-contractors for that project. The defendants` counterclaim is in
respect of a project at the Sinsov Building where they were again the
plaintiffs` sub-contractors.  
  
The plaintiffs` application for security for costs was in respect of the
defendants` counterclaim and was made pursuant to s 388 of the Companies Act
or, in the alternative, under O 23 r 1 of the Rules of Court, principally on
the ground that the defendants were in financial straits. There is a pending
petition to wind up the defendants (CWU 174/99).  
  
Security for costs at $50,000 was ordered against the defendants by the
assistant registrar.  
  
On 29 August 2001, Judith Prakash J allowed the defendants` appeal against the
assistant registrar`s decision on security for costs. On 11 September 2001
(two days before the present appeal), the plaintiffs lodged an appeal against
the judge`s decision and have instructed Mr Michael Hwang, SC as counsel for
the hearing before the Court of Appeal. I was told that the plaintiffs would
be seeking to proceed by way of expedited appeal pursuant to O 57 r 20.  
  
The plaintiffs submitted that since the defendants had admitted that they were
in no position to put up security for costs, it was obvious that should any
costs be ordered against the defendants in the counterclaim, those costs would
not be paid. The plaintiffs accepted that an appeal to the Court of Appeal did
not operate as a stay of proceedings but argued that they were not seeking
such a stay but were merely asking the court to exercise its discretion in the
interests of justice so as not to render their appeal on security for costs
nugatory ( **Wilson v Church (No 2)** [1879] 12 Ch D 454). They submitted that
the trial should therefore not proceed pending the outcome of their appeal.  
  
Although the plaintiffs only took out the application for security for costs
some 15 months after the filing of the counterclaim, they argued there was no
inordinate delay and that, in any event, there were numerous interlocutory
applications during the first half of 2001. The plaintiffs had also asked for
further and better particulars on 23 October 2000 but no response was made by
the defendants until 9 March 2001 and that was to refuse to furnish the
particulars sought. When particulars were finally furnished by consent in May
2001, it was then that the plaintiffs were able to say that the counterclaim
was not a strong one.  
  
Further, the plaintiffs argued, they would suffer grave prejudice as the
action concerned a complex construction matter in which the plaintiffs would
be calling 11 witnesses including an expert and the costs for the ten-day
trial would be in the region of $120,000, with about eight days to be taken up
by the defendants` counterclaim. In contrast, the defendants were calling only
one witness for the entire action. Counsel for the plaintiffs had also
indicated to the Registrar at the PTC that they were ready to exchange
affidavits of evidence-in-chief before 1 October 2001 but the Registrar
stipulated a deadline two weeks earlier. As an alternative, the plaintiffs
suggested that their claim proceed for trial while the defendants`
counterclaim, which was in respect of an unrelated project, be held over until
after the appeal.  
  
Counsel for the defendants reiterated that they were ready with their clients`
affidavit of evidence-in-chief. He informed me that the winding-up petition
against the defendants had been held over for more than two years because the
defendants` creditors supported that course of action pending the defendants`
counterclaim against the plaintiffs. He was agreeable to having the trial
dates pushed back by two weeks but would like all the other directions to
remain.  
  
**_Decision of court_**

****

  
  
I dismissed the plaintiffs` appeal against the Registrar`s directions with
costs fixed at $500 to be paid to the defendants. The plaintiffs have lodged
an appeal against my decision on 25 September 2001.  
  
In **Dickson Trading (S) v Transmarco** [1989] 2 MLJ 408 , the plaintiffs
there applied for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from
disposing of certain shares. Chan Sek Keong JC dismissed the application. The
plaintiffs then applied for an interim injunction pending appeal against the
dismissal, relying on **Erinford Properties v Cheshire County Council** [1974]
Ch 261[1974] 2 All ER 448. The judge distinguished cases concerning
applications for stay of execution of final judgments after full trials from
the application before him which was in effect a stay of an interlocutory
order. In his view, there was a difference in substance and not merely in
degree between the two situations. He was also of the opinion that the
likelihood of an appeal, if successful, being rendered nugatory, was a
sufficient ground for a stay of execution. However, the judge refused the
plaintiffs the limited injunction sought fundamentally because the plaintiffs`
action, if ultimately successful, would not be affected by their failure to
obtain an interlocutory injunction.  
  
The plaintiffs here submitted that while they were not asking for a stay of
execution, the principles set out in the above case could be relied upon to
assist the court in exercising its discretion whether or not to vacate the
trial dates.  
  
I do not disagree with the principles stated but it should be noted that in
cases like **_Dickson Trading_** above, granting the interim relief sought
would still permit the wheels of litigation to roll on. In contrast, the
plaintiffs here were effectively asking that I apply the brakes and park the
action by the wayside (or at least the counterclaim) until such time as the
brakes were released by the Court of Appeal. This I was not willing to do in
the circumstances of this case.  
  
The plaintiffs only took out their application for security for costs some 15
months after the filing of the defendants` counterclaim. If one reckoned the
time from the filing of the amended defence and counterclaim on 25 April 2000,
it would still be 14 months. Even if they were justified in not doing so until
after further and better particulars had been provided by the defendants, they
had nevertheless taken some six months from the filing of the amended defence
and counterclaim to ask for particulars. Further, they ought to have known, at
the time they commenced this action on 1 February 2000 or at least soon
thereafter, that the defendants were the subject of a winding-up petition.
They were therefore responsible for at least a six-month delay.  
  
In addition, their application for security for costs has already been
considered by a High Court judge and such an application involved an exercise
of discretion. There are other interlocutory applications the outcome of which
could affect the trial process itself; for instance, an application to make
substantial amendments to a claim or an application to call additional
evidence at the trial. Such applications, decided one way or the other, could
be said to prejudice one of the parties to the proceedings. Yet, in such cases
impinging on the trial process itself, it would be highly unlikely that the
court would either vacate the trial dates or stop the trial at that stage in
order to await the outcome of an appeal. Here, any prejudice to the plaintiffs
would only arise if the defendants` counterclaim was dismissed with costs. The
trial process would not be affected at all. The litigation process would
become most unsatisfactory if all such interlocutory applications must first
receive the attention of the highest court in our system of justice before the
next step could be taken.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
