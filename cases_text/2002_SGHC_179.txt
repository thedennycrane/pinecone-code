**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_ _Cur Adv Vult_**

1\. This was a petition by MRI Worldwide Ltd to wind up the respondent
company, Management Recruiters International (Asia) Pte Ltd under s 254(2)(a)
of the Companies Act, Ch 50. The basis of the petition was that the company is
insolvent and unable to pay its debts amounting to 62,366.32.

> > > > 2\. The petitioner is an international management recruitment company
> that sells franchises of its name and operations to franchisees all over the
> world. The respondent is one such franchisee, having signed two franchise
> agreements, namely, the Singapore Franchise Agreement and the Malaysia
> Franchise Agreement. The respondent also signed two other agreements known
> as the International Master Franchise Agreement and the Umbrella Agreement
> with the petitioner. By these agreements, the respondent was permitted to
> grant sub-franchises to other parties upon payment of requisite royalty fees
> and commissions to the petitioner. The fee and commission structures are not
> important for the proceedings before me. The contractual obligations that
> are relevant are the terms requiring the respondent to report monthly sales
> and gross revenues, and to pay promptly all fees due.

3\. On 10 May 2002 the petitioner terminated all the agreements it signed with
the respondent on the ground of "persistent defaults". The main ones being the
failure to pay royalties and not reporting of payments received from the sub-
franchisees as required under the agreements. Prior to that, on 14 December
2001, the parties agreed on a schedule for the payment of monies due from the
respondent to the petitioner. The matter was not resolved satisfactorily and
fresh negotiation began on 29 January 2002. More correspondence followed. Even
after the agreements were terminated the parties were still writing to each
other. The more significant letters were two letters dated 17 May 2002, one
from the respondent to the petitioner and the other a reply by the latter to
the former; as well as a letter from the respondent's solicitors to the
petitioner dated 28 May 2002.

4\. Mrs. Teh, counsel for the petitioner submitted that the respondent owes a
debt of 62,366.32, but even if the exact amount is disputed, there is no
dispute that there is a debt owed which exceeds the statutory amount of
$10,000 entitling the petitioner to petition for a winding up order against
the respondent. The respondent challenges the petition on three grounds. The
first of these grounds is that the petition was founded on an assertion of a
debt referred to in "_without prejudice_ " correspondence. Secondly, Mr.
Pillay, counsel for the respondent, submitted that the petitioner attempted
correct the defect by filing an affidavit in which the deponent Mr. Steven
Mills referred to other correspondence and other amounts of purported debt.
Thirdly, counsel submitted that the debt is disputed.

5\. The petition was based on s 254(1)(e) and s 254(2)(a) of the Companies
Act, Ch 50. Section 254(1) provides: "The Court may order the winding up if -
(e) the company is unable to pay its debts". Section 254(2) provides:

> "A company shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts if - (a) a creditor
> by assignment or otherwise to whom the company is indebted in a sum
> exceeding $10,000 then due has served on the company by leaving at his
> registered office a demand under his hand or under the hand of his agent
> thereunto lawfully authorised requiring the company to pay the sum so due,
> and the company for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure
> or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor".

The relevant part of 5 of the petition states that "[the respondent] is
indebted to [the] petitioner in the sum of at least 62,366.32". The
particulars of this debt was set out in a letter dated 12 June 2002 from the
petitioner's solicitors to the respondent in which the sum of 62,366.32 was
referred to in these terms:

> "In any event, our clients note that you have taken the position that you
> presently owe them the sum of 62,366.32 in royalty payments due to them
> under the said contracts. This is contained in your calculations stated in
> your letter to our clients, dated 17 May 2002. In the letter from your
> solicitors, Wong Partnership, dated 28 May 2002, you have further agreed
> that you will make such payments that are required".

6\. The letter of 17 May 2002 relied upon was indeed marked "_without
prejudice_ " as Mr. Pillay said, but Mrs. Teh argued that nonetheless, the
statement of admission was a categorical admission of a debt for 62,366.32.
She referred to the authority of Lord Griffith in _Rush & Tomkins Ltd v
Greater London Council_ [1988] 3 All ER 737, 740 in who held that: "There is
also authority for the proposition that the admission of an "independent fact"
in no way connected with the merits of the case is admissible even if made in
the course of negotiations for a settlement". Lord Griffith gave as an
example, the admission that the document was in the handwriting of one of the
parties, as was the case in _Waldridge v Kennison_ (1794) 1 Esp 143. But, more
importantly, he qualified his statement by saying that he regards this as "an
exceptional case and it should not be allowed to whittle down the protection
given to the parties to speak freely on all the issues in the litigation both
factual and legal when seeking compromise". The letter of 17 May when read in
full shows exactly what it was - an attempt to speak freely on the dispute
between the parties. I would not extract a short sentence from the lengthy
letter and regard it as an "independent fact". It forms an integral part of
the negotiation. So far as the letter of 28 May is concerned, it has no direct
reference to any specific debt and was a letter written by solicitors
regarding the choice of forum and interim positions. In my view, therefore,
there is no basis in the petition upon which I can safely act on in finding a
debt which the respondent was unable to pay. On this ground alone I would
dismiss the petition.

7\. I proceed to Mr. Pillay's second point, namely, that the affidavit of Mr.
Mills should not be given any force. It is well accepted that affidavits are
not pleadings. The deponent may make all manner of statements and even if they
are serious and important, they would have been made in vain because the court
will have no regard for them however well made they may be unless they are
relevant. Relevancy is a relative term. It must relate to the primary action
and that can only be the original cause papers, be it the statement of claim
of a winding up petition. In this regard, I accept Mr. Pillay’s submission
that the affidavit of Mr. Mills had ventured well beyond the focal point of 5
of the petition. As such, little weight, if any, is to be given to it.

8\. Lastly, in respect of the issue as to whether there is a disputable debt,
I shall preface my decision with a statement of settled law that a judge
sitting in a companies' winding up court is not well placed to adjudicate on
the merits of a commercial dispute. The debt on which the petition is founded
must be unambiguous and obviously above the statutory sum. Mrs. Teh relied
substantially and repeatedly on the judgment of LP Thean J in _Re People's
Park Development Pte Ltd_ [1992] 1 SLR 413, 416 for the proposition that the
petitioner had a right to present the petition if the court found as a fact
that _some_ amount was owing by the company. So too, in _Re Claybridge
Shipping Co SA_ [1996] 1 BC LC 572, 575 Lord Denning held that "a person is a
'creditor' so long as he has a good arguable case that a debt of sufficient
amount is owing to him. In the Companies Court it appears that a rule of
practice has been adopted to the effect that the debt should be undisputed. I
do not think that is correct. It certainly is not so in regard to the amount
of the debt." The same point was emphasized by Plowman J in _Re Tweed Garages
Ltd_ [1962] Ch 406. These cases, however, merely cautioned against accepting a
mere assertion that the debt is disputed. In that regard, the principle is
clear and sensible. What it all means is that the court must be satisfied that
the dispute of debt is genuine and plausible. In some cases, it may be plain
that although the debt is disputed generally, there is an undisputed amount
that exceeds $10,000, but where it is not so obvious, the court ought to
dismiss the petition. In the present proceedings, if the 'without prejudice'
correspondence is admitted (on which I have made my point above) it would
appear that some debt may be due, but the amount is still questionable without
a full inquiry or trial. Moreover, in this case, the company alleges that it
has a counterclaim based on a wrongful termination of contract as well as
damages for defamation. The dispute over the termination of contract was
based, among others, on the determination of the term 'persistent breaches' of
the agreements. The libel issue came about because the petitioner had sent out
various letters to various third parties alleging that the company was guilty
of "systematic under reporting of cash-in" and other comments including, "We
are concerned that there may be fiscal irregularities which could be doing
damage to our brand and possibly a criminal offence". Whether the allegations
and fears are true, the consequence is plainly serious, with the possibility
of substantial damages either way. Mr. Pillay had sufficiently drawn my
attention to evidence that indicates that, at the very least, a genuine fight
between the parties is at hand. But, as I have said, the winding up court is
not the appropriate arena. I end with the reminder that a winding up order is
the death knell for a legal entity. It should only be rung in the clearest
circumstances.

9\. In some cases the court may exercise its discretion and stay the winding
up proceedings pending the resolution of the dispute. That would be so where
there is already pending litigation in the courts or by way of arbitration.
However, in this case, I have determined that the petition itself was bad in
that it had recited a debt based upon an inadmissible document, and there
being nothing else to support the petition, I would in this case dismiss the
petition rather than have it stayed.

10\. Whether costs should be on a standard or indemnity basis is a slightly
more difficult question in this case. Mr. Pillay submitted that the company
ought to be awarded costs on an indemnity basis on the ground that the
petition was commenced unnecessarily and was founded on an inadmissible
document. Furthermore, he submitted, the alleged debt was disputed on
legitimate grounds. If it were based on a straightforward reliance on an
inadmissible document I might have leaned in favour of awarding indemnity
costs. In this case, it seems to me that the petitioner took the view that
there was an undisputed debt notwithstanding the reliance in question. Whether
it was reasonable or not for it to have done so is, in my view, too fine a
distinction to draw in the circumstances. I, therefore, hesitate to make an
order of costs on an indemnity basis.

11\. For the above reasons, the petition is dismissed with costs to be taxed
on the standard basis, if not agreed.
