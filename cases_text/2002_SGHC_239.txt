**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_ **_Cur Adv Vult_

1 The Plaintiffs are a company in the business of trading and importing goods.
At all material times they were the sole distributors in Singapore for
Bionaire air circulators ("Bionaire fans"). An air circulator is a high
velocity fan that is capable of moving a large volume of air. The Bionaire
fans are manufactured by Bionaire International BV, a Dutch company. The
Defendants are a company in the business of marketing and trading.

2 Sometime in June 1998 BIBV received an inquiry from a company in Singapore
concerning agency rights for the Bionaire fans. In accordance with their
practice on such matters, BIBV passed it to the Plaintiffs in Singapore for
them to handle. The Plaintiffs’ General Manager, Chong Ann Sin ("Chong"),
contacted Witzan Tirtazana ("Witzan"), the Defendants’ director. Witzan, an
Indonesian businessman, told Chong that he was interested in selling the
Bionaire fans in Singapore and Indonesia. Chong told him that the Plaintiffs
were the sole distributors of the products in Singapore only. Chong and Witzan
began negotiations on the terms of a sole agency agreement ("the Agreement")
for the Singapore market.

3 As Witzan did not have a corporate vehicle in Singapore to undertake the
business, he invited his friend, Richard Tay Chor Teng ("Tay"), to be his
partner in the venture. They agreed to share equally in the costs and profits.
They agreed to use the Defendants, a company owned by Tay, as the contracting
party with the Plaintiffs. The parties eventually agreed upon the terms of the
Agreement and it was signed on 15 July 1998. Two days later, on 17 July 1998
the Defendants placed on order for 320 units of Bionaire fans and paid a
deposit of $15,000 to the Plaintiffs. The shipment arrived on 21 August 1998
and the Defendants then paid the balance sum of $16,971.

4 The Bionaire fans could not be sold immediately because the Plaintiffs had
not managed to obtain approval from the Productivity and Standards Board
("PSB") for the product to be sold in Singapore, a requirement under the law
for such electrical products. Unfortunately for the parties, the PSB approval
was not forthcoming over the next few months despite frantic efforts on the
part of the Plaintiffs and the increasingly desperate entreaties on the part
of the Defendants. The Plaintiffs had initially thought that PSB approval for
the Bionaire fan could easily be obtained on the strength of a certificate
issued by TUV, a European testing body. However it was only after they had
made the application to PSB and after several rounds of correspondence and
clarifications that they discovered that the European TUV certification was
not recognised by PSB. But by then there was already a considerable delay. In
the end the Plaintiffs decided to obtain certification by submitting the
Bionaire fan for testing in Singapore, a process that took several more
months. It was not until 31 December 1998 that the PSB approval was finally
obtained.

5 Meanwhile the Defendants were getting desperate as their investment was
literally locked up in the warehouse. They were keen to recoup their capital
in this venture which they thought would have turned a quick profit. Witzan
said that he was incurring interest in excess of 20% on the Indonesian Rupiah
at the time. They began selling the Bionaire fans even before the PSB approval
was obtained. This was the cause of considerable dispute between them and the
Plaintiffs and things came to a head when on 22 October 1998 Tay, on the
Defendants’ behalf, wrote a most remarkable letter to the Plaintiffs’
principal, BIBV.

6 The letter began by asking whether the Agreement, a copy of which was
attached, was "recognised" by BIBV. It continued by saying that at the time
they were appointed as authorised agent in July, the Defendants had indicated
to the Plaintiffs their interest to expand to the regional markets. Tay then
accused Chong of making "connections" with those territories without the
Defendants’ knowledge. The letter then complained about the manner in which
Chong had handled the affair in the following manner:

> > We had placed a container of 320 units in July 98 … and to-date we have
> not heard from … Chong regarding [the PSB approval]. As you may or may not
> have known, such approvals are mandatory … and the penalty in terms of fine
> is severe. It has been more than 3 months since July that the attached
> document dated 21 October 1998 was then finally put forth to PSB … for
> application. We must bring to your attention that we have attempted empteen
> [sic] times to send our reminders and even plead with him to expedite the
> matter, however to our astonishment we were ever told to even stop selling
> the product. No official reply was received from him on letters sent … We
> have always the intention to continue to indent more containers as we are
> very confident of the upmarket product and your esteemed Company but this is
> subjected to [PSB’s] acknowledgement and approval.
>>

>> On this note, we have to inform you that the heavy cost incurred in
printing of the product brochures and warrantee cards was borne by us and no
support was given whatsoever by [the Plaintiffs]. Right now, we are stuck with
about 200 units of the Bionaire fan in the warehouse which we are unable to
sell and yet we are accountable for the daily expenses accrued. A few of the
big orders placed has to be cancelled and those established organisations who
have expressed their interest, questioned our safety features in which we are
not confident to handle and ultimately led to the lost of sales.

7 The sales manager of BIBV, Johannes Van Lent ("Lent") telephoned Chong and
told him about Tay’s letter. He faxed a copy to Chong on 27 October and
requested him to deal with the matter. Chong was livid. This is what he said
in his affidavit evidence in chief:

> > 50\. I was disgusted and embarrassed by what the Defendants had done and
> told Hans that I would look into the matter and ask the Defendants to
> explain their conduct. …
>>

>> 51\. The Defendants' Richard Tay in his fax dated 22/10/98 to the Principal
attached the Agreement dated 15/7/98, that Winston and I had signed and had
the nerve to ask if the 'contract was recognised' by the Principal !! The
Defendants in their fax to the Principals were going behind the Plaintiffs’
back to question the Plaintiffs' capacity to sign the contract. They clearly
undermined the Plaintiffs' position and showed a lack of good faith and trust.

>>

>> 52\. Richard Tay further accused me of making connections with Asian
regional markets without the Defendants' knowledge in an effort to prevent or
hinder the Defendants' business. In the first place the Plaintiffs were only
appointed by the Principals in the territory of Singapore. The Principal had
appointed other Companies as their sole distributors in the other regional
territories. Richard's vague accusation that I made ' connections with ' other
territories is also false and made purely to discredit the Plaintiffs and me.
In any event neither the Plaintiffs nor I were restricted in any way by the
Agreement from doing business outside of Singapore and certainly were not
obliged to inform the Defendants of their business activities. Richard Tay in
making such an allegation was suggesting that the Plaintiffs or I were
unethical or dishonest in doing business.

>>

>> 53\. Richard Tay then went on to try and impress the Principal with his
knowledge of the product and enclosed the letters dated 14/9/98 and 23/9/98 he
had sent to the Plaintiffs regarding the products.

8 Chong said he telephoned Witzan and told him that such behaviour was
completely unacceptable, i.e. writing behind the Plaintiffs' back and making
untrue allegations about the Plaintiffs. He asked for a written explanation
for their conduct to be sent to the Plaintiffs immediately. Chong said that he
called Witzan again on 29 October and reminded him about the written
explanation. Witzan does not deny that Chong called him about this. He said he
asked Chong to take up the matter with Tay. However Tay seemed to have
forgotten about this completely. This was the exchange in his cross-
examination:

> > Q: After this letter was sent, did you receive any phone call from Chong?
>>

>> A: No.

>>

>> Q: Did you receive a call from Witzan telling you that Chong had called him
over this letter?

>>

>> A: Cannot remember.

>>

>> Q: Did Witzan tell you that Chong wanted a written explanation for the
letter?

>>

>> A: Cannot remember.

>>

>> Q: Witzan said that Chong called him after this letter and that he asked
you to handle the matter.

>>

>> A: Cannot remember.

>>

>> Q: Did Witzan ask you why you had sent this letter to BIBV?

>>

>> A: No. We had no discussion on that. He left the day-to-day running to me.

The last answer seems to suggest a rather laid-back attitude by Witzan over
this matter.

9 By 11 November 1998, having received no response from Witzan or Tay, Chong
sent a letter to terminate the contract, invoking clause 12 of the Agreement
which provides as follows:

> > [The Plaintiffs] reserve the right to terminate the appointment of [the
> Defendants] if [the Defendants’] performance in productivity or conduct is
> deemed to be unsatisfactory by [the Plaintiffs].

Chong said that both sides had clearly understood that it was essential to the
Agreement that the Plaintiffs have a high level of trust and confidence in the
Defendants. By writing the letter of 22 October to BIBV, the Defendants had
acted in bad faith and destroyed the whole basis of the Agreement.

10 The Defendants' case is that Chong had promised them at the outset that the
PSB approval would be obtained by the time the first shipment arrived. They
claimed that they had emphasised to Chong during the negotiations that it was
essential to have the PSB approval in order to sell the Bionaire fans and that
Chong had assured them that the approval would be obtained by the time the
goods arrived. When it was not, and the delay lengthened, they grew
increasingly desperate. When Chong seemed to make no headway with the PSB
approval they felt that it was reasonable to go directly to BIBV. They alleged
that Chong’s termination was made in bad faith, done in order to cover up the
fact that he had promised timely delivery of the PSB approval and his
inadequate handling of the matter.

11 The Defendants’ case hinges on their allegation that Chong had promised
them, or represented, that the PSB approval would be obtained by the time the
first shipment arrived. It is a reasonable story as there is no doubt that
Chong was confident about the PSB approval at the time because he was rather
surprised to learn later that the TUV Europe certificate was not acceptable to
PSB. However if this promise was of such importance to the Defendants, they
certainly did not reveal it in any of the contemporary documents. They did not
mention it in any of the letters that they had sent to the Plaintiffs leading
up to the termination. Indeed, they did not even mention this to BIBV in their
22 October letter. While they complained about Chong’s incompetence in
obtaining the approval, they chose to conceal Chong’s promise to them upon
which they had placed such great reliance at the outset.

12 Indeed, even when the Plaintiffs’ former solicitors wrote to the Defendants
on 17 March 1999 to demand for the return of the Bionaire fans, they did not
complain about Chong’s broken promise to obtain PSB approval by the first
shipment. It was not until this action was commenced that this allegation
surfaced.

13 As far as the witnesses are concerned I find Chong to be a reliable witness
in the box whose answers in cross-examination were forthright, reasonable and
logical, and consistent with the documents. On the part of the Defendants,
Witzan’s evidence is not altogether consistent with the surrounding facts,
although he tried to give reasonable answers. He claimed to have left matters
to Tay; yet when the first shipment arrived, it was he who was notified in
Indonesia. Tay on the other hand did not hesitate to give answers that were
completely contradicted by the contemporary documents. For example he said
that Chong had given them the green light to sell the Bionaire fans
notwithstanding that the PSB approval had not been given. Yet in his own
letter to BIBV, the one dated 22 October, he said that Chong had told them to
stop selling the fans. He had said that he knew it was an offence to sell the
fans without the PSB approval and had emphasised this to Chong in order to
pressure the latter to procure the approval as soon as possible. Yet he was
later to sell more than half the fans before PSB approval was obtained. I have
no hesitation in concluding that Tay’s evidence is wholly unreliable.

14 I find as a fact that Chong had not made the alleged promise, and that at
worst he might have exuded confidence at the time about the PSB approval. The
nature of the Defendants’ letter to BIBV is clear. They were not really
interested in merely being the sole agent in Singapore – they were hoping for
bigger things. The tone of the letter clearly suggests that they were taking
the opportunity to undermine the Plaintiffs vis--vis BIBV in the hope that the
latter would give them the distributorship instead. This was what Chong was
upset about and this was the basis upon which he had terminated the Agreement.

15 Accordingly, I find that Chong had terminated the Agreement _bona fide_ and
his reason for doing so are within the contemplation of clause 12. In the
premises the Plaintiffs are entitled, by an implied term of the Agreement, to
the return at cost of the unsold goods remaining in the possession of the
Defendants. The latter had refused to return those goods and had in fact sold
them off for a profit. Accordingly the Defendants are in breach of this
implied term of the Agreement.

16 Further, clause 11 of the Agreement provides that the Defendants shall not
engaged in any business in competition with the Plaintiffs during the term of
the Agreement and for a period of twelve months thereafter. By selling the
Bionaire fans in competition with the Plaintiffs, they have breached this
clause. Indeed the Defendants were putting the fans in the market at a much
lower price than that being charged by the Plaintiffs’ dealers.

17 Accordingly, I order the Defendants to:

> > (1) render an account of the profits made by them in the sale of the fans
> after the Agreement was terminated on 11 November 1998 and to pay the
> Plaintiffs such profits, with interest at the statutory rate from the date
> of this judgment;
>>

>> (2) pay damages for breach of the non-competition clause in the Agreement
in the sum of a token $1 in view of the fact that the Plaintiffs have not
offered any evidence of the damage suffered by them;

>>

>> (3) pay the Plaintiffs’ costs at the standard rate.
