Introduction

1 This was an appeal by the appellant, Jeffery bin Abdullah, against the
sentences imposed on him by the district judge (“the DJ”) for two offences
under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), namely:

(a) joint possession of 0.43g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking
under s 5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) of the MDA and s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap
224, 1985 Rev Ed), which is punishable under s 33 of the MDA; and

(b) possession of 0.41g of diamorphine under s 8(_a_) of the MDA, which is
also punishable under s 33 of the MDA.

The appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment
and seven strokes of the cane for the first offence and 12 months’
imprisonment for the second offence, the sentences to run concurrently (see
_PP v Jeffery Bin Abdullah_ [2008] SGDC 139 (“the GD”)). One other charge was
taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, _viz_ , one charge of
possession of a Class A controlled drug under s 8(_a_) of the MDA, an offence
punishable under s 33 of the MDA.

2 The main thrust of the appellant’s appeal was that the sentence for the
first offence was manifestly excessive as his accomplice, one Sophian bin Abu
Talib (“Sophian”), had received a lower sentence of five years and nine
months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the same offence.

3 After hearing the arguments of both parties, I was of the view that the
sentence imposed on the appellant in relation to the first offence was not
manifestly excessive, even though it was higher than the sentence meted out to
Sophian for the same offence. In any case, I was of the view that since the
total sentence imposed on Sophian for all the offences which he had committed
(arising out of or in relation to the same incident) was six years and ten
months of imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane, there was no basis for
the appellant to complain that his total sentence of seven years’ imprisonment
and seven strokes of the cane was manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I
dismissed the appeal. I now give the reasons for my decision.

The facts

4 On 28 July 2007 at around 2.25am, a party of Central Narcotics Bureau
(“CNB”) officers, with the assistance of the Traffic Police, arrested the
appellant and Sophian, a cargo delivery driver. Prior to the arrest, the
officers had embarked on a four-hour-long vehicle pursuit of the appellant and
Sophian, who were in a motor lorry driven by Sophian. The chase began after
the appellant had purchased packets of heroin at East Coast Road. During the
chase at around 1.10am, while the lorry was travelling along Ayer Rajah
Expressway, the appellant tore open two plastic packets and threw the contents
out of the lorry before throwing the empty packets out as well. Both empty
packets were recovered by CNB officers and seized as exhibits.

5 When the motor lorry ran low on fuel, the appellant and Sophian abandoned it
and fled in different directions. Both men put up a violent struggle before
necessary force was used to arrest them. CNB officers searched the appellant
and recovered a packet containing a granular substance in the sling bag he was
carrying. At about 3.20am, a search of the lorry was conducted in the presence
of the appellant and Sophian. Another packet of granular substance (to which
the appellant admitted ownership) was also recovered behind the passenger seat
of the motor lorry. Both packets were seized as exhibits.

6 The exhibits were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) which issued
certificates confirming that the two packets seized from the appellant’s sling
bag and the passenger seat of the motor lorry contained 0.41g and 0.43g of
diamorphine respectively. The HSA also certified that the two empty packets
were stained with diamorphine. The appellant admitted that he had only
intended to keep one of the packets of diamorphine (the one found in his sling
bag) which he had purchased from the suppliers for his own use while the
remaining packets were meant to be sold at around $310 or $320 per packet.
Therefore, the diamorphine in the packet found in the motor lorry and the two
emptied packets were for the purpose of trafficking.

This court’s decision

**Examination of the appellant’s sentence in isolation**

7 Before considering whether the DJ took into account the principle of parity
in sentencing the appellant and Sophian, I shall first consider whether the
seven years’ custodial sentence imposed on the appellant was manifestly
excessive. The sentencing factors that are generally relevant in relation to
the offence of trafficking are (see _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate
Courts_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at pp 638–639):

(a) the quantity of the drug in the possession of the offender;

(b) the type of drug;

(c) the duration and sophistication in planning and carrying out the offence;
and

(d) the relative levels of participation in relation to the accomplices.

8 The following sentencing precedents for drug trafficking in diamorphine were
also relevant:

**Case** |  **Sentence** |  **Brief facts**  
---|---|---  
_Ong Kee Kwok v  
PP_ Magistrate’s  
Appeal No 498  
of 1992  
(“ _Ong Kee Kwok_ ”) |  7 years’  
imprisonment and  
5 strokes of the cane |  Possession for purpose of trafficking **0.81g** of  
diamorphine. Possession charge taken into  
consideration. Pleaded guilty.  
Had drug antecedents.  
_Rangasamy  
Balasubramaniam v  
PP_ [2000] SGDC 56  
(“ _Rangasamy_ ”) |  7 years’  
imprisonment and  
6 strokes of the cane |  Possession for purpose of trafficking **0.29g** of  
diamorphine. Two charges for failing to report  
for urine tests taken into consideration.  
Pleaded guilty. Had drug antecedents.  
_Sim Kim Yea v PP  
_[1995] SGDC 2 |  8 years’  
imprisonment |  Possession for purpose of trafficking **3.36g** of  
diamorphine. Pleaded guilty. Had been admitted  
to drug rehabilitation centre on five occasions.  
No caning because offender was female.  
_Lur Choo Lai v PP  
_[1992] SGDC 1 |  6 years’  
imprisonment and  
9 strokes of the cane |  Possession for purpose of trafficking **2.45g** of  
diamorphine. Possession charge taken into  
consideration. Pleaded guilty. First offender.  
_Rozie bin Ahmad v PP  
_[2001] SGDC 286 |  7 years’  
imprisonment and  
8 strokes of the cane |  Trafficking by giving **2.88g** of diamorphine.  
Claimed trial. Had drug antecedents.  
  
  
  
9 The precedents outlined above, while not uniform, set a range of sentences
of between six and eight years of imprisonment and between five and eight
strokes of the cane. Comparing the present sentence of seven years’
imprisonment and seven strokes of the cane with these precedents, it could not
be said that the appellant’s sentence was manifestly excessive. While some
offenders, like the accused in _Ong Kee Kwok_ , might have been sentenced to
seven years’ imprisonment for trafficking in higher quantities of diamorphine
(0.81g compared to 0.43g), there were also cases like _Rangasamy_ where the
accused was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment for trafficking in a lower
quantity of diamorphine (0.29g). I also took into account the fact that the
first offence involved not just the 0.43g of diamorphine seized but also
included the two empty packets stained with diamorphine which the appellant
had thrown out of the motor lorry. There certainly was diamorphine in these
two packets before they were emptied out. If each packet contained the same
amount of diamorphine as those recovered by the CNB, the appellant would have
been in possession of more diamorphine than the accused in _Ong Kee Kwok_
(1.29g compared to 0.81g).

10 The appellant pointed out that the offenders in _Ong Kee Kwok_ and
_Rangasamy_ had drug antecedents which warranted the higher sentences imposed
in those cases, while he was a first-time offender. However, I noted that
there were aggravating factors in his case which were not present in _Ong Kee
Kwok_ or _Rangasamy_. One clear example was that the appellant and Sophian had
led the CNB and Traffic Police officers on a four-hour-long vehicle chase, and
had put up a violent struggle thereafter to resist arrest. The appellant was
also more culpable than Sophian in one respect in that he had thrown out the
contents of the two packets during the vehicle chase to avoid being found to
be in unlawful possession of a higher quantity of diamorphine. Therefore, the
fact that his prison sentence was 15 months longer than Sophian’s prison
sentence of five years and nine months was justifiable by his greater
culpability in relation to the joint trafficking offence. This is not a case
of inconsistency in sentencing. Ultimately, the principle that similar
sentences must be imposed for similar offences and offenders is subject to the
principle that each case must depend on its own facts (see _Teo Kian Leong v
PP_ [2002] 1 SLR 147 at [45]).

**The appellant’s sentence in the light of his accomplice’s sentence**

11 The next question is whether the principle of parity in sentencing was
breached in this case and, if so, whether it was justified. In _PP v Ramlee_
[1998] 3 SLR 539, Yong Pung How CJ held that the parity principle should be
applied even though the sentences by themselves were not manifestly excessive.
Yong CJ stated at [7] that:

Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same
offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a
relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal
circumstances: see _Archbold_ (1998), para 5-153. An offender who has received
a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his
accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of
appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in
isolation are not considered manifestly excessive: see _R v Walsh_ (1980) 2 Cr
App R (S) 224. In _R v Fawcett_ (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 158, Lawton LJ held that
the test was whether ‘right-thinking members of the public, with full
knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, learning of this sentence
[would] consider that something had gone wrong with the administration of
justice?’

12 I agree with this statement of principle. However, where the offenders did
not play the same roles in the commission of the crimes and have different
degrees of culpability, the parity principle is not applicable (see _Ong Tiong
Poh v PP_ [1998] 2 SLR 853 at [29]–[30]).

13 In the present case, it is clear that the DJ did direct his mind to the
principle of parity of sentences and decided to impose a higher custodial
sentence on the appellant because he had played a “much greater and important
role” in the commission of the offence than his accomplice (at [10] of the
GD). The DJ’s finding of fact was fully supported by paras 5 and 14 of the
agreed statement of facts, which state as follows:

5 During the chase, … as the said lorry was being chased along the Ayer Rajah
Expressway (AYE), _the_** _accused had torn and disposed_** _of the contents
of two plastic packets out of the lorry window, before the emptied plastic
packets were flung out of the lorry’s window_. The said two packets were
subsequently recovered by SSgt Michael Seet of CNB …

…

14 In the course of investigations, _the_ **_accused admitted_** _that he only
intended to keep one of the_ **_packets of heroin he purchased_** _from the
suppliers for his own consumption_ , and he identified the packet found in the
sling bag (“JA-1”) to be for this purpose. He disclosed that the **_remaining
packets which he purchased, were meant to be sold_** at around $310 or $320
per packet.

[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]

14 This was a case where the DJ had taken into consideration all the relevant
facts and circumstances in sentencing the appellant, who deserved a higher
custodial sentence. For this reason, this court had no basis to interfere with
the sentence imposed by the DJ.

**The one-transaction rule and the totality principle**

15 At this juncture, it is desirable that I articulate a sentencing principle
which, in my view, should apply to a case like the present, where an offender
is charged with a series of offences arising from the same incident, but which
are not regarded as falling within the one-transaction rule. In cases where an
offender is convicted of more than one offence at the same trial, two
sentencing principles may be involved, namely, the one-transaction rule and
the totality principle. The one-transaction rule may be stated shortly: Where
two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all
sentences in respect of these offences should be concurrent rather than
consecutive (see _Kanagasuntharam v PP_ [1992] 1 SLR 81 (“ _Kanagasuntharam_
”) at 83, [5]). As for the totality principle, the Court of Appeal in
_Kanagasuntharam_ adopted (at 84–85, [13]) the explanation of the principle as
stated in D A Thomas, _Principles of Sentencing_ (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) at
pp 57–58 as follows:

[T]he principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality
principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of
sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its
effect is to impose on the offender ‘a crushing sentence’ not in keeping with
his record and prospects.

16 In my view, in cases where an offender is sentenced for several offences
arising out of one incident and he appeals against his sentence, the appeal
court may apply a third principle of punishment. This principle gives effect
to the commonsensical position that, where an offender is convicted of various
offences arising from what is essentially _one incident_ , his overall
sentence should reflect his role and culpability in the incident as a _whole_.
This principle draws from both the one-transaction rule and the totality
principle, as all three principles share the same underlying rationale, _viz_
, proportionality in sentencing. In _PP v Law Aik Meng_ [2007] 2 SLR 814, V K
Rajah J alluded to this principle at [60]:

It is axiomatic that the totality principle, not dissimilarly from its one-
transaction counterpart, functions not as an inflexible rule, but rather as a
helpful guideline to _remind the court that the correlation of the sentence to
the gravity of the offender’s conduct and offences is of critical importance_.
In short, sentences must be _restrained by the principle of proportionality_.
[emphasis added]

The proportionality principle requires that the overall sentence imposed on an
offender should be based on his total culpability in the various offences
committed, when viewed as a whole.

17 In the present case, the total imprisonment term received by the appellant
was seven years. In relation to the same incident, Sophian received a total
imprisonment term of six years and ten months. This was merely two months shy
of the total imprisonment term imposed on the appellant. However, it should be
noted that Sophian received a total of nine strokes of the cane, two more than
the appellant. This would make Sophian’s punishment actually more severe, if
the corporal punishment is accounted for in his total punishment.

18 In relation to his driving of the lorry, Sophian was charged and convicted
under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed), the MDA, and s 336 of the
Penal Code. The appellant did not have to face such a charge, but he had
attempted to get rid of incriminating evidence, which is an offence under s
201 of the Penal Code, and, in fact, took steps to cover up the true amount of
diamorphine that he was actually in illegal possession of. In my view, it was
entirely proper for the DJ to take this factor into account and to sentence
the appellant to a longer term of imprisonment than Sophian for the joint
trafficking charge.

Conclusion

19 The appeal was therefore dismissed for the above reasons.
