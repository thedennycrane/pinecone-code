impaired his better judgment and control. Dr Phang added that however impaired
though the accused’s judgment might have been at and around the material time,
he still retained sufficient mental capacity to be capable of forming an
intent to cause the injuries in question. Dr Phang noted that the accused had
a history of epilepsy dating back to 1983 and his seizures were not optimally
controlled in spite of treatment, with recurrences on a regular basis. The
accused would have a predilection towards behaving violently and dangerously
when in an epileptic seizure. Dr Phang concluded that the accused would
require treatment and close follow-up on a permanent basis.

The accused pleaded guilty and was convicted for the offence of committing
culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the Penal Code,
Cap 224. The sole issue before the court was what was the appropriate sentence
to be imposed in this case where the accused was found to be suffering from a
mental condition which required treatment on a permanent basis.

**

Held,

**imposing a sentence of life imprisonment **:

**(1) In relation to the sentence to be imposed, attention was drawn to the
sentences imposed by the High Court in eight recent cases. It would appear
from the cases that the courts have imposed sentences of life imprisonment in
similar situations where mentally impaired offenders were convicted for
committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The concern addressed by
the courts in those cases were more in the direction of treatment,
rehabilitation and prevention rather than deterrence or retribution.

(2) The accused was apparently oblivious to the fact that the person whom he
attacked – that too over a trivial pearl bracelet – was none other than his
mother, as he was then in the throes of an epileptic seizure. The accused was
indeed in need of a long and closely monitored treatment regimen, and if not
afforded that, the likelihood of danger and harm to the public was not
imaginary but real.

(3) Consequently, having regard to all the factors, the accused is sentenced
to a term of imprisonment for life with a direction that the accused be given
treatment on a regular basis for his illness whilst serving his sentence.

**Judgment** __

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. Lim Hock Hin, a 42-year old male Singaporean pleaded guilty before me and
was convicted for an offence of committing culpable homicide not amounting to
murder under s 304 (a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The charge he faced
averred that he slashed his 65-year old mother with a knife at about 11.30 am,
on 13 November 2001 with the intention of causing bodily hurt as was likely to
cause death and caused her to suffer death on 20 November 2001.

2\. The facts which gave rise to the present proceedings can be summarised as
follows.

3\. The accused and his mother Mdm Tan Ah Pong were residing at a flat at
Block 12 Redhill Close, #01-106, Singapore. At about 11.30 am, on 13 November
2001, the accused had an argument with his mother in their flat over the
whereabouts of a pearl bracelet given to him by someone. In the course of the
altercation, he started pushing his mother in the chest continuously. When his
mother was trying to placate him by saying that she could not recall where she
had placed the bracelet, the accused started to become violent. He first used
a chair and later other objects which he could get hold of from the kitchen to
hit and hurt her. When his mother continued to protest that she could not
recall where the bracelet was, the accused suddenly seized a knife found
nearby and slashed her, causing her to fall.

4\. It would appear that after Mdm Tan was hurt, she somehow managed to find
her way to her neighbour’s flat and informed her neighbour that her son had
stabbed her with a knife. The neighbour then called the police.

5\. The accused, in the meantime, fled the flat in panic. However, as he
reached the top floor of a nearby block of flats, he felt that his mother
might still be alive. He then decided to return home and he did.

6\. Upon his return, the accused noticed the presence of police officers as
well as his siblings outside the flat. Presently, he asked the police the
condition of his mother and was told that she was all right. He was soon
arrested and sent to hospital for treatment as he was found to have injured
his right hand.

7\. The post-mortem finding of Dr Wee Kheng Poh, Consultant Forensic
Pathologist from the Centre for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority,
was that the cause of the death of the victim was bronchopneumonia with
hypoxic encephalopathy following a slash wound of the neck. The post-mortem
report also listed a number of injuries to the victim’s head, neck, chest,
abdomen and arms.

8\. The accused was, in the event, sent to Woodbridge Hospital for a
psychiatric assessment. In the opinion of Dr Stephen Phang, Consultant
Psychiatrist from Woodbridge Hospital and the Institute of Mental Health, the
accused was suffering from an acute epileptic seizure at the time of the
offence which significantly impaired his better judgment and impulse control,
to the extent that he attacked his mother fatally as a direct consequence of
his malady, which he would not have done had he not had a fit that morning. Dr
Phang added that ‘however impaired though his judgement may have been at and
around the material time, he still retained sufficient mental capacity to be
capable of forming an intent to cause the injuries in question’.

9\. Further, according to Dr Phang, the accused retained the mental capacity
to know that his act was likely to cause death, although unfortunately, his
mental responsibility was significantly diminished at and around the material
time, qualifying him for the defence of diminished responsibility. Dr Phang
noted that the accused had a history of epilepsy dating back to 1983 and his
seizures were still not optimally controlled in spite of treatment, with
recurrences on a regular basis. He commented further that when in the throes
of an epileptic seizure, the accused would have a predilection towards
behaving violently and dangerously. He concluded that the accused required
treatment and close follow-up on a permanent basis.

10\. The sole question before the court was what was the appropriate sentence
to be imposed in this case where the accused was found to be suffering from a
mental condition which required treatment on a permanent basis.

11\. Section 304(a) of the Penal Code provides that:

> > Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be
> punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term which may
> extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning, if the
> act by which death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or
> of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.

12\. Defence counsel in his mitigation plea urged the court not to impose a
sentence of life imprisonment on the accused. In this regard, he invited my
attention to the view expressed by defence psychiatrist, Dr Y C Lee who said
that he ‘ _believed that_ _if the epilepsy of the accused is well controlled
and his psychosis is kept in remission with medications, he[ would be] able to
live a normal life and would not be a danger to others_.’ It was all well said
but the question remained as to who was going to ensure the control and
treatment regimen suggested by Dr Lee. The sad fact was that his mother who
was residing with him was gone forever because of his sudden violence.

13\. The learned DPP in his submission said that the belief expressed by the
defence psychiatrist appeared to be predicated by a number of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’
and urged the court to take public interest into consideration. He reiterated
Dr Phang’s prognosis that the accused required treatment and close follow-up
on a permanent basis due to his continuing predilection towards violent and
dangerous behaviour and the attendant danger to the public and those who would
be in immediate contact with him.

14\. In relation to the sentence to be imposed, my attention was invited to
the sentences imposed by the High Court in the recent few years. Eight cases
were cited and they were: _**Public Prosecutor v Ong Wee Teck**_ (2001) 3 SLR
479, _**Public Prosecutor v Kwok Teng Soon**_ (2001) 4 SLR 576, _**Public
Prosecutor v Wee Eng Jong**_ (Criminal Case No 21/2001), _**Public Prosecutor
v Dolah bin Omar**_ (2001) 4 SLR 302, _**Public Prosecutor v Aloysius Joshi
Carilman**_ (CC 43/1999), _**Public Prosecutor v Lim Boon Chong Cyril**_
(Criminal Case No 34/1997), _**Public Prosecutor v Lee Chee Seng**_ (Criminal
Case No 48/1996) and _**Public Prosecutor v Donald Peter Chandraraj**_
(Criminal Case No 9/1996).

15\. The following schedule sets out the brief facts and sentences imposed in
the said eight cases:

**Case** | **Mental Condition** | **Brief Facts** | **Psychiatrist’s Opinion** | **Sentence imposed**  
---|---|---|---|---  
PP v Ong Wee Teck (2001) 3 SLR 479 | Schizophrenia | The accused killed his brother as he thought that his brother was trying to poison him | The accused would require on-going treatment probably on a lifelong basis. | Life imprisonment  
PP v Kwok Teng Soon (2001) 4 SLR 576 | Delusional Disorder | The accused killed his wife from China after they had some disputes about money. | In the event of a relapse, the accused could be violent towards others. With treatment, the Delusional Disorder could remit but control of symptoms is dependent on total compliance with treatment and this would be difficult to enforce in the community. | Life imprisonment  
PP v Wee Eng Jong (CC 21/01) | Schizophrenia | The accused stabbed a friend to death following a dispute at a coffee-shop. | There is a risk of the accused committing future acts of violence. The accused requires long term psychiatric follow-up. | Life imprisonment.  
---|---|---|---|---  
PP v Dolah Bin Omar (2001) 4 SLR 302 | Schizophrenia | The accused killed his uncle for no apparent reason. Psychiatrist opined that the accused was suffering from paranoid delusion about the deceased. | The accused needs long term medication and can be a danger to others and himself if he does not take his medication. | Life imprisonment  
PP v Aloysius Joshi Carilman (CC 43/99) | Schizophrenia | The accused used a bottle to hit his friend’s head and used a metal chair to hit his chest and stamped on his chest. | The accused will pose a danger to himself and to society if he stopped medication. | Life imprisonment  
PP v Lim Boon Chong Cyril (CC 34/97) | Schizo-affective Disorder | The accused smothered his 2 year old nephew with a pillow. | The accused was a danger to society. | Life imprisonment  
PP v Lee Chee Seng (CC 48/96) | Depressive Psychosis | The accused, on the instruction of hallucinatory voices, stabbed the deceased who had rejected his love. | The accused had an increased risk of being a danger to himself or others and this risk period was indefinite. | Life imprisonment  
PP v Donald Peter Chandaraj (CC 9/96) | Personality Disorder | The accused punched his 2 year old child to death for soiling his cot. | The accused was a threat to his family. | Life imprisonment  
  
16\. It would appear from the abovementioned cases that the courts have
imposed sentences of life imprisonment in similar situations where mentally
impaired offenders were convicted for committing culpable homicide not
amounting to murder. To my mind, the concern addressed by the courts in the
cases referred to were more in in the direction of treatment, rehabilitation
and prevention rather than deterrence or retribution. I was inclined to share
the same view.

17\. The accused in the case before me was apparently oblivious to the fact
that the person whom he attacked – that too over a trivial pearl bracelet –
was none other than his mother, as he was then in the throes of an epileptic
seizure. I was in agreement with the expert opinion that the accused was
indeed in need of a long and closely monitored treatment regimen, and if not
afforded that, the likelihood of danger and harm to the public were not
imaginary but real. In any event, in my view, the conditions for a long
sentence set out in _**R v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson**_ (1968) 52 Cr App R
113 (per MacKenna J) and approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in _**Neo
Man Lee v Public Prosecutor**_ [1991] 2 MLJ 369 at 370, by and large seemed to
apply to the facts and circumstances of the case at hand. The conditions
mentioned in _**Hodgson**_ were:

> > A sentence of life imprisonment is justified when (1) the offence or
> offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2)
> it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant’s history
> that he is unstable and likely to commit such offences in the future; and
> (3) if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be
> specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of
> violence.

18\. Consequently, having considered all the factors, I sentenced the accused
to a term of imprisonment for life with a direction that the accused be given
treatment on a regular basis for his illness whilst serving his sentence. In
imposing the sentence, I was also mindful of the aspect that under Rule 119A
of the Prisons Regulations, the accused might well receive a remission of
sentence if the Life Imprisonment Review Board were to conclude at the
appropriate stage that he would be suitable for such remission.

_

Order accordingly.
