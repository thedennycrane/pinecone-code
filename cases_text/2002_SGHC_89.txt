**Oral Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1\. The fundamental nature of motherhood is to raise and protect its
offspring; a desire to kill them is not apposite to that nature. I would
imagine that so deep a nature can be supplanted by the utterly opposite and
alien desire to wantonly kill its young only when there has been a partial, if
not total, or temporary, if not permanent, affliction of the mind by illness.
The medical report of Dr Tommy Tan dated 12 January 2001 bears this out, in
this case at least.

2\. But once a case such as yours comes before the courts, the law must be
applied. The law here does not excuse your conduct only because the illness
that had stricken you falls short of the legal definition of insanity. Your
case, at once compels the court to apply the law, and at the same time,
express a compassion that any human heart must feel for you and your children
in your circumstances.

3\. In considering the demands of the law, I am of the view that a general
deterrence is not relevant in your case because I do not think that it would
be frequent that a healthy and rational mind would contemplate the same dark
thoughts that filled yours last Christmas. I have taken into account the
period of remand since your arrest. And having satisfied myself that you are
unlikely to repeat the same deed; and that medication and therapy have and
will continue to arrest the illness that tormented you, I come to the opinion
that law and justice will both be served by the imposition of a fine of $1,000
on each of the charges upon which you have been convicted.
