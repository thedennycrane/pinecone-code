__ THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND 4 This action concerned construction work at a
project called Hilltops Apartments. The Plaintiffs were the main contractors
and the Defendants were their subcontractors for that project. The Defendants’
Counterclaim is in respect of a project at the Sinsov Building where they were
again the Plaintiffs’ subcontractors. 5 The Plaintiffs’ application for
security for costs was in respect of the Defendants’ Counterclaim and was made
pursuant to Section 388 of the Companies Act or, in the alternative, under O.
23 r. 1 of the Rules of Court, principally on the ground that the Defendants
were in financial straits. There is a pending Petition to wind up the
Defendants (CWU 174 of 1999). 6 Security for costs at $50,000 was ordered
against the Defendants by the Assistant Registrar. 7 On 29 August 2001, Judith
Prakash J allowed the Defendants’ appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s
decision on security for costs. On 11 September 2001 (two days before the
present appeal), the Plaintiffs lodged an appeal against the judge’s decision
and have instructed Mr Michael Hwang, S.C. as Counsel for the hearing before
the Court of Appeal. I was told that the Plaintiffs would be seeking to
proceed by way of expedited appeal pursuant to O. 57 r. 20. 8 The Plaintiffs
submitted that since the Defendants had admitted that they were in no position
to put up security for costs, it was obvious that should any costs be ordered
against the Defendants in the Counterclaim, those costs would not be paid. The
Plaintiffs accepted that an appeal to the Court of Appeal did not operate as a
stay of proceedings but argued that they were not seeking such a stay but were
merely asking the Court to exercise its discretion in the interest of justice
so as not to render their appeal on security for costs nugatory (_Wilson v
Church (No.2)_(1879-80) 12 ChD 454). They submitted that the trial should
therefore not proceed pending the outcome of their appeal. 9 Although the
Plaintiffs only took out the application for security for costs some 15 months
after the filing of the Counterclaim, they argued there was no inordinate
delay and that, in any event, there were numerous interlocutory applications
during the first half of 2001. The Plaintiffs had also asked for Further and
Better Particulars on 23 October 2000 but no response was made by the
Defendants until 9 March 2001 and that was to refuse to furnish the
particulars sought. When particulars were finally furnished by consent in May
2001, it was then that the Plaintiffs were able to say that the Counterclaim
was not a strong one. 10 Further, the Plaintiffs argued, they would suffer
grave prejudice as the action concerned a complex construction matter in which
the Plaintiffs would be calling 11 witnesses including an expert and the costs
for the ten-day trial would be in the region of $120,000, with about eight
days to be taken up by the Defendants’ Counterclaim. In contrast, the
Defendants were calling only one witness for the entire action. Counsel for
the Plaintiffs had also indicated to the Registrar at the PTC that they were
ready to exchange affidavits of evidence-in-chief before 1 October 2001 but
the Registrar stipulated a deadline two weeks earlier. As an alternative, the
Plaintiffs suggested that their claim proceed for trial while the Defendants’
counterclaim, which was in respect of an unrelated project, be held over until
after the appeal. 11 Counsel for the Defendants reiterated that they were
ready with their clients’ affidavit of evidence-in-chief. He informed me that
the winding up petition against the Defendants had been held over for more
than two years because the Defendants’ creditors supported that course of
action pending the Defendants’ counterclaim against the Plaintiffs. He was
agreeable to having the trial dates pushed back by two weeks but would like
all the other directions to remain. _THE DECISION OF THE COURT_ 12 I dismissed
the Plaintiffs’ appeal against the Registrar’s directions with costs fixed at
$500 to be paid to the Defendants. The Plaintiffs have lodged an appeal
against my decision on 25 September 2001. 13 In _Dickson Trading (S) Pte Ltd v
Transmarco Ltd_ ]1989] 2 MLJ 408, the Plaintiffs there applied for an
interlocutory injunction to restrain the Defendants from disposing of certain
shares. Chan Sek Keong JC dismissed the application. The Plaintiffs then
applied for an interim injunction pending appeal against the dismissal,
relying on _Erinford Properties Ltd & Anor v Cheshire County Council _[1974]
Ch 261. The judge distinguished cases concerning applications for stay of
execution of final judgments after full trials from the application before him
which was in effect a stay of an interlocutory order. In his view, there was a
difference in substance and not merely in degree between the two situations.
He was also of the opinion that the likelihood of an appeal, if successful,
being rendered nugatory, was a sufficient ground for a stay of execution.
However, the judge refused the Plaintiffs the limited injunction sought
fundamentally because the Plaintiffs’ action, if ultimately successful, would
not be affected by their failure to obtain an interlocutory injunction. 14 The
Plaintiffs here submitted that while they were not asking for a stay of
execution, the principles set out in the above case could be relied upon to
assist the Court in exercising its discretion whether or not to vacate the
trial dates. 15 I do not disagree with the principles stated but it should be
noted that in cases like _Dickson Trading_ above, granting the interim relief
sought would still permit the wheels of litigation to roll on. In contrast,
the Plaintiffs here were effectively asking that I apply the brakes and park
the action by the wayside (or at least the counterclaim) until such time as
the brakes were released by the Court of Appeal. This I was not willing to do
in the circumstances of this case. 16 The Plaintiffs only took out their
application for security for costs some 15 months after the filing of the
Defendants’ Counterclaim. If one reckoned the time from the filing of the
Amended Defence and Counterclaim on 25 April 2000, it would still be 14
months. Even if they were justified in not doing so until after Further and
Better Particulars had been provided by the Defendants, they had nevertheless
taken some six months from the filing of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim
to ask for particulars. Further, they ought to have known, at the time they
commenced this action on 1 February 2000 or at least soon thereafter, that the
Defendants were the subject of a winding up petition. They were therefore
responsible for at least a six-month delay. 17 In addition, their application
for security for costs has already been considered by a High Court Judge and
such an application involved an exercise of discretion. There are other
interlocutory applications the outcome of which could affect the trial process
itself; for instance, an application to make substantial amendments to a claim
or an application to call additional evidence at the trial. Such applications,
decided one way or the other, could be said to prejudice one of the parties to
the proceedings. Yet, in such cases impinging on the trial process itself, it
would be highly unlikely that the Court would either vacate the trial dates or
stop the trial at that stage in order to await the outcome of an appeal. Here,
any prejudice to the Plaintiffs would only arise if the Defendants’
counterclaim was dismissed with costs. The trial process would not be affected
at all. The litigation process would become most unsatisfactory if all such
interlocutory applications must first receive the attention of the highest
Court in our system of justice before the next step could be taken. TAY YONG
