[2016] SGHC 171

High Court — HC/Companies Winding Up No 111 of 2016  
Choo Han Teck J  
8, 29 July 2016

29 August 2016 Judgment reserved.

Choo Han Teck J:

1 The question before me is whether a creditor, who is also a controlling
shareholder and director of a company may wind up the company under s
254(1)(e) and s 254(2)(a) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) in the
face of objection from other creditors.

2 Koh Say Chong (“the plaintiff”) applied to wind up Two Oceans Film Company
Pte Ltd (“the Company”) on the ground of insolvency stated in s 254(1)(e) of
the Companies Act. The Company is a private limited company incorporated on 28
August 1998 in Singapore that deals in the business of advertising and video
production. The plaintiff is a director, shareholder and creditor of the
Company.

3 The two shareholders of the Company are the plaintiff and his wife,
Geraldine Ng Mui Ling (“Geraldine Ng”) who each own 50% of the shares in the
Company. The plaintiff and Geraldine Ng are also the two directors of the
Company. The plaintiff and Geraldine Ng are also the sole directors and
shareholders of another company, Salt Films Pte Ltd (“Salt Films”), which is
one of the creditors of the Company.

4 The plaintiff claims that he and Salt Films advanced loans to the Company.
The plaintiff also claims that he had not drawn his full salary, remuneration
and expenses from the Company since late 2015 to help the Company tide over
its financial difficulties. On 5 May 2016, the plaintiff issued and served a
statutory demand on the Company for payment of the sums of:

(a) Unpaid salary, remuneration and expenses of $85,049.64 as at 31 March
2016; and

(b) Loans in the amount of $186,360.32.

5 The amount of unpaid salary, remuneration and expenses that the plaintiff
raised in his submissions ($69,549.64) differs from what he raised in the
statutory demand ($85,049.64). I take $69,549.64 to be the correct amount
given that this is the sum that the plaintiff exhibited in his 2nd affidavit
dated 5 July 2016. The plaintiff exhibited an extract from the Company’s
accounts, which shows that the plaintiff had received payment of $15,500,
which was the difference between $69,549.64 and $85,049.64, as payment for his
salary for November 2015 and partial payment for his salary for December 2015.
Nothing turns on this inconsistency because on either amount, the debt exceeds
the statutory minimum of $10,000 under s 254(2)(a) of the Companies Act. The
statutory demand also contains the notice that in the event of the Company’s
refusal and/or failure and/or neglect to make payment of the sums within three
weeks from the date of service of the demand, the Company would be deemed to
be unable to pay its debts and winding up proceedings may be commenced against
it.

6 The Company did not pay the Debt, or offer to secure or compound the debt
after the three week period prescribed under the statutory demand. The
plaintiff then filed the present application to wind up the Company on the
ground that the Company is deemed to be unable to pay its debt and was
insolvent by operation of s 254(1)(e) read with s 254(2)(a) of the Companies
Act.

7 The schedule tendered by the plaintiff to the Court shows that the Company
has 36 creditors including the plaintiff. The schedule is reproduced below:

8 In total, the company owes $2,081,542.61 to its creditors based on the
claims made by its creditors. At the winding up proceedings, 32 creditors of
the Company, representing $608,747.38 of the Company’s debt raised objections
(“the opposing creditors”) over the plaintiff’s application to wind up the
Company and asked that the plaintiff’s application be dismissed or stayed.
three creditors of the Company, representing $1,216,885.17 of the Company’s
debt supported the plaintiff’s application to wind up the Company.

9 30 opposing creditors consisting of the 1st to the 30th creditor listed in
the table above at [7] are represented by Mr Aditya Naidu (“Mr Aditya”). The
31st opposing creditor, Bert Lighting House Pte Ltd (“Bert Lighting”) is
represented by Mr Nicolas Tang (“Mr Tang”). The 32nd opposing creditor,
Tribeca Management Pte Ltd (“Tribeca”) is represented by Ms Annsley Wong (“Ms
Wong”).

10 The arguments raised by Mr Aditya, Mr Tang and Ms Wong in their submissions
can be summed as follows. First, the opposing creditors argue that the winding
up application was an abuse of process. Their case is that the plaintiff
orchestrated the situation of indebtedness that led to the present winding up
application, and that it was thus disingenuous for the plaintiff to allege
that the Company failed to reply his statutory demand or dispute the debt
because the plaintiff himself is one of the two directors who has control the
Company. The opposing creditors also aver that the plaintiff, as a
shareholder, did not show an interest sufficient to induce the court to wind
up the Company. They rely on Re Ah Yee Contractors (Pte) Ltd [1987] SLR(R) 396
in support of their claim that the plaintiff, as a shareholder, has to show
the Court that there is a surplus divisible among the shareholders, post
winding up, before the Court will assist him in his winding up application.
Further, the creditors claim that the plaintiff’s resort to a winding up
application was improper as he had alternative options such as commencing
legal action to enforce his debt.

11 The second ground which the opposing creditors rely on is the plaintiff’s
failure to discharge his burden to prove that the Company is unable to pay its
debts and is insolvent. They argue that there is no proof that the Company was
indebted to the plaintiff and that the amounts listed in the statutory demand
were questionable, being claims without any supporting evidence. Further, the
opposing creditors argue that a mere omission by the Company respond to a
statutory demand or to pay its debts is not conclusive of the Company being
insolvent especially since it was the plaintiff himself who had caused the
Company’s failure to respond to the statutory demand.

12 With regard to Salt Films, the opposing creditors challenge the debt owed
to Salt Films. They say that the statement of accounts attached to the
affidavit of Geraldine Ng in support of the winding up filed on behalf of Salt
Films lacks details of when the loans were made, for what purpose they were
made, and when repayments were made. The opposing creditors also make the
point that the plaintiff might have diverted contracts from the Company to
Salt Films.

13 Another complaint raised by Ms Wong for the 32nd creditor was that the
plaintiff had, in the time leading up to this application, reduced the
Company’s assets, against the interest of the creditors. To demonstrate this,
she points to the fact that the plaintiff had during the period between 27
October 2015 to 31 March 2016 continued to pay himself a monthly salary, claim
for his own personal hospitalisation and insurance endowment plans, book
hotels, rent vehicles and service his personal car even though the Company was
insolvent at the time.

14 In response, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Cheo, argued that as a creditor,
the plaintiff is entitled to rely on s 254(1)(e) read with s 254(2)(a) of the
Companies Act to wind up the Company after the statutory demand is served and
not responded to. He further contends that the plaintiff is not required to
show that there will be a surplus, divisible amongst the shareholders, after
the winding up. With regard to the opposing creditors’ allegations, the
plaintiff denies the allegations and submits that they are without any
credible basis and are not supported by any evidence. Finally, he claims that
there is no obligation to explore alternative measures such as suing the
Company for the debt before resorting to a winding up application.

15 A company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts and presumed to be
insolvent under s 254(2)(a) of the Companies Act if it neglects to pay the
debt in a statutory demand, or to secure or compound for it within three weeks
after service of the statutory demand. While a mere omission to pay a debt may
not amount to a neglect to pay, this should only be the case when there is
valid excuse for not paying the debt such as a bona fide dispute against the
debt or the existence of a bona fide counterclaim (see Re Mechanised
Construction Pte Ltd [1989] 1 SLR(R) 500 and Ng Tai Tuan and another v Chng
Gim Huat Pte Ltd [1990] 2 SLR(R) 231). Nonetheless, even if the statutory
ground is established, the Court may, after considering all the relevant
factors, such as the utility, propriety and effect of a winding up order as
well as the overall fairness and justice of the case, exercise its discretion
not to wind up a company (see Lai Shit Har and another v Lau Yu Man [2008] 4
SLR(R) 348 at [33]).

16 Given that the statutory requirements under s 254(2)(a) in the present
application have been fulfilled and there are no disputes over the debt or
counterclaims raised by the Company, the issue before me is whether the
opposing creditors have raised sufficient grounds to invoke the Court’s
exercise of its residual discretion to dismiss the plaintiff’s winding up
application. I find that the creditors have not done so.

17 The allegations raised by the opposing creditors’ in objection to the
winding up application are not substantiated by evidence other than the bare
assertions that:

(a) There was bad faith in the plaintiff orchestrating the winding up
application on the basis of his relationship with the Company as its creditor,
director and shareholder; and

(b) There were questionable transactions arising from the debts claimed by
Salt Films and himself.

18 Although the plaintiff, Salt Films and the Company are related entities,
this cannot, on its own, be sufficient to justify denying the plaintiff’s
application. Otherwise, that would amount to establishing a rule preventing
associated entities such as directors or related companies that are
simultaneously creditors from availing to the grounds of winding up under s
254(1)(e) read with s 254(2)(a) that is available to creditors under the
Companies Act. Even if there is merit in the opposing creditors’ bare
assertions that there are questionable transactions arising from the debt
claimed by the plaintiff and Salt Films, the liquidator, appointed upon a
winding up order will be obliged to look into the proof of the debts and make
the appropriate assessment of the amounts the Company is liable for. The
liquidator is also empowered to commence investigations and take legal action
against the appropriate entities, if required, for improprieties such as
breaches of fiduciary duties, undervalued transactions or unfair preference
should they arise.

19 Secondly, the plaintiff does not need to show that there would be
sufficient surplus to be distributed to the shareholders after all debts are
paid. This is because the plaintiff is applying to wind up the Company as a
creditor on the basis of the Company’s insolvency. His interest in the winding
up of the Company is simply the recovery of the debt that the Company owes to
him. The present application is different from Re Ah Yee Contractors (Pte) Ltd
[1987] SLR(R) 396 that the opposing creditors rely on. In that case, the
applicant of the winding up was a shareholder attempting to wind up the
company on just and equitable grounds. It was reasonable for the court in that
case to require the applicant, who was a fully paid shareholder (but not a
creditor), to show an interest in the winding up of the company by showing a
surplus, divisible amongst the shareholders, after the winding up to induce
the court to interfere on his behalf. This is not required when the applicant
is applying to wind up the Company as a creditor in his own right as is the
case here.

20 Thirdly, the opposing creditors have also not provided any viable
alternative to winding up the Company. Their suggestion that the plaintiff
commence a suit against the Company for the recovery of the debt is not
practical. It is very likely that the Company will not dispute the debt just
as it has done in this winding up application. That will result in a default
judgment entered against the Company that will be used to support yet another
winding up application. Hence, to ask that the plaintiff to commence a suit
against the Company would be a waste of time and costs.

21 Lastly, also from a practical standpoint, I find that granting the winding
up order is the most appropriate measure, on the available facts, and it will
not prejudice any party. The two sole directors and shareholders of the
company, ie, the plaintiff and Geraldine Ng, are in favour of the winding up.
The obvious inference is that neither of them believes the Company to be a
going concern moving forward. On that basis, it is highly unlikely that
refusing the winding up application would result in any positive benefit or
outcome to the Company or its creditors. In fact, prolonging the Company’s
life may cause further depletion of the Company’s assets through its continued
operations. Further, the majority of the creditors in value support the
application and it is only a minority that is opposed to it. All things
considered, it is more sensible to realise and distribute the assets of the
Company as soon as possible to the creditors and thereafter its shareholders
and a winding up order is the appropriate way to see this through.

22 I therefore find that the statutory ground of winding up under s 254(1)(e)
read with s 254(2)(a) has been established and that the opposing creditors
have failed to provide sufficient reason to invoke the Court’s discretion to
interfere with this winding up application. There is also no evidence of an
abuse of process.

23 For these reasons and because the papers are in order, I grant the winding
up application in its terms sought.
