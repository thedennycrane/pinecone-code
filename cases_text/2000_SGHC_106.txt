**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

1\. This is an appeal against the order of the learned Senior Assistant
Registrar dated 7 January 2000 giving summary judgment against the defendants
in the sum of $296,709.41 plus interest, and awarding costs of $6,000. The
defendants appealed against this order. By the time the hearing of the appeal
came up before me, the defendants had paid the judgment sum to the plaintiffs.
On 6 April 2000, after hearing counsel for the parties, I allowed the appeal
in part and ordered that there be conditional leave to defend in respect of
Debit Notes No. 221, 222 and 224 totalling $144,200. I dismissed the appeal in
respect of the balance $152,509.41. I varied the order for costs below as
follows:

> (a) costs to plaintiffs at 50% of costs incurred to date, inclusive of costs
> below; and
>
> (b) the balance 50% costs incurred to date to be costs in the cause.

2\. On 3 May 2000 the defendants filed notice of appeal against my order and I
now give my grounds of decision.

I shall refer to the $224,557.02 billed under the 17 invoices as the "Invoiced
Sum" and the $144,200 billed under the 3 Debit Notes as the "DN Sum".

4\. The defendants filed 2 affidavits in opposition to the application for
summary judgment, one by Ho Yeung Tai ("Ho") their Finance Manager and the
other by Laurentina Low ("Low") their accountant. Ho gave evidence of the
background of the plaintiffs and defendants and the nature of the transactions
between them. He said that the plaintiffs' managing director, Choi Kwai Shing
was also the managing director of the defendants from 1994 until he was
removed in June 1999. Ho said that the defendants were manufacturers of
cartons and paper products. The defendants sub-contracted to the plaintiffs
certain processing works in respect of their carton manufacturing operations.
In addition, in times of peak demand, the defendants sub-contracted additional
works to the plaintiffs.

5\. In respect of the Invoiced Sum, Ho did not claim that the material and
work the subject of the invoices were not supplied or done. Instead he took
pains to point out that during Choi Kwai Shing's tenure as managing director,
Choi Kwai Shing had improperly diverted work to the plaintiffs and taken
various loans from them. Choi Kwai Shing had also caused the defendants to
remit substantial sums of money to China in relation to an alleged investment
there. Ho also questioned the transactions in relation to the DN Sum. He
pointed out certain features of the debit notes, to which I shall turn later,
which show that they were sham transactions.

6\. However there was no allegation that the invoices were not valid, apart
from a complaint that the plaintiffs had "overcharged" the defendants. To show
this, the defendants exhibited a tabulation of prices of material sold by the
plaintiffs to the defendants. The defendants alleged that in the case of 7 out
of some 80 items, the plaintiffs had sold them the material at a price higher
than the defendants' selling price. However there was no attempt to link the
items indicated on this list to the invoices exhibited by the plaintiffs.

7\. In her affidavit, the accountant, Low, also described how Choi Kwai Shing
gave her instructions to make out a loan of $100,000 to the plaintiffs in May
1996 which she complied with. She then said that Choi Kwai Shing had, on 4
occasions between May 1996 and February 1997, instructed her to "loan monies"
to the plaintiffs. However she did not reveal the amounts. She then said that
she was subsequently instructed by Choi Kwai Shing to remit the monies
directly to China instead of remitting them to the plaintiffs. Low also raised
the same doubts about the debit notes that Ho did. But she did not say
anything about the 17 invoices.

8\. In their affidavits, Ho and Low did not even deny that the Invoiced Sum
was due. All they did was to attempt to raise doubts about certain
transactions that Choi Kwai Shing was involved in. Yet they did not give much
detail as to the wrongfulness of those transactions. Furthermore, Ho said that
the defendants would be filing a counterclaim in which these matter would be
particularised. But up to the time of the hearing of the appeal before me this
was not done. If there had been a bona fide counterclaim, the court could have
given consideration to a stay of execution of the judgment pending
determination of the counterclaim. Clearly those events were brought up simply
to cast doubts about the plaintiffs and their case, and about Choi Kwai Shing.

9\. Choi Kwai Shing filed a second affidavit in reply to the affidavits of Ho
and Low. In it he set out the circumstances behind the parties. The plaintiffs
and defendants are related companies. They have a common shareholder in Hallam
Investments Ltd ("Hallam"), a company registered in the Isle of Man. Hallam
owns 41.67% of the plaintiffs' shares and 86.67% of the defendants'. Choi Kwai
Shing was a director of both the plaintiffs and the defendants, along with one
Hugo Choi and Winfred Lien ("Lien"), until he was removed as a director of the
defendants in June 1999 due to "shareholders' politics". He said that the
parties had a sub-contracting relationship since 1984, one that the defendants
had derived much benefit from. Choi Kwai Shing said that this arrangement was
in existence even before he became the managing director of the defendants.
For many years, Lien was the director signing the purchase orders issued by
the defendants to the plaintiffs. In fact, after Choi Kwai Shing was removed
as a director in June 1999, the defendants continued to sub-contract work to
the plaintiffs by issuing purchasing orders from July to December 1999. Lien
had signed these purchase orders. The defendants had made a part payment in
respect of the purchase orders on 18 August 1999 in the sum of $65,935.22.
This sum was set off against the amount owing under the invoices. Of the 17
invoices, 2 were issued before Choi Kwai Shing was removed as director, for
the sum of about $13,000. The remaining 15 invoices were issued after Choi
Kwai Shing was removed. These total about $210,000.

10\. Choi Kwai Shing denied the defendants' allegation of overcharging. He
said that the prices charged were maintained over the years and the defendants
had hitherto paid the earlier invoices without any fuss. He pointed out that
after he was removed as a director of the defendants, they continued to sub-
contract work to the plaintiffs between July and December 1999 by issuing
purchase orders. Choi Kwai Shing said that if the plaintiffs had indeed been
overcharging the defendants they would not have continued to issue those
purchase orders. In the appeal before me the defendants, who were given leave
to file further affidavits, filed one deposed by Hugo Choi. He explained that
the defendants had no choice but to sub-contract to the plaintiffs the works
in those purchase orders. This was because they needed time to find other sub-
contractors to take over from the plaintiffs and approval of their customers
to do so. As soon as they found one, the defendants in fact terminated all
business with the plaintiffs.

11\. As for the debit notes, Choi Kwai Shing said that for many years the
defendants had been using the plaintiffs' warehouse for storage of goods. The
parties had agreed that the plaintiffs would charge the defendants for this
service from April 1995\. The plaintiffs had also incurred labour charges for
moving the defendants' goods in the warehouse. Such charges were reported in
the defendants' annual reports in 1996 and 1998\. These reports show that for
the period 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1996, the defendants paid the plaintiffs
$600,000 in storage charges. In the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998,
$650,000 was paid. These reports were signed by Hugo Choi, Lien and Choi Kwai
Shing as directors. Choi Kwai Shing said that payments for these charges were
made by the defendants since 1996 without protest.

12\. In respect of the loans, Choi Kwai Shing said that these were properly
authorised by the defendants' board of directors. I note that the defendants
had not alleged in the affidavits of Ho and Low that these loans were
outstanding nor that they were entitled to set them off against the sums
claimed by the plaintiffs. In fact Ho said that these loans were due and
repayable by the plaintiffs "upon an account and inquiry being taken and
settled in due course". Therefore, even accepting the defendants' position
that there were these loans to the plaintiffs, their stand is that they were
not yet due.

**

The Invoiced Sum

**

13\. The defendants do not deny that, in respect of the Invoiced Sum,
materials were supplied, the work was done and the services were rendered.
Hugo Choi had in effect deposed that they had consciously made the decision to
continue to sub-contract work to the plaintiffs after Choi Kwai Shing had been
removed as director. They did so notwithstanding their knowledge of all the
alleged abuse by Choi Kwai Shing as director. The fact that they had no choice
because of commercial pressure does not absolve them of their contractual
obligation. The rates charged were the same rates that had been charged all
along, which the defendants had not protested about at the time of the
invoices. Having given orders for these works to be carried out, and having
obtained the benefit of the plaintiffs' efforts, I cannot see how the
defendants can now say that they are not liable to pay the Invoiced Sum. As
there is no conceivable defence, I dismissed the defendants' appeal against
judgment in respect of this part of the claim.

****

The DN Sum

14\. I turn now to the DN Sum which totals $144,200. The defendants say that
the debit notes were issued under rather spurious circumstances. They also say
that there is duplicity in the debit notes. Hugo Choi pointed out that the 3
debit notes in question state that each is for "service charge, storage &
supply of ink for printing of cartons". He said that some of the invoices also
provide for printing. I find that this ground raises a triable issue as to
whether there is duplicity in the charges given the relationship between the
parties. However I am of the view that the defence is shadowy for the
following reasons:

> (a) There was a long-standing arrangement in relation to the charges the
> subject of the debit notes.
>
> (b) Hugo Choi, who made allegations against the plaintiffs, was part of the
> management team of the defendants when Choi Kwai Shing held control.
>
> (c) The defendants had initially relied principally on the affidavit Ho, who
> had no direct knowledge of the matters. Hugo Choi filed an affidavit only
> after the plaintiffs had obtained judgment in the court below.

15\. I therefore considered that the appropriate order to make in respect of
the DN Sum was to give conditional leave to defend. As the defendants had
already paid to the plaintiffs the total amount of the judgment given in the
court below, I ordered the plaintiffs to refund $144,200 to the defendants
upon their providing a banker's guarantee or some other satisfactory security
for that amount.
