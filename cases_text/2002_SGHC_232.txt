** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

On 23 December 2001 at 12.50am the police conducted a raid on Tiananmen KTV &
Lounge Pte Ltd, situated at No. 407 Havelock Road. Chia Sze Chang, the
appellant, was a co-owner of the entertainment establishment at this time. Due
to three breaches of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act (Cap 257) s
19(1)(c), the appellant was charged on three counts.

2 The first charge, was that the appellant had failed to ensure that the
singers did not sit with the customers.

3 The second and third charges, was that the appellant had failed to ensure
that the customers would only be served drinks by persons who were listed on
the establishment’s register.

4 The appellant was convicted on all three charges. District Judge Kow Keng
Siong imposed a fine of $9,000, in default two months imprisonment, on each
charge. The total fine was therefore $27,000 which the appellant has since
paid.

5 The appellant appealed against conviction.

**

Facts as to the first charge

**

6 The following were the facts as found by the trial judge.

7 Staff Sgt Wong Vee Kong, the prosecution’s first witness, entered the
Tiananmen KTV & Lounge at 12.50am on 23 December 2001. He was in plain clothes
and was accompanied by a group of officers, also in plain clothes. Due to his
seniority, Staff Sgt Wong led the group. Staff Sgt Wong surveyed the premises
and spotted some goings-on in KTV room 18, where he observed a woman dancing
with a customer. He also observed that two more women were chatting and
sitting with some other customers in the same room. These observations
prompted Staff Sgt Wong’s to enter the room whereupon he identified himself as
a police officer. In the course of his questioning and the subsequent arrests,
Staff Sgt Wong identified the two women who were sitting with the customers as
Liu Hong Lian (Liu) and Zhang Chong Ling (Zhang). It was undisputed that these
two women were employed as singers by the appellant. The Licensing Conditions
for Nightclubs/Cocktail Lounges/Discotheques/Restaurants states that :

> > The licensee shall ensure that the singers do not sit or dance with the
> customers.

As against the dancer, Gao Hong Mei, no subsequent action was taken as Staff
Sgt Wong was satisfied that she was brought in as a guest.

**

The appellant’s challenge on conviction under the first charge

**

8 The appellant disputed the trial judge’s finding that Zhang and Liu were
sitting with the customers, but did not provide any evidence to persuade this
court to disregard trial judge’s findings on this matter. The district judge
stated at pages 11 and 12 of his grounds of decision:

> > In the present case, if Staff Sgt Wong’s evidence is believed, the
> ingredients of [the first charge] would have been satisfied. Having
> carefully considered the matter, I found Staff Sgt Wong to be a reliable
> witness and that it is inconceivable that he could have been mistaken about
> seeing Liu and Zhang.

There was nothing in the appellant’s submission nor in anything the trial
judge said on this matter that could persuade this court to alter the trial
judge’s findings. In _Ang Jwee Herng v PP_ [2001] 2 SLR 474 I re-stated the
following principle:

> > It is settled law that an appellate court will be slow to overturn
> findings of fact by the trial judge especially when an assessment of the
> credibility and veracity of the witness has been made.

This principle has been used in a whole host of case law - _Shamsul bin
Abdullah v PP_ MA145/2002; _Lim Ah Poh v PP_ [1992] 1 SLR 713 at 719; _Teo
Keng Pong v PP_ [1996] 3 SLR 329 at 342; _Ng Soo Hin v PP_ [1994] 1 SLR 105;
_Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP_ [1997] 3 SLR 464.

9 The three reasons given by the trial judge as to why he came to the
conclusion that the two singers, Zhang and Liu, were sitting with the
customers were sound. The trial judge stated that Staff Sgt Wong had enough
observation time before entering room 18 to confirm that the women were
sitting with the customers. Secondly, the trial judge stated there was not any
evidence produced by the appellant to show that Staff Sgt Wong was less than
diligent in his observation skills. The appellant’s contention that Staff Sgt
Wong was totally fixated on the dancer and not on the women sitting with the
customers was totally speculative, and the trial judge was quite right to
dispose of such a far-fetched theory. Thirdly, Staff Sgt Wong wasted no time
in checking on the three women in room 18. During the checking, the two women
who were sitting with the customers produced their professional visit passes .

10 The appellant did not dispute that Zhang and Liu were singers employed at
his KTV Lounge. For these reasons, there could be no dispute as to the trial
judge’s findings that these singers sat with the customers.

11 The appellant had a second argument which challenged his conviction under
the first charge. He contended that the trial judge erred in law and in fact
in finding that the unavailability of Liu and Zhang was not fatal to the
prosecution’s case.

12 Zhang and Liu returned to China before the start of the trial in the
district court. The two of them had insisted on returning home. As the trial
judge observed, the authorities in Singapore had no power to detain them as
they were not immigration offenders.

13 The unavailability of Zhang and Liu as witnesses during the trial could not
work to extinguish the appellant’s culpability. The reason why the prosecution
did not call Zhang and Liu was because had left the country and not because
their presence as trial witnesses would jeopardise the prosecution’s case.
This was addressed by the trial judge and there was no reason to second-guess
his application of the law on the matter.

14 No adverse inference could also be drawn against the prosecution under s
116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act. I held in _R Yoganathan v PP_ [1999]
4 SLR 264 at 278 that, although the prosecution did not call certain witnesses
to give evidence and likewise declined to produce PW1 for further cross-
examination at the close of its case, the presumption under s116 illustration
(g) of the Evidence Act did not operate. This was because the witnesses who
were not produced were not essential to the prosecution’s case, and neither
did the prosecution withhold evidence from the court or the appellant.
Important for our purposes in this case was the fact that the adverse
inference under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act is discretionary.
Illustration (g) under s116 reads:

> > ..... that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced
> be unfavourable to the person who withholds it

With the guidance of _R Yoganathan_ , no adverse inference should be drawn
from the fact that Zhang and Liu returned to China. No ill-motivation on the
part of the prosecution can be latched onto the women’s innocent desire to
return home. I ruled in _Ang Jwee Herng_ [2001] 2 SLR 474 __ that the
prosecution has no obligation to call any particular witness, unless the
failure to do so could be shown to be motivated by an intention to hinder or
hamper the defence. This principle consolidated itself in the judgments in
_Chua Keem Long v PP_ [1996] 1 SLR 510 and _Roy S Selvarajah v PP_ [1998] 3
SLR 517.

15 Of importance was the fact that the trial judge found Staff Sgt Wong a
credible witness and that his testimony was sufficient to confirm that Zhang
and Liu were sitting with the customers. For these reasons, the appellant’s
claim that there were insufficient witnesses must fail.

16 The appellant’s third challenge to his conviction under the first charge
was that the trial judge imposed on him too great a burden to ensure that his
singers did not sit with customers. He listed out all the ways in which he
tried to prevent his singers from sitting with customers. Amongst the
‘preventive measures’ he listed in his submission were :

> > a All employees must have a valid work permit
>>

>> b No one below 18 years old is allowed into the lounge

> > c The staff is closely supervised by the ‘Mummys’ in the lounge
>>

>> d The singers employed are briefed and constantly reminded that they are
not to sit with customers

>>

>> e The singers are further briefed and reminded not even to mingle with
customers, even in passageways or by any form of chit-chatting

The appellant further stated that he personally walked around the lounge to
ensure that no conditions of the licence were breached. Thus, the appellant’s
argument was that, in light of all these preventive measures, he should be
excused from liability since he fulfilled the condition ‘the licensee _shall
ensure_ that the singers do not sit with the customers.’ I found that the
appellant did not reach the threshold needed to fulfil the ‘ _shall ensure_ ’
condition. It was my belief that the appellant knew of the goings-on in the
KTV rooms but turned a blind eye to them. If the appellant said, as he did,
that he regularly did his rounds to ensure that no breach took place, why did
it only take a short while for Staff Sgt Wong to realise that there was a
clear breach in room 18? Could it be that the breaches only occurred when the
big boss was away? (in this case, the appellant was away from the lounge when
the raid happened) – I did not think so. This was because the appellant had
stated that he was not the only person who did the patrolling. The ‘Mummys’ or
‘Mamasans’ patrolled also. If the KTV rooms were brightly lit, the insides of
which were able to be seen from the corridors, as has been deduced from the
evidence, why would it be so difficult to ensure that no singer sat with a
customer? The appellant and his ‘Mummys’ most certainly do do their rounds of
patrol but turn a blind eye to the goings-on in the KTV rooms. I would say
that he is guilty of Nelsonian knowledge – he knows the true facts of things
but turns a blind eye to them as Lord Nelson did in putting his telescope to
his blind eye and declaring, ‘I see no ships, I see no ships.’ The appellant
was guilty of such knowledge – he knew of the trend of singers sitting with
customers. At the time of the raid only 25 rooms were occupied. It was not
difficult to ensure that singers did not sit with customers in 25 rooms, if
the patrols are done diligently. Furthermore, the appellant stated in cross-
examination that he had only 8 singers, and that he took just five to ten
minutes to complete his patrol. There were only eight singers to keep an eye
on. And the patrol only took five to ten minutes. How difficult could it be to
keep the place in check? – Not difficult; if the intention is to keep the
place in check. From what the appellant stated on his own accord, it is my
view that he ‘turned a blind eye’ to what was really going on in the rooms.
For this reason, the ‘shall ensure’ condition had not been met.

17 This was far from making liability, stemming from the breach of the
licensing conditions, strict. Here, the appellant, although taking the
preventive measures, did not possess the intention of stamping out the
breaches of the conditions under the licence. The appellant had Nelsonian
knowledge – he turned a blind eye. The preventive actions were not coupled
with a genuine desire to prevent the breaches. This was where the appellant
counsel’s argument fell short.

18 Thus, the appellant’s contention that he took all reasonable and necessary
steps to prevent the breach from happening was off-tangent. What threw it off
was his knowledge.

19 For these reasons, the appeal against conviction under the first charge was
dismissed.

**

Facts as to the second and third charges

**

20 On the night of the raid, Narcotics Officer Gopinathan (NO Gopinathan) was
instructed to enter KTV room 19. This he did. There were four male customers
and two women in the room. NO Gopinathan identified himself and stated that he
was in plain clothes. In his evidence, he stated that the two women were
sitting beside the male customers. After NO Gopinathan had done the initial
investigation, he returned to Central Division. The two women in room 19
followed him. The case was then handed over to officer Adrian Oong Chun Chang.
The two women, Li and Dong, requested to return to China. As they were not
found to be immigration offenders, they were released.

21 It was the prosecution’s case, which was agreed to by the trial judge, that
these two women were the ones who were sitting and serving the four customers
that night.

22 The issue here stemmed from the following condition which a licensee must
fulfil. According to the ‘Licensing Conditions for Nightclubs/Cocktail
Lounges/Discotheques/Restaurants/Bars’:

> > The licensee shall ensure that only _registered_ waitresses, bar-girls,
> and lounge-hostesses are permitted to serve customers.

Dong and Li were not registered and, on the strength of the prosecution
witnesses, the trial judge found the appellant in breach of the above
condition. The appellant contested this finding on several grounds.

**

The appellant’s challenge on convictions under the second and third charge
respectively

**

23 The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in
finding that both Li and Dong had been sufficiently identified. The arrest
report showed that, the two women were Dong and Li. As NO Gopinathan stated in
his examination-in-chief:

> > After I had finished, I handed over the particulars to one of the In-
> Charge and escorted the females to the holding area. We then went back to
> Central Division. _The two females from room 19 followed me_. Officer Adrian
> Oong Chun Chang lodged an arrest report. I gave the particulars to Oong who
> lodged the report. I verified the arrest report. (my emphasis)

There was hardly any slip in the correct identification of these two women,
Dong and Li.

24 The appellant also contended that the trial judge erred in law and fact by
accepting and giving too much weight to the evidence of Cheok Ah Lek (Cheok)
and Liew Fatt Nien (Liew), who were two of the four customers in room 19 that
night. Liew and Cheok were prosecution witnesses.

25 To this end, it is apt to re-emphasise the trial judge’s own apprehensions
toward Liew’s testimony that Dong and Li were definitely the women in room 19.
The trial judge’s apprehension stemmed from the fact that Liew had confirmed
the two women as the two women in room 19 a good six months after the raid.
The important point here was that the trial judge did take this into
consideration. It is apt to cite a key part of his ruling on this matter:

> > I am of the view that _**even without Liew’s identification evidence**_ ,
> the identification of Li and Dong as the two women sitting with Cheok, Liew
> and their friends at the material time had been properly established….Staff
> Sgt Oong Chun Chang corroborated Narcotics Officer Gopinathan’s evidence
> relating to the making of the arrest report (exhibit P10). According to the
> arrest report, (a) the two women arrested were Li Jin Hong and Dong Jing Yi,
> and (b) the two women were sitting together with Kwek Leng Kee (Kwek) and
> Ong Teng Koon (Ong) (the other two customers). During the trial, the defence
> did not challenge at all these aspects of the prosecution’s case. (my
> emphasis)

This, the trial judge stated, was enough to overcome the few inconsistencies
between the evidence of Liew, Cheok, and NO Gopinathan. There was nothing
submitted which should prompt this Court to second-guess the learned judge’s
findings on the matter.

26 The appellant’s third challenge as regards the second and third charges was
that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the
prosecution’s failure to call Li and Dong, and Kwek and Ong (the other two
customers) was not fatal to the prosecution’s case.

27 The trial judge specifically tackled the issue of the absence of these four
persons at trial. He stated, at para 44 of his grounds of decision:

> > I am of the opinion that the fact that neither Li, Dong, Kwek, nor Ong
> gave evidence did not create a lacuna in the Prosecution’s case as there was
> direct and credible evidence from other material witnesses.

With this statement in mind, the credibility of the material witnesses which
included Narcotics Officer Gopinathan and customer Cheok ought not to be
second-guessed by this Court.

28 The appellant’s fourth challenge as regards the second and third charges
was that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that Li and Dong
were serving customers and working in room 19. The issue here was that Li and
Dong were not registered – there was no dispute as to this. Couple this fact
with the following finding of the trial judge’s and it was very difficult to
allow such a claim by the appellant. At para 46 of his grounds of decision,
the trial judge stated:

> > There is clear evidence that Li and Dong were serving customers in KTV
> room 19. Both Cheok and Liew gave evidence that during their karaoke
> session, the women were (a) sitting with the customers, (b) pouring drinks
> for them, and (c) joining in the singing. Their evidence is corroborated by
> Narcotics Officer Gopinathan who testified that at the time of entering KTV
> room 19, he heard some loud music from the room. After entering, Narcotics
> Officer Gopinathan observed two women, later established to be Li and Dong,
> to be sitting with the customers and that there were some glasses and liquor
> bottles in the room.

The trial judge’s reservation toward Liew’s evidence was only limited to his
identification evidence as regards Li and Dong. Quite simply, therefore, the
women were not on the register but were pouring and serving the four men
drinks.

29 But could Li and Dong have been guests of the men? – Or could the two women
have entered the KTV lounge without the appellant’s management knowing about
it? However, it was clear that the trial judge was satisfied with the fact
that Li and Dong were not the guests of the four men, and there was no reason
why this court should differ from this conclusion. What about the theory that
Li and Dong could have slipped into the KTV Lounge? – The very testimony of
the appellant closed the door on such an argument. The following verbatim, at
page 47 of the notes of evidence (cross-examination of appellant), was
telling:

> > Q You have advised or alerted your reception staff to stop people from
> sneaking in to enjoy KTV facilities, at company’s expense?
>>

>> A Yes. Instructions given to reception to ascertain whether person entering
is a customer or otherwise.

>>

>> Q Often difficult to ensure no outsider enters KTV because you have only
three reception staff?

>>

>> A Disagree.

>>

>> Q At anytime, how many receptionists on duty at the counter?

>>

>> A At least one.

>>

>> Q Staff at counter would be able to see who enters?

>>

>> A Normally, we would have a captain to entertain them. If the receptionist
leads the customer to the rooms, the captain would be at the reception.

If the KTV Lounge was as tight in its procedure as to who was allowed in and
who was not, as the appellant suggested in his testimony, how then could Li
and Dong have slipped by the checks? The fact of the matter was that they did
not even need to sneak in, as their presence was known to the management. To
this end, I agreed with the trial judge’s assessment, at para 52 of his
grounds of decision, that:

> > On the totality of the evidence, I find that Li and Dong had been
> permitted to serve at the Lounge by the appellant and his management.

To argue that Dong and Li were free-lance hostesses and should therefore not
have to be registered in order to serve was to make a nonsense of the
registering condition. The register exists to keep track of the employment
arrangements in the lounge industry. If it were otherwise, there would only be
a handful of registered servers and a whole host of free-lancers. For these
reasons, this last contention of the appellant’s must fail.

30 The appellant’s record offered him no favours. He had been fined no less
than six times for breach of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act over a
period of 12 years. The last sentence was passed on 5 November 2001 for
providing public entertainment in contravention of a condition in a licence
under s18(1)(c) of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act. The fine of
$8500 was paid in full, as were all his other fines. Separate from his
breaches of the Public Entertainment Act was his selling of intoxicating
liquor to under aged persons in a licensed premises – for which he was fined
$800 on 4 January 1990. Again, he paid this fine in full. We must stop these
licensees from treating fines as part of their business losses. Such an
attitude belittles the law. A heavy fine will wake up licensees in the same
position as the appellant to the fact that fines too can be costly and, as a
deterrent sentence, the $27,000 fine imposed by the district judge is a good
start.

31 The appeal was dismissed.
