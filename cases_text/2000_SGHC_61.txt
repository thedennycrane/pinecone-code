**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

1 Syed Yasser Arafat bin Shaik Mohamed, the accused herein was charged and
tried before me on the following charge that:

> on or about the 5th day of August 1999, between 4.29 pm and 4.50 pm, in a
> taxi bearing registration number SHA 1043U at the junction of Lentor Avenue
> and Yishun Avenue 1, Singapore, he trafficked in a controlled drug specified
> in Class "A" of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185,
> to wit, by having in your possession 5 packets of diamorphine weighing 32.27
> grams (nett) for the purpose of trafficking, without any authorisation under
> the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed
> an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) and punishable under
> section 33 of the MDA.

2 The evidence led by the prosecution established that on 5 August 1999, at
about 3.50pm a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (‘CNB’)
comprising S/SSgt Tan Wu Chyuan (PS-20/PW-8) (‘S/SSgt Tan’) and Sgt Choo Thiam
Hock (PS-21/PW-3) were keeping watch on Blk 65, #05-337 Kallang Bahru,
Singapore. Subsequently, more CNB officers arrived and joined the watch on the
said unit.

3 At about 4.10pm on the same day, S/SSgt Tan saw a male Malay, later
identified as one Mohamed Daud Bin Salih, (‘Daud’) (PW-23) at the void deck of
Block 65 Kallang Bahru. At about 4.30pm one of the officers noticed an NTUC
taxi bearing the registration number SHA 1043U arrive at the entrance of Block
65A (a multi-storeyed carpark). Daud then boarded the said taxi from the front
passenger side, seated himself and waited.

4 Daud and the taxi driver, one Mak Keng Chin (PS-10/PW-7) both said that
shortly after Daud had boarded the taxi, the accused arrived, entered the said
taxi and occupied the rear passenger seat. The taxi driver said that the
accused had a bag with him then.

5 Daud further said that when he presently turned to the accused and asked for
the taxi’s destination, he noticed that the accused had a black and white
haversack (exh P-87) (‘the haversack or backpack’) by his side. The accused
told him that he wanted to proceed to Blk 243 Yishun Ring Road.

6 The CNB officers thereafter trailed the taxi from Kallang Bahru through PIE
(Jurong), CTE (Ang Mo Kio) and SLE (Yishun). Later, the taxi exited at Yishun
and travelled along Lentor Avenue.

7 At about 4.48pm that day, at the junction of Lentor Avenue and Yishun Avenue
1, the taxi was intercepted by the team of CNB officers. Daud was arrested and
handcuffed by Sgt Rahmat Bin Toleh (SPS-25/PW-14) at the front passenger seat
and was moved to the rear passenger seat, whilst another officer S/SSgt Tan
Yian Chye (PS-22/PW-9) (‘S/Sgt Tan’) arrested and handcuffed the accused at
the right rear passenger seat. S/SSgt Tan said that he saw the black and white
haversack (exh P-87) lay to the right of the accused. Thereafter, the taxi
driver was told to proceed to Yishun Avenue 1 near the sports complex where
Daud and the accused were kept under guard at the rear passenger seat of the
taxi by the CNB officers.

8 On the same day at about 5.00pm, S/SSgt Ronnie See Su Khoon (PS-28/PW-16)
and his party of officers comprising S/Sgt Ravi Vellu (PS-32/PW-15), Sgt Dean
Goh Teck Kiat (PS-30/PW-19), Sgt Mohd Noor Bin Mohd Zain (PS-29/PW-17), Sgt
Mohd Najid Bin Sairi (PS-33/PW-21), Cpl Larry Lee Keng Hiang (PS-34/PW-20) and
W/Cpl Nurmuhaini Binte Bakar (PS-31/PW-22) arrived at Yishun Avenue 1 to take
over the case from S/SSgt. Tan and the arresting party.

9 S/SSgt Ronnie See was briefed by S/SSgt Tan who pointed out to him the black
and white haversack (exh P-87) which was still next to the accused inside the
taxi. From outside the rear right of the taxi, S/SSgt Ronnie See proceeded to
unzip the said haversack and found in it five packets of granular substance
which he suspected to be heroin.

10 A search was then conducted on Daud and the accused. Amongst other things,
a bunch of 6 keys (exh P-88) was found on the accused person’s left trouser
pocket.

11 At about 5.55pm, Insp Soh Thiam Loon (‘Insp Soh’) (PS-46/PW-28) with his
party of officers (consisting of ASP Adam Fashe Huddin, S/Sgt Xavier and S/Sgt
Yayah) arrived at Yishun Avenue 1. Insp Soh then took over the case from
S/SSgt Ronnie See, who handed over, amongst other things, the black and white
haversack (exh P-87) and the bunch of six keys (exh P-88) which had earlier
been seized from the accused.

12 The prosecution’s evidence also established that later that day at about
6.20pm, Insp Soh and his party of officers together with S/SSgt Ronnie See’s
party of officers arrived at a flat situated at Blk 243 Yishun Ring Road,
#04-1145, with the accused and Daud. Once at the entrance of the flat, Insp
Soh handed over the bunch of six keys seized from the accused to S/Sgt Ravi
Vellu who opened the padlock and the main door of the said unit using two of
the six keys from the bunch.

13 In the ensuing search of the flat, the following items were found in a room
between the two bedrooms by W/Cpl Nurmuhaini:

> (i) In the left bottom drawer of a cabinet, two boxes of candles were
> seized;
>
> (ii) In the right bottom drawer of the same cabinet, the following were
> seized:
>

>> (a) a plastic container containing numerous empty sachets;

>>

>> (b) two stained pincers;

>>

>> (c) a digital weighing scale;

>>

>> (d) a plastic container containing a bowl with a knife and two spoons;

>>

>> (e) a box of candles;

>>

>> (f) a plastic container;

>>

>> (g) three stacks of envelopes; and

>>

>> (h) loose empty sachets in a plastic bag.

>
> (iii) In the right bottom drawer of the wardrobe, a straw of heroin wrapped
> with tin-foil was seized (marked exhs P-90 to P-93).

14 Scientific analysis carried out by the Department of Scientific Services
(DSS) established that the drugs found in the black haversack contained 32.27g
of diamorphine. There were altogether five packets inside the said bag and the
gross weight of the drugs seized amounted to 2,248.7g (see DSS Certificates as
in exhs P-56, P-57, P-58, P-59 and P-60 at pages 42 to 46 of the PI notes).

_**

Statements

**_

15 Besides the cautioned statement made by the accused on 6 August 1999 (exh
P-81 at page 278 of the PI notes), the prosecution sought to admit three other
statements recorded from the accused on 11 August, 14 August and 24 August
1999. The defence did not raise any objection to the admission of the
cautioned statement. In the said cautioned statement the accused said:

> I do not know anything about the stuff. That’s all.

16 However with regard to the other three statements, there were objections as
to their admission. Consequently, a trial within a trial ensued. At the _voir
dire_ , the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, namely, Insp Soh,
interpreter Sofia bte Sufri, S/Sgt Ronnie See, S/Sgt Patrick Phoa and S/Sgt
Xavier was that they never coerced, threatened, induced or made any promises
to the accused with a view to proffering any statements from him. The only
nick in the prosecution’s case was an admission by the interpreter Sofia that
during one of the recording sessions, whilst Insp Soh was in the process of
obtaining the personal particulars of the accused, she enquired from the
accused whether he was the brother of one Sharifah Imah, a woman who had been
involved in an unrelated previous drug offence. She asked him what had
happened to her. The accused replied that his sister had been discharged from
the capital case. The interpreter also said when she asked him about his
sister, the accused appeared surprised. The interpreter agreed with defence
counsel that questions were posed to the accused about the background of the
accused as well as his family members and when asked whether any incriminating
questions were put to the accused during the recording, she responded in the
affirmative.

17 In his evidence during the trial within a trial, the accused alleged that
the statements sought to be admitted were not made by him voluntarily and that
they were given under duress, threat, inducement and promises emanating from
various CNB officers. His allegations could be summarised as follows:

(a) On the day of arrest

> (i) Inside the taxi-cab shortly after his arrest:
>

>> _Allegation_ : He was questioned by S/Sgt Ronnie See in a stern manner.

> (ii) In the Yishun flat:

> > _Allegation_ : He was questioned by Insp Soh. Besides Insp Soh he was once
> pulled aside by a tall Malay officer (Adam Fashe Huddin) and was told he had
> better admit and co-operate since he was caught with evidence. The same
> officer also questioned him in a firm tone about the drugs seized. He
> maintained however that he did not know anything about the drugs.

(b) _6 August 1999_

> > _
>>

>> Allegation:

>>

>> _ After his cautioned statement had been completed, Insp Soh showed the
accused the photograph of the son as well as the girlfriend of the accused and
told him to think about their future, especially his son. Insp Soh told him to
co-operate otherwise he would recommend to the authorities the confiscation of
his flat where he was residing with his parents and son. His mind was not at
ease since he had only one son and both his parents were old. If the house
were to be confiscated they would have no roof over their heads. He felt
pressurised and confused.__

(c) _11 August 1999_

> > _
>>

>> Allegation:

>>

>> _ On this occasion interpreter Sofia asked him about his sister. She told
him that she had acted as the interpreter when his sister was facing a capital
charge. This fact was interpreted to Insp Soh. Whatever statement he made on
11 August 1999 was not made of his free will and not voluntarily given. By
giving the statement he was trying to save the best for his son, his parents
and the flat where he was residing.__

(d) _14 August 1999_ :

> > _Allegation_ : His mind was not at ease. He believed whatever Insp Soh
> told him about his son and house on 6 August 1999. He therefore gave a
> statement which was by way of questions and answers. Insp Soh questioned him
> about his past. After the statement had been completed, Insp Soh told him to
> think about the charge he was facing. Insp Soh told him this time too that
> he was going to recommend the confiscation of his house because most of his
> siblings were all involved in drug offences. The interpreter was not present
> at the time when Insp Soh told him this. The accused was afraid. He believed
> Insp Soh was serious because this was the second occasion he had told him
> so. The statement he made on 14 August 1999 was involuntary.

(e) _24 August 1999_

> > _
>>

>> Allegation:

>>

>> _ Again this was a question and answer session. Whenever he went out of
line or forgot events, he was corrected by Insp Soh and the interpreter. The
questions and answers were also in reference to his brothers’ and sisters’
drug history as well. The statement given by him on 24 August 1999 was
involuntary.__

18 It is a settled principle that the prosecution would have to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the statements which it sought to admit were made
voluntarily without any of the vitiating elements of threat, inducement,
promise or oppression. The law as regards statements made to CNB officers is
governed by s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). In this regard, it is
instructive to recite the principles pithily set out by Yong Pung How CJ in
_**Gulam bin Notar Shariff Jamalddin v Public Prosecutor**_ [1999] 2 SLR 181
at 203 (CA) where he said:

> The admissibility of the … statements is governed by s 24 of the Evidence
> Act which reads:
>

>> A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant if the making of the
confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat
or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person,
proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the
court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable
for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil
of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him.

>
> Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact: _Tan Boon Tat v PP_
> [1992] 2 SLR 1, following _DPP v Ping Lin_ [1975] 3 All ER 175. It is also
> well established that the common law concept of involuntariness by
> oppression in _R v Prager_ (1972) 56 Cr App R 51 has been subsumed under s
> 24 of the Evidence Act. The test for determining admissibility under s 24 is
> first, whether the confession was made as a consequence of any inducement,
> threat or promise, and second, whether in making that confession, the
> accused did so in circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, would
> have led him reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage for
> himself or would avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself. Both are
> questions of fact and are matters of judicial evaluation: see _Seow Choon
> Meng v PP_ [1994] 2 SLR 853 and _Tan Boon Tat v PP_ [1992] 2 SLR 1,
> following _DPP v Ping Lin_ [1975] 3 All ER 175. The test of voluntariness is
> applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The
> objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and
> the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the
> mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment
> connected with the charge: _Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP_ [1983] 2 MLJ 232
> and _Mohd Desa bin Hashim v PP_ [1995] 3 MLJ 350. Where voluntariness is
> challenged, the burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable
> doubt that the confession was made voluntarily and not on the defence to
> prove on a balance of probabilities that the confession was not made
> voluntarily: _Koh Aik Siew v PP_ [1993] 2 SLR 599. However, the accused need
> only raise a reasonable doubt or, in other words, it is only necessary for
> the prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat,
> inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants
> of fear: _Panya Martmontree v PP_ [1995] 3 SLR 341.

19 Also in _**Poh Kay Keong v Public Prosecutor**_ [1996] 1 SLR 209, the
Singapore Court of Appeal in allowing the appeal of the accused and in the
process reversing the trial court’s finding that the statements given by the
accused were voluntary, held at page 210:

> (1) The purpose or object of s 24 of the Evidence Act was to ensure the
> reliability of a confession. This was founded on the premise that a
> confession brought about as a result of an inducement, threat or promise was
> not reliable and should be excluded. Giving s 24 a purposive construction,
> an inducement, threat or promise ‘had reference to the charge against the
> accused person’ if it was made to obtain a confession relevant or relating
> to the charge in question. Similarly, the ‘advantage’ or ‘evil’ had
> ‘reference to the proceedings against an accused person’, if it was gained
> or avoided (as the case may be) by the making of a statement relevant or
> relating to the charge brought against the appellant (see pp 220B-D,
> 221D-G); _Ibrahim v R_ [1914] AC 599 and _Customs and Excise Commissioners v
> Harz & Anor_ [1967] AC 760 followed.

20 Bearing the foregoing principles in mind, I proceeded to evaluate the
evidence adduced at the trial within a trial. In the main, the question before
me was whether Insp Soh did utter the words ascribed to him by the accused and
if he did, whether those words had the effect of negativing the voluntariness
of the statements referred to.

21 Insofar as the prosecution witnesses were concerned – save for an intrusive
and unwarranted enquiry by the interpreter which I had earlier adverted to -
no vitiating comments, threats, inducements or promises were ever made to the
accused either during or before the commencement of the recording of the
statements. Their evidence was by and large consistent and free from any
significant inconsistency. However, the claim of the accused, I must say, was
replete with contradictions and inconsistencies, some of which were major and
they could be summarised as follows:

> (i) It was put to Insp Soh by the defence that after the interpreter had
> left the interview room on 6 August 1999, Insp Soh told the accused that he
> knew the background of his family members. But when the accused was asked
> during his cross-examination whether Insp Soh told him that he knew of his
> family background, the accused answered in the negative.
>
> (ii) It was further put to Insp Soh by the defence that after 6 August 1999
> and before 11 August 1999, Insp Soh had an opportunity to meet the accused
> and he reminded him again to ‘better co-operate’. In this connection, Insp
> Soh was specifically asked whether he had met the accused on 7 August 1999
> when the accused and Daud were taken out of lock-up. Insp Soh denied the
> allegation. But when the accused was asked by the prosecution during his
> cross-examination whether he had met Insp Soh after 6 August 1999 and before
> the recording of the statement on 11 August 1999, his answer was in the
> negative.
>
> (iii) It was further put to Insp Soh that on 11 August 1999 he once again
> reminded the accused: ‘Think about your child. Give me a good statement and
> I will know what to do for you.’ Insp Soh denied this allegation. It was
> further put to Insp Soh that he told the accused: ‘the drugs belong (sic) to
> Hamal. I know about this. Better co-operate.’ However when the accused was
> asked during his cross-examination whether Insp Soh uttered the words ‘Think
> about your child, give me a good statement and I will know what to do for
> you’, his reply was: ‘He never mentioned about this.’ When he was asked
> whether on 11 August 1999 Insp Soh mentioned anything about the ownership of
> the drugs, his reply was in the negative.
>
> (iv) It was further put to Insp Soh by the defence that he threatened the
> accused on 14 August 1999 before the interpreter came in. But the evidence
> of the accused in his examination-in-chief contradicted what was put to Insp
> Soh. The accused maintained all along that when he went into the room of
> Insp Soh on 14 August 1999, interpreter Sofia was already there. It was also
> put to Insp Soh by defence counsel that on 14 August 1999, he told the
> accused that the six keys seized from him belonged to the flat at Yishun
> Ring Road and he had better co-operate. Insp Soh however disagreed. Here
> again when the accused was asked in cross-examination whether Insp Soh said
> anything to him about the keys on 14 August 1999, he answered that he could
> not recall.
>
> (v) Above all, when asked by the court whether on the 14 or on 24 August
> 1999 Insp Soh put pressure on him by mentioning the possibility of the
> confiscation of his flat or the matter concerning his family members, the
> accused simply answered that he could not recall.

22 Having reviewed all the evidence and having observed the witnesses, I was
of the view that the prosecution had indeed proven that the statements
recorded on 11, 14 and 24 August 1999 were voluntarily made by the accused.
The intrusion of the interpreter, although improper and merited a stricture,
did not in my view bring about any pressure on the accused. In the end, I was
satisfied that the three statements sought to be admitted were voluntarily
made without being tainted by threat, inducement or any element of oppresion.
Consequently, I admitted those statements after being assured by the learned
DPP and defence counsel that irrelevant and possibly prejudicial matters
appearing in the statements had been excised.

23 Relevant segments of the statements admitted read as follows:

> **_
>
> _(1)_Paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the statement recorded on 11 August 1999
> (exh P-84A):_**

24 At the close of the prosecution’s case, the learned DPP offered altogether
19 witnesses and also made available to the defence Hamal, who was initially a
co-accused in this trial but had been dealt with separately upon his pleading
guilty to a reduced charge before another court. He was the tenant and the
other occupant of the Yishun Ring Road flat where, amongst other things, drug
trafficking paraphernalia had been recovered.

25 Defence counsel did not make any submission at the close of the
prosecution’s case The learned DPP, relying on (a) the seizure of the five
packets of drugs inside the black haversack found next to the accused, which
on analysis were found to contain 32.27g of diamorphine; (b) the evidence of
Daud and the taxi driver that the accused was in possession of the said
haversack when he boarded the taxi; and (c) the admissions of the accused as
contained in the statements that he was in possession of the drugs found in
the haversack and that he intended to deal with them, submitted that a _prima
facie_ case had been made out against the accused which if unrebutted would
warrant his conviction.

26 Having considered all the evidence, even if the statements admitted as
being voluntarily made were to be disregarded, I was satisfied that the
prosecution had made out a case against the accused on the charge, which if
unrebutted would warrant his conviction. Consequently I called upon the
accused to enter his defence; the standard allocution was administered and he
was explained the courses open to him. The accused however elected to remain
silent. Notwithstanding an adjournment granted to reconsider his decision, he
still elected to remain silent and did not wish to call any witnesses on his
behalf. His counsel also did not make any submission, admittedly upon his
instructions.

Final speech

27 The learned DPP’s final speech was by and large similar in substance to his
address at the close of the prosecution’s case. Despite the silence of the
accused, I reviewed all the evidence presented and considered the submissions
by the DPP.

_**

Findings and conclusion

**_

28 The standard allocution administered to the accused contained a mandatory
warning that his refusal to give evidence might lead to adverse inferences as
appear proper as provided under s 196(2) of the CPC. Section 196(2) of the CPC
provides as follows:

> **196.** -(1) …
>

>> **

>>

>> **(2) If the accused –

>>

>>> (a) after being called upon by the court to give evidence or after he or
the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will give
evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed; or

>>>

>>> (b) having been sworn or affirmed, without good cause refuses to answer
any question,

>
> the court, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence
> charged, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper.

29 Section 196(2) of the CPC was introduced in Singapore in 1976 by amendments
to the CPC following recommendations by the UK Criminal Law Revision Committee
in its 11th Report. The Committee’s recommendation is contained in para 111 of
the Report and it is reproduced hereunder:

> … At present the failure of the accused to give evidence is not allowed to
> be treated as corroboration. We disagree with this rule. It seems to us
> clearly right that, when the prosecution have adduced sufficient evidence of
> a fact to be considered by the jury or magistrates’ court, the failure of
> the accused to give evidence denying the fact should be capable of
> corroborating the evidence of it. Admittedly, if the case is one where
> corroboration is required by law and the prosecution have not enough
> corroborative evidence to adduce, they may be unable to start the
> proceedings, because they will not know whether the accused will or will not
> give evidence; but there may be other corroborative evidence, and failure to
> give evidence will add to this. In any event the question relates also to
> where corroboration, though desirable, is not required as a matter of law.

30 In my view, s 196(2) of the CPC had not introduced any new concept to the
way the law was administered in our criminal courts. Prevalent judicial
approach prior to the introduction of that section could be gleaned from a
decision by the Federation of Malaya Court of Appeal in _**Chan Chwen Kong v
Public Prosecutor**_ [1962] 28 MLJ 307 where Thomson CJ observed at page 308:

> … In most criminal cases there is at some stage an onus of a sort upon the
> accused person. Once the prosecution produces evidence which if believed
> would support a conviction there is a tactical onus on the accused person
> either to produce evidence of his own or to point to something in the
> prosecution evidence that at the very lowest make the trier of fact less
> than sure of any conclusions he might otherwise be prepared to base upon the
> prosecution evidence. If he fails to discharge that tactical onus he will be
> convicted. …

31 The accused’s considered decision not to give evidence in his defence meant
that he had failed to discharge the tactical onus placed on him.

32 In my finding, the prosecution had indeed proven beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused was in possession of the drugs which contained 32.27g of
diamorphine. This unchallenged aspect immediately raised the presumptions as
contained in ss 17, 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the MDA. By electing to remain
silent and neglecting to explain how he came to be in possession of the
offending drugs the accused had clearly failed to discharge the burden of
rebutting the presumptions adverted to on a balance of probabilities. After
reviewing all the evidence, I was satisfied that even without the need to
resorting to the statements admitted at the trial within a trial, the
prosecution had discharged its ultimate burden in proving its case against the
accused beyond a reasonable doubt. In the result, I found the accused guilty
of the charge he faced, convicted him and sentenced him to the only punishment
prescribed under the law.

Dated this 19th day of April 2000.
