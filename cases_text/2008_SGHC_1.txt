Chan Seng Onn J:

1 Lee Seng Cheong (“Lee”), the first plaintiff, was close friends with the
defendant, Seah Bak Seng, for more than 40 years. The second to eighth
plaintiffs were the relatives, friends and colleagues of Lee. The defendant
was the executive director of Fotronics Corporation Sdn Bhd (“Fotronics”), a
company incorporated in Malaysia.

2 In 2004, Fotronics was seeking to list its shares in the Malaysian MESDAQ
market. The requisite approvals from the Malaysian authorities to list the
shares were obtained in July 2004. The defendant informed Lee that, being an
executive director, the defendant would be allotted a substantial number of
shares. The defendant asked Lee if he was interested in purchasing these
shares. Lee allegedly indicated to the defendant that he and his relatives and
friends would like to buy the shares with a view to selling them for a quick
profit at the date of listing or soon thereafter.

3 Subsequently, some of the plaintiffs entered into written agreements with
the defendant for the purchase of Fotronics shares. The particulars of these
agreements were set out at paragraph 5 of the Amended Statement of Claim dated
31 January 2007 as follows:

_No._ |  _Name_ |  _Date_ |  _No. of Shares_ |  _Price per Share_  
---|---|---|---|---  
1. |  Lee Seng Cheong |  11.08.2004 |  270,000 |  RM 1.00  
2. |  Lee Seng Cheong |  11.08.2004 |  400,000 |  RM 1.00  
3. |  See Chak Wah |  11.08.2004 |  50,000 |  RM 1.00  
4. |  Tan Kian Heng |  11.08.2004 |  50,000 |  RM 1.00  
5. |  Ramasamy Somasundaram |  11.08.2004 |  50,000 |  RM 1.00  
6. |  Lee Sea Kian |  11.08.2004 |  100,000 |  RM 1.00  
7. |  Chia Wang Nor |  11.08.2004 |  20,000 |  RM 1.00  
8. |  Sim Eng Chee |  11.08.2004 |  10,000 |  RM 1.00  
  
It should be noted that See Chak Wah (No. 3) was not a plaintiff in this
action.

4 Apart from the above written agreements, the plaintiffs also alleged that
the defendant orally agreed to sell additional Fotronics shares to some of
them. The particulars of these oral agreements were set out at paragraph 7 of
the Amended Statement of Claim as follows:

|  **_Name_** |  **_Date_** |  **_No. of Shares_** |  **_Price per Share_**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1. |  Cheong Yin Yuen |  10/8/2004 |  80,000 |  RM 1.00  
|  |  11/9/2004 |  |   
2. |  Puan Chew Motor Works |  Sept 2004 |  300,000 |  RM 1.00  
3. |  Loo Yuh Huey |  Aug 2004 |  50,000 |  RM 1.00  
4. |  Loo Yuh Huey |  25 Jan 2005 |  50,000 |  RM 1.20  
5. |  Lee Seng Cheong |  25 Jan 2005 |  300,000 |  RM 1.20  
  
It should be noted that Puan Chew Motor Works (“PCMW”) (No. 2) was not a
plaintiff in this action. Also, there was in fact a written agreement dated 11
August 2004 (AB19) evidencing the sale of 50,000 shares to Loo Yuh Huey (No.3)
in August 2004. During the course of the trial, the plaintiffs admitted that
the figures presented in the Amended Statement of Claim were not entirely
accurate. They sought to amend the Amended Statement of Claim after the close
of the defendant’s case. I will deal with that later.

5 The plaintiffs made payments for the share purchases listed above (in [3]
and [4]) by way of cheques for the equivalent amounts in Singapore dollars
except for the share purchase by Lee Sea Kian, which was paid for in Malaysian
Ringgit (“RM”).

6 The written agreements were signed as early as August 2004 because the
original intended listing date was to be in September 2004. However, due to
several delays, the shares were only listed on 31 January 2005. At the time of
listing, the market price of the shares was RM 1.40 per share and rose to a
high of RM 1.48.

7 It was the plaintiffs’ case that the shares were to be delivered before
listing date, _viz,_ 31 January 2005. Such delivery was not effected. When the
plaintiffs asked for their shares on 31 January 2005, the defendant told them
that the shares were not ready for delivery. It should be noted that the
contracts were silent as to the date the shares were to be delivered to the
plaintiffs.

8 By February 2005, the share price had fallen below RM 1.40 per share. The
defendant still had not delivered the shares. Lee testified that he had
demanded the plaintiffs’ shares from the defendant on several occasions but
the defendant failed to deliver the same. Despite the defendant’s failure to
deliver, Lee entered into another oral agreement with the defendant in
February 2005 to purchase 400,000 shares at RM 1.00 per share. At that time,
the share price was RM 1.08. The purpose of the transaction was for Lee to
sell these shares for a profit of RM 0.08 per share. Lee issued two cheques
dated 14 and 21 February 2005 to pay for these share purchases. According to
Lee, the defendant was to deliver the shares immediately but he failed to do
so.

9 On 13 April 2005, the defendant transferred 2,050,000 Fotronics shares into
Lee’s share account. Lee only found out about this when he received a contract
note (AB32) from Avenue Securities Sdn Bhd (“Avenue”), a firm of sharebrokers.
The price of the shares had fallen below RM 1.00 by this time. Upon the
defendant’s advice, these shares were subsequently transferred to Commerce
International Merchant Bankers Berhad (CIMB). It should be noted that not all
of the 2,050,000 shares belonged to the plaintiffs. The defendant had
deposited additional shares in Lee’s account. Apparently, the defendant told
Lee that “Somebody’s share is in your account” (NE p 70).

10 It will be recalled that PCMW ([4] _supra_) had purchased 300,000 shares.
Lim Puan Chew, the owner of PCMW, was unhappy with the defendant’s late
delivery and demanded that Lee resolve the matter quickly. In July 2005, Lim
Puan Chew and Lee met the defendant and his brother, one Seah Bak Kheow, in
the defendant’s office in Singapore. There were differing accounts as to what
transpired at that meeting. The plaintiffs’ version was that the defendant
agreed to refund PCMW the full purchase price of its shares. However, in order
to prevent other plaintiffs from making similar demands for refunds from the
defendant, the defendant issued a cash cheque and instructed Lee to deposit it
first into Lee’s own bank account, and thereafter Lee was to issue his own
cheque to refund the money to PCMW. The amount of the cash cheque made out by
the defendant for the refund, which was in Singapore dollars, matched the
amount of the cheque in Singapore dollars issued by PCMW to pay for its
purchase of the shares. Lee signed an acknowledgement that the monies were on
loan to him and the money would be repaid in 12 monthly instalments with
interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum. Lee asserted that the acknowledgement
was signed under duress. Lee only made the first interest payment of S$852 and
stopped making subsequent interest payments. Lee claimed _inter alia_ the
return of S$852 in this action.

11 The defendant presented another version of the facts. At the meeting, the
defendant had allegedly told Lim Puan Chew to seek redress from Lee as there
was no contract between PCMW and the defendant. Following the meeting, the
defendant agreed to help Lee obtain a loan from Bumiputra Commerce Bank to
repay Lim Puan Chew. When that loan application was rejected, the defendant
claimed that he extended to Lee a loan for the sum of S$136,364 to be repaid
in 12 monthly instalments with the interest rate of 7.5% per annum.

12 In paragraph 11 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs claimed
_inter alia_ the return of the purchase price (as set out in [3] and [4]
above) and damages as set out below:

**_No._** |  **_Name_** |  **_Particulars  
Purchase Price (RM)_** |  **_Loss of Profit at RM 0.40  
per share_**  
---|---|---|---  
1 |  Lee Seng Cheong |  400,000 |  160,000  
2 |  Lee Seng Cheong |  270,000 |  108,000  
3 |  Lee Seng Cheong |  300,000 |  60,000  
4 |  Cheong Yin Yuen |  80,000 |  32,000  
5 |  Tan Kian Heng |  50,000 |  20,000  
6 |  Ramasamy Somsasundaram |  50,000 |  20,000  
7 |  Loo Yuh Huey |  50,000 |  20,000  
8 |  Loo Yuh Huey |  50,000 |  10,000 at RM 0.20  
9 |  Lee Sea Kian |  100,000 |  40,000  
10 |  Chia Wang Nor |  20,000 |  8,000  
11 |  Sim Eng Chee |  10,000 |  4,000  
  
and

**_No._** |  **_Name_** |  **_Particulars

---|---|---|---  
1 |  Lee Seng Cheong |  400,000 |  RM 32,000  
  
13 The defendant’s sole defence was that the parties had orally agreed that
the shares would only be transferred or delivered to Lee when Lee, who was
representing all the other plaintiffs, called upon the defendant to do so. The
defendant alleged that at no time before 13 April 2005 (when the shares were
finally transferred) were any such instructions given to the defendant. In his
affidavit, the defendant averred that since no instructions had been
forthcoming from Lee for some months, he decided on his own accord sometime on
or about 13 April 2005 that he should not hold on any longer to the shares and
should instead transfer the shares purchased by Lee and the other plaintiffs
to Lee’s share account, which eventually he did. Therefore, the defendant
argued that he had not breached the contracts by transferring the 2,050,000
shares to Lee on 13 April 2005. The defendant instituted a counterclaim for
the repayment of the loan to Lee and for RM 104,409.63, being the purchase
price of 400,000 Fotronics shares that the defendant had allegedly purchased
on Lee’s behalf between November 2005 and December 2005. Lee denied having
knowledge of any such purchase.

14 On 10 October 2007, I allowed the plaintiffs’ claim in part and dismissed
the defendant’s counterclaim. I ordered as follows:

a. The defendant is to return to the plaintiffs the purchase price in
Malaysian Ringgit for the shares purchased by the first plaintiff on behalf of
himself and the others as set out in exhibit P2 less the RM 300,000 paid for
the shares of Puan Chew Motor Works Pte Ltd. The total amount to be restituted
by the defendant to the plaintiffs is RM 1,520,000. Interest is to be awarded
at 6% per annum from the respective dates of payment (as evidenced by the
respective dates of the cheques for payment of the shares) to 1 April 2007,
and thereafter at 5.33% per annum to the date of judgment;

b. The first plaintiff is to transfer 2,050,000 shares to the defendant,
inclusive of all resulting stock splits and repay all dividends received (if
any) for all the shares. Interest on the dividends (if any) is awarded at 6%
per annum from the date of receipt of the dividends to 1 April 2007, and
thereafter at 5.33% per annum to the date of judgment;

c. The defendant is to return S$852 with interest as from 5 September 2005 at
6% per annum to 1 April 2007, and thereafter at 5.33% per annum to the date of
judgment;

d. The balance of the plaintiffs’ claim, inclusive of their claim for loss of
profit, is disallowed;

e. The defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed with costs; and

f. Costs are to be taxed, if not agreed.

The defendant has since appealed against my decision and I now give my reasons
for making the above orders.

Purchases made by each plaintiff

15 During the course of the trial, it became apparent that the particulars of
the share purchases in the plaintiffs’ Amended Statement of Claim dated 31
January 2007 were inaccurate. This was because the total number of shares as
pleaded added up to 2,130,000 shares, which was way in excess of the 1,750,000
shares that Lee later agreed the plaintiffs, PCMW and See Chak Wah, had
purchased in total (NE p 62). During the trial, Lee tendered a document
(marked as Exhibit P2) which matched the cheques to the respective purchasers
and the shares purchased. P2 is reproduced as follows:

* RM 1.20 per share

16 According to this table, the total number of shares purchased would be
1,750,000 shares. I accepted the figures produced in P2 as accurate. It should
be borne in mind that the purchases in Items 6 and 7 were made by PCMW and See
Chak Wah respectively, who did not join as plaintiffs to the present action.
During cross-examination, Lee testified that he had reimbursed See Chak Wah in
full for the latter’s shares (NE p 40). This was not disputed by the
defendant. As stated before, PCMW was also paid back in full for the shares it
had purchased.

17 The inaccuracies in the numbers had arisen because under the written
agreements dated 11 August 2004, Lee had purchased some shares on behalf of
Cheong Yin Yuen and PCMW. Thus, of the two written contracts that Lee entered
into on 11 August 2004 for the purchase of a total of 670,000 shares (items 1
and 2 of [3] _supra_), Lee had only purchased 290,000 shares (30,000 + 40,000
+ 220,000) for himself. The remaining 380,000 shares were purchased on behalf
of PCMW (300,000 shares) and Cheong Yin Yuen (80,000 shares). Items 1 and 2 of
paragraph 5 in the plaintiffs’ Amended Statement of Claim ([4] _supra_) were
therefore inaccurate as they duplicated the shares of PCMW and Cheong Yin
Yuen. I found that the plaintiffs had purchased a total of 1,400,000 shares.
Adding PCMW’s 300,000 shares and See Chak Wah’s 50,000 shares, the total
number of shares purchased from the defendant was 1,750,000.

18 In the appendix to their closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs
tendered a re-amended Statement of Claim which purportedly contained the
correct figures. I rejected the re-amended Statement of Claim as counsel had
not tendered a formal application to effect the amendments sought and, in any
event, the application was made too late in the day. During the trial, I made
it very clear that any amendments to the Statement of Claim had to be by way
of a formal application (NE p 98 line 15). A re-amended Statement of Claim
attached as an appendix to closing submissions did not constitute a formal
application. In any case, I did not think that the figures pleaded in the re-
amended Statement of Claim were accurate. I will now discuss whether the
defendant had breached the agreements with the plaintiffs and if so, the
remedies that the plaintiffs were entitled to.

Shares purchased before the listing date of 31 January 2005

19 I will first deal with the shares that were purchased by the plaintiffs
before the listing date (the “Pre-Listing Shares”). These form items 1 to 15
of the table at [15] above (excluding items 6 and 7).

20 I found that the defendant had breached the contracts to sell the Pre-
Listing Shares to the plaintiffs. The purpose of buying these shares from the
defendant was to enable the plaintiffs to make a quick profit by selling the
shares on the listing date or shortly thereafter should the share price be
higher than the purchase price. The Pre-Listing Shares were thus purchased and
fully paid for _before_ the listing date. The plaintiffs in this case were not
institutional or sophisticated investors or long term investors. Rather, they
were small-time investors hoping to make a ‘quick buck’. It was highly
unlikely that the defendant did not know this. After all, Lee and the
defendant had known each other for over 40 years. Lee regularly visited the
defendant’s office in Singapore. Lee must have conveyed the plaintiffs’
intentions at some time or other when the transactions were being discussed
with the defendant.

21 I therefore found that there was an implied term in the agreements between
the plaintiffs and the defendant that the latter would deliver the Pre-Listing
Shares before the date of listing, or at the very latest, on the day of
listing. Such an implied term would give business efficacy to the agreements.
I believed Lee’s evidence that he had in fact instructed the defendant two
days before the listing date, on the listing day itself, and repeatedly
thereafter to sell or transfer the plaintiffs’ shares to him so that he and
the other plaintiffs could sell the shares. I found the defendant’s defence
that he received no instructions whatsoever from the plaintiffs to be wholly
unconvincing, particularly in light of the fact that the share price on the
first day of trading was well above the purchase price, which would have
enabled the plaintiffs to make a quick and fairly handsome profit. It was
unlikely that all eight plaintiffs would have stood by and done nothing for 2
½ months from 31 January 2005 to 13 April 2005 while the opportunity to reap
the profits by selling the listed shares on the MESDAQ was dissolving before
their very eyes and quickly turning into losses as the weeks went by. The
defendant’s defence suggested that at the time of listing and during the
entire period when the market price of the shares was still above RM 1.00, not
even _one_ of the eight plaintiffs wanted to sell the shares to make a quick
profit. I found this highly implausible. I found that the defendant had acted
in breach of the contracts by delivering the shares extremely late on 13 April
2005, by which time the share price had dropped to about RM 0.90 per share (AB
32).

Shares purchased in February 2005

22 About two weeks after the listing of the shares, Lee purchased an
additional 400,000 shares in February 2005 from the defendant at RM 1.00 per
share (the “February 2005 Agreement”). At that time, the market price of the
share was RM 1.08 per share. It was the plaintiffs’ case that the 400,000
shares were to be delivered immediately. On 14 February 2005, he paid for his
purchase of the 300,000 shares (AB 30 and P2). On 21 February 2005, he paid
for the balance of the 100,000 shares (AB 31 and P2) that he had purchased.

23 I found that there was an implied term in the February 2005 Agreement that
upon the defendant’s receipt of the payment of the purchase price for the
400,000 shares, the shares were to be delivered immediately or soon thereafter
to Lee. It could not possibly have been in the reasonable contemplation of any
party to such a transaction that the traded shares purchased were meant to be
delivered several weeks or an indefinite time after receipt of full payment,
particularly when the market price at that time was only RM 0.08 above the
price Lee paid for the shares and the share price was already quite volatile
at that time. Obviously, Lee intended to have the shares delivered to him
immediately or as soon as possible so that he could sell them quickly to
profit from the small price differential. However, these shares were delivered
more than seven weeks later on 13 April 2005. I found that the defendant had
therefore acted in breach of the February 2005 Agreement by failing to deliver
these shares immediately or soon after Lee had paid for them.

Alleged Loan Agreement in July 2005

24 Before discussing the remedies available to the plaintiffs, I should add a
few words about the alleged loan agreement in July 2005. In my view, the
alleged loan agreement was not a genuine one but merely a method devised by
the defendant to mask the true nature of the transaction, _viz_ to refund PCMW
for the 300,000 Fotronics shares it had purchased (through Lee’s assistance)
from the defendant. During cross-examination, Lee testified as follows:

A: This Puan Chew Motor actually I suffered a lot, day and night kept calling
me, pressing very hard on me that, you know, what happened to the shares. So I
was thinking, since I’ve already reim-reimbursed See Chak Wah. I don’t know, I
told ---I approached the defendant. I said, “Look, I cannot take it anymore”.
Since then I lost my sleep almost every night even until yesterday. So the
important thing now is to settle with Puan Chew. I couldn’t take it anymore.
Perhaps I think go and look for a bank and, er, you know, get the loan settled
with him first. I was actually trying to help the defendant. Maybe that is the
--- the only solution, if he doesn’t have the money to pay Puan Chew.

…

A What you should do now, sometimes in the middle of 2005, I really cannot
take it any more and told Puan Chew, “Look, you know the defendant and his
younger brother who was the chairman of Fotronics also. You know them very
well also, why not I take you to their office. You go and settle among
themselves”. Puan Chew agreed. And, er, I was there. Puan Chew --- there was
Lim Puan Chew and the defendant and his younger brother, four of them --- four
of us in the chairman’s office, locked up. And, er Puan Chew started asking
back for money, asked --- at first he asked for, “What happened to the shares?
Who sold the --- my shares at four--- 1.40 and above? And now the share price
had dropped so much, I want back my money.” So the defendant and the young –
and the younger brother, the chairman agreed, “I give you full refund, okay,
ask Puan Chew to come and collect the full amount one week later.” I went
to--- because I --- I was with them most of the time. I went one week later
and the defendant gave me a cheque, full amount, hundred and thirty over
thousand dollars. I got the cheque, I was very happy.

Ct Payable to whom? Cheque was payable to whom, this hun---one---

A Payable to this, er, Puan Chew Motor.

Ct And then?

A I was very happy. At least I solved one problem. Got the cheque, I said,
“Let me run across the road”. Puan Chew’s workshop just across the road,
across the office only. I delivered the cheque but I was stopped.

Ct Stopped by who?

A No. You signed here, acknowledge --- acknowledge re--- receipt of this
amount and put down that this money was actually, you know, a loan that he
arranged for me and charged me at seven and a half per cent per annum. My
goodness and told me: “Bank in this cheque into your account. You issue a
cheque, pay to Puan Chew tomorrow”. I said, “What is the purpose of doing
this? You just give the cheque, refund to him, that’s it”. _But I was told
that, “No, no, no. If other people were to know, they will also come after
him. To---in order to avoid all these things, all these troubles, no, you bank
into your account”._

[emphasis added]

It should be clarified that the cheque in question was a cash cheque for
S$136,364 (AB 37) and not a cheque made payable to PCMW. That was why Lee was
able to deposit the cheque into his account before re-issuing a cheque (AB 38)
from his bank account for the same amount to PCMW.

25 I found Lee to be a credible witness. I accepted Lee’s testimony that the
defendant devised this method of payment because he wanted to prevent other
plaintiffs from learning that PCMW had succeeded in getting a refund directly
from the defendant and he did not want the other plaintiffs to similarly hound
him for refunds. I believed that Lee had acknowledged the loan agreement
because he was under tremendous stress at that time as Lim Puan Chew kept
pressing Lee for the money. Counsel for the defendant contended that there was
no reason for the defendant to refund PCMW the money as the contract was
between the defendant and Lee, not PCMW. I was not convinced by this technical
argument. Clearly, the defendant knew that it was PCMW and not Lee who
purchased the 300,000 shares at RM 1.00 per share from him. If at all, Lee was
merely acting as the agent for PCMW (a disclosed principal) in the purchase of
these shares from the defendant. It should be noted that payment to the
defendant for the purchase price was by way of a cheque dated 11 September
2004 from PCMW (and not from Lee) for S$136,364 (the equivalent of the
purchase price of RM300,000 at that time). It would have been clear to the
defendant that it was PCMW and not Lee who was paying him for the purchase of
the 300,000 shares. At paragraph 24 of the defendant’s affidavit, the
defendant in fact acknowledged that Lim Puan Chew was one of the other buyers
of the shares from him. On evaluation of the evidence as a whole, I found that
the cash cheque (AB 37) was not a loan to Lee but in truth, a refund of the
purchase price by the defendant to PCMW for the 300,000 shares which the
defendant failed to deliver by the listing date as agreed. Consequently, I
ordered the defendant to return S$852 to Lee with interest to run from 5
September 2005, the date on which that sum was paid.

Remedies

**_Time of the Essence_**

26 In the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs claimed _inter alia_ the
return of the purchase price _and_ loss of profits on the shares they had
purchased from the defendant. I allowed the plaintiffs’ claim for the return
of the purchase price but disallowed the claim for loss of profits. I also
ordered the plaintiff to transfer 2,050,000 shares (inclusive of stock splits
and dividends) back to the defendant. I should add at the outset that counsel
cited no authorities to assist me on the general principles of law that were
applicable to this case.

27 In my view, time was of the essence in relation to the contracts in
question, _viz,_ the contracts for the purchase of the Pre-Listing Shares and
the February 2005 Agreement. It is established law that in contracts for the
sale and purchase of securities traded in a securities exchange, time is
generally of the essence of the contract with regards to payment of the
purchase price by the purchaser to the vendor and the delivery or transfer of
the shares by the vendor to the purchaser, as the prices of such shares would
be subject to fluctuations not only from day to day but also within each
trading day: _Re_  _Schwabcher_ (1908) 98 LT 127; _Hare v Nicoll_ [1966] 2 QB
130 (“ _Hare_ ”) at 147; _Huang Chang Hsun Francis v Hwang & Yusoff Securities
Sdn Bhd_ [1992] 2 MLJ 305. This was particularly true where the share prices
were volatile and the shares were of a highly speculative nature and liable to
considerable fluctuations in value: _Hare_ at 142; _Grant v Lapid Developments
Ltd_ [1996] BCC 410 at 415. I had already found that it was an implied term
that the Pre-Listing Shares were to be delivered to the plaintiffs by the
listing day. On the facts, clearly the price of Fotronics shares was already
volatile from the first day of listing on the MESDAQ. It was thus crucial that
those shares were transferred to the plaintiffs on or before the listing date
so that the plaintiffs could sell, as and when they desired, the shares which
they had already paid for in full well before the listing date. Time was
therefore of the essence of these contracts. Similarly, time was also of the
essence in relation to the shares under the February 2005 Agreement, which
were purchased about two weeks _after_ the listing date. Lee paid for these
shares on 14 and 21 February 2005 respectively. Again, these shares should
have been transferred to Lee immediately or soon thereafter upon payment being
received, and certainly not some seven to eight weeks later on 13 April 2005,
which was a date chosen by the defendant himself at his own whim and fancy.

28 In this case, it was not _expressly_ stipulated in the contracts that time
was to be of essence. However, it is established law that time may _impliedly_
be of the essence of the contract where the circumstances of the case or the
subject matter of the contract indicate that the time for completion is of the
essence: _British and Commonwealth Holdings plc v Quadrex Holdings Inc_ [1989]
1 QB 842. In my view, it was clear from the surrounding circumstances of the
transactions and the very nature of the transactions themselves that time was
to be of essence in these contracts.

29 My finding that time was of the essence meant that the implied term that
the Pre-Listing Shares were to be delivered by the listing date was a
condition, and not a warranty or an intermediate term. Similarly, time was
also of the essence in relation to the delivery or transfer of the 400,000
shares purchased under the February 2005 Agreement and paid for in February
2005. The defendant had breached this condition by transferring all the shares
to Lee’s share account only on 13 April 2005. As such, the plaintiffs were
entitled to terminate the contract and claim damages for the breach. When the
defendant effected the transfer of the shares to the account of Lee on 13
April 2005, Lee (acting for himself and on behalf of the other plaintiffs)
chose not to accept the very late performance of the contract or the very late
delivery of the shares. This was obvious from the fact that he refused to deal
with the shares and demanded an explanation from the defendant (NE p 74). Lee
also told the defendant that the plaintiffs would hold him responsible for the
non and/or late delivery (Lee’s affidavit dated 22 June 2007 at [12]). In my
view, the plaintiffs had lawfully terminated the contract and they were
entitled therefore to claim for the damages they had suffered.

**_Measure of Damages_**

30 We then come to the issue of the measure of damages that the plaintiffs
were entitled to. The plaintiffs claimed for loss of profits and the return of
the purchase price. I only allowed the plaintiffs’ claim for the return of the
purchase price.

31 A claim for loss of profit in this case is essentially a claim for
expectation loss – the plaintiffs are to be placed, in so far as money can do
it, in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed.
As the price when the shares were first listed was about RM 1.40 per share,
the plaintiffs claimed a loss of profit of RM 0.40 per share for the Pre-
Listing Shares. For the shares purchased under the February 2005 Agreement,
the plaintiffs claimed a loss of RM 0.08 per share as the market price at the
time of purchase was RM 1.08 per share.

32 To make out a claim for damages for expectation loss, it is trite that the
claimant has to prove with a reasonable degree of certainty the value of his
expectations. If the claimant is unable to discharge this burden of proof, he
will have to rely on the reliance measure of damages (typically known as
damages for wasted expenditure) or on the restitutionary measure of damages.
The restitutionary measure seeks to restore to the claimant of the breach any
benefit he had conferred on the perpetrator of the breach.

33 Applying the above principles, I found that the plaintiffs were not
entitled to succeed in their claim for loss of profits as they had not
discharged their burden of proving, with reasonably certainty, the value of
their expectation loss. The plaintiffs’ claim for a loss of profit of RM 0.40
per share was necessarily based on the assumption that _all_ the plaintiffs
without exception (including PCMW and See Chak Wah) would immediately sell
their shares on the first day of listing, and that they would have been able
to sell all the 1,750,000 pre-listing shares at the price they wanted _ie_ RM
1.40 per share. The evidence did not go so far as to support such an
assumption being made. Firstly, it was not clear that all the eight plaintiffs
would have wanted to sell their shares at the same time. It will be recalled
that a large majority of the plaintiffs purchased the shares directly from the
defendant under different contracts and they paid the defendant directly via
their own cheques. The various plaintiffs apparently had their own brokers to
deal with their shares (NE p 28 line 15). Further, different plaintiffs might
have different appetites for risk and might hold their shares for varying
periods of time before selling them, in which case the loss of profits would
differ for each plaintiff. The starting share price on the first day of
listing was RM 1.40 and later rose to RM 1.48. But by the afternoon, it fell
to about RM 1.30 (NE p 33). After that, it steadily and rapidly declined and
by mid-February 2005, the share price was around RM 1.08. In April 2005, the
share price further dropped to about RM 0.90. Thus, even within the course of
a day or just a few weeks, the share price had fluctuated greatly. An investor
with a greater appetite for risk might have held on longer to the shares
(perhaps harbouring hopes that there might be a rebound in the share price
before selling), in which case awarding him a profit of RM 0.40 per share
would be overcompensating him. Secondly, even if there was evidence to suggest
that all eight plaintiffs would unanimously agree to sell all their shares at
the same time, there was no certainty that they would have been able to
dispose of all their shares immediately when the market opened, _ie_ at RM
1.40 per share, considering that there would also be many others who might be
queuing and rushing to sell on the first day of listing. Thus, it was not
realistic to infer that all the Pre-Listing Shares purchased by all the
plaintiffs would have been successfully sold in the MESDAQ at RM 1.40 per
share. It was also not unreasonable to infer that at least some of the
plaintiffs might have wanted to hold their shares for a longer period to see
if the share price would increase any further, in which case the extent of
their profits (or even losses) would be unclear. Similarly, considering that
the share price was volatile and the price was following a downward trend in
February 2005, it was unclear whether Lee would have managed to sell all the
400,000 shares purchased under the February 2005 Agreement at RM 1.08 per
share even if the defendant had promptly transferred the shares to Lee’s share
trading account on the following day after the cheques for payment had been
cleared.

34 In summary, as the plaintiffs could not prove their expectation loss with a
reasonable degree of certainty, I was disinclined to allow this head of claim.
To do so would result either in under-compensation or overcompensation for
some or all of the plaintiffs.

35 I was therefore of the view that damages should be assessed on the
restitutionary measure of damages, _ie,_ based on the purchase price the
plaintiffs paid for the shares.

36 In my order, I held that the defendant was to pay the plaintiff a total
amount of RM 1,520,000. This sum was derived as follows:

|  **_Buyer/Plaintiff_** |  **_Date Purchased_** |  **_Shares Purchased_** |  **_Purchase Price Paid RM_**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 |  Lee Seng Cheong |  Aug 2004 |  30,000 |  30,000  
|  |  Aug 2004 |  40,000 |  40,000  
|  |  Aug 2004 |  220,000 |  220,000  
|  |  Jan 2005 |  300,000 |  360,000 (RM1.20 per share)  
|  |  Feb 2005 |  300,000 |  300,000  
|  |  Feb 2005 |  100,000 |  100,000  
|  _(bought from See Chak Wah)_ |  Aug 2004 |  50,000 |  50,000  
2 |  Cheong Yin Yuen |  Aug 2004 |  20,000 |  20,000  
|  |  Aug 2004 |  60,000 |  60,000  
3 |  Tan Kian Heng |  Aug 2004 |  50,000 |  50,000  
4 |  Ramasamy Somasundaram |  Aug 2004 |  50,000 |  50,000  
5 |  Loo Yuh Huey |  Aug 2004 |  50,000 |  50,000  
|  |  Jan 2005 |  50,000 |  60,000 (RM 1.20 per share)  
6 |  Lee Sea Kian |  Aug 2004 |  100,000 |  100,000  
7 |  Chia Wang Nor |  Aug 2004 |  20,000 |  20,000  
8 |  Sim Eng Chee |  Aug 2004 |  10,000 |  10,000  
|  |  |  **Total No of  
Shares: 1,450,000** |  **Grand Total:  
RM** **1,520,000**  
  
Even though See Chak Wah was not a plaintiff in this action, I awarded RM
50,000 as being due to Lee because Lee paid See Chak Wah in full for his
shares and had effectively bought over the latter’s shares (see [16] _supra_)
and stepped into the shoes of See Chak Wah for the purpose of claiming a
refund of the purchase price from the defendant. I excluded the amount paid by
PCMW (RM 300,000). This follows from my earlier holding that the defendant had
already reimbursed PCMW in full and there was no genuine loan agreement as
alleged by the defendant. I did not order the defendant to refund the purchase
price in Singapore dollars (as per P2) for the plaintiffs who paid for the
share purchases in Singapore dollars. These were Malaysian shares traded in
MESDAQ in RM. In all the written contracts, the purchase price was stated in
RM and not Singapore dollars. Any refund of the purchase price should in my
view be in the same currency in which the purchase price was originally quoted
in the contracts and in which the payment was to be made. A person who did not
have the currency in which the purchase price was quoted would have to pay the
equivalent amount of the purchase price in the currency available to him, to
be converted to the currency stipulated for the purchase price for the purpose
of payment. In this case, it was RM. Accordingly, I ordered the refund of the
purchase price for the shares to be in RM. Any gains or losses in converting
the RM back to Singapore dollars or for that matter, to any other currency, is
a matter for the plaintiffs since they had agreed to purchase Malaysian shares
priced in RM.

37 I also ordered the plaintiffs to transfer 2,050,000 shares back to the
defendant. Of these 2,050,000 shares, 1,450,000 shares belonged to the
plaintiffs (including the 50,000 shares that Lee purchased from See Chak Wah)
and the remaining shares belonged to the other parties (including PCMW’s
300,000 shares). During cross-examination, it was also revealed that the
plaintiffs had received some dividends on the shares and that there was also a
one-for-one bonus issue (NE p 79). I therefore ordered that all dividends
received and any stock splits should be accounted for and repaid or
transferred back to the defendant respectively.

38 I also dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim. The defendant had failed to
prove to my satisfaction that Lee had requested the defendant to purchase
400,000 shares on Lee’s behalf between 7 November 2005 to 8 December 2005 for
a total consideration of RM 104,409.63 (approximately RM 0.26 per share). Lee
appeared to be unaware of these transactions and I was inclined to believe
him. The document adduced by the defendant in support (exhibit SBS-5 of
defendant’s affidavit dated 19 July 2007) apparently showed that part of the
shares were paid for by a transfer of cash from a different person, _viz_ one
“Lim Eng Chong”. Lee’s account might have been used for unauthorised
transactions or trading by the defendant. I noted the defendant’s evidence (NE
p 113 to 115) that he had been putting extra shares in the share account of
Lee, which he said were to be held in trust for him, because as a director the
defendant could not trade without having to make an announcement. The
defendant said that it would be easier if he asked someone else, for instance
Lee, to hold the shares in trust for him and if that person sold the shares on
his behalf then the defendant need not make any announcement. I was inclined
to believe Lee that he did not hold any shares in trust for the defendant. I
did not think that Lee knew anything about the extra shares transferred to his
trading account until he saw the contract note from Avenue (AB32) informing
him that he had bought 2,050,000 shares on 8 April 2005 at a price of RM 0.90
on the basis of a “Direct Business Trade Retail”. It would appear that the
defendant had no qualms using Lee’s trading account for his own purposes and
to house his shares for trading to avoid having to make announcements. I did
not accept the defendant’s evidence that Lee had requested the defendant to
purchase 400,000 shares for him between 7 November 2005 and 8 December 2005.
For these reasons, I dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim for RM 104,409.63.

39 In accordance with the view I had taken of the alleged loan agreement, the
defendant’s counterclaim for the repayment of the loan and interest was also
disallowed.
