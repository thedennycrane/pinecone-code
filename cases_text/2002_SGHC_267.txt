**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

**_

Introduction

_**1\. The Plaintiff Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd (‘Swiss
Singapore’) applied for a mandatory injunction to compel the Defendant
Navalmar U.K. Ltd (‘Navalmar’) whether by itself or its agents in Singapore
SSC Shipping Agencies Pte Ltd (‘SSC Shipping’) to issue eight bills of lading,
the drafts of which were attached to Schedule 1 of the application, in
exchange for nine existing bills of lading issued by SSC Shipping for and on
behalf of the Master of the vessel MV Zurbaran (‘the Vessel’). The primary
difference was that the words ‘Freight To Collect’ were marked on the existing
bills whereas the new bills were to have the words ‘Freight Prepaid’. There
were also other differences which I shall elaborate on later. After hearing
arguments, I granted the mandatory injunction, although not exactly on the
terms sought by Swiss Singapore. Navalmar has appealed to the Court of Appeal
against my decision.

**_Background_**

2\. Swiss Singapore claims that by a contract dated 9 May 2002, it had
purchased a cargo of 10,000 metric tonne of Indonesian Merbau Timber from UD
Menara Mas of Indonesia (‘UDMM’) for a total value of US$1.35 million. On or
about 13 August 2002, UDMM entered into a fixture note with Navalmar for the
hire of the Vessel to carry the cargo from Sorong, Indonesia to Chennai,
India. Swiss Singapore is not a party to the fixture note but the material
terms thereof state:

> ‘100% freight to be remitted by telegraphic transfer by Swiss Singapore
> Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd, Singapore for and behalf of Charterer into
> Owner’s nominated bank account within 3 banking days of completion of
> loading and signing/releasing freight

> ….
>
> Owners to appoint a Singapore agent free of charge to Swiss Singapore
> Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd to issue a second set freight prepaid BSL
> against an LOI as per Owner’s format which to be signed by their authorised
> signatory.’

3\. 1,252 pieces of the cargo was loaded at Sorong between 3 September 2002
and 4 October 2002 and the nine bills of lading with the words ‘Freight To
Collect’ were issued by SSC Shipping for and on behalf of the Master of the
Vessel.

4\. On 16 October 2002, Mary Vijay of Swiss Singapore sent an e-mail to
Captain Priya of Navalmar stating:

> ‘WE ARE ARRANGING TO PAY THE FREIGHT TODAY. PLEASE ADVISE YOUR AGENTS IN
> SINGAPORE TO RELEASE SWITCH B/L TO US AGAINST FAX COPY OF TELEX REMITTANCE
> OF FREIGHT WITH A COPY TO US. ALSO PLEASE ADVISE THE POSITION OF VESSEL HER
> ETA CHENNAI ETC.’

5\. This was followed by a handwritten fax to Captain Priya stating:

> ‘ To: Capt. Priya

> Ref. our telecon today. We have still not read your confirmation on above
> message. Please advise your agents details to whom we have to get the B/L
> Switched. Due to your not receipt of your confirmation of above matter and
> not confirmation of ETA of the vessel the freight payment is delayed. Your
> urgent confirmation is awaited to pay the freight.

Thanks.

Mary.’

6\. On Friday 18 October 2002, Capt Priya sent an e-mail in response stating:

> ‘KINDLY NOTE THAT YOU HAVE STILL NOT PAID THE OCEAN FREIGHT.
>
> WE CANNOT SWITCH THE B/L (_sic)_ UNTILL WE DO _(sic)_ NOT RECEIVE THE
> FREIGHT INTO OUR ACCOUNT.
>
> VESSEL SAILED FROM BINTULU THIS MORNING AND WILL CALL TUTI
>
> FIRST TO DISCHARGE 4700 CBM LOGS AND THEN CALL AT CHENNAI.
>
> WE EXPECT VESSEL TO ARRIVE CHENNAI ON/ABOUT THE 28/29 TH OF OCTOBER AGW WP.
>
> KINDLY EXPEDITE FRT PAYMENT.’

7\. On Monday 21 October 2002, Mary Vijay sent an e-mail to Capt Priya
stating:

> ‘THANKS FOR YOUR BELOW MESSAGE. KINDLY SEND A MESSAGE CONFIRMING THAT
> SINGAPORE SHIPPING WILL BE SWITCHING THE B/L TO US AGAINST TELEX COPY
> CONFIRMING OF FREIGHT PAYMENT MADE TO YOU. WE NEED THIS _VERY URGENTLY_ AS
> WE _DO NOT WANT ANY CONFUSION OR DELAY_ IN GETTING THE B/L SWITCHED. WE WILL
> ONLY TAKE THE SWITCH B/L FROM YOUR AGENT AFTER PAYMENT OF FREIGHT. HENCE
> YOUR _CONFIRMATION TO US REQUIRED VERY URGENTLY_.’
>
> [Emphasis added.]

8\. An e-mail of the same date was sent in reply to Mary Vijay stating:

> ‘we _confirm_ that bills of lading will switched by Singapore shipping _upon
> receipt_ of frt remittance advise. kindly note that _delay is on your
> account_ due to non payment of freight, otherwise _this could have been done
> 10 days ago_.’

> [Emphasis added.]

9\. On the very same day, Swiss Singapore arranged for payment of the freight
of about US$258,000 and Mary Vijay sent an e-mail to Capt Priya to forward the
telex confirmation of payment and eight drafts of bills of lading with an
urgent request that Navalmar instruct SSC Shipping to sign and release the new
bills.

10\. Eight days later, on 29 October 2002, Swiss Singapore’s solicitors,
Haridass Ho & Partners (‘Haridass’) sent an urgent chaser by fax to Navalmar
to point out that Navalmar had confirmed in its e-mail dated 21 October 2002
that the bills of lading would be switched upon receipt of remittance for the
freight and notwithstanding such remittance, Navalmar had refused to instruct
SSC Shipping to issue the new bills. They also pointed out that without the
new bills, Swiss Singapore would not be able to negotiate the letter of credit
issued in their favour by their Indian buyers and their Indian buyers could
not arrange customs and other clearance. The penultimate paragraph of the fax
put Navalmar on notice that if it failed to instruct SSC Shipping to issue the
new bills by close of office the next day, they would proceed to the courts in
Singapore to compel Navalmar by injunction to instruct its Singapore agents
(i.e SSC Shipping) to issue the new bills.

11\. In response, English solicitors Michael Lloyd & Co (‘Michael Lloyd’),
acting for Navalmar, sent a fax reply dated 29 October 2002 asserting that
Navalmar was dismayed at the apparent indifference to an enormous demurrage
debt incurred at the load port and asking what assurance Swiss Singapore could
give concerning payment thereof. The demurrage and related costs was
US$187,930. They also sought particulars of the contract between Navalmar and
Swiss Singapore and the contract term regarding the issue of the new bills.

12\. Haridass responded in a fax dated 30 October 2002 pointing out the
material terms of the fixture note and Navalmar’s e-mail dated 21 October 2002
wherein it had confirmed that the bills of lading would be switched ‘upon
receipt of frt remittance advice’ and stressing that Swiss Singapore had paid
freight. Haridass warned that if the new bills were not issued, Swiss
Singapore would be left with no alternative but to seek the remedy stated in
their earlier fax and asked Michael Lloyd to revert by the opening of
Haridass’ office the next day.

13\. Michael Lloyd then sent a reply fax dated 30 October 2002, stating that
Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note and could not seek
reliance on it. They also said that ‘It would appear inequitable in any event
for them to take advantage of part of the document whilst ignoring other
obligations of the shipper set out in it’. Mr Lloyd also asked to speak to Mr
Haridass but no evidence was given as to whether Mr Lloyd managed to speak to
Mr Haridass and what was said in the conversation.

_**

The application for a mandatory injunction

**_

14\. On Friday 1 November 2002, Swiss Singapore commenced an action in
Singapore and filed an ex parte application for the mandatory injunction which
I have mentioned. As the application was for a mandatory injunction, I
directed its Counsel, Mr R Srivathsan, to forward a copy of the Writ of
Summons, the application and the supporting affidavit to Michael Lloyd and to
SSC Shipping with a cover fax or letter stating that the application had been
adjourned to 10.30 am of 5 November 2002 (as Monday 4 November 2002 was a
public holiday in Singapore). The Vessel was expected to reach Chennai on 5
November 2002.

_**

Arguments

**_

15\. On Tuesday 5 November 2002, Mr Joseph Tan appeared for Navalmar before
me. He sought an adjournment to the following Monday i.e 11 November 2002 to
file an affidavit in response although he had received instructions the
previous Saturday afternoon and he had spoken to London solicitors on Sunday
and Monday. He was instructed that Navalmar’s e-mail had been sent under
pressure otherwise Swiss Singapore would not pay the freight. He was also
instructed that the export of logs from Indonesia was illegal under Indonesian
law.

16\. Mr Srivathsan objected to any adjournment and took me through the e-mail
dated 18 October 2002, and the two e-mail dated 21 October 2002 which I have
cited in paras 6 to 8 above.

17\. Mr Tan did not dispute that freight had been received by Navalmar or that
the Vessel was likely to reach Chennai on 5 November 2002. He said he had
nothing to add in respect of the application for an adjournment.

18\. I then decided to grant an order in terms of the first prayer of the
application whereupon Mr Tan produced a draft affidavit of his which he said
he would affirm in the afternoon (which was subsequently extended to 12 pm of
the next day). On that basis, I allowed Mr Tan to address me on the merits of
the application. Mr Tan raised a number of arguments and I will deal only with
the more substantive ones.

19\. Mr Tan’s first argument was that Swiss Singapore was not a party to the
fixture note. The fixture note was governed by English law although it
provided for arbitration in Singapore. In so far as Swiss Singapore appeared
to rely on the English Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (‘the
Act’), which gives rights to third parties, he pointed out that Swiss
Singapore had not adduced evidence of English law, such law being a question
of fact. On the other hand, Navalmar had obtained a written opinion from an
English Counsel Mr Michael Nolan dated 4 November 2002 to the effect that the
Act did not give Swiss Singapore the right to enforce the term in the fixture
note under which Navalmar agreed to issue a second set of bills of lading
against a letter of indemnity. I would add that the letter of indemnity was
never raised as an issue previously or by Mr Tan and I need say no more on it.

20\. Secondly, the intended new bills contained different information which
Navalmar objected to. The objections were stated in a fax dated 1 November
2002 from Michael Lloyd to Haridass i.e (i) there were eight instead of nine
bills, (ii) more importantly, the new bills would acknowledge shipment of a
total of 6,301 cbm logs whereas the original bills referred to 6,171 cbm,
(iii) the new bills would be dated 29 September 2002 whereas the originals had
various dates between 3 September 2002 and 4 October 2002.

21\. Thirdly, if the contract of sale was illegal then Swiss Singapore should
not be granted equitable relief against Navalmar as Swiss Singapore had come
to court with unclean hands. Mr Tan said that the cargo could be discharged in
Chennai and kept in a godown while the issue of demurrage is sorted out.

22\. Fourthly, Mr Tan submitted that the entire transaction was suspicious. In
the past, Navalmar had dealt only with Swiss Singapore. For the present cargo,
Swiss Singapore had asked Navalmar to charter the Vessel but prior to the
conclusion of the charter, Swiss Singapore said that they would prefer it if
Navalmar dealt with UDMM for this particular transaction. Navalmar had never
dealt with UDMM before and had entered into the charterparty with UDMM solely
at Swiss Singapore’s request. Accordingly, Swiss Singapore might be liable for
demurrage as undisclosed principal.

23\. Mr Srivathsan did not dispute that Swiss Singapore was not a party to the
fixture note. Swiss Singapore was relying on the Act to give it rights against
Navalmar. He took me through section 1 of the Act. He also submitted that
Swiss Singapore would also rely on the e-mail as constituting a separate
contract as between Navalmar and Swiss Singapore and/or estoppel.

24\. As for the different information to be contained in the new bills, they
were the requirements of Swiss Singapore’s purchasers.

25\. As for illegality, he submitted that Swiss Singapore was the buyer FOB.
It was not its concern whether the seller has the requisite licence to sell or
export the cargo.

26\. As for the allegation that Swiss Singapore was the undisclosed principal,
he denied this on the basis that it had bought the cargo from UDMM.

_**

The reasons for my decision

**_

27\. Section 1 of the Act provides:

> ‘Right of third party to enforce contractual term
>
> 1.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person who is not a party to
> a contract (a "third party") may in his own right enforce a term of the
> contract if -

> > (a) the contract expressly provides that he may, or
>>

>> (b) subject to subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on
him.

> (2) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply if on a proper construction of the
> contract it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be
> enforceable by the third party.
>
> (3) The third party must be expressly identified in the contract by name, as
> a member of a class or as answering a particular description but need not be
> in existence when the contract is entered into.
>
> (4) This section does not confer a right on a third party to enforce a term
> of a contract otherwise than subject to and in accordance with any other
> relevant terms of the contract.

> (5) For the purpose of exercising his right to enforce a term of the
> contract, there shall be available to the third party any remedy that would
> have been available to him in an action for breach of contract if he had
> been a party to the contract (and the rules relating to damages,
> injunctions, specific performance and other relief shall apply accordingly).
>
> (6) ….
>
> (7) ….’

28\. Section 6 states:

> ‘6.(1) ….
>
> (2) ….
>
> (3) Section 1 confers no right on a third party to enforce -

> > (a) any term of a contract of employment against any employee,
>>

>> (b) any term of a worker’s contract against a worker (including a home
worker), or

>>

>> (c) any term of a relevant contract against an agency worker.

> (4) ….
>
> (5) Section 1 confers no rights on a third party in the case of -

> > (a) a contract for the carriage of goods by sea, or
>>

>> (b) ….

> Except that a third party may in reliance on that section avail himself of
> an exclusion or limitation of liability in such a contract.

> (6) In subsection (5) "contract for the carriage of goods by sea" means a
> contract of carriage -

> > (a) contained in or evidenced by a bill of lading, sea waybill or a
> corresponding electronic transaction, or
>>

>> (b) under or for the purposes of which there is given an undertaking which
is contained in a ship’s delivery order of a corresponding electronic
transaction.’

29\. It is true that Swiss Singapore did not tender any opinion from any
English solicitor or counsel on the Act but there was evidence from Mr Nolan
as to what section 1 and 6 states, in addition to his opinion thereon.
However, Mr Nolan’s opinion was significantly silent about the exchange of
e-mail.

30\. It seemed to me that Swiss Singapore had a strong case that Navalmar was
estopped from denying that Swiss Singapore had an enforceable right against it
under the fixture note in respect of the issuance of new bills or that there
was a separate contract between Swiss Singapore and Navalmar arising from the
exchange of the e-mail regarding the issuance of the new bills when freight
was paid by Swiss Singapore.

31\. On the latter point, Mr Tan submitted (in his request for further
arguments which I declined to accede to) that the consideration from Swiss
Singapore was done for and on behalf of UDMM and as agent for UDMM. Thus,
there was no consideration from Swiss Singapore. However, there was no
evidence that Swiss Singapore had paid the freight on behalf of UDMM or as its
agent. He also submitted that the payment of freight was past consideration
but, as Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note, it was, prima
facie, not obliged to pay the freight in the first place.

32\. As regards the second argument on the three discrepancies between the
drafts of the new bills and the originals, I was of the view that this could
be overcome by an appropriate order addressing the objections.

33\. As regards the third argument about illegality, there was no evidence
from an Indonesian lawyer about the illegality let alone Swiss Singapore’s
complicity in it. Mr Tan had relied solely on what Capt Priya had told him,
and Capt Priya had in turn relied on what Navalmar’s Indonesia agents had
said. Even then, Mr Tan could only say that the whole transaction ‘may be’
illegal. In any event, the cargo was already no longer in the territory of
Indonesia and the present dispute was not between buyer and seller. It seemed
to me that Navalmar was not at all concerned about the alleged illegality. It
had not offered to return the freight paid or to carry the cargo back to
Indonesia. On the contrary, it was quite prepared to deliver the cargo to
Swiss Singapore or its buyers if demurrage was paid. It was clear to me that
the allegation about illegality was just an excuse raised in an attempt to
deny Swiss Singapore the relief it had sought.

34\. As regards the fourth argument about Swiss Singapore being the
undisclosed principal behind the fixture note, Navalmar could still pursue
this position even if the mandatory injunction was granted.

35\. I was mindful that a court should be slow in granting a mandatory
injunction especially if it is the substantive relief sought in the action.
However, I was of the view that the justice of the case was clearly in favour
of Swiss Singapore, at least in respect of its present application.

36\. It is not in dispute that Navalmar was aware that demurrage was
outstanding when its two e-mail dated 18 and 21 October 2002 were sent. It
could have remained silent when Swiss Singapore had sought its confirmation
that the new bills would be issued upon payment of the freight or it could
have informed Swiss Singapore quite openly that the new bills would not be
issued unless both the freight and demurrage were paid. It did not elect
either of these options. Instead, it gave not one but two confirmations that
it would switch the bills when the freight was paid. The first confirmation
was implied in its e-mail dated 18 October 2002 and the second was specific in
its e-mail dated 21 October 2002\. Indeed in its second confirmation, it went
so far as to say that the delay in the switch was due to non payment of
freight and that this could have been done ‘10 days ago’.

37\. Navalmar knew that Swiss Singapore did not want any dispute about the new
bills (see again Swiss Singapore’s e-mail dated 21 October 2002 cited in para
7 above). Yet either it deliberately deceived Swiss Singapore into believing
that the bills would be switched upon payment of the freight or it resiled
from its position after receiving such payment. Even after Navalmar had
received evidence of the payment of freight, it did not promptly raise the
issue of outstanding demurrage with Swiss Singapore as a condition before
releasing the new bills for eight or more days until Haridass sent its chaser
dated 29 October 2002, as I have mentioned.

38\. It is all very well for Navalmar to take the position that the cargo can
be discharged at Chennai and kept at a godown while the issue of demurrage is
sorted out. It must be aware that this situation would give it the upper hand
with a view to causing Swiss Singapore to capitulate to its demurrage claim.
Having received about US$258,000 as freight, Navalmar has, unfortunately,
resiled on its word just to obtain payment of approximately US$188,000.

39\. In the circumstances, I had a ‘high degree of assurance’, to use the
words of Megarry J in _Shepherd Homes Ltd v Sandham_ [1971] Ch 340, that I
should grant a mandatory injunction. Accordingly, I maintained the thrust of
the injunction order I had granted but varied it to take into account the
three discrepancies raised by Navalmar.
