Introduction

1 The plaintiff seeks damages from the defendant, a futures broker, for
wrongfully closing out his open futures contracts at a loss. The defendant
says that it had the right to do so because the plaintiff failed to fulfil his
margin obligations. The plaintiff alleges that he would not have been in
breach of those margin obligations if the defendant had credited his incoming
funds to his trading account in a timely and expeditious manner. The plaintiff
therefore seeks damages from the defendant not only for the capital he lost
when the defendant closed out his positions but also for the profits he would
have made if the defendant had allowed him to keep those positions open until
he could close them out voluntarily.

2 For the reasons which follow, I find the plaintiff's claim to be wholly
unmeritorious. I have no hesitation in dismissing it in its entirety.

Facts

3 The plaintiff, Mr Joseph Tan Chin Yew, holds a finance-related degree and is
qualified as a certified financial analyst. He has 12 years of experience in
the financial services sector.[note: 1] Until 30 June 2012, he was employed by
Credit Suisse AG as Asian Chief Economist.[note: 2]

4 The defendant, Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd, is a broker which allows its
clients to trade on a wide variety of international exchanges in a wide
variety of financial products using a “fully self-directed trading model.”
Under this model, the defendant provides execution-only services to its
clients through its electronic trading platform at discounted brokerage
fees.[note: 3] The financial products which the defendant enables its clients
to trade in this way include futures contracts for commodities such as
precious metals.

The plaintiff opens a trading account

5 On 18 May 2011, the plaintiff walked into the defendant’s office in Raffles
Place to inquire about its services. One of the defendant’s sales managers, Mr
Eoh You Loong (“Loong”), attended to the plaintiff. After speaking to Loong,
the plaintiff decided to open a trading account with the defendant. Like all
other trading accounts with the defendant, the plaintiff’s was an execution-
only account.

6 As part of the defendant’s account-opening procedures, the plaintiff signed
various documents. These included a client application form (“the Application
Form”) and a trading checklist (“the Checklist”). The plaintiff also received
from Loong the defendant’s standard account-opening documentation. This
documentation included the defendant’s General Business Terms (“the GBT”).

The Application Form

7 Part 8 of the Application Form said:

**I/We declare by my/our signature(s):**

…

To understand and accept that the General Business Terms and any other
relevant terms and conditions (as amended from time to time) apply to my/our
entire trading relationship with Saxo Capital Markets.

…

**Furthermore I/we confirm:**

…

That I/we specifically acknowledge and agree that Saxo Capital Markets will
provide me/us execution only services and no financial advisory services…

8 By signing the Application Form, the plaintiff acknowledged two things.
First, he acknowledged that the terms of the GBT formed part of the contract
that governed his relationship with the defendant (“the Contract”). Second, he
acknowledged that the defendant was going to provide him execution-only
services. It is true that the plaintiff was what the defendant calls a
“Premium Account Holder”. There was also some suggestion by the plaintiff that
the defendant agreed to make arrangements for him to execute his trades by
speaking to a representative of the defendant rather than on his own through
its electronic platform. [note: 4] None of this changes the fact that his
account was an execution-only account.

The General Business Terms

9 The following terms of the GBT are of particular relevance to the
plaintiff’s claim:

(a) Cl 5.1 under the heading “Money Transfers to the Client’s Account at Saxo
Capital Markets”:

5.1.When the Client transfers money from an account in another bank, the money
is normally booked on the Client’s Account on the first Business Day after
Saxo Capital Markets has received the money…

(b) Cl 6.3 under the heading “Margins, Collateral, Payments and
Delivery”:[note: 5]

6.3Payments into the Client’s Account are deposited by Saxo Capital Markets on
the condition of Saxo Capital Markets receiving the amount in question… The
Account will only be cleared for trading when the funds are credited into the
Client’s Account. This shall apply irrespective of whether it has been
explicitly stated in receipts or other notices of or requests for payment.

(c) Cl 6.10 under the heading “Margins, Collateral, Payments and
Delivery”:[note: 6]

6.10If the Client fails to provide any margin, deposit or other sum due under
the [GBT] in respect of any transaction Saxo Capital Markets _may close any
open position without prior notice to the Client_ and apply any proceeds
thereof to payment of any amounts due to Saxo Capital Markets…

[emphasis added]

(d) Cl 7.2 and 7.3 under the heading “Margin Trades” of the GBT:[note: 7]

7.2Saxo Capital Markets’ margin requirement shall apply throughout the term of
the Margin Trade. _It is the Client’s responsibility to continuously ensure
that sufficient margin is available on the Account at any time._ The Client
further acknowledges that losses can be far greater than the amount of funds
placed in the Account for margin Trade. If practicable Saxo Capital Markets
shall notify the Client if the margin requirements are not met. _If, at any
time during the term of a Margin Trade, the margin available on the Account is
not sufficient to cover Saxo Capital Markets margin requirement, the Client is
obliged to reduce the amount of open Margin Trades or undertake such other
adequate action to immediately satisfy the margin requirements. Even if the
Client takes steps to reduce the size of open Margin Trades or undertakes any
other action to satisfy the margin requirements, Saxo Capital Markets may
close one, several or all of the Client’s Margin Trades or part of a Margin
Trade and/or liquidate or sell securities or other property at the Client’s
account at its sole discretion without assuming any responsibility towards the
Client for such action._

7.3If Saxo Capital Markets, due to insufficient margin, closes one, several or
all of the Client’s Margin Trades, _the Client shall expect, unless otherwise
agreed and confirmed by Saxo Capital Markets that all of the Client’s open
Margin Trades will be closed_.

[emphasis added]

The plaintiff implements a trading strategy

10 In or around May 2011, the plaintiff formed a view that the price of
platinum was going to rise while the price of gold was going to fall.[note: 8]
He intended to profit from this by implementing a sophisticated and aggressive
trading strategy called a “spread trade”. A spread trade involves taking a
position on the price difference (known as the “spread”) between two
commodities by simultaneously purchasing long futures contracts for the
commodity which the trader expects to go up in price (in the plaintiff’s case,
platinum) and short futures contracts for the commodity which the trader
expects to go down in price (in the plaintiff’s case, gold). A long futures
contract is a contract to _buy_ a specific amount of the commodity at a
specified price on a specified date in the future. A short futures contract is
a contract to _sell_ a specific amount of the commodity at a specified price
on a specified date in the future. When the spread between platinum and gold
had widened sufficiently in the plaintiff’s favour, his plan was to take his
profit by closing out his trading positions.

11 On 29 June 2011, the plaintiff credited SGD 200,000 to his trading account.
On the next day, 30 June 2011, he credited a further USD 95,837.30 to the
account.

12 On 30 June 2011, the plaintiff corresponded with Loong in a series of
emails about the maximum long platinum and short gold positions which he could
hold based on the funds in his account.[note: 9] I return to this email
correspondence again at [22].

13 On 18 July 2011, the plaintiff executed the spread trade described above
(at [10]). He instructed one of the defendant’s account managers, Ms Christin
Tan (“Christin”), to purchase 24 long futures for 50 troy ounces of platinum
each on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) and 12 short futures for
100 troy ounces of gold each on the Commodity Exchange (“COMEX”).

14 Both NYMEX and COMEX are futures exchanges based in the United States. Both
exchanges have electronic trading platforms which operate virtually 24 hours
per day, six days a week. Anyone who trades on these markets anywhere in the
world is therefore exposed to the risk of adverse market movements at any
time.

Trading on margin

15 The plaintiff acquired these 36 futures contracts on margin. That meant
that the capital which the plaintiff had to put up in his trading account to
buy these 36 futures contracts was a small fraction of his total exposure
under them. Trading on margin thus allowed the plaintiff to use a small amount
of capital to take a large position on the relative price movements in these
two commodities. A small increase in the spread between the price of platinum
and gold would amplify his profits. But margin-trading is a double-edged
sword: a small decrease in the spread would amplify his losses. And his losses
were not in any way limited by the capital he had staked in his account.

16 The plaintiff’s 24 platinum contracts had a margin requirement of USD 3,500
each. His total margin requirement for the platinum contracts was therefore
USD 84,000. His 12 gold contracts had a margin requirement of USD 4,500 each.
His total margin requirement for the gold contracts was therefore USD 54,000.
His total margin requirement for all 36 contracts was USD 138,000.

17 This USD 138,000 was just the plaintiff’s minimum margin requirement. So
long as his positions remained open, the plaintiff had to ensure that his
account had funds which exceeded what the defendant called the “total margin
requirement”. At any given time, the plaintiff’s margin situation was captured
in a ratio – which the plaintiff was familiar with – called the margin
utilisation ratio (“MUR”). MUR was calculated in real time by the following
formula:

Margin Utilisation Ratio = |  Total Margin Requirement  
---|---  
Net Equity for Margin  
  
  

Net Equity for Margin is calculated by taking the funds standing to his credit
in the account, adding to that all unrealised gains arising from his
positions, subtracting from that all unrealised losses arising from his
positions and finally subtracting from that certain transaction costs.

18 If the plaintiff’s positions sustained losses, his MUR would be exactly
100% when the funds standing to his credit in his account less his unrealised
losses and transaction costs equalled exactly the total margin requirement. If
his positions continued to sustain losses from that point, his Net Equity for
Margin would diminish and his MUR would exceed 100%.

19 If the plaintiff’s MUR equalled or exceeded 100%, the plaintiff would
immediately be subject to a “margin call”, _ie_ a contractual obligation
immediately to reduce his MUR either by either (a) depositing more funds into
his account or (b) closing out some of his open positions. On the face of the
Contract, the consequence of being on margin call was severe. Pursuant to Cl
7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT (see [9(d)] above) a margin call triggered the
following consequences:[note: 10]

(a) The defendant had the right unilaterally to “close one, several or all of
the [plaintiff’s] Margin Trades… at its sole discretion without assuming any
responsibility towards the [plaintiff] for such action”.

(b) If the defendant “closes one, several or all of the [plaintiff’s] Margin
Trades, the [plaintiff] shall expect… that all of the [plaintiff’s] open
Margin Trades will be closed.”

20 In reality, however, the defendant allowed each client, including the
plaintiff, a grace period to bring his MUR below 100%. This grace period was
47 hours or until his MUR reached 150%, whichever was sooner.

21 Cl 7.2 of the GBT further provided that although the defendant would, “if
practicable”, notify the plaintiff if his margin requirements were not met, it
was the plaintiff’s “responsibility to continuously ensure that sufficient
margin is available on the Account at any time.” The plaintiff understood this
well:[note: 11]

Q.… If you look at … [the] client application form, part 8. If you go to the
last bullet point just above your signature, again you acknowledge and agree
that Saxo's only providing you execution services and no financial advisory
services; correct?

A.Yes, that's correct.

Q.So you had the responsibility of making your own trading decisions?

A.Yes, correct.

Q.You had the responsibility of monitoring your own margin?

A.Yes, correct.

The plaintiff takes his positions

22 As I have mentioned above, the plaintiff executed his spread trades on 18
July 2011. The plaintiff clearly knew the risks of spread trading on margin.
Before taking his positions, the plaintiff initiated an email correspondence
(see [12] above) with Loong to find out how many platinum and gold futures he
could purchase in a 2:1 ratio based on the funds in his account.[note: 12]
Loong initially gave the plaintiff a conservative estimate, suggesting that he
could purchase 20 platinum futures and 10 gold futures (_ie_ a total of 30
futures contracts). Based on the available funds in his account, this position
could withstand an unrealised loss of about USD 119,250 before the plaintiff’s
MUR would reach 100% and trigger a margin call. Loong expressly caveated his
suggestion by saying that “the above case is just purely my view and not an
[_sic_] suggestion on what to trade”.[note: 13] The plaintiff, however, wanted
to maximise his risk to maximise his reward. He asked Loong how many contracts
he could buy “when pushed to the limit of my funds in the account.”[note: 14]
The plaintiff asked whether he could go up to a total of 42 contracts (14 gold
and 28 platinum) or 45 contracts (15 gold and 30 platinum). To this, Loong
replied as follows:[note: 15]

When seriously push [_sic_] to the limit of your funds in your account, it
should be 24 lots of platinum contracts and 12 lots of gold contracts with 45
points gap difference [USD 90,000] set aside as buffer before hitting margin
call.

23 Thus, when the plaintiff bought these 36 futures contracts, he was taking
the view that, while he waited to take his profit, his worst-case scenario was
an unrealised loss of USD 90,000. With that in mind, he bought 36 contracts to
maximise his potential gain based on the capital he had staked as margin. He
was deliberately implementing a high-risk trading strategy (spread trading) in
a high-risk manner (on margin) to maximise his rewards (by maximising his
contracts). He piled risk upon risk upon risk. That necessarily meant that he
left no margin for error if his assumed worst-case scenario turned out to be
overly-optimistic. That is precisely what happened in August 2011.

The plaintiff’s positions deteriorate on 4 Aug 2011

The lead-up to the margin calls

24 In early August 2011, the US financial markets experienced turmoil. This
led to a narrowing of the spread between platinum and gold. The plaintiff
sustained unforeseen losses on his open positions, albeit unrealised losses.
The plaintiff’s prediction had been defeated, at least at this point in time.
This led to severe upward pressure on his MUR.

25 On 4 August 2011 at around 15:16, the plaintiff called the defendant to
enquire about his MUR (“the 4 August 15:16 Conversation”). One Mr Gavin Tay
(“Gavin”) attended to the plaintiff. I set out the relevant portions of the 4
August 15:16 Conversation:[note: 16]

Plaintiff: |  I just want to check my position. Because there is quite of bit compression in term [_sic_] the biggest position I am running. I just wondering how I am on margin side and trigger margin call.   
---|---  
Gavin: |  Are [_sic_] you received any margin call right now?  
Plaintiff: |  I have not got any information…  
… |   
Gavin: |  Okok. I will check. Currently your [MUR] is only 78%.  
Plaintiff: |  78% meaning what?  
Gavin: |  You have not reached margin call. Margin call means 100% utilisation of the margin  
Plaintiff: |  Okok.  
Gavin: |  Now is 78%. For your two future contracts Nymex and Comex.  
Plaintiff: |  It is still open, the position is not closed.  
Gavin: |  Yes. Still open. But if market worsen and reached 100%, it will not be stop out immediately. There is about 47 hours… or 150% whichever comes earlier before we close out the position for you.   
Plaintiff: |  Ok, understand, so I will get a email or phone call lah. Some one call me.  
Gavin: |  Ahhh…not necessary. But pop-out will appear on your platform. Email I do not know your account manager will send to you.  
Plaintiff: |  Actually I do not have the platform you see.  
Gavin: |  Ah… I will inform Christin.  
Plaintiff: |  Ya, ask Christin to watch the position for me. If there is any pop-out let me know. I do not want to close the position.   
… |   
  
  

26 In this conversation, Gavin tells the plaintiff that notwithstanding Cl 7.2
of the GBT, the plaintiff’s positions will not be closed out automatically
when his MUR reaches 100% but that he will be allowed a grace period of 47
hours or until his MUR reaches 150%, whichever is earlier.

27 Later the same day at 17:02, the plaintiff called the defendant again. This
time he spoke to Christin (“the 4 August 17:02 Conversation”). The plaintiff
wanted to check his MUR. Christin told the plaintiff that his MUR had reached
80%. Like Gavin, she went on to inform the plaintiff of the defendant’s policy
on clients whose MUR reached 100%:[note: 17]

Christin: |  … I do not want you to get there… I mean if you do get there[,] you will get an email notification that you are on 100%. And your concern about the further loss. There is a circuit breaker goes out at 150%. Compulsory circuit breaker.   
---|---  
Plaintiff: |  The compulsory circuit breaker at 150% is it?  
Christin: |  That is right. But at 100% you are already on the call. That means you still have to [fulfil] the 47 hours. That means continuously at 100% or above 100% below 150%, you are on 47 hour clock.  
Plaintiff: |  Ok.  
Christin: |  If that happens, the 47 hours clock…  
Plaintiff: |  Ok. I got two days to put in money lah.  
Christin: |  Exactly maybe one, just one day.  
Plaintiff: |  Ok can.  
… |   
  
  

28 Once again, the defendant made crystal clear to the plaintiff the
conditions on which his positions would be closed out automatically.

The margin calls

29 The platinum and gold markets remained volatile throughout the day on 4
August 2011 (New York time). At 22:44 that day in Singapore, the plaintiff’s
MUR reached 100% for the first time. At 23:39, the defendant’s automated
system sent the plaintiff an email to inform him of a margin call. The email
contained the following warning:[note: 18]

You should either reduce your positions and/or transfer sufficient funds to
support your open positions. Funds via cheque payments will only be booked to
your trading account once the cheque has been cleared and the funds are made
available _and booked_ into your trading account.

[emphasis added]

30 Market volatility meant that the plaintiff’s MUR hovered around 100%
throughout the night of 4-5 August 2011 (Singapore time). Each time his MUR
dipped below 100% and then went back above it, he received another margin call
email. In all, he received 12 more margin call emails that night.

The plaintiff is closed out on 5 August 2011

The plaintiff’s margin position deteriorates

31 On 5 August 2011 at 08:30, Christin called the plaintiff (“the 5 August
08:30 Conversation”). She told him that his MUR had reached 102% and that he
was subject to a margin call. The defendant had no contractual obligation to
make this call, and the plaintiff knew it (see [21] above). This was a wake-up
call. The plaintiff would have done well to heed it, and to do so with
alacrity.

32 In response, the plaintiff told Christin that he was going to remit SGD
40,000 to his account that day to reduce his MUR:[note: 19]

Plaintiff: |  I’m going to move about forty thousand SGD into the account today.  
---|---  
Christin: |  Ok, alright. So you’re going to do a [telegraphic transfer] over right?  
Plaintiff: |  mmm.  
Christin: |  Ok, will do. Let me know once you get down to the bank and do this and I will just let my cash management know that this is coming in. But _otherwise you are still expose[d] to anything that goes up at 150 ok_? So, ehm, let me know, ok as soon as possible.  
Plaintiff: |  Ok.  
[emphasis added]  
  
  

33 It is clear that Christin was making three points to the plaintiff in this
phone call:

(a) that she would inform the defendant’s cash management team of the
plaintiff’s incoming funds to try to speed up the process of giving the
plaintiff the benefit of those funds;

(b) even though the plaintiff had spoken to Christin and told her to expect
his funds, the plaintiff was nevertheless subject to the defendant’s automatic
close out procedure; and

(c) although the defendant was giving him 47 hours to meet the margin call, he
was still exposed to the risk of an immediate, automatic close out if his MUR
reached 150% at any time within those 47 hours.

34 At 09:41 that day, the plaintiff called Christin to ask for the defendant’s
settlement instructions (“the 5 August 09:41 Conversation”). At 09:49,
Christin sent to the plaintiff by email the defendant’s standard settlement
instructions (“the Settlement Instructions”) which set out how clients could
fund their trading accounts through the defendant’s account at The Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation (“HSBC”).

35 At 09:54, the plaintiff forwarded the Settlement Instructions to his bank,
Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”), with instructions to transfer SGD 40,000 to
HSBC for credit of the defendant and further credit to his account. At around
11:00 – two and a half hours after Christin warned the plaintiff of the risk
of an immediate automatic close out if his MUR reached 150% – the plaintiff
visited the Battery Road branch of SCB to sign the remittance form which had
been prepared for him.[note: 20] At 11:41, the plaintiff received an email
from SCB confirming that they had carried out his remittance
instructions.[note: 21]

The defendant automatically closes out the plaintiff’s positions

36 The plaintiff’s trading positions deteriorated dramatically from 13:00
onwards. At 13:20, the defendant sent the plaintiff a margin-call email which
stated that his MUR was 126%.[note: 22] Six minutes later, at 13:26, the
plaintiff called Christin (“the 5 August 13:26 Conversation”) to inform her
that he had already effected the transfer of SGD 40,000 by a telegraphic
transfer:[note: 23]

Plaintiff: |  Christin, hi, it’s Joseph. I’ve already sent in 40 thousand.  
---|---  
Christin: |  Ok, Sin? Right?  
Plaintiff: |  Ya, SGD ya.  
Christin: |  Will do. Via [telegraphic transfer] right? This is via [telegraphic transfer].  
Plaintiff: |  Via [telegraphic transfer], correct, from my Standard Chart account. Sorry, that should help with things a little.  
Christin: |  Yeah that’s right.  
Plaintiff: |  For now.  
Christin: |  I’m just gonna call you once I sight this funds. Ok?  
Plaintiff: |  Yeah.  
Christin: |  Alright.  
  
  

37 At 13:29:27 – 1 minute 55 seconds after she ended the 5 August 13:26
Conversation – Christin emailed the defendant’s cash management team to inform
them that they should expect a remittance by telegraphic transfer of SGD
40,000 from the plaintiff through SCB and that they should inform her “when
the funds [are] sighted and booked”.[note: 24]

38 At around 15:00, Christin noticed that the plaintiff’s MUR had shot up to
138%. Concerned for the plaintiff, she called the cash management team to
check if the SGD 40,000 had arrived. They told her that the funds had not yet
come in.

39 At 15:08:52, Christin called the plaintiff (“the 5 August 15:08
Conversation”). She encouraged him to close out some of his trading positions
in order to bring down his MUR. As was the case all along, she had no
obligation to monitor the plaintiff’s margin position let alone to call him
about it (see [21] above). The 5 August 15:08 Conversation lasted a total 4
minutes 5 seconds. Two critical events occurred during this phone call. First,
at 15:11:23, the plaintiff’s MUR exceeded 150%. As a result, the defendant’s
automated system immediately closed out all his open positions. Second, 1
minute and 16 seconds later, the defendant booked the plaintiff’s SGD 40,000
to his account. Because this conversation is of critical importance, I
reproduce it in its entirety, with the time stamps:[note: 25]

Time |  Person |  Content  
---|---|---  
15:08:59 |  Christin: |  Hi Joseph, your [MUR] is at 142%, you know. You want to do something about it first because I am worried the fund wont comes in time for…  
|  Plaintiff: |  It sure comes in already because I have already placed the instructions before 2pm.  
|  Christin: |  I understand but I have just checked before I call you. That is why I am asking whether you want to reduce some first. [Your MUR] is at 140% and Euro is really taking this really badly.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Yeah. But No.  
|  Christin: |  No?  
|  Plaintiff: |  The funds are coming in.  
|  Christin: |  The thing is that I cannot guarantee. You see. If the fund is coming in, as long as it not booked. You are still subject to margin stop-out.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Yeah. But you can scale back some? Does the whole position will be closed?  
|  Christin: |  Ah, I am sorry?  
|  Plaintiff: |  Does the whole position will be closed out?  
|  Christin: |  Yes! The whole position which is why I am so worried for you, right?  
|  Plaintiff: |  I still got 142%. [The funds have already transferred].[note: 26]  
|  Christin: |  En?  
|  Plaintiff: |  Where is the 150?  
|  Christin |  150?  
|  Plaintiff: |  How tight is the spread…  
|  Christin: |  It is now 1657-1689, current price right? Gold is 1657… Platinum is 1689.  
|  Plaintiff: |  No. 1694, [P]LV1 [Note: Reference to a platinum long futures contract], right?  
|  Christin: |  Sorry? Nymex platinum, right? 1687.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Stay calm. Stay calm.  
|  Christin: |  I don’t want you to get stopped out, man. That is 142% as I am looking at this…  
|  Christin: |  Oh no, 146%. I tell you what Joseph. Either we had better clear down some first. How about one one for each side?  
15:10:57 |  Plaintiff: |  One Contract for each side?  
|  Christin: |  Yes.  
|  Plaintiff: |  En…  
15:11:08  |  Christin: |  Wait wait, 149% hurry up, hurry up! Quick, quick!  
|  Plaintiff: |  Two for platinum, one for gold.  
15:11:14 |  Christin: |  So, wait, wait, GCV1 [Note: Reference to a gold short futures contract] you are short. Buy back two.  
15:11:22 |  Plaintiff: |  Two one.  
15:11:23  |  Christin: |  Wait wait hang on. Hold hold hold. Joseph, you are totally cleared out by the system, already. You are already triggered stop out.  
|  Plaintiff: |  But the funds are in, isn’t it?  
|  Christin: |  No. It is not in yet. Which is why I called you to tell you it is not in yet. It triggers 151%. And everything is cleared out.  
|  Plaintiff: |  So the whole loss taken at hundred and…  
|  Christin: |  Yes. The whole loss has been taken already.  
|  Plaintiff: |  It is ok. Don’t worry.  
|  Christin: |  Ok. Basically, after everything factored in is 88,000 left in your account. 88,298.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Dollars?  
|  Christin: |  USD.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Ok. All right.  
|  Christin: |  I am sorry man. I really try to help. That is why I told you it might be better for you to clear some But… as we’re talking, everything went out.   
|  Plaintiff: |  Yeah yeah that is not your problem. Just stay calm.  
|  Christin: |  Ok. Do you want going to some positions or you need time to think something first  
|  Plaintiff: |  We will just hold for now. Ok? Then we will just… yeah. How the funds come in?  
|  Christin: |  Actually the 40,000 comes in and it did not help, you know.  
|  Plaintiff: |  The 40,000 should help because it not possible to trigger the 150%. Can you please recheck your system please?  
|  Christin: |  Er. Yes I just saw your trigger came in at…  
|  Plaintiff: |  It is very strange ah. If I wire this money in, it should be in by now.  
|  Christin: |  But the thing is if it don’t pop to us, we still don’t get it. And we work through HSBC, you see. So if it don’t pop to us, we don’t be able to book it.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Come on. I have already put the cash in. We do see the 140%. You got quickly thinking whether you can put positions back on again. Just talk to Pamela.  
|  Christin: |  But it is STP. You see. So everything is traded through exchange. So not likely we can put back on.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Just see what you can do, ok?  
|  Christin: |  Ok, ok. Thanks.  
|  Plaintiff: |  Thanks bye.   
  
  

40 The 5 August 15:08 Conversation must be viewed against the backdrop of the
precise sequence of events which occurred between 14:47 and 15:13 on 5 August,
none of which are disputed:

(a) At 14:47, SCB debited SGD 40,000 from the plaintiff’s account at SCB
pursuant to his instructions given earlier that day and further to the
confirmation it sent at 11:41 that morning.[note: 27]

(b) At 15:05:15, HSBC acknowledged SCB’s SWIFT message crediting the
defendant’s account with SGD 40,000.[note: 28]

(c) At 15:07, HSBC credited SGD 40,000 to the defendant’s segregated trust
account with HSBC.[note: 29]

(d) At 15:08:56, HSBC sent a SWIFT message to the defendant reporting that it
had credited SGD 40,000 to the trust account.[note: 30]

(e) At 15:09:20, the defendant’s cash management team accessed the trust
account to validate the transfer of SGD 40,000.[note: 31]

(f) At 15:11:18, the plaintiff’s MUR reached 151% and all his positions were
automatically closed out.[note: 32]

(g) At 15:12:25, after conducting its standard anti-money laundering checks,
the defendant’s cash management team directed the SGD 40,000 to the
plaintiff’s Account.[note: 33]

(h) At 15:12:34, the defendant’s system booked the SGD 40,000 into the
plaintiff’s trading account.

41 So the defendant booked the plaintiff’s SGD 40,000 to his account 3 minutes
38 seconds after the defendant received the SWIFT confirmation from HSBC, and
1 minute 16 seconds after the defendant’s system automatically closed out the
plaintiff’s positions.[note: 34] The plaintiff says, therefore, that it is the
defendant who is responsible for his loss and not himself.

Summary of the parties’ cases

The plaintiff’s case

42 In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Siraj Omar,
contends that the defendant was obliged to give the plaintiff the benefit of
the SGD 40,000 at 15:08:56[note: 35] (the point at which HSBC notified the
defendant that HSBC had received the plaintiff’s remittance of SGD 40,000),
and not at 15:12:34 (when the defendant in fact booked the SGD 40,000 into the
plaintiff’s account). Mr Omar submits further that this obligation arises from
an implied term of the Contract that the defendant would provide its services
to the plaintiff in a timely and expeditious manner; alternatively because it
owed him a duty of care in tort to the same effect. In breach of this implied
term, alternatively this duty of care, the defendant gave the plaintiff the
benefit of the SGD 40,000 only at 15:12:34. If not for this breach, Mr Omar’s
argument goes, the plaintiff’s MUR would have been well below 150% at
15:11:18, and the automatic close-out would not have been triggered at that
moment. On that basis, Mr Omar submits the defendant wrongfully closed out the
plaintiff’s trading positions at 15:11:18. Thus, says Mr Omar, the defendant
is liable to compensate the plaintiff not only for the SGD 214,000 or so which
he lost when his positions were automatically closed out but also for the
profit of SGD 322,000 or so he would have achieved on his positions when the
markets for platinum and gold eventually recovered in his favour, as they
did.[note: 36]

43 Even if all this is correct, it still leaves the fact that the plaintiff’s
MUR, although below 150% at 15:11:18, would have been above 100% at that time.
Mr Omar does not deny that the defendant had a contractual right to close out
the plaintiff’s positions immediately and without warning upon the plaintiff’s
MUR crossing 100% under Cl 6.10, 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT (see [9(c)] and [9(d)]
above). However, Mr Omar argues that the defendant is estopped from relying on
these provisions by virtue of Gavin and Christin’s assurances that his
positions would not be closed out unless his MUR remained above 100% for more
than 47 hours or his MUR reached 150%.

44 Mr Omar also does not deny that Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT (see [9(a)] and
[9(b)]) gives the defendant the contractual right to book incoming funds to
the plaintiff’s account at any time up to one business day after the defendant
receives the funds in the trust account. However, Mr Omar argues that the
defendant is estopped from relying on Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT by the
defendant’s clear and unequivocal promise to the plaintiff that he would be
entitled to the benefit of the SGD 40,000 as soon as it was credited to the
trust account.

45 The plaintiff’s case which I have outlined above was his case in closing.
This case was significantly different from the one advanced in his pleadings.
Below are examples of how his position changed over the course of the
proceedings:

(a) In his pleadings, the plaintiff alleged that by closing out his positions,
the defendant breached the express terms of the Contract to act according to
his instructions.[note: 37] The plaintiff abandoned this allegation in his
closing submissions.

(b) In his pleadings, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant negligently
handled his funds at 15:08:56 on 5 August 2011 because a fault in the
defendant’s automated system occurred at that time which required manual
intervention. The delay occasioned by that manual intervention, the plaintiff
said, is why the system failed automatically and immediately to attribute his
funds to his account before the automatic close-out. [note: 38] The plaintiff
had no basis for these assertions. Indeed the evidence at trial showed them to
be untrue: the defendant did not have an automated system as alleged; and the
automated system which it actually did have handled his remittance without
error.[note: 39] The plaintiff abandoned these allegations in his closing
submissions.

(c) Related to (b), the plaintiff pleaded that the defendant was negligent in
failing to have a straight-through processing system that would credit funds
to its clients immediately upon receipt at HSBC.[note: 40] However, the
plaintiff later conceded that it was not part of his case that the defendant
had an obligation to have such a system.[note: 41] The plaintiff abandoned
this allegation in his closing submissions.

(d) In his pleadings, the plaintiff alleged the defendant breached its duty to
exercise due care and skill in providing its services because a reasonable
holder of a capital markets licence in the defendant’s circumstances would
have suspended the automatic process for closing out the plaintiff’s positions
and would have managed them manually and/or closed them out individually
instead of all together.[note: 42] However:

(i) The plaintiff adduced no evidence whatsoever to support this
allegation;[note: 43]

(ii) The plaintiff quickly conceded in cross-examination that a financial
institution with a capital markets licence did not have an obligation to
suspend an automatic close-out;[note: 44] and

(iii) Any such a duty would be inconsistent with Cl 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT
(see [9(d)] above).

(a) The plaintiff abandoned this allegation in his closing submissions.

(e) In his pleadings, the plaintiff alleged that the assurances given by Gavin
and Christin that his positions would not be automatically closed out unless
his MUR was above 100% for more than 47 hours amounted to a representation
that he would have a grace period of two Singapore business days after his MUR
crossed 100% to bring his MUR down below 100%.[note: 45] In cross-examination,
however, he accepted that the grace period was in fact 47 consecutive hours by
the clock. He accepted also that there was no sense in talking about
“Singapore business days” because platinum and gold futures were traded on
NYMEX and COMEX virtually around the clock and around the world.[note: 46]

(f) The plaintiff’s primary position in his pleadings was that he was entitled
to the benefit of the funds at 15:05 (when HSBC received the SWIFT message
from SCB).[note: 47] In cross-examination, however, he changed his position
and alleged that the defendant ought to have given him the benefit of the
funds at 15:07 (when HSBC credited the funds to the trust account). In
support, he tried to rely on the Checklist which stated that “your trading
account will not be credited until funds are received and booked to _your
account_ ” (see [70] below). According to him, the phrase “your account” was a
reference to the defendant’s trust account with HSBC, not to a customer’s
trading account with the defendant.[note: 48] On that basis, he reasoned that
his account ought to have been credited immediately when HSBC booked the funds
to the trust account at 15:07. However, he had to admit eventually that this
interpretation was simply nonsensical. The Checklist is addressed to a client
of the defendant. “Your account” in this context is clearly a reference to a
_client’s_ trading account with the _defendant_.[note: 49] It simply cannot
refer to the _defendant’s_ account with _HSBC_. In light of this, the
plaintiff’s position shifted once more. After accepting that it made no sense
to argue that the defendant had to give him the benefit of the funds _before_
HSBC had even communicated the receipt of the funds to the defendant, he
argued instead that the defendant should have given him the benefit of the
funds as soon as the “transfer was effected”. To him, this meant the point at
which HSBC notified the defendant that HSBC had received the plaintiff’s
remittance of SGD 40,000 _ie_ 15:08:36.

46 None of these changes of position inspires me with any confidence about the
plaintiff’s conviction in his own case as it was finally formulated or with
his credibility as a witness.

The defendant’s case

47 Counsel for the defendant, Mr Harish Kumar, argues that Cl 5.1, 6.3, 6.10,
7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT provide a complete defence to the plaintiff’s claims
because Mr Omar’s implied term and duty of care in tort are not sustainable in
the face of these express provisions of the Contract.

48 Mr Kumar further contends that, in any event, the defendant acted in a
timely and expeditious manner by booking the funds into the plaintiff’s
account within 3 minutes 38 seconds of being notified of their receipt.

49 Finally, Mr Kumar denies that the defendant is estopped from relying on Cl
5.1, 6.3, 6.10, 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT.

No scope for implied term

50 I start with Mr Omar’s submission that there was an implied term in the
Contract that the defendant had to provide its services to the plaintiff in a
“timely and expeditious manner”. In _Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte
Ltd and another and another appeal_ [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“ _Sembcorp_ ”), the
Court of Appeal at [101] set out a three-step process to ascertain whether a
particular term could be implied into a contract:

(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises.
Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose
because the parties did not contemplate the gap.

(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the
business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract
efficacy.

(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be
one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would
have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time
of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then,
the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.

51 The first step requires the court to ascertain, as a preliminary point,
whether there is indeed a gap in the parties’ contract for an implied term to
fill. After all, it is only to fill a gap in the contract and thereby to give
effect to the parties’ presumed intentions (_Sembcorp_ at [29]) that the
court, in certain situations, will hold a term to be implied.

52 The first hurdle which the plaintiff has to surmount is Cl 4.10 of the GBT,
which states:

_In general, Saxo Capital Markets shall act according to instructions as soon
as practically possible_ and shall, as far as practically possible and shall,
as far as trading instructions are concerned, act consistent with the bank’s
Best Execution Policy. However if, after instructions are received, Saxo
Capital Markets believes that it is not reasonably practicable to act upon
such instructions within a reasonable time, Saxo Capital Markets may defer
acting upon those instructions until it is, in Saxo Capital Markets’
reasonable opinion, practicable to do so or notify the Client that Saxo
Capital Markets is refusing to act upon such instructions.

[emphasis added]

53 Mr Omar submits that there is a gap in the Contract because the phrases
“[in] general” and “shall act according to instructions _as soon as
practically possible_ ” are vague. The former fails to identify the specific
situations in which this obligation arises and the latter fails to identify
what is the standard expected of the defendant. Implying a term that the
defendant will provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and
expeditious manner, Mr Omar argues, would fill this gap.[note: 50]

54 The first argument is a non-starter. Cl 4.10 deals with situations where a
client of the defendant gives instructions to the defendant – such as trading
instructions – which the defendant is in a position to carry out without
further intervention from the client. This clause is not apt to cover a
situation where a client of the defendant tells the defendant to expect
incoming funds after he initiates a funds transfer involving a number of
intermediate steps. In any event, the phrase “in general” when read in context
clearly means that Cl 4.10 applies unless there is some other more specific or
more apt provision in the Contract. As for the second argument, the phrase “as
soon as practically possible” has to be read together with Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of
the GBT which contemplate that it will normally take up to one business day
for the defendant to give its clients the benefit of any funds received in its
trust account. The Contract, and in particular Cl 5.1 and 6.3, therefore
provide specifically for the situation at hand: when a client can expect the
defendant to give him the benefit of an inward remittance of funds, even if
the client has told the defendant to expect those funds.

55 Mr Omar also submits that the term that the plaintiff seeks to imply does
not contradict the express terms of the Contract because nothing in the GBT
says that the defendant does not owe a duty to its client to provide its
services in a timely and expeditious manner. I do not agree. To the extent
that the formula “timely and expeditious” is used to argue that the defendant
is under a contractual obligation to book funds into a client’s trading
account in less than one business day, that is, in substance, _directly
contradicted_ by Cl 5.1 of the GBT. The effect of Cl 5.1 is that it _cannot_
be a breach of the Contract for the defendant to book funds into a client’s
account at any time up to one business day after receipt. It may even be
possible to argue that Cl 5.1 allows the defendant in certain cases to take
_more_ than one business day to book funds to a client’s account. But the
defendant did not push its argument on Cl 5.1 that far and did not need to do
so.

56 For the same reasons, the plaintiff fails to surmount the second step of
the three-stage process set out in _Sembcorp_. Cl 5.1 of the GBT gives the
Contract clear business efficacy without any need to imply an overarching term
that the defendant will provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and
expeditious manner.

57 This is sufficient to dispose of the plaintiff’s case based on an implied
term. However, for the sake of argument, even if I accept that there is an
implied term that the defendant will provide its services to the plaintiff in
a timely and expeditious manner, I am satisfied that the defendant did not
breach any such term. Mr Omar submits that the defendant breached the term
because the plaintiff did not get the benefit of the funds at 15:08:56 but
only at 15:12:34, 3 minutes 38 seconds later. However, the plaintiff himself
accepted that the defendant did not have – and had no obligation to have – an
automated processing system which would book the funds into his Account
_immediately_ upon receipt of the funds into the trust account. That
concession means that, if any such implied term existed, the defendant came
under an obligation to comply with it only at 15:08:56. This in substance
boils down to an allegation that the 3 minutes 38 seconds which the defendant
took between 15:08:56 and 15:12:34 was neither timely nor expeditious.

58 Mr Omar submits that every second was crucial to a customer subject to a
margin call and it was therefore necessary for the defendant to give the
plaintiff the benefit of incoming funds as soon as possible. He submits
further that, because the plaintiff was subject to a margin call, the
defendant’s cash management team should have immediately credited the
plaintiff’s incoming funds to his account and postponed its anti-money
laundering checks. It was those checks which were being completed when the
defendant automatically closed out the plaintiff’s positions. In support of
this submission, Mr Omar relies on the concession by Mr Eugene Low, a senior
officer in the defendant’s cash management team, that the defendant had the
ability to postpone its anti-money laundering checks in a margin call
situation so that funds could be made available more quickly to a client who
was subject to a margin call. This submission, in my opinion, conflates the
defendant’s _ability_ to postpone anti-money laundering checks in a margin
call situation with its _obligation_ to do so. The defendant had no obligation
to postpone the anti-money laundering checks.

59 In truth, taking the implied term argument to its logical conclusion
exposes the weakness of the plaintiff’s case. The defendant automatically
closed out the defendant’s positions at 15:11:18. Even if the defendant had
credited the funds to the plaintiff’s account at 15:11:19, his positions would
still have been automatically closed out. So the logical conclusion of the
plaintiff’s argument is that even if the defendant had taken just 2 minutes
and 23 seconds to book the funds into his account (at 15:11:19 instead of
15:12:34), the defendant would still be in breach of this implied obligation.
Thus, the implied term contended for by the plaintiff amounts to an argument
that the defendant is in breach of its duty to act in a timely and expeditious
manner so long as a client fails to receive the benefit of funds before his
positions are closed out. The plaintiff’s argument effectively subjects the
defendant to a deadline for booking the funds into a client’s account which
varies from day to day with the particular circumstances of each client.
Implying such a term gives the Contract commercial absurdity rather than
commercial efficacy. I would expect the plaintiff, with his background in the
financial services sector, to understand that. The defendant included Cl 5.1
in the GBT precisely to avoid such an imprecise and ever-shifting obligation.
In rejecting this implied term and its logical conclusion, I also bear in mind
that:

(a) The defendant was not in control of when the plaintiff’s MUR would reach
150% since this depended purely on market forces;

(b) The defendant was not in control of the time that HSBC would receive the
funds from SCB (the plaintiff in fact accepted in cross examination that he
had to take the risk of HSBC failing to receive the funds from SCB in
time);[note: 51]

(c) The defendant was not in control of the moment HSBC chose to book these
funds into the trust account; and

(d) The defendant did not have – and the plaintiff accepted that it had no
obligation to have[note: 52] – an automated system that automatically and
immediately attributed sums credited to the trust account to the trading
account of a particular client of the defendant.

60 Even if I were to assume that such a term could be implied into the
Contract, the plaintiff produced no evidence to show that the booking of funds
to a client’s trading account within 3 minutes and 38 seconds of receiving
notification of receipt in its trust account was in breach of any industry
norm. On the contrary, on the evidence before me, HSBC also took around the
same time to book the SGD 40,000 into the trust account and inform the
defendant of this by SWIFT after it received the funds from SCB (see [40]
above).

61 Therefore, even if there was an implied term that obliged the defendant to
book incoming funds to the plaintiff’s account in a timely and expeditious
manner, I found that the time of 3 minutes 38 seconds taken to do so did not
amount to a breach of that implied term.

The defendant was not negligent

62 The content of any duty of care in tort which required the defendant to
provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and expeditious manner is
shaped by the contractual framework governing the parties’ relationship,
including Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT: _Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria
Creditanstalt AG_ [2011] 4 SLR 559 at [46(c)]. In fact, Mr Omar clarified that
the duty of care which the plaintiff sought to impose on the defendant was on
the same terms and scope as the implied contractual term.[note: 53] The
plaintiff’s alternative claim in tort therefore did not add anything to his
claim in contract. Nevertheless, I assume in the plaintiff’s favour that such
a duty of care exists. Even on that assumption, I find that the defendant did
not breach any such duty of care. I bear in mind that:

(a) The defendant would not be in breach of the Contract if it booked the
funds within one business day by virtue of Cl 5.1 of the GBT;

(b) I cannot imply a term into the Contract that the defendant is obliged to
provide its services to the plaintiff in a timely and expeditious manner, if
that is a contractual duty more onerous than the Contract already provides
for; and

(c) Even assuming there were such an implied term, the defendant did not
breach it when it took 3 minutes 38 seconds to book the funds into the
plaintiff’s account.

63 There is therefore no room left to find any breach of any duty of care by
the defendant.

The defendant is not estopped

64 This left the plaintiff’s case resting entirely on the doctrine of
promissory estoppel and the doctrine of estoppel by convention. The doctrine
of promissory estoppel is often described as a “shield” because it allows a
promisee to prevent a promisor from insisting on enforcing his strict legal
rights. A promisee cannot use promissory estoppel as a “sword” to found a
free-standing cause of action, at least on the orthodox view: _Oriental
Investments (SH) Pte Ltd v Catalla Investments Pte Ltd_ [2013] 1 SLR 1182 (“
_Catalla_ ”) at [82]. The same can be said of the doctrine of estoppel by
convention: _OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon_ [2012] 2 SLR
311 at [90]. The plaintiff lacks a sustainable cause of action arising from an
implied term in contract or a duty of care in tort for the reasons I have
given above. That is fatal to the plaintiff’s case in estoppel. If the
plaintiff has no sword in contract or tort, it is abundantly clear that he is
attempting to use estoppel impermissibly as a sword.

65 However, even if the plaintiff is permitted to raise the estoppel arguments
as a sword, his claim still fails for the reasons below.

Promissory estoppel: the law in general

66 A promisee who relies on the doctrine of promissory estoppel must establish
three elements: first, that the promisor made a clear and unequivocal promise,
whether by words or conduct; second, that the promisee relied on the promise;
and third, that the promisee suffered detriment as a result of the reliance:
_Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd_ [2013] 4 SLR 409 at
[37]. It is also said that a promisor is estopped by promissory estoppel only
if it is “inequitable” for him to resile from his promise: _Catalla_ at [38];
_Centre for Creative Leadership (CCL) Pte Ltd v Byrne Roger Peter and others_
[2013] 2 SLR 193 at [134(c)]; _Lam Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank AG_ [2010] 2
SLR 896) at [57].

67 The question of whether a promise is sufficiently clear and unequivocal is
a factual inquiry that must take into account the exact contractual provision
which is sought to be enforced and the exact promise made in relation to that
provision: _Chuan Hong Petrol Station Pte Ltd v Shell Singapore (Pte) Ltd_
[1992] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [60].

Defendant made no unequivocal promise to the plaintiff

68 Mr Omar’s case is that the defendant was estopped from relying on Cl 5.1
and 6.3 of the GBT. I reproduce those clauses again:

5.1.When the Client transfers money from an account in another bank, the money
is normally booked on the Client’s Account on the first Business Day after
Saxo Capital Markets has received the money…

…

6.3Payments into the Client’s Account are deposited by Saxo Capital Markets on
the condition of Saxo Capital Markets receiving the amount in question… The
Account will only be cleared for trading when the funds are credited into the
Client’s Account.…

69 Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT make two things clear. First, the defendant
estimated that it would normally take one business day for funds to be booked
into a client’s trading account _after_ the defendant had received the funds.
It was therefore implicit that it _cannot be a breach_ of the Contract if
funds are booked to an account _within_ one business day of receipt. Second,
the plaintiff would not have the benefit of inward remittances of funds until
those funds were received by the defendant _and booked_ to his account.

70 The second point was repeatedly brought to the plaintiff’s attention. For
example, the Checklist contained the following statement:

Account Trading Conditions[note: 54]

…

Funding Methods – your trading account will not be credited until funds are
received _and booked_ to your account. Saxo Capital Markets does not accept
3rd party funding.

[emphasis added]

71 On 29 June 2011, when the plaintiff funded his account for the first time,
the defendant sent him an email confirming receipt. This email contained the
following words of caution:[note: 55]

Dear Joseph Tan Chin Yew,

We are pleased to advise you that your funds have arrived and you can now
proceed with the activation of your live Saxo account.

…

Before you commencing trading with us, it is of utmost importance that you
review the information below carefully.

…

**Please note:**

Funds will need to be cleared first before they are available and Margin stop-
outs cannot be postponed based on any incoming funds until they are cleared
_and booked_ into your account.

[emphasis added]

72 Mr Omar relies on several facts to support his submission that the
defendant made a clear and unequivocal promise to the plaintiff that he would
be entitled to the benefit of the SGD 40,000 as soon as the defendant received
notice from HSBC at 15:08:56 that the funds had been received in its trust
account. I deal with each of them in turn.

73 First, Mr Omar refers to the 4 August 17:02 Conversation (see [27] above).
He submits that in this phone call:

(a) Christin informed the plaintiff that his positions would not be closed out
if he transferred sufficient funds into his account within one day of a margin
call; and

(b) Christin did not, at any time during this conversation, inform the
plaintiff that there would be a time lag between the time the defendant
received the funds and the time he would be given credit for the funds, let
alone that the time lag could take up to one business day.

74 I fail to see how these two facts support Mr Omar’s conclusion that
Christin thereby promised the plaintiff, unequivocally or otherwise, that the
defendant would give him the benefit of the SGD 40,000 as soon as HSBC
informed the defendant that it had credited the funds to the trust account.
When the plaintiff suggested to Christin that what she had told him meant that
he had “two days to put in money” to beat the 47-hour deadline, he was clearly
thinking in terms of the total time he had available in which to satisfy the
margin call. Seen in this context, it was clear to me that when Christin
responded “[e]xactly maybe one, just one day”, she was giving the plaintiff an
estimate of the time which he had to _initiate_ a telegraphic transfer of
funds in order for plaintiff to give him the benefit of the funds before the
47-hour deadline elapsed. And all of this was subject to her express
qualification that there was still a compulsory close-out when his MUR reached
150%. This was a point for, not against, the defendant: it supported the
defendant’s position that the plaintiff knew that he had to allow up to one
day (or to be precise, 23 hours out of the 47-hour grace period) after
initiating a transfer for all intermediate steps to be completed, subject
always to an automatic close-out at 150% MUR even before the 47 hours expired.

75 I was also satisfied that no promise, let alone an unequivocal promise,
could be inferred from Christin’s failure to advise the plaintiff about the
time lag. To my mind, the defendant had no positive duty to provide the
plaintiff with advice of this nature because the potential time lag was
already made clear in Cl 5.1 of the GBT.

76 Second, Mr Omar points out that the defendant did not mention any time lag
in:

(a) any of the margin call notification emails received by the plaintiff
overnight from 4 August 2011 to 5 August 2011 (see [29] above);

(b) the 5 August 08:30 Conversation (see [31] above),

(c) the 5 August 09:41 Conversation (see [34] above)

(d) the 5 August 13:26 Conversation (see [36] above); and

(e) the 5 August 15:08 Conversation (see [39] above).

77 In none of these communications did the defendant make any promise, let
alone an unqualified promise, that the defendant would give the plaintiff the
benefit of incoming funds as soon as HSBC informed the defendant that it had
credited those funds to the trust account. Furthermore, for the same reasons
as those given in [75], there can be no promise arising from the defendant’s
silence on the issue when the GBT provides expressly for a time lag.

78 Third, Mr Omar refers to the 5 August 08:30 Conversation and the following
words said by Christin:

… Let me know once you get down to the bank and do this and I will just let my
cash management know that this is coming in. But otherwise you are still
expose[d] to anything that goes up at 150 ok? So, ehm, let me know, ok as soon
as possible.

79 Mr Omar submits that Christin gave the plaintiff “the clear message… that
he would still be at risk of being closed out as long as… [the defendant] had
not received the funds.”[note: 56] The basis for this submission is that
“[g]iven that Christin wanted to ensure that the plaintiff would be
transferring via Telegraph Transfer as the quickest way to obtain the benefit
of the funds, she must know that [the plaintiff] would certainly have wanted
to know of any such time lag.”[note: 57] To my mind, this argument is
misconceived. Christin certainly did tell the plaintiff clearly that he
continued to be at risk until the funds came in. But that is not the same
thing as promising him unequivocally that he would _cease_ to be at risk _as
soon as_ the funds came in. Christin’s point in this conversation was not
whether there would or would not be a time lag. All she was doing was pointing
out to the plaintiff the three points I have already referred to in [33] above
in order to urge him to act quickly. I would have expected the plaintiff to
have grasped these points for himself and not to need any such urging.

80 I also gave little weight to this submission as it appears to be an after-
thought. At no time after his positions were closed out on 5 August 2011 and
before he filed his Reply (Amendment No 2)[note: 58] in the current
proceedings on 10 June 2013 did the plaintiff allege that he had relied on
this promise by Christin. It was also telling that this allegation did not
appear anywhere in the plaintiff’s description of the 5 August 08:30
Conversation in his affidavit of evidence in chief.

81 Fourth, Mr Omar relies on the Settlement Instructions. They say this about
payment by telegraphic transfer and internet banking:[note: 59]

**Telegraphic Transfer and Inter-Bank Internet Banking Transfer**

…

_No Postponement of Margin Stop-Outs_

**Margin stop-outs cannot be postponed** based on funds that have been debited
from your account with your bank. Payments into your account are deposited
only on the condition that such funds have been cleared and received by Saxo
Capital Markets.

82 The Settlement Instructions also say this about payment by cheque:[note:
60]

**SGD and USD Local Clearing Cheques**

…

**7\. Margin stop-outs cannot be postponed** based on funds that have been
debited from your account with your bank, as the cheque needs to be cleared
and funds made available and booked into your trading account.

[emphasis in bold and bold underline in original]

83 Mr Omar contends that the Settlement Instructions provide that the
defendant’s customer meets a margin call if funds transferred by telegraphic
transfer are “cleared and received” by the defendant. He points out that there
is no express requirement that the funds need to be “booked into” a trading
account before a client receives the benefit of such funds. He contrasts this
with the instructions concerning payments by cheque which make express mention
of booking as a separate step. Mr Omar also points to the fact that the
Settlement Instructions do not say that there will be a time lag between the
defendant’s receipt of funds and its booking of funds.

84 This argument is flawed. The advisory in relation to telegraphic transfers
clearly says: “Payments into _your account_ are deposited only on the
condition that such funds have been _cleared and received_ by Saxo Capital
Markets.” [emphasis added]. The reference to “Payment into your account” is
clearly a reference to the funds being booked into a client’s account. The
purpose of this provision is clearly to protect the defendant against payments
into the trust account which HSBC later reverses, whether because the payment
was mistaken or otherwise, but which the defendant has already credited to a
trading account. In relation to the lack of any warning about the time lag, it
was clearly not the purpose of the advisory on the Settlement Instructions to
warn clients about this. The reasons set out at [75] apply with equal force.

85 Fifth, Mr Omar relies on the 5 August 13:26 Conversation (see [36] above).
He submits that Christin had this conversation with the plaintiff to ensure
that he had transferred the SGD 40,000 _via_ telegraphic transfer and assured
him that it would “help with things”. He submits, further, that it could “help
with things” only if the defendant gave the plaintiff the benefit of it on the
same day, 5 August 2011. But, he points out, Christin did not tell the
plaintiff that there would be a time lag between when the defendant received
the funds and when the plaintiff would get the benefit of those funds. Again,
I cannot divine from this conversation any unequivocal promise to the
plaintiff that the defendant would give the plaintiff the benefit of the funds
as soon as HSBC informed the defendant that it had credited the funds to the
trust account. Quite the contrary, insofar as Christin assured the plaintiff
that he would get the benefit of the funds on the same day, that is precisely
what happened. Insofar as Mr Omar relies on Christin’s failure to tell the
plaintiff that there would be a time lag, I repeat the point set out at [75]
above.

86 Sixth, Mr Omar relies on the 5 August 15:08 Conversation (see [39] above),
and in particular, this part of the conversation:

Plaintiff: |  The funds are coming in.  
---|---  
Christin: |  The thing is that I cannot guarantee. You see. If the fund is coming in, as long as it not _booked_. You are still subject to margin stop-out.  
[emphasis added]  
  
  

87 Mr Omar argues that in this context, Christin’s use of the word “booked”
can only mean booked into the trust account and not booked into the
plaintiff’s account.

88 Contrary to his submissions, however, it is clear that Christin used the
word “booked” in the manner that this word was used in the Checklist (see [70]
above) and the email confirming receipt of the initial funds (see [71] above).
In both these documents, the reference to “booked” is a reference to an act by
the defendant (not by HSBC) of crediting funds into a client’s trading account
(not the defendant’s trust account with HSBC). The portion of the conversation
after the plaintiff’s positions had been automatically closed out makes this
clear:

Plaintiff: |  It is very strange ah. If I wire this money in, it should be in by now.  
---|---  
Christin: |  But the thing is if it don’t pop to us, we still don’t get it. And we work through HSBC, you see. So if it don’t pop to us, _we don’t be able to book it._  
[emphasis added]  
  
  

89 Christin was clearly drawing a distinction between the defendant booking
funds to a particular client’s trading account and HSBC informing the
defendant that funds had been received in the trust account. She was also
pointing out to the plaintiff that the former cannot happen until the latter.
This argument was therefore without any merit.

90 Finally, Mr Omar pointed out that the plaintiff did not read the GBT (or
any other provision of the GBT). This was grasping at straws. The fact that
the plaintiff did not read the GBT did not make the contractual term any less
binding him – the plaintiff accepted this in cross-examination.[note: 61] By
signing the Application Form, he accepted that the GBT applied to his trading
relationship with the defendant (see [6] above). In fact, his own pleaded case
stated that the GBT formed part of the Contract. He even relied on certain
provisions of the GBT in support of his claim.[note: 62]

91 For these reasons, and subject to [64] above, I reject the plaintiff’s
contention that the defendant is estopped under the doctrine of promissory
estoppel from relying on Cl 5.1 and 6.3 to argue that it was entitled it to
take up to one business day to book the plaintiff’s SGD 40,000 into his
account.

Estoppel by convention

92 In the alternative, Mr Omar seeks to argue that the defendant is prevented
from relying on Cl 5.1 by way of an estoppel by convention. However, the
plaintiff did not refer to estoppel by convention in his pleadings. It was
another afterthought. Assuming it is open to the plaintiff to rely on estoppel
by convention, I find that there is no such estoppel.

93 An estoppel by convention operates if the following requirements are met:

(a) The parties act in their course of dealing on an assumed and incorrect
state of fact or law.

(b) The assumption is either shared by both parties pursuant to an agreement
or something akin to an agreement, or is assumed by one party and acquiesced
to by the other.

(c) It is unjust or unconscionable to allow the parties (or one of them) to go
back on that assumption.

94 Mr Omar relies on the same facts at [73] to [90] above to establish the
estoppel by convention. I reject the submission. I assume in the plaintiff’s
favour that those facts led him to act on an assumed and incorrect
understanding of the defendant’s obligations under the Contract. Even so, the
plaintiff was the only party who was labouring under any incorrect assumption.
The evidence at trial showed that his assumption was neither shared by the
defendant nor acquiesced in by the defendant. Christin proceeded throughout
the course of her dealings with the plaintiff on the basis that while the
defendant would try to give him the benefit of any remitted funds as soon as
possible, the funds would not be booked to his account instantaneously. And as
far as the third requirement is concerned, it took some audacity for the
plaintiff to allege that it was unconscionable for the defendant to falsify on
his purported assumption. The only reason he arrived at this assumed (and
incorrect) understanding of the defendant’s obligation under the Contract in
the first place was because he had, in his complacency, failed to the read the
GBT.

Closing out the plaintiff’s positions once his MUR crossed 100%

95 In light of my findings at [68] – [94] above, it is unnecessary for me to
consider whether the defendant is estopped from relying on Cl 6.10, 7.2 and
7.3 of the GBT to close out the plaintiff’s open positions immediately and
without warning upon the plaintiff’s MUR crossing 100%. The plaintiff’s case
based on estoppel requires the defendant to be estopped _both_ from relying on
(i) Cl 6.10, 7.2 and 7.3 of the GBT _and_ on (ii) Cl 5.1 and 6.3 of the GBT.

96 For what it is worth, however, it does appear to me that the defendant is
estopped from relying on these clauses. The defendant did promise clearly to
the plaintiff through several conversations that his positions would not be
closed out automatically once his MUR reached 100% but that he would have a
grace period of 47 hours or until his MUR reached 150% in which to meet a
margin call. It is also clear that the plaintiff relied on these promises, at
least immediately after the 4 August 15:16 Conversation, to let his MUR rise
above 78% and approach 100%. But none of this assists the plaintiff because
the defendant fulfilled this promise: it closed the plaintiff’s positions out
_only_ when his MUR crossed 150%. It did not rely on Cl 6.10 to close out his
positions as soon as his MUR crossed 100% overnight from 4 August 2011 to 5
August 2011. The position would be different, of course, if the defendant had
been in breach of an express or implied term of the Contract or in breach of
its duty of care by booking the funds to the plaintiff’s account at 15:12:34
and had to rely on Cl 6.10 to justify its close-out.

Costs

97 The plaintiff, having succeeded in this action, is entitled to an order for
its costs of and incidental to the action. Mr Kumar argues that this is an
appropriate case for me to award the defendant costs on the indemnity basis.
He does not assert a contractual entitlement to indemnity costs. Instead, he
invites me to exercise my discretion to award the defendant indemnity costs
under O 59 r 27 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed). This
discretion though unfettered must be exercised judicially. An order for
indemnity costs is appropriate only in exceptional circumstances: _CCM
Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd_ [2009] 2 SLR(R) 20 at [32]. The
burden on a party who seeks an order for indemnity costs as a matter of
discretion is therefore a high one.

98 Order 59 r 5 sets out several factors which a court should take into
account in considering whether it is “appropriate” to make an exceptional
award of indemnity costs. These factors include the conduct of the paying
party before and during the proceedings. However, the list in Order 59 r 5 is
not exhaustive. In _Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc_ (10
December 1993, unreported), Millett J held:

The power to order taxation on an indemnity basis is not confined to cases
which have been brought with an ulterior motive or for an improper purpose.
Litigants who conduct their cases in bad faith, or as a personal vendetta, or
in an improper or oppressive manner, or who cause costs to be incurred
irrationally or out of all proportion as to what is at stake, may also expect
to be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis if they lose, and have part
of their costs disallowed if they win. Nor are these necessarily the only
situations where the jurisdiction may be exercised; the discretion is not to
be fettered or circumscribed beyond the requirement that taxation on an
indemnity basis must be 'appropriate'.

The English Court of Appeal approved these _dicta_ in _Munkenbeck & Marshall
(a firm) v McAlpine_ (1995) 44 Con LR 30 at 33. The recent Singapore High
Court decision of _Wong Meng Cheong and another v Ling Ai Wah and another_
[2012] 1 SLR 549 at [199] (“ _Wong Meng Cheong_ ”) has also adopted these
dicta.

99 In _Three Rivers District Council v The Governor and Co of the Bank of
England (No 6)_ [2006] EWHC 816 (Comm), Tomlinson J (as he then was) gave some
useful practical guidance on how the discretion to award indemnity costs ought
to be exercised (at [25]):

(1) The court should have regard to all the circumstances of the case and the
discretion to award indemnity costs is extremely wide.

(2) The critical requirement before an indemnity order can be made in the
successful defendant's favour is that there must be some conduct or some
circumstance which takes the case out of the norm.

(3) Insofar as the conduct of the unsuccessful claimant is relied on as a
ground for ordering indemnity costs, the test is not conduct attracting moral
condemnation, which is an a fortiori ground, but rather unreasonableness.

(4) The court can and should have regard to the conduct of an unsuccessful
claimant during the proceedings, both before and during the trial, as well as
whether it was reasonable for the claimant to raise and pursue particular
allegations and the manner in which the claimant pursued its case and its
allegations.

(5) Where a claim is speculative, weak, opportunistic or thin, a claimant who
chooses to pursue it is taking a high risk and can expect to pay indemnity
costs if it fails.

(6) A fortiori, where the claim includes allegation of dishonesty, let alone
allegations of conduct meriting an award to the claimant of exemplary damages,
and those allegations are pursued aggressively inter alia by hostile cross-
examination.

(7) Where the unsuccessful allegations are the subject of extensive publicity,
especially where it has been courted by the unsuccessful claimant, that is a
further ground.

(8) The following circumstances take a case out of the norm and justify an
order for indemnity costs, particularly when taken in combination with the
fact that a defendant has discontinued only at a very late stage in
proceedings:

(a) Where the claimant advances and aggressively pursues serious and wide
ranging allegations of dishonesty or impropriety over an extended period of
time;

(b) Where the claimant advances and aggressively pursues such allegations,
despite the lack of any foundation in the documentary evidence for those
allegations, and maintains the allegations, without apology, to the bitter
end;

(c) Where the claimant actively seeks to court publicity for its serious
allegations both before and during the trial in the international, and
national and local media;

(d) Where the claimant, by its conduct, turns a case into an unprecedented
factual enquiry by the pursuit of an unjustified case;

(e) Where the claimant pursues a claim which is, to put it most charitably,
thin and, in some respects, far-fetched;

(f) Where the claimant pursues a claim which is irreconcilable with the
contemporaneous documents;

(g) Where a claimant commences and pursues large-scale and expensive
litigation in circumstances calculated to exert commercial pressure on a
defendant, and during the course of the trial of the action, the claimant
resorts to advancing a constantly changing case in order to justify the
allegations which it has made, only then to suffer a resounding defeat.

100 I agree with Mr Kumar that the plaintiff’s case was thin and ultimately
irreconcilable with the contemporaneous documents and indeed with the law. In
fact, much of the plaintiff’s case was merely an afterthought which was
dispatched quickly during cross-examination. A plaintiff in that position, as
Tomlinson J said, is taking a high risk and can ordinarily expect to pay
indemnity costs when his claim fails. However, on balance, I conclude in the
circumstances of this case that the plaintiff’s conduct as a whole does not
rise to the level necessary to make it appropriate to award indemnity costs
against him. I say this for two reasons:

(a) First, I accept that the plaintiff had no ulterior motive in bringing
these proceedings. He brought the action, misguided though it was, in a good
faith attempt to secure compensation for his trading losses to which he
genuinely, though perhaps optimistically, thought he was entitled.

(b) Second, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff conducted his case in an
oppressive or unreasonable manner or caused costs to be incurred irrationally
or disproportionately. Mr Omar on the plaintiff’s behalf conducted the
plaintiff’s case with economy (as of course did Mr Kumar for his client). Mr
Omar did not protract the cross-examination of the defendant’s witnesses by
pursuing hopeless aspects of his client’s case or side issues of marginal
relevance. As a result, Mr Omar was able to finish his cross-examination of
the four defence witnesses very efficiently in a little over a day.

101 For the reasons above, I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant the
costs of this action assessed on the standard basis, such costs to be taxed if
they cannot be agreed.

Conclusion

102 The plaintiff was clearly the author of his own misfortune. He did not
foresee the exceptionally volatile market conditions from 4 August 2011 to 5
August 2011 which led to his positions deteriorating so badly and so quickly
that his MUR almost doubled from 78% to 150% in less than 24 hours. So he took
his own time – almost two and a half hours ­– to initiate the transfer of SGD
40,000 to his account despite Christin’s call at 08:30 that morning.

103 The defendant for its part made the SGD 40,000 available to the plaintiff
to reduce his MUR in a timely and expeditious manner: 3 minutes and 38 seconds
after being notified of receipt at HSBC. The mere fact that the plaintiff’s
MUR went above 150% within those 3 minutes and 38 seconds cannot, in itself,
mean that the defendant breached its obligations in contract or breached any
obligation it might have had in tort.
