Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Trafficking in controlled
drugs.  
  

1 The accused Dhanabalan s/o A Gopalkrishnan aged 33 pleaded guilty to two
charges of trafficking in a controlled drug. The first charge related to the
trafficking of 499.99g of cannabis, and the second in respect of 749.99g of
cannabis mixture. He was arrested on 24 February 2003 at 8.35pm in a flat at
Blk 52 Teban Gardens after cutting and packing cannabis from a bigger block of
the substance.

2 He was retrenched from his job as an operations executive at Natsteel some
time in July 2002. He tried a new job selling food at a coffeeshop but found
it hard to make ends meet. He told his friend Raman Selvam about his
impecuniousity. Raman then offered to pay him $100 for each block of cannabis
that he helps Raman cut and pack. The prosecution accepts that the accused was
not the main trafficker. There were also other mitigating factors in relation
to his role. He had refused to transport the packed cannabis and saw his role
simply as an assistant, packing the cannabis for his friend to traffic. He had
no known previous record for any drug offence. And, finally, the co-operation
that he had rendered the Central Narcotics Bureau and the prosecutor in the
investigation of his case as well as Raman’s.

3 The minimum sentence for the offences which he had pleaded guilty to was 20
years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. In view of the circumstances
and facts of his case I sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment for each of the
two charges as well as 15 strokes of the cane for each charge. I ordered the
terms of imprisonment to be served concurrently. The maximum number of
strokes, however, is restricted to 24 by virtue of s 230 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, Ch 68.
