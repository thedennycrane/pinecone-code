: **_The march of events_**  
  
The plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore. Their business, as the
name suggests, is venture capital investment.  
  
They brought this action against four defendants. The first defendants, Tong
Garden Holdings Pte Ltd (`the company defendants` or `the first defendants`)
are a company incorporated in Singapore. They are a holding company of several
subsidiaries engaged in the business of nut processing and packaging.  
  
The second, third and fourth defendants were at all material times directors
of the first defendants. By name they are Ong Leong Chuan, Ong Teck Chuan and
Ong Heng Chuan. The second defendant ceased to be a director in November 1999.
The second, third and fourth defendants were also at all material times
shareholders of Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd (`TGFP`), a shareholder of the
company defendants. The expression `director defendants` in this judgment
shall refer to these three individual defendants.  
  
By an investment agreement dated 12 December 1995 (`the Investment Agreement`)
entered into between the plaintiffs, the four defendants and TGFP, the
plaintiffs agreed to invest a sum of $3,500,000 in the company defendants by
subscribing for redeemable convertible preference shares (`the preference
shares`) in the capital of the company defendants. That amount was comprised
of 1,000,000 redeemable convertible preference shares of the par value of
$0.01 each (yielding $10,000) and a premium of $3,490,000.  
  
Clause 6 of the investment agreement provided that the preference shares shall
be redeemed at the investors` absolute discretion upon certain contingencies.
One of them was the company defendants` non-listing on the Stock Exchange of
Singapore Limited (`the SES`) by 31 December 1998. This dateline could be
extended, inter alia, to 30 June 1999 provided that the investors were
satisfied with certain circumstances.  
  
It was also provided in the investment agreement that on the happening of an
event of default the investors (ie the plaintiffs) had the absolute discretion
by written notice to the company defendants and/or TGFP to require the company
defendants to redeem the preference shares held by the investors. The event of
default was the non-listing of the company defendants.  
  
The completion of the redemption was to take place within six months from the
date of the written notice issued by the investors to the company defendants
or TGFP.  
  
The price of the redemption of the preference shares arising from the event of
default was the sum of $3,500,000 plus interest calculated with effect from 5
December 1995, or such other date as the parties may agree up to the date of
redemption at the rate of 10% per annum on a yearly rests basis and compounded
annually less any dividends paid to the investors. If the company defendants
failed to redeem the preference shares on or before the stipulated completion
date the investors were entitled, inter alia, to demand the payment of the
redemption price payable from the director defendants. The director defendants
jointly and severally covenanted in the investment agreement to pay the
redemption price to the plaintiffs in exchange for the preference share
certificates.  
  
The company defendants were not listed as stipulated. In the result the
plaintiffs issued a written notice dated 26 August 1999 to the company
defendants for the redemption of the preference shares. They paid $1,000,0000
in November 1999 and $260,000 in March 2000. The company defendants failed to
pay the balance of the redemption price and the interest on it within six
months of the plaintiffs` notice, that is by 25 February 2000.  
  
On 3 March 2000 the plaintiffs demanded payment of the redemption price due to
them inclusive of the 10% per annum contractual interest rate. The defendants
failed to comply with the demand.  
  
**_The action_**

****

In the result the plaintiffs issued the writ in this action. They claimed
against the company defendants a declaration that the first defendants were in
breach of their contractual obligation to redeem the preference shares under
the investment agreement dated 12 December 1995. They further sought an order
that the first defendants take the necessary steps to complete the redemption
of the preference shares plus interest.  
  
As against the director defendants the plaintiffs sought judgment for the
balance redemption price, that is $2,240,000. They further sought interest at
10% per annum of a yearly rests basis compounded annually from 5 December 1995
up to the date of full payment of the redemption sum.  
  
The plaintiffs then filed applications for summary judgment against all
defendants. The second defendant had his own legal representation. The first,
third and fourth defendants were jointly represented by another legal firm.  
  
**_Summary judgment applications and appeals_**

****

The senior assistant registrar gave the company defendants unconditional leave
to defend. The plaintiffs appealed against this decision by way of RA 27/2000.
He gave the second, third and fourth defendants conditional leave to defend.
The third and fourth defendants (`the appellant defendants`) appealed against
the decision by RA 26/2000. They wanted unconditional leave to defend. The
second defendant has not appealed. In the meantime, however, judgments have
been entered against all three director defendants.  
  
**_The law_**

****

The appeals concern an ingenious point of law raised by the appellant
defendants. They based it on s 70(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50). They cited
in support a decision of the Australian Federal Court: **Federal Commissioner
of Taxation v Coppleson** [1981] 6 ACLR 428. The facts of this case in brief
were these: Warrawanda Ltd was incorporated on 17 June 1976. Within a week of
incorporation the company issued 39,990 $1 redeemable preference shares to
Copston Securities Pty Ltd. On the same day, that is 23 June 1976, Dr
Coppleson purchased those shares from Copston Securities. Two days later, Dr
Coppleson donated the shares to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. One of the
articles of association of Warrawanda Ltd provided that `Redeemable Shares may
be redeemed at the option of the holder thereof within six months of the date
of allotment of the Redeemable Shares to be redeemed, by such holder giving
the Company not less than thirty days notice requiring redemption`. This was a
strange provision. But there it was. It was there for a special purpose. The
article further stated that `Subject to the provisions of the Companies
Ordinance the Company shall be bound to redeem Redeemable Shares in respect of
which notice as aforesaid has been given in accordance with such notice`.
(There was another provision in the articles giving the company the option to
redeem the shares after the six months; it did not concern the court.)  
  
Section 61(3) of the Companies Ordinance, the equivalent of s 70(3) of our
Companies Act, prohibited redemption of redeemable preference shares except
out of profits which would otherwise be available for dividend or out of
proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purposes of the redemption.
The question for determination by the court was whether the holder of the
redeemable preference shares would be in a position to compel a liquidation of
the company on the ground that it would be just and equitable to do so if it
failed to redeem the shares.  
  
The court`s answer was `No`. The court reasoned as follows at pp 433-434:

> _Winding up on the just and equitable ground is an example of the court
> subjecting the exercise of legal rights to equitable considerations. There
> must be special circumstances to justify this intervention. In the case
> before us there are no such special circumstances. The company, in failing
> to redeem, would not be misusing its legal rights but merely acting, as it
> is obliged to do, in accordance with the law. The parties must be presumed
> to be aware of the statutory limitations. The transaction was a purely
> commercial arrangement, and there is no evidence of any understanding
> between the parties. Nor was there any evidence that the directors had acted
> unfairly or improperly or in breach of any duty. Indeed, no relevant change
> had taken place in the position of the company after the original allotment
> of the redeemable preference shares._

> _We are unable to discern any basis to support a petition for winding up
> upon the `just and equitable` ground. Some arguments could be put to the
> contrary. Winding up and transfer of assets to the hospital would destroy
> the purpose which the taxpayer (Dr Coppleson) had of maintaining some
> control over the form of the investment. In addition, the taxpayer (Dr
> Coppleson) would not have had the same chance of endeavouring to ensure that
> income was used for research in the way he envisaged when making the gift._

> _The argument on valuation was based on the price a willing but not anxious
> purchaser would pay for the shares, one of the matters for consideration
> being the ability of that purchaser to compel winding up. The right of a
> holder of redeemable preference shares to require redemption within six
> months after those shares were allotted, that is, virtually as soon as the
> company is formed in a case such as the present, may be illusory. The
> possibility of there existing either of the funds referred to in s 61(3) is
> remote indeed. It was common ground both before the trial judge and before
> us that a hypothetical purchaser would not envisage the existence of such
> funds at the relevant time. Nevertheless, this is the basis on which they
> accepted the shares and they are bound by it. They cannot show any injustice
> or inequity which might enable them to invoke the jurisdiction of the court
> to obtain early access to their capital._

> _Considering all the circumstances, we conclude that the holders of the
> redeemable preference shares would not be able to compel the company to be
> wound up on the ground that such a course would be just and equitable._

  
  
I must at once add that in the **_Coppleson_** case the shareholder did not
ask the Company to redeem the share within the six-month period as provided in
the article. Consequently there was no petition to wind-up the company. Indeed
it was not a fray between the shareholder and the company. The issue of
winding-up came up hypothetically in connection with the correct value of the
shares on 25 June 1976 for the purpose of taxation. That was two days after
the acquisition of the shares and eight days after the incorporation of the
company. It was accepted that the possibility of funds being available for
redemption so soon after the incorporation was remote. The company was
incorporated and the redeemable preference shares were issued and then
purchased and donated by Dr Coppleson pursuant to a tax avoidance scheme. The
court held that valuation on liquidation was not the correct basis. Having
regard to s 61(3) of the Companies Ordinance it could not have been the
intention that the investor would take up the preference shares, call on the
company to redeem them two days later and apply to wind-up the company. In
those unordinary assumed circumstances no court would order a winding-up on
the ground that it would be just and equitable to do so. The decision was
eminently correct. The circumstances and the true issue in the present case
are hugely different. Later I shall now demonstrate how .  
  
**Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Co Ltd v Mosgiel Ltd** [1994] 1 NZLR 146,
a decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, is relevant to the issue. In it
Richardson J delivering the joint judgment of the court made these salutary
statements at p 152 :

> _In contracting with the shareholder in terms of the resolutions the company
> has undertaken that it will ensure that by having available profits or
> making a fresh issue of shares it will honour that obligation._

> _It is arguable that it is for the company to organise its affairs so as to
> ensure that it will have appropriate profits out of which to meet its
> obligations to redeem and if it seems apparent that it will not be able to
> meet its contractual commitments on redemption then the company faces the
> prospect of being wound up before the redemption date under the `just and
> equitable` rule at the suit of disgruntled shareholders._

  
  
Finally, **_Australian Corporation Law: Principles and Practice_** Vol 1, para
2.6.0205 points out that :

> _To the extent that a redeemable preference shareholder may have a remedy
> for damages, or for interest, in connection with a failure by a company to
> honour the terms of issue of the shares, the shareholder`s claim would rank
> after the claims of creditors in a winding up._

  
  
**_The plaintiffs` appeal_ **

****

First, I shall state the company defendants line of defence against the
plaintiffs. Their basic position was that the plaintiffs had no **_claim_**
against them and they had **_no remedy_** against them. Their reason for these
assertions is s 70(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50). This provides like the
statute in the **_Coppleson_** case, that redeemable preference shares shall
not be redeemed except out of profits which would otherwise be available for
dividend or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the
purpose of the redemption. They relied on the **_Coppleson_** case. The
company defendants next said that they had not made any profits since
incorporation and they had not issued any shares for the purposes of redeeming
the shares. If they are right it means that s 70(3) of the Companies Act gave
them an immunity if they could ensure that they did not make any profits. Not
making profits, and for that matter making losses is a simple exercise.
Losses, sometimes, can be achieved by creative accounting. Making profits
entails much labour. The company, by clever diversion of capital and resources
to alien entities, can ensure that no profits or very little profits are made
in perpetuity. By such article the company can keep the holders of the
preference shares at bay indefinitely. Temporary membership of preference
shareholders thus may be transformed into a permanent loss making investment.  
  
**_The decision_**

****

In my judgment, there is a fundamental flaw in the company defendants`
argument. The plaintiffs` claim is in contract. The contract provides that if
the company defendants fail to secure a listing within the stipulated time,
the plaintiffs may call for a redemption. Under the contract the obligation to
redeem on notice is absolute. When the first defendants contracted for that
obligation they were fully aware of s 70(3) of the Companies Act. They must
therefore be presumed to have contracted on the basis of s 70(3) of the
Companies Act. In the context of s 70(3) of the Companies Act, the company
defendants` contractual obligation to redeem implies that they must bustle
about to bring in the funds. They must expend all their energy in their veins
to find the funds in the manner permitted by s 70(3) of the Companies Act. The
defendants are not allowed to call in aid their own indolence and inaction.
Nor can they seek shelter under s 70(3) of the Companies Act. Their
contractual obligation implies that they will see to it that their subsidiary
and related entities and persons will put them in sufficient profits or take
up new shares to produce sufficient funds. Finding the funds by those two
options, I repeat, is an absolute obligation. If they fail there are three
remedies to the preference shareholder: equity can compel them to do so by an
order for specific performance; common law can award damages; and company law
can order them to be wound up. If damages are awarded they must come from
profits or fresh share issue. In the event of liquidation the shareholders`
claim would rank after the claims of creditors.  
  
The **_Coppleson_** case is clearly distinguishable. There the question was
whether the company in a hypothetical situation was in default soon after the
issue of the shares. In the present case the contract was made on 12 December
1995. The event of default occurred on 31 December 1998, that is three years
later. The notice requiring redemption was given on 26 August 1999. The action
was commenced on 29 March 2000. It was almost five years since the date of
contract. The defendants here had adequate time to realize the funds. By
failing to find the funds they breached the contract.  
  
Accordingly I declare that the first defendants are in breach of their
obligation to redeem the redeemable convertible preference shares under the
investment agreement dated 12 December 1995. There will be a further order
that they will take the necessary steps to fulfil their obligations within
four weeks. The contractual obligation of the company defendant has now been
converted into the command of the court, with its attendant consequences. I
defer the plaintiffs` claim for damages in lieu of specific performance and
give liberty for both sides to apply. They also have the option to petition to
wind-up the company defendants. The petition may be grounded on insolvency or
just and equitable provisions. This means that the plaintiffs` appeal
succeeds.  
  
**_The appeal against the plaintiffs_**

****

Now I turn to the third and fourth defendants. They say that they must be
asked to redeem the entire lot. Since the plaintiffs cannot do that they are
not liable at all. I hold that the liability of the company defendants is
separate from that of the director defendants. The liability of the latter is
joint and several and their liability is surety liability. The defendants`
liabilities are several but at the same time the individual defendants`
liabilities are joint. If they wanted all the shares they had the option to
pay for all and receive all the shares. They did not do so. The plaintiffs for
their part cannot refuse part performance by one or more defendants. That is
the nature of the joint and several obligation and surety liability. The
individual defendants` argument, therefore, is untenable. Accordingly there
should have been judgment against them. However, they were given conditional
leave to defend. They failed to fulfil the condition and judgments have been
entered against them. The second defendant did not appeal. In the
circumstances the appeal of the third and fourth defendants fails.  
  
There will be costs to the plaintiffs on both appeals.  
  
**Outcome:**

Plaintiffs` appeal allowed; third and fourth defendants` appeal dismissed.
