Choo Han Teck J:

1 This was a case stated pursuant to s 40 of the Stamp Duties Act (Cap 312,
2006 Rev Ed) (“The Act”) to determine, on appeal, the correctness of the
respondent’s decision concerning an appeal to it by the purchasers in a
rescinded contract of sale of a property known as 96 Sophia Road. The property
consisted of a number of flats, but the contract was not an _en bloc_ sale
contract. The purchasers were the appellant and her husband Aw Cheok Huat. The
purchasers paid a sum of $60,000 as option fee for the contract. The option
was granted on 26 May 2004 and served on the vendor on 27 May 2004 after
execution by the purchasers. The purchase price was $6,000,000. Disputes arose
between the vendor and purchasers and on 27 August 2004 the parties settled by
rescinding the contract and refunding the $60,000 option fee to the
purchasers. However, the respondent assessed the contract of sale to be
chargeable with a sum of $174,600 being the ad valorem stamp duty. The
purchasers objected and argued that the respondent was obliged to refund the
duty paid (the sum of $174,600 had been paid pending the outcome of the appeal
to this court) by virtue of s 22(6)(a) of the Act. The respondent took the
view that the duty was not waived. Section 22(6)(a) provides as follows:

Subject to subsection (7), the ad valorem duty paid under this section upon
any contract or agreement for the sale of property shall, on application, be
refunded by the Commissioner where the contract or agreement is later
rescinded or annulled on the ground that (a) the vendor is unable to prove his
title to the property

2 Mr Gan, counsel for the appellant submitted a technical argument as to why
the vendor was unable to prove a good title in this case. The argument was
advanced on the claim that the parts of the flats, namely, the designated
family areas had far higher ceilings than the rest of the flats. However, the
vendor had calculated the space where the floors were omitted to make way for
those high ceilings and counted it as part of the total strata area. The
purchase price thus included “empty space”. Counsel submitted that the vendor
was unable to prove title in the void space. Indeed, that was the allegation
against the vendor – that he had breached his obligation to deliver a good
title. This might have been a fascinating issue had the dispute between the
vendor and purchasers come to trial. The matter was settled without a
determination of the issue in dispute.

3 Mr Gan cited passages from the Parliamentary Debates on the amendment of the
Act and submitted that the amendment to s 22 was to curb speculation and was
not intended to change the position that a vendor must convey a good title.
Counsel submitted that “good title” meant “marketable title”. He submitted
that the vendor here wanted to convey 1,045 sq m (of each flat) but 22% of
that stipulated area was not physical floor area but space.

4 I agree with Miss Foo, for the respondent, that the burden of proof lay with
the appellant and she had not discharged the burden. Whether the contract in
this case was enforceable by either party (vendor and purchaser), and whether
the vendor was able to transfer good title, were questions of fact that cannot
and had not been answered on a case stated. The vendor was not a party before
this court. If that question was not answered, then the respondent was
entitled to rely on the agreement for sale and assess the ad valorem duty on
the basis of the land area stipulated in it.

5 The appeal is therefore dismissed. I will hear parties on the question of
costs at a later date.
