** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1 This is an appeal by the Defendants against the decision of District Judge
Tan Peck Cheng of 5 November 2001 upholding the order of the Deputy Registrar
giving interlocutory judgment against the Defendants with costs. I upheld the
decision of the District Judge on 4 April 2002. The Defendants have, with
leave, appealed to the Court of Appeal on 13 September 2002 and I now give the
grounds for my decision.

2 The brief facts of the matter are as follows. The Defendants, a law firm,
had acted for the Third Party, Mohamed Arif ("Arif"), who is the Plaintiff’s
husband, in Suit No. 321 of 1989 and Suit No. 758 of 1991. Arif did not pay
their professional fees in full and the Defendants took up D.C. Suit No. 489
of 1994 to recover the balance. Arif did not defend the action and default
judgment was entered. When Arif did not satisfy the judgment sum of $33,922.80
the Defendants took out a Writ of Seizure and Sale on 11 April 1994.

3 Execution of the writ was levied on certain property at Bhadhar Point, a
kiosk at the Toa Payoh Bus Interchange selling a variety of goods such as
newspapers, periodicals, soft drinks, sweets and tit-bits, cigarettes and
other minor items. The Plaintiff, who claimed the goods seized belonged to
her, through her solicitors gave notice to the Defendants to release those
goods. The Defendants refused and the Plaintiff took out interpleader
proceedings, at the end of which the Defendants were ordered to release the
goods to the Plaintiff. The Defendants’ appeal against that order was heard by
District Judge Khoo Oon Soo who dismissed it with costs on 22 August 1994.

4 The Plaintiff then filed the present action to claim for damages in respect
of, _inter alia_ , losses she had incurred as a result of the seizure of the
goods. On the Plaintiff’s application, the Deputy Registrar entered
interlocutory judgment against the Defendants in respect of the claim for
damages. District Judge Tan Peck Cheng dismissed the Defendants’ appeal.

5 In the present proceedings the Defendants alleged that the order made in the
interpleader proceedings to release the goods to the Plaintiff was procured by
fraud on the part of the Plaintiff and her husband, Arif. Therefore there is a
triable issue and interlocutory judgment ought not to be given. I should add
that this is not pleaded in the Defence filed by the Defendants in this
action. It is only alleged in the affidavits filed by the Defendants in
opposition to the application for summary judgment. Be that as it may, I shall
assume that the Defendants’ allegation is _bona fide_ and that they would have
been permitted to take that position on affidavit in opposing summary
judgment.

6 The allegation of fraud is as follows. In the course of giving instructions
to the Defendants when they were acting for him, Arif had confirmed that
Bhadhar Point belonged to him. The Defendant showed how it was previously
known as Arif Jamal Kiosk. The Plaintiff had produced a deed of assignment
dated 20 September 1991 which showed that Arif had assigned the business,
along with the kiosk, to her. This transfer was effected some three years
before the seizure. Since that time the business had been registered in the
Plaintiff's name in the Registry of Businesses. However the Defendants gave a
number of reasons why this was a sham. I do not propose to set these out as
they are not relevant for my present purposes. Suffice it to say that it
necessarily involves the Plaintiff and Arif committing perjury in the hearing
of the interpleader summons.

7 The main problem with the Defendants’ case is that they ought to have raised
the question of fraud at the hearing on the interpleader summons. O 17 r 5,
which sets out the powers of the Court in such a hearing, states as follows:

> > 5\. —(1) Where on the hearing of a summons under this Order all the
> persons by whom adverse claims to the subject-matter in dispute (referred to
> in this Order as the claimants) appear, the Court may order —
>>

>> (a) that any claimant be made a defendant in any action pending with
respect to the subject-matter in dispute in substitution for or in addition to
the applicant for relief under this Order; or

>>

>> (b) that an issue between the claimants be stated and tried and may direct
which of the claimants is to be plaintiff and which defendant.

>>

>> (2) Where —

>>

>> (a) the applicant on a summons under this Order is the Sheriff;

>>

>> (b) all the claimants consent or any of them so requests; or

>>

>> (c) the question at issue between the claimants is a question of law and
the facts are not in dispute,

>>

>> the Court may summarily determine the question at issue between the
claimants and make an order accordingly on such terms as may be just.

>>

>> (3) Where a claimant, having been duly served with a summons for relief
under this Order, does not appear on the hearing of the summons or, having
appeared, fails or refuses to comply with an order made in the proceedings,
the Court may make an order declaring the claimant, and all persons claiming
under him, for ever barred from prosecuting his claim against the applicant
for such relief and all persons claiming under him, but such an order shall
not affect the rights of the claimants as between themselves.

8 If the allegation of fraud had been made at that stage, the Court would
ordinarily have ordered the matter to determined in a trial pursuant to r
5(1)(b). The purpose of the interpleader procedure is to make a finding of the
rights of the parties in respect of any goods in the possession of a third
party. Those are the proceedings in which the Defendants ought to have raised
the issue of fraud of which they had knowledge at the time. Counsel for the
Defendants alleged before me that this issue was indeed raised before the
District Judge at the hearing of the interpleader summons. He made certain
allegations as to the directions of the judge which I do not need to go into
for the reason that it was open to the Defendants to appeal against his
decision if they were not satisfied with it. They did not and there is an
issue estoppel against the Defendants in respect of the ownership of the goods
in the present proceedings.

9 The Defendants submit that, because the order in the interpleader summons
was procured by the fraud of the Plaintiff and Arif, it may be reopened. They
rely on s 46 of the Evidence Act which provides as follows:

> > 46\. Any party to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment,
> order or decree which is relevant under section 42, 43 or 44, and which has
> been proved by the adverse party, was delivered by a court not competent to
> deliver it or was obtained by fraud or collusion.

The Defendants say that because the order made under the interpleader summons
was procured by fraud, it is relevant and may be proved in the present
proceedings.

10 First of all, I should state that I am extremely surprised at the
proposition that a party can avoid issue estoppel or _res judicata_ by
alleging that an order obtained in a court in Singapore was procured by fraud
where he was aware of the fraud but did not raise it in the earlier action, or
if he did, did not appeal against it. If that were correct, then no judgment
would be final in that a party can raise fraud in a subsequent action.

11 I do not think that s 46 is as wide as the Defendants contend.
Unfortunately counsel for both parties have not been able to unearth any
authority in Singapore or in Malaysia that could assist in its interpretation.
However there is a commentary in _Sarkar’s Law of Evidence_ , 13th Ed that is
helpful. I do not propose to discuss that in any detail, save to say that the
editors opine that the fraud contemplated in this provision must be an
extrinsic act unconnected with the matter adjudicated upon, e.g. fraud by
which a litigant is prevented from appearing and placing his case before the
court at trial. They are of the view that it does not apply to an allegation
that a party had committed perjury in the earlier action. The editors cite the
following passage from the judgment of Petheram CJ in _Md Gulab v Md Sulliman_
21 C 612 @ p 619:

> > The principle upon which these decisions rest is that where a decree has
> been obtained by a fraud practised upon the other side, by which he was
> prevented from placing his case before the tribunal, which was called upon
> to adjudicate upon it in the way most to his advantage, the decree is not
> binding upon him, and may be set aside …, but I am not aware that it has
> ever been suggested in any decided case; and in my opinion it is not the law
> that because a person against whom a decree had been passed alleges that it
> was wrong and that it was obtained by perjury committed by, or at the
> instance of, the other party, which is of course fraud of the worst kind,
> that he can obtain a re-hearing of the questions in dispute in a fresh
> action by merely changing the form in which he places it before the Court,
> and alleging in his plaint that the first decree was obtained by the perjury
> of the person in whose favour it was given. To so hold would be to allow
> defeated litigants to avoid the operation not only of the law which
> regulates appeals, but of that which relates to _res judicata_ as well.

I respectfully agree with this reasoning and on that basis, I held that the
Defendants could not rely on s 46 of the Evidence Act to raise the allegation
of fraud in the present case in order to avoid being estopped from asserting
that the goods in question do not belong to the Plaintiff.
