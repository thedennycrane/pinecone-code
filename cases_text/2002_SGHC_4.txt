**Judgment**

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. The applicant, Ms Kang Ngah Wei @ Charlene, whose driving licence was
revoked by the Commander of Traffic Police on 15 October 2001, sought leave to
apply for an order of certiorari to quash the decision to revoke her driving
licence. Mr Jeffrey Chan, Senior State Counsel, who appeared for the Commander
of Traffic Police, objected to leave being granted to her to apply for the
said order. _**

  
Background

**_

2\. Ms Kang was involved in a motor accident along Lornie Road on 19 September
2001 at 4.30 am. Her car hit a lamp post. She filed a report with the traffic
police on the same day at 7.15 pm. In it, she stated as follows:

> On 19 Sept 2001 at about 4.30 am to 5 am after dropping a friend’s son off
> at Andrew Road, I proceed to Bukit Timah via Lornie Road. I was going home.
> I was travelling on the left first lane.
>
> I had an _acute asthma attack_ which resulted in my car swerving up a
> pavement. _In my state of health_ and shock I [stepped] on the accelerator
> and the car [moved] forward and hit a lamp post.

> (emphasis added)

3\. Ms Kang also forwarded to the traffic police a letter dated 19 September
2001 from a Dr Vida Chou from the Family Health Medical Centre. In it, Dr Chou
stated as follows:

> She has had bronchial asthma since childhood and uses inhalers when
> necessary. She suffered from an acute attack of asthma last night and had
> difficulty breathing, while driving at 4.30 am this morning. This is for
> your information.

4\. In view of the fact that Ms Kang claimed that the traffic accident in
question was caused while she suffered from an acute attack of asthma, the
Commander of Traffic Police decided to revoke her driving licence. On 15
October 2001, the traffic police sent Ms Kang a letter, which stated as
follows:

> It has been reported that you were involved in a traffic accident on 19
> September 2001 at about 5.00 hours along Lornie Road. You were suffering
> from an acute attack of asthma at [the] time of the accident. A medical
> report from Dr Vida Chou of the Family Heath Medical Centre reflects that
> you were suffering from an acute attack of asthma and had difficulty
> breathing while driving at 4.30 am.
>
> For the safety of yourself and other road users, it has been decided to
> revoke your driving licence. Please surrender your driving licence … within
> two weeks of the receipt of this letter.

5\. Ms Kang, who decided to challenge the decision of the Commander of Traffic
Police, applied for leave to apply for an order of certiorari to quash the
decision.

_**

  
Test for determining whether or not leave should be granted

**_

6\. The test for determining whether or not leave should be granted to a
person to apply for an order of certiorari was considered by the Court of
Appeal in _Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda_[2001] 1 SLR 644,
653\. In that case, LP Thean JA, who adopted Lord Diplock’s threshold test in
_National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses Ltd_[1982] AC 617,
said at p 653:

> Leave would be granted, if there appears to be a point which might, on
> further consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour of granting
> to the applicant the relief claimed.

_**

  
Relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Act

** ___

7\. At this juncture, the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Act (Cap
276) which empower the police to revoke the driving licence of a person who is
a source of danger to the public ought to be considered. Section 37(6) of the
Act provides as follows:

> If it appears to the Deputy Commissioner of Police that there is reason to
> believe that any person who holds a driving licence is suffering from a
> disease or physical disability likely to cause the driving by him of a motor
> vehicle, being a motor vehicle of any such class or description as he is
> authorised by the licence to drive, to be a source of danger to the public
> and, _after making such inquiry as he considers necessary_ , _the Deputy
> Commissioner of Police_ _is satisfied_ that the licence holder is suffering
> as aforesaid then, whether or not the licence holder so suffering as
> aforesaid has previously passed a test under this section, the Deputy
> Commissioner of Police may, after giving to the licence holder notice of
> such intention, revoke the driving licence.

> (emphasis added)

8\. By virtue of section 2 of the Road Traffic Act, the term "Deputy
Commissioner of Police" includes any police officer not below the rank of
sergeant authorised by him in writing by name or office to exercise the powers
vested by the Act in the Deputy Commissioner of Police. As has been mentioned,
in the present case, it was the Commander of Traffic Police who revoked Ms
Kang’s driving licence.

9\. Section 37(8) of the Act provides a mechanism for a person whose licence
has been revoked on the ground of public safety to attempt to get back his
licence. It provides as follows:

> The licence holder may, except in the case of such diseases and disabilities
> as may be prescribed, claim to be subjected to a test as to his fitness or
> disability to drive a motor vehicle and, if he passes the prescribed test,
> the driving licence shall not be revoked or, if it has already been revoked,
> shall be returned to the licence holder and the revocation thereof shall be
> rescinded.
>
> ****

Ms Kang’s grounds for seeking leave

_

10\. Ms Kang attacked the decision of the Commander of Traffic Police to
revoke her driving licence on the grounds of procedural impropriety and/or
breach of the rules of natural justice and/or unreasonableness.

__

  
Whether there has been procedural impropriety or a breach of the rules of
natural justice

__

11\. Ms Kang’s assertion that the decision to revoke her driving licence was
flawed on the ground of procedural impropriety or a breach of the rules of
natural justice will first be considered. Her position was put as follows:

> Aside from the letter from the traffic police dated 15 October 2001 and the
> police report filed by the Plaintiff, there were no correspondence by letter
> or telephone between the Plaintiff and the traffic police. Neither were
> there any meetings, interviews or discussions between the traffic police and
> the Plaintiff to ascertain her medical condition to determine whether it was
> severe enough to warrant revoking her licence. The decision is
> disproportionate to the cause of the accident and to the Plaintiff’s
> asthmatic condition.

12\. Section 37(6) of the Road Traffic Act does not require the police to hold
an inquiry or an oral hearing before revoking a driver’s licence in the
interest of public safety. It provides that if the Deputy Commissioner of
Police is satisfied after making _such inquiry as he considers necessary_ that
a driver is a source of danger to the public, notice of an intention to revoke
that driver’s driving licence may be given. Admittedly, the Deputy
Commissioner’s decision is not outside the ambit of judicial scrutiny
altogether. In _Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside
Metropolitan Borough Council_[1977] AC 1014, 1047, Lord Wilberforce, while
referring to an English statutory provision, said:

> The section is framed in a ‘subjective’ form – if the Secretary of State ‘is
> satisfied’. This form of section is quite well known, and at first sight
> might seem to exclude judicial review. Sections in this form may, no doubt,
> exclude judicial review on what is or has become a matter of pure judgment.
> But I do not think that they go further than that. If a judgment requires,
> before it can be made, the existence of some facts, then, although the
> evaluation of those facts is for the Secretary of State alone, the court
> must inquire whether those facts exist, and have been taken into account,
> whether the judgment has been made upon a proper self-direction as to those
> facts, whether the judgment has not been made upon other facts which ought
> not to have been taken into account.

13\. In the present case, the relevant facts are not in dispute. The Commander
of Traffic Police did not act on the basis of a third party’s uncorroborated
allegation that Ms Kang caused an accident while having an acute asthmatic
attack. Instead, he acted on the basis of Ms Kang’s own admission that the
accident was caused by her loss of control of her vehicle as a result of an
acute asthmatic attack. In her police report, she used words such as "in my
state of health and shock" when referring to the acute asthma attack suffered
by her and her own doctor confirmed that she suffered from an acute attack of
asthma at the time of the accident. The letter which was sent to her by the
traffic police on 15 October 2001 referred to the fact that the accident
occurred while she had an asthma attack and to the medical report submitted by
her. The Commander of Traffic Police’s decision to revoke her driving licence
was, in Lord Wilberforce’s words, made "upon a proper self-direction as to
those facts" and "not upon other facts which ought not to have been taken into
account".

14\. There is thus no reason for suggesting that the decision of the Commander
of Traffic Police to revoke Ms Kang’s driving licence is flawed because of
procedural impropriety or a breach of the rules of natural justice. In short,
as far as Ms Kang’s first ground for attacking the decision of the Commander
of Traffic Police is concerned, there is no point which might, on further
consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour of granting her the
relief claimed.

__

  
Whether the decision to revoke Ms Kang’s licence was unreasonable

__

15\. I now turn to Ms Kang’s second ground for leave to apply for an order of
certiorari, namely the unreasonableness of the decision to revoke her driving
licence. Whether or not the decision of the police to revoke Ms Kang’s licence
is unreasonable must be viewed in the light of what has been termed
"_Wednesbury_ unreasonableness". In _Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd
v Wednesbury Corporation_ [1948] 1 KB 223, 233, Lord Greene MR explained:

> The court is entitled to investigate the action of the local authority with
> a view to seeing whether they have taken into account matters which they
> ought not to take into account, or, conversely, have refused to take into
> account or neglected to take into account matters which they ought to take
> into account. Once that question is answered in favour of the local
> authority, it may be still possible to say that, although the local
> authority have kept within the four corners of the matters which they ought
> to consider, they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable
> that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it. In such a case,
> again, I think the court can interfere.

16\. It is important to note that Lord Greene MR added that the power of the
court to interfere on the ground of unreasonableness "is not as an appellate
authority to override a decision of the local authority, but as a judicial
authority which is concerned, and concerned only, to see whether the local
authority have contravened the law by acting in excess of the powers which
Parliament has confided in them". He added that it is not what the court
considers unreasonable that matters. What is relevant is whether or not a
decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come
to it. In _Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for Civil Service_[1985]
1 AC 374, 411, Lord Diplock, while referring to "_Wednesbury_
unreasonableness" said that it "applies to a decision which is so outrageous
in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible
person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have
arrived at it".

17\. Ms Kang argued that the decision of the Commander of Traffic Police is
disproportionate to the cause of the accident and to her asthmatic condition.
Her position was put as follows:

> The Plaintiff is under medication for her asthma and has a clean driving
> record since she obtained her licence in 1996. Her licence has never been
> suspended or revoked. Her asthmatic condition is and has always been under
> control and it was unfortunate that she had a particularly bad attack on 19
> September 2001. The Plaintiff’s condition was aggravated by the coolness of
> the early morning at 4.30 am. The Plaintiff will be taking greater
> precautions to ensure that such an accident does not occur again. The
> Plaintiff suffers only about 3-5 attacks a year and is not a chronic
> sufferer. The Plaintiff does not usually drive her car at 4.30 am. She is
> mainly a day driver.

18\. On the facts, the decision of the Commander of Traffic Police is
certainly not one that is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of
accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to
the question to be decided could have arrived at it. As such, as far as Ms
Kang’s second ground for attacking the decision of the Commander of Traffic
Police is concerned, there is also no point which might, on further
consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour of granting her the
relief claimed.

_**

  
Ms Kang has not utilised the mechanism under section 37(8) of the Act to get
back her driving licence

**_

19\. It should not be overlooked that Ms Kang has not utilised the mechanism
provided for in section 37(8) of the Road Traffic Act, which has been referred
to above, to get back her driving licence. In fact, after she initiated the
present proceedings, the traffic police invited her to take a prescribed
medical test and to furnish additional medical information as to why her
licence should not be revoked. On 2 November 2001, the traffic police sent her
the following letter:

> I refer to my letter dated 15 October 2001.

> 2\. To-date, we have not received your driving licence.
>
> 3\. The reasons forwarded by your lawyer on your behalf have been considered
> by us. They are not sufficient to assure us that you would not be a danger
> to other road users. We are prepared to consider any additional evidence
> that you may have to support your claims that you should not be subjected to
> the revocation of your driving licence. This should be submitted to us by 18
> November 2001. You should also let us know if you are prepared to undergo
> medical examination by a specialist nominated by us.
>
> 4\. If you do not wish to provide additional medical evidence or be
> medically examined, then you should forthwith surrender your driving
> licence. In any event you should not drive any vehicle on the road until you
> hear from us.

20\. Ms Kang did not respond to the offer. Her counsel, Mr Andrew Hanam,
pointed out that the offer to her to take a prescribed test, which was made
after the decision to revoke her licence, is irrelevant for the purpose of
considering whether the original decision is flawed. He added that before Ms
Kang is prepared to take the prescribed test or furnish additional information
to satisfy the traffic police that she is not a source of danger to the
public, the Commander of Traffic Police must accept that his decision to
revoke her licence is wrong and pay the costs of these proceedings. If that is
her stand, she cannot complain if the traffic police have not reversed the
decision to revoke her driving licence.

21\. In the final analysis, it ought not be overlooked that the traffic police
have a duty to act in the interest of the safety of drivers and other users of
roads. As such, the power of the traffic police to revoke a driver’s driving
licence under section 37(6) of the Road Traffic Act to protect members of the
public should not be unnecessarily fettered. So long as the Deputy
Commissioner of Police, and anyone legitimately exercising his powers, is
satisfied, after making such inquiry as is considered necessary, that the
revocation of a person’s driving licence is in the interest of the public,
that person should, without more, exercise his right under section 37(8) of
the Act to be subjected to a test as to his fitness to drive a motor vehicle
rather than seek an order of certiorari.

_**

  
Conclusion

**_

22\. Admittedly, the test for granting leave to an applicant to apply for an
order of certiorari involves a very low threshold. All the same, it is
pertinent to note that in _Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin,
Linda_[2001] 1 SLR 644, 653, LP Thean JA reiterated that the requirement of
leave to apply for such an order is intended to be a means of filtering out
groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage, and its aim is to prevent a
wasteful use of judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment,
whether intentional or otherwise. The present application is clearly one where
the granting of leave will waste judicial time and unnecessarily harass the
traffic police. As has been mentioned, Ms Kang has the opportunity to present
further medical evidence to the traffic police and to take a prescribed
medical test to show that she is fit to drive a motor vehicle. Taking all
circumstances into account, her application for leave to apply for an order of
certiorari is dismissed with costs.
