** Judgment **

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

This was a criminal motion by the applicant seeking an alteration of the High
Courts order dated 26 March 2002 that the applicant surrender himself to
prison authorities and commence serving his sentence of imprisonment on 3 June
2002.

_

The facts

_

2 The applicant is the general manager of Dennis General Contractor Pte Ltd
("Dennis General Contractor"), a sub-contractor involved in the construction
of the Chinatown station along Singapores proposed North East Mass Rapid
Transit ("MRT") rail line which is slated for completion at the end of 2002.
At or about March 2001, Dennis General Contractor was awarded a contract to
supply and install the roof system and various glazing works of the Chinatown
station and related commercial developments.

3 Following a trial, on 25 August 2001, the applicant was convicted by a
district court of four charges of abetment by conspiracy to cheat, punishable
under s 109 read with s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). In total, he was
sentenced to three years imprisonment. Bail was granted pending his appeal
against conviction.

4 On 26 March 2002, however, counsel for the applicant appeared before the
High Court and applied for leave to withdraw the applicants appeal. I granted
the application.

5 Counsel also applied for leave to postpone the commencement of the sentence
of imprisonment for two months so as to allow the applicant time to complete
outstanding works awarded to Dennis General Contractor by the end of May 2002.
Leave was granted and the applicants sentence was postponed and ordered to
commence on 3 June 2002. Bail was accordingly extended.

6 On 21 May 2002, the applicant filed the current criminal motion for an
alteration of the 26 March 2002 order that he be allowed to commence serving
his sentence on 1 August 2002 instead. On 23 May 2002, I heard and dismissed
the application. I now give my reasons.

_The criminal motion_

7 Section 223 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) ("CPC") states:

> Date of commencement of sentence

223**.** Subject to the provisions of this Code and of the Supreme Court of
Judicature Act, every sentence of imprisonment to which section 221 or 222
apply shall take effect from the date on which it was passed, unless the court
passing the sentence or when there has been an appeal the appellate court
otherwise directs.

8 The usual position is therefore clear: unless the sentencing court or the
appellate court exercises its discretion to postpone the commencement of a
sentence of imprisonment, sentence shall take effect from the date on which it
is passed. An exception is provided in s 234(1) of the CPC where, if a person
who is an escaped convict or is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is
sentenced to imprisonment, the latter sentence of imprisonment shall commence
either immediately or at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he was
previously sentenced as the court awarding the sentence directs.

9 In the recent case of _Lim Teck Leng Roland v PP_ [2001] 4 SLR 61, Roland
Lim was convicted of a number of traffic offences. After having been granted
an order allowing him to delay the commencement of his sentence of
imprisonment by two weeks to settle personal and work matters, he applied to
court on the due date for an order that sentence be postponed for a further
two weeks. While noting that I was able to alter my own previous decision and
grant an alteration of that order to provide for a further postponement of the
commencement of the sentence, I rejected Roland Lims application and stated at
16 :

> However, this still leaves the issue of when and in what circumstances the
> High Court would consider a further extension of time before serving the
> sentence. It would be impossible to lay down a clear-cut guideline. It is
> possible that during the period of extension, the applicant may suffer from
> illness which necessitates treatment in hospitals or other places where
> better facilities are available. It might be that a further extension would
> be justifiable as the applicants close relative or a member of immediate
> family happened to suffer from serious illness. Different conditions and
> circumstances could arise that would necessitate or justify an order of
> further extension of time before serving the sentence. Ultimately, the court
> would be guided by whether the interests of justice require that discretion
> be exercised to allow the applicant a further period of time before he
> serves his sentence. At the same time, the court must take a robust approach
> and ensure that the discretion not be abused by frivolous requests from the
> applicant. The burden is always on the applicant to show and explain that
> the circumstances and conditions are of such a dire and serious nature or of
> such urgency that they merit the exercise of discretion by the court to
> grant a further period of time before he serves his sentence.

10 In the exercise of the courts discretion, the paramount consideration would
be the applicants reasons for the further postponement of sentence. In my
opinion, the court should also have regard to all the circumstances of the
case, including the length of time granted by the court in the first instance,
the reasons given in support of that application in the first instance and the
length of the additional time being sought. Further, seeing as there would be
the attendant need for bail to be extended, the usual considerations with
respect to bail being granted following a conviction would also be relevant.
In _Ralph v PP_ [1972] 1 MLJ 242.1 AV Winslow J suggested that relevant
factors include the gravity or otherwise of the offence, the offenders
criminal record, if any, the possibility of the applicant offending or re-
offending whilst at liberty and whether the security imposed will ensure the
attendance of the appellant before the appellate court. It is obvious that
there is a plethora of factors which the court has to take into account before
a further postponement may be granted, but, as it was stated in Roland Lims
case, the burden lies on an applicant to satisfy the court that the peculiar
circumstances and conditions in his case necessitate the courts exercise of
its discretion to postpone the commencement of his sentence for a second time.
The success of each application depends on the full facts of the case and the
circumstances of the applicant. Ultimately, the courts must adopt a robust
approach, weighing the reasonableness of the applicants request against the
justice of the case. While the court should take a humane approach in
deserving cases, the discretion to postpone should be exercised judiciously
and only where good reasons exist.

_

Appropriate length of a postponement

_

11 In deserving cases where the court is minded to extend time, I noted that
the only provision in the CPC which provides for the suspension of the
execution of the sentence is found in s 225 which states:

> Suspension of execution in certain cases

225\. When an offender has been sentenced to fine only and to imprisonment in
default of payment of the fine and the court issues a warrant under section
224, it may suspend the execution of the sentence of imprisonment and may
release the offender on his executing a bond with or without sureties, as the
court thinks fit, conditioned for his appearance before that court on the day
appointed for the return of the warrant, such day not being more than 15 days
from the time of executing the bond, and in the event of the fine not having
been realised the court may direct the sentence of imprisonment to be carried
into execution at once.

12 In cases where an offender has not been sentenced to only a fine and to
imprisonment in default of that fine, s 225 of the CPC would not apply.
Nevertheless, I regarded the spirit behind s 225 to be instructive and held
that unless the circumstances in the case are overwhelmingly urgent thereby
requiring the applicants immediate attention, or if the interests of justice
otherwise demands it, the court granting a postponement of the commencement of
a sentence of imprisonment should not ordinarily grant reprieve in excess of
15 days.

_

The current application

_

13 In the current case, the applicant stated at 6 of his supporting affidavit
that Dennis General Contractors outstanding works could not be finished on
time and that he was "rushing to complete the projects in time so as not to
disrupt the opening of the North-eastern line of the MRT". He further stated
that he had "been instructed to personally supervise the works undertaken to
ensure that the MRT project will complete on time." In support of his
application, the applicant attached a letter addressed to Dennis General
Contractor dated 17 May 2002 from the construction manager of the awarding
contractors, Mero Asia Pacific Pte Ltd ("Mero") stating:

> In order to complete the project in time and to minimise disruption to the
> estimated time of completion, you are hereby required to do the following:

> (a) Complete your sub-contract works before mid July 2002.
>
> (b) Give the sub-contract works your personal supervision during this
> critical phase of the project, and provide updates of the progress of your
> works.

Please note that we have instructions from the main contractors to complete
the project within the time frame given to us. Please note that we require you
to give your personal attention to this project, meaning that we require your
physical presence at the job site.

14 The contents of Meros letter did little to advance the applicants case.
Notably, there was no mention that the sub-contract works had been delayed and
if any delay was caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the applicants
control. All that was before the court was the applicants bare assertion that
the sub-contract works could not be completed on time. In my view, this was
simply not good enough. On 26 March 2002, the applicant had successfully
applied to the court for a two month extension on the basis that he was
building the Chinatown station. He was therefore precluded from coming before
the court again to apply for a further extension using the same reason. On
that date, the court weighed the public interest factor heavily in his favour
and granted the exceptional two month postponement. Even if the applicants
assertion was true, granting a further postponement of the sentence would send
out a wrong message that the interests of justice may be made subordinate to
other considerations. Justice cannot be made to wait indefinitely for the
applicant to commence his sentence.

15 In any event, I was not inclined to grant a second postponement in the
light of the circumstances: Dennis General Contractors contracts were awarded
around March 2001. The proceedings relating to the applicants trial at the
district court were held on various dates in March, April, July, August, and
September 2001. By 25 August 2001, the applicant was already convicted. At
that stage, he should have made final arrangements for a replacement to be
found to supervise the work or for Dennis General Contractors contractual
liabilities to be taken over by another contractor in the event that bail
pending his appeal would not be granted. In any case, the applicant was
granted reprieve when bail was granted. When he applied to withdraw his appeal
on 26 March 2002, the court further indulged him by granting him a total
extension of two months eight days for the commencement of his three year
sentence. In the circumstances, the applicant had clearly been granted more
than enough time to settle his work commitments.

16 Further, I rejected the applicants contention that his "personal
supervision" and "physical presence" at the site were required. It was not as
if the sub-contract works were of such a complex nature that required his
special and unique expertise. Dennis General Contractor was merely engaged to
provide and install roofing and glazing works for the Chinatown station and an
alternative contractor or supervisor could easily be found. In any case, the
applicant had a further ten days from the date of the hearing of the motion to
the scheduled date for the commencement of his sentence to settle his affairs.
This ought to be sufficient.

_Conclusion_

17 For the reasons given above, the criminal motion was dismissed.
Accordingly, the applicant should adhere to the 26 March 2002 court order and
surrender himself to the prison authorities on 3 June 2002 to commence serving
his sentence.
