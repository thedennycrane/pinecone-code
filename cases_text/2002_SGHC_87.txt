Facts

On 18 July 2000, the applicant, Thanabalan, commenced an action against the
respondent, Chua, in the District Court for damages for personal injury
arising from a traffic accident. Thanabalan subsequently obtained an
interlocutory judgment, by consent, with damages to be assessed. On 11 January
2002, Thanabalan filed an application to transfer the proceedings in the
District Court to the High Court on the ground that in view of certain medical
reports, the damages he sought might well exceed the $250,000 jurisdictional
limit of the District Court. Chua resisted the application on the ground that
it was unlikely that Thanabalan’s damages would exceed $250,000.

Held

**, dismissing the application:

> (1) Paragraph 10 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature
> Act ("SCJA") and s 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act should be read together.
> Although the High Court had a wide power to transfer proceedings from the
> District Court to the High Court under para 10, the grounds for doing so

>
> (2) Thanabalan’s claim did not involve some important question of law nor

> reason for the transfer (see 13).
>
> (3) That the damages sought might well exceed $250,000 would usually
> constitute sufficient reason to transfer the proceedings to the High Court
> (see 13). However, it was doubtful whether the High Court had the power to

**Judgment**

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

_**

Introduction

**_1\. The Applicant Ricky Charles s/o Gopal Thanabalan claims against the
Respondent Chua Boon Yeow for damages for personal injury arising from an
accident on 25 December 1995 in which a car driven by the Respondent collided
into a motorcycle which the Applicant was riding on._**

**_ 2\. On 18 July 2000, the Applicant filed an action in the District Court
against the Respondent. Subsequently, the Applicant obtained an interlocutory
judgment from the District Court against the Respondent, by consent, with
damages to be assessed._**

**_ 3\. Thereafter on 11 January 2002, the Applicant filed the present
application i.e Originating Summons No 46 of 2002/W to transfer the
proceedings in the District Court to the High Court pursuant to s 18(2) of the
Supreme Court of Judicature Act (‘SCJA’) and O 89 r 2 of the Rules of Court
1999._**

**_ 4\. The sole ground on which the application was made was that the damages
sought by the Applicant may well exceed $250,000 i.e the limit of the civil
jurisdiction of the District Court in view of certain medical reports._**

**_ 5\. The application was initially resisted on the ground that it was
unlikely that the Applicant’s damages would exceed $250,000 in view of a
surveillance of the Applicant which the Respondent had caused to be undertaken
and a medical report obtained by the Respondent. However, notwithstanding
these two reports, it was not possible for me to say, at this stage, that the
Applicant’s damages would necessarily be less than $250,000.

6\. However, I had a concern. As interlocutory judgment had already been
granted by the District Court, it seemed strange to me that there would be
another judgment or order, this time from the High Court, on the same cause of
action but regarding the quantum of damages.

7\. Eventually, after hearing arguments, I dismissed the application on 12
April 2002 with some costs to be paid to the Respondent in any event.

**_  
The legislation_**

8\. Section 18 SCJA states:

> ‘Power of High Court
>
> 18.(1) The High Court shall have such powers as are vested in it _by any
> written law_ for the time being in force in Singapore.
>
> (2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court
> shall have the powers set out _in the First Schedule_.
>
> (3) The powers referred to in subsection (2) shall be exercised in
> accordance with _any written law_ or Rules of Court relating to them.’
>
> [Emphasis added.]

9\. Clause 10 of the First Schedule to the SCJA states:

> ‘Transfer of proceedings
>
> 10\. Power to transfer any proceedings to any other court or to or from any
> subordinate court, and in the case of _transfer_ to or _from a subordinate
> court_ to give any directions _as to the further conduct thereof_ , except
> that this power shall be exercised in such manner as may be prescribed by
> Rules of Court.’
>
> [Emphasis added.]

10\. Section 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) states:

> **‘General power to transfer from District Court to High Court**

> 38\. Where it is made to appear to the High Court, on the application of a
> party to any civil proceeding pending in a District Court, that the
> proceeding by reason of its involving some important question of law, or
> being a test case, or for any other sufficient reason, is one which should
> be tried in the High Court, it may order the record to be transferred to the
> High Court.’

11\. I would add that in so far as the application also relies on O 89 r 2 of
the Rules of Court, this provision is immaterial as it applies only where an
order is made for the transfer of proceedings from the Subordinate Courts
(which includes the District Court) to the High Court.

12\. I was of the view that Clause 10 of the First Schedule to the SCJA and s
38 of the Subordinate Courts Act should be read together. Although the High
Court has a wide power to transfer proceedings from the District Court to the
High Court, under Clause 10, the grounds for doing so should come under one of
the limbs in s 38.

13\. It was not suggested that the Applicant’s claim involved some question of
law or was a test case. The sole ground for his application was, as I have
said, that the damages may well exceed $250,000. This would usually constitute
sufficient reason to transfer the proceedings to the High Court.

14\. However, in view of the Interlocutory Judgment granted by the District
Court, I doubted that the High Court even had the jurisdiction to order the
transfer at this stage of the proceedings.

15\. Mr Perumal Athitham, Counsel for the Applicant, cited the case of
Australian Master Builders Co Pty Ltd v Ng Tai Tuan [1988] 1 MLJ 273.

16\. In that case, the plaintiffs had commenced an action in the High Court
for $65,215.25 for goods sold and delivered to the defendant. The plaintiffs
obtained summary judgment for $10,848 and the defendant was ordered to furnish
security for the balance of the claim i.e $54,367.25. The plaintiffs decided
to reduce the quantum of the balance of the claim to $50,000 by abandoning the
excess so as to bring the balance within the then jurisdiction of the District
Court which was $50,000. The Defendant objected on the basis that since the
plaintiffs had already obtained judgment for $10,848, their overall claim,
including the reduced balance of $50,000 was still more than $50,000.

17\. Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) found this a rather perplexed form of
argument as the $10,848, having been adjudged in favour of the plaintiffs,
could not possibly be regarded as a claim. He went on to consider the then s
38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) which stated:

> ‘In any action commenced by way of writ of summons in the High Court in the
> exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, any party may for any
> sufficient reason at any time apply to the High Court for an order that the
> proceedings be transferred to a District Court, and the High Court may
> thereupon, if it thinks fits, order that the proceedings be transferred
> accordingly notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act.’

18\. In Chan JC’s view, this section was clear. It gave ‘the High Court an
unfettered discretion to transfer at any time any proceedings commenced by
writ of summons to the District Court. The words "notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Act" have the effect of vesting in the High Court the
jurisdiction to increase the ordinary civil jurisdiction of the District
Court’.

19\. Having said that, he then went on to say that the next issue was whether
the proceedings should be transferred to the District Court and it was not
desirable to lay down specific rules as to when the court should exercise its
discretion. ‘Each application must be decided on its own merits’. He
considered that a valid reason would be where the proceedings have come within
the ordinary jurisdiction of the District Court whether by a change in the
law, by consent or by a party reducing his claim. In the circumstances, he
ordered a transfer to the District Court.

20\. As can be seen, the facts in that case were different from those before
me. There was no interlocutory judgment in favour of the plaintiffs there for
the balance of their claim and the application was to transfer the High Court
proceedings to the District Court with a corresponding reduction in the
balance of the claim.

21\. Ultimately, I still doubted whether the High Court does have the power to
transfer proceedings from the District Court to the High Court if there is an
interlocutory judgment from the District Court. This is notwithstanding the
words in Clause 10 of the First Schedule SCJA ‘and … to give any directions as
to the further conduct thereof …’. In my view, the limit of damages is fixed
once interlocutory judgment is entered. It will not be a question of
increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court since the damages will then
be assessed in the High Court. It will be a question of circumventing the
limit under the interlocutory judgment of the District Court.

22\. Moreover, even if the High Court has the power to transfer the
proceedings notwithstanding the interlocutory judgment, it was still for the
Applicant to persuade me to exercise my discretionary power in his favour.

23\. Mr Perumal submitted that had the action been initiated in the High
Court, the Respondent would have consented to an interlocutory judgment from
the High Court in any event. Hence the existence of the interlocutory judgment
from the District Court should not deny the Applicant the transfer. I did not
accept such an argument. While it may well be that the Respondent would have
consented to an interlocutory judgment from the High Court, that is neither
here nor there. The fact is that the interlocutory judgment was from the
District Court.

24\. If the assessment of damages is conducted without any transfer of the
proceedings to the High Court, the damages to be awarded will, as I have said,
be circumscribed by the jurisdiction of the District Court. The parties have
proceeded on that basis and consent interlocutory judgment was entered on that
basis. I was of the view that it was too late for the Applicant to try and
overcome this by applying to transfer the proceedings to the High Court.

25\. In the circumstances, I dismissed the application._****_
