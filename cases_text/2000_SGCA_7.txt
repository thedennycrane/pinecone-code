(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an appeal from the
decision of the High Court in SIC 3257/99 in which it stayed the proceedings
in Suit 658/99 pursuant to s 7 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10) (the `Act`)
upon the application of the defendants, who were the respondents in this
appeal. At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed the appeal. We now give
our reasons.  
  
**_The facts_**

****

The respondents were the developer of a factory at Kaki Bukit Road 3 (the
`project`). The appellants were a building contractor engaged by the
respondents as the main contractor for the project pursuant to a building
contract (the `contract`). The contract incorporated the Singapore Institute
of Architects Conditions of Building Contract (the `SIA Conditions`). In the
course of the works, the respondents failed to make payments under five
interim certificates issued by the project architect. The appellants brought
Suit 658/99 against the respondents to claim payment in respect of those five
certificates, including interest and costs. The total amount outstanding under
the five certificates was $5,469,137.04.  
  
The respondents denied liability on two grounds. The first was that the
respondents had paid $2m to the appellants` director, Chwee Meng Chong
(`Chwee`) and the appellants had agreed that this sum would go towards
reducing the amount owed by the respondents to the appellants under the
interim certificates. Secondly, the appellants had agreed that the balance of
$3,469,137.04 need not be paid until a sum of $9.46m was paid to the
respondents by the appellants` associated company, How Hwa Investment Pte Ltd.
The background to the alleged two agreements is as follows.  
  
In 1994, one Ho Mun Fei (`Ho`) and Chng Heng Tiu (`Chng`) jointly tendered for
the project site and when they succeeded, they incorporated the respondent
company and assigned to it the tender award. Chng`s company, Chng Heng Tiu Pte
Ltd and his associates (the `Chng group`), including Chwee, held 64% of the
shares in the respondent company. Chwee himself held 5% of the shares in the
respondent company. The other 36% was held by Ho and his brother (the `Ho
group`).  
  
The respondents commenced the development of the project. In late 1997, there
arose a dispute between the two groups and the Ho group decided to acquire the
Chng group`s 64% shareholding in the respondents through their company,
Straits International Resources Pte Ltd (`SIR`). On 1 December 1997, an
agreement was entered into between members of the Chng group as vendors and
SIR as purchasers of the former`s shareholding in the respondents. The
purchase price was payable in instalments. In February 1998, SIR stopped
payment on these instalments because of a dispute in respect of the agreement
of 1 December 1997.  
  
In the meantime, on 8 March 1998, the contract was awarded by the respondents
to the appellants. The link between the appellants and the respondents was in
the person of Chwee, who besides being a 5% shareholder in the respondents,
was also a majority shareholder and director of the appellants.  
  
In October 1998, the Chng group and the Ho group decided to settle their
dispute. It was agreed that firstly, SIR would proceed with the purchase of
the shares of the Chng`s group in the respondents at a reduced price.
Secondly, the Chng group would purchase certain units in the project from the
respondents for which they would pay 50% of the price up front. Payment for
30% of the sale price was effected. But a cheque for $9.46m, being for the
remaining 20%, issued by the Chng group to the respondents, was dishonoured
due to a lack of funds. The Chng group then assured the Ho group that funds
would be available subsequently. The respondents alleged that as a result
thereof, there was an agreement that the appellants would not insist on
payment under the interim certificates until the Chng group had paid the
$9.46m due to the respondents. In return, the respondents would not sue on the
dishonoured cheque. The appellants, however, denied that they had agreed not
to receive payment under the interim certificates until the Chng group had
paid the $9.46m to the respondents. I shall hereinafter refer to this point as
`the collateral agreement question`.  
  
As regards the $2m allegedly paid to Chwee, $1m was allegedly paid to him by
one Darwin Liman, an Indonesian businessman (on behalf of Ho Kok Cheong, the
project manager of the respondents), in order to secure the discharge from
bankruptcy of Ho Kok Cheong under a scheme of arrangement. That object having
failed, Chwee did not return the money. However, Chwee said he had returned
the same. As for the other $1m, the respondents claimed that it was a deposit
for the sale of shares in the respondents by the Chng group to SIR. This
deposit was not yet returned to SIR and was under the control of Chwee as part
of the Chng group. The respondents claimed that there was an agreement that
the two sums of $1m in Chwee`s control would be used for the payment of the
sums owing from the respondents to the appellants under the interim
certificates for the project. Again, the appellants denied the existence of
this agreement. In any event, the appellants said the two sums, if any,
concerned Chwee in his personal capacity and did not concern the appellants.
This point involving the two sums will be hereinafter referred to as the `$2m
question`.  
  
**_Notices to terminate_**

****

On 11 February 1999, the appellants sent a letter to the respondents giving
them notice under cl 33(1)(b) of the SIA Conditions on the ground that the
respondents had defaulted in making progress payments as certified by the
architect. Clause 33(1)(b) provides:

> _
>
> (1) The Contractor shall be entitled by a written Notice of Termination
> given to the Employer to terminate his employment under the Contract on any
> of the following grounds:
>
> ...
>
> (b) If the Employer does not pay the Contractor the amount due on any
> certificates within the Period for Honouring Certificates named in the
> Appendix hereto (unless and to the extent that under the terms of the
> Contract the Certificate has been superseded or corrected by a later
> Certificate or the Employer may be expressly empowered either not to pay, or
> to make deductions from, the sums shown as due in the certificate) and if
> such default is continued for 14 days after receipt by registered post or
> recorded delivery of a prior written notice from the Contractor stating
> that, failing payment within such further period of 14 days, Notice of
> Termination will be given under this Condition.
>
> _

  
  
However, just two days later, and without waiting for the 14-day grace period
laid down in cl 33(1)(b) to expire, by a letter dated 13 February 1999, the
appellants, referring to the letter of 11 February 1999 and invoking cl
33(1)(b), gave the respondents the notice of termination of the contract.  
  
On 22 February 1999, both parties held a meeting and agreed on a `mutual
termination` of the contract. Under the termination agreement, the architect
and quantity surveyor would measure and certify the value of work done up to
22 February 1999 and the value of materials on site. The respondents would
then pay the appellants such certified sum plus the outstanding sums under the
interim certificates by 31 March 1999 and the appellants would vacate the site
on that date.  
  
On 24 February 1999, the respondents wrote to the appellants pointing out that
the notice of termination of 13 February 1999 was invalid. But they went on to
point out that the matter had been superseded by the termination agreement of
22 February 1999.  
  
However, disputes soon surfaced when the appellants claimed for loss of
additional profit `due to further fall in material since award of contract.`
Quite inexplicably, the parties also started to argue if the termination
notice of 13 February 1999 was valid. As a result, the appellants continued to
remain on the site after 31 March 1999 and what amount was due from the
respondents to the appellants could not be resolved. On 8 April 1999, the
respondents rescinded the termination agreement and reserved their right to
claim damages. The respondents also gave the appellants notice to vacate the
site by 15 April 1999. The appellants did not comply with the respondents`
notice to vacate. By their letter dated 22 April 1999, the respondents
accepted the appellants` repudiation of the contract and reserved their right
to claim damages. Eventually, the respondents recovered possession of the site
by way of OS 627/99.  
  
**_The litigation_**

****

On 21 April 1999, the respondents gave notice of arbitration to the
appellants` solicitors pursuant to cl 37(1) of the SIA Conditions. On 3 May
1999, the appellants took out the writ of summons in Suit 658/99. On 19 May
1999, the respondents took out SIC 3257/99 to stay the proceedings pursuant to
s 7 of the Act. On 28 May 1999, the appellants took out SIC 3480/99 for
summary judgment on its claim. Both SIC applications were fixed for hearing
before the learned Judicial Commissioner Lee Seiu Kin (the judge) on 21 June
1999.  
  
**_The decision below_**

****

The learned judge below ordered that all proceedings in Suit 658/99 be stayed
pending arbitration. In view of his order staying the proceedings, he did not
make an order on the appellants` application for summary judgment.  
  
The grounds on which the judge allowed the respondents` application for a stay
of proceedings were as follows:

(a) in view of the complex inter-relationships between the parties, there were
triable issues in respect of the alleged $2m question and the collateral
agreement question;

(b) such triable issues would have entitled the respondents to unconditional
leave to defend in the appellants` application for summary judgment;

(c) the triable issues were matters arising `in connection with` the contract
pursuant to cl 37(1) and therefore, those issues fell within the reference to
arbitration;

(d) the respondents had satisfied s 7(1) of the Act in that a dispute between
the parties had been validly referred to arbitration and the issue was one
which was within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator; and

(e) the appellants had failed to show that, under s 7(2) of the Act, there was
a sufficient reason for not referring the matter to arbitration.  
  
**_The appeal_**

****

The appellants put forward three main grounds of appeal, namely:

(i) that the judge below had adopted an incorrect approach by first
determining that there were triable issues raised in this case; instead, he
should have proceeded on the assumption that there were triable issues raised
by the affidavits;

(ii) that the triable issues as found by the judge were wholly extraneous to
the contract and thus did not come within cl 37(1) and no question of any stay
arose;

(iii) that the appellants` right to payment under the interim certificates was
not a triable issue as the law clearly allowed the appellants` claim under the
interim certificates.  
  
**_Whether the judge had adopted the correct approach_**

****

While the learned judge recognised that under cl 31(11), in the absence of
fraud or improper pressure or interference by either party, the court should
give full effect to the interim certificates, he ruled that as the respondents
had shown that there were triable issues, the appellants were not entitled to
summary judgment. Unconditional leave to defend should be given. He also held
that the triable issues raised by the respondents fell within the reference to
arbitration. Thus, he ordered a stay in accordance with s 7 of the Act.  
  
The appellants contended that the judge had misdirected himself and adopted
the wrong approach in first determining whether there were triable issues and
followed by determining whether those issues formed part of the reference to
arbitration. They submitted that the court should first have heard the
respondents` application for a stay of proceedings based on the assumption
that the questions to be determined in the suit were triable.  
  
We were unable to see how the judge could be considered to have erred in
taking the approach he did. It was the same approach taken by LP Thean J (as
he then was) in **Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd v Lojan Properties Pte Ltd**
[1989] SLR 610  [1989] 3 MLJ 216 , where after the writ was issued by the
plaintiffs, the defendants took out an application for stay pending
arbitration and at about the same time, the plaintiffs applied for summary
judgment. There, both applications were fixed to be heard together as in the
present case. The assistant registrar dismissed the plaintiffs` application
for summary judgment and allowed the defendants` application for stay. On
appeal, LP Thean J granted the plaintiffs` application for summary judgment in
part and stayed the balance of the plaintiffs` claim for arbitration. It was
clear from his judgment that the hearing of the application for summary
judgment was heard first followed by the application for stay. The same
approach also appears to have been taken by FA Chua J in the earlier case
**Woh Hup (Pte) Ltd & Anor v Turner (East Asia) Pte Ltd** [1986] SLR 152
[1987] 1 MLJ 443 .  
  
In any event, we were unable to appreciate what real difference it made to the
stay application whether the judge first determined there were triable issues
or assumed there were triable issues. Whichever approach could not have
altered the determination of the stay application. If there were no triable
issues, then there would be no dispute which required reference to
arbitration. There would be no question of a stay. A stay would only come into
question whenever there were triable issues or disputes within the meaning of
cl 37(1), necessitating a reference to arbitration.  
  
**_Whether the triable issues raised fell within cl 37(1)_**

****

Clause 37(1) of the SIA Conditions states:

> _Any dispute between the Employer and the Contractor as to any matter
> arising under or out of or in connection with this Contract or under or out
> of or in connection with the carrying out of the Works and whether in
> contract, or tort, or as to any direction or instruction or certificate of
> the Architect or as to the contents of or granting or refusal of or reasons
> for any such direction, instruction or certificate shall be referred to the
> arbitration and final decision of a person to be agreed by the parties..._

  
  
Section 7(1) of the Act provides:

> _If any party to an arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through or
> under him, commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the
> arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through or under him, in
> respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to the legal
> proceedings may at any time after appearance, and before delivering any
> pleadings or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to the court
> to stay the proceedings._

  
  
The judge below found that the appellants` purported termination of the
contract on 13 February 1999 under cl 33(1)(b) of the SIA Conditions arose out
of the respondents` failure to pay on the interim certificates. Whether the
appellants were entitled to invoke cl 33(1)(b) would depend on whether the
respondents were justified in not paying the appellants on those interim
certificates. The judge therefore found that the two issues, namely, the $2m
question and the collateral agreement question, would be matters arising `in
connection with` the contract which had been referred to arbitration.  
  
However, the appellants contended that the issues found by the judge to be
triable dealt with alleged transactions and agreements to which the appellants
were not a party and that the agreements were completely unrelated to the
obligations of the parties under the contract. The appellants also pointed out
that the respondents had not disputed any of the sums due and owing under the
interim certificates or that the work done by the appellants was completed to
the contractual standard. The appellants` entitlement to the sums owing under
the interim certificates was therefore only disputed by the respondents on
extraneous grounds arising outside the contract and the issues did not fall
within the ambit of cl 37(1) and thus, s 7(1) of the Act would not apply.  
  
The appellants further contended that under the SIA Conditions, any sum
certified by the architect on an interim certificate constituted a debt due
and payable by the employer to the contractor. The contractor`s right to such
payment was subject only to any deduction or set-off as provided expressly in
the contract and any counterclaim the employer might have against the
contractor had to be separately litigated. Under cl 31(1) and the Appendix of
the SIA Conditions, the respondents were to pay the appellants the sum due
under an interim certificate within 21 days of receipt by the respondents of
the original interim certificate issued by the project architect and the tax
invoice from the appellants. Each interim certificate was given temporary
finality. This was the effect of cl 31(11) of the SIA Conditions which
provided:

> _No certificate of the Architect under this Contract shall be final and
> binding in any dispute between the Employer and the Contractor, whether
> before an arbitrator or in the Courts, save only that, in the absence of
> fraud or improper pressure or interference by either party, full effect by
> way of Summary Judgment or Interim Award or otherwise shall, in the absence
> of express provision, be given to all decisions and certificates of the
> Architect (other than a Cost of Termination Certificate or a Termination
> Delay Certificate under clause 32(8) of these Conditions), whether for
> payment or otherwise, until final judgment or award, as the case may be, and
> until such final judgment or award such decision or certificates shall (save
> as aforesaid and subject to sub-clause (4) of this condition) be binding on
> the Employer and the Contractor in relation to any matter which, under the
> terms of the Contract, the Architect has a fact taken into account or
> allowed or disallowed, or any disputed matter upon which under the terms of
> the Contract he has as a fact ruled, in his certificates or otherwise ..._

  
  
The appellants also relied on letters written by the respondents to them to
show that the two alleged agreements were collateral and did not arise `in
connection with` the contract. The letter from the respondents` solicitors to
the appellants` solicitors dated 21 April 1999 stated:

> _..._

> _We are further instructed that disputes have now arisen between our
> respective clients, arising from your clients` purported termination of
> their employment under your clients` notice of termination dated 13 February
> 1999, which termination our clients maintain was unlawful and in breach of
> cl 33(1)(b) of the conditions of contract._

> _Pursuant to cl 37(1) of the Conditions of Contract, we are instructed by
> our clients to give your clients notice to refer the said dispute to
> arbitration._

> _..._

  
  
The appellants pointed out that from this letter, it was clear that the
respondents envisaged only disputes arising from the termination of the
contract being referred for arbitration and not such triable issues in respect
of the alleged agreements as identified by the judge below. Moreover, in the
minutes of the meeting of 22 February 1999 at which the parties agreed on the
`mutual termination` of the contract, there was no mention of any agreement
that the appellants would not insist on payment under the interim certificates
until the respondents had received payment of the $9.46m.  
  
Furthermore, in a letter dated 22 March 1999 from the respondents to the
appellants, it was stated:

> _..._

> _As mentioned earlier, we cannot agree that your termination of the contract
> was made under cl 33(1)(b). As such there is no basis for your claim for
> additional profits._

> _..._

> _Quite apart from the above, you are also aware that your related company,
> M/s How Hwa Investment Pte Ltd has issued a cheque of $9,460,000 dated 23
> October 1998 to us which was dishonoured upon presentation..._

  
  
The appellants placed particular reliance on the words `Quite apart from the
above` to submit that the respondents themselves treated the alleged agreement
as a collateral matter apart from the contract itself. Thus, such a collateral
matter could not be a matter `arising under or out of or in connection with`
the contract.  
  
It is trite law that the answer to the question whether a dispute falls within
an arbitration clause in a contract must depend on firstly, what the dispute
is and secondly, what disputes the arbitration clause covers: **Heyman v
Darwins Ltd** [1942] AC 356 at 360 per Viscount Simon LC. In the present case,
it was clear that in order to come within cl 37(1) the issues in dispute must
have arisen under or out of or be reasonably connected with the contract
between the parties: **Coop International Pte Ltd v Ebel SA** [1998] 3 SLR 670
at 681.  
  
In the light of the appellants` arguments, we agreed that the $2m question and
the collateral agreement question were matters collateral to the contract
itself. While it is true that both the questions could affect the appellants`
right to payment under the interim certificates, they were really separate
issues and not `matters arising under or out of or in connection with the
contract`. They were truly matters outside the contract. To this extent, we
were unable to agree with the judge below.  
  
**_Whether the respondents could rely on cll 32(10) and 32(8)(a) to withhold
payment on the interim certificates_**

****

However, this did not conclude the matter. There was another issue which
related to the termination of the contract and the question that arose from
that was whether the respondents could rely on cl 32(10) of the SIA Conditions
to withhold making payment on the interim certificates. It would be recalled
that on 11 February 1999, the appellants gave the respondents a notice under
cl 33(1)(b) and just two days later, on 13 February 1999, they gave the
respondents the notice of termination under cl 33(1)(b). The respondents
disputed the validity of the appellants` termination of the contract under cl
33(1)(b) on two bases. First, the appellants were not entitled to give their
notice of 11 February 1999 as the respondents were justified in not paying the
appellants under the interim certificates in view of the two alleged
agreements. Second, and more importantly, the notice of termination was
invalid as the appellants did not allow 14 days to elapse following the first
notice of 11 February 1999.  
  
As the appellants had persisted in their stand that they had validly given the
notice to terminate, the respondents had, on 22 April 1999, written to the
appellants, accepting the appellants` repudiation of the contract and
rescinding the same. The respondents contended that upon electing to treat the
contract as repudiated by the appellants, they did not have to pay the
appellants on the interim certificates. For this contention, they relied on
cll 32(10) and 32(8)(a) of the SIA Conditions, which read:  
  

32(10) | In the event of the Employer being entitled and selecting to treat the Contract as repudiated by the Contractor under the general law and deciding to complete the Works by other contractors, the powers, remedies and damages conferred by sub-clause (8) of this Condition shall be exercisable and recoverable by the Employer in the same way as if a valid Notice of Termination had been given.  
---|---  
32(8)(a) | No further sum shall be certified as due to the Contractor until the issue by the Architect of the Completion Cost Certificate hereinafter mentioned in this sub-clause nor shall the Employer be bound to pay any sums previously certified if not already paid.  
  
  
  
The respondents contended that besides the aforesaid two questions ([para ] 7
and 8 above), other triable issues were: (i) whether the appellants had
wrongfully terminated the contract under cl 33(1)(b) and (ii) whether as a
result, the respondents were entitled to treat the contract as repudiated by
the appellants and rely on cll 32(10) and 32(8)(a) to withhold payment on the
interim certificates. Such issues would clearly fall within cl 37(1) and
should be referred to arbitration. We agreed with this submission.  
  
It is true that under cl 31(11), as construed in **Tropicon Contractors Pte
Ltd v Lojan Properties Pte Ltd** [1989] SLR 610  [1989] 3 MLJ 216 , the
existence of a cross-claim by the employer is no ground to refuse payment on
an interim certificate. As stated by Warren LH Khoo J in **Aoki Corp v
Lippoland (Singapore) Pte Ltd** [1995] 2 SLR 609  at 619:

> _... Progress payments are the lifeline of a building contractor`s business.
> The object of giving interim certificates temporary finality is to enable
> the contractor to be paid during the progress of the works so as to minimize
> cash flow problems._

  
  
However, the position here was different. While cl 31(11) provided that
summary judgment could be obtained on the basis of an interim certificate, it
was subject to the exception `in the absence of express provision`. Clause
32(8)(a) appeared to be one such `express provision`. Furthermore, the
rationale for giving temporary finality to an interim certificate could no
longer hold good when the contract had come to an end. The contractor would
not be carrying out any more work. So the need to minimize `cash flow
problems` for the project no longer existed.  
  
The appellants also argued that the words `any sums previously certified if
not already paid` in cl 32(8)(a) should mean only sums which were already
certified but not yet due from the employer and should not include sums which
had already fallen due because the period for honouring the interim
certificates had expired. If this argument were correct, it would mean that
under cl 32(8)(a), the employer would in effect be able to withhold payment on
only one interim certificate at any one time. We could not accept this
argument. First, the wording of cl 32(8)(a) is clear. The contention of the
appellants would require us to read words into it. Second, if an employer
should withhold payment which had fallen due under any interim certificates,
and if such withholding was wrongful, it would be open to the contractor to
pursue his remedy by summary judgment or other means. In this instance, no
steps had been taken by the appellants to enforce payment until now. As we saw
it, once cll 32(10) and 32(8)(a) were set in motion, quite clearly, these
provisions should be given effect to.  
  
**_Whether stay should be granted_**

****

Section 7(2) of the Act provides:

> _The court or a judge thereof, if satisfied that there is not sufficient
> reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the
> arbitration agreement, and that the applicant was, at the time when the
> proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all
> things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, may make an order
> staying the proceedings._

  
  
It is settled law that once a dispute falls within an arbitration clause and
is being referred to arbitration, the burden is on the party resisting a stay
to show that there is a sufficient reason for not referring the matter in
dispute to arbitration. In this instance, no reasons, other than those points
discussed above and which we did not accept, had been advanced by the
appellants to show why the parties` choice of forum should not be given effect
to. Accordingly, we held that there ought to be a stay.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

In the premises, the appeal was dismissed with costs and theusual
consequential orders.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
