**Judgment**

_GROUNDS OF DECISION_

_**

Introductory **_

1 In a writ filed in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore, the
plaintiff Datuk Captain Hamzah Bin Mohd Noor, apparently a much-decorated
businessman, resident in Malaysia, claims against Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni
Sultan Iskander Al-Haj, the Crown Prince of Johor, Malaysia, a sum well in
excess of US$8 million allegedly for services rendered, loans and advances
made and amounts expended by the plaintiff for and at the request of the
defendant. From the statement of claim filed, it would appear that whatever
agreements reached between the plaintiff and the defendant were all verbal.

2 The defendant after entering appearance in this suit applied to the court to
stay proceedings on grounds of _forum non conveniens_. This contention by him
was that the appropriate forum to try the plaintiffs claim was either Malaysia
or Indonesia and never Singapore. The defendant prevailed before the learned
assistant registrar. The plaintiffs appeal and further arguments before me
were not successful for the reasons which follow.

_**Tour dhorizon**_

3 Before I set out the reasons for my decision, it would, perhaps be useful to
state briefly the background facts as can be gathered from the plaintiffs
statement of claim and from the affidavits filed by parties in these
proceedings.

4 The plaintiff is a former Harbour Master in the State of Johor. He got along
famously with the Johor Royal Household, at least until recently. His services
and friendship did not go unnoticed and due recognition was given to him when
he was conferred Johors third highest honour award of _Setia Makhota Johor_ by
His Royal Highness the Sultan of Johor on his birthday honour lists in 1984.
When the Sultan of Johor became the King of Malaysia, ("_the Yang Dipertuan
Agung_ "), the plaintiff was further honoured in 1987 by the King with
Malaysias First Class Honour Award of _Panglima Setia Diraja_ , an award which
entitled him to the title _Datuk_. He states his residential address as 2A
Jalan SS3/2, Taman Sentosa, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia.

5 The defendant is the eldest son of the Sultan of Johor and bears the royal
title _Tunku Mahkota Johor_ or _TMJ_. He is next in line and the heir to the
throne of the State of Johor. He resides in a palace in Johor Bahru, Malaysia,
known as the Istana Pasir Pelangi.

6 In the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant, besides
being a prince, is also a businessman and an investor in various commercial
ventures for gain and profit. He claims that he was the defendants personally
appointed and acknowledged representative in a number of commercial projects,
ventures and investments in return for remuneration and payment of expenses to
him. Quite a few projects were listed by him in this regard, chief amongst
them was an oil and gas project in Indonesia which he calls the Petrogas
Project. More shall be heard on this later.

7 The plaintiffs statement of claim is an extremely long and rambling 119-page
(408 paragraphs) document. He sets out in it rather laboriously the various
services rendered by him to the defendant from about September 1994; the
promises made by the defendant and the sums disbursed by him for and at the
request of the defendant. The breakdown of the plaintiffs claim is as follows:

> 1\. The sum of US$805,000.00 being the salary or remuneration due from the
> Defendant to the Plaintiff for work done and services rendered by the
> Plaintiff to the Defendant pursuant to the contract for service between the
> Plaintiff and the Defendant at the rate of US$35,000.00 per month for 23
> months from September 1994 to July 1996;
>
> 2\. The sum of RM450,000.00 being the balance allowances due from the
> Defendant to the Plaintiff as agreed to by the Defendant and incorporated
> into the contract for service at the rate of RM10,000.00 per month for 45
> months from January 1996 to September 1999;
>
> 3\. The sum of US$5,000,000.00 being the lump sum money due from the
> Defendant to the Plaintiff as agreed to by the Defendant and incorporated
> into thecontract for service;
>
> 4\. The sum of US$1,000,000.00 being the lump sum money due from the
> Defendant to the Plaintiff as agreed by the Defendant and incorporated into
> the contract for service;
>
> 5\. The sum of US$900,000.00 being the additional lump sum money due from
> the Defendant to the Plaintiff as agreed to by the Defendant and
> incorporated into the contract for service;
>
> 6\. The sum of RM832,542.16 and the sum of US$140,966.00 being monies
> advanced by the Plaintiff on the Defendants behalf and on the Defendants
> instructions pertaining to the Petrogas Project and the Defendants various
> other matters and investments;
>
> 7\. The sum of RM8,905.00 being the reimbursable expenses incurred by the
> Plaintiff in the performance of his duties for the Defendant with the
> Defendants authority and permission;
>
> 8\. The sum of US$200,000.00 extended by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as a
> personal loan on or about 5 April 1995;
>
> 9\. The sum of US$220,000.00 extended by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as a
> personal loan on 16 June 1995;

8 The total amount of the claim is for US$8,300,966 and M$1,301,447.16.

9 The pleaded facts and the affidavits filed by the parties suggest that some
time in November 1994, the plaintiff introduced the Petrogas Project to the
defendant at the latters office at Mados Sdn Bhd, situated at Jalan Pasir
Pelangi, Johor Bahru and subsequently arranged for the defendant to meet one
Praptono Tjitrohupojo (Praptono), an Indonesian national, who is the president
director and majority shareholder of an Indonesian corporation known as PT
Usaha Putra Indonesia Petrogas (UPG). The upshot was UPG was given four
technical assistance contracts (TAC) to explore, develop, produce and sell the
oil and gas from four different oil and gas concessions in Indonesia which
collectively constituted the Petrogas Project and in this regard the defendant
agreed to and caused to be provided loans amounting to US$26.5 million to the
subsidiaries of UPG. In all this, the plaintiff claims that he acted as the
defendants representative. The plaintiff further claims that a considerable
amount of work was done by him for the defendant in relation to the defendants
intended participation and subsequent involvement in the ventures mentioned.

10 The plaintiff maintains that he actively participated in and attended
several meetings relating to the defendants affairs including one held in the
meeting room of the Raffles Marina Singapore, on 27 November 1994, for the
finalisation of negotiations between the defendant and UPG, which culminated
in the execution of the first of the four loan agreements. The details
provided by the plaintiff in his statement of claim as to works carried out by
him allegedly for and on behalf of the defendant and the personages he met are
too long to be entered upon here. Suffice it, if it is said he made a number
of trips to Singapore for meetings in connection with his purported brief. He
claims that the defendant almost entirely depended on the team comprising the
plaintiff, one of the defendants then legal advisors, Mr Andre Arul (who is
curiously the current counsel for the plaintiff) and a few others to oversee
the legal, economic and financial aspects of the transaction.

11 The plaintiff also recounts in his statement of claim the pivotal role he
played in the negotiations leading up to the finalization of the four loan
agreements mentioned. He sets out in detail the negotiations he conducted, all
of them on behalf of and upon the instructions of the defendant, with various
overseas financial institutions, advisers and investors including Prince Jefri
of Brunei who in the result provided funds totalling US$45 million in two
tranches for the Petrogas Project. He mentioned that he also had to represent
the defendant in negotiations with a number of energy corporations in many
countries and arranged to incorporate five offshore companies in the British
Virgin Islands, collectively known as "Crown BVI" and two other companies in
Malaysia, known as Crown Energy Holding Sdn Bhd (Crown Malaysia) and Luxury
Marketing Sdn Bhd (LMSB) to safeguard the defendants interests in Petrogas
Project as well as others. In addition, the plaintiff also met people at the
highest levels of government and industry in Malaysia as well as in Indonesia.
Prominent personalities he had met in this regard included Dato Seri Anwar,
the former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia as well as General Try Sutrisno,
the then Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia.

12 As a result of Prince Jefri not willing to pour in further funds, (the
expected inflow was US$230 million), the Petrogas Project reportedly
floundered. On 31 July 1995, the defendant caused to be assigned to Crown
Malaysia all of the defendants debt of US$26.5 million from UPG and all his
rights, powers, privileges, options and obligations under each of the four
loan agreements executed between the defendant, UPG and Praptono. Following
the collapse of the Petrogas Project, since about 31 July 1995, the plaintiff,
on behalf of the defendant, had been seeking the return of the loans extended
to the Petrogas group of companies in the sum of US$26.5 million plus interest
in accordance with the terms of the respective loan agreements made between
the defendant, UPG and Praptono. However, as of 5 October 1999, the plaintiff
ceased to act any further on behalf of the defendant owing to the defendants
failure to pay any of the plaintiffs salary, the balance of his allowance,
reimbursement of his costs and expenses incurred on the defendants behalf, the
plaintiffs personal loans to the defendant and other monetary commitments made
by the defendant to him.

13 The plaintiff also sketches out in the statement of claim some other
services rendered by him to the defendant in connection with the defendants
various projects and undertakings. These include matters relating to some
twenty-seven parcels of land belonging to the defendant and hosts of other
projects which require no further amplification at this stage.

14 As could be observed from the final segment of the plaintiffs statement of
claim (pages 117 and 118), his claims appear to comprise, in the main, nine
items besides his consequential claims for damages, costs and interests.

15 As regards the first claim for US$805,000 allegedly for salary or
remuneration at the rate of US$35,000 a month from September 1994 to July
1996, the plaintiff alleges at 271 of the statement of claim that on or about
10 December 1994, the defendant met the plaintiff and Praptono at the "_The
Last Chukka_ ", (which according to counsel is situated at Istana Pasir
Pelangi, Johor Bahru) and confirmed that he would be paid a monthly salary of
US$35,000 a month by the defendant personally. As regards the second claim for
M$450,000 the plaintiff states at para 342 of the statement of claim that on 2
June 1995, during a car ride from the Seletar Airport to Istana Pasir Plangi,
Johor Bahru, the defendant told the plaintiff that the latter would be paid a
monthly allowance to meet his outgoings and expenses incurred in Malaysia in
relation to the Petrogas Project and this was further confirmed when the
defendant later arrived at Istana Pasir Pelangi where he instructed one Ungku
Yusoff in this regard.

16 As concerns the third claim for a lump sum payment for US$5,000000, the
plaintiff says at para 346 of the statement of claim that the defendant also
during the same car ride on 2 June 1995, from Seletar to Johor Bahru mentioned
in the preceding para, said that he would pay the plaintiff an additional sum
of US$5,000,000 for his efforts in relation to the Petrogas Project. In
respect of the fourth claim for a further lumpsum of US$1,000,000, the
plaintiff avers at paras 349 and 350 of the statement of claim that this sum
was promised to him in recognition of the plaintiffs efforts concerning the
Petrogas Project. This promise, he says, was made to him by the defendant in
the latters office at Johor Bahru in the presence of one Mr Salleh and one of
the defendants personal secretaries, Ms Halimah binti Ahmad.

17 As regards his fifth claim for a sum of US$900,000, the plaintiff mentions
in para 352 of the statement of claim that on 28 April 1995, the defendant
also verbally promised to pay him an additional sum of US$900,000 since the
defendant had fallen behind in his contractual payments to the plaintiff.
Dealing with his sixth claim for two sums of M$832,542.16 and US$140,966.00,
being monies allegedly advanced by the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant
upon the latters instructions in connection with the Petrogas Project, the
plaintiff itemizes them in paras 358 to 376 of the statement of claim. With
regard to his seventh claim for a sum of M$8,905.00, the plaintiff mentions in
para 378 of the statement of claim, that this was an outstanding sum payable
for some air tickets, bought in the performance of his duties for the
defendant. As respects his eighth claim for US$200,000 the plaintiff states at
paragraphs 387 to 389 of the statement of claim that this was a personal loan
extended by him to the defendant at the latters Mados office in Johor Bahru
and the whole sum in cash was handed at that office to one Ms Tan who received
the said sum on behalf of the defendant.

18 The ninth claim by him is for US$220,000. In this regard, the plaintiff in
paras 397 to 407 of his statement of claim states that he paid this sum to UPG
in Jakarta upon the express request of the defendant and the defendant has
failed so far to return the said sum to him.

19 As regards evidence to be adduced in relation to the current dispute, the
plaintiff does not seem to agree with the list of potential witnesses provided
by the defendant in para 18 of his affidavit where the defendant has named
altogether 11 witnesses: 6 Malaysian residents (excluding himself and the
plaintiff), 3 Indonesian residents, one Singapore resident and one from
Scotland. The plaintiff for his part adds another 28 to his list: (excluding
himself and defendant, both of them from Malaysia), three from Brunei
Darussalam, four from Canada, one from New Zealand, eleven from Singapore,
eight from the US and one from UK.

_**

Defendants application

**_

20 The defendants application to court is based on para 9 of the First
Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) which reads:

> **Stay of proceedings**
>
> 9\. Power to dismiss or stay proceedings where the matter in question is res
> judicata between the parties, or where by reason of multiplicity of
> proceedings in any court or courts or by reason of a court in Singapore not
> being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought not to be continued.

21 The submission by the defendant that given the entire spectrum, background
and character of the dealings between the contestants, Singapore is not the
appropriate forum to litigate the dispute at hand. This argument was accepted
as valid by the learned assistant registrar. In the appeal before me, counsel
for the plaintiff endeavoured to persuade me that on the basis of the evidence
placed before the court by the plaintiff, Singapore is the natural and the
most appropriate forum for the present action to be tried. A synopsis of his
arguments is as follows:

> (a) **Witnesses:** The main witnesses for the present proceedings are the
> plaintiff, the defendant, Salleh and Praptono (the first three being
> Malaysian residents and the last being an Indonesian resident). Other
> witnesses are reluctant to testify in Malaysia but are willing to testify in
> Singapore (para 41 of appellants submission).
>
> (b) **Events:** The major events pertaining to the plaintiffs claim did not
> occur only in Malaysia but in Singapore as well. Main bulk of the plaintiffs
> claim against the defendant is for the sum of US$5,000,000 which the
> defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff during a car ride between Seletar
> airport to Istana Pasir Pelangi in Johor (paras 43 and 44 of the
> submission).
>
> (c) **Governing law of the loan agreements:** Several of the drafts of the
> Master Agreements stipulated that the law of England to be the governing law
> for the same. The arbitration clauses too provided for the UNICTRAL Rules in
> Singapore to apply (paras 45 and 46 of the submission).
>
> (d) **Assets of parties: The defendant has not provided any details to
> support his contention that he has substantial assets in Malaysia**. On the
> contrary, the plaintiff has evidence that the defendants have substantial
> assets in Singapore (para 49 of the submission).
>
> (e) **Excessive delay in Malaysia:** There is a huge backlog of cases in the
> Malaysian Courts and there is likely to be an inordinate delay in the
> prosecution of the plaintiffs claim (para 59 of the submission).
>
> (f) **The defendants privileged position in Malaysia:** The defendant is the
> Crown Prince of Johor. He may ascend the Johor Throne before the conclusion
> of the trial and in the result he will be granted immunity against any
> proceedings in Malaysia (para 62 of the submission).

22 When asked to state where the agreement relating to the subject matter of
the claim was concluded, plaintiffs counsel invited the courts attention to
para 346 of the statement of claim which states that the promise by the
defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum under reference was made during a car
ride from the Singapore Seletar Airport to Istana Pasir Pelangi, Johor.
Plaintiffs counsel also confirmed that the plaintiffs various claims in the
statement of claim are founded on oral agreements and variations of the said
oral agreements between the plaintiff and the defendant. Interestingly,
counsel for the plaintiff conceded that there is in existence a draft
agreement (exh TMJ-7 in the affidavit of the defendant filed on 23 April 2000)
prepared in relation to this matter by him, which is signed by the plaintiff
but not by the defendant. I shall revert to this draft later in these grounds.

23 Counsel for the defendant in his submission underscored the aspect that
both the contestants featured in this case are Malaysian residents and the
other principal figure Praptono is an Indonesian. The draft agreement in
relation to the subject matter prepared by plaintiffs counsel, signed by the
plaintiff and forwarded to the defendant for execution but not signed by him,
clearly stipulates that the governing law of the agreement between the parties
is Malaysia and the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Malaysia (see cl 10 of the draft contract in the exh TMJ-7 referred to). To
dispel any doubt as to the course to be adopted by the defendant, his counsel
also reaffirmed his clients intention that he would submit to the jurisdiction
of the courts in Malaysia. Counsel further invited the attention of the court
to a significant feature that the four loan agreements which form the backdrop
to the plaintiffs claim and alleged agreement for services in relation to them
concern matters outside Singapore. After further highlighting the fact that
Praptono has also filed a claim against the defendant in Malaysia as respects
Pratponos purported claims against the defendant, he urged the court to rule
that Singapore is decidedly not the most appropriate forum to try the dispute
between that parties and suggested Malaysia as being the most appropriate
forum, if not Indonesia.

_**

Decision

**_

24 It would appear from the arguments presented before me that the plaintiffs
principal reason for choosing to proceed against the defendant in Singapore
and not Malaysia is due to his apprehension that the defendant may have an
overwhelming advantage over him in Malaysia by virtue of his princely status.
The other reason pressed before me was that the courts in Malaysia are unable
to dispose of the cases expeditiously as there is a substantial backlog of
cases there. The question that needs to be answered here is whether the
foregoing grievances justify this court in holding Singapore as the most
appropriate forum. The principles of law applicable in this regard are set out
by the House of Lords in England in _**Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd,
The Spiliada**_ [1986] 3 All ER 843.

25 In _**The Spiliada**_ the House of Lords was primarily concerned with
issues relating to the granting of leave under O 11 r 1(1) of the Rules of the
Supreme Court, 1970 to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction. All the
same, the Law Lords held in that case that the principles governing the
granting of such leave were the same as those applicable to a stay of English
proceedings. Lord Goff of Chievely who delivered the main speech, restated the
law on this matter which is succinctly encapsulated in the third cumulative
supplement to _**Dicey & Morris on Conflict of Laws**_ (11th Ed) at paras
393-395 as follows:

> _**
>
> **_(a) the basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground
> of forum non conveniens where the court is satisfied that there is some
> other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the
> appropriate forum for the trial of the action, ie in which the case may be
> tried more suitably for the interest of all the parties and the ends of
> justice;
>
> (b) the legal burden of proof is on the defendant, but the evidential burden
> will rest on the party who asserts the existence of a relevant factor;
>
> (c) the burden is on the defendant to show both that England is not the
> natural or appropriate forum, and also that there is another available forum
> which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the English forum;
>
> (d) the court will look to see what factors there are which point to the
> direction of another forum, as being the forum with which the action has the
> most real and substantial connection, eg factors affecting convenience or
> expense (such as availability of witnesses), the law governing the
> transaction, and the places where the parties reside or carry on business;
>
> (e) if at that stage the court concludes that there is no other available
> forum which is clearly more appropriate it will ordinarily refuse a stay;
>
> (f) if there is another forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate
> the court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by
> reason of which justice requires that a stay should not be granted, and, in
> this inquiry the court will consider all the circumstances of the case. But
> the mere fact that the plaintiff has a legitimate, personal or juridical
> advantage in proceeding in England is not decisive; regard must be had to
> the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice._****_

26 The principles stated in _**The**_ _**Spiliada**_ have been approved and
consistently applied in our jurisdiction (see _**Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling
Corp & Anor v PT Airfast Services Indonesia and another appeal**_ [1992] 2 SLR
776 and _**Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd**_ [1998] 1 SLR
253).

27 In _**Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd**_ (_supra_) it
was held:

> The principles governing an application to stay proceedings were clear and
> established. If a court concluded that there was some other available forum
> which prima facie was clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action,
> it would ordinarily grant a stay unless there were circumstances by reason
> of which justice required that a stay should nevertheless not be granted.
> However, the mere fact that a plaintiff had such a legitimate advantage for
> proceeding in Singapore was not decisive and the interests of all the
> parties and the ends of justice had to be taken into consideration.

28 Earlier, in _**The Vishva Apurva**_ [1992] 2 SLR 175, the Singapore Court
of Appeal held that:

> In exercising its discretion, the court should take into account all the
> circumstances of the case, in particular, the country where the evidence is
> most readily available, whether the foreign law applies and whether it is
> different from the local law in any material aspects, which country the
> parties are connected with, and how closely whether the defendants genuinely
> desire trial in the foreign country or are only seeking procedural
> advantages, and whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue
> in the foreign court.

29 Reviewing all the learning referred to, it would appear that the focus of
all of the cases cited revolves around the following aspects:

> (a) the place where the underlying transaction and cause of action arose;
>
> (b) the location of the witnesses who would testify to the facts;
>
> (c) the residence of the parties to the action; and
>
> (d) the law governing the dispute.

30 As to where the transaction and the cause of action arose, the plaintiffs
claim is at its weakest. His claim that the alleged promise was made to him
during a car ride from the Singapore Seletar Airport to the defendants
Malaysian residence in Johor is far from conclusive. Although the plaintiff
did assert that the alleged agreement was made while they were still on
Singapore soil, I find it difficult to accept that two highly placed Malaysian
dignitaries on a car ride from Singapore to the palace of one of the
contestants would have even contemplated at that point in time that the
agreement, if any, between them will have the Singapore umbrella.
Probabilities do not favour the conclusion that they would have intended at
that stage to apply Singapore laws or to subject themselves to the
jurisdiction of Singapore courts.

31 As to the residential status of the parties to the action it has never been
in dispute that both the plaintiff and the defendant are Malaysian residents.
As to the law governing the dispute, the plaintiffs claim is that it has
always been the parties intention that the applicable law to any dispute
resolution would be that of Singapore. In this regard the plaintiff strives to
draw support from the reported perceptions and understandings of Praptono.
Paragraph 13 of Praptonos affidavit of 18 April 2001 relied on by plaintiffs
counsel in this respect reads as follows:

> I aver that at all times, it was contemplated between the Plaintiff, the
> Defendant and I that any disputes arising out of the Petrogas Project would
> be adjudged in Singapore and nowhere else. It was also my understanding that
> all further contractual matters, including as regards the arrangements
> between the Defendant and the Plaintiff herein, between the Defendant and
> Andre Arul and between the Defendant and Don were also to be resolved in
> Singapore other than any jurisdiction in precedence over Malaysia or
> Indonesia.

32 As regards the foregoing assertion, if what Praptono alleges were to be
true and accurate, why then in the draft agreement, (admittedly prepared in
1995 by the plaintiffs present counsel on the instructions of the plaintiff
and forwarded to the defendant for his signature by the plaintiff on 3 June
1998, that too having already been signed by the plaintiff) is there a clause
unequivocally stipulating that the agreement between the plaintiff and the
defendant _shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance
with the laws of Malaysia and the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of
the Courts of the States of Malaysia in all matters connected with the
obligations and liabilities of the parties under the agreement referred to_.
This document clearly belies the plaintiffs present stand and indeed weakens
the very foundation of the plaintiffs present endeavours. The damage control
attempted by his counsel by an explanation that this document was yet to be
signed, was found by me to be hopelessly inadequate.

33 The next aspect pursued by plaintiffs counsel was that (i) the plaintiff
stands in a rather vulnerable position in Malaysia, since the defendant by
virtue of his birth and being the Crown Prince of Johor could overwhelm the
plaintiff; (ii) the defendant might well ascend the throne of Johor in the
near future and in such an event the proceedings, if any instituted in
Malaysia, would have to be transferred to a special court under Malaysian
laws.

34 It may be hindsight but it is not unreasonable for one to suppose that a
well-connected and well-informed businessman of the plaintiffs ilk would not
have addressed himself to the pitfalls and disadvantages of hitching himself
with the royals before embarking on a substantial venture such as the one
under scrutiny. In my determination, the submission that the plaintiffs would
be overwhelmed in Malaysia, does not accord with the legal and legislative
frameworks in Malaysia where a citizen of Malaysia such as the plaintiff, can
indeed bring proceedings against the Rulers there (see _**Faridah Begum bte
Abdullah v Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al Mustain Billah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Abu
Bakar RiAyatuddin Al MuAdzam Shah**_[1996] 1 MLJ 617 at 622C-D). As to the
backlog of cases in the courts of Malaysia, this factor alone in my view
cannot justify my favouring Singapore as the most appropriate forum. In any
event, the intention of the parties from the outset as can be gathered from
the draft agreement adverted to, appears to be that Malaysia is the most
appropriate forum. The reason attempted by the plaintiff that many foreign
witnesses required for the trial favour Singapore to Malaysia is not
satisfactorily made out. In this regard, even Praptono himself appeared to
have elected to commence proceedings against the defendant in Malaysia,
although the significance of those proceedings was downplayed by his counsel
as no more than a protective writ.

35 Having reviewed the evidence available, I am of the view that a
conversation held during a brief car ride from Seletar to Johor is hardly
significant to justify the conclusion that the oral agreement referred to was
made in Singapore. On the other hand, the background facts pleaded by the
plaintiff warrant a conclusion to the contrary. In this regard para 15 of the
statement of claim points to the determination that whatever agreements
entered into had their source and origin at the office of the defendant in
Malaysia. As to the location of witnesses, here again as regards the services
rendered by the plaintiff and the alleged promises made by the defendant, the
core evidence is to be adduced by the principal contestants. They are both
resident and located in Malaysia. The others, if required in my view, will not
be too inconvenienced if the hearing is held in Singapore or Malaysia. The
reason offered by the plaintiff in para 21 of his affidavit filed on 20 March
2001 that it would be more convenient for the witnesses to travel to Singapore
is not sufficiently weighty enough to disqualify an otherwise appropriate
forum, which is Malaysia.

36 Having regard to all the evidence placed before me and considered all the
learning referred to during the hearing of the registrars appeal as well as
during further arguments, I was satisfied that Malaysia has the closest
connection to the issue at hand and is the most appropriate forum. In the
premises, I dismissed the plaintiffs appeal with costs and against my order
the plaintiff now appeals.
