High Court (Family Division) — Divorce (Transferred) No 3580 of 2017  
Tan Puay Boon JC  
9 May, 24 June 2019

19 December 2019 Judgment reserved.

Tan Puay Boon JC:

Introduction

1 This case involves a long 35-year marriage. The plaintiff wife (“the Wife”)
and the defendant husband (“the Husband”) were married on 24 January 1983, and
interim judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 13 February 2018. There are four adult
children to the marriage.

2 The Wife filed a writ for divorce on 2 August 2017. IJ was granted on an
uncontested basis, on the ground that the Husband had behaved in such a way
that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with him.

3 The matters that lie for determination are the division of matrimonial
assets, maintenance for the parties’ youngest child and the Wife, and costs.

Facts

4 The Husband and Wife are both 62 years old this year. The Wife has not been
working since 2014, and the Husband was previously a senior director with
business in China before he ceased employment in 2017. The Husband came out of
retirement from 2018 to 2019 to work on a contract basis in China, where he is
currently based. 1

Husband’s affidavit dated 4 March 2019 at Exhibit A of “SFD-1”, S/N 1.

5 There are four adult children to the marriage (“the Children”). The Children
were born in 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1998 and are 33, 31, 29 and 21 years old
this year respectively. The youngest Child is currently pursuing her tertiary
education overseas and is dependent on the parties for her expenses.

6 Both parties worked during the marriage. The Husband worked for a
multinational corporation and other businesses, and had to travel for business
on a regular basis. The Wife worked as a teacher in the early years, and then
at her family company, [A] Pte Ltd, from around 1992 to 2000. She resumed
employment in around 2008, before stopping work in 2013 after becoming ill.
She was in an administrative role from 2014 to 2015. 2

7 The Wife’s family companies are [A] Pte Ltd and [B] Pte Ltd. I will
collectively refer to them as her “family companies” where the distinction
between the two companies is not material.

8 The parties separated in around January 2017 after the Wife discovered
evidence of the Husband’s recent affair with the co-defendant in December
2016. 3

Division of matrimonial assets

9 I first consider the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets under s
112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”).

10 The parties accepted that the global assessment methodology should be used
to determine the appropriate division ratio of their matrimonial assets. 4

##### Foot Note 4

×

Notes of Evidence (“NE”) 8 February 2019 at p 1.

This methodology comprises four distinct phases: identification and pooling of
the matrimonial assets; assessment of the net value of the pool of assets;
determination of a just and equitable division of the assets; and
apportionment on the basis of the proportions of division: NK v NL [2007] 3
SLR(R) 743 at [31]. I consider each of these phases in turn.

Identification and assessment of the net value of the matrimonial assets

11 As a general position, all matrimonial assets and liabilities should be
identified as at the time of the IJ (“IJ date”), ie, 13 February 2018, and
valued as at the time of the ancillary matters hearing (“the AM date”), ie, 9
May 2019. The balances in the bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts
are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as these matrimonial assets are the
moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves.

12 For the other assets in general, the available values as close to the AM
date as possible will be used. Nevertheless, in this decision, I adopt the
values which the parties specifically agreed to use for the relevant assets or
liabilities, as reflected in the updated joint summary of relevant information
dated 3 June 2019 (marked as “JS2”).

13 At the outset, I observe that evidence was lacking in relation to the
matters disputed between the parties. This is only to be expected as this was
a long marriage; “parties to a functioning marriage do not keep records of
their transactions with a view to building a case should a divorce occur”: TXW
v TXX [2017] 4 SLR 799 at [46].

Matrimonial assets and liabilities that were agreed upon

14 The parties were mostly agreed on the identity and valuation of the
matrimonial assets and liabilities. The Husband appeared to accept at the
ancillary matters hearing (“AM hearing”) that the Wife’s shares in the family
companies were not matrimonial assets as they did not fall within the scope of
s 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Women’s Charter. 5

Notes of Evidence (“NE”) 9 May 2019 at p 1; NE 24 June 2019 at pp 8–9.

15 The parties have five real property assets between them. The Husband
accepted at the AM hearing that the GB Property in his name is a matrimonial
asset. The parties also agreed at the AM hearing that they would exclude two
hotel units in Malaysia in their respective names from the matrimonial pool. 6

##### Foot Note 6

NE 9 May 2019 at p 2; Wife’s submissions for ancillary matters dated 29 April
2019 (“WS”) at para 16.

The other two real properties are the Bukit Timah Property in their joint
names and the Robertson Quay Property in the name of the Wife, which the
parties accepted are matrimonial assets.

16 They parties agreed on the following currency exchange rates to be applied:

(a) RM1 to S$0.33;

(b) US$1 to S$1.34;

(c) CNY1 to S$0.20; and

(d) £1 to S$1.70.

17 I compute the net values of the Bukit Timah Property and the Robertson Quay
Property by deducting the agreed liabilities in relation to each property from
their agreed values. On this approach:

(a) The net value of the Bukit Timah Property is S$2,541,184.79 (being S$2.7m
– S$158,815.21). 7

##### Foot Note 7

JS2 at p 13; WS at para 12.

I will address the Wife’s submission that this net valuation should exclude
the outstanding mortgage under DBS Term Loan No -4707/2 at [21]–[23] below.

(b) The net value of the Robertson Quay Property, which is subject to a
mortgage loan of S$498,462.60 as at 31 March 2018 and an outstanding
S$900,00.00 loan from the Wife’s family, is S$2,101,537.40 (being S$3.5m –
S$1,398,462.60). 8

Disputed matrimonial liabilities

(1) The Husband’s personal liabilities

19 The Husband submitted that the following liabilities should be included in
the matrimonial pool: 10

##### Foot Note 10

×

JS2 at p 12, S/N 2–7.

(a) UOB Loan No -6312 and UOB Loan No -4302 (collectively “the UOB Loans”),
amounting to US$143,571.00 and US$158,283.00 respectively, and interest on the
UOB Loans;

(b) maintenance and utility fees for the Bukit Timah Property; and

(c) monthly expenses for the Husband, his mother and the youngest Child.

20 I do not include these liabilities as matrimonial liabilities. The Husband
did not substantiate when or for what purposes he entered into the UOB Loans
so as to show that they should be considered matrimonial liabilities that
should nominally be deducted from the matrimonial pool. The listed expenses
that were incurred after the IJ date also do not affect the value of
matrimonial pool, since the Husband’s bank account balances were identified as
at the IJ date.

(2) The DBS Term Loan No -4707/2

21 DBS Term Loan No -4707/2 is a mortgage loan that the Husband disbursed in
2010 against the Bukit Timah Property. It is the second mortgage loan taken in
relation to the Property; the first mortgage loan, DBS Housing Loan No
-4707/1, was disbursed in 1994. The parties agreed in JS2 that both mortgage
loans were joint matrimonial liabilities. The outstanding sums under the first
and second mortgage loans were S$95,534.77 and S$63,280.44 respectively as at
1 March 2019. 11

##### Foot Note 11

JS2 at p 13; Wife’s 3rd affidavit of assets and means dated 26 March 2019
(“Wife’s 3rd AAM”) at p 73.

22 However, the Wife submitted at the AM hearing that the second mortgage loan
was taken out for the Husband’s sole benefit and should be treated as his
personal liability. At the same time, she explained that the loan had been
used to purchase the Thomson Property in 2010. 12

##### Foot Note 12

×

NE 9 May 2019 at pp 8–9.

The Thomson Property was jointly owned by the parties and was sold in 2014 for
a profit of S$1,463,082.83 around 20 February 2014. The sale proceeds were
transferred to the parties’ joint bank account, but the Husband unilaterally
transferred S$1.25m of this sum to an account in his name in February and
March 2014. 13

##### Foot Note 13

WS at para 76; Wife’s 2nd affidavit of assets and means dated 22 February 2019
(“Wife’s 2nd AAM”) at p 79, Wife’s 3rd AAM at pp 94–96.

23 The Wife’s submissions in this regard were somewhat confused. What she
disputed appeared not to be the Husband’s taking out of DBS Term Loan No
-4707/2 in itself, which she accepted was used to buy matrimonial property in
the parties’ joint names. Rather, her concern seemed to be that the Husband
failed to account for S$1.25m of the sale proceeds of the Thomson Property. I
find, in the circumstances, that DBS Term Loan No -4707/2 is a matrimonial
liability and should be accounted for in the net valuation of the Bukit Timah
Property. I will deal with the Husband’s failure to account for the withdrawal
of S$1.25m from the parties’ joint account below at [34(c)] in determining if
an adverse inference should be drawn against him.

Assets disputed to be matrimonial assets

24 The Husband included several assets in JS2 that the Wife disputed were
matrimonial assets. I will consider his submissions that he contributed to the
Wife’s insurance polices 14

##### Foot Note 14

JS2 at p 15, S/N 3.

below when considering the parties’ direct contributions, and address the
other disputed assets in turn.

(1) Withdrawals from the Husband’s bank accounts

25 The Husband submitted at the AM hearing that the Wife made the following
withdrawals from his bank accounts: 15

##### Foot Note 15

×

NE 9 May 2019 at p 2; JS2 at pp 5, 7.

(a) S$8,000.00 from UOB Uniplus Savings Account No -9212 on 25 July 2017; and

(b) CNY400,000.00 (amounting to approximately S$80,000.00) from Bank of China
Account No --2742 in May 2017.

26 The Wife accepted that the S$8,000.00 which she withdrew (at [25(a)])
should be returned to the pool. However, she disputed the withdrawal at
[25(b)]. Although she acknowledged that she took between CNY300,000.00 to
CNY400,000.00 from the matrimonial home in 2016, that sum had not been
withdrawn from the Husband’s bank account and the Husband had not adduced any
supporting bank statements showing that the alleged withdrawal had been made.
16

##### Foot Note 16

×

NE 9 May 2019 at p 3; Wife’s 1st AAM at para 22.103.

In JS2 and his written submissions, the Husband elaborated that the Wife had
requested that he withdraw a sum of CNY400,000.00 from a Chinese bank account
to deposit into Bank of China Account No --2742, and that she withdrew the
CNY400,000.00 sum on 25 July 2017. 17

##### Foot Note 17

×

JS2 at p 15, S/N 2; Husband’s skeletal written submissions dated 29 April 2019
(“HWS”) at para 5.

27 I notionally add S$8,000.00 to the matrimonial pool to account for the
Wife’s withdrawal at [25(a)]. As for the withdrawal at [25(b)], I find that
the Husband was inconsistent about the date on which this sum was allegedly
withdrawn, and agree with the Wife that there was insufficient evidence to
show that a withdrawal of CNY400,000.00 was made. I therefore do not
notionally add the second alleged withdrawal to the matrimonial pool.

(2) Sale proceeds from the sale of the East Coast Property

28 The Husband stated that the Wife kept the net sale proceeds of S$660,000.00
from the 2001 sale of the East Coast Property, which the parties previously
owned. 18

##### Foot Note 18

×

JS2 at p 15, S/N 4; HWS at para 5.

However, his submissions do not appear to allege that she wrongfully
dissipated this sum. Indeed, he submitted at the AM hearing that the sum of
S$660,000.00 was used for the family’s expenses and to purchase the Robertson
Quay Property in 2007. 19

##### Foot Note 19

NE 9 May 2019 at p 10.

29 While the Wife disputed that the sum was used to purchase the Robertson
Quay Property, 20

##### Foot Note 20

×

NE 9 May 2019 at p 12.

I am satisfied that there has been no failure to account for these moneys on
her part, and that no sums have to be notionally added to the pool. I address
whether the sale proceeds were used to purchase the Robertson Quay Property at
[57] when considering the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions.

(3) Rental income from the Bukit Timah Property

30 The parties lived in the Bukit Timah Property from 1998 to 2001. In 2002,
the Wife and the Children moved into rental accommodation as she discovered
that the Husband had an affair. The Bukit Timah Property was rented out from
2004 onwards. 21

##### Foot Note 21

×

WS at p 16.

31 The Husband submitted that the 2004–2010 rental income for the Bukit Timah
Property (estimated at S$300,000.00) was deposited into the Wife’s personal
bank account. 22

##### Foot Note 22

×

JS2 at p 15, S/N 5; HWS at para 5.

She deposed that the rental income was used to pay for the household and
children’s expenses, and that the net rental income generated from 2007 to
2010 amounted to S$235,000.00. 23

##### Foot Note 23

×

Wife’s 1st AAM at para 22.79; Wife’s 3rd AAM at para 3.

32 Considering the fact that three of the children to the marriage would still
have been schooling during the period from 2004 to 2010, S$300,000.00 is a
reasonable sum to have been put towards the household expenses over the course
of seven years. I accept the Wife’s account that the sums would have been used
to meet the family’s living expenses, and do not add a notional sum
representing the rental income to the matrimonial pool.

Adverse inferences

33 The law on adverse inferences is well-established. The court must be
satisfied that: (a) there is a substratum of evidence which establishes a
prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn;
and (b) that person has some particular access to the information he is said
to be concealing or withholding: BPC v BPB and another appeal [2019] 1 SLR 608
(“BPC”) at [60]. Both sides submitted that an adverse inference should be
drawn against the other party. I address each party’s allegations in turn.

(1) Adverse inference against the Husband

34 The Wife submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against the
Husband in light of the following: 24

##### Foot Note 24

×

WS at paras 68–78.

(a) The Husband submitted his Singaporean income tax statements but failed to
provide equivalent documents for his employment in China. He was also
inconsistent as to whether his declared monthly income was S$21,000.00 or
S$16,000.00. 25

##### Foot Note 25

×

See Husband’s affidavit of assets and means dated 12 March 2018 at para
5(a)(i); Husband’s affidavit dated 4 March 2019 at Exhibit A of “SFD-1”, S/N
1.

(b) The Husband failed to make full disclosure of his assets. The Wife
referred to S$587,953.25 in undeclared assets, including the Husband’s
Singaporean insurance policies, Chinese bank accounts, and Chinese and US
investments. 26

##### Foot Note 26

×

See Wife’s 2nd AAM at paras 33–34.

(c) The Husband dissipated S$1.25m from the parties’ joint account: see above
at [22]–[23]. When asked to account for this sum, the Husband only stated that
the net sale proceeds of the Thomson Property were S$500,000.00 after
accounting for the moneys put towards repairing and upgrading the Property,
and that he invested these net proceeds. 27

##### Foot Note 27

×

Husband’s 3rd ancillary matters affidavit dated 26 March 2019 (“Husband’s 3rd
AM Affidavit”) at para 12.

35 In BPC, the Court of Appeal agreed that the High Court was justified in
drawing an adverse inference against the husband, being that his assets
exceeded what had been disclosed in the proceedings: at [63]. The husband
there had failed to provide, inter alia, the income tax documents for his
employment in China; other meaningful information on his income; surrender
values for his insurance policies; his CDP statements; and information about
his earnings: at [61]–[62].

36 In my view, the facts highlighted by the Wife justify the drawing of an
adverse inference against the Husband: 28

##### Foot Note 28

×

WS at paras 79–81.

(a) the Husband failed to provide meaningful substantiation of his income in
China, despite a request by the Wife that he provide details of his
employment;

(b) although the parties ultimately agreed on the amount to attribute to the
Husband for his various insurance policies and investment accounts, he did not
produce any supporting documents despite a court order requiring him to do so;
29

##### Foot Note 29

×

NE 24 June 2019 at p 6; Wife’s 2nd AAM at pp 88, 90; Husband’s 3rd AM
Affidavit at para 10.

and

(c) the Husband failed to properly account for the sale proceeds of the
Thomson Property.

37 The Husband argued that he did not have access to all the supporting
documentation needed as he has been working in China. I do not accept this
explanation. He would have no difficulty as the owner of the insurance
policies to get information on their surrender values, and likewise to obtain
information on his bank and investment accounts.

38 Accordingly, I find that these facts establish a prima facie case that the
Husband has failed to make full disclosure of his income and assets, and
relate to information that he would have particular access to. An adverse
inference should be drawn against him. I agree with the Wife that given the
difficulty of estimating the extent of his undisclosed income and assets, it
would be more appropriate to give effect to the adverse inference by adjusting
the ratio of division in the Wife’s favour. 30

##### Foot Note 30

×

WS at para 83.

I do so below at [68].

(2) Adverse inference against the Wife

39 The Husband submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against the
Wife for her failure to disclose: (a) the five gold bars in her possession;
and (b) dividends of S$400,000.00 that were issued to her from her family
companies in 2014 that were not reflected in her income tax statements. 31

##### Foot Note 31

×

NE 24 June 2019 at p 8.

40 First, dealing with the gold bars, it is unclear from the evidence when
they came into the Wife’s possession. The minutes of a meeting between the
Wife and her siblings dated 8 January 2018 stated that 31 gold bars were to be
distributed equally between them. 32

##### Foot Note 32

×

Husband’s 3rd AM Affidavit at p 18.

Absent further evidence on these gold bars, I accept the Wife’s account that
the emphasis on equal division between the siblings indicated that the gold
bars were an inheritance from the Wife’s father. The gold bars and any
interest generated from them would therefore fall outside the matrimonial
pool: see s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter.

41 Second, as regards the dividends from the family companies, the companies
were incorporated by the Wife’s father and are controlled by the Wife and her
siblings. 33

##### Foot Note 33

×

Wife’s 2nd AAM at para 21–24.

I accept the Wife’s account that any dividends that were due to her were
distributed to her siblings to repay the S$1.2m loan that she took from her
siblings (through [A] Pte Ltd) to purchase the Robertson Quay Property. 34

##### Foot Note 34

×

NE 24 June 2019 at pp 8–9.

This was suggested by the relevant meeting minutes. In any event, the meeting
minutes were ambiguous as to the year that dividends were declared and whether
dividends were actually issued to the Wife or diverted instead to her
siblings. 35

##### Foot Note 35

×

See Husband’s 3rd AM Affidavit at pp 11 (para 6), 14.

42 Accordingly, I decline to draw an adverse inference against the Wife for
any alleged failure to fully disclose her income and assets.

Summary of the identity and valuation of the matrimonial assets

43 The total value of the matrimonial pool is S$13,828,002.76, comprising:

(a) the agreed matrimonial pool set out at [18], viz, S$13,820,002.76; and

(b) the sum of S$8,000.00 which the Wife accepted should be notionally
returned to the pool (at [27]).

Division of the matrimonial assets

44 The parties agreed that the structured approach in ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR
1043 (“ANJ”) applied to determine the division of matrimonial assets. 36

##### Foot Note 36

NE 9 May 2019 at p 2.

This structured approach involves:

(a) expressing as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each
other, in relation to their financial contributions towards the acquisition or
improvement of the matrimonial assets;

(b) expressing as a second ratio their indirect financial and non-financial
contributions relative to each other; and

(c) deriving the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by
taking an average of the two ratios above.

Step 1: Direct financial contributions

45 As there was not always evidence of the parties’ direct contributions
towards the disputed matrimonial assets, I am constrained to use the value of
a party’s share in an asset as a proxy of his or her direct contribution
towards the acquisition of those assets. For consistency, where there is
evidence of the parties’ direct contributions, I have used the ratio of the
direct contributions to apportion the value of that asset between the parties.
I then attribute the apportioned values as the parties’ respective direct
contributions.

46 The parties agreed that the sole owner of the bank accounts and shares
should be taken to have made direct contributions towards the full value of
those assets. 37

What remained in dispute were the ratios of direct contributions to the Wife’s
insurance policies, the Bukit Timah Property, the GB Property and the
Robertson Quay Property. I deal with each of the disputed assets in turn.

(1) The Wife’s insurance policies

47 The Wife submitted that she paid for most of her insurance policies and
adduced contemporaneous handwritten summaries of some payments. 38

##### Foot Note 38

He claimed on affidavit to have made direct contributions of over S$108,000.00

48 Given the inconsistent positions taken by the Husband and the lack of any
evidence on this issue, I do not accept his submission that he contributed to
the Wife’s insurance policies. I find instead that the parties made full
direct contributions to the insurance policies in their respective names.

(2) The Bukit Timah Property

49 The parties accepted that their direct contributions were as reflected in
the Wife’s written submissions, as updated based on the figures in the
Husband’s CPF statement. The updated direct contributions were as follows: 42

(30%)  
| Apportionment of net value of the Bukit Timah Property| 1,778,829.35 | 762,355.44   
  
(3) The GB Property

50 The GB Property was purchased in the Husband’s name in 1980 for
S$379,000.00 using funds from his parents. 43

##### Foot Note 43

Exhibit W2; NE 9 May 2019 at p 6.

51 The Wife submitted that the funds from the Husband’s parents were intended
as a gift to both parties and that the purchase of the GB Property was funded
by a S$100,000.00 loan from her father. 44

##### Foot Note 44

×

Wife’s 1st AAM at para 22.3.

She deposed that the Property was purchased with the mutual understanding that
it would be the parties’ matrimonial home. The intention of the Husband’s
parents in this regard was manifested by their request that the Husband’s
sister and her family move out of the GB Property in around 1986. The
Husband’s parents also intended that the Husband and his two siblings would
each have real property in their names. The Property could not be purchased in
the parties’ joint names in 1980 as they were then unmarried. 45

##### Foot Note 45

×

Wife’s 1st AAM at paras 22.5–22.16.

52 The Husband disputed that the Property was meant to be a gift to the
parties. For one, it was purchased three years before their marriage. While he
accepted that the Wife’s father made a S$100,000.00 loan to the parties, this
loan was not related to the purchase of the GB Property; if so, the Property
would have been purchased in the parties’ joint names. There was no evidence
that the parties contributed towards the upkeep of the Property. Furthermore,
the Husband’s parents lived in the Property from the time it was purchased,
along with the Husband’s siblings at various points. 46

##### Foot Note 46

×

NE 9 May 2019 at pp 7–8.

53 I take guidance from the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in BON and others v
BOQ [2018] 2 SLR 1370 (“BON”). In that case, the husband’s father had provided
S$93,000.00 towards the parties’ exercise of the option to purchase the
matrimonial property. Notwithstanding the evidence of the husband’s father on
affidavit that the sum was for the benefit of the husband alone, his intention
to benefit the couple jointly was reliably inferred from his objective acts
(at [9] and [10]):

9 … [H]e acted to provide the sum for the couple to purchase the property in
their joint names without taking any additional steps to protect the sum from
the wife, through a trust or otherwise.

10 … It does not follow that just because the wife’s parents did not wish to
contribute to the purchase that the father must therefore have intended only
to benefit his son, the husband. It is equally reasonable to infer that the
father had decided to help [the parties] with the purchase of the property for
the benefit of both husband and wife which is consistent with their joint
registration of the property. On balance, therefore, we uphold the Judge’s
finding that the sums were intended as gifts to the couple on the basis that
it was not against the weight of the evidence.

54 I understood from the above reasoning that it was critical in BON that the
property in question was purchased in the parties’ joint names. In contrast,
the GB Property was purchased three years before the marriage and in the
Husband’s sole name. The Property also appeared to be purchased for the
(incidental) benefit of the Husband’s parents and siblings: the Wife did not
appear to have a say as to who else was to live there. Indeed, she deposed
that the Husband had told her that if the purchase of the GB Property
proceeded, they would “be sacrificing [their] privacy as newly-weds as [they]
would have to stay with [the Husband’s] parents and his other siblings”
[emphasis added]. 47

##### Foot Note 47

×

Wife’s 1st AAM at para 22.4.

There was also insufficient evidence as to the purpose for which the loan of
S$100,000.00 from the Wife’s father was made.

55 In my view, the evidence supported a finding that the Husband’s parents
wanted him and his siblings to each own property in their respective names.
They contributed to the purchase of the GB Property with the intention that it
should be a gift to him solely, and with the understanding that they (and
their other children) would also benefit from such contribution. This
intention was consistent with the fact that the GB Property was not purchased
in the parties’ joint names, and by the subsequent use of the GB Property by
the Husband’s parents and siblings, even though the Husband’s use of the
Property was prioritised. I accordingly treat the S$379,000.00 used for the
purchase of the GB Property as a gift from the Husband’s parents to him alone
and apportion the full value of the Property of S$5.7m to him.

(4) The Robertson Quay Property

56 The Wife submitted that she made 100% of the direct contributions to the
Robertson Quay Property. The Robertson Quay Property was purchased in 2007,
completed in 2009 and had a purchase price of S$2,801,900.00. According to the
Wife, the moneys used to purchase the Robertson Quay Property were as follows:

57 The Husband accepted that the Wife’s direct contributions towards the
Robertson Quay Property was S$1,061,232.40, comprising: 53

(a) the S$140,095.00 booking fee (referenced at [56(a)]);

(b) the Wife’s repayment of S$300,000 of the S$1.2m loan from her family
(referenced at [56(c)]); and

(c) the Wife’s repayment of the UOB mortgage loan in the sum of S$621,137.40.

58 Two alleged contributions were disputed between the parties.

59 First, the Wife claimed that she received an additional gift of
S$500,000.00 from her father that she put towards the purchase of the
Robertson Quay Property. Reference to this sum was only made in JS2 and in the
Wife’s oral submissions, but not in her written submissions. 54

##### Foot Note 54

×

See JS2 at p 20; NE 9 May 2019 at p 3; cf WS at paras 42, 52.

The Wife appeared to accept later in the AM hearing that there was no
documentary evidence to show that a gift had been made to her from her father,
and did not include the S$500,000.00 as a direct contribution from her. 55

##### Foot Note 55

×

NE 9 May 2019 at p 10.

Given the lack of documentary evidence on this issue, I will not consider this
alleged contribution any further.

60 Second, the Husband claimed to have contributed S$100,000.00 towards the
Robertson Quay Property, this sum being his share of the sale proceeds of the
East Coast Property after accounting for the Wife’s use of the proceeds for
the benefit of the family. The Wife disagreed, arguing that the full sale
proceeds of the East Coast Property (amounting to S$660,000.00) were used for
the family’s expenses: specifically, to rent an apartment for her and the
Children from 2001 to 2003, and to pay for their living expenses, the
Children’s education and a car. 56

##### Foot Note 56

×

WS at para 49; Wife’s 3rd AAM at para 8.

I find that there is insufficient basis for the Husband to earmark
S$100,000.00 of the East Coast Property’s sale proceeds and to claim that this
sum was used to purchase the Robertson Quay Property. As the Wife argued, the
sale of the East Coast Property and the purchase of the Robertson Quay
Property were not so closely proximate that it could be reasonably inferred
that the sale proceeds of the former were used to purchase the latter. I am
also satisfied that the Wife has largely accounted for the moneys used to
purchase the Robertson Quay Property, and that it is more likely than not that
her account is accurate.

61 Taking a broad brush approach and keeping in mind that the Robertson Quay
Property was purchased in the Wife’s sole name, I find that she made 100% of
the direct contributions towards the Robertson Quay Property.

Summary of the parties’ direct financial contributions

62 The ratio of direct financial contributions is 71:29 between the Husband
and the Wife, based on their respective direct contributions as set out below:

S/No| Asset / Liability| Husband’s direct contributions (S$)| Wife’s direct
contributions (S$)  
---|---|---|---  
1| Bukit Timah Property| 1,778,829.35 | 762,355.44   
2| Assets in the Wife’s sole name (including the Robertson Quay Property and
S$8000.00 to be nominally returned to the pool)| -| 3,279,082.71  
3| Assets in the Husband’s sole name (including the GB Property)|
8,007,735.26| -  
| Total direct contributions to the matrimonial pool|  9,786,564.61  
(71%) | 4,041,438.15  
(29%)  
  
Step 2: Indirect contributions

63 The Husband submitted that the ratio of indirect contributions between him
and the Wife was 40:60. He has been paying for the youngest Child’s university
fees overseas and has shared equal parenting responsibilities in raising the
Children, bringing them on multiple overseas holidays, helping with their
schoolwork and fetching them to school and other enrichment programs. However,
he acknowledged that his contributions towards their education was limited by
his frequent travelling. 57

##### Foot Note 57

JS2 at p 17, S/N 3; NE 9 May 2019 at p 13.

He stated on affidavit that the Wife contributed more towards the family needs
of the Children and sacrificed her personal career in the process, but
highlighted that she receives a monthly allowance of around S$1,200.00 from
their three elder Children. 58

##### Foot Note 58

×

Husband’s 3rd AM Affidavit at para 6.

64 On the Wife’s part, she submitted she paid for the household expenses and
the Children’s pre-university educational expenses. She also worked during the
marriage and had to juggle the Children’s day-to-day needs and managing the
household. The Husband was often absent as he had to travel overseas for work.
He also had multiple affairs during the marriage. Her homemaking and parenting
contributions supported the Husband’s successful career. She emphasised that
her position was not that the Husband did not contribute at all to the
marriage but that the ratio of indirect contributions should be 30:70 between
the Husband and her. 59

##### Foot Note 59

×

WS at paras 58–66.

65 The parties were generally agreed that the Wife made greater indirect
contributions to the marriage. I find that she made significant personal
sacrifices for the marriage and the family throughout the 35-year marriage,
and dedicated herself to raising the Children and managing the household
especially when the Husband was travelling for work or was otherwise absent.
At the same time, the Husband did contribute to some expenses and was present
for the Children. Taking a broad brush approach in this assessment, I find
that a ratio of 30:70 between the Husband and the Wife is fair and equitable.

Step 3: Average ratio

66 The average ratio of the direct and indirect contributions between the
Husband and the Wife is 50.5:49.5:

| Husband (%)| Wife (%)  
---|---|---  
Direct contributions| 71| 29  
Indirect contributions| 30| 70  
Average ratio| 50.5| 49.5  
  
67 In ANJ at [27], the Court of Appeal held that the average ratio may be
shifted to take into account, inter alia, the length of the marriage, the size
of the matrimonial assets and its constituents, and the extent and nature of
the indirect contributions. As regards the final factor, the Court of Appeal
observed:

… The courts also tend to give weighty consideration to homemakers who have
painstakingly raised children to adulthood, especially where such efforts have
entailed significant career sacrifices on their part.

68 I take into account that the marriage was long, the manner in which the
Wife prioritised the Children over her career, and the adverse inference drawn
against the Husband for his failure to make full disclosure of his income and
assets (see above at [37]). This is a case where it would be appropriate to
adjust the average ratio. In so doing, I take into account the High Court’s
observations in UBM v UBN [2017] 4 SLR 921 at [25]–[27] and [32] that the
court is not bound to adjust the average ratio only by according different
weightages to the direct and indirect contributions. In the circumstances, I
adjust the average ratio for the Wife, and shift the ratio of her share from
49.5% to 53%. The final distribution ratio is therefore 47:53 between the
Husband and the Wife.

Apportionment of the matrimonial assets

69 The total value of the matrimonial pool is S$13,828,002.76 (see [43]
above). Applying a distribution ratio of 47:53, the respective shares of the
matrimonial pool of the Husband and the Wife translate to S$6,6,499,161.30 and
S$7,328,841.46. After deducting the assets held by the Wife, S$4,049,758.75
remains payable to her (being S$7,328,841.46 – S$3,279,082.71). I set a
timeframe of six months for the Husband to make the necessary transfers, which
is to take into consideration how the Bukit Timah Property will be dealt with
and accounted for. I also grant liberty to apply within the six months of this
judgment should further directions be required on the apportionment of the
matrimonial assets.

Maintenance for the youngest Child

70 The youngest Child is 21 years old this year and is pursuing her university
education overseas. My jurisdiction to order maintenance in relation to her
university expenses would fall under s 69(5)(c) of the Women’s Charter. This
subsection provides that the court shall not order a parent to make payment
towards the maintenance of his or her child if the child has attained the age
of 21, unless the court is satisfied that the child is or will be receiving
further education.

71 The Wife submitted that she was willing to pay for 25% of the overall costs
of the youngest Child’s overseas education. 60

##### Foot Note 60

×

NE 24 June 2019 at p 6.

The Husband did not make submissions on this issue, but appears happy to
financially support the Child’s university fees in similar proportions as that
submitted by the Wife. 61

##### Foot Note 61

×

JS2 at p 4, S/N 2.

I order that both parties are to contribute to their youngest Child’s
university expenses, but leave it to them to agree on the amounts of such
maintenance. I grant parties liberty to apply in the event there is no
agreement.

Maintenance for the Wife

72 The Wife sought a lump sum maintenance of S$270,000.00, based on a
multiplicand of S$1,500.00 and a multiplier of 15 years. 62

##### Foot Note 62

×

WS at para 88.

The Husband objected to an order of maintenance for the Wife, and argued that
the Wife is in a better financial position than him and can rely both on the
dividends from her family companies and on the returns from her gold bars to
maintain herself. 63

##### Foot Note 63

×

NE 24 June 2019 at pp 6–8.

73 I agree with the Husband that it would be relevant to consider the Wife’s
financial resources in determining whether maintenance should be ordered and
in what quantum: s 114(1)(a) of the Women’s Charter; AVM v AWH [2015] 4 SLR
1274 (“AVM”) at [91]–[98]. In AVM, the High Court declined to award the wife
substantial maintenance as the husband, who was an undischarged bankrupt, did
not appear to have the capacity to pay maintenance. Furthermore, the wife had
shown herself both during and after the marriage to be a resourceful
businesswoman who had achieved economic independence for herself.

74 In the present case, I accept the Wife’s explanation that she cannot rely
on dividends from her family company to support herself, as these dividends
are to be put towards repaying her debt to her family for financing the
Robertson Quay Property. However, she has received a substantial share of the
matrimonial assets and would have income, including the rental from the
Robertson Quay Property, sufficient for her maintenance if she manages the
assets properly. She also enjoys the financial support of her three adult
Children. The Husband himself is closely approaching retirement age. In fact,
he has already retired once and is working on a contract basis. Moreover, some
of his assets will have to be transferred to the Wife to give effect to the
division order. Given the circumstances, I do not think that maintenance for
the Wife should be awarded.

Conclusion

75 For the reasons above, I make the following orders:

(a) The matrimonial assets are to be distributed in the proportions of 47:53
between the Husband and the Wife, with the Husband to transfer S$4,049,758.75
to the Wife within six months from the date of this judgment.

(b) The parties are to maintain their youngest Child and are to share the
costs of her university expenses. No order is made as to the proportions of
such maintenance.

(c) No maintenance is ordered for the Wife.

76 I encourage parties to agree on costs, failing which they are to file and
exchange submissions on the issue of costs (limited to 10 pages excluding
exhibits and case authorities) within 21 days from the date of this judgment.
