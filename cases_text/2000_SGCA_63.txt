(delivering the judgment of the court): **_Introduction_**  
  
This is an appeal against the decision of Lai Siu Chiu J, on the construction
of a Will, where she authorised the sale of a property of a testator located
at No 42 Phillips Avenue (`the property`).  
  
**_The facts_**

****

The testator was one Leo Ann Peng (LAP). LAP made his Will on 26 March 1970
and died some 19 years later on 28 September 1989. He left behind his widow
and five sons. Four sons are involved in this proceeding but not the fifth
(the eldest), as the latter was given only $1 under the Will. In his Will, LAP
appointed two sons, Leo Teng Kit (the first respondent) and Leo Teng Choy (the
appellant) to be his trustees.  
  
LAP purchased the property in 1956. He resided there until his death. The
property was his only substantial asset. During much of his lifetime, the
family lived together at the property, but as the sons grew up and got married
and due to overcrowding, one son, Leoh Teng Hee (the second respondent) and
his wife moved out of the family home in 1980 and have since lived on their
own.  
  
Sometime in 1992, the first respondent and his family moved out of the
property. In September 1992, LAP`s widow, who was also the children`s mother,
Heng Took Kin, suffered a stroke and was hospitalised. It would appear that
after Mdm Heng`s discharge, the appellant refused to take her back. Instead,
she went to live with the second respondent. Another son, Leo Tang Foh (the
third respondent) moved out of the property in about the same year, leaving
the appellant (together with his wife and children) in sole occupation.  
  
In December 1996, the first respondent visited the property and found that the
appellant had thrown away all the furniture and belongings of the respondents
and their mother, which were at the property. The appellant said he threw them
away because they were infested with termites. A survey report was furnished
in support thereof. In view of the fact that everybody had moved out except
the appellant, the first respondent tried to sort out with the appellant on
how to deal with the property, without success.  
  
Eventually, the three respondents decided, together with their mother, that
the best course would be to sell the property and to distribute the proceeds
equally between the four sons (the appellant and the three respondents). Thus,
in April 1999 the respondents filed an originating summons for an order to
sell the property. The respondents also filed a statutory declaration, made by
their mother about two years earlier on 5 July 1997, in support of their
application. At the time the mother made the statutory declaration, she was
examined by a consultant psychiatrist who certified that she was mentally fit
to make the declaration. On 7 July 1999, the mother passed away.  
  
The statutory declaration was made by the mother in anticipation that
litigation would ensue between the four sons. In it she confirmed the
allegations made by the first respondent that the appellant had a violent
temper and a violent disposition towards his brothers and their families.  
  
On 15 February 2000, after hearing arguments and considering the affidavits
filed by the parties, the judge below ordered that the property be sold at a
price of not less than $3.75m and that the proceeds were to be divided equally
between the four brothers. In coming to her decision, Lai Siu Chiu J held that
the Will created a trust for sale of the property and that cl 3 merely
postponed the sale.  
  
The clauses in the Will which are pertinent to the present proceeding are the
following:

> _
>
> 2 I give and devise my land and house No 42, Phillips Avenue, Singapore unto
> my trustees upon trust to stand possessed of the same and to allow my wife
> Heng Took Kin and my sons Leo Teng Kit, Leoh Teng Hee, Leo Teng Choy and Leo
> Tang Foh to reside therein free of rent provided each of my said sons shall
> pay one-fourth share of all rates, taxes, charges and expenses on repairs as
> shall from time to time be incurred.
>
> 3 I direct that my said land and house No 42 Phillips Avenue, Singapore,
> shall not be sold, rented out or in any way converted into cash unless and
> until unanimously agreed upon by my said sons Leo Teng Kit, Leo Teng Hee,
> Leo Teng Choy and Leo Tang Foh in which event the net proceeds of sale from
> the said land and house shall be distributed to my said sons in equal
> shares.
>
> 4 In the event of the death of any of my aforesaid sons either before my
> death or after my death but before the said land and house is sold his share
> shall be divided among his children in equal shares and if there be no
> children his share shall revert to the surviving beneficiaries in equal
> shares.
>
> ...
>
> 6 Subject to the payment of my debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, I
> devise and bequeath all the residue and remainder of my real and personal
> estate whatsoever and wheresoever situate to my said sons, Leo Teng Kit,
> Leoh Teng Hee, Leo Teng Choy and Leo Tang Foh in equal shares absolutely.
>
> _

  
  
**_The appeal_ **

****

The appellant is dissatisfied with the order made on 15 February 2000 and has
therefore appealed to this court. He challenged the ruling of the court below
that there is here a trust for sale. His contention is that there could be no
sale until and unless all the four beneficiaries agreed. Each of the four
beneficiaries, together with their mother, had the right to reside therein.  
  
**_Trust for sale_**

****

In coming to her decision that there was here a trust for sale, but only that
the sale was postponed, Lai Siu Chiu J relied upon the cases, **Duke of
Marlborough v A-G (No 2)** [1945] Ch 145 and **Rajabali Jumabhoy & Ors v
Ameerali R Jumabhoy** [1998] 2 SLR 439 .  
  
However, there is a significant difference between the clauses in
**_Marlborough_** , and the clauses in the Will of LAP. In **_Marlborough_** ,
cl 3 of the deed provided that land was conveyed to and was held by trustees
upon an express trust `to sell the same`. Such a provision is missing in the
Will here. Furthermore, cl 11 of the deed in **_Marlborough_** provided that:

> _Notwithstanding anything herein contained, no sale of any hereditaments for
> the time being subject to the trusts hereof ... shall (except in pursuance
> of an order of the court) be made by the trustees or trustee without the
> previous consent in writing of the present Duke during his life and after
> the death of the present Duke without the previous consent in writing of the
> person in whom the Dukedom of Marlborough settled by the said Act ... shall
> for the time being be vested thereunder if such person shall be of full
> age._

  
  
It was in view of the express provision in cl 3 that Morton LJ said that the
consent of the Duke was intended to regulate the exercise of the trust for
sale but not to prevent the trust for sale from being an immediate trust. He
also declared `if there is an immediate trust for sale, whether subject to
consent or not, the trust operates at once to effect a conversion ... It is
also well settled that the existence of a power to postpone sale does not
prevent conversion taking place.`  
  
**_Marlborough_** was applied in **_Rajabali Jumabhoy_** where there was also
an express provision of a trust for sale. There, the relevant clauses of the
settlements read as follows:

> _
>
> 1 The settlor hereby conveys unto the trustees ... property ... upon trust
> that they shall with the consent of the settlor ... and with the consent of
> the survivor of them ... sell the same in such manner as they may think
> proper with power nevertheless to postpone the sale so long as in their
> discretion they may think fit.
>
> 2 The trustees shall hold the net proceeds of sale of the said property ...
> upon trust that they shall invest the same.
>
> _

  
  
This court held that a trust for sale was created. Applying **_Marlborough_**
we also said in that case:

> _Although a power was given to the trustees to decide when the property
> should be sold, such power would not prevent a trust for sale from being
> created. Equally, the requirement of Rajabali`s consent for the sale made no
> significant impact on whether or not the settlement created a trust for
> sale, as this related to the timing of the sale and did not affect the
> overriding direction that the property should be sold._

  
  
It will be seen from [para ] 9 above, that the Will does not expressly state
that there shall be a trust for sale. Clause 2 confers upon the four sons and
their mother a right to reside in the property. Clause 3 provides that the
property `shall not be sold` and it may only be sold if all the four sons
agreed. The latter can hardly be construed to be a direction to the trustee to
sell. This is wholly unlike the situations in **_Marlborough_** and
**_Rajabali Jumabhoy_** which were really concerned with the question whether
the provisions in the deed requiring the consent of a specified person
precluded the express provision of a trust for sale from having its usual
effect and the courts held it did not. Here, the Will created only an ordinary
trust, with the trustees being directed to hold the property for the use of
the four sons and their mother but if all the four sons agreed they could
cause the property to be sold. There is no direction by the testator that the
trustees sell the property. Accordingly, and with the utmost respect, we would
disagree with the judge below that there is here a trust for sale. On this
point, we accept the submission of the appellant.  
  
Counsel for the parties also referred to **Re Herklots` Will Trusts** [1964] 2
All ER 66[1964] 1 WLR 585. But there again, like **_Marlborough_** and
**_Rajabali Jumabhoy_** , the testatrix expressly provided that the residue of
her property be held on trust for sale, and at the same time also provided
that the income of the residue was to be given to G for life `without
prejudice to the trust for sale herein contained` with permission `to reside
in my said house during her life for so long as she wishes.` Subject to that
life interest, the residue was given, as to one third to the plaintiff and the
remaining two-thirds to others. By a codicil the testatrix directed that her
trustees should transfer the house to the plaintiff absolutely if he so wished
to have it in part settlement of the one-third share to which he would be
entitled under the Will. The testatrix further provided that if the value of
the house was greater than one-third of the residue, the shares of the other
beneficiaries were to be reduced. After the testatrix died, G proposed to sell
the house, which was worth more than a third of the residue, without the
consent of the plaintiff. Ungoed-Thomas J held that, on a true construction of
the Will, the permission given to G to reside in the house for so long as she
wished was not inconsistent with the trust for sale. He also held that as the
plaintiff was, under the codicil, given the option of obtaining the house for
himself, the sale proposed by G could not be effected without the consent of
the plaintiff. Nothing in **_Re Herklots`_** advances the decision in
**_Marlborough_** any further with regard to this particular point.  
  
**_Nature of interest_**

****

What then is the interest created by the Will in favour of the four sons?
Counsel for the appellants argued that as the Will confers upon the four sons
a right to reside in the property rent-free, and as the appellant would like
to continue to reside thereon, the interest of the sons, as beneficiaries, in
the property is only a contingent interest. We are unable to accept this
submission. An interest is contingent only when it is liable to be defeated on
the happening or non-happening of an event. Here, there is no specified
condition which the beneficiaries need to fulfil before they are entitled to
the interest spelt out in the Will. There is no question of the interest of
any beneficiary being devolved to someone else on the happening/non-happening
of an event. Each son is entitled to his share. However, as provided in cll 2
and 3 of the Will, their right to realise their shares in the property is
subject to a unanimous agreement to do so. Their right to a share in the
property is not in question. The only matter is whether they could arrive at a
unanimous agreement to realise the property. Therefore, the only matter is as
to the timing of them agreeing unanimously to the sale and thus realising
their shares. If all four of them agreed, they could direct the trustees to
dispose of the property as they seem fit, and extinguish the trust: see
**Saunders v Vautier** [1841] 4 Beav 115(Unreported) .  
  
**_Scope of s 56(1)_**

****

So what we have here is a **_trust simpliciter_** and not a trust for sale.
The next question that arises for consideration is whether in view of cll 2
and 3 of the Will, and the objection of the appellant, this is a case which
falls within s 56(1) of the Trustees Act (Cap 337) (`the Act`) and if the
answer to that question is in the affirmative, whether the discretion granted
to the court in that section should be exercised in favour of the respondents
and a sale be ordered.  
  
Section 56 (previously numbered s 59) of the Act provides as follows:

> _
>
> (1) Where in the management or administration of any property vested in
> trustees, any sale, lease, ... is in the opinion of the court expedient, but
> the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that
> purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument, if any, or by law,
> the court may -
>
> (a) by order confer upon the trustees, ... the necessary power for the
> purpose, on such terms, and subject to such provisions and conditions, if
> any, as the court may think fit; and
>
> (b) direct in what manner any money authorised to be expended, and the costs
> of any transaction, are to be paid or borne as between capital and income.
>
> (2) ...
>
> (3) An application to the court under this section may be made by the
> trustees, or by any of them or by any person beneficially interested under
> the trust.
>
> _

  
  
The present application to court for an order was made by the three
respondents, who are beneficiaries. By virtue of s 56(3), they undoubtedly
have the locus standi to do so.  
  
In construing s 56, there is a need to consider s 2(2) to determine, if at
all, the powers of the court in s 56 are qualified by s 2(2), which reads:

> _The powers conferred by this Act**on trustees** are in addition to the
> powers conferred by the instrument, ... but those powers, unless otherwise
> stated, apply if and so far only as a contrary intention is not expressed in
> the instrument.`_

  
  
It would be noted that s 2(2) relates to `powers conferred by the Act on
trustees`. So does s 56(1) confer powers on the court or on the trustees? It
is clear that s 56(1) confers powers on the court to make orders authorising,
inter alia, the sale of a trust property when it is expedient to do so and
where `the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any powers for
that purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument.` It is plain that
s 56(1) does not confer powers on the trustees. The fact that an order of
court granted under s 56(1) would, in effect, enable the trustees to do an act
which they would not otherwise be authorised by the instrument of trust to do
did not mean that the power is conferred on the trustee by the Act. Examples
in the Act of powers being conferred on trustees are s 33 (power to apply
income for maintenance) and s 34 (power of advancement). It is significant to
note that s 56 falls under Part V of the Act, intitled `Powers of Court`
whereas Part III is intitled `General Powers of Trustees and Personal
Representatives`. Therefore, we hold that s 56 is not subject to s 2(2).  
  
In **British & Malayan Trustees Ltd v Abdul Jalil bin Ahmad & Ors** [1990] SLR
1066  [1991] 1 MLJ 465 , the High Court seemed to have thought that s 2(2)
applied to s 56(1). This court had in **_Rajabali Jumabhoy_** ruled that that
was an error.  
  
**_Should the discretion be exercised in favour of a sale_**

****

The power of the court to authorise sale of trust property under s 56 can only
arise where, in the `management or administration` of any property, a sale of
the property is in the opinion of the court expedient and the same cannot be
effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose. In
**_Rajabali Jumabhoy_** this court endorsed the views of the Court of Appeal
in **Re Downshire Settled Estates** [1953] Ch 218 which held that those two
words meant `the managerial supervision and control of trust property on
behalf of the beneficiaries.` We also held that s 56(1) cannot be invoked to
sanction or authorise an act or transaction where there is an express
prohibition against such act or transaction contained in the trust instrument.
The power of the court should only be exercised for the benefit of the whole
trust: **Re Craven`s Estate (No 2); Lloyds Bank v Cockburn** [1937] Ch 431.
But it does not mean that the proposed transaction must be for the benefit of
each and every individual beneficiary; rather a broad view of the matter
should be taken: **Re Dawson** [1959] NZLR 1360.  
  
The argument of the appellant is that reading cll 2 and 3 together, it is
clear that the testator had directed that the property not be sold until and
unless all the four sons agreed. Thus, it may be appropriate to determine what
was the overriding intention of the testator. For that purpose, it is
necessary for the court to look not only at cll 2 and 3 but also other clauses
of the Will: **Re Evan`s Settlement** [1967] 3 All ER 343[1967] 1 WLR 1294.
Clauses 2 gives the four beneficiaries and their mother the right to reside
therein. Clause 3 authorises a sale if all the four beneficiaries agree and in
the event of a sale, the proceeds are to be shared equally. While the clause
also states that the property `shall not be sold ... or in any way converted
into cash`, the object is not to prohibit sale but rather that the
beneficiaries should act jointly. Clause 4 provides that if a beneficiary
should die, his share would devolve to his children but if he should be
without children, his shares would go to the surviving beneficiaries equally.
Clause 6 provides that the residue of the estate shall be shared equally among
the beneficiaries.  
  
It is a general principle of construction of a Will that the court should
ascertain the intention of the testator from the Will as a whole in the light
of any extrinsic evidence admissible for the purpose of its construction. The
picture that emerged clearly from these clauses is that of a testator who
wanted to treat his four sons evenly. Each son is to have the same rights to
reside therein and to share in the proceeds. The overriding consideration was
not so much to prohibit the sale of the property but to ensure that they shall
benefit equally from his estate. The following passage of Knight Bruce LJ in
**Kay v Kay** [1853] 4 De GM & G 73 at pp 84-85 explained why a strict literal
construction must, in appropriate circumstances, give way to a construction
which is in accord with the broad objective of the testator:

> _In common with all men, I must acknowledge that there are many cases upon
> the construction of documents, in which the spirit is strong enough to
> overcome the letter; cases in which it is impossible for a reasonable being,
> upon a careful perusal of an instrument, not to be satisfied from its
> contents that a literal, a strict, or an ordinary interpretation given to
> particular passages, would disappoint and defeat the intention with which
> the instrument, read as a whole, persuades and convinces him that it was
> framed. A man so convinced is authorised and bound to construe the writing
> accordingly._

  
  
The plan of the testator, which was the basis upon which he wrote his Will,
was that all the four sons and their wives (and children) should share the
same roof in harmony. That was his basic premise. Therefore, in cl 2, he
provided that each son has to bear one-fourth share of all rates, taxes,
charges and expenses on repairs. He did not anticipate a situation where one
son might not be residing there. What then would be the position of a son who
has moved out? Is he obliged to contribute? While any fair-minded person would
naturally have said that in that situation that son would not be required to
contribute, the absence of a provision to that effect merely underscores what
was primarily in the mind of the testator, namely, that all the four sons
should share the same roof. He would not contemplate otherwise.  
  
In our opinion, the court in sanctioning the sale would not only not be acting
contrary to the directions expressed in the Will, but would, in fact, be
carrying out the overriding intention of the testator. Indeed, to allow the
appellant to enjoy the property solely would run counter to what was the basic
intention implicit in his Will. It is hardly necessary for us to go into the
cause or causes why the four sons could no longer share the same roof or to
determine who were at fault. It should surprise no one that a house which was
adequate for one family should be found to be inadequate for four families and
that friction would, as a result, arise between the families and the best
course was to split and move out. One may ask: why didn`t the testator think
of that possibility. He might perhaps have hoped that his children and their
families would stay in peace and harmony under the same roof, and the Will was
to encourage them doing so.  
  
However, there is one feature which we must refer to. The second respondent
moved out of the property in 1980, well before the death of the testator. The
question may well be asked why did the testator not make the necessary
alteration to his Will, if his overriding consideration was that everyone
should reside in the property and should share in it. We must emphasise that
the overriding consideration which is relevant here is his overriding
consideration at the time he made his Will. Any answer to that question would
necessarily be purely speculative because there is no single answer. On the
one hand, it could be that he did not think of the implications to the Will
when that son moved out. On the other hand, it could also be that he thought
no change need be made, and if this should be the case, the question that
follows is why did he think no change need be made. Only the testator would
know the answer. There may well be other reasons. But, in any case, for the
purposes of construing a Will, it is the circumstances prevailing at the time
the Will was drawn that were relevant. Therefore, the fact that the testator
made no alteration to his Will in 1980 is quite immaterial to determining his
overriding intention in 1970.  
  
Having regard to the foregoing, the authorising of the sale would not only be
expedient but would be wholly in consonance with the overriding intention of
the testator. While the sale would mean that the appellant would not be able
to reside in the property any more, he would be entitled to a share of the
proceeds. The impasse between the parties should not be allowed to drag on any
further.  
  
**_Judgment_**

****

In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs. The security for costs
(with any accrued interest) shall be paid out to the respondents or their
solicitors.  
  
Following the decision of the court below, there was a further consent order
that execution of the order of 15 February 2000 be stayed. We now lift the
stay order and direct that the property be sold within 90 days from the date
hereof, subject to the reserved price specified by the court below.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
