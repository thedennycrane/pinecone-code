Tort – Nuisance – Damages – Whether the trial judge erring in assessment of
quantum of damages awarded  
  

25 April 2006

Woo Bih Li J:

1 The plaintiff, Hu Su Chu, is a Taiwanese and was the owner of the property
known as 32 Jalan Rajah, #18-01, Rajah Tower, Singapore. The defendants, Wee
Ek Chian and Lee Hui Kheng, are the owners and occupiers of the property one
floor directly above the plaintiff’s property, at #19-01 (the “defendants’
property”). The plaintiff claimed that on or about January 2001, water leaked
from the defendants’ property to her property. The leakage continued until
early 2002. The plaintiff pleaded _res ipsa loquitur_ with regard to the cause
of the leakage. The plaintiff pleaded negligence and nuisance against the
defendants.

2 The trial judge found the defendants liable for nuisance, but not
negligence, and awarded the plaintiff $9,000 for loss of rental between 16
November 2001 to 31 March 2002. This was substantially less than what the
plaintiff was claiming, under various heads of damages. Accordingly, the
plaintiff appealed against the trial judge’s award of $9,000 only.

3 The crux of the appeal was the quantum of damages the plaintiff was seeking.
The trial judge had not allowed her claims for the following:

(a) reduction in rental of $200 per month for 11 months from January to
November 2001, amounting to $2,200;

(b) loss of rental from 1 April 2002 to 1 April 2003;

(c) miscellaneous expenses:

(i) return airfare for trips to Singapore amounting to $7,846.87 and costs for
extension of an air ticket at $146;

(ii) taxi fares to and from the airports in Singapore and Taiwan, fees for
extension of a social visit pass and accommodation during the plaintiff’s stay
in Singapore;

(iii) extra living expenses, phone calls and utilities, printing of
photographs, photocopying and postage;

(iv) translation, advertisement and documentation fees;

(v) medical treatment;

(vi) purchase of materials to do painting and parquet; and

(vii) maintenance fees, fire insurance and property tax.

(d) damages for anxiety and distress;

(e) loss as a result of a drop in the market value of her property; and

(f) loss as a result of delay in the carrying out of rectification works.

4 Before me, the plaintiff did not pursue her claim for maintenance fees, fire
insurance and property tax.

5 After hearing submissions, I was of the view that the plaintiff had failed
to establish that the trial judge had erred in the reasons for her
conclusions. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal.
