Introduction

1 On 1 July 2009 I delivered my written judgment (“the Judgment”) in this Suit
with an order for parties to make submissions on the question of costs.
However, due to the complexities of this case, which was completed only after
42 hearing days and in which there are four defendants and a total of five
counterclaims, I gave liberty to the parties to apply for clarifications of my
orders in the Judgment. In the event, the parties appeared before me on the
question of costs and also for clarifications as well as further arguments to
correct certain errors in the Judgment. This occupied another three days, at
the end of which I found it necessary to issue this Addendum to the Judgment.

2 In this Addendum, I adopt the same nomenclature used in the Judgment. The
Addendum will state the relevant parts of the Judgment that are modified or
altered, with the reasons for them wherever applicable. In the event of any
conflict between this Addendum and the Judgment, this Addendum is to take
precedence over the Judgment. There have been submissions made by various
parties on various points that I have considered but rejected. Some of those
submissions are not reflected in this Addendum; I did not consider this
necessary in view of the fact that I maintained those parts of my original
decision, the reasons for which have been given in the Judgment.

Typographical errors

3 There were two typographical errors in the Judgment: at [18], the words
“provisional costs items” in the second sentence should read “prime costs
items” and at [68], the words “Hok Mee” in the last sentence should read “Hok
Chung”. Those paragraphs in the Judgment should be read accordingly.

Overpayments to Hok Chung

4 In [31] of the Judgment I had found that Hok Chung had been overpaid the sum
of $3,394,400 and ordered Hok Mee to refund this amount to the Partnership. At
[40] of the Judgment I also made Hok Chung liable to refund this amount to the
Partnership. I had arrived at the sum of $5,091,600 as the total of the PC
Rate items paid to Hok Chung and based on my finding that the actual cost was
only one-third of this amount, I had found that Hok Chung had been overpaid by
two-thirds of that amount, _viz_ $3,394,400. However in computing this I had
not taken into consideration the following matters:

(a) An item called “Granite Niche Cover to Modules $1,462,880” had been
omitted from the works and the item had been considered in AGA’s Qualified
Final Account. Therefore this item should be excluded from the computation of
the total PC Rate items.

(b) There was a change to granolithic finishes (in lieu of granite finish) to
the floor of the Annex Block which resulted in an omission of $1,078,206.40.
As Hok Chung was similarly not paid for this, it should also be excluded from
the total PC Rate items.

(c) Hok Chung was entitled to 15% profit for attendance for works carried out
and this works out to be $127,525.68.

In the premises, the total overpayment to Hok Chung would be two-thirds of
($5,091,600-$1,462,880-$1,078,206.40) with a deduction for profit for
attendance of $127,525.68, which results in the sum of $1,572,816.72.

5 Therefore, the order in [31] of the Judgment should be for Hok Mee to refund
to the Partnership the sum of $1,572,816.72 and in [40] of the Judgment, for
Hok Chung to refund $1,572,816.72 to the Partnership.

Loans to PLD directors

6 At [35] of the Judgment, I had found that PLD and Hok Mee had to account to
the Partnership for the $800,000 advanced to four directors of PLD out of the
proceeds of sale of the niches. There I had held that they should be liable in
the ratio of their respective shares of the profits. However I agree with
counsel for Hok Mee that the apportionment should be equal on the ground that
it did not concern any sharing of profit as no profit was eventually made by
the Partnership. Therefore my order in [35] of the Judgment is to be amended
accordingly, and PLD is liable for $400,000.00 and Hok Mee also for
$400,000.00.

Commission to the Temple

7 In [36] of the Judgment, I had found that the Temple was entitled to
outstanding commission of $1m from the Partnership. As the commission was to
be paid from the gross proceeds of sale, this debt is to rank ahead of all
other payments due from the Partnership. Hok Mee submitted that this debt
should rank _pari passu_ with the loans and advances made by PLD, Hok Mee and
Hok Chung. I do not agree with this on the ground that the latter were loans
made by the partners whereas the commission to the Temple was an expense. As
for the outstanding management fee due to Hok Mee, I was of the view that that
should rank _pari passu_ with the said loans and advances in view of Hok Mee’s
conduct.

Overpayment to Hok Chung

8 In [39] of the Judgment, I had ordered Hok Chung to refund $2,005,856.03 to
the Partnership being the amount overpaid to it. However I had not taken into
consideration the fact that there should not have been an omission of $50,000
(which was made by the Architects) for the minor sewer works construction.
Taking that into account, the refund should be reduced by that sum to
$1,955,856.03. I therefore order this reduced amount to be refunded by Hok
Chung to the Partnership instead. Hok Chung had made further submissions on
other reasons for reducing this sum further, all of which I rejected.

Corporate veil

9 In [44] of the Judgment, I had held that the corporate veil should be lifted
against Kek in respect of Hok Mee and Hok Chung. I had found in [39] and [40]
of the Judgment (as amended in this Addendum) that the relevant losses were
the sums of $1,955,856.03 and $1,572,816.72 due from Hok Chung. Consistent
with my finding in [44] of the Judgment, I order that Kek be personally liable
to the Partnership for these amounts, totalling $3,528,672.75.

Kickback from AGA

10 In [50] of the Judgment I had ordered Hok Mee to refund the kickback
received from AGA of a sum amounting to $1,108,406.49. This sum is incorrect
and the correct amount is $358,400.

$400,000 advance to the Temple

11 In [55] of the Judgment, I had held that the Temple was not liable to
refund to the Partnership the sum of $400,000. This money was advanced to the
Temple at the time when the agreement between the Partners was for the Temple
to be entitled to a 25% profit share in return for bearing the marketing
costs. The explicit agreement in relation to the $400,000 when it was advanced
by the Partnership to the Temple was that this would be set off against the
share of profit that the Temple would in due course receive. However in [36]
of the Judgment, I had found that this profit sharing agreement was
subsequently altered by the partners. Under the new agreement, which was not
in writing but evidenced by minutes of meetings, the Temple would be entitled
to a 15% commission on the sale of the niches, payable upon collection of sale
price. Indeed, consequent to this finding, I made a finding that the Temple
was entitled to a further sum of $1,000,000 by way of that 15% commission.
There was no evidence of any explicit agreement as to how the $400,000 was to
be dealt with upon this change of the agreement. However I find that it would
be a necessary implication from the altered agreement that the Temple would
have to repay the $400,000 as, under the new agreement, it was to bear the
marketing costs. Therefore I find the Temple liable to refund this $400,000 to
the Partnership.

Priorities

12 In [76] of the Judgment, I had ordered the remaining amounts in the
Partnership Account, after the Temple has been fully paid the sum of $281,200
pursuant to [74] of the Judgment and such expenses as may be assessed by the
Registrar pursuant to [75] of the Judgment, to be distributed as follows:
36.235% to PLD, 52% to Hok Mee and 11.765% to the Temple. However I had not
taken into account the outstanding debts owed by the Partnership to PLD, Hok
Mee as well as Hok Chung. The parties are agreed that PLD had advanced a total
of $13,300,000 to the Partnership, Hok Mee had advanced a total of $5,730,000
and Hok Chung a total of $286,000. Therefore the order in [76] of the Judgment
is to include such payments before any distribution to the Partners. In the
event that there is insufficient funds to repay these three creditors in full,
they rank _pari passu_ as the Joint Venture Agreements do not provide for any
priority of payment.

Hok Mee and Hok Chung are jointly and severally liable for the sum of
$1,572,816.72 in (1). Hok Chung is liable for the sum of $1,955,856.03 in (2).
PLD is liable for the sum of $400,000 in (3)(a). Hok Mee is liable for the sum
of $400,000 in (3)(b). As the corporate veil is lifted in respect of Hok Mee
and Hok Chung, Kek is personally liable to the partnership for $3,928,672.75
comprising the $1,572,816.72 in (1), $1,955,856.03 in (2) and $400,000 in
(3)(b).

C: Monies Due From the Partnership  
---  
(1) |  Loan/Advance from PLD |  $ |  13,300,000  
(2) |  Loan/Advance from Hok Mee |  $ |  5,730,000  
(3) |  Loan/Advance from Hok Chung |  $ |  286,000  
(4) |  Outstanding Management Fees due to Hok Mee |  $ |  2,132,389.41  
|  Total Debt |  $ |  **21,448,389.41**  
  
  

As the total moneys that would be available in the Partnership Account as a
result of the present action is $4,328,672.75 and the total debt owed by the
Partnership is $21,448,389.41, it follows that each creditor is entitled to
recover a rateable proportion for every dollar owed by the Partnership. The
respective sum due to each creditor is as follows:

(1) |  Loan/Advancement from PLD |  $ |  2,684,180.45 |   
---|---|---|---|---  
(2) |  Loan/Advancement from Hok Mee |  $ |  1,156,417.60 |   
(3) |  Loan/Advancement from Hok Chung |  $ |  57,719.97 |   
(4) |  Outstanding Management Fees due to Hok Mee |  $ |  430,354.73 |   
|  **Total** |  $ |  **4,328,672.75** |   
  
  

The computation of the net positions is as follows:

(a) PLD is entitled to set off $400,000 from the sums due from the Partnership
and accordingly is entitled to recover $2,284,180.45 (rounded to $2,284,180)
from the Partnership.

(b) Kek/Hok Mee/Hok Chung owed the Partnership a total sum of $3,928,672.25
but are entitled to be paid a total sum of $1,644,492.30 ($1,156,417.60 +
$57,719.97 + $430,354.73). They are therefore liable to pay the partnership
$2,284,179.95 (rounded to $2,284,180).

D: Monies due to and from the Temple |   
---|---  
Commissions due to the Temple Less |  $ |  1,000,000 |   
(1) Commissions/rebates to NOP withheld by the Temple |  $ |  (722,600) |   
(2) Advance to the Temple for marketing expenses |  $ |  (400,000) |   
(3) Assessed damages in respect of running operating costs to be incurred by the Temple |  $ |  to be assessed |   
|  $ |  (122,600) |   
|  |  |   
  
  

In the event that the assessed damages do not exceed $122,600, the Temple
shall have to pay the net figure to the Partnership.

Orders

14 Kek, Hok Mee and Hok Chung are liable to pay, on the basis of joint and
several liability, the sum of $2,284,180 to the Partnership. As PLD is
entitled to this sum from the Partnership, it follows that Kek, Hok Mee and
Hok Chung ought to pay the sum of $2,284,180 to PLD and I so order.

15 In the event that the damages assessed pursuant to the order in [64] of the
Judgment is less than $122,600, the Temple shall pay such difference to the
Partnership. Parties are at liberty to apply for further orders in relation to
any difference between the assessed damages and the sum of $122,600.

16 In [72] of the Judgment, I had ordered the Temple to pay $54,000 to PLD
being money had and received. The Temple had subsequently paid this sum to its
solicitors as stakeholders and I order it to be paid over to PLD forthwith.

Costs

17 On the question of costs, I note that the plaintiff, PLD, had succeeded in
the bulk of the claims against Hok Mee, Kek and Hok Chung which included
breach of fiduciary duty and the corporate veil was pierced. In my view,
bearing in mind that there was a considerable degree of overlap, the issue of
the partnership dispute took up about two-thirds of the trial and the issue of
overpayments to Hok Chung took up about one-third. I therefore order Hok Mee
and Kek to pay PLD’s costs on the standard basis. I also order Hok Chung to be
jointly and severally liable for one-third of PLD’s costs, in view of the
reduced role of Hok Chung in the suit. I further order Hok Mee and Kek to pay
two-thirds of the costs of the Temple on the standard basis. All costs are to
be taxed unless agreed.
