**JUDGMENT:**

_**Cur Adv Vult**_

1\. The Plaintiffs sued the Defendant for losses they claimed they incurred
through her negligence when she acted for them in connection with a house
known as 70 Hythe Road ("the property").

2\. The Plaintiffs are brothers, and are the registered owners of the
property. The Defendant, an advocate and solicitor of long standing, practises
under the name of Ng & Co. The Plaintiffs’ brother Balakrishnan s/o Kandasamy
@ Mohd Feroz bin Abdullah, who is referred to as "Bala" or "Captain Bala" was
very much involved in the dealings between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant.

3\. The Plaintiffs were the registered owners of the property since 1990 when
they bought it with a $451,000 loan from the Citibank N.A. ("Citibank") and by
withdrawing parts of their earnings from their Central Provident Fund ("CPF")
accounts. The solicitors who acted for the Plaintiffs in these transactions
were Rajah & Tann.

4\. In June 1992 the Citibank loan was paid off and the property was mortgaged
to UMBC Finance Ltd to secure a $475,000 loan. Another law firm Gurdaib Cheong
& Narmal acted for the Plaintiffs at this time.

5\. In December 1992, there was another change of mortgagee. The UMBC Finance
mortgage was discharged and replaced by a mortgage to OCBC Finance Singapore
Ltd ("OCBC Finance") to secure a loan of $485,000. Simultaneously the
Plaintiffs executed a collateral mortgage of the property as sureties for a
loan of $2,880,000 from OCBC Finance to a company Seawell Shipping Management
& Agencies Pte Ltd ("Seawell") for the purchase of the vessel "Seawell
Success". The directors and shareholders of the company were Bala and Yeo
Chong Lin. The Defendant acted for the Plaintiffs and OCBC Finance in these
transactions.

6\. On 27 August 1993, the Plaintiffs executed a second collateral mortgage of
the property in favour of OCBC Finance. The Plaintiffs executed this mortgage
to secure a further loan from OCBC Finance to Seawell for $2,500,000 for the
purchase of another vessel, the "Seawell Sapphire". The Defendant also acted
for the Plaintiffs and OCBC Finance in this mortgage, which was perfected on
26 October 1994 after OCBC Finance paid out the loan in full.

7\. The Plaintiffs and Seawell did not keep up with the scheduled repayments
of the loans, and OCBC Finance pressed the Plaintiffs for payment. The
Plaintiffs were advised that they should sell the property to repay the loans,
or the mortgagees would sell it. On 2 May 1996 the Plaintiffs issued an option
to Yeo Holdings Pte Ltd ("Yeo Holdings") a company controlled by Yeo Chong
Lin, to purchase the property at $2.5 million. The option was exercised on 10
June 1996. The sale was completed on 18 June 1996 simultaneously with the
discharge of the mortgage and collateral mortgages. The Defendant acted for
the Plaintiffs, OCBC Finance and Yeo Holdings in these transactions.

8\. The Plaintiffs did not receive any part of the sale proceeds beyond the
repayment to their CPF accounts the sums they withdrew to purchase the
property with accrued interest because the payment was effected in accordance
to a letter of authority they executed dated 18 June 1996.

9\. They pleaded that

> In breach of her contractual duty and/or negligence, the Defendant failed to
> exercise all proper skill and care, diligence and competence in and about
> the sale and/or conveyance of the said property.
>
> Particulars of Negligence

> (a) Failed to advise and take instructions on the Option and the Letter of
> Authority prepared by the Defendant.
>
> (b) Failed to keep the Plaintiffs informed at all times on the progress of
> the sale of the said property and obtain instructions.
>
> (c) Inducing the Plaintiffs to sign the Transfer in favour of the Purchasers
> without disclosing the balance amount due to them.
>
> (d) Failed to render a completion account for the approval of the Plaintiffs
> before the completion of the sale of the property.
>
> (e) Failed to obtain instructions of the Plaintiffs on the unlawful or
> unauthorised deduction from the sale price of the property.
>
> (f) Failed to advise on the mortgages.
>
> (g) Failed to ensure that no conflict of interest would arise in her duties
> as Solicitors for the Plaintiffs and the Purchasers and Mortgagees.
>
> (h) Failed to ensure that the Plaintiffs’ interest in the purported
> redevelopment of the property was properly protected.
>
> (i) In all circumstances, failing to carry out her work with due skill and
> care.

10\. They quantified their claim at $1,740,294.85 "being the balance of the
sale price of $2.5 million less payment to CPF Board in the sum of
$228,698.34, payment to OCBC Finance $530,800.81 being the Housing Loan, and
$206.00 being the legal costs paid to CPF Solicitors."

__

The Plaintiffs’ case

11\. The Plaintiffs’ case is that they wanted to buy a property for their
home. They were looking for a house of about $400,000, which was what they
could afford. Their brother Bala learnt that the property was available and
persuaded them to buy it although the price was $630,000. Bala promised to
help them get a housing loan, and also to assist them with the mortgage
repayments.

12\. Bala played an active role in the purchase. He made the arrangements with
Citibank, and appointed the solicitors who acted in the purchase.

13\. The Plaintiffs were obliged to make monthly repayments to Citibank. They
intended to do that by making withdrawals from their CPF accounts, by monthly
$800 cash payments they handed to Bala, then Bala would help to top up the
shortfall. The payments Bala made were to be considered as loans which had to
be repaid.

14\. Bala did not sustain his assistance with the mortgage payments and the
Plaintiffs fell behind in the payments. Bala found a solution for the
Plaintiffs. He arranged for them to repay Citibank with a loan from UMBC
Finance. Bala made the arrangements and appointed the solicitors for these
transactions.

15\. The relief was short-lived and soon the Plaintiffs were having
difficulties in servicing the UMBC Finance loan. Bala arranged another change
of lenders, this time to OCBC Finance. This was accomplished on 23 December
1992 when the UMBC Finance mortgage was discharged with the help of a $485,000
loan from OCBC Finance secured on the property. On this occasion Bala also
requested the Plaintiffs to help him obtain a loan for Seawell by offering the
property as security.

16\. The First Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant did not explain to him and
the Second Plaintiff the terms of the mortgage documents they executed or
advise them on their liability and obligations thereunder. The same complaint
was made in respect of the second collateral mortgage they executed
subsequently.

17\. The First Plaintiff referred to an occasion in February 1996 when the
Defendant and Sharon Lee-Tay, Assistant General Manager of OCBC Finance came
to the property. They told him that the shipping loans were not paid, and that
OCBC Finance may sell that property to recover the loans. He told them that he
and the Second Plaintiff could not repay the shipping loans and suggested that
OCBC Finance look to Bala and his associates for payment.

18\. He told Bala about the visit and Bala promised to do something. In May or
June 1996 Bala brought an option for him and the Second Plaintiff to sign.
Bala told them the option was prepared by the Defendant and was for the sale
of the property for $2.5 million to Yeo Holdings. They signed the option and
handed it back to Bala. A few days before the completion Bala saw them again
with a letter of authority. He told them that the letter was needed to allow
repayments to be made to OCBC Finance and the CPF, and they signed the letter.
The First Plaintiff deposed that Bala also told them that after buying the
property,

> … the Purchasers were going to redevelop the property soon after the
> completion of the purchase, and the Purchasers would sell one unit in the
> redevelopment to us.

They signed the letter of authority on the strength of the assurance.

19\. The letter is an important document in these proceedings. It reads

> > Letter of Authority

> To: Yeo Holdings Private Limited  
>  9 Pandan Road  
>  Singapore 609257

> > re: _70 Hythe Road Singapore_

> We, the undersigned Subramaniam s/o Kalimuthu and Kandasamy Ambualagan, the

> OCBC Finance Singapore Limited).
>
> 3\. Central Provident Fund Board **$228,698.34** (refund of CPF withdrawal
> and accrued interest on our two CPF accounts).
>
> 4\. Yeo Holdings Pte Ltd $ (full balance of the proceeds of sale herein to

>
> **

> > (signed)  
>  Subramaniam s/o Kalimuthu
>>

>> (signed)  
>  Kandasamy Ambualagan

> (The words and figures in bold appear in handwriting)

20\. It is the evidence of the First Plaintiff that the handwritten words and
figures were not inserted when the letter of authority was produced for him
and his brother to sign.

21\. Their next dealing with the property was in 18 June when Bala took them
to the Defendant’s office. After they arrived at her office they were taken to
another office to execute a statutory declaration before they were brought
back to the Defendant’s office to execute the transfer instrument.

22\. The First Plaintiff deposed that

> I asked the Defendant about the balance of the purchase price. The Defendant
> then replied that after paying the mortgage loan of OCBC Finance and the
> outstanding of CPF Board, the balance of the purchase price would be kept by
> her in order to pay on our behalf for the semi-detached house to be built on
> the redevelopment of the property by the Purchasers. The Defendant told us
> that Balakrishnan would have told us about the redevelopment and we
> confirmed. The Defendant told the 2nd Plaintiff and me that the Purchasers
> were going to build two semi-detached houses by redeveloping the property,
> and one semi-detached house would be sold to us. We accepted what the
> Defendant had told. The Defendant did not provide any advice on the need to
> have some agreement in writing in order to protect our interest in the
> alleged redevelopment of property.

23\. They did not hear about the transfer again until they received the
Defendant’s letter of 4 July 1996. The letter reads –

> > 4th July 1996

Yeo Chong Lin confirmed that the matters set out in the letter were correct
and that Bala had eventually received $929,800 from the sale.

24\. The Plaintiffs said they glanced through the letter but did not
understand it. They vacated the property in March 1997 without protest.

25\. In March 1998, they went to see the Defendant to enquire about the
redevelopment of the property. The Defendant told them that Bala had received
$929,800 of the sale proceeds.

26\. They were unhappy with the situation and consulted their current lawyers,
Palakrishnan & Partners in April 1998. Palakrishnan & Partners wrote to the
Defendant on 16 November 1998, informing her

> We act for Mr Subramaniam s/o Kalimuthu and Mr Kandasamy Ambualagan, …
>
> We are further instructed by our clients, to categorically and
> unequivocally, deny paragraph 4 of your letter of 4 July 1996, addressed to
> our clients (copy enclosed).
>
> We have been informed, that no instructions whatsoever, were ever given by
> our clients to you, as their Solicitors, authorising you to deduct in
> particular the sum of $948,591.50 mentioned in your said letter.
>
> We are instructed that you have unlawfully, transferred the said sum of
> $948,591.50 to Yeo Holdings Pte Ltd, without any authority whatsoever from
> our clients.
>
> It is our considered opinion, that this sum of monies should have been paid

>
> We hereby do and demand from you, payment of the sum of $948,591.50 with
> interest from date of completion of sale to date of payment within seven (7)
> days from the date hereof.

27\. That remained as the Plaintiffs’ claim till they filed these proceedings
and enlarged the claim.

__

The Defendant’s case

28\. The Defendant’s case is that Bala informed her that although the property
was registered in the name of the Plaintiffs, it belonged to him and she
accepted and acted on this representation.

29\. She did not seek confirmation of that in writing from Bala or the
Plaintiffs. She explained that

> When the Plaintiffs attended before me to execute the Mortgage and
> Collateral Mortgage of the Property in favour of OCBC Finance, they
> confirmed that I was to act for them and that the Property was beneficially
> owned by Captain Bala. They said that the Property belonged to Captain Bala
> and that they would act in accordance with his instructions. Further, all
> correspondence pertaining to the Property was to be sent to Captain Bala. In
> any event, before they signed the Mortgage and Collateral Mortgage, I
> explained the contents and implications to them.

30\. With regard to the sale of the property, the Defendant deposed that

> Sometime before 2 May 1996, Captain Bala told me that he intended to sell
> the Property to settle the debt owing to OCBC Finance and Yeo. He asked me
> to prepare an Option to Purchase the Property and gave instructions to me
> for the preparation of a letter of authority as regards the distribution of
> the sales proceeds. On or before 2 May 1996, I gave him a copy of the Option
> and letter of authority which I had prepared on his instructions.

31\. On 10 June when Yeo Holdings exercised the option, she received the
Plaintiffs’ letter of authority which was signed but undated. She sent it back
to the Plaintiffs with a request for them to date it. At the same time, she
also informed them that she had requested OCBC Finance for a rebate on the
redemption amount. The next day she wrote to them again with a revised letter
with a correction of the figure in item 2 of the letter.

32\. She saw the Plaintiffs again on 18 June when the sale was completed. They
brought back to her the letter of authority in its original form. She inserted
the words in handwriting and added in the date. She explained to them the
transfer and statutory declaration that they executed that day. The sale was
completed that day, with payment made in accordance with the terms of the
letter of authority, and on 4 July she wrote to the Plaintiff, Bala and Yeo
Holdings to report on the completion.

33\. Nothing happened till March 1998 when the Plaintiffs went to her office
and asked her for Bala’s whereabouts and told her that he had absconded, and
had not fulfilled his promise to give them a share of the sale proceeds. She
contacted Yeo Chong Lin and obtained from him Bala’s last-known telephone
number and a copy of his accounts with Bala and gave them to the Plaintiffs.
They returned a few days later because they were unable to contact Bala and
said that they will engage a lawyer to sue Bala. She next heard from them
through Palakrishnan & Partner’s letter.

__

The issues to be determined

34\. At the end of the hearing, I found that the issues to be determined are

> (i) Was the Defendant negligent in acting on Bala’s instructions?
>
> (ii) Was Bala the beneficial owner of the property?
>
> (iii) Did the Defendant explain the mortgages to the Plaintiffs? and
>
> (iv) Had the Defendant handled the sale of the property properly?

__

Was the Defendant negligent in acting on Bala’s instructions?

35\. The Defendant was careless in accepting Bala as the beneficial owner of
the property. Bala’s claim that he was the beneficial owner of the property
was self-serving. The certificate of title did not support his claim as the
Plaintiffs were registered as the proprietors, and there was no caveat lodged
to give notice of his interest. Bala did not support his claim with any deed
of trust in his favour. The Defendant should not act on Bala’s assertion
without getting written instructions from him and the Plaintiffs, and to
ensure that the proper documentation is done.

36\. Her knowledge that the Plaintiffs had used their CPF funds to pay for the
property should have raised doubts whether they were bare legal owners; she
should be aware that the CPF Board would not release CPF monies for the
acquisition of the legal title in a property when the beneficial interest is
vested in another party. Although she did not act for the CPF Board she should
consider these matters when they came to her attention.

37\. In any event, she acted for the OCBC Finance in the mortgage and the two
collateral mortgages. In each of these, the Plaintiffs mortgaged to OCBC
Finance "all the Mortgagor’s registered estate or interest" in the property.
The Plaintiffs were registered as the tenants in common and equal shares in
the certificate of title. That was clearly inconsistent with Bala’s claim that
he was the beneficial owner, yet the Defendant did not bring this to OCBC
Finance’s attention. If Bala’s claim was true, she may have put OCBC Finance
at risk when they made the loans on the assurance of the security offered.

38\. Even if Bala was the sole beneficial owner of the property, the Defendant
should nevertheless take instructions from the Plaintiffs because they were
the legal owners. Bala’s claimed beneficial interest did not entitle him or
her to ignore their legal interests.

39\. There is further basis for criticism. The letter of authority she
prepared on Bala’s instruction referred to "the beneficial owners of the
property" in plural. Her evidence was that she was informed that the
beneficial owners were Bala and his wife. If that was right, it would be
another reason for her not to act on instructions issued by Bala alone.

__

Was Bala the beneficial owner of the property?

40\. This issue is relevant because Bala’s claim may be true even if the
Defendant did not verify it. The Plaintiffs were not Bala’s nominees. They had
invested their CPF monies in the property which became their home. In all the
previous dealings with the property, there was no suggestion that they were
not the beneficial owners.

41\. Having said that, it does not follow that Bala did not have any interest
in the property. Bala was involved with the property from the start. He
persuaded the Plaintiffs to buy it instead of keeping to their budget of
$400,000 and promised to pay for the shortfall from the Plaintiffs’ CPF and
personal contributions. He found the property, negotiated the price, arranged
for the housing loan and engaged the lawyers. He arranged for it to be used as
security for the two shipping loans, and was very much involved in its
eventual sale.

42\. I found the Plaintiffs’ evidence that Bala’s payments or promised
payments were loans difficult to accept. They did not know how much he had
paid or was to pay or how and when they were to repay him. They allowed the
property to be used as security for the shipping loans taken by his company
without any knowledge as to how these loans were going to be repaid.

43\. In additional to that, their account of their payment for the property
was unsatisfactory. They claimed that they made payments by withdrawing from
their CPF accounts, by making cash payments of $800 a month and by relying on
Bala’s assurance. However in reply to the Defendant’s interrogatory on how
they had financed the purchase, their answer was "The Plaintiffs borrowed
money from their Central Provident Fund Account, Citibank N.A. and from
Captain Bala", with no reference to any cash payments from them.

44\. I find on the evidence that Bala may have had some beneficial interest in
the property together with the Plaintiffs.

__

Did the Defendant explain the mortgage to the Plaintiffs?

45\. The Plaintiffs admit that they knew the mortgages were executed to secure
the housing loan and the shipping loans. They also knew that a mortgagee may
take possession of the property and sell it if its loans are not repaid.

46\. They complained that the Defendant had not explained the mortgage terms
to them. The Defendant on the other hand maintained that she had explained the
documents to them.

47\. I considered the evidence. The Plaintiffs’ first complaint in the letter
of Palakrishnan & Partners of 16 November 1998 was significant. This letter
referred to the Defendant’s letter of 4 July 1996. In her letter the Defendant
had referred to a payment to Yeo Holdings for advances made in the repayment
to OCBC Finance of loans in respect of the "Seawell Sapphire" and "Seawell
Success" and with the redemption monies paid to OCBC Finance.

48\. Palakrishnan & Partners stated specifically that the Plaintiffs had not
instructed her to deduct the $948,591.50 of the sale proceeds, and demanded
payment of that sum. The letter is significant for what it did not state. It
did not state that the Defendant had not explained the terms of the mortgages
to the Plaintiffs or that the other deductions were unauthorised or improper.

49\. After receiving their instructions and the reading of the Defendant’s
letter, Palakrishnan & Partners’ considered opinion was that the balance sum
of $948,591.50 should have been paid over to the Plaintiffs.

50\. It must be remembered that the sale was completed on 18 June 1996. The
Plaintiffs were unhappy about not receiving any part of the proceeds when they
went to see the Defendant at her office in March 1998, more than a year and a
half later. They went to consult Palakrishnan & Partners in the following
month, when they had lost faith in the Defendant.

51\. They must have recounted their dealings with the Defendant and showed her
letter of 4 July to their new lawyers. Their lawyers must have explained the
letter to them to get their instructions on the deductions made.

52\. Nevertheless, Palakrishnan & Partners only demanded for the $948,591.50
and did not allege that the mortgages were not explained to the Plaintiffs.
That was the Plaintiffs’ position until the writ was filed on 17 June 1999
with the enlarged claim. In the interim period the letter of 16 November was
not withdrawn or supplemented.

53\. If the Defendant had not explained the mortgages which led to the
deductions, they would have brought that up with their lawyers, and their
lawyers would have raised that in their letter to the Defendant.

54\. I find on the evidence on a balance of probabilities that the Defendant
had explained the terms of the mortgages to the Plaintiffs.

__

Had the Defendant handled the sale of the property properly?

55\. The property was sold to Yeo Holdings through the issuance of the option
on 2 May which was exercised on 10 June, leading to the completion on 18 June.
The Plaintiffs complained that they were not advised about the $1 fee paid for
the option. The consideration for an option is a commercial decision. It can
be $1, $5,000, $10,000 or any sum that may be agreed upon. The Defendant had
no duty to advise the Plaintiffs on it, especially when her advice was not
sought.

56\. Was she right to comply with the letter of authority? As I have pointed
out earlier, when Palakrishnan & Partners wrote to the Defendant they informed
her "(w)e have been informed, that no instructions whatsoever, were given by
our clients to you, as their solicitors, authorising you to deduct in
particular the sum of $948,591.50 mentioned in your said letter" and they
demanded payment of the $948,591.50.

57\. The Plaintiffs signed the letter of authority, and in the letter of 16
November they accepted the accounts rendered in the letter of 4 July except
for the final balance of $948,591.50 after it was explained to them. They
subsequently enlarged the claim when they instituted this action to
$1,740,294.85, as particularised in paragraph 10. It is difficult to
understand the revision. They had not objected before to the $760,000 paid by
Yeo Holdings on Bala’s behalf to discharge the collateral mortgages and the
interest accruing thereon were spelt out in the letter of authority and also
referred to in the Defendant’s letter of 4 July. They also did not explain
their claim that the Defendant refunds the costs for acting for them in the
transactions. Whether the Defendant had acted properly or not they cannot have
the proceeds from the sale without paying legal costs.

58\. I find on the facts that the Plaintiffs’ real complaint was that they did
not receive any part of the final balance of the sale proceeds. The Plaintiffs
claim that they were content not to receive payment when the property was sold
because the Defendant represented to them that she was holding the money for
it to be used to pay for one of the houses to be developed on the property and
sold to them. The Defendant maintained that she had complied with the letter
of authority and had reported on the sale in her letter of 4 July.

59\. The weight of evidence is against the Plaintiffs’ account. They knew very
little of the house they claimed they were buying. The First Plaintiff did not
know how large the house would be, or how many rooms it would have. The Second
Plaintiff only knew that it would be of two storeys, with 4-plus-1 rooms.
Neither knew the price they were to pay for the house because the price was to
be fixed after the house is constructed. Both Plaintiffs acknowledged that
there was no commitment to buy, and both said they would not buy if they could
not afford the price. That was consonant with Yeo Chong Lin’s undisputed
evidence that "Bala and I had never discussed that one of the semi-detached
houses was to be sold to the Plaintiffs".

60\. It was improbable that the Defendant would have told the Plaintiffs that
she was holding money for them for the payment of the house when there was no
agreement to buy and no money was received or held by her except the legal
costs. The Defendant would be quite irrational to make that representation on
18 June, then contradict herself with the letter three weeks later.

61\. I find that the Defendant had completed the sale properly in accordance
to the Plaintiffs’ letter of authority of 18 June as reported in her letter of
4 July.

Conclusion

62\. Although I find that the Defendant was wrong to act on Bala’s
instructions without verification, and that Bala was not the sole beneficial
owner of the property that she accepted him to be, she had explained the
mortgages to the Plaintiffs, acted in accordance with the letter of authority
and accounted for the proceeds of the sale.

63\. In the circumstances, I dismiss the Plaintiffs’ claim. On the question of
costs, I feel that the Defendant should not be awarded the full costs of the
action because her conduct in the transactions relating to the property was
certainly not beyond criticism. She did not discharge her duties properly in
accepting Bala’s assertion without verification and in failing to report to
OCBC Finance Bala’s instructions and her belief that the Plaintiffs were the
bare legal owners of the property. She should receive half the costs of the
action instead.
