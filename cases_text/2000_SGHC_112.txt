**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

_

The parties

_

1\. The plaintiffs STL Machinery Pte Ltd are the owners of 2 units of crawler
cranes and 8 units of tower cranes which they wanted to ship to Manila,
Philippines to a company known as Singapino Corporation.

2\. The defendants Hai Leck Marine Contractor Pte Ltd are a shipping company
which arranges the shipment of cargo for their customers.

3\. The plaintiffs enquired with several shipping companies on the shipment of
the cranes before narrowing their negotiations to the defendants. Eventually a
contract was entered between them on 29 July 1999.

4\. The terms of the agreement on which the action turns relate to the terms
on the cargo and freight. The former was described as "2 x 35 ton Crawler
Crane & 8 x Tower Crane (as per your Packing List – approx.1700 m3)." The
latter was stated as "Lumpsum US$51,000/- Liner Term (Door/Port)."

__

The difficulties arising

5\. The cranes were transported from the plaintiffs’ yard to the port by 3
August 1999. The plaintiffs prepared a packing list dated 2 August for their
internal records, giving the measurement of the cranes as 2,261.14 cubic
metres.

6\. The cranes were loaded on the vessel MV Royal Progress on 6 August, upon
which a bill of lading was issued naming Singapino Corporation as the
consignee.

7\. After the vessel arrived at Manila on 14 August the defendants failed to
release the cranes to the consignee because of a dispute over the measurement
of the cranes, and the defendants’ non-payment of the freight to the
shipowners.

8\. The defendants had declared the measurement of the cranes as 1400 cubic
metres, whereas the master found it to be about 4000 cubic metres. The
shipowners ceased discharging the cargo on 15 August and exercised their lien
on the approximately one-third of the cargo that was still on the vessel.

9\. To resolve the impasse and to get possession of the cranes, the consignee
negotiated directly with the shipowners and secured the release upon a payment
of US$37,596.75. Subsequently they made a claim on the plaintiffs for

> (i) | Loss of Use of the cargo | US$125,000.00 | = S$210,000.00  
> ---|---|---|---  
> (ii) | Payment made to secure the release of the cargo | US$37,596.75 | = S$63,162.54  
> (iii) | Additional storage charges | US$16,710.93 | = S$28,074.36  
> (iv) | Overtime charges to discharge the cargo | US$142.59 | = S$239.55  
  
_

_The dispute over measurement_

10\. The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs misrepresented the total
volume of the cranes to be about 1400 cubic metres, and that the volume was
stated as 1700 cubic metres in the contract to give the plaintiffs a margin of
safety.

11\. When they made their own measurement before loading on 4 August they
found the total volume to be approximately 3077 cubic metres.

12\. The defendants also relied on the report of a survey carried out by
surveyors appointed by the consignee in Manila, which showed the volume as
3,323.23 cubic metres. The plaintiffs denied that they were guilty of
misrepresentation, and contended that freight was agreed on a lumpsum basis.

__

The dispute over the disclosure of the consignee and the lease

13\. The plaintiffs asserted that they had informed the defendants that the
cranes were being leased to Singapino Corporation. The defendants, on the
other hand, alleged that they were not informed of the lease or the identity
of the consignee before the commencement of the legal proceedings.

14\. The documents exhibited by the plaintiffs contradicted the defendants’
denial of knowledge of the consignee. The bill of lading for the shipment
named Singapino Corporation as the consignee and a letter from the plaintiffs
to the defendants dated 19 August specifically referred to Singapino
Corporation as the consignee.

_

The plaintiffs’ claims

_

15\. The plaintiffs asserted that they had paid the consignee the sums in
items (ii), (iii) and (iv) in paragraph 9 and that they were in the process of
making payment of the sum under item (i). They also added a further item for
$3,258.78 which they claimed they had incurred on their own as administrative,
travelling and accommodation expenses arising out of the delayed release of
the cranes.

16\. They claimed against the defendants (i) a declaration that they were
entitled to be indemnified by the defendants against their liability to the
consignee, (ii) an indemnity in the sum of $301,476.43 (the full amount
claimed by the consignee), (iii) damages in the sum of $3,258.78, or
alternatively damages to be assessed, (iv) interest and (v) costs.

__

The Assistant Registrar’s decision

17\. The plaintiffs applied for summary judgment on their action. This came on
for hearing before an Assistant Registrar. After hearing counsel the Assistant
Registrar gave judgment to the plaintiffs in terms of prayers (i) to (v) of
the plaintiffs’ claims without specifying whether the damages were fixed at
$3,258.78 or were to be assessed.

18\. The defendants appealed against the whole of the Assistant Registrar’s
judgment.

_

The issues raised before me

_

19\. In the appeal counsel for the defendants submitted that

> Defendants’ case is that (i) _Plaintiffs misrepresented the volume of cargo_
> to the Defendants prior to the execution of the contract, and that relying
> on the volume as represented by Plaintiffs, Defendants informed the
> carrier/shipowner of that volume. Upon discharge, (ii) _the carrier_
> discovered that the true volume was much greater than that told to them and
> _exercised a lien on the cargo_. (iii) _The Plaintiffs were also_ _late in
> their payment of freight_. (Emphasis and numbering added)

__

Examination of the issues raised

20\. There were three issues raised – misrepresentation, lien and late payment
of freight.

21\. On the issue of misrepresentation, the defendants claim to have
discovered the misrepresentation before the cranes were loaded. They did not
rescind the contract, and continued with it. In these circumstances, even if
there was a misrepresentation, the contract continued to subsist and the
defendants were bound by their covenant to discharge the cranes to the
consignee.

22\. On the lien issue, the shipowner had exercised its lien because no
freight payments were made to them. The defendants had misstated that the lien
was exercised for non-payment of the excess freight payable on the excess
volume. The defendants’ reliance on the lien was unfounded because it was
their duty to pay freight to he shipowner. While the lien resulted in their
inability to release the cranes to the consignee, it did not displace their
obligation to release the cranes or excuse the non-compliance.

23\. On the late payment of freight, while it was not disputed that the
plaintiffs were late when they tendered the freight payment to the defendants,
the defendants loaded and shipped the cranes and accepted the late payment. In
these circumstances, the late payment did not justify their failure to release
the cranes.

__

My decision

24\. The defences raised did not excuse the defendants from their obligation
to deliver the cargo to the consignee, and the plaintiffs are entitled to
redress.

25\. The plaintiffs are entitled to the indemnity they sought. What they can
recover under the indemnity, however, must be proved. Similarly, while the
plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for losses incurred by them, the
losses must be proved. I therefore varied the Assistant Registrar’s orders so
that the amount recoverable under the indemnity and the damages recoverable
are to be assessed, and I also made it clear that the orders shall not prevent
the defendants from taking out a separate action against the plaintiffs on the
alleged misrepresentation on the measurement of the cargo, or for additional
freight.
