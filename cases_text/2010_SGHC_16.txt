Introduction

1 This was an appeal by Ozone Community Corporation (“Ozone”), a company
incorporated and existing under the laws of Japan, against the decision of the
Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks (the “PAR”) in _Advance Magazine
Publishers Inc. v Ozone Community Corporation_ [2009] SGIPOS 4. Ozone had
applied to register the trade mark, “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” (_ie_ , a word mark),
in Class 16 (Trade Mark Application No T02/03173J), in respect of the
following goods (“Ozone’s goods”):

Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of
paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;
paper patterns; tailors’ chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;
banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags; printed matter; paintings and
calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands; playing cards; stationery
and study materials.

2 The application was opposed by Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. (“AMP”), a
company incorporated and existing under the laws of New York, United States of
America. AMP is the registered proprietor of the following prior marks in
Singapore:

Registration No |  Mark |  Class |  Specification of Goods/Services  
---|---|---|---  
T98/02808F |  “GLAMOUR” |  9 |  CD-ROMS; compact discs; prerecorded audio and video cassettes; electronic publications; computer software and optical apparatus and equipment  
T95/08527E |  “GLAMOUR” |  16 |  Magazines, books and publications (“AMP’s goods”)  
T00/13663B |  “GLAMOUR” |  35 |  Advertising and promotion services and information services relating thereto; business information services; all provided on-line from a computer database or a global communication network; compilation of advertisements for use as web pages on a global communication network; retail services in the fields of fashion, beauty, travel and architecture; retail store services in the fields of fashion, beauty, travel and architecture, available through computer communications, interactive television, satellite and wireless means  
T00/13664J |  “GLAMOUR” |  41 |  Information relating to entertainment or education, provided on-line from a computer database or a global communications network; electronic games services provided by means of a global communications network; providing on-line electronic publications [not downloadable]; publication of electronic books and journals on-line; entertainment in the nature of an on-going television program in the field of fashion, beauty, travel and architectural information  
T00/13665I |  “GLAMOUR” |  42 |  Computer rental; design, drawing and commissioned writing, all for compilation of web pages on a global communications network; information (only information under Class 42) provided on-line from a computer database or from a global communication network; creating and maintaining web sites; hosting the web sites of others; installation and maintenance of computer software; leasing access time to a computer database (other than by Internet service providers); providing fashion, beauty, architectural information distributed over television, satellite, wireless and global communications networks  
  
  

3 Before the PAR, AMP based its opposition on the following grounds:

(a) section 8(2)(_b_) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1999 Rev Ed) (“TMA”);

(b) section 8(3) TMA; and

(c) section 8(4) TMA.

AMP’s opposition under ss 8(3) and 8(4) TMA _failed_ but its opposition
_succeeded_ under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA.

4 In allowing AMP’s opposition to _succeed_ under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA, the PAR
found that there was a “likelihood of confusion” between Ozone’s “HYSTERIC
GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark in Class 16 covering “Magazines, books
and publications” (_ie_ , the second entry in the table at [2] above), see
[79] of the PAR’s Grounds of Decision (“GD”).

5 In Ozone’s appeal before me, only two grounds were canvassed by the parties,
_viz_ , ss 8(2)(_b_) and 8(4) TMA. Counsel for AMP confirmed that AMP was not
relying on s 8(3) TMA.

6 After hearing the parties’ oral submissions and considering their written
submissions, I reversed the decision of the PAR and allowed Ozone’s Trade Mark
Application No T02/03173J for the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark in Class 16 to
proceed to registration (see [1] above). I now give the reasons for my
decision. To facilitate understanding, I have set out the schematic
arrangement of the contents herein as follows:

Background facts

Facts pertaining to AMP

7 With respect to AMP, the PAR set out the following background facts at
[11]–[17] of his GD:

**_[AMP’s] Evidence_**

11 [AMP’s] only statutory declaration was declared on 24th August 2005 in the
United State [_sic_] of America by Mr. John W. Bellando, the Vice President of
[AMP] since 1 January 2000. [AMP states] that the first issue of GLAMOUR
magazine had been published more than 60 years ago in May 1941. Since then
[AMP states] that the GLAMOUR magazine has been devoted to the reporting and
portraying [of], among other things, women’s fashion, beauty, careers,
relationships, sex/health, women’s issues, travel, food, home decorating,
cars, audio, film and more, all directed towards the contemporary working
woman.

12 [AMP states] that [it has] secured registrations or [has] pending
registrations of the GLAMOUR mark in more than 100 countries. There are some
copies of some of the Certificates of Registration attached to the statutory
declaration. There is also a table listing the countries in which the GLAMOUR
mark has been registered or is pending registration. It should be noted that
the number of Certificates of Registration do not match the number of
countries where the GLAMOUR mark is listed as registered. I note that [AMP
has] made assertions that sought to prove that [AMP has] worldwide reputation.
However, to support such an important fact, [it has] only submitted sample
copies of the Certificates of Registration in the various countries where [it]
had claimed the reputation exists. The list of countries includes 94
countries, whereas the exhibits to the statutory declaration only show copies
of Certificates of Registration from 43 countries. This is only as far as I
can tell; the next issue that I have with the evidence is that most of it
comes without a certified translation. Since the certificates come from all
over the world, I am presented with a vast array of languages that I am afraid
I do not have the faculty to master. Where this is the case, the Certificate
of Registration shall do nothing more to substantiate the assertions of [AMP]
than if there was no copy submitted at all. It is truly a pity that, for a
fact that is as crucial as the completeness of the worldwide reputation, there
is only partial substantiation of the assertions of [AMP]. That is not to say
that the statement by Mr. Bellando is of no weight; it was made under oath and
the penalties of being found to be untruthful while under oath strongly
discourage any untruthful statements. However, the case for the worldwide
reputation could have been made much stronger had all the Certificates of
Registration been presented, and accompanied by the certified translation of
the certificate. I have some understanding of the difficulty that counsel
faces when asking for and obtaining this information, but parties who present
a bare statement of worldwide reputation without anything more will risk
facing significant challenges on their statement, or at least and have their
statements bear much less weight.

13 [AMP states] that [its] GLAMOUR magazine is sold and distributed in many
countries worldwide. The total global circulation has amounted to at least
2,376,096 copies per month (based on the average circulation figure for
September 2002). [AMP tenders] into evidence a table of countries where the
GLAMOUR magazine is presently distributed and sold.

14 In terms of domestic sales, [AMP states] that [it] first commenced use of
the GLAMOUR mark from at least as early as September 1984. They provide the
circulation numbers for Singapore for the years 1990-2002:

Year |  Distribution (copies) |  Year |  Distribution (copies)  
---|---|---|---  
1990 |  567 |  1997 |  780  
1991 |  389 |  1998 |  642  
1992 |  427 |  1999 |  916  
1993 |  621 |  2000 |  972  
1994 |  795 |  2001 |  823  
1995 |  720 |  2002 |  903  
1996 |  727 |  |   
  
  

The numeric value of these figures was not challenged by [Ozone].

15 [AMP states] that the magazine has won more than 59 major magazine awards
since 1990 and reaches over 12 million readers each month internationally. The
magazine also outsells more than 98% of all magazines on the newsstands. The
GLAMOUR mark is also world famous by way of the GLAMOUR websites that are
accessible worldwide. By virtue of this extremely substantial and extensive
use of the GLAMOUR mark, the mark has become distinctive of the Opponents both
in Singapore and globally.

16 There were no advertising and promotion figures submitted into evidence.

17 [AMP] did not tender a second statutory declaration.

Facts pertaining to Ozone

8 With respect to Ozone, the following background facts were set out at
[18]–[23] of the GD:

**_[Ozone’s] Evidence_**

18 [Ozone’s] evidence comes by way of a statutory declaration declared in
Japan on 5th December 2006 by Mr Noriyuki Yamagani. He states that he is a
brand manager of [Ozone] and has been for the past 19 years.

19 [Ozone is] a company based in Japan focused on the design and retailing of
fashion apparel and accessories for both men and women. [Ozone is] the
registered [proprietor] of the trade mark HYSTERIC GLAMOUR in Japan, United
Kingdom, United State[s] of America, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea.
The Certificates of Registration and the certified copies of translation of
certificates not in English were duly presented as evidence of their goodwill
and reputation. In particular, [Ozone refers] to the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark in
the UK in Class 16 covering **_“Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging
containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of
paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailor’s chalk; table cloths of
paper; blinds of paper; banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags;
printed matter; paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph
stands; playing cards; stationery and study materials”_**. [Ozone highlights]
that this Class 16 mark co-exists on the UK register with [AMP’s] GLAMOUR mark
in the UK. [emphasis in original]

20 [Ozone] had invented the mark HYSTERIC GLAMOUR for use in connection with
fashion apparel. [Ozone] had subsequently used the mark in Japan since 1984 on
clothing, bags, footwear and fashion accessories. [Ozone] tendered evidence of
advertisements in Japanese magazines as well as extracts from [its] company
website as evidence of the fashion style of the products sold.

21 [Ozone asserts] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has become extremely famous
as a fashion clothes label in Japan. [Ozone submits] that a travel listing in
the website Yahoo! Travel Listing as well as the list of HYSTERIC GLAMOUR
retail stores located throughout Japan point to a significant reputation built
by [Ozone] since 1984.

22 [Ozone claims] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has in recent years gained a
business presence in countries apart from Japan. HYSTERIC GLAMOUR stores have
been set up in Hong Kong and in the United States of America. [Ozone asserts]
that [it has] two stores in Hong Kong and 25 stores in the US. I note that, on
a careful examination of the exhibits before me, that the stores that [Ozone
claims] are the stores outside of Japan, are actually more likely to be stores
belonging to other franchises that merely carry HYSTERIC GLAMOUR goods.

23 [Ozone’s] goods bearing the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark have yet to be sold or
advertised in Singapore. There are no figures pertaining to sales and
advertisements in Singapore.

The decision of the PAR

9 As ss 8(2)(_b_) and 8(4) TMA were raised in this appeal before me (see [5]
above), I shall set out the PAR’s findings _vis-à-vis_ these two sections
only.

The PAR’s findings with respect to s 8(2)(b) TMA

10 Section 8(2)(_b_) TMA states:

**Relative grounds for refusal of registration**

**8**. —(1)…

(2) A trade mark shall not be registered if because —

…

(_b_) it is similar to an earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods
or services identical with or similar to those for which the earlier trade
mark is protected,

there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.

11 With respect to AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA, the PAR observed
(at [62] of the GD) that AMP had the burden of proving that the following
criteria were satisfied:

(a) that AMP had earlier trade mark registrations as defined in s 2 TMA;

(b) that Ozone’s mark (_viz_ , “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”) and AMP’s earlier trade
marks (_viz_ , “GLAMOUR”) were similar;

(c) that the goods of Ozone’s mark (_viz_ , “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”) and AMP’s
earlier trade marks (_viz_ , “GLAMOUR”) were identical or similar; and

(d) there was a likelihood of confusion by virtue of the similarity of the
marks and the goods.

12 The several earlier trade mark registrations in favour of AMP (see [2]
above) were not disputed by Ozone (see [64] of the GD). The PAR considered
whether Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark were
“similar” within the meaning of s 8(2)(_b_) TMA. As correctly noted by the
PAR, there are three aspects to similarity, _viz_ , visual similarity, aural
or phonetic similarity, and conceptual similarity.

Similarity of marks

(1) Visual similarity

13 The PAR found that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark
were visually _dissimilar_ on a simple visual analysis and that there was no
dominant element in either of the word marks:

68 I have been assaulted [_sic_] with diametrically opposed arguments on which
element is the dominant element. But while [AMP tried] valiantly to deflect
attention from the visual aspects by advancing [its] argument that the
dominant element is GLAMOUR, and [AMP] advance[d] equally trying arguments
that the element HYSTERIC is not overshadowed, the simple analysis in visual
similarity is merely to look at the marks. In this case, there are many visual
differences between the marks. The HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has 15 letters,
GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has two words, the GLAMOUR
mark has one. I do not think that the language represented by the letters is
so unusual or descriptive that there should be any dominant element. I am of
the opinion that the marks are visually dissimilar. …

(2) Aural or phonetic similarity

14 The PAR also found that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
mark were aurally _dissimilar_ :

69 I still cannot help but find that a simple analysis is all that is required
of the test of aural similarity. The simple analysis here is that the complete
sound of [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark is different from [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR]
mark. The simple facts are that [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark is made up of
five readable syllables in two words with a pause in between, whereas [AMP’s
GLAMOUR] mark is two syllables in one word. Three of the syllables in [Ozone’s
HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark are not duplicated as sounds in [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark.
This basic analysis shows that there is a fair bit of dissimilarity between
the two marks in terms of syntax. The question is whether the repetition of
two common syllables that form a common word ‘glamour’ will cause these two
marks, as a whole, to be considered as aurally similar. My answer is no, and
here again I do not think that [_Matratzen Concord GMBH v OHIM, Case T-6/01,
Judgment of the Court of First Instance (fourth Chamber)_] can apply to swing
the decision the other way. The case of Matratzen decided (at para XLIII)
that, as between the elements ‘Matratzen’ and ‘Concord’, the element Matratzen
was an invented word with hard to pronounce consonants and appeared more
likely to be remembered by the public. I do not have this distinction before
me in the present case, I only have before me the words HYSTERIC and GLAMOUR,
and I am hard pressed to say that one is more pronounceable than the other so
much so that the public is more likely to remember it. Consequently, and
bearing in mind my earlier basic analysis of the two marks, I am of the
opinion that the marks are aurally dissimilar.

(3) Conceptual similarity

15 Having found that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark
were visually _and_ aurally _dissimilar_ , the PAR then found that the words
marks were however conceptually _similar_ :

70 The area of conceptual similarity is the hardest element to determine in
this case. The [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark and [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark both
bear the word GLAMOUR. The crux of the decision lies in whether the word
GLAMOUR has been modified by the term HYSTERIC. I note the arguments from both
sides relating to the [_sic_] whether I should treat the word HYSTERIC as
distinctive or laudatory. I am of the opinion that the word HYSTERIC does not
modify the word GLAMOUR in a similar way as the…case [in _Itochu Corporation v
Worldwide Brands Inc_ [2007] SGIPOS 9]. The word HYSTERIC does modify the
concept of GLAMOUR in a way that is described by [Ozone at [51] above] to a
certain point. However, the main concept is still ‘glamour’. The concept has
not been completely reversed, as it has been in [_Itochu Corporation v
Worldwide Brands Inc_ [2007] SGIPOS 9], where the ruggedness of the Camel
concept was essentially reversed by the addition of the prefix ‘sweet’. In
this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark still relies on the concept that they are
‘glamorous’, albeit injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically
glamorous’. From another point of view this should still hold true; [Ozone’s
concept] cannot be that the clothes do not look glamorous at all, otherwise it
would frustrate the purpose of their mark, which is to sell designed clothes
at a premium price.

71 I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is in some way conceptually
similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark
appeals to [the] orthodox meaning of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a
spin to it but still is based on ‘glamour’. ...

16 On the basis of such conceptual similarity _alone_ , the PAR concluded that
Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark, though visually and
aurally dissimilar, were nevertheless “similar” within the meaning of s
8(2)(_b_) TMA. The PAR then proceeded to consider whether the goods bearing
Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark were “similar”.

Similarity of goods

17 The PAR found that there was similarity in respect of _only_ the Class 16
goods specified by Ozone (_ie_ , Ozone’s goods: see [1] above) and AMP (_ie_ ,
AMP’s goods: see [2] above):

73 … In relation to [AMP’s] goods in Classes 9, 35, 41 and 42, there is no
similarity in terms of the goods. In relation to [AMP’s] Class 16 goods,
[Ozone] conceded that there may be an overlap with the goods that they are
applying for. Even without this concession, it is clear to me that the scope
of [AMP’s] description of goods (**_“Magazines, books and publications”_**) is
clearly a sub-set of [Ozone’s goods](in particular the mention of **__“printed
matter”__** in the description of [Ozone’s] goods). There does not seem to be
a need to decide along the lines of the…factors [set out in _British Sugar PLC
v James Robertson & Sons Ltd_ [1996] RPC 281]. [emphasis in original]

Likelihood of confusion

18 The PAR then considered whether there was a likelihood of confusion on the
part of the public in respect of AMP’s and Ozone’s Class 16 goods. He noted at
[74] of the GD, referring to [66] of the Court of Appeal’s decision in
_McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd_ [2005] 1 SLR 177 (“ _McDonald’s
(CA)_ ”) that:

The lack of similarity as between the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark and the GLAMOUR
mark is only one factor in the determination of the likelihood of confusion,
since the element of likelihood of confusion takes into account a lot more
than just the similarity of marks and of the goods. …

19 Following that, the PAR identified the relevant segment of the public to be
“the entire group of women who read magazines for leisure and [who] are
fashion conscious”. As Ozone had “not submitted very much on the intended use
of the goods other than the specifications” (see [76] of the GD), the PAR
considered notional use by Ozone of the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in assessing
the likelihood of confusion. In this aspect, the PAR noted that given the
similarity of goods (see [17] above) and because it was “reasonable to
speculate” (since Ozone had not submitted any evidence of the actual or
intended use of its goods) that any use by Ozone of the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”
mark would not fall far from their core business of “design and retailing of
fashion apparel and accessories for both men and women”, this “may result in a
situation where both the marks will be used on similar goods”. The PAR
rejected AMP’s submission that the public would see Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”
mark as a subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark purely by the
application of the conceptually similar marks onto similar goods and was of
the view that there was no calculated attempt to deceive because Ozone’s and
AMP’s “advertising retain their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy
each other’s style” (see [78] of the GD). Nevertheless, the PAR concluded at
[79] of the GD:

79 Having considered all the above factors, I believe that there is a
likelihood of confusion on the part of the relevant public, in this case the
members of the public who are female who read magazines for leisure and are
fashion conscious. Although there are some differences between the [AMP’s
“GLAMOUR”] mark and [Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”] mark in terms of visual and
aural similarity, there are similarities in concept. This similarity could
give rise to a likelihood of confusion in the relevant segment of the public
if the marks were affixed on similar goods, especially since [Ozone’s and
AMP’s businesses] overlap. Where this is the case, this ground of opposition
will succeed as all the essential elements of Section 8(2) [TMA] are made out.

The PAR’s findings with respect to passing off under s 8(4) TMA

20 Section 8(4) TMA states:

(4) A trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in
Singapore is liable to be prevented —

(_a_) by virtue of any rule of law (in particular, the law of passing off)
protecting an unregistered trade mark or other sign used in the course of
trade; or

(_b_) by virtue of an earlier right other than those referred to in
subsections (1), (2) and (3) or paragraph (_a_), in particular by virtue of
the law of copyright or any law with regard to the protection of designs.

21 Under this section, the PAR first observed, at [96] of the GD, that to
succeed in an action for passing off under s 8(4) TMA, AMP had to satisfy
three criteria, _viz_ , that:

(a) AMP’s goods and services had acquired a goodwill or reputation in the
market and are known by some distinguishing feature;

(b) there was a misrepresentation by Ozone (whether or not intentional)
leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered
by Ozone were goods or services of AMP; and

(c) AMP had suffered or was likely to suffer damage as a result of the
erroneous belief engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation.

Goodwill or reputation

22 With regard to the first element of goodwill or reputation, the PAR
observed that although AMP claimed that its use of the “GLAMOUR” mark in
Singapore started from 1984, apart from a table and random invoices that did
not date beyond the year 2000, there was no “good evidence” that AMP’s
magazine started selling in Singapore from 1984. The PAR also noted that the
highest circulation of AMP’s magazine at 903 copies in Singapore was
unimpressive and was a “number that [was] disproportionately low for the
population of Singapore that [was] around 3 million at that time” (see [88] of
the GD). The PAR then concluded that the circulation numbers however indicated
that AMP had “some goodwill and reputation in Singapore”. Since the further
point as to whether the goodwill rested in AMP or the distributor of its
magazine was not argued before the PAR, he concluded that the goodwill should
belong to AMP in the absence of any challenge (see [98] of the GD).

Misrepresentation

23 On misrepresentation, the PAR noted that the mere fact that a likelihood of
confusion was found under s 8(2) TMA (see [18]–[19] above) did not
automatically lead to the finding that there would be misrepresentation under
passing off (see [99] of the GD); the element of misrepresentation “require[d]
more than just a likelihood of confusion in the sense understood under trade
mark law” (see [100] of the GD). Relying on his earlier observation (see [19]
above) that there was no evidence that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was a
subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark and that Ozone’s and AMP’s
advertising retained their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy each
other’s style, the PAR concluded that:

101 … This evidence also goes to show that there is clearly no
misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt [by Ozone to try] to mislead or
deceive the public as to the origin of the goods.

Damage

24 Having found that the second criteria of “misrepresentation” was not made
out (see [23] above), the PAR then considered it “natural that there cannot be
any case to damage that has occurred or that is likely to occur” (see [102] of
the GD). However, the PAR also considered the alternative position where
“confusing similarity” under s 8(2) TMA may be seen as a misrepresentation. In
this aspect, he noted that he was unconvinced by AMP’s argument that its
magazine was a “class publication” to prove damage:

103 … I am unconvinced that the mere mention [of or] association with [Ozone’s
business] will bring about the ‘devastating’ damage that [AMP claims] will
happen. The use of tattooed individuals and of vulgar words on a T-shirt
design that will appear on the pages or cover of another magazine is too
remote a cause that can be linked to the damage in the goodwill of [AMP’s]
GLAMOUR magazine.

104 Further, I would think that advertisers are only likely to leave the
magazine if the magazine itself is falling from being a ‘class publication’,
and that is only if the magazine carrying the advertisements themselves are
actively carrying out actions (to use the quoted examples, using heavily
tattooed models and vulgar words) that will cause the magazine to be seen as a
publication that is not a class publication. To say that advertisers will
remove advertisements from one magazine because of the association of that one
magazine with another offending publication, or because of the association of
that one magazine with an offending entity is a tenuous argument, especially
since the advertisers’ advertisement does not come anywhere near the offending
publication.

105 In any event, I note that the ‘class publication’ principle originated
from [AMP’s] own literature. There are also no other proofs of damage that
were tendered before me.

25 Accordingly, the PAR concluded that because the elements of passing off
were not made out, AMP’s ground of opposition under s 8(4) TMA failed.

26 Having set out the grounds for the PAR’s decision, I now proceed to
summarise the parties’ main contentions in the appeal before me (see [27]–[28]
below), before elaborating further on the parties’ arguments in my decision
below.

Ozone’s arguments on appeal

27 Ozone raised five arguments to contend that the PAR had erred in holding
that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was “confusingly similar” to Ozone’s
“GLAMOUR” mark pursuant to s 8(2)(_b_) TMA (see [10]–[19] above), _viz_ , that
the PAR had erred in:

(a) finding that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was conceptually similar to
Ozone’s “GLAMOUR” mark (see [15] above);

(b) finding that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was “similar” to Ozone’s
“GLAMOUR” mark on the basis of conceptual similarity _alone_ ;

(c) not considering the lack of distinctiveness of AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR”
mark (see [64] below);

(d) finding that Ozone’s goods, _excluding_ “printed matter” (_viz_ , “paper
and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of paper;
table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper
patterns; tailors’ chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners of
paper; flags of paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic works;
photographs, photographs stands; playing cards; stationery and study
materials”) were similar to AMP’s goods (_viz_ , “magazines books and
publications”) ( see [17] above); and

(e) finding that there was a likelihood of confusion between its “HYSTERIC
GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark (see [18]–[19] above).

AMP’s arguments on appeal

28 On its end, AMP submitted that the PAR had not erred except in three
respects, _viz_ , that the PAR had erred in holding that:

(a) its “GLAMOUR” mark was not _visually_ similar to Ozone’s ”HYSTERIC
GLAMOUR” mark (see [13] above);

(b) its “GLAMOUR” word mark was not _aurally_ similar to Ozone’s ”HYSTERIC
GLAMOUR” word mark (see [14] above); and

(c) the law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the “HYSTERIC
GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA (see [20] –[25] above).

The decision of this court

29 As stated above at [5], the parties’ contentions before me related only to
the PAR’s decision on the applicability of ss 8(2)(_b_) and 8(4) TMA. Before
elaborating on the law and the parties’ respective arguments, it would be
useful to first examine the standard of review applicable in the present
proceedings.

The role of an appellate tribunal

30 In _Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v McDonald’s Corp_ [2007] 2 SLR 845 (“
_Future Enterprises_ ”), the Court of Appeal was of the view that appeals from
a decision of the PAR “are not in the nature of a rehearing” and the PAR’s
findings of fact should be disturbed only where there is a “material error in
principle”, _ie_ , a “significant departure from a proper assessment of the
law or the facts” (see [5]–[7] of _Future Enterprises_):

5 … having regard to the general principles applicable to appeals against
findings of fact in trade mark applications, we see no reason why we should
disturb the dual findings of fact by the PAR and the trial judge of similarity
and likelihood of confusion between the two word marks “MacCoffee” and
“McCAFÉ”. In _Reef Trade Mark_ [2003] RPC 5, Robert Walker LJ considered the
function of an appellate tribunal in relation to appeals from the UK Trade
Mark Registry, and concluded (at [28]) that _“an appellate court should … show
a real reluctance, but not the very highest degree of reluctance, to interfere
in the absence of a distinct and material error of principle”_. In _SC Prodal
94 SRL v Spirits International NV_ [2003] EWHC 2756 (Ch), Laddie J expressed
the same sentiments (at [19]) as follows:

It is not the duty of this court to overturn a decision of the Trade Mark
Registry simply because it comes to the conclusion that it might have decided
the case differently had it, that is to say the High Court, been the court of
first instance. _It has to be demonstrated that the decision at first instance
was wrong in a material way; that is to say there must be some significant
departure from a proper assessment of the law or the facts_.

6 This prudent approach has been unequivocally endorsed in the recent case of
_Sunrider Corporation v Vitasoy International Holdings Ltd_ [2007] EWHC 37
(Ch) (at [10]). _Such an approach is consistent with established principles
relating to appeals from tribunals that are not in the nature of a rehearing,
such as an appeal from a decision of the PAR_.

7 … _In the light of the highly subjective nature of assessing similarity and
the likelihood of confusion, we agree with the approach that an appellate
court should not disturb the findings of fact of a trade mark tribunal unless
there is a material error of principle_.

[emphasis added]

31 The abovementioned approach in _Future Enterprises_ , _viz_ , that appeals
from a decision of the PAR “are not in the nature of a rehearing,” however,
differs from that stated in O 87 r 4(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5,
2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), which applies to appeals against the decision of the
Registrar of Trade Marks pursuant to s 75(2)(_a_) TMA. Counsel for both AMP
and Ozone confirmed that the present application before me was made pursuant
to s 75(2)(_a_) TMA read with O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC. The latter provision
states as follows:

**ORDER 87**

**TRADE MARKS ACT**

…

**Appeals (O. 87, r. 4)**

**4**. —(1)…

(2)  _An appeal shall be by way of rehearing_ and the evidence used on appeal
shall be the same as that used before the Registrar and, except with the leave
of the Court, no further evidence shall be given.

[emphasis added]

32 The Court of Appeal in _Future Enterprises_ did _not_ appear to have
considered the effect of O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC.

33 This apparent omission to consider O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC was noted by Lee
Seiu Kin J in the recent decision of _MediaCorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia
Networks PLC_ [2009] 4 SLR 496 (“ _MediaCorp_ ”):

26 … The Court of Appeal in Future Enterprises did not appear to have
considered the effect of this provision. Nevertheless, the fact that such
proceedings are “by way of rehearing” [as stated in O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC]
does not necessarily mean that the appeal court’s decision is unfettered. An
appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal is similarly by way of
rehearing under O 57 r 3(1) of the ROC. However, the Court of Appeal will be
slow to upset an exercise of discretion by the trial judge (Golden Shore
Transportation Pte Ltd v UCO Bank [2004] 1 SLR 6 at [44]). Further, with
respect to finding of facts, the Court of Appeal is generally reluctant to
interfere because the trial judge is in a better position to assess the
veracity and credibility of the witnesses (Seah Ting Soon trading as Sing Meng
Co Wooden Cases Factory v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte Ltd [2001] 1 SLR 521 at
[22]). _On the other hand, a distinction is drawn between perception of facts
and evaluation of facts, the latter of which an appellate court is in as good
a position as the trial court to make an evaluation from primary facts_ (Ho
Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank [2007] 2 SLR 181 at [20]). _However the
authorities are clear that the law pertaining to trade mark infringement is
unique in that the final analysis is “more a matter of feel than science”_
(Future Enterprises at [7]).

27 _Be that as it may, in view of the findings that I have made as set out
below, it does not make a difference whether or not the appeal is to be by way
of a rehearing_. As mentioned earlier, MediaCorp proceeded only on two grounds
in this appeal, viz ss 8(2)(b) and 8(3) [TMA], which I now turn to consider.

[emphasis added]

34 O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC was also covered by Chan Seng Onn J in _Valentino
Globe BV v Pacific Rim Industries Inc_ [2009] 4 SLR 577 (which was
subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 46 of 2009)
although neither _Future Enterprises_ nor _MediaCorp_ was mentioned. Chan J
said:

9 Order 87 rule 4(2) of the [ROC] provides that an appeal from the Registrar
of Trade Marks shall be by way of “rehearing”. At para 87/3/7 of Singapore
Civil Procedure 2007 (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2007 ) (“Singapore Civil
Procedure”), it iterates that appeals to the court from the decision of the
registrar [of trade marks] is governed inter alia, by O 55 and that the
procedure is “by way of rehearing…”.

10 On O 55 which governs appeals to the High Court from any court, tribunal or
person, para 55/1/2 of Singapore Civil Procedure notes that O 55 r 2(1)
stipulates that the appeal is by way of rehearing. Order 55, it suggests,
confers upon the Court wider powers than those so conferred under O 53 which
deals with, inter alia, judicial review. Hence, O 55 r 6(5) provides that the
appellate court can make any order which should have been made by the
tribunal. The appellate court is thus not confined to merely determining
whether the decision below was compliant with rules of natural justice or
reached honestly (Ling Uk Choon v Public Accountants Board [2004] 3 SLR 517 at
[32]).

11 “By way of rehearing” in my view means that the Court is not constrained to
determine only whether the tribunal’s decision was proper and/or contained
manifest errors of fact and law. If it wishes to, the Court in its discretion
may consider the entire ream of evidence before it and venture beyond
determining the propriety of the tribunal’s decision or inquiring into whether
there had been manifest errors of fact or law. However, I do not think that it
places an irrevocable burden upon the Courts to hear the matter anew so that
the substantive merits fall to be determined afresh. As para 57/3/1 of
Singapore Civil Procedure observes with regard to the phrase “by way of
rehearing”, albeit in relation to appeals to the Court of Appeal:

These words do not mean that the witnesses are heard afresh. They indicate the
appeal is not limited to a consideration whether the misdirection,
misreception of evidence or other alleged defect in the trial has taken place,
so that a new trial should be ordered. They indicate that the court considers
(so far as may be relevant) the whole of the evidence given in the court below
and the whole course of the trial.

…

The courts’ power is therefore discretionary.

[emphasis in original]

35 Be that as it may, as in _MediaCorp_ , in view of my findings as set out
below, it would make no difference whether or not the appeal is to be by way
of a rehearing. I now turn to examine the two grounds raised in this appeal,
_viz_ , ss 8(2)(_b_) and 8(4) TMA.

AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b) TMA

36 To successfully oppose Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark under s 8(2)(_b_)
TMA, AMP must show that the following three conditions are satisfied in a
“step-by-step” fashion (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in _The Polo/Lauren
Co, LP v Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd_ [2006] 2 SLR 690 (“ _The
Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ ”):

(a) that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR” word
mark are similar (“Condition 1”);

(b) _if_ Condition 1 is satisfied, _then_ that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word
mark is to be registered for goods identical with or similar to those for
which AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR” word mark is protected ( “Condition 2”); and

(c) _if_ Condition 1 _and_ Condition 2 are _both_ satisfied, _then_ that there
exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public by virtue of the
similarity of the marks (_ie_ , Condition 1) and of the goods (_ie_ ,
Condition 2) (“Condition 3”).

37 With respect to these three conditions, the following observations at [8]
of _The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ are instructive:

8 … While we can see some link and overlap between the first and the third
conditions, it is clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is
similar to a registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be a
likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of fact
to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant
circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter of
degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between a mark
and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion. _However, if
either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there will not be any need
to go into the third question of determining whether there exists a likelihood
of confusion. Neither does it mean that if the mark and the sign are similar,
and they are used on similar goods, that there will ipso facto be confusion in
the minds of the public_. If that was intended, s 27(2)(_b_) [see [15] of _The
Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ where it was held that this approach also applied to s
8(2)(_b_) TMA] would have been phrased differently. As presently worded, there
is no presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.
… [emphasis added]

38 I now proceed to consider these respective conditions against the facts of
this case in accordance with this framework.

Condition 1: Similarity between the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” and “GLAMOUR” word
marks

39 At the outset, it must be borne in mind that the word marks compared in
this appeal were devoid of any stylisation, embellishment or device, and were
as follows:

Ozone’s word mark |  AMP’s word mark  
---|---  
HYSTERIC GLAMOUR |  GLAMOUR  
  
  

(1) The approach to be adopted

(A) VISUAL, AURAL AND CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITY

40 As mentioned at [12] above, there are three aspects to similarity, _viz_ ,
visual similarity, aural or phonetic similarity and conceptual similarity (see
_The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ at [10]). Whether there is a similarity of marks in
these three aspects of similarity is essentially a question of fact (see
_Johnson & Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)_ [2007] 1 SLR
1082 (“ _Johnson & Johnson_”) at [9]). The law does _not_ however require
_all_ three similarities to be made out before the finding that the two marks
are similar can be made (see _MediaCorp_ at [32]). In this aspect, the
observations of Bently and Sherman in _Intellectual Property Law_ (Oxford
University Press, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“ _Bently & Sherman_”) at pp 863-866 are also
apposite (footnotes omitted):

_Visual, aural and conceptual similarity_. The marks should be assessed from
the point of view of their visual, aural and conceptual similarities. T
_ypically, tribunals consider each in turn, before reaching an overall
conclusion. In so doing, they have observed that a trade-off can occur: visual
and conceptual differences, for example, can offset aural similarities_.

…

The relative importance of each sort of similarity will vary with the
circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark. … Each
case is therefore to be viewed in its own context. However, the ECJ has ruled
[in _Lloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV_ , Case C-342/97 [1999] 2
_CMLR_ 1343] that, _in an appropriate case, mere aural similarity may make
marks so similar as to be likely to cause confusion…_

…

_In other situations, conceptual dissimilarity, as for example where one mark
has a meaning but its comparator does not, may counteract aural or visual
similarity_.

[emphasis added]

41 A useful case in point is that of _Mystery Drinks GmbH v Office for
Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs), Karlsberg
Brauerei KG Weber Intervening_ [2004] ETMR 217 (which was cited with approval
in _Johnson & Johnson_ at [13]), where “Mystery” was refused registration for
non-alcoholic drinks as the mark “Mixery” had already been registered for
beer. The learned authors of _Bently & Sherman_ note at footnote 51, pp
864-865 that although the:

… figurative mark MYSTERY with stylized M and MIXERY were _neither
conceptually nor visually similar_ , but _were aurally similar…in the field of
beverages this was sufficient_. [emphasis added]

42 Accordingly, the relative importance of each type of similarity will thus
vary with the circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of
mark. The fact that one type of similarity is made out does _not_ necessarily
mean that the marks are similar. Also, regard should be had to the _type_ of
marks being compared (see _MediaCorp_ at [32]).

(B) DISTINCTIVENESS

43 The distinctiveness in the earlier trade mark (_ie_ , “GLAMOUR” in this
case) is also one important factor in the inquiry into the similarity between
the marks under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA. In this vein, Ng-Loy Wee Loon in _Law of
Intellectual Property in Singapore_ (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2009) (“ _Law of
Intellectual Property in Singapore_ ”) observes as follows (footnotes
omitted):

**Comparison between marks**

…

**[21.5.12]** The distinctiveness in the earlier trade mark is one important
factor. _Where a common word is included in the earlier trade mark, the
tribunal should be wary of granting a monopoly in its use. This translates
into a reluctance to hold that two marks which contain a common word are
similar marks_.

[emphasis added]

44 The learned authors of _Bently & Sherman_ note further at pp 866-868
(footnotes omitted):

_Distinctiveness_. The question of whether marks are similar will often be
dependent on the inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark (for the
goods or services for which it is registered). This has a number of effects

First, _the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the less literal or
visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later mark is not similar_.
For example, the CFI comparing two words CASTELLANI and CASTERLLUCA for wine
from the point of view of a German consumer found the two marks to be
dissimilar, because the ‘castel’ element is a common descriptive component in
wine names and the applicant’s suffix ‘luca’ would be seen as the Italian name
and thus sufficient to differentiate the marks. In _Reed Executive plc v Reed
Business Information Ltd_ [[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ stated that _‘where
a mark is descriptive small differences may suffice to avoid confusion’_ ,
giving an illustration from the law of passing-off concerning the terms OFFICE
CLEANING ASSOCIATION and OFFICE CLEANING SERVICES. _Where the distinctiveness
of the earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will have to be in close
proximity for it to be similar_ , as with THERMAWEAR and THERMAWARM. _The same
principle applies to common names which intrinsically have a low level of
distinctiveness_.

Second, if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then a mark that has been
substantially modified might nonetheless still be similar. …

[emphasis added]

45 That this is the approach adopted in Singapore case-law can be seen from
the High Court’s decision in _The Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In Department
Store Pte Ltd_ [2005] 4 SLR 816 (“ _The Polo/Lauren Co (HC)_ ”):

**_The similarity between the plaintiff’s marks and the defendant’s sign_**

26 The decided cases suggest that there are three aspects to similarity:
visual, aural or phonetic, and conceptual. In terms of visual similarity, it
is clear that the mark and the sign share one common denominator: the word
“POLO”. _In cases where there is a common denominator, it is important to look
at the differences between the mark and the sign in order to decide whether
the challenged sign has been able to distinguish itself sufficiently and
substantially_ : _The European Limited v The Economist Newspapers Limited_
[1996] FSR 431 at 436; see also _Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names_
(Sweet & Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2001) at paras 16-63 to 16-67... _In other words,
sometimes, looking at the challenged sign as a whole, the distinctiveness of
the registered word mark is dissolved by the addition of the word.
Accordingly, the similarity between the mark and the sign is significantly
diminished_ and may be insufficient to cause a likelihood of confusion.

27 _In the present case, the differences are obvious: the addition of the word
“PACIFIC” together with the sign’s different font and design. The question,
then, is whether these differences are enough so as not to capture the
distinctiveness of the registered mark. In order to decide this, I first have
to consider whether the plaintiff’s mark can be considered to be so
distinctive that the differences would not negate the similarity_. This is an
important issue because a more distinct mark generally receives greater
protection: _Premier Brands UK Ltd v Typhoon Europe Ltd_ [2000] FSR 767 (“
_Premier Brands_ ”). …

28 … _[I] am prepared to accept that the plaintiff’s word mark is somewhat
distinctive but not strikingly so. As such, the differences between the
plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s sign are sufficient so that the latter
does not capture the distinctiveness of the registered mark and is therefore
not similar to the defendant’s mark_. …

[emphasis added]

46 While the italicised words in [26] of _The Polo/Lauren Co (HC)_ (reproduced
above at [45]) seem to suggest that the distinctiveness of the earlier trade
mark is an important factor in the inquiry into the _likelihood of confusion_
(as opposed to _similarity between the marks_ : see [43] above), those in [27]
_(_ viz _, “_ I first have to consider whether the plaintiff’s mark can be
considered to be so distinctive that the differences would not negate the
_similarity_ ” [_emphasis added] and_[28]  _(_ viz _, “_ the differences
between the plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s sign are sufficient so that
the latter does not capture the distinctiveness of the registered mark and is
therefore not _similar_ to the defendant’s mark” _(emphasis added)) of the
decision make it clear that_ the distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is
an important factor in the inquiry into the _similarity_ between the marks
under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA.

47 In any event, the Court of Appeal’s subsequent decision in _The Polo/Lauren
Co (CA)_ does indicate that the distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is an
important factor to be considered in the inquiry into the _similarity_ between
the marks under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA and is not confined to the analysis of the
likelihood of confusion:

**Similarity between the mark and the sign**

…

23 … _There was simply no evidence before the court to show that the word
“polo” per se is distinctive_. Indeed, the word “polo” is an ordinary English
word meaning a game played on horseback… _We recognise that some marks are
inherently distinctive because they consist of inventive words without any
notional or allusive quality_. An example would be “Volvo”. _“Polo” is
certainly not an inventive word and could claim no inherent distinctiveness.
Where common words are included in a registered mark, the courts should be
wary of granting a monopoly in their use_ : see _The European Limited v The
Economist Newspaper Limited_ [1998] FSR 283 at 289–290 and “FRIGIKING” Trade
Mark [1973] RPC 739 at 753. _Any alleged distinctiveness must be acquired
through use. Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the
light of all the circumstances of the case_. ...

24 _Bearing in mind that “polo” is a common English word, we are unable to see
how it could be said that the sign “POLO PACIFIC” with its special font and
design is similar to the mark “POLO” except in the broadest of sense that one
word is common_. In any event, _for the purpose of determining similarity_
under s 27(2) of the Act, one must look at the mark and the sign as a whole
(see _In the Matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company Ld for the
Registration of a Trade Mark_ (1906) 23 RPC 774 (“ _Pianotist_ ”) and _Cooper
Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited_ [1952] 86 CLR
536 (“ _Cooper_ ”)) and, _bearing in mind the actual differences between the
two, we cannot see how it can be said that the trial judge was wrong when he
held that the sign and the mark are not similar. All the more so when the
appellant was not even claiming a monopoly of the word “polo”. Accordingly, we
agree with the judge that the two are visually, aurally and conceptually
different_.

[emphasis added]

48 In accordance with this approach, I now proceed to examine whether Ozone‘s
“HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark is “similar” to AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark under s 8(2)(_b_)
TMA.

(2) Visual similarity

49 In the case of word marks, a determination of visual similarity typically
involves looking at the (see _Bently & Sherman_ at p 865):

(a)

length of the marks;

(b)

structure of the marks (_ie_ , whether there are the same number of words);
and

(c)

whether the same letters are used in the marks.

50 When comparing two marks visually, one must also bear in mind the
“imperfect recollection” of the consumer (_ie_ , that the consumer may not be
able to remember a mark perfectly) (see _Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffrey
Mark Richard_ [2007] 1 SLR 1071 at [30]). The average consumer only rarely has
the chance to make a direct comparison between the marks, and so must place
his trust in the “imperfect picture of [the two marks] that he has kept in his
mind” (_Lloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV_ , Case C-342/97 [1999] 2
CMLR 1343, 1358-9). Accordingly, where at first glance two marks may appear to
be dissimilar, when the possibility of imperfect recollection is taken into
account, the two marks may in fact be similar (see _Bently & Sherman_ at p
865). Hence, the court will not compare the two marks side by side and examine
them in detail because “the person who is confused often makes comparison from
memory removed in time and space from the marks” (_Caterpillar Inc v Ong Eng
Peng (formerly trading as Catplus International)_ [2006] 2 SLR 669 at [55] per
Tay Yong Kwang J). The court should also not take into account “any external
added matter or circumstances” as the comparison is mark for mark.

51 I have already set out at [13] above the PAR’s reasons for holding that
Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark were visually
_dissimilar_. While the PAR’s statement by itself that:

68 … the simple analysis in visual similarity is merely to look at the marks…

is _inaccurate_ given that the inquiry into the similarity between the marks
under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA must also necessarily consider, if any, the distinctive
components of the marks (see [43]–[47] above), this was nevertheless done
because the PAR also noted in the same paragraph that:

68 … I do not think that the language represented by the letters [in Ozone’s
“HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark] _is so unusual or
descriptive that there should be any dominant element…_ [emphasis added]

52 The PAR’s approach (_viz_ , by looking at the word marks _and_ considering
whether the language represented by the letters in Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”
mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark were so unusual or descriptive that there should
be any dominant element) was consistent with that adopted by the High Court in
_The Polo/Lauren Co (HC)_ (see [45] above), which was affirmed on appeal in
_The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_.

53 In the present instance, although the word marks of Ozone and AMP share one
common denominator, _viz_ , the word “GLAMOUR”, I agreed with the PAR’s
observation that there were:

… many visual differences between the marks. The HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has 15
letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has two words, the
GLAMOUR mark has one.

Furthermore, given that the word “HYSTERIC”, which appears at the beginning of
Ozone’s word mark, is almost of equal length to the word “GLAMOUR”, I could
not see how it would be entirely overlooked or overshadowed by the word
“GLAMOUR”. That Ozone’s word mark has two words was to my mind a visual
difference. Thus, even if “GLAMOUR” is the more common word of the two (_ie_ ,
“HYSTERIC” and “GLAMOUR”) and may come to mind more quickly than “HYSTERIC”,
the consumer with an imperfect recollection (see [50] above) would still
remember that Ozone’s word mark has an additional word to “GLAMOUR”. In these
circumstances, I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s finding that Ozone‘s
“HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was visually _dissimilar_ to AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark.

(3) Aural similarity

54 I have already set out at [14] above the PAR’s reasons for holding that
Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark were aurally
_dissimilar_. It is worth noting that in _Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld_ (1943) 60
RPC 87, Luxmoore LJ’s dissenting judgment stated, at 108:

[t]he answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too
nearly the sound of another … _must nearly always depend on first impression_
, for obviously a person who is familiar with both words will neither be
deceived nor confused. It is the person who only knows the one word and has
perhaps an _imperfect recollection_ of it who is likely to be deceived or
confused. [emphasis added]

This statement was cited with approval in the House of Lords by Viscount
Maugham in _Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld_ (1945) 62 RPC 65 at 72.

55 In _Bently & Sherman_ at p 865, the learned authors noted that:

When comparing marks aurally, tribunals have tended to carry out a
quantitative assessment: do the two signs have more syllables in common than
not?

In these circumstances, I was of the view that the PAR’s approach in dealing
with the question of aural similarity was entirely consistent with the
foregoing approach.

56 In this case, both “HYSTERIC” and “GLAMOUR” were English words, although
the latter could be said to be the more common English word. However, it must
be borne in mind that Ozone’s word mark _starts_ with the entirely separate
word “HYSTERIC” preceding the word “GLAMOUR”. Also, Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”
word mark would be read and pronounced as two separate and distinct words, in
the order of “HYSTERIC” and “GLAMOUR”. AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark, on the other
hand, would be read as a single word. The comparison in this case was between
a two-word mark and a single word mark, so that even if the actual word
“HYSTERIC” was forgotten, it would not be forgotten that there was an
additional word in Ozone’s word mark. While I did not agree entirely with the
reasons of the PAR, I also concluded that the words marks were aurally
_dissimilar_.

(4) Conceptual similarity

57 With regard to the requirement of conceptual similarity, _Bently & Sherman_
note at p 866 (footnotes omitted):

Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and
phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary to
take account of the ideas that lie behind or inform the earlier mark. …

AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark in the present case clearly relied on the orthodox
meaning of “glamour”.

58 In this instance, the PAR had held that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and
AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptually _similar_. Ozone contended that the
PAR, who had found the word marks both visually and aurally _dissimilar_ , had
then subsequently erred in his finding that the word marks were similar on the
basis of conceptual similarity _alone_. To this end, it referred to the
following passage in the decision of the High Court in _McDonald’s Corp v
Future Enterprises Pte Ltd_ [2004] 2 SLR 652 (_McDonald’s (HC)_) (an appeal
against which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in _McDonald’s (CA)_ :

43 As to the visual and aural similarities of the marks, I do not consider
them to be confusingly similar. There are indeed significant visual
differences between them – the depiction of an eagle as opposed to the golden
arches forming the letter “M” – and aural differences – “McChicken”,
“McNuggets”, “Egg McMuffin” and “Sausage McMuffin” compared to “MacTea”,
“MacChocolate” and “MacNoodles”. Below the word component “MacTea”, for
example, the legend “3-in-1 Instant Hot Tea” appears. Other than the letter
“M” in “MacTea”, there is no mark similar to the opponents’ “M” logo anywhere
on the packaging. The word marks are also different in appearance in terms of
colour, font and typeface. The second and third syllables of the application
marks are different in sound from the opponents’. The differences leave
different impressions on people’s minds.

44 Is there a conceptual link between the two in that the common use of the
first syllable “Mac” or “Mc” means that both are likely to be taken as
indicative of a common identity? The use of the first syllable “Mac” in the
applicants’ range of products is not unlike the case of the opponents in that
TWC has admitted to the use of the same naming system as McDonald’s. But it
does not, in my view, override the other differences mentioned earlier and,
when viewed as a whole, _I do not believe there will be confusion between the
rival marks. Having found the dissimilarity in the marks, visually and
aurally, the common idea conveyed by competing marks is not overriding or
determinative_. In _Sports Cafe Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks_ (1998) 42 IPR
552, the court at 557 observed:

[T]he fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only if the
marks themselves look or sound alike. Commonality of idea might then tip the
balance in favour of a finding that the likeness is deceptive.

[emphasis added]

59 Reading the entire passage as a whole, it must be appreciated that the
observation in _McDonald’s (HC)_ at [44] that:

[h]aving found the dissimilarity in the marks, visually and aurally, the
common idea conveyed by competing marks is not overriding or determinative.

which was _preceded_ by the observation that:

I do not believe there will be confusion between the rival marks.

referred to conceptual similarity not being “overriding or determinative” of
the _likelihood of confusion_ between the marks therein (_ie_ , Condition 3:
see [36(c)] above) and _not_ to whether the words marks were _simila_ r (_ie_
, Condition 1: see [36(a)] above). In these circumstances, Ozone’s reading of
_McDonald’s (HC)_ was incorrect in that it _conflated_ Condition 1 and
Condition 3, which as observed in _The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ , are separate
conditions.

60 The observation of the Australian Federal Court in _Sports Café Ltd v
Registrar of Trade Marks_ (1998) 42 IPR 552 (“ _Sports Café_ ”) at [557] that:

… the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant _only_ if the
marks themselves look or sound alike. [emphasis added]

also merits closer scrutiny. This observation was made by the Federal Court in
_Sports Café_ after reviewing an extract from the earlier decision of _Cooper
Engineering Co Pty Ltd v Sigmund Pumps Ltd_ (1952) 86 CLR 536 (“ _Cooper
Engineering_ ”). In _Sports Café_ , the Federal Court stated at 556-557 that:

**The idea behind the mark**

In _Cooper Engineering_ the application was for registration of the words
“Rain King”. The opponent’s mark was RAINMASTER.

…

After pointing out the differences between the suffix “master” and the word
“King” in appearance and sound [Dixon, William and Kitto JJ] continued (at
538-9):

The two words are so unlike to the eye and to the ear that counsel for the
appellant was forced to rely on the likelihood of deception arising from the
two words conveying the same idea of the superiority or supremacy of the
article as a mechanism for making a spray similar to falling rain or
artificial rain as it was called during the argument. But it is obvious that
trade marks, especially word marks, could be quite unlike and yet convey the
same idea of the superiority or some particular suitability of an article for
the work it was intended to do. To refuse an application for registration on
this ground would be to give the proprietor of a registered trade mark a
complete monopoly of all words conveying the same idea as his trade mark. The
fact that two marks convey the same idea is not sufficient in itself to create
a deceptive resemblance between them, although this fact could be taken into
account in deciding whether two marks which really looked alike or sounded
alike were likely to deceive.

Thus the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only if the
marks themselves look or sound alike. Commonality of idea might then tip the
balance in favour of a finding that the likeness is deceptive.

61 I could not agree with the narrow approach in _Cooper Engineering_. While I
agreed that one should be slow to refuse registration of a mark simply on the
basis of conceptual similarity alone, I was also of the view that it would be
wrong to say that conceptual similarity would be relevant only if there was
visual or aural similarity. As mentioned (at [42] above), the relative
importance of each type of similarity must necessarily vary with the
circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark being
compared. The fact that one type of similarity is made out also does _not_
necessarily mean that the marks are similar. To adopt an overly generalised
and restrictive principle that conceptual similarity is _only_ relevant to
determining similarity between marks when either visual or aural similarity
has been made out would be to ignore the fact that each aspect of similarity
can vary in different degrees _vis-à-vis_ each other depending on the
circumstances, and trade-offs are entirely possible between the three aspects
of similarity – for example, conceptual similarity can offset visual and aural
dissimilarities. A similar approach was also adopted in _Lloyd Schuhfabrik
Meyer & Co GmbH v Klijsen Handel BV_ [2000] FSR 77 (a decision which was
followed by the High Court in _Richemont International SA v Goldlion
Enterprise (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ [2006] 1 SLR 401) at 84:

28\. In order to assess the degree of similarity between the marks concerned,
the national _court must determine the degree of visual, aural or conceptual
similarity between them and, where appropriate, evaluate the importance to be
attached to those different elements_ , taking account of the category of
goods or services in question and the circumstances in which they are
marketed. [emphasis added]

In these circumstances, I was of the view that, in this instance, despite the
word marks being visually and aurally dissimilar, conceptual similarity
_nevertheless_ deserved consideration.

62 The PAR’s reasons for holding that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and
AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptually _similar_ have already been set out
above at [15]. Against this, Ozone contended however that the two marks were
conceptually _dissimilar_. It pointed out that while the word “GLAMOUR” was
defined in the online _Merriam-Webster_ dictionary as “an exciting and often
illusory and romantic attractiveness”, the usage of the word “HYSTERIC”, which
was defined in the _Longman Dictionary of the English Language_ as “someone
suffering from hysteria”, changed the complexion of the word “GLAMOUR”.
According to it, although the concept of “GLAMOUR” was still present in
“HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”, the concept had varied because one does not associate
“HYSTERIC” with “GLAMOUR”. To support its position, it cited the case of
_Itochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands, Inc_ [2007] SGIPOS 9 (“ _Itochu_ ”),
where the marks under comparison were “CAMEL” and “SWEETCAMEL”, as being
“closely analogous” to the present factual matrix. In holding that these marks
were conceptually _dissimilar_ , the PAR in that case made the following
observations at [37]:

37 Bearing in mind the Opponents’ argument that the average consumer normally
perceives the mark as a whole without analysing its various details - a
principle which has also been relied on by the Applicants - and that marks
should not be compared side by side as marks are generally remembered by
general impressions rather than by recollection of the whole; _I find that
there is no conceptual similarity between the Opponents’ and the Applicants’
marks. The Applicants’ “SWEETCAMEL” mark does not convey the same idea and
impression as the Opponents’ marks. The Opponents’ “CAMEL” marks evoke the
sense of ruggedness, adventure and masculinity whereas the Applicants’ mark
which is preceded by the adjective “sweet” projects a totally opposite
impression_. [emphasis added]

The decision in _Itochu_ was upheld on appeal by the High Court.

63 In the present instance, while the PAR was of the view that the word
“HYSTERIC” did modify the concept of “GLAMOUR” to a “certain point”, the main
concept of “GLAMOUR” had _not_ been “completely reversed” as in _Itochu_. In
this aspect, the PAR observed:

70 … In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark still relies on the concept that
they are ‘glamorous’, albeit injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically
glamorous’. From another point of view this should still hold true; the
concept of [Ozone] cannot be that the clothes do not look glamorous at all,
otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their mark, which is to sell
designed clothes at a premium price.

71 I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is in some way conceptually
similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark
appeals to orthodox meaning of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to
it but still is based on ‘glamour’. ...

64 I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s holding that the word marks in this
case were “in some way” (as opposed to completely or to a large extent)
conceptually similar. As Ozone conceded, the concept of “GLAMOUR” was still
present in “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”.

65 The inquiry however does not stop here. The distinctiveness of AMP’s
“GLAMOUR” mark must also be considered at this stage.

(5) Distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark

66 In the present case, the PAR did not find it:

72 … necessary to follow the principles [enunciated in _The European Ltd v The
Economist Newspaper Ltd_ [1998] ETMR 307] of descriptive elements allowing
closer similarity…

because he was of the opinion that:

… that principle in particular should only act as a[n] advanced argument in
case the basic analyses do not reveal any clear result.

67 This approach is however _contrary_ to that set out above at [43]–[47]
where the distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is an important factor in
the inquiry into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA.

68 In these circumstances, I was of the view that the PAR had erred in failing
to go _further_ after considering the visual, aural and conceptual similarity
of the word marks to consider the level of distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
word mark in his inquiry into the similarity between the marks under s
8(2)(_b_) TMA.

69 In the present instance, there was no evidence before me to show that the
word “GLAMOUR”, which is an ordinary English word (see [62] above) and not an
inventive word, is inherently distinctive. The word “GLAMOUR”, the title of
AMP’s magazine, in fact _describes_ the very nature of the content in AMP’s
magazine, which is described, on its website, as a magazine for young women
interested in fashion, beauty and a contemporary lifestyle and which contains
a number of photographs and advertisements displaying fashionable clothing and
accessories. In my view, the word “GLAMOUR” is _not_ inherently distinctive.

70 Has the word mark “GLAMOUR” then acquired distinctiveness through use in
Singapore? To my mind, based on the limited and unsatisfactory evidence
tendered by AMP which did little to support its claim that the “GLAMOUR” mark
was extensively used in Singapore, this question must be answered in the
negative. As evidence in support of its circulation figures between 1990 -
2002 (see [14] of the GD), AMP tendered _nine_ invoices from STP Distributors
Pte Ltd dated:

(a)

10 March 2000 to “TIMES THE BOOKSHOP PTE LTD” at Centrepoint Shopping Centre
(“TIMES”) showing a sale of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;

(b)

14 July 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of 40 “GLAMOUR” magazines;

(c)

8 September 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of 40 “GLAMOUR” magazines;

(d)

24 August 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;

(e)

7 September 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of 50 “GLAMOUR” magazines;

(f)

26 October 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;

(g)

18 January 2002 to a “COLD STORAGE” supermarket outlet showing a sale of 30
“GLAMOUR” magazines;

(h)

12 April 2002 to TIMES showing a sale of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines; and

(i)

13 September 2002 to TIMES showing a sale of 20 “GLAMOUR” magazines.

71 It may readily be observed that these nine invoices related only to sales
in _specific_ months in the _limited_ period from 2000 to 2002. They did not
reflect a monthly distribution from 1984 (the year AMP claimed its use of the
“GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started) and neither did they correspond to the
total distribution figures submitted by AMP (see [14] of the GD). For example,
although the invoice dated 24 August 2001 reflected only the sale of 30 copies
of the September 2001 edition of the “GLAMOUR” magazine to TIMES, AMP claimed
a distribution figure of 823 in September 2001. The nine invoices adduced
supported only a fraction of the distribution figures claimed by AMP.
Furthermore, the nine invoices related only to the distribution of the
“GLAMOUR” magazine to _one_ branch of TIMES (_viz_ , the Centrepoint outlet)
and _a_ single supermarket. There was nothing in evidence to support the
promotion and/or subsequent sale of the “GLAMOUR” magazine to the Singapore
public. In these circumstances, given the paucity of AMP’s evidence, I was of
the view that it could not be said that the “GLAMOUR” mark had acquired
distinctiveness through use in Singapore.

72 AMP sought to argue, without raising any relevant authority, that its
“GLAMOUR” word mark was distinctive by virtue of the fact that it was a
registered trade mark under the Act. However such a line of argument was
rejected by the Court of Appeal in _The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ :

23 …Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the light of
all the circumstances of the case. No authority has been cited to substantiate
the assertion that the fact of registration is conclusive as to the
distinctiveness of a mark. Neither does it follow that the incorporation of an
entire registered word mark would automatically lead to infringement. …

(6) Conclusion on the overall similarity between the marks

73 Given my conclusion that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s
“GLAMOUR” word mark was visually and aurally _dissimilar_ , but conceptually
_similar_ , and that “GLAMOUR” was merely descriptive and neither inherently
distinctive nor distinctive by use, I was of the view that there was _no_
similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(_b_) TMA. Strictly speaking, having
arrived at this conclusion, it was not necessary, for the purposes of s
8(2)(_b_) TMA to go on to consider Condition 2 (see [36(b)] above) and
Condition 3 (see [36(c)] above). Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I
shall do so.

Condition 2: Similarity of goods

74 With regard to this requirement, the learned authors of _Bently & Sherman_
note at p 869:

**2.3.2 When are goods or services similar?**

The question of whether goods or services are similar depends on the facts of
the case. When deciding whether a trade mark application falls foul of one of
the relative grounds for refusal, the comparison is normally between the goods
or services for which the earlier mark has been registered and the goods or
services to which the application relates. …

75 The relevant factors for assessing similarity of goods covered by Ozone’s
“HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark are (see _British
Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons Ltd_ [1996] RPC 281 (“ _British Sugar_ ”)
at 296–297):

(a) the respective uses of the respective goods;

(b) the respective end users of the respective goods:

(c) the physical nature of the goods;

(d) the respective trade channels through which the goods reach the market;

(e) in the case of self-serve consumer items, whether in practice they are
respectively found or likely to be found on the same or different shelves; and

(f) whether the respective goods are competitive or complementary. This
inquiry may take into account how those in trade classify goods, for instance
whether market research companies who act for industry put the goods or
services in the same or different sectors.

These factors were adopted in _Johnson & Johnson_ at [14] and _MediaCorp_ at
[41]. These factors need not all be satisfied before the goods can be treated
as similar (_Johnson & Johnson_ at [18]).

76 The learned authors of _Bently & Sherman_ explain at pp 869-870 (footnotes
omitted) how these factors were applied in _British Sugar vis-à-vis_ a non-
distinctive mark (as I had adjudged “GLAMOUR” to be (see [66]–[72] above) :

[_British Sugar_] illustrates how the courts have applied the factors in the
case of a non-distinctive mark (namely TREAT). There the question was whether
a sweet syrup to be poured over desserts was similar to a sweet-flavoured
spread. Jacob J concluded that the goods were not similar, explaining that the
goods were used differently (the spread could be used on desserts but
generally would not be); were not in direct competition; were located in
different places in supermarkets (the spread with jams, the dessert sauce with
desserts); were physically different (the spread was more viscous than the
sauce); and were treated differently by market researches. In contrast in
_Balmoral Trade Mark_ [[1999] RPC 297,302], whisky and wine were held to be
similar goods: although the two products have very different producers, it is
common to find them being bought and sold by the same merchants, and sold
through the same outlets.

77 As noted above at [17], the PAR however saw no reason to decide along the
lines of the _British Sugar_ factors (see [75] above) in coming to his
conclusion that:

… the scope of [AMP’s] description of goods (**_“Magazines, books and
publications”_**) is clearly a sub-set of the goods of [Ozone] (in particular
the mention of **__“printed matter”__** in the description of [Ozone’s]
goods).

[emphasis in original]

78 The PAR had also referred to an apparent concession by Ozone that “there
may be an overlap [between AMP’s goods and] the goods that [Ozone is] applying
for”. For convenience, it would be useful to set out the nature of the
parties’ respective goods:

Ozone’s goods in Class 16 |  AMP’s goods in Class 16  
---|---  
Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’ chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags; _printed matter_ ; paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands; playing cards; stationery and study materials |  _Magazines, books and publications_  
  
  

In the course of the hearing before me, Ozone pointed out that its concession
of an overlap with AMP’s “magazines, books and publications” was _only_
limited to “printed matter” and did _not_ extend to “paper and cardboard;
industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of
paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’
chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners of paper; flags of
paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photographs
stands; playing cards; stationery and study materials” (“Ozone’s other
goods”), which according to Ozone were “very different” from “magazines, books
and publications”. Ozone submitted that Ozone’s other goods could “be broadly
classified into stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made
of paper and photographs” and that applying the _British Sugar_ test, Ozone’s
other goods were different in function from “magazines, books and
publications”. Ozone contended that the parties’ respective target consumers
were also different as people buying magazines would not be purchasing
“stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper and
photographs” as alternatives and accordingly the compared goods were not in
competition. The trade channels were also different. While AMP’s “magazines,
books and publications” were likely to be sold at newsstands and bookstores,
Ozone’s other goods would be sold at supermarkets, furniture stores or
bookstores and that even if Ozone’s other goods were sold in the same stores,
they would be placed at different sections of the store as “magazines are not
usually placed together with stationery, hygiene paper products
labels/banners/blinds made of paper and photographs”.

79 Ozone referred to the decision of _In the Matter of Application No 2242582A
by the Secretary to the Quorn Hunt to register a series of trade marks in
Classes 9, 13, 16, 18, 21, 25 and 41 and In the Matter of Opposition No 90056
by Marlow Foods Limited_ (O-319-04)[note: 1] (“ _Marlow Foods_ ”) where the
respective goods in Class 16 being compared were as follows (see para 28):

Applicant’s Goods in Class 16 |  Opponent’s Goods in Class 16  
---|---  
_Printed matter_ , stationery, writing and drawing instruments, _cards_ , postcards photographs, pictures, _calendars_ , coasters, posters, _diaries_ , instruction manuals; but not including any such goods relating to food preparation |  Printed matter, books and periodicals concerning the use of myco-protein in food preparation.  
  
  

[emphasis added]

The compared marks were similar (_ie_ , Condition 1 was satisfied). The
hearing officer found that the goods “printed matter, “cards”, “calendars” and
“diaries” were similar to the Opponent’s goods but allowed the Applicant’s
mark to proceed to registration in respect of the remaining goods, _viz_ ,
“…stationery, writing and drawing instruments, cards, postcards photographs,
pictures, …coasters, posters [and] instruction manuals” which were considered
dissimilar.

80 I found Ozone’s arguments and the approach in _Marlow Foods_ practical and
sensible. In these circumstances, I was of the view that although “printed
matter” in Ozone’s goods were _similar_ to AMP’s goods (_viz_ , “magazines,
books and publications”), Ozone’s other goods were _dissimilar_. Accordingly,
I was of the view that the PAR had erred in finding that Ozone’s other goods
were similar to AMP’s goods (_viz_ , “magazines books and publications”).
Accordingly, I was of the view that Condition 2 was thus satisfied _only_ to
the extent as described. I now move on to examine Condition 3.

Condition 3: Likelihood of confusion on the part of the public

81 As stated above at [37], _even_ where the marks are similar _and_ the goods
are similar, this does not mean that there will _ipso facto_ be confusion in
the mind of the public. There is _no_ presumption of confusion even where
these two aspects of similarity are made out (_The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ at
[8]).

82 The learned authors of _Bently & Sherman_ elaborate at p 872 (footnotes
omitted) as to what the public must be confused about:

**2.3.3 Likelihood of confusion**

…

What must the public be confused about? The next question to consider is what
is meant by ‘likelihood of confusion’ in [s 8(2)(b) TMA]? In its ‘classic
form’, _consumers must be confused about the source or origin of the goods or
services – that is, they must be confused as to the designer, manufacturer,
selector or supplier of the goods or services. In other words, classic
confusion is concerned with the situation where consumers believe that the
goods or services emanate from one organization, but they, in fact come from a
different independent organization_. This classic form of confusion has been
extended to accommodate broader understandings of the source of goods or
services. Consequently, a _person will be confused for the purposes of [s
8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly assume that there is some broader kind of
economic connection between the users of marks, for example, that the goods
are being provided by a subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark owner_. …

_In considering whether there is a likelihood of confusion, the tribunals must
consider whether there is a genuine and properly substantiated likelihood of
confusion: it is not enough that confusion is hypothetical and remote. The
term ‘likelihood’ indicates probability rather than possibility_.

[emphasis added]

83 As to what constitutes “likelihood of confusion”, these principles, as
distilled from previous cases, were succinctly laid out in _MediaCorp_ (which
had similarly dealt with s 8(2)(_b_) TMA) at [43]:

43 The following principles as to what constitutes “likelihood of confusion”
can be distilled from the cases:

(a) The court is entitled to look outside the mark and the sign, as well as
the articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of confusion ([_The
Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_] at [8]).

(b) The question of likelihood of confusion has to be looked at globally
taking into account all the circumstances including ([_The Polo/Lauren Co
(CA)_] at [28]):

(i) the closeness of the goods;

(ii) the impression given by the marks;

(iii) the possibility of imperfect recollection;

(iv) the risk that the public might believe that the goods come from the same
source or economically-linked sources;

(v) the steps taken by the defendant to differentiate the goods from those of
the registered proprietor; and

(vi) the kind of customer who would be likely to buy the goods of the
applicant and opponent.

(c) One should not determine the likelihood of confusion based on the man in a
hurry, and the test should be the “ordinary, sensible members of the public”
([_The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_] at [31]). The average consumer is someone who
would exercise some care and good sense in making his purchases ([_The
Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_] at [34]). However, the “average consumer” need not
necessarily mean the general public, as more specialised products might be
purchased by a more specific cross-section of the public (Nation Fittings (M)
Sdn Bhd v Oystertec Plc [2006] 1 SLR 712 at [97]).

(d) The ambit of the protection offered by the Act to a registered proprietor
of a trade mark should be guided by the underlying aim of the trade marks
regime, which is to ensure that consumers do not confuse the trade source of
one product with another ([_The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_] at [32]]. The policy of
s 8 [TMA] is to protect the public against deception. In Weir Warman Ltd v
Research & Development Pty Ltd [2007] 2 SLR 1073, V K Rajah JA observed that
(at [41]):

It is plain that the trade mark register is intended to be a comprehensive and
accurate record of trade marks currently in use. As such, it is crucial to
maintain the accuracy of the register and to ensure that undeserving and
invalid trade marks are removed from the register without undue delay and
complication. In addition, the register is meant to assure and endorse the
function of registered trade marks as badges of origin … so as to protect the
public against deception. Hence marks that are misleading or likely to cause
confusion or no longer serve their function should not be accepted or allowed
to remain on the register, as the case may be.

[emphasis added]

To this end, mere association which the public may make between two trade
marks because of their semantic content is not in itself a sufficient basis
for concluding that there is a likelihood of confusion, in the absence of any
possibility of a misapprehension as to the origin of the goods and services
(Richemont International SA v Da Vinci Collections Pte Ltd (“Richemont”)
[2006] 4 SLR 369 at [20]).

(e) The greater the exposure and use of a particular registered mark, the
greater its reputation is likely to be, and therefore the greater the
protection likely to be afforded to it ([_The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_] at [34]].

84 It appears that the court is entitled to look outside the mark and the
sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of
confusion. This proposition was in fact extracted from _The Polo/Lauren Co
(CA)_ (which was a trade mark _infringement_ action under s 27(2)(_b_) TMA),
which had, in turn, relied on _Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd_
[1999] 2 SLR 651 and _McDonald’s (CA)_ , both of which were trade mark
_registration_ oppositions pursuant to s 15 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332,
1992 Rev Ed). The Court of Appeal in _The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ stated that:

**The approach to section 27(2) of the Act**

5 Section 27(2) of the Act reads:

A person infringes a registered trade mark if, without the consent of the
proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in the course of trade a sign where
because —

(_a_) the sign is identical with the trade mark and is used in relation to
goods or services similar to those for which the trade mark is registered; or

(_b_) the sign is similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods
or services identical with or similar to those for which the trade mark is
registered,

there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.

…

8 In our opinion, having examined the express wording of s 27(2)(_b_), the
step-by-step approach adopted in _British Sugar_ is conceptually more
appropriate and is in line with the structure of the provision. It seems to us
that there will be infringement under that provision only if three conditions
are present. First, the alleged offending sign must be shown to be similar to
the registered mark. Second, both the sign and the mark must be used in
relation to similar goods or services. Third, on account of the presence of
the first two conditions, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part
of the public. As the judge rightly pointed out, s 27(2)(_b_) does not make it
an infringement if the likelihood of confusion is caused by some other factor.
While we can see some link and overlap between the first and the third
conditions, it is clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is
similar to a registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be a
likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of fact
to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant
circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter of
degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between a mark
and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion. However, if
either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there will not be any need
to go into the third question of determining whether there exists a likelihood
of confusion. Neither does it mean that if the mark and the sign are similar,
and they are used on similar goods, that there will _ipso facto_ be confusion
in the minds of the public. If that was intended, s 27(2)(_b_) would have been
phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no presumption of confusion
once the two aspects of similarity are present. _To determine the existence of
confusion, the court is entitled to look outside the mark and the sign, as
well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of
confusion: see Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd [1999] 2 SLR 651 and
McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd [2005] 1 SLR 177. While these two
latter cases related to opposition proceedings under s 15 of the then Trade
Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed), there is no reason why the concept of
“likely to cause confusion” under that provision should be any different from
the concept of “likelihood of confusion” under the present s 27(2)(b)_. As we
see it, the global assessment test is likely to confound the final issue of
confusion with the first two prerequisite conditions. Accordingly, we endorse
the _British Sugar_ approach which was adopted by Lai J.

[emphasis added]

85 Ozone also referred to the decision of Kitchin J in the English High Court
decision of _Julius Sämaan Ltd v Tetrosyl Ltd_ [2006] FSR 42 (“ _Julius
Säamaan_ ”), which involved, _inter alia_ , a trade mark infringement action.
The relevant portion of the decision, at 872, reads:

52 There is one further general principle which is important to have in mind
at the outset in considering infringement. The court must consider the
likelihood of confusion arising from the use by the defendant of the offending
sign, discounting added matter or circumstances. _If the sign and the mark are
confusingly similar then the defendant cannot escape by showing that by
something outside the actual mark itself he has distinguished his goods from
those of the proprietor_. In the present case this is important. _Looking at
the box in which the Christmas Tree product is sold, the use of the words
“Lumber Jack Flashing air freshener” must be ignored, as must the particular
circumstance in which the product is sold. The comparison to be made is
between, on the one hand, the Tree marks and, on the other, the Christmas Tree
product itself, and the picture of it which appears on the box_. [emphasis
added]

86 As may be seen, the approach advocated in _Julius Säamaan_ to determining
the likelihood of confusion, which does _not_ look outside the marks, is
_different_ from that adopted in _The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ which “look[s]
outside the mark and the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether
there exists a likelihood of confusion”. This difference was in fact noted at
[18]-[20] of _The Polo/Lauren Co (HC)_ , with reasons offered as to why the
latter approach (_ie_ , that adopted in _The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_) should be
favoured:

18 However, while the global assessment test should be rejected, I am equally
uncomfortable with a strict adherence to old English jurisprudence. In
particular, both parties appeared to agree that _the test for the likelihood
of confusion under this approach is an exceedingly narrow one. Once a mark is
shown to offend, the user “cannot escape by showing that by something outside
the actual mark itself he has distinguished his goods from those of the
registered proprietor”_ : [_Saville Perfumery Ld v June Perfect Ld and F W
Woolworth & Co Ld_ (1941) 58 RPC 147] ([11] _supra_) at 161. If this is a
correct interpretation of the case, I would decline to follow this lead for
the following reasons.

19 Firstly, it is worthwhile to note that even the English cases appear to
differ on whether this is the correct approach. In _June Perfect_ itself, Sir
Wilfrid Greene MR, at 161–162, went on to remark that the degree of similarity
required for a likelihood of confusion to be caused depended on, for example,
the goods in question. Where the customers of the goods in question were not
the sort who would be too careful about the details of the mark and would only
remember some distinguishing feature, it would require very little for the
likelihood of confusion to be caused. If, on the other hand, this is not the
case, then it would require “nothing short of a degree of resemblance apparent
to the eye” for there to exist a likelihood of confusion. Thus, the court is
allowed to look outside the marks in order to assess how similar the marks
must be for there to exist a likelihood of confusion. _Origins Natural
Resources Inc v Origin Clothing Limited_ [1995] FSR 280 (“ _Origins_ ”) is of
no use because the remark there that external added matter or circumstances
should be discounted was made in relation to the defendant’s claim that since
it and the plaintiff were trading in different markets and in different
countries, the likelihood of confusion could never arise. Jacob J, in that
case, rightly held that the courts must assume that the mark would be used in
a normal and fair manner. Plaintiffs do not need to show that there is actual
confusion: _Compass Publishing BV v Compass Logistics Ltd_ [2004] RPC 41; _In
the matter of an Application by Edward Hack for the Registration of a Trade
Mark (_ 1941) 58 RPC 91. It is also important to note that in both these
cases, there was no discussion of an earlier case, _In the matter of an
Application by the Pianotist Company Ld for the Registration of a Trade Mark_
(1906) 23 RPC 774 (“the _Pianotist_ case”), which was affirmed in _Sime Darby
Edible Products Ltd v Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oil Pte Ltd_ [2000] 4 SLR 360 (“
_Sime Darby_ ”). In the _Pianotist_ case, Parker J, at 777, having reviewed
the decisions that came before, summarised the position of the law as such:

You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their look and by
their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You
must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those
goods. … If, _considering all those circumstances_ , you come to the
conclusion that there will be a confusion … then you must refuse the
registration in that case. [emphasis added]

In _Wagamama_ ([11]  _supra_), the court also did not consider the _Pianotist_
case. Nonetheless, Laddie J was equivocal about whether the court was to find
a likelihood of confusion notwithstanding that the alleged infringer had taken
steps to differentiate his products from the plaintiff’s. For instance, he
remarked, at 720–721, that:

If … the marks were too similar, _usually_ infringement would be found even if
in the market place the infringer took steps to prevent confusion in fact
occurring ... To this extent therefore, _a registered trade mark created a
monopoly which might sometimes go beyond what was strictly necessary to
protect the proprietor’s goods and his reputation_. [emphasis added]

I am in agreement with this observation. _The protection that the law offers
to a registered proprietor of a trade mark is wide but it is not infinite. The
ambit of that protection should be guided by the underlying aim of a trade
marks regime, which is to ensure that consumers do not confuse the trade
source of one product with another. For instance, where the consideration of
other matters can assist the court in drawing the line at cases where the
likelihood of confusion is merely imaginary, there is no reason not to do so.
Otherwise, the law will end up extending protection where none is needed_.

20 Secondly, the Singapore cases deciding on the question of the likelihood of
confusion, although mostly involving an opposition to the registration of a
sign, have been much clearer and more consistent in allowing the consideration
of these extraneous factors. In _Sime Darby_ , Lim Teong Qwee JC quoted and
applied Parker J’s summation of the law on the issue of confusion which I
quoted at [19] above. In _Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd_ [1999] 2
SLR 651 (“ _Kellogg_ ”), the Court of Appeal considered an opposition to the
registration of a mark under s 15 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev
Ed). It was held, at [30] and [33],that the likelihood of confusion was to be
determined on the basis of several factors, including the actual use of the
mark, the reputation of the earlier mark and the packaging of the goods. More
recently, in [_McDonald’s (CA)_] ([14] _supra_), the Court of Appeal held, at
[66], that:

[T]he question whether a proposed mark will likely give rise to confusion on
account of some similarity with an existing mark is a question of fact
depending on all the circumstances of the case. Besides comparing the marks,
also germane are the extent of the reputation of the existing mark, how the
proposed mark is to be used, the nature of the goods to which the mark will be
put, how the goods are to be sold and who the target customers are: see _In
the Matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company Ltd_ (1906) 23 RPC 774
at 777. Obviously, these considerations are not exhaustive.

I am not convinced by the plaintiff’s submission that these cases should be
distinguished simply because they dealt with unregistered marks. Under the
relevant statute being considered by the courts in those cases was a
requirement of the mark being “likely to deceive or cause confusion”. Surely
it cannot be argued that this is any different than the requirement of a
“likelihood of confusion” under s 27(2)(_b_) of the current TMA.

21 Finally, _turning to the plain words of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, I find that
a proper construction of the provision does not reject the court’s discretion
in assessing so-called extraneous factors when deciding whether there is a
likelihood of confusion. The only thing that the statute calls for is that the
likelihood of confusion arises from the similarity. But where the user of a
potentially infringing sign has taken pains to distinguish his products from
the registered proprietor’s good_ [_sic_] _and services, the effect may be
that the likelihood of confusion, if any, is merely hypothetical or
speculative_. This is significant because unlike s 27(1) TMA, s 27(2)(_b_)
does not presume that there is a likelihood of confusion. If there is no
likelihood of confusion, there can be no infringement: _Pan-West (Pte) Ltd v
Grand Bigwin Pte Ltd_ [2003] 4 SLR 755 at [12]. Section 27(2)(_b_) TMA _also
does not forbid the court taking into account various factors in deciding the
degree of similarity required in order to find that there exists a likelihood
of confusion_.

22 Having reviewed the cases, and confining myself strictly to what is
required to decide the present case, I am of the opinion that _there are two
ways in which factors extraneous to the mark come into play. One is to
establish the strength of the similarity required in order to decide the
question of whether there exists a likelihood of confusion_. …

_The court cannot know what degree of similarity causes confusion unless it is
able to assess, for instance, the trading circumstances of the goods in
question and therefore the standard of care that the ordinary consumer will
exercise in that particular case. The other is this. Where the court finds
that there is a likelihood of confusion by reason of the similarity, the court
must go on and enquire whether this likelihood is a real one or whether it is
merely speculative or hypothetical. Where the infringer has taken sufficient
steps to distinguish his goods from the plaintiff’s such that the likelihood
of confusion becomes a mere possibility, there is no infringement_. Of course,
there is no need for plaintiffs to demonstrate that there is actual confusion.
However, the courts are not to hold that there is a likelihood of confusion on
the basis of “highly speculative eventuality”: _McDonald’s_ , at [59]…

[emphasis added]

87 Although _The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)_ was a trade mark _infringement_ action
under s 27(2)(_b_) TMA, the Court of Appeal in that case was of the view that
s 8(2)(_b_) of the TMA should be _similarly_ construed:

15 It is of interest to compare _Polo Textile_ with _10 Royal Berkshire Polo
Club Trade Mark_ [2001] RPC 32 (“ _Royal Berkshire_ ”) where an application to
register the mark “10 Royal Berkshire POLO CLUB” was opposed by the same party
as the appellant in the present case. The relevant English statutory provision
read:

A trade mark shall not be registered if because —

…

(b) it is similar to an earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods
or services identical with or similar to those for which the earlier trade
mark is protected,

there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which
includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.

It would be noted that the material part of the wording of this English
provision (except for the last phrase “which includes the likelihood of
association with the earlier trade mark”) is identical to our s 8(2) of the
Act. It is also similar to our s 27(2)(_b_) (except again for the last
phrase). _Of course, this English provision (as our s 8(2)) relates to
refusing the registration of a mark, rather than the infringement of an
existing mark. However, we do not think this distinction should mean that the
meaning to be given to s 27(2)(b) should be any different from that ascribed
to s 8(2) or the equivalent English provision considered in Royal Berkshire_.
In addition, we also do not think that the inclusion of the ending phrase in
the English provision in any way enlarges its meaning. Confusion as to trade
origin is already encompassed in the earlier part of the provision: see
Christopher Morcom, Ashley Roughton & James Graham, _The Modern Law of Trade
Marks_ (Butterworths, 1999 Ed) at p 208.

[emphasis added]

Nevertheless, where, as in the present case, there was not much evidence as to
how Ozone intends to apply its mark or to distinguish its goods from AMP’s in
Singapore, the consideration of factors other than the marks themselves would
be limited, although the consideration of other factors was in principle
permissible.

88 In the course of the hearing before me, AMP produced a copy of a magazine,
which was a “25th anniversary book” bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark,
which had been purchased from a bookstore in Singapore in September 2009.
However, in my view, this itself did not constitute much evidence about
Ozone’s intentions in Singapore with its mark.

89 As stated above at [19], the PAR had identified the relevant segment of the
public to be “the entire group of women who read magazines for leisure and
[who] are fashion conscious.” I agreed with this classification. However, I
would add that as noted at [36] of _The Polo/Lauren Co (HC)_ :

**_The likelihood of confusion_**

…

36 The average consumer in Singapore has been described as _literate,
educated, exposed to the world and unlikely to be easily hoodwinked_ : (_Tong
Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd_ [1991] SLR
133]([23] _supra_) at 143–144, [30]; and [_McDonald_ ’s _(CA)_] at [64]. This
is the starting point. [emphasis added]

90 Furthermore, in the context of the average consumer _of magazines_ and
their purchasing habits, it has been noted in _In the Matter of Application No
2136517A in the name of IPC Magazines Limited to register a trade mark in
Classes 9, 16 & 35 and In the Matter of Opposition thereto under No 50532 by
Liberty Media for Women LLC_[note: 2] that:

36\. Magazines are primarily obtained by self-selection, which makes the
visual appearance of the title (or trade mark) of primary importance. They are
usually displayed alongside other magazines, grouped according to subject
matter. It is possible that a women’s magazine could be displayed alongside,
or in the proximity of one for teenagers and young women, which would afford a
side-by-side comparison. I cannot, however say that that would necessarily be
the case, particularly in circumstances where the magazine is obtained by
subscription. There are circumstances when oral use, such as a consumer making
an enquiry regarding the availability of a publication will be of relevance.
_Although magazines are relatively inexpensive items, the consumer is, I
consider, reasonably discerning in the selection, where able, often picking up
the magazine to glance through its contents prior to making the decision to
purchase_. [emphasis added]

91 In these circumstances, given my conclusion that there was _no_ similarity
between Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark under s
8(2)(_b_) TMA (see [73] above), and bearing in mind the characteristics of the
average consumer who would be likely to buy the goods of Ozone and AMP (see
[82]-[83] and [89] above) and who would “exercise some care and good sense in
making his purchases” (see [83] above), I was of the view that even for
“printed matter”, let alone Ozone’s other goods, the ordinary Singaporean
would have little difficulty discerning that Ozone’s goods bearing the
“HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark are not from the same trade source or origin as AMP’s
goods bearing the “GLAMOUR” mark. In this aspect, it would be useful to refer
to _In the Matter of Application No 1568121 in the name of Global Spa and in
the matter of Opposition thereto under No 45679 in the name of Advance
Magazine Publishers Inc_.[note: 3] Here, the United Kingdom Intellectual
Property Office Hearing Officer, adopting a similar stance, observed as
follows:

_Titles of magazines by their nature tend to make varying degrees of reference
to their subject matter or target readership, and consequently many have a low
level of distinctiveness. The word GLAMOUR is no exception. It is an ordinary
and well known word in the English language which readily conveys the idea of
clothing, make-up, etc, and given that the opponents say that their magazine
sold under the GLAMOUR trade mark is well known for its features relating to
fashion and related topics I consider that it falls into the category of a
mark with a low degree of distinctiveness_. I make this observation only
insofar as to say that as it is _not the strongest of marks this is likely to
impact on customer perception of the mark and the issue of confusion_.
[emphasis added]

I should add that this observation was made even though the opponents in that
case, AMP, had claimed, as in this case (see [7] above), that the “GLAMOUR”
mark had been registered in several other countries. Furthermore, it bears
mention also that, as stated at paras 10 and 11 of the statutory declaration
declared in Japan on 5 December 2006 by Mr Noriyuki Yamagani (see [8] above),
that AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark in Class 16 covering:

Printed matter (magazines, newsletters and books; computer programs); paper
products (posters, paper patterns)

and Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in Class 16 covering:

Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of
paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;
paper patterns; tailors’ chalk, table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;
banners of papers; flags of paper; baggage tags; printed matter; paintings and
calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands; playing cards; stationery
and study materials

have in fact _co-existed_ on the United Kingdom Trade Marks Register since
2001.

Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b) TMA

92 For all the foregoing reasons, I was thus of the view that AMP’s opposition
to the registration of Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark in Class 16
pursuant to s 8(2)(_b_) TMA should _not_ succeed. The PAR’s decision on this
provision was accordingly _reversed_. I now proceed to examine AMP’s
opposition pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.

AMP’s opposition under s 8(4) TMA

93 As stated above at [28], AMP contended that the PAR had erred in holding
that the law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the “HYSTERIC
GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.

94 It is trite that for AMP to succeed in an action for passing off, it had to
prove the following classical trinity of elements, _viz_ :

(a) a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods and services it supplies in
the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying “get-
up”, such that the “get-up” is recognised by the public as distinctive
specifically of AMP’s goods or services;

(b) a misrepresentation by Ozone to the public (whether or not intentional)
leading or likely to lead the public to believe that the goods offered by
Ozone are the goods of AMP; and

(c) that it is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief
engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation that the source of its goods is the
same as the source of those offered by AMP.

(See the decisions of the Court of Appeal in _Novelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts
Ltd and another_ [2009] 3 SLR 216 (“ _Amanresorts_ ”) at [36]-[37] and _City
Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier_ [2009] SGCA 53 (“ _City
Chain_ ”)). As these three elements were correctly identified by the PAR (see
[21] above), I needed only to examine whether the PAR had erred in _applying_
these three elements to the facts of the present case.

Element 1: Goodwill or reputation

95 In the submissions before me, goodwill and reputation were referred to
interchangeably. For present purposes, I will refer to goodwill only. The two
essential features of goodwill, which is a question of fact, were summarised
recently in _City Chain_ as follows:

62 In [_Amanresorts_] at [39], this court held that _the two essential
features of goodwill are that “it is the association of a good, service or
business on which the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, etc … has been
applied with a particular source” and “this association is an ‘attractive
force which brings in custom’”. Proving goodwill or distinctiveness is a
question of fact. Relevant factors include advertising, trading, volume of
sales, and whether it has been registered_. But the fact that the mark or
indicia is not novel does not mean that it cannot be distinctive of the
plaintiff’s goods or services (see _Halsbury Laws of Singapore_ vol 13(3)
(LexisNexis Singapore) at para 160.8172007). [emphasis added]

96 It bears mention that where a case involves indicia which are _descriptive_
of the goods or services in question (as in this case: see [69] above), the
law imposes a _higher_ burden on the plaintiff (_ie_ , AMP) when proving the
existence of his goodwill. The leading decision in this aspect is that of the
Court of Appeal in _Lifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd (trading as ONE.99
SHOP)_ [2000] 2 SLR 766 (“ _Lifestyle 1.99_ ”). The facts of and principles
stated in that case have been helpfully summarised in _Law of Intellectual
Property in Singapore_ at p 209 as follows:

**[17.1.15]** … The plaintiff was the owner of a chain of retail shops which
operate under the mark _ONE.99 SHOP_. These outlets sold goods ranging from
snack and other foodstuff to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery and
common household items. The important characteristic of the plaintiff’s
business was that all these goods were priced at S$1.99. The plaintiff was the
first in Singapore to start a ‘one-price store’ business. About 1-½ years
later, the defendant opened its retail outlets under the mark _Lifestyle 1.99_
, selling various goods sold at prices with 99 cents (S$1.99, S$3.99, to
S$9.99). On the question whether the plaintiff had acquired goodwill in the
mark _ONE.99 SHOP_ , the Court of Appeal laid down the legal principles as
follows:

(a) The law treats quite differently the mark of a business depending on
whether the mark is descriptive or ‘fancy’.

(b) A mark which is _prima facie_ descriptive will only be protected if it can
be shown to have acquired a ‘secondary meaning’, that is, it has becomes
distinctive of the plaintiff’s business. ‘Distinctive’ is a term of art in the
law of passing off. In relation to a mark, this means that the mark denotes
the goods of the plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders.

(c) The fact that a mark is descriptive does not mean that it cannot become
distinctive, although it would be difficult to prove. A very great burden is
placed on the plaintiff to prove that the mark has acquired a secondary
meaning.

…

97 In a similar vein, in _Johnson & Johnson_, where the registered mark was
“Carefree” and the mark sought to be registered was “Careree”, the court
noted:

24 _In regard to goodwill, it must [be] borne in mind that “Carefree” is a
descriptive word and while it is possible for a descriptive word to become
associated with goodwill, the courts are slow to allow anyone to claim a
monopoly of descriptive words_ : see _Nippon Paint (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v
ICI Paint (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ [2001] 1 SLR 1 and _Super Coffeemix
Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte Ltd_ [2000] 3 SLR 145. All the same, in
appropriate cases, the courts have held that descriptive words have taken on a
“secondary meaning” or become “distinctive in fact”. An example is
“Mothercare”, which is synonymous with the company that sells clothes for
pregnant women and young children. … [emphasis added]

98 In the present case, bearing in mind the _greater_ burden of proof on AMP
(in light of my earlier finding that the “GLAMOUR” word mark is purely
descriptive: see [69] above), I was of the view that the PAR had _erred_ in
concluding that there was goodwill (see [22] above). Given the unsatisfactory
nature of the evidence tendered by AMP to show volume of sales (_viz_ , the
nine invoices: see [70] above) as elaborated above at [71] and the lack of
evidence of _any_ promotions or advertisements undertaken by AMP in Singapore,
it cannot be said that the “GLAMOUR” word mark has acquired a “secondary
meaning”. As the PAR observed:

88 [AMP claims] that the use in Singapore started from 1984, but there does
not seem to be good evidence that the magazines started selling in Singapore
from that time, only a table and random invoices that do not date beyond the
year 2000. [Ozone states] that the circulation numbers for Singapore are not
impressive, 903 copies at its highest only. The Opponents have submitted that
this is high relative to the numbers of other publications that are sold, as
evidenced by the invoices from their distributors. _However, the number 903
copies sounds to me like a number that is disproportionately low for the
population of Singapore that is around 3 million at that time_.

…

93 … [T]_he circulation numbers in Singapore are unimpressive, and there is no
advertising in Singapore to increase its recognition of [AMP’s] marks_.
[emphasis added]

99 The paucity of evidence in the present case must be contrasted with the
ample evidence in _Lifestyle 1.99_ of the plaintiff’s goodwill. As stated in
_Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore_ at pp 210-211:

[**17.1.18**] In [_Lifestyle 1.99_], the plaintiff succeeded in discharging
this higher burden of proof. The court was impressed with the plaintiff’s
sales turnover (S$10.4m in the first two years of operation was substantial in
the light of the very low price of each item), the extensive advertisements
and media coverage on the plaintiff’s business, and the fact that some 48% of
the people surveyed were aware or had heard of the _One.99 Shop_ and at least
40% knew where the outlets were located. The court found that all this
evidence pointed to some goodwill in the plaintiff’s business. …

100 In these circumstances, I was of the view that AMP had failed to establish
the element of goodwill (see [94(a)] above). In the light of this conclusion,
there was no need for me to set out my views on the second element of
misrepresentation (see [94(b)] above) but I shall do so for the sake of
completeness.

Element 2: Misrepresentation

101 With regard to the element of misrepresentation, the learned author of
_Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore_ notes at p 225 (footnotes
omitted):

**[18.0.1]** The key element here is deception. The court is concerned with
the following question: _has the defendant made a false representation that
led to, or is likely to lead, to deception or confusion amongst the public?
The nature of the deception or confusion may relate to the trade source of the
goods or services, or to the quality of the goods or services. …_

**[18.0.2]** _Although the key element is deception, it is not necessary to
prove that the defendant has an intention to deceive or mislead the public_.
For this reason, it has been said that _the state of the mind of the defendant
is immaterial; rather, what matters is the impact on the persons to whom the
misrepresentation is addressed_. If the impact on these persons is such that
they would be deceived, the element of misrepresentation is made out and the
defendant cannot avoid a finding of passing off by the mere fact that his
goods are of as good or better quality than the plaintiff’s, or that the
misrepresentation was made innocently.

[emphasis added]

102 It would also be useful to refer to _Amanresorts_ which confirms that
confusion is an essential element of the tort of passing off. As stated in the
headnote:

(4) On the issue of misrepresentation, the _target audience of
misrepresentation in a passing off action was the actual and potential
audience of the claimant. Misrepresentation was actionable only if it caused
confusion and while there was no need to show_ actual _confusion, the court
had to assess whether there was a_ likelihood _of confusion from the
surrounding facts, based on the average reasonable person, with
characteristics reflective of the relevant section of the public_. Relevant
factors in this case included whether there was any fraudulent intention in
using the name “Amanusa” for the housing project, and whether the business of
the Appellant and the Respondents were in the same field or closely related
fields. The identical names, the similar Balinese themes, and the presentation
of the Appellant’s housing project as high-quality accommodation were factors
increasing the likelihood of confusion… [emphasis added]

103 Be that as it may, where a _descriptive_ mark is adopted by a plaintiff, a
_slight_ difference between the plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s mark is
sufficient to distinguish them and to undo any possibility of confusion in the
mark (see _Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore_ at p 211, para 17.1.18,
and _Lifestyle 1.99_ at [39]).

104 In the present case, the PAR had concluded that there was no
misrepresentation because Ozone was not attempting to “mislead or deceive the
public as to the origin of the goods”:

101 In the present case, I have made the decision that the marks are
confusingly similar for the purposes of Section 8(2). However, in paragraph 78
above, I had described that it does not appear to me, on the evidence, that
there is any effort to imply that the Applicants’ mark is a spin-off mark.
Each of [Ozone’s] and [AMP’s] advertising retain its own special flavour, with
no attempt to copy each other’s style. _This evidence also goes to show that
there is clearly no misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt where
[Ozone is] trying to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the
goods_. [emphasis added]

105 The PAR had made his ultimate finding that there was no misrepresentation
on the basis that there was no attempt on the part of Ozone to mislead or
deceive the public as to the origin of the goods. This basis of the PAR’s
conclusion was incorrect because with regard to the element of
misrepresentation, what the courts are concerned with is the effect of Ozone’s
conduct on the actual and potential audience of AMP (see [102] above) and
there can be a misrepresentation even if it was made _innocently_ (see
_Johnson & Johnson_ at [25]). On the other hand, Ozone’s state of mind would
have been a relevant consideration in finding an increased likelihood of
confusion if Ozone had been found (there was no evidence of this in this case)
to have had an intention to mislead or deceive. As noted in _Law of
Intellectual Property in Singapore_ at pp 230-231:

**[18.4.6]** Proof of an intention to deceive is not a necessary ingredient in
this second element, but if such an intention is established, the burden on
the plaintiff to show confusion is lessened. …

106 AMP contended that the PAR had “committed a further material error of
principle by restricting his analysis to whether there was any confusion…to
the origin of the goods as evident from his conclusion that `there is no
attempt where [Ozone was] trying to mislead or deceive the public as to the
_origin of the goods_ ’. [emphasis added]. According to AMP, the “PAR’s
restriction of the analysis as such defies established law that confusion
under the law of passing off is not limited to confusion as to the origin of
[Ozone’s] goods”.

107 I accepted the _general_ principle that the nature of the confusion may
relate to the trade source of the goods or services _or_ to the quality of the
goods. As stated in _Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore_ at pp 226-228:

**18.2** **MISREPRESENTATION AS TO ORIGIN**

**[18.2.1]** _The nature of the deception or confusion may relate to the trade
source of the goods or services, or to the quality of the goods or services.
Misrepresentation as to the trade source can take the form of a false
representation that the defendant’s goods or services are those of the
plaintiff, or that the two parties are connected in some way, for example, the
defendant’s business is an extension, branch or other agency of the
plaintiff’s_.

…

**18.3** **MISREPRESENTATION AS TO QUALITY**

**[18.3.1]** _Inherent within a misrepresentation as to the source of the
goods or services is an element of misrepresentation about the quality of the
goods or services. The consumer buying the defendant’s goods thinks that he is
getting the quality that he is accustomed to finding in the plaintiff’s
goods_. Here the objection is that the defendant is making a misrepresentation
about the _quality of his own goods_.

**[18.3.2]** It is also possible for the defendant to make a misrepresentation
about the quality of the _plaintiff’s_ goods…

[emphasis added]

108 At [96] above, I had stated that because the present case involved indicia
which was descriptive of the goods in question, a higher burden was imposed on
AMP in proving the existence of goodwill. This higher burden of proof is
_also_ extended to the element of misrepresentation, as noted in _Law of
Intellectual Property in Singapore_ at pp 230-231:

**18.4** **PROVING MISREPRESENTATION**

…

**[18.4.7]** _When the plaintiff’s mark or get-up has descriptive connotations
or functional value, the principle that the plaintiff bears a higher burden of
proof to show goodwill is extended to the second element: the burden of proof
on the plaintiff to show confusion is also heavier. The courts will readily
regard a slight difference between the plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s
mark as being sufficient to distinguish them_. [_Lifestyle 1.99_] is a classic
illustration of this principle. … [emphasis added]

109 In my view, it was clear however that contrary to AMP’s contention (see
[106] above), the PAR had _not_ restricted his analysis to only whether there
was any confusion to the origin of the goods but had also considered and
rejected AMP’s argument that there had been a misrepresentation as to quality,
albeit in the context of the third element of “damage” (see [103]-[105] of the
GD cited at [24] above). Bearing in mind the higher burden of proof on the
shoulders of AMP and the PAR’s finding in this aspect, I was of the opinion
that there had been no misrepresentation as to quality. I now move on to
consider whether there had been a misrepresentation as to the trade source of
the goods.

110 In this case, while I accepted that the proximity of a defendant’s field
of activity to a plaintiff’s is a relevant consideration in deciding whether
there is likelihood of confusion (see _Law of Intellectual Property in
Singapore_ at p 231, para 18.4.8 and _Amanresorts_ at para 84), and that there
was _some_ proximity between Ozone’s field of activity (_viz_ , the design and
retailing of _fashion_ apparel and _fashion_ accessories for both men and
women: see [8] above) and AMP’s field of activity (_viz_ , the “GLAMOUR” mark
primarily being used in conjunction with the “GLAMOUR” magazine which is
devoted to the reporting and portraying of, _inter alia_ , contemporary
women’s _fashion_ and beauty: see [7] above) in that both relate to “fashion”,
given that:

(a) the word marks of Ozone and AMP were visually _dissimilar_ (see [53]
above) and aurally _dissimilar_ (see [56] above);

(b) “GLAMOUR” is merely descriptive and _not_ inherently distinctive nor
distinctive by use (see [73] above);

(c) a higher burden of proof is imposed on AMP (see [108] above); and

(d) Ozone’s other goods were _different_ from AMP’s goods (_viz_ , “magazines
books and publications”) (see [80] above),

I was of the opinion that the element of misrepresentation was also not
satisfied _vis-à-vis_ Ozone’s other goods.

111 With regard to “printed matter”, bearing in mind Ozone’s concession of an
overlap between “printed matter” and AMP’s “magazines, books and publications”
but taking into account [110(a)]-[110(c)], I was of the view that, on balance,
the element of misrepresentation was also not made out.

Element 3: Damage

112 With regard to the element relating to the question of damage, this was
accepted by Ozone if the first two elements were made out.

Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(4) TMA

113 For all the foregoing reasons, I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s
eventual conclusion that AMP’s ground of opposition under s 8(4) TMA was not
made out and must fail.

Conclusion

114 Given my conclusion that AMP’s opposition pursuant to ss 8(2)(_b)_ and
8(4) TMA must fail , I allowed Ozone’s appeal and reversed the PAR’s decision
dated 16 March 2009. In so doing, I ordered that:

(a) Ozone’s Trade Mark Application No T02/03173J for the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”
word mark be allowed to proceed to registration;

(b) the costs awarded to AMP in the hearing before the PAR be set aside; and

(c) the costs of this appeal and the costs of the hearing before the PAR be
paid by AMP to Ozone.
