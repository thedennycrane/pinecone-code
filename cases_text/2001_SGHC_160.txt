(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was a show-cause
proceeding brought by the Law Society under s 98(1) of the Legal Profession
Act (Cap 161, 1994 Ed) (`the Act`) against the respondent, Lim Kiap Khee, an
advocate and solicitor that he be dealt with under the Act for misconduct.
Upon hearing counsel for the Society, and the respondent not appearing, we
ordered that the respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and
solicitors. We now give our reasons.  
  
**_Cause for complaint_**

****

The respondent was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court
on 16 January 1974. He had since 25 April 1997 ceased to practise law. At all
material times he was the sole proprietor of his own legal firm M/s Lim Kiap
Khee & Co. The disciplinary action arose out of a complaint, dated 11 March
1999, lodged by Wearnes Development (Pte) Ltd (`Wearnes`) against the
respondent for having breached an undertaking (`the undertaking`) given to
Wearnes by the respondent on 27 April 1995 as a solicitor.  
  
The undertaking was given by the respondent in the following circumstances.
Wearnes were the developers of a detached house at No 6 Cornwall Gardens (`the
property`). On 21 June 1994, Wearnes sold the property at a public auction to
Lum Kok Seng and Chin Leng Kee (`original purchasers`) at a price of
$7,860,000. On 23 November 1994 the original purchasers sub-sold the property
to Shyam Mangharam Ganglani (`sub-purchaser`). The sub-purchaser was
represented by the respondent in the transaction.  
  
Under cl 5(1)(j) of the original sale and purchase agreement, the last 15% of
the purchase price was to be paid in the following manner:

> _On completion of the sale and purchase of the property in accordance with
> clause 16 hereof, the purchaser shall pay to the vendor the balance of the
> fifteen (15) per cent of the purchaser price which shall be dealt with as
> follows:_

> _
>
> (aa) two (2) per cent of the purchase price shall be paid forthwith to the
> Vendor;
>
> (ab) the remaining thirteen (13) per cent of the purchase price shall be
> paid to the Purchaser`s Solicitors as stakeholders to be dealt with as
> follows:
>
> (i) eight (8) per cent of the purchase price shall be paid to the Vendor
> within seven (7) days of the receipt by the Purchaser or his solicitors of
> the Certificate of Statutory Completion of the building issued by the
> Building Authority or a photographic copy thereof duly certified as a true
> copy by the Vendor`s solicitors;
>
> (ii) five (5) per cent of the purchase price or any balance thereof (after
> any deduction has been made in accordance with clause 20 hereof and for
> moneys owing to the Purchaser) shall be paid to the Vendor on the expiry of
> 12 months from the date of notice to take vacant possession to the
> Purchaser.
>
> _

  
  
By the end of November 1994, construction of the property was completed. On 2
December 1994, Wearnes gave notice to the original purchasers to take vacant
possession of the property and forwarded therewith the temporary occupation
permit. Accordingly under cl 5(1)(j)(ab)(ii) the last 5% of the purchase price
was to be paid upon expiry of 12 months from the date of notice. It was
generally accepted that the 5% payment should be made on 1 December 1995.  
  
In the meantime, on 31 March 1995, Wearnes served a notice to complete on the
original purchasers` solicitors. Later by mutual agreement, the date for
completion was extended to 31 May 1995. On 29 April 1995, through a tripartite
transfer, the sale of the property was completed in favour of the sub-
purchaser. In accordance with cl 5(1)(j), 2% of the last 15% of the purchase
price was paid on that day. With regard to tbe balance 13%, it was mutually
agreed that the respondent`s firm would step into the shoes of the original
purchasers` solicitors and hold that sum and release it to Wearnes as provided
in cl 5(1)(j)(ab). This was evidenced by a written undertaking dated 27 April
1995 given by the respondent`s firm to Wearnes. There could not be any doubt
that the undertaking was given by the respondent, as the sole proprietor of
his firm, in his capacity as solicitor. As the substance of the complaint
concerned this undertaking, we shall set out the letter in extenso:

> _We confirm that we are holding the sum of $1,021,800-00 as stakeholders._

> _We undertake to release the sum of $1,021,800-00 as follows:-_

> _
>
> (a) **_$628,800.00_** shall be paid to you **_within seven (7) days_** of
> receipt by us of a copy of the Certificate of Statutory Completion relating
> to the property; and
>
> (b) **_$393,000.00_** or any balance thereof (after any deduction has been
> made in accordance with clause 20 of the Special Conditions and for moneys
> owing to Lum Kok Seng and Chin Leng Kee) shall be paid to you on or before
> **_1st December 1995_**.
>
> _

  
  
On 14 August 1995, Wearnes` solicitors forwarded to the respondent`s firm the
certificate of statutory completion issued by the competent authority on 28
July 1995. Following this, and in accordance with cl 5(1)(j)(ab)(i), 8% of the
purchase price should be paid over to Wearnes within seven days of 14 August
1995, ie by 21 August 1995. No such payment was, however, made by the
respondent`s firm to Wearnes. Instead on the same day, 14 August 1995, the
respondent wrote to Wearnes` solicitors alleging that his client, the sub-
purchaser, had `found several defects due to defective workmanship and/or the
quality of material used in the construction of the property`. On 16 August
1995, Wearnes` solicitors reminded the respondent of his undertaking and that
under cl 5(1)(j) deduction for defects could only be made from the last 5% of
the purchase price. Notwithstanding this clarification, the respondent`s firm
persisted in its refusal to pay. A further reminder was sent on 11 September
1995. It was only on 19 October 1995, a delay of almost two months, that the
respondent`s firm paid out the 8% to Wearnes.  
  
Wearnes also complained in relation to the payment of the last 5% of the
purchase price. On this, Wearnes solicitors wrote on 19 November 1995 to the
respondent`s firm reminding the latter that payment of the 5% was due on 1
December 1995. Thereafter some correspondence ensued on the question of
defects. But Wearnes maintained that there were no outstanding defects for
which they were liable. On 6 August 1996, Wearnes instituted an originating
summons to claim payment for the last 5% against both the sub-purchaser and
the respondent and also for interest for the late payment of the 8%. On 4
November 1997, the High Court gave judgment in favour of Wearnes where, inter
alia, the respondent`s firm was ordered to make payment of $210,000 to
Wearnes. In addition the respondent`s firm and the sub-purchaser were required
to pay interest on late payment. As no payment was forthcoming, bankruptcy
proceedings were commenced by Wearnes against the respondent and the sub-
purchaser. On 12 February 1999, bankruptcy orders were made against them. It
was only on 28 June 1999 that the respondent made payment of $210,000 to
Wearnes` solicitors. A month later, he made payment in respect of late
interest and costs.  
  
**_Charges against the respondent_**

****

Before the Disciplinary Committee (`DC`), chaired by Mr TPB Menon, three
charges were preferred against the respondent and they were:

> _First Charge_

> (1990) (Revised Edition)._

  
  
We should add that the third charge was preferred by the Law Society during
the course of the DC proceedings.  
  
**_Absence of the respondent_**

****

The DC heard the matter over four days, namely, on 5 October, 19 October, 29
November and 12 December 2000. At none of these hearings was the respondent
present, nor was he represented by counsel, as he could not be contacted at
either his last known residential or business address. The DC even inserted
notices of the disciplinary hearings in both The Straits Times and The New
Straits Times (Malaysia) to notify the respondent of the same. However, they
were of no avail.  
  
The only provision in the Act which touches on the question of service is s
104 and it reads:

> _If the person whose conduct is the subject of inquiry fails to attend
> before the court, a Disciplinary Committee, the Council or the Inquiry
> Committee, as the case may be, the inquiry or proceedings may be proceeded
> with without further notice to that person upon proof of service by
> affidavit or statutory declaration._

  
  
There was affidavit evidence before us showing the services effected on the
respondent in relation to both the hearing before the DC as well as before us.
It seemed to us that the respondent did not wish to partake in any
disciplinary action which would be instituted against him. Thus, he was not
present before us; nor was he represented by counsel to make submission on his
behalf.  
  
**_Findings of the DC_**

****

The DC, after due deliberation, found that there existed cause of sufficient
gravity for disciplinary action against the respondent under s 83 of the Act
on all the three charges. On the first two charges, the DC found him to be in
clear breach of the undertaking which he gave on 27 April 1995. As regards the
third charge, while finding that the respondent was guilty of the charge,
having contravened s 83(2)(j), the DC noted that there was insufficient
evidence to show whether the $393,000, or indeed any part of the $1,021,800
constituting the 13% of the purchase price, was ever deposited into the client
account of the respondent`s firm prior to 25 April 1997, the date on which the
respondent ceased to practise. But the evidence before the DC showed clearly
that when the respondent ceased practise on 25 April 1997, the 5%, amounting
to $393,000, was not deposited into the client account of the respondent`s
firm.  
  
**_Grossly improper conduct_**

****

On the facts as we have enumerated above, there can be no doubt that the
misconduct enumerated in the three charges brought against the respondent had
been amply established. The only question we needed to address was, in
relation to the first two charges, whether the conduct constituted grossly
improper conduct under s 83(2)(b) or misconduct unbefitting an advocate and
solicitor under s 83(2)(h), and in relation to the third charge whether the
breach of r 3 of the Legal Profession (Solicitors` Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R
8, 1990 Ed) (`the Rules`) constituted conduct unbefitting an advocate and
solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(h).  
  
Grossly improper conduct had been described by Wee Chong Jin CJ in **Re
Marshall David** [1972-1974] SLR 132  [1972] 2 MLJ 221  at 224 as `conduct
which is dishonourable to him as a man and dishonourable in his profession`.
The origin of this description is to be found in the speech of Lord Esher in
**Re Cooke** [1889] 5 TLR 407 at 408. However, Lord Esher also said that it
would not suffice if the conduct was only such as to support an action for
negligence or want of skill. Lord Esher did not address the point whether to
constitute grossly improper conduct there must always be an intention to
deceive.  
  
In **Rajasooria v Disciplinary Committee** [1955] 1 WLR 405 Lord Cohen,
delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said that they did not `read
into Lord Esher`s words a statement that a finding that intention to deceive
is always an essential element in grossly improper conduct`.  
  
The approach taken in **_Rajasooria_** was adopted by this court of three
judges in **Re Han Ngiap Juan** [1993] 2 SLR 81  where the misconduct in
question was in overcharging a client in relation to a conveyancing
transaction and where there was no finding of any element of deceit. There,
this court stated (at p 88):

> _The passage is not without its difficulties but on the whole it appears to
> us to be a general statement of principle that an intention to deceive is
> not necessarily always an element of grossly improper conduct, even though
> in**Rajasooria** `s case itself, the Board was of the view that some element
> of deceit was involved, and the statement of principle might therefore be
> obiter. Even so, we are in full agreement with this statement of principle._

  
  
Finally we would refer to an earlier local case, **Re Seow Francis T**
[1972-1974] SLR 469  [1973] 1 MLJ 199  where a solicitor gave an undertaking
that he would hand over all relevant books and files to the police in relation
to a criminal case against his partner. He did not conduct a search for the
documents and instead relied upon that partner to hand the documents over.
Certain files were as a result not handed over. His negligence in relying upon
the efforts of the partner, was held to constitute culpable negligence and
thus amounted to grossly improper conduct. In coming to this conclusion, the
court did not refer to any authority but had described his conduct as `gross
failure ... to honour his undertaking`.  
  
We would reiterate our views on **_Han Ngiap Juan_** (supra) that intention to
deceive need not be present to constitute grossly improper conduct. This is
consistent with s 83(2)(b) which refers to `fraudulent or grossly improper
conduct`. If deception is always necessary to constitute grossly improper
conduct, the legislature would not, in that provision, have distinguished
`grossly improper` conduct from `fraudulent` conduct. On the other hand, while
simple negligence or want of skill would not, as pointed out by Lord Esher,
constitute grossly improper conduct, it must also be recognised that there are
degrees of negligence. Furthermore, the gravity of a negligent act must be
viewed in the context of the matter, taking into account all the circumstances
of the case.  
  
We noted that how negligence on the part of a solicitor was regarded was not
uniform in various jurisdictions. On the one hand, in the Canadian case, **Re
A Solicitor** [1936] 1 DLR 368, even gross negligence were held not to amount
to professional misconduct. However, in New Zealand, in **Re M** [1930] NZLR
285, it was said that the failure of the solicitor to have his trust accounts
audited amounts to professional misconduct. The New Zealand Court of Appeal
held that neglect amounted to professional misconduct. In **Re A Solicitor**
[1972] 2 All ER 811, where a solicitor was in breach of the accounts rules,
Lord Denning said that `negligence in a solicitor may amount to professional
misconduct if it is inexcusable and is such as to be regarded as deplorable by
his fellows in the profession`. In our judgment, it is in the public interest
to adopt a standard which would encourage members of the profession to
maintain a high degree of professionalism and diligence at all times. It is
not possible to generalise how an individual act of neglect is to be regarded
except in its context.  
  
Reverting to the circumstances of the present case, to characterise the
failure of the respondent to pay up the 8% and the 5% to Wearnes on due dates
as mere negligence would be a gross understatement. The respondent had
confirmed that he was holding the money ($1,021,800) and would pay to Wearnes
in accordance with cl 5(1)(j). He was reminded to pay on the due dates and yet
failed to do so. The failure was clearly not due to an oversight. It was, in
each instance, a deliberate act on his part to disregard the undertaking he
had given. It is of the utmost importance that a solicitor should abide by the
undertaking he formally gives. It is the very foundation of an honourable
profession that its members act honourably. To deliberately breach an
undertaking solemnly given would seriously undermine the integrity of the
profession and would bring it into disrepute. Such a conduct, in our opinion,
clearly constitutes grossly improper conduct, especially in the circumstances
here where the respondent did not even bother to explain himself. We need
hardly explain that once a misconduct constitutes grossly improper conduct,
that act would, ipso facto, be an act unbefitting an advocate and solicitor
under s 83(2)(h): see **Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing** [2000] 2 SLR
165 .  
  
**_Contravention of r 3_**

****

The third charge relates to a contravention of r 3 of the Rules, which
provides that:

> _Subject to rule 9, every solicitor who holds or receives client`s money, or
> money which under rule 4 he is permitted and elects to pay into a client
> account, shall without delay pay such money into a client account._

  
  
The exception in r 9 has no relevance to the facts of the present case.  
  
By the respondent`s letter of undertaking dated 27 April 1995 the respondent
stated that he had received the sum of $1,021,800 from the client and would be
holding the same as stakeholder. On the date the respondent ceased practising
as an advocate and solicitor he had not arranged to have the 5% payment,
amounting to $393,000, paid into the client account of his firm.  
  
While one may be tempted to think, on first blush, that a breach of this rule
is really something quite technical but this is not so when one considers the
rationale behind that rule. We would merely wish to reiterate what this court
stated in relation to this rule in the case **Law Society of Singapore v Prem
Singh** [1999] 4 SLR 157  at [para ]22:

> _Rule 3 of the Legal Profession (Solicitors` Accounts) Rules prescribes a
> mandatory requirement that the client`s funds be placed into a separate
> account. The purpose of this rule is to protect the public and to instil
> public confidence in solicitors. If a member of the public is going to
> deposit his funds with a solicitor, there has to be some form of assurance
> that the funds will be well protected in a separate client account and will
> not be misappropriated. In our opinion, the respondent`s omission to place
> the funds in his client account was a serious breach of the Legal Profession
> (Solicitors` Accounts) Rules._

  
  
We accordingly confirmed the DC`s finding that this contravention of r 3 on
the part of the respondent constituted a `serious breach` and we held that he
was guilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor.  
  
**_Penalty_**

****

We now turn to the question of penalty. Under the Act the court has the power,
upon due cause shown, of either censuring the member, or suspending him for up
to five years or striking him off the roll. Ordinarily, where the misconduct
does not involve fraud or intention to deceive, striking off would not be
imposed. But this is not an absolute rule. Ultimately, it is the gravity of
the misconduct, or where there is more than one act of misconduct, the
totality of them all which will be determinative. Equally relevant here is the
presence of antecedents.  
  
We noted that in relation to the first two charges, the two sums due were
eventually paid to Wearnes. But in relation to the second charge, payment was
only made after considerable delay and after enforcement actions had been
taken out by Wearnes, including the institution of bankruptcy proceedings. The
gravamen of the first two charges was in the breach of a solemn undertaking
given by the respondent in his professional capacity. What was really
aggravating was the fact that the breach was not brought about by an oversight
but was indeed deliberate. Thus, in the context of an honourable profession,
where a member`s word should be his bond, such a breach undermines the
integrity of the profession and brings it into disrepute. In relation to the
payment of the 5%, if it were in fact true that there was a genuine dispute
between the sub-purchaser and Wearnes as to defects, the correct thing for the
respondent to do would have been to take out an interpleader summons.  
  
There were three other factors which were also relevant and which we had taken
into consideration in determining the penalty. First, counsel for the Law
Society had brought to our attention the fact that the respondent had been
suspended from practice for a period of one year in relation to an earlier and
unrelated set of misconduct offences (five charges altogether) under s
83(2)(b) where he issued bills of costs, incurred by one company, to another
company for whom no services were rendered. Section 83(5) permits this court
to take such antecedents into account. He ceased practising on 25 April 1997
because of that suspension order which was made by the court on 24 April 1997.
Second, at the time of the misconduct, the respondent was an experienced
lawyer of more than 20 years` standing. Third, the respondent had totally
ignored these proceedings and had not sought to mitigate. There were no
mitigating factors placed before us. Therefore, in all the circumstances, it
was our judgment that the respondent should be struck off the roll and we did
so order. He was also ordered to bear the costs of the proceedings.  
  
**Outcome:**

Order accordingly.
