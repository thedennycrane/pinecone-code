Prosecution Case

2\. The facts adduced in evidence by the prosecution which were not disputed
were that on or about 11 April 2000 the Accused was residing alone in Blk 6
Jalan Minyak #12-362 (flat #12-362). At about 5.45 p.m. a surveillance party
from Central Narcotic Bureau (CNB) kept watch over the flat and its vicinity.
At 5.40 p.m. the Accused and one Abdul Rahman Bin Mohd Noor (‘Abdul Rahman’)
were seen by CNB officers emerging from the lift landing of Blk 6. The Accused
was seen carrying a brown paper bag by Senior Staff Sergeant Henry Tan Yian
Chye (‘SSSgt Henry Tan’). He identified the brown bag with the wording
‘CAPTIONS’ across it as **Exh. P63**. The Accused and Abdul Rahman met up with
one Zamri Bin Mohd Ali (‘Zamri’) who was at the void deck. Moments later Zamri
and the Accused boarded the motor-lorry YD 8173P parked in front of Blk 6. The
driver of the lorry was Rumli Bin Sarib. Zamri sat in the front cabin of the
lorry next to the driver and the Accused sat on his right next to the left
door of the lorry. There were already two other passenger seated in the rear
carriage of the lorry namely, Ng Sick Yong (‘Ng’) and Jaseni Bin Latip
(‘Jaseni’). The lorry then drove off travelling down York Hill and turning
into Chin Swee Road followed by CNB officers. Shortly after that one Abdul
Rahman Bin Mohamad Noor who had been left behind inadvertently was seen
boarding the lorry along Chin Swee Road.

3\. At about 6.05 p.m. the lorry was intercepted by CNB officers along Kallang
Bahru near a JTC flatted factory. Insp Herman Bin Mohamed Hamli (‘Insp
Herman’) from the Special Task Force of the CNB and other CNB officers
arrested all the six persons travelling in the lorry including the driver.
SSSgt Henry Tan on inspecting the front cabin of the lorry saw the brown paper
bag which he had earlier seen being carried by the Accused. It was resting in
the floor board in front of the seat which had been occupied by the Accused.
At 6.40 p.m. the lorry was driven to the JTC flatted factory car park. SSSgt
Ang Onn Tho (‘Jimmy Ang’) on the instructions of Insp Herman opened the brown
paper bag. In it were found:

> (i) 4 white envelopes believed to contain heroin
>
> (ii) a red plastic bag containing one sachet of heroin
>
> (iii) a wrapped newspaper containing 4 white envelopes believed to similar
> heroin

4\. Subsequently the Investigating officer Soh Thiam Loon examined the said
exhibits and found that each of the 4 envelopes lying in the brown bag had 10
sachets. There were another 10 sachets of the same kind of substance in each
of the 4 envelopes found in the newspaper making a total of 81 sachets.

4.1 A bunch of 3 keys including the key to the Accused’s flat were seized
among other belongings of the Accused such as, handphone and cash of $1702 at
the scene. Cash of $2758.60 belonging to the Accused was also recovered from
the Accused’s sisters house making the total cash recovered S$4460.60 at
(**Exh. P89**).

5\. At 7.55 p.m., Insp Herman and a team of CNB officers arrived at flat
#12-362 belonging to the Accused. The front door of the Accused’s flat was
padlocked and also key locked. The door was opened with the keys (**Exh.
P88**) seized from the Accused by Insp Herman. In the bedroom of the flat the
Accused indicated to Insp Herman to the area between the dressing table and
the wardrobe. Insp Herman recovered a white plastic bag with the word ‘Maxim
Cakes’ (**Exh. P85**) from the said area. The said plastic bag was found to
contain

> (i) 2 transparent plastic packets of substance believed to be heroin;
>
> (ii) 2 envelopes one containing 10 sachets and the other containing 2
> sachets of substance also believed to be heroin;
>
> (iii) a ‘TANITA’ digital weighing scale;
>
> (iv) two candles;
>
> (v) two metal spoons;
>
> (vi) two used envelopes;
>
> (vii) a stack of 9 envelopes and
>
> (viii) envelopes and a stack of 346 empty satchets.

5.1 In a carton in the cupboard near to the bed a white plastic bag (exhibit
P85) was recovered with five stacks of empty sachets totalling 2320 such
sachets. The Investigating officer testifying said that the empty sachets were
used for trafficking the drugs by repacking small quantity of heroin in them
of about 8 grams from the big packets and the candles were used for heat
sealing the sachets after repacking. The spoons were used to scoop up heroin
from the big packets and put into the sachets. The digital weighing scale was
to measure the amount of heroin put in each sachet.

6\. Dr Lee Tong Kooi (Dr Lee) a Scientific Officer attached to the Department
of Scientific Services (DSS) examined and qualitatively and quantitatively
analyzed the 81 sachets of granular/powdery substance found in the brown bag
on the floor board of the lorry opposite the seat where the Accused was
sitting (the subject matter of the 1st Charge). He determined the substance to
contain heroin and the total weight of the heroin was not less than 24.4 grams
as per his Certificates (**Exhs. P40 to P48**) issued under S16 of the Misuse
of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (‘MDA’).

6.1 Dr Lee similarly analyzed the granular/powdery substance in the two
transparent plastic packets with gross weight of 425.0 grams and 425.1 grams
each and the 12 sachets with a gross weight of 88.23 grams all of which were
found in the white plastic bag with the wording ‘Maxim Cakes’ in the Accused
bedroom (the subject matter of the 2nd Charge). He determined the substance to
contain heroin and the total weight of the heroin was not less than 77.40
grams (**Exhs. P49 to P52**).

6.2 Dr Lee also found the two spoons to be stained with heroin.

6.3 The Accused’s urine was tested and found negative for morphine, a by-
product of diamorphine.

7\. The Accused gave a number of statements on various dates to the police. He
did not challenge the admissibility of the statements. He conceded through his
counsel that they were voluntarily made. Nevertheless, I satisfied myself of
their voluntariness by requesting the prosecution to adduce _prima facie_
evidence of the same. The Accused’s Counsel did not question any witness nor
did the Accused proffer to give evidence. I therefore admitted that the
statement in evidence as I was satisfied for they were voluntarily made.

7.1 The statements admitted with a brief description of their content were:

> **

> P56
>
> ** \- Contemporaneous Statement recorded by Insp Herman on 11 April 2000 at
> 6.30 pm at JTC flatted factory carpark in Kallang Bahru.

> scene of his arrest the brown bag was his; that in the bag there were 80
> sachets. When asked from whom he got the heroin the Accused answered that he

> what he was going to do with the heroin his answer was that he wanted to

Prima Facie Case

**_

8\. On the witness’ evidence adduced by the prosecution and on the admissions
of the Accused as set out in his various police statements which I have set
out earlier I was _prima facie_ satisfied that the prosecution had proven that
both the brown bag (**Exh. P63**) he carried in the motorlorry YD 8173P and
the white plastic bag (**Exh. P85**) recovered in the Accused’s bedroom in
flat #12-362 had not less than 24.47 and 77.40 grams of diamorphine as
analyzed and deposed to by Dr Lee the Scientific Officer. Under Chapter S 17
(s) of the Misuse of Drugs Act possession of more than 2 grams of diamorphine
raised the presumption that the possession of diamorphine was for the purpose
of trafficking. I was further satisfied that the prosecution had _prima facie_
proved that the above amounts of diamorphine in each case were in the
possession of or control of the Accused. The Accused was seen bringing down
the brown bag (**Exh. P63**) from his flat #12-362 in which 24.47 grams of
diamorphine were found. On his own admission in his statement, **Exh. P60** ,
he said he brought down the brown bag (**Exh. P63**) and thereafter sat in the
front passenger cabin and kept the said bag between his legs. After his arrest
he also admitted that the said brown bag contained diamorphine and that he had
obtained it from one Ah Mike and that he understood he was given the
diamorphine to be repacked into the small sachets and thereafter he was to
return the repacked heroin to the aforesaid Ah Mike for which work he would be
paid S$1000.

9\. The Accused explanation in respect of the 77.40 grams of diamorphine found
in his bedroom was the same. He explained that he had received the two amounts
of diamorphine together in the morning of 11 April 2000 and he had separated
them i.e. putting aside the 77.40 grams of diamorphine contained in the white
plastic bag **Exh. P85** (2 transparent plastic packets and 2 envelopes) in
between a wardrobe and the dressing table.

10\. All these facts went to prove that the Accused had knowledge that the
contents of the aforesaid two bags concerning each of the charges was
diamorphine and that he was in control of such diamorphine. It was also _prima
facie_ proved by his admissions when read as a whole that the Accused had such
possession for the purpose of trafficking as he intended to repackage the
diamorphine and had partially repackaged the diamorphine and was on his way to
deliver some of that diamorphine, the subject matter of the 1st Charge as
requested by Ah Mike. Drug related paraphernalia was found in the flat for
repacking of the diamorphine consisting of heat sealing and more than 2,500
empty sachets and a weighing scale including diamorphine stained spoon all
indicating that the Accused had repackaged diamorphine. Complementing the
proof were the presumptions under the MDA. Apart from the presumption of S.17
as stated above the presumption in S 5(2) of the MDA stipulated that a person
commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his
possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.

11\. Therefore both on proof and presumption I was _prima facie_ satisfied
that the Accused was trafficking in the amount of heroin set out in each of
the two charges. It was for the Accused to prove otherwise on a balance of
probabilities. In the circumstances, I called upon him to enter his defence.

__****__

Defence

12\. On the Accused defence being called the Accused elected to remain silent.

__****__

Decision

13\. Counsel for the Defence submitted at the conclusion of the case that only
a case of possession of drugs was established against the Accused and the
Accused should only be found guilty of the lesser acts of possession in
respect of each charge. He went on to submit that the actual purpose of
possession was repackaging the diamorphine in question and for the repackaged
diamorphine to be returned to Ah Mike or his agent. He submitted that when the
MDA referred to the purpose of possession it must be the dominant purpose. The
dominant purpose was repacking and the secondary purpose was the return of the
repackaged drugs to its owner. The Accused would not know what the owner would
want to do with the repackaged drugs. As such, there was no trafficking by the
Accused.

13.1 I found the submission both novel and ingenious. I rejected the same. The
law was plainly set out in s 5(2) of the MDA and enunciated in _**Sze Siew
Luan**_ _**P P**_[1997] 2SLR 522 at 525 in which Yong C J stated as follows:

> " It is settled law that possession of drugs for the purpose of returning
> them to the owner is possession for the purpose of trafficking, for the
> bailee would eventually have to transfer possession back to the bailor."
>
> This was held by the Court of Appeal in _**Lee Yuan Kwang & Ors v P P**_
> [1995] 2SLR 349 at 368:
>
> Adopting the court’s interpretation of ‘deliver’ in Goh Hock Huat, he could
> not succeed in rebutting the presumption of possession of the drugs for the
> purpose of trafficking on the basis of the argument that ‘returning’ the
> drugs to Lee was not trafficking. By a future act which would transfer
> possession of the drugs to Lee, Yakoob would be admitting, in effect, that
> he would deliver the drugs to Lee, albeit at a subsequent time. The fact
> that this time had not yet arrived was immaterial because of s 5(2), the
> insertion of which was intended to clarify Parliament’s intention that once
> the presumption of trafficking was invoked, ‘there was no need to show the
> overt act of trafficking which he had intended to do."

14\. It was clear from the Prosecution’s evidence adduced that by a future
act, the Accused would be transferring possession of the repackaged
diamorphine to Ah Mike and the Accused was admitting as such that he had
_offered to deliver_ and _would deliver_ such diamorphine in respect of each
charge to Ah Mike - in respect of the 1st charge almost immediately and in
respect of the other charge subsequently when asked to by Ah Mike. Such an
intended delivery of the diamorphine on the part of the Accused evinced that
the Accused’s intention of having the diamorphine in his possession was for
the purpose of trafficking and the repacking into retail sized sachets of
about 8 grams each accentuated not diminished the purpose. The intended
eventual delivery was not of secondary significance and inconsequential to
trafficking as submitted by Defence Counsel but was in my opinion the
culminating act of trafficking.

15\. There was also no further evidence for me to consider that the Accused
was not trafficking in the said amount of diamorphine, the Accused having
remained silent. I also drew an adverse inference against the Accused upon his
refusal to take the stand under s 196(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code
(Cap 68) which states:

> "If the accused after being called upon by the court to give evidence or
> after he or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he
> will give evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed, the court, in
> determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw
> such inferences from the refusal as appear proper."

15.1 On a review of the whole evidence, I was satisfied that there was no
contrary indication that the presumption under s 5(2) of the MDA should not
apply. The evidence of the Prosecution not being controverted, I found the
Accused had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not
traffic in the diamorphine in respect of each of the charges upon which he was
tried.

16\. I therefore found him guilty in respect of each charge and convicted him
accordingly and sentenced him according to law.
