(delivering the judgment of the court): This is an appeal against the decision
of Goh Joon Seng J where he refused the appellant`s claim under an insurance
policy taken out with the respondents, an insurer. The central issue is on the
construction of a term in the policy relating to its scope.  
  
**_The background_**

****

The facts giving rise to the claim under the policy are largely undisputed. On
22 January 1992, Pan United Shipyard Pte Ltd (`Pan United`), who are shipping
builders and repairers, contracted with Ranger Shipping Pte Ltd (`Ranger
Shipping`) to convert a bulk carrier The Ikopa into a clean-product tanker
(`the conversion contract`). Under the conversion contract, the title and risk
in The Ikopa were vested in Pan United until delivery of the vessel was
effected to Ranger Shipping.  
  
On or about 25 January 1992, Pan United, acting through their brokers, Frank B
Hall insurance Brokers (S) Pte Ltd, obtained a Collective Policy of Insurance
(`the policy`) with the respondents (hereinafter called `the insured`), to
insure the vessel and the attendant risks. The policy covered risks during the
conversion of The Ikopa and was expressly stated to be subject to, inter alia,
the Institute Time Clauses (ITC) for Builders` Risks. Besides Pan United, the
insureds included Petroships Pte Ltd and/or Ranger Shipping and/or Asian Lift
Pte Ltd for their respective rights and interests. The policy was expressed to
cover `hull and machinery, equipment, outfits and everything connected
therewith in respect of a bulk carrier IKOPA to be converted to a clean
product tanker`.  
  
The conversion works to The Ikopa were done during the period from February
1992 to January 1993. As part of those works, grit blasting and spray painting
were carried out on the vessel. As it so happened, at the same period, a
yacht, the El Corsario (`the yacht`), was also undergoing warranty and docking
works at the neighbouring shipyard of Kvaerner Fjellstrand, which premises
were located next to Pan United.  
  
Some more than two years later, in June 1995, Pan United received a claim from
the owners of the yacht, Malec SA (`Malec`), alleging that the grit blasting
and spray painting works carried out by Pan United on The Ikopa had caused
damage to the yacht. The insurers were accordingly notified of the claim.
However, by a letter dated 4 October 1995, the insurers denied liability under
the policy on the grounds that firstly, the claim did not fall within the
scope of cl 19.1.1 of the policy and secondly, that even if it did, the
exemption in cl 19.3.10 applied to exclude the claim.  
  
On 31 August 1996, Malec, as the owners of the El Corsario, instituted Suit
1627/96 against the appellants and Kvaerner Fjellstrand, claiming for damage
caused to the yacht. Malec alleged that Pan United`s servants and/or agents
had been negligent in carrying out the grit blasting and spray painting works.
As the respondents had rejected liability to indemnify Pan United, the latter
conducted their own defence of the claim.  
  
On 6 February 1998, pending the hearing of Suit 1627/96, Pan United filed the
present proceedings against the insurers, claiming for, inter alia, a
declaration that, in the event that they were held liable for the claim made
by Malec, they were entitled to be indemnified by the insurers under cl 19 of
the policy.  
  
On 25 August 1998, Suit 1627/96 was eventually settled on the terms that the
claim of Malec against Pan United be dismissed but with no order as to costs.
Consequently, on 1 March 1999 the appellants amended their claim in the
present action and sought instead for a declaration that, pursuant to cl 19 of
the policy, they were entitled to be indemnified by the respondents for the
legal costs they had incurred in defending Suit 1627/96. The legal costs so
incurred amounted to $146,193.96.  
  
**_Relevant terms of the policy_**

case:

**_Decision below_ **

****

In the court below, the learned trial judge held that the indemnity which the
insurers provide under cl 19.1 is a limited one. It relates only to liability
arising `as owner of the vessel`. The claim of Malec arose out of alleged
negligent carrying out of the works by Pan United as repairers. The alleged
liability in no way arose on account of the fact that Pan United were the
owners of the vessel. Accordingly, he ruled that the claim does not come
within cl 19.1 and thus the insurers are not liable to indemnity Pan United.
He also went on to rule that even if he were wrong on that and that the
insurers were liable to so indemnify Pan United, the insurers` liability is
subject to the deduction of $50,000 as provided by cl 10.  
  
We should add that the insurers had also raised another ground to contend that
they were not liable. They said that the `pollution and contamination`
exemption provision in cl 19.3.10 would operate to exclude the claim. The
learned trial judge did not think it necessary to go into a consideration of
cl 19.3.10.  
  
**_Scope of cl 19.1_**

****

Before us the same issues mentioned in the preceding two paragraphs were
canvassed. We will first deal with the question of the extent of coverage
provided in cl 19.1, as it could be decisive. Before doing so, there is,
however, a preliminary point which we should briefly touch on. It would be
noted that the claim of Malec was eventually settled. Pan United did not have
to pay any compensation to Malec. But they did suffer losses to the extent of
having to incur legal costs. On the authority of **Forney v Dominion Insurance
Co Ltd** [1969] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 502, it is clear that if it is shown that the
insurers` denial of liability under cl 19.1 was wrongful then Pan United would
be entitled to claim from the insurers the legal costs incurred in resisting
Malec`s claim.  
  
The insurers` case is that in order for cl 19.1 to apply, it must be
established that the assured`s liability to a third party was incurred by the
assured `as owner of the vessel` and not in any other capacity. They contended
that for a claim to fall within cl 19.1 the character of the assured being the
`owner` of the vessel must be an essential ingredient giving rise to the
liability; it was not meant to be merely descriptive of the assured`s identity
or status. In support, they cited **Sturge v Hackett** [1962] 1 Lloyd`s Rep
117 and **Rigby & Anor v Sun Alliance & London Insurance Ltd** [1980] 1
Lloyd`s Rep 359, the two cases which were relied upon by the trial judge.  
  
In **_Sturge v Hackett_** , the insured sought indemnity under a Householder`s
Comprehensive Policy which covered his liability `as occupier` of a flat which
he had rented. The insured caused damage to the flat as a result of his
negligent act and was sued by the owner of the flat for the damage. In
determining whether the policy covered the damage caused, the court had to
consider whether the insured was liable `as occupier` of the flat. McNair J
held at p 124 that:

> _**the phrase `All sums for which the Assured (as occupier ...) may be held
> legally liable` in the section of the policy headed `Liability to the
> Public` clearly relates, and relates only, to a well-defined group of
> liabilities imposed upon occupiers of premises. The words `as occupier`
> connote that occupation is an essential ingredient of the liability and are
> not merely descriptive of the identity or status of the person to whom
> liability attaches** ... As it seems to me, the material words of the policy
> are words of `legal art` within the principle stated by Lord Sumner in
> **London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Co Ltd v Bolands Ltd** [1924] AC 836,
> at p 846, and cover those liabilities which the law imposes upon the
> occupier because he is the occupier and admit of no ambiguity. [Emphasis
> added.]_

  
  
On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld this construction of the words `as
occupier` (see **Sturge v Hackett** [1962] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 626) although the
appeal was allowed on a different point. Diplock LJ stated at p 631:

> _In our view, the learned judge was right in law in holding that the
> question whether Colonel Hackett`s liability falls within the occupier`s
> liability clause depends upon whether the fire that caused the damage
> started upon premises of which he was the occupier._

  
  
The approach taken in **_Sturge v Hackett_** was endorsed and followed in the
later case, **_Rigby & Anor v Sun Alliance & London Insurance Ltd _**, where
the court dealt with a policy on buildings which contained a clause that read:

> _Additional Protection ... the Company will pay to the Insured ... (13) the
> amount of claimant`s damages (including costs and expenses)**arising out of
> the Insured`s liability at law attaching solely as owner (not occupier) of
> the house** in respect of ... [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
The insured in that case had claims made against him by his neighbours because
of damage caused to their property by the encroachment of the roots of oak
trees on the insured`s land. The issue was whether the insured was entitled to
be indemnified under the policy for those claims. Mustill J was of the view
that the claims did not fall within the scope of the policy as they were not
of a type in which proof of ownership of the house by the insured was
necessary to establish the claim. This was how the learned judge construed the
relevant clause in the policy (at p 36):

> _**The liability must attach to the insured `as owner`. These words are apt
> to describe not the capacity of the insured or the history of the liability,
> but the character of the liability itself. To my mind, they denote that the
> status of the insured as owner is an integral part of the cause of action
> against him** , and not merely that in practice he would never have found
> himself in the position of receiving a claim and being held liable if he had
> not been the owner of the premises. This view corresponds with the opinions
> expressed on a very similar point by Mr Justice McNair and Lord Justice
> Diplock delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in **Sturge v
> Hackett** [1962] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 117 at p 124, and [1962] 1 WLR 1257.
> [Emphasis added.]_

  
  
Applying the principles enunciated in these two cases in the construction of
cl 19 of the subject policy, the learned trial judge ruled that the policy
could not be invoked by Pan United as liability for the claim brought by Malec
against Pan United did not depend on the fact that Pan United were the owners
of The Ikopa. The claim arose because of their liability as ship
repairers/builders.  
  
Pan United challenged the dichotomy drawn by the trial judge between acts of
the appellants as `owners of the vessel` and the appellants as `repairers of
the vessel`, a distinction they said is wholly unreal. They argued that at all
material times they were both the owners as well as the repairers of the
vessel. Thus, any purported distinction of their acts in those two capacities
would be quite errorneous. It could not have been the intention of the parties
to make such a distinction.  
  
On their part, Pan United relied upon the case of **Christmas v Taylor Woodrow
Civil Engineering Ltd & Anor** [1997] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 407. It concerned a
floating platform which was owned by the first defendants and was on demise
charter to the second defendants at the material time. The platform was
insured with the plaintiffs and both the defendants were named as the assureds
in the policy. The policy incorporated the Institute Time Clauses Hull Port
Risks which provided, inter alia,

> _
>
> 10.1 The Underwriters agree to indemnify the Assured for any sum paid by the
> Assured to any other person or persons by reason of the Assured becoming
> legally liable, as owner of the Vessel, for any claim, demand, damages
> and/or expenses, where such liability is in consequence of any of the
> following matters ... [para 4]. Including cover in respect of liability
> arising out of goods ... being lifted and/or transported mechanically or
> otherwise by the insured equipment and/or craft for the purpose of any
> contract for works or otherwise.
>
> _

  
  
At the relevant time, the second defendants were using the platform for a
crane to perform some works for a water authority. Under the contract, the
second defendants were required, on completion of the works, to clear away all
the material and rubbish from the work site. On the day of the incident, while
the platform was jacked up, it was struck by an exceptionally large wave which
lifted it off the legs, causing the crane to fall off the platform and sink.
Substantial expenses were incurred by the second defendants in removing the
crane from the seabed. They sought to recover the expenses from the plaintiffs
under the policy. The learned Deputy Judge (Kershaw QC) while noting that the
clause provided that the assured should become `legally liable as owner` and
the second defendants were only charterers, and not owners, nevertheless ruled
that the second defendants were entitled to be indemnified under the policy.
The learned judge held that the policy must be read as a whole and that the
word `owner` should be construed in the light of the fact that the second
defendants, the charterers, were also an assured under the policy.  
  
By analogy, Pan United contend that here the policy should be construed in the
light of the fact that Pan United, who were also named as one of the assureds
under the policy, were then both the owners and repairers. It was absurd to
say that the act giving rise to liability was that of a repairer rather than
an owner.  
  
It seems to us that Kershaw QC was able to reach the decision he did for two
reasons. First, he held that if there was any conflict between the standard
provisions of the Institute Time Clauses and the typed wording in the
condition, the standard clauses would have to give way to the typed
conditions. There, the charterers were named as an assured. Thus, the clause
should be suitably modified to take account of that. It should be construed to
mean that the charterers, as an insured, were to be indemnified against any
liabilities which they might be under, against which an owner would be
indemnified, if sued as owner. Second, the charterers became liable to remove
the crane from the seabed `not in any way as charterer or because it was a
charterer by demise and an owner would have been liable, but purely and simply
and solely because of its contractual obligation to the water authority.`.  
  
In **_The Institute Clauses_** by N Geoffrey Hudson and JC Allen (3rd Ed,
1999) the learned authors made the following comments in relation to the
phrase `by reason of the Assured becoming legally liable, as owners of the
vessel` in cl 19.1 of the ITC for Builders` Risk (at pp 241-242):

> _The nature of the liability which must attach to the assured in order to
> found a claim under this part of the clause differs from that which must
> attach to an assured under the Running Down Clause (RDC) in the Hull policy
> in two respects._

> _
>
> (a) it is wider than the RDC-type liability in that it is not limited to
> tortious liability, ie that which arises `by way of damages`; but
>
> (b) it is narrower, in that it must be liability which attaches to the
> assured `as owner of the vessel`.
>
> _

  
  
In making these commentaries, the learned authors relied upon **_Rigby v Sun
Alliance_** and **_Christmas v Taylor Woodrow_**.  
  
We think that **_Christmas v Taylor Woodrow_** can simply be explained on the
basis that the second defendants there were effectively the owners, having
demise chartered the platform. The charterers` liability would have been that
of the owner but for the demise charter, and as the charterers were named as
an assured, they must be viewed to have stepped into the shoes of the owner.
The nature of the liability there was not in question, unlike our present
case.  
  
With respect to counsel for Pan United, he failed to appreciate that the point
is not so much whether the act is an act of an owner or a builder/repairer but
the basis upon which the liability or loss arose. Did it arise because they
were the owners? That is the question. It is the capacity in which liability
is incurred that is crucial.  
  
Counsel also relied upon **Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen**
[1976] 3 All ER 570 to contend that in construing a commercial contract,
regard should be had to the factual background and the commercial purpose. We
do not dispute that. Indeed, insurance policies are to be construed according
to the principles of construction applicable to commercial contracts
generally. There are no peculiar rules of construction applicable to the terms
and conditions in a policy which are not equally applicable to the terms of
other commercial contracts. We also accept the principle that the literal
meaning of words should not be permitted to prevail where it would produce an
unrealistic and generally unanticipated result, as, for example, where it
would unwarrantably reduce the cover which it was the purpose of the policy to
afford: **Morely v United Friendly Inc plc** [1993] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 490.  
  
But we must point out that in the present case the `interest` which the policy
was intended to insure was `hull and machinery equipment outfits and
everything connected therewith in respect of a bulk carrier IKOPA to be
converted into a clean product tanker` for the period 14 February to 13
December 1992. When the policy was extended for a period of one month from 14
December 1992 to 13 January 1993, the interest covered was stated to be
`builders` risks in respect of vessel constructed under hull number 98
pursuant to a building contract dated 22 January 1992 as amended by ...`. It
would thus be seen that the policy was meant to protect the vessel under
conversion. Contrary to the assertion of Pan United, the policy is not a
general policy to cover liabilities to third parties arising from the acts of
Pan United or the other named insureds of the policy although the policy also
covered (under cl 17.1) damage caused to another vessel following collision
with the insured vessel. The coverage under cl 17.1 is expressly stated to be
an additional coverage: `The indemnity provided by this clause shall be in
addition to the indemnity provided by the other terms and conditions of the
insurance.` Bearing the foregoing in mind, it is clear why the protection and
indemnity afforded under cl 19.1 is limited to liability incurred as owner of
the insured vessel. Pan United are therefore not correct to contend that cl 19
seeks to provide cover for third party damage in addition to what is provided
for in cl 17. There is, in truth, no general regime to extensively cover third
party losses.  
  
A perusal of the statement of claim filed by Malec against Pan United shows
that it was purely a claim in negligence against Pan United, the shipyard. It
was never asserted by Malec that Pan United`s status as the owner had anything
to do with the claim. Their status, as owners of the vessel, was completely
irrelevant to the claim.  
  
Does this construction, as contended by Pan United, lead to the result that cl
19.1 would be a wholly redundant clause? They argued that, on this
construction, there would never be any instance where there would be liability
under cl 19. This sweeping assertion is again not correct. An example of such
a loss or liability arising where an owner like Pan United would have to bear
would be where natural forces damaged the vessel under conversion or, due to
such forces, the vessel damaged the property of a third party.  
  
Accordingly, we agree with the trial judge that the claim by Malec against Pan
United does not fall within cl 19.1 and the insurers are not liable to
indemnify Pan United. This being sufficient to dispose of the appeal, it is
unnecessary for us to go into the other two arguments canvassed, namely, the
scope of the exemption in cl 19.3.10, and whether the deduction specified in
cl 10 is applicable to Pan United`s claim.  
  
**_Question of deductibility_**

****

But we will say this much as regards the question of deductibility under cl
10, which would only arise if the claim of Pan United came within cl 19.1.
Clause 10.1 provides that no claim is payable `unless the aggregate of all
such claims arising out of each separate accident or occurrence` exceeds
$50,000. Pan United argued that this clause applies only to the principal
claim and not to a claim for legal costs. Such a claim for legal costs is not
a claim arising from an accident or occurrence. We find the purported
distinction between the principal claim and the costs incurred to be without
merit. Clause 10.1 does not make such a distinction. The criteria provided in
cl 10.1 is `each separate accident or occurrence.` It does not matter that
several claims arise out of that accident. If a claim is made against an
insurer and the insurer defends the claim on the insured`s behalf and the
insured is required to pay the claim and costs, there can be no doubt that the
insured is entitled to claim against the insurer for both the principal claim
and the legal costs incurred and the insurer would be entitled to deduct the
$50,000 and have to indemnify the insured only as to the remainder. Why should
it make a difference if the claimant fails in his claim (or the claim is
settled as in the present case) but the insured has to bear his own costs.
Accordingly, we agree with the learned trial judge that had Pan United
succeeded in showing that cl 19.1 applied, their claim for indemnity would be
subject to the specified deduction of $50,000.  
  
**_Judgment_**

****

In the premises, the appeal is dismissed with costs. The security for costs
(with any accrued interest) shall be paid out to the respondents or their
solicitors to account of the respondents` costs.  
  
**Outcome:**

Appeal dismissed.
