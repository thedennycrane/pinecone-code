Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases – Whether award should
be made for loss of future earnings  
  

1 The defendant, who was the driver of a cement-mixer, agreed that he was 95%
responsible for a traffic collision with the plaintiff (“the claimant”) who
was riding a motor cycle. Interlocutory judgment was entered. Damages were
assessed by the Assistant Registrar and she assessed, among other items, that
the pre-trial loss, inclusive of CPF, was $39,325.53, the loss of future
earnings inclusive of CPF at 16% was $339.081.60, and the sum of $20,000 as
loss of earning capacity. The details of the assessment of Special and General
Damages were set out by the Assistant Registrar in an Annexure which is
annexed to this judgment.

2 Both parties were dissatisfied with the decisions and appealed to the High
Court. The claimant contended that his pre-trial loss totalled $47,853.66. In
relation to the injury to his right hand, counsel for the claimant submitted
that there should be an award of $70,000.00 relying on _Samsudin bin Amir v
Mui Siew Kong_ 1990 Mallal’s Dist para 520 and _Mukhitar Singh v Balwint
Daljit Singh_ [1993] 3SLR 741. The biggest item of the claimant’s appeal was
of course for the loss of future earnings. Based on his loss of promotions,
which he on the evidence would have unquestionably achieved, the claimant’s
counsel submitted that the loss of future earnings should be $655,877.82. The
claimant relied on the following matters. First, by reason of the injuries to
his right hand, he would not get the promotions and increments. Secondly, he
had no hope of any increment for long service in the future. Thirdly, he would
not get any overtime for the rest of his life.

3 Counsel for the defendant, on the other hand, submitted that the pre-trial
loss should only be $4,200.00. Counsel strongly urged the court not to award
anything for loss of future earnings. It was pointed out that the claimant was
on medical leave from March 2000 to September 2000. During his medical leave
he still received his pay. From October 2000 he once again received overtime
pay. Counsel for the defendant submitted that in July 2000 the claimant had an
increment from $2,413.00 to $2,534.00. In the result, it was emphasised that
despite his injury to his right hand, he is still employed by the same firm,
earning a higher salary. His claim for overtime is unpredictable; it depends
on the performance of his employer.

4 At the conclusion of both appeals, I dismissed both of them and ordered the
claimant to pay costs of $2,500 of the appeals to the defendant, seeing that
the claimant had lost on his substantial claim for future loss of earnings.

5 On 25 March 2003 the defendant filed Notice of Appeal against part of my
decision. He appeals against three aspects of my decision, namely the pre-
trial loss of earnings, the loss of future earnings and the loss of earning
capacity.

6 I dismissed the appeals because there was ample evidence before the
Assistant Registrar to justify the findings and the assessments she made. I
summarise the evidence briefly. The claimant, then 35 year old, was
hospitalised on 25 February 2000 after the traffic accident. He, a right
hander, sustained crushed injury to his right hand involving the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, 4th and 5th metacarpal bone with muscles and tendon injury. By February
2002 the fractures had united but there remained stiffness and restriction of
movements of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th fingers. There is hypoasthesia of
the right hand and reduced power in his hand grip.

7 According to Dr Chew Peng Cher, the crushed injury of the right hand
involving the 1st, 2nd and 3rd metacarpal bone had now united with
degenerative and restriction of movements. This is permanent. The weakness of
the right hand grip was also noted. It is again permanent and will reduce the
efficiency work-rate of his right hand. The total loss of his right hand is
45%.

8 At the time of the accident, the claimant was earning, including overtime,
the total of $36,734.75 for the year or about $3,061.23 per month. In year
2000 he received the total salary of $37,558.34. As a result of the accident,
he was unable to work for a few months. He was paid during his medical leave.

9 As a Senior Associate Engineer, his duties included maintaining of
equipment, equipment conversion package to package, modifying and adapting
parts of use in the equipment, replacing parts so that the equipment could be
used to produce different products, training of staff in maintaining of
equipment including training of staff for the purposes of adapting the
equipment to produce different products. Prior to the injuries, he used to
work overtime on weekdays, weekends and public holidays. Overtime pay was
calculated on a higher basis. In a month, he could earn as much as $1,661.50
per month just on overtime. The claimant produced his pay-slips which showed
his loss of overtime.

10 As a consequence of the injuries to his right hand, the claimant has been
unable to carry on working in the technical department of ST Assembly Test
Services Ltd. He was only able to carry out administrative duties.

11 On the evidence, there was little doubt that the claimant would suffer loss
of future earnings as his promotional prospects were blighted because of his
injured right hand. I had little doubt that but for the accident and the
injury the claimant would in September 2002 be holding the position of
Engineer and his salary would be as high, if not higher, than his colleague, a
Mr Lai Khai Teng, who joined the company at about the same time the claimant
did. Mr Lai was promoted to be an Engineer. There was evidence that the
performance of the claimant among five Associate Engineers was the best. Among
the first group of 5 associate engineers, he was the first to be promoted
Senior Associate Engineer. That promotion took place within the short period
of 1 ½ year. His immediate boss, Mr Chang, told him that he was the best
performer. It was recognised by the company and it must follow that his
prospects would have been better than Mr Lai’s, but for the injury.

12 The claimant’s immediate superior, Mr Chang Weng Onn, gave evidence for the
claimant. He said the claimant joined the company in 1996 and confirmed the
job description given by the claimant. He said the claimant was unable to work
in the technical section of ST Assembly and had to be reduced from technical
to administrative duties. He confirmed that the claimant did not enjoy the
upgrading to the next level which carried an average of 8% increment because
of his long absence and non-contribution to the company. The claimant obtained
a lower average increment in comparison with his cohorts, receiving only 5%
increment while his contemporaries obtained increments of about 9.7%. Mr Chang
said the claimant could have been promoted in 2001 to be an Engineer drawing a
monthly gross salary of $2,731.00.

13 Mr Chang testified that the claimant on the average would work 50 hours
overtime per month. However, in respect of the administrative duties, overtime
is not required. The claimant has therefore lost overtime, and CPF
contributions. He also lost the benefit of share options which are given to
all staff of the company based on work performance.

14 In the circumstances, there was evidence on which the Assistant Registrar
could find that the claimant would suffer loss of future earnings. The figures
were established by the salary scales and promotion schemes of the employers.
The assessment on the basis of loss of future earnings by the Assistant
Registrar was demonstrably supportable and there was no reason for me to
disturb her assessments. She has also assessed loss of earning capacity at the
sum of $20,000. On the evidence, it was appropriate to award on the basis of
the figures available a substantial loss of future earnings and a smaller sum
for loss of earning capacity because in the competitive labour market which
hopefully the claimant would not be thrown into, his disadvantage should by
reflected by an award for loss of earning capacity: see _Teo Sing Keng v Sim
Ban Kiat_ [1994] 1 SLR 634, _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ [1996] 3 SLR 513
and _Neo Kim Seng v Clough Petrosea Pte Ltd_ [1996] 3 SLR 522.

15 For these reasons, both appeals before me were dismissed.
