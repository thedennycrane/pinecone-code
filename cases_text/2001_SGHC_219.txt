stage test for admission – Whether issues of sufficient complexity and
difficulty – Whether local expertise present – Whether circumstances of case
warrant admission – Whether applicant has special qualifications and
experience – s 21(1) Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2000 Ed)  
  

: By this originating motion, Mr Martin Russell Thomas Howe QC (`Mr Howe`) of
8 New Square, Lincoln`s Inn, London, sought ad hoc admission under s 21 of the
Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2000 Ed) (`the Act`) to practise as an advocate
and solicitor of this court as leading counsel, to appear for Fico BV (`Fico`)
in a patent infringement action in the High Court, until its final disposal.
At the conclusion of the hearing of the application, I dismissed it.  
  
**_Section 21 of the Legal Profession Act_**

****

Section 21 of the Act, states as follows:

> _
>
> (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may, for
> the purpose of any one case where the court is satisfied that it is of
> sufficient difficulty and complexity having regard to the circumstances of
> the case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who -
>
> (a) holds Her Majesty`s Patent as Queen`s Counsel;
>
> (b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has come or
> intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the case; and
>
> (c) has special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case.
>
> _

  
  
The applicant also showed to the court his very impressive credentials. It was
obvious that the requirements of special qualifications and experience under s
21(1) of the Act were not in issue.  
  
In **Re Oliver David Keightley Rideal QC** [1992] 2 SLR 400  at 402D, Chan Sek
Keong J (as he then was) very accurately pointed out that the amendment in
1991, Act No 10 of 1991, to s 21 was aimed at specifying some guidelines in
the ad hoc admission of Queen`s Counsel. The objective of the amendment was to
help develop a strong core of good advocates at the local Bar, by `the
imposition of more stringent conditions for the admission of Queen`s Counsel
to appear in our courts, but, at the same time, to continue to allow litigants
to avail of their services in appropriate cases`. In **Price Arthur Leolin v
A-G** [1992] 2 SLR 972  at 975E, I stated that:

> _The objective of the amendment was to help the development of a strong core
> of good advocates at the local bar by restricting access to Queen`s Counsel
> only in the more difficult and complex cases._

  
  
The amendment to s 21 of the Act thus requires the court to take into account
two additional requirements: (1) that the case must be of sufficient
difficulty and complexity; and (2) the circumstances of the case.  
  
Again, I took the opportunity to clarify this in **Re Caplan Jonathan Michael
QC (No 2)** [1998] 1 SLR 440  at [para ]11:

> _At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in which
> he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient
> difficulty and complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a
> Queen`s Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee
> of admission, for the decision to admit is still a matter for the court`s
> discretion. At the second stage, therefore, the applicant must persuade the
> court that the circumstances of the particular case warrant the court
> exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he has to
> satisfy the court of his suitability for admission._

  
  
Our courts have had a decade in dealing with s 21(1) of the Act. As it was
quite rightly pointed out by Lai Kew Chai J in **Re Flint Charles John Raffles
QC** [2001] 2 SLR 276  at [para ]9, the local Bar has matured and is
acquitting itself commendably. Lai J has put this elegantly:

> _There has been forged and carefully nurtured, particularly over the last
> ten years, a body of Senior Counsel, potential senior counsel and an
> impressive group of young advocates and solicitors, both in the public
> service and in the private sector, with excellent academic credentials and a
> right attitude. The process continues during which opportunities must be
> judiciously offered and challenges thrown, though never at the expense of
> justice to any litigant before our courts._

  
  
It is in this context that the court has then to analyse the nature of the
suit to consider it if it merits an ad hoc admission of a Queen`s Counsel.  
  
**_The suit_**

****

The plaintiffs are the proprietors of three patents of a moulding machine. The
patents relate to different parts of a moulding machine for moulding
semiconductor lead frames. They are Patent No 35031 for a `Modular Moulding
Apparatus`, Patent No 52483 for a `Single Strip Moulding Apparatus with Means
for Exerting Pressure`, and Patent No 56503 for a `Press for Encapsulating
Electronic Components and Methods for Use of the Press`. The plaintiffs` claim
against the defendants was about an allegation that certain mechanical parts
of the defendants` IDEALmold infringed their three patents. The plaintiffs
asked for an injunction, damages and costs in relation to the alleged
infringement. The trial of this matter has been fixed for August 2001.  
  
As I stated in **Price Arthur Leolin v A-G** [1992] 2 SLR 972  at 975H, the
onus is on the applicants to show in an affidavit the specific issues for
which admission is sought and persuade the court that they are complex and
difficult.  
  
**_Complexity and difficulty_**

****

In the affidavit, the applicant stated three main issues to justify his
admission. These issues were all matters to be decided at the trial proper:

> _
>
> (a) whether the Plaintiffs` inventions were valid in that they were novel
> and involved an inventive step;
>
> (b) whether the Defendants had a right to continue to use the allegedly
> infringing article pursuant to s 71 of the Patents Act;
>
> (c) whether the Registrar`s grant of Patent No 56503 in respect of claims
> 7-19 was illegal irrational and/or unreasonable on account of the fact that
> the International Preliminary Examination Report covered only claims 1-6 of
> the patent application.
>
> _

  
  
**_The first issue_ **

****

The test to be used to determine novelty and inventive step has been twice
ruled on by the Court of Appeal, in both **Merck & Co Inc v Pharmaforte
Singapore** [2000] 3 SLR 717  and **Genelabs Diagnostics v Institut Pasteur**
[2001] 1 SLR 121 .  
  
The High Court, in hearing the case, will have to decide the issue in
accordance with these decisions. In **Re Price Arthur Leolin QC** [1998] 3 SLR
782  at [para ]16, I made it clear that once there is a precedent binding the
High Court, the High Court, in hearing the case, will have to rule in
accordance with that precedent. In such circumstances, the first issue posed
no complexity.  
  
**_The second issue_**

****

On the second issue, the applicant did not explain why the issue was complex
or difficult. The applicant merely stated that no local decision had had an
opportunity of construing s 71 of the Patents Act (Cap 221, 1995 Ed). However,
the mere fact that there is no local decision interpreting a provision of a
statute does not per se turn that into a complex or difficult issue of law. If
it were so, it means that whenever a fresh statute is enacted and becomes the
subject of dispute as to its applicability, s 21 of the Act will warrant the
admission of a Queen`s Counsel. That cannot be right.  
  
The logical approach should instead be to refer to decisions of other
Commonwealth jurisdictions and the High Court would have to decide on it. As
stated by Chan Sek Keong J in **_Re Oliver David Keightley Rideal QC_** (supra
at p 404I), `Novelty of this nature is not ... prima facie evidence of
complexity.`  
  
On this issue too, it is for the defendants to show that they have been doing
something towards the manufacture of an equivalent similar to what is
contained in the plaintiffs` patents before the priority dates of the patents.
The issue is thus essentially an issue of fact that will have to be determined
by the High Court on the basis of documents and witnesses` testimony and the
High Court`s evaluation of the evidence.  
  
**_The third issue_**

****

Again, the applicant did not state in his affidavit why the third issue was
complex or difficult. The applicant merely stated that no local decision has
had an opportunity to construe the application and applicability of s 71 of
the Patents Act. It is more an issue of administrative law in the context of
the Patents Act. On this specific issue of administrative law, numerous
precedents are available. Although it may be a novel context of the Patents
Act, I failed to see how that alone per se should turn it into an issue of
sufficient complexity and difficulty, warranting the admission of a Queen`s
Counsel.  
  
**_Circumstances to justify admission_**

****

It was thus clear that this case did not pass the first stage of the test.  
  
At the second stage, the court has to balance the need to foster a strong and
independent Bar and the individual justice of each case which demands the
special skills of a Queen`s Counsel.  
  
The applicant cited several reasons in his affidavit, the main reason of which
was an allegation that the level of patent expertise in Singapore was low.
Such a statement was hardly justifiable. I will merely cite a number of patent
cases, involving local counsel. **V-Pile Technology (Luxembourg) SA v Peck
Bros Construction** [2000] 3 SLR 358  was a case about whether the defendants`
machine infringed the plaintiffs` patent. It also touched on whether the
invention possessed any inventive step. In **_Merck & Co Inc v Pharmaforte
Singapore _** (supra), the issues were whether the lack of utility rendered
the invention devoid of novelty, and whether the invention was obvious to a
person skilled in the art. The case of **Flexon v Bean Innovations** [2001] 1
SLR 24  touched on the issues of groundless threats of infringement
proceedings and the applicability of s 77(4) of the Patents Act, as well as
the construction of the claims in specification of the defendants` patent. In
**_Genelabs Diagnostics v Institut Pasteur_** (supra), the issues touched on
novelty, inventive step, sufficiency of disclosure, infringement and
acquiescence.  
  
Queen`s Counsel should only be admitted for complex and difficult cases where
the necessary knowledge and experience is not available from, or cannot be
provided by, local counsel. This was not one of those cases.  
  
The applicant also seemed to allude to the likelihood that the High Court`s
eventual ruling with regard to the third issue will have a wide impact on the
patent practice in Singapore; also that there are many other cases where the
Registrar grants patents without looking at the Examination Report. I failed
to see that this was the case, and in any case, why such a wrong practice, if
it existed, required the elucidation of a Queen`s Counsel for it to be
highlighted by the High Court. The local Bar has more than sufficient
expertise and competence to compare the practice across the Commonwealth
jurisdictions and bring it to the High Court`s attention.  
  
**Outcome:**

Application dismissed.
