** Judgment **

**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_**

1\. This was the petition of Judy Cheng Su Yin who was a pupil of Mr Kang Kim
Yang in the firm of Joseph Tan Jude Benny. She completed her pupillage on 26
July 2002 and had since left the firm. She filed her petition for admission to
the Bar as an advocate and solicitor on 1 October 2002. By a summons-in-
chambers filed on 7 October 2002 Mr Subbiah Pillai of Pillai & Pillai applied
for an order permitting Miss Cheng limited audience before the courts, that
is, before a judge or registrar in chambers, a district court judge or
registrar in chambers, and a district judge or magistrate to mention a case or
to apply for bail. Such applications are not uncommonly made and are usually
referred to as "applications for ‘part-call’". This present application is
unusual because the applicant is not the pupil-master of Miss Cheng Mr. Pillai
made this application before me so that Miss Cheng may appear in court on
behalf of his firm. In his submission, Mr. Pillai stated that Miss Cheng did
not petition for admission to the Bar after her pupillage because she "wanted
to gain more experience". She thus worked as a paralegal until Mr. Pillai
employed her.

2\. The Attorney-General, the Law Society of Singapore and the Board of Legal
Education opposed the application for ‘part-call’. The reason, they say, is
that Miss Cheng could only make this application under s 32(3) of the Legal
Profession Act, Ch 161 which provides as follows:

> > "A Judge may, if he thinks fit, on the application of a solicitor who is a
> master under Part II allow his pupil who has completed not less than 4
> months of his pupillage to appear on behalf of the master or the firm in
> which the master is a partner or consultant, or the law corporation in which
> the master is a director or consultant or an employee, before –
>>

>> (a) a Judge or Registrar in Chambers;

>>

>> (b) a District Judge or the Registrar of a District Court in Chambers; and

>>

>> (c) a District Judge or Magistrate to mention a case or to apply for bail."

3\. It is not disputed that Mr Pillai who appeared on behalf of Miss Cheng is
not (and was not) the applicant’s pupil-master. Miss Cheng completed her
pupillage with Mr Kang of Joseph Tan Jude Benny from 15 January 2002 to 26
July 2002.

4\. It seems clear to me that s 32(3) creates a very narrow exception to the
rule under s 32(1) that no one may practise as an advocate and solicitor
unless he has been admitted to the Bar as such. The words of s 32(3) are
precise and there is no room for me to broaden the exception. Section 32 only
permits the pupil-master to apply for his pupil to appear in the limited
extent granted under subsection (3). Mr Pillai, not being the pupil-master of
Miss Cheng is not entitled to make this application on her behalf.

5\. I agree with the submission of Miss Chu, for the Law Society of Singapore,
that the purpose of s 32(3) is to give a pupil (who had completed four months
of pupillage) the opportunity of appearing in court, in limited instances and
under supervision of her pupil-master, as part of the process of preparing
that pupil for her eventual admission to the Bar. The right of audience under
s 32(3) is therefore a right conferred at the discretion of the court as part
of the pupil’s training under the pupillage of her pupil-master. When the
pupillage ends, the right under s 32(3) also ends.

6\. Mr. Pillai argued that the objections of the other parties were technical
in nature. He argued that the pupillage period of six months is only a minimum
period. He submitted, in an indirect way, that Miss Cheng is, in effect, still
a pupil receiving instructions from him. With respect, this argument is not
tenable. No one may act as a pupil-master unless the requisite approval to do
so has been obtained and, under s 13 of the Act, the prescribed period of
pupillage is six months. In Miss Cheng’s case, s 13(6) and s 14 do not apply.
There is no approval or any application by Mr. Pillai for him to act as Miss
Cheng’s pupil-master. I am afraid that I shall have to disagree with Mr.
Pillai’s argument that the objections are merely technical. The Legal
Profession Act clearly does not permit a person who had been given a right of
limited audience under s 32(3) to carry on appearing indefinitely in court,
even in those limited circumstances, if she is not called to the Bar after her
period of pupillage had ended. These rules which Mr. Pillai says are technical
in nature are designed as part of the statutory control over the right of
audience in court, and the rules must be strictly followed except where the
court is given a discretion to abridge or extend time as the case may be, or
in any other matter permitted by the rules or statutory provision.

7\. Arising from what I have said above, it appears that a pupil who had been
granted a limited right of audience in a part-call may not continue to
exercise that right once her pupillage ends. This would be so even if she,
unlike Miss Cheng in the present case before me, remains with her pupil-
master’s firm, waiting for her formal admission to the Bar.

8\. This application is therefore dismissed. I shall hear the question of
costs at a later date if parties are unable to agree costs.
