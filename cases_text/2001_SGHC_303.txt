**Judgment**

_GROUNDS OF DECISION_

1\. This was an appeal by the defendants against the quantification of damages
by the assistant registrar Mr. Kwek Mean Luck on 7 August 2001. I dismissed
the appeal as well as the plaintiff’s cross-appeal on 11 September 2001. The
defendants now appeal against my decision. Liability was not in dispute and
the appeal concerned the issue of damages only. The defendants employed the
plaintiff as a machine operator on 18 April 1995. On 12 April 2000 the
plaintiff’s hands were crushed and both hands were subsequently amputated at
the wrist. The plaintiff was 51 years old at the time of the accident and was
earning a monthly salary of about $1,300. The defendants consented to judgment
in respect of liability. There was no question of contributory negligence. The
assistant registrar awarded a sum of $729,659.10 in damages made up as
follows:

> "_Special Damages_ |   
> ---|---  
> 1\. Pre-trial Loss of Earnings  | $ 22,630.00  
> | _($ 6,500.00)_  
> | $ 16,130.00  
> 2\. Pre-trial Cost of Mechanical hands  | $ 50,000.00  
> 3\. Pre-trial Cost of Nursing care  | $ 12,565.00  
> 4\. Pre-trial Medical and Transport Expenses | _$ 1,164.00_  
> | $ 79,859.10  
> _General Damages_ |   
> 1\. Loss of both hands (pain and sufferings) |   
> $65,000 x 2 = $130,000 | $130,000.00  
> 2\. Post Traumatic Depression | $ 20,000.00  
> 3\. Loss of future earnings  |   
> $1,600/mth x 12 x 4 = $76,800  | $ 76,800.00  
> 4\. Future cost of mechanical hands  |   
> $50,000 x 4 = $200,000  | $200,000.00  
> i.e. Age 52 (15 years) replacement every 3 years |   
> 5\. Gloves and Batteries  | $ 60,000.00  
> 6\. Future Cost of Nursing  | $153,000.00  
> 7\. Future Transportation and Medical Expenses  | _$ 10,000.00_  
> | $649,800.00  
> **Total of Special Damages and General Damages** | **$729,659.10"**  
  
2\. I think that it will be useful to state the basic principles in the
hearing of appeals of cases concerning the quantification of damages. Such
cases invariably require the decision maker to exercise his discretion in
selecting the appropriate amount of award. No two decision makers can be
expected to exercise their discretion in identically the same way or arrive at
an identical award. Therefore, one can always expect awards to appear higher
or lower as the case may be in comparison and, furthermore, very rarely would
the facts themselves be identical or even close. A judge may award a sum of
$35,000 for the loss of a hand to a fifty year old but he may award $50,000 to
a 15 year old for a similar injury. Where facts change so would the exercise
of his discretion. Another judge may consider the difference to be closer to
$10,000 rather than $15,000. The quantification of damages for personal injury
is not a scientific exercise and because of the varying facts as well as the
strong element of discretion, often appears to be an arbitrary exercise. No
one can say at which point money will truly compensate a person for the agony
of injury and physical loss. It is impossible. One may debate without end as
to whether the loss of a right arm deserves greater compensation than the loss
of right foot, but it is not possible to come to any objective conclusion.
There are people who may say that they would rather lose their right arm than
to lose their foot; and an equal number who would think otherwise. So, in
reaching a figure to award, the decision maker ought to avoid the extremes. On
the one hand, the award must not be so low as to belittle the suffering of the
injured and on the other hand, it must not be a largesse that deeply
impoverishes and punishes the tort-feasor or his insurer. Hence, the decision
maker must first decide whether the item claimed is one that is recognised at
law. Then he has to decide what would be a reasonable band of award for the
said item (such as the pain and suffering for the loss of an arm). Finally, he
has to consider all the facts and circumstances of the case and decide what is
the appropriate award to be made. In doing so, he will find it helpful to take
into account similar awards but with the caution that awards from other
jurisdictions may not be ideal examples because the social and economic
factors may differ substantially.

3\. When discretion is exercised in the manner described above, it ought not
as a general rule, be disturbed, otherwise it will only encourage parties to
appeal merely to nourish a hope that the appeal judge may exercise his
discretion differently. I think that in cases where justice is all the more
elusive on account of its dependence on the discretion of the court, a second
opinion is not necessarily more equitable. Why should the second decision be
any more or any less fair? Viewed in this way, subject to correction of
obvious errors, finality in such cases is desirable. Thus, the duty I am bound
to discharge is to satisfy myself that the court below had exercised its
discretion properly and that the proper principles were applied, and once
satisfied, to leave the award below undisturbed even though I might have
preferred a higher or lower award myself. Hence, it is obvious that the
grounds of decision of the court below will be helpful in understanding how
the court’s discretion was exercised. In this case there were no written
grounds. I mention this not as a criticism but merely as a preamble to the
view that I shall now express as to how I ought to proceed in such
circumstances. In my opinion, where no written grounds are available, it must
be assumed that the court below had taken all relevant factors into account
and therefore exercised its discretion properly especially where the arguments
by counsel below were substantially the same. There must be clear indications
that call for intervention by an appeal court - for example, where an
important piece of evidence had not been referred to the court below. The only
reasonable test is to review the individual items and see whether the
difference, if any, between the amount given below and the amount which the
appeal judge thinks is fair is substantial. If the difference, if any, is not
substantial, the award below should not be disturbed.

4\. In the present case, conceding that there is no direct authority on point,
the defendant’s counsel sought to persuade me that the present award is
excessive by comparing it with cases concerning other injuries, such as the
amputation of a right thigh and amputation of arm below the elbow. In
particular, defence counsel suggested that by granting the sub-heads of pain
and suffering "in full" the assistant registrar erred because no consideration
was thus given on account of overlapping compensation. He submitted that there
should be no award for the costs of mechanical hands when there is an award
for pain and suffering for the loss of both hands "because the artificial
hands provide some relief for the pain and suffering suffered by the
plaintiff". This was a submission which had been made to the assistant
registrar and there being nothing before me to support a contention that the
assistant registrar had not taken this into account I must assume that he had
done so. The question before me therefore is whether, as a matter of
principle, the proposition by defence counsel that the court below made the
award for pain and suffering without considering the question of overlap was
correct. Compensation for pain and suffering for the loss of both hands is
just that - a compensation - so far as money can do – to alleviate the
suffering occasioned by the physical deprivation of one’s hands. The costs of
artificial hands is a distinct head. There is no question of an overlap in
this sense. It seems clear to me that the assistant registrar gave an award
that took into account the age of the plaintiff, the cost of each set of
artificial limbs, the number of times the limbs have to be replaced. The award
was based on an assessment which does not appear excessive to me. Thus, should
the amount for pain and suffering be reduced in view of the fact that the
plaintiff will be having the benefit of these limbs? These items had been
submitted to the assistant registrar below and there is nothing to indicate to
me that he had not taken the question of overlapping into account. Artificial
limbs can never replace the dexterity and sensitivity and beauty of the
natural hands. If the science was unable to give the plaintiff the use of
artificial hands, I would on my part, have given the award pain and suffering
to be much higher. The provision of costs for artificial limbs is an item over
and above damages for pain and suffering. Thus, it surely cannot be said that
if not for the artificial hands which costs about $200,000 the award for pain
and suffering would have been increased by that same sum. If that was what
defence counsel meant by an ‘overlap’ then, with respect, I must disagree with
the use of that term. If science was unable to provide the plaintiff with
artificial limbs to alleviate the plaintiff’s suffering then I would think
that she might then have been entitled to a higher award for pain and
suffering, but that is not the same as saying that because she will be getting
artificial limbs, there is an overlap by giving her the limbs as well as
damages for pain and suffering. If this was what counsel meant, he must show
that had the assistant registrar taken that into account he would have given a
lower amount. There is nothing to support such a suggestion. I am of the view
that the question of overlap (if at all) was not overlooked by the court
below. I see no reason to fault the assistant registrar's assessment here. I
note, however, that the assistant registrar awarded $65,000 for each hand. I
would agree that compensation for the loss of both hands is not necessarily
calculated by doubling the quantification for the loss of one hand. This is
because the pain, inconvenience and frustration resulting from the complete
helplessness in such a case may be more than that; as it can be imagined that
the loss of both eyes would be much more serious than the loss of one and the
question of damages may not be answered by merely doubling the award given for
the loss of a hand or an eye. The difficulty lies in determining how much more
or, for that matter, how much less. However, even taking this into account, I
am of the view that the amount I would have given would not be substantially
more than the $130,000 awarded. I ought to add that the authorities presented
by both sides are diverse and not directly on point to be of much help. The
award of $65,000 below for each hand might have been determined under the
guidance of _Ng Kim Cheng v Naigai Nitto Singapore Pte Ltd_ [1991] SLR 517
where the same amount was awarded for an amputation of an arm. That was
however an agreed sum. On the other hand, there is _Van der Veldr v Lim Seow
Tat_ [1964] 2 MLJ lvii where Chua J awarded $45,000 to a 32-year old man for a
similar injury, but in that case the plaintiff was able to return to work
after therapy and the provision of an artificial limb. The suffering of a
person who has both hands amputated is much greater and more complex; so, if
at all, _Vander Veldr_ is an indication that the award of $65,000 is not
excessive. Defence counsel here also referred to some paralysis cases but in
my view these cases are not suitably similar for any useful comparison.

5\. In respect of the cost of future nursing care, I think that there is no
doubt that it is required. The provision of artificial hands does not mean
that it will put the plaintiff in a position as if she had not lost her hands.
That was very much an issue of fact which the assistant registrar having heard
the evidence and submission is properly appraised to decide whether any
discount ought to be made for it. Nothing of significance was raised before me
to refute this. I reviewed each of the other items assessed and on my part, I
would not have awarded a substantially different amount in respect of any of
them. Therefore, in my view, the award must stand. For these reasons, the
plaintiff's appeal was dismissed. For the same reasons, I do not agree with
Mr. Karuppan that the award was inadequate. The plaintiff's cross-appeal was,
therefore, also dismissed.
