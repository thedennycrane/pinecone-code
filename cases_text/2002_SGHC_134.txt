**Judgment** __

_**GROUNDS OF DECISION**_

1 The first Plaintiff ("Baridhi") is a company registered in Bangladesh. At
all material times it was, and still is, the agent in Bangladesh for Evergreen
Marine Corporation (Taiwan) Ltd ("EMC"), a Taiwanese main line operator that
manages and operates numerous vessels worldwide. As agent, Baridhi promotes
and manages the business of EMC in Bangladesh, including securing shipping
contracts for EMC.

2 The second Plaintiff ("HRC"), also a Bangladeshi company, is in the business
of transporting cargo but on a smaller scale compared to EMC’s operations. Its
mode of operation is to contract with major lines, such as EMC, to transport
cargo out of Bangladesh to another country where that cargo would be loaded
into larger vessels belonging to EMC for carriage to the final destination.
For cargo destined for Bangladesh, HRC would pick up such cargo from EMC
vessels and convey them to Bangladeshi ports. HRC and operators like it are
called "feeder operators".

3 The first Defendant ("SCPL") is a company registered in Singapore. It is a
feeder operator like HRC and is its competitor in Bangladesh. The second
Defendant ("Wong") is a director of SCPL. The Plaintiffs allege that in
respect of the acts complained of, Wong had acted in the course of his
employment or had done so for and on behalf of SCPL.

4 The Statement of Claim alleges that Wong had published an e-mail dated 6
April 2001 which contained words that are defamatory of the Plaintiffs. The
e-mail was sent to, _inter alia_ , officers of EMC in Taiwan, an officer of
RTW Shipping (S) Pte Ltd which is the agent for EMC in Singapore, and the
office of the agent of EMC in Sri Lanka. The Plaintiffs’ claim is in damages,
including special damages and exemplary damages. In 4 and 5 of the Statement
of Claim the Plaintiffs explained the background to that e-mail in this
manner:

> > 4\. The 1st Defendant was to have transported certain cargo out of
> Bangladesh for EMC. However, had it done so, it would have been in breach of
> the Bangladesh Flag Vessels (Protection) Shipping Ordinance, 1982 ("the
> Ordinance") construed together with the Notification dated 26 September 1982
> in the Bangladesh Gazette. This was because being a foreign entity in
> Bangladesh, the 1st Defendant did not have the requisite waiver under the
> Ordinance. Hence the 1st Plaintiff arranged for the said cargo to be
> transported instead by the 2nd Plaintiff. Being owners and operators of
> Bangladeshi flag vessels, the 2nd Plaintiff did not and does not need to
> procure such a waiver.
>>

>> 5\. When EMC queried why the said cargo was transported by the 2nd
Plaintiff and not the 1st Defendant, the 1st Plaintiff explained in e-mails
dated 16 March 2001 and 22 March 2001. However, the 2nd Defendant disagreed
with the explanation in his e-mails dated 19 March 2001 and 6 April 2001.

5 The e-mail of 6 April 2001, in essence, stated that the issue of the
legality of using SCPL to carry the cargo was just the pretext upon which
Baridhi diverted cargo to HRC. Wong had alleged in the e-mail that the
legislation in question was an outdated one which was originally enacted to
protect the Bangladesh Shipping Corporation. He deposed that HRC, being a
private shipping company was not the national line and it was not the
intention of the legislation to protect such companies. However HRC and other
private lines had been taking advantage of the legislation by putting undue
pressure on the Director-General (Shipping) in Bangladesh to reject waivers
for foreign vessels like those of SCPL. The e-mail ended in the following
manner:

> > HRC are going about on a malicious campaign, trying to get these age old
> rules implemented, which is totally against the principles of Modern day
> Trade and the Globalisation market.
>>

>> For your info, your agent in Bangladesh have a very Bad name in the market
and their doings have in fact a negative image on themselves. If you study the
movement of EMC bxs in the past few years, there is a drop. Martin, if you
require to qualify our sources, pls check and confirm thru some independent
sources about HRC’s reputation in Bangladesh.

>>

>> …

>>

>> Please do not quote this message to HRC directly.

6 The Plaintiffs pleaded that the words in the e-mail, in their natural and
ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean that:

> > (a) Baridhi had lied to EMC and/or has distorted the truth in its
> explanation to EMC as to why SCPL was not engaged to transport the cargo in
> question;
>>

>> (b) Baridhi was incompetent and inefficient and had a bad business
reputation;

>>

>> (c) HRC had lied to the Director-General (Shipping) or had distorted the
truth about the legislation;

>>

>> (d) HRC had been dishonest, exploitative and had conducted its business in
an improper manner.

SIC 1513/2001

**

7 The writ in this action was filed on 18 June 2001 and served on 20 June on
the Defendants in Singapore. On 4 July 2001 the Defendants took out an
application in SIC 1513/2001 to stay the action on the ground that Bangladesh
is the more appropriate forum. Two supporting affidavits were filed by Lim Kin
Seng ("Lim"), the legal officer of SCPL. He related the background to the
dealings that SCPL had with Baridhi and HRC. SCPL had been operating feeder
services in Bangladesh since 1989 and between 1995 and 2000, Baridhi was
SCPL’s agent in Bangladesh. However SCPL terminated this arrangement with
effect from 15 April 2000 and appointed a new agent, Everbest Shipping
Agencies Ltd ("Everbest"). SCPL believed that Baridhi began to allocate EMC
cargo to HRC, which started feeder operations only in 1997. HRC had somehow
persuaded the Director-General (Shipping) not to issue waiver certificates to
foreign feeder operators such as SCPL. Without such certificates, a foreign
operator of feeder services would be liable to punishment by a fine up to the
value of the cargo. Lim stated that it was obvious that HRC had sought to
eliminate competition by unfair means through the use of the said legislation.
After taking legal advice in Bangladesh, SCPL, through its agent Everbest,
commenced legal proceedings on 27 March 2001 in Bangladesh against the
Director-General (Shipping) and others in Writ Petition No.992 of 2001. One of
the remedies sought was a declaration that the Director-General was to refrain
from refusing to grant waiver certificates under the influence of HRC. On 27
March 2001, the Bangladeshi High Court made an interim order that the
Director-General was not to refuse any waiver for a period of two months.
However on application by HRC on 8 May 2001, this order was stayed.

8 As to the e-mail in question, Lim deposed that EMC had, around September
2000 and pursuant to SCPL’s request, instructed HRC to share out the cargo
load for the Chittagong-Colombo sector in the proportion 60:40 in favour of
SCPL. However despite this HRC continued blatantly to object to the issuance
of waiver certificates by the Director-General (Shipping), and then cited the
lack of a waiver as the excuse for not sharing out the cargo. Because of this,
Martin Chen ("Chen") of EMC sent an e-mail on 4 April 2001 to EMC’s agent in
Singapore and Colombo instructing them to stop booking on HRC vessels until
further notice. This e-mail was also sent to HRC for its comments. HRC
responded on 5 April by e-mail to Chen, saying that it did not share out the
cargo with SCPL because of the refusal of the Director-General to grant
waivers. HRC claimed that it was for the protection of EMC’s interests that it
did not load on SCPL’s vessels. Chen forwarded this e-mail to SCPL for its
response, which it gave in the form of the offending e-mail of 6 April 2001.

9 The Defendants contend that the matter has little or no connection with
Singapore because it was published here to only one person whereas it was also
published in Taipei, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the matter
had substantial connection with Bangladesh because:

> > (a) the feeder route involved was the Chittagong-Colombo sector;
>>

>> (b) the dispute concerns the interpretation of Bangaldeshi legislation;

>>

>> (c) there was litigation pending in Bangladesh in respect of the powers of
the Director-General (Shipping) with regard to the legislation;

>>

>> (d) HRC is resident in Bangladesh and its reputation is mainly in
Bangladesh;

>>

>> (e) evidence to prove justification of the statements in the e-mail would
be more conveniently adduced in Bangladesh than Singapore.

**

RA 214/2001

**

10 The Defendants’ application was heard by the Senior Assistant Registrar on
26 October 2001. He ruled in favour of the Defendants and stayed the present
action. The Plaintiffs appealed against that decision in RA 214/2001. I heard
the appeal on 17 January 2002 and dismissed it. However in the course of the
appeal the Plaintiffs had produced the opinion of an expert on Bangladeshi law
stating that the defamation action could not be maintained in Bangladesh. The
Defendants disputed this and produced their own expert to depose to the
contrary. However I note that the opinion is not expressed in unambiguous
terms. It states as follows:

> > The Code of Civil Procedure in force in Bangladesh provides any dispute
> including defamation will be adjudicated under the Jurisdiction of
> Bangladesh Courts irrespective of nationality. I have read paragraph 6 of
> the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim in Suit No. 756/2001/E (the Singapore
> proceedings). The allegation is related to Bangladeshi laws and the alleged
> injury to the plaintiff is also within the territory of the Bangladesh. I
> think this subject matter of dispute should be determined in Bangladesh on
> consideration of relevant oral, documentary and circumstantial evidences
> which are all available in Bangladesh.

In view of this, I gave leave to the Plaintiffs to apply to lift the stay in
the event that the Defendants challenge the jurisdiction of the Bangladeshi
court or assert there that there is no cause of action in Bangladesh.

**

The Present Application: SIC 837/2002

**

11 The Plaintiffs took out the present application on 21 March 2002 to lift
the stay in view of certain developments since their appeal was dismissed in
January. These are set out in the affidavit of Foo Say Nong ("Foo") of 19
March 2002. He deposed that shortly after their appeal was dismissed on 17
January 2002, the Plaintiffs commenced an action in the Bangaldeshi court on 7
February. The Plaintiffs exhibited a copy of the plaint they had filed in the
Court of the 5th Joint District Judge, Dhaka which named both the Defendants
in the present action as defendants. The plaint is on substantially the same
terms as the Statement of Claim in this action. However on 20 February the
Joint District Judge of the 5th Court in Dhaka made the following order:

> > This is a suit for defamation and damage. Suit valued at Tk. 10 Crore.
> Advelorem Court fee of Tk. 28,750/- paid with the plaint. Related documents
> photo-copies filed by the plaintiff as per firisti. It appears from the
> averment made in the plaint. That the cause of action arose in Singapore due
> to Publication of the e-mail on 6th April, 2001. The defendants are also the
> resident of Singapore and do not have any residence or asset in Bangladesh.
> So, the Court or any Court of Bangladesh do not have jurisdiction to proceed
> with or try with the case as per law. This suit is triable in Singapore
> under relevant law of Singapore.
>>

>> Hence, the plaint be returned to the plaintiffs through their learned
lawyer for presentation before the proper Court of jurisdiction in Singapore.

12 In view of the position taken by the 5th District Court of Dhaka, the
Plaintiffs made this application to lift the stay ordered by the Senior
Assistant Registrar on 26 October 2001 which I had affirmed on 17 January
2002.

13 The nub of the dispute is whether the e-mail of 6 April 2001 contains
statements defamatory of the Plaintiffs, and if so, whether a defence of
justification can be made out. As to the meaning of the words complained of,
there is no difference whether the suit is heard in Singapore or Bangladesh.
On the question of damages, the main recipients concerned are the officers of
EMC in Taiwan, of RTW Shipping (S) Pte Ltd in Singapore, and EMC’s office in
Sri Lanka. Hence on that point, Bangladesh has no significant advantage over
Singapore. Counsel for the Defendants had stated that the defences available
were justification and qualified privilege. It was on the defence of
justification that substantial advantage could be derived from having the
action heard in Bangladesh as there were issues relating to Bangladeshi
legislation, in particular whether the ordinance in question was applicable to
HRC. The Plaintiffs pointed out that SCPL had taken out proceedings in the
Bangladesh High Court against the Director-General (Shipping) which decision
would resolve that issue. In determining the appeal, I was of the view that
Bangladesh would be the more appropriate forum as a question of Bangladeshi
law would require to be determined. For that reason I dismissed the
Plaintiffs’ appeal against the stay granted by the Senior Assistant Registrar
on 26 October 2001.

14 However, the Plaintiffs are now faced with a ruling of the Bangladeshi
court which states that they have no cause of action against the Defendants in
Bangladesh. Counsel for the Defendants pointed out that the Defendants took no
steps to oppose or challenge jurisdiction. That may be true but the fact
remains that it is a decision of the Bangladeshi court. The Plaintiffs had in
their first application for stay adduced evidence to the effect that they had
no cause of action in Bangladesh. This was by way of an opinion from their
Bangladeshi counsel. However this was contradicted by the Defendants’ expert
and I had considered that the Plaintiffs had not proved their assertion on
this point. Now the Plaintiffs have a clear ruling by the Bangladeshi court
that they had no cause of action in Bangladesh. To my query, counsel for the
Defendants was unable to say that there was any evidence of fraud. The plaint
exhibited appears to show substantially what is in the Statement of Claim in
the present action. On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the
Plaintiffs have proved that they have no cause of action in Bangladesh.

15 Simply put, the Plaintiffs’ case is that not only is Bangladesh not the
more appropriate forum, it is not even a possible forum. It is the Defendants
who have to satisfy the court that Bangladesh is the more appropriate forum.
In _Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd_ [1998] 1 SLR 253 the
plaintiff was a trading company based in Singapore and the defendants were an
Indian insurance company with a registered office in Singapore. The Court of
Appeal held at 22 that:

> > … where a Singapore court has jurisdiction as of right, it must be
> convinced that the foreign court is so clearly and distinctly more
> appropriate that it would justify the court's decision to deny the
> plaintiffs their day in a Singapore court.

In the present case the Plaintiffs have commenced proceedings in Singapore and
have properly served the writ on the Defendants here. The Bangladeshi court
has decided that it has no jurisdiction. The burden rests on the Defendants to
show that Bangladesh is the more appropriate forum. On the evidence before me,
they have clearly not done so.
