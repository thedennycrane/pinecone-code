[2003] SGHC 90

Case Number | : | Suit 481/2002  
---|---|---  
Decision Date | : | 14 April 2003  
Tribunal/Court | : | High Court  
Coram | : |  S Rajendran J   
Counsel Name(s) | : |  Ramalingam Kasi; Noor M Marican   
Parties | : |  Salleh Bin Awang; Zalipah Bte Arshad — Zakiah Bte Arshad   
  
1 Arshad bin Awang (“Arshad”) died on 26 May 2001 at Changi General Hospital
at age 75. He had been admitted to the Hospital on 6 December 2000. The cause
of death was cardio-respiratory failure. Arshad died intestate.

2 The beneficiaries of his Estate as certified by the Syariah Court were:

(a) Zabariah, daughter from first marriage 16 shares.

(b) Zalina, daughter from first marriage 16 shares.

(c) Zalipah, daughter from first marriage 16 shares.

(d) Salleh, his sole surviving brother 15 shares.

(e) Kapti, his widow 9 shares.

Arshad had, at the time of his death, two accounts – a Fixed Deposit Account
and a Savings Account – with the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”).
Both were joint accounts in the name of Arshad and Zakiah bte Arshad (the
defendant herein). The Savings Account was opened on 14 February 1995 whilst
the Fixed Deposit Account was opened on 8 April 1995. It was not in dispute
that the funds in these accounts came entirely from Arshad. In these
proceedings, Salleh and Zalipah, as administrators of the Estate of Arshad,
sought a declaration that the moneys in the said accounts are held by Zakiah
in trust for the Estate of Arshad.

3 Zakiah was not a blood relative of Arshad. Arshad’s mother – the late Mdm
Mahara bte Hadje Arshad – had, when Zakiah was very young, taken Zakiah into
the family and brought her up. Arshad, who was then in his early twenties and
living with his mother, had adopted Zakiah. Zakiah’s evidence that she treated
Arshad as her adoptive father and that he treated her as his adoptive daughter
was not disputed.

4 Mr Noor Marican, who appeared for Zakiah, conceded that as the funds in the
accounts came from Arshad there was a presumption of a resultant trust in
favour of Arshad. He submitted, however, that there was, in this case, a
preponderance of evidence that showed that Arshad intended to gift the moneys
in the accounts to Zakiah and that, in any event, since Arshad was in loco
parentis with Zakiah, a presumption of advancement arose in favour of Zakiah.

5 Arshad in the later stages of his life needed the assistance of someone to
help manage his moneys. In particular, he needed someone to periodically
withdraw moneys so that he could meet his medical and other expenses. Towards
this end, he had – in March 1994 – opened a joint Savings Account with his
daughter Zalipah (one of the plaintiffs herein) but because of some
misunderstanding with Zalipah, he had closed that account. Thereafter Arshad
had maintained an account in his sole name for some months before closing that
account and opening instead the joint accounts with Zakiah that are the
subject matter of these proceedings.

6 I am satisfied that in opening the joint accounts with Zakiah, Arshad was
not making a gift of the moneys in those accounts to Zakiah. I am also
satisfied that any presumption of advancement in favour of Zakiah by virtue of
the fact that she was his adopted daughter was negated by the fact, as I find
it to be, that Arshad had opened and maintained the accounts jointly with
Zakiah only for his personal convenience in having someone make withdrawals on
his behalf from these accounts. Zakiah was therefore not beneficially entitled
to the moneys in the joint accounts and will have to account to the Estate of
Arshad for those moneys.

7 Accordingly, I grant the following orders:

(a) A Declaration that all the moneies in Savings Account No 501-7-087254 and
Fixed Deposit Account No 501-823082-501 with OCBC Bank are and were held by
the Defendant upon trust for Arshad bin Awang (now deceased);

(b) An order that the Defendant render proper accounts before the Registrar of
all moneys in both the said bank accounts; and for this purpose to trace all
moneys belonging to Arshad bin Awang withdrawn and transferred by the
Defendant from the said accounts;

(c) Judgment against the Defendant for the sum of monies found by the
Registrar to be due from the Defendant in respect of the said accounts with
interest at 6% per annum from date of writ; and

(d) Costs.

_Plaintiffs’ claim allowed._
