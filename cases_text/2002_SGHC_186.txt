**_GROUNDS OF DECISION_ _Cur Adv Vult_**

1 This is an application by Liquidators of the Company under s 310(1)(a) of
the Companies Act. The Liquidators ask for the following substantive order:

> _
>
> "that the Court sanction the payment of AUD112,472.00 by the Company to P.T.
> HM Sampoerna TBK"
>
> _

2 The Claimant, P.T. HM Sampoerna TBK, is a public company in Indonesia in the
business of manufacturing, distribution and sale of tobacco and tobacco-
related products. Sometime in 1991 the Claimant engaged an Australian company,
Pink Elephant International Pty Ltd ("PEI"), to conduct courses for its staff
in Indonesia. PEI has some connection with the Company but they are separate
entities. After the courses were conducted, PEI rendered an invoice to the
Claimant on 19 December 2001. This was sent to the Claimant’s office in
Singapore and is for the sum of AUD135,608.00. The Claimant instructed its
bank to make payment of AUD112,472.00 on the invoice. But the instruction
mistakenly cited the bank account of the Company instead of PEI. It turned out
that the Claimant had prior dealings with the Company and its bank account
information was stored in the Claimant’s computer records. The mistake was
made by human error, presumably due to the similarity in the names. In the
event, the Claimant’s bank paid the sum of AUD112,472.00 ("the Monies") into
the bank account of the Company on 30 January 2002\. As no payment was
received by PEI, its representative contacted the Claimant on 8 February to
inquire about it. It was then that the Claimant realised that it had made the
payment to the wrong account.

3 Meanwhile, things had been going badly for the Company. By January 2002 it
was already insolvent and the directors had decided to go for a voluntary
winding up. The eventual Liquidators, Mr Michael Ng Wei Teck and Mr Neo Ban
Chuan of the accounting firm KPMG Singapore ("KPMG"), were brought into the
picture by early March 2002. It was at this time that the Claimant came in
contact with the Liquidators-to-be. The Claimant had asked PEI for assistance
in obtaining a refund of the Monies from the Company and was referred to KPMG.
There followed a number of communications between the Claimant and KPMG. It is
not clear from the affidavits how the first contact was initiated, but on 8
March 2002, Mr Phillip Reynolds of KPMG sent an e-mail to the Claimant’s
Efiana Chressida requesting for a statement of the exact sequence of events
behind the mistaken payment so that KPMG would _"have all the facts to pass
onto the lawyers."_ In response to this, the Claimant sent a letter to
Reynolds on 12 March 2002 which described the circumstances that I have
outlined above. The letter ended with a request to refund the Monies by
transferring it to the Claimant’s bank account with ABN Amro Bank N.V. in
Surabaya, Indonesia.

4 On 18 March 2002 the Company passed a special resolution to be wound up
voluntarily pursuant to s 290(1)(b) of the Companies Act and the Liquidators
were duly appointed. The Claimants then instructed M/s Harry Elias Partnership
("HEP") on the matter. On 3 April HEP wrote to the Liquidators to demand the
return of the money. The Liquidators’ solicitors, M/s Drew & Napier LLC ("DN")
replied on 5 April and requested for a week to obtain their clients’
instructions. Very properly, DN confirmed that in the meantime the Liquidators
would not draw down on the money. The parties eventually agreed to take out
this application for a determination as to the Claimant’s rights in respect of
the Monies. Because the payment was made in Australian currency, the Monies
have throughout been kept separate and identifiable from the other funds of
the Company.

5 The Claimant based its claim on two alternative grounds:

> (1) on the principle in _Ex parte James_ ; and
>
> (2) on the basis that the Company is a constructive trustee of the Monies.

_

The _Ex parte James_ principle

_

6 Counsel for the Claimant, Mr Quahe, submitted that on the principle in _Ex
parte James, re Condon_ (1874) LR 9 Ch App, the Court ought to order the
Liquidators to refund the Monies. In _Re PCChip Computer Manufacturer (S) Pte
Ltd_ [2001] 3 SLR 296, I had applied the principle in _Ex parte James_ and
ordered the Liquidators to refund a sum of money mistakenly paid by the bank
to them in the course of the winding up of the company. In coming to that
decision I had been guided by the four conditions suggested by Walton J in _In
re Clark (A Bankrupt), Ex parte The Trustee v Texaco Ltd_ [1975] 1 WLR 559,
viz:

> (i) There must be some form of enrichment of the assets of the bankrupt by
> the claimant;
>
> (ii) The claimant must not be in a position to submit an ordinary proof of
> debt;
>
> (iii) In all the circumstances of the case an honest person would consider
> that it would only be fair to return the money to the claimant; and
>
> (iv) The principle applies only to the extent necessary to nullify the
> enrichment of the estate.

Mr Quahe submitted that all four conditions were met in the present case and
therefore the Court ought to make a similar order.

7 I pointed out to Mr Quahe that condition (ii), i.e. that the claimant must
not be in a position to submit an ordinary proof of debt, was not met in the
present case. This is because the payment of the Monies was made before the
Company passed the special resolution for winding up. In _Re PCChip_ ,
although the bank had mistakenly credited the company’s account before the
winding up order was made, the money was paid over to the liquidators only
after the winding up order. Merely to credit the company’s bank account does
not tantamount a payment as it is in the nature of the banking relationship
that this only reflects a debt owed by the bank to its client.

8 However as I had pointed out in _Re PCChip_ (at 36), the four conditions
distilled by Walton J in _In re Clark_ are not rigid rules of law because the
principle in _Ex parte James_ is a statement of general policy. While those
conditions are useful as a guide to the application of the principle,
especially in a border-line situation, the failure to meet one or more
conditions does not by itself determine the matter.

9 The more important factor that distinguishes the present case from _Re
PCChip_ is the fact that here the Company is being wound up voluntarily. The
Liquidators are not appointed by the Court but by resolution of the Company.
Mr Quahe urged that there should not be any distinction drawn between
liquidators appointed by the Court and those appointed by special resolution
of the company. Indeed support for his position can be found in (2001) 2 SAL
Ann Rev at 14.23 in which the learned reviewer stated as follows:

> 14.23 Another consequence is that, according to the English courts, the
> application of the principle is restricted only to court-appointed
> liquidators and does not apply to liquidators conducting a voluntary
> liquidation (_Re T H Knitwear (Wholesale) Ltd_ [1988] 2 WLR 276). This is
> anomalous given that, in reality, the roles and responsibilities of a
> liquidator in both types of winding up are similar to a very large extent,
> not to mention the awkward implication that a liquidator of a voluntary
> winding up need not act honourably. Neither is it clear why the legal result
> should differ according to whether a recipient of a payment made under a
> mistake is in compulsory or voluntary liquidation. Notably, there is an
> Australian authority which has held that the _Ex parte James_ principle
> applies to both types of liquidators (_Re Autolook Pty Ltd_ (1983) 8 ACLR
> 419).

10 Unfortunately the existence of an anomaly cannot grant the Court a
jurisdiction that it otherwise does not have. In the cases where the _Ex parte
James_ principle has been applied, jurisdiction is founded on the fact the
liquidator is appointed by the Court pursuant to its statutory powers under
the Companies Act. The liquidator acts under the supervision and direction of
the Court which will not permit him to exercise his powers unconscionably.
This principle has been developed by the Courts in response to situations
where injustice could otherwise result. The fact that the Court would be
unable to apply this principle in the case of a voluntary liquidation does not
make it any less valid.

11 The decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in _Re Autolook Pty
Ltd_ (1983) 8 ACLR 419 represents a very interesting application of the _Ex
parte James_ principle. The liquidator there had applied to the court for
directions as to whether he ought to disclose to the Commissioner of Taxation
information he had uncovered in the course of his examination of the company’s
officers which indicated that the income of the company was probably much
higher than was disclosed in the documents that he had earlier submitted. The
liquidator’s intention in that application was (at p.420): _"to know whether
he should alert the … Commissioner to this probability, or whether he is
justified in saying nothing about it."_ Needham J considered the relevant
legislation and held there was no legal obligation on the part of the
liquidator to give this information. He then continued (at p.420):

> " If there is a duty in the liquidator, therefore, to alert the …
> Commissioner … it must arise out of general principle. It is clear that a
> liquidator has a duty to act impartially and a duty to discover who are the
> creditors of the company … I was not referred to, nor have I found, any case
> in which the liquidator has been held liable where he fails to inform a
> creditor who lodges a proof that the evidence in his possession would
> indicte that creditor had filed to claim the full amount due to him. Any
> such duty must be implied from his duties to act honestly and impartially.
>
> It is my opinion that if a liquidator were aware that a creditor had
> understated his claim he would be acting less than honestly and impartially
> if he distributed that assets available for payment to creditors without
> informing the creditor of the facts known to him. In doing so he would be
> acting on what he knew was a false basis and he would be preferring the
> other creditors to the extent that the one creditor had understated his
> claim. I do not think that any different principle would apply where the
> information in the liquidator’s possession fails to instil complete
> conviction that the claim is understated but leads to a sense of strong
> probability that it is.
>
> The principle to which I have referred is, I think, supported by the well-
> known statement of Sir W M James LJ in _Ex parte James_ …:
>
> "I am of the opinion that a trustee in bankruptcy is an officer of the
> Court. He has inquisitorial powers given him by the Court, and the Court
> regards him as its officer, and he is to hold money in his hands upon trust
> for its equitable distribution among the creditors. The Court, then, finding
> that he has in his hands moneys which in equity belongs to someone else,
> ought to set an example to the world by paying it to the person really
> entitled to it. In my opinion the Court of Bankruptcy ought to be as honest
> as other people."
>
> I do not think that the principle applies only to officers of the court. Any
> liquidator, whether an officer of the court or not, who applies to the court
> for directions, should have those directions which require him to perform
> his duties honestly.

12 The judge then directed the liquidator to advise the Deputy Commissioner of
the matter. As can be seen from the last paragraph cited above, the basis for
this is that a court will require any liquidator who applies to the court for
directions, whether or not he is an officer of the court, to act honestly.
However the court there did not appear to have considered _Re TH Knitwear
(Wholesale)_ [1988] Ch 275 in which the English Court of Appeal unanimously
and firmly decided against giving a similar direction to a private liquidator.
Slade LJ, with whom Glidewell LJ agreed, said (at p.289) that the _Ex parte
James_ principle introduced _"a less than welcome element of uncertainty"_ and
said that he would not extend it to private liquidators. The third judge of
the court, Caulfield J also agreed with this, noting that the authorities
point to the principle being restricted to officers of the court. In view of
this, and of the fact that the basis of the _Ex parte James_ principle is that
a court will not allow its officers to act dishonourably, I must respectfully
disagree that the decision in _Re Autolook Pty Ltd_ should be followed in
Singapore.

_

Constructive trust

_

13 Mr Quahe submitted that in the circumstances of the case, the Liquidators
are constructive trustees of the Monies of which the Claimant is the
beneficiary. Those circumstances are as follows:

> (i) the Claimant had paid the Monies to the Company under a mistake of fact;
>
> (ii) the Company was notified of the fact of the mistake before the winding
> up resolution was made;
>
> (iii) the Monies are kept in a separate account and are not mixed with the
> other funds of the Company;

14 Counsel for the Liquidators, Mr Sandrasegara, did not dispute the facts
outlined above. Indeed, Mr Sandrasegara informed me that the Liquidators do
not really dispute the claim but they seek the sanction of the Court for any
payment. However Mr Sandrasegara adopted an adversarial position in order to
provide the Court with full arguments, for which I am extremely grateful. In
relation to the question of knowledge, Mr Sandrasegara pointed out that there
was no evidence that the officers of the Company were notified of the matter.
The Claimants were only in communication with the officers of KPMG who had
become involved in the affairs of the Company in anticipation of liquidation.
Mr Sandrasegara submitted that this did not impute knowledge on the Company.
While I accept that this appears to be correct, for the purpose of the present
action, such knowledge on the part of KPMG would be a relevant factor because
the Company was effectively inoperative at the time and KPMG had gone into the
Company to prepare for the eventual liquidation. Crucially, the KPMG officer
had held out to the Claimant that he was in a position to deal with the
matter. If he had advised that he was not in such a position, the Claimant
could have taken some other course of action.

15 Mr Quahe relied firstly on the decision of English High Court in _Chase
Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd_ [1981] 1 Ch. 105. That
case concerned a mistaken payment of some US$2 million by the plaintiff, a New
York bank, to the defendant, a London bank. A few months after the payment,
the defendant was ordered to be wound up. The question before the court was
whether the plaintiff was entitled in equity to trace the mistaken payment and
to recover it. Goulding J held that where money was paid under a mistake of
fact, the payer retains an equitable property in it and the recipient, whose
conscience is subjected to a fiduciary duty to respect this proprietary right,
holds the money as a trustee for the payer. On this basis, the payer is
entitled to trace the money founded on a persistent proprietary interest.

16 However the _Chase Manhattan_ decision was criticised by Lord Browne-
Wilkinson in _Westdeutsche Bank v Islington LBC_ [1996] AC 669, where he said
as follows (at p 714):

> It will be apparent from what I have already said that I cannot agree with
> this reasoning. First, it is based on a concept of retaining an equitable
> property in money where, prior to the payment to the recipient bank, there
> was no existing equitable interest. Further, I cannot understand how the
> recipient's "conscience" can be affected at a time when he is not aware of
> any mistake. Finally, the judge found that the law of England and that of
> New York were in substance the same. I find this a surprising conclusion
> since the New York law of constructive trusts has for a long time been
> influenced by the concept of a remedial constructive trust, whereas hitherto
> English law has for the most part only recognised an institutional
> constructive trust: see _Metall und Rohstoff A.G. v. Donaldson Lufkin
> Jenrette Inc._ [1990] 1 Q.B. 391, 478-480.

17 Mr Quahe submitted that, notwithstanding the criticism of Lord Browne-
Wilkinson, the _Chase Manhattan_ case had been followed by the High Court in
_Standard Chartered Bank v Sin Chong Hua Electric & Trading _[1995] 3 SLR 863.
In the latter case the court found that the first defendant had induced the
plaintiff bank to pay over a sum of money through a fraudulent scheme and that
the second, third and fourth defendants to whom the money were eventually
paid, were not bona fide purchasers for value. Accordingly they became
constructive trustees of the plaintiffs’ money in their possession. The court
did not rely on the _Chase Manhattan_ case for this conclusion and only cited
it for the proposition that the plaintiff was entitled to trace such money
founded on a persistent equitable proprietary interest. The _ratio decidendi_
of the _Chase Manhattan_ case, which is that the recipient of money paid under
a mistake of fact holds it as trustee for the payer, was not followed in
_Standard Chartered Bank v Sin Chong Hua Electric & Trading_.

18 The ratio in the _Chase Manhattan_ case has not been followed in any
Singaporean decision submitted before me. Indeed in _PP v Intra Group
(Holdings) Co Inc_ [1999] 1 SLR 803, Yong CJ pointed out that the finding in
the _Chase Manhattan_ case, i.e. that there was a proprietary claim, did not
sit on all fours with the decision in the _Westdeutsche Bank_ case.

19 However Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in his speech in _Westdeutsche Bank_ ,
suggested that the _Chase Manhattan_ case could be explained on the basis that
the defendant bank knew of the mistake two days after it was made. He said
this at p.715:

> However, although I do not accept the reasoning of Goulding J., _Chase
> Manhattan_ may well have been rightly decided. The defendant bank knew of
> the mistake made by the paying bank within two days of the receipt of the
> moneys: see at p. 115A. The judge treated this fact as irrelevant (p.114F)
> but in my judgment it may well provide a proper foundation for the decision.
> Although the mere receipt of the moneys, in ignorance of the mistake, gives
> rise to no trust, the retention of the moneys after the recipient bank
> learned of the mistake may well have given rise to a constructive trust: see
> _Snell's Equity_ , p. 193; _Pettit, Equity and the Law of Trusts_ , 7th ed.
> (1993) p.168; _Metall und Rohstoff A.G. v. Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Inc._
> [1990] 1 Q.B. 391, 473-474.

20 The _Westdeutsche Bank_ case concerned an interest rate swap agreement
between the bank and a local authority. It was later determined that the
authority had acted _ultra vires_ in entering into the agreement. However by
that time the bank had paid certain sums of money to the authority. The bank
obtained judgment for the principal sum and was awarded compound interest. One
of the issues in the appeal to the House of Lords was whether the authority
held the money on a resulting trust, in which case compound interest could be
awarded. Lord Browne-Wilkinson set out four propositions fundamental to the
law of trusts at p.705:

> (i) Equity operates on the conscience of the owner of the legal interest. In
> the case of a trust, the conscience of the legal owner requires him to carry
> out the purposes for which the property was vested in him (express or
> implied trust) or which the law imposes on him by reason of his
> unconscionable conduct (constructive trust).
>
> (ii) Since the equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends upon the
> conscience of the holder of the legal interest being affected, he cannot be
> a trustee of the property if and so long as he is ignorant of the facts
> alleged to affect his conscience, i.e. until he is aware that he is intended
> to hold the property for the benefit of others in the case of an express or
> implied trust, or, in the case of a constructive trust, of the factors which
> are alleged to affect his conscience.
>
> (iii) In order to establish a trust there must be identifiable trust
> property. The only apparent exception to this rule is a constructive trust
> imposed on a person who dishonestly assists in a breach of trust who may
> come under fiduciary duties even if he does not receive identifiable trust
> property.
>
> (iv) Once a trust is established, as from the date of its establishment the
> beneficiary has, in equity, a proprietary interest in the trust property,
> which proprietary interest will be enforceable in equity against any
> subsequent holder of the property (whether the original property or
> substituted property into which it can be traced) other than a purchaser for
> value of the legal interest without notice.

21 Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, the persons in
effective control of the Company (the KPMG officers) had knowledge that the
Monies were paid by mistake before the winding up resolution was passed. The
Monies are an identifiable fund in a separate account that is not mixed with
the other funds of the Company. This last fact puts it in a stronger position
than the _Chase Manhattan_ case where there was no finding that the money was
not mixed by the time the mistake was notified to the defendant two days after
the payment. In _Westdeutsche Bank_ Lord Browne-Wilkinson had himself warned
of the danger of wholesale importation of equitable principles into commercial
law (at p.704):

> My Lords, wise judges have often warned against the wholesale importation
> into commercial law of equitable principles inconsistent with the certainty
> and speed which are essential requirements for the orderly conduct of
> business affairs: see _Barnes v. Addy_ (1874) L.R. 9 Ch.App. 244, 251 and
> 255; _Scandinavian Trading Tanker Co. A.B. v. Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana_
> [1983] 2 A.C. 694, 703-704. If the bank's arguments are correct, a
> businessman who has entered into transactions relating to or dependent upon
> property rights could find that assets which apparently belong to one person
> in fact belong to another; that there are "off balance sheet" liabilities of
> which he cannot be aware; that these property rights and liabilities arise
> from circumstances unknown not only to himself but also to anyone else who
> has been involved in the transactions. A new area of unmanageable risk will
> be introduced into commercial dealings. If the due application of equitable
> principles forced a conclusion leading to these results, your Lordships
> would be presented with a formidable task in reconciling legal principle
> with commercial common sense.

22 None of the problems pointed out is a feature of the present case due to
the fact that the Monies have not been mixed with the Company’s funds.
Moreover the Claimant had not intended to enter into a commercial transaction
with the Company; it was purely a case of the Monies being paid to the wrong
party. So the present case is different from the situation in _Chase
Manhattan_ , where the plaintiff had intended to pay the defendant the money
but had mistakenly made a second payment. That case involved a payer who had
intended to give the money to the recipient, although under the mistaken
belief that he was obliged to do so. The present case is one where the
Claimant had intended to pay a third party, but due to a mistake the payment
is made to the Company. The moment the Company learnt of the mistaken payment
it was unconscionable on its part to retain it. However it was perfectly
reasonable for the Company to investigate the matter before returning the
Monies and pending such investigation, the Monies were rightly kept separate
and unmixed. Unfortunately the winding up resolution intervened before the
Monies could be returned. I can see nothing in the present case that would
stand in the way of the imposition of a constructive trust.

23 I therefore hold that the Company holds the Monies under a constructive
trust for the benefit of the Claimant prior to the winding up. Accordingly
sanction would be given to the Liquidators to make payment of the Monies to
the Claimant. As to costs, counsel informed me that the parties have a prior
agreement on this and that I should make no order in that respect.
