Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Reformative training – Order
for reformative training falls consecutive to previous term of reformative
training – Whether new sentence should commence on date of conviction for new
charges – Whether new sentence, contrary to aim of reformative training – Sch
D para 4 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)  
  

: Before district judge Kow Keng Siong on 16 February 2000, the respondent
pleaded guilty to four charges, namely, one count of vandalism under s 3 of
the Vandalism Act (Cap 341), committed when he cut his Electronic Monitoring
Scheme (`EMS`) tag, and three counts of failing to report for urine testing
contrary to reg 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment
and Rehabilitation) Regulations 1976. The district judge sentenced him to
reformative training and ordered that the sentence commence on the same date
as the respondent`s prior term of reformative training. The Public Prosecutor
brought a petition for revision for the sentence to commence on the date of
conviction of the present charges, 16 February 2000. Before me, counsel for
the respondent submitted that she was instructed not to oppose the petition.
Nevertheless, I have set out these grounds to provide some clarification on
the issues before the court.  
  
**_Background_**

****

The case on revision concerned offences committed while the respondent was
undergoing supervision following his release from the reformative training
centre (`RTC`). The respondent was first sentenced to reformative training for
offences relating to robbery and misuse of drugs on 10 March 1997. He served
31 months and 24 days of this sentence before being released from the
reformative training centre into aftercare supervision on 3 November 1999.
This supervision was to expire on 9 March 2001. Pursuant to para 13, Sch D of
the CPC, two of the conditions of supervision were that the respondent agree
to be subject to urine tests as directed by his aftercare officer and that the
respondent abide by the EMS agreement.  
  
The respondent failed to present himself for urine testing on 3, 5 and 7
January. On 9 January 2000, he cut off his EMS tag. In addition, he had
breached other conditions of his release with regard to his employment, curfew
hours at home and reporting to his aftercare officer. On 13 January 2000, the
respondent was remanded at Queenstown Remand Prison on the present charges. An
Order for Recall to the reformative training centre was subsequently issued on
25 January 2000. The respondent pleaded guilty to the present charges on 16
February 2000.  
  
**_The petition for revision_**

****

I allowed a similar petition for revision on 6 April 2000 and this is reported
at **PP v Mohamed Noor bin Abdul Majeed** [2000] 3 SLR 17 . In that case, I
referred to the reformative training regime provided in Sch D of the CPC, and
referred specifically to para 4 of that Schedule, which reads:

> _If any person while under supervision, or after his recall to a reformative
> training centre, as aforesaid, is sentenced to corrective training or
> reformative training his original sentence of reformative training shall
> cease to have effect; and if any such person is so sentenced to
> imprisonment, any period for which he is imprisoned under that sentence
> shall count as part of the period for which he is liable to detention in a
> reformative training centre under his original sentence._

  
  
I found that para 4 applied to fact scenarios such as that of the present
petition where a respondent was sentenced for offences committed during the
supervision period following release from RTC. It was clear that in such
circumstances, the existing RTC sentence `ceased to have effect` and the new
RTC sentence should commence on the date of his conviction of the fresh
offences.  
  
However, some clarification is needed on the authorities discussed. The
district judge in **_PP v Mohamed Noor_** had relied on **Ng Kwok Fai v PP**
[1996] 1 SLR 568  as holding any imposition of consecutive orders of
reformative training to be inappropriate. Hence the order that the second
sentence of reformative training was to commence on the same date as the
first. In distinguishing **_Ng Kwok Fai_** , greater emphasis should be placed
on the practical implications of these different fact patterns. In Ng Kwok
Fai, I expressed the view that a sentence of imprisonment immediately
consequent to reformative training would run counter to the aim of reformative
training as it could undo what the reformative training was meant to do. I
also held that consecutive terms of reformative training were not desirable,
and hence ordered the second reformative training sentence imposed in **_Ng
Kwok Fai_** to commence on the same date as the first.  
  
This is to be distinguished from the fact sequence in cases such as Mohamed
Noor and the present petition, where RTC sentences are ordered for offences
committed while the respondent is under supervision post-RTC release. In these
cases, the fact that an order for reformative training falls consecutive to a
separate term of reformative training does not run counter to the aim of
reformative training. This is because it is ordered after the respondent has
substantially performed one sentence of reformative training. In other words,
it is after the respondent has been given sufficient opportunity to benefit
from reformative training. Paragraph 4 of Sch D provides that in such
instances the first term of reformative training then ceases to have effect.
It then falls to judicial discretion whether or not to order reformative
training or imprisonment for the fresh charges. The fact of having committed
offences while on supervision may indicate the success or otherwise of
reformative training on the particular respondent and perhaps his personal
resolve to `turn over a new leaf`. If the conviction so warrants, the court
may order imprisonment. In this case, on the respondent`s charge of vandalism,
he was liable to a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of up to three years
and caning of not less than three strokes and not more than eight strokes. The
court below was of the view that reformative training remained appropriate for
the respondent. Furthermore, I noted the respondent`s submissions in
mitigation and his father`s involvement in the present application provided
encouraging signs not to disturb the order for reformative training.  
  
**_Conclusion_**

****

For these reasons, I allowed the Public Prosecutor`s petition and revised the
sentence of reformative training to commence on 16 February 2000.  
  
**Outcome:**

Petition allowed.
