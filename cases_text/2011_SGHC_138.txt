Introduction

1 In this case pertaining to ancillary matters, there are three outstanding
issues to be resolved between the parties: (i) division of matrimonial assets,
(ii) maintenance for the wife and (iii) maintenance for the children of the
marriage.

2 [AQT] (“the Husband”) and [AQU] (“the Wife”) were married on 5 June 1992.
The Husband filed for divorce on 22 December 2007. The divorce was contested.
An interim judgment of divorce was eventually granted on 20 January 2009 to
the Wife based on her counterclaim. The marriage lasted 17 years. The Husband
is aged 50 and is currently the Head of e-FX Sales, South East Asia, at a
foreign bank, [A] Bank, in Singapore. The Wife is 48 years old and is a home-
maker. There are three children of the marriage _viz_ 2 daughters aged 15 and
9 and a son aged 13.

3 The Wife and the children are currently residing in the United Kingdom
(“UK”) at a house in Chesham (“the Matrimonial Home”). The Court granted leave
on 18 July 2008 for the Wife and the children to return to the UK. The Husband
had to facilitate the Wife’s relocation and pay for all of the children’s
living and school expenses in the UK. A further court order was made on 11 May
2009 for additional reimbursement to the Wife of relocation expenses and for
the Husband to pay £2,100 per month (£700 for each child) for the children’s
living expenses, exclusive of the children’s school fees which were to be paid
in addition to their living expenses. The Court also ordered that the Husband
provide a 7-seater car for the children which the Wife purchased second hand a
Vauxhall model, at £10,800.

4 On 24 March 2010, the parties entered into a consent order for the custody,
care and control of the children. The parties would have joint custody of the
children with care and control to the Wife and specific terms of access for
the Husband. Between July and September 2010, parties exchanged Offers to
Settle but were unable to reach any agreement on the outstanding ancillary
issues. Both parties have since filed several affidavits relating to the
ancillaries – six by the Husband and five by the Wife.

Should the Bemali Trust be treated as a matrimonial asset?

5 The Bemali Trust was established by the Husband and was valued at
£465,791.93 as at 17 May 2010. From the trust documents, it was noted that the
Husband had irrevocably transferred the beneficial ownership of the Bemali
Trust to his three children. The Wife argued that the Bemali Trust should be
treated as a matrimonial asset because the Husband had unilaterally set it up
using a substantial portion of their savings (£480,000), which was meant for
the family. The Bemali Trust was established within the same week that the
Husband said he wanted a divorce and mere months before the Husband filed for
divorce.

6 The Husband contended that the funds used to set up the Bemali Trust were
wholly acquired and earned by him with no monetary contribution from the Wife.
However, the funds used to set it up were acquired during the marriage.
Therefore, while it is clear from the trust document that the beneficial
ownership of the Bemali Trust belongs neither to the Husband nor to the Wife,
technically the £480,000 used to set up the Bemali Trust was a matrimonial
asset.

7 However, I will not notionally place the £480,000 used in setting up the
Bemali Trust into the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. It is within
the Court’s just and equitable discretion under s 112 of the Women’s Charter
(Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) to decide not to exercise its
discretion to order division of assets that are technically matrimonial
assets. In _Lim Ngeok Yuen v Lim Soon Heng Victor_ [2006] SGHC 83 at [45], the
Court held that while the wife’s interest in the Arcadia property was
technically a matrimonial asset, it would exercise its discretion to exempt it
from division as she had bought the property sometime after the parties
separated and the husband had ceased to make contributions to the family. In
this case, it is just and equitable to exempt the Bemali Trust from the pool
of matrimonial assets since the terms of the Bemali Trust showed that it was
intended for the children’s benefit, which is consistent with the aims of the
matrimonial partnership. This is also consonant with s 122(2)(c) of the
Charter, which states that one of the main considerations for division under s
122(2) is “the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage”. The Bemali
Trust also has the benefit of ringfencing the funds from inheritance tax in
the UK, which the Husband alleged would decrease the funds by £200,000.

8 I note that the Wife was not against the Bemali Trust _per se_ but was
concerned that the Husband would in the future renege on his intention that
the children would be the beneficiaries under the trust. I am satisfied from
the Memorandum of Settlor’s wishes that the Wife’s fears were unfounded. The
Bemali Trust is meant to safeguard the assets for the children and is not
available to the Husband or the Wife or their future spouses. The Bemali Trust
will pay for the schooling expenses of the three children until the completion
of their first degree. The Bemali Trust is also meant to provide both
daughters with a capital sum on their attaining 25 years of age. The Husband
also foresaw that the son (who has special needs as he suffers from Williams
syndrome) will remain a dependant of the Bemali Trust for much of his life (or
possibly, his entire lifetime) until he can support himself independently. The
son’s capital sum will remain in the trust and the Bemali Trust will continue
to provide for him. The wife, as the primary caretaker of the children, will
benefit from the Bemali Trust which provides certainty for the children’s
long-term financial needs.

9 If the Husband had (just before the divorce) set up a trust for someone
completely unrelated to his marriage, _eg_ , his brother, it may then be just
and equitable for the Court to notionally place the £480,000 back into the
pool of matrimonial assets. In fact, s 132 of the Charter can be used to
“claw-back” this asset if the Husband had disposed of it with the object of
reducing his means to pay maintenance or depriving the Wife of any rights in
relation to the property (see _NI v NJ_ [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75). However, the
facts clearly do not fall within s 132 of the Charter because the Husband did
not have such a motive in setting up the Bemali Trust for his children.
Therefore, as I had informed the parties at the hearing, the Bemali Trust will
not be treated as part of the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided.

Did the Husband make full and frank disclosure of his Assets?

10 The Wife did not accept that the Husband had disclosed all of his assets.
The Wife made several allegations against the Husband as the bases for drawing
an adverse inference against the Husband. I will consider each allegation in
turn.

(i) Missing Documents in the Husband’s Discovery Affidavit

11 The Wife alleged that the Husband did not provide certain documents in his
discovery affidavit that he indicated he would provide:

(a) The Husband was supposed to provide his monthly bank statements showing
salary deposits, all other income commissions and bonuses from January 2007 to
date. However, he only provided documents from May 2009 onwards.

(b) The Husband was supposed to provide his P60sUk document (evidencing amount
of income tax paid in UK) from 2008 to date. He only provided that for 2009.

(c) The Husband was supposed to provide his bank statements for DBS account
no. 1 [xxx] from January 2007 to date. His statements for June and July 2008
were missing.

(d) The Husband was supposed to provide his bank statements for DBS account
no. 2 [xxx] from January 2007 to date. He only provided statements from May
2008 onwards.

The Wife also alleged that the Husband did not provide the April 2000 credit
card statement for Amex account no [xxx] but this was not true.

12 The Husband disagreed that he failed to provide the documents required for
breach (a). He stated that he provided all his monthly bank statements showing
salary deposits, all other income commissions and bonuses from January 2007 as
requested. The Husband admitted he did not provide the monthly payslips for
the years 2007 and 2008, but the Wife was wrong to state he provided documents
only from May 2009 onwards because he provided the payslips for January to
April 2009 (both months inclusive). Furthermore, the Husband had already
provided his Notice of Assessment for the year 2007 and his income tax return
for the year ended 31 December 2008 to show his total income for those years.
Therefore, I am satisfied that the Husband was not hiding his income for the
years 2007 to 2008.

13 Regarding breach (b), I accept the Husband’s explanation that he had
already disclosed an email from his accountants in the UK, Morgan Hamilton
Inghams, dated 7 September 2009, in response to his request for his P60sUK
document for the year 2008. The response was self-explanatory: “You would not
have received a P60 as you left during the year”. There is accordingly no
breach of (b).

14 The Husband explained that for breach (c), there were no statements for the
months of June and July 2008 because another DBS credit card account no. [xxx]
was closed on 21 May 2008 and a new credit card was issued under the DBS
account no. 1 [xxx], which he only started using in August 2008. Regarding
breach (d), the Husband explained that he had already disclosed all the bank
statements in his possession. It is fair to state that the credit card and
bank statements already disclosed in the Husband’s discovery affidavit were
voluminous. I am satisfied that breaches (c) and (d), if they can even be
considered breaches, were minor and not intentional on the Husband’s part to
hide his assets.

15 The Wife also submitted that the Husband only disclosed the trust documents
for the Bemali Trust in his second affidavit. While this is true, I will not
draw an adverse inference against the Husband solely because of this since (i)
the Husband disclosed the existence of the Bemali Trust and its value in his
first affidavit, (ii) he also disclosed the trust documents when the Wife took
out a discovery application for it and (iii) he had a legitimate reason for
not filing the documents the first time – he did not think the Bemali Trust
was a matrimonial asset.

(ii) Inconsistencies in the Husband’s Letter of Employment dated 16 March 2009

16 The Wife alleged that the Letter of Employment with [B] Pte Ltd first
produced in the Husband’s first affidavit left out a statement relating to a
potential commission of S$320,000 if the sales target was met (“Commission
clause”). This Commission clause was present in a _second_ version of the
Letter of Employment produced in the Husband’s second affidavit. On the face
of the documents, it did suggest that the Husband was less than honest in his
first affidavit, but I note that this omission was readily rectified in his
second affidavit and it related to his income in his previous job in 2009. The
Husband also explained that the two versions were genuine and he did not
doctor the Letter of Employment in his first affidavit. The first employment
contract did not include the Commission clause which was verbally agreed and
he requested for a fresh employment contract with the clause. The use of the
first employment contract in his first affidavit was an error.

17 Although the Wife requested the Husband to account for the S$320,000
commission, I note that the commission was not guaranteed to the Husband and
would only be given if he had met the sales target. The Husband submitted that
he did not earn this commission and his actual earnings in 2009 were evidenced
from the pay slips issued by [B] Pte Ltd which he had already disclosed in his
first affidavit. Therefore, unless there were other clear instances of the
Husband being dishonest, I would not draw an adverse inference against the
Husband that he hid the commission of S$320,000. The evidence supports the
fact that the Husband had made full and frank disclosure of the income he
gained from [B] Pte Ltd.

(iii) Husband estimating his assets to be worth S$6 million in an insurance
policy questionnaire in 2008

18 The Wife believed that the Husband has other assets he did not disclose
because the Husband had in a Financial Questionnaire for his Great Eastern
insurance policy in 2008 estimated his assets to be worth S$6m. I find the
Husband’s explanation of this estimate reasonable – he explained that the
estimation was rough, was based on an exchange rate of £1 = S$3 and did not
take into account his liabilities. Furthermore, his income for 2006 and 2007
was supplemented by large bonus payments for those years and those large
bonuses have since ceased. I do not find the estimate to be strong enough
evidence to support the adverse inference the Wife wanted the Court to draw.

(iv) Undisclosed rental income from Phuket Condominium and lack of supporting
documents to support the liability outstanding on Phuket Condominium

19 The Husband had two condominium units in Phuket (“the Phuket
Condominiums”). The Husband stated in his sixth affidavit filed on 25 November
2010, that he recently sold his Phuket Condominium, Unit No. A[X], Kata Noi
Road, Kata Karon (“A[X]”), The Height and bought a smaller unit, Unit No. B[X]
(“B[X]”), in the same development. He sold A[X] for THB34,900,000 and used the
proceeds of A[X] to purchase B[X] and make part payment of the outstanding
loan. The Husband alleged that B[X] is worth THB20,000,000 and has an
outstanding liability of £191,000. The Wife submitted during the ancillary
hearing that there was no document to support the Husband’s assertion that
there was an outstanding liability of £191,000.

20 It is true that the Husband failed to provide direct documentary evidence
of the outstanding liability of £191,000. However, in his first and sixth
affidavit, the Husband provided documentary evidence that:

(a) his outstanding mortgage for A[X] was THB22,597,269.04;

(b) he sold A[X] for THB34,900,000; and

(c) the Sale and Purchase Agreement Statement (dated 22 November 2010) stated
that the Husband received THB12,975,000 (after purchasing B[X] for
THB20,000,000 and deducting the Agent’s and Lawyer’s fees).

Therefore, based on the documentary evidence, the Husband explained that he
used the proceeds of A[X] (THB 34,900,000) to purchase B[X] (THB 20,000,000)
and was left with THB 12,975,000 (after deducting the Agent and Lawyer’s
fees). The Husband then explained at the hearing that he used the remaining
proceeds of THB 12,975,000 to pay off the outstanding mortgage on A[X] (THB
22,597,269.04), which would leave a remaining outstanding mortgage of THB
9,622,269.04 (S$ 449,034.43). This amount is larger than the £ 191,000 (S$
391,500) the Husband claims to be now outstanding, although the discrepancy
differs according to the currency conversion rate of the pound sterling
against the Singapore dollar. I noted that the currency of the outstanding
liability changed from Thai baht to pound sterling and the Husband did not
produce any documents to show the link between the outstanding mortgage of
A[X] and B[X]. The Husband explained in his sixth affidavit that he could not
provide the documents, because the documents were not available at that time.
On the whole, I am satisfied from the Husband’s disclosure of all his bank
statements that the remaining outstanding mortgage of THB 9,622,269.04 had not
been paid off and it was unlikely he could have paid off such a large and
substantial amount of debt since A[X] was sold and B[X] purchased in November
2010. I was satisfied that regardless of whether the outstanding mortgage
stems from A[X] or B[X], the outstanding liability of £ 191,000 the Husband
alleges does exist. The Wife also made no objections to the Husband’s claim of
the outstanding liability, even in her reply affidavit filed in January 2011
after the Husband filed his sixth affidavit regarding the purchase of B[X];
she only raised such objections at the hearing itself. I will not draw the
adverse inference that the Wife seemed to implicitly alleged which was that
the Husband had secretly paid off the outstanding mortgage of his Phuket
Condominiums and is trying to reduce the pool of matrimonial assets.

21 I also accept the Husband’s explanation that there was no rental income
left undisclosed because the tenancy agreement was for A[X], which has been
sold.

(v) New overdrafts in new credit card accounts opened with unknown purposes

22 The Wife alleged during the ancillary hearing that the new overdrafts in
the new credit card accounts as tabulated below were opened for unknown
purposes.

**Credit Card Account** |  **Overdraft Amount as at 25 October 2010**  
---|---  
UOB Cashplus [xxx] |  S$24,166.96  
UOB Visa Signature [xxx] |  S$6,883.82  
UOB Balance Transfer |  S$13,212.63  
  
  

23 I accept the Husband’s explanation that the new overdrafts were opened
simply because he switched credit cards. The Husband’s AMEX and DBS accounts
were not used and he used his UOB accounts instead. An example of a previous
overdraft in evidence was his DBS Black Amex credit card [xxx] which had no
overdraft as at 25 October 2010.

(vi) Instances of large and suspicious activities in Husband’s bank accounts

24 The Wife alleged at the hearing that there were large flows of money in and
out of the Husband’s bank accounts that were “suspicious”. These “suspicious”
transactions are tabulated below:

|  **Bank Account** |  **Wife’s Allegations of Suspicious Transactions**  
---|---|---  
A |  SG Private Banking Call Deposit Account a/c No. 1 [xxx] (Account closed as of 12 August 2009) |  Wife alleged S$133,350 was transferred out on 28 May 2008.  
B |  SG Hambros Call Deposit Account a/c No. 1 [xxx] (Account closed as of 12 August 2009) |  Wife noted there was a balance of £194,616.36 as at October 2007, but it was transferred out.  
C |  SG Private Banking Account No. 2 [xxx] (Owned jointly by Husband and Wife) |  Presently, nil value. Wife alleged funds removed following parties’ separation.  
D |  Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited No [xxx] (“Thai Bank Account”) |  The Wife alleged that the Thai Bank Account had large suspicious withdrawals of cash.  
E |  DBS Account No. 3 [xxx] |  Wife alleged instances of suspicious and large activity in the bank account.  
F |  UOB I Account No. 1 [xxx] |  Wife alleged instances of suspicious and large activity in the bank account.  
  
  

25 I am not satisfied that the transactions were suspicious. I find the
Husband’s explanations for all the withdrawals reasonable. Regarding
transaction (a), it is clear from the bank statement that the Husband was
making foreign exchange transactions (“forex transactions”) based on the
exchange rate of the pound. While there was a debit of S$133,350.00 on 28 May
2008 (referred to as FX GBP 50,000.00 @ 2.6670 in the bank statement), there
was also a credit of S$138,015.00 on 28 May 2008 (referred to as FX GBP
50,000.00 @ 2.7603 in the bank statement). Therefore, the Husband submitted
the transfer was not a withdrawal but a forex transaction with S$5,000 profit
made.

26 Regarding transaction (b), the Husband said there was nothing suspicious
about the transfer of £194,616.36, which was made to his QROPS pension fund.
As for transaction (c), the bank statements from January 2007 to March 2009
(when it became nil value) showed series of debts and credits into this
account even before the parties separated on November 2007. There was no
evidence that the Husband deliberately removed funds from this account. For a
year and a half after the parties separated, the bank statements showed a
constant stream of withdrawals and credits which seemed to be consistent with
the Husband’s testimony that he used his forex trading skills to increase the
family’s assets. _Prima facie_ , there is insufficient evidence to support the
Wife’s contention that the Husband was deliberately removing funds from this
bank account. Transactions (e) and (f) were similar to transaction (c).

27 Regarding transaction (d), the Thai Bank Account was only disclosed in the
Husband’s third affidavit. The Husband explained that he had made full
disclosure of the Thai Bank Account. He had misplaced the passbook and
obtained copies of the same from the bank. The Husband explained that there
was nothing suspicious about the withdrawals which were used in connection
with the Thai property. All one can infer from the passbook was that there was
a continuous stream of withdrawals. _Prima facie_ , it is difficult without
more substantiating evidence from the Wife, to say that those transactions
were suspicious.

(vii) Conclusion

28 I accept that the Husband made full and frank disclosure of his assets and
I decline to draw any adverse inference against him. In _O’Connor Rosamund
Monica v Potter Derek John_ [2011] SGHC 53 at [36]–[37], I had already set out
the relevant principles on the drawing of adverse inferences. I cite again the
Court of Appeal in  _Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd_
[2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [50] which held:

_The drawing of an adverse inference, at least in civil cases, should not be
used as a mechanism to shore up glaring deficiencies in the opposite party’s
case, which on its own is unable to meet up to the requisite burden of proof_.
Rather, the procedure exists in order to render the case of the party against
whom the inference is drawn weaker and thus less credible of belief.

[emphasis added]

In order to draw an adverse inference, there must at least be a _prima facie_
case against the Husband.

29 It is noted that allegations (iv) to (vi) were only made by the Wife at the
hearing itself. A critical gap in the Wife’s submissions is that while she
asked the Court to draw an adverse inference, she failed to state _what kind_
of adverse inference she wanted the Court to draw based on the evidence she
drew the Court’s attention to. The Wife merely argued that the transactions
were suspicious. This is unhelpful – what kind of suspicions arose from the
bank statements that showed a series of withdrawals over a long period of
time? The Wife did not actually argue that the Husband was _actively
dissipating_ his assets by diverting his funds to other bank accounts that he
did not disclose. Was the Court supposed to draw an adverse inference that the
Husband was dishonest and hiding his assets from _mere suspicions_? The series
of withdrawals in the Husband’s bank statements also did not _prima facie_
look suspicious. The Husband gave a reasonable explanation that he has
expertise in forex transactions and used his own funds and bank accounts to
engage in forex trading. The Court cannot and should not fill in the gaps of
the Wife’s case.

30 It is a fact that funds in bank accounts are special matrimonial assets in
the sense that they are _highly liquid_. The Court would be sensitive to this
fact and would claw back funds in which it is clear that one party was
actively transferring out funds for the purpose of dissipating the matrimonial
assets. However, this was not a case where the Wife argued that the funds in
the Bank account should be _put back_ or frozen _as of a certain date_ because
large withdrawals were made that largely diminished the funds in the Bank
account. The Wife only asked the Court to look at bank statements which
presented a constant pattern of debits and credits among the various bank
accounts. The Court cannot fill in the gaps of the Wife’s evidence and the
bank statements _per se_ do not lead to an adverse inference that the Husband
was dissipating his funds.

The Pool of Matrimonial Assets

Disputed Matrimonial Assets

31 I accept the Husband’s evidence that the Great Eastern insurance policy No.
[xxx] should not be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband
explained that this insurance policy was funded by his employer at that time
and ceased with his employment. There was no surrender value to include in the
pool of matrimonial assets. Similarly, I accept the Wife’s evidence that her
insurance policy Zurich Assurance Life Policy No. [xxx] has no surrender value
to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. I also accept the Husband’s
evidence that the Royal Skandia Account (unknown value), SGAVC Equitable Life
(£9,750) and SGAVC Norwich Union (£56,395) fell within the QROPS Pension Fund
and I will not include them in the pool of matrimonial assets so as to avoid
double-counting.

Matrimonial Assets Exempted from Division

32 As in [7] above for the Bemali Trust, I exercise my discretion not to
include the Husband’s Phuket Furniture (£25,000), Singapore Furniture
(£10,000) and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) (S$67,817.72). For the Wife, she
can retain her jewellery (£2,845) and the furniture in the Matrimonial Home
(£60,000). In my opinion, it would be fair for the Husband to retain his CPF
savings (totalling S$67,817.67 as of 25 October 2010) and for the Wife,
correspondingly, to retain her jewellery. There is little point dividing the
furniture in the parties’ respective homes since the furniture would lose
value on re-sale. Further, neither the Husband’s CPF savings nor the Wife’s
jewellery were so substantial as to warrant putting them into the pool of
matrimonial assets for division. I note too that the furniture in the
Matrimonial Home was worth more than the Husband’s Phuket furniture (£25,000).

The Currency Conversion Rates

33 The currency conversion rates are chosen either based on parties’ agreement
or consistent with the exchange rate at the time of the hearing: (i) £1 =
S$2.05, (ii) 1€ = S$1.76, (iii) THB21.4288 = S$1, (iv) A$1 = S$1.27 and (v)
US$1 = S$1.59.

(A) The Matrimonial Home

34 The Matrimonial Home was held in the parties’ joint names.

**Matrimonial Home** |  **Net Value**  
---|---  
A 5 bedroom house in Chesham, UK |  Total value: £860,000 (as at 29 July 2010) Liability: £209,803.64 (as at May 2009) **Net Value = £650,196.36 (S$1,332,902.54)**  
  
  

(B) The Other Matrimonial Assets

35 I note that the hearing took place 2 years after the interim judgment of
divorce was given on 20 January 2009. In some cases, a long delay before
ancillaries are determined will give rise to an issue of whether an asset
acquired after the interim judgment should still be considered as being
acquired “within the marriage”, _ie_ , as a matrimonial asset. The Court of
Appeal in _Yeo Chong Lin v Nancy Tay Ang Choo_ [2011] SGCA 8 (“ _Yeo Chong
Lin_ ”) held that the operative date could be (i) the date the writ of divorce
is filed, (ii) the date the parties separated, (iii) the date of interim
judgment and (iv) the date of the hearing. The operative date depends on what
is just and equitable on the facts of the case and differing assets may have
different operative dates.

36 I note that two assets were acquired after the interim judgment: (i) the
Phuket Condominium, B[X], acquired in November 2010 and (ii) the Husband’s BMW
acquired in March 2010. However, both parties were in agreement before me that
the Phuket Condominium, B[X], and the BMW are matrimonial assets to be
included in the pool of matrimonial assets to be decided. Therefore,
implicitly both parties applied the date of hearing as the operative date. I
accept that the date of hearing is the just and equitable operative date in
the circumstances of this case since the assets acquired after the interim
judgment were funded from the sale of undisputed matrimonial assets

37 Although the parties did not dispute that the Wife’s legal fees to Charles
Russell (£4,029.7 as at 2 July 2009) and Harry Elias Partnership (S$29,000 as
at 1 July 2009) were liabilities that can be deducted, I do not accept that
the legal fees for Harry Elias Partnership can be deducted from the pool of
matrimonial assets. The bill from Charles Russell provided in the Wife’s
affidavit did not state the purpose for which the legal fees were incurred. As
the Husband did not dispute this, I will accept that the legal fees were not
incurred for the purpose of these matrimonial proceedings and it can be
deducted as part of the Wife’s liabilities. However, there were no documents
provided in the Wife’s affidavits regarding Harry Elias’ fees at all. I accept
that it is likely the fees were incurred in the course of Harry Elias
Partnership representing the Wife in these proceedings. It was highly unusual
for the legal fees for _these very matrimonial proceedings_ to be deducted
from the pool of matrimonial assets. It would be an unwise precedent to allow
parties to deduct their hefty legal costs from the pool of matrimonial assets.
Whatever liability parties owe their solicitors for the matrimonial
proceedings should be settled from _their own share_ of the matrimonial assets
after division. To deduct the legal fees from the _joint_ pool of matrimonial
assets during the proceedings would be to render any cost order the Court made
in the judgment largely nugatory.

38 The Husband stated he paid for 3 paintings: (i) Mother/Child by Kelyne,
(ii) Miao Bride I by Xue Dai and (iii) The Alure of Illumination by Tain Xu
Tong (“the Paintings”) currently held by the Wife and would like the Wife to
return the Paintings to him. Although the Wife stated that she was the owner
of the paintings, she provided no evidence in support. The Husband adduced an
insurance policy on the Paintings taken out in his name. On the evidence, I am
satisfied that the Husband paid for the Paintings and therefore order the
Paintings to be returned to him as part of his share of matrimonial assets.
The Husband stated the value of the Paintings to be S$44,000 while the Wife
stated their values as S$37,200. Based on the Husband’s insurance policy on
the Paintings, I accept their values to be S$40,000. Any cost incurred in
returning the paintings to the Husband will come out of the Husband’s share of
the total matrimonial assets.

Division of Matrimonial Assets

The Parties’ Contributions

41 It is not disputed that the Husband was the sole breadwinner of the family
and solely contributed to the acquisition of the Matrimonial Home. The Wife
admitted her claim is only based on her indirect contributions to the marriage
over the past 17 years. The Husband admitted that the Wife was an excellent
caregiver and homemaker. Similarly, the Wife should not seek to diminish the
Husband’s indirect contributions to the household. While the Husband’s
indirect contributions were not as extensive as the Wife’s, the Husband was
also a good and caring father.

42 The Wife asked for the full ownership of the Matrimonial Home (50% as her
rightful share of the Matrimonial Home and the other 50% in lieu of her claim
for maintenance). The Wife also asked for 50% of the Other Matrimonial Assets.
The Wife wanted full ownership of the Matrimonial Home and was not agreeable
to the Husband’s proposal to sell the Matrimonial Home because she believed:
(i) it is a good neighbourhood for a single mother with 3 children, (ii) there
was an existing support network of friends and neighbours, (iii) it was
important to provide continuity for the children, (iv) the home is near the
children’s schools, and (v) the Wife was not in a financial position to
purchase another property in the same area. The Husband submitted that a just
and equitable division of the _total_ pool of matrimonial assets would be to
give 65% to the Husband and 35% to the Wife.

43 The Court of Appeal in _NK v NL_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 held that both direct
and indirect contributions are equally important factors. Section 112(2) of
the Charter provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the Court to
consider in determining how the matrimonial assets are to be divided. The
Court is conferred a wide discretion to apportion the matrimonial assets in a
just and equitable manner. I am satisfied that the Husband and Wife’s division
of roles was very much that of a traditional family – the Husband was the
breadwinner and the Wife was the homemaker. In such long marriages, where the
wife is a full time homemaker, the Courts have awarded normally 35% to 40% of
the matrimonial assets (see _Yeo Chong Lin_ and _Lock Yeng Fun (mw) v. Chua
Hock Chye_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520).

44 However, what the Wife is asking for is not a just and equitable share of
the total pool of matrimonial assets. While I agree with the Wife that an
important consideration in division would be the needs of the children and
their requirement of a home, it is not practical for the Wife to retain the
Matrimonial Home. It is expensive to maintain such a large house and the
Matrimonial Home has a substantial outstanding mortgage which the Wife can no
longer depend on the Husband to continue paying. It is more practical for the
Wife to purchase a comparable 4-5 bedroom property, fully paid up without a
mortgage, with her proceeds of the matrimonial assets. I accept the Husband’s
documentary evidence that comparable 4-5 bedroom properties in Chesham, UK,
will cost between £450,000 and £550,000.

45 Therefore, I am of the view that it would be just and equitable to give 35%
of the Other Matrimonial Assets _viz_ S$361,817.10 (S$1,033,763.13 x 35%) and
45% of the Matrimonial Home (S$599,806.14) to the Wife. I give the Wife a
larger proportion of the Matrimonial Home, which will be supplemented by her
lump sum maintenance, to enable her to purchase a comparable 4-5 bedroom
property for herself and the children (see further below at [51]). I will
allow the Wife seven months up to 31 December 2011 to sell the house so as not
to disrupt the children’s schooling.

Maintenance for the Wife

46 Both parties did not dispute the suitability of having a lump sum order of
maintenance for the Wife but disputed only on the multiplicand and the
multiplier. The Husband submitted that he was willing to give the Wife lump
sum maintenance of £1,200 monthly for a period of 5 years (£72,000). The Wife
asked for £2,666.67 monthly for 10 years (backdated from August 2008 when they
relocated), which totals £320,000.40. The Wife stated her monthly expenses to
be £5,183.38, but she included expenses for the children (which would be
double-counting) and a number of household expenses that would be unnecessary
once the Matrimonial Home is sold and replaced by a smaller and more practical
house.

47 Under s 114 of the Charter, consideration must be given to the earning
capacity and financial resources of the Husband in the foreseeable future as
well. The Husband had done exceedingly well without a university qualification
and is currently earning S$28,333.34 per month. However, I accept his
submission that at 50 years of age in his industry, he is past his peak
earning power and his earning capacity is finite. In 2004, the family moved to
Singapore because the Husband’s ex-employer, [C] Bank, offered him a choice of
either taking up a new position in Asia or be demoted in London because his
job position in the UK had became redundant. The Husband was retrenched in the
year 2007 and is no longer employed in investment trading which is
considerably more lucrative than his current position in sales.

48 The Wife had maintained that she would be unable to take up employment
after being out of the workforce for so many years. The Wife submitted that
even part-time work would not be possible because of her inability to get a
caretaker for her children and the son’s requirement of special attention.
However, I am not satisfied that the Wife would be unable to take up part-time
work as her children get older and require less of her time. I am satisfied
that the Wife has the adequate skills to return to the workforce – she used to
work as a secretary, had worked for a period of the marriage in [E] and in
[F], and the Husband had also submitted that he had funded the Wife’s
enrolment in an interior design course in 2006 and a nail technician’s course
in 2008.

49 It is important to keep in mind that the underlying goal of s 114 of the
Charter is financial preservation so far as practicable and reasonable in the
circumstances. The principles of s 114 were also succinctly cited by the Court
of Appeal in _BG v BF_ [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [74]:

The High Court in _Wong Amy v Chua Seng Chuan_ [1992] 2 SLR(R) 142 made some
crucial observations in relation to these powers: (a) adequate provision must
be made to ensure the support and accommodation of the children of the
marriage; (b) provision must be made to meet the needs of each spouse; and (c)
at the end of the day, it is the court’s sense of justice which demands and
obtains a just solution to many a difficult issue: see also _Quek Lee Tiam v
Ho Kim Swee_ [1995] SGHC 23.

It is recognised that the Wife had been deprived of working capacity during
the marriage and maintenance is needed to ease her back into the workforce and
even out any economic prejudice she might have suffered during the marriage.
However, the Wife was expected to regain as much self-sufficiency as possible
(see _Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee_ (_alias Ho Kian Guan)_ [1995] SGHC 23).

50 The Husband also submitted that the Wife would receive a State Pension when
she turns 65, which is presently £500 but is index-linked. I am of the view
that it would be fair and reasonable to give the Wife £1,000 monthly for 17
years, which would total up to a lump sum maintenance of £204,000 (or
S$418,200).

Final Division between Husband and Wife

51 In total, the Wife would receive 35% of the Other Matrimonial Assets
(S$361,817.10), 45% of the Matrimonial Home (S$599,806.14) and a lump sum
maintenance of £204,000 (S$418,200), which totals up to S$**1,379,823.24**
(£673,084.51). This would be sufficient for the Wife to purchase a comparable
4-5 bedroom property in Chesham (£450,000-£550,000) with a substantial amount
remaining for her future expenses. The Wife would receive her share of the
total matrimonial assets from the proceeds from the Matrimonial Home. Whatever
remains outstanding to the Wife (after deducting the proceeds when the
Matrimonial Home is sold and the value of her own assets) will be paid by the
Husband directly to her in cash.

52 The Husband will receive 65% of the Other Matrimonial Assets (S$671,946.03)
and 55% of the Matrimonial Home (S$733,096.40). After deducting the lump sum
maintenance he must give the Wife, the Husband’s share of the total
matrimonial assets is **S$986,842.43**.

Maintenance for the Children

53 The Wife wanted reimbursement of S$4,914.06 for the children’s expenses and
requested that it be paid to her directly from the Husband’s share of the
assets. I am not satisfied, after looking at the Wife’s receipts which were
filed after the Wife’s final substantive affidavit, that the Wife should be so
reimbursed; there is no basis, outside of the children’s maintenance and the
Bemali Trust, for the Husband to reimburse the Wife for such expenses.
Therefore, I will not make such an order.

54 The Husband submitted that the Wife receives Child Benefit, Disability
Living Allowance (for the son) and Child Tax Credit from the UK Government
totalling £1,239.60 monthly. From the Wife’s evidence, it appeared she
received £9,931.65 worth of Child Tax Credit for the period 6 April 2009 to 5
April 2010. The Wife also adduced a letter dated 15 April 2009, from the UK
Disability and Carers Service, stating she will receive Disability Living
Allowance (for the son) of £65.75 weekly (£263 monthly) from 8 April 2009
onwards. According to a letter dated 4 February 2009 from the UK HM Revenue &
Customs, the Wife will be entitled to Child Benefit for all three children at
£46.40 weekly (£185.60 monthly) from 5 January 2009 onwards.

55 The interim maintenance for the children was £700 each (a total of £2,100),
not including the children’s school fees and education-related expenses. The
Husband is agreeable to continue paying such an amount. I find the Wife’s
claim of £1,500 for each child (a total of £4,500) excessive. I am of the view
that a fair and reasonable sum of maintenance for each child will be £800 each
(a total of £2,400). This takes into consideration that the Wife receives UK
subsidies for the children and the £800 is not inclusive of the children’s
school fees and education-related expenses which are paid from the Bemali
Trust. Although the Husband is earning a reasonably high monthly salary,
consideration must also be given to his own expenses and liabilities.

Costs

56 Both parties wanted costs of the ancillary proceedings. At the interim
judgment stage, the Husband was ordered to pay the Wife costs fixed at
$1,800.00. The Wife argued costs of the ancillaries proceedings should be
awarded to the party awarded costs below unless the party had acted
unreasonably or for other good reasons, following the case of _Tham Khai Meng
v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette_ [1997] 1 SLR(R) 336 at [50] (“ _Bernadette_ ”).

57 I am of the view that this is an appropriate case with “good reasons” to
differ from the norm in _Bernadette_. _Bernadette_ cited _Shi Fang v Koh Pee
Huat_ [1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 at [56] (“ _Shi Fang_ ”) for the proposition that
the hearing of the ancillary matters was a continuation of the hearing of the
petition. However, I note that the Court in _Shi Fang_ at [56] held that
“[i]mplicit in the grant of such decree to the wife was the finding of the
fault on the part of the husband as a cause for the divorce”. The Court in
ordering costs must be sensitive that the cost order does not run contrary to
the no-fault basis that underlies our jurisprudence on divorce. In this case,
the Husband actually filed the divorce petition first but he submitted that he
consented to interim judgment based on the wife’s counterclaim to avoid
unnecessarily protracting legal proceedings. I also note that the Husband made
several offers of maintenance to the Wife but the Wife rather unreasonably
repeatedly failed to give the Husband any figure. The Husband also attempted
unsuccessfully to discuss the Wife’s allegations of non-disclosure and resolve
the ancillary issues through discussions with the Wife but she refused to
negotiate. Therefore in the light of the facts of this case, I order that each
party bear his or her own costs for the ancillary matters.
