**JUDGMENT:**

**GROUNDS OF DECISION**

1\. In 1951 Liu Swee Chin married Huang Han Jiang under the Civil Law
Ordinance, Singapore. Liu’s first husband (for whom she bore a son, Lee Yew
Wee) died in the Second World War. Lee was about 6 or 7 years old when Liu
married Huang. Liu bore two children for Huang; a daughter, Rose Huang, and a
son, Huang Yew Bin. In their early days Huang and his family lived together
with his mother and aunt in a rented house at 73 Siang Lim Park. The monthly
rent was $23.50. Liu worked as a clerk at Lee Rubber Company Pte Ltd from 1951
to March 1971. Her annual salary in 1951 was $3,800 inclusive of bonus
payments. Her annual pay in 1970 was $8,200 inclusive of bonus payments.
Except for two lean years in 1952 and 1953 her annual income was above $3,000.
Huang was a civil servant from 1961 to 1969. His annual income ranged from
$5,500 to $8,000. He testified that he also worked part-time as an accountant
earning an extra $150 monthly.

2\. In 1961 Huang purchased a semi-detached house at 86 Jalan Seaview. He
related under cross-examination that he bought this house because his rented
house was full of termites, mosquitoes and other insects which gave his
children skin problems. After talking over with his mother, he made the
decision to purchase his own property. Liu supported this decision, and
through a friend, he found 86 Jalan Seaview. The house was purchased on 12
June 1961 at the price of $25,000. Huang testified that he paid a total of
$30,000 for it. The extra $5,000 included expenses such as legal and stamp
fees, and an additional $,1500 which the vendor demanded and Huang conceded.
Although Mr. Balagopal, counsel for the plaintiff Lee, suggested to him that
the legal costs and stamp fees could not be more than $1,000, Huang disagreed.
Although he could not recollect what the extra costs were comprised of, he
recalled clearly that the total cost of the house to him was $30,000. Huang is
now 77 years old. He was frail in body but not of mind. His speech was slurred
by his physical infirmity, but once his words were deciphered, they reflected
a remarkable clarity of sense and detail. I am content to accept the evidence
of facts as he recalled them. He testified that he took a loan of $12,000 from
the Malaya Borneo Building Society while Liu contributed $6,000; $4,000 of
which was borrowed from her colleague, and $2,000 came from her savings. His
mother gave him $3,500, and he also utilized the sum of $4,500 paid to him as
"tea money" by the tenant who took over his Siang Lim Park house. Lee produced
a note written by him on 9 April 1987 stating that Liu contributed $8,500
towards the purchase price of the property. Lee testified that the note was
signed by Liu. Mr. Lee, counsel for Huang, objected to the admission of this
note because the signature has not been proved to be Liu’s. I admitted the
note in evidence as it was produced by Lee as evidence received by him and on
his evidence that he witnessed Liu’s signature at the time. However, the
weight to be given to that document is another matter. It is not known under
what circumstances the note was made. On the whole, it raised more questions
than answers. I am of the view that it was a document procured by Lee and
inspired by an exercise book given to him by his mother, Liu. That book
carried a notation of $8,500, in Huang’s handwriting, as the amount paid into
the bank about April 1961. It was, therefore, Lee’s case that the financial
contribution made towards the purchase price was $8,500.

3\. Liu died on 15 February 1992 leaving her entire estate to Lee under a will
made in 1978. No provision was made in her will for her two children by Huang.
Lee as executor of her estate sued Huang for a half share of 86 Jalan Seaview
on the ground that by virtue of her financial and non-financial contributions
she was entitled to an equal share of the property. Huang conceded that Liu
made a contribution, but that was no more than $6,000. Counsel argued on his
behalf that Liu was, therefore entitled to a share in the property, but by
reason of the small contribution made compared to that by Huang, her share
should not be more than 6.1 per cent (6.1%).

4\. Counsel for both sides fought on the basis that Liu’s entitlement was
based on a constructive trust. They thus took pains to ascertain the direct
and indirect contributions made by the husband and wife. The position in law
is neatly summarized in a passage from Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol 48, at
page 325. That passage reads as follows:

> "Where the house is taken in only one of the two names, usually in practice
> the man’s, the position is more complicated. Subject to any declaration of
> trust, where property is purchased in the man’s name but both parties
> contribute to the purchase price, the woman acquires an interest under a
> resulting trust proportionate to her contribution to the purchase price.
> Alternatively, she may wish to make a claim under a constructive trust. On
> such a claim the first and fundamental question which must always be
> resolved is, whether independently of any inference to be drawn from the
> conduct of the parties in the course of sharing the house as their home and
> managing their joint affairs, there has at any time prior to the
> acquisition, or exceptionally at some later date, been any agreement,
> arrangement or understanding reached between them that the property was to
> be shared beneficially. This common intention which has been said to mean a
> shared intention communicated between them and which must relate to the
> beneficial ownership of the property can only be based on the evidence of
> expressed discussions between the parties, however imperfectly remembered
> and however imprecise their terms may have been. Once a finding to this
> effect is made, it will only be necessary for the party asserting a claim to
> a beneficial interest against the party entitled to the legal estate to show
> that he or she had acted to his or her detriment or significantly altered
> his or her position in reliance on the agreement in order to give rise to a
> constructive trust or proprietary estoppel."

5\. On the evidence before me I am unable to find any agreement between the
defendant and Liu, whether before or after the purchase, as to how the
property was to be shared. Liu has died, and the evidence of the defendant was
simply that he decided to purchase the property after discussing with his
mother. He testified that Liu supported his decision and managed to obtain a
loan of $4,000 from her colleague to add to $2,000 of her own savings which
she then gave to the defendant. He deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-
chief that he made a will on 2 April 1987 giving the house to his two children
by Liu and the latter did not protest. That will was subsequently revoked.
Nothing more was said and this point was not pursued very far. It could be
that Liu intended her contribution to be a gift to her husband, but the
evidence was also insufficient for me to come to this conclusion with
confidence. In the circumstances, the most equitable finding that I can make
is to hold that Liu be entitled to a resulting trust proportionate to the
amount of her contribution. I have little difficulty accepting the defendant’s
evidence that the total contribution by Liu was $6,000. The plaintiff’s
contention that it was $8,500 was based on two documents. The first was the
cash book with the sum $8,500 written in it (with no reference as to what it
was for), and the second was the letter signed by Liu but written by the
plaintiff. It was signed at a time when Liu was suffering from physical and
psychological problems. These were indicated in the medical reports produced
by the parties in this trial. But the real disadvantage was that Liu, having
died, could not be cross-examined on that document. The defendant on the other
hand gave a good account of his version under cross-examination, and I have no
difficulty accepting his evidence.

6\. Counsel for both sides agree that _Mercier v Mercier [1903] 2 Ch 98_ has
often been cited as the authority for the proposition that a presumption of
gift applies only when a husband buys property in the name of his wife but not
when the wife buys property in the name of the husband. That case was affirmed
on appeal on a much narrower point of law which is irrelevant to the present
case before me. I think that two points ought to be made. The first is that
authority represented by _Mercier v Mercier_ is, I think, rapidly becoming
archaic. It represents the social thinking in the early twentieth century when
men were still generally regarded as the bread-winners in the family. A man
would not uncommonly purchase properties in the name of his wife so that they
may not be vulnerable to creditors. But he can only do so honestly if he
genuinely gave the properties as a gift to her. Thus, the presumption operates
in some way towards the maintenance of that virtue. In present times, the
bread-winning duty is commonly shared between husbands and wives. The
incentive a man might have in the past to place his properties in his wife’s
name is an equally attractive incentive to the wife today to place hers in his
name - especially where the wife is a business woman and the husband a
salaried employee. It may soon be necessary to extend the presumption to cover
properties purchased by a wife in the husband’s name; alternatively, it may no
longer be justified in maintaining the doctrine of presumption of advancement
(from husband to wife). I do note, of course, that the facts in the present
case occurred in 1961 where the _Mercier_ way of thinking still held sway.

7\. The second point is that although the presumption of gift does not apply,
the defendant could still prove that the contribution by his wife was a gift
by her to him. However, on the evidence before me, I am not able to come to
such a finding. The defendant himself had not averred that Liu’s contribution
was a gift.

8\. As both parties were desirous of selling the property, I ordered the
property to be sold and the estate of Liu Swee Chin be given 20 per cent (20%)
of the net proceeds of sale after deducting the expenses of sale. I have left
the mechanics of sale to be agreed by the parties with liberty to apply. The
defendant was ordered to remove the caveat within a week.

9\. Mr. Lee for the defendant submitted that costs should be borne by the
plaintiff because he failed in his prayer for a 50 per cent (50%) share of the
house, and also that he had rejected a "without prejudice" (Calderbank) offer
made to him by the defendant on 15 May 2000 in which the defendant offered him
a 20 per cent (20%) share in the proceeds of sale. I am of the view that since
the plaintiff had succeeded substantially, he is entitled to some costs. The
Calderbank Offer was made virtually at the end of the trial. In the
circumstances, I am of the view that the plaintiff be awarded one-third costs
up to 15 May 2000, with no order as to costs on the counter-claim which was
essentially for an order that the caveat be removed.
