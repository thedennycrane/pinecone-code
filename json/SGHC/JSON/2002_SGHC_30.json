        "(i) The conclusive evidence clause": "17. I deal first with the conclusive evidence clause as contained in\n\nresolution (G). To paraphrase this, it provides that as between DBS and BCPL a copy of a\n\nresolution of BCPL is conclusive evidence of the passing of that resolution as long as\n\nthat copy is certified as correct by the chairman of the meeting and by the company\n\nsecretary or another director. In this case, one of the documents sent to DBS on 23 July\n\n1997 was an extract of the resolution rescinding the signing instructions contained in the\n\noriginal mandate and appointing Mr Phua as the sole signatory of the account. This extract\n\nwas certified as a true copy of a resolution passed by the company by the signatures of Mr\n\nPhua as a director and Mr Chua as the company secretary.18. It was submitted on behalf of BCPL that a conclusive evidence\n\nclause cannot apply where the purported act relied on is a nullity.Halsbury’s\n\nLaws of SingaporeVol 10 para 120.021 was cited. This paragraph reads:‘Conclusive evidence means evidence which must be accepted as\n\n  proof and cannot be contradicted. Where the conclusive evidence is provided by a legal\n\n  authority, it may, however, be challenged as being a nullity if the authority has acted in\n\n  bad faith or in a ultra vires manner in giving the evidence.’The analogy drawn by BCPL was that the conclusive evidence clause could\n\nbe challenged because the resolution relied on had been declared to be a nullity by the\n\ncourt. I did not accept this argument. The passage fromHalsbury’swas dealing\n\nwith a situation where evidence is provided to a court in bad faith or in an ultra vires\n\nmanner. In that case, the quality of the evidence must be impugned. The conclusive\n\nevidence clause here was intended to give DBS protection from irregularities in the\n\ninternal management of BCPL and to prevent BCPL from subsequently retracting from the\n\neffect of documents that it had itself supplied DBS with. In that situation, no question\n\nof providing substantial evidence to a court would arise and, further it would not be\n\nunfair to allow DBS to rely on the clause to justify its actions.19. On the other hand, however, I took the view that a conclusive\n\nevidence clause has to be interpreted strictly because the effect of such a clause is to\n\noust the court’s jurisdiction to consider all relevant facts before coming to a\n\nconclusion. What the clause means is that once the matters stated in the clause have been\n\nproven to exist, the court must draw a certain inference from them and cannot look at\n\nother evidence which might contradict such an inference. In this case, for the conclusive\n\nevidence clause to be relied on by DBS, it had to show that it had been provided with an\n\nextract of a resolution which had been certified as correct either by two directors or by\n\none director and the company secretary. The certification here came from one director and\n\na person purporting to be the company secretary. This person, Mr Chua, was not in fact the\n\ncompany secretary as his appointment was null and void in that the resolution appointing\n\nhim to the post in place of The Mui Ngo was one of the resolutions declared void by the\n\ncourt order. Even without such declaration the resolution would have been a nullity as it\n\nwas passed by only one director of BCPL.20. Since the pre-condition for the applicability of the conclusive\n\nevidence clause had not been fulfilled ie the extract had not been signed by the correct\n\npersons, DBS could not rely on the conclusive evidence clause to prevent BCPL from\n\nchallenging the authenticity of the new mandate and holding DBS to account for not\n\ncontinuing to comply with the original mandate. It should also be noted that although the\n\nconclusive evidence clause was bandied about both in evidence below and in submissions, it\n\nwas not directly invoked in the defence filed by DBS. Nor in fact was there even an\n\nindirect reference to resolution (G) by way of a general reference to the contractual\n\nterms of the relationship as embodied in the ten resolutions passed on January 1997.",
        "(ii) The pleadings": "21. This brings me to the main issue of the appeal which was whether\n\nthe defence as pleaded by DBS entitled them to succeed on the grounds that were found in\n\ntheir favour. A resolution of this issue depends on the construction of the pleadings.22. I think it would be helpful to deal with the statement of claim and\n\ndefence in conjunction with each other, as far as possible. The first three paragraphs of\n\nthe statement of claim gave the particulars of BCPL and DBS and stated that BCPL was at\n\nall material times a customer of DBS. These three paragraphs were admitted by paragraph 1\n\nof the defence.23. Paragraph 4 of the statement of claim stated that as BCPL was a\n\ncustomer of DBS, DBS owed BCPL the contractual duty to honour BCPL’s written mandate\n\nor order and/or to exercise due care in the discharge of DBS’s duties to BCPL. By\n\nparagraph 2 of the defence DBS admitted only that they were under a duty to honour\n\nBCPL’s written mandate. DBS denied the rest of paragraph 4 of the statement of claim.24. Paragraph 5 of the statement of claim averred that at all material\n\ntimes DBS had only been authorised to honour cheques issued by BCPL if the same had been\n\nsigned by Mr Peh and Mr Phua jointly. This was pursuant to the original mandate dated 27\n\nJanuary 1997. In response paragraph 3 of the defence denied that assertion except to the\n\nextent that it meant that DBS was authorised to honour cheques issued by BCPL which were\n\nsigned by Mr Peh and Mr Phua jointly for the period from 27 January 1997 until 22 July\n\n1997 (both dates inclusive).25. In paragraph 6 of the statement of claim it was averred that in\n\nbreach of DBS’s obligation to BCPL, DBS purporting to act on a forged and/or invalid\n\nundated document which purported to rescind the original mandate, honoured cheques signed\n\nonly by Mr Phua. Short particulars of these cheques were then given. In paragraph 7, BCPL\n\naverred that the new mandate relied upon by DBS was made pursuant to a purported\n\nresolution of the board of BCPL passed on 23 July 1997 and that this resolution was\n\ndeclared null and void by the court order. In paragraph 8, BCPL averred that by reason of\n\nthese matters, the new mandate was invalid and/or null and/or void and/or of no effect and\n\nat all material times the original mandate was still operative and had not been revoked by\n\nthe new mandate. By reason of these matters, BCPL averred, in paragraph 9, that DBS had\n\nwrongfully and without BCPL’s authority paid the cheques referred to in paragraph 6\n\nand wrongfully debited BCPL’s account with the amounts of the same.26. The meat of BCPL’s claim was thus set out in paragraphs 6 to\n\n9. No further reference to the statement of claim is necessary.27. The meat of the defence was in paragraphs 4, 7, 8 and 9 and it is\n\nnecessary to set these out in full:‘4. The Defendants aver that from 23 July 1997 onwards,\n\n  the Plaintiffs’ only authorised signatory was Phua Ah Pok, and in this regard, the\n\n  Defendants shall rely on two documents signed and executed by Phua Ah Pok as the\n\n  Plaintiffs’ director and chairman of a Board of Directors meeting on 23 July 1997,\n\n  and by Chua Thong Jiang Andrew as the Plaintiffs’ company secretary, and given to the\n\n  Defendants, namely:(a) Extract of Resolution Passed by the Board of Directors of\n\n    Bok Chee Seng Construction Pte Ltd on 23 July 1997; and(b) Change in Authorised Signatories – Resolution Passed by the\n\n    Board of Directors.(hereinafter collectively \"the Mandate Documents\")5. Paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim is denied, and the Defendants\n\n  deny that they had acted in breach of their purported obligations as pleaded or at all.6. …7. In respect of paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim, the Defendants\n\n  repeat the contents of paragraph 4 of the Defence herein. The Defendants further aver that\n\n  the first time they had sight of the purported Order of Court dated 11 December 1998 in\n\n  Originating Summons No. 1306 of 1998 was when the Plaintiffs’ solicitors, Messrs Tan\n\n  Chew Yew & Partners, sent their letter dated 5 January 1999 to the Defendants\n\n  enclosing by way of service the said purported Order of Court dated 11 December 1998. Save\n\n  as aforesaid, paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim is denied.8. In respect of paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim, it is denied\n\n  that by the matters as pleaded in the Statement of Claim or at all, the mandate evidenced\n\n  by the Mandate Documents is invalid and/or null and/or void and/or of no effect. It is\n\n  averred that at all material times, the Defendants acted with authority and in accordance\n\n  with the terms of the relevant mandate as evidenced by the Mandate Documents. Save as\n\n  aforesaid, paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim is denied.9. By reason of the matters aforesaid, paragraph 9 of the Statement of\n\n  Claim is denied. The Defendants aver that the Plaintiffs’ alleged claim is in respect\n\n  of cheques issued by them for the periodfrom 16 August 1997 until 6 March 1998(both dates inclusive), as stated in paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim. The Mandate\n\n  Documents reveal that the relevant mandate as evidenced by the same was lawfully complied\n\n  with by the Defendants when the Defendants duly honoured the cheques signed by Phua Ah\n\n  Pok, who was the duly authorised sole signatory at the material times. The Defendants\n\n  further aver that the service of the Order of Court dated 11 December 1998 on them by\n\n  Messrs Tan Cheng Yew & Partners by their letter of 5 January 1999 does not\n\n  retrospectively or otherwise render the acts of the Defendants in honouring the said\n\n  cheques issued in the aforesaid period unauthorised and/or in breach of the relevant\n\n  mandate as aforesaid.’28. The submission made on behalf of BCPL at the appeal was that the\n\nabove quoted paragraphs of the defence made it plain that the essential point relied on by\n\nDBS was that DBS had followed the terms of the new mandate and that was the correct\n\nmandate to follow. In other words the defence case was that there was no breach of\n\ncontract and that DBS was authorised to debit BCPL’s account in the way that they\n\ndid.29. Counsel then referred to the following passage fromModern Law\n\nof Bankingby E.P. Ellinger:‘… The second function of a cheque, which defines its legal\n\n  nature as between the customer and the bank, is that it constitutes an order or\n\n  instruction issued by the former to the latter … This means that, as between the bank\n\n  and the customer, the contractual relationship arising from the drawing of the cheque is\n\n  primarily governed by the principles of the laws of agency. Consequently, the bank’s\n\n  duty is to adhere strictly to the terms of its mandate. If the bank deviates therefrom, it\n\n  does so at its peril. This point has been explained most clearly by Devlin J in a case\n\n  relating to the liability of a bank that departed from the instructions given to it by the\n\n  customer as regards the opening of a letter of credit:It is a hard law sometimes which deprives an agent of the right to\n\n    reimbursement if he has exceeded his authority, even though the excess does not damage his\n\n    principal’s interests. The corollary … is that the instruction to the agent must\n\n    be clear and unambiguous.When this statement is applied to the unauthorised payment of a cheque,\n\n  it means that the bank is not entitled to debit its customer’s account with the\n\n  amount involved unless it can plead one of the recognised defences. These include, in the\n\n  first place, the common law defences that can be raised by an agent who disobeys his\n\n  principal, such as estoppel, ratification, and the ambiguity of the mandate … ’30. BCPL submitted that the case put forward by DBS was not one where\n\nit admitted that the debiting of BCPL’s account was not authorised but asserted,\n\nnevertheless, that DBS was not liable because of some accepted defence available to a bank\n\nmaking payment in a breach of mandate case. DBS could have pleaded first that they were\n\nauthorised by the new mandate to act as they did and also, secondly, in the alternative,\n\nthat if the new mandate was not valid, they were still entitled to rely on it because of\n\nthe operation of resolution (G) and/or the rule inTurquand’scase. DBS did\n\nnot so plead. Instead their pleadings showed that they relied entirely on the validity of\n\nthe new mandate and the authority given thereby to them to pay out cheques signed solely\n\nby Mr Phua. As such, they stood or fell by whether they were authorised to pay on the\n\ncheques signed by Mr Phua solely and this meant that once it was held that the new mandate\n\nwas invalid, DBS’s case fell.31. Counsel for BCPL also contended that because of the narrow way in\n\nwhich the issues were framed by the pleadings, other matters which could have constituted\n\na reply to any claim by DBS to be entitled to rely on the indoor management rule were not\n\nbrought into the action by way of a reply and accordingly, no evidence had been, or could\n\nhave been, adduced in respect of such matters at the trial. Counsel asserted that had it\n\nbeen pleaded, that, despite any irregularity or invalidity of the new mandate, DBS was\n\nnevertheless entitled to rely on the same due to the indoor management rule and their\n\nignorance of the internal affairs of BCPL, BCPL would have been entitled to plead, as a\n\nreply, all steps taken by Mr Peh to notify DBS of the problems within the company and, on\n\nthat basis, to contend that the circumstances were such that reliance on theTurquandrule could not be allowed. BCPL would also have had more leeway in their examination of\n\nthe evidence given on behalf of DBS.32. I accepted the above arguments. Having read and carefully\n\nconsidered paragraphs 4, 7, 8 and 9 of the defence, it appeared to me that the main plank\n\nof the defence was that the new mandate was valid and that the order of court operated\n\nsolely between Mr Peh and Mr Phua and did not affect the validity of the new mandate\n\nvis--vis DBS. I took the view that the new mandate was voidab initiosince no\n\nvalid resolution had been passed effecting it. The court order which declared the new\n\nmandate to be null and void and/or rescinded was declaring the existence a state of\n\naffairs that affected not only the parties to the action but affected third parties as\n\nwell. This did not mean that third parties who had acted in reliance on the void mandate\n\nwere automatically liable for having done so. It did, however, mean that such third\n\nparties would have to establish a legal reason why they should not be held liable.33. In order to show a legal reason to avoid liability, DBS would have\n\nhad to plead that reason. The purpose of the pleadings is to define the issues being\n\nfought about. In this case, from the defence filed by DBS it appeared that the issue being\n\nfought about was simply the validity of the new mandate. When BCPL came into court they\n\nwere prepared to fight and win or lose on that issue alone. They were not alerted that\n\neven if they won on that issue, they would have to fight an additional issue ie whether\n\ndespite the invalidity of the authority, due to other circumstances DBS was nevertheless\n\nentitled to act as if the authority was valid and be protected from liability.34. That second issue was not addressed in the pleadings and no notice\n\nwas given to BCPL of it by any of paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 8 or 9 of the defence. Each of those\n\nparagraphs emphasised the point that from 23 July 1997 onwards, BCPL’s only\n\nauthorised signatory was Mr Phua and the new mandate was not invalid or null or void. DBS\n\nasserted that at all times they had relied on the new mandate and had complied with the\n\nsame. It was also clear that the only documents relied on by DBS to support this stand\n\nwere the documents given to them on 23 July 1997 ie those described as ‘the Mandate\n\nDocuments’. No reliance was placed on the provisions of the original mandate. As\n\nsuch, once ‘the Mandate Documents’ were found to be of no legal effect, DBS lost\n\nthe pillar they were standing on and had no subsidiary pillars to support them.35. A detailed analysis of the defence supported BCPL’s\n\nsubmission. As stated, the purpose of paragraph 4 was to aver that from 23 July 1997\n\nBCPL’s only authorised signatory was Mr Phua and to introduce ‘the Mandate\n\nDocuments’. Paragraph 5 of the defence was a straighforward denial of BCPL’s\n\nassertion that DBS had been in breach of their obligation to be BCPL and had purported to\n\nact on a forged or invalid mandate. This denial meant that DBS had not acted on a forged\n\nor invalid mandate. As for paragraph 7 of the defence, it was simply a repetition of\n\nparagraph 4 and an assertion of fact ie that the first time DBS saw the order of court was\n\nwhen it was served on them in January 1999. This assertion was meant to convey that DBS\n\nhad no notice of the irregularities in the new mandate or of the court proceedings\n\nrelating to it. By itself, however, this assertion did not amount to a fresh line of\n\ndefence as a bank which pays out on a forged cheque in ignorance of the forgery is not\n\nexcused from liability by reason only of such ignorance.36. Paragraph 8 of the defence could have contained the averment that\n\nnotwithstanding any invalidity or irregularity in the new mandate, DBS was nevertheless\n\nentitled to rely on it for specified reasons and that the payments made could not be\n\nimpugned. It did not. Instead it contained only a denial in the first sentence that the\n\nnew mandate was invalid and, in the second sentence, an averment that DBS had acted with\n\nauthority because they had acted in accordance with the terms of the new mandate. That\n\nmust be the meaning of the sentence ‘… at all material times, the Defendants\n\nacted with authority and in accordance with the terms of the relevant mandate as evidenced\n\nby the Mandate Documents’. No language was included in this sentence to indicate that\n\nthe words ‘with authority’ referred to anything other than the new mandate.37. Paragraph 9 was in effect a repetition of paragraphs 7 and 8. DBS\n\nrelied on ‘the Mandate Documents’ to show that they had lawfully complied with\n\nBCPL’s instructions by honouring cheques signed by Mr Phua who was asserted to be\n\n‘the duly authorised sole signatory at the material times’. In the last portion\n\nof the paragraph, DBS stated that the service of the court order on them did not\n\nretrospectively render their acts unauthorised. There was no recognition in this paragraph\n\nthat their acts could have been unauthorised from the beginning because of the nullity of\n\nthe mandate and no assertion that despite this possibility, they were nevertheless\n\nentitled to act as they did because they could not be affected by irregularities within\n\nthe company when on the surface all documents appeared to be in order and all formalities\n\nappeared to have been complied with.38. Before me it was contended on behalf of DBS that the pleadings were\n\nadequate and that no further elaboration of their stand had been required in the defence\n\nin the light of the well known rule that parties to actions are not required to plead\n\nlegal principles. The assertion was that the rule inTurquand’scase is a rule\n\nof law and thus may be relied on even though not specifically pleaded. In my view this\n\nsubmission did not meet the objection raised by BCPL. No doubt the rule inTurquand’scase is a rule of law but in order to invoke that rule of law certain facts have to be\n\nestablished. These facts must be pleaded since it must be made clear what facts will be\n\nrelied on in support of the rule. Such a pleading would give notice of the defence to the\n\nopponent and would enable the opponent to plead other facts (if available) which would be\n\nmaterial for the court’s assessment of whether the rule inTurquand’scase had been properly invoked or not. The basic function of pleadings is to enable each\n\nparty to the action and the court to know what case is being brought by the other party.\n\nThis function can only be fulfilled when all relevant facts and averments are contained in\n\nthe pleadings.Conclusion39. I allowed the appeal by BCPL on the basis that the only defence\n\npleaded by DBS was that they acted with authority in that they relied on a valid mandate.\n\nOnce the court below had held, and rightly so, that the effect of the court order was that\n\nthe new mandate was null and void from the start, the defence of DBS had to fail since the\n\nconsequence of the new mandate being void was that it was incapable of conferring any\n\nauthority on DBS. DBS had therefore acted without authority in paying out on cheques\n\nsigned singly by Mr Phua. With respect, it was my judgment that, on the pleadings as they\n\nstood, the District Judge was not entitled to exonerate DBS from liability on the basis of\n\nthe conclusive evidence clause or the indoor management rule. Accordingly, I gave judgment\n\nfor BCPL in the amount claimed with interest and costs both of the trial and of the\n\nappeal.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGEThis does not merit reporting.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
